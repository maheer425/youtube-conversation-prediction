Jst because she has more lines than Rebecca \ndoesn't make her better. I actually prefer her not having lines cuz it made \nher tht more scary and mysterious... u never knew what she was thinkn and \nshe was sly, tricky and jst plainly kicked ass",

Your going to make a X-Men movie that will either please the X-Men \nfans (such as me) or your going to have make a movie that have a wider \naudience appeal. Movies want to make a X-Men movie that have a birder \naudience appeal because comic book fans only make 1% of the audience. \nBeside I doubt Mystique won't have a big rule in this X-Men Apocalypse but \njust have a reasonable  role in this movie as a side villain. We also tend \nto forget she has  also have a role in Apocalypse  comic story lines so \nhaving her make sense. This movie is still will be the the origin of the \nX-Men team. But you have to be careful because not every character isn't \ngoing to have screen time or the movie will be tied down to subplots that \naverage movie going audience will probably complain not to care about \nespecially unknown characters there not familiarize with.

I am looking forward to seeing new actors taking up \nthe rolls of Jean Grey, Cyclops and storm. but I hope that those characters \nare much stronger in the new films. Storm and cyclops were very weak in the \nfirst three X-Men films. Much weaker then there comic book counterparts. \nI'm hoping that cyclops is the leader and storm has a much stronger \npresents,, and somewhat African accent. Those characters Just need better \nwriting!! I think they have plenty of characters to concentrate on that are \nmale & female. Plus I don't believe mystique is an x-man,, she's a bad \nguy/girl! Maybe being a little Layback on the Wolverine is a good idea. \nHe's been the big star of all the x-men films since the beginning. Someone \nelse does deserve to shine. The only way I would be interested in a \nmystique film is if they can explain in the film how she is the mother of \nnightcrawler. Plus nightcrawler becomes an X-Man.\ufeff",
