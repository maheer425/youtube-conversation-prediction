I love the heat and humidity, the beaches, \nthe theme parks, the state parks, and I have a lot of friends there. My \nwife is also from there. We're living in Utah right now, and we've enjoyed \nour time here, but it's not home, so after I graduate next year, we're \nmoving to Florida to be near home and family. People tend to eventually \nmove back home after living all around the world or country. It's in our \nnature. I've also lived in California, and I loved it there, but it's also \nnot home.

                    "text": "+punjaban284 Well the Disney Dream is a cruiseline that sails from Port \nCanaveral on the eastern coast of Florida. It salis to different \ndestinations, but the one I went one was a 4-day 3-night trip stopping by \nAtlantis and Castaway Cay, a private island in the Bahamas owned by Disney. \nThe ship itself has a nice swimming pool, a 3D movie theatre, fancy \nrestaurants, sports area, live shows and performances, and even a water \nride.\n\nNow Disney World is a resort that holds 4 theme parks, 2 water parks, and \n31 hotels. The theme parks are the Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, \nand Hollywood Studios; and the water parks are Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard \nBeach. The Magic Kingdom is almost the same as Disneyland in Anaheim, \nFlorida with some different attractions. Disney's Animal Kingdom is a theme \npark based around animals, specifically African and Asian animals. Disney's \nHollywood Studios is all about the movies (and yes Disney movies) where \nthey have movie-based shows and attractions. Epcot stands for Experimental \nPrototype Community of Tomorrow. It has two themes; a land of the future, \nand a celebration of different countries called World Showcase. \n\nAs for the hotels there are too many for me to say because I don't know all \nof them. But I'll put a link to what they have. All I can say is that every \nhotel is special because they have different themes to blend in with your \nvacation depending on what you choose from. They go from the great \noutdoors, Disney animated movies, African culture, etc. I can however share \nabout the hotel I went to. I stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. \nIt was a beautiful Victorian-styled resort that had two swimming pools, an \narcade, spa, weight room, and restaurants. One thing I love about the \nhotels is that you can take a bus to any theme park and hotel, so u don't \nhave to rent a car.\n\nJust by typing all of this I feel inspired to go back and have fun. I hope \nyou plan out a vacation soon that best fits you!\n\nAnd here's a link to the hotels on the website.\nhttps://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/",
