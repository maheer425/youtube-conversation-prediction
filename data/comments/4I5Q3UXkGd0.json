                "text": "So your graph indicates that 4k makes no difference until you are 5 feet \naway from your TV watching on at least a 80 inch TV screen. If this is true \nthen why is the PC gaming world so excited for 4K PC monitors if in reality \nyou can't see the difference?\n\nEdit: Also to add to this. The average person sits 8-10 feet from their tv \nwhen watching it or playing console games. Also according to google the \naverage screen size is 36.2 inches. Why are gamers in general so excited \nfor 1080p/4K if in reality for most people it doesn't make a difference. \ufeff",

Is there is any link you can provide that backs up what you say, \nplease share.\n\nOn the other hand, one (bad) thing about higher resolution is the fact that \nyou have to in fact *upscale* any content that is natively in lower \nresolutions (like 1920x1080 seen on 4K panels), and upscaling is very hard \nto do well (in fact much harder than downscaling); upscaling can introduce \nartifacts that would be easily visible at the proper viewing distances on \nthe higher resolution panels, but that simply wouldn't exist watching that \ncontent on its own native resolution at its own proper viewing distances.",

I don't understand why the US government don't pitch in and make \nsure everybody gets a good education if they want one. Of course that would \nmean higher taxes, but coming from a country where the maximum tax is 60%, \nI don't see why you shouldn't get a bit higher taxes. But that's another \nargument :)\n\nThere's not much you can do with that. I would suggest get a job (or work \nmore if you already have one) and then start earning for a computer. It's \nnot that expensive at all, so it won't take you long to earn enough. \nUnfortunately, you'd have to buy a whole new one, as there is not much you \ncan use for upgrading, unless your PSU is a high quality. I doubt it, since \nthere is no markers on it. Even a 400W high quality PSU would be \nsufficient. Modern GPU's don't use much power, especially not the Nvidia \nones. Couple a Nvidia 980 (very expensive and powerful) with a powerful \nIntel CPU such as the i7 4790K, and you would only really need 400W. Using \ncheaper and less power consuming components would require even less power, \nsay 300W. But I would probably get a new PSU if it's a low quality China \nPSU :D\n\nGood luck man. I hope you'll figure something out :)",

There is literally nothing in the universe that you can prove \nother than your own consciousness... Which may not even be your own.\nHow, you might ask? Well, for all you know, you *could* just be in a dream \nof a higher being/entity, the dream began when you were born (you don't \nremember your birth right? Do you ever remember the beginning of your \ndreams?) and ends when you die aka \"they\" wake up. So what does this mean \nfor us? It would mean that we're actually dream characters, and they say \ndreams are from the subconscious, so the whole time while we think WE are \nthe conscious and we try to understand our own subconscious minds, it could \nbe that in reality it's the other way around.\nMakes me wonder if this theoretical \"dream\" could become lucid, and the \npossibilities that would result. \nForgive me for blowing your mind.\ufeff",

First off I \nnever said deity I said higher being, as in humans aren't the center of the \nuniverse and if we are just someone's dream they could be a human-like \nspecies with far advanced knowledge and understanding. You can't say it's \nimpossible to dream for thousands of years just because for us humans we \ncan't, in fact one of my friends dreamt for a whole month of his life and \nwhen he woke up he was confused as hell. And I never said dreaming for \nthousands of years, I said just the one life you're living. Also, shut up \nalready about the bible and religion, it has nothing to do with this \ndiscussion, regardless of what you \"believe\" the facts are the facts - \nthere is no way to be sure of anything's existence other than your \nconsciousness. For all you know religion is just as fake as the chair \nyou're sitting in and the computer you're on. It all seems real in this \nlife but we have absolutely no way to tell if it is. Religion could also be \nreal, based on real principles but only on things that happened in the \n\"dreamer's\" world and not in ours which would explain miraculous things \nhappening such as a staff turning into a snake or a sea parting. We don't \nknow what could be possible there",

Could a program be written for this? While there would obviously \nbe a greater number of false or abstract pictures, there is a practical \napplication. If we restrict the program to every possible text document, or \nblueprint, we would get instructions for every invention ever to exist and \nan explanation of their operating principles, every mathematical proof \npossible, and every building that could be built. Again, we would also have \na (nearly) infinite number of incorrect proofs and unstable buildings and \nbroken inventions, but programs exist today that can filter those out.

                    "text": "Let's do the math. Imagine the monitor only had 2x2 pixels. Each pixel can \nshow one of 256x256x256=16,77 million possible colors (common \"true color\" \nor 24-bit depth color spec). Now you chose one of those colors for one \npixel, and you have to go through all other possible combinations of colors \nfor the rest of the pixels. So in a simple 2x2 monitor, you already have \n(2^24)x(2^24)x(2^24)x(2^24), or 2^(24x4) = 2^96 possible images or \ncombinations.\n\nIf you have Full HD or 1920x1080 pixels, that's more than 2 million pixels, \nor exactly 2073600 pixels. The number of possible images on such a monitor \nis 2^(24x2073600). That's the number two raised to a power of almost 50 \nmillion, or *10 raised to the power of almost 15 million*. That means, *a \none followed by 15 million zeros*.\n\nIt's pretty hard to understand what a seriously large number that is.\n\nTake into account there are only 3.15x10^7 seconds in a full year. In fact, \nthe universe itself has just about 14 billion years of age, or 14x10^9 \nyears. That totals just 4.35x10^26 nanoseconds, so less than a one followed \nby 27 zeros. But the number of images we are considering here is, again, a \none followed by 15 million zeros! So after the entire age of the universe \nlooking at different images on this monitor one every nanosecond, and \nwithout repetitions, we still would have covered just 4.35 E 26 images. How \nmany other different ones to go? Well, pretty much we ain't seen nothing \nyet.\n\nTake into account that 10^15000000 (let's call it P as in my blog post) is \nactually 10 times Q=10^14999999, another very large number, just one order \nof magnitude smaller than P. So P = 10xQ. Let's call R the age of the \nuniverse in nanoseconds, so R=4.35x10^26. So using these letters, we just \nwant to compute P - R, or in other words, 10^15000000 - 4.3510^26. How much \nis that?\n\nP being 10Q, P - R is the same as 10Q - R, which is the same as 9Q + (Q - \nR). So after removing the apparent large number of images we've already \nseen (less than 10^27), we still have 9 times 10^14999999 images to go, \nplus another factor which is also almost as large as that Q: Q - R. But \nnotice that such number Q - R is almost equal to Q, in fact, it is equal to \n9x10^14999998 + [10^14999998 - R]. And so and so on.\n\nBasically, for all practical purposes, P - R is just the same P. I went \nthrough the above paragraph just for illustration of how insignificant is R \n(total number of nanoseconds in the entire age of the universe) compared to \n10^15000000. When adding or substracting numbers of such massively \ndifferent orders of magnitude, you just keep the larger number untouched. \nIt changes so insignificantly that for all practical purposes, the result \nis just as large.\n\nSo after the entire age of the universe watching different images without \nrepetition, one every nanosecond, we literally ain't seen nothing yet \ncompared to the total number of different images displayable by that \nmonitor. A number amazingly large, even though we can represent it and name \nit rather briefly: *10^15000000*.",

Also, please learn to read and \ncomprehend what others say. It's true that 448 PPI might be perfectly \nenough for a smartphone on a \"10/15 inch\" distance (which is basically a \nmedium-length hand stretched out before the face of a device's user, and \nit's also quite of a bigger distance than the 10cm-border I've mentioned in \none of my previous posts), but I clearly said \"human's eye\" in my initial \npost. Digital contact lenses and/or mechanical eye implants (yes, just like \nin yours truly Armitage animu and all them Deus Ex/Cyberpunk 2077/Final \nFantasy/Paradise Cracked/Blah-blah-blah-something-else games) require much \nMUCH greater PPI, because they're (OBVIOUSLY) not \"10/15 inches\" away from \nyour head (lol). Sum 2+2, please. The closer the image is to your eye, the \ngreater the PPI of it the human brain requests to be, to experience it \ncompletely comfortably and not feel cheated. With Digital contact lenses \nand mechanical eye implants, basically, the \"image\" IS your eye, that's why \nthe PPI requirement for those things will be absolutely INSANE when they'll \nstart selling worldwide in the future.

                    "text": "+CognizantxNight\nDPI and PPI are different things.\n\nIt's a popular misconception that they're one and the same, but they're \nreally not.\nPPI is the real measure of resolution and it's perceivable quality to the \nviewer when we're measuring any perceivable resolution of anything ever \nthat you're experiencing viewing objects on a computer display or other \ntype of a panel or a device, really. The easily explainable formula for PPI \nis this: the more the resolution in relation to viewable panel's size is, \nthe more PPI is. The more the viewable panel's size is, and the lesser it's \nresolution in relation to the said panel's size is, the lesser the PPI is.\nBasically, you'll have a bigger PPI on a panel that would have smaller \nsize, but greater resolution, and vice versa. No panel out there so far is \nable to get even remotely close to the real human's eye sheer PPI-wise, \nthis is the main reason while we still don't have computers build in right \ninto contact lenses or, hell, even eye implants which they usually show us \nin Cyber Punk Sci-Fi. That is because, actually, human's eye stops \ndistinction of individual perceivable pixels at a point of 448 PPI exactly, \nbut there is a quirk for this - it only does so at a viewing distance of \nroughly 10cm away from the viewable panel. This is roughly the distance \nfrom which you're looking at a smartphone while holding it in your right \nhand on a  moderately stretched out hand. The problem with this is that \nwhen you're bringing anything closer to your eye, even if it has much \ngreater PPI than that of the aforementioned 448 mark, your brain begins \nliterally protesting and your eyes demand much higher PPI than it asked for \nat the 10cm mark or further away. At a 5cm distance your eyes would demand \nfor a PPI of at least 2000 points, before it starts protesting again, and \nno monitor/panel so far is able to provide that.\nAnd to have a completely comfortable experience with something like lenses \nor eye implants, you'll actually need exactly that same PPI which your eye \noperates at in the real life, and since it's more than 4700 points, we \nreally won't see this happening anytime soon, not even in the quite \nperceivable future.\n\nThat's for PPI.\n\n\nNow DPI...\nDPI is basically nothing more than just a measuring method for printing. \nYou see, the thing is...printers don't print exact pixels. Printers operate \nby utilizing thousands of super-small needles that basically spill the ink \nout of their syringe-like noses and spread it across the area they could \ntouch. DPI is literally that - Dots Per Inch. It literally describes that \nthis measure counts how small the printer's ink needles are, how many of \nthem are there, and thus which amount of dots they're able to cover with \nink in relation to one inch of space of the provided paper/material. This \nisn't like PPI, because PPI is an outsider measure which only counts \nperceivable viewing resolution, PPI directly affects viewing quality. DPI \nis not. DPI is actually a parameter that affects a printer on a physical \nbasis, it directly affects hardware inside the thing, not just on a \nperceivable quality scale like PPI. Sure, higher DPI does mean that you'll \nget higher quality/better detalization of the printed image/thing (this is \nespecially true for the 3D printing, though there are some special quirks \nto that particular segment too), but it's mainly used only to describe \nnumber of ink needles and their size inside the printing heads of any \nprinter, really. The more there is and the smaller they are (it's something \nlike a tech-process for modern CPUs/GPUs: the smaller the manufacturing \nprocess is - the more stuff you can cram onto the same area), technically \nthe better the result is, though this is not ALWAYS the case, since there \nare many more factors coming into play.\n\n\nAll in all, to sum it all up:\nDPI and PPI are different things.\nWhen you want to describe an overall perceivable resolution, please refer \nto PPI.\n\nWhen you're talking about printing something, refer to DPI.\n\nP.S. Such thing as a \"DPI\" and a \"Polling Rate\" of a computer mouse is \nactually a thing different than that of printer's DPI, so there are nuances \ntoo.",

Naturally, a person with deteriorating vision will get closer to a \nTV, some people get the cause-and-effect relationship backward.\n\nBe sure to get your vision checked every year and buy new corrective lenses \nas often as needed. Although the trending unconfirmed myth these days is \nthat such items help worsen vision in the long run, since muscles in the \neye get to relax instead of working hard to focus vision.

All of your supposed \"special\" abilities involve not \nhaving a body part or having a bad connection in your brain, whereas to not \nhave a blind spot you would have to have a totally different body part that \nno other human has yet functions either the same or very similarly to an \noptic nerve.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned you have not addressed a single one of my arguments \nwith a valid response other than your wrong.  As I said in my first comment \nif you really are so damn sure that your right without any proof other than \nyour potential failure to conduct an experiment than the world deserves to \nknow about your mutation.

I actually gave a demonstration back in high \nschool to some classmates, because one of them was like 'did you know you \ncan't tickle yourself?' I was like yeah I can, they were like 'no you \ncan't.'

It is a trick that takes advantage of friction by leaning \nback slightly, having slightly more elastic skin that will conform to \nobjects easier, and having slightly stickier bodily secretions.  Popping \neye balls out of their sockets is done by tensing all the muscles around \nthe eye to squeeze it out and then stopping to let it be pulled back in. \n As for synesthesia, it is caused by brain signals being sent to areas of \nthe brain that, according to normal human genetic coding, would not receive \nthem, and was classified as faulty wiring.  Water allergies are the body \noverreacting to water on the skin and thinking it is more dangerous than it \nactually is, then trying to alert the human with pain; this was classified \nas faulty wiring for that reason.  Potters syndrome is a faulty build and \ncan include missing body parts with a scientific explanation, so was both \ncategories.

So if the sun went away, not only would you not know it \nfrom looking at it during that 8 1/2 minutes, you wouldn't feel it either. \nLight and gravity also follow the inverse square law; as they travel, their \nintensity doesn't decrease in a linear fashion. Both the velocity factor \nand the inverse square act as a sort of shock absorber for the universe. \nWhen a planet moves in some far off galaxy, or the wind blows across a \nwheat field here on this planet - it affects every other thing - the shock \nabsorber may dull the perception, but the action is still there, factoring \nin time.\n\nThe question you're asking is, what if we take away the shock absorber? \nWell, if you drive a car over a crack in the sidewalk, you don't feel it \neven though it happened. But, if you push a shopping cart over that same \ncrack, the whole cart jumps in your hands instantly. Take away the shock \nabsorber for the universe? Would you be in for a bumpy ride?

It has a \nhigher \"frame rate\" than  foval vision which would figure as it has lots of \ntieins with limbic system responses such as threat detection.\nAnnother interesting one is to look at yourself in a mirror. Notice \nanything different if you look at end of your nose, or look  yourself in \nthe  eye? To me the bluring of different facial details illustrates just \nhow much visual perception is like autosterograms. It can be done with one \neye, but if with two eyes you use two trigonometry allows you to work out \njust how much concious control one can exert over where your eyes are \nlooking. It's less than 0.2 deg and I beleive in certain circumstance that \ncan be perceived . It's also better than what most eye tracking equipment \ncan manage.",

Every persons eye is a different \nshape which would affect the final resolution.  \n\nThank you coolhands for not being a douchbag. I appreciate you not just \njumping in and being a prick.

To say someone has \nno accent IS having an accent - the same one you do.\n\nAlso, given the origins of English, \"no accent\" would be a very \ncosmopolitan mix of Roman, German, French, and Nordic inflections, and that \nwould be very distinctly an accent by anyone's judgement.

However, our eyes are not square, and they also can only see \nat its best vision in the fovea, the very center 2\u00b0 of our field of vision \n(explained at 3:24).\n\nIf we factored this in, the field of vision in the fovea would only be \nabout 7 megapixels, and the blurrier parts on the outside of that area \nwould only contain about another megapixel, which would be difficult to \ncalculate the number of exact pixels because they would be in inside a \ncircle rather than a square.",

As for the Blind \nspots, I disagree, if I put my thumb up in front of one eye it appears I \ncan see through it...yeah, so the thumb has partially disappeared and \nappeared at the same time this is because only one eye is seeing the image. \nEven though I don't see the thumb disappear it does appear translucent on \none side because...ONLY ONE EYE IS SEEING IT, NOT BECAUSE IT IS A BLIND \nSPOT.",
