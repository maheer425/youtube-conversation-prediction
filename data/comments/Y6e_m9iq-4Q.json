Like focusing a lens you can see finer details \nmore clearly or by unfocusing it you blur the details. And if an expert \nnarration directed their attention to those details it didn't make them \ncome into existence. It just calmed their minds enough so that they could \nsee them. Or aggravated their minds enough so that they couldn't see them \nanymore, just like what psychiatric drugs or sports pep talks do so people \ncan cope without feeling obliged to respond to so much that they would \nnotice and feel bombarded with otherwise.",

We all familiar \nwith the phenomena, but the real question what should or can we do about \nit.. look for \"medical attention\" is a just a nice way of saying we don't \nknow and you don't need to.. This is a channel for knowledge.. I don't want \nthis kind of non-information in it if possible. I'm not closer to know if \nthey dissolve in time, or just accumulate and in later age the brain \ncouldn't ignore them because of their sheer numbers. Can we somehow filter \nthem out? Anybody working on that procedure at all?\n On the other one (Blue field endoptic phenomenon) is the sparkling effect \nI assume. I experience them sometimes when I stand up real fast and your \nexplanation didn't really explains that. It looks like it should appear \nrandomly and it is not in my experience.\ufeff",
