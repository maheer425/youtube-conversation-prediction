I'm from Vietnam and there's no \nway I can go back to exchange for the things that I want at the store, and \nwhatnot. So, anybody or Laura please help me with the adjustment of the \nrecipe. We use gram measurement units for baking and cooking over here in \nVietnam; therefore, it should be hard and a little bit confusing for me to \nadjust the measurements of this recipe. I need help and good advice right \nhere. Please help because I really wish to make myself this cake on my own \nday (not to mention that it costs me $19,74 for the pans, Baker's secret). \n\nI'm sorry for the length and thank you so much in advance. PLEASE HELP !\ufeff",
