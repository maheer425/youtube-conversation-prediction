Maybe for loop (i=1;i=10637; i++) (or at least this is written in C, I \nhaven't studied python yet), controlling if i number is included in a given \nchar (or string it depends on the use) var? (you just have to find \",i,\")\nAs I said, I have no time to spend on it, but I definitely could if I had \nto, I'm pretty familiar with programming (although, not with python).\nOr maybe I didn't get your question and you were talking about python's \nlimitations and programing limitations in general (then sorry for that, \nhowever the answer would be cutting in pieces the input)?\nThat said, there's plenty of ways to do that. Like reprint the output with \nevery number formatted at the same size and confront them, to see what's \nmissing (what I've done with logic after all).",

Those with \"success\" don't complain... the \nrest complain about everything. This, paired up with nostalgia and a lack \nof education and realism gives place to comments like yours. Bottom line is \nthe world is improving day by day. People have become aware of their impact \non the environment, aware of the importance of being well read and \neducated. with increasing tendency people now respect, admire, and seek \nintelligence in their partners. Life isn't a mess, societies aren't moving \nso quick that they become detatched and artificial: every human generation \nwill say this at some point, and it has more to do with how we percieve \ntime as we age than about the world getting frantically quick around us. \nAnimal rights are ok up to a certain point, but people who complain about \ninsects being used to save human lives have a LOT, and I mean a LOT of HARD \nthinking to do about their love for their fellow man. What if their kids \ngot trapped in a building? Ha yeah, not so self righteous now are we...\n\nMan up, grow a pair and face life right in the eyes. And understand that \nthe behavior of our race is a consecuence of the laws of physics that \ngovern the formation of complex systems. This may sound a little bit crazy, \nif it does then it's way past your head, but te truth is that evolution, \nnatural selection, and the survival of the species, even at the expense of \nother species, is *natural* in the most unambiguous, honest and \nstraightfoward way. Right and wrong are only inside our heads, and we made \nthose words up to protect ourselves, from ourselves... which is a huge \nirony because nowadays idiots want to use those same principles to NOT \nprotect ourselves from nature.",

I spend anywhere for 20-30$ a \nmonth on products such as these as well. I need a lot of iron as my body is \neasily run down and I have horrible circulation. I do not buy excessive \namounts of animal products, and all life is consuming of the once living, \nso I really don't have a better option until we are able to synthesize \nwhole foods easily , I would like to think I do my part to eat the least \namount necessary to remain healthy and take care of everything else I can \nwell. If this seems unethical to you, I frankly have no idea what anyone \ncould do in your world view to remain ethical.\n\nLastly, speaking in abstract sense, if a hypocrite says something; let's \nsay \"the sky is blue\", is his comment now wrong just because he is a \nhypocrite? No, the point made still stands independent of who said it, \nwhether or not you would like to admit it.",

If you can show me where in that comment it says insect \nor even implies such, I would be willing to listen to the steaming pile \nthat is vomiting forth from your keyboard. You haven't and won't be able \nto. That's the point.\n\nSecondly I used them as an example because in history we have treated the \nmentally unfit worse than cockroaches multiple times throughout human \nsociety. The metaphor (a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of \nsomething else, especially something abstract ) sticks.The mentally \nhandicapped being representative of an easily taken advantage of group, the \nabstract being the ethics behind taking advantage of the less intelligent \ncreatures behind it.  You aren't following the original question; what you \nwant to do (like a politician I might add) is attack wording that offended \nyou. Frankly I don't care if you were offended, because A) I never said \nwhat you think I said or else you could quote it, B) it was a metaphor with \nhistorical context to back it. Fuck off with your self righteous \npolitically correct keyboard warrior shit and focus on the discussion at \nhand. You have one more option on this thread as well, and that would be to \nsimply stop commenting.\n\nTo respond to your previous edit as well... all things that we take from \nthe earth to survive were once alive in a metaphysical sense. I understand \nthis completely and I am aware that everything I have once ate was once \nalive. I am also aware that life is suffering. As human beings we have to \ndo our best to be able to make these things fit within our own viewpoints. \nI do so, logically I might add, and try my best to further reduce suffering \nfor the *living*. Remorse is for the dead in my view: Also once again you \nsay I made a comparison to insects with the mentally handicapped and \ninsects. Yes I did, but it was not a direct comparison as stated earlier, \nit was an ethical treatment comparison wrapped within metaphor. Apparently \nthis is very hard for some to grasp",
