With most Italian \ndishes, there are endless variations. Yeah, you could screw something up \nbig time by leaving something out or adding too much of something else, but \nfor the most part, Italian cooking can be very forgiving, Laura's pizza \nlooked awesome and I trust she knows when something tastes delicious. \ufeff",

If \nanyone is interested in the difference, Sicilian pizza, or what we \ncall- Sfincione- is a thick dough, topped with a tomato sauce that's on the \nsweet side, and then topped with a sharp grated cheese (no mozza) , usually \nParmesan or caciocavallo. Another traditional topping would be anchovies \nfor those who like them, and grated breadcrumbs on top. In the US things \ntend to get Americanized, until they barely resemble he original, and that \nmakes me sad. That's why I like watching Laura, because her Italian cooking \nis normally very authentic-and it rocks! But, she is also an American \nnow-so it's nice she caters to everyone. But as a proud Sicilian-it kinda \nsucked hearing this called \"Sicilian Pizza\". Anywaayy\u2026... *said like Ellen* \nlol\ufeff",
