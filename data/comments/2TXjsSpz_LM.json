As you know our \nbeloved prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has strongly ordered us to keep our pants \nupto the ankles and to keep long beard . I hope you would follow the \ncommands fully as we all dream of Jannah.May Allah SWT bless us with Jannah \nand keep us away from the hell fire.Keep your good works going. May Allah \nbless you. Please forgive me if I have hurt you or said anything wrong.[ \nSorry for my poor English]\ufeff",
