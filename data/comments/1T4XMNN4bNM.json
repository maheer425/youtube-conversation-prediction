Rectal and vaginal \nmeasurements, or measurements taken directly inside the body cavity, are \ntypically slightly higher than oral measurements, and oral measurements are \nsomewhat higher than skin temperature. The commonly accepted average core \nbody temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F). The typical oral \n(under the tongue) measurement is slightly cooler, at 36.8\u00b0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C (98.2\u00b0 \n\u00b1 0.7 \u00b0F), and temperatures taken in other places (such as under the arm or \nin the ear) produce different typical numbers. Although some people think \nof these averages as representing the normal or ideal temperature, a wide \nrange of temperatures has been found in healthy people.\n\nThe body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 \n\u00b0C (0.9 \u00b0F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures \nin the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities \nchange. Other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core \nbody temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the \nsecond half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the nadir, is one \nof the primary markers for circadian rhythms.

The weight of the water would exert a \ndownward force perpendicular to the seabed, essentially 'pushing' one \ndownwards. However, due to Newton's third law, the water or matter below \nwould also exert an /almost/ equal upward force. Given the magnitudes of \nthese forces at such depths, one's body would be compressed. Perhaps \n'crushed' was the incorrect term, and I apologize, but a very similar \neffect would probably occur.\n\nNot to mention, because the weight of the water is relatively (although not \nabsolutely) unidirectionally downwards, the position in which one's body is \nsuspended in the water, and the surface area exposed, would also contribute \nto what would happen.",

Instead, the water shoots in through the \nweakest spot in the sub and instantly fills it.\n\nThe same would happen to the human body.\n\nBut, I do agree that death would certainly be far less than 90 seconds. \n Death would probably be nearly instantaneous, as water would likely \ninstantly enter your brain through your eye sockets and nasal cavity, \npreventing all functionality from continuing at that instant (that is, if \nyou instantly teleported to that position).",

Rectal and vaginal \nmeasurements, or measurements taken directly inside the body cavity, are \ntypically slightly higher than oral measurements, and oral measurements are \nsomewhat higher than skin temperature. The commonly accepted average core \nbody temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F). The typical oral \n(under the tongue) measurement is slightly cooler, at 36.8\u00b0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C (98.2\u00b0 \n\u00b1 0.7 \u00b0F), and temperatures taken in other places (such as under the arm or \nin the ear) produce different typical numbers. Although some people think \nof these averages as representing the normal or ideal temperature, a wide \nrange of temperatures has been found in healthy people.\n\nThe body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 \n\u00b0C (0.9 \u00b0F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures \nin the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities \nchange. Other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core \nbody temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the \nsecond half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the nadir, is one \nof the primary markers for circadian rhythms. The body temperature also \nchanges when a person is hungry, sleepy, or cold. \n\nalso check out lifeknowhow",

So what? Sure it's illegal and immoral to \nmurder other people and their wanted unborn children. It's ok to murder \nquite a few other places, ie. soldiers in war (which is usually just about \ngreed on nationscale), ie. a policieman to save his own life and/or to save \nthe life of an innocent, which if all humans are equal and murder is \nequally wrong, would be illegal. It would / should then only be legal for a \ncop to use lethal force if he can save more people than it would cost to \nuse legal force... but as a society we have decided that in that moment, \nthe life of a cop or an innocent is worth more than the life of a person, \nwho would take the life of a cop or an innocent. And thus, it's legal to \nkill / murder a bunch of cells, that has no higher thinking... And again \nthe alternative is to birth them into a relatively more likely crappy life \n(torture?).\n\nNo, I don't live in a utopia, but I think, that as part of a society, you \nhave an obligation to the other people in that society, to help them, not \nonly when their life is in danger, but also to help them to a certain \nquality of life.  \n\nYeah, I never said any of that either, but I'm certainly glad the ability \nto read and comprehend doesn't hamper the abilities to procreate. Surely \nthe world needs literally less understanding.\n\nNo, I'm not brilliant, though I'm a bit more intelligent than average, \nwhich does seem weird, because I have a hard time understanding physics and \nmathematics.\n\nBut I understand that not everyone lead happy good lives, and I know \ncertain factors affect that... Combined with morals, I think it's worse to \nput kids in the world, with factors that dramatically lower their odd's of \nleading happy good lives. It's alot more immoral of people to force people \ninto crappy lives, than it is to take a life, before it has started on any \nlevel of thinking.\n\nShe won't have to... I'm smart enough to figure out a condom and she is \nsmart enough to figure our birth controll pills.",

No he murdered an unborn human being and will go \nto jail for it.\n\nYou must live in utopia where all little children are born into rich \nfamilies and never want for nothing.

The topmost of cruelty. For a multitude of arbitrarily \nselected sins. Even I'm not that cruel...\n\nAnd again I have never said we should exterminate people based on my \nstandards.\n\nHowever at conception, human life is not capable of growth on it's own and \nfrankly pondscum is more capable at that point.  Certainly even you didn't \nplay fetch for quite a while from conception.\n\nI'm merely saying that the act of abortion at the very least signifies that \nthe potential child is unwanted, which certainly does not increase the \nchance of a long happy life. Then add in a multitude of health reasons, \nlike drug dependencies, handicaps, mental diseases and economic reasons in \nsome to alot of cases the chances fall even lower.\n\nSure, we all like the story of the underdog beating the odds, but that's a \nrarity, otherwise it wouldn't be an underdog story.\n\nIf you wanna do something to minimize the number of abortions... Teach kids \nto have safe sex, increase healthcare and include mental health care, help \npeople kick the drug habits, make sure that people with handicaps or facing \nthe possibility of a handicapped kid doesn't face enormous economic \nproblems and get all the help they need and in general make sure that noone \nis in an economic state where they can not face having a child. Finally \nmake sure that even if the parents cannot take of their child, for whatever \nreason, that there is a warm loving home available to every child (and I \ndon't class factories of religious indoctrination as a warm loving home).\n\nSo... is there a warm loving home available to every kid, with no parents? \nNope...\n\nUntil theres a better guarantee of help to parents and a good life for \nkids... I think it's quite a bit more up on the evilness scale to demand \npeople put kids in the world no matter what, just to satisfy ones own \nstanding on morality.\n\nAnd I certainly believe the individual woman is more capable of making an \nindividual decision in this regard, than any person making blanket \ngeneralized statements.\n\nPS: \"dogs, cats, bird, fish or pond scum\" could potentially evolve into \nintelligent beings with emotions, given enough time...

Because I was on \ntwitter when I saw Uber Facts tweet this. \"In 2008, a 30 second Doritos \ntelevision advertisement was beamed by radar to a solar system 42 light \nyears away.\" I was at a complete stop, i was stumped. I didn't understand \nwhat the heck was going on!  I asked EVERYONE in my family what it had \nmeant. They couldn't explain it and told me to look it up. I honestly still \ndon't understand ( Thanks internet LOL).

They said they transmitted the \ninformation (a television advertisement) towards a star 48 light years away \nwhich is orbited by planets that *may* harbour life. (you might want to \nskip to the boldface part at the end now)\n\n Also, according to four years worth of data gathered by Kepler (a \ntelescope that searches for Earth-like planets), scientists estimate a \nSun-like star has a 22 percent chance of having a potentially habitable \nEarth-size planets (though they might not all be rocky or have water). *In \nconclusion for this paragraph, Earth-like plants are very common. One in 5 \nSun-like stars have Earth-like planets.*",

But in air it depends a lot on wind factor \n(and your body-fat).

Because that is no contradiction at all...\nOh yes except that every living organism on this planet obides by the rules \nof harmony but this harmony is defined through natural selection, where the \nmost adaptive organism dominates all the others therefore bringing \nharmony....\n\n+Bidmartinlo  Nice one for using China's one child policy as an example of \nan alternative for the \"horrible ways\"... \nOh yes because dictating things like reproduction (because obviously it \nwill stop on dictating just that) for a whole population equals \"peace\" and \n\"harmony\" and not \"slavery\" and \"lack of freedom\"...\n\nWell done for trying to fight a war to \"unite\" humanity in order to bring \n\"peace\"... Or would that be \"oppresing\" humanity in order to bring \"order?\" \n(One specific, MY, order to be exact?)... \n\nWell done on judging the validity of an idea based on its popularity... \nBecause obviously if empires are not \"popular\" = hated by the masses (or \nare they really?) then these must be bad systems, right? Except for all the \nempires, which (before communism took over) managed to unite continents and \nmore... \n\nRoman Empire, Mongol Empire, Macedonian Empire, Ottoman Empire, colonial \nempires? British, French, Spanish, Portugese Empires...\n\nThey all were build somehow... Though not in order to  bring \"peace\" (as \nyou would define it)... But to dominate, because they excelled at this \nthing called civilization... They had the best set of rules for their \nsociety, etc...\n\nand +Ash Almond tell me why would you sacrifice so many wonderful things \nfor security? Why do you despise danger so much?\n\nWould you rather live a long, safe and \"peaceful\" life or one where you \nactually have something to live for, fight for and die for? Remind me what \nthat place you can do all those things in is called? Warzones... right... \nAren't they simply places where someone fights FOR something? :) Not peace \nand love... just love... peace is an illusion... A lie that tells us this \nis the desired state for us, humans, where in fact we thrive best in places \nwhere we have something to strive for...",

                "text": "That whole thing about Humans being the most dangerous animals is BS to me. \nDo you know what accounts for the largest deaths in Wolves in Alaska? Other \nwolves. Wolf Pacts in Alaska actually go to war with each other, Pacts of 5 \nto 10 wolves in each normally have a fatality rate of 50% to 60%. These \nanimals kill each other more than any other animal in that region. \n\nOther animals like Ants, Foxes, Parry Dogs etc. account for more species \ngoing extinct than Humans make species extinct. Contrary to popular belief \nAnimals don't form a balanced ecosystem in their environment. Most \nEcosystems go into caose naturally, either changing of climates, migration \nfrom other species or simply a predator species reproducing too much. \n\nOne sport is Prarry Dog hunting. Their species has reproduced so much so \nthat their numbers are out of control and threatening to destroy their \nEcosystem. So it's actually a sport to simply shoot as much of them as you \ncan to keep the population in flux. Otherwise other species would go \nextinct because they are consuming too much resources. \ufeff",

But if you were to take the moon away from our planet, everybody \nwould die of dehydration, no water wells, there would be no kind of water \nanywhere on earth because the sun is so hot. All the animals would die, \ntoo. Our bodies would probably shrivel up because most of our body is made \nof about 75% water and the water would steam up and we would not have \nenough water to live.
