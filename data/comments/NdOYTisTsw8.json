They \ndon't have to like him, but they have to at least respect him, knowing that \nall music known today all comes back to him. All those bad pop stars of \ntoday, yeah they're inspired by Michael Jackson and they respect him. \nOtherwise, nobody likes them. Music today is good because of him, he \nchanged music. The music today may not sound like his music, but without \nhis music, I don't think music would sound the way it does today. But then \nagain, it also comes back to James Brown because Michael was inspired by \nhim. And yea, he might not be the ideal gayboy that girls are fingerling \nover today, but you bet your ass that every woman he has been around or has \nworked with has fallen in love with him\u2026 Even some had to have Michael put \na restraining order on him.

                    "text": "+Maiken G While things are improving, here is why:\n- Name how often you can walk in public (particularly a university) and \npick out male/female conversations. You will notice women rarely talk about \ntech, programming, engineering, etc. However, they thrive in humanities, \ncommunications, etc.\n- Look through lists of the most ground breaking technological advances. In \nthe recent 100 years, you will find a couple by women, but the vast \nmajority are by men. I am not saying women are not capable but they are \ngenerally less interested.\n- Physical strength: no explanation needed (average muscle mass, bone \ndensity, and testosterone levels are much greater in men).\n- Manual labor - again, no explanation needed because much of it is related \nto physical strength.\n- Aggressive negotiating. There are actual women advocating the ban of \nthings like salary negotiation because there is data supporting that men \nare better at negotiating higher salaries. Aka, be more aggressive about it \nwomen.\n- Politics: Often female politicians have the female population in mind \nrather than everyone. Equal opportunity for EVERYONE is equality. Not \nboosted opportunity for women and ethnic minority groups. It is hard to \ntake female politicians seriously that only have a female agenda.\n- Euler, Pythagoras, Newton, Einstein, Schwartz, Euclid, Pascal, Ulam, \nkarman, Fourier, Gauss, Bernoulli, Neumann, Lagrange, Leibniz, Bayes, \nHilbert, etc... Aka a bunch of men that you can thank for inventing a huge \nportion of the tools needed in pretty much every field of science. \n\nI am not anti women, but I do not believe that women inherently have the \nsame drive for technological advancement. They are generally more nurturing \nand social. You don't apply to college and get assigned a discipline, you \nchoose a program and apply for it. This means that even though there are \noften more women than men in college, they are not choosing the harder \ntech/science majors because they still often have male:female ratios of 2:1 \nor higher. \n\nSo yes, at the moment, I fell men are more powerful than women. I do think \nthat modern living allowing for more independence and there being less need \nto reproduce will lead to more balance but we haven't even had a full \ncentury of women really getting involved in everything, so naturally their \naccomplishments are not going to be anywhere near equal because they need \ntime for new generations to start new trends.",
