There is a pasaje in the Tacitus \nannals when he referred to a man called Christus (that was a comon misspell \nof christ in that date) being killed (no crucifiction mentioned). Sadly he \njust mentioned once in all his document. \n\nBut there is no mention of what this \"christus\" did or said. So the use of \nthe argument \"jesus said\" or \"jesus did\" is still unfounded. That's why \nquoting the bible is not a real argument. \n\nBut thanks for the info about the Annals, are really intresting. ",

A Bill was recently passed \nthat in your town that requires all students to pray in school.  The school \napproaches you with a request to print the prayer book that will be used in \nclasses.  Imagine if you were told you that had to print the prayer books \nfor be faced with a lawsuit?\n\nScenario #2 - Suppose that I own a print shop.  The KKK comes to my shop \nand asks me to print a flyer explaining why blacks are not 'fully human'.  \nI am married to an African-American.  Imagine that I am told that I must \nprint the flyer, or I will face a lawsuit for denying equal services.\n\nScenario #3 - Suppose that I am gay.  Me and my partner decide that we are \ngoing to get a photographer.  After interviewing a photographer, he states \nthat he is sorry, but due to his religious convictions he cannot photograph \nour wedding because it would promote a marriage that he believes would \nviolate god's principles and participate in an act that would not only be \nagainst God, but also assist the couple in an act that might send them to \nhell.  My partner and I decide that we will file a lawsuit against the \nphotographer.\n\nNow, I realize that these scenarios are not exactly the same.  However, \nwhich of these situations uses the threat of force and coercion to make \nsomeone do something they believe is morally wrong?  Who is damaged by the \nuse of force in these situations?\nI find all three of the agents attempting to use coercion and force \ndisgusting. \n\nI think we all like laws when they work in our favor or agree with our \nviews, however we rarely are willing to give up some privileges to ensure \nthat more are universally available for others.  The school can get another \nprint shop, the KKK can get another print shop and the couple can find \nanother photographer.\n\nJust some alternate perspectives to consider.",

Is the house that I rent out \nessential, when there are places for rent? Assuming that someone has a \nplace to live with electricity and the internet, are there any other \nessential services. You can heat and cool your home with electricity. You \ncan buy everything else essential over the internet.\n\nIs a coffee shop where community members hang out essential to a person new \nto the community trying to fit in? Is massage essential when a doctor \ndoesn't prescribe it, even if energizes a person to get work done in less \nthan half the time they might creep painfully through?\n\nIf someone does not act like a danger, is not obnoxious, and doesn't \nmonopolize a resource, then I would say the right to buy is paramount.\n\nI still wonder what theology, or lack of theology, you use to support your \nviews.",

                "text": "In the event of the Holocaust, Nazis believed (religiously, I might add) \nthat Jews deserved to suffer and die. From your standpoint, this was okay \nbecause they were practising their religious freedom. Now you're going to \nsay, \"Well, that's obviously taking it too far.\" Why? Because people were \nactually killed? Does your heart only beat for people when they're \nmurdered? Do the gays have to be tortured and killed in front of you before \nyou figure out there's something wrong?\nOh, but who are we to draw the line? It's wrong to make people go against \ntheir religious beliefs, right? Religious freedom, no matter who suffers!\n\nHow do you think gay people feel in Arizona? Do you even care? Let's make \nit a little less \"extreme\", for lack of a better word. Jesus spoke out \nagainst divorce and unwed mothers. He didn't say anything about \nhomosexuality, though, but let's keep on track. Is it therefore okay for a \nCatholic business owner to refuse an unwed mother/divorced woman service? \nIt could very well be against his religion. How would you feel if you were \nan unwed mother, and everyone in town shunned you because of it? If you're \nnot in favour of this then you have pulled a double standard. There are \nreligions out there that believe if a woman is raped it's her fault. What's \nmore, if anyone finds out about it the entire town is informed. Is it okay, \nin your eyes, to refuse a woman service because she was raped? Somehow, I \nthink you'd have something to say against that. But why? It's part of a \nreligious belief. Even if this isn't your personal belief/religion, you \nhave to support it because of \"religious freedom.\" Or do you only support \nChristian beliefs?\n\nOr ... you could all stop being hypocrites. Do the job you're paid to do. I \nhave to serve chauvinistic assholes at my job all the time. You think I \nwant to? You think I like it? No, but I get paid to do it. If I tried to \nkick a man out of my store because I think he's being an asshole, guess \nwho'd get in trouble; me. Get over yourselves and show some tolerance. Will \nyou also stop serving people of a conflicting religion? I'd like to see how \nthat goes down. Yes, I want to see a Muslim walk in and be refused service \nbecause he/she is Muslim. You wouldn't dare. Or maybe you would - and then \nwe go back around to the double standards. Let's see a Muslim refuse a \nChristian service. That would never fly and everyone would bash the Muslim \nfor it. Double standard. Discrimination against homosexuals is A-okay, but \ndiscrimination against a Christian!? Not in good ol' 'Merica!\n\nHere's a list of other people this bills should legally discriminate \nagainst, because it's in the Bible:\nPhysically  disabled (Leviticus 21:17-18) (Deuteronomy 23:1)\nMisbehaving children (Deuteronomy 21:18-21)\nUgly people (Matthew 18:9)\nAnyone wearing braids (Timothy 2:9)\nWomen wearing men's clothing (Deuteronomy 22:5)\nAnyone wearing mixed fabrics (Deuteronomy 22:11) (Leviticus 19:19)\nWomen who don't obey their husbands (Corinthians 14:34) (Timothy 2:12) \n(Ephesians 5:22)\nAtheists (Deuteronomy 13:6-10) (Deuteronomy 13:12-15) (Deuteronomy 17:2-7)\nMen with short hair and/or men who shave (Leviticus 19:27)\nCheaters, adulterers, divorcees (Leviticus 20:10)\nI'd say slaves too, but luckily we've worked our way out of that one.\n\nWhat ever happened to treating others the way you'd want to be treated?\nNo, you have now become a nation of legalized discrimination. And you \nwonder why Christianity gets panned so much...\ufeff",

                "text": "Only 2.7% of populations identifies themselves as gay and lesbians, 23.2% \nof population identifies themselves as churchgoing Christians, and 27% of \nall churchgoing Christians are supporting same-sex marriage in general.\n \nSupport for idolatry (pornography), fornification (premarital \nco-habitation), adultery (sometimes ok for marital infidelity), divorce \n(supporting divorce for marriages with kids for reasons other than if \nabused), abortion rights is much higher for churchgoing Christians who \nsupport SSM than churchgoing Christians who are against SSM.  Gays and \nlesbian support for the above behavior is much stronger with gays and \nlesbians who are non-Christians being the highest.\n\nThe data comes from a recent research which surveyed 15,738 of Americans, \nages 18-60.  The sample was nationally representative and tracked Christian \nSexual Morality in a same-sex marriage future.  The survey was published in \nPublic Discourse (The Witherspoon Institute) by Mark Regnerus. (\nhttp://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2014/08/13667/)\n\nThe researcher in the study relied on the Relationships in America survey, \na data collection project he oversaw that interviewed 15,738 Americans, \nages 18-60, in early 2014. It\u2019s a population-based sample, meaning that its \nresults are nationally representative.\n\nSample size:       \nChurchgoing Christians who oppose SSM         2,659   (16.9%)\nChurchgoing Christians who SUPPORT SSM        990    (6.3%)\nGay and Lesbian Christians                                     191    (1.2%)\nGay and Lesbian non-Christians                             233   (1.5%)\nPopulation Avg                                                     15,738  \n(100%)\n\nFirst thing I learned was that only 2.7% of population identifies \nthemselves as gay and lesbian \u2013 so the whole issue of pushing LGBT agenda \non the entire population is really amazing.  45% of gays and lesbians \nidentified themselves as Christians.\n\nAbout 23.2% of population identified themselves as churchgoing Christians \nwho have definite view on same-sex marriage \u2013 either \u2018for\u2019 or \u2018against it\u2019 \n- In order to ensure this is not just an exercise in documenting the \nattitudes of Christians \u201cin name only,\u201d the researcher has restricted the \nanalysis to churchgoing Christians\u2014here defined as those who report they \nattend religious services at least three times a month and who \nself-identified with some sort of Christian affiliation. And he has \nrestricted the analysis to those who report a position either for or \nagainst same-sex marriage. (The researcher has excluded the one-in-four who \nreported they are undecided.)\n\nThe fraction of Christians who support of SSM is 27% of all churchgoing \nChristians.\n\nThe survey asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement or \ndisagreement with the seven statements, five of which I listed below:\n(1)    Saying that viewing pornography is OK (form of idolatry)\n(2)    Saying Premarital cohabitation is good (fornification)\n(3)    Saying Marital infidelity is sometimes OK (adultery)\n(4)    Saying Couples with kids should stay married except if abused \n(against divorce)\n(5)    Supporting abortion rights\n \nPercent of population supporting the moral issues above:\nChurchgoing Christians who oppose SSM        4.6% (1)   10.9% (2)    1.3% \n(3)      52.2% (4)     6.5% (5) \nChurchgoing Christians who SUPPORT SSM  33.4% (1)   37.2% (2)   7.5% \n(3)      33.5% (4)   39.1% (5)\nGay and Lesbian Christians                            57.0% (1)   49.7% \n(2)  14.2% (3)     22.9% (4)    57.5% (5)\nGay and Lesbian non-Christians                     78.1%  (1)   74.1% (2)  \n26.9% (3)    18.5% (4)    71.7% (5)\nPopulation Avg                                                31.4%  (1)   \n43.0% (2)   7.5% (3)      26.9% (4)    37.8% (5)\n\nThere is more to sexual and relationship morality than just these five \nitems, to be sure, but they do offer us a glimpse into how people perceive \nvarious practices and relationships.\n\nOn Abortion rights views:\nIn comparison to churchgoing Christians who oppose SSM, Gay and lesbian \nnon-Christians\u2019 support for abortion is almost 11 times higher, Churchgoing \nChristians supporting SSM is 6 times higher, and gay and lesbian Christians \nis more than 8 times.\n\nOn Pornography views:\nIn comparison to churchgoing Christians who oppose SSM, Gay and lesbian \nnon-Christians support for pornography is 17 times higher, churchgoing \nChristians supporting SSM is 7 times higher, gay and lesbian Christians is \nmore than 12 times higher.\n\nOn Support for marital infidelity (sometimes):\nIn comparison to churchgoing Christians who oppose SSM, gay and lesbians \nnon-Christians support for adultery is 20 times higher, churchgoing \nChristians supporting SSM is almost 6 times higher, gay and lesbian \nChristians is almost 11 times higher.\n\nOn Fornification (pre-marital cohabitation):\nIn comparison to churchgoing Christians who oppose SSM, gay and lesbians \nnon-Christians support for fornification is almost 7 times  higher, \nchurchgoing Christians supporting SSM is 3 times higher, gay and lesbian \nChristians is 4 times higher.\n\nOn support for divorce (for marriages with kids for reasons other than \nabuse):\nIn comparison to churchgoing Christians who oppose SSM, gay and lesbians \nnon-Christians support for divorce is almost 3 times  higher, churchgoing \nChristians supporting SSM is 1.5 times higher, gay and lesbian Christians \nis more than 2 times higher.\n\nWe can the pattern here \u2013 that groups that support SSM are much more open \nto what I call various sinful behavior and moral decadency which is \nespecially striking with the liberal views on pornography, adultery and \nabortion.\n\nIn my view this is what Paul calls \u201cminds which were darkened\u201d in Rom 1:21 \n\u2013 Persistence in sin has damaging effects on the human faculties: the mind \ngradually darkens to a point of intellectual blindness, and the heart \ngradually hardens and grows cold to the love and laws of God (Eph 4:17).\ufeff",

A belief in \na supernatural deity came about because early humans did not have the \nknowledge of the world around them to understand nature. Remember, they \nused to believe the sun moved while the earth didn't. We know that to be \nfalse because we've been into space and seen it with our own eyes.\n\nSecondly, you are presuming that humans are the end point when you say they \nare \"elevated so much than any other thing.\" There are many other lifeforms \non this planet that are nearly as intelligent as humans are, with the \nability to create and use tools, and communicate with other members of \ntheir own kind (some of them can even communicate with us when they learn \nto do so, ie. a gorilla that has been taught sign language).\n\nThirdly, humans haven't always been the highest-order animal on the planet. \nDinosaurs once held that position. It's likely that millions of years from \nnow, humans won't exist. Another creature may surpass us on the \nevolutionary scale.\n\nFourthly, evolution doesn't happen at a constant speed for every organism. \nFor some creatures, it can move faster than for others. Humans evolved more \nquickly than gorillas because we migrated further away from our original \ngeographic location and adapted to those environments, thereby \n\"fast-tracking\" us in a sense.\n\nFifthly, if you're so big on DEFINITIVE proof, then why do you believe in a \ngod? It seems illogical to me that you would believe in a supernatural \nentity such as \"god\" when there's no proof that such a thing exists either.",

I don't know, maybe they did some prostate \nstimulation or something. \n\nOr, what if they just held hands and enjoyed being with each other in an \nintimate, non sexual way?  The way that I hold my wife's hand, or the way I \nrub her feet.  What if they just lay together in bed in the morning when \nthe alarm is going off to a song that they heard when they were first \ndating?  Do you ever have that moment?  Why should they be condemned and \njudged by our law, or by anyone for any reason? \n\nYou have the right to tell them that they are wrong in their love?

Whatever \ngets your attention gets you.\n\nHaving said that, where people go wrong with religion is when their \nreligious traditions and beliefs become blind; when they lose touch with \nthe main focus of their religion - God, if you will. They become confused \nwith man-made laws and traditions that often take away an individual's \nability to exercise his free will. Jesus, for example, always invited \npeople to follow Him. He did not force anyone.\n\nHowever, later when Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the \nreligion of the Roman Empire, everyone was forced to become Christian or be \nput to death. That was not Christ's intention. Today, we have religious \nfundamentalists who tell people that they are going to burn in hell if they \ndon't follow Jesus. \n\nThere is the old saying, 'A man forced to change his mind against his will, \nis of the same opinion still.'",

A study of rats showed that \nthe dominant male will allow subordinate males to mount him but will kill \nany that tried to mount a female.\n\nIt has been found that only 10% of human males are 100% heterosexual.

The Church actually encouraged schoolars to do their \njobs. Though the accumulated knowledge never made it to public, because of \nthe highly elitism of the Church. This knowledge was jealously guarded. \nOnly selected parts, such as architecture and craftsmanship were outwards \nsigns that there was some progress in knowledge. That's where the Free \nMasons come from.\nThose schoolars, usually found in monasteries, where set out to show god's \nglory through exploring his creation. Galileo Galilei himself was a devout \nchristian. He never intended to oppose the catholic churche the way it is \nbelived to be today. When he proposed to Pope Urban  VIII. (who by the way \nwas an avid mathematician and was actually ready to listen to Galilei \nbefore he was appointed as Pope), that the aristotelian/ptolemaic \ngeocentric epistime was fautly and should be replaced by the heliocentric \nepistime, he didn't mean that the scripture was wrong, but that it was \nfailiure on men's part to recognize the reality. But we all know how that \nstory ended. It ended that way, because there was some power hungry \ninquisitor, who was just too fanatic in his ways.\nEven *Sir Isaac Newton* himself, the man who recognized the force of \ngravitation, never saw himself as a secular \"scientist\", but rather as \nsomeone who, through his work could be able to convince people of god's \nglory. He was a philosopher. And back in the day philosopher, by proxy also \nment scientist.\n\nAnd by the way, when the crusaders brought more of the ancient knowledge \nback to Western europe, almost everything was written in arabic. Even the \nstuff that was \"saved\" from the Ottoman \"onslaught\" was mostly written in \narabic. Heck, the Byzantine Empire was only able to bloom (until the pest \ncame) partly because of the input of muslim schoolars. Back in those days, \nIslam acutally was just as highly welcoming of science and philosophy as \nthe Catholic Churche was. Both saw science and philosphy as means to \ndisplay god's glory through exploring his creation.\nAs for Medicine, even before the Renaissance, hippocratic and galenic \nmedicine was in use, and we both know, that Hippocrates of Kos and Claudius \nGalenus of Pergamon were far ahead of their time in terms of medical \nprocedure.",

Literacy and learning was only widespread among the clergy and \nknowledge in pretty every area(save for theological discourse and church \narchitecture) stagnated or was lost completely. Imagine how many documents \nand histories from the classical age were lost after the fall of the \nWestern Roman Empire?\n\nThe fact that Renaissance could only really start once the eastern Romans \nbegan fleeing the Ottoman onslaught with the recorded knowledge of the \nEastern Empire should tell you how much was lost to the West as it \ndescended into feudal ignorance. \n\nIn terms of medicine, government and law, engineering and architecture, \nmilitary capability and organization, philosophical discourse, and even the \nstandards of living, the roman world of Trajan outpaced the best of Feudal \nEurope.

Of course, political safeguards have and \nshould be insured to protect minorities against the whims of the majority. \nBut does this automatically entail that we invariably have to espouse \nthe views of the few because it is supposedly the right thing to do? In \nthis regard, as David Letterman would like us to think, we are not talking \nhere about the scourge of slavery where the whip, torture and segregation \nwere the order of the day. We are talking about a rather new \nphenomenon that encroaches on the deep seated values of family life and \nreligion from which this country benefited so much and even bloomed.\n\nI fully realize that those views, all conservative they may sound, might \nnot appeal to the more liberal voices. To abdicate them however, even so \nslightly, would only signify that they always were retrograde and thus all \nthe more disposable.

Second of \nall, everyone is free to feel accepted and loved which you apparently \npreach through your arbitrary jesus accept you feel as though it is alright \nto insult a completely natural, normal, and acceptable group of people \n(homosexuals) and damn them to \"hell\" ( another arbitrary place that many \nreligions seem so keen to convince people to do their bidding with the use \nof threats.) Now, I am not saying that Jesus, Hell, Heaven, or any other \nreligious aspect is real or fake because that would be just as closed \nminded as the people (you included) who arrogantly tell people what they \nshould or should not believe and how they should live their lives. Now if I \ndo remember, I also clearly remember the bible stating that a women who \ndefends herself from her husband will get her hand cut off, if your \nbrother's wife dies you should have sex with his wife, people who have \ndisabilities or imperfections cannot go to heaven, women must cover their \nhair while praying, nobody of bastard birth is allowed to enter church, as \nwell men with wounded penises are also not allowed to enter church. Now \nbefore I finish, I attended church for 13 years so don't try to act like \nI'm some misinformed twat trying to troll you. While attending church all I \nlearned was that a) a multitude of the beliefs are close minded and \nprejudice, b) a person who attends church or prayed to jesus or god was no \nbetter than a person who did not, and c) religion should not blind, or \ndirect one's views on real life situations.

It is simply a \nvaguely defined standard that is impossible to attain and used solely to \ncriticize others, both Christian and non Christian alike.\nIt is also one piss poor endorsement, either self proclaimed or in \ndescribing someone else. If anyone ever called me a \"true Christian\", I \nwould immediately examine my life to see where I went wrong.\nAs for the tenet of being born again, it did not exist prior to 1760ish, as \nit was/is a so called \"revealed truth\" first preached by John Wesley.\nSo effectively you have pinned your hopes for salvation and eternal life on \na biblical interpretation that first appeared nearly 18 centuries after the \ndeath of your religion's central icon. That reality should be absurd enough \nfor anyone with any intelligence to figure out that the tenet itself is \ncompletely fabricated by man.",

Faggotry is sure \nabnormal to the normal way of life, nature does not understand it either. \nSince you came from a woman via a seed from a man, what makes you think \nnature understands faggotry?

                    "text": "+roxfoot\u200b what is the requirement to be a Christian then? Well, for me in \nmy humble opinion, and just in my logic, a Christian is a person who \nbelieve in Jesus Christ as their savior and recognize the bible as the \nguide of God. \nAccording to the dictionary, \"Chris\u00b7tian\n\u02c8krisCH\u0259n/\nadjective\nadjective: Christian\n1.\nof, relating to, or professing Christianity or its teachings.\n\"the Christian Church\"\ninformal\nhaving or showing qualities associated with Christians, especially those of \ndecency, kindness, and fairness.\nnoun\nnoun: Christian; plural noun: Christians\n1.\na person who has received Christian baptism or is a believer in Jesus \nChrist and his teachings.\"\nAs a result, both Catholics and Mormons fall into that category, and so do \nProtestants, Adventists, and even Jehovah's witnesses. They all are based \non the same basic beliefs; they are not different enough to be excluded \nfrom Christianity because they all, even though have additions and cuts \nfrom the Bible, are called Christians. It is a different story with Muslims \nand Jews because even though they all come from the same root, they both \nhave an intrinsic difference.\nIf we think of how are true Christians supposed to be (following all the \nlittle laws from the bible) we would be left with an entire contradiction: \nA person who doesn't know if he should be polygamous or not since king \nDavid had a huge number of wives and concubine (and God was okay with that) \nor to be monogamous, since in the new testament, adultery is punished with \ndeath. He wouldn't know better if killing and slaving people is all right \nor not since it was okay to do so in the name of God in the old testament, \nbut Jesus told us all to love the prodigal the same way you love yourself. \nHe wouldn't even be able to know wether to judge or not since Jesus told \nhimself the only one able to judge was his father, but he did judge people \nhimself.

Got it?\n\nThe punishment is very clear.  It says that the girl will be stoned to \ndeath with her rapist\n\u202623\"If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man \nfinds her in the city and lies with her, 24then you shall bring them both \nout to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death; the girl, \nbecause she did not cry out in the city, and the man, because he has \nviolated his neighbor's wife. Thus you shall purge the evil from among you. \n25\"But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged, and the man \nforces her and lies with her, then only the man who lies with her shall \ndie.\u2026",

I admit that Jesus rebukes \nthe woman who puts away her husband (Mark 10v12), but he does not rebuke \nthe woman whose husband put her away. The action \u201cput away\u201d refers to any \noffense of ours that causes our spouse to be separated from us (filing for \ndivorce is a separate action from putting away).\n\nRegarding the unwed mother, she is partly to blame because she was foolish; \nbut the father is mostly to blame, because he impregnated her against her \nwill. Marriage is how a woman certifies that it is her will to be \nimpregnated by a man. So, if she is not the man's wife, then the man has to \nassume that it is not her will to be impregnated by him.",

For instance \"Sex and homosexual\" \nand woot you got some juicy stuff about Jesus sexually and I quote \"Even \nthough the Bible has numerous references to homosexual activity, many \nChristians believe that God hates fags (See http://godhatesfags.com/). Of \ncourse they often ignore the fact that Jesus participated in what could \nonly be called \"man-boy love\" and one of God's most favored men, King \nDavid, was a \"flaming fag\" himself. We at the Luciferian Liberation Front \nallow all men the liberty to pursue their own rational self interest in the \nmanner which is natural for them. We believe that homosexuality is not so \nmuch a life-style choice as it is a natural genetic mutation. As such, \nhomosexuals should be allowed to live their lives in the manner which is \nnatural for them, so long as they harm no one. If God hates fags, then he \nnever should have made the potential for genetic diversity. Christians are \nafraid to learn that homosexuality is due to genetics because that makes it \nGod's fault. Ask the next one you see why God makes Down's Syndrome \nchildren or any other genetic mutation, and they'll duck and dodge, falling \nback behind the curtain of \"the mysteries of God.\"\nThe biblically famous David had a homosexual relationship with King Saul's \nson, Jonathan. When they first met, they became \"soulmates\" in an encounter \nbest described as \"love at first site\" (1 Samuel 18:1-5). Jonathon loved \nDavid even more than his own father, putting himself in harm's way to \nprotect the life of his lover, David (1 Samuel 19:1-7). King Saul became \njealous of David and was determined to kill him. This made Jonathan so \nupset that he couldn't eat. Jonathan then snuck off to a field to lay with \nDavid, holding him in his arms, kissing and weeping like the lovesick \ncouple they were (1 Samuel 20:31-42). When Jonathan's father, King Saul, \nfound out about the homosexual affair, he confronted Jonathan with the fact \nthat he knew that he was gay and then he blamed it on Jonathan's mother, \ncalling her \"perverse\" and \"rebellious\" (1 Samuel 20:30). Later when \nJonathan died, David admited that [Jonathan's] \"love to me was wonderful, \npassing the love of women.\" (2 Samuel 1:25-26)\nThe Bible claims that homosexuality was a punishment which God gave to \nthose who worshipped idols or commited other forms of blasphemy. (Romans \n1:18-27).\nIndeed the Bible is full of anti-homosexual laws, claiming that homosexuals \nare in the same class as thieves and murderers (1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 \nTimothy 1:8-11, Leviticus 18:22, 20:13).\nThe Bible even condems cross-dressing, calling transvestites an \nabomination! (Deuteronomy 22:5)\nJesus' homosexual activity has been demonstrated in modern theater and \ncinema and can be traced to actual biblical passages. From the modern \nChristian model, we can assume that Jesus loved all of his disciples, yet \nthe Bible specifically describes one disciple as \"the disciple that Jesus \nloved\" (John 19:26, 20:2, 21:7,20). This disciple is described as \"lying on \nJesus' breast\" at the last supper (John 13:23, 25). What Jesus did with \nthis specific disciple to earn him the title \"the disciple that Jesus \nloved\" can only be imagined but it's not too difficult to get a pretty \nclear picture seeing them snuggling with each other in public. Jesus \nhimself was a homo. This is further supported by scriptures which describe \nJesus displaying inappropriate behavior for a man to be showing to other \nmen, such as lust (Mark 10:21), suggesting that men should be kissing him \n(Luke 7:45), describing men sharing the same bed (Luke 17:34), etc.\nWhen Jesus was in the garden of Gethsemane, he left his disciples who were \nsleeping and went off, returning several times to check on them (Mark 14:37-41). \nWhen Jesus came back after the third time, there was a young man following \nhim with only a linen cloth wrapped around his naked body. When the guards \ntried to grab the young man after grabbing Jesus, the young man dropped the \ncloth and ran off naked (Mark 14:51-52). Who was this scantily clad young \nstreaker and why was he returning with Jesus? What had Jesus REALLY been \ndoing with a naked young man that night in the garden? The \"Secret Gospel \nof Mark\", known from early Church father, Clement of Alexandria's (150-230 \nC.E.) letter to Theodorus contains excerpts which include the following\n\"...the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him and began to beseech him \nthat he might be with him...they went into the house of the young man, for \nhe was rich. And the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him...and after six \ndays Jesus gave him an order; and when the evening had come, the young man \nwent to him, dressed with a linen cloth over his naked body. And he \nremained with him that night, because Jesus taught him the mystery of the \nkingdom of God.\"(Secret Gospel of Mark).\nWhat exactly is this \"mystery\" of the kingdom of God that Jesus spent all \nnight showing the scantily clad young man? This very suggestive passage was \ninserted in the canon of the orthodox Alexandrian Church of Egypt. Some \nscholars say that it should be inserted in our modern Bible after Mark 10:34. \nThe naked man incident is always left out of Easter pagents for some \nstrange reason.\"\n\nMore sex stuff here found within the Bible :D\nsource: http://www.luciferianliberationfront.org/sexbible.html#homosex",
