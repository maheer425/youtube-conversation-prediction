                "text": "omg the thing about birth control is so true. I started getting really bad \ncramps so i talked to my school nurse about it and she said it might be a \ngood idea to get the pills. I talked to my dad, who is french canadian \nabout it and he's like why not, basically half of the teenage girls in \nnorth america are on it, if it means you arent going to be in pain, go for \nit. Now when i brought this subject up with my mom, who is full korean she \ngot so angry and was like no, thats dangerous, your going to be infertile, \nits not natural, you could ruin your body. I think that because sexuality \nis such a sensitive subject in korea and that they dont really even have a \nmodernized sex ed program, they arent fully informed about everything, and \nalso its very traditional. Either way, im pissed because i didnt end up \ngetting my pills -.-\ufeff",
