And in most Red States where they have \n\"Right to Work\" laws that allow corporations to exploit salary loopholes by \nforcing their employees to put in extreme hours without overtime pay. With \nthe at least one day off every seven days, there is established by law a \nreason for work week scheduling that would otherwise not exist.

                "text": "I love Cenk and I love TYT, but I do have to acknowledge that Cenk is \nblinded by Obama hate and it makes him do things like lie to his audience. \nCenk is smart enough to know these things:\n\n(1) Obama has been pivotal at protecting programs that are essential to the \nsurvival of the middle class, specifically Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, unemployment insurance, food stamps, and child welfare programs. \nIf McCain had been elected in 2008, all of those programs would have been \neliminated or gutted.\n\n(2) Obamacare has extended heath care to 11 million and counting, and \nextended Medicaid to many millions more. Obamacare has also strengthened \nand improved healthcare for all the people who already had health insurance \nwith new regulations that protect the public.\n\n(3) Any failure on Obama's part to do more is directly attributable to the \nfact that the Republicans made a conscious, deliberate decision on DAY ONE \nof Obama's presidency that they would obstruct *everything* he tried to do \nas president, and would prevent any economic recovery that would boost \nObama's popularity, make a 2nd Obama term more likely, or contribute to his \npost-presidential legacy. To put it bluntly, Republicans declared war on \nthe president and the American people since 2008.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I know there are a lot of truly ignorant people in \nthis world. I am constantly running into people who don't know any of the \nabove. But Cenk isn't one of those people. Cenk is very aware that no \nmatter what Obama wanted to do, he would be blocked by Republicans and \ntheir control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nSo how come Cenk constantly ignores this fact in his bashing of the \npresident? How come he pretends, day after day, that Obama could accomplish \n*anything* on the legislative front than he has?\n\nI honestly don't know. I can't think of any good reason why Cenk would lie \nlike this to his audience. If I had to guess I would say he does it because \nhe wants to expand his audience to include as many Obama-haters as he can. \nMaybe he figures that's his most promising business plan. If that's the \ncase, it's cynical and dishonest, but at least it makes sense in an \nimmoral, mercenary kind of way.\ufeff",

You oversell it.  While a marginal improvement, the ACA is a giant \ngiveaway to big insurance, a bill riddled with loopholes ready and waiting \nto be exploited.  There's very little measure if any to control the costs \nof drugs and services rendered, no punishments for the insurance companies \nthat are directly responsible for the deaths of too many to count.
