                    "text": "+94Newbie No. Humans breathe more than fish.\n\nThe average human breathes about 500mls of air per breath as their standard \ntidal volume\nOf that 500 mls, 21% is oxygen going in, and 16% is oxygen coming out, \nmeaning that we strip about 5% of the volume of every breath as pure \noxygen, or about 25mls (0.025 liters)\nUsing Avagadro\u2019s Law (1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters) we see:\nV1/n1 = V2/n2 \u2013> 22.4L/1mol = 0.025L/Xmol \u2013> X = 0.00111mol.  Each breath \nconsumes 0.00111 moles of oxygen gas\nFrom the molar weight of di-molecular oxygen gas (16g x 2 = 32g/mol), we \ncan calculate that each breath is:\n32g * 0.00111mol = 0.03552g of oxygen, or 35.52 milligrams (mg)\nNow, well-oxygenated surface ocean waters (on Earth of course, I have no \nidea about Naboo) contain about 6mg/L of oxygen.\nSo, to supply one breath\u2019s worth of oxygen, the Triton would need to filter \n35.52mg/6mgL = 5.92L of water.  Let\u2019s call it 6L for convenience.  And it \nwould need to do so with 100% extraction efficiency, which is not realistic \nunder any diffusion or adsorption scenario, but let\u2019s give Mr Yeon the \nbenefit of the doubt.\nThe average person breathes around 15 times per minute at rest.  Lets \nassume we\u2019re diving in a restful fashion, and not chasing Gungans into the \nunderwaterways to escape Colo Clawfish\nTherefore, to supply you with oxygen at normal resting breathing rates, the \nTriton would need to filter 15 x 6L = 90L per minute, or about 24 gallons. \n For scale, 25 gallons a minute is about as much as a 1/4 horsepower sump \npump pushes out, depending on static head. Without any kind of pump in the \nTriton to move water through the device, it relies on swimming (and \npresumably breathe suction?) to create the flow of water.  There\u2019s too many \nvariables in that, but let\u2019s just say you\u2019d certainly have to swim so fast \nto supply the needs of 15bpm that you wouldn\u2019t be breathing 15bpm anymore.",

I'm going to explain \nit along the way.\n\nFirst off, I can see a very long series of 30's and 31's, followed by an \noccasional 20 every 8 iterations. This tells me that these are all \nhexadecimal representations of 0, 1, and \" \", respectively.\n\nSo I plugged it into vim and issued a few regexes to convert it into \nsomething easier to work with. I started with\n\n30 30 31 31 30 31 30 30 20 30 31 31 30 30 30 31 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 \n30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 30 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 \n30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 30 31 20 30 30 31 \n30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 31 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 30 30 20 30 \n30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 30 30 20 30 31 31 30 30 30 31 30 \n20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 \n30 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 31 20 30 30 31 31 \n31 30 30 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 30 31 30 20 30 30 \n31 31 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 30 20 \n30 30 31 31 30 31 31 30 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 \n31 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 30 30 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 \n31 31 31 20 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20 30 30 31 \n31 30 30 31 30 20 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 31 20 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 20\ufeff\n<feff>\n\n\nThe <feff> is a weird control character that YouTube inserted, recognized \nby vim.\n\nAnd after using the following regexes\n\n:1s/3//g\n--removes all 3's from 30's and 31's\n:1s/20/^M/g\n--turns all \"spaces\" into newlines\n:$d\n--deletes the last line, and thus the <feff>\n:%s/ //g\n--deletes all spaces\n:%s/\\(....\\)/\\1 /\n--inserts a space after the first four letters of each line\n\nended up with:\n\n0011 0100\n0110 0011\n0010 0000\n0011 0110\n0011 0101\n0010 0000\n0011 0110\n0011 0101\n0010 0000\n0011 0111\n0011 0100\n0010 0000\n0011 0100\n0110 0010\n0010 0000\n0011 0110\n0011 0101\n0010 0000\n0011 0111\n0011 1001\n0010 0000\n0011 0010\n0011 0000\n0010 0000\n0011 0110\n0011 0110\n0010 0000\n0011 0111\n0011 0100\n0010 0000\n0011 0111\n0011 0111\n0010 0000\n0011 0010\n0011 0001\n0010 0000\n\nNotes:\n\n^M is vim's representation of the carriage return character, or ASCII #13 \n(or 0D).

                    "text": "+Kyle Duncan It's not just the fear of them overcoming us. Its the fear \nthat humanity has created another similar form of us, to include in our day \nto day lives. We form their faces like us, and use them to help us with day \nto day tasks, to create an illusion of empathy and technological \ncompanionship. Many believe that a humans brain is computational, and this \nbelief causes the ambition to create robots that can be sentient. The \nproblem with this awe inspiring advantage that humans may or may not create \nis either going to be the abuse control we'll have on the robots or a shift \nin what we'd call real companionship. Like most technology nowadays, we \nhave already dissuaded from genuine congregation to a form of social \ninteraction that the internet easily creates for us. Though us individuals \nare fully in control of these creations, as a society, we fail to control \nanything. If robots are compatible enough to be scattered throughout the \nsocial interaction of humans, we will no longer be using them to our own \ndisabilities, rather they will have us at a surprise to help us when they \nseek fit. That's the whole point of social interaction, to have s society \nthat is run with the help of robots. Not everyone will understand this and \nnot everyone will see a problem with it. With whomever is in charge of that \nrobot, or those robots, they are certainly aiming to change society in how \nwe think and what we can do for ourselves. To think that we can replace any \nhuman with a programmed robot that has no understanding or human-like \nprecision is sickening. We need other humans, to be loved and nurtured. If \nwe ever do create the shitty robots that iRobot had before the nice looking \nwhite ones, it is because we have seemingly destroyed all human value and \nonly cared about how society functions and works. Humanity then becomes a \nsystem. You may say that this is freedom, that we can do more of what we \nwant because the robots are doing our job for us. But you are missing the \npoint, that if we ever did create robots of that capability, we would no \nlonger seek value in what we'd call a natural meditation, for lack of a \nbetter word. But, society is already a system, you may ask. That is true, \nhowever we ourselves make the decision with the use of human-like emotion, \neons away from what any robot would be able to have. ",

We can program a robot to show \nsadness in a situation, but that isn't emotions. Until we are able to \nprogram emotions and free will, robots will never overthrow us or go rogue \nlike in I Robot.",
