The \nsimilarities I mention are to do with North Korea's perception of the Kims. \nThat is to say, they see them as gods in all but name.\nFor my part, I enjoy the discussion of philosophy, history and theology. \nAnd I see no point in only talking to people who agree with me because then \nmy understanding of the subjects do not grow. And while I'm sure I could be \naccused of being pushy, I attempt to only be pushy toward the type of \npeople you mention, (the xenophobes, the bigots, those who use their \nreligion as an excuse to promote hatred).\nBut you obviously aren't that sort of person. And I'd like to think I'm \n'grown up' enough to accept that we have a difference of opinion regarding \nthe 'grand' nature of the universe, and instead focus on the far \nmore pertinent subject of human nature. And on that subject, I think we \nboth recognise that power hungry tyrants have used the same techniques over \nand over again to control populations, whether in the guise of religion or \npolitics. And like suckers, we fall for it every damn time. My question is, \nwill we ever learn? Here's hoping.    ",

Humanity always leans towards extremism rather \nthan the moderate path. If you think about it; Christianity, Islam, \nBuddhism, socialism etc. were all ideologies created to eliminate human \nhatred and suffering. But even as a christian I will admit that \nChristianity (as with all of the above) largely failed. It brought some \ngood things, but in a true Christian world there would be little value for \nmoney, because Christians should give to the poor, give to the neighbor and \nto expect nothing back, and to see everyone as equals. But most \nconservatives, with their obsession with materialism, interest and \nxenophobia, are complete opposites of this.\n\nThe reason I'm still religious is both practical and spiritual. I have \ngreat respect for conservative thoughts like traditional family and I \nbelieve that Christianity sanctions these ideas, hopefully for my children \nas well. As for the logical belief, I have argued with atheists about God \nin length, but do not anymore. I look at things philosophically, life, and \nin particular my existence, has always been grand and mysterious to me, \nscientific explanations just don't do it.\n\nI don't classify people based on their religion or lack thereof.

One of his father's titles was \"The Sun \nShines Out His Arse\", or some such nonsense.\nAnd 2) While many of Jesus' teachings were good, (forgiveness, altruism, \ncharity), these aspects weren't ground breaking. If these concepts were \nentirely foreign to the human race, we'd have killed each other off long \nbefore Jesus was born. Meanwhile, the core tenet of Christianity, vicarious \nredemption, I personally find to be morally repugnant.

I am, in a sense, anti-theist, but I also \nrecognise that theism, in-and-of-itself, is not the problem. It's the \ninfuriating aspect of  human nature to group-think and idolatrise just \nabout anything. And it is that aspect that has allowed North Korea to take \nthe shape it has. It took root in all those communist countries you \nmentioned. It has, at least in part, kept the Middle-East in conflict for \nmillennia. And, to your point, there is even an atheist group in America, \ncalled Atheism Plus, that behaves no differently to a cult (exclusion, \ndemonization, idolatry) all the while believing it's the answer to all the \nworld's problems.\nFor me, it's a catch 22 situation. As an individual, I can't affect or \npromote any change to the way humanity, as a whole, thinks, even on a small \nscale. But I immediately distrust any organisation that, even on the \nsurface, holds the principles that I hold.

A country like Iran, if \nit would properly practice the religion it adheres to, would guarantee \nfreedom of religion like some early muslim empires did.\n\nIt appears to be a stupid cult from the outside.

Korea was divided because Soviet troops landed in \nthe North not long after their invasion of Manchuria.\n\nYou could just as easily say the Soviets wanted the division because they \nwanted to support the Stalinist government of Kim Il-Sung. Or you could say \nthe peninsula was divided because the West didn't what the Soviets to \nspread their sphere of influence any more than they already had. But NOOOO, \nthat kind of objectivity would be against your anti-American world view.\n\nNo, I think you will find that the North UNILATERALLY started the war.\n\nThe Soviets aided Kim Il-Sung in his planning of the invasion. Kim invaded \nthe South, on the PERMISSION of Stalin.\n\nThe KPA was the FIRST to cross the 38th Parallel into South Korean lands. \nThe war was NORTHERN aggression.\n\nBut your anti-American world view blinds you to this simple fact. You are \nlike people who still think the Germans invaded Poland defensively. Or the \nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor was America's fault.",

North \nKorea also holds massive mineral resources and in general has great \npotential for economic development.  The incentives to gain control and \nopen up the borders are numerous, the only question is which super-power \nwill do it.\n Personally I think the U.S. should make full claim to North Korea, \ncreating it into a permanent state.  While this would give citizenship to \nNorth Koreans, it would also provide an equal opportunity to Americans in \nexisting states to relocate. This would give Americans a safe and long-term \nplace to invest within Asia to prosper through trade and development.  Many \nmay even choose to retire there or have hobby farms. It would also \neventually be extremely effective for U.S.'s favorite export of propaganda, \nbeing an \"Asian Hollywood\" for exporting American culture through movies \nand online content.  Even in an unorganized way, simple having American \nteenagers interacting more with Asian teens would be very positive to U.S. \ninterest. \nIf the U.S. fails to act, obviously China will make full claim and this \nwill eventually lead to some amount of conflict with South \nKorea/Japan/Taiwan.  The mineral wealth really needs to be used wisely and \nit would be a huge shame to see North Korea become polluted by badly \nregulated industry.  I'd much rather see a hyper-loop built between North \nand South Korea to encourage trade and progress in an environmentally \nresponsible fashion. It would be ideal for Chinese citizens to visit as \nwelcome guest, rather than to take control over Korea's future. \ufeff",

The \nU.S. if viewed as being comprised of various entities with self interest \nwithin the corporate/banking system, would desire to tax and \nmonitor/manipulate those businesses and individuals.
