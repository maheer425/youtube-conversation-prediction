It is not so much that pot \nitself is an essential liberty, but rather our right to choose what we \ningest and take the responsibility for it, assuming it is no detriment to \nothers, that ought to be an essential liberty. One which you would take \naway for the sake of security, a security which is clearly imaginary since \nnone of your points hold any legitimacy anyway. Such as the vapid \ninsinuation that people are safer concealing it illegally at home (*rolls \neyes* because people definitely don't smoke pot outside of home because \nit's illegal! Kids definitely don't do it at school, all the time...), and \nthen travelling to drug dealers who no doubt deal with a bunch of other \ndrugs, many of which are legitimately life destroying. Yes, that situation \npositively glows with security. \n\n\"alcohol is heavily regulated even though it's legal, is that giving up an \nessential liberty?\"\n\nIt is technically sacrificing some degree of freedom, but not nearly to the \nsame extent as having alcohol banned altogether, no? And those regulations \nare to prevent cases where the harm it causes is incontrovertible, like \nletting people drink & drive... no one can argue that isn't going to result \nin accidents. By contrast your arguments about pot causing harm seem \ninsipid & uninspired.\n\nAlso the claim that pot has no health benefits is demonstrably a load of \nshit. You do know many thousands of people have permits to use marijuana \nfor medicinal purposes, right? It's been used for thousands of years that \nway too. \n\nYou seem like you're arguing against a strawman though - I never once \nimplied Marijuana should be completely unregulated & that people should be \nable to smoke it in bars and then drive home, or anything remotely similar.

If you ever try to tell me pot use is an \"essential liberty\" \nup there with freedom of speech and the right to vote, you're a massive \nidiot. To point out the fallacy of your quote to you as well: alcohol is \nheavily regulated even though it's legal, is that giving up an essential \nliberty?\n\nI couldn't care less if both liquor and cigarettes were outlawed. I don't \nuse either. So your 'hypocrisy' argument can suck it. Problem is alcohol \nhas become so ingrained in modern society that as soon as you try to outlaw \nit people will immediately turn to criminal means to obtain it. No matter \nhow prevalent marijuana use is, it certainly doesn't rival alcohol yet. And \nbecause it doesn't actually have any health benefits, why legalise it? A \nlot of problems we have with cigarettes and alcohol abuse now would have \nbeen lessened had they never been legalised, but here we go taking the same \nroute with pot.\n\nI'm not worried about everyone in society turning into pot users either, \nthat's not going to happen. Most people will just not use it cause they \ndon't want to. But with legalisation comes a change in its accepted use in \nsociety. While pot is unlawful at least people have to be careful about \nwhere they smoke it, and arguably that prevents them from putting \nthemselves in more dangerous situations (like driving to a bar, getting \nstoned, then driving home).\n\nFinally, I don't think you should hold everyone's hand in life either. Let \nstupid people make stupid decisions that put themselves at risk. But \nletting people go out into the world (rather than their own homes) to get \nstoned and then interact with others while they're in an altered state of \nconsciousness is a recipe for disaster in terms of other people getting \nhurt. There's enough to look out for already, why make the list of accepted \nbut damaging public behaviours longer?\n\nAnd to Delta9: I'm no moron. If you can't bear to hear another side \ndifferent to the stance you're vehemently loyal to, sit down and shut up.",

It is not the governments \nresponsibility to stop people making poor decisions. The only case in which \npot should be illegal, as is the case with alcohol & cigarettes, is when it \naffects others - for alcohol that is driving or for public disorder, for \ncigarettes there are bans on it in public places due to second hand smoke. \nSimilar stipulations for pot would be fine, including making it illegal to \nsmoke in public places (or obviously driving under its influence). Making \nit illegal, as it is now, to smoke in private at home is simply \nindefensible and your reasons don't apply to that at all. You want a \nblanket ban on something because some proportion of people are idiots. \nWell, I think you're just as dumb as they are if you really believe that's \na legitimate argument. \n\nI mean your entire argument rests upon the premise that a lot more people \nare going to get pot if it becomes legal, when the reality is that anyone \nwho is going to use it frequently or abuse it, almost certainly already has \naccess to it. Making it illegal doesn't stop people from doing it, it \nmerely makes them secretive and encourages criminal exploitation. \n\nMaybe a vendor will have to pay tax, but what stops people from growing pot \nthemselves if it's legal? Very little. Zero exploitation possible, criminal \nenterprises will vanish, govt will still earn plenty of money selling it to \nthose who aren't interested in growing it themselves, and if it is harmful \nto anyone it will be far less so than alcohol or tobacco. I've made the \nsame statement before I think, but again; anyone who argues that marijuana \nshould be illegal is engaging in illogical hypocrisy unless they're also \ncampaigning to have alcohol & tobacco banned. You cannot argue for one and \nignore the other without being a total hypocrite. ",

I have said over and over a billion times that we shouldn't smoke \npot OR drink alcohol! Alcohol is a drug! Just because it's legal doesn't \nmake it right! A casual booze drinker is no better than a casual pot \nsmoker, except they aren't breaking the law! I rant against alcohol all the \ntime, even more than pot! And it makes us all FURIOUS when you guys try to \ncompare pot and alcohol to cigarettes! That isn't the same at all! We don't \nget high or stoned or tipsy or drunk from cigarettes! Can't you see that? \nWhy do you people ALWAYS think that we are against pot because we think it \nis all dangerous and deadly? Nobody thinks that! Doesn't it even OCCUR to \nyou jerks that we are against it because it's a mind-altering drug?? Pot \nsmokers ADMIT to us all the time online that they use it to get high, \nstoned, buzzed, relax and unwind, have \"fun\", enjoy life, etc. We BELIEVE \nthem when they tell us why they use it and how it affects them! And that is \nwhy we are against it! That is what makes it wrong! We shouldn't use \nmind-altering drugs for these reasons! This is good morals and just plain \ncommon sense! And that includes alcohol! And of COURSE we shouldn't smoke \ncigarettes! That's a given! I have ranted against cigarettes for years! I \nwrote a long blog about the dangers of tobacco and how my dad died hooked \nup to an oxygen tank after years of smoking. I publish this every Father's \nDay on my blog and have mentioned it countless times here on YouTube! And I \nhave written tons of blogs, thousands of comments, even a BOOK about why we \nshouldn't smoke pot OR drink alcohol! Haven't you read a thing I have \nwritten? I thought I was so well known online! OH this makes me so mad. I \ntype my fingers to the bone for YEARS, thinking I have made a difference in \nthe world and that people finally understand, and then I come to YouTube \nand find all this. And then you wrote: \" I hop your father gets drunk, \nburns off your clitorus with a cigar then cracks open your skull with a \nvodka bottle. Kill yourself.\" OH BROTHER. And you expect us all to approve \nof pot smoking when you say things like this???\nThis is the entire reason I continue to speak up against pot, is because of \ncomments like yours. You guys all say the same things, always trying to \ncompare pot to cigarettes, and bringing up about how pot is safer than \nalcohol and cigarettes, and then so many of you say terrible, terrible \nthings. Look at what you said to me, telling me to kill myself, and all \nthat vulgar stuff about burning off my private parts with a cigar, etc. \nWHAT A THING TO SAY! How old are you? Where are your parents? Do they know \nyou are like this? I hope the police see your comment. I never even THOUGHT \nabout marijuana before all this. But boy have you guys opened my eyes! Now \nI realize that we all need to speak up against pot and that it should be \nillegal forever, with very stiff penalties! Not because of marijuana \nitself, but because of the people who use and defend it! Do we REALLY want \npeople like you walking around actually USING mind-altering drugs? HECK \nNO!!!",

I never even thought about pot before all this, \nand when I made one little comment on an old Yahoo story ten years ago, the \npot smokers all accused me of thinking that pot is harmful, and so I nicely \nexplained things to them, thinking SURELY they would understand, and that \nwould be the end of it! Well ten years and 10,000 comments later, I'm STILL \nexplaining this! It is just maddening! This makes me realize I have to \nstart making anti-pot VIDEOS to educate you guys and to prove my point \nabout why pot should be illegal forever. And seriously, all I would have to \ndo to prove my point is read comments like yours into the microphone.\n\nMy book is not for sale, it is just on a website, google The Cindybin \nProject and it should come up.",

But that makes it WORSE that they would have \nsmoked pot, because they of ALL people should have known better! Their \nparents would have killed them if they had found out, and they were lucky \nthey never got arrested! But using drugs was just an immature college thing \nthey did out of peer pressure. They all STOPPED, and went on to get good \njobs, raise families, and of course they taught their own kids to avoid \ndrugs and obey the law, too! CAN'T YOU SEE MY POINT??

That isn't the same at all! We don't get high or stoned or tipsy \nor drunk from cigarettes! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?? Of course we should not \nsmoke cigarettes! I have ranted against cigarettes for years online, too! I \ntype my fingers to the bone for years, and nobody here has read a thing I \nhave written! I have written hundreds and hundreds of comments against \ncigarettes, and I wrote a long blog about the dangers of tobacco and how my \ndad died hooked up to an oxygen tank after years of smoking! I publish this \non my blog every Father's Day! But have you read it? Of course not! And I \nhave said over and over how furious it makes us all when you pot smokers \ntry to compare things like CIGARETTES to pot! THAT ISN'T THE SAME AT ALL! \nWhy do you people ALWAYS accuse us of thinking that \"weed\" is dangerous and \naddictive like cigarettes? NOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to you \npeople that we are against it because it's a mind-altering drug?? Pot \nsmokers ADMIT to us all the time online that they use it to get high, \nstoned, buzzed, relax and unwind, have \"fun\", enjoy life, etc. We BELIEVE \nthem when they tell us why they use it and how it affects them! And that is \nwhy we are against it! That is what makes it wrong! We shouldn't use \nmind-altering drugs for these reasons! This is good morals and just plain \ncommon sense! CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?? We shouldn't use alcohol, either! \nI say the same things about alcohol! alcohol is a drug! Just because it's \nlegal doesn't make it right! People  need to grow up and set an example!! \nAnd pot is AGAINST THE LAW! If you get busted, you can get into serious \ntrouble! Kids need to remember this! It won't help to tell the judge that \npot is safer than cigarettes! And then you bring up about how \"weed\" is a \nMEDICINE??? AAARGGHHHHH! I have said over and over that I am NOT AGAINST \nMEDICAL MARIJUANA! I am a nice person and of course would not want anybody \nto suffer! I would use it myself if I had to, if it were legal for that and \nit helped! I have even been trying for YEARS to write an article on the \nBENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA! But I have yet to find a single decent \nperson to interview to use as an example in my article! All the casual \nusers rave about the medical benefits in order to justify getting high, and \neven the \"medical\" users I've talked to and seen online have been horrible, \ncussing me out, threatening me with death and bodily harm, attacking my \nreligion, making fun of me for collecting dolls, and of course they ALL \naccuse me of thinking that anybody who smokes pot is a stupid, lazy, good \nfor nothing bum, they all accuse me of thinking that marijuana is dangerous \nand deadly, etc. And the more I have tried to explain things to them, the \nworse they get! They are just HORRIBLE! After all this time, I have \ncollected THOUSANDS of comments and emails from \"medical\" users, supporters \nand growers who are just horrible. Now all I want to do is write articles \nand make videos using these comments, to show what people are like! Doctors \nand lawmakers need to know!! And then you tell me to focus on alcohol??? \nAARGGHHHHH! I RANT AGAINST ALCOHOL ALL THE TIME! EVEN MORE THAN POT!! I \nhave written thousands and thousands of comments against this, and tons of \nblogs, even a book about why we shouldn't smoke pot OR drink alcohol! \nHaven't you people read a thing I have written??? All I am saying is that \nwe shouldn't use mind-altering drugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, have \n\"fun\", etc. That is not what TRUE fun is! People need to grow up and set an \nexample!!! Why can't you people understand this???? Don't you have any \nmorals, values or common sense???? And then of course you just HAVE to use \nprofanity, don't you. You have to use the sh-word to be all cool and tough \nand prove you are a man. Oh this makes me so mad! I have ranted against \nprofanity for years online, too! Ever since we got the Internet and I found \nall these people swearing on it! Why do you have to talk like this? Do you \nthink it will make me see the light and realize it's okay to get high on \npot?? Where are your manners? Haven't you heard that a gentleman shouldn't \nswear in front of a lady? Be a gentleman! Do you swear like this in real \nlife? What type of woman would want to date or marry a guy who swears and \nsmokes pot? And I have said over and over that of course there are dangers \nto pills and prescription drugs! But that doesn't make it right to get high \non pot recreationally!!! And I have explained over and over that most \npeople are taking prescription drugs to treat an illness or condition they \ndon't want to have in the first place, not to get high and have \"fun\"! I AM \nJUST SAYING WE SHOULDN'T USE MIND-ALTERING DRUGS RECREATIONALLY! Can't you \nsee that??? And that includes alcohol, which is also a drug! And of course \nalcohol is dangerous and deadly! I rant about the health risks of alcohol \nall the time!!! And I always say that even if alcohol were good for you, \njust the fact that it is a mind-altering drug makes it wrong! I am just \ntrying to get people to THINK, to realize that there is a better way to \nlive, to GROW UP and not use mind-altering drugs to relax, unwind, have \n\"fun\", celebrate, socialize, etc. What a thing to do! Can't you understand \nthis???? And again, pot is ILLEGAL! If you get busted, it won't help to \ntell the judge \"weed\" is safer than alcohol! Kids need to realize this!!! ",

So in my \nexperience weed is a much better substance to use as medicine then any \nother prescription medication out there on the market!! Now what does that \ntell you??Good for you if you never needed any prescription medication to \ndeal with the abnormalities you were born with, some of us aren't so lucky \nand have found something that works better than lethal man made medicine \nthat actually has less negative side effects and wont kill you! Please stop \ngiving us a bad name like we have no other reason to do it except just to \nget high. Which btw is what people do do when they drink! But you don't see \nus bashing the people that drink unless they bash us first!! I know your \nbashing both alcohol and weed but why not focus on the one that is actually \nkilling people, has absolutely no medical benefits at all and is a \nsubstance actually taken only to just feel high/drunk!!! Your wasting your \ntime talking down on weed because its already apparently obvious to those \nwho smoke it that its not a bad thing to do (at least less harmful then \npills, alcohol and cigarettes)! Do yourself a big favor and just let the \nweed thing go. Trust me, it's not a battle your ever going to win and all \nyour doing is proving your own ignorance in every sentence you type!! \nLMAO!!! SMH... Ps. do you smoke cigarettes? If so, you have no room to say \nshit about weed!! If not, you still don't have room to say shit about weed \nbut at least your not a hypocrite! LOL",

You must be the 200th Internet \nJERK this week to tell me that if I haven't tried pot, I can't possibly \nspeak up against it! I have said over and over that you don't have to have \ntried pot to know that people use it to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax and \nunwind, have \"fun\", enjoy life, etc. Pot smokers ADMIT this to us all the \ntime online, and we BELIEVE them when they tell us why they use it and how \nit affects them! And that is why we are against it! That is what makes it \nwrong! We shouldn't use mind-altering drugs for these reasons! This is good \nmorals and just plain common sense! Can't you people understand this? Are \nyou that empty inside? So immoral and immature???? GROW UP! And pot is \nILLEGAL! You can get into trouble with the law if you get busted! How could \nI have ever tried pot?? Where would I even FIND this stuff? Nobody has EVER \noffered me pot or talked about it to me or anything! And I was a teen in \nthe 70s! Same for my husband! And we sure don't know anybody NOW who smokes \npot,. approves of it or knows where to find it! Even if we did, you think \nwe would risk getting busted? Heck no! And it is AGAINST MY RELIGION! If I \nsmoked pot I would have to drop out of my church! I'm a convert to the \nMormon church and we have The Word of Wisdom which we believe to be direct \nrevelation from God saying that alcohol, tea, coffee, cigarettes and \nmind-altering drugs like marijuana are not for the body. We are taught the \nmoral and physical reasons to avoid using these things. This HELPS us! It \nis GOOD to understand why we shouldn't use mind-altering drugs to have \n\"fun\". That is not what TRUE fun is! But I never smoked pot even BEFORE I \nhad religious beliefs! You had to be a totally different person to do such \na thing! Oh you people drive me insane! It is comments like yours that only \nmake me angrier and MORE determined to speak up against pot, because I see \nhow much you need my help and guidance! And one of the main reasons I \ncontinue to speak up against pot is because of all the IDIOTS like you who \nhonestly think that if I haven't tried pot, I can't possibly speak up \nagainst it. OH BROTHER. Again, THIS is why I continue to speak up against \npot. To EDUCATE you guys! YOu just don't get it! And what really upsets me \nis that I have addressed this SO MANY TIMES! This must be the 200th time \njust this month that I have typed all this out. I am just sitting here \ncrying, I have so much to do around the house, and instead I sit here and \ntype and type and type, saying the same things I have said countless times \nthe past ten years. Every comment I make, I think it will be the LAST ONE, \nthat surely you guys will understand, and I will never have to reply to \nanyone again. But you all say the exact same things over and over! YOu are \ndriving me insane! I can't keep up with this! I feel like I'm going to have \na nervous breakdown! I have no life anymore, I am so busy typing the same \nthings to you people! For the billionth time, you do NOT have to have used \nmarijuana to speak up against it!! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?? All I am saying is \nthat we shouldn't use mind-altering drugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, \nrelax and unwind, have \"fun\", etc. This is good morals and just plain \ncommon sense! I say the same things against alcohol! Alcohol is a drug! \nJust because it's legal doesn't make it right! So I suppose you are a pot \nsmoker, right? It figures! After ranting for TEN YEARS online about why we \nshouldn't smoke pot, and I STILL find people like you online. iT IS JUST \nMADDENING! HOw old are you? Where are your parents? Do they know about your \nattitude? Where do you even FIND pot? Who are you that you're above the \nlaw??? YOu should be ashamed of yourself. ",
