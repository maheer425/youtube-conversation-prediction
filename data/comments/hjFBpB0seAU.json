I'm considering a character underdeveloped when the options \ndealing with them is less straightforward than either please them or... I \nwas really impressed by Chief Hanlon and Caesar's conversations, also \narguing with Col. Moore was an interesting moment. Even not fully sketched \ncharacters can be effective... Bitter Root, Dr. Hildren, Orion Moreno, Ada \nStrauss... I can count more minor characters with more impact on the game \nthat those tree supposed \"major\" characters. All in all, I suspect they \nwere very much helped by \"out-of-game\" talks, more than their actual role \n\"inside-the-game\". My opinion, of course. Cheers!",

I'm sure he is dead \nand I will never see him in the next series of the game :(\n\nI think It will be nice if we can meet more tribal characters too teach \nthem how to use advanced weapons and armors during the game play and be \nyour companions with some funny dialogues and reactions when they will see \nsomething new for the first time. \n\nI loose that feeling in the Fallout 3 that we are more like tribal society \nnow and you need to discover advanced technology. Everybody has weapons and \narmors i think it will be very difficult to find materials to build them \nespecial the bullets and you know factories don't work anymore. But it is \nmy way of thinking ... still love Fallout 3. I still remember 1999 when my \nbrother install Fallout 1 for the first time it is the game you can play \nover and over again and still discovering new stuff and things you didn't \nspot the first 100 plays trough the game.
