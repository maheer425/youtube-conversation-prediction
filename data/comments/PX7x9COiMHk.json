I still like TYT, but if \nwe play devil's advocate here I can personally say TYT is a loyalist to \nSnowden and why?\n\nLast time check folks. Mr. Snowden is criminal because he leaked out very \nsensitive documents which might aid our enemies in the future. Also \ncountries like Russia and China aren't loyal to Obama, but loyal to \nAmerica's money. \n\nAm I right +Fred Williams +Anthony Dash, +zee evans , and +Wendy Michele \ufeff",
