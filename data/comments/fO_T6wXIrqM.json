If it weren't for the photos I take of Little Jack, \nfamily and friends don't even believe he exists -- they've never ever seen \nhim! My other cat Joey is more social -- he'll come out to observe guests \nand allow certain people to touch him or play with him. But Jack is simply \nterrified. How can I help him overcome his fear of people?\ufeff",

Try giving treats too.

I may suggest you spend time with your \ncat, play with him and pet him. It can help easing some of his energy and \nstress away. One of my adopted cat freaked out when I brought him home. He \nseemed like a total strayed. He was sacred to be petted. Not interested in \ntreats. Play really rough with other cats, so now only the big fluffy \nfellow would play with him.(but don't know why he was much more friendly in \nshelter.) It took him about two weeks to be comfortable with my room which \nhe was the only cat in the room at that time. Then took him a month to step \nout of the room. And another few months not to attach with my room. After \nanother few months, finally I can pet him once in a while. After a year, he \nwould lay his head on my hand and rub it. Still don't like my hand to be \nhigher than his head. So, it really takes times, efforts, patience and \npersistence to help your cat. Things I learnt was keep trying but don't \npush them too hard. I was still a cat beginner at that time. Even my \nexperienced friend started to give up, I just have faith that cats always \nhave a soft side and he is my responsibility since I took him home.

He's a biter and scratches when scared, \nangry,  happy ect...( I will never declaw a cat) He was the sweetest kitten \nbut around 6 mos he started attacking us, our feet and ankles and hands and \nstopped sitting on our laps and sleeping on us.  He will jump up on my \nhusband's leg with all claws dug in  but wont do it to me.

People think I'm crazy for \nkeeping him but I love him and know he would have to be put down if I did. \n When he was neutered they had to knock him out while he was in his carrier \nbefore they could handle him.
