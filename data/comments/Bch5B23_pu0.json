Basically the valve \nwould have to wait for the piston to be completely clear of the valve \nbefore opening, rather than opening right after the piston passes TDC. \nUnless they can somehow control the speed at which it opens, using \ndifferent air pressure, but that gets extremely complicated and still not \neven sure it's possible. But it is still an improvement over what we have \ncurrently. But another thought is, if they design it on an engine that is \nnot an interference engine (Meaning the piston never crosses the path the \nvalve takes), for example, dips in the top of the pistons for valve \nclearance, then they could REALLY squeeze some power out of any engine.",

Additionally, with this type \nof system, you can't vary the valve lift like Honda's VTEC or Toyota's \nValve-Matic. Airflow doesn't like big lifts at low rpm. The whole problem \nwith this type of valve actuation system is that it can't be optimized for \nall driving conditions. You need variable timing, variable lift, and \nideally, a variable profile. The system here is 1D. The OEM's spend \nMILLIONS on 1 mpg. When we start applying litmus tests like this, it seems \nrather ridiculous.
