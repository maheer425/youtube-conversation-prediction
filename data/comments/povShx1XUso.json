Ok, let's say they clone your aunt \nusing her DNA. A replica of your aunt at your desired age wouldn't plop out \nthe end of a machine. A baby would have to be born. And that baby would be \ngenetically identical to your aunt, back in the 1930's. And then someone \nwould have to raise her in today's society. She'd have new memories, new \nrelatives, most likely a new personality.\nBasically, she'd be a totally different person from your aunt, you wouldn't \nbe able to relate to her like you did\n and she wouldn't have any of her memories.\nSo I don't really see the use for it. You'd just be doing the same as \nmaking a new baby the normal way. The point of cloning a bison isn't to \nbring that very same bison to life, it's to bring the whole species to life.",

Second, you need a modern \"cousin\" of that species to be alive.\n\nIn ovoviviparous species, if you have the two above: it's \"easy\" and has \nalready been done with some fish, toads and birds. But it's actually \nexpensive and can take a long time, since needs 3 generations to have the \nexincted one hatching the egg.\n\nFor mammals, there's a bigger problem: the animals chosen to be the \n\"mothers\" of the species who you want to bring back would suffer a lot of \nstress and miscarriages until the expertiment finally succeed, this can be \nvery traumatizing and even fatal to some individuals. They can also give \nbirth to animals with malformations who would also suffer unnecessarily.\n\nThe benefits of bringing back extinct animals, are minimal for science, \nsince the possible ones are most recent and  it's only minor things that we \ndon't know about them. For enviromental reasons, you'll need a LOT of \nprolific individuals to really bring the species back from the status of \n\"extict\", and also in most cases the original habitat of the extinct \nspecies is already gone too. The only other reason would be for \nentertaining.\nSo, to the \"science\" point of view, none of these reasons are worth the \npain, stress and suffering of the animals involved on the experience.\n\nTL;DR: ethics.",

As far as a \nrocket being used in space, a rocket uses so much power, so much thrust, \nthat even though the outcome changes between atmosphere and no atmosphere, \nthe change is so little in respect to the energy being used to propel the \nrocket, that essentially nothing changes. And when it comes to the Voyager \nreaching Triton, and other such celestial bodies, we must remember that \nthese celestial bodies are constantly moving at high speeds. So, maybe it \nreached Triton at the pace it did to ensure it passed by Triton at the most \nopportune time. I hope this answers your questions, and again, not a \nscientist in any respect.

If we could accelerate to any meaningful extent while in \nthe vacuum of space would not this be to our advantage . The Voyager has \njust now reached Triton . Wouldn't it have been much better to have reached \nthis point 15 years earlier and saved all the possible attrition to its \ncomponents that the lapse of time might engender . All it would require is \na secondary \" thrust \" rocket that the craft would carry into space to \nprovide the additional speed but this was not done . Why ? Why haven't any \nspace missions been provided with such ? Could it be that \" thrust \" \nrequires something to push against ? See how logic works ?
