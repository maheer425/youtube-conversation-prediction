I'm not here to talk over a group of people wanting someone from \ntheir own group\n~I didn't realize the commenter was Korean themself~ but others outside of \nthe groups usually inflict harm towards that one group because they make \nstereotypes without really knowing an actual person from that group. It's \nlike crushing on a character from another country's media and expecting \nevery single person in that country to be like the character. I personally \ndon't mind if these girls say \"I want to date a K-pop idol\" or \"I want \nsomeone like a K-pop idol\" but it crosses a line if they do say \"I want to \ndate a Korean\" because they are implying that they think K-pop idols=Every \nKorean person. That's racial fetishization. That's what bugs me. People \nfrom my race are fetishized and it disgusts me because people outside of my \nrace think we're all the same. I developed low-self esteem due to \nassumptions like that and I would hate to see it done to others. A simple \ncrush can turn into an obsession and there has been studies on that. Just \ndo a simple google search of \"racial fetishization\" and it will show you. \nI don't want to get in-depth about a western/America/European idols because \nthey are usually the media's pinnacle of beauty. Global society expects \npeople to crush over western, typically White, celebrities because of White \nsupremacy embedded in this global society. Even if you \"fetishize\" these \nWestern idols,\nyou are not doing harm to them or to their people.You are elevating their \nposition to a higher level in racial hierarchy. And believe or not, \nWhite supremacy has created racial fetishization because the stereotypes \nthat non-White groups have are usually accepted by the White supremacist \nsociety anyways.

You can suck this. :D\nOn a more positive side (?), it has almost 7M views, I see that the \ninternational fandom also likes more melodic songs and not just the typical \n\"a bunch of people dancing in a box\" kind of songs. :3\nBTW I hope I don't see more \"they bought those awards\" comments on any \"not \nyour regular k-group\" song that becomes bigger than those regular songs, \nit's just annoying when this happens, like, those 15YO fans are really \nobsessed with their oppas winning any random music show just because they \nbelong to a big label.

I think the \ntranslation for sajaegi means \"manipulation\", which is used when a \nlabel/group/artist \"manipulates\" the charts by bulk-buying one certain \nalbum (and selling it and then buying it back so it counts as 2 sales per \nalbum on Hanteo) or streaming a song thousands of times per day. It's like \nthe methods some fans use for their idols (mainly for male groups) when a \nbunch of fans stream their songs on a certain hour to get the #1 on real \ntime or when they buy a certain album in a certain day to reach a high spot \non the daily charts, but doing it on a greater scale, as some music \ncompanies have way bigger resources than the fans. So jealous fans were \nblaming SISTAR's label (which is not one of the big ones) to \"do sajaegi\" \nwith this song, because it won like 10-12 awards on music shows, basically \nbecause it has been the biggest song of this year, and I doubt there'll be \na bigger one. Also when we show those haters the receipts of the song being \nthe biggest selling one, and having an extremely good stability on lots of \ncharts (you can't get that with sajaegi) they still yell sajaegi. xD",

I got it!!! Guess we can't do anything about it then \u3160\u3160\n\n(After having his little sad moment, Baro quickly presses the bus stop \nbutton to get off.

Are you busy?\nB: Yeah. I'm a little busy now, so I'll call you later~\n\nAnd...yeah!\n\nI tried to be as accurate and detailed as possible...\nHope you guys who didn't understand the texting can enjoy the MV even more \nnow! xx\n\n-Julia x\ufeff",
