I know \nfor a fact a lot of the Team B dance moves are from video's she's done with \nJay Park. So possibly a dance coach too. She's obviously very YG, flying \nback and forth between Korea and America. She was just in Mino's 'I'm Him' \nmusic video. So I'd say, she's very much a YG employee. You don't have your \nown personal 'cover' version of this song put up for nothing. Especially \nnot on YG's official Youtube channel.",

You're stupid, ugly, an idiot, fat, and should I say more? And what \ndo you have for me to like you back?\"\n\nI moved on and decided that I'll be skinnier and get prettier, and in a few \nyears, I'll prove him and show him what he missed : ) It has been a year \nand a half and I'm getting improvements on my body, face and grades. My \nfriends were always there to be beside me and comfort me, pushing me with \nsupport every time I wanted to quit. What I'm trying to say is that no \nmatter what that girl and your ex do or say, always stay strong and move \non, because there are other guys out there that may be your knight in \nshining armor. Perhaps God put him in your life to see if your heart was \nstrong enough to endure him, then He will give you the man that truly \ndeserves you and loves you with all his heart.\n\nI'm here to support you, Dianne : ) <3",
