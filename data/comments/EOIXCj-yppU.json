Consider the few working \ntowards the apocalypse, as seen with John Hagee's Zionist movement. These \npeople have no love of mankind and wish to run away from their own \nresponsibilities as caretakers of the world. \nThe KKK identifies as a Christian organization. This is yet another example \nof another version of Christianity. Not all denominations are bad, but to \nthink that one religion has all of the answers is saying that your supposed \nloving God hates a lot of people and damns them for living in a different \ncountry or dying when they aren't old enough due to some fools not getting \nimmunized. (Original sin) \nIt concerns me that you have this rather bizarre notion that Atheists are \nevil. I would highly recommend you study some legitimate psychology as \nwell, as that may give you some insight that you are clearly missing \nregarding human behavior. Seriously, it is a rather neat subject that is \nworth looking into. Best of all, there is a bunch of universities that \noffer free access to course materials (Open Courseware). \nHave you read the Bible lately and considered the problem with \ninterpretation? People still harass women for wanting some control over \ntheir destinies, and there are many that endorse death for adultery. It \nwasn't all that long ago that women weren't able to own  property in \nwestern countries for reason of Biblical interpretation. \nDo you believe women should be considered second class citizens? Do you \nbelieve that its okay for a man to have multiple wives but a woman not have \nthe ability to have multiple husbands? (gender equality) Do you believe its \nokay for a parent to kill a rebellious child? Do you believe that it is \nokay to enslave foreigners, and if so what constitutes a \"foreigner\"? Do \nyou believe that women should be deterred from education? \nWe can see throughout history how bad men and women have used the various \nreligious scriptures to manipulate and control others. The question is: \nwill you be versed enough in each (removing the bias of your own faith) and \nstudy history enough to think critically? If you are well-versed, you will \nnotice similarities in faith systems across the globe regardless of \ndenominational inclinations. You need to think critically and skeptically \notherwise you will fall victim to vipers and con artists. \nBTW, you might want to work on your punctuation and spelling when you post, \nas it takes readers much longer to decipher what you are trying to \ncommunicate. And if you are simply a troll looking to bait people, then I \nfeel sorry that you lack a better use for your time. ",

So \nyou want to censor all other ideas that you believe threaten your version \nof humanity's way of life. \n\nI don't care if you believe in whatever, but censorship, even for \"the good \nof humanity\" seems an awful lot like a dictatorial, if not religious law.  \nI believe your methods of force is wrong, but your topic of morals should \nbe discussed in the academic field.  not in positions of power, just as any \nother faith should not.  If someone is hurting your freedom, call the \nauthorities.  Your followers should not have sole access to these \nprotective services.\n\nGetting better with the insults, but they are still there and damage your \nretort to mine.",

The mind set can be long term or situational and affects \neach worshiper at some point if not bi-weekly.\nSecond. Obviously, within this chat and this video, one side is serious. \nBecause the \"atheists\" you generalized are here and pointing out the \nproblem. In this case Cruz control. Your straw man statement was also a \nproblem seeing as you failed to recognize Rafael as a problem, but saw his \nattackers as such. In fact made yourself a continuation of the problem by \nnot seeing the problem, when it's live on tape, and with both of your \nfollow ups to opposition being cop-outs trying to leave the issue behind. \nThough the issue will still there in only in another forum.\nThird is the headline issue you need to drink in like metaphorical blood. \nIf one side blames the other with unfounded bullshit and the accused \nattempt to \"solve\"(a bogusly scientific way you put it there)an issue by \nmeans that aren't within utter falsehoods.

It's like talking great about a parent \nin death, when they thoroughly abused you in life, JUST because they're \nyour parents.  It's not fair.  Death is suppose (irrational obligation)  to \nbe judgement day - so-to-speak.  It's no different than murdering someone \nand praying for forgiveness and then moving on as if nothing happen, \ndespite that family being torn apart, simply because you wanted to murder \nsomeone for the fun of it.

In fact, it is a \nfailure to reason, and a lack of knowledge of genetics, which would lead a \nperson to such beliefs.\n\nYes, all morality is derived through reason. From where else is any \nknowledge of any kind derived? Unreason? Illogic? Arbitrary assumptions?\n\nEmpathy and reason can find themselves at odds. (Humans are naturally \nsusceptible to having disproportionate empathy for those of their own \nfamily, for example, even when those family members behave in ways that \nharm other people.) But more often than not, being empathetic makes it \neasier to reason correctly.\n\nEven setting empathy aside, however; even setting aside the fact that while \ncertain mutations are maladaptive, offshoots of those mutations may have \ngreat benefit, and that it is thus generally beneficial to preserve as much \ndiversity in the human gene pool as possible; eugenics is *still* \nunreasonable. It is quite reasonable to come to the conclusion, based only \non what we know about people and how they view their freedom to carry \nthrough their pregnancies how they see fit, that the dystopian social cost \nof eugenics outweighs any possible benefit that artificial selection would \nprovide.\n\nWe're not asking the question, \"What stops *any* person of faith from being \nevil?\" Rather, we are asking the question, \"What stops a particular person \nof faith -- a person who believes that having faith is the only reason not \nto be evil -- from being evil if they lose their faith?\"\n\nIt really isn't complicated. Such people aren't arguing that their systems \nof moral beliefs are in addition to mine -- they are arguing that mine do \nnot exist; and, that theirs wouldn't either the moment they stopped \nbelieving in God.",

If your question is really \"what's to \nstop people of faith from being evil\", then that question, of course, \nshould be asked of you. What stops YOU from being evil?\n\nBack to you, Richard - You honestly think that morality is derived from \nreason and empathy?... If we were reasonable people, we would terminate all \npregnancies with the slightest genetic defect. If we were reasonable, we \nwould forcefully require all people with genetic defects to undergo \nsterilization. Empathy doesn't factor into those kinds of things.

However, this attitude opens up the door \nnot too dissimilar from the view portrayed by Cruz - i.e. that only their \nparticular religious flavor of morality is correct.  It begs the question \nabout morality of people in other religions as well as those of athiests. \n Clearly, it is silly to state that only christians have morals. Societies \nfunction across the spectra of religious and cultural beliefs and societies \nwere certainly able to function prior to the development of christianity or \nany of the Abrahamic religions.  Alternatively, if christian's allow \nmorality to be sourced from outside religion, which the evidence surely \nindicates, then it begs the question of what real purpose does their \nreligion provide to society.  In the latter case, religion can be \ndenigrated to a social club or relegated in value only at the individual \nlevel of one seeking commune with their spiritual side.  Organized religion \nis hardly a necessity for the latter. ",

because beleif in them \nfaded...nobody beleives in the Nordic gods, or greek/roman anymore...but \nthats the problem - religion cant exist if nobody beleives in it...so most \npeople become forced into it by being told to do so...in reality, no child \nis born religious, we are all born atheist..we adopt religion based on how \nwe are raised...most children would not be Christian if they were not \nraised to be that way by their parents from an incredibly early age...thats \nhow religion propagates...it doesnt drag in many members from people that \nare already several years old...it mainly gains members by teaching \nincredibly young children the religion's views...and lets be honest...when \na kid is like 4-5 years old, they arent going to know to question such \nthings...they are still so immature mentally that their minds dont go \"hey, \nthis smells kinda fishy...we may wanna ask about it first\"...instead their \nbrains go \"im being told this by mommy and daddy, it must be \ntrue\"...because as a child becomes a teen or adult, their brain is far more \ndeveloped...they develop far better mental capabilities as theyy get older\n\nso tell ya what...if you can ever somehow manage to find actual proof that \na god of ANY kind exists...ill kindly reconsider my viewws in light of \nproper evidence...but its been 2014 years now and nobody has yet found one \nlittle shred of proof...so for a person like me...i wont beleive because im \nbeing threatened by others (not necessarily you of course)...telling me im \ngoing to hell when theres no proof of a god or even a heaven/hell isnt \ngoing to make me suddenyl beleive\n\nsince at least at this point in time theres no proof of a god...anyone \nsaying to a person \"but youll go to hell!\" should be considered \noffensive...because its little more than an empty threat based on no \nproof/evidence...if someone who isnt religious would say \"you better think \nEvolution is real or a meteor is gonna come down and kill you\"...do you \nthink ANYONE would take that seriously?\n\nthats the atheistic view and mindset - if you claim there is a god all wwe \nwant is proof...if there isnt proof, then we will not beleive until there \nIS proof...but if the worlds religions havent found proof in all these 100s \nof 1000s of years...thats a good sign that there isnt proof...and that said \nthings arent real...even with sciences countless advances allowing us to \ndiscover stuff that even 100 years ago was but a wild dream...even science \ncant find proof...and the whole purpose of science is to find proof and \ndiscover truth about our world and the grand expanse of space \nbeyond...science is merely the never-ending search for knowledge and \nunderstanding...also the only way known to humankind currently that is a \nreliable method in which to determine truth from fantasy\n\nand Tony, whether you choose to beleive such things or not, thats up to \nyou...but some of us prefer to live our lives and take in the world in a \nway that we can be assured what we know is true...and tthats why at least \nsome of atheism exists...people who look at the world and do not see the \nhand of a god in it anywhere...and on the other hand we have science \nconstantly making discoveries and finding out exactly how the world \nworks...i mean you dont beleive the earth is flat anymore...they did thanks \nto religion centuries ago...but science came along and kinda shattered \nthat...and in modern science ever since weve been int space....we KNOW the \nworld isnt flat...but for years Religion wanted us to think it was flat and \neven went as far as puttig people in prison if they tried to teach people \nthat it WASNT flat\n\nand im aware i probly cant change your views so im not really gonna try, \nbut let me ask you:\n\nwhich is more likely to be reality - evidence science has tested and \nobserved and found to be true as to how somethin in the world works or the \nexistance of something\n\nOR\n\nsomeone who simply tells you \"this is how it is\" but offers no proof to \nsupport the claim?\n\nif i said thheres a giant chicken pot pie in the sky in the clouds...you \nwouldnt beleive me, because theres no evidence or proof...so then why is \nbeleif in a god exempt from such criteria?\n\nif you cant beleive in the giant pot pie in the clouds...well, theres no \nmore proof for a God than there is for a giant pie in the sky...yet god is \nconsidered by some ot be real...the pie is not\n\nim aware thats a very simple comparison but it makes the point clear...why \nbeleive ANYTHING when there isnt any sort of evidence? even evidence thats \nplausible to SUGGEST the existence...evidence doesnt have to directly prove \nsomething...but as long as it has ideas that are solid and are a plausible \nmeans...then its considered at least possible...but so far, no religion on \nearth has even Supporting Evidence for the various claims of a God\n\nthats why i appreciate science - it relies on rigorous processes to test \nand verify things...and if something it tests turns out not to be true, \nthen its considered false or at the very least the way we THOUGHT it worked \nis called Incorrect...science doesn always nail the truth of something on \nthe first try...but even if it doesnt, that doesnt mean that it doesnt work \nthat way...it just means the method science used to approach said \nquestion/problem was the wrong method...and science never stops...its \nalways searching, seeking, and finding answers...things we couldnt prove \nwith science 20 years ago are being proven today and still by using Science",

Most humans are only as \"moral\" as their \ncircumstances and will earnestly throw their morality out the window if it \nmeans assuring their survival or personal interest. An atheist starving to \ndeath would not hesitate to steal a piece of meat, or rob someone of their \nfood, and in extreme circumstances, may even resort to cannibalism. Of \ncourse most people would sacrifice themselves to save a loved one or close \nfriend but that is still a self interested act because our loved ones and \nclose friend are part of who we are. How many would be willing to sacrifice \nthemselves for complete strangers? Maybe 10% of the people if we are being \ngenerous? Please, the only thing inherent in us is the instinct for \nsurvival and that trumps all our lofty ideas and moral principals any day. \nSo the next time Dawkins or someone else tells you that \"morality is \ninherent in humans\" or the product of \"human evolution\" just remember \"its \nbullshit and its bad for you.\" \ufeff",
