In truth they are a \nintelligent bunch of people, but with that said, it doesn't take a rocket \nscientist to go through 4 years of medical school. I am not saying or \nimplying that  any idiot or an idiot can do it, rather if you are decently \nsmart, can work very hard with constant studying, you can get an MD and \nmatch into a decent residency program.\n\nThe PhD's on the other hand in certain subjects, such as the maths and hard \nsciences, require something a little more than constant studying and \nmemorizing. It requires an out of the box way of thinking and an innovated \nmind that looks at the world in a different way. These guys are normally \nthe best of the best in their fields and less people can go on this route \nthan the MD route imo.\n\nIn the end, both are smart in a different way. However, in my opinion, the \nPhD holder in the hard sciences and math, is on average more \"intelligent.\" \nJust remember, medical doctors hijacked the term doctor from PhD's and \nhijacked the white lab coat from the scientists lol.

It's a very mysterious and murky subject. All you said above is \ntrue, COBE probe found the background radiation. The cosmological constant \nyou mentioned is not really relevant, and I'm not sure you even understand \nwhy Einstein called it his biggest blunder. It's a constant that was needed \nto get the space-time field equations to work, without it they simply \ndegenerated. It's a constant that can't really be explained even to this \nday, and what makes it even more perplexing is that there is now a proved \nacceleration that's happening not just a standard linear expansion. We have \n\"theories\" to suggest as to why but all of them involve the dark forces \nwhich in themselves are not even close to being understood. But we're \njumping ahead of ourselves, I'm not exactly sure why you brought up \nexpansion, I'm talking about the actual big bang and the mystery behind it. \nIf you really did know it well then you'd know that Big Bang is split up \ninto eras, the first 3 or 4 eras we know almost nothing about because the \ntemperature at the end of 4th one is 100 mill hotter then the surface of \nthe sun not allowing us to get anywhere close to experimenting with in any \npredictable future. Even the newer eras are very murky, maybe at \nnucleosyntheis we can use some high-energy quantum mechanical model to \nslighly approximate the behaviour of space-time and energies at those \ntemperatures, still very speculative. So as to the actual big bang, it's \nextremely mysterious, the first GUT era, which is named after the Grand \nUnified Theory states there was one single force, the temperatures at that \nlevel is nothing that we will EVER be able to reach and even if we ever had \nreached it we wouldnt be able to study anything since all the normal laws \nbreak far below those \"unification\" energies. Don't get me wrong I'm not \nsaying it's an invalid theory, like you said the evidences that we have \nsupport the Big Bang, but do you not see how it's almost god like in a way \nif you read Genesis and compare the 2 it's almost indistinguishable. It \nbasically means that all the forces of the universe, the forces that hold \nmatter together the forces that hold gluons and leptons together is in face \none singe energy. That's what I meant when I said it has a religious \novertone, not that the whole theory is wrong, it probably is very accurate, \nbut even being accurate it's still a mystery.",

Have \nyou any familiarity with it attention all???\nEinstein's theory of relativity predicted an expanding/contracting \nuniverse. But at the time it was thought the universe was stable. So \nEinstein invented the cosmological constant to bring it inline. Einstein \nlater said that this \"was the biggest mistake of his career\".\nSome years later Edwin Hubble discoverd that the universe was indeed \nexpanding by observation. Theoretical physicists/cosmologists got to work \nand predicted that there should be an \"echo\" left over that should be still \nobservable, working out roughly what it should be like temp, frequency etc. \nIt turns out that is exactly what we do find as the microwave background \nradiation.\nAnyone doing even a small amount of research into the subject HONESTLY can \nreally come to no other reasonable conclusion. It is only the religious \nwith an agenda who missinterpret things and downright lie. This is the \nreason for the \"religious debate\". This is the only controversy.\nPretty much every physicists and cosmologist accepts it as the best \nexplanation for what we observe with only a few mavericks/cranks seeing \nthings differently.\nBTW how do you conclude that \"it's one of those things that will never be \ntruly understood\". Seems I understand it slightly better than you do, yet I \nwould never have the confidence to make such a statement. Seems a little \nconceited. Don't you think we should leave questions like this to those who \nACTUALLY really DO understand about this and work in the field.",

Every piece of fossil they have found to call our ancestor \nand to liken us to some ape-like creature, don't stand up. It's a joke! \nHaving similarities in our DNA means we shared a common ancestor, is a \njoke! But they need to link us to all of life because all life have \nsimiliar genes in some areas.

How so?  Wouldn't it be more true to say the military should \nbe privatized completely and only those who can afford to pay should be \nafforded protection?\n\nI would argue instead that taxation for the purposes maintaining the state \n(government, military, penal, regulatory, etc) is a form of socialist \nconstruct that all sides agree is necessary to some extent (exactly to what \nextent is really the source of division).\n\nCertainly the offshoots of the military, that being the \"industrial \ncomplex\" part of it is capitalistic as is the penal system in large part \n(which is a serious problem).\n\nYour proposed solution to oligarchies is incorrect.  That may be a solution \nto corporations getting too large... but it doesn't prevent any individual \nor family from growing.  Worse yet, when all political contribution limits \nhave been removed (which becoming more and more the case), the opportunity \nfor the uber-privileged to purchase politicians (and laws) that benefit \nthem more than anyone, class mobility suffers.  \n\nI want to note here that I'm not against success (that is the reason for \nbeing and entrepreneur), only that when 85 people on the planet have more \nwealth than the bottom 3.5 billion, there's an issue.\n\nHealthcare has been privatized for the entire existence of the U.S. (with \nperhaps the exception of the V.A. hospitals which can be considered \nstepchild of the military).  Medicaid and Medicare pay for some of it... \nbut it is paid to private firms and individuals, not government firms.\n\nStudies of other first-world countries show that their costs are lower \nbecause the ENTIRE COUNTRY negotiates with medical and pharmaceutical \nproviders to get the lowest price.  The highly fragmented (state by state \nand municipality by municipality) method in the U.S. is part of the reason \ncosts are so artificially high.\n\nEach and every administration since the Vietnam war has increased the debt. \n Prior to that there was an increase for each war and then a period of \npay-down.  All administrations are to blame (left and right).  The \nrepublicans certainly have no legitimate claim to reducing debt or deficit \n(I'm not saying the democrats do either).\n\nI doubt anyone would argue that the current S.S. program is sustainable. \n In contrast however, I'd point out that the vast majority of people \ncouldn't invest their way out of a wet paper bag and most are just as \nlikely to lose whatever they have in the next Bernie Madoff scandal.  Less \nlikely if what you mean is more like \"investing in a mutual fund\".\n\nI'm a believer in \"incentive based everything\".  But I wouldn't go so far \nas to say that all social programs create a disincentive for people to \nwork.  I believe in limited social nets.  Your likely too young to see how \nthings beyond your control (like a car accident) can suddenly destroy \neverything.  There are some pretty sneaky ways that the medical \nestablishment can jack your costs into the hundreds of thousands in days or \nweeks despite insurance and you're suddenly destitute and need a hand up.\n\nI own a business and work with multi-billion-dollar manufacturers for a \nliving (and for the last 20 years).  I'm not unaware of business and \ngovernment at a very large scale.  There are companies out there that own \n3500 hospitals under 20 different company names.  You'd be amazed at how \nbillions can be skimmed from the government (and taxpayers) as well as \nprivate individuals.  One of the contributors is the grand network of \ninsurance providers.\n\nYou see MUCH lower costs in single-payer countries.  It doesn't fix \neverything... but it does limit some of the massive loopholes that exist \nbecause of byzantine rules for hundreds of insurance providers and \nvariations from state to state.\n\nAnd... both the left and right sides of any country that has single-payer \nwant to keep it once they see the benefits.\n\nThere is so much nearly-religious but low-knowledge fervor around the \nsubject in the U.S.\n\nBut then, that applies to much of the electorate about most topics.  Which \nis why it's not a democracy but a democratic republic.\n\nEnough babble... I have to get my taxes in before the deadline.  \n\nPerhaps we'll solve the world's problems another day.  ",

And if \nthere\u2019s sex with multiple partners then that just makes their sin worse. \nThe solution isn\u2019t putting a band aid on it or in this case a condom, but \ndealing with the root of the problem, sin. A true Christian who has AIDS \nwill willingly live a life of celibacy rather than risk giving it to their \nspouse or passing it on to children born to them. If every person there \nwere truly converted, the AIDS epidemic there would end with the most \nrecent generation born who has it.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cThe denominations you see in Christianity are EXACTLY what one \nwould expect if a billion plus people read the same book and interpret it \ndifferently. This is true of shakespear,or any other literary source. \"A \nrose by any other name would smell as sweet\". Is there one correct view on \nwhat this means? No?\u201d\n\nThis line essentially means if you call a rose a pile of horse dung it will \nstill smell as sweet (as a rose because horse dung smells very bad). How \nelse would you understand the line? Are you asking if Juliet is referring \nto Romeo when she speaks this line, the answer is yes. On denominations, \nlet me make this clear, you cannot be a Christian if you deny the \nsupernatural accounts in the Bible, reduce everything to symbolism or \nparables, or deny the core truths of Christianity (As summarized in the \nApostles\u2019 Creed along with the Nicene Creed and Creed of Chalcedon). It \nwould be like calling a frog, a chicken. Now of all the evangelical \ndenominations, we are still brothers and sisters despite our disagreements \non certain doctrines. Throughout history this has always been the case. On \nwhich is the true denomination, you\u2019re asking the wrong question, because \nwho I mentioned above are all true Christian denominations. As to which is \nclosest to doctrinal purity, the reformed Presbyterian groups. But as to \nwhy we disagree, intellectual sin still gets the best of us. We are not as \nlogical in our thinking as we ought to be and often times very stubborn. \nSpiritually, we are reborn but we still reside in our corrupt flesh so our \nold ways of thinking and seeing the world can influence us still.\n\nYou wrote: \u201c\u2026We can literally see the evolution of morality in front of us \nin other creatures. If creatures didn't have morality and weren't social \nand worked together and just murdered constantly, they wouldn't survive and \npass on their genes. Pretty simple concept. Did you know even human babies \nreact morally when presented with wrongdoings?(There is a famous study on \nthis). They clearly haven't read the bible, but have all morality already \nimprinted in their genes. And also, you have to believe in Divine Command \ntheory as a Christian. How else would you justify genocide,rape,and murder \nin the OT? Surely you wouldn't stone your child to death as a father if God \ncommanded. Or would you?\u201d\n\nThis is where your use of logic fails you. If you don\u2019t have a transcendent \nstandard of morals, logically nothing can be objectively right or wrong, \ngood or evil. You have nothing but opinions and in a universe with no \nuniversal transcendent moral standard one opinion is no better than another \nand in the end what settles \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d is might. I have the \nstrength to impose my will on you and you can do nothing about it. In the \nape example you provided, there is no morality in apes, just ape behavior, \na glimpse at how humans would behave if all humans didn\u2019t believe in a god \nand idea of god or creator didn\u2019t exist. In your example the ape saw that \nhe was receiving less, how does it automatically mean he felt injustice? \nIt\u2019s likely he was \u201cenvious\u201d of the other ape who received more and cared \nless about being \u201cfair\u201d. In your case, It would\u2019ve made more sense to \nprovide an example where an ape received a lot and saw other apes with less \nand gave some of his bananas to the other apes to balance the inequality. \nBut even then you would have to ask how much human influence was forced \nupon the ape. He could\u2019ve been taught to evenly distribute bananas to other \napes. This doesn\u2019t prove anything at all.\n\nAnd you miss the point I make. I\u2019m not asking whether you have morals or \nnot, you do, we all do, because we are human, made in the image of God, so \nwe have volition, will, intelligence, logical thought, moral disposition \nand live in God\u2019s created universe which he sovereignly governs so that the \nuniverse we live in is also his revelation to us.\n\nAs a Christian we have God, as an atheist you have only the material \nuniverse; molecules in motion. We explain human experience through God\u2019s \nexistence, I\u2019m asking you to explain human experience through molecules in \nmotion. Let me give you this parallel,\n\nIt\u2019s like you arguing that there is no air(God) but when I point out that \nyou are breathing(being moral) which proves there must be air(God), you \nreply back saying there is no air(God) and I am breathing(being moral).\n\nI\u2019m speaking about the requirements for human intelligence, morals, \nscience, and knowledge. The Christian God is required for this. If you \ndon\u2019t believe that then explain these things in terms of molecules in \nmotion, is love indigestion, can atoms \u201cchoose\u201d how to behave, if not \nexplain the above by these conditions, let logic take you to ridiculous \nheights.\n\nLastly you wrote: \u201cAnd also, you have to believe in Divine Command theory \nas a Christian. How else would you justify genocide,rape,and murder in the \nOT? Surely you wouldn't stone your child to death as a father if God \ncommanded. Or would you?\u201d\n\nI can see where you might define acts in the OT as genocide and murder but \nwhere ever did God command rape? Better question though is, in a material \nuniverse where no universal standard existence i.e. no obligatory \nauthority, if \u201crape\u201d is the accepted norm wouldn\u2019t it be neither right nor \nwrong? Slavery wouldn\u2019t be right nor wrong. The torture of little children \nwouldn\u2019t be right nor wrong. Now back to reality where God exists, if my \nson defied God to his face and the penalty was death, then he would be \nguilty of death. In Numbers 15:35 God killed a man for picking up sticks on \nthe Sabbath day. Prior to that He put to death many for defying him and \nwhen he gave the command to do all your work in the first 6 days of the \nweek and to do no work on the Sabbath but to rest and to keep it holy, what \ndid the man do, he went and performed work and for that he was killed.",

You wrote: \u201cAs far as this point goes, the \nonly part of the Bible to in any form contradict the theory of evolution is \nGenesis, and believe it or not, you could chop off the first ten chapters \nof Genesis and the Bible would be exactly the same.\u201d\nI responded to it. My point is valid. This however was not my point, you \nwrote \u201cYour point is simply that once this account was included, other \nprophets sited it\u201d. My point if you missed it was that the God the father \nand God the son and the prophets referenced the book of Genesis account as \nhistorical. So disbelieve all you want with what the Bible clearly says, \njust please don\u2019t introduce ridiculous ideals that can\u2019t be found in the \nBible.\nAs to the remainder of the first part of your reply, I don\u2019t know how this \nrelates to what I posted. I do need to make mention that when Jesus spoke a \nparable, it was clear he spoke a parable, it always stated that it was a \nparable. When he used metaphors, it was clear he spoke in metaphors from \nthe surrounding text in the responses from his listeners, etc. (if you\u2019re \nunclear about one, let me know, and I\u2019ll point out to you how by \nunderstanding the context you can know if it was metaphor or not). When he \nspoke about God creating them male and female, it was clear it was not a \nmetaphor or a parable. Again disbelieve it but don\u2019t sell me that it\u2019s \nsomething it\u2019s not.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cYes, let's site the guy who was raised Egyptian in a \npolytheistic society as the true prophet for origin of Genesis. That really \ndoesn't contradict my point either.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just pointing out to the readers that God gave the account to us \nthrough Moses and not Abraham whom many might understand from your writing \nthat he\u2019s the \u201cstory teller\u201d (you wrote: \u201c\u2026the stories of Adam and Eve, of \nNoah and the Flood, these were all just stories told to Abraham and managed \nto survive\u201d\n\nYou wrote: \u201cYou realize, I hope, that this statement is entirely the basis \nfor the myriad of Christian denominations\u201d\n\nSin is the reason, intellectual sin, the heart being the root. When you \nstart with secular ideas that contradict the scripture to interpret \nscripture, as a Christian, you will find yourself contradicting scripture. \nYou will find in these denominations the parts they disagree with other \nChristians on, don\u2019t harmonize well with their core Christian beliefs; i.e. \nyou\u2019ll have logical contradictions.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cOne of my favorite examples is with the concept of hell versus \nGahenna. In many English translations, Gahenna is equated with hell, but \ncontextually, Gahenna was an actual place at the time of Christ.\u201d\n\nReally, the author was referring to a physical place when \u201ccontextually\u201d, \nJesus is speaking about \u201chell\u201d. Cite the passage(s) you have in mind and \nwe\u2019re dissect it together.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cThere is the line in the Bible that \"one shalt not suffer a \nwitch to live\" but Solomon summons the Witch of Endor, which implies that \nthe council he gains from the witch, as well as the means of summoning the \nwitch, were deemed permissible in the tenants of the time. In the original \ndocument in its original language, distinctions were made between orders \nthat used magic for evil. This comes up in documents regarding the Salem \nWitch Trials.\u201d\n\nFirst off, it was King Saul, not Solomon (David\u2019s son \u2013 David whom Saul \ntried to murder in hopes of securing his rule). He sought her, concealing \nhis identity to her, and when asking her to summon Samuel, she first \nrefused quoting the law against witchcraft rightly decreed by King Saul. \nWhen Saul convinced her that no harm would come to her, she did her part, \nand was frightened when she discovered it was actually King Saul asking \nher, for fear of her life (luckily for her Saul kept his word to her, not \nto harm her, and this wasn't some form of entrapment as she might of \nthought). Nevertheless it clearly shows that King Saul was so desperate for \nrevelation from God, that he was willing to play the hypocrite and do that \nwhich he was right to condemn, seek out a witch. If Christians debated \nwhich \u201cmagic\u201d was permissible then they didn\u2019t get it from the Bible, even \nin its original languages. Dude! Why are you making this stuff up?\n\nYou wrote: \u201c\u2026not to draw attention\u2026The problem non-Christians have with \nCreationists is that they constantly demanded to be accommodated.\u201d\n\nThat is clearly not the point\u2026to avoid drawing attention. Sin is of the \nheart. Jesus talks about motive. But let us understand why Christians push \ncreationism to be accepted in schools. Let\u2019s be clear first of all, I don\u2019t \ndisagree with what can be observed, species of a kind becoming species of \nthe same kind, the only difference being they can no longer mate with each \nother and produce productive young. I don\u2019t disagree with a particular \ntrait found within a species that explains their survivor over their kin. \nWhat I do disagree with is the evolutionist interpretation of the facts. \nThat ultimately we came from the simplest of organism and ultimate organic \nmatter came from inorganic matter. Evolution is not a science, because it\u2019s \nclaimed to take millions and billions of years for a species of one kind to \nevolve into another species of another time, it cannot be validated by the \nscientific process in a span of a hundred generations even, I would argue \ninfinite generations. It\u2019s also a way for secularist to undermine the \nChristian religion. Because as Darwin and every early evolutionist \nunderstood it, it\u2019s either God or its atheistic evolution. Evolution is a \ntheory and you even mention that it is in your post, but I remember growing \nup in the public school system and it sure was taught like it was the \ntruth, being young and stupid as most kids are, I just naively absorbed \nwhat was fed me (and I grant you can argue that about Christian doctrine \ntaught to kids) and didn\u2019t think critically about it. What you should admit \nis this isn\u2019t the claimed science vs religion, it\u2019s about the secular \nworldview driven by atheist evolution vs the Christian worldview driven by \nthe Word of God. Behind this even, is the battle for human souls.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cthe theory of evolution has testable merits and demonstrative \nevidence and is the accepted theory for the diversity of life. No one knows \nhow life STARTED on the planet\u2026We can demonstrate that genes change, \nmutations occur. This simply means that everything is the cummulative \nmutations of its forebearers. That much is more or less indisputable.\u201d\n\nEvolution doesn\u2019t have testable merits and demonstrative evidence, it\u2019s not \nreal science, it\u2019s not proven, and it can\u2019t be proven within a hundred \ngenerations, reread above if you need. Finding a piece of fossil, inputting \nmissing data based on evolutionary models to produce evolutionary figures \nand results doesn\u2019t constitute as evidence. It\u2019s guessing based on \nevolutionary models. And if it is the accepted theory of diversity of life \nit\u2019s because it\u2019s the only thing allowed in the classroom. This is again \nnot about religion vs science as I stated it\u2019s really about the worldview \nof secularism vs the worldview of Christian theism. And God knows how life \nstarted. Only someone who was witness to it can tell us where we come from. \nThe Christian worldview logically can provide all the requirements for \nintelligent life and the complexity of life not just us one highly \nimprobable explanation for the diversity of life. Thinking about human life \nevolving from the simplest form of life in a universe comprised of \nmolecules in motion requires so much dumb blind faith, you have to ask \nyourself the hard questions like what is love in such a universe? Is it \nindigestion? How in this universe does the mind reason, to produce logical \nthought? Logically from naturally occurring chemical reactions which can\u2019t \nchoose how it behaves, so that, to argue a point logically is just what \nhappens and to argue illogically is just what happens and whether you know \nit or not, these states of \u201cmind\u201d are just happenings in the brain we have \nno control over.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cThe other issue here is that electing to withdraw your children \nfrom learning about evolution sets a dangerous precedent. But in the \nimmediate consequence, you are not teaching your kids to defend their faith \nbut rather to dig in their heels and essentially ignore any argument.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned above kids are \u201cstupid\u201d, they can accept anything, you tell \nthem evolution is true, they\u2019ll believe it, after all they believe in santa \nclause and the easter bunny and the tooth fairy. You want them to think \ncritically, present evolution as it is a theory of human origin along with \nChristian theistic creationism. Otherwise I don\u2019t see how a Christian \nparent can convince a kid evolution is false when the teaching institution \nthey are sending them off to receive an education instructs them that it\u2019s \ntrue or produces an atmosphere of hostility toward the Christian faith and \nin most case will tell them outright it\u2019s fairy tale.\n\nYou wrote: \u201cBut I want you to have to defend your position, to be able to \ncome back with a valid point, not just a quote from your religious book, \nwhich is more than likely not my religious book. If I quoted the Norse Edda \nto you as justification to my views, you would simply dismiss it as not \nbeing your religion, so in that regard I hope you see the contradiction.\u201d\n\nUnless the Norse Edda presents a reality in which the natural world can \nexist, intelligent life can exist, where there can be such a thing as \nknowledge, and therefore science, love, compassion, and universal morals, \netc., it is no better than Atheistic evolution, evolution of any flavor, or \nevery false religion out there. I can defend my position, because I can be \na scientist, a loving son, brother, father, husband who looks at murder, \nrape, sexual immorality, any \u201ccruel act\u201d and say it\u2019s bad not merely as an \nopinion or as a citizen of a particular country but objectively not \nsubjectively, dream, aspire, and much more because of a faith that can \nlogically produce all this experience. Take your atheistic evolutionist \nworldview if that is your faith, If you logically and critically think it \nthrough, start with one atom and build from there, tell me how far can you \ngo, explain how atoms can produce intelligence, logical thought, a mind \nwithout it just being molecules subject to the laws of physics and \nchemistry, happenings in the brain (if it can even reach that state).",

I said that the stories of Adam & Eve and Noah \nand the Ark may come from a previous outside account separate from the rest \nof the Torah. Moses and Abraham are some of the earliest first-person \naccounts and everything else in Genesis is likely metaphorical (Jesus used \nquite a lot of metaphor in his teachings). I noted similarities to the saga \nof Gilgamesh. Your point is simply that once this account was included, \nother prophets sited it. That doesn't argue against my point. Saying that \nJesus quoted from Genesis doesn't add validity to the story, it just means \nthat as a rabbi, Jesus learned the story and preached a sermon. And you \ncould argue that as the Messiah, what he said is the word of God, and \nyou're entitled to make that argument, but my interpretation is that Jesus \nwas reaching out to the Jewish community at the time and even then his \nteachings upset the pharocies because the thing Jesus said in his mission \nWAVERED FROM THE ACCEPTED DOGMA OF THE AGE. Jesus never said anything about \natoms and radio waves, but we don't refute their existence. God is \nsupposedly a being of infinite knowledge and wisdom, and I take the \nposition that Jesus chose not to explain things that we as humans would be \nunable to understand. As the son of God, I think Jesus could have told \npeople about airplanes and cell phones, but knowing people would think him \na madman, Jesus said nothing of it. Does that mean Christ could not foresee \ntheir existence? No one alive then would be at all affected by that \ninformation, and I feel it is the same with this issue. \n\n---\n\nAlso Moses gave us the Genesis account, not Abraham. \n\nYes, let's site the guy who was raised Egyptian in a polytheistic society \nas the true prophet for origin of Genesis. That really doesn't contradict \nmy point either.\n\n---\n\nJust disagree with the Bible, don't make God's word read what it clearly \ndoesn't.\n\nYou realize, I hope, that this statement is entirely the basis for the \nmyriad of Christian denominations. How would there be Catholicism, \nLutheranism, Presbyterianism, Methodism, etc, if the Bible was not open to \nvarious schools of interpretation?\n\n---\n\nDo you have evidence that substantiates your claim of content being omitted \nduring transcription?\n\nOne of my favorite examples is with the concept of hell versus Gahenna. In \nmany English translations, Gahenna is equated with hell, but contextually, \nGahenna was an actual place at the time of Christ. I've read various \naccounts of Gahenna being a place where sacrifices were performed and as \nsuch the Israelites believed it to be cursed and also i've heard it \ndescribed as a place in the Valley of Hinnom where they burned cadavers and \nrefuse. The point is that these are two very different concepts, hell being \na metaphysical afterlife while Gahenna is simply a place where things are \nthrown away.\n\nThere is the line in the Bible that \"one shalt not suffer a witch to live\" \nbut Solomon summons the Witch of Endor, which implies that the council he \ngains from the witch, as well as the means of summoning the witch, were \ndeemed permissible in the tenants of the time. In the original document in \nits original language, distinctions were made between orders that used \nmagic for evil. This comes up in documents regarding the Salem Witch Trials.\n\n---\n\nIt has to do with how you practice your faith, not like a hypocrite who \nwants attention from men only but as one essentially after God's own heart.\ufeff\n\nThe point of Matthew 6 is that you are expected to conduct your religion to \nfurther your own relationship with God, not to draw attention. The problem \nnon-Christians have with Creationists is that they constantly demanded to \nbe accommodated. It is not the purview of public education to cater to \nvarious religious institutions, and whether or not it conflicts with your \nreligion, the theory of evolution has testable merits and demonstrative \nevidence and is the accepted theory for the diversity of life. No one knows \nhow life STARTED on the planet. If you are Christian and you don't agree \nwith evolution, fine. The problems that arise is that there are \nnon-Christians who shouldn't have to be exposed to Creationism but because \nthis is your religion clearly your side is the right side. It is an \nintractable position which is why arguments like this happen. I am not so \nmuch trying to change your religious views as I am pointing out that my \nviews are going to be different from many others.\n\nThe other issue here is that electing to withdraw your children from \nlearning about evolution sets a dangerous precedent. If you shield your \nchildren from challenges to the doctrines of your religion, are you really \ndoing your children or your faith any real service? From a legislative \nside, it creates a situation in which one can cite a religious view and \nessentially demand an exemption. The government lacks the efficiency to \ndeal with everyday stuff, so I really don't want to see that go down the \nrabbit hole. But in the immediate consequence, you are not teaching your \nkids to defend their faith but rather to dig in their heels and essentially \nignore any argument, regardless of its validity. If this happens enough, \nyou get a sect of Christians that have a rather weird understanding of the \nsciences and problems meeting people in the middle. Rather than demand that \npeople not have to learn the theory of evolution, learn how to rectify your \nfaith with the world. You will not agree with everyone, as even as I write \nthis I concede I am unlikely to alter your position. But I want you to have \nto defend your position, to be able to come back with a valid point, not \njust a quote from your religious book, which is more than likely not my \nreligious book. If I quoted the Norse Edda to you as justification to my \nviews, you would simply dismiss it as not being your religion, so in that \nregard I hope you see the contradiction.\n\nWould you prefer your children be exposed the the Vedic origin of life on \nearth, or the Aztec creation story? You could take the part where it says \neverything bore fruit according to its kind that God created DNA to be \nself-sustainable, that as the world changed, life would change with it. All \nevolution states is that every organism has the genetics of its \nforebearers. We can demonstrate that genes change, mutations occur. This \nsimply means that everything is the cummulative mutations of its \nforebearers. That much is more or less indisputable.\n\n ",

If you think only the first \nfew chapters of Genesis conflict with evolution then what you know about \nthe Bible might amount to less than 1%. The scripture is uniform in it's \nmessage of salvation to man, the later revelations complements the earlier \ncontent. References are made all the time. The Genesis account is \nreferenced by God the Father and the Son, the prophets, etc. So that when \nGod speaks about the week (book of Exodus) and says that you work for six \ndays and rest on the seventh as he worked for six and rested on the \nseventh, it wouldn't make any sense to understand this any other way. When \nJesus speaks on marriage, he quotes Genesis about the Father making them \nmale and female and for this reason, the husband leaves his mother and \nfather and cleaves to his wife and the two become one flesh. Just disagree \nwith the Bible, don't make God's word read what it clearly doesn't. Since \nits the Bible that clearly speaks of other gods and religions as \nperversions of the truth, we would argue that Gilgamesh and all the other \nflood accounts are based on the actual historical flood event but because \ntheirs stories were not revealed by God who was a \"witness\" and can give an \naccurate account of it, they were transmitted through non-inspired methods \nand because they differ, we would argue they are in error. Also Moses gave \nus the Genesis account, not Abraham. It's likely Abraham never knew about \nit or asked to know about it. Moses received the account from God. Also get \nyour historical facts correct unless you don't care about accuracy in your \nclaims. The council Constantine oversaw was over Arian controversy that had \nto do with the Trinitarian doctrine, not Biblical canon. By 170AD the \nMuratorian list included all but 4 of the NT books and in the 3rd counsil \nof Carthage, all 27 books of the NT were affirmed. The counsils didn't \nchoose the books, they affirmed it. Apostacy and heresies forced the early \nchurch to have these affirmational meetings and documents.\nDo you have evidence that substantiates your claim of content being omitted \nduring transcription? We have over 20,000 manuscript copies in varying \nlanguages, we have numerous quotes of passages in early Church father \nwritings that prove otherwise. Any deviation is ridiculously low and \nwouldn't change the core meaning of the verse or passage (much less \"core \nprinciples\"). One final thing, it is so like a non Christian to misquote \nverses and passages like they've never learned a thing called context. \nJesus commands us not to judge others in the similar manner displyed by the \nreligious hypocrites (and in the same passage, keep reading) and to also \nrecognize the \"dogs\" and \"swines\". And on practicing your religion in \npractice? Are Atheists or non Christians just out of their minds? This is \ncoming from Jesus who sent his disciples to preach the Gospel (not just \nafter his resurrection but during his earthly ministry). It has to do with \nhow you practice your faith, not like a hypocrite who wants attention from \nmen only but as one essentially after God's own heart.",

Now it always happens to be \nprecisely yours that is the only right one not your neighbour's nor the \npastor down the street.\nAnd you know you are right because the book says so no other proof needed. \nNow does that not strike you as being arrogant?\nHats of to +Biaggio Snollygoster and +Nina O (I had similar 'sinful' \nthoughts like +Fuzzy Wuzzy after reading you comments, and I too am \nmarried) for trying to open your eyes and making you trying to see the real \nlight. Let me tell you Michael. I was raised very religious but even as an \n8 year old I had a hard time believing the stories of the bible. I could \nnot understand why all these voices, apparitions, miracles happened all the \ntime so long ago but we did not get to witness any in our time. I was \nfooled to be a Sunday school teacher for a while but in the end I realized \nit was all bogus. Thanks to a friend I finally took the step 2 years ago \nand confirmed to myself what I had felt all along. I am an atheist. It was \none of the best moments of my life. Now at 51 I still feel I have a whole \nlife ahead of me. I no longer need to worry about that big sugar daddy in \nheaven. The miracle of life is much better without religion.\nHitler was a confessed Catholic (as most Austrians were at the time). \nAmerica was founded by free masons and atheists. There is no mention of god \nin the bill of rights or the constitution (as a non-American I take it on \nFAITH what my atheist American brothers have told me).

I did not deny the part of woman not having authority over a man \nand not for them to teach a man. I responded to this in my first response. \nI said you made up the part of \"useless woman\". Where does God ever say in \nthe Bible that \"woman are useless\"? He commands them to not have authority \nover a man and to not teach a man (in the Church) but doesn't tell them \nthey're useless. And the fact that you can't separate the deeds of person \nfrom his words is ridiculous. Because he SAYS he's a Christian and SAYS \nhe's doing it for Christ means he must be Christian right? Even if he DOES \neverything opposite of what a Christian does? Does that mean if a man SAYS \nhe's a \"good man\" (rather than say he's a Christian) but DOES bad things, \nthen he must be a \"good man\". Stalin wasn't a Christian but an atheist, the \ndifference between him and Hitler is that Stalin openly was an atheist and \nwas doing those things consistant with Atheism, he had the \"might makes \nright\" mentality.

That\u2019s very typical of \npeople living in spiritual darkness to nick pick and poke fun at God\u2019s word \nwhen taken out of context or misquoted or made up (to which I can easily \nrespond) and to never answer the tough questions which your position can\u2019t. \nYour molescules in motion universe still has a huge gaping sink hole that \nyou can\u2019t plug up. I mentioned in my previous post that if the universe was \nnothing more than molecules in motion you couldn\u2019t have a mind much less \nhave morals or even be logical and no one in your lot has even tried to \nrespond to it intelligently. You\u2019re proving to be someone who doesn\u2019t care \nto be right for truth sake and that\u2019s why you revert to name calling, \nprofanity, and unwarranted teasing. You could knowingly be wrong (and you \nare) but as long as you receive cheers from all your likeminded pals, \nyou\u2019re content with it. I\u2019ll respond to your reply nevertheless.\n\nYou say right and wrong is in one\u2019s DNA. REALLY!!! (I shouldn\u2019t be \nsurprised at this but I\u2019m thinking many atheist believe this ridiculous \nidea) I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re equating right and wrong behavior with \ninstinctive behavior that you find in the animal world, like eating your \nyoung, mother animal fighting to the death to save her young, and all the \nother animal behaviors that animals do which is very predictable \nrespectively within each group. Humans are not animals (atheists like to \nbelieve they are, so they can excuse the despicable behaviors humans \ncommit), humans have minds, they can reason, think lofty thoughts, think \nlogically, dream, have aspirations, etc. Humans choose whether to do good \nor to sin. Human mothers can choose to save their children (or not) even if \nthe governing power over them orders them to have them killed (like Moses\u2019 \nmother) in contrast female hamsters for example will instinctly eat many of \ntheir young to (some theorize) increase the chance of survival of those \nremaining (was it a moral dilemma for the hamster mother?). Whereas animals \nwho do will always fight to the death to protect their young, human mothers \ncan give birth and choose to discard their children in the trashcan of a \npublic rest room (or not). And let\u2019s just suppose you are right, it\u2019s in \nour DNA, can anyone be held accountable for anything they do? You couldn\u2019t \nfault a person for slaughtering a crowd of people any more than having a \nf***k\u2019ed up penis from birth.\n\nYou also believe the government decides right from wrong? So Nazi Germany \nwas \u201cright\u201d in committing genocide to further the Arian \u201crace\u201d and if the \ngovernment makes into law forcing everyone to be baptize in the name of the \nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit, it\u2019d be right and you\u2019d comply? Homosexuality \nwas outlawed in many countries in the not so long ago past so it was right \nthen? (for the record homosexuality is a sin, salvation must be willingly \nreceived)\n\nBottom line, morality would be meaningless if all you had to work with was \nmolecules and motion. There be no obligatory authority; things just happen \nand one\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d would not be able less wrong than another\u2019s, might \nwould make right. In the same vein, how do you explain logic in a universe \nwhere all you have is molecules in motion? Think it through logically \nplease and see what ridiculous conclusions you arrive at.\n\nMoving on to your criticism of God\u2019s Word, it\u2019s plainly obvious to any \nBiblical minded Christian that you know very little to nothing about the \nBible and like to do what every opponent likes to do and take verses and \npassages out of context. Let\u2019s get the whole Hell/condemnation piece out of \nthe way first. The Gospel is the good news it\u2019s called that because its \nmessage is the only way to salvation. In contrast, the bad news is, \neveryone is guilty before a Holy God and rightly deserving of Hell and \nheading there after this life. But if you believe in Jesus as Lord and \nSavior, your sins are forgiven and Christ\u2019s righteousness is imputed to you \nso that in the presence of the Almighty Father, you\u2019re as one who has never \nsinned. Therefore If a Christian sins he doesn\u2019t go to Hell, he\u2019s already \njustified. If someone who claims to be a Christian who habitually sins and \nhas the mind of an unbeliever (God knows the heart, man can tell by the \n\u201cfruit\u201d produced), then he or she has never been saved. There are many \nwarnings in God\u2019s Word to His own to judge themselves lest they find \nthemselves to have never been saved. I could not call you or Hitler a \nChristian any more than you can call me an atheist (..you shall know them \nby their fruit). Matthew 7:21-23 \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, \nLord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven\u2026 And then will I declare to them, \n\u2018I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.\u2019\n\nYour attempts at trying to shock me with verses such as lusting at a woman \nin your heart is equivalent to adultery is right and true and Jesus was \ncorrecting people\u2019s misconceptions of sin. He pointed out that sin was \nnever merely the outward actions but lies in the heart. Sin has always been \na heart issue, so you could hate your brother without a cause in your heart \nand that would be equivalent to murder. That is why Jesus was crucified and \ndied but raised from the dead the third day. His resurrection is evidence \nthat His sacrifice was sufficient to forgive the sins of all who would \nbelieve in Him therefore saving them from Hell and giving them new lives to \nlive for God.\n\nOn the mangled penis, woman teachers, and the \u201cso much more\u201d subject, I \nwant to write this first. Why should it surprise Christians or matter to \nChristians that you disagree with God\u2019s judiciary standard that He imposed \non the nation of Israel? Why should it surprise Christians or matter to \nChristians that you disagree with God\u2019s moral law as revealed in His Word? \nYou speak as if there\u2019s this universal law or standard that you and I and \neveryone else has and therefore can judge the Christian God. I\u2019ll point out \nagain that your view of the universe (molecules in motion) cannot produce \nobligatory authority or a universal transcendent standard of moral \nbehavior. Killing a bus load of children is not morally wrong in a universe \ncomprised only of molecules in motion. Since the Christian worldview can \nproduce a universal standard (and everything else necessary for our \nexistence), the transcendent God with whom we have to give an account (and \nHe alone is not subject to what He imposes on His creation) can do whatever \nHe deems necessary and good. Logically He alone can define good and evil, \nright from wrong, etc.\n\nFor Deut. 23:1-8 (which includes deliberate disfiguring of the penis) these \nverses are for the preserving of the purity and honour of the families of \nIsrael, by excluding such as would be a disgrace to them. What form this \ntook is such that even Ruth (from Book of Ruth) a Moabite (v.3) became a \nconvert and entered into the genealogy of the incarnate Son of God. God\u2019s \nmercy and grace always triumphs.\n\nFor 1 Tim. 2:11-14 (women should not have authority over the man) the \n\u201cuseless women\u201d part is not in the Bible so is that you expressing your \nopinion? You took these verses out of context as usual. Cleary it\u2019s \nspeaking about church government. And no, it wouldn\u2019t be silly for an \neducated woman to raise a boy (boy not man there\u2019s a difference you know) \nto become an educated man. Elsewhere for example, (Eph. 6:1) children are \ncommanded to obey their parents (I don\u2019t think father alone constitutes \n\u201cparents\u201d). In 2 Tim. 1:5 it\u2019s implied that Timothy was trained in the \nfaith as a youth by his mother because his father was a Greek and \nunbeliever (Acts 16). God made the man the authority figure not only in the \nhome but in the Church but not to lord it over women but to love them as \nChrist His Church and gave Himself up for Her (Eph. 5:25). As head, he is \nresponsible for its success or failure, because even though it was Eve who \nwas deceived by the serpent, Adam forever shouldered the blame.\n\nSexual immorality is a serious sin deserving of death (that\u2019s the justice \nthat is rightly deserved but God is forgiving and gracious if one repents \nand believes in Christ), which includes adultery, prostitution, whoredom, \nsex with animals, same sex intercourse, etc. God wants to preserve purity \nand confine sex to one man and one woman in the marriage relationship.\n\nOn the subject of incest charged against God, you\u2019re an atheist, a \nmaterialist, you\u2019re an animal, a damn dirty ape, should incest matter, \ndoesn\u2019t this happen naturally in nature? Did homo sapiens in large numbers \nappear simultaneously on the scene throughout the earth and immediately \nthey avoided incest? You should think God that we don\u2019t commit incest today \n(Leviticus 18:6->, 20:11->). Here, you not only failed to understand the \nnecessity of \u201cincest\u201d in your own model but failed to credit the Christian \nGod for prohibiting it.\n\nSo in conclusion we\u2019re learned that Biaggio wasted a lot typing on the \nsubject of \u201cincest\u201d and needs to credit God for prohibiting it. He must \nthink women are stupid or useless because he fabricated that part when \nreferencing a passage. Evangelicals believe in the whole counsel of God \n(they don\u2019t pick and choose which books, passages, or verses to believe or \nnot believe \u2013 false Christians do that sort of thing) and Biaggio got very \nexcited thinking that I didn\u2019t. Hitler was no Christian regardless of his \ncampaign speech. And according to Biaggio\u2019s belief about government and \nmorals Nazi Germany was right in what they did to its \n\"undesireable\" citizens. He\u2019s yet to really give an intelligible response \nto my argument that a universe comprised of nothing more than molecules in \nmotion cannot produce universal morals meaning there cannot be right or \nwrong. Also I want to remind you all of the other truth I pointed in my \nprevious post, that there is no evidence for evolution; reptiles produce \nreptiles, dogs produce dogs, humans produce humans (not the x-men or \nFranco's Caesar).",

The exchange of ideas through civil discourse is what \ndemocracy is built on. Without it, we descend into anarchy. I do agree with \nyour statement about theists. Putting it bluntly, they have the right to be \nirrational morons. This is not to say that it is without consequence. Most \nof the younger folks are realizing the significance of education, and are \nfocused on practicing pragmatism instead of outdated ideologies that \ncontradict fact. Going back to what Neil has stated, \u201cReligion is an ever \nshrinking sphere of scientific ignorance\u201d. People in this country, per the \n1st Amendment, have the right to be uneducated idiots. The sociological \nconsequence, from what I can see, is the younger generation questioning and \nnaturally rebeling against antiquated ideologues. This will make way for \nthe next progressive steps and usher in new fresh ideas and new \ndiscoveries. I know it\u2019s an optimistic view, but the trends seem to be \nswinging in this direction.",

How old are you, and how long would it take a \nsingle gene, or a collection of genes, to spread throughout an entire \npopulation of organisms. Lets use lions as an example. A lioness reaches \nsexual maturity at the age of four, and the gestation period is about 3.5 \nto 4 months. How long would it take a single gene to spread throughout the \npopulation?\n\nAnd, there are observed instances of organisms adapting to new environments \nespecially in instances where humans have transplanted organisms to \nunfamiliar environments.\n\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080421-lizard-evolution.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon-eating_bacteria\nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/060901_mussels\nhttp://www.livescience.com/18276-lizards-show-evolution.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_mosquito\n\n\"and there should be many \"transitional\" forms that we could observe.\"\n\nWe must define our terms. Is it fair to say a transitional form is a \npopulation of organisms, extant or extinct, that represents an intermediate \nstate between two population of organisms that share apparent inherited \ntraits?\n\n\"What we see instead, of course, is an array of distinct \"kinds\" of plants \nand animals with many varieties within each kind, but with very clear and \n-- apparently -- unbridgeable gaps between the kinds. That is, for example, \nthere are many varieties of dogs and many varieties of cats, but no \"dats\" \nor \"cogs.\" Such variation is often called microevolution\"\n\nCan you define macroevolution?\n\n\"and these minor horizontal (or downward) changes\"\n\n\"Horizontal\" is definitionally opposed to \"downward\".\n\n\"Evolutionary geneticists have often experimented on fruit flies and other \nrapidly reproducing species to induce mutational changes hoping they would \nlead to new and better species,\"\n\nThese experiments have not been conducted by just geneticists. The goal of \nthese experiments were also not to produce a \"new and better species\". What \nis a \"better species\"? This terminology makes no sense. Additionally, the \ngoal of these experiments were never to explicitly produce \"new and better \nspecies\", it was to explore the development of reproductive isolation.\n\n\"but these have all failed to accomplish their goal. No truly new species \nhas ever been produced, let alone a new \"basic kind.\"\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html\n\n\"A current leading evolutionist, Jeffrey Schwartz, professor of \nanthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, has recently acknowledged \nthat....\"\n\nHe's a \"current leading evolutionist\"? How exactly does one get this title, \nand why does he deserve it? Who's decided that he's a \"current leading \nevolution\"? I'll tell you what this looks like to me; it looks like in a \ndesperate effort to quote mine you attached this label to Prof. Schwartz or \nsimply pasted the title from some creationist website that you pulled the \nquote from. Find me a larger excerpt that puts this quote in context, and \nI'll accept that he's not being misrepresented in any way.\n\nEven if this mid-sentence quote does present the same notion in a larger \ncontext, so what? This man can't be wrong? I already linked multiple \nsources that document multiple observed instances of multiple types of \nspeciation, both artificial and natural.\n\n\"The scientific method traditionally has required experimental observation \nand replication.\"\n\nI've already provided sources that fulfill both of these criterion.\n\n\"The fact that macroevolution (as distinct from microevolution) has never \nbeen observed would seem to exclude it from the domain of true science.\"\n\nDefine macroevolution.\n\nAnd, as I continue to search your quotes verbatim, I realize you've simply \nplagiarized an entire webpage (\nhttp://www.icr.org/home/resources/resources_tracts_scientificcaseagainstevolution/) \nand presented it as your own. This only makes me think my efforts were \nprobably a waste of time because, if you respond at all, it will simply be \nwith more plagiarized creationist articles.",

The freedom to believe in whatever you want \nis precisely so that we can openly question things without being hounded by \na state, it says nothing about your ideas being shielded from critique & \nit's as much anyones right to question the ideas.\n\nI'm an atheist as well (doesn't really mean anything where I'm from), but \nreligion is obviously a pretty problematic thing purely because it draws a \nline in peoples heads (to varying extents) of what is ok to question & so \nthey stop themselves from being fully rational in their approach to real & \nserious problems. It's a very bad mentality to have regardless of how great \nones intentions may be because of this fundamental problem that it \nfundamentally rejects reality at a certain point & in the modern world \nthat's the last thing we need people to do. \n\nIf you ask me religion isn't being questioned nearly enough in the states, \nmy only gripe with Cosmos in this regard is simply when they bring it up in \nthe middle of an intriguing scientific piece (as in I couldn't care less \nabout some two thousand year old myth when we're talking science). \nBut there's certainly room for a variety in how to talk about the subject & \nI'm all for that. \n\nWell anyway, that's a side topic, I was more curious about your actual \npoints against man made climate change?

I did not \nanswer you to \"defend\" Cosmos, maybe all your accusations are actually \njustified, I don't know (as I have said, I did not watch it).\n\nHowever, I commented here to tell you this:\nIf the majority of climate scientists (actual scientists, not people like \nme as you have pointed out correctly) believe with an astounding majority \nin climate change we should trust them this time and do something about it.\n\nImagine a similar case:\nA meteor is falling towards earth and the scientists say that the \nprobability of it hitting the earth is, let's say 80%. Also they say the \nnearer the meteor is coming, the more accurately can they say whether it \nwill hit. Now, the problem is, once the accuracy hit's, lets say 95%, we \nare too late to send Bruce Willis (little joke) to save us and the meteor \nwill hit earth. Now, we can deal something with the meteor right now, to \nsave the earth completely. Of course, this saving action costs a lot of \nmoney. Do you think we should discuss about saving the planet from the \nmeteor until it is too late but we know 100% for sure that it is hitting \nus? Of course not, we need to deal with it right now, even if there is the \nsmall percentage that the meteor is not hitting us in the first place.\n\nIt is the same with climate change: We should do something about that right \nnow before it is too late. Maybe we get lucky and there was no climate \nchange in the first place. But the probability is so high that I (and I am \ncertain there are a lot of very smart guys who agree with me) think it is \nnot to be risked. Even if it means that we have to sacrifice some of our \nwealth for it.\nAgain, I agree with you being skeptical about climate change. So am I, \nhowever: Know your place! Let 97% of climate scientists do their job \nbecause, after all, why do we have them to warn us about things like that \nif we don't listen to them when they have something to say?",

Humans that came out of Africa may not have \nbeen as dark as the native Africans we see now, since it's believed ethnic \nvariations on started to occur about the time human migration was well \nestablished.

It's my understanding that almost all \nAmerican's of African decent have Caucasian \"blood\" in their DNA, so there \ncould be a reason there somehow.

You have always oppressed others, earlier it was \ncrusading and killing and persecuting now it is by shitting on separation \nof church and state and influencing legislation with religious beliefs. I'm \nsure you know of some examples, if you don't, ask and I will gladly give \nyou a list.\n\n2. You aren't \"defending\" your beliefs. You're spouting them on a video \nwhere they aren't welcome. And the majority, almost all of, the comments \nyour kind has made on this video have been stupid, overused, redundant \narguments and accusations. This is not a defence of your beliefs. This is \nspouting bullshit.\n\n3. If you comment an unpopular and stupid opinion on YouTube, motherfucker \nEXPECT retaliation. We WILL accuse you of being retarded if you try to make \nthe argument that your stupid, primitive, immoral book is the absolute \ntruth. We WILL call you unscientific (which you fucking are) if you believe \nin creation and all the stories in the Bible. We WILL accuse you of trying \nto pull humanity back into the dark ages because you fucking ARE, by \nspouting this stupid bullshit to us. THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND. If you \nbelieve in the Bible and hence if you believe that God created the earth, \nyou WILL be called absolute MORONS. Fucking deal with it, whiny little \nbitch. Just like you have the right to post your insipid bullshit here, we \nhave the right to mock you. And we will make good use of that right, be \nfucking sure of that. You have been rebutted and refuted and debunked \nthousand of times, your stupid arguments, your idiotic points, etc. Yet you \ndo not listen, and how can you, religion has closed your mind so much, you \nrefuse to believe in anything else, however logical it may be.

And that \nconforms to NO scientific standard of evidence, moron. \n\n\"Not all Christians are the fucking westboro babtist church, most of us are \nthe nicest people you will ever meet.\"\n\nActually, technically, the Westboro baptist Church, while being despicable \nfucks, still are 'better' Christians, so to speak. They strongly believe in \nthe clearly laid out rules of the Bible with a conviction. They are the \ntrue Christians, just like the Muslims who bomb \"infidels\" are true \nMuslims, because the Quaran clearly states that this is the ultimate form \nof self-sacrifice, and they will receive an externity of pleasure in heaven \nfor doing this. It's you semi-liberal middle-ground Christians who are \nactually not abiding by your book 100%. \nAnd I know, the argument you will try to put up against this is that \"the \nBible is a metaphor\" or whatever. Bullshit. By changing the meanings of \nsome clearly written texts in the Bible condoning rape, slavery, \npedophilia, etc. YOU are the one who is twisting the meaning of the book, \nfor it is extremely difficult to translate \"If a man is caught in the act \nof raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of \nsilver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he \nviolated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. \" into anything \nmoral (by today's standards of morality, for it is subjective).\n\nAnd no, you cannot make that generalization about Christians.

Catholacism departed from the teachings of \nthe New Testament and combined it with pagan influence and OT laws-such a \nseperate priesthood-ture for the OT but the NT every believer is a priest \nand a minister. Denominations tried to get back to the original scripture \nwhich the catholc system had withheld from the people so they could add man \nmade rules that they claimed were equal to but in most cases contradicted \nthe teachings of Jesus and His Apostles. Division when realized should spur \npeople to look to the original to see what is wrong and can it be \ncorrected.

The Ancient Greek word used in \nMatthew is \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 (plerosai). It means fulfill alright, but do you \nactually use a Modern Greek dictionary for your Bible studies? What did \nthey teach you at seminary?

Seriously, it's like me getting my physics \nfrom Aristotle)\n\n*On the cross he said \"It is finnished\"*\n\nFirst, I usually don't fret over spelling, but it's \"finished\". Written \nlike that, It looks as though he meant \"turned into something coming from \nFinland\", and it's really distracting.\n\nSecond, you do realize that this interpretation of \"finished\" is one among \nmany possibilities. Personally, I'd say that means that the whole ordeal is \ndone and his mission complete -- which, btw, isn't quite accurate, since he \nstill have to resurrect at this point to actually establish the \"new \nreligion\". Without resurrection, no christianity.\n\nI know that you don't consider my interpretation as worthwhile, since I'm a \nlowly atheist raised catholic who knows nothing, and you hold the Truth, \nbut it's still a valid one.\n\nRegardless, that doesn't take into account \"until Heaven and Earth has \npassed away\" in Mat. 5:18.\n\nI'm looking at biblehub right now, with commentaries from half a dozen \ntheologians, and the general consensus isn't that it means \"when it's \naccomplished\" (which according to you happened on Good Friday):\n\n*but He says: **onwards to the destruction of the world the law will not \nlose its validity in the slightest point**, by which popular expression \n(Luke **16:17**; Job **14:12**) the duration of the law after the final \ncatastrophe of the world is neither taught nor excluded. That the law, \nhowever, fulfilled as to its ideal nature, will endure in the new world, is \nclear from 1 Corinthians 13:3 (\u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7); 1 Peter **1:25**; 2 Peter 3:3 \n(\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7).*\n[Meyer's NT Exegetical Commentary]\n\nWhat do you make of that?",

I attended \nBible College and Seminary and I have a greek text beside me so don't get \nall high and mighty with me.. Ekplirono (greek word in english) translates \nto fill or complete as in fulfill your duties. In Matthew 5:17 ff Jesus \nsignifies that he came not to tear up or destroy the OT law, scripture was \ninspired but it also pointed to his coming and accomplishing his mission. \nHe completed the OT law with regard to ceremonial law, sacrificial law, etc \nbecause he kept them all and thus could become the perfect sacrifice, the \nfinal sacrifice. On the cross he said \"It is finnished\". Why is this \nsignificant? In matthew 5:18 Jesus says the law remains until \"all is \naccomplished\" guess what, he accomplished what the law prepared for him to \naccomplish. In the immediate context how does he describe the law. Five \ntimes he says \"you have heard that it was said\" and then follows with\"but I \nsay to you\". Thereby demonstrating that his law takes the place of moses \nlaw. And it isn't in terms of continuing all the OT laws but his new \ncovenant laws. During the last supper he gave the disciples the cup which \nrepresented his blood and called it the NEW COVENANT not the continuation \nof the Old.\n\nThe book of Matthew was written to prove from the Jewish Scriptures that \nJesus fulfilled the requirements of messiahship. Matthew often said Jesus \nacted \"to fulfill\" what was said through one prophet or another (Matthew \n1:22; 2:5, 15, 17, 23; 4:14; 8:17, etc.). One can read through the book of \nMatthew and note all the times that a reference is made to the Old \nTestament as being fulfilled in Jesus. It is surprising, indeed.\nJesus said in Matthew 3:15 that \"all righteousness\" should be fulfilled in \nhis actions. Luke 24:25-27, 44-45 and John 5:39-47 are also instructive on \nthis point. These verses show that Jesus was interested in showing how the \nHebrew Scriptures had himself as their object. He was the Messiah of whom \nall the Jewish holy writings had spoken of.\nThe Tyndale New Testament Commentary on Matthew offers another view of \n\"fulfill.\" It emphasizes that Jesus was bringing the meaning of the \nScriptures to their intended completion. It says: \"Jesus is bringing that \nto which the Old Testament looked forward; his teaching will transcend the \nOld Testament revelation, but, far from abolishing it, is himself its \nintended culmination\" (page 114).",

Telling us about how adding \nup the 'begats' led to an understanding of the age of the earth reminds me \nof every anti-christian rant I've ever heard from atheists. Like atheists, \nNeil has failed to grasp even an iota of what ancient writings have told us \nabout people's understanding of the early earth and creation. Like most of \nthe idiots, who do not care to understand before they dispute, he has come \nto the conclusion that the Bible says all men were created from Adam. Had \nhe even the slightest understanding of Judaism or Christianity he would \nhave known that Adam was the beginning of a line of people that were \ncreated  in response to the beings observed to already inhabit earth. Adams \nline was created with something extra that the other humans didn't have and \nlater God allowed humans that were not of that line into the fold. To make \nsimplistic statements about things you don't understand makes you seem \nfoolish, like Neil and most atheists, and reveals that you like to go \nagainst truth instead of striving for a deeper understanding of it. Neil \nfeeds you lies about how the Universe started instead of revealing that we \ndon't really know and have had to make tremendous leaps in order to keep \noriginal theories. The Big Bang, for instance, was the invention of a \npriest from the eighteen hundreds and current deep space observation casts \nmuch doubt on it. He wants you to believe in dark energy and dark matter \neven though they are only mathematical constructs to describe observed \nresults which don't match what we thought gravity could do. We don't even \nknow what causes or transmits the effects of gravity. Dips in spacetime \ncan't account for the severe gravitational pulls we see from supermassive \nobjects so that is another lie Neil passes to us from Einstein. Everything \nyou think is true is only a shadow of the truth seen through welding \ngoggles. Scientists may be on a journey to discover truth but they have as \nyet discovered little. If you think you're too smart to be worshiping at \nthe church of God then why are you worshiping at the church of science? \nHave you been diligent and vetted what scientists say or do you just take \nit as gospel? Or is the truth that you don't want to read, you prefer to \njust be handed your beliefs by another person and that's why you don't know \nanything about science or religion?\ufeff",

Do you think it's a magic glowing book that no one has ever been \nable to change or bastardize. Do you not know that many bibles were written \nthat included various texts not present in others? The truth is that the \nBible is a compendium of books, chosen from hundreds, written by believers \nin the one true God and spanning centuries. Instead of seeing the truth \nthrough your ancestors eyes, educated and not, you instead try to find \nfault in individual lines or books. Do you really think the people back \nthen could have informed you better considering they didn't have the words \nor languages you have today? Instead of thinking you are all so intelligent \nthat you are capable of naysaying the works of generations of humans who \nwere smart enough to write when few could, and willing to use precious \nresources to record that information you might instead try to learn \nsomething and imagine what they were trying to teach with their limited \nvocabulary. A world of people felt the truth in their hearts and followed \nthe God that brought that truth, few with any books to read and many with \nbut one book written by a single author. Just because you are spiritually \nempty does not mean there aren't many spirits to partake of. Ask other \nreligions what spirits they partake of and or believe in. I guarantee you \nthat the vast majority of them know of and even revere Yahweh and Jesus \nbecause there is record of then in their own texts. The texts that Neil \nuses to form your truth are full of errors and omissions. Most of them were \noutdated when Neil read from them in school and the rest have become so \nsince we started exploring deep space with the hubble telescope. Our \nunderstanding of gravity, expansion, the weak force, strong force and \nlightspeed all garbage since the millennium. Many scientists are now \nturning back to ether theory to try and find some middle ground to stand on \nwhile others look to a new electrical theory of matter and existence. The \ntruth is that you know little, if any, truth and the same goes for Neil. \nHe's giving you florid bullshit in the place of science but you don't know \nthat because you don't keep up with science you just like it handed to you \nwith good graphics. You think my belief in God shows my lack of scientific \nunderstanding but this is only a belief you hold. I, on the other hand, \nknow that your belief in the bullshit Neil spreads shows you know nothing \nabout science or cosmology because if you did you would be challenging his \nassertions instead of accepting them without fact checking. You fact \nchecked the bible, what about Neil? Ask yourself why there doesn't seem to \nbe enough mass in galaxies to hold them together and if making up an \nun-seeable, invisible force that outweighs all of creation is the answer. \nYou are praying to a false God and Neil is lying with a straight face.

And the thing that pisses me \noff the most is no matter how I try to word this comment, if it doesn't \nresonate with the belief system that somebody out there already upholds, it \nwill be met with a counter argument that will undoubtedly miss my point.\n\nPeople, for the most part, are stubborn and arrogant, especially in this \nday and age where there are so many arguments and counter arguments on what \nis and is not to be believed. As a result, some people who were not extreme \nin their belief systems before have begun drawing a line in the sand as to \nwhich side they are on. And if Atheism wants to claim the moral and \nintellectual high ground, why do I come across so many that act like c$#ts? \nI thought you were smarter than that? That's typical of any extremist that \npreaches their belief system, but the creationists have an excuse, they're \n\"stupid and don't know any better\". Not my words, just a summary of what \nmany atheists that I have come across think. So, atheists, if you're going \nto claim to be on the intelligent side of the argument, you can fuck off \nyour smug attitudes and mockery, it is unbecoming of one who claims to be \nintelligent. As for creationists, stop arguing with atheists, all things \naside, it is actually a stupid thing to do for it will achieve nothing. \nKeep your preachy ways to yourself, we don't want to hear about it and \nyou'll save yourself from looking stupid.\n\nThe people who I can't stand are the ones who would make attempts to \nconvert the beliefs of others to their own line of thinking. Those people \nwho would feel pleasure from destroying someone's belief structure and \nhappiness because they think it is more important that everyone thinks like \nthey do, even if it makes everyone else miserable in the process.

Look, I can understand that you \nbelieve/think in a certain way, and that's cool. Do I agree with it? Maybe \nnot,but I wouldn't bash the hell out of you for what you think. Makes Cenk \nlook like an ignorant ass, that's talking out of his ass. Cenk has no \nrespect for religion, nor respect for anyone having a spiritual (let's just \ncut out religion here) mind set.\n\nCenk, get off your high horse. You mock people, you bash them for what they \nbelieve, even if it might be wrong, you have no tact when it comes to \ndealing with such people. Which shows me how you are the type of person \nthat you hate. And that's a Bully.

I suppose (this is a widely held \nspeculation as far as I know) what the myth of the flood is referencing is \nthe flooding of the area that today is the Black Sea, when after the last \nIce Age the sea level rose to the point where the waters of the \nMediterranean Sea began forming and spilling out over the Bosporus strait \nand within a really short period of time (by geological terms) created the \nBlack Sea. Until then, all that existed there was a large freshwater lake \nwith a significantly (significantly enough) lower sea level than the \nMediterranean, so it was flooded and raised to the ocean's level.\n\nObviously that's a big chunk of land we're talking about here, and this \nwould have forced everyone living there to get moving and find a new place \nto live VERY QUICKLY, and I guess not a large percentage of the population \nthere made it out alive and well. Hence \"flood\" and \" 'biblical' \ncatastrophe\". It happened many thousand years ago, but tales of this might \nhave been handed down all the way to the Hebrews.",

Okay, just off the top of my head, the Earth and the universe are \nbillions of years old, not thousands.  There was never a point in history \nwhen there were only \"two\" people, i.e., Adam and Eve never existed.  The \nEarth was formed through natural processes over the time frame of anywhere \nbetween 50 million to 100 million years.  It was not \"created,\" and \ncertainly not in 7 days.  The universe in its current form is a result of \nthe Big Bang around 13 and a half billion years ago.  I'm relatively \ncertain that the universe was not \"spoken\" into existence by a transcended \ncosmic wizard; unquestionably not 6000 years ago.  Ah, and let's not forget \nthe Bible has light and vegetation before the sun, there is no evidence of \nany global flood, incongruencies regarding the diversity of life and the \norigin of life, the list goes on and on, and on, and one...\n\nReally, it would be easier to say what the Bible got right instead of what \nit got wrong, which is most of it.",

We know what was in the \nSeptuagint as well as we know that Aristotle existed and what he wrote. \nAnything that disagrees with that is an obvious outright lie.  Again, \nAristotle's words disagree with universal gravitation, and Job's words \nagree with universal graviation.  The words are known to be in their \ncurrent state in 270BC with very little doubt. Saying they were not is \nabout like saying that Aristotle did not really exist.\nTo say that Job plagiarized the Greeks, you have to explain why Job was \nmore accurate than the Greeks.",

A recent discovery in Egypt shows that is certainly not \ntrue. A copy of the  Gospel of Mark carbon dates to the late 1st century \nC.E and was found . Given the distance from Jerusalem to Egypt it is very \nreasonable to conclude Mark was written shortly after Jesus' death.  It \nwould take some time to get to Egypt from Jerusalem. That was a long \njourney back then. And even finding it in the late 1st century is like \nwriting about the great depression in the late 20th century. I talked to my \ngrandparents who lived during the great depression many times about that \ntime period. They actually saw it.

According to you, Job could \nhave been born even before Aristotle.  Even if he was not born before \nAristotle, his correct scientific statements contradicted Aristotle's.\n\nJob said that they were not attached to anything but the sky was spread out \nover empty space.  At a minimum, Job was more correct.  At the perfect \nexact correctness expected from God, we can say that the sky can include \npoint energy as easily as it can planets and stars. The clear concept \nstated by Job is that planets are not attached to anything. They are spread \nout over empty space and suspended on nothing (I have taken generalized \nsuspending the earth on nothing to include the other planets, but that is \nnot a stretch of the concept because he said God spread the sky over empty \nspace).  The point energy thought to fill space is not at all excluded by \nJob.  Job said God put objects in empty space, there are no crystalline \nspheres moving the planets,which is the contrary concept.  The so call \nfabric of space is not thought to move the planets.\n\n You wrote:'Until you can provide evidence for the authenticity of the \noriginal texts there is no reason to accept them as evidence, it would not \nbe the first time religious scripture has been altered after the fact\"\n\nYou are the one making the accusation that someone lied and plagiarized you \nhave the burned of proof. Innocent until proven guilty. History says that \nthe book of Ezekiel was written well before 570BC. It referred to Job, and \nI have seen zero proof that anyone altered it after the fact. And like I \nsaid, even if Job was born after the Greeks, what would it matter, if Job \nwas also more correct on other points? Newton read the book of Job. He \ncould have thought about Job's comment when he read that.  I did  not say \nNewton took the idea from Job, I am saying he could been influenced by \nJob's correct scientific statement that disagreed with the Greeks.\n\nYou wrote:\"Why do Christians cry at funerals if the truly believe their \nloved ones are happy and safe in heaven and that they will be reunited \nagain?\"\nI already answered that question.  I don't cry at funerals if the person is \na Christian. Some might cry because they will not see them again for a long \ntime, or they lack faith and do not  truly believe in heaven.\n\nHow come you keep asking me the same questions multiple times and then ask \nas if somehow I am avoiding the question because it is too hard? You are \nnot even asking me tough questions. It is boring to answer the same easy \nquestions over and over again.\n\nYou wrote:\"What evidence can you cite supporting the validity of the bible? \nparticularly in regards to a global flood, talking animals/plants, and the \nearth being flat.\"\n\nThe flood was explained by giving you a link and I brought up several keep \npoints, like the sea creature fossils in the Grand Canyon, which is 400 \nmiles away from the ocean right now. By definition, a flood is water moving \nto an area it is  usually not at.\n\nYou wrote:\"What evidence do you have that Job ever really existed?\"\nNone. I have a text known to exist that referrs to him. The book of Job did \nexist prior to 600 BC according to history books and some scientific \nstatements in that book agree with Newton's universal gravitation and \ndisagree with Aristotle's ether.  Someone wrote the book of Job and made \naccurate scientific statements that the Greeks did not understand.\n\nYou wrote:\"Who wrote each of the books that make up the bible? and what \nevidence do you have supporting their sanity and integrity?\"\n\nDaniel predicted the day that Jesus would ride into Jereluism and declare \nhimself the Messiah and the book of Daniel is very well known to have \nexisted in several different languages hundreds of years BC. IF the book of \nDaniel being written before Jesus walked the earth is not a fact, then \nnothing else can be called a historical fact from that time period either.  \nNo Greeks can be referred to exist, IF the book of Daniel did not exist. It \nis considered a historical fact just as Aristotle existing is a historical \nfact.\n\nYou Wrote:\"Since the bible claims that animals and plants can speak, the \nearth is flat, humans can live for centuries, global floods, and all sorts \nof other nonsense... what logical reason is there to believe any of it?\"\nI have answer this question before if not several times.

Why do people find it \nnecessary to downgrade christianty? is it inconsistency in humanity or GOD?\n  \nin the years the Papacy power was strong they went around killing people \njust so they can pay tithe that is fact. that's not Christianity. The \nPapacy say they can atone for sins yet the Bible says only Jesus is the way \nthat's inconsistency in humanity not GOD. \n\nNo one has any evidence that something was made billions of years ago \nbecause nothing was here even 10000 years ago. Either Moses is a big liar \nor he was right id believe someone who had a so called \"first hand account \nof events than someone that wasn't there at all.\"\nThe bible can be both archaeologically found to be true if you use the \nstories of the Bible that could have evidence.\n \nEvery thing can be explained through the bible yet people say noooooo that \ndidn't happen. Jesus was the predicted Messiah, he was predicted to come \nhundreds if not thousands of years before he did. The Bible also has the \npossible way that this Earth has turned out the way it has.\n\nAtheism has too much inconsistency and you would be able to figure that on \nyour own if you weren't being too much of yes im right and you're wrong.\n\nThe Bible is evidence all the way through. from first hand experience. you \nweren't there you don't know neither do I so id believe someone who was. \n\nBtw on the Noah story you're right, GOD did create mass genocide but let me \nask you something, if an uncountable amount of your family were getting \nkilled at every second what would you do as GOD? you're taking out the \nlogical reasons and being plain ignorant.\n\nI understand Atheism too but it has way too much inconsistency. The bible \ndoesn't have any inconsistency at all. the so called \"Christians\" do.\n\nIf you cant understand GOD's reasons then you have no hope of understanding \nthe true GOD.    \ufeff",

The Torah was written over several hundred years by various \nauthors.\nAll serious scholars agree on that.  The apostles did NOT write the 4 \nsynoptic Gospels - first, Jesus had no disciples named Mark or Luke. \nSecondly, the NT was written in \"koine\" Greek - Jesus' 12 followers spoke \nAramaic and certainly weren't educated men who would have known Greek. The \nGospels were written by Greek Christians decades after the alleged events \noccured. We see this clearly because their understanding of Judaism was \nlimited - no Jew thought the moshiach (messiah) was divine. The messiah is \njust a political/religious leader who would arise to save Israel in a time \nof troubles.  Also, the imagery of the \"lamb of god\" is incorrect - lamb is \nserved at Passover and does NOT have anything to do with sacrifice for sin. \n The sin sacrifice was made by the high priest on Yom Kippur and the \nsacrifice was a bull, not a lamb. Greek Christians, not knowing this, \nmistakenly thought Jesus' death around the time of Passover had some \nsacrificial symbolism.  But they were mistaken.",

I certainly did not claim that evolution \nis needed for computers. Or did I say 100% of scientists believe in \nevolution (I said \"most\"). Also I stated multiple times that evolution has \nnothing to do with \"something from nothing.\" Stop bringing this to \ndiscussion.\n\nAlso, you said \"how can anyone convince you that evolution is nonsense when \nit is and you still believe in it.\" I've stated multiple times that all it \ntakes is a piece of evidence that is inconsistent with the theory \n(disproof) or an alternate explanation that is more probable. In fact, most \nscientifically literate people are Bayesian thinkers. We don't really \nbelieve anything 100%, and we are always ready to be wrong. We are never \n100% confident in anything we believe. This is why we can make discoveries \nand make adjustments to knowledge unlike religious fundamentalists who \nreference their \"holy books\" as infallible axioms. So before you have a \nbetter explanation or a disproof, please don't call this theory nonsense. \nIt's the most solid theory there is right now. \n\nYou are claiming there is no evidence for evolution because YOU are not \nseeing them disregarding observations made by scientists who actively seek \nthese using better equipment and methods. Simply Google for evolutionary \nmutation examples. I find examples in bacteria such as E Coli more \nbelievable because of their fast reproduction cycles. It showcases the \neffect of evolution better.\n\nAlso, the reason why we can't see \"apes to humans\" examples is because it \ntakes too long for us to see it. However if we can detect a few changes \nduring a reasonable course of time, we can logically conclude that over \nmany more years, these changes will accumulate and achieve a much more \ndramatic result.

Evolution does not explain origin of life. It only simplifies it. \nWe have no idea what sparkled life in the first place. Evolution just \nexplains that extremely complex life forms can be derived from very very \nsimple life forms. It made the mystery of life a bit simpler. There are \nactually a great deal of Christians who believe both in evolution and \nintelligent design (especially Catholics). Fundamentalists don't like the \ntheory because it's inconsistent with Genesis. I call evolution a theory \nbecause it is a theory. But it is the only viable theory right now, so it \nis regarded as a fact in scientific community just like gravity, \nrelativity, quantum theory, and electromagnetism.",

For instance M-theory and string theory. They \nassume we are a 3D world (universe) inside a more dimensional space. Lots \nof other 3D universes exist next to us in this multidimensional space. Some \npeople would argue this is far fetched, but think about it: we used to \nthink we lived in the only solar system in this vast space. Then we \ncorrected this, and we assumed multiple solar systems exist and we believed \nwe were living in the only galaxy. Then we corrected this, and now we know \nthere are much more galaxies in the universe. At this point we believe \nthere is only 1 universe, but why wouldnt there be many more?\n\nM-theory suggests the big bang could have been caused by the collision of 2 \nbranes (2 universes), and that's where our material came from.\nSo you'll probably say 'but then this multidimensional space needs an \nexplanation, and that explanation is god'. But this isn't true. Since time \nexists inside universes, the multidimensional space (in which our universe \n'floats') may not have a time dimension, and could therefore be 'eternal' \n(although this word loses its meaning if there is no time dimension).\nSo this space could have always existed, and the universes could come into \nbeing in this space.\nThat's of course a very simplistic version, if you truly want to understand \nM-theory you'll have to study physics and understand complex mathematics.",

                    "text": "+Mike Chrisman So you don't *exactly* know what the Big Bang is. You have a \ngood grasp of it, but some serious misconceptions too.\n\nAnd please, keep in mind that what follows is not meant to belittle you \n(i.e. \"Look at the stupid christian\") but only to demonstrate how your \npremise \"nothing became something\" (which would be quite a feat) is based \non your own misunderstanding and not the theory itself.\n\nI also assume (and hope) that you're ready to actually read what follows \nand at least consider it, and think about it, as opposed to dismiss it with \na bible verse or a \"I know because I know\". :) Whether you choose to \nbelieve it is up to you, I'm not trying to convert you, just to explain. \nUnfortunately, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nSO:\n\nFirst a very short version:\n\nThe whole universe used to be very hot and very dense. It's expanding and \ncooling, which allows the creation of elements, stars and planets through \nlaws and forces.\n\nNow, the very long one:\n\n*>>  the universe was smaller than an atom at some point, <<*\n\nThe \"universe\" here is the whole thing. All matter and energy, but also \nforces and space-time. This last point is very important. \n\n\"Smaller than an atom\", \"at some point\" is a misrepresentation, and a bit \nbesides the point. The first two tenets of the BBT are:\n\n*1. The whole universe used to be almost infinitely hot* (lots of \nconcentrated energy)\n\n*2. The whole universe used to be almost infinitely dense* (lots of \nconcentrated matter)\n\nUnder such extreme conditions, matter and energy don't behave like we're \nused to. Fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong \nforces) are merged. There are no molecules, no atoms, no protons, electrons \nor neutrons. On quantum level, even the basic quarks don't exist as such. \nOnly a soup of matter and energy with very little structure. Time and space \n(space-time, actually, one single thing) don't exist either. It's almost \ninfinitely compressed and slowed to the point of non-existence.\n\nSo you can't have \"smaller than an atom\" (no space => no size), or \"at some \npoint\" (no time). The whole universe is in another state, a bit like water \nbecomes solid (ice) when it's cold and gaseous (steam) when it's hot.\n\nThe best example of such a different state would be neutron stars \n(pulsars), which have been observed multiple times (so we *know* they \nexist, we've seen and analysed them, they're fact). A typical neutron star \nhas a 20 km diameter (12.5 miles) and the mass of eight Suns. Due to \ndensity, gravity and EM are so high that the core is reduced to a \"neutron \nsoup\" (hence the name). No elements, no atoms, no protons, no electrons, \nonly neutrons. A neutron star is in another state than, say, the Sun, and \nlots of weird things happen around and within it, including to space-time.\n\nThe next step would be a black hole. Even higher density, so much so that \nlight itself can't escape the gravitational pull and time slows down to a \nnear full stop if you're close enough.\n\nTake that even further, and you have what the whole universe used to be: no \ntime, no space, forces merged, matter and energy so concentrated they don't \nbehave like they would under our current \"normal\" conditions.\n\n\n*>> that particle HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE, it can't be in \"nothing\" and just \nblow up and start expanding, and then how does that little particle turn \ninto planets and the sun? hm... tell me that <<*\n\nIt's not a *particle*. Not even close. It's much more than that (see above).\n\n*\"had to be somewhere\"*. Sure, but remember that \"somewhere\" means \nsomething different than \"at some place\" since there's no space as we \nunderstand it.\n\nWe don't know \"where\" the universe was, so I won't tell you it was like \nthis and that. We're still looking into it. Taking a look at M Theory \n(Multiverses, 11 dimensions) gives a satisfying answer *to me* : the \nuniverse was and still is in a dimension beyond the four we know and \nperceive. But not everybody agrees on that, and while it's mathematically \nsound (or so I'm told, I don't pretend to understand math at this level), \nit hasn't been strictly observed yet.\n\nSo now that we've established what the universe was according to the BBT, \nhere's the third and last tenet:\n\n*3. The universe is expanding*\n\nThis is observed via light shifting (Doppler effect), and we also have good \nsnapshots of the universe shortly after the BB (Cosmic Microwave Background \nand recently, gravitational lines forming, the latter being the closest and \nmore direct proof we've ever had. Yay!).\n\n*But no explosion here, just expansion*. Very, very fast at the beginning, \nbut no detonation (meaning no detonator). The BBT doesn't state what caused \nit, why it happened (we can hypothesize, though) and even when (we have a \npretty good idea, but it's not part of the BBT).\n\n*>>and then how does that little particle turn into planets and the sun?<<*\n\nWow. I'm gonna try to summarize as much as possible, but it's a hard one to \nexplain in a post, considering I don't know what your knowledge of physics \n(general and quantic) and cosmology is. So let's try to densify information.\n\nKeep in mind: *this is not a little particle. This is the whole universe. \nAll matter, all energy, all space-time, all forces*.\n\nOnce the universe starts expanding, a lot of things happen. First, it \nchanges state (we call those states \"Epoch\"). Time-space happens and laws \nare established (google String Theory for a nice and quite poetic possible \nexplanation of how this laws are established), forces separate, starting \nwith gravity and each with their own respective \"strength\". In our \nuniverse, for instance, gravity is very weak compared to electro-magnetism.\n\nThe universe starts to cool (energy isn't as concentrated) but it's still \nvery hot and dense, and matter and energy all interact very quickly via \ncollisions and others things happening at quantum level. They start \norganizing. First into photons, quarks (up and down, mainly), and other \nquantic thingies, then subatomic particles (neutrons, protons and \nelectrons), then the first atom: Hydrogen. From there, Helium (very stable) \nand other more fragile or unstable elements such as Deuterium or Lithium, \nbut in small quantity, because they're unstable or fragile. All this takes \nvery little time (less than twenty minutes). Past this time, the universe \nhas reached a new state where it isn't dense and hot enough anymore for \nthis reactions / interactions to happen. \n\nDoesn't matter, though, the basic bricks are now here, and forces too to \nbind them all and turn them into many different things. Gravity will cause \naccretion, which is the way things tend to stick together to form bigger \nthings with larger mass. With time, accretion creates bodies massive enough \n- with enough core pressure - that the first thermonuclear reaction can \noccur: fusion (atoms are pressed together so hard they merge and form a \nnew, heavier element). This produces energy and light, and many other \nthings. But more importantly, the first stars are born.\n\nStars are elements factories, mainly via thermonuclear fusion. Depending on \ntheir mass, they can produce new elements by fusing Hydrogen atoms together \ninto Helium then on to heavier elements by combination, the limit being \ndetermined by the mass of the star. Our Sun produces Helium, Oxygen, \nCarbon, Nitrogen and other light elements, up to (iirc) Silicon. It isn't \nmassive enough to go further than that (not enough core pressure).\n\nA very massive star can fuse up to Iron, but at the very moment it does so, \nits \"equilibrium\" is broken, and it collapses and turns into a supernova. \nHeavier elements are created in the blast and ejected into space along with \nthe rest for other bodies to catch or be formed from via gravity. What \nhappens to the star afterwards is again depending on its mass. It can \nbecome a white dwarf, a neutron star or, for the more massive ones, a black \nhole.\n\n(Elements are also created in star flares and in a completely different \nprocess called \"radioactive decay\", but that's another story).\n\nSo now, we know how stars and elements come into existence (and out of it \nvia transformation). Onto the Solar System.\n\nThe Sun was born via accretion, like many other stars, of a thing called an \naccretion disk, which is made of elements bound together by gravity. Once \nit was born, there was still a lot of material left. \n\nAccretion went on, and over time, bodies started to coalesce here and there \nwith the heavier elements staying close to the Sun and creating the \ntelluric (rocky) planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the lighter \ncreating the outer gaseous giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and \nNeptune. Satellites were created the same way, being \"caught\" on the fly by \ntheir mother planet, with the notable exception of the Moon. There also was \nmany more bodies to start with, ranging from asteroids to mars-sized \nplanets but many disappeared through collision and/or absorption.\n\nSo here you are: from a very, very hot and dense universe containing \neverything it's made of, then expansion, you've got elements, then stars, \nthen planets.\n\nIf you've read that far: first congrats for your patience, that was a long \none. Second, what do you think of it now?",

                "text": "It's just ridiculous to me that these nearsighted critics of the Ancient \nWritings view this body of data in a superficial and simplistic manner and \nlaugh at it when in reality it is jam-packed with sophisticated data that \nis to be extrapolated by various forms, i.e. etymology.  Much of the \naccounts from Rabbinic traditions, the Hebrew Pentateuch (containing \nGenesis), Torah, Egyptian Book of the Dead of Hermes Thrice Great, the \nBabylonian En\u00fbma Eli\u0161, and so on, deal with \"personification\" of celestial \nagents.  In fact, the entire worldwide mythocorpus and the pagan pantheons \nof the 'gods' of the great begetter god, mother goddess, child-god, and \nhero is \"personification\" of stellar agents and cosmic events; and their \ngreat exploits are their interaction as in cosmocataclysms.  So it becomes \nclear to those of us with discernment that the 7-day creation week is \nactually the chronological history of our stellar system covering 7 great \nepochs involving stellar metamorphosis of our original paternal star (not \nour Sun), which the data reveals was a B-1 class hydrogen blue giant star \nthat eventually received a cometary impact that caused it to eject 70% of \nits mass, creating 12 new celestial members (earth and the paternal star \nexisted first).  Thus, the account of the \"woman\" (Eve, Isis, Ishtar \n[\"star\"], Esther, Rhea [\"discharge\"], etc.) born from the \"side of the man\" \n(our paternal star, called Osiris, Ra, Ouranos, Apsu, etc.) is actually the \n\"Goddess Star\" discharged in a mass stellar ejection episode that produced \na protracted ejecta-tail (\"rib\") in which 10 new planets and our Sun were \nformed behind the new proto-star projectile-head.  Consequently, our \noriginal 2-member stellar system expanded into a 14-member system having 3 \nstars and 11 planets.  Genesis-1 describes the 3 stars, and the Hebrew \nprophet Jeremiah identified the outer goddess star as \"the Queen of \nHeaven\", being the woman Eve, or Ishtar, born out of the \"Cosmic Egg\", \nbeing our paternal blue giant star.  Hence, the ritual of the \"Easter Egg\". \n And the cometary impact that activated this cosmic change survives as the \n\"mistletoe\" (comet) which according to Norse myth pricked the great god \nBalder (our paternal star) and killed him, and the great lamentation of \nweeping that followed generated the worldwide \"thaw\" (Flood)... meaning \nthis cosmocataclysm triggered the Great Global Deluge (Noachian Flood) when \nejected stellar debris caused by the comet impact into the star's \nphotosphere pulverized earth with mass celestial bombardment.  Thus, the \n\"bow in the cloud\" seen in the canopy of the sky and recorded by Noah at \nthe end of the Flood was the subsequent protracted ejecta-tail (bow) caused \nby the mass stellar ejection episode.  The new proto-star was Sirius-A \n(cloud), and besides Sirius-B was the most important star to the Ancients, \nand called \"The Bow Star\" by the Ancient Babylonians and Ancient Chinese. \n Consequently, the Sirius Binary is the missing half to our solar system \nand Sirius-B (originally a blue giant) is our paternal star, for formerly \nthe Sirius Binary and our current system were conjoined into the \"Osirian \nTrinary Stellar System\" with 14 celestial members, and it was called by the \nHebrews \"The Tree of Forbidden Knowledge\", for the Greeks identified the \nname of the deadly comet as \"Metis\", meaning \"prudence\" or \"knowledge\" that \ncaused the \"man\" (Sirius-B) to fall.           \ufeff",

Buddishm for example does not teach that, at \nleast not all forms of Buddhism.\nNietzsche praised asceticism for similar reasons.\n\nPsychology has shown if you reward people for stuff they like to do anyway, \nthey often start to dislike it.

Could happen, does happen, easily, \nbut there is nothing automatic about such group dynamics. Just because \nsomeone teaches at Oxford, I don't assume he is an arrogant jerk.\n\nChristianities idea of sin, as far as I ever encountered it, devides \nbetween Jesus and sinful people. There are no good people besides him.\nOf course Christianity contains in all its pratices ideas of moral \njudgement. Societies were Christinanity is widespread have often developed \nideas of what good and bad people are influecend by different Christian \nideas/jugements. Bad that seems bound happen somehow regardless if or what \nreligion is present in that society.\nAnd I don't see how this arises by conscious manipulation by someone or in \nrelation to immature people. The ideas are simply present, and thus are \nadopted in this way by some. It's possible but not neccessary that someone \nsearched for them or actively spread them for this purpose.\n\nMorality and values have quite a lot to do with our self-respect and \nrespect for others. You can show that in various experiments very \nconsistently. Morality and values also have a lot to do with opportunism, \ninstinctive selfishness and circumstances. The latter evenmoreso as people \nage. Young children, for example, are less discerning in who deserves help \nthen older children and adults are. If there is a relation to age, I'd say \nit's a negative one at best.\n\nI am not sure if I understand your concept of intrinsic value. To attribute \nintrinsic value to something is a subjective process. A child might value \nclrearing his room because it is rewarded with ice cream. Ice cream has \nintrinsic value to the child because it is tasty. You might say, to an \nadult a tidy room has intrinsic values, but that does not seem right. It \nhas value for working more effective or somehting, which is valuable \nbecause it allows for earning money which allows for more ice cream which \nis still the thing with intrinsic value.\nIt is hard for me to think of an example where this really changes and even \nif we allow for that adults intrinsicly values some things they only valued \nfor reward as children, that does not change the fact that they simply \nvalue some things over others, their priorities just changed as adults.\nThat is often related to adolescence, but in good ways as well as in bad \nways. We don't magically start to want morally good things (we had to be \ntricked into wanting earlier) when we become adults. Just consider the \nidiotic immature things adults do for sex or money.",

However, in closing, I will correct \nyou on one point, and also offer you a couple of tips.\n.\nFirstly, I know science and philosophy very well. I can back up my \nstatements with references you would accept. I didn't do so, since this is \nYouTube, and substantiating each premise, method of reasoning and \nconclusion, is a bit over the top.\n.\nSecondly, best to make one point at a time - that's why I numerised the \npoints made by yourself and others. If you make more than one point, your \nopponent will simply cherry pick the issue he is most confident with.\n.\nThirdly, you have been rather gracious in minimising your use of ad \nhominem. Not gracious enough, tho': God really does drown the world - \nsuggesting that I \"see a professional\" is a poor substitute for reading \nwhat Malthus actually wrote!\n.\n:)",

                    "text": "One last post, and I am done-- only because is apparent to me that you are \nwillfully ignorant and understand nothing about what you're making \nstatements about. You make the claim that the foundation of math and \nscience is axiomatic and have provided one equation-- derived from geometry \nfor which there is nothing axiomatic-- to make your case. \n\nYou claim that you have stated a source for every claim you've made. You \nhaven't provided one-- other than 'all of humanity' or 'science books' or \nsome other nonsense. Which aren't sources but statements. Just because \nmost-- and not all, like you claim, societies have felt the need to invent \na personal god-- doesn't make him real. No more real than Santa, whom many \nmillions of people have invented to their children.\n\nMore importantly-- if popularity is what is important to you-- more people \nthroughout the history of the world have believed or do believe in a god \nthat is nothing like the one you claim. Polytheism was popular for many \nthousands of years before man invented the idea of one god.\n\nIf it is what most people believe that makes it real, then Christianity \nisn't real. Islam isn't real. None of the major world religions today are. \nReligion has evolved right along with society. Ever changing. Which is \nweird, isn't it-- since your concept of an all-powerful god doesn't change.\n\nIf you go by what most people have believed-- you should be worshiping some \nkind of sun-god or fertility goddess. Which are no more or less real than \nthe kind of god you claim exists.\n\nChristianity invented the police force? Weird. I live in the U.S. which has \nalways had separation of church and state-- which is a secular country. I \nwonder how people secured cities prior to Christianity. The Romans must not \nhave had police. I guess Hindus don't have police? Or Buddhists? Or Muslims?\n\nJust another statement you make that is wholly without merit. Which you do, \na lot.\n\nYou claim that rapes don't happen!? Do you even bother to think the things \nbefore you say them? Rapes happen now, just like the did in biblical times. \nOnly, now-- thanks to secular free-thought and actual critical thinking-- \nthe poor girl being raped isn't forced to marry the dude who raped her-- \nwhich is in the bible. Which you haven't bothered to read, apparently. \n\n\"\u201cIf a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies \nwith her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to \nthe father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver...\" Deuteronomy. \n\nI know. That is just old testament stuff. But, this is your all powerful \ngod commanding it. Weird that his ideals of morality have matured as \nsociety has, isn't it? Almost like he's just a reflection the people who \nclaim to believe in him. \n\nYou are right about nothing. Worse, you don't actually cite any evidence \nfor anything you claim. You don't seem to understand math or science-- but \ntalk a lot about them. And now it is quite obvious that you don't \nunderstand religion or the bible or society.\n\nI beg you, please please please keep going onto the web and making \narguments for religion. You make it seem far sillier than it actually is. \n\nAnyway. I hope you'll take some time to actually read the bible since you \nclaim to believe it. \n\n\"The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.\" \nWrong. The earth moves around the sun. Or-- \"He set the earth on its \nfoundations; it can never be moved.\" The earth does move. Around the sun, \nwhich moves around the center of the galaxy.\n\nThough, any part in error is just metaphor, right? People wouldn't have \nbeen able to comprehend the simple truth at the time? I mean God couldn't \njust dictate, \"Verily, I say the earth is one of several planets that move \naround the sun, in a medium sized galaxy of little importance. There are \nmany planets and many galaxies.\" It is almost as if, God didn't know about \nall of this at the time! Or! Like, people just wrote the bible and there \nhas never been a message from God. Interesting. \n\nLeviticus. One of the books of the bible most rife with error and \nscientific inaccuracies;\n\n\"These are the birds you are to regard as unclean and not eat because they \nare unclean: the eagle, the vulture... the bat\"\nSo, this isn't claiming the bat is a bird? It might help you, if you \nactually read your bible. Which, I have-- which is why I don't believe.  \n\nI don't need to go on. I do this more for people who actually care and who \nactually think. \n\nIn summation: Science and religion are not equal. They are not both quests \nfor truth, as you claim. Religion cannot be. It already claims to have all \nthe answers. Worse, holy books are full of immoral and silly things that \ncannot be justified by our now modern, moral standards. \n\n\"God will drown the world again and again until man sees his mistake. That \nis what Malthus meant. It is the nature of bubbles to burst. Don't blame \nGod or religion.\"\n\nIsn't weird that God didn't have the foresight to see that the people he \nchose to create would let him down and piss him off so often? Isn't it a \nshame that he didn't make a more perfect creature in his image? \n\nBesides. You make a lot of claims about God. Does he talk to you \npersonally? He tells you that he is going to drown the world again, \nhimself? If so, you might want to go and see a professional about that. \n\nGood luck to you, Blink. Hopefully you will actually read a few books \ninstead of borrowing your argument from right-wing apologetic websites. The \nbible would be a good place to start. ",

The bible does claim that bats are birds. \nThe bible claims that the earth has corners and that the sun revolves the \nearth. I did not fail to notice that you did not comment on any of the \nother falsehoods I cited in the bible. \n\nAn axiom in mathematics does NOT mean the equation has no solution. It \nmeans that in order to solve the problem you must accept certain \nconditions. A positive integer. Or an absolute value. Or an even number.\n\nYou don't understand math. You sure as hell don't understand science. And, \nI am going to stop wasting my breath.\n\nI will make this really short. Scientific theory is a body of evidence in \nsupport of a claim. Do you have a body of evidence in support of any \nreligious claims? Do you have any proof that this god of yours exists? \nMaybe you could stop ignoring the more important questions I've raised on \nyour ignorant assertions that you somehow understand core principals of \nscience and math.. and answer a few questions.\n\nFor the fifth time.

Who haven't the \nfirst idea of how the science-things actually work? \n\nYou are right about this... science and religion are different. Science \nmakes no claims about being perfect, or about being true. Science is open \nto new concepts and new ideals. Religion never is. Religion, based on holy \nbooks thousands of years old-- which justify slavery, murder, incest and \nrape-- claims to be the truth. If you accept this, then you accept it all. \nRape. Slavery. Genocide.\n\nDo you? You are okay with rape? Okay with slavery? Wiping out whole towns? \nKilling your child if God asked you to?

Mainly bad ones, in fact: here \nare top 9 fallacious arguments in your over-ambitious post.\n\n1. \"What you're really attempting to do, rather poorly, is establish \nscience and religion as equals.\": Read my lips: \"Science and religion are \ndifferent. Neither can contradict or discredit the other?\".\n.\n2. \"When I ask you to provide examples (plural), of how science is \naxiomatic-- you give me one equation.\": Fermat's last theorem does NOT \ncontain axioms - its proof is based SOLELY on axioms. O/wise, NO solution. \nGeddit? Here's another one: E = mc2. E and m are interacting variables - c \nis an axiomatic constant. Geddit?\n.\n3. \"Here is my definition of axiom\": red herring; axiom has only ONE \ndefinition.\n.\n4. \"Here is the second definition of axiom\": ditto. A 3rd definition might \nadd to the amusement, but wouldn't help your case.\n.\n5. \"A scientific theory is a body of evidence supporting a theory\": Read my \nlips: religion doesn't HAVE theories; science DOES (see 1. above).\n.\n6. \"Religion could never hope to discredit science... \": see 1. above.\n.\n7. \"Religion already claims to have the truth...\": No it doesn't. Religion \nis a worldview - science is NOT.\n.\n8. \"Science could and often does discredit the parts of religion that \naren't true \": Science has certainly, in some instances, shown that \nselected sections of religious text are incorrect or incomplete. \nWhoop-de-doo; that is why we HAVE science. However, you then go onto make a \nnumber of claims, which are demonstrably refutable atheist propoganda \nhogwash.\nOne example will serve to definitively refute your position.\n.\n9. \"bats are birds. Not true.\": Well, at least you didn't bring up hares \nchewing cud, same thing. The Bible does NOT SAY that bats are birds - it \nclassifies both as FLYING CREATURES.    In other words, the Bible \nTRANSCENDS the science view, by showing the importance of evolutionary \nconvergence, rather than just a post-Victorian ad hoc morphogenetic \nclassification.\n.\nI therefore repeat my original view that GOD EXISTS, and that atheists and \ncreationists are FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH than the animals we share this \nEarth with, including pigs, dogs, and dung beetles.",

                    "text": "+Bink115z I don't need you to tell me what science is. It is evident to me \nthat you don't have any idea of what what science is.\n\nBesides, we both know that explaining science is not your goal. What you're \nreally attempting to do, rather poorly, is establish science and religion \nas equals.\n\nWhen I ask you to provide examples (plural), of how science is axiomatic-- \nyou give me one equation. One equation, because it contains axioms, doesn't \nillustrate that all of science and math are axiomatic. I will get to your \nexample in just a moment...\n\nHere is my definition of axiom: \"A self-evident or universally recognized \ntruth; a maxim.\" This is my use of the word. The sun will rise tomorrow. I \ncan make this claim without any math or hard evidence-- because it has done \nso for the last several billion years. It is self-evident. It is based on \nhistory and observation. Evidence. That is a scientific (and also \nmathematic) axiom.\n\nHere is the second definition of axiom: \"A self-evident principle or one \nthat is accepted as true without proof as the basis for argument; a \npostulate.\" This is your use of the word. Your use of this definition \napplies to religion and NOT science. You cannot have Christianity without \nChrist. So you accept him, even when there has been no historical evidence \nof his existence beyond the bible-- which is often contradictory. \n\nEven our uses of the word axiom are not up to the same standards. \n\nNow. \"The proof of the solution to Fermat's last theorem...\" Doesn't \nmatter. Fermat's theorem is derived from the pythagorean theorem-- for \nwhich there is nothing axiomatic-- in an attempt to explain things far more \ncomplicated than simple geography. This doesn't draw into question the \nfoundation of science or math at all. Nor M-theory. Why? As we further \nunderstand particle physics-- the theory and the math will be improved. \nLike Newton did with algebra, and like Einstein did with Newtonian physics. \nIt doesn't make it 'wrong.' M-theory and the math used to describe it is \nbeing constantly improved as our technology and observation of subatomic \nparticles imroves. Just because a complex math starts from let n = \n\"whatever\"... doesn't make the math wrong. Many equations dealing with \ncharge and mass begin with this. Why? Because you must begin with a number \nand because the nth term is variable. It says nothing about the validity of \nthe math-- but it does say a lot about your understanding of how math \nworks. \n\nA scientific theory is a body of evidence supporting a theory. It doesn't \nmean it is perfect or without gaps or holes, but is a (best) reflection of \nour knowledge of how something works at the time. Science improves on \ntheory all the time. If evidence comes about that draws into question a \ntheory-- scientists rethink the theory. Does religion do this? Nope. \nScience doesn't claim perfection. Religion does. Religion claims to be the \ntruth regardless of how things really work. \n\nReligion could never hope to discredit science. That is the real truth. \nReligion already claims to have the truth, and nature must conform to it-- \na true axiom (using the definition you like and not the way I like.)\n\nWhile, scientific truth conforms to nature. You claimed in an earlier post \nthat science and religion are both 'quests for truth.' How can religion be \na quest for truth when it already proclaims to have an answer? That is not \na quest but a creed.\n\nScience could and often does discredit the parts of religion that aren't \ntrue or don't reflect the way that nature really works.\n\nThe bible claims that the world has corners. Not true. That a world-wide \nflood happened at one point. Not true- and a claim for which there is no \nactual geologic evidence. That human life began with one woman and one man. \nNot true. That man was created from woman's rib. Unfounded. That bats are \nbirds. Not true. That wearing mixed fabrics is sin. Silly. That women \nshouldn't teach or hold authority over a man-- silly and immoral. That if \nyou hear a voice in your head that claims to be 'God' that commands you to \nkill-- you are to do so without question. Immoral and troubling. That \nsnakes can talk. That God is both unconditional love, but also jealous \nvengeful. How can that be? \n\nA person is completely entitled to reject the bible on any of these logical \nfallacies, immoral principals or based purely upon the fact that there has \nnever been a shred of evidence in support of the supposed 'historical' \naccounts of the bible. Why? Because, the faithful claim that the bible is \nperfect and without error.\n\nNever mind, that if God were all powerful, he could appear at any time and \nreveal himself to each person on earth at the same time. He could quickly \nput all the nonsense to rest any time he wanted to. Which he either doesn't \ncare to do, doesn't actually have the power to do, or doesn't exist. \n\nFinally, back to evidence.

Atomic subparticles come into and go out of \nexistence all the time (out of chance), so thus it must also be possible \nfor a vast expanse of atomic subparticles to simultaneously come into \nexistence.\n\nAccording to the multiverse conjecture, anything that can happen (5th \ndimension) will, so thus such a phenomenon would inevitably occur \nsome(time/where) in said dimension.\n\n\"New\" evidence in the field of quantum mechanics (the field people love to \nhave no faith in, because it diverts sharply from lines of traditional \nthought and \"common sense\"), especially pertaining to quantum entanglement, \nshows that things occur in a superimposed state unless observed (i.e. \nSchroedinger's Cat). Everything assumes the properties of waves until \nobserved and interacted with, which suggests that consciousness is directly \ntied to all things expressing any properties (including existence).\n\nFollowing that logic, the multiverse is essentially one independent \nconsciousness. Everything around you, seen and unseen, is directly \nconnected by quantum entanglement, and is all controlled by this \nconsciousness. Those arguing that this consciousness is a \"god\" of sorts, \nsuperior to everything else, cannot be right if you merit any of the \nscientific research done in this scientific sub-genre (YOU SHOULD).\n\nThus everything is one consciousness, one illusion, and nothing really \nEXISTS. Nothing before the Big Bang exists, and nothing exists now. \nHowever, if quantum entanglement is correct, funny things may happen (that \nwe humans may exploit). If enough of the one great consciousness were to \nbelieve in something like some sort of paradise, ought it then not \"exist\" \nin our glorious non-existence?",

One \nthing you have to remember is that when the Roman empire accepted \nChristianity as their state religion they dressed Jesus up as if he was \ntheir sun God sol invictus (\"Unconquered Sun\"). All the things like \nChristmas, the timing of Easter and even going to church on Sundays are not \nbiblical. In fact, Jesus said remember the sabbath and keep it holy which \nis a Saturday. The problem with many Christians today is that they are so \nembraced in tradition that they don't even realize it.",

I'm not saying that religion is not responsible for \nbad things like wars, since that happens sometimes. It's just for the \nburning of people, the crusades. The bible did state that they were suppose \nto love others like themselves, since it was in latin, and only few people \nknew latin, they were easily manipulated. If it was in the vernacular, they \nwould have been against the church and therefore argue against the crusade. \nI'm not saying shit, it's the turn and it's history. True christians \nwouldn't do that, if you know how one acts. If you read the actual bible, \nyou would have known that the catholic church screwed up about most \neverything that they were suppose to do,and see what I'm saying.. It never \nsaid to kill people, (excluding in certain cases), the crusades was not one \nof them, nor was burning down people because they did not believe in Jesus, \nJesus wanted people to be able to choose if they wanted to follow him or \nnot, not forced to. There's little value in forced belief if you don't \nbelieve it because you believe it fully.They had no right to go into the \nland and kill Jewish people, christians or muslims, or enforce their \nreligion on others which they did not get the true translation since the \nchurch just told the people what they wanted to tell them and what would \nkeep them in power longer back then. When people were able to read the \nbible in their own lanuages they saw the flaws and the mistakes of the \ncatholic Church. Many of the people there weren't even christian, but to \nget money and land. I would not be surprised if some of the powerful people \nactually read the bible, if they did, they changed it. You have to learn \nthe behavior of the people back then, and remember that people will do \nalmost anything for money, back then, the church was one of them. Just \nplease, read your history because I would have thought that you had done so \nalready. I just hope that you will understand some of the things I'm trying \nto clear up about the notion about the Crusades, the burning of people, \nwasn't for religious reason, but for power, and money reasons. It's okay if \nyou don't get it, but at least you got a clearer view to it. You don't have \nto believe what I said, you're entitled to believe what you want to believe \nin. Most christian people are nice people by the way, just go talk to a few \nof them (true christians, not including the ones who were like the early \nCatholic Chruch).  ",

There were morals before Christianity, \nthere will be morals after Christianity and any other religion. Even if \nthere were a God or Gods is almost irrelevant because how we interact in \nthis life, our day to day survival depends on mutual cooperation and as a \nresult we need some level of moral conformity to live amongst one another. \nSee any war since the dawn of time as an example of when our shared morals \nare put aside and the destructive nature that has on both sides and how \ninterestingly enough both sides normally invoke the name of their Gods to \nhelp them defeat their enemies.

                    "text": "Evolution is the most proved theory in science.  We not only know how it \nworks, why it works, where it works, etc. we understand the mechanisms by \nwhich it works. \n\nAllow me to explain this in the simplest terms:\nImagine if a group of birds were washed onto a small island during a storm, \nand there are no similar types of birds on the island.  This group of birds \nis not adapted to living on the island and they have a very difficult time \nfinding food sources; but even with these difficulties, the birds manage to \nsurvive, but they don't thrive.  Over time, there are genetic mutations \nthat occur within the genes of the birds; some of these mutation don't harm \nor help the bird, some of these mutations could be harmful and cause the \nbirds not to survive, but every once in a while a beneficial genetic \nmutation occurs.  In this case, we'll assume that a bird is born with a \ncurved beak instead of the usual straight thin beak, and this allows this \nbird an advantage in getting to pollen in the curved flowers commonly found \non the island.  Because of this, this bird is more successful, better fed, \nand more able to provide resources for it's family and it's reproduction is \nmore successful.  Because THIS CHANGE IS ENCODED INTO THE BIRD'S GENES, it \nis able to pass this beneficial trait onto it's offspring.  Due to the \nexpression of dominant and recessive genes, at least some of the offspring \nof this bird will also receive this beneficial trait that is NOW ENCODED \nINTO IT'S GENES and passed along to the generations that come after.  \nEventually, only the birds with curved beaks will survive since they are so \nmuch more successful.  Accumulate these small changes over thousands or \nmillions of years, while keeping these groups apart from each other \n(environmental separation into various micro-climates, etc.) so they \neventually genetically diverge, and you have evolution.\n\nThis is exactly the case that Darwin discovered on the Galapagos Islands.  \nSamples of what were thought to be a number of different species of birds \nwere brought back from the Galapagos; these birds had many different forms, \ndifferent types of beaks, etc. but it was found that they were really all \ndescendents of a single small group of birds and these birds had split into \nsmall groups that adapted into different ecosystems on the islands.  These \ndifferent groups of birds had evolved to have very different features and \nforms, despite the fact that they were all closely related.  This was \nbefore the science of genetics had been developed and the scientists had \nonly their knowledge of the anatomy of different species with which to \njudge this; but they judged correctly.  Genetics has confirmed the \nspeciation of this single group of birds into an entire suite of different \nforms; and the genes cannot lie.\n\nDo we know every single detail about the evolution of humans, do we have \nexamples of every single transitional form of the various pre-human \nhominids?  No, we do not.  But considering the tendency for natural, \norganic materials to break down and decompose, it's surprising that we have \nANY remains at all.  So it's not at all surprising that we have not yet \nfound the remains of every possible example of pre-human hominid; we're \nlucky to have found ANY.  But what we have discovered fits what we know \nabout the genetics.  It's not a perfect picture, but it is almost all the \nway filled in and the parts we do have, shows quite clearly what's in the \npicture.\n\nOh, and just because the word \"theory\" is used doesn't mean that it's nor \nproved.  In science, a \"theory\" is an overall framework that attempts to \nexplain a phenomenon, not a guess or hypothesis as in popular culture.  \nWhile some theories are initial and more hypothetical, other theories (such \nas evolution) are still considered \"theories\" even when they are proven.  \nSome people think of a \"theory\" as being the opposite of a \"law\"; this is \nnot the case.  A theory has to incorporate known laws in order to be \ncorrect.  An example would be that any theory that attempts to explain how \ngravity works, has to incorporate the known laws of gravity.  The laws of \ngravity tell you nothing about how or why gravity works, just that it \ndoes.  Whereas a theory of gravity has to explain how and why gravity works \nand it has to account for the laws of gravity existing and incorporate \nthem.  Don't be fooled by the, \"it's just a theory\" line; it's bullshit.",

                    "text": "+suckittomcat To reword what I meant is if you choose to defy science as \nbeing true. I would say I exaggerated when I said \"full comprehension\" but \neven just acknowledging the fact science has proven true. If someone tells \nyou something with proven scientific evidence, will you dismiss it due to \nGod or will you listen to reason why that something is true. Example being \nfossils are older then creationist stories. Onto another interesting topic \nthough since we went on the science part, lets look at the religion \naspects. one issue with religion and one that I can't understand is \nstrictly on the word faith. What is \"faith?\" The technical definition is: \n(belief or trust: belief in, devotion to, or trust in somebody or \nsomething, especially without logical proof) If you say faith is something \nelse, then how do you keep it uniform within a religion? The key part to me \nin the definition is, \"especially without logical proof\" I say people have \nto earn my trust, it is not given. I also am a very logical person. I want \nto make sense of things and not just say \"God did this so done\" Even IF I \nsay this was all God's doing. I want to understand every piece of it and \nnot just stop at the God part. I dislike any answer that just stops at the \npoint where God must have done it so stop looking. I think the opposite, \nlets understand why God did everything he did and try to piece together \nevery part of the world. Perhaps god wants us to understand every piece of \nthis miraculous world he built. Now I ask, looking at it through that \nperspective. Why is science so bad? We are trying to make sense of a \nbeautiful world and why shouldn't we? Even if it disproves some of what we \n\"believe\" or have \"faith\" to be true. Wouldn't we rather understand why God \nmade ants,bees,people,dogs,cats, and so on so that we can enjoy everything \nthe world has to offer?\n\nThat was me attempting to make an argument for why people of religion \nshould still want and love science. I obviously don't agree on religion but \nto shut your eyes to parts of the world because of it isn't just a \ndisservice to yourself, I think you are actually degrading everything that \nyou deity built. Faith is a weird concept to me. I can have faith that im \ngoing to win the lottery or something of that nature but if I went around \ntelling everyone I know for sure I am going to win the lottery seems very \nstrange. That is how I feel with creationist stories. If you say you have \nevidence for creationist stories then you do not have \"faith\" because you \nhave logical proof. Hence why I get confused when people say they have \nfaith and evidence for that faith. The faith is no longer faith. ",

                    "text": "+purpledrinnk I can actually answer that most likely for him. He doesn't \nhave full comprehension of the sciences, much like many religious people do \nat first. Having all these things happen is so much more difficult then \njust saying a creator made things happen. Even if you reject the modern \nreligious and the various texts, you could say your a deist like he \nclaimed. Often times a plain \"deist\" realized how bad the religious \narguments can get when choosing a specific religion but doesn't fully \nunderstand how life can evolve the way it did. Education is \"one way\" \npeople begin to break away from religion. That's why the Cosmos got so much \nattention because it begins to break religious boundaries while educating \npeople. The last point in the video is a last ditch effort to cover science \nunder God although we can cover anything under God. \n\nThis is to +Adam W directly. I want you to take some time one day and begin \ndeveloping what you believe your \"God\" is. Why he made things the way it is \nand why he allows the atrocities in the Earth to happen? I also want to see \nhow you view \"before life\" and \"afterlife\" In addition, I want you to \nevaluate your moral's and ethics and how much God actually does have \ninfluence on those values or are they indifferent to a creator. My bad if \nGod isn't the same term just replace it with creator if that matches. If \nyou begin to ask questions, you will begin to understand why I reject \nreligion and a belief in a deity.

                "text": "bueno creo que ya se estaban tardando muchos los evolucionistas para \ncontrarrestar la caida en picada que viene sufriendo la agonizante teoria \nde la evolucion,yo no soy creacionista ni cristiano,pero los creacionistas \nle han dado un golpe muy duro a la evolucion,aunque son incapaces de \ndemostrar a su Dios,en el afan de hacerlo han descubierto las mentiras y \nfalacias de la evolucion,asi como los ateos han demostrado con parcial \nexito las mentiras y falacias de la biblia,bueno en esta batalla entre la \nbiblia y la evolucion yo no me pongo de ninguno de los dos lados ya que \nambos se van a aniquilar mutuamente,no creo en la totalidad de la \nbiblia,simplemente la tomo como una coleccion de libros que pueden arrojar \ndatos interesantes nada mas,para mi no es palabra de Dios,ni nada de \neso,entonces en que quedamos? bueno creo que hay que esperar que se \naniquilen totalmente para recien comenzar a investigar de cero,la ciencia \noficialista y las religiones han enga\u00f1ado a la humanidad,eso es un hecho \nsolo basta hacer una lectura de corrido de la biblia y una investigacion de \nla evolucion entrando en detalle,me inclino mas por una conspiracion \nmilenaria para enga\u00f1ar,someter y esclavizar a la humanidad,porque en un \npunto coinciden la ciencia oficialista y las religiones: ambas son un \nataque a la naturaleza espiritual del ser humano que existe y hay \npruebas,por un lado la ciencia y la filosofia oficial insinuan la \ninexistencia del espiritu,mientras que las religiones grandes,desinforman \nal respecto y han satanizado el conocimiento esoterico y gnostico,ademas de \nperseguir,torturar y matar a los supuestos herejes,yo creo que las \nreligiones y la ciencia oficialista capitalista trabajan al unisono para \nmantener a la humanidad en total oscuridad,la prueba es que la organizacion \nmas criminal y diabolica de la tierra el vaticano ha financiado \ninvestigaciones evolucionistas tienen un observatorio y hasta la teoria \nfraudulenta del big bang fue propuesta por un sacerdote catolico atravez de \nlas herramientas tecnologicas que el mismo vaticano le presto,tambien creo \nque la  mayoria de los \"dioses\" de la antiguedad existieron,la prueba es \nque todos sin exepcion sin importar epoca o lugar aveces diferencias de \nmiles de a\u00f1os y miles de kilometros incluso del otro lado del mar,todos \npedian sacrificios segun las mismas instrucciones,es por eso que quemaron \nla biblioteca de Alejandria,el museo de Iran,los escritos mayas,incas y \naztecas,etc.por la cantidad de similitudes entre el dios de los hebreos y \nlos demas dioses,claro la gente se preguntara \u00bfcomo puede ser si Colon \nllego a America en 1492 que los mayas practicaban los mismos rituales y \nsacrificios que los Israelitas? quiero que algun fanatico ateo me explique \nesto de forma racional y no con el irracionalismo que los caracteriza igual \nque los fanaticos religiosos.Dejense de joder amigos,aqui no estamos en un \ncampeonato ateos vs religiosos para ver quien gana,ni tampoco con la \ninfantil idea de ver quien es mas inteligente,estamos buscando la verdadera \nhistoria y naturaleza humana que tanto ateos como teologos \n,filosofos,ciencia oficialista han fracasado de forma espantosa y \nvergonzosa,es por eso que yo no pertenezco a ninguna denominacion porque en \nla infantil competencia alguno va a perder,y a mi no me gusta perder,en \ncambio investigando por mi propia cuenta sin rotulos no tengo nada que \nperder,es mas siempre voy a ganar porque estoy dispuesto a aceptar \ncualquier cosa mientras sea la verdad porque aumentara mi conocimiento,cosa \nque no pasa con los ateos ni creyentes,porque mas alla de los \ndescubrimientos y razonamientos ambos tienen dogmas que no pueden \nabandonar,sin darse cuenta que esos dogmas cientificos y religiosos no los \ndejan progresar.\ufeff",

But you still seem to lump evolution and the \nbig bang with the same conspiracy, and the only proponent I can identify \nproperly is the catholic church.\n\nYes, evolution and computer science are not the same fields, but they \nutilize the very same scientific method. They require testable falsfiable \nand repeatable hypothesis, and as i said, it's worth noting that they've \nmade workable algorithms based on evolutionary theory.\n\nUmm, what? Dude... We settled this centuries ago with the germ theory of \ndisease. Where does the spiritual, which no-one has ever bothered even \ndefining, factor in anywhere with medicine?\n\nSpirituality isn't accepted anywhere because again, no-one even knows what \nit means, and second, the evidence is very shaky, usually based on \nanecdote, which simply cannot be tested. When they do try to test stuff \nlike out of body experiences, they usually get inconclusive data (ie. The \nsubject is unable to discern an object hidden above where they are, which \nthey would see if they ever left their body)\n\n\"megalithic constructions on the Moon and on Mars\"\n\nOkay, here is where I got really confused, I mean, what? Do you have any \nsource for that claim?\n\nAgain, vague similarities do not mean that these gods actually existed and \nthey were all talking to these people. It at best means that these myths \nmust have been shared at one point and used as a basis for their own myth. \nIt also doesn't explain why these gods clearly aren't active anymore. The \nworld didn't end when there were no longer Mayans to perform massive \nsacrifices, Yahweh isn't throwing floods at people because they're not \nsacrificing goats and the lack of wicker men being burned has not affected \nthe world in any way.\n\nI've already found Evolution Cruncher. Judging from the fact that it quote \nmines Charles Darwin near the beginning, this is already starting to sound \nlike the same old crap. Not only that, but it starts off talking about \ncosmology, which has NOTHING TO DO WITH EVOLUTION. It also flat out lies \nand says that evolution is based on spontaneous generation and larmarkic \ntheory, which is just plain wrong. This is seriously already so bad it's \ncomical. Frankly, I've only just started reading this and I think I've \nheard enough.\n\nI feel like we're starting to go off in many directions at once, and that \nkind of discussion is usually a slog to maintain, so why don't we narrow \nthe topic down a bit?",

Such texts showed a ceremony called 'the \nweighting of the heart' where a soul's heart is checked to see how 'heavy' \nit got while on earth, how 'intoxicated' it became while in the world \n(hence the famous warning 'be IN the world but not OF the world') through \nthe actions and desires of the ego. \n\nI would never teach my kids that there is heaven and hell as a black and \nwhite concept as that's an ASSUMPTION, Hebrews believed what we today \ntranslate as 'hell' as a simple realm where the dead would go, SHEOL was \nthe term and yes, such realm would be divided in two, a prison for the \nwicked souls and a paradise or the correct term 'the bosom of Abraham'. I'd \nwould tell them that every individual is bound to the THOUGHTS and ACTIONS \ngenerated while alive, that we are part of a much bigger reality which some \ncall God.

If you've ever seen Dr Bart Ehrman's \nlecture entitled \"Misquoting Jesus\" (and if you haven't I recommend you \nyoutube it), he essentially explains that, because for 1,500 years the only \nway to make copies of the bible was to do it by hand, mistakes would be \nmade on a fairly large level even if a college educated person today \nattempted to make a copy by hand, let alone the literacy levels in past by \ncomparison.  That being said, and using some pretty basic math, it's all \nbut been proven that almost every word in the modern day bible SHOULD in \nfact have changed at least once, if not more than once, as every new copy \nwould carry over the previous errors, and introduce new ones, when were \nthen carried over as well, with more new ones added, so on and so on until \nsometime in the early 1700's when the first printing press was invented.  \n\nSo, can we really use a source that's essentially known to be completely in \nerror from it's original form as \"proof\" when you find a mistake like a \ncontradiction?  Don't get me wrong, I find the likelihood of one religions \nparticular god, over the thousands of gods that people have believed in \nover 10's of thousands of years actually being correct to be exceedingly \ninfinitesimal, however, for anyone to say \"I know for a fact that there is \nno god(s)\" makes them just as bad as any theist who says \"I know for a fact \nthat there IS a god, my god, the christian god\".  \n\nThat was really my only point, and why I'm a Pragmatic Agnostic Atheist. \n Agnostic being the root word, and thus primary, with Pragmatic and Atheist \nas prefix and suffix accordingly",

Science \nis ill-equipped to answer questions of origins, but that doesn't stop these \npeople from corrupting science as well as philosophy and religion. They \nmake the broadest sweeping claims possible and then use the word \"science\" \nas a stick to beat people with if they resist this all-out assault on \nreason.\n\nThe reason \"it doesn't matter\" is because all theories about everything now \nare evolution. You've got the evolution of the universe, the solar system, \n\"abiogenesis\" (pure junk science), and biological evolution. It's all based \non the same fundamental claim that the universe is self-creating and \nself-sustaining and only natural forces exist. In fact, no \"science\" need \nbe done since the answer is already known. You don't even need a theory of \n\"abiogenesis\" since it isn't possible to have any other theory under this \ncult's control of science. No other is allowed or even possible since \nintelligent agency is denied outright as we are not allowed to think and \nuse our reason to make inferences about how something came to be unless we \nascribe it to mindless forces!\n\nIn the very definition of science now, they exclude intelligent agency - \nwhich is unbelievable hubris and completely at odds with the very notion of \nscience. This is direct evidence of what lies behind this evolution cult. \nIt is a movement to overthrow God and traditional morality and lifestyles \nand values. By claiming to explain the entire universe apart from God, they \nare setting themselves up as a priesthood over all mankind. We are just \nsupposed to bow down and worship them for these absurd claims coming out of \ntheir mouths about what life is and how it began and what it means. And \nthese usurpers want us to believe that life is just chemicals in a \nparticular arrangement dictated by physical forces which began accidentally \nand has no inherent meaning or purpose. Now you're going to tell me that \nthat kind of grandiose claim - which is completely unsubstantiated and \nperpetuated by mere say-so storytelling - is \"science\"? It's an absolute \nperversion of science. You could not pervert it any more. Anyone who buys \nthat for a minute clearly has no power of discernment and is a pawn in the \nhands of such crass manipulative people.",

Theories in science have scopes - they ever \neven attempt to explain things within clear limits, and leave things \noutside those limits for other theories to explain.\n\nThus the question of how life originated from non-life is a question for \nabiogenesis models, and for the theory of evolution, it doesn't MATTER how \nlife got here. From the perspective of the theory of evolution, you could \nbelieve that life was deposited on Earth by the Easter Bunny, and you \nwouldn't be contradicting anything in the theory of evolution, because the \ntheory of evolution is not a theory of everything, it  is a theory that \nexplains how the diversity of life we observe came about from initially \nsimple life.\n\nIf you want to discuss abiogenesis, that is fine, but don't confuse it with \nevolution.\n\nYou quoted me thus:\n\"Evolution does contain random elements, but it's the very non-random \nprocess of natural selection that accounts for the order and complex \nfunctional structure of life.\"\n\nAnd then you replied to this quote by:\n\n\"Mutations are not random? What, do you guys parse \"random\" now into \ncomplete meaninglessness?\"\n\nHow about reading the very bit you quoted again, this time with thought? I \nbegan the sentence with \"evolution does contain random elements\". Mutations \nARE what I'm referring to here. They are one of the random elements.\n\nSo no, I'm not saying that mutations are not random, I am saying that \nNATURAL SELECTION is not random, and it is the natural selection that acts \non mutations, that explain the complexity of life, not the random mutations \nthemselves.\n\nYou really need to educate yourself on the basics of how this works, if you \nthink natural selection is a random process.\n\nI am off to work now, so I'll have to cut it here.

Or do you just make claims \nabout  \"MECHANISMS\" (I love how ALL CAPS YELLING SUBSTITUTES FOR SCIENCE \nAMONG EVOLUTIONISTS!)?\n\nWhat's the MECHANISM that produces life from natural elements? Can you \ndemonstrate this? Or does yelling \"MECHANISM\" suffice?\n\n\"Evolution does contain random elements, but it's the very non-random \nprocess of natural selection that accounts for the order and complex \nfunctional structure of life.\"\n\nMutations are not random? What, do you guys parse \"random\" now into \ncomplete meaninglessness?\n\nHow can natural selection of mutations ever account for the order and \ncomplex functional structure of life? That's absurd. You're making an \noutrageous claim which cannot be tested. Mutations do no such thing when \nobserved! You're living in a fantasy world, and you mock real science with \nthis idiotic religion about origins. If you want to make a religious or \nphilosophical claim about the origin of everything (universe, solar system, \nlife), then make your claim, but don't lie and say that it's science. It is \nnot science. It's a belief system about claimed unobserved non-repeatable \nevents in the distant past. Don't claim that people who don't buy your BS \nare \"ignorant\" or \"backward\" just because you have a cult which is \nstate-funded and an elite who push this nonsense in schools and media \neverywhere.\n\nReal science is not about opinion, but demonstration of how the natural \nworld works. How the hell do you know that anything of what you claim \nactually took place in real history? You can't demonstrate any of that. \nIt's absolutely mind-boggling that you people can act like your Moses \ncoming down from the mountain or something. You're the gurus of the age \nwith all the answers for where everything comes from and how it came to be, \nand why.\n\nHow does natural selection produce genetic code for an organism such that \nit is always adapted to its environment and capable of survival and \nreproduction *before* an additional \"evolution\" takes place? Where the hell \ndo you start from? You can't just say \"natural selection\" like \n\"abracadabra\" and poof - new structures and organs arise. Arise from what? \nFrom a previously existing, adapted organism with a working genetic code? \nAnd no regard to the complexity of *actual* living things. All these \npseudo-arguments are in your head and do not correspond to reality. In real \nlife, mutations are mistakes and almost always harmful or useless. Yet you \nclaim that *mistakes* are the cause of what they are mistakes of! It's just \na series (which no one has ever observed) of useless mistakes which are \nsaid (with no proof) to be \"beneficial\" at every freaking stage, continuing \nin a series (which is always \"beneficial\") of who-knows-how-many that leads \ninexorably to some new, useful, and incredibly complex system. And this \nsomehow manages to supplant the previous system (or arise anew) with no \ndifficulty. Every animal seems complete and well-formed and equipped and \nadapted to do exactly what it need to do to survive at all times. It \nsomehow *knows* what is food and what isn't, and how to raise their young \nand provide for them, etc. And this knowledge is in the code? How did it \nget there? Mutations explain that too, right?\n\nAnd how do you get a *code* from a *selection* of code? Don't you need an \noriginal code? And how can you say a code cane \"arise\" without it having \nbeen programmed? Isn't that what a code is? Isn't it there for a purpose - \nto create such-and-such and not something else?\n\nEyes and wings and brains, and digestive tracts just \"arise\" because of a \nfortunate series of meaningless mistakes? And you buy all this and then \nmock people who don't? You think that intelligence just emerges from \nnon-intelligence because it's some sort of inexorable physical process? Why \nwould anyone believe that who has knowledge of how the world works? Nature \nis dumb. Elements are dumb. Physical forces are dumb. They don't create. \nThey don't make complex structures in a complicated interconnected fashion. \nLife is something completely different from non-life. You cannot ascribe a \npower to something that it doesn't have. You are making very serious \nphilosophical errors in pushing this nonsense. You are essentially telling \npeople that non-rational causes produce reason. This is like pantheism. \nYour \"god\" is in nature and it wants to express itself in life, so it \ngathers up the dumb elements and starts making constructs out of them like \na builder does with a building. You want this power of intelligence and \npurpose to be there, but then you yell and scream when someone says the \nobvious - that life is the product of an intelligent agent!\n\nYou really have no idea what life is. You make it cheap and ridiculous with \nthese cheap and ridiculous claims. At the same time you are building up \nnature into something it's not you degrade life into something its not. You \nsay that we are nothing but the end result of mindless physical forces, and \nthat has all sorts of implications for morality. In fact, you cannot derive \nmorality from physical forces and dumb elements. You know that, right? It's \neven futile to try to derive it from \"evolution,\" since evolution is \nindifferent to morality. Your imagined \"mechanisms\" and \"processes\" only \nact by physical, not moral or spiritual or mindful means. Evolution doesn't \n\"care\" if one talking ape murders (What is \"murder\" anyway? It's just \nnature acting via physical laws.) another talking ape. It only \"cares\" that \napes survive. And, of course, it doesn't actually care if apes survive \nbecause it doesn't care about anything. It's just like billiard balls that \nconvey momentum to other billiard balls which follow the laws of physics. \nIt doesn't care about extinction. If life goes extinct, then it goes \nextinct. Yet you people who push this reductionist and nihilistic view of \nlife will deny that you do so when you are confronted with it.\n\nYou have stripped philosophy and religion and morality of any meaning or \nmerit whatsoever in claiming that thoughts and brains and wills and \nemotions are nothing but chemical reactions following deterministic \nphysical laws, then you try to backtrack by making up some nonsense about \nhow self-awareness and thinking and will are somehow \"free\" due to another \ncomplex interaction which you just make up on the spot to save you from the \nconsequences of teaching this foul doctrine. You apparently want to save \nface. Why? Why not go all the way with what you believe and let the chips \nfall where they may? Why are you guys afraid to let your philosophy fully \nunfold. Is it because you actually know in your hearts how evil it really \nis to reduce life and meaning and purpose and intelligence and creativity \nand love and sacrifice to - what? What's the ultimate reduction? Hydrogen? \nElectrons? Quarks? The \"fabric of space\"? The \"multi-verse\"? How can you \nnot see that this is all just part of one big crackpot religion which \nclaims to know everything about everything yet produces grossly irrational \nand dangerously immoral fruit when applied to real life?",

ERV codes:\nRetroviruses are viruses that insert their DNA into ours, then like regular \nviruses, hijack our cellular machinery to replicate themselves. Often they \nlay dormant for a long time, and often they entirely fail to activate or \nare harmless, and the host cell survives with its new section of inserted \nendogenous DNA. If this happens in a somatic cell, this vanishes within the \ngeneration, but if it happens in a sex cell (sperm, egg, recently \nfertilized egg) it can be passed on to all the cells of the body and down \nthrough the generations as a permanent addition to the genome.\nSome types of endogenous retrovirus codes (ERVs) insert at specific sites \nin the genome, but some are known to insert in a random spot, e.g. after \nany 'gtta', of which there are millions. When one of these randomly placing \nERV codes is in the same location in all the members of two populations, it \namounts to very strong evidence that the ERV infection happened in a common \nancestor to both populations.\nWith millions of potential insertion sites multiplied by millions of \ndifferent retroviruses out there, it is astronomically unlikely for any two \norganisms to share the same randomly placing ERV code in the same spot in \nthe genome, and it not be the result of inheritance- and yet all life \nshares some randomly placing ERV codes, the most ancient ones. Others are \nshared by groups of families of animals, painting the family tree in \nextraordinary detail and matching the family trees mapped by other \nindependent methods of investigation, like comparative anatomy.",

                    "text": "+joe cole\n I have no idea wtf you're talking about. But intelligence is obviously \nmore important than survival of the fittest. The only reason mankind is at \nthe top is because of intelligence.\nHere's a few  facts of the matter, I hope you read and don't make your own \nassumptions without taking in some home truths.\n\n1).\u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d is NOT the guiding principal of individual \nbehaviour. It is the biological mechanism which determines the adaptability \nof a species over time, NOT individuals within their own lifetime. \nEvolution happens gradually over hundreds of millions of years. Random \nmutations in the DNA code do not always produce positive results. Mutations \nare not always beneficial because evolution is unguided; it has no \nforesight. Natural selection builds upon mutations that produce adaptations \nwhich are beneficial in specific areas, just as it cancels out mutations \nthat are detrimental in others. This explains why 99% of all life that has \never lived on Earth is now extinct\n\n2). Evolution does not propose origins of life. Evolution does not seek to \nanswer the question of how the first multicellular organisms appeared. It \ndescribes how they evolved once they formed, not how they formed in the \nfirst place. Abiogenesis is in no way related to Darwinian evolution\n\n3).  The genetic evidence of natural selection is compelling enough proof \nof evolution without any evidence from fossils whatsoever. If Darwin had \nnever lived, we would still have eventually discovered naturally occurring \nselection mechanisms in our DNA. If there were no fossils in the fossil \nrecord, whatsoever, the evidence of evolution in our genes would still be a \nfact. Genetics does not require the evidence from the fossil record in any \nway shape or form. Lateral gene transfer is a major mechanism in \nprokaryotic genome evolution. Gene theory and palaeontology are two \ncompletely separate areas of study that just so happen to support each \nother. Independently acquired, mutually corroborative evidence is the heart \nand soul of the theory of evolution. To disprove one, you must disprove the \nother, yet each set of evidences are intrinsically linked, while being \nindependently ascertained\n\n4). Beyond a shadow of doubt, human DNA and chimpanzee DNA are 98% \nidentical.\n\n5). Not a single living organism that has ever been discovered shows any \nsign, whatsoever, of having evolved by non-Darwinian means. If there were, \nthe scientific method is precisely designed to discover it. There are no \nknown species of any living organism anywhere on Earth that can not be \nfully described by evolution theory.\n\n6). Darwinism when applied to free market economics, is a flawed form of \ncapitalism and gives rise to a supreme irony. Free market theory has been \nshown time and again to favour the rich to the detriment of the poor. Every \nsingle European and American government who has applied Darwinism to their \neconomic policy, has been forced, at some point, to apply regulations to \nthe market, so as to counterbalance this unwanted effect. Despite this, in \nthe American system of governance, free market ultra-capitalism remains to \nbe the fundamental ideological difference between predominantly evangelical \nsmaller state conservatives, who favour it, and predominantly non-religious \nliberal democrats who oppose it. Darwinian economics is synonymous with \nconservatism, not liberalism.\n\n7) . Darwin was wrong about a great many things. As were many of the people \nwho supported his theory when it was first published. There are examples \nthroughout history of scientists making huge mistakes which have led \nscience down blind alleys of investigation, sometimes for hundreds of \nyears. But the beauty of the scientific method, is that these mistakes \nalways come to light. Darwin did not set his theories in stone, rather he \nhoped that future generations of naturalists would DISPROVE his many \nclaims. Since then, this is what biologists, palaeontologists, geneticists, \nchemists, anthropologists and every other discipline in science has sought \nto achieve. We have yet to find any compelling evidence that might falsify \nany aspect of natural selection, despite that the scientific method is \ngeared towards doing exactly that.\n\n8)Here is exactly what Darwin wrote in \u201cDecent of Man\u201d, followed by the \ntext as it appears in the pro-Intelligent Design film, \u201cExpelled\u201d:\n\"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that \nsurvive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on \nthe other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build \nasylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; \nand our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one \nto the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has \npreserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have \nsuccumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies \npropagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic \nanimals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. \nIt is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads \nto the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man \nhimself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to \nbreed\"\n\nAnd now the edited version, popular on pro-creationist websites:\n\n\"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilised \nmen, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. \nWe build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak \nmembers of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has \nattended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be \nhighly injurious to the race of man.

I've never felt controlled by my faith or \nchurch, some priests would like to do so probably but I blame this on \nhumanity rather than religion. \nAnd the world being run by Atheists isn't a bad idea, but then your putting \nreligious people down, and isn't that controlling masses? why not let \neveryone be represented in the politics by Atheists and religious people \nalike?",

The problem with religion is that it's political and \neven business having for instance effect on people equivalent to drugs and, \njust for instance, tends to want to take away civil rights of people, like, \njust for instance, homosexual behavour, or, as stated in the clip, \nproclaiming we descend from monkeylike creatures. Also religion is an enemy \nof science whenever science pressures their worldview and can undermine the \nnational security of a nation (think christian pampered muslims) Also \nreligion can make criminals or pseudo-criminals stinking rich over the \nbacks of weak people a bit similar like drugsdealers can. As a matter of \nfact religion is the only drug i would like to see banned for adults  as \nchemical drugs loose their value once they are allowed, not to mention the \nway more damaging free exposure of children to this dangerous drug, putting \nan entire society in a continued vicious circel of madness with one \ngeneration infecting the next.   You wil often hear people talk about their \nown personal religious experiance (whatever that may be as i doubt many \npeople wil actually have experianced god talking to them, and if they did \nthey would have been subject to some psychological disorder in my opinion). \nReality however is that personal religion almost always is derived from \npolitical religion and vice versa creates political aka organized religion. \nDo you know anybody who, spontaneously, started believing in let's say \"the \nbig juju under the sea\" as Richard Dawkins once put it? Likely not, as \npeople tend to believe what fits their social environment, saying enough \nabout the real nature of religion already. Some people though want to slip \nin the role of prophet, but they typically don't invent a completely new \ngod, that would be pushing it a bit to much, they mostly just claim to \nbetter know what he wants, or how he \"did it\", like for instance the \nmormons, who's idiotic \"knowledge\" is maybe only surpassed by the \nscientologists. Mohammed and jezus were probaly a similar kind of guys, if \nthey existed at all, managing to posthumously affect countless generations. \n  ",

When you ask, \"What created God?\" You're \nignoring the very clear, very specific Christian premise which alleges that \nhe is un-created. It's as silly as a creationist asking, \"If man came from \nmonkeys, why do we still have monkeys?\" despite the fact that evolution \ndoesn't demand the elimination of lesser species.\n\nFurthermore, you're point can be contrasted with the Big Bang. Before that, \nsupposedly, there was no matter at all; nothing in existence. So what \ncaused the Big Bang? Your own logic works against you.",

Based on your profile pic you are some \nform of christian or catholic and guess what, those are not the oldest \nreligions. So before those religions where \"discovered\", for lack of a \nbetter word, no one believed in your god.  It wasn't until the first person \nhad the idea of your god, or at least understood the idea, that your \nreligion was born.  Predating your religion multiple gods where believed \nin.  That is historic fact.  So how is it that looking up and wondering is \nnot what created religion?  All, not just your, religion started because of \nthe thought \"where did we humans come from?\"  Religion in all it's forms is \nwhat we as the human race started with.  When science became a thing we \nstarted to see that most religions where just plain wrong, some like \nChristianity have endured.  The fact that science has not been able to \nprove or disprove these religions is a big reason why they endure. \nThe funny thing is that if your god created science and science proves \nsomething is fact then your god proved it is fact and so to deny that fact \nis to deny your god.  Just because science can prove the big bang happened \ndoes not prove your god was not behind the big bang, just because science \ncan prove evolution is fact does not mean your god was not involved.  The \nonly thing science has proven in relation to your religion is that your \nholy book, which was written by men, MEN, thousands of years ago, might not \nbe totally accurate.\nPeople like you sound just like the scum who persecuted hebrews and \nchristians for believing in what they believed in.",

                    "text": "-> *Ronald Kelly*\n*I am sorry virginia, yep that is probably a broad brush approach, even \nthough I never hear about atheists getting together to to charity work as a \ngroup,*\nAtheists groups always seemed weird to me, since organizing around a \nnon-thing is a bit... out of character, maybe?\n\nAnyway, there are atheists organizations that do charity (e.g. Foundation \nBeyond Belief), and countless secular ones, but my point was that many \natheists are involved in charity as *individuals*, and with both secular \ncharity *and* religious orgs (I've done both. The cause is more important \nthan the label. But I admit I give a bit more scrutiny to the religious \nones to avoid inadvertently giving to cults. Sometimes, it isn't clear).\n\n*plus I was seeking to undo a common notion that atheists say 'christians \nare all about the money' which absolutely false so I was responding to that \nidiotic claim*\n\nSome *are* about the money. Some are in jail for frauds related directly to \ntheir religious activities. Some are full-fledge con men. I'm sorry, but \nchristianity has a very bad rep regarding that. Probably underserved in \nmany cases (I've known monks who obviously don't care about money, most \npriests or ministers I\"ve met didn't either). \n\nI've always wondered how Jesus would have reacted to the circus and money \nmachines some denominations have become, given the way he properly pwned \nthose merchants at the Temple. Now, that's the Jesus I like, btw. The \n\"'don't give me bs\" one.\n\n*By the way why would atheists who believe in evolution even want to help \nthe weak, needy, disabled? If it is a philosophy of survival of the fittest \nwhy would evolutionists have any reason to undo evolution and just let the \nweak die so the strong can carry on*?\n\nThree reasons:\n\nFirst, we're as good (or bad) persons as you can be. The difference is that \nthe ethic comes from ourselves, our family, our experience rather than a \ndogma. You have a very skewed view of \"evolutionists\". We certainly do not \ncondon eugenism. As explained below, evolution isn't about condoning anyway.\n\nSecond, *Evolution is not a philosophy*. It's a scientific theory. \nObserving that change and diversification is partly based on the ability \nfor a species to survive and thrive in a given environment is an \nobservation. Saying it would imply some sort of ethic is like saying \nvirologists want everyone to die from Hepatitis C or the Spanish Flu, or \nvulcanologists want the planet to go boom.\n\nThird, in case you haven't noticed, we work against evolution constantly. \nEverytime someone design a new antibiotic or antiviral, a new genic \ntherapy, they work *against* evolution, using their knowledge of evolution \nas a weapon. Since, of course, to be able to have a modicum of control, we \nneed to know its mechanisms as best as possible.\n\nYou seem to see evolution as a dogma. As though we worshipped mother nature \nand submitted to her will. We don't. We only study it. And we do that \npartly to satisfy our curiosity (i.e. thirst for knowledge), but also to \n*help* people by finding cures and such.\n\n*I remember a movie I was shown in high school about a ship that sank and \nthere were people in a life boat and on floating debree and with limited \nsupplies he had to choose who would have the best chance of survival so he \nstarted getting rid of the old and to young to help etc etc. Why would they \nshow that to kids if not to give the impression that some people are \nexpendable, evolutions trademark*\n\nI don't know where you get the idea that \"evolutionists\" would kill \nexpendable people in the name of the evolution dogma. I'm sorry, but it \nreeks of misinformation and propaganda (not on your part, but with you as \nthe victim).\n\nFinally, the quotes I used on purpose. There are no such things as \n\"evolutionists\", no more than there are \"gravitists\" or \"general \nrelativists\" or \"Thales theoremists\". *There is no ideology in scientific \ntheories* (or math theorems). Only observations, facts, reasoning and \ndeductions.",

Truly, \nHitler's propaganda techniques showed us enough to know better but people \nare not getting it because religious zealots don't want people to 'get it' \nthey want to use it to gain converts- no matter the cost- and just like \nHitler, they are destroying things that should not be destroyed for their \nown agenda. It is not so hard to convince many children to do heinous \nthings and convince them to defend those actions with their very lives. If \nwe do not put a lid on pandora's box our tolerance for its evils will \nsurely destroy us. Rationality is a luxury of circumstance for we are \nanimals and religion the enemy of rationality. If we do not contain the \nmadness we may lose heightened intelligence by the way of natural selection \naltogether. We are pushed out more and more by draconian slave drivers. \nWhat use is a slave who thinks he is equal and is willing to fight for it? \nAn emergency such as human intelligence is only as permanent as its place \nin nature.",

And the disbeliever is ever a helper of the shaitan, it \ndoesn't matter where he comes from, know that the kaafir, is ever a helper \nof the shaitan.\n\nAnd I say what I see is happening, because the effect that their filth has \nhad on the world are effecting Muslim youth today.\n\nThey have step by step made things more corrupt and that is because they \nwere allowed to do it the first time and it is just that their fitnah \n(trials) have reached such severe levels today, that it is hard and not \neasy to reverse it.\n\nSo if you were to cut off the head of the snake from the beginning, then \nthis would not have happened, and thus they have a base now, wherein they \noperate amongst these crossworshippers, who allowed their mischief to \nflourish like this because of the shortcomings and weakness of their \nreligion, that we have to say something to you people and have you should \nhandle such problems.\n\nAnd as for you. by Allah, if you die with this, then most certianly you \nwill abide in the Fire, so I hope Allah guides you before death comes upon \nyou. Because if you die upon this state of yours, then you will not be able \nto bear the punishments, and death will come to you from all sides, yet you \nwill not die. You will neither be of the living nor of the dead.\n\nSo do not let your desires and your wretchedness overcome you. Think about \nwhat it is I'm trying to say to you.\n\nTo not side with the forces of the shaitan, to not let your desires cloud \nyour judgement and to be with the righteous God-Fearing people, to worship \nyour Creator and to do good deeds and to beware of the misguidance out \nthere. If Muslims were spreading that which you see the jews spreading \ntoday, by Allah I would have condemned them. But most of the misguidance \nand filth that is corrupting the people today comes from their (i.e. the \njews) hollywood and media. So even if you happen to be one of them, then do \nnot be on their side, but be on the side of the righteous people, those who \ncall the people to Worship their Creator Alone without partners and to do \ngood deeds. So be not a helper of the shaitan by misleading the people \nbecause of your  whims and desires.\n\nMay Allah guide you.",

You obviously \nare challenged with understanding the dynamics of having 60,000 unique \ngenes to choose from between Adam and Eve and the dimished bottleneck \nnumber of unique genes you will see with two people of the same race.   It \njs easy to understand so stop being a knucklehead.\n\n\"Plus all of our mitochondrial DNA is not the same. And we did not come \nfrom one original father, please show the science behind that conclusion.\"\nMainstream science backs this up.  We do share the same \noriginating mitochondrial DNA.  Yes since Eve there has been mutations to \nthat DNA code that do give us some variances between all of us.  But the \nscience proves out that all the differences are from accumulated mutations \nover time and when you back them out we all can point the DNA back to one \nfemale.   Go ahead and google the mainstream research behind this \nyourself.  This is accepted fact and you can find it this fact discussed \nall over the place.  And when you are researching that do the same for the \noriginal father and you find that gets determined through the Y \nchromosome.  The mainstream science will say that the original father is \nnot at the same time and actually some more recent reseach has them closer \nto being from the same time but they keep changing their minds around the \ndates on a almost daily basis it seems.  But the difference in dates \nbetween the first female and first male can be explained away by Noah's \nflood and Noah being the father of the three other males on the boat point \nall the y chromosome back to Noah and makes it harder to get back to Adam \nwith that DNA bottleneck in history.\n\n\nIf you are too lazy to google then try these links....\n\n\nHere is a quote from a biased evolutionist website and shown in the firs \nlink below...\n\"Mitochondrial DNA points to the genes in that organelle tracing back to a \nsingle female ancestor who lived about 140,000 years ago, but that genes on \nthe Y chromosome trace back to one male who lived about 60,000-90,000 years \nago.\" Translation that is Eve and Noah.

Science does not rule out any \ndivinity nor does it validate its existance - however, I personally don't \nthink anything divine exists.\n\n*\"Religion is responsible for more wholesale murder than any serial killer \never was. \"*\nThat is such a cop out answer. A religion doesn't kill, it's crazy people. \nYes, people might be motivated by psycho religions, but for every religious \nmurderer there are hundreds or thousands of the same religious people that \ndon't do such things. It could just be that organized religions are often \nruled by actual psychopaths that have no problems with killing, and \npsychopaths constitute around 1 - 2% of the population, so there is no \nshortage of them around.\n\n*\"Same for rape and stealing, which is ADVOCATED in holy books for the holy \nconquerors vs the soulless heathens.\"*\nWhich is exactly why I said \"orginized religion is maladaptive\".

So you are utterly wrong, \nthere.\"*\nYou misunderstood me (again). I do think that the scientific model is the \nmost powerful tool of discovery we currently have. What I meant was that \nthere are many things we think are completely true and logical, which will \nturn out to be wrong. People assume a lot of things, and not just religious \nthings. Even smart people that are more skeptical than average will believe \nin stupid shit.\n\n*\"Medical Science does not equal medical pseudo-Science; use an \"energy \ncrystal\" to heal your cancer.

It is, however, one of the branches \nof science that we are all exposed to that contains rapidly changing \nelements, because we find out that large parts of it are simply false, even \nthough loads of people believed it to be true. That is why I brought it up.\nSome examples are: type 1 diabetics for decades after the discovery of \ninsulin were told to move as little as possible because it would cause them \nharm. This is not true.\nDoctors pathologized all sorts of \"deviant behaviours\" and called the \npeople mentally ill and ruined their lives through force. This wasn't even \nthat long ago.\nOne modern example that keeps going on, even with evidence showing it's \nharmfulness on healthy people, is that doctors will do c-sections more \noften than let women give birth naturally, even when there is no need to.\n\n*\"I don't respect people who cannot use the Internet to learn if they are \ninterested.

Nothing in Evolution contradicts the 2nd \nLaw of Thermodynamics. The 2nd Law says that heat will not spontaneously \nflow from a colder body to a warmer one or, equivalently, that total \nentropy in a closed system will not decrease. This does not prevent \nincreasing order because: \n\ni. the earth is not a closed system; sunlight (with low entropy) shines on \nit and heat (with higher entropy) radiates off. This flow of energy, and \nthe change in entropy that accompanies it, can and will power local \ndecreases in entropy on earth.\n\nii. entropy is not the same as disorder. Sometimes the two correspond, but \nsometimes order increases as entropy increases. (Aranda-Espinoza et al. \n1999; Kestenbaum 1998) Entropy can even be used to produce order, such as \nin the sorting of molecules by size (Han and Craighead 2000).\n\niii. even in a closed system, pockets of lower entropy can form if they are \noffset by increased entropy elsewhere in the system.\nIn short, order from disorder happens on earth all the time. \n\n3. Cosmic Inflation is an easy fix to the Horizon problem. This was \nrecently confirmed during a project known as BICEP2 last week. (Keep an eye \nout on the Nobel Prize scene).\n\n4. What the fuck do you think Evolution is? How on earth could The Theory \nof Evolution, which details the fact that genetic mutations of species are \npassed on birth, explain the origin of stars?\n\nIf you have anything else to say, make sure it's backed up with \npeer-reviewed evidence.

People love to attribute mystical \ncharacteristics to God which contradict the \"laws of nature and the \nuniverse\". I personally believe that God works within the framework of the \nnatural order of things. Similar to how talking over radio waves would have \nbeen seen as witchcraft in ancient history, i believe that our \nunderstanding of science and religion are still very much in their infant \nstages, and that as we continue to learn more about both, they will \neventually come together into the single entity we call by one name: truth.\n\nNow if that \"truth\" ends up being that God is a cyborg robot from planet X, \nor that there is no God at all, or that God is closer to the traditional \nChristian view, then so be it. As for myself, so far everything we have \nlearned scientifically fits perfectly with my interpretation of scripture. \n(note the \"my interpretation\". People believe all sorts of crazy things \nbased on the same sources)",

                    "text": "+anon\nI'll address your points in order:\n\nTheory and hypothesis: Yes, I realize hypothesises are derived from \nrationalism, and if evidence in favor of the hypothesis is observed \nnumerous time it becomes a scientific theory. All that is clear to me, and \ncertainly I would not be interchanging words if this was a scientific panel \ndebate. But this is YouTube. So let's not let semantics get in the way of \nthe crux of the issue here, which is that even if a hypothesis is proven \nagain and again, new evidence can still come along down the line which \nchanges the whole theory or disregards it alltogether. Lots of creationists \nwould consider science an \"unstable\" source of knowledge because it seems \nto be in constant change. Now, moving on, I looked up your reference \n\"Evolution is a Winner - for Breakthroughs and Prizes\", and I found the \nncse.com webpage, where the author clearly states that \"by his criteria\", \nan \"understanding of evolution is neccessary in 47 of 50 cases\". Which is \nfar from as matter-of-fact as you present it in your argument. Either I \nhave looked up the wrong site for your source (let me know if I have), or \nyou are intentionally being dishonest to prove your point.\n\nMoving on: Are all theories bad because some theories are flawed? No, \ncertainly not, and certainly nobody claimed anything like that. However, a \nfew \"bad apples\" in a group, can easily appear to undermine the whole \ngroup, from the standpoint of an outside observer who may not realize the \ndepth and diversity within the group itself. Collectivism maybe, but that \nis the reality one must accept. In my opinion it's absurd to expect people \nto debate a spesific piece of scientific research, without being able to \ntouch on science itself from a broader point of view. It cannot be done, \nthis is why, for instance the 'politization' of the global warming issue is \nsomething that has inevitably led to politization of science itself, \nindeed, with the IPCC scandals etc.\n\nNow, unfortunately, it's not just global warming science that people find \nproblematic. Corporate science at a whole is something one should be very \nwary off, because there is a clear monetary incentive that often undermines \nscientific truth. The majority of scientists work in private institutions, \nso I would consider this a pretty big problem. I'm not just talking about \n\"scientifically proven\" ways to lose fat and gain muscle, but things like \n\"GMO's are automatically safe, even without long-term testing, because we \nsay they are\". And pharmaceutical research. For instance, what do you feel \nabout the lipid hypothesis still not being proven, but being used as the \nde-facto way to treat peple with high cholesterol? What do you fell about \nso called Monsanto-science, where dishonest 'scientists' utilize the weight \nof 'science' in order to push their own agenda upon people or increase \ntheir own bottom line? They are able to do this, precisely because science \nis something that is given too much weight these days, and when you're in a \ndebate and someone slams some scientific research on the table, everyone is \nimmediately expected to shut up, or be labeled ignorant of science. I think \nthis is a very dangerous way of thinking because it amounts to blindly \ntrusting what any authority tells you, and in the long-term the outcomes \ncannot possibly be good. Indeed it can also lead to scientists themselves \nbeing shot down. There's plenty of examples where scientists have been \nbullied out of the field because their findings were so \"absurd\" and didn't \nfit with the current status quo, but have years later been proven to be \ncorrect.\n\nBut it's not just the \"do not question me\"-attitude of scientists that is a \nproblem. In fact, I think science itself is the height of ivory tower \nthinking. Because it's based on the belief that somehow our rational \nprocess has the power to dominate utterly the biological imperative of the \ncognitive constructs that give you \"what is real\". It is absurd that our \ngeneration somehow believes that our perception of reality is somehow \nderived exclusively from strict scientific observation and rational \ndicipline - and not obtained by ourself, the same way that every generation \nbefore us has done since the beginning of times. Indeed, our paradigm of \nscience do face vast limitations. Wittgenstein pointed to a way out of this \nactually, but it was rejected by western academica as too radical and \ndamaging to the current paradigm of analysis. Look it up.\n\nAnyways, this is getting too long. I will quickly address your remaining \npoints:\n*if species A was the ancient ancestor of both B and C, will you find \neither fossilized B or C in the same period as A?* Let me turn the question \naround. If you find fossilized species A in one period and fossilized \nspecies B and C in another period, does that imply common descent? Isn't \ncommon descent implied from DNA-data, then confirmed by time period \nseparation?\n\n*Test of abiogenesis* Yes, I know about the Miller-Urey experiment. It did \nnot form all amino acids. 9 out of 20 amino acids were absent, and it \nformed a massive amount of hydrocarbons. Now, find me some evidence that \nfree amino acids can rearrange themselves into self-replicating molecules \nin an atmosphere full of hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide and \nhydrocarbons (all very toxic to most living organisms today) and we might \nhave some very weak evidence, but evidence nontheless.\n\n*Test of macroevolution* I'm well aware of specitation, however I wouldn't \nconsider specitation which occurs under controlled laboratory conditions to \nbe particularily strong evidence. However I know it has been observed in \nnature and will accept that fact. However macroevolution in a broader scale \nof the type \"dinosaurs to birds\" as you say, is something I would really \nlike to see. As for fossils, I've already been through that previously. If \nit was such a surefire piece of evidence, why isn't every geological \nformation and every stratum full of intermediate links? Answer me that and \nmaybe I'll buy into it.\n\n*Scientific theories are not dogma.* Here you present numerous interesting \npoints. Coming from economics myself, I can definitely tell you that any \n\"community\" will not work quite as you say here. For instance, are you \nsaying there can never be collusive efforts amongst scientific \ncommunitites? Can there never be group-mentality, cognitive biases etc. \ninherent in research? Will competetive forces neccessarily wipe out the \n\"bad\" science? How long does this take? I think the IPCC and climate gate \nis a perfect example of the inherent 'irrationality' that can sometimes \npresent itself accross the entire field. I think also that most scientists \nhave very narrow fields of interest, and in each field there are a few \ndominate scientists who can and probably will affect the entire field, even \nif they sometimes are wrong. I'm guessing that scientific communities, like \nmost, suffer from hierarchial structures. In addition, scientists who \nspecialize would then know very little about the science *outside* their \nown field. For instance, you say 88% of scientists agree on global warming? \nWhat type of scientists are included in that figure? What relevancy would \nit have that for instance a cardiologist believes in global warming? How \nmuch does he know about the processes behind it? How much would an \nastrophysicist know? I'm sure you get the point.",

Have you \nphysically inspected the exact condition of my rear end before extruding \nsuch a precise prediction? A scientist would have checked first!\n\nWhy the personal attacks? Have I used ad hominem, even once, or are you \naccustomed to indiscriminate name calling? It'd be ironic if you were \nChristian: \"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but \ndo not notice the log that is in your own eye?\" I don't see a need to \nassume that anyone who likes science is out to get you, just as I should \nnot have to assume that anyone who is religious has an agenda to attack me \n(well, maybe depends on the religion).\n\nI will try to respond to each point in detail:\n\nTheory and hypothesis: using these words interchangeably in casual \nconversation is perfectly normal, but doing so in a discussion of science \nwill likely confuse the audience -- in science, hypothesis is an idea, \nwhereas a theory is an idea which has already survived tests of the \nscientific method, meaning that it has already been accepted and is \ntherefore no longer hypothetical. To paraphrase Ken Miller, an evolutionary \nbiologist who happens to be Christian, \"in science, theory is an even \nhigher form of understanding than facts\", because a theory is able to tie \nfacts together in an elegant way. In other words, the theory of evolution \nis not useful because it is \"just\" a theory -- it is useful because it *is* \na scientific theory, as in the theory of gravity. If it was not a theory \nwith powerful implications, why would, for instance, an estimated 47 of the \nlast 50 Nobel Prizes in medicine have \"crucially\" depended on evolutionary \ntheory in order to produce vaccines, anti-cancer treatment, etc? \n(reference: \"Evolution is a Winner - for Breakthroughs and Prizes\") Let's \nuse a gut check: would the most-respected, brilliant medical researchers in \nthe world rely on an unproven fantasy when billions of lives depend on the \noutcome, or would they use a well-supported theory?\n\nAre all scientific theories of equal reliability? Are all theories bad \nbecause some theories are flawed? I do not think they are. Are theories on \nclimate change are as rigorous as, say, the theory of evolution? What \npercentage of climate researchers consider humans to be the cause of global \nwarming? Between 82-98% (ref: \"Climate science opinion2.png\") When the \nDiscovery Institute tried to find scientists who disagreed with the theory \nof evolution, how many scientists in the world did they find, and how many \nof those are biologists? Less than 800, and about 1/4. (ref: \"Few \nBiologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition\") What \npercentage of all scientists support the theory of evolution? 99.9%+ (ref: \n\"level of support for evolution\") If academics are essentially unanimous on \nevolution, they are even more unanimous on thermodynamics: \"If someone \npoints out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement \nwith Maxwell's equations \u2014 then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations. \nIf it is found to be contradicted by observation \u2014 well, these \nexperimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to \nbe against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there \nis nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.\" (Arthur Stanley \nEddington)\n\nTest of common descent: if species A was the ancient ancestor of both B and \nC, will you find either fossilized B or C in the same period as A? Not one \nfossil of any mammal has ever been found in the precambrian period. In \ngenetics: if modern Europeans, Middle Easterners and East Asians all \ndescended from Africans, would their DNA be closer to that of modern \nAfricans or that of ancient hominids of their respective regions, such as \nlocal Homo erectus? (See \"Recent African origin of modern humans\") Is there \nevidence for a universal common ancestor, as Darwin proposed, or are \nmultiple separate ancestors more likely? Recent quantitative analysis on \namino acid sequences across all major divisions of life have revealed that \na single common ancestor fits much better with data (ref: \"The Proof Is in \nthe Proteins: Test Supports Universal Common Ancestor for All Life\") What \nobjective evidence exists for uncommon descent?\n\nTest of abiogenesis: have you checked out the famous Miller-Urey experiment \nconducted in 1953? It used water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen to \nsimulate the early earth environment, with sparks from electrodes used to \nsimulate lightning. If abiogenesis is impossible, why would the experiment \nproduce many amino acids, the organic building blocks of life?\n\nTest of macroevolution: macroevolution refers to evolution of entire groups \nof species at the level of the tree of life, such as how all the beetles \nevolved, tests of which require genetics, a technical topic. Speciation is \nthe rise of new species. Are you looking for evidence on speciation? Did \nyou take a look at \"Observed Instances of Speciation\"? What do you think \nabout de Vries' finding in 1905 that some of his evening primrose had \nmutated and doubled in the number of chromosomes? These new plants could no \nlonger reproduce with the original plants, becoming a new species with its \nown name, Oenothera gigas. Another example is the fruit fly Drosophila \nmelanogaster: by using a maze to separate flies into different habitats, \nbiologists bred the flies that prefered dry sections with flies that also \nprefered the dry section, and so on for flies that prefered the wet \nsection. After 35 generations, the two groups of offspring became so \ndifferent that they no longer reproduced with each other, even when that \nwas their only chance of reproducing. This is speciation on a scale of a \ncouple species. If you're looking for evidence of evolution with large \nphysical differences, you can look at fossil records that span millions of \nyears, showing various transitional forms (see \"List of transitional \nfossils\"). If you insist on producing \"dinosaurs to birds\" in a lab, I do \nnot know how one can show that because that is not a scale of change \nresearchers work with, but who knows, maybe someone will be able to speed \nup the process and show us in the future? For evidence of human \ntransitional fossils, look at \"List of human evolution fossils\". Some \nspecies have had many fossil sites, including Homo erectus, Homo ergaster, \nHomo habilis, Homo heidelbergensis, and neanderthals. If you look at Homo \nhabilis which died out over a million years ago, their brain capacity is \nhalf of human's, consistent with the idea that brain capacity in hominids \nis increasing. In 2013, scientists sequenced the entire DNA of a \nneanderthal from Siberia, exracted from its toe bone. We are at least 94% \nthe same as chimpanzees and more than 99% the same as neanderthals; these \nare experimental results, not hypotheses.\n\nTest of global warming: we could get every country to produce tons of \ngreenhouse gases. If we do that and the average global temperature keeps \ndropping or doesn't rise, then the idea would be obviously wrong. But time \nis irreversible. If the temperature did keep rising, could it cause some \nissues down the road? You may disagree with them, but you can probably \nunderstand why some would not want to risk waiting until it's too late. We \nare entitled to our opinions. Mine is that there are more interesting \nscientific theories to talk about than climate change models, though I see \nno reason why governments should not err on the side of caution when it \ncomes to protecting the environment of which I am a part.\n\nScientific theories are not dogma. If there is public knowledge that a \ntheory has been violated, but a scientist refuses to absorb new evidence \nand produce new theory, then they are not really protecting their own \nlegacy, because a community of countless independent members have no \nincentive to lag behind for the sake of one individual. If someone presents \nconvincing evidence that Dawkins is wrong, what chance would he have of \nsuppressing that information? Could he prevent the publication of the \ninformation in all journals? Even if established scientists try to advocate \nan inferior theory, why would rising scientists base their future career on \nit, when they can produce better predictions with another theory? Of course \nanyone can become disappointed when their theory becames outdated, but that \nis a personal matter, and science is not about any one person or central \nauthority.\n\nSkepticism: if a person is naturally skeptical in general, wouldn't he or \nshe also remain skeptical of supernatural concepts such as God? Is evidence \nof the supernatural or spiritual world necessarily more convincing than \nevidence of the material world? If you consider one of them far fetched on \nthe basis of skepticism, would it also be reasonable to consider the other \none equally far fetched, if not more so? Thomas Jefferson for instance \nwrote his own version of the Bible which excluded miracles and supernatural \nevents, yet focused on the moral message of Jesus. Jefferson eventually \ncalled himself a \"materialist\". Which is more beneficial for society, \ntalking about the nature of demons and angels, or talking about the nature \nof morality?",

Exactly how this differs from Schizophrenia, Psychosis and Manic \nDepression is beyond me.

When we look at \nincidents of rape, torture, murder, and theft for example, we understand it \nto be wrong and/or evil always anywhere on planet earth and this is true \nbecause there is a transcendent law giver and judge the Trinitarian God. \nBut in a universe that is only molecules in motion there is no obligatory \nauthority, things just happen predictably, right, wrong, good, and evil \nhave no meaning. Morality is meaningless in a solely material universe.\n\nOn the topic of freedom, you\u2019re so blinded by faith in evolution, that you \ncan\u2019t see that your faith logically would deny you any identity. You\u2019re \nlike someone trying to convince me air doesn\u2019t exist all the while \nbreathing. Atoms subject to natural laws can choose how to react to each \nother, that is what you\u2019re trying to convince me of right? So that I can \nconduct a laboratory experiment and the chemicals in my experiment can \n\u201cchoose\u201d not to do what they are supposed to do? No they can\u2019t, factor in a \nbillion different variables and in the end matter will do what matter does \nfactoring in all the billions of variables, it will not choose to do it, it \njust does it. We would have to logically conclude that everything we see \nbefore us is one big whole accident.\n\nWhy would I need to explain \u201cwhy\u201d God is omnipresent and eternal? It would \nmake more sense if you asked me \u201chow\u201d God is omnipresent and eternal, to \nwhich I would reply he just is. Because you see I\u2019m finite in knowledge, my \nknowledge is only as good as my experience in every form that takes, so \nthat unless God were to reveal it to me, I wouldn\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t \nrevealed it to man so we don\u2019t know, maybe someday he will explain it \ntailored to our limited capacity. But somehow by your view of the universe, \nmolecules in motion view, you are finite but yet are able to make absolute \nclaims to the universe as if you were the God you deny. You would need to \nknow everything exhaustively or for someone who knows everything \nexhaustively to communicate it to you. Or else logically you could at best \nonly speak in probability (I\u2019m granting you so much more than what your \nmolecules in motion view can provide). Making claims such as existence \nrequires the time dimension, something cannot exist for 0 seconds is \nsomething your view of the universe cannot logically allow. Time only has \nmeaning if something has a beginning. God alone doesn\u2019t have a beginning \nand furthermore no end. Creation has a beginning therefore it starts off \nsaying \u201cIn the beginning\u2026\u201d because that is when time was given birth.\n\nDeny it all you want, but you\u2019re arguments are not logical. My arguments \nare logical, you may disagree with my primary claim, but all my statements \nare logical. The claim is that atheist evolution cannot account for \neverything we experience in the world.  I\u2019m demonstrated this by arguing \nthat if you begin with only molecules in motion, it can only give you a \nuniverse where things happen according to natural law and so logically it \nfollows that \u201cmorality\u201d is just what happens according to molecules subject \nto natural law, \u201clogic\u201d \u201cdebate\u201d \u201cdiscourse\u201d is just what happens according \nto molecules subject to natural law. No choice or freedom. In order for my \nargument to be no effect in our debate with you, you would have to begin by \nstating that there are other things that existence in the universe besides \nmatter and energy that are not subject to natural law. You could also claim \nthat our universe is just what I\u2019ve been describing so that it doesn\u2019t \nmatter what I write or what you write because in the end what\u2019s happening \nis just want is supposed to happen.",

I do not control who *I* are (is), But *I* choose (chooses). \nThis idea can be difficult to grasp, but it solves the whole determinism vs \nfree will debate.\nYes, I am comfortable with the notion that given an infinite amount of time \nthere is nothing too complex to be formed simply by chance. This very \ncomment could be reproduced by a machine that types random keys given \nenough time. But I do question the existence of infinite time in our \nuniverse.\nIn a universe without a god, the absence of a god is an absolute truth, \nthus a universe without a god is not a place where absolute truth does not \nexist.\nFinally, stating that God is eternal and omnipresent is not the same as \nargumenting why God is omnipresent and eternal.\nMy argument is that God could not have existed before time because the very \ndefinition of existence requires the time dimension. Something cannot exist \nfor 0 seconds.\nSo far your only response to that is to simply state that God is eternal \nand omnipresent. Please provide a valid argument to support your position.",

I don\u2019t think your worldview allows for \nanything you wrote. And no, time itself is not ultimate. I would\u2019ve thought \nthat stating that God being eternal and is omnipresent would\u2019ve implied \nthat he is beyond the \u201crestraints\u201d of time. Before there was anything, \nthere was God, when he created, that\u2019s when time was given meaning, because \nfrom that point things created have a beginning.\n\nYou basically said the laws of nature are just what happens and I agree \nwith you, how matter alone translates to human intelligence as we \nexperience it (for example) is mind boggling. Do atoms obey natural laws? \nDo they? If they do, then no matter how complex the chemical compounds are, \nthey still must obey natural laws and if that is the case, how then in this \ndebate, were you able to choose the side you\u2019re on. According to your \nclaimed view of the universe, atoms obeying natural laws, you couldn\u2019t \nhave, no matter how deep the variables or complex the chemical reactions, \nyou did what you did and I\u2019m doing what I'm doing, obeying natural law. If \nyou\u2019ve loved anything, what was that? Indigestion? And matter obeying \nnatural laws created all the technology existing in the world, plots in \nmovies and books, and imagination? Really? Inevitably? And you're \ncomfortable with all this?\n\nNow granting you human intelligence (which is impossible seeing as how the \nproper use or improper use of logic, inference, deduction are just what \nhappens, the sum parts of any person obeying natural laws.), Morality is \npurely subjective. Whether you do for selfish reasons or not, neither is \nright or wrong, good or evil. Logically in your universe, every behavior is \namoral; the torture of children is neither wrong or right, good or evil. If \nrape is the socially accept behavior than rape you shall have and it\u2019s \nneither right or wrong, good or evil. There\u2019s no obligatory authority, \nmight makes right. You\u2019re spouting psychology, I\u2019m asking if morality can \nexist, it can\u2019t. Socially agreed upon behavior is not morality. In your \nview of the universe at any given point in time or history, what\u2019s evil \ntoday can be good tomorrow and vice versa.\n\nAnd since everything as you say is interaction of particles, there\u2019s no \nfreedom, no discourse, no debate. You\u2019ve won this argument and I\u2019ve won \nthis argument, logic is just what happens. This is the logical conclusion \nof the evolutionary model of the universe. Meaninglessness.",

And yes, everything can come \nfrom nothing simply by saying that all matter is energy and all energy is \ntime.\nTime by it's very definition is also omnipresent, eternal and unbound by \ntime. For you to understand this: If time ceased to exist, \u00bfFor how long \nwould this be? For exactly 0 seconds, thus we can ignore the non-existance \nof time. Time is a necessary property in everything that exists, even God \nif he exists.\nThe laws of nature are not written, they are the only way things can work. \n1+1=2 is not a law but a fact. With these facts and given enough time (not \nGod), intelligence is inevitable. For you to understand, intelligence is \nlike a humongous puzzle, fitting it together only takes time, not an \nintelligent being.\nYou have a fundamental ignorance of how probability works. If you play the \nlottery for an infinite amount of time, the probability of you winning is \n1, that means you will win. God is an unnecessary explanation.\nMorality is the result of our selfish desire to end the pain we feel by \nempathy and our collective desire to make society more predictable (like \nsaying we should respect our elders to give us a \"respect pension\" of \nsorts). I'm sorry to tell you this, but altruism does not exist because \nnobody has ever done anything for someone else without benefiting \nthemselves in some way from it. Even Jesus who allegedly died on the cross \ngot the benefit of the adoration of millions.\nEverything we do we ultimately do for ourselves, even love. Love is not \nsome special emotion, deep down it's just unconditional trust, the same a \nbaby has for his or her mother. Because we are social animals, we need one \nanother to survive. Even the most seasoned survivalist learnt what he knows \nthanks to other humans. This is why we want people to believe that we can \nbe altruistic, it's just an attempt to make humans as a whole more \ntrustworthy.\nYour feeling of love ultimately is just an interaction of particles. \u00bfWhy \ndoes this make you uneasy? It doesn't make the emotion any less real or \nvaluable. What it does do is remind us of how vulnerable and delicate we \nare. It reminds us that we will die and cease to exist like a computer \nwhose hard drive is formatted. It is a scary thought, so it's natural that \nwe defend against this fear through wishful thinking, but this comes at a \ncost: you will never be fully aware.",

                    "text": "+John Manuel I have said REAL science, meaning what we define today as \nscience. As I already said , according to your definition even alchemy \nwould be a science, or astrology.Real science is way more then what you are \ntrying to make it sound. Did you even read the link I gave you ? The big \nproblem is how to find things out, and how to know what you found out is \nactually correct. If you really think about that, you understand what I am \ntalking about. I agree that we where finding things out before that, but \nnot by doing science, not really. At best we used some kind of pre-science \nresearch, which still lacked much of the framework and rules that defines \nreal science.at the worst we used magical thinking.\nPerhaps a little story explains the difference.  One day a smith didn't \nhave enough water in his cooling bucket (if you suddenly cool for example a \nsword like that.the characteristics  of iron/steel change, depending  in \ntemperature etc.)\nSo he advised his helper, a 12 year old boy, to piss into it, so he could \ncool the sword. You see  he had to do it right away, or the sword would be \nspoiled. The sword turned out to be much better then expected. So he \nexperimented a bit, and it was indeed the Urin of the boy, that made the \niron sharper and harder. the best result was pure morning urin, but his own \nwouldn't work, only the boys would. He passed the secret on   to a few \nother smiths, and soon all the fine swordsmiths knew : if you want a real \nfine sword, you need morning urin from a virgin red head.\nAccording to you what they did was science, while I say it was not. You see \nthe reason this works  was a genetic defect, that let read heads piss out \nmore salt then a normal person would. If you harden iron in salt water it \nbecomes harder then in sweet water. See the big difference ? Real science \nfinds out WHY it works, which is much better, cause then you often can \napply it in many different ways, while their knowledge only helped them to \nmake better swords. Also real science did find a much easier and cheaper \nway to get the result, because it doesn't just accept the results we have \nalready. It constantly questions them, to get a deeper understanding of \nwhat is going on.\nHere you find one of my sources (scroll down to Brian Meek's post, I \ncouldn't find a better one in a hurry , but I have the same story in a boo \nk on metallurgy, so it is correct)",

I'm curious about your definition of fact.\n\nStrictly speaking, science does not deal with facts.  To science, gravity \nis tantamount to being a fact, i.e., a theory, because it has been tested, \nretested, and built upon.  It is generally assumed as fact.\n\nLikewise, the process of evolution is a theory.  Most people mistakenly \ndefine (and use causally) the word theory as a synonym of hypothesis.  \"I \nhad a theory about that...\"  No.  A theory is a accepted, workable body of \nevidence, again tantamount but not considered a fact.  Science doesn't deal \nwith facts because to do so would be folly \u2013 scientists don't come to a \nconclusion, call it a fact, and say, \"That's that.\"  Everything is suspect.\n\nDo we know everything about the evolution of life on earth over the past 4 \nbillion years?  Absolutely not.  But, we can continue to test and retest \nthe theory, each new piece of evidence teaching us something new or \ncorroborating our predictions.\n\nFinally, I cannot subscribe to your dogma that DNA = designer = DNA = \ndesigner.  There are minerals.  There are inert gasses.  There are \ncompounds.  None of these are proof of a designer.  DNA is a happenstance \noutcome of complex proteins stringing themselves together, reacting and \ninteracting with the chemicals of the world around them.\n\nIn a nutshell, that's all life is about, and all we do, too.",

Everything \nwould have to be in place pretty much PRONTO and an extra- (what would a \nextra-terrestrial  except,  \"He\" would be outside of the cosmos?)   holding \nit together meanwhile.  Tyson has suggested to Dawkins that we've been \nseeded from another planet.  Which is what I would think except the Bible \nhas proved historically and geographically accurate and 99% textually pure. \n Which is impossible but it is true.  40 books, 40 different authors over \nthousands of years, same subject.  You don't know that evolution is \ntrue-it's a mantra.  You've been brain washed.  There are many 'scientific' \nexplanations of the cosmos and the theories all change--no apology required \napparently and all of the numbers change with each theory.  It's not \nscience.                                                                   \n                                       I like you so much but you sound \nlike a Tyson college student fan with your snottiness.  Or Bill Maur (sp?) \nmocking.  Very unmanly and ignorant.  Remember when the teacher would say \nI'll see you tomorrow and there were always a couple of kids that would \nyell, \"But tomorrow is Saturday!\"   That sort of mentality\ufeff",

The first half of your first \nsentence refers to abiogenesis, The formation of life from non-living \nmaterial, not evolution, the diversification of life through natural \nselection. The second half of you first sentence makes no sense because the \nbig bang did not produce anything. The big bang was an event in which the \nuniverse as we know it expanded out of the singularity of matter and \nenergy. The matter and energy were already there. now where they came from, \nwe don't know at this point, and when I say \"we\" that includes you as well. \nYour second sentence is just flat out wrong because most organisms do not \nbecome more intelligent as they evolve. Intelligence is not a goal for \nevolution, because evolution has no goal or end game. it's just a natural \nprocess, that changes organisms over time. Our intelligence was most likely \nthe result of a beneficial mutation. The ability to make moral choices is \nnot restricted to us either. There are plenty of other animals that make \nmoral choices in their daily lives and they do it with out being told to. \nObjectively, there is no reason/purpose for life. Subjectively there are a \nmultitude of reasons and purposes for life. What yours is is completely up \nto you. No I do not believe all christians are catholic republicans.

                    "text": "+chrismay1a WHY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD ATHEIST\n\n(Read all of it, let's see if you can be objective and expressive with \nlogical conclusions of factual observation and reasoning.)\n\nWhile it is true that there is no definitive atheistic worldview, all \natheists share the same fundamental beliefs as core to their personal \nworldviews. While some want to state that atheism is simply a disbelief in \nthe existence of a god, there really is more to it. Every expression of \natheism necessitates at least three additional affirmations:\n\n1. The universe is purely material. It is strictly natural, and there is no \nsuch thing as the supernatural (e.g., gods or spiritual forces).\n2. The universe is scientific. It is observable, knowable and governed \nstrictly by the laws of physics.\n3. The universe is impersonal. It does not a have consciousness or a will, \nnor is it guided by a consciousness or a will.\n\nDenial of any one of those three affirmations will strike a mortal blow to \natheism. Anything and everything that happens in such a universe is \nmeaningless. A tree falls. A young girl is rescued from sexual slavery. A \ndog barks. A man is killed for not espousing the national religion. These \nare all actions that can be known and explained but never given any meaning \nor value.\nA good atheist -- that is, a consistent atheist -- recognizes this dilemma. \nHis only reasonable conclusion is to reject objective meaning and morality. \nThus, calling him \"good\" in the moral sense is nonsensical. There is no \nmorally good atheist, because there really is no objective morality. At \nbest, morality is the mass delusion shared by humanity, protecting us from \nthe cold sting of despair.\nFor those of you who think you're about to light up this supposed straw man \nand raze me to the ground, consider the following:\n\"Modern science directly implies that there ... is no ultimate meaning for \nhumans.\"\n--William Provine\n\"The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if \nthere is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing \nbut blind, pitiless indifference. ... DNA neither knows nor cares. DNA just \nis. And we dance to its music.\"\n--Richard Dawkins\n\"No species, ours included, possesses a purpose beyond the imperatives \ncreated by its genetic history.\"\n--Edward O. Wilson\nBased on the nonnegotiable premises of atheism, these are the only logical \nconclusions. But I've never met an atheist who's managed to live this way. \nAll the atheists I've known personally and from afar live as if there is \nobjective meaning and morality. How is this explained? In a Hail Mary-like \nattempt to reconcile the inescapability of objective morality and their \nassurances of atheism, two possible answers are launched.\n\n1. Morality is the result of socio-biological evolution. This is a \ntwo-pronged attempt at justifying moral claims. First, a sense of morality \nevolved to ensure human survival. Much like an eye or tooth, it is \nnecessary for the human race to continue. If this were true, for any claim \nto be moral, it would have to serve the practical purpose of advancing the \nhuman race. So compassion for the dying would be immoral, and killing \nmentally handicapped children would be moral. Perhaps the most moral action \nwould be men raping many women and forcing them to birth more children.\nMorality, in this view, can only mean those actions that are helpful to \nmake more fit humans. It does nothing to help us grapple with the truth \nthat it's always wrong to torture diseased children or rape women.\nSecond, morality was developed to ensure the success of societies, which \nare necessary for human survival and thriving. Like the rules of a board \ngame, morality is contrived to bring us together for productivity and \nhappiness. If this were true, there is nothing to which we can appeal when \nwe find the behavior of other societies repugnant and reprehensible. \nBecause morality is the construct of a social group, it cannot extend \nfurther than a society's borders or endure longer than a society's \nexistence.\nFurthermore, within our own society, the most immoral are not merely the \nones who transgress our code but the ones who intend to change it. This \nwould make those fighting for marriage equality the most immoral -- that \nis, until they become the majority and institute change. I suppose they \nthen become moral, and traditionalists become immoral. But it's the math \nthat determines rightness or wrongness of a side, not the content of any \nbelief or argument.\nSo this view of morality does nothing to provide a reasonable answer for \nwhy it would be objectively wrong to torture diseased children, rape women \nor kill those who don't affirm a national religion. It only provides a \nmotivation for continuing the delusion of objective morality.\n\n2. Morality is logical. Atheists who take this route start in a position of \ncheckmate without realizing it. First, the temptation is to pervert this \nconversation into a debate about whether atheists can be moral. Of course \nthey can. That is not the question. The question is how we make sense of \nmoral claims if we play by the rules that atheism demands.\nMorality may be logical, but logic does not equate to morality. The only \nway to make a logical moral argument is to presuppose morality and meaning \nto start with. Try making a logical argument that slavery is wrong without \npresupposing morality. It is impossible. A woman wrote to me with her \nattempt at doing just that. Her claim was that slavery is logically wrong \nbecause it diminishes other human beings. The problem is that that argument \npresupposes human dignity. In the strict framework of atheism outlined \nabove, what reason is there to ever assume human dignity?\nAll logical arguments for morality assume that human thriving, happiness \nand dignity are superior to contrary views. The strict framework of atheism \ndoes not allow for those starting points. So any person arguing for 1 or 2 \nwould not be a good atheist. That is, he lives in contradiction to the \nmandates of his worldview.\n\nConclusion\nIntelligent people ask serious questions. Serious questions deserve serious \nanswers. There are few questions more serious than the one I'm asking. How \ndo we explain objective meaning and morality that we know are true? If a \nworldview can't answer this question, it doesn't deserve you.\nOne sign that your worldview may be a crutch is that it has to appeal to an \nanswer outside itself -- becoming self-contradictory, unable to reasonably \naccount for the question. Any atheist who recognizes objective meaning and \nmorality defies the atheism that he contends is true.\nIf your worldview can't makes sense of the things that make most sense to \nyou (like objective morality), then it's not worth your allegiance. This \nnew reality may launch you onto a journey of reluctant discovery. Whoever \nyou are. Wherever you are. Whatever you believe. You deserve a foundation \nthat is strong enough to carry the values that carry you.",

We do it and its capital punishment, God does it an its genocide.  \nMathmatically speaking all of that (Biblical historical narrative) is much \nmore plausible then something for which you have no narrative and no \nevidence.  Both models require faith as you can not prove either.  What an \nass, here is logic for you, ask an evolutionist how he knows how old the \nrocks are and he say's by the fossils in the rocks, ask him how old the \nfossils are and he will tell by how old the rocks are. \ufeff",

Why should it always \nboil down to science?  Evolutionary science has such a limited scope and \nreally understands little of our natural world and nothing of origins.  \nScience (in general) must first be objective to be legitimate, which (for \nthe most part) it is not.  Real science understands its limitations and \nrefuses tow any line.  Evolutionary thought (not facts) supplants real \nresearch and real results.  Science should admit that there is not one idea \nor test result that cannot be interpreted in another way, but it does not. \nI have not denied the origins of citations, they come from reading.  I have \nno trouble citing a Creation site if that is the case, however I have spent \nless time on creation sites then you have spent eating breakfast this week.\nDr Gentry and Polonium halo's, what you will tell me now is he is not a \nlegitimate scientist or that his Creationism makes his research flawed.\nI cite the scientists, Humphrey's, Coffin, Auston, (Goulds student), Wise,  \nyou do the research.  I have summarized what many of the Creationist \nscientists have represented as evidence in these posts.    \n\"Why would someone assume biological evolution was true if scientific \nevidence did not indicate it was? What purpose would that serve?\" Did you \nreally ask that question? \nAgain why would I have to define uniformitarianism to someone as clearly \nwell spoken and as intelligent as you (I am not being sarcastic). \nYou have proved a formidable opponent, if just for the length of your \nposts.  I will admit you are knowledgable, but biased (as I would expect \nyou to be), as you would expect me to be, albeit for different reasons.  To \nsuggest that Creationist have no science to support what they believe is a \nbit, or more than a bit arrogant.  The science you criticize or the \nscientists you criticize are not stupid men any more than you are stupid. \nLets try this, pick a subject, 1 subject at a time and limit posts to 50-60 \nlines (even that is allot), you go first. \n ",

                    "text": "+TheGateKeeper\nOnce again, you can commit to whatever you CHOOSE to commit to. I have a \nlife as well (including a business to run) so the old \"I have a life\" cop \nout won't cut it here. Either present better arguments or admit you have no \ninterest in putting forth the effort.\n\nI suggest you look up the word \"narrative\" because my responses do not fit \nthat definition.\n\nMeaningless words? So thorough responses to your arguments are meaningless \nto you? Perhaps if you made an effort to understand my points instead of \nbeginning with the assumption that I'm wrong, this conversation would go \nmuch better.\n\n1) So once again you prefer to reject demonstrable science in favor of \nfaith based religious teachings. You also seem either unwilling or \nincapable of acknowledging\n\n2a) It is for those willing to actually examine and learn the science \nrather than rejecting science in favor of what an ancient religion tells \nyou to believe on faith. Once again you seem to be just another creationist \ninsisting you understand science better than the worldwide scientific \ncommunity. Such staggering hubris your religion instills in you.\n\n2b) Nothing at all wrong with copying and pasting a citation....but doing \nso from a religious source about scientific issues and then DENYING you did \nso when the evidence is crystal clear that you did is quite wrong. What \ndoes your religion say about bearing false witness? It also didn't \n\"intelligently answer the question\". Not even close. Once again, try \nchecking SCIENTIFIC sources for SCIENTIFIC information.\n\n2c) As I already pointed out, I'm quite familiar with creationist claims \nand they are not accepted (or even testable) scientific arguments. I'm \ntrying to get you to cite one you think DOES have scientific merit (i.e. \nfrom a purely scientific source).\n\nJust \"see Dr Russell Humpreys\"?? Can you not cite anything more specific? \nWhat research of his supports your claim that \"Over 90% of dating methods \nsupport a young earth\"?? Where is the research that demonstrates this? What \nwere his testing methods? In what scientific journals can i find his work \ndemonstrating this? Or are you just, once again, taking on faith what \nreligious sources are telling you about science? Why do you suppose the \nscientific community (and even many creationists) are not convinced in the \nleast with Humphrey's assertions?\n\n2d) Yes, not believing in a god could be considered a belief...but not a \nbelief SYSTEM as one answer to one question, by definition,  does not \nconstitute a system. Also, atheism and biological evolution are separate \nissues. One does not necessitate the other. There are MANY theists who \naccept biological evolution and there are some atheists who do not (though \nnot many that I'm aware of). Biological evolution also does not require \nbelief any more than gravity or chemical interaction requires belief. Its \nnot a belief system at all. Its a field of science studying and describing \nbiodiversity. As I've pointed out before, there's a REASON its the unifying \ntheory in modern biology.\n\n3a) You mean the Behe who was humiliated in the Dover trial when it became \nclear he was pushing a religious agenda rather than a scientific one? I'm \nquite familiar with the old \"irreducible complexity\" talking point and \nagain, it holds no weight in biology. I challenge you to cite ANY \ncreationist example of irreducible complexity and I'll show you in detail \nwhy its NOT irreducibly complex. Should we start with the bacterial \nflagellum? The immune system perhaps? The human eye maybe? Take your pick \nand we'll go from there.\n\nand you didn't answer the question. Why would someone assume biological \nevolution was true if scientific evidence did not indicate it was? What \npurpose would that serve?\n\n3b) Again, you didn't answer the question.\n\n3c) No, you haven't. You have not presented ANY scientist or aspect of \nscience insisting biological evolution must be believed on faith. Can you \ndo this or not? Quit dodging questions and challenges and put your evidence \nwhere your mouth is.\n\nYou also have not pointed out where in my arguments can be found any \n\"militancy\" or \"dogma\".\n\n4a) No YOU are talking in circles by avoiding any meaningful response to my \nquestions and challenges. How does biological evolution dominate any field \noutside of the life sciences? How does it dominate physics? How does it \ndominate geology? Quantum mechanics? Cosmology? Scientists accepting a \nscientific theory as most likely true because its been demonstrated \nrepeatedly is not \"domination\"...its acknowledgment of observed reality \nwhich is an intrinsic part of the scientific method. Present a theory \nbetter explaining biodiversity and science will drop evolution like a hot \nrock. I'm sorry but \"an invisible god did it with mysterious magic\" won't \ncut it.\n\n4b) What about Charles Lyell and Darwin??  What about Mt St Helens and \nSteve Austin??? You can't just throw out a name with no explanation and \nexpect me to guess what you're referring to. Give me specifics and we can \nexamine them in detail right here for all to see.\n\nYou're right I skipped to 5b. My apologies.\n\n5b) People respond the same way they would if you challenge gravity or germ \ntheory or any other well supported scientific idea....especially if those \nchallenges are as hilariously vapid as \"I didn't come from no monkey \nbecause an ancient superstitious culture says I poofed here from magic!\"\n\nWhat \"holy authorities\"? As i already pointed out, no scientist is held as \nan unassailable authority and no theory is held as sacred. Science \nNECESSARILY works under the recognition that ANY person or idea could be \nwrong. How many people who  challenged scientific ideas have ever been \nforcibly silenced, jailed or killed? None. Challenging and testing ideas is \na cornerstone of science and one reason its so reliable. Now how many \npeople who challenged your religion's tenents have been forcibly silenced, \njailed or killed? The list is long. Creationists are just angry because \ntheir RELIGIOUS challenges to well supported scientific ideas hold no \ndemonstrable merit except to the religiously faithful and scientifically \nilliterate.\n\n6) \"whatever\" is not a response...its a dodge.  You didn't address ANY of \nthe points in 6a or b.\n\nWhat citations??? Concerning what???\n\nWhat type of \"proof\" for what exactly would you like? Would any evidence \nEVER convince you these widely accepted scientific ideas were correct? I \nsuspect that, just like Ken Ham and every other creationist, your answer \nwill be \"No, no evidence will change my mind.\" because you've fully \ncommitted to religious faith just as your religion instructs you to.\n\nI'm sorry these posts are so long but short little sentences don't get the \njob done when discussing complex topics like these. My responses could be \nMUCH longer considering the massive amount of scientific information \navailable but I've tried to be as succinct as possible.\n\nI HAVE been going one subject at a time. That's what the numbering system \nis for.\n\nPlease stop with the old bit of projecting religion's faults on to others. \nUnlike religion, science doesn't rely on time or verbosity or faith or \nauthority to demonstrate what's true...it relies on evidence and repeated \ntesting. Try it.\n\nAt this point I suspect you don't know what \"uniformitarianism\" actually \nmeans. Please demonstrate you do.",

                    "text": "+TheGateKeeper\n1) So are you conceding point 1? Does this mean you acknowledge the \ndemonstrability of an old earth and that scientific findings are not \nextrapolated from politics but from independently verifiable evidence?\n\n2a) Neither I nor science points to the Cambrian explosion as \"something \nfrom nothing\". Its your religion that insists something magically poofed \nout of nothing. The Levinton article (which apparently you STILL have not \nread) goes over why we have very few pre-cambrian fossils and I even posted \npart of that section in my reply. Its patently absurd and childish to \ninsist that just because we don't yet have a good understanding of \npre-cambrian taxonomy then cambrian organisms must have been magically \npoofed here by some invisible wizard. That's Harry Potter thinking.\n\n2b) I'm supposed to believe that you did NOT copy and paste from a \ncreationist source when what you posted uses the EXACT same wording and \npunctuation (including citation numbering) as that source??? Why not cite \nthe \"books and periodicals\" you used then, including issue and page number \nto demonstrate it? In either case, using religious \"books/periodicals\" as a \nsource for science info is just as ridiculous as using religious websites \nfor science info.\n\n2c) The scientific research IS easy to retrieve and I've posted some nice \nsources for you but just like other creationists, you seem to distrust and \navoid SCIENTIFIC sources for SCIENCE info and prefer instead religious \nsources. It DOES speak for itself if you actually READ IT and make an \nattempt to UNDERSTAND IT instead of ignoring it in favor of what religious \nsources tell you about it. Why is this so difficult a concept to \ncomprehend? Take a biology course. Open a biology textbook. Read the \npublished research. Talk to respected scientists in the field. You can even \ntest the research for yourself !!!\n\n2d) \"if it needs an interpreter then it is evangelism and a belief system.\" \nYou really have no idea how ludicrously incorrect that sentence is do you? \nJust because a subject is complex and requires effort to understand does \nnot make it \"evangelism\" or \"a belief system\". Unfortunately for many \npeople, making that effort is just too much to ask and simple (but \ndemonstrably wrong) explanations of mysterious magic are preferable. Like \nmany other religious people, you're basically saying \"I don't understand it \nso I'll just believe god did it with magic because that's easier\". That's \nintellectual laziness.\n\n3a) Once again, biology doesn't suggest \"something from nothing\" \nanywhere....creationism does. So if that's what you have issues with then \nyou're completely on the wrong side of the fence....or just being \nridiculously hypocritical.\n\nBiological evolution is not ASSUMED by scientists...its what examining \norganisms has revealed. What purpose would assuming evolution serve if it \nwasn't strongly indicated by observation and experimentation? Furthermore, \nbiological evolution has no influence on other unrelated scientific fields \nlike physics, cosmology, geology etc. so your assertion that scientists \ndon't see design in those fields just because they're \"assuming evolution\" \nis ridiculous. How different species have developed has no bearing on how a \nquark spins or how tectonic plates move or how stars form. In fact, its \ndiscovered facts in these other fields that FURTHER informs how evolution \nworks. The vast majority of scientists in ALL fields of science accept \nevolution because its demonstrably evident.\n\nOnce again I'll ask you, if you think EVERYTHING in the universe (including \nthe universe itself) is intentionally designed then tell me what something \nthat IS NOT designed looks like. If you think EVERYTHING displays the \ncharacteristics of \"order, cohesiveness, and complexity\" and these traits \nindicate design then show me something without those traits as a basis for \ncomparison. You can't. Complexity does not require design. Order is imposed \nby our own minds in an effort to understand what we observe. As for \ncohesiveness, I don't even know what you're referring to there. Even human \nsociety is only \"cohesive\" some of the time. As I said before, we recognize \nwhat is designed by their differences to what occurs naturally and by \nexamining the processes by which they arise. If you think EVERYTHING is \ndesigned then you have no frame of reference for identifying what is NOT \ndesigned. You would have no idea what characteristics something not \ndesigned would have.\n\n3b) Simply copying and pasting one of my sentences without addressing it \ndoes you no good. If you're saying I'm beginning with a conclusion of \nevolution, I'll ask again WHY anyone would do this. What purpose would that \nserve? The purpose of assuming the things religion tells people to believe \nis made quite clear by the religion itself, but exactly what purpose would \nassuming biological evolution serve if it wasn't indicated by the evidence \nto be what actually occurs? I suspect the only answer you can give to this \nwould be a religious one.\n\n3c) Where in biology (or anywhere else in science) is anyone insisting \nevolution should be believed on faith? The only people asserting this are \ncreationists like yourself.\n\nWhat militancy or dogma can be found anywhere in my arguments? Please point \nthem out. Making an argument does not constitute either of those things. I \nwould suggest you look those words up before making that assertion again.\n\n4a) \"Results\" really is the operative word there as evolutionary biology \nDOES produce results (and has for decades) not just in understanding \nbiology but also in medicine, agriculture and even manufacturing. Also, \ninstead of reiterating the point about the vast majority of scientists \naccepting evolution, in an attempt to paint this as somehow a BAD thing \n(not sure how it could be), why not attempt to understand WHY they accept \nit....and leave the ridiculous conspiracy theories at home.\n\n4b) I asked you WHICH \"uniformitarian assumptions\" you were referring to. \nBe specific. There is no assumption to how natural laws have worked in the \npast compared to how they work now. We've simply seen no evidence any \nnatural laws were different at any time (following the beginning of \nexpansion) so why would we assume they were different? In fact everything \nscience has examined demonstrates these laws pretty constant thus far. This \nis one of the stranger creationist objections to science. Do you have any \nidea how DRASTIC a change in these laws would have to be to account for the \ngap between the time scales science has uncovered and what young earth \ncreationists believe?\n\n5b) Of course biological evolution is \"institutionalized\" in \nscience....just like Newton's laws of motion, chemical bonds, gravity, \natomic interaction and every other well supported scientific idea. So what? \nOnce again, the only problem there is that these specific scientific ideas \nabout evolution are a threat to SOME people's religious beliefs.\n\nOnce again, I ask you to point out what scientist or scientific methodology \ninsists \"has to be correct, beneficial, and accepted\" about anything in \nscience. You simply won't find it. You'll find it all over the place in \nyour religion though. As I've repeatedly pointed out to you and you simply \nrefuse to accept, nothing in science is sacred or immune to questioning, \nrevision or being overturned. There are no unassailable holy authorities or \ncommandments written in stone. Those things are found in religion, not \nscience.\n\n6a) No, meaning what science can observe and test just like human mind and \nsenses. Once again, if you know of some way science (or human senses) can \nobserve and test what's beyond the natural world, do speak up. Until then, \ncreationist objections to scientific naturalism are no different than \ncomplaining that cars don't fly to other galaxies. Its simply not possible \nthus far.\n\n6b) Time will permit whatever you choose to make time for. You apparently \nchoose not to cite any specific cases of any valid scientific evidence from \nany creationists. You seem to think I'm asking for citation because I'm not \naware of these claims. I've being engaging on these topics for years and \nI'm quite aware of most creationist claims. I'm asking you to specifically \ncite them for 4 reasons:\n  1) So we can directly address them here one by one.\n  2) If any of this evidence has merit I want to know about it.\n  3) So you can see for yourself that this creationist evidence is not \nfound in any scientific journal.\n  4) So everyone reading this thread can see if you use any purely \nscientific sources or if you (as I suspect) only use RELIGIOUS sources for \nyour science info.\n\nOf course I'll point out the questionable nature of the source if I see it \nas questionable. Why wouldn't I? If you think that's the ONLY thing I would \naddress then you haven't been paying attention. You cited one source thus \nfar and I addressed it and its contents quite thoroughly, did I not?\n\nI'd also appreciate it if you would make an effort to answer the questions \nI ask instead of just ignoring them. You've ignored many many direct \nquestions thus far.",

Where are the predessors \nof the basic taxonomic groupings in the Cambrian?  Sorry not in the \nprecambrian, or anywhere else for that matter. The fossil record continues \nto betray your assumptions of something from nothing.\n2b.)

I don't frequent \nCreationists sites, though I read books and periodicals they contribute to \nor publish.\n2c&d). Frankly if there is so much evidence for Evolution, it should be \neasy enough to retrieve.  It should also speak for itself, if it needs an \ninterpreter then it is evangelism and a belief system.\n3a.)  You like to complicate things.  We live in a natural world with \nnatural processes, does that mean accident, random processes, only if you \npresume Evolution.  Photosynthesis is natural, as are all other life \nprocesses, what that tells me (observation) that the order, cohesiveness, \nand complexity (like any artificial) has to have a designer.  Something \nfrom nothing is counter intuitive (stupid). \n3b.)  \"You're beginning with a preferred conclusion instead of following \nthe evidence where it leads.\" \n3c.)   \"Once again, faith and unquestioning authority are the purview of \nreligion, 'and Evolutionary',(my emphasis) science.\"  Your militancy and \ndogma vastly exceed your evidence.\n4a.)

Doesn't (obviously) make it \nright, but like anything else with the name \"science\" it has to be correct, \nbeneficial, and accepted. \n6a.)  \"naturalist assumptions\"  meaning your Evolutionary paradigm. \n6b.)  Google it.

                    "text": "+TheGateKeeper First off, sufficiently addressing your assertions cannot be \ndone in a single short post.\n\n1) You said rapid FOSSILIZATION before, not rapid burial. Rapid burial is \nnot a prerequisite either, though it certainly helps. Calcium carbonate \n(chalk), for example, is made up of fossils of microscopic marine organisms \n(coccolithophores) which are not rapidly buried and build up over VERY long \nperiods of time. There are layers of chalk hundreds of feet thick (the \nWhite Cliffs of Dover in England) which COULD NOT HAPPEN if the earth were \nless than 10,000 years old.\n\n2a) What do you mean by \"fully developed\"? Do you think evolution predicts \norganisms with only half a body? The Cambrian \"explosion\" occurred over \napproximately a 50-80 million year period around 550 million years ago! Do \nyou really think it helps your case for young earth creationism?? It was a \nRELATIVELY rapid period of complex development.\n\n2b) You're just copying and pasting from a creationist website, apparently \nCreation MINISTRIES (yeah, that's scientific) or one of the many religious \nsites that copied from it. The creationist author of your article proceeds \nto dishonestly quote mine and twist the Scientific American article by \nLevinton.    Levinton NEVER said in that article that \"no new or different \nbody plans appeared after the Cambrian\". Here's what Levinton actually said \nright in his first paragraph:\n      \"FEW new major body plans have appeared since that time. Just as all \nautomobiles are fundamentally modeled after the first four-wheel vehicles, \nall the evolutionary changes since the Cambrian period have been mere \nvariations on these basic themes.\"\n\nHe goes on to say:\n       \"The progenitors of the distinct animal groups found in the Cambrian \ncould conceivably have diverged hundreds of millions of years earlier, yet \nthey might not have left fossils because they lacked shells or skeletons. \nIf so, the Cambrian diversification might not have been as explosive as is \ngenerally assumed.\"\n\nI highly recommend you read the full Levinton article in Scientific \nAmerican Nov 1992 and see for yourself all the information your creationist \nsource conveniently left out.\n \n2c) Notice how the creationist article you're referencing doesn't cite any \ncreationist research in scientific journals. There's a reason for that. \nCreationists cannot present ANY research, experimentation or independently \nverifiable observation demonstrating their religious (not scientific) idea \nof magical special creation. All they continue to do is throw stones at the \nvast amount of scientific research that deals with biological evolution and \nhope religious audiences (who are used to believing on faith what they are \ntold to) believe as they're told without checking for themselves.\n\n2d) Its not my job to hunt for evidence to support your argument. Its your \njob to find that evidence and present it. Its also a good idea to learn \nabout the subject you're dealing with from the most knowledgeable sources \non that subject, i.e the worldwide scientific community and the research \nthey've produced. You wouldn't go to a hairdresser to learn about \nengineering and likewise, you shouldn't be going to theologians to learn \nabout biology.\n\n3a) You disagree that DNA is naturally occurring? The \"everything else\" \nyou're referring to are SPECIFICALLY MAN MADE THINGS. We know things such \nas buildings, cars, painting etc. are \"creations\" because they do not occur \nnaturally and we can examine the processes by which humans create them. Do \nthese characteristics apply to the things you believe a god created? Can we \nexamine the process by which this god created things? Can we even examine \nthe creator itself in order to determine what it can create or has created? \nNo, we can't. You're simply assuming this creator exists and it created \neverything because an ancient primitive culture says so.\n\nAlso, you didn't answer my question...how do you distinguish between the \nartificial and the natural if you believe EVERYTHING is intentionally \ncreated? What would something natural look like?\n\n3b) Neither I nor science has ever said the natural world COULDN'T have a \n\"Creator/Designer\"....I'm simply asking for the evidence that supports your \nargument that it does have a creator. Everything we've examined within the \nuniverse thus far and found a cause for is explained by natural mechanisms \nwith no mysterious magical \"creator\" necessary to explain it. Even if you \ncould demonstrate that everything was created/designed, how do you reliably \ndetermine what created/designed it? Will you just assume that the \nparticular creator you believe in is the one who did it? Maybe something \ncompletely different made it all. You're beginning with a preferred \nconclusion instead of following the evidence where it leads.\n\n3c) Unlike religion, science does not insist you believe the information it \npresents \"because they say so\". Instead, science presents the data and \nmethodology used to reach these conclusions and invites (as a necessity) \nanyone to test for themselves. Once again, faith and unquestioning \nauthority are the purview of religion, not science.\n\n4a) You and other creationists always attempt to paint \"evolutionists\" as \nsome fringe group separate from the scientific community...yet the \noverwhelming majority of the worldwide scientific community accepts \nevolution (even higher percentage of biologists). Creationism is the fringe \ngroup with only a relatively tiny handful of scientists rejecting evolution \non purely religious grounds.\n\n4b) What \"ridiculous uniformatarian assumptions\" do you think scientific \ndating methods are based on? Atomic decay is ridiculous to you? Can you \nsuggest a more reliable method for dating material? Once again, can you \ncite a single purely scientific (non religious) source in your Google \nsearches which says these methods are so unreliable? Do you see a pattern \nyet? Its amazing that you're still lifting talking points from blatantly \nreligious sources about science.\n\n5) Biology is only PARTLY funded by tax dollars (and nowhere near \nbillions)....just like EVERY OTHER FIELD OF SCIENCE that you seem to have \nno problem with (because it doesn't threaten your religious beliefs). Are \nyou suggesting the largely CHRISTIAN representation in government is using \ntax dollars to pay off scientists to lie and say evolution is true when it \nisn't, and somehow every scientist accept a tiny few fundamentalist \nCHRISTIANS are going along with this massive conspiracy? WTF??? How does \nthat even remotely make sense??? What possible motivation would be behind \nsuch a conspiracy?\n\n6a) Of course science is based on \"naturalistic assumptions\"...because the \nnatural world is all that science can observe and test! If you know of some \nway science can observe and test what's OUTSIDE of the natural world then \nplease do share it and take your place in history for changing the course \nof human understanding. Don't confuse philosophical naturalism with \nmethodological naturalism. Nowhere in science is it stated that the natural \nworld is all there ist...only that the natural world is all that science \ncan deal with (as far as we know). Concurrently, the natural world is all \nthat the HUMAN MIND AND SENSES can deal with. Unless of course you think \nyou have some special power to see beyond the natural world (besides \nimagination).\n\n6b) I'm sorry but you don't get to avoid substantiating your assertions by \njust saying \"google it\". Again, its not our job to hunt for evidence for \nyour argument. Cite your sources of \"plenty of contrary evidence brought \nforward by reputable scientists that is rejected because they are \nCreationists\". Who and what evidence? I certainly hope you can do better \nthan just citing Ben Stein.",

It proves evolution. The only \nreason why its rapid is because we do these experiments under controlled \nconditions, where we can change the environment quickly. Ice core samples \n(and many more lines of evidence) tell us that the environment changes \nslowly, hence the slow rate of evolution.\n\nLook, I would love to lay out all the evidence for you, but I really don't \nhave the time - I'm a student and I can't really afford to lose so much \ntime to something which has already been verified. Instead, let me redirect \nyou to some cites which can prove to you in great detail how much evidence \nthere really is.\n\nSimilarly, Global Warming is happening. And if you honestly think that \n'global warming' means that the earth is getting hotter everywhere, you \nmust know absolutely nothing about weather systems and currents. Global \nwarming is simply when the poles get hot, thus making ice caps melt, \nraising the sea level and disrupting the salinity of the water. Because of \nthe rise in sea level, the entire water system is going to be disrupted, \nwhich includes the weather. This is why we see far more cases of extreme \nweather conditions nowadays than we did 100-200 years ago. There is \ndefinitely a trend here - increasingly more species are becoming extinct \ndue to an inability to adapt to change in habitat (due to Global warming) \nand CO2 levels have never risen this much in such a short period of time. \nIt's a dramatic change for the planet, and we're beginning to see it. It's \nestimated that in less than 50 years, Venice will no longer exist - the \nsame applies for many cities. Sea level rise will drown them.\n\nUnfortunately, we've probably gone past the tipping point. But there are \nmany ways people are making conscious efforts to help and not fuck the \nplanet up entirely, at least to make the long term damages somewhat less \nthan what they could be if we continue to do this.\n\nAlright, if you want to do some reading on the evidence of evolution and \nglobal warming, check out these sites. I have read through them myself; I \ndon't want to regurgitate their information, nor do I want to spend any \nmore time arguing with a person who clearly seems to be chest deep into the \nquicksand that is scientific ignorance.\n\n1. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/index.shtml - pretty simple \nexplanation of it, but concise and easy to read.\n2. http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bio336/Bio336/Lectures/Lecture3/lec03.pdf a \nlong text, but worth the read as it explains the lines of evidence for \nevolution succinctly.\n3.http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/",

It's overwhelming evidence just like the overwhelming \nevidence for \"global warming\"; every hot day, hurricane, tornado, gust of \nwind now days is PROOF of anthropogenic global warming.\n\nEvery similar structure, DNA strand, ultra complex trait, every living \nthing is PROOF of Darwin's theory. I hear it all the time. There was an \nexample in my email today in some marketing copy: \"...discovered the top \nhalf of a bull elk\u2019s skull....broken off a few inches from the base.

It's \nall presumptive conjecture, there's no real objective proof offered. \n\nVery few, controversial(within science) transitional fossils offered, just \nconfident assertions that \"we have plenty\" and ignore the fact that no less \nan evolutionist luminary as Steven J Gould developed a theory, Punctuated \nEquilibrium, to explain away the overwhelming gaps.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils\n\n\"Junk DNA\" was a big home run for darwinism until further examination. The \n\"Junk DNA\" is actually functioning code that, among other things, allow for \nrapid adaptation to a given environment.\nThe adaptive traits are already coded for. They don't \"evolve\" through eons \nof trial and error. The recent experiments with silver foxes is definitive \nproof of this. The domesticated dog is another profound example of the \ngenome's capacity to produce (relatively)rapid variety from a source \nanimal(wolf).  \n\nTo the thinking person, rapid speciation, is overwhelming evidence AGAINST \nDarwin.

Great evidence. If they found more \nbones, then I could take what they think more seriously, you need more than \none or two, or more than few bones to get a picture of what it really looks \nlike. The censoring, I think they shouldn't have done that, I disagree with \ntheir choice. but generally, christians don't try to shut evolutions up, \nnor can they. But, the evolutionists are doing that to christian in a way, \nin school only one side of the argument is given, it would be fairer if the \ncreationist side was given and let the kids decide what to believe in. Have \nyou ever went to a public school where the kids were given a the other \npoint of the view for this Most of them believe that people should be free \nto believe what they believe in, they couldn't' do that in america even if \nthey wanted to anyway. How do you know that not all of them are research \ncenters? I think there's a good chance that a few might be, except we're \nnot told or we don't hear about that. If they do what any regular college \nwould, with research institutions, then I think they're colleges. It just \ndepends on which.",

In cases where it has become over-zealous \nconservative (sometimes even regressive) idealism (whether that's in terms \nof the commonly accepted concepts of religion, or in examples such as \nNazism or Stalinism), I think it ultimately makes itself a greatly \ndetrimental hindrance.

                    "text": "+paulczar Excellent; well said, Paul. Let me toss something out at you \n-- you've made a very good case for dumping religion; so if we're willing \nto lose the whole thing anyway, what's stopping us from taking what's \nbeneficial to us and leaving what's not?\n\n\"The Word of God\" indeed. Rather than thinking this to mean \"This book is \nwritten by God and is therefore literal and perfect\" let's look at an \nalternative example...\n\nMaybe I think \"God\" is the conglomerate consciousness of all things in the \nentire universe, from which we all have originated and remain a part of in \nthis moment. This pure, perfect, whole, utter well-beingness is our true \nnature and is the state that we return to after death. What is the \nperspective of this \"higher self?\" What does it have to say about this \nworld and our relationship to it? Well, we have here the \"Word of God,\" and \nwe may use it as a fulcrum to leverage ourselves into alignment with that \nof our true nature, AKA \"God.\"\n\n*Mark **12:17**, Jesus said unto them, \"Render to Caesar the things that \nare Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d*  Yes, the physical \nworld must have its due; your hair must be combed, you car fueled, your \natoms smashed and examined -- some attention on worldly matters is \nappropriate.\n\nBut we have said that there is something more than just the physical, and \nit must have its little attentions too. This sentiment includes the idea of \nthe Sabbath day, where one might give due attention to that deeper, higher \npart of oneself. What things are God's, that we should render unto \"him?\" \n\nWell, we can render our *attention* on being spiritually resourceful, and \ntapping into the power of God/self whenever it suits us. Centering \nyourself, calming down and breathing deeply for a few long minutes before \nmaking important decisions or starting important conversations -- or maybe \ndoing it just because it feels good to remind yourself who you truly are. \nWe can render our *permission* for this power to play an influential role \nin our lives.\n\nThis interpretation is beneficial to the person who holds the belief that \nwe began with, but you might find other meanings that speak to you from \nyour own perspective. I believe that in this way your deeper self  may \ncommunicate with you through your personal interpretation of the a passage.\n\nHere's something almost entirely overlooked: *we all may have different \ninterpretations and spiritual standards that benefit us most;* ones \nthat play into our unique perspective, rather than forcing a square peg \ninto a round hole. All spokes point toward the hub, and many \ninterpretations may point toward the same truth.\n\nSo what if we play fast-and-loose with the scriptures? Take the good and \nleave the bad, according to our own personal judgment -- never mind \nwhat anyone (no matter how fancily dressed) tells us it's supposed to \nmean. And how will you know  when you've struck on the \"right\" \ninterpretation? Because the one that is right for you (in that moment, at \nleast) will resonate with you on a deep level; it will feel profound \nand change your perspective.\n\n\"So who dictates what is to be taken literally and what is to be viewed as \nmore of a metaphor?\" It's our lives, it's our minds -- *we do.* This seems \nto be a course of action quite befitting a fully conscious, self-reliant \nbeing. What do you think?",

I'm not religious, but do think religion can be \nbeneficial to some people as it provides a sense of belonging, community, \nsupport group, etc... The bible can also provide good metaphors for \nrespecting your neighbor, being a good person, etc... And yet in the same \ntext maintains that owning slaves is an inherit right, that infidels must \nbe punished by death, outrageous acts of cruelty to women.... It goes on \nand on. So who dictates what is to be taken literally and what is to be \nviewed as more of a metaphor. Like I said, it's a nice idea and is \nrational, but it must be all or nothing in my opinion.

The moment a better \nmodel with more explanatory power and predictive capabilities comes up, \nevolution will be thrown out the window.\n\nYou have religious people constantly trying to undermine science.

When science proves \nsomething to be wrong, it is considered that it is to be discarded and that \neveryone who still follows it is following an outdated knowledge that \ndoesn't hold true in light of our current understanding of the universe.\n\nMany scientists have religious affiliation and that is irrelevant, \nconsidering that on the same network, on Fox, I can hear people say stuff \nlike \"Atheists are the minority, why should their voice matter?\". Science \ndoesn't care about religion, or should I say, shouldn't care, but religion \nconstantly tries to inject itself into scientific fields, only to protect \nitself.

The sample size is too small for one compared to the sample \nsize of cosmos watchers.

This then in essence is nothing more than small media making \ntheir 5 minute social media fame. This guy's title says \"Turk youth..\" \nunder it at the beginning.

Other fields provide sets of data as well.  Archaeology \nrequires cross-disciplinary research so many theories are not developed by \narchaeologist themselves but are incorporated in an individual's findings. \nBiology, zoology, anthropology, etc. So without this research from other \nfields archaeology can say nothing about human evolution. \n\n \nThis is not coming from an atheist but from a person with a B/A in \narchaeology in the graduate program, Ph.

I believe the science they use is not always backed up by \nfact. For example: Is drilling in Alaska mean we cannot save the polar \nbear. Is it either-or. I do not believe drilling in Alaska means that polar \nbears will die out. I also do not believe that wind and solar farms will \nwreck the eco-system. I do not buy the idea that we have to spend billions \nsaving the spotted owl. There is a book called ECO-FACISTS by Elizabeth \nNickson. That book is by far the best book on how the environmentalists \nhave misused ecology science as a way to advance their agenda. You tell me \nto not subject myself to political propaganda. Then that would rule out \nNeil Tyson as a serious person. Since he without a doubt has a political ax \nto grind. LOL Yes, I could use more sleep and perhaps I could cut back on \ncaffeine. You are right to say Tansley's ideas are used to promote the \nglobal warming agenda. And yes, that is my big problem with the politics of \nthe eco-system. You have a mind of science. I have a more political mind. \nThe main point I am making is that it is not just conservatives or \nreligious people who use bad science Liberals and environmentalists also \nuse bad science to promote their agenda. So yes that is my  covert way of \ndiscussing the global warming movement. I'm not sure if I agree it is \ncovert. I think I am pretty clear about it. I was not serious that you \nshould do some report on Noah's ark. Since I am not a scientist I cannot do \na peer researched article. When you talk about peer research.

Could be true, but it's \nstill a pretty big jump. You are asking me to write a scientific piece on \nwhy Tansley's unproven theory is wrong. That would be similar to my asking \nyou too write a piece on why the story of Noah's ark could not be true. The \nrelationship with non-living things of course is true. We need oxygen. Of \ncourse this is a political site. The young Turks are not scientists. My \nconcern is how liberals use Tansley's eco-system ideas to advance their \nagenda.

A lot of people would rather not. Many like the \nfalse certainty of myth over not knowing. Heaven and eternal afterlife is a \nvery seductive idea.

So I wouldn't \nconsider \"him\" the anti-christ.\n\n\"What if Instead he went around healing the sick who would accept him as \ngod bringing true happiness to all who chose to believe while leaving all \nnon-believers alone to live out their lives as they see fit?\"Would these \npeople still say their book is right and this is a false god?\nI bet they would and I even bet they would try to kill this person because \nit has to be the anti-christ, their book says so.  If people allow \nreligious belief to override logic and facts based on what men put in a \nbook thousands of years ago then those people are stupid.\"\n\n\nFirst, I would like to point out you pretty much describe the story of \nJesus, in simplistic terms, in these questions. He went around healing \npeople, he was worshipped by these people and he did bring happiness,(and \nstill does), to these people and he leaves the non believers to do as they \nwish. He was also killed by the religious people at the time.\n\nNow I can't speak for all believers, but as for myself, I would have to \nwait a see what this \"being\" does. If, as I believe you are trying to \nask/state, this was the true God and he said that all religions were \nfalse I would assume that he could prove it with out a doubt.  The reason I \nwould wait and see what he does, is because it is written that the \nanti-christ will come during a time of great tribulation and seem to have \nall the answers to all of our problems. It is also written that the \nanti-christ would come with lying signs and wonders to decieve the very \nelect if it were possible. So I guess a shorter answer would be, if he was \nGod and my belief was wrong, it would become self evident, as well as if my \nbeleifs were true, and he was the anti-christ, they also would become self \nevident.\n\nAs far as religious people trying to kill him, I'm sure there would be but \nthat would go against what the Bible teaches, but if he was God then they \nwould fail in there attempts. Sorry for the long winded response.",

He might have \ndisliked atheists because he thought them aspiritual (is that even a word?) \nand over materialistic. I don't know. I might be wrong. :)\n\nBottom line is, what Einstein believed is irrelevant to his contribution \n(as long as it doesn't get in the way of his own work), and him being \nEinstein doesn't validate or invalidate his kind of belief in any way.

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate \nit. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they \nwere naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for \nthemselves.\n\nAs to the knowledge part.

I appreciate the fact that we could share ideas without acting \nstupid or insulting, as I see other users do. I don't understand why people \nthink they would even earn respect by insulting other people who have \ndifference of opinion. We know that Paul was a Roman citizen, so he might \nhave had to be careful of what he wrote (like his letters that could get \nhim into trouble with the Roman authorities, would they have offended the \ngovernment of the day). That is part of the context that I believe that the \nreaders need to understand. If Mark and John wrote different versions of \nevents, that is why there are four gospels to begin with. Editing them and \nchanging them so that they seem less contradictory would be unscientific \nand dishonest. Even the court today acknowledge that witnesses give \ndifferent recounts of events, because we are dealing with people here. The \ncourt then has to decide which common evidence is accepted beyond \nreasonable doubt.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is not to insult your intelligence, only try to help \nyou understand the way I think. I actually agree with you that faith \ndoesn't always make sense. But then again, why does science make sense? Who \ndecided that 3 comes after 2 and before 4? Who decided that when you write \na sequence of symbols that it would become a message that both of us can \nunderstand? And why can't I understand all the languages of the world? We \nlearn this and we believe it. If you are going to show me a Japanese symbol \nfor boat I won't believe that it means boat until someone tells me that \nit's a boat. And such a \"someone\" can make up any lies and I would have to \nbelieve it, since I am not an expert on Japanese.\n\nNo matter what you believe, I hope you will be happy and find comfort in \nwhatever you believe in or don't. :-)",

                    "text": "+Morne Van der Berg First off, thanks for the reply and I apologize for \nhaving been overly sarcastic and antagonistic. I made the same erroneous \nassumption you did :)\n\nThere's a lot I agree with your post, especially the notions of legacy and \nesp. context, which I find extremely important when dealing with the bible \n(or any ancient text). People (on both sides) tend to forget it was written \nin very different times and places, and what seem ludicrous for us, such as \nthe \"no shrimps\" clause, actually made sense and was vital advice there and \nthen (bad seafood can kill you). From my atheist pov, if the wise men of \nthe times needed to invoke a supreme authority (God) and punishment to get \nbasic hygiene and social rules through their contemporaries' thick skull, \nthen so be it. It's a well-known parenting trick, after all.\n\nBy contradictions, I didn't mean OT vs. NT, but more both factual \ncontradictions and ideological / moral ones. Sticking to the OT, I can't \nreconcile \"You shall not kill\" with the endless string of massacres not \nonly condoned but ordered by God, to take the most obvious example. As for \nthe NT, it would be just fine as both a moral guideline and a historical \naccount (partially - transmutation, among other things, remains a bit \nfar-fetched) if Paul didn't feel the need to meddle after the fact and \nspread his vitriol and intolerance all over it.\n\nAnd there's very little things such as Jesus dying in three hours in Marc \nand  six in John. Trivial little details, but when you're supposed to \nconsider the scriptures as the Truth, a scientific mind can't help but \nquestion the whole thing from there (and I realize it can be argued that \nthey don't in fact contradict each others, and that's a matter of \ninterpretation etc... but if you need that level of explanation to justify \nthat very simple thing, then there's a problem).",

                    "text": "+Virginia I since we are quoting Google now, lol \nhttp://carm.org/why-apocrypha-not-in-bible ... to be honest, a person with \na Catholic background might not understand thy I say the apocrypha is not \npart of the Bible, since it was actually a long list of catholic popes who \ninsisted these apocrypha be somehow included in the Bible. It might be part \nof the Douay Rheims Bible, but NOT the King James version. When I refer to \nthe Bible, I refer to the KJV. I just pointed out psalm 118:8 as an example \nof the structure that the Bible has - and I do find it interesting that the \nmiddle chapter of the Bible is after the shortest chapter and before the \nlongest chapter, But even though I do not agree with everything you say, I \nrespect that you have different views. We have different views, since we \nhave had different experiences.But this is what it all boils down to: Some \nof us choose to believe in some things that others don't, even though \nbelief is something that is based on the unseen. Now we might change what \nwe believe in when we allow circumstances to change our resilience of \nfaith, but we still choose to believe. If it seems that all my comments \nwere directed just at you, I apologize (only if the shoe fits too often), \nbut really, you did mention elements from Enoch that suggested that it's \nmore like a fairy tale and then used it as an example of a book in the \nBible to illustrate that the Bible is also as such, where that notion, in \nfact challenges what many believe in. If I keep quiet and do not challenge \nthis in return, then what is the point in having faith at all? And about \nthe contradictions: The only reason why people find parts of the Bible \ncontradictory, is that they put verses together and out of context. Every \nstory has its context and should be seen in the time and place where it is \nintended to be. Matthew 5:38 is a good example. - you might say that this \ncontradicts what Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20 and Deuteronomy 19:21 says. \nWell, it does, because the speaker in Matthew 5 is Jesus and he is teaching \nthe people about the new covenant. The two hales of the Bible seem \ncontradictory, yes, since the old and new testaments describes two eras, \nbefore Christ and after Christ. Christ brought a new covenant. So why is \nthe old testament relevant then? to show the limits of man- even from the \nstarting point at Genesis. Then, eventually the prophets predict that there \nwould be a Saviour, a change, a difference - not wrath, but mercy. I will \nalways have respect for people with faith and the Bible, since I understand \nits context. Some maturity is required to look at the Bible sensibly. We \nare evolving as a human race- changing our understanding. Look at how much \nwe learned in the last 200 years, or even in the last 2000. Yes, people \ntook religion to far in the middle ages, not knowing what viruses are, \nthinking that illness and dying is a direct result of sin. Now we know that \nviruses can be deadly, yes, but we can use antibiotics to cure the \nsymptoms. Only 200 years ago, if we had spoken about evolution in the way \nwe do today, the Roman Catholic Church would have us burnt as heretics just \nfor the fact that we believe something that seems to contradict creation as \nit has been described in the Bible. So, should we look down at our \nforefathers? No, we should respect everyone who has toiled to bring us to \nthis point where we can freely debate the issue at hand. To me, that does \nnot make the Bible irrelevant, as long as we understand the context \nthereof. I mean, the authors of the Bible did not even know that the earth \nwas round, did they? So how could we expect an accurate description of \nearth anywhere in the Bible. But I still marvel at creation, no matter how \ndifferently I look at it than the Biblical authors did. So much of it is \nstill relevant, as long as you understand the times and the people who \ncreated the text",

Satan then goes off and ravages the lives of \neveryone Job loves on the basis of what is the equivalent of a drunken bar \nbet with God.  The story would be horrible if the premise weren't so funny. \n And the main lesson seems to be that children, slaves, cattle, goats, and \nwives are all on the same level as mere possessions of the household owner. \n\nBut by far the most disgusting thing in the \"Christian Bible\" is the whole \nconcept of people being \"saved\" by a bloody human sacrifice of Jesus on the \ncross. \n\nChristianity is basically an old pagan human sacrifice religion. It's much \nworse than the Jewish tradition that it is supposedly founded on, and it's \nbad enough.",

The \nfundamentalists and other such orthodoxy tend to try to make themselves a \nhindrance to any scientific concept which contradicts that. Another problem \nis the question: science AND which religion? Deism can be very compatible \nwith science, but religion at large encompasses more than just one thing. \nIt doesn't represent a single entity.\n\nAs for the incompatibility of science and religion, science deals with the \nrealm of the material and religion deals with too much that is not \nmaterial. Can they be compatible on some philosophical levels? Sure. But \nstill not compatible in a manner for creationism to be taught as actual \nscience.\n\nI'm an atheist (for lack of any real evidence to the contrary) but I'm \nstill agnostic as to the causation of the origins of the universe, for the \nsake of intellectual honesty. Because before what is thought to be the \nbeginning of the universe, we just aren't really sure what happened or what \nthe conditions were like. Not that people aren't trying to figure it out, \nbut we don't know yet, and might not find out.\n\n*\"The Bible is probably the biggest blasphemy of them all.\"*\nAre you perhaps an admirer of Thomas Paine?",
