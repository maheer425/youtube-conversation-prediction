First of \nall (i may sound like a PC master race) but as long as you have a half \ndecent computer it will always be better then console. 2nd, skyrim was \ndesigned for consoles, but thrives on PC. With endless customization with \nmods and to configure.\n3rd If GTA V comes out on PC and you see what mods you can get, you will be \namazed. And most of the stuff like having nothing to do on console GTA V \nwill be solved.\nFrom what i can gaver im guessing youve never played PC and dont have a \ngood one. Have you heard of Steam? If you had it on PC you would vomit \nrainbows of joy and excitement.",

I forgot the exact number, \nbut that number is the equivalent to a world somewhere between 30 and 39, \nthe number is also the piece of code for blank space, making it look like \n\"world -1\" but anyway, the glitch is that if you go through the end pipe to \ngo to the flag, you start the level all over again, and if you have \na original copy for the Japanese NES, the level is a land texture with \npurple flying bowsers and platforms everywhere.
