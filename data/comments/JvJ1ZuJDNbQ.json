                "text": "*US Is an Oligarchy Not a Democracy, says Scientific Study*\n*by Eric Zuesse | Monday, April 14, 2014*\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/view/2014/04/14\n\nA study, to appear in the Fall 2014 issue of the academic journal \nPerspectives on Politics, finds that the U.S. is no democracy, but instead \nan oligarchy, meaning profoundly corrupt, so that the answer to the study\u2019s \nopening question, \"Who governs? Who really rules?\" in this country, is: \n\n\"Despite the seemingly strong empirical support in previous studies for \ntheories of majoritarian democracy, our analyses suggest that majorities of \nthe American public actually have little influence over the policies our \ngovernment adopts. Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic \ngovernance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association, \nand a widespread (if still contested) franchise. But, ...\" and then they go \non to say, it's not true, and that, \"America's claims to being a democratic \nsociety are seriously threatened\" by the findings in this, the first-ever \ncomprehensive scientific study of the subject, which shows that there is \ninstead \"the nearly total failure of 'median voter' and other Majoritarian \nElectoral Democracy theories [of America]. When the preferences of economic \nelites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the \npreferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, \nnear-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.\"\n\nTo put it short: The United States is no democracy, but actually an \noligarchy.\n\nThe authors of this historically important study are Martin Gilens and \nBenjamin I. Page, and their article is titled \"Testing Theories of American \nPolitics.\" The authors clarify that the data available are probably \nunder-representing the actual extent of control of the U.S. by the \nsuper-rich:\n\nEconomic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even \nthough our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. \nOur measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans \u2013 though \nuseful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases \u2013 is \nprobably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our \nmeasures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged \ninterest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using \nthis imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy \nmay be still greater.\nNonetheless, this is the first-ever scientific study of the question of \nwhether the U.S. is a democracy. \"Until recently it has not been possible \nto test these contrasting theoretical predictions [that U.S. policymaking \noperates as a democracy, versus as an oligarchy, versus as some mixture of \nthe two] against each other within a single statistical model. This paper \nreports on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes \nmeasures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.\" That\u2019s an enormous \nnumber of policy-issues studied.\n\nWhat the authors are able to find, despite the deficiencies of the data, is \nimportant: the first-ever scientific analysis of whether the U.S. is a \ndemocracy, or is instead an oligarchy, or some combination of the two. The \nclear finding is that the U.S. is an oligarchy, no democratic country, at \nall. American democracy is a sham, no matter how much it's pumped by the \noligarchs who run the country (and who control the nation's \"news\" media). \nThe U.S., in other words, is basically similar to Russia or most other \ndubious \"electoral\" \"democratic\" countries. We weren't formerly, but we \nclearly are now. Today, after this exhaustive analysis of the data, \u201cthe \npreferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, \nnear-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.\u201d That's \nit, in a nutshell.\ufeff",

Oh, yeah inflation covers up trade \nimbalances and makes it easier for government to go into debt; however, it \ndevalues American's savings and real wages. The oligarchy actually thinks \ndevalued wages is good, because it make the US workers more competitive \nwith third world workers' wages. An oligarchy just does not care.\n\nBTW TYTs are economic morons, but I do not expect much from them.\n 4:18 the top 1% are also the ones that can demand higher wages. They are \nalso primarily small business owners. So increasing inflation within the \neconomy and increasing taxes means those people will want to see increases \nin real income. There is also a very simple concept called return on \ninvestment. The higher the investment and inflation, then the higher the \ndemanded real return on investment will be. Yeah, increasing business costs \nwill be seen within the prices and the return on investment.  \n\nThis whole get the money out of politics is a joke. The voters should want \nto bring back freedom and free-markets within the USA. But hey, it is \neasier to curse the 1% and want to tax them to death. \n ",

The difference in definition between an \"oligarchy\" and a \n\"plutocracy\" is in whether the ruling class is comprised of merely a small \ngroup of people or if it is specifically comprised up of wealthy people.  \nIt is a subtle distinction as wealth alone might not determine one's \ninfluence and power, especially if you control for age (younger and \"new\" \nmembers of the ruling class may have yet to make a fortune). \nBut on the other hand there is \"affluenza\"...  and that it is not an \nisolated case.  However, as the wealthy have typically always had influence \nover the criminal justice system (at least until the time of pitchforks and \nguillotines), at what point would such influence become a symptom of a \nplutocracy? \nIn the end, I actually leaned towards \"Oligarchy,\" lol.  :-p\nPerhaps, though, it is a plutocratic oligarchy? \nBut the wealthy are really *extremely* wealthy, such that even though the \namerican median income is above the international top 1% level, the \namerican national 1%ers average so much much money that from their \nperspective, we are all indistinguishable from the poor of the poorest \ncountries.

Complying with the VALUES of communism is an option for \neveryone at all times.  But few choose to behave that way.  That is as a \nresult of the system of oligarchy under which we live. \n\nIf we were all to collectively, freely select the political system of our \nchoice then whatever the outcome of that it would likely work because, by \ndefinition, it would have the support of the majority. \n\nBut we can't do that because so many of us are almost entirely conditioned, \nmentally. \n\nInstead our choices, and our perceptions of those choices, are handed to us \nby the small elites who control our current systems.  Those systems fail \nbecause they are false systems designed to tie us into a mental process \nwhich confuses us into believing that \"our\" system is the \"best one\", when \nin fact any given system is actually one of disempowerment of the \nindividual, and of original thought. \n\nI am not explaining this very succinctly.  But what I am trying to say is \nthat no system, no matter how conceptually benevolent, can deliver equality \nand social justice and opportunity etc, if that system is implemented, and \nour understanding of it controlled, by a small elite of malicious selfish \noligarchs. \n\n:-)",

As far as I know - and please feel free to correct me if \nI am wrong - the income tax all goes to paying off the debt of bills long \nover due. Most of the stuff like roads and what not is local or at the \nstate level, which is not part of the federal income tax. And even if it \nwas, it doesn't matter because it's going towards the debt anyway.\n\nAnd besides, how do you know what I use and don't use? You can't possibly \nknow. And let's not pretend that everyone's usage is equal - it isn't. \nThere is bound to be inequitable use of tax paid services in such a system \nwhere some people are slaving more of their time to pay for these services \nfor others who pay less. I am not against charity, but this forced legal \nplunder of people's property is theft - not charity. One could hardly call \nthis charity.\n\nAnd let's not pretend the federal roads are actually necessary. If that \nproperty were privatized, it's very likely entrepreneurs would have built \nsomething similar. We cannot predict what would have occurred in an actual \nmarket without government intrusions as they currently exist today. For all \nwe know, we'd be using a lot more air travel to go between cities and such, \nand with more wide-spread use, it would have created a greater demand for \nsolving problems in that space. The point is, you can't possibly know what \nwould have happened without the federal roads, and in all likelihood, the \nservices provided by the market would at least be the same and would likely \nbe better to what we have now. Your argument cannot hinge on the idea that \neverything would exist exactly as it does today but without roads if we \ndidn't pay more income tax to fund roads. An entirely different outcome \nwould have happened instead.\n\nAnd if you are arrogant enough to know what would have happened by the \ngovernment not supplying roads or other services, then seriously, you \nshould become an entrepreneur immediately. With that kind of crystal ball \nthat you have, you should be able to make billions of dollars in any market \neasily.\n\nAs for other services, this is a long debate that is going way off topic. \nMost of those services are not even constitutional, and infringe on the \nrights to life and property in the first place.

The interest \npayments you receive on your money while its held inside of a bank is often \nmuch lower than the rate of inflation, so you can never beat it. You will \nalways lose purchasing power, unless you invest that money into something \nthat earns you more purchasing power compared to the rate of inflation.\n\nMost of this debt is caused by things you probably didn't consent to. Wars \nyou didn't want being faught. Programs you didn't agree with. You're paying \nfor a whole wad of crap you didn't consent to, and on top of this, because \nthe government couldn't possibly tax you enough, they have to inflate the \nmoney supply too, which further hurts you.\n\nThe debt, at this point, is enormous, and all of us are somehow expected to \npay off at some point. The unborn clearly have no hope of paying off the \nunpaid stuff from the previous generations, and yet will be enslaved to pay \nfor it, just as we are - but they will have it worse.\n\nThis all covered by the topic of monetizing debt.\n\nAnd because banks can simply ask for inflated currency that they loan to \nyou - money that you are expected to pay interest on even though the bank \ndoes not have to pay interest - also makes you a slave to the bankers. They \nprofit by essentially doing nothing at all - just putting some numbers into \na computer - while you have to work hard to pay off the interest on \nwhatever loan you take. This is what fractional reserve banking is, and \ncentral banks have made this possible to such an extreme extent that \notherwise would not have been made possible.\n\nThis, plus the introduction of the income tax - which became permanent with \nthe introduction of the federal reserve system in 1913, has caused all of \nus to become slaves of each other, and to whoever has power within the \ncountry. When you want some government program that is not included in the \nconstitution, everyone has to slave away a % of their working life to pay \nfor it, whether they agree with it or not - and whether they ultimately use \nit or not.\n\nSince most of the income tax pays off the debt and doesn't actually pay for \nmany other services you may benefit from, you are literally slaving a large \n% of your life away to others for nothing.\n\nIf all of this doesn't convince you that you are actually a slave, then I \nam envious because you can live life in bliss.",

Our democracy has \nbeen hijacked by the rich, the influential, and corporate interests. We are \nnow an Oligarchy. Do you wish to live out your days ruled by a government \nthat considers your views as meaningless? Insignificant? Unimportant? It is \ntime for a populist movement to emerge from both camps, Republican and \nDemocrat alike, and introduce a constitutional amendment on campaign \nfinance reform. Stop allowing the influences that have infiltrated BOTH the \nDemocratic AND the Republican party, to drive a wedge between between us, \nto prevent us from coming together on common ground, campaign finance \nreform. We all see what MUST BE DONE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. The \nlast hope for preserving our Democracy in America is a constitutional \namendment for campaign finance reform that will take the $ out of campaign \nfinance. Dollars are not speech. Corporations are not people. The \ninfluences in both parties that I refer to have ground the wheels of \nWashington to a halt. It now falls to the states to accomplish this. \nPROMOTE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ON THE STATE LEVEL, PROMOTE A \nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BY THE STATES, ON THE STATE LEVEL TO TAKE THE $ \nOUT OF OUR ELECTIONS. OUR DEMOCRACY IS NOT FOR SALE!  Reject those in both \nthe democratic and republican parties that are throwing a wrench into the \nSenate and the Congress to prevent this populist movement from getting \nunder way. Do not allow them to divide and conquer by keeping us fighting \namongst ourselves! THERE IS COMMON GROUND! CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM IS THAT \nCOMMON GROUND!   ",

                "text": "Oligarchy is a very heavy, loaded word. It is seldom thrown around bereft \nof any undertones of conspiracy or 1984-themed empty glass outlooks on the \nworld. Because of this, we have come to associate it as such. We've come to \nsee it as a word that carries the same stigma as words like \"Orwell\" or \n\"Dystopia\" - a synonym for some hypothetical future, the way things might \nbe in a non-existent parody of the way things are. Never does it hit home \nthat this is literally exactly the way things are. No conspiracy theory, no \ntin foil hats. Seriously. The definition of that words applies, now, to the \nway things actually work. We have crossed that line, because we have all \nfictionalized it so much we never imagined it might actually happen.\n\nThis IS the dystopian future. This is what we have been fearing, and what \nwe never let ourselves believe could actually happen.\ufeff",

That is \nnot how capitalism works. under capitalism the pie keeps growing. The rich \ncreate new money that didn't exist. Under your socialist dream there is a \nfinite sized pie. That is your hope huh?\n\nSo you are completely ignorant to capitalism. You don't get it, and I'm \nsure you don't want to get it because the notion of freedom and democracy \nis what you hate since capitalism relies on those things to work.

                    "text": "The United States like many other countries has evolved its government \nthrough its life time to present.\nAt the beginning it was a constitutional republic federation of states. \n With mostly all the power to the states and any democratic election to its \nrepublics decided on by the states. It was economically and politically \nchaotic, so the Constitutional federal Government was created to oversea \nall states, the one Washington was elected by congress to be president (our \nfirst US president under the constitution). \nMost of all the elected bodies to the federal government was voted into \noffice by peers elected from states, only under state level were male white \nproperty owners allowed to vote for their state representatives or run for \noffice.\n\n-Then times changed by 1830's all white males could vote for state \ncandidates regardless of property ownership.\n-Then all males regardless of race could vote. Black suffrage was later \nextended to all states by the 15th Amendment (ratified in 1870)\n-Then the people could vote directly for their federal representatives \n(senate candidates) not just for their state representation who would elect \nthe federal representation. The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to \nthe United States Constitution established direct election of United States \nSenators by popular vote\n-1920 women could vote. The Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX)\nThen women and men could vote for their state representatives.\n- Bringing the vote to people under 21 years of age wasn't fully adopted in \nall states until 1971. The 26th Amendment ratified by in 1971, voting age \nbecame in all states 18 years old or older.\n\nSo its been an evolving process.  At the start basically for elite property \nowners with most votes from within the states elected bodies who then \nelected federal candidates to federal positions. Kind of like today \nregarding the electoral college. They did this for a few reasons, the \nelites didn't trust the uneducated mob for higher authority of government, \nmany were actually couldn't even read in the 18th and 19th century.  And of \ncourse, to maintain their businesses (their wealth) and political authority \njust like any elites do in any social structure. Human nature.\n\n  Because what was written at the beginning was a power too and for a few \nwealthy white men, a plutocrat. And has evolved into more of a democratic \nrepublic as far as the federal government. As for states, each state acts \ndifferent. Some states like mine in Idaho, require popular vote to approve \ntheir state legislature to raise any state taxes or to give any authority \nfor taxes or establishing any governmental state authority. Essentially, \nIdaho, as other states, many state laws passed by legislature must be \nratified by popular vote by the people.  So its a complex subject depending \nwhether you're talking about state or federal government, and which state. \nThen what time period.\nAll happened at various times by states and eventually adopted by all \nstates usually by constitutional amendments. All from protests, riots, \nrebellions to outright civil war. The founding fathers only stroke of \ngenius was to keep the constitution vague and open for updates. And it has \nbeen updated quite a bit.\n And needs lots more updates. \nBelow is source of timeline regarding democratic vote of the people.\nhttp://www.nationalpopularvote.com/resources/Constiutionality-V6-2010-3-7.pdf",
