TYT was quite a bit pro-Chavez \nof-course, they are massively pro-collectivist.\n\nWarren is a collectivist, and she is not there to fix anything.

The \nbanks major and the government in USA at this point are ran by the same \npeople, but it's NOT \"lack of regulation\" that is causing the problem. It \nis TOO MUCH REGULATION, which PREVENTS COMPETITION to those very banks and \nto those very people.\n\nUSA has the most financial and banking regulations of the entire world, USA \nIMPOSES ITS FINANCIAL REGULATIONS ON OTHER COUNTRIES.  USA did not reduce \npower of the gov't in the last 20 years, it grew the power and it destroyed \nthe freedom and thus the economy and Warren is nothing but another, more \nadvanced COLLECTIVIST, be it socialist or fascist, it doesn't matter, she \nis anti-individual freedom, she is going to be USA's Hugo or Hitler or Mao \nor Stalin or Castro, doesn't matter, but it won't be any kind of a fix, it \nwill be just more destruction of the individual.\ufeff",

The people that became affluent after WWII in USA were factory \nworkers, pretty much almost anybody with a job could afford a mortgage free \nhouse, pension without SS (people used to save money when it was real), \nhealth care without Medicare or Medicaid, they just paid out of pocket.  \nPeople could afford education out of pocket by taking summer jobs.  USA \nused to be affluent, but not because there was more of a middle class, USA \nused to be affluent because USA USED TO MANUFACTURE GOODS THAT EVERYBODY \nWANTED.\n\nThat ship has sailed, USA does not manufacture almost anything, try and \nfind something actually manufactured in USA, especially something that is \nexported besides weapons, and raw energy carriers. USA even imports 90% of \nseafood it consumes. USA runs a 500BILLION USD / year trade deficit (for 2 \ndecades now).  USA is now the biggest debtor in history of the world to the \nmost people in history of the world and it all became possible because USA \ndefaulted on the gold dollar and is running the largest ponzi scam in the \nhistory of the world: USD and bonds.\n\nAs to your NONSENSE about regulations, Glass Steagall was one of 100,000 \nand more financial regulations on the books, and it was only part of FDIC, \nit was there to counterbalance the DAMAGE that FDIC was causing by acting \nas a huge moral hazard to DEPOSITORS (who think they have deposits, they \nare just lenders to banks).  The repeal of 1 (one) financial regulation did \nnot cause this problem, which was IN THE MAKING FOR FIFTY YEARS.\n\nThe problem with the shortsighted collectivists, like you and the TYT and \nMSM and so many politicians is that they have no perspective at all, they \nhave no historical knowledge and they don't understand how the economy \nfunctions at all. They rely on Keynesian mumbo jumbo and BELIEVE that they \ncan actually manipulate the economy without causing MASSIVE imbalances that \neventually destroy it, even if it takes 50 years to ACCUMULATE the problems \nby destroying its productivity.\n\nBy the time of Clinton administration, when Glass-Steagal was repealed, USA \nwas already in this mess, it already lost most of its manufacturing, it \nalready ran the biggest ponzi scams in the world with the dollar and the \nbonds, it was already on the path to self destruction for 40 years.  The \nonly reason they even removed Glass-Steagal was because there was no \nmanufacturing left in USA and so there was no yield in anything, while the \nFed (Greenspan) was injecting massive amounts of money into the system \n(inflation) , so banks, who were searching for yield pushed to let them \ngamble more.  But the economy was already dead, it just didn't get the \nmessage.\n\nThere is a reason that ZOMBIE MOVIES are so popular nowadays. People like \nmovies that reflect their own lives and that's what is happening in real \nlife that is being reflected in the movies: the economy of the people that \nlike those movies is a zombie economy.  Even the wars that are fought on \ntheir behalf are fought with zombies (drones).\n\nWelcome to the zombie world, ever wonder what comes after?",

That's what allowed USA to start running massive \ndeficits, after USA defaulted on the gold dollar in 1971, but of-course USA \nwas on an unsustainable path since the fifties, 1971 simply accelerated the \ninevitable decline, which is what USA is experiencing now. The decline is \nlinked to massive inflation to the USA dollar, massive amounts of unpayable \ndebt, massive unsustainable trade deficits.

She is a first term \nsenator with zero experience in elected office at any level of government \nprior to her 2012 campaign. Yes, Obama was a first term senator as well, \nbut he spent almost eight years in the Illinois State Senate before being \nelected to federal office so it's not a fair comparison. If we put her up \nas nominee in 2016, assuming Clinton doesn't run and proceed to utterly \nsmash her in the primaries, Warren will lose and lose badly as the \nRepublicans paint her as an inexperienced New England radical leftist who \nwill drive the country into the ground. In 2020 or 2024 (depending on if we \nwin in 2016) she will have spent far more time in elected office, built up \na much greater national reputation, and be a far more potent threat to the \nRepublicans and corporatist Democrats than she would be now. At this point \nin time, I think she's doing way more good as a first term senator who is \nquickly gaining a reputation as a defender of the lower and middle classes \nthan she'd be doing as either a sacrificial lamb leftist anti-Clinton \noption or a Presidential nominee. If we need a more progressive \nanti-Clinton option in the primary, let someone like Martin O'Malley (who \nwill have more than 15 years experience in elected office by the time the \nprimaries roll around) take up that role. Then if he somehow managed to \npull off a victory against the Clinton juggernaut, we'd actually have a \ncandidate that's capable of winning on the national level in 2016, and if \nhe lost the primary, we wouldn't be damaging the reputation of a senator \nthat I could easily see running an extremely credible campaign for the \nPresidency given another couple cycles. I get why people are excited about \nthe possibility of Warren running, but I just don't see this being her year \nwhen you look at things realistically.\ufeff",

Secondly, did the Heritage \nfoundation at one point have an alternate to the Clinton idea of universal \nhealthcare, yes, and it was an individual mandate. But was it anything like \nthe individual mandate of today that is in Obamacare, absolutely not. \nFirstly, the point of the mandate was to protect others, not themselves. If \nsomeone gets in a bad wreck, and didn't have insurance, than the state \nwould pay for that. The Mandate would get rid of that, because everyone \nwould have health insurance. Secondly, they wanted people to get healthcare \nby the \"carrot\" and not the \"stick\". They would provide rewards for those \nwho got them. Not a punishment. Finally, the mandate said that if you \ndidn't buy health insurance, than you would lose some tax breaks. It was \nnot a legal requirement to buy health insurance. \nSo about the only connection you can draw between the two is that more \npeople would be on insurance. It is how it happens. So in otherwords, there \nis no way that you can say Obamacare came out of a Heritage Foundation idea.",

The real question is what is the best way to assure us the \nHouse and Senate in 2016. I love Elizabeth Warren, I worked on her campaign \nhere in Massachusetts, but Hillary Clinton brings a lot more to the table \nin regards to down ballot voting. If people on the left don't want to \nrealize that, they just don't know politics. Can Hillary Clinton be beaten \non the left? It's possible, though I'd argue that she is coming from a much \nstronger position in 2015 than she was in, in 2007. 4 years as secretary of \nstate in addition to her previous experience? It's going to be much easier \nfor Clinton to beat Republicans in purple areas of the country than it \nwould be for Warren. And by that token she is going to help out Democrats \nin purple areas a lot more than Warren would. Much of Obama's support team \nis already on board to work for Hillary. Obama's campaign manager in 2012 \nhas joined Hillary's super pac. \n\nYou all Hillary right wing, but what she is a winner and a shrewd \npolitician, who has an extremely strong network. Obama beat her because he \nran a great campaign, a campaign that she will for all rights be \ninheriting. You combine both spectrum and no, it's not likely she will be \nbeaten from either the left or right. \n\nBut the main point is, please stop focusing on who runs for President. \nFocus on who is running for congress, because that is what is going to \nchange this country, not whoever is President. \ufeff",

Share with us in your wealth of knowledge what \nSenator Warren has told the financial institutions that they must do? \n\nBy the end of \"too big to fail,\" the government chose to bail out only the \nbig banks. Not the little ones that suffered the must and therefore went \nbankrupt. The loss of little banks and even some of the bigger financial \ninstitutions like Lehmann Brothers meant that the Big Four remaining \n(Goldmann, Citigroup, and such) could just gobble up the left overs and \nmake themselves bigger. Our politicians did not stop them.  You ask me why? \nWell let tell you Bill.  It's because big financial institutions invest \nheavily into campaign funds and they want some favors just every once in a \nwhile. \n\nNow what does Senator Warren have to do with this? Well Senator Warren at \nthe time wasn't even Senator Warren.  She was not even in politics.  She \nwas professor of law, a mother, a grandmother, and writer, who had \npredicted the financial collapse a decade prior to 2008.  But when the \nworld collapsed, the government reached out to her to help oversee the \ncongressional TARP oversight. What powers did this give her? The TARP \noversight gave money and demanded a certain repayment plans. But then TARP \ndidn't effect small banks?! That's right Bill. TARP didn't effect small \nbanks because they didn't give them money in the first place to have rules \non them.  \n\nBut did Senator Warren do anything else? Well yes Bill. She championed the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau which look for fraud and repayment to \nthe consumers.  What has the CFPB done? Well in its 3 years, it has fined \n$400 million dollars in fraud and returned it to the consumers.  People \nlike you and I bill can send an email to CFPB and say \"well I think my \ncredit card company is screwing me over again.\" The CFPB sees enough people \nall pointing to the same company and they investigate. Isn't that exciting? \nWell it sure is because now I don't need to fight the big bank by myself \nanymore.  \nI like it when we talk Bill. I feel like we both learn a lot. Well maybe \nmostly you, but I still like our talks.   ",
