I really \nloved the footage you have of the great city. I was hoping to include it in \nour Top 5 video series. It would be number one of the Top 5 most visited \ncity's in the world. So I'm writing you in hopes that I can get permission! \nWhen you get a moment I'd love to hear from you. Until then take care!\n\nCheers,\nCameron Langille\nWeather Network\nProduction Intern\ufeff",
