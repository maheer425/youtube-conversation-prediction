Big heads, big black eyes, skinny bodies, \"take me to your \nleader\". they're mysterious, kind of scary, etc, etc.\n\nReptoids are giant lizard-like aliens, and the ones who are said to be the \nmost hostile towards humanity. They like politics and can shapeshift, so \nthey tend to make themselves appear human, work their way up the ranks of \nsociety, and fuck with us all with the political power they gain, so some \npeople believe. my guess is, that's the reference for the lizard part at \nthe end, since it's talking about the illuminati - another great force in \ncontrol of the human race or whatever the hell the illuminati does.\n\ni hope this answered your question.",
