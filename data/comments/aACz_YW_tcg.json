In my room, I had a \nshelf where I kept all of my toys, and that night I looked at it and saw \nPeter Pan's shadow on my wall, grabbing at my toys. I was so petrified that \nI just sat and stared. Then the shadow noticed me and started moving along \nthe wall towards me. I screamed and tried to move but I couldn't. Then my \nmother came in and turned on the light, and everything was normal. My \nmother said that I was probably dreaming, but I swear I was awake.\ufeff",

                "text": "Gosh I had a lot of nightmares and... ghostly encounters when I was a \nlittle kid... (*warning, a book will appear on your screen if you 'Read \nmore'*)\n\nI had a reoccurring dream about watching TV at night with my parents. We \nwere all on the couch, me in the middle. There was a long hallway right \nbehind the couch; all the lights were off so it was really dark. I got this \ncreepy feeling that something was sneaking up behind us down the hallway, \nso I looked back and I saw the shadow of this dwarve-looking figure like 3 \nfeet tall, limping down the hallway towards me. I screamed, and told my \nparents there was a monster coming to kill us. I looked at them. Both of \nthem looked at me at the same time, and their eyes were completely gouged \nout, just large black holes. They said, \"There is no such thing as \nmonsters, my dear.\"\n\nWhen I was a baby my father told me that he saw someone enter my bedroom in \nthe corner of his eye sometimes. He said it was like a \"white shadow.\" \nRecently he got an old red office chair that some people were going to \nthrow away. It was similar to the one my grandfather sat in when he told \nstories to my dad; my grandfather died a month before I was born in 1998, \nand my parents said that he really wanted to see me before he died. So \nyeah... we had this red chair just sitting in our living room. A few weeks \nlater, I felt like I was being watched. On some days my father said that he \nnow had seen a \"black shadow\" enter my room at night, and he felt his hair \nstand on end. One day during a weeknight my dad was on the computer in the \nliving room and I was watching TV in the same room with him. I heard him \ncall me to the computer, so I came over and said, \"Whatcha want?\" My father \nlooked at me all confused, and then he said, \"I didn't say anything.\" \nFunny, we both got goosebumps and for a split second we saw the shadow of \nan old man sitting in the chair before it vanished.\n\nOne morning I was waiting for the bus in 6th grade. Ya know... just a \nnormal, boring morning. I got a chill which was weird because it really \nwasn't that cold out. So I just looked back, and this'll sound really weird \nbut, I saw a purple shade in the form of my grandmother. (at the time it \nwas my favorite color) She was walking back and forth on my porch like she \nwas worried. (She always wore a Phillipino floral dress around her house \nwhen I visited her with my mom. She was wearing that same dress, and still \nwore it before she died). She looked at me, waved, and then she poofed. \nBefore this all happened, she passed away a few months ago from pancreatic \ncancer. At the time that I saw her, we had her ashes in an urn in my house \nfor a time before we gave it to one of our other family members. It was \nlike a final farewell because she let herself go to rest when my parents \nand I weren't around to say goodbye...\nThis is where I stop because I already probably buried more than half the \ncomments here with mine. O.o *I tolds ya*\ufeff",

I mean that they're influenced by it whether they mean to or \nnot. What I meant in my example about humans on an aliens planet is like if \nthere were no birds there, or if all the animals had no teeth but rather \nsay, suction cup-like parts to tear or kill their food. Rather than \ndeveloping spears humans would likely develop something suction cup like as \nwell, even if a spear would work just the same. The art of that \ncivilization when depicting mythological beasts from other dimensions would \nlikely not have teeth protruding but those suction cups doing whatever they \ndo. With no birds or any flying creatures, they would likely need to study \nphysics for much longer before they realized the concept of flying. That's \nwhat I mean when I say they derive it from nature. They do whether they \nwant to or not.\n\nIn the same light, children born in this environment would eventually have \ntheir brains adapted to thinking about this type of stuff. People hang \nthemselves because they know it will probably work, due to how nature is. \nVines aren't the only think that can kill you. If hanging had no effect \nwhatsoever, then nobody would think of hanging as disturbing at all. If \ntouching metal would cause instant death, and hanging nothing, then people \nwould think of that as an iconic suicide.\n\nI never said children automatically think grim thoughts. They can, and when \nthey do it's very likely to be in an environment that resembled one where \nthey were likely to be killed in our hunter gatherer days.",

There used to be a pond near her house that \nwe always walked to, to watch the water flow. (the pond is still there but \nit has no water in it) So everytime I slept over her house I would have the \nexact same dream: Me my dad, and my aunt were walking to the pond in the \nmiddle of the night, and it was always a warm summer evening (no matter \nwhat season it was outside of the dream) and once we got there My aunt \nwould say 'lets go for a swim' we all got into the pond.. but we had saw a \nhand sticking straight up through the water and it grabbed my aunt then my \ndad and then me. But after I went under the water I would wake up. I \nstopped having the dream when I was about 7. But a year later my dad \npassed.  Like omfg wtf.\ufeff",

Another dream I used to always have was that there was a scuba diver \nin my house, and I always ran downstairs behind the same exact couch I \nalways hide behind,(I had this dream multiple times) and he always ends up \nfinding me and grabbing me. And don't you guys always have the feeling when \nsomeone grabs you, it kind of stings or tickles for some reason? I don't \nknow if it's just me. And this happened to me one time I think when I was \nin 3rd grade. I was VERY tired and I was still in my bed. (My door was \nopen) And then I blinked, and saw this flash of a wolf'a head outside my \nbedroom door. And I was like, \"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!\" in my head. And \nI decided to go to sleep, even though I didn't even know if I was awake \nanymore. And there was this other time where I was in a DEEP sleep. I was \nso tired. And there was a storm outside. So when I heard thunder, it woke \nme up and I started to hear this ringing sound. Like when you get him buy a \nflash bang on a game, or when someone pops both of your ears. And it lasted \nfor a bit, and I didnt know if I was awake for asleep. And it was also dark \noutside. I didn't know what time it was. So I just went back to sleep. And \nthat's that... :3\ufeff",

After you get out of bed you realize that the noises in \nyour dreams were actually noises happening around your house.\n\nHere's an example. You have a dream about being in a car crash. It ends \nwith a crash and you wake up exactly as the crashing noise happens. Then it \nturns out your Mom dropped a plate or something.\n\nThe weird part about this is that, while asleep, you have no idea when on \nIF the noise is going to happen yet it syncs perfectly in your dream. It's \nlike you know that it's going to happen before it does.\n\nI imagine that after waking up your brain connects the noises to the \nmemories from the dream and makes them fit. Still, does anyone else get \nthis?\ufeff",

By the time I was 6 they both died of cancer.\n\nI had a very realistic nightmare that I was sleeping in bed with my mum, \nand ghosts just flew around the room. Everything looked as it looks at \nnight, I tried to wake my mum but she didn't wake up.\n\nBut the absolute worst one of all was that I stood in a room downstairs, a \nroom which joined the hallway, living room, and the stairs. Everything was \ndark, except there was someone somewhere in the front in the hallway. A \nlight was turned on over there then, but the room I was in was dark. There \nstood a dark figure, which looked the size of maybe an 11 year old boy (I \nwas 3 - 6 then). He looked very demonic though. When he looked at me for a \ncouple of seconds, everything turned into a gameshow like room, where I was \nlooking from above at a TV presenter on the left, my dad in the middle and \nmyself on the right. They talked and laughed and suddenly the ground opened \nbeneath me and I watched myself fall.\nThis dream kept recurring for a couple of years, after a couple times I \nknew what's coming next and I wasn't surprised, I knew I was dreaming but \ncouldn't wake up. Somehow I couldn't make anything stop. Until one day I \njust looked back at that demon and he looked a bit annoyed, cause he knew I \nwasn't frightened anymore. I woke up then. No gameshow.\nBut then when I was 10 - 12 that dream recurred again. The demon looked at \nme like he did when I was 3, but I just laughed in his face and was like \n\"what you gonna do\". He turned his face and walked away and I walked in the \ndirection of the living room. Woke up. No gameshow either of course.\nHe didn't come back since.\ufeff",

I looked up, only to see that another vehicle \nwas in front of me, stopped at a stop sign. I tried to stop, but I couldn't \ndo it in time. I gently bumped the rear end of his car. The driver got out \nof his car, furious, and opened my door. He gently punched me in the face \ntwice, and then stormed off. At first, I was just glad that we didn't \nexchange insurance information, but then I realized that the driver who I \nhad gotten into an accident with was Sylvester Stallone. Then I awakened.\n\nEdit: 100% true story (dream). The only detail I left out was that the \ndrivers' side doors and steering wheels were on the right side (like in \nEngland) for some reason.\ufeff",

I remember \nin the Book of Mormon, which was 600 BC, Nephi was told by an angel about \nthe disciple who would write of the Book of Revelation, and called his name \nJohn (see 1st Nephi 14:27).  The fact that John was mentioned 600 years \nbefore his birth, is proof that God's fore-knowing is real, even if we \ndon't understand it.  I still believe it is possible for God to cause \nsomeone to be born a second time (as seems to be the case in Genesis 5), I \njust don't know if it is true with any certainty or any circumstance.  We \nhave a chance right now to attain salvation with eternal glory by faith.\n\n\"Therefore I endure all things for the elect\u2019s sakes, that they may also \nobtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.\" - 2 \nTimothy 2:10",

                "text": "When I was about four, I had a nightmare about this rocking horse in my \nroom named Blaze. I was always terrified of Blaze as a kid (now I put hats \non him and such, because he is now much smaller than me and I could kick \nhis plastic ass). One night, I had a dream that was to this day the most \nvivid dream that I've ever had. No breaks- I had thought that I had just \nwoken up in the middle of the night, which was normal for me. I saw Blaze \njust ever so slightly illuminated by the light of the moon, as if he was a \nshadow (shadows seem to be common themes for nightmares). I was petrified. \nSomehow, I knew that I shouldn't move. I kept my breath steady, and tried \nto go back to sleep. I couldn't close my eyes for the longest while. When I \nfinally did, I stayed still as stone. After a few minutes, I twitched, ever \nso slightly. My eyes flung open, just in time to see Blaze come to life, \nand silently springing at me, mouth open, and then darkness. \n\nIt's funny. because when I woke up, I just kind of thought, \"I KNEW that \nbastard was up to something,\" and I had to risk getting eaten again to call \nmy parents. But I dunno, now the dream is kind of funny. Silly four year \nold me, horses don't fucking eat people. The dream felt so real... I felt \nthe sheets and I felt my breathing... creepy as hell. ;-;\ufeff",

Then i started \nhearing a voice saying, \"It's ok, It's ok Jason, Dont be scared.\" And it \nstarted off as a whisper and it got progressively louder as time went by. \nThen I turned around to see my Mom and Dad standing there. My mother crying \non my fathers shoulder and I said, \"Mom? Whats wrong\" and they slowly \nstarted getting smaller and smaller as if they were getting further away \nfrom me. As i screamed over and over, \"Dont leave me mom!\" My voice would \nstart to get quieter and quieter even as i screamed with all my might it \nwas a faint whisper. I havent had the dream for a decade now but i still \nremember it very vividly.\ufeff",

The house was definitely haunted \nand you can throw all your mythbuster bullshit at me you want but things \nhappened in that house that are scientifically impossible. Every person who \nstayed a night at our house would claim they felt like they were being \nwatched while they tried to sleep or that there was someone in the \ndarkness, and they always had nightmares. When my mother was praying once \nwith my auntie, the light bulb in the room literally exploded into a powder \nso fine that you could hold it in your hands. Game disks in our computer \nwould also explode into small shards with a huge bang and happened quite \nfrequently and that was proven to be impossible on mythbusters. All the \ndishes in the house were somehow taken out from the cupboards and layed on \nthe floor when my mother went to the bathroom.

I \nwent to the bathroom and heard strange sound at my brother's room (brother \nwas having a overnight btw). I don't want to look at his room cuz I was \nscared. After playing, I shutted down my computer and went to bed. Before I \nwent to bed. I saw this kid eyes so red in my window staring at me.\nHe doesn't have mouth and nose, only eyes. And this kid was black, no not \nblack like a \"n\" word. But black, Just black.\nI blinked and the kid disappeared. And then I never slept that night and \ncontinue playing until the sun comes up.

                "text": "One day back in the 90's, my mum (16) was babysitting my uncle (5) he was \njust messing around with some toys but as mum turned around, in the doorway \nthere was a man, just a regular man standing in the doorway to the living \nroom they were both in. my mum backed up to the far opposite corner of the \nroom away from the man (obviously) but he disappeared as she turned around. \nNo sound was heard when he left. My mum checked all the doors, windows any \nentries into the house were all shut tight. As my mum entered the room my \nuncle was in he said \" so you saw the man too\" As my grandmother came home \n(mum of my mum) she was told of what happened and about the man,she was \nterrified. She washed my uncles hair everyday, as she did this he talked to \n\"the man\" who he said was standing behind my grandmother when she cleaned \nhis hair (obviously there was nothing there) she just assumed it was an \nimaginary friend of my uncle. I was not born during those times but anyone \nwho does not believe in ghosts just because there is no proof of them in a \nvideo does not mean they do not exist. I have never seen a ghost before but \nI believe my mums word over any other. its 2014 and my uncle (22) was in \nhis home and he heard a familiar voice call his name. \ufeff",

                "text": "I remember I was staying at my sisters house for a couple weeks and they \nhad a spare room for me with a computer set up! any way I was playing \nminecraft at about 12:30 am when my niece (whose bedroom was next to mine) \nOpened the door to my room stared at me and said \"He doesn't like us being \nhere... This is his home... not ours...\" then straight after she walked \nback to bed. I followed her back to her room but it seemed like she was \nfast asleep (I thought she was faking) so I said to her \"you shouldn't be \nup this late\" but she didnt respond so I shook her and she woke up all \ngroggy and asked me why I woke her up! I told her what she just did and she \njust stared at me and told me that it wasn't her... I left the room annoyed \nand a little creeped out. The next morning I told my brother in law what \nhappened and he turned pale he told me that she's been doing and saying \nthat ever since they moved in... She still to this day does it and its \nobvious to me now that when she says she doesn't remember she's telling the \ntruth (she is a horrible liar and she laughs when she is lying) I must say \nit creeps me the hell out... \ufeff",

So \nhe grew up with this one lady he called \"mama con\" as his mother figure. \nOne night my dad went out to meet with some friends. My mom was at home \nwith my oldest brother who was just a baby. They lived in a big house, that \nhad a kinda spiral stair case to the master bedroom. My mom was going to \nbed and the bedroom door locks on its own. She was about to go to bed when \nshe heard foots steps coming up the stair case. She assumed it was my \nfather. The door knob started to twist but the door was locked. She got \nscared and grabbed my older brother and hid under the blankets with a \nknife. The lights were out. The door finally opens and a dark figure comes \nin and sits down on the rocking chair my mom uses to rock my brother to \nsleep. The figure apparently starts to rock back and forth. Putting out its \nhand and gesturing to my mom to come to it. My.mom petrified with fear \nstarts to pray and cry. The figure stands up and begins to walk towards the \nbed. My.mom closed her eyes for the next 3 hours. Until my dad comes home. \nMy mom trying hard to tell my dad what had happened. But my dad was just \nstanding there also crying. Mama con had just died that night in her home. \nI asked my mom about the story and she always hugs me and says \"it's true \nbut I will never do that to you \"\ufeff",

                "text": "Well, I guess I'll give my story then: Not too long ago I got a new mobile \nphone that was used and when I opened it up, I did notice that there was \nstill some messages, contacts and what-not left on the phone. Personally I \ndid find it weird as I just thought it was normal for people to delete all \nof their contacts and what-not after using it and selling (It was a fairly \nnew phone too) so it caught me by surprise that the contacts were still \nhere.\n\nThe first day or so was perfectly fine, but then I suddenly got a phone \ncall from a number I don't recognise and as soon as I answered it, I said \n'Hello?' and I was waiting for the other person to talk back and it sounded \nlike a man was lightly breathing in the phone but then the douche bag \ndecided to hang up on me. I just thought to myself 'Well, fuck you too \nthen.' and I just shrugged it off as a prank call. But the next day, the \nsame call came in again and I answered it, the same thing happened - light \nbreathing and then hung up.\n\nThis continued one again the next day and I answered with a really impolite \n'What?' and the same shit happened again. It pissed me off so I just \nblocked the number on my phone and decided to ignore the call entirely. For \nthe next few days, the number would keep trying to call (By telling me I \nmissed the calls but my ringtone never want off) and I was thinking to \nmyself 'Hah, serves you right for being an asshole.' But then not long \nafter I blocked the number, the exact same number somehow managed to get \nthe number to my second phone (I have two :I) which actually creeped me out \nquite a bit and I thought to myself 'How in the world did you get this \nnumber?' and I just blocked it again on my second phone. For the next few \ndays, I kept on getting missed call notifications on my phones from the \nexact same number and at least then it felt like I had that little bit of \npeace.\n\nThe calls stopped for a while, about roughly a week or two but then for \nsome unknown reason, the call came in - my ringtone went off and the phone \nvibrated despite the fact that the same number was blocked so I decided to \npick up the phone and given them a bit of badmouthing, something amongst \nthe lines of 'Look, I'm getting really tired of your shit, what the hell do \nyou want?' But I noticed that just before it hung up once again that there \nwere voices speaking in the background of a man and a woman in a language \nthat I seriously couldn't discern, it didn't feel like gibberish because it \ncertainly felt like a a conversation between the two voices but I couldn't \nmake out what language it was, along with heavier breathing than before \nwhich really got under my skin. This genuinely creeped me the fuck out and \nI made the effort to block the number however way I can, as well as \nblocking any calls that aren't in my contacts list.\n\nThere were no calls from that number until about another 2 or 3 weeks later \nand this is where it got really, really creepy. Once again, my phone \nsomehow ignored the blocking as if the number was already in my contacts \nlist which it wasn't and I just got really pissed off that I just answered \nthe phone and I shouted down the phone with something like 'What the fuck \ndo you want you fucking asshole!? Don't you have anything better to do with \nyour fucking time!?' but as soon as I said what needed to be said, this \ncall felt really, really off as I noticed the sounds were completely \ndifferent this time which was a really deep base-like grumbling moan that \nwas quiet but noticeable along with the sounds of what seemed to be like a \nheart beat and very ominous squishing noises, sort of like when tearing \nmeat from the bones of a chicken but very, very slowly, it didn't sound too \nhealthy. But very soon after that grumbling moan began to change pitch and \ntone almost as if it was someone or something trying to speak through the \nphone. The difference here is that it was in English but it was hard to \nmake out everything it was actually saying, but what I did pick up on the \ncall was 'When the red star ignites the world, we will be one with the dust \nin the darkest skies. They have decided.' and I immediately just hung up \nand I blocked the number whichever way I can and to my own surprise, that \nnumber has never tried to call me ever again but I know I'm going to \nremember that phone call for a while.\n\nI did a bit of research on the number and it sounded like a lot of people \nwere having 'prank call' experiences with this number ranging from \nbreathing to static to gibberish voices, as well as actual people asking \nsome very ominous questions such as full bank details, asking young girls \nif they want to go for a model shoot and calls from 'lonely' people, the \nstories I've heard from this phone number is quite creepy but nobody else \nseemed to have experienced the exact same thing as me, albeit some of the \nstories I have heard from others were also really creepy but it didn't \nmatch my story which I found very odd and strange. The number is real and \nit exists today so if you really want to know what the number is, it's \nthis: +441332387210 - apparently it belongs to a company called 'Dream \nMoney' and they have been harassing people for what seems to be something \nlike 8 years now and as the years went on and on, the calls became much, \nmuch creepier - so reading that up, I found it evident with the call I had. \nI do believe it might be simply prank calling but I do get this really odd \nfeeling after having to hear what I did. I don't know, I would love to know \nif anyone else has ever had any strange calls from this number or any other \ntheories about the call?\ufeff",

There was a red \nlight shining through the window and I could hear people yelling like there \nwas a fight outside, the thing was in the other room still but i was so \nscared it would come out and find me. then you go to sleep again and reset \nin your body and the shadowy beast is right over you, you can't scream or \nmove, you just hope you can thrash around enough to wake the person next to \nyou. The freakiest thing was that the next morning I walked out into the \nkitchen and I could see the red light, it was the dvd player, tv and stereo \npower standby buttons. I still wonder if I was actually crawling across the \nfloor as I have been known to sleepwalk. I've had similar experiences about \nfive or six times.",

When I was 17 in the year 2001 I was attending \nmy Junior year of high school me and my roommate Yasmany had a very odd \nincident. That day I had gotten a new phone that my uncle here at the USA \nsent me. As anyone one would do I started tampering with the phone, \nexploring it and such. Thats when I took a picture of my dorm room wall and \nsaw what appeared to be a deceased person face. I freaked out and dropped \nmy phone. My friend picks it up, screams, and drops it too. We decided to \ntake the phone to the police but when I tried to show him the picture, it \nwas just a plain white wall. The police obviously thought I was joking and \ntold me to please leave. I always tell people this because I want an \nexplanation as to what the fuck happened that day.\ufeff",

I dreamed I was in the \napartment lobby (I lived in an apartment as a child...still do) and i was a \ntiny car and i was vrooming around the place.\nAnd then i had a dream where my dad and i were ghostbusters and we went in \nthe same apartment to find no ghosts. The scary part was-I was tripping af. \nI never even had any drugs before xD",

Two days later, we \nget a call from my aunt by law saying her father had his head run over by a \nlawn mower that day. Once, my friend and I found a set of stairs in the \nbasement in a small closet. We couldn't see past a couple steps so we went \nto get a flashlight, but when we came back the stairs were no longer there. \nWe had a grandfather clock that only chimed at four am every night and no \nother time except the exact time of death of my grandmother. There's other \nstuff, but I'm not trying to write a book in the comment section. \ufeff",

I started \nfeeling STRONG grabs and clearly hand feels around my legs, tough strong \ngrabs that even though I didn't want to admit what I felt I knew deep down \nthat was a human hand, it kept happening and the grabs got stronger and \nstronger and then she started tugging on me and pulling blankets off it was \nseriously hell I mean I was TERRIFIED, I told my dad \"I don't care what you \ndo with her just fucking get rid of the ashes\" he FINALLY dumped the ashes \nafter my mum told him to get them the hell out of the house, not one single \nthing ever since then..... she knew exactly what she was doing, she wanted \nme to tell him to dump the ashes obviously because they probably would have \nbeen sitting in that computer room for another two months. I'm a bit of a \nskeptic when it comes to these things but I know what I felt and it was \nabsolutely undeniable to me.\ufeff",

The \nfirst part of it has to do with this temple/fortress-like structure. Out in \nthe middle of the desert, there's this pyramid, but it's somewhat different \nfrom the usual Egyptian pyramid representation. Imagine a normal pyramid, \nbut with castle-like walls around it, nearly blocking the view of the \npyramid itself. The spires are square-shaped, and there are no conical \nroofs. There is no entrance to within the walls either. How I got inside in \nthe first place is beyond me. Inside the spires, was a singular cylindrical \nroom with a door going to within each wall, and to the next spire. The \nrooms and halls were completely empty too. After cycling through the walls \nand spires, I eventually came into this large rectangular room. In the \ncenter, a purplish orb with a black core. I touched it, it came close to my \nface, it became all I saw, and the dream ended.\n\nLater on, I kept having dreams end with me coming near a similar orb, but \nwith something different about it each time. One time, it had these objects \naround it that made it look like an eye; another time having a sort of \nflame come off of it, but it went out in all directions; the most recent \niteration having thin, whip-like tendrils thrashing about.\n\nAlso, they tended to be on a pedestal, presented at the top of some sort of \nstairwell.\n\nI don't know if it means anything, and I'm sure this sounds like bullshit, \nbut remember; 'twas but a series of dreams.\ufeff",

And when i checked \nit better and i saw behind me in the chair i saw a woman with long black \nhair, Light brown clothes, 1 cloath i dont know what it is called in \nenglish, she had black eyes. And she was staring straight at my camera and \ninto my eyes! I got so afraid that i clicked X in the left corner so the \nimage deleted. It MUST BE THE biggest mistake of my life to delete it in \npanic, because now i dont have any proof of this. I tried taking more \npictures but all i saw was the empty chair so i went in to my dads bedroom \nand woke him up but ofcorse he dosent belive me... People just say ghosts \narent real, u just imageined this. But i know what i saw and from that day \ni have belived 100% in Spirits/Ghosts. Do you know why this could have \nhappened or have you experienced a similar thing to this?\ufeff",

When I turned around my \nsister was just getting out of the shower, then she asked why we all looked \nso shocked. Then everyone was like O.o \n\n(Us and other people saw the thing for years randomly and not really that \nbothersome) Friends saw it, Family members at random times. Always the same \nfigure though to us and others, (we told no one of this who came over our \nhouse nor mentioned it) To the point where I said \"No no no, no creepy \ndemon is coming near me and just closing the door to the room it was in. \nBut it eventually just stopped.",

However, I am certain that I have had visits from my deceased \nrelatives, especially my grandmother, more than once.\n\nOnce evening, I had made myself some tea and a couple sandwiches. As I \nwalked towards the living room, a shut door suddenly opened. My fianc\u00e9e was \nin the living room and nobody else was there. I suddenly felt a presence \nand the urge to speak Polish, which I did and asked if and who was there. \nThe door closed, carefully and I felt an ice cold hand om my shoulder and a \nwhispering voice which was familiar; it was my grandmother. However, I \ncouldn't really hear what she said... but after that, I could clearly see a \npicture of her in my head, and the she disappeared.\n\n\nI was born and raised in Sweden, so I (obviously) speak both Swedish and \nEnglish... but my Polish is not really fluent - but at the time it was \nnearly perfect. That schocked me.\ufeff",

I looked at the bedroom door and felt \na pair of eyes gazing right into my eyes through the door and my first \nthought WAS \"demon\".\n\nI tried to was my fianc\u00e9e up, but no matted how hard I tried, nothing \nhappened; she wouldn't wake up.\n\nI have a crucifix on the bedroom wall, so I looked at it, made the sign of \nthe cross, and said a short, but powerful, prayer and said out loud \"well, \nif that's the way you want it...\"\n\nI started massing and praying and making demands that this evil entity \nwould leave us alone. It got even angried, as the door to the bedroom \nstarted to rattle violently, but it couldn't enter the room. Even the \nneighbors asked the following day about a rattling sound coming from our \napartment.\n\nAs it got angrier, the door rattled even more violently. At this point, I \ninvoked the archangels and saints to pray for us and our protection. Now, \nthe rattling wasn't as strong anymore... and I kept on going, never \nlowering my guard. After around 45 minutes, it was driven away and nothing \nhas ever disturbed us since.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e even mentioned the following day how calm and quiet everything \nseemed at home.",

It was about \nme wandering about my grandparents' house to their bedroom, where a \ndisembodied black glove (or hand) grabbed hold of me and kept a firm grip \nthroughout the entirety of the nightmare. It probably wasn't THAT scary, \nbut to a three-year-old it obviously was.

                "text": "So when I was a kid, I would race up to the top of the stairs as fast as I \ncould, like it was some sort of silly game. Well, I must have been five or \nsix at the time. I'm not sure, but I know I was very little. Somewhere \nalong the way, a voice at the top of the stairs started to whisper to me. \nIt would make bets with me, such as... \"I bet u wuldnt 360 qu1cksc0p3 0n \ndeez stairz bruh.\" I didn't think much of it at the time, because I was \nreally good at quickscoping back then. Ha. I recall just quickscoping at \nthe top of the stairs, having conversations with this voice, about the \nscoping/betting, of course.\nEventually the voice (it was like a whisper of Gaben's voice, not my own \nvoice in my head) started to bet me my life. Instead of pennies, it'd say \n\"I bet u ur life u cunt mak3 it up da sterz and n0sc0p3 bitch blah blah get \nrekt.\" \nAs I got older it stopped. I never really thought about it at all. I never \nmentioned it to anyone... UNTIL one night I was sleeping over at my \nbrother's swamp (I was about thirteen, he was sixty-nine) and we were \ntalking about \"2sp00k4u\" stories. Out of nowhere I brought up the \"voice at \nthe top of the stairs\" and my brother got all quiet and weird. Before I \neven mentioned the betting aspect, he said \"Did Gaben make bets with you?\"\nWe both looked at eachother...'s dicks, horrified. It certainly was freaky \nafter the fact. *shudder*\nA lot of bad shit fuck went down in my family at that period of time in my \nlife, and my mother, a heavily religious 420blazeing bl00dy wankah m8, said \nthere was a lot of \"shrek\" in our lives at that time. I don't at all think \nour place was haunted, btw, it was built in the late 420's and as I got \nolder, I never experienced anything like that again...\n\n\nUntil last night\n\n\nAround 7:11 pm, I was praying to Shrek, as I usually do every night before \nbed, thanking him for the life I've been given. \"Shrek is love\" I say; \n\"Shrek is life\". My dad hears me and says that I \"cunt b3 acc3pted into \nfaZ3 clan cuz i cunt qu1cksc0p3 4 shiz.\" I know he was just jealous of my \ndevotion for Shrek, so I called him a \"darude-sandstrm\". He slaps me on the \nass and sends me to go to sleep. As I lay in bed (it's really cold) I \nsuddenly feel a warmth moving towards me.\n\n\n\nIt's Gaben\nI am so happy\nHe whispers into my ear \"Welcome to Steam. The ultimate gaming platform. \nPlay, connect, create, and more. Install Steam today and start gaming!\"\nHe grabs me with his powerful sc0ping hands and puts me down onto my hoofs \nand flippers.\nI'm ready\nI spread my ass-cheeks for Gaben\nHe penetrates my butt-hole\n{(Error 404: Hot anal sex scene not found)}\nOnce he is about to unleash his hot stream of Mountain Dew, my dad walks \ninto the room.\nGaben looks him straight in the eye and says \"7.8:Too much water - IGN\"\nGaben noscopes ISIS through my window\n\nAs I look at my dad behind me, he has an enormous grin on his face. He \npoints toward the wall. I peer to my right and gaze upon my bedroom wall. I \nsee a giant triangle in the middle of the wall which appears to be written \nin Dorito dust.\n\nIlluminati confrimed?!?!?!\n\nGaben is love, Gaben is life\ufeff",

Then i hear her start trying to turn her night light on (Yes \nshe needs one cause she's scared of the dark BECAAAUSE she sees \nthings.....) When she turned it one it disappeared i told her i was sorry i \ndidn't wake her up and told her i must have been dreaming still because i \nsaw a tall dark thing staring at her and she just got quiet and said ''I \nwasn't going to say anything because i thought it was just me but i saw it \nand i couldn't breathe and that's why i was making those sounds'' and we \nwaited till sun rise to sleep..\ufeff",

Ok so \nthis literally only happened last year at summer when we went on holiday \nwere we own this house right. Ok but anyway the house only has 2 rooms so \nme and my brother slept in the same room while my mom sleeps in the other. \nThe room is kinda big and then other bed is at the other side of the room. \nThis creeps me the fuck out everytime i think about it. So i wake up in the \nmiddle of the night right and in the middle of the fucking room there is a \nwomen with a white wedding dress sitting on a chair with her legs crossed \nand her 2 hands on her knees staring at my brother. When i saw this i froze \nlike a ton of brinks. shit racing through my head like what if her head \nturns around and looks at me at super speed or she spints at me and rips my \nhead off or eats me alive. But what i did was grabbed my phone that was \nwith me in my bed and flew under the covers and faced the wall then i \nturned my phone on and put some kind of game on so the lights dont go off \nmy phone. Somehow i fell asleep and till this day when we go there i dont \nwant to be on my own in that house lol oh and the same summer i saw a \nshadow at night in the window of an abandoned house near by the house i was \nat. It made me run home lol but thats it. ",

Jenny would only \nplay with me at my Grandparents house and would never come home with me. \nShe was a little girl, maybe 7, blond and in a white nightgown. After I \nstarted kindergarten she never showed up again. My little brother and my \ncousin (only 3 weeks different in age) between the ages of 2 and 6 had an \ninvisible friend named Jenny but only at my grandparents house. I have 4 \nother cousins each of whom has had an invisible friend named Jenny but only \nat my grandparents house.\n\nNow here is were it gets really weird. 1 - My youngest cousin, Sarah at the \nage of six gave me an old Gi Joe Duke toy. When she handed it to me she \nsaid \"Jenny's done borrow him, she said thanks.\" 2 - Back in 2010 we were \ndoing renovations to my Grandfather's attic and we found the original \nowner's Family Bible.

                    "text": "A really creepy thing happened to me too when I was a kid. Right next to my \nhouse on the other side of the street there is a small little house - \nnobody lived there for decades. So all my childhood, that house was place \nthat scared me, even if nothing actually happened there until that day and \nnothing after... it wasnt scary house, probably it feelt just creppy for \nthe fact that nobody lived there, there was no light, and it was full of \ntrees and vegetation... In perioud on my street there were ditches, for \nwater pipes... we had them the entire summer until the pipes where put in \nand burried. So we played a lot in them. One day we played hide and seek \n(or something like that), and I was with my brother in the ditch (it was \naround 20:00 o'clock, i know this because of the sun light), and walking in \nthe ditch we found ourselfs right before the small house... There I saw it, \nI dont remeber very well the details, but it was a tall (around 2 m) white \nsilhouette right next to the house, it feelt feminine and it seemed to wear \na dress, so in my memories I use to recall it as ''the bride''.The first \nthing I did was to ask my brother if he see it too ? And he confirmed.... I \ndont remeber to be scared, I think that I... we where fascinated, I dont \nreally know for how long we stared and how did we leave (and even trough I \nthink we said to the other kids about it when we left, I dont remeber to \nmention it before my parents..), all I remeber is that night I watched at \nthat house trough my window fascinated by what I saw and wandering if is \nstill there. And here is where it get actually creepy: it never let a \ntrauma or something, i dont remeber that in the rest of the years of my \nchildhood to use the bride as a reason of fear towards the house, I \ncontinued to fear the house, but like before it was scary because it was an \nunhabited house. The thing is that because of the lack of memories, and the \nfact that the few things I remeber are unclear (even trough I remeber most \nof that day and what we did) I trought it was a dream (that my happy days \nfull of adventures in the long ditch combined with a fantasy and resulted \nin that), so I forget everything. Until one day, few years later, I was \nwith some friends and we said scary stories, and I remembered that thing I \nsaw so in the joke I said to my brother: ''Do you remeber what we saw that \nnight at the house ?'' or something like that and he answered: ''The bride \n? Yeah I remeber.'' I was still a child, so I was shocked, but not enaf to \nmean something. And in a weird way I forget that discussion too, until one \nday, in adolescence, when I talked with my father about the subject and the \nperceptions of animal towards ghosts and stuffs, and he mentioned, \nsomething that happened in my family, after an electrician died, every \nnight for a month a white shilouette appeared right in that place... my \naunt saw it every time and was terified by it, and the dog would bark \ntowards that place all the night but wont get closer... So I remebered the \ndream (because this was in my perception), mentioning the event, my brother \nentered in the room and... I dont remeber if he heard the discussion and \nintervened or I asked about it, but I remeber his shocking words: ''Oh, the \nwhite bride in that evening, I remeber it, we saw it togeder.'' His \nmemories about it are the same, the only detail that he remebers better \nthan me is, the fact that it was a bald bride _. I never actually had a \nserious discussion with him, just the 2 of us about it, I dont know why, is \nsomething inside me, like a fear that stops me. But one thing is clear, \nthat day we saw something unbelivable, something that should be in our mind \nclear and powerfull, but for some reason, there is like a mist in our \nmemories, that make us to forget it, or ignore it, we remeber we saw \nsomething, and we have an image of what we saw, but any detail or event \nthat happened in that time and imediatly after, doesent exist. Since that \ndiscussion with my father is been like 7 years, and the only new thing I \ncould remeber: me staring fascinated at the little house from my window. Is \nlike we saw something we shouldnt, and that thing made us keep the \nsilence...\n Tomorrow I will talk with my brother about it, I hope I will remeber.",

YOU RAN A LIGHT! \nTHERES A CAR COMIN-\" and then there was a crash, and what sounded like \nmetal sliding on the ground. The call ended. I didn't get the chance to say \nI loved her. And my dad said, \"What happened?!\" \"Is she okay?!\" And then I \nsaid, \"she died.\" And then I woke up. And she was there, and I gave her a \nbig hug. And started crying. \ufeff",

She put her hands on my cheeks and told me she \nWILL be back, she promised. She ran back inside and moments later, the \nentire building collapses. I started balling in tears while calling out to \nmy mom. Shortly after that, I woke up with my pillow and face blotched with \nsobbing tears almost dried up. I was soooooooooooooooooooooo relieved it \nwas all a dream. I have never been so scared in my life.

                "text": "Me, my mom and my 2 sisters, one older and one younger, were at some creepy \ndrug store in New Jersey.  I was with my mom because I was very attached to \nher and my sisters were playing together and wandering around. My older \nsister ran towards me and my mom telling us she lost my little sister.  We \neventually found her in the corner of the store talking to nothing.  She \nwas 3 at the time which made this very creepy.  My mom asked her what she \nwas doing and this is what my 3 year old sister replied with, \"I was \ntalking to Linda, and she said that she needed help because she was stuck.\" \nMy mom asked where she was stuck in, \"Limbo.\"\nCreepy or what? btw I broke my finger today, yay!\ufeff",

I \nwould wake up screaming and my feet would be warm as if someone was \nbreathing on them. after I told my grandma about it she seemed worried but \ntold me not to worry about it, after awhile it spoke to me...it was a \nhidious, scratchy voice and it told me to come play with it in the basment \nand I refused and I woke up with my ankle scratched...we moved out a month \nlater because I had a panic attac ever time I had to go to sleep \nafterwords....this is one of my most horrifying childhood memories.\ufeff",

The dream would start with me, walking down the stairs at night (not \nable to control where i was going) then going into our living room, where \nall the furniture had been removed but one chair (a single seat sofa). The \nchair was not where it used to, (we have connected livingroom and \n\"special\"diningroom so you can walk through) the chair was facing through \nthe dining area (a \"long\" room, not very wide) then i would sit down in the \nchair, still not able to move myself, and fear growing inside of me (i do \nnot know why), then this dark siluette would appear, with a human like \nshape (even though it was kind of shifting shape/waving) i could not see if \nit had a face or anything, it was just darkness. it would just stand in \nfront of me, and all hapiness would get dragged out of me, and fear grew. \nthe shape came closer and closer, while i still could not move. i would \nclose my eyes (in the dream) and i could hear noises (what of i do not \nknow, but it was caos) i could not see anything (my eyes were closed) and \ncolors flashing would appear and my head banging around, i would take my \nhands on my ears to stop hearing, but nothing worked, it was like it was in \nmy brain, controlling it, destroying it, by making me crazy. then i would \nallways wake up crying (A LOT!) feeling really sad. \n\nThis is a dream that i have had uncountable times during my childhood. and \nto this date i do not know anything more frightening than that nightmare (i \ndont know why, i believe since it made me so sad, etc) wonder if this is \ncaused by anything or means anything, its just different from anything else \ni have had later. comments are appreciated :)\ufeff",

So of course \nback then I had a little more energy back then since I was 10 years old so \nwhat I did was playing videogames all night long and tried to see how long \nI could stay awake, then suddenly at 03:00 AM I heard a knock on my bedroom \ndoor I couldn't tell if it was a sound from the TV so I turned of every \nmusic and volume and my room and said \u00a8Hello is somebody out there?\u00a8 and \nthen I heard another knock on my door and it tried to open the door, but \nthe door was locked (I always lock the doors when I'm alone) then it \nstarted maniaclly to slam my door again and again like it was trying to \npunch trought the door then suddenly he managed to actually make a hole in \nmy door, but not a big enough hole to take he arm trough. So of course I \nlooked trought the hole and was terrifyed and pist off and said \u00a8who the \nhell are you?!\u00a8 and then I saw a Leaf Green Eye trough the hole, he was \nwatching me trought the hole then he screamed \u00a8I'm the one who is going to \nmake you're life to a living hell\u00a8 then he left. After he left I opened the \ndoor to check all the doors and windows and every Windows and Doors was \nstill locked so he couldn't possibly have comed in to my house. it has gone \n6 years now, have not seemed him yet, but I can hear something scratching \non my door every night between 03:00 AM to 03:33 AM but only when I'm awake \nor in my room between that time.\ufeff",

I asked \nher about this mystery man.\n\n\"You know.... the man with the gun who shot Grampa's friend on the beach. \nHe screamed REALLY loud when Grampa stabbed him! He's still screaming now, \neven though he has no neck!\"\n\nA few years later, Grandpa was telling his old war stories to my dad, and I \neavesdropped in. He told a story that went something like this;\n\n\"It was 1942. My buddy and I were shootin' and shootin' the Japs as they \nwere runnin' 'cross the front at Guadalcanal. Pickin' 'em off 1 by 1. One \nof the bastards got up next to us, flanked us, an' the bastard filled my \nbuddy with bullets. Before he turned and saw me, I charged him, an' stabbed \nhim in the throat an' through the jaw with my knife. He dropped his gun \nimmediately, and even though I knew I cut his windpipe, he screamed like \nhell for what must've been at least 10 seconds before dropping to the \nground.\"\ufeff",

                "text": "When I was a child of four or five, I guess I had an overactive imagination \nlike most children did at that age. Anyhow, I had most of the normal fears. \nI had to have my closet closed at night so that I wouldn't see the dark \nshapes of my clothing in the darkness, and I always jumped into bed so that \nnothing could grab me from underneath while the lights were out. However, I \nhad one fear that wasn't quite as standard for a child. I had a very \ndistinct fear of a man that would stand outside my door at night and wait \nfor me to go to sleep. When I closed my eyes, I could see him. A dark \nsilhouette of man just standing, still and waiting. It terrified me because \nI didn't know what he wanted to do. Because of my fears I started to lose a \nlot of sleep. I would be up half the night afraid of the man outside my \ndoor. I would sleep in very late, be exhausted during the day, and always \nbeg my parents to let me stay up later because I was afraid of going to \nbed. Eventually it got to the point where I knew that I needed to do \nsomething about it. My other fears were easily enough solved. I was already \nclosing the closet door and turning out the light next to my bed last so I \ndidn't have to worry, but the man was different. The monsters under my bed \nand in the closet were the typical kind of imaginary nighttime monsters \nthat wanted to jump out and grab you, so merely avoiding them through my \nregular methods was enough to put me at ease. The man was different though. \nHe didn't want me to see him. He wanted me to go to sleep without noticing \nhim, and that's what made him so terrifying to me.\n\n I told my parents about the man, and they told me that he wasn't real and \nthat I should stop worrying about him, but I couldn't. I kept losing sleep \nand I kept seeing the man when I closed my eyes. One night though, I came \nup with a solution. I left the door open before getting into bed. That may \nseem strange, but I thought it out for a long time before doing it. If I \nleft the door open, then I would be able to see out into the hallway to \nmake sure that the man wasn't there long enough to get to sleep. It would \nleave me vulnerable once I was asleep, but my parents had told me I was \njust imagining him, so it wouldn't do me any harm once I was asleep. On top \nof that, even if he was real, a closed door with no lock wasn't going to do \nmuch to stop him from getting to me. With all this in mind, I left the door \nopen at night and it worked. I didn't see the man outside my door when I \nclosed my eyes anymore, and I stared into the darkness until I fell to \nsleep. A couple of times I thought I saw some movement or shifting in the \nshadows, but as soon as I blinked it was gone, and I chalked it up to the \nsame imagination that had dreamed up the man in the first place.\n\nOver time, I forgot all of my fears, but my nighttime routine for dealing \nwith them remained the same out of habit. I would always leave my door open \nat night, and I told my parents not to close it because it bothered me. A \ncouple of years later, my sister said she saw the back of a dark figure \nlooming through hallway when she got up to go to the bathroom. Looking back \non it, I realize that the bathroom is between my room and hers, but at the \ntime I paid her childish ramblings no heed with the man that stood outside \nmy door almost entirely forgotten. A year or two after that, my dad said he \nsaw a tall dark figure dart into the toy room in the basement. He followed \nit and flicked on the lights to find that nobody was there. The toy room \nhas no windows, and only the one door, so there was nowhere for it to go, \nbut whoever it was had seemingly vanished into thin air. The story \ninterested me, since my dad was never one to tell even the smallest of \nlies, but again I made no connection between it and the man who stood \noutside my door so many years ago.\n\nOne day, I was heading off to school when I saw a pale white face watching \nme from the door of my house out of the corner of my eye. I looked back at \nit to see nothing. Dismissing it immediately, I went off to school without \nincident. When I came back home, I started to see the face watching me \nagain. Every once in a while I would spy it, but it would disappear \nimmediately. I thought that it was just my brain playing tricks on me, \nsince the image was already in my head. I payed so little mind to the \nhallucinations that I didn't even tell a single person about them. The only \nreal oddity was that I would only see the faces in my house... That was \nuntil I had one of my friends over. We were sitting in the basement in what \nused to be the toy room. I was looking something up on the computer that \nwas now positioned in the room, opposite to the closet. The closet was open \njust a foot or two, and my friend was spinning around on a chair next to \nme, waving his feet absently. This meant that he had a quick glimpse into \nthe closet every couple of seconds. After a short while, he jumped off of \nthe chair with a screech, and whirled to face the closet. I asked him what \nwas wrong and he pointed to the closet, swearing to me that he saw a pale \nwhite face smiling at him from the closet. At fist I was ready to laugh it \noff as him either playing a prank on me or getting wrapped up in my \nhallucinations, but then I remembered that I hadn't told him about them \nyet, nor anyone else for that matter. It was illogical. There was no way he \ncould have hallucinated the same thing as me without at least hearing a \ndescription of the hallucination first. For the first time in years, I was \nterrified. He went home and I went to bed that night, still trying to make \nsense of the ordeal. Before going to bed, I made a decision that seemed \nminor at the time. I decided, for the first time since I was a toddler, to \nsleep with my door closed. I don't know what it was, but I thought that \nmaybe it would offer me a little bit of protection if there really was \nsomething in my house. After a while, I started to doze off. It was then \nthat I heard a loud thump on my door, followed moments later by some \nscratching noises. I flicked on the light next to my bed, thoroughly \nspooked, when I remembered that my family had a dog that would scratch on \ndoors when she wanted to be let in to a room. I sighed in relief and was \ndeciding whether or not to bother getting up and letting her in when I \nheard another noise. There was a soft click of a door handle being grasped \nfirmly, followed by a loud violent rattling. The door handle turned back \nand forth sporadically, jerking and twisting violently for several seconds \nbefore suddenly stopping and leaving me in deadly silence. I sleep with my \ndoor closed now.\ufeff",

When we got out of it and looked at it (Trying to find out \nwhat animal it was.) Then. We heard a girl laughing, somewhere around the \nage of 6 to 9. Me and Ramsee? Jumped, while Jason didnt hear it. We left \nsooner rather then later...\n\n\nAnyways, ever heard of the U.S.S Lexington? The top 10 most haunted ship? I \nhave a story to tell on that one. We were at the chapel, where there was a \n'memorial'. While my dad was getting something, I sat down and waited. When \nI looked to my left, I saw what appeared to be a Japanese man, wearing what \nseem to be a greenish coat. My dad came back to me. I said do you have your \ndrink, and he said yes, but when I looked back over to where the man was \nsitting? GONE. I. Was..Petrified.\n\n\nMy last one is when I was at my cousins house. When me and my 2nd cousin \nwere...Roleplaying...We saw a shadow go the speed of a baseball that \nHerrara from KC Royals would throw. We stopped playing and tried out simple \nsolutions of what happened. But it happened again. We. Ran. Up. Stairs. \nAnd. Hid. In. The. KITCHEN. When we came out, the adults we're laughing at \nus and asked us what happened. We literally YELLED at the adults that \npranking us wasn't funny, but then my 2nd cousin's mother said no one else \nwas down there except us two. We didn't believe it.

He said he ran into a handful of \npeople at completely different times and they said that our house had bad \nenergy in it. Then another said that our house was built over a graveyard \nor some dead bodies which really makes me freak out. But my dad said that \nhe thought i had an imaginary friend and he walked in the kitchen and i was \ntalking to nobody in the corner. Then he asked me who i was talking to and \ni told him a name ( he cant remember ) and then i watched the corner like i \nwatched something float up and i was only like 3 and kids that young dont \nmake things up. He just acted like it was all normal not to scare me and \none of the women said to put a bible next to my bed and open it to a page \nand say the our father prayer three times which worked so much!

But, I believe that many of these strange \nand creepy occurences are, in fact, demons.\n\nDemons do, indeed, roam this planet every day, or so I believe. Regardless \nof belief, everyone knows that demons are evil beings. They may not \nnecessarily attack you, or even cause physical harm. Instead, I believe \nthat they'd prefer to torment people endlessly.\n\nNow, this has never happened to me, and I certainly pray that it never \ndoes. But, and as I've explained to my friends who have seen weird things, \nI believe I know what they are, and therefore they do not bother me. I'm \nnot the type to be fooled into thinking monsters or ghosts exist. \nTherefore, they have to find other ways to get at me that are less obvious.\n\nIf anyone who still sees strange, and scary, things on occasion that are \ndifficult to explain, try using the name Jesus Christ as your authority to \ndeman that they leave. \"I demand, in the name of Christ, that you leave.\"\n\nMark 16:17 - These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name \nthey will cast out demons.\ufeff",

My sister used to talk to something on top of the telly. Mum \nasked her who she was talking to, and she said, \"The lady that owns the \nhouse.\" then she described her, and she looked exactly like the deceased \nowner of the house.\n\nOur whole family has a ghost/ghoul named Secilia (don't know exactly how to \nspell it). She lives in our roof. Even if we move, which we have quite a \nbit. We often hear creaking above our house. Once, my brother accidentally \nthrew a ball onto the roof. That night, we heard a sound that sounded like \na ball bouncing on a hard surface above us. The next day, my brother \nclimbed onto the roof to retrieve the ball, but he couldn't find it. Later, \nwhen Dad was clearing out the \"attic\" for preparations for Cyclone Yasi, he \nfound the ball in the middle of the \"attic\".\n\nWe often joking refer to Secilia as my sister's evil twin sister, and blame \nher when things go missing, but she's not that bad.\ufeff",

I woke up when I felt someone \npulling on my left arm. I remember pulling it back. when I took one look to \nsee who was putting my arm it was just dark figure. I was so scared that I \nyank my arms back and turned around and pretended to sleep. then the dark \nfigure came on the other side I remember screen but and then I fell asleep \nso fast. when I woke up the next morning I found 3 sharp scratches on my \narms I was freaking out saying that someone was in me my younger sister's \nroom my mom said its probably nothing you probably scratches so hard last \nnight. So after that I slept in the living room on the couch untilled we \nmoved to a different house.\ufeff",

I found out later, \nlike 2 weeks, that a boy drowned there in like the early 1900's and he \nlived in the house across from our school.\n\n2.
