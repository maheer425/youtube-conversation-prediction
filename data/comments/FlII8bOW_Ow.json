(I have a hard enough time doing a rope \nbraid in a mirror it's so disorienting, so I should've seen that coming. \nAgain, I digress.) \n\nI'm extremely annoyed because while you make this seem easy to do, I can't \nfigure it out. The written instructions don't help, either. I'm also \nironically annoyed at myself for being so riled up about it, it's just a \nhair knot. XD; I throw in the towel on this one for now.
