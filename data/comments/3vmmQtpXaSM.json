Also, the recipe that I translated is on \ntheir website not directly form the video, some steps might not quite match \nwith the video here. So, I am apologise. But I think it will still come out \nthe same, though. \n\nFor 5 servings\nIngredients for The bread with grounded pork\nminced cilantro root 1 tsp.\nFinely chopped garlic 1 tbsp\nGrounded pepper 1 tsp\nGrounded pork 1 1/2 cup\nEgg 1\nSoy sauce 1 tbsp\nWater 2 tbsp\nBread 10 slices\ncilantro leaf 1bunch\nRed chilli 1\nVegetable oil 4 cups\n\nIngredients for The sauce\nDistilled vinegar 1 1/3 cup\nSugar 2 tbsp\nSalt 1/2 tsp\nCucumber 4\nRed chilli 1\nShallot 2 heads\n\nProcess:\nMake the sauce by boil sugar, salt and the vinegar until reduce quite a \nbit. Take off the heat and let it cool until room temperature. Then, add \ncucumber, shallot and red chilli. Garnished with some cilantro leaves, when \nready to serve.\nPound cilantro root, garlic and pepper until become fine paste. Add the \npaste to grounded pork along with half an egg (reserve the other for frying \nthe bread). Add water and season with soy sauce. Mix well and kinda massage \nthe meat until it gets sticky and pasty.\nSlice the bread into bite size pieces and toast them in the oven until dry \n(150 Celsius for 10 minutes). Let it cool down a bit. Then, spoon the pork \nmixture on to the bread. The pork mixture should be kinda flat on the edges \nand round on the centre. Brush them lightly with the egg that preserve from \nstep 2. Then, Garnish with cilantro leaf and finely diced red pepper.\nHeat up the oil using medium-low heat. When the oil is hot, fry the bread. \nPork side down first, until the edges of the bread is golden brown and then \nflip. Continue to fry the bread until golden brown. Then, rest on cooling \nrack.\n\nEnjoy!",
