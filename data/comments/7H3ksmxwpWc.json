That \nsaid, I'll propose a thought experiment that does not violate our knowledge \nof physics, but poses some interesting questions.  This subject is timely \nfor me (if you'll pardon the irony) because just yesterday I engaged in a \ndiscussion w/ my son & his best friend about cosmology.  [For background, \nmy son has a doctorate in computer engineering, his friend is a molecular \nbiologist, and I'm a mechanical engineer; so our discussion was more \ninformed than many about entropy & time.]\nDuring our discussion, my son pointed out that entropy can work in reverse. \n This brought up the subject of the single direction of time in relation to \nthe 3 orthogonal spatial dimensions that each has 2 directions.  I'd \nmentioned that biological evolution seems anti-entropic, to which my son \nreminded us that earth is not a closed system because it receives energy \nfrom the sun.  From there we discussed the expanding space of our \ndetectable cosmos and its implications for time.  Taking this a step \nfurther, I brought up the following scenario.\nIf time & space might be infinite, then couldn't there be 'bubbles' of \nspace containing stars & other matter/energy that are alternately expanding \n& contracting as in a churning foam with varying pressures?  In this \nthought experiment, contracting bubbles would each focus \nmatter/energy/information towards a nucleation point or small volume, \nreversing the direction of time for the relevant components.  Other bubbles \nlike ours would have forward time as a result of spatial expansion.  Then, \nthere'd be zones or interfaces where time would stand still!  Such a \nscenario would mean that our observed cosmos is a local fluke that only \naffects our experience of observation of red-shift & its co-committed \ncosmic horizon, the boundary beyond which light will never reach us within \nour limited time of observation.  Perhaps what we call dark matter or dark \ngravity is merely an incursion of dynamically opposite bubble(s)! \nConsidering this possible scenario, shouldn't we also question hypotheses \nabout a dissolving cosmos that 'ends' in complete entropy?  Also, light \nemitted from the furthest reaches only informs us about regions of a cosmos \nthat existed billions of years ago, telling us nothing about what's \nhappening right now (whenever & wherever that is).\nTheoretical physicists may eventually determine the unknown, turning it \ninto the known with evidence & better maths, but I suspect we'll find \nlimits to what we can know about the cosmos.",

His velocity \nresults in time dilation so when the astronaut returns, more time has \npassed on Earth than he has experienced, resulting in his twin being older \nthan him.\n\nThe paradox arises when we realize that not only does the twin on the Earth \nsee time dilate for the astronaut, but the astronaut should see the same \nthing for his twin on Earth, and so would expect to be older than his twin \nwhen he returns, not the other way around.\n\nThe paradox is resolved when we take into account that the astronaut had to \naccelerate into order to achieve his great velocity, had to decelerate in \norder to slow down, accelerate again in the opposite direction, and then \ndecelerate again once he returns. It's the acceleration and deceleration \nthat causes him to actually be younger than his twin on Earth.

This includes all brain \nactivity. After all, our memories can easily be explained as nothing more \nthan chemical reactions. If proper time goes backwards, then those \nreactions go backwards.\n\nOf course, this assumes there is such an absolute thing as proper time.\n\nIt is most likely so that you cannot travel through time. It may be \npossible to reverse the arrow of time. However, this is not time travel and \nit poses (and note, it MUST pose) these problems I have mentioned earlier. \nThey have nothing to do with paradoxes, they are simply simple logic. \nProper time goes back, events go back.\n\nThen again, we are used to saying that the future is in our hands, meaning \nthat the events could unfold in many different ways. Why should they not \nhave this ability to unfold in many different ways in the past as well?",

                    "text": "+Jesse Heinonen while I don't disagree that time travel backwards is \nimpossible I am not sure I agree or understand your comments regarding \nmemories and why they would be erased. It seems you are concerning yourself \nwith paradox implication and jumping to assumptions from there.\nIt seems to me that the real reason why time travel would not be \npossible is the subatomic duplication it would create, rather than the \nparadoxes.\n\nIf I could use a crude metaphor to illustrate what I am talking about.\n\nOn a subatomic level nothing is new right? It's like having a large \nfish bowl of water filled to the brim. Then representing the subatomic \nconstant of matter by using the water to represent all matter. With in the \nbowl there are balloons (representing some of the mass, so just to clarify \nthe water is at the brim with the balloons present). The first week the \nballoons are virtually empty but the second week you transfer some water \nfrom the bowl into them while balloon and water remains in bowl (ignore the \npractical issues here of potential water loss from evaporation, spilling \netc. and just imagine you can do this for the sake of this crude metaphor). \nSo basically the mass including the quantity of water remain the same and \nas a result the water is perfectly at the brim.\nNow say the balloon full of water represented me and the first week I \nsimply did not exist. The matter that makes me who I presently am existed \nbefore me but it was making up other things.\nNow if you could time travel the balloon full of water in the second week \nback to the first week, while it remains in the bowl then the water (and \nthe balloon) will be duplicated into the first week and the water would \noverflow.\n\nPlease excuse my crude and potentially hard to follow metaphor but if you \nget what I am saying it basically means that paradoxes like the \n\"grandfather paradox\" or the cause and effect issue are the least of our \nproblems. The biggest problem would surely be the issue of duplicating \nmatter.\nIf I was sent back in time 50 years the subatomic particles that make up \nall the matter that make up present day me would also exist in the past, so \nif present day me went into the past the amount of matter in the Universe \njust increased.\nParadoxes are less of a barrier than this issue in my opinion, though I may \nneed better education, understanding, knowledge and intelligence.",

                    "text": "+YouKnowImRightHanded But that's not time travelling, it's time flowing \njust as normal. Even if the whole other Earth did this, they would still go \nto the future and you would still go to the future. There is no such thing \nas time travelling, because time is the growth of entropy. When entropy \ngrows, time flows forwards. The more it grows, the more time flows. If \nentropy decreases, time flows backwards. If it doesn't change, then time \ndoesn't flow at all.\n\nIn fact, if there was a way to really go back in time, in time itself, not \njust relative to other people's clocks, this would happen:\n1. When you go back in time, you go into the exact moment, where the \nfuture,    from which you left, has not yet happened.\n2. Your brain would of course be in the exact moment, where your time \ntravel hasn't yet happened.\n3. Therefore, your memories, that are past the moment you travel to, are \nerased too. Simple, there can be no memory of the future, and if you go \nback in time, of course your brain goes as well. \n4. When you have time traveled backwards, you could have no knowing that \nyou had time traveled, because the memories have been erased. Therefore, \nyou could have no way of changing the future, and things would happen the \nsame way they did. This is because the moment in the past where you \ntraveled, is the actual moment of the past, and everything is the same.\n5. This means that when in the past, the only way to get back to the \n\"present\" is to wait until time flows. Of course, you wouldn't know you \ntime traveled, so you would do all the things you did. This leads to the \nconclusion:\n6. When you arrive to the moment you left for the past, you do it all over \nagain. This means that when you time travel backwards, you basically die.\n\nOf course, because the amount of energy stays always the same, this is out \nof options in the first place. A body can't disappear from a certain \nmoment. Time travel backwards-impossible.",

I've organised my stream of consciousness below:\n1. 9000years is way too far into the future for me, so I considered what \n2000 years into the future would be like.\n2. YAY, I get to visit (and permanently stay in the future). Who will I \ntell about my travels when I get back to Earth from space? I want it to at \nleast be people dear to me. Oh shit, everyone I know would have all died! \nAll generations of people I know will have died off. None of the family \nmembers I knew would even be alive to see me!! Sure we can assume the \nscience, technology and medicine in that future will be so advanced that \nwe'll be immune to or have a cure to most diseases and ailments but that \nwon't change the fact everyone you knew would have died. That's sad.\n3. Pfft, I don't need loved ones, my journey will have advanced science for \ngoodness sake, I'll be a heroine written about in history books and science \nbooks, leaving a legacy! Kids will want to be like ME when they grow up! \nErm, not likely... Science will have probably advanced so quickly and \nprogressively that they'd already have created technology that allows \nhumans to travel twice the speed they would have done 2000years ago, and \nthousands of humans on earth would have experienced time travel taken a way \nshorter time than I did. So when I get back, the scientists will just throw \nback their heads and laugh at my ancient ways of travel, whilst feeling \nsorry for me.\n4. Obviously a lot will have changed in this future, I don't think humans \nwill have evolved much through natural mutations, but possibly through the \ninterventions of science. So maybe not everyone would be fully 'human' in \nthe real sense of the world, maybe we'll have bionic men and women with \nspecial physical features for medical purposes, such as organ transplants \ncreated by stem cell technology and such. People born will be healthier, \nand immune to almost everything (at a micro-level) that threatens humanity \n- natural disasters and climate change on the other hand may still be big \n(macro) issues. Perhaps the question of consciousness would have been \nresolved too, with humans existing as thinking and feelings beings despite \ntechno-alterations, neurologists might discover the mystery of \nconsciousness. With all that said, humanity might be so intelligent in the \nfuture, I might be too stupid to even understand its advancement. I \nwouldn't even be able to function in such a world, I'd be an outcast. This \nis also a very sad predicament.\n5. This is just a few of my ponderings out of a dozen that I considered, \nbut I don't have enough space here. All in all, as awesome as the idea of \ntime (space) travel sounds, I would just be miserable in a future time too \ndistant from my own. It wouldn't be worth it. I mean, I do wanna be around \nwhen we make all of these scientific discoveries but not at the cost of my \nhappiness and sanity. \n\n**On the other hand, if immortality was made possible, that's something I \ncould live with (that's only if you can actually choose when you want to \ndie. Lol, this would probably be the existential question of humanity in \n5000 years time, when do I want to die?)** :)",

Either you just dilate, or you actually do \ntravel from one moment of time to another which is not immediately after \nthe one you just were at. And that is why we need to make a distinction \nbetween them. The problem's not what we call these two scenarios, it's \nmaking sure everyone's talking about the same thing, and when people are \ntalking about time travelling, they rarely mean \"by the way, we're all \ngoing to the future right now!\"\n\nAnd interestingly, Planck time might not be the smallest possible unit of \ntime anyway, because it's only defined through the use of Planck length. \nEven though we do not detect any changes within a time period that's \nshorter than Planck time. And if there's no smallest finite unit of time, \nthen it's exactly as with the lines: All line have exactly as many points \nin them, so all timelines must have exactly as many moments in them.\n\nAnyway, good points. I dearly hope you understood why I've been trying to \nexplain that there are two different scenarios.

You say it is like \na 1 inch line and a 10 inch line that has been squished. But the 10 inch \nline would start before the 1 inch line does in this example.

So if you travel really really fast, \nyou'd just dilate it to a different degree. And, from another object moving \nat the same speed, you wouldn't seem to be experiencing any weirdness at \nall. \n\nSo if you did that, you would reach a certain moment \"faster\", but you'd \nstill co-exist alongside all observers.

Because if t1 is 0 which is instantaneous then t2 is going to be \nabove 0 due to the 700:1 year ratio. In this case the person is not feeling \nthe time flow on, right?

I've heard there have been researches on \npossibilities to travel faster than light (this is actually a bit false, \nbut this is the way one science magazine advertised the new studies), but \nit will take decades, I guess, until we will have something like that. \nMight be a lot more, because modern politics and economy situation doesn't \nreally allow people to put much money on seemingly useless research.\n\nIncrease in mass is something we can do nothing about. Yeah, we can eat \nmore, but then we are more certain to not reach the future.\n\nIncrease in energy density is something we could discuss about, but again, \nmodern technology isn't what is required. We are able to create huge energy \ndensities, but only for a short while. Doesn't have any significant effect \non reaching the future quicker.\n\nI've recently tried to figure out if there is an actual way to measure time \nusing entropy. A lot of physicists say that entropy's increase tells us the \ndirection of time. Nasty, isn't it? Suddenly there's no such thing as time, \nonly growing disorder. But, I've been thinking if this actually is the \ncorrect way to define time. Seems possible. Of course, I'm not that deep in \ntheoretical physics that my theory would have much weight in real \nphysicists' scales, but I find it logical, so there must be some logic at \nleast behind it.\n\nIf you wish to reach future faster, you need to find a way to slow down the \nincrease of entropy. For example, entropy doesn't increase inside the event \nhorizon of a black hole, because the entropy inside the black hole is the \ngreatest possible (may have been Michio Kaku, who wrote the book I found \nthis in, not 100% sure). That's why time doesn't flow inside the event \nhorizon. \n\nA bit off the case, but I think it might be a bit useful, when thinking \nabout time travelling, or should I say, when thinking about ways to \nmanipulate the flow of time. Always remember the difference between magical \n(dis)appearance and being actually observable all the time!\n\nDid I shed any light on the matter? Hard to tell, I don't always think in \nthe same way other people think. And I'm sometimes overly excited about \ndiscussing on interesting things.",

                    "text": "+Berelore No, it was not an April fools joke. If it was, it wouldn't be as \nexact as it was.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that after all the time I used writing that message you \nstill don't seem to understand that the problem is the incorrect usage of \nlanguage. There are two different cases, with a significant difference, \nphysically such a difference that they can't be thought of as parts of the \nsame thing. That's why there needs to be different names for the cases. \nAnd, as the connotation of \"time travel\" is the case where the traveler \ndoes not pass through each and every moment of time, this is what should, \nand if I may (I may, because I have done my studies on linguistic \nphilosophy), must be called \"time travel\".\n\nI can't see why you don't get the difference.\n\nCase 1. Traveler has passed through every moment of time. He has also been \nperceivable every damn second.\nCase 2. He has not passed through every moment, instead stepped over a \ncouple, and hasn't been perceivable all the time.\n\nIf anyone goes into the past, he is, by definition, a time traveler, \nbecause he can't have passed through every moment, as the time flows \ntowards the future, not towards the past.\n\nTrust me, this distinction between the two cases may seem insignificant, \nbut if you have studied physics, you should know that it is not. \n\nIf you have two lines, the first one 10 cm and the other one 20 cm, which \none has more individual points in it? The same goes with time. If you go \nfrom moment t1 to the moment t2, let's say that t2-t1 is 60 s (of the \nrelative time of the observer), and your own time has only moved 15 s, have \nyou had less individual moments? No. Please note that moment means a period \nof time which is infinitesimal.\n\nThe only difference is that the time of the object (referred to as \"you\") \nhas flown to the final moment with greater velocity (and again, I'm not \nmeaning velocity as v=s/t, but as relative velocity to the absolute \nspace-time, in this case that I explained, it was by definition the same as \nthe time of the observer). Is this what we think of as time travelling? \nWell, it is not. If this was time travelling, the whole point of the \ndiscussion becomes irrelevant, because then all existence would be time \ntravelling.\n\nOf course, this can't be the case. We don't travel through time, when we \nfollow its natural flow (which, by the way, is defined by the growth of \nentropy. This causes some very interesting discussions about the reasons \ntime slows down and stops inside the event horizon of a black hole, or when \ntravelling at the speed of light). The time flows on independent of our \nactions. We exist in the absolute space-time. \n\nThink about two boats that share the exact same velocity v=s/t. Their \ndistance from one another is x. The one closer to the shore is at the \ndistance x from the shore. You stand at a point A on the shore. The both \nboats approach you from right, going to the left from your point of view. \nYou measure a time t. In this period of time, the boat which is closer, \nappears to have covered a longer distance, of course. But, in fact, it has \ntraveled exactly the same distance as the boat which is further. \n\nPretty much the same way, if two objects have moved with different \nvelocities, they appear to have traveled different periods of time. But \nwhen observed from the absolute space-time (which is always defined by the \nobserver, but the main point of this is that the both objects have a clear \nrelation to this observer's absolute, such a relation that it can be \nabsolutely defined), they have covered equal distances in time. The other \none just has done it \"faster\". However, they have both been perceivable, so \nthey both must have remained within time, and the time has flown onward \nwithin both objects. Thus, no time travel has been detected.\n\nOf course, time travel as defined by connotation, must be physically \nimpossible. At least to the modern knowledge. It would disturb the \nstability of energy: energy can't cease to exist for a while, and then \nbegin to exist again. May be that future physics prove otherwise, but the \nmodern knowledge doesn't allow time travelling.\n\nMaybe I have gone to school enough. Even if I hadn't, I would have never \nstudied these things in school. You don't learn to know things, you must \nlearn to understand concepts. School is for knowledge, which is \ninsignificant. Time is a concept you have to handle with care and great \nphilosophical attitude. And you must be ready to give up your ideas that \nyou have heard from somewhere. We are talking about time travelling, and \nwhen we do that, we do not talk about natural time flow. Of course we \nalready know that time flows (of course, assuming that such a thing exists \nas an absolute). But the point is, as I have said many times, that we want \nto discuss whether a true time travel is possible. We waiting for tomorrow \nis not a satisfying answer to anyone.",

                    "text": "+Berelore In fact, I am making a definition between time traveling and time \nflow. Why? Because when we talk about time travelling, we indeed mean such \na case, where a person ends up in a moment of time without passing through \neach and every individual moment of time between the last and the first \nmoment.\n\nA definite difference between natural time flow and time travelling is \nneeded, because otherwise we couldn't have this discussion. Please note \nthat we do not travel through time, but we travel through space within \ntime. \n\nRelativity is unimportant here. I don't know if you really have read that \nmuch about the two theories of relativity, but they clearly state that high \nenergy density (or mass, of course) have the ability of bending the \nabsolute space-time. When travelling at near speed of light, the relative \ntime (relative to the outside world) slows down. However, the traveler \n(space traveler in this case) passes through each individual moment between \nthe moment he left and the moment he returned. The outside world has also \npassed through each individual moment between the moment the traveler left \nand the moment he returned.\n\nThey are at the moment of time, when the traveler returns, but a concept of \ntime travelling (instead of \"time traveling\" where time flows naturally on) \ndoes not apply here. When the traveler went off for his vacation, his time \nslowed down, because the absolute space-time was bent. This allowed him to \npass through less individual moments than those people on Earth to reach \nthe same resulting moment, to which I referred as t2. The time has flown \n\"less\", relatively to the Earth clock, but the traveler hasn't actually \ntime traveled. Instead, he simply reached the same moment of time faster \n(where faster doesn't mean velocity v=s/t, but instead a lay-person's idea, \nif he could perceive the moments from outside the absolute space-time. \nMeaning that if we could perceive it independent of time, we would see that \nthe traveler passes through moment faster than those people on Earth).\n\nI was trying to make great philosophical statement about time traveling, \nbecause that's exactly what makes us all interesting. Can we ever go back \nin time? Is there a way to go from this moment to the distant future? What \nyou did, was nothing but insulting my intelligence and knowledge and \nability to handle abstract concepts. And the way you did it was declaring \nthat such a concept is named wrongly. Let me tell you something.\n\nIt is indeed a different case to go from the moment of time t1 to the \nmoment of time t2 with passing through all the moments between t1 and t2, \nthan it is to appear from t1 to t2 without passing through any or some \nmoments between the two moments. Note that these moments are moments of the \nrelative time of the observer. The observer would, in the first case, be \nable to perceive the traveler all the time, in the latter case the observer \ncan't perceive the traveler all the time. The latter case is what is \ncommonly known as time travelling, and because the case is significantly \ndifferent from the first case, we should also use different names for them.\n\n Because there is a difference, we also need to make a difference in the \nway we talk about them, a difference in naming the concepts. This is \nexactly what I was doing, sharing my relatively great ability to handle big \nand abstract concepts, and I put my relatively high intelligence in use, so \nthat I could tell how the way we speak of things may be, or is, erroneous. \nWhat you did, was what I expected from an average person. You solved the \nproblem by denying its existence.\n\nLike I may have already mentioned, time travelling more commonly makes us \nthink about the latter case, where the time traveler ceases to exist for a \nmoment or moments. This video was to popularize the ideas and concepts of \ntime travel, and that's why I wanted to point out the significant \ndifference, which occurs between my two cases.\n\nThe problem of incorrect usage of the language, that's what this is about. \nReferring to both cases as time travelling will definitely make anyone, \nwho's not that deep in physics, to be confused.\n\nYou failed to understand that my point was to define time travelling so \nthat we could have a reasonable discussion about it using relevant points \nand arguments. We need exact usage of language. To say that we're all time \ntravelers is not exact usage of language, because we want to discuss the \nconcept which is most commonly referred to as time travel.",

Light is massless and like all massless things, it \ntravels at the speed of light.

But I think, it would not \naffect the rate you age. Taking into account what Jesse Heinonen said in \nthe comments from above posts about the difference between time flow and \ntime travel, you would still experience your time the same. You wouldn't be \nskipping through a series of moments but experiencing each and every single \nsecond, just in space. So say you travel one year out into space at the \nnear speed of light in a really resilient rocket ship and return back \nwithin the next year. You would have traveled 2years and thus be two years \nolder, and aged that much. BUT the time on earth would be approximately \n1500years into the future because the earth was barely crawling in relation \nto the speed you traveled. So that actually means you would have been \nexperiencing time flow (flowing through time/space which your body \nexperiences normally, just at the speed of light), not time travel. If you \nwere to REALLY time travel, it would have to happen whilst you're on earth, \nthat way you know you're working from one time frame (with you experiencing \ntime differently than everyone else around you who is ruled by the same \nlaws of physics). With you in space, its two different time frames because \nyou're travelling through space as a single entity and everyone else is on \nearth. So LITERAL time travel must mean skipping ahead of everyone else, if \nyou did THAT, then you wouldn't age much at all, since your atoms would be \ndisplaced from one time and location to another.\n\nI hope some of what I said made SOME sense, but I'm no physicist or an \nastrophysicists for that matter, I just have a keen interest in it, but I \nstudy Media & Culture :)",

I realize the scientific consensus says otherwise, but I \nstill have trouble accepting it. The idea that light could travel from some \ndistant source to Earth instantaneously, yet years would go by for those on \nEarth seems like magical thinking and an irrational explanation. How could \nsomething literally arrive here instantly yet us not know about it for \nyears to come? Clearly I'm still confused. But don't get me wrong, I \ncomprehend the explanation that you and many others have provided, but it's \nthat explanation that doesn't sit well with me. What seems logical in my \nhead is that IF light could reach us instantaneously from some distant \nsource, we would see it immediately because time is the ultimate unifier of \nall things, not something that is subjective.\n\nIf we're standing 100 feet apart and I point a laser in your eye, the time \nit takes for the light to reach your eye from where I'm standing is the \nsame for both you and I.

                    "text": "+Austin Geary There has been a lot of discussion about how motion must be \ndetermined. Relativity explains motion as relative motion to other objects. \nThis is of course a bit problematic, because we could always argue about \nthe relative directions. If you have water in a bucket, and you start \nspining the bucket, you'll see that:\n1. The bucket is still, and the water is still. Neither move relatively.\n2. The bucket starts spinning, but the water is still still. Now the bucket \nmoves relatively to the water.\n3. The water gains speed. Both the bucket and the water spin with the same \nspeed. Thus, they have no relative speed. The water's edge rises up, and \nthe middle of the surface goes lower. You know that.\n4.We start to slow down. The bucket is still, but the water spins. The \nbucket moves relatively to the water, and the water's edge is still higher \nthan the middle.\n5. Both stop, water surface normal, no relative speed.\n\nWhy does the water's surface change? It's not because of the movement, \nbecause the movement is relative. What if it's relative to Earth? Why would \nthe water care about the Earth? Not to mention that the Earth spins too, \nand it doesn't matter to which direction you spin the bucket, the result is \nthe exact same.\n\nThis is why we must define something as an absolute space (or absolute \nspace-time). This means that we can define specific points in the absolute \nspace-time, and movement is relative to these. This of course means that \nthe matter around these points doesn't matter. \n\nThe defined points in absolute space time are completely still. We could \ndefine the points so that the distance between each closest points is \nalways 1m. This means that their distance will always be 1m, regardless of \nwhat happens around them. They are not bound to London's map or anything \nelse.\n\nWhen the space enlarges, the distance of these points remains at 1m. This \nis because the metre itself becomes relatively longer. This is why we \nperceive the universe to enlarge. If we take to distant galaxies that have \nno absolute speed relative to one another. This means that they are both \nstill. Even so, we would still perceive the other galaxy as going away, \nbecause the space between the two galaxies expands. This means that the two \ngalaxies have relative speed, but would that mean that the other one's \nclock would run faster? No, because their absolute speed, their speed which \nis relative only to the absolute space-time, is the same, zero.",

As in, even though you're on a planet \nthat's spinning and in a galaxy that's spinning and moving through space, \nwe are STILL moving extremely slowly vs. the speed of light. So slowly, \nthat you're practically at a dead stop already. \n\nIf you were to add up the speeds we're travelling right now- (strictly for \nthis hypothetical scenario) we're still moving less than 3,000,000 miles \nper hour.  That's 3 X10^6, light is nearly 670 X10^6  If you have 670 and \nyou take away 3, you still have 667 X10^6 to go before you're traveling at \nthe speed of light.

At 3,000,000 miles per hour, we're still moving less \nthan 1/2 of 1% the speed of light, so 0.5% the speed of light, which is \nalmost 0.0%.

I do \nknow that people born will be healthier, and immune to almost everything \n(at a micro-level) that threatens humanity - but natural disasters and \nclimate change on the other hand may still be big (macro) issues if we \nhaven't destroyed  the natural earth already and turned it synthetic by \nthat time. Perhaps the question of consciousness would have been resolved \ntoo, with humans existing as thinking and feelings beings despite \ntechno-alterations of biology, neurologists might discover the mystery of \nconsciousness. With all that said, humanity might be SO intelligent in the \nfuture, I might be too stupid to even understand its intellectual \nadvancement. I wouldn't even be able to function in such a world, I'd be an \noutcast. This is also a very sad predicament.",

If they looked at things outside of their \nreference frame, they would see some sort of dilation effect, either \nspatial, temporal, or both (yes, not only does time distort but space \ndistorts as well, things get shorter along the direction of travel).  \nSimilarly, observers outside their frame of reference looking at them would \nsee dilation effects on them, usually the inverse of what the other would \nsee.\n\nFor instance, if you were traveling near the speed of light, everything \npassing by you would appear to smear out, and time outside of you would \nalso appear to be going much faster than it should be, though everything \nwould seem normal to you otherwise, whereas people looking at you from \noutside would see you squished up along the direction of travel and your \ntime would appear to be moving much slower to them.",

For example \"the clock in the \nspaceship ticks slower than the clock on earth as seen by the observers on \nearth\".\n\nAs such, it is not possible to see another clock ticking faster than you \nown (at least in special relativity), because movement is relative.\nEven though you might say, that the spaceship is moving away from earth it \nwould be equally true to say, that earth is moving away from the spaceship, \nmeaning, viewed from the spaceship, clocks on earth would tick slower than \nthose on the spaceship,\nwhile earthbound observers would see the clocks on the spaceship ticking \nslower than their own.\n\nI know, that this seems pretty impossible, especially since after the \nflight, you can still determine that less time passed inside of the \nhighspeed spaceship than on earth.\nIt is explainable though, if you look at it with the relativity of \nsimultaneity in mind,\nwhich is a different topic all on it's own.\n\nSeeing a clock speeding up in comparision to your own is an entirely \ndifferent thing though.\nIt is possible, if the relative speed between two observers gets smaller.\nIn that case, both observers see the clock of the other observer \"speed up\",\nuntil the point where the relative speed becomes zero and each observer\nsees the own clock tick at the same speed as the clock of the other \nobserver.\n\nAs you've probably gathered, all of this isn't that easy to understand, \nbecause most of it is pretty counterintuitive, so I've added a simplified \nto long didn't read:\n\nTL;DR:\nIt is not possible to see the clock of some one else tick slower than your \nown.\nIt is however possible to see the clock of some one else speed up in \ncomparision to your own, if he is slowing down.",
