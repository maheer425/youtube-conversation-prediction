All TV isn't cookie-cutter Hollywood bullshit. HBO and BBC \nhas both shown that, just to mention two.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, you'd be hard-pressed to make any sort of \nliving off of youtube unless you have some kind of unique talent. Saying \nthat anyone can do it, or rather that anyone can do anything and be \nsuccessful, is overstating it, by a pretty large margin. Even PewDiePie, \nwho at a cursory glance only seems to spend his videos screaming and having \ntourettes-fits in swedish at video games, has a certain je-ne-sais-quoi \nthat many a rage-gamer have tried to replicate, and mostly failed \nmiserably, while he rakes in the views by the boatload. You need talent and \nabove that commitment to succeed at anything.\n\nAdditionally, I'd argue that comparing TV and Youtube is comparing apples \nand oranges. They are completely different beasts, in short. I suppose you \ncould compare youtube to news programming, talk shows and the lot, but I \ndon't expect that we'll see big budget dramas produced primarily for \nyoutube for a very long time. That's just not what youtube is about.",
