                "text": "You barely touch on just how cruel and insensitive peers, especially \nteenagers, can be about affecting someone's body image.  The one seemingly \n\"free shot\" left in society that is open persecution and stereotyping is of \npeople who are overweight and/or not \"ripped\" by the time they are 16; and \nno group more heartless and wantonly open about expressing themselves about \nit (often for the seemingly sheer joy of inflicting mental harm on others \nweaker than themselves) than adolescents.  Worse this behavior often gets \ndismissed, or treated as \"entertainment\" by their adult teachers, peers, \nand observers.  Bombarded with feelings of guilt at being not only out of \nshape but being considered \"lazy, selfish, or dumb (thanks, media \nstereotypes)--sometimes even by their own parents or relatives--doesn't \nhelp either.  Real biological or psychological issues are often dismissed \nas \"excuses\", which can lead to further suffering and just \"giving up\" and \nbecoming a bitter recluse--even after the weight is lost.  The \nbitterness and mental scars that take years to heal--if ever.  Just even \ncalling attention to it or cries for help invite rebukes (\"Stop whining and \ndo some cardio!)\". I suppose along with \"herd mentality\" there's a \n\"culling-the-herd\" mentality in society today.\ufeff",

You sort of \nlearn with his parents and also learn about how some great specialist \nteachers can get the best out of autistic kids. I think it's made for \nmothers who have autistic children so they can relate and learn, but it's \nactually quite fun to read because you become invested in the boy \nsucceeding and it starts to make you upset when people misjudge him because \nof ignorance about his disorder and it's very informative.",

Let me first disclose that I am not in *any* way belittling \nyour experience or minimizing what you are going through when I point out \nthat *some* of what you might be perceiving is not actually occurring. A \nfacet of BDD is misinterpreting the actions of others as being directed at \nthe person in relation to what they are fixating on. It starts out as a \nvery human trait in that when we feel self conscious about something, we \nbelieve everyone else notices, when they rarely do, such as having a bad \nhair day--we think everyone else is aware of it, but in actuality, very few \nare; most are preoccupied with their own thoughts and perceived problems. \nBy the way, I am in no way trying to equate what you are going through as \nbeing the same as having a bad hair day, but rather pointing out an \nobserved phenomenon of psychology.\n\nGoing to a therapist can help with sifting through what is actually \noccuring and what is perceived, as well as learning coping skills and ways \nto manage situations where someone is genuinely persecuting you based on a \nphysical handicap (such as when police stop you).\n\nAnyway, long message cut short, find a good therapist who can help you, \nlook into support groups out there for people in similar circumstances, and \ngood luck to you. It's tough, but you can overcome it. ;) I hope I managed \nnot to come off as offensive, but it can be difficult to convey what you \nintend over text and without the context of body language and tone.

It's one of those things that you never hear about, \nbut only hearing the version of anorexia that requires one to be 15% \nunderweight can make people suffering from EDNOS feel that they are \"not \nsick enough\" to recover (believe me, I've been there). I suffered from \nEDNOS with anorexic tendencies (basically with the same tendencies as an \nanorexic person and the same effects aside from being \"sufficiently\" \nunderweight) and BDD for almost 2 years (still not entirely recovered) and \nI know one of the major factors that kept me from admitting that something \nwas wrong was that I didn't fit the anorexic mold. There are so many \nmisconceptions about restrictive eating disorders (particularly the weight \nrange associated with them) and it would be very helpful if you could maybe \nexplain a bit about EDNOS in a future video.\ufeff",

I've been struggling with my own eating issues \nfor over a year now (my counsellor seemed iffy about me calling it an \neating disorder but told me not to get hung up on labels), which mostly \nstarted off as what they now call orthorexia, an obsession with eating \nhealthily. I had cut so many things out of my diet and branded them as evil \nthat I was so stressed every time I had to think about eating because there \nwas barely anything left that was 'good.' After inevitably breaking some of \nmy myriad rules I more recently have been struggling with episodes of binge \neating. However, I never would have thought that my eating habits were \ndisordered because they didn't fit into 'anorexia, bulimia or binge \neating,' which is what I learned in school. I was so convinced, like you, \nAmy, that I would never have an eating disorder because 'I love food' and \n'I know not eating is bad' that I completely overlooked it when I first got \ninto a really unhealthy cycle.\nI know this is a very difficult subject to cover, especially in one video, \nbut I would have appreciated just mentioning that eating disorders/issues \ndon't fit into these three boxes and to just touch on EDNOS.

You realize a big population of bigger people are that way \nbecause of some sign of a mental illness like major depression. Back in the \nday being fat was a sign or being wealthy.

Fat shaming and fat acceptance are for the most a societal thing, so you \ncannot customize it to every individual, and positive reinforcement affects \nmore people and effects better on those it affects.\n2. Yes it does, if you are just gonna try to refute very blatant and \nobvious points to support your hypothesis you better fucking explain in \ndetail why and bring some god damn evidence to support you.\n3. Wow, fucking hell, you seriously do not know any of the dozens of \nstudies on the mental health effects of fat shaming? I even linked to one \nof the many on this very comment thread.\n4. Actually, you are wrong, the massive rise in gym culture came with the \ndecline of hard working jobs that made the demand for exercise increase, \nfat shaming existed before the huge rise of gym culture and gym culture \ncame to fill in the fact that people were not using up as much of their \nenergy in their jobs making them want a way to keep themselves in shape. \nYou should be careful about these kind of things because you are very \nclearly suffering from confirmation bias.\n\n\"You haven't provided evidence to counter my point.

I have brought studies that support my argument \nand even under the best interpretation for your hypothesis show no support \nfor it, and seriously, accusing me of strawmanning after you having said \nthat most fat people are lazy, all of them are ugly, that people who find \nfat people beautiful are all fetishists (hell, for someone that apparently \nhas watched crashcourse psychology you seem to be very willing to abuse the \nword fetish despite the information crashcourse provided on a different \nvideo on crashcourse psychology) and that people who advocate for fat \nacceptance call for censorship and hatred for artistic expression and \nmodern beauty standards. All while you yourself are basing everything on a \nhypothesis against evidence and the closest you could find a source to \nsupport you is outdated and was on a completely different subject matter.

There is a requirement of refusal to maintain a normal body weight, \nbut the 85% number is no longer considered in diagnosis.  And, people who \nare at a normal weight or even overweight can refuse to maintain a normal \nbody weight - it's all about the goal (which, in the case of restrictive \ndisorders generally gets lower and lower as time goes on) and how they get \nto it (unhealthy behaviors being key).\n\nI have been \"overweight\" on the BMI scale for the majority of my eating \nissues, but have all behaviors of an anorexic.  Technically, under the old \nguidelines, that put me in the category of EDNOS, and, even if I had \nreached my goal weight, I would have never been considered anorexic because \nmy goal wasn't 85% of a normal BMI. This doesn't really make sense if it's \nconsidered a mental illness. The mindset is the same whether you're \ncurrently underweight or not, and those who aren't underweight are actually \nin more danger than those who are because their disorders are more likely \nto go undetected and therefore untreated.\n\nI know I was just commended for my weight loss. No one questioned how I did \nit or why I was exercising 2+ hours a day or why I suddenly fainted after \ngiving blood when I had NEVER fainted after giving blood before or how I \nlost 10+lbs over Christmas break (3 weeks). It was just good that I'd lost \nweight because I was considered overweight at the start of all of it. \n That's the danger. I was still starving my body, I was still causing \ndamage to my metabolism, my hair, my nails, my everything, but because I \nwasn't underweight, there was no issue.\n\nI am still appalled that there was no mention of EDNOS or of the damage \nthat a restrictive ED can have on someone who is of a normal or heavy \nweight.  There are severe repercussions, and these types are particularly \ndangerous because of the lack of attention they receive. Quite frankly, I'm \npretty disappointed, especially considering how insightful and thorough \nHank and the others behind Crash Course generally are.",

The \nclassic and most recognizable symptoms are binge eating and forced \nvomiting. Eating one large meal a day is not healthy (I shoot for four \nsmaller meals a day), but if you do not do any of the things above you are \nmost likely not suffering bulimia nervosa. I would talk to a doctor or \ndietician about that one meal a day thing though, or if you want more \ninformation on bulimia nervosa (and if you're at high risk of developing \nit).",

My \ngreat-grandmother definitely suffered from the effects of pathological \ndieting, my grandmother with binge eating and fasting periods, and my \nmother accepted treatment for anorexia nervosa at ripe age of 19, just \nbefore she had me. :)  I personally had some problems with BED (Binge \nEating Disorder) - a disorder in which a person overeats to suppress \nfeelings of being overwhelmed and increase feelings of control and comfort. \nMy family poked fun at me for a long time (since I was 11). When I visited \nmy great-grandmother, she put me on diets. The most memorable visit being \nthe \"Great Tuna Fish Visit\", a month long visit of nothing but tuna out of \na can. My family stopped giving me clothing as presents (before I \ngraduated), but instead gym memberships and even a set of weights. I'm \n5'4\", and 230 pounds but I don't look like 230 lbs. I eat a balanced diet, \nwatch my sodium/vitamin/essential amino acid intake, exercise, and rest \nappropriately and am still 230 lbs. Personally, I am working towards being \nable to run an 8 minute mile, but that's a goal. Here's what I want you to \nknow: If you are happy in your own skin and are not suffering life \nthreatening effects of obesity, don't let anyone look down on you. It's \njust misguided nonsense.

I've read of a substance produced in the brain called \n\"Leptin\" that scientsts are studying.
