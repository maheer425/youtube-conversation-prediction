JESUS explicitly stated what marriage \nis; His words not mine.\nOnly a Man and a Woman can be joined together and reproduce just as GOD \njoined Adam & Eve and blessed saying, \"be fruitful and multiply.\"\n\nNow, if you don't want to believe JESUS definition of marriage then you \nshould read further in the New Testament about the sin of homosexuality. \n\n\"Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them, which like them \ncommitted sexual sins and pursued homosexual activities, serve as an \nexample of the punishment of eternal fire.\" This is why GOD rained fire and \nbrimstone on these cities to tell the world that this Sin leads to eternal \ndamnation. Jude 1:7\n\n\"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? \nDo not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor \neffeminate, nor Homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, \nnor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.\" 1 \nCorinthians 6:9-10\n\nI love everyone, including gays, that's why I'm showing scriptures where \nGOD condemns this type of sin among others, so they can Repent, turn away \nfrom their sins to JESUS CHRIST so they can inherit eternal life.",

And Jesus said unto her, neither do I condemn you: \nGO, AND SIN NO MORE !\n\nJesus healed a man from 38 years of infirmity \n\nJohn 5:14 Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, \nyou are made whole: SIN NO MORE UNLESS A WORSE THING COME UPON YOU\n\nYou see, the \"love\" of Jesus has got nothing to do with embracing sins and \nHis forgiveness is about forgiving sin that is going to stop, not forgiving \nsin that is to continue.\n\nSo is homosexuality a sin that Jesus would say \"DO NO MORE\"? bearing in \nmind that many sins were declared outside of Jesus' own words.\n\nThe new testament speaks against the practice of homosexuality even more \nthan the old testament ie\nRomans 1:27\n1st Corinthians 6:9\n(just read these scriptures yourself and see their true meaning)\n\nJesus' comments seem to be the only ones that people care about today so \nlets read some things He said ....\n\nMatthew 7:21  Not everyone who says to Me, Lord! Lord! shall enter the \nkingdom of Heaven, but only they who do the will of My Father in Heaven.\n(anyone sinning does not qualify)\n\nMatthew 7:13  Go in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad \nis the way that leads to destruction, and MANY there are who go in through \nit.\n(the vast majority of folks are going to be condemned)\n\nMatthew 7:14  Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way which \nleads to eternal life, and there are FEW who find it.\n(only a few people are actually going to eternal life)\n\nSeems to me that to only follow what Jesus said is actually more difficult \nthan other scriptures.",

I feel that \nhumanity can one day achieve as much as possible through science and obtain \nenough knowledge to find evidence of a sentient Creator, if there is one, \nbut we don't yet have that capability. The Deist claim that humans can, \nthrough reasoning with what we know now, conclude that God is real just \nseems very arrogant to me. My belief is based on an assumption that knows \nit's an assumption so as not to lord it over people (something even other \nDeists can be guilty of.) It's up to humanity to advance enough to find the \ntruth for itself, and not just assume while making rulesets based on that \nassumption to merely \"leave it at that.\" And where ever that evidence \npoints at any given time, no matter what, we keep going without trying to \ncherry pick, shirk responsibilities, tamper, or falsely conclude. People \nwho believe can be driven to figure it out for themselves, and while we do \nthat, the other advancements along the way will aid humanity in other areas \nof life.\n\nIn that way, I feel the belief in God and the lack of belief in God can \nco-exist until the truth, whatever it is, becomes known. Until then, and \nprobably even afterwards, Deism and Atheism won't have theocratic rules, \nwhich I find nice.\n\nAnd if Theism proves correct, whichever religion it is, hey, at least we \nfigured it out for ourselves. Hopefully, good people will be just fine no \nmatter who winds up being right. And hopefully it's never too late to \nredeem oneself.\n\n(The two major problems I have with Abrahamic religious beliefs as of right \nnow, incidentally. If I were ever a Christian, I'd probably be very \nJeffersonian about it.)",

The truth is I never believed in \ngod, because I always knew there was no reason to believe. The reason I do \nnot believe in god (or any god or deity) is because I am a logical, \nreasonable, skeptically minded person who asks for proof, not fairy tales \nhanded down from the dark ages.

The \nBible has the answer in Genesis 19:24: \n\u201cThen Yahweh rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, \nfrom Yahweh out of the heavens.\u201d \n The Bible clearly informs us that the source of this brimstone \nhad supernaturally came from Yahweh God out of the heavens. \nArchaeologists have easily pulled out sulphuric balls out of the ruins \nof limestone buildings of the city of Gomorrah. Amazingly, there are \nno other ancient ruined cities anywhere else on planet earth covered \nwith pure sulphuric balls with its ruins turned into ash. \n Sodom and Gomorrah are unlike any other ancient cities of \nantiquity that have been destroyed by fire or volcanoes. Modern \nexcavations of the Roman city of Pompeii found a layer of volcanic \nash on top of the limestone structures but the original stone \nbuildings were not also turned into ash. In contradistinction, \narchaeologists have found that the entire limestone cities of Sodom \nand Gomorrah had been turned into ash through millions of highly \nconcentrated sulphuric balls. The evidence proves that the actual \ncity structures of Sodom and Gomorrah were turned into ash just \nlike the Bible says: \n\u201cAnd turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, \ncondemned them to destruction, making them an example to those \nwho afterward would live ungodly.\u201d 2 Peter 2:6 \n When limestone rock turns into ash there must be very intense \nheat.
