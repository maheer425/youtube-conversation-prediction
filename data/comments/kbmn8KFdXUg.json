Anyways \nthat case was obviously stupid and she didn't have much right to sue those \ngirls but their parents should be expected to pay for medical bills (if \nany) the fact that she had medical bills obviously indicates the damage \nthat can be done. The whole case sounds like a smear on disabled people \nthey aren't \"sensitive\" or any of that shit they cannot help it and it \nalmost always has to do with ptsd and is actually fairly common. No one \nmakes fun of war veterans startled by construction noises because they \nresemble war sounds, the same thing applies to everyone else. Just because \nknocking on doors is common doesn't mean it's any less startling they \nweren't anticipating it and they did not put themself in the hospital. \n\nNot saying you should stop knocking on doors, just be careful and don't \npurposefully knock as hard as you possibly can. And even after taking \ncountermeasures to help people with ptsd be sympathetic and offer to help \nif they still have a panic attack.",

                    "text": "+Christian Ponicki Ok, now you're just sounding like an anarchist wingnut. \nWho stops government from going to far is the people - hence the existence \nof the Second Amendment. At least that's the idea in theory. Logic tells \nnearly anyone that some kind of government needs to be in place or \ncorporations and drug cartels simply run the country complete rather than \npartially as they do now. The inherent problem with trying to control \nthings ethically is that ethics vary from person to person. The entire \nreason why we have a free society is to allow for various beliefs without \ndiscrimination. The only real limitations being the law. How you justify \ngovernment morally is simply looking at societies where it's virtually \nnonexistent - such as pretty much the entirety of South Africa. AIDS \nrunning amuck, insane levels of violence, no accountability for actions at \nall. As for every leader being a power-hungry monster, how do you figure \nthat? Many have been, yes, we can agree on that. But I haven't seen too \nmany historians not have high levels of respect for Teddy Roosevelt and \nReagan. Did they make mistakes and do some things that people didn't like - \nabsolutely. Name a leader of literally anything that hasn't made decisions \nyou didn't like and I'll be surprised. The system rotting since it was \nconceived is an absurd idea. Considering the fact that it worked pretty \nwell for us until about the past 50 years says otherwise. We had top-level \nmanufacturing plants, the standard of living for the middle class was \ngreat, and we generally kept out of world affairs unless we saw problems \nthat we knew would later impact us. An entirely free market society would \nhave all kinds of payoffs and corruption as well - and you would likely see \nthe same exportation of manufacturing and other jobs to China that you see \nnow. Because it's still all driven by money. If you have a perfect solution \nto all of this, please, fix these issues in government and prove us all \nwrong. Otherwise, I see no point in continuing this conversation. ",

                    "text": "+Christian Ponicki The thing is, government can work in people's favor as \nwell as against them. I've never seen evidence that the existence of a \ngovernment - not necessarily the one we have, is inherently a bad idea. \nWhat it boils down to is accountability. Accountability for the actions of \none party that can be detrimental to another. I don't mean in terms of big \nbusinesses, because intense competition in business is a good thing short \nof corporate espionage. But it basically keeps people and businesses alike \nfrom going too far and sets boundaries that allow a society to avoid total \ncollapse and give it order. Ideally in a free society, you have government \nbeing split into 3 separate houses as we have here, where they watch one \nanother's actions closely and to some degree work against one another. This \nis supposed to ensure that power is never given 100% to any one party and \nthus this system of \"checks and balances\" provides a barrier of safety \nagainst tyrannical government. The problem that I see is that in the 300 \nyears politicians have had to study, alter, and misconstrue the law, \nthey're following it to the letter but not the spirit. I think that's why \nyou see all the absurdly restrictive laws and strange loophole usages that \nare all over the news today. Politicians have figured out that mudslinging \nand backdoor deals are much easier than bothering going through the proper \nchannels. The system we're under definitely needs an overhaul, but I don't \nthink it's a complete loss. What needs to be restored is the integrity and \nlack of bias in government, not necessarily the system itself. Which in \nthis era where it's perfectly acceptable to become famous for scandals, is \nmuch easier said than done. Personally, I want to see America grow a \nbackbone again and thrive on integrity and hard work as it did in \ngenerations past. My sincere hope is that people in this country will wise \nup and want something similar. ",

How they \nall seem to believe they're entitled to the earth, moon, and stars \nthemselves, like they are gods among peasants and anything they wish is \nlegally required to be so.  These kinds of women constantly threaten and \nextort money with their bullshit, and it's never enough.  They demand \nrefunds on products for insane reasons like \"the blue isn't blueish blue \nenough to be TRUE blue, and is only part blueish blue\" or \"I thought it \nwould be different from it's picture.  You lied to me since it was too much \nlike what it looked like in the picture\".\n\nWhat possible \"medical bills\" could arise from someone ringing your \ndoorbell?  Did she suffer from a sudden attack of \"bellitus\"?  I'm betting \nshe saw the teenage girls, was jealous of their youth/looks, and decided to \ndo what these kind of women do best:  fuck with people who don't deserve \nit.  I guess she got tired of going to restaurants, making a poor server's \nlife miserable, then demanding free food from the manager from some made up \nbullshit reason.\ufeff",
