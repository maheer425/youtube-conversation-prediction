On the bottom of the \ntank you can put newspaper or aspen shreddings. The snake will need a water \nbowl for bathing in (this helps when they're shedding and to keep them \nclean) and at least one hide. Snakes normally need to be fed every \ntwo-three days, with a dead mouse about as wide as the widest part of the \nsnakes head (they are normally sold frozen, but make sure you defrost it \nfirst!). Its usually recommended to feed the snake in a tank separate to \nits home, and offer the mouse head first on tweezers. Stressy snakes may \nregurgitate their food, so leave them in the tank for about half an hour to \nallow digestion, and keep handling brief until it's had time to settle. \nGrass snakes dont really need much in the way of extra heat, but you should \nkeep the snake in a warm room away from any vibrations that could stress it \nout; such as the TV or Radio.\nA quick google search should give you any more info you need. Hope that \nhelps :)",
