Anime is specifically referenced to Japanese Anime. \nAnime is an animated cartoon art style, not solely a production style. \nAnime originated through Japanese animation techniques which birthed life \ninto their pencil drawn comics and cartoons through similar traditional \nmethods.\n\nWhen referring to something such as Wreck-it-Ralph, or Finding Nemo, we are \nno longer talking about traditional animation methods. A team of \ncartoonists did not sit together to have a flip-book of pencil'd stills \ncreate animation. Pixar films have given new use to already existing \ntechnology with computer graphics and animating apertures. What the \naforementioned films are now are products of CGI. Computer-Generated \nImagery. 3D modeling and motion capturing are just some of the things used \nto make films like Finding Nemo.\n\nAnime on the other hand still uses traditional methods starting from pencil \nand paper, even if it is now more often used in combination with new \nmethods such as 3D modeling and motion capturing.
