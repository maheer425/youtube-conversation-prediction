Dude started for NOTHING and look at him now. \nThen you have Luan,Rodrigo TX and buuuunch of other amazing skateboarder. \nThen you have Anderson Silva,one of the best if not the best MMA fighter of \nall times. Then you come to basketball and you find Oscar Schmidt who is \nthe greatest scorer in the international basketball and there is no doubt \nin my mind that he would be a NBA legend if he ever had a chance to come \nover. Just take a look what he does to USA team in the Olyimps. Around 50 \npoints. We don't even have to talk about football ( soccer ). Those are \nthings I'm interested in and every time there is some crazy guy from \nbrasil.\ufeff",
