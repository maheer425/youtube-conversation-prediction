                "text": "Alright, I'll admit it now. I have no concept of God. I readily replace his \nname with hope or magik (that's the real kind, not magical allusions). I \nhaven't read the bible, but I've brushed up on some stories, and have been \npreached to. I just can't get behind it. When I hear a great message like \nthis in a video, I internalize. \"Tough it out,\" has been a motto for a long \ntime. How does the whole Christian community know that there is such a \nthing as Christ? I feel like the higher being will all talk and think about \nis something people made up. Maybe I'm confused or the \"enemy,\" beckons me \nto believe that there isn't a God. I have an idea of why we are here, but \nmost people would think I'm crazy if I said anything about what makes sense \nto me. Who knows how many people I already lost because I said magik..\nI'm searching for answers and anyone who would grace me with a reply would \nbe appreciated.\nOh and for what it is worth I enjoy your videos.\ufeff",

You see, as you said \nyou have read the bible, the old testament prophecises many things. \nIncluding Jesus's birth (Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6) and his crucifixion (Psalms \n22: 16-18). The old testament for told a messiah that would heal the blind, \nmake the lame walk, cured people with Leprosy, gave the deaf hearing, and \nraised people from the dead! All things that were done in front of \nTHOUSANDS of people. But there is also scientific proof (honestly there is \nso much I'll just give you a link\n\n\n\nHow on earth could someone make all this up?\n\nI really hope this helps you and answers your questions \nOh and never \"tough it out\"! You never know when your last day is\n\nAny more questions feel free to message me!!",

                    "text": "Jacob, we believe in Jesus because of the prophets and the apostles.\n\nThe prophets foretold dozens of conditions that the Christ must meet in \norder to be the Christ. These prophecies were written years, sometimes \nhundreds of years, before Jesus walked the earth. Statistically, it would \nbe impossible for any one man to fulfill them all - but Jesus did. \n\nThe apostles were the men Jesus appointed to carry on His mission after He \nwent to heaven. The apostles gave their lives to fulfilling this mission \nand to training other men to do the same. The government didn't like what \nthe apostles were doing - they saw it as a threat to their power. When the \napostles wouldn't stop they started killing them. In many cases, all the \napostles had to do was just admit that they hadn't seen Jesus alive after \nHe was crucified. If they would do that they could live. NOT ONE DID. They \nall held true, to the point of death, that Jesus had risen. Why would they \ndo that unless the believed it? Why would they believe it unless they had \nseen it?\n\nThese are two of the main reasons. There are a lot more. A really helpful \nresource is \"The Case for Christ\" by Lee Stroble. I found this video \nonline. Not the best quality, but it gets it done. Take a look! \nhttp://vimeo.com/17960119\n\nHope you find what you are looking for! I found it... in Jesus.",

                    "text": "+Jacob Nelson  Dude its crazy, the whole concept of God and Christianity is \npretty much absurd but the crazy thing is that whats makes it even \nstronger. The Bible in itself is the oldest and best selling religious book \nof all time and yet throughout the ages they have tried to destroy it. This \nis what I have found to be true with most religions, the main teaching is \nthat you can do it, you can make it you have the power but with \nChristianity it's all about He (God) can do it, with Him nothing is \nimpossible. The religion is solely based/dependent on a higher power. Now \nto answer your question on how to really see if this God is real or why \nthis one, does he love me, is the creation story true... all I can say is \nthere is no possible way I can explain it to you or tell you about it that \nwill make you fully fathom it. At least that was the case for me. It is \nwhen you experience Him that you realize that God is there. So I want to \ngive you a challenge (thats if you up for it) just take this month and try \nHim, ask Him to reveal himself to you, pretty much be (don't act like) a \nchristian for a month. By the end of the month if He does not show himself \nto you then all your skepticism is true, there is no God/Christian God.\nHe says it in the bible, \"...test me...\" Malachi 3:10.",

                    "text": "+WatchLearnSee Hey there ;). I'm truly sorry that this is how you perceive \nChristianity, and I'll do my best to respond honestly, and the best in my \nability. Now, regarding the Inquisition, and the European Christians \ninvading early America and Africa (after a few minutes of Google \nsearching), I have my doubts that they were even Christians to begin with, \njust misguided people following the orders of a power-hungry person, \nthinking he is doing them a favour by forcefully converting them.. but \nChristianity is not, and never will be that way.. true Christianity is a \nrelationship with a God who chose to rescue those who would just reach out \nand believe in the Son that he sent, Jesus Christ.\n\nGod made man perfect.. in the beginning, Adam and Eve were perfect in every \nway, without blemish, without sin.. we were created to be in a relationship \nwith God until an act of disobedience and selfishness created a gap between \nGod and man that man can't possibly cross unless God himself came to \nintervene.. Because of mankind's act of selfishness many years ago, sin \nentered the world. Everything \"good\" that God created in the world, and \nus.. got twisted in every way possible, and because of this, we separated \nourselves from God. It's true that God is good.. God is love, God is \nmerciful. They're all true.. but God is also just, and justice demands that \nwe be punished for our sins, and that punishment is eternally separated \nfrom him in hell. Is it good for a lawbreaker to get away with his crimes? \nIf God just did that, then he's not just, and if he's not just, he's not \ngood. Since the beginning, the penalty of sin is death.. meaning someone \nneeds to die in order to pay for that sin, a penalty that Jesus himself \ntook upon himself so that ANYONE that believes and receives him, doesn't \nhave to pay for his own sins, but instead experience eternal life.\n\nSo I call myself a Christian not because I'm afraid, but because God in his \namazing grace brought me out of death, and into life. He has 'saved' me, \nand all the more gladly I'll call him my God for that. But does that mean I \nwon't make mistakes? No.. I can, and I will, sometimes horribly... but I \nknow that God is faithful even when we are faithless.\n\nNow regarding your two questions, what do you mean by improving one's self? \nJesus once asked people to follow him, even through dark days, and even \nthrough bright days, and I will. Sometimes God will make people go through \ndark days so they will realize of how hopeless they are without him, and \nthat's not cruel.. it's a loving discipline for his child. Sometimes it is \nbetter to suffer affliction than to enjoy the bittersweet pleasures of sin, \nand I choose to praise God in stormy days.\n\nSo, how do I know that God exists? The evidence is all around us.. how \nhorribly barren would the world be.. without bees? Or even better.. what \nabout us? The human brain, producing millions of signals every second, and \nthe amazing complexity of this world, one thing is removed from it, and it \nall falls apart.\n\nAnyway, I was rambling for a while there, so I hope that this will give you \na little more insight to what Christianity really is.\n\nIn a nutshell, Christianity is a relationship with the creator, who wanted \nto reach out to the people, and save anyone who believes in Him.\n\nKind regards,\n-Arn",

Because my father is a lawyer for the state and you have no idea \nhow many child molesters say \"You know... I gave her the freedom to say \n'no'\". And if the child said no they would beat her half to death. Like \nyour \"god\". \n\nAnd I have no respect for your believes since you have shown you have no \nrespect for mine either. Your god is a exactly like a child molester or \nwoman-beater. Have you even read the Bible?\n\n\"people like you atheists killed Christians for their beliefs\".\nLOL read a book. Does Inquisition tell you something? What about European \nChristians invading America and Africa in the 1400-500s to convert people \nusing force? It was actually the other way around since the beginning. \nChristians have been killing people for ages so that they could spread \ntheir believes.\nLike their god, the only way most Christians  work, is by force, insults, \ncriticism, and selfishness. Because, as you are showing, they lack in \neducation.\n\nDo you know why you call yourself a Christian? You call yourself a \nChristian because you are afraid. You are afraid that there is nothing else \nbeyond this life and that your life here is useless. You are afraid because \nyou are leaving nothing behind and you so you hope there is something else \nafter this. How right am I?\n\nWell then, 2 questions:\n1. Why don't you focus on improving yourself and doing something useful \ninstead of living your life for a child-molester-like god who may not even \nexist and who loves to kill and torture people?\n2. What tells you that your god is the real one, and that when you die you \nwill not meet any of the others 1000+ gods out there?",

I've found the only way to be close to him is to love him \nand others, or as you put it live for him.\n\nSure, at first living for yourself sounds good.

So a lot of times I \nchoose to do things that are bad for me. I'm not the only one either, if I \nwas there would probably be less addiction, wars, and crime in general.

I hold hope that one day everyone  on earth \nfinds out exactly what the truth really is on this, most important subject, \ni mean without dieing first.\nand mostly i hope that the optimistic faithful are in fact right in their \nbelief, that there is a god who truely loves his creations and wants what \nis best for us and that there truly is a great plan that brings justice to \nthe needy and forgivness to the sinners of the world.\n \nbe well.\ufeff",

Let me share this verse, from James 1:2-4  \"Consider it pure \njoy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3 \nbecause you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 4 \nLet perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, \nnot lacking anything. 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who \ngives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. \n6 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who \ndoubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.\"\n\nalso regarding your question about doing and following the commandments, \nhere's a verse:\n\"Ephesians 2:8-9\n8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not \nfrom yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 9 not by works, so that no one can \nboast.\"\n\nTake care always and Stay strong... I hope, somehow, I swept some \nconfusion..  I'm sorry if you find it to be worthless.. I don't have all \nthe answers to your questions.. but I'm hoping that my God, whom i placed \nmy life and faith, will help you find those. ",

Maybe the answer was there long ago but \nyou're still looking for a different answer.\nKeep an open mind and an open heart.\nI dont pretend to know of your suffering cause I dont, But I hope one day \nyou will find the answer and I hope it will compensate for all the pain.\nHang in there!!

You need more than following the commendments to please \nGod. God does trully love you, and he is pleased with how you follow his \nrules, but God wants you to communicate with him. Prey all the time. I \nlearned that as I preyed, it would be easier day by day to understand my \nlife and why things fall to certain pieces. At night when you're alone, \ntalk to God. He does everything for a purpose. Once, I preyed God to \nprotect me from fainting because I'm afraid of becoming unhealthy since I \nget full easilly and cannot eat alot. The next morning I fainted and threw \nup with an empty stomach and the emergency had to bring me to the hospital. \nI was angry at God that morning because I thought that he purposely was \npunishing me, but at the end I realized that if I didn't end up going to \nthe hospital, I wouldn't have been subrcibed to get Iron pills or multiple \nvitomin pills. If I wasn't taking these pills by now, I would still feel \nvery tired and look unhealthy and these pills are helping my body and \nhelping me become stronger. What I am trying to say is that you need to \ntalk to God All the time and observe the world. You need to silence the \nworld and listen to him. Pay close attention to God because he loves to \ncommunicate with everyone because he loves us all. And once you do that, \nyou'll understand why things are a certain way in your life. My grandma \nalso passed away because of cancer. She was so sick that the doctors had to \ngive her drugs so she could pass away more easilly. I know how it feels to \nlose people you love out of death. That's what I feared the most. But I \nsoon came to terms that perhaps it's because God has bigger plans for them. \nPerhaps it's their time to see something bigger and more beautiful than the \nplace we live in. Talk to God every night and prey. You'll seek the answers \nyou're looking for :)",
