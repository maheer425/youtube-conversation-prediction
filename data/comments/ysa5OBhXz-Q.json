It's a \nreally good video, to be sure, and top-down cascades are really important, \nbut keep in mind that no environment is a perfect balance - there is a \nconstant struggle between all species to increase their population as much \nas possible and wolves are no exception. This has the potential to become a \nproblem because between the wolves in the park and the hunters outside of \nthe park, the elk population in and around Yellowstone has been reduced to \nabout only 8,000. Before you jump on hunters for wanting to hunt the elk \ntoo, keep in mind that a lot of these conservation programs are funded BY \nhunters and fishermen. We wouldn't have the money for these programs \nwithout the hunters through hunting leases and permits, as well as taxes on \nhunting equipment.\ufeff",

The effects \ndepend on a complex of factors including elk densities, abundance of other \npredators, presence of alternative ungulate prey, winter severity, \nand\u2014outside the park\u2014land ownership, human harvest, livestock depredations, \nand humancaused wolf deaths. A coalition of natural resource professionals \nand scientists representing federal and state agencies, conservation \norganizations and foundations, academia, and land owners are collaborating \non a comparative research program involving three additional wolf-ungulate \nsystems in the western portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. \nResults to date indicate the effects of wolf predation on elk population \ndynamics range from substantial to quite modest.\"   I can tell you that I \nlive and spend a great deal of time outdoors in both Idaho and Washington \nwhere wolves have repopulated.  Since wolf reintroduction, I have seen a \nrapid decline in the number of animals seen (mostly in Idaho, but now \nstarting in Washington), as well as sign of their presence, but have \ncertainly seen an increase in wolf sign and sightings.  I have also spent a \ngreat deal of time in Yellowstone, both during the time of large elk herds \nand since wolf reintroduction.  I don't need an article to tell me that the \nherds of elk had high numbers because they were not hunted (that is common \nsense). I also didn't need an article to tell me that high numbers of \nungulates, whether deer, elk, bison, antelope, moose, or whatever are going \nto eat down the vegetation.  In the areas outside of national parks, I have \nnever seen areas that have been so overpopulated by ungulates that they \novergrazed or overbrowsed the vegetation.  That is in large part because \nhunting helped keep populations under control.  It shouldn't take a \nscientist to prove that wildlife numbers in Yellowstone were high because \nof no hunting within the park and relatively more balanced outside of the \npark because management of wildlife involves hunting.  I am not saying that \nwolves don't have their place in the ecosystem outside of the park, but to \nbelieve the wildlife conditions that lie within the park boundaries are the \nsame as those outside of the boundaries is foolhardy",

Bear in mind, I\u2019m not trying to \ncondescend you, I simply want to hear where you\u2019re getting your info from.\n\nNow, erosion is always happening in rivers, that is true, but the rate of \nerosion that occurs in these rivers is far slower than you\u2019re claiming. \nHowever, it\u2019s been clearly established that the presence of wolves has \nreduced the artificially high levels of elk who graze along the Yellowstone \nriver, resulting in the growth of more willows along this river. Since \nwillows thrive in a river environment, this creates an increased amount of \nwillow range in the river, and as more trees spring up (and there are more \nspecies than willows that have been affected, mind you, the willows are \nsimply the most prominent example,) the more sediment is trapped.  Since \nthe flow rate of the river has not increased, it stands to reason that the \nriver would naturally change course.\n\nNow, as for your point on hunting the wolves, yes, I believe that to a \ncertain extent, wolves should still be hunted (to a sustainable extent) if \nthey repeatedly venture onto ranch lands and pose a threat to the cattle, \nor if their population reaches such a level that the elk populations drop \nbelow sustainable levels.  But saying that the small negative effect on \nhumans by the reintroduction of wolves is justification to paint all wolves \nwith the same negative brush is like saying that all guns should be banned \nbecause a few mass murders occur with them.  It\u2019s not only unfair, it\u2019s \nalso illogical.",

                "text": "And now I want to share with you one of the most interesting short videos \nI've seen in a while. It's about the idea of *trophic cascades:* how a \nsmall change to an ecosystem can lead to tremendous consequences. In this \ncase, the change was the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone in the \n1990's, after a 70-year absence.\n\nThe direct effects of the wolves were small: the wolves eat a few deer, but \napart from that mostly keep to themselves. But the indirect effects were \nhuge.\n\nIt started because the deer, who had been running roughshod over the entire \npark, quickly figured out that places like valleys were *not good places* \nto be a deer when there are wolves about. This led to trees being able to \ngrow in those areas for the first time in decades.\n\nThe effects of that are complex and profound, and I encourage you to watch \nthe video, because I can't possibly summarize it better than it does. \nEverything from the animals to the plants to the very physical geography of \nthe rivers was changed. \n\nThe key lesson of this is that ecosystems are connected. You can't make a \nsingle change to one and expect it not to have consequences, including very \nfar-reaching ones of a sort you couldn't ever have predicted. This is a \ngeneral property of all large, strongly-interacting systems, including \nsocieties, and it's worth keeping in mind whenever things change.\ufeff",

The second is in response \nto the Disnyesque way some portray wolves, and the arrogant way people who \nhave probably never been in wolf country foolishly speak of  them as good \nneighbors when history - that I've provided ample links to - proves \notherwise.  I never SAID wolves are unnecessary, but we got along just fine \nwithout them for 70 years in my neck of the woods before we were \nre-infested, so history suggests it's true.\n\nIf you had 'endangered' wolves roaming your area your legal right to 'drive \nthem back from the perimeter lines'  is prohibited by the ESA, lawyers, \njudges, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy and others \nor risk jail and fines.  The ESA specifically ignores financial loss and \npersonal safety when dealing with 'listed' species.\n\nFinally, if you think you can just go for a stroll in the woods and kill \nwolves, you are mistook because they are elusive.  Wolves find you.  Three \nto six in a pack, from three to six directions at once.  Good luck with \nthat shotgun. Watch the videos I posted of wolves vs Moose and wolves vs \nbison.  Their tactics put a whole new meaning to the word 'wolfgang'  and \nexhaust the victim.\n\nJust to be clear:  The majority of 'killing sprees' are done by federal \nfish and game wolf managers, the same ones who re-infested the rocky \nmountains with wolves.   These wolfers \"hunt\" from helicopters - something \ntaxpayers are prohibited from doing - home in on homing signals from the \nwolf's radio tracking collar - and wipe out packs that are habituated to \nbeef, mutton, dog or daughter.  Carter Neimeier was such a person, and he's \npro-wolf.  Glance thru his book here \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Wolfer-A-Memoir-Carter-Niemeyer/dp/0984811303/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397779204&sr=8-1&keywords=wolfer\n\nNeimeyer says that the best thing to happen to wolves is a wolf hunting \nseason:  It makes them wary.  Wolf attacks occur when seemingly innocent \nencounters - sharing a snack with a wolf - turns deadly for the sharer or \ngirlfriend snoozing nearby.  See references posted earlier. ",

                    "text": "+Pro Angler Dude, there is no over-population of wolves.  As a disclaimer, \nI am a little offensive, but I do make good points/opinions and not all of \nthem are against your opinions; I truly do just have an abrasive \npersonality when it comes to all things natural, wild, and (should be!) \nfree. \nThere is no over-population of wolves anywhere in the U.S. - no matter what \npeople who sell you their expensive tags say.  People will shoot wolves \nlegally and illegally, so I think that to maintain (I say again, MAINTAIN) \nnatural populations of other animals we need to keep all the wolves we can. \n People will always shoot wolves for reasons either legitimate or \nillegitimate reasons (natural wolf populations will always be low due to \nthis human interference - let me emphasize the \"interfere\" part of that \nword).  One thing that cracks me up about this is this guy's separation of \nthe \"physical aspect of the landscape\" and \"ecosystem.\"  These wolves are a \nkeystone species.  And let me define \"keystone\" for those who might \noverlook that word.  Keystone is a central most important aspect of a thing \n(in an arch, the keystone keeps it together - otherwise it would fall apart \nor weather and fall apart), and the wolves keep this ecosystem together. \n This is where you would get over population (of deer) without it.  Maybe \nif hunters would hunt more deer, *we* would not \"need\" wolves to maintain \nthe balance.  In fact, we would, but that's only if you care about your \nhome, err, I mean the planet (one in the same, eh?).  The \"other\" side of \nthis story is one that I should say that I am biased against, but not only \nbecause I think it is just completely silly to think that we \"need\" to \neradicate a species because we do not like them coming onto \"our\" property \nand killing our livestock.  You know what?  That is a load of selfish BS. \n If you think you need to kill a wolf for that reason that would be the \nONLY thing that I would say could be considered warrant for the act of \nmurdering such an important part of the natural world.  I say this solely \nbecause there is no way that anyone who would could be convinced not to \nkill a majestic animal such as Canis lupis.  Would you shoot your \nneighbor's dog?  Well, Mother Nature is not only your neighbor, but she \nalso hosts your favorite hunting spots - you hunt on HER property.  I would \nhave less of a problem if hunters hunted less for sport and prestige, and \nmore for 1) survival, 2) respect, OR 3) protection (as in \nthe aforementioned situation of a farmer protecting her/his livestock). \n You hunt for food, or you hunt for the love of nature (for example, to \nlower deer populations when natural predators have been killed off and \ncan't control the populations naturally).  I say, \"love of nature,\" meaning \nthe utmost respect, and I mean to maintain natural balance.  So you can \ntell with the wolves being gone for so long and the ecosystem going down \nthe toilet, the hunters who did hunt in the area were not hunting for the \nlove of nature, maybe for sport or food, but they did not hunt to maintain \nnatural order.  So your argument is that to kill an apex predator is not \nfor anything more than to \"maintain natural order,\" it was not for the \nprestige of killing a magnificent relic of the ancient past (where did your \nfido come from?) it was not for the feelings of power of bringing down a \ndeadly, big-bad wolf?  I say, if you want to hunt wolves for \"fun,\" kill it \nwith weapons that will make it more fair.  How did our ancestors kill \nwolves?  They either didn't or used bows or spears, harpoons or other \nthrowing blades.  I'm sure other things, but they did not use the modern \ninventions of bullets and powder.  While it might be more \"humane\" (is it \never humane to kill a healthy wild animal?) to use a one-shot kill, it \nwould be better to use more primitive tool.  This way,if you did miss, the \nwolf would have a chance to survive, or you would have to WORK for your \nprize.  Look at things from more than just a \"I have to take a life to get \noff\" perspective, and try to look at it like \"I need to preserve as much of \nour natural world [for my kids and my neighbor's kids] as I can.\"  You do \nnot need to be allowed to kill wolves to maintain their populations.  Once \nthe deer population reaches it's new carrying capacity (the one that the \nabiotic and now new biotic - the wolves - factors have set) the wolf \npopulation will go to a stable one.  That is the natural order of things. \n That IS the natural order of things.  In undisturbed ecosystems (hard to \nfind these days), there is a natural cycle of a spike in prey species' \npopulations (pop. for short) and then a spike in the predator's pop., and \nthen you will see a plummet in the prey's pop. then a plummet in the \npredator's pop., then a spike in the prey's pop. not unlike that of the \nfirst  This is the natural cycle of things.  You do not need to kill \n\"scary\" things because they are scary.  You should kill them only when they \nattack or otherwise harm you (or your \"property,\" including your wife or \nkids).",

The top level predators WERE here first, and we have decimated so \nmany ecosystems by removing them to meet our own ends.

As a result, whatever \nsaplings do manage to sprout further away no longer get stripped of their \nsoft bark and shoots, they manage to grow and develop into copses.\n\nSo, eventually, you wind up with a patchwork forest; large, dense copses \nseparated by lanes of grasses. The grazers strip the copses of everything \nyoung, though, so you get these relatively clear, mature forests that die \noff after a hundred years, eventually turning into a mass of bare, standing \ntrunks.

                "text": "And now I want to share with you one of the most interesting short videos \nI've seen in a while. It's about the idea of *trophic cascades:* how a \nsmall change to an ecosystem can lead to tremendous consequences. In this \ncase, the change was the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone in the \n1990's, after a 70-year absence.\n\nThe direct effects of the wolves were small: the wolves eat a few deer, but \napart from that mostly keep to themselves. But the indirect effects were \nhuge.\n\nIt started because the deer, who had been running roughshod over the entire \npark, quickly figured out that places like valleys were *not good places* \nto be a deer when there are wolves about. This led to trees being able to \ngrow in those areas for the first time in decades.\n\nThe effects of that are complex and profound, and I encourage you to watch \nthe video, because I can't possibly summarize it better than it does. \nEverything from the animals to the plants to the very physical geography of \nthe rivers was changed. \n\nThe key lesson of this is that ecosystems are connected. You can't make a \nsingle change to one and expect it not to have consequences, including very \nfar-reaching ones of a sort you couldn't ever have predicted. This is a \ngeneral property of all large, strongly-interacting systems, including \nsocieties, and it's worth keeping in mind whenever things change.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Matthew J Price Indeed this is something we talk about in vegan circles \nquite a bit, the way that every choice still leads to the destruction of \nhabitat, insect species, etc. A life free of causing damage to others is \nnot possible, and thus I consider veganism an effort to minimize impact \n(process rather than goal oriented). Even us in the western world live the \nway we do because of the exploitation of other human animals. It's arguable \nthat survival requires exploitation, but that only works in an evolutionary \ncontext where only the fittest survive. We don't talk about wolves' \nexploitation of deer because due to that context of survival rather than \nmorality.\n\nMorality and ethics have little meaning in such a context. Should we think \nof ourselves as creatures who will do anything it takes to survive no \nmatter how destructive and exploitative we become? Or should we think of \nourselves as being part of a larger system where our survival is encouraged \nby diversity of other species, especially other competitive species?\n\n*If we had a few wishes from the technology fairy to make this dilemma \neasier, or better, obviated, what would that look like?*\n\nWow, that is a question! I don't think of technology as other, but rather a \nreflection of the dominant (and often implicit) cultural values of those \nwho create and use it. Thus, asking the technology fairy is really asking \nthe cultural fairy. Consequently, I'll interpret your question as: How \nshould us humans be different in order to make this dilemma easier? I think \nthe root of a lot of our problems (in terms of exploitation and \nsustainability) is our ability to internalize what which we have and \nconsider it 'normal'. Once we consider what we have as normal, getting used \nto less becomes a punishment. We always want more (growth) because we \nalways adapt to that which we have. This is just greedy search.\n\nI think technology (and capitalism) compound(s) this by driving \n'innovation' (read, change). I personally combat this tendency by \nintentionally keeping myself grounded in my technologies. I use the oldest \n(slowest) computer in my house the most because that way the oldest stays \nnormal and thus the newer machines always feel fast (and thus new) it's \nlike getting a new machine everytime I choose to do a job that needs speed.\n\nIn the broader sense, I get rid of X and see how it effects my life. This \nis how I came to veganism, one step at a time over many years. This \ninvolves an ongoing refinement of what 'need' means. I think the answer may \nbe in cognition, maybe its as simple as being sceptical of what we have and \nthus expecting it not to be normal, imagining at any point it may \ndisappear. I think this is also related to empathy. If we get used to \ndealing with people with the same values all the time, then the lack of \nconflict becomes normal, we become to expect others to be like us, and \nperhaps this makes it easier to cast others in the role of 'other'. As a \nspecies we hardly see other humans as equals, let alone alien intelligences \nlike non-human animals with whom we can hardly communicate. We see 'others' \nas resources to support our own values in our communities. It's all very \nself-centred, as life is.\n\nActually, if we consider my previous comments on social animals, I'm \nstarting to wonder if social ability is really the next frontier. We are \nnot good survivors because we are intelligent, we are good survivors \nbecause we are social, and that requires intelligence. Maybe what we are \ntesting (in the evolutionary sense) is the viability of a super-social \ncreature. Either we expand like a virus, where our social abilities never \ncatch up to our population, or we figure out how to get along and solve our \nproblems together.\n\nIt seems clear that our selfish tendencies and social abilities are tuned \nto a community size significantly smaller than what we have. Either we \nchange how we are social (get along in larger groups, empathize with and \nrespect other species, build multi-species social systems to collaborate, \nrather than exploit), or we shrink our communities so that there is a \nbetter fit between our social tendencies, and our long-term survival.\n\nThe former is really the only viable option as the latter is gets to the \nethical quandary of breeding control. It is clear the fastest growing \npopulations are the least wealthy and least educated, and thus any such \neffort would be class warfare.",

Both are ethical issues, but its certainly possible that death \ncan involve no suffering and that suffering may not lead to death. In the \ncontext of this video, I find the death part much less interesting than the \nwolves' effect on the *behaviour* of other species. As in, the *threat* of \ndeath may be functional --- how we could maintain the illusion of threat \nwithout death is an open question. There is an interesting question \nregarding what is left for motivation when pain and suffering are removed. \nThere are certainly interesting implications for evolution.\n\n*First, how do we support ecosystems properly without carnivores?  Is there \nsuch a thing as \"properly\"?*\n\nI do not consider evolution as a process of increasing X (intelligence, \ncomplexity, etc.); I think evolution a search process for finding useful \nlocal minima (ecological niches). After thousands of years of interactions \n(without humans), species reinforce their niches. Once you remove something \nfrom that system (wolves) then this significantly effects the rest of the \nsystem. Which is better? In this case it seems the wolves increased \ndiversity by keeping the deer in check which I expect exploded in \npopulation during the wolves' absence. At the same time, this time without \nwolves was great for the deer, they probably had greater diversity (due to \na reduction of predatory pressure), and certainly higher population. You \ngive them an inch, they take a mile. To survive, any species will take all \nit can, and sustainable populations require constraints.\n\nAs for \"properly\", that is, of course, context dependent and value laden. I \nthink the articulation of these terms is the most important thing we can do \nbefore we try and solve the (environmental) problems we have. Of course, \nwhat is good for us is bad for others. Unlike any other species, humans are \nreally amazing at decreasing biodiversity. If we decide that biodiversity \nis important (more important than cheap energy and high 'quality of life'), \nthen we need to figure out how to constrain ourselves, which is quite \ndifficult considering survival is a central driver of life. Like deer, \nviruses or bacteria, we'll fill in all the niches we can because that is in \nour nature. What the ecosystem may need to work properly may just be less \nhumans, a lot less. Who is to survive and why? Maybe intelligence, \nlongevity and technology are actually those things that destine us for \nextinction; just as any population explodes, there is an inevitable \ncorrection. We do not live in isolation but depend on the ecosystem around \nus, as much as we build environments around us that distract us from this \nfact.\n\n*Does anyone agree on what level of consciousness is required for an \ncreature to deserve moral consideration?  By what metric are we quantifying \nthis consciousness?*\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here. First I want to make a distinction between \nconsciousness (sentience, awareness) and self-consciousness \n(awareness/construction of self). I think consciousness is ubiquitous among \nanimals with brains, self-consciousness is a little more tricky. The \nquestion is always what evolutionary purpose does self-consciousness have? \nIt seems to only be valuable for social animals.\n\nAs for moral consideration, it seems the central basis should be based on \nthe ability to suffer, which I would put under the category of \nconsciousness. An individual suffers if they are able to experience pain, \nand experiencing pain is expected to be a central aspect of awareness \n(consciousness).\n\nAs for metrics, we can imagine drawing a line between conscious animals and \nself-aware (social) animals. While those 'lower' animals suffer, we can get \naround that by not causing them suffering ('humane' treatment). We could \nfeel justified in killing them because their lack of self-awareness means \nthey cannot reflect on their impending end. I think this is a \nrationalization. By existing, all animals have gone through a long \nevolutionary process to become autonomous survivors. Interfering with their \nautonomy is us exercising our power over them (exploitation). For me, the \nquestion is not about metrics of consciousness, or drawing a line between \n'us' and 'them', but really about how we can engage in social relations \nwith other animals that involve consent. This may only be possible with \nother social animals, but perhaps there are degrees of how social an animal \nis. Here is a twist, because we would be more likely to get consent from \nsocial animals (and engaging in mutually beneficial relationships), perhaps \nits even less ethical to exploit non-social (non-self-aware) animals. Thus, \nexploiting smart and self-aware social animals (whales, dolphins, rats, \ndogs, cats, birds, etc.) could be ethical in a context of consent, where \nthe exploitation of non-self-aware animals (fish?) is never ethical. After \nwriting this I'm not sure an actual non-social animal is a real thing, as \ntigers, pandas, etc. are considered solitary, and yet the fact that they \ncan be domesticated seems to indicate they can be socialized.\n\nMorality is equally context dependent and obviously value laden. Our \ncurrent ethics reflect our belief that our (human) expansion trumps all \nelse. Morality is about how humans are treated, and under what \nhuman-centric endeavour other animals can be exploited. The question of \nethics exists *only* in a context of exploitation: We want to learn how to \ndo X, so we can save lives, make money, etc.; under what circumstances can \nwe exploit animals to do X? When we talk about ethics, we talk about *how* \nwe can exploit others. The question of *whether* we should exploit at all \nis out of the question; by our nature, we are exploitative and \nself-centred. Such is life.\n\nSo what do we do with the awareness that we are destroying ourselves by \ndestroying the ecosystem? Get as much as we can before the end, living as \nlarge as possible before the wolves come back? Or do we change our nature \nand restrain the tendency of life to take all that we can?",

I think one of the largest impacts \nthey'll have in Oregon is the balancing out of the coyote population. \nCurrently there are these stupid \"coyote derbys\" and other contests in \nparts of oregon on who can bring in the most coyote ears. This is stupid 10 \ndifferent ways, but I'll point out why on two of the bigger reasons:\n\nKilling a coyote alpha female makes the other females in the pack go into \nheat. So hey, everyone else gets to have litters of pups!\n\nLitters become larger as these pack-oriented animals try to compensate for \nlost numbers\n\nWolves and coyotes are natural enemies. While they technically do not \noccupy the same ecological niche, wolves will not share their territory \nwith coyotes. As pointed out in the video, wolves will have a better impact \non controlling the population of coyotes than any poisoning, trapping, and \nhunting will. \n\nCoyotes are some of the biggest assholes for ranchers (oh hey, fun fact \ntime - domesticated dogs kill a ton of livestock too). Coyotes are smart, \nand also lazy hunters. If they get the idea they like sheep, they'll figure \nout all the deterrents that a rancher will use. Wolves are much more likely \nto maintain a purely wild-meat diet, and are more likely to avoid \nvisual/audible deterrents that ranchers put up. That's not to say that \nwolves won't prey on livestock. They can and do. But statistically \nspeaking, the neighbor's pack of dogs, or coyotes, pose larger threats. If \nand when a wolf gets a taste for farm-raised meat, I don't see an issue \nwith culling one or two bad apples from the pack that make a nuisance out \nof themselves. It's unfortunate to do so, but we also treat other larger \npredators who lose their fear of humans the same way (such as bears who get \na taste for garbage cans/civilization)\n\nTLDR - I think wolves in Oregon will be fine, with intelligent and trained \npeople at the head of any reintroduction effort.",

In addition, the expanded wolf population has decimated other species \nin the park. These \"deer\" as the narrator called them are the elk herds \nthat used to roam the park. Wolves are pack animals and when the pack is \nsuccessful the wolves get \"blood lust\" which is killing for killings sake. \nElk herds in and around Yellowstone were virtually wiped out by the wolves \nin their blood lust. That was the real reason there was a trophic cascade. \nThen they turned to coyotes. Finally the wolf packs are starving due to a \nlack of prey and are sick and dying from fleas. Nature, it seems, is taking \nback what man thought was best.\ufeff",

Prior to \nEuropeans \"discovering\" America, did wolves eat all of the available prey? \nAnd yes, nature does balance if left alone. There are annual fluctuations, \nbut things average out. Please read this article \nhttp://www.conservationnw.org/what-we-do/predators-and-prey/carnivores-predators-and-their-prey \n(scroll down about half way to the \"Predators & prey: Wolves and \nwhite-tails\" section) and try to digest this:\n\nThere are 3,000 wolves in Minnesota. They eat on average about 50,000 of \nthe estimated 450,000 white-tailed deer a year. This represents about 11.5 \n% of the deer population, with minimal supplements of snowshoe hares, \nbeavers, and moose.\n...\n\nThe research showed that doe mortality from wolves ranged from 4% to 22% \nper year but most typically was between 5% to 10% per year with the highest \nrate observed in the very severe winter of 1995-96.\n\nDespite the fact that deer outnumber wolves in Minnesota by 150 to 1, \nwolves are not particularly effective hunters of white-tails.\n\nAccording to the MDNR, \u201cWolves end up surviving primarily on the most \nvulnerable individuals in the deer population, such as very young, old, \nsick, injured, or nutritionally compromised deer, because those are the \nones they can catch. The result being, that under certain conditions\u2026many \nof the deer that wolves kill likely would have died from other causes, such \nas starvation or disease.\u201d\n\nBiologists refer to such predation impacts as \u201ccompensatory\u201d as opposed to \nthe \u201cadditive\u201d effects of human hunters, who kill most prey in the prime of \ntheir reproductive lives.",

Yet your life-experience is not much better since it may very well \nbe the case that other's have had the opposite experience not to speak of \nthe subjective nature of personal experience. \n\nEpistemology aside however, your allegation is that humanity is cruel, \nselfish and stupid. Let's look at each of your charges in turn.\n\nIs humanity cruel? Obviously cruel humans exist but I find it hard to think \nthey are a majority, most people have friends and family who they care \nabout and many would not turn away strangers who ask for help. Moreover we \ndon't just care about other humans, we tend to love our pets, we admire the \nwild animals and we even feed animals who aren't pet's or livestock such as \nbirds. When we hurt others we seem to feel compelled to find a \njustification, something which implies that cruelty is not something we \nlike or is part of our natural tendencies. Lastly nature is cruel, so why \nwould it be a problem if humanity is cruel since you surely don't have a \nproblem with other animals causing each other suffering and harm?\n\nSelfishness is again something which there is no lack of in nature and as I \ndescribed when speaking of human cruelty, it seems the opposite is the \ncase. Altruism in other species rarely extend beyond the boundaries of the \nspecies or the group, yet this seems to be frequent of humans.\n\nLastly, I find the idea that humanity is stupid patently absurd. Are we not \nthe most intelligent species on the planet? Perhaps you meant to speak of \nignorance but if so, why the despair? Are we not expanding the limits of \nwhat we know and do we not learn from our mistakes? In this area I would \nthink that there is the most reason to have hope. \n\nIf I had believed that humanity was cruel, selfish and stupid and thought \nthat to be reason to denounce it then I can't imagine the hate I would feel \nto the rest of nature.",

I want my children and grandchildren for generations. What I \nhope that people don't do is jump to uneducated opinion about how to do so \nin areas that are foreign to them. I am a conservationist also, in my own \nway. I do not like the way that the wolf was reintroduced, but I appreciate \nthat it was. One thing that I haven't said is that I was 25 meters from a \nwolf with my gun drawn and could have legally shot it. What changed my mind \nwas that I saw that she was obviously a mother. She was taking food back to \nher pups. I didn't shoot because I would not do that with any animal. I \nlater heard the pups attempting to howl with joy after having eaten. It \nmade me smile because I love and appreciate nature. I will always listen to \nmultiple points of view because I know that everything has a consequence. I \nsee the consequence of this is a lot of areas. I have personal, close \nexperience with the consequence of wolves.

It would also seem that at large, man has \nlost access to \"natural instincts\", such as being able to differentiate \nfrom the desire to drink water vs coffee, tea, and soda. Or the desire to \neat real food instead of chemically laden, processed, poisonous garbage. \nAnd, the instinct to know when our behavior is destabilizing the natural \ninfrastructure that allows our own survival.\n\nWhat will the imbalance we are causing attract as a balancing force? Do we \nneed to turn Grizzly bears loose in major cities, or encourage TV \nprogramming that focuses on things we all need to know about how to live in \nbalance with the earth and simple tips for doing that?\n\nMuch chi,\nPaul Chek\nHolistic Health Practitioner\nFounder, C.H.E.K Institute\ufeff",

The wolf is an essential part \nof the natural food chain and as evidenced by the video re-introducing them \nback into the park has had an awesome effect. Thanks ",

Everything on Earth is connected and should be \ntreated with respect. This belief is one of the reasons I identify so much \nwith Native Americans. Of course, overpopulation of ANY species, including \nthe wolf, has negative consequences to the environment, so obviously the \npark has to monitor the wolf population.

However there are numerous accounts of close \ncalls and they are growing more in frequency. This is no fault of the wolf \nor the humans it is simply a matter of humans enjoying the outdoors and \nbeing in closer proximity to wolves. Only time will tell if attacks will \nhappen. I hope it never does.\n\nAs far as elk numbers I ask you to look at the latest elk census taken \nafter the wolves have begun to migrate into the area where the elk live. \nPlease look at the reports from the state biologists reports from Wyoming, \nIdaho, and Montana. Idaho currently has 650 wolves in residence and the elk \npopulation has been reduced significantly. Such so that the state is now \nspending $2,000,000 to reduce the numbers of wolves in hopes of reviving \nthe elk populations. Well they were but wolf conservation groups have taken \nlegal action to try and block these effort. Elk numbers were at their \nhighest before the introduction of wolves and have done nothing but drop \nsince the arrival of the wolves. This is not a fault of over hunting but is \na direct result of wolf predation. For a fun time look up elk populations \nin the western united states from 15 years ago then look up the same data \nfrom 2 years ago. If you overlay them you will see the numbers are way way \ndown. Now overlay the known wolf ranges and you can see very quickly that \nprey animals drastically suffer when wolves move into the area.\n\nIn my humble opinion to few elk is any number smaller then what the natural \nhabitat can carry. I want the maximum number of prey animals per square \nmile that any ecosystem can carry.\n\nI believe that wolves have the right to exist but not at the detriment of \nother animals. If you reduce the prey animals you reduce hunting which in \nturn reduces the amount of money going into the conservation effort. The \nreason that hunting is reduced is simply because hunters will not allow \nmore animals to be taken then an area can carry. We want more animals next \nyear. It is not about the challenge of the hunt but the betterment of the \nspecies. When these animals are taken by wolves money is lost I don't know \nhow to put it better. I don't know why conservation groups would risk \nlosing 1.2 billion dollars in revenue by simply introducing wolves. The \nmoney prey animals that are around to be hunted the more tags can be sold \nand thus the more money is generated. If this money is lost how will it be \nrecouped. Will we have to start charging for access to public lands? I \nsurely hope not.",

                    "text": "+Eddy Howard Eddie,  I do have to comment on the possibility of wolves \nattacking humans.  There is not a known documented case of a wolf killing a \nhuman in North America.  There are a few unresolved whether it was a bear \nor wolf.  Wolves by nature are very fearful of humans, unlike coyotes and \nsuch.  I think they get a bad rap due the fables and folklore like Little \nRed Riding Hood.  More elk attack humans than wolves.\n\nAnother point I don't necessarily agree is that the reintroduction of \nwolves kills tens of thousands of prey animals. In YP the 89 wolves killed \n159 elk out of 255 kills. I realize in ID, MT and other states there are \n300-400 wolves, I still don't see how that translates into tens of \nthousands of prey animals.\n\nConversely, are we allowing too many to be hunted? I don't know. And what \nis too few elk?  Is it solely driven by the supply for hunters and ease of \nhunting vs a more challenging hunt when numbers are lower?\n\nEddy, you are so right when it comes to the funds spent by the two \nsides fighting when the ultimate goal is the same.  Imagine what we could \ndo together and with those types of monies. I believe in the rights of \nhunters, I have concern for ranchers livelihoods (heck, I eat their steaks \netc) and I believe in a wolf's intrinsic right to exists in its natural \nterritory. ",

                    "text": "+Marvin Jayson\nHi Marvin,\n\nI think we can agree to disagree on the trophic cascade affect. I would be \nmore apt to believe it if the problem had been brought up before the \nintroduction of the wolves instead of after. If this really were the issue \nthen I believe that Yellowstone should have been in peril during the 70+ \nyears that the wolves weren't there. But that being said for the sake of \nargument if this problem did exist shouldn't the decision making process \nhave went something like this:\n\nProblem: The Yellowstone ecosystem is running 20% under what it could be.\n\nProposed Solution: Introduce wolves back into the environment to bring this \nback to where it should be.\n\nPros:\n1) With the introduction of wolves in the park they will regulate the \novergrazing and bring the Yellowstone ecosystem back to optimal levels of \ninteraction.\n\nCons:\n1) Introduction of wolves will kill thousands or tens of thousands of prey \nanimals which will impact the surrounding areas financially. This will \ndrastically decrease the amount of monies available to these areas which \nhelp with habitat management and game law enforcement.\n\n2) Wolves will not stay within the borders of the park and will expand \ntheir territory preying on livestock thus becoming a burden to ranchers in \nthat area. The compensation for loses suffered by this predation will be \nsignificant and will be paid from money generated by tax payer dollars.\n\n3) Wolves are opportunistic predators and will prey on any food source \navailable. This means the loss of cows, sheep, horses, even family pets as \ntheir range expands. I am purposefully not bringing up attacks on humans \nbut it is a possibility.\n\nWith this decision making process I don't believe that wolves would have \nbeen allowed back into any ecosystem. These are only a few of the reasons \nthat states like Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming all vehemently denounced the \nreintroduction of the wolf.\n\nThat being said and like Michelle pointed out hunters and non hunters alike \nall want the exact same thing. The preservation of land for future \ngenerations to enjoy. To me this is the worse part of this entire wolf \nintroduction. Shouldn't conservationist whether they be hunters or non \nhunters be working together to preserve land for future generations instead \nof fighting one another and wasting resources that could go toward the \npurchase of land that would do just that. I cringe to think how much money \nhas been wasted when hunters and non hunters fight one another. In my mind \nthe developers are just sitting back enjoying the show and hope everyone \nkeeps distracted. I am sorry this is so short but I only have a few \nminutes. I really would love to keep discussing this and hopefully we can \nunderstand one another better.\n\nTo WoodSprout I am sorry but I wasn't very clear. I don't want to hunt \nYellowstone, (well I kind of do now that you brought it up :). I was simply \nasking if all affects of the wolf introduction had been brought up and \nthought about.",

                    "text": "+Eddy Howard Eddy I appreciate the dialogue and I want to understand other \npoints of view.  Your point 1 disagreement, I didn't mean to insinuate that \nthe elk pop hasn't decrease, it has.  What is the proper population for \nYellowstone, that I don't know.  However, last year 89 wolves killed 159 \nelk, I don't think they are entirely responsible for the decline. If the \ntropic cascade is true, then the wolves have an indirect relationship with \nthe increase in the bear population. But I still don't see both species are \nresponsible for such a decline. Should the decline be studied and managed \nabsolutely.  But I don't think eradicating wolves in the answer (not that \nyou suggested it). Again, what is the proper elk population for \nYellowstone? I can't find anything on it. \n\nFor point # 2, I profess I don't know much about hunting.  I have friends \nthat are hunters but I don't know the details.  I just see mounted animals \non the walls :-)  I have a healthy respect for hunters, the deer herds here \nstill need more culling.\n\nRegarding are the current wolves in YP; are they native to Yellowstone? yes \nas species they are, the Gray Wolf, Canus Lupus, as a subspecies no. The \nwolves released are Mackenzie Valley Wolves vs the original Rocky Mountain \nsub species.  There is a whole other debate about sub-species.  The \nMackenzie Valley are slightly larger but as far as aggression, I'm not sure \nwhat you mean.  They kill only when hungry, they are not random killers \njust to kill.  And yes, Yellowstone ecosystem began to have a noticeable \nchange a few years after the wolves vanished. As an example, beaver were \nalmost non existent until the return of the wolves.\n\nI do believe hunters love animals and wildlife, I know people can \ngeneralize and attached labels but just because someone hunts doesn't mean \nthe don't like wildlife including predators.\n\nAnother animal that is still in peril in YP is the Moose but that has more \nto do with the huge fire of 1988 which burned about 45% of the park. \n\nthanks for the thought provoking dialogue",

As I was reading up \nyesterday, the key term was \"reintroduction\", as the wolves were extirpated \nin the 1920s. So I believe it was also their natural habitat.\n\nGoing back to the issue if the wolves were the right solution or not, and \nassuming that trophic cascades are indeed true (a lot of documentation \nsupports it), then simply from a cause and effect standpoint, I believe the \nwolves were the right choice. As for the question if there really was a \nproblem, if comparing the before and after effects and seeing which is \nbetter, again, I'd say the wolves were the right choice.\n\nAssuming that the trophic cascade is real and is the impact of the wolves \nin this case, it's also possible that hunters wouldn't have had the same \neffect. Since the predator-prey relationship affects each other's behavior, \nlet's say the wolf-elk, it also affects other animals, coyote, fox, \nscavengers, etc., then there's a risk that hunters wouldn't have that same \neffect. I hope that makes sense. Anyway, thanks for your replies.",

                    "text": "+Michelle Steinmeyer\nHi Michelle,\n\nI believe that every animal has a right to exist however they need to be \nmanaged. The difference between bears and wolves is significant while bears \ndo eat elk calves, they don't only eat elk, deer, bison and so on. Coyotes \ndo however they are much smaller and their impact is much less intrusive. \nThis does bring up the point about whether or not these wolves that are \nrelocated to Yellowstone are native to this area? As I understand it these \nwolves are much larger and more aggressive kind of like what you are seeing \nwith the Anacondas down in Florida. No natural predators and an abundance \nof food. Great for the predator not so good for the prey. They only way to \ncontrol predator numbers now is to wait for all the prey to be killed then \nthe wolves to starve to death. This doesn't seem very logical to me.\n\nThe overall question I keep asking myself and the one that never seems to \nbe answered is what problem were we solving? I did not realize that \nYellowstone had an issue with overgrazing, or low numbers of beavers, or \nsmall number of foxes, or less then adequate numbers of migratory birds, so \non and so on. If I am mistaken please let me know. The Yellowstone I knew \nwas a utopia of wildlife diversity found few other places on earth. We \ndecided to \"improve\" on that by introducing the wolves back into the \necosystem. To me this is a case of meddling just because we can.\n\nI do disagree with you on a couple of points.\n\n1: If the trees and grasses are coming back it is not because elk are less \nstationary it is simply because there are fewer and fewer of them left to \nbrowse. Let's call that what it is, to say that elk are eating less because \nthey are running around to much seems very silly.\n\n2: The second is scavenging for other animals. When a hunter kills not all \nof the animal is taken, usually the innards are left and if the pack out is \ndifficult then the meat is removed from the bones and all the bones are \nleft. This means there is a significant amount of food for all other \nanimals. In fact if you want to find out if a hunter has been successful \nsimply look for the coyotes, crows, and other scavengers in that area.\n\nI really do appreciate you replying back to me. My goal is not to convince \nyou to hunt or that I hate wolves. My hope is that people will begin to see \nwhy this is upsetting to the sportsperson. Contrary to popular belief we \nlove our prey animals and are fanatical about them. I know this seems \ncounter intuitive but trust me we do. Imagine what would happen if you \nspent billions of dollars restoring herds, purchasing habitat, and \ncountless millions of hours trying to preserve something for future \ngenerations only to have an opposing agenda introduce something that \ncounteracts all your efforts. It is completely demoralizing and \nheartbreaking. Once again thanks for the reply.",

Grizzly feed on elk calves, should they be removed \nfrom the park?  I agree hunting helps manage over population. Where I live \nhas a huge population of deer.   However, if hunting was used in an attempt \nto correct over gazing and its affect in YP then you would not have the \ntrophic cascade.  Allot of animals scavenge on wolf kills, such as bears, \nbirds, fox etc. which the numbers have increase since their arrival and so \non.  As well, part of the regrowth of the valleys is not because of herd \nreduction but because of fear of the wolf. Elk, bison, deer don't linger \ndue to the fear of wolves. This would not happen with hunts.",

In fact I am hoping to generate an ongoing civil dialogue \nwith people who support the introduction of wolves so that I can better \nunderstand their logic. I would never blast anyone for having an opinion or \nbelief in this matter. It simply seems illogical to me to try and solve the \n\"problem\" of prey over population with the introduction of wolves. If there \nreally was an issue with this wouldn't it make more sense to solve this \nproblem by letting responsible tax paying sportsman harvest these animals? \nThe benefits of this would be that sportsman would be able to feed their \nfamilies unprocessed food and the public would benefit from the millions of \ndollars that would be generated from such an interaction. If humans had \ndispatched as many animals as these wolves have I seriously doubt the \nsupport would be the same. If the problem is over population why not find a \nsolution that is both economically benefiting and provides a finer quality \nof life for those who participate? I believe you can see why I am so \nconfused by this logic of introducing an apex predator that benefits no-one.",

Though, I \nthink the point of this video is balance in nature, and for this particular \ninstance, it's about the wolves. Going back to your comment, I'm now \napplying rational thought and I'd say what is being said in the video, it \nmakes sense to me. It may be wolf propaganda, but even so, I think it's \ntrue.

The entire planet is a living organism.\n\nThe flora and fauna on its surface are microorganisms, the water is like \nthe water in our bodies keeping everything liquid and living, in the oceans \nare enormous belts of water that circulate all water around the globe like \na cardiovascular system, at its core the Earth has a constantly pulsating, \ngyrating orb of molten iron like a heart that beats, producing the \nelectromagnetic field protecting us from radiation and other anomalies from \nspace.

Not \none these reasons are valid. \n\nRestrictions on pets in parks are as much to protect your pet as to protect \npark resources. Following are some of the reasons parks give for regulating \nthe presence of pets:\n--When a loose pet chases a squirrel or raccoon, the wild animal's ability \nto survive is threatened, and when it is threatened, it may react \naggressively.\n--There is a strong possibility in parks such as Yellowstone that your pet \ncould become prey for bear, coyote, owl, or other predators. \n--There is a possibility of exchange of diseases between domestic animals \nand wildlife. --Dogs, the most common traveling companion, are natural \npredators that may harass or even kill native wildlife that is protected \nwithin the park's boundaries.\n--The \"scent of a predator\" that dogs leave behind can disrupt or alter the \nbehavior of native animals. --Pets may be hard to control, even on a leash, \nwithin confines of often narrow park trails and may trample or dig up \nfragile vegetation. \n--Dog and cat feces add excessive nutrients and bacterial pollution to \nwater, which decreases water quality and can also cause human health \nproblems. \n--Finally, lost domestic animals sometimes turn to preying on park wildlife \nand must be destroyed.",

                "text": "And now I want to share with you one of the most interesting short videos \nI've seen in a while. It's about the idea of *trophic cascades:* how a \nsmall change to an ecosystem can lead to tremendous consequences. In this \ncase, the change was the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone in the \n1990's, after a 70-year absence.\n\nThe direct effects of the wolves were small: the wolves eat a few deer, but \napart from that mostly keep to themselves. But the indirect effects were \nhuge.\n\nIt started because the deer, who had been running roughshod over the entire \npark, quickly figured out that places like valleys were *not good places* \nto be a deer when there are wolves about. This led to trees being able to \ngrow in those areas for the first time in decades.\n\nThe effects of that are complex and profound, and I encourage you to watch \nthe video, because I can't possibly summarize it better than it does. \nEverything from the animals to the plants to the very physical geography of \nthe rivers was changed. \n\nThe key lesson of this is that ecosystems are connected. You can't make a \nsingle change to one and expect it not to have consequences, including very \nfar-reaching ones of a sort you couldn't ever have predicted. This is a \ngeneral property of all large, strongly-interacting systems, including \nsocieties, and it's worth keeping in mind whenever things change.\ufeff",

There is \na parallel to financial markets that comes close to Minsky's work.  Fires \n(recessions and depressions) are a natural part of the financial \necosystem.  After 70 years of diligent fire suppression (Federal Reserve \nmanipulation since 1940), you build up a lot of underbrush, which is fuel \n(misallocated capital) and you get megaevents like the Yellowstone fires of \nthe late 1980's (and The Unfolding Great Collapse - it's a process, not an \nevent).  Recessions and depressions are times when the market is cleared of \nmisallocations.  The clearing price often is 10% of what was paid at the \ntop.  Forest fires are times when the fuel load is removed from the \nforest.  You can't have a healthy ecosystem without them.  For the first \ntime in US history, we have two generations of people who have never known \nhard times.  You can't have a healthy human ecosystem in the absence of \nunderstanding of history.",

One of the things he mentioned that really struck me was \nthe relationship of beavers to the health of salmon runs. \n\nSalmon, said Mr. Merculieff, are starting to pick up parasites that \nnormally would not be found in their ranges but are moving northward as the \nocean warms. At the same time, snowpack melt is faster and more abrupt in \nthe spring than it used to be. Instead of gradual melting, rivers are \nflooding violently in the spring and then running lower in the summer. \nBecause of this, spawning salmon are more likely to get lesions as they \ntraverse the rivers and streams, making them more vulnerable to the \nparasites - and reducing the number of salmon that are able to complete \ntheir long journeys and reach their spawning grounds.\n\nIt seems that biologists were concerned about the salmon runs, and the \nhealth of the salmon in general. Some of the biologists asked a group of \nAlaska Native elders for their opinions on what might be causing the \nproblems for the salmon, and whether they'd seen problems like these in the \npast. Have you noticed, replied the elders, how many more beaver dams there \nare in recent years? \n\nWell, this immediately confused the scientists. What do beavers have to do \nwith salmon? They didn't pay much attention to the elders after that.  \n\nBut the beavers? Well, the beaver population has been increasing, and the \nrange of beavers has been moving northward. As the number of beavers \nincreases, more water is retained on land instead of adding to the flow of \nstreams and rivers - compounding the problem of the shallower waterways. \nObserving the beavers gives insight into changes in the ecosystem as a \nwhole. It is one piece of a very complex, interwoven tapestry of life in \nthe Arctic and sub-Arctic. What seems unrelated rarely if ever *is*. \n\nThis is not the same talk I heard (the one I attended wasn't recorded, \nthough I wish it had been), but he is talking about many of the same \nthings: TEDxHomer-Larry Merculieff-Native Knowing.

He runs a fly fishing \nand sporting goods store, so he is in constant contact with hunters and \nfishermen from all over Montana and northern Idaho. He also speaks to \npolice and game wardens and keeps up on local environmental news, for \nobvious reasons. Here's what he has to tell me:\n\nThe elk herd in Yellowstone has collapsed from 18,000 to fewer than 3,000 \nanimals. There are no moose left in Yellowstone -- none. They're all gone. \nDestroyed. \n\nThe whitetail herds in the Bitterroot have been wiped out. The mule deer \nare staying at higher altitudes and are half-starving. The elk herds are \ncollapsing or migrating away. What was the richest sport hunting grounds in \nNorth America has turned into a desert. Locals are having to drive six \nhours to eastern Montana to fill their deer and elk tags. The number of \nlocal outfitters has been reduced by two thirds over the past several \nyears, with a commensurate effect on the local economy. (Imagine if the \ntourist traffic in San Francisco were reduced by two thirds in a few years. \nWhat would happen to the local economy? to drug use? to the homeless \nproblem)?\n\nThe local police department gets reports of wolf sightings every day. A \nyoung woman out jogging was killed and eaten and her remains dragged so far \nso fast the trackers never recovered her. (Imagine that was your daughter. \nImagine you have no legal recourse, and if you shoot a wolf menacing one of \nyour surviving children you bid fair to be ruined or imprisoned). Armed men \nare standing guard at the school bus stops in the early morning. The \nofficial figures say there are 5000 wolves in the northwestern US; the \nlocal DFG biologists are looking at scat and tracks and carcasses and \nsaying no, there are at least that many in Montana alone. Those that do not \ntoe the politicized party line are transferred or fired.\n\nIn response to this catastrophe, the Feds are permitting 300 wolf tags to \nbe issued per. year. This will not even make a dent in the growth of the \nwolf population. In the ranching country of northern Idaho there have been \nwhole herds of cattle and sheep wiped out -- slaughtered for fun, many run \nto death with no bite marks on them. The governor of Idaho has openly \ndeclared he will not enforce any Federal laws prohibiting wolf hunting, and \nis wink-nudge encouraging people to shoot them. Politics in Montana is \nsomewhat more heavily dominated by migrant greenie-fascist control freaks; \nthe kind that launch frivolous lawsuits to prevent the logging of \nfire-killed timber (which subsequently turns into a fire hazard and \ndisease/bug factory that, in time, kills yet more of the surrounding \nforest). So the governor's office has not been quite so forthcoming.\n\nThe reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone may be the greatest single \ncatastrophe since the near-extermination of the buffalo herds. It took a \ncentury to push wolves out of that country the last time, and make it safe \nfor human civilization. God only knows how long it'll take this time.\n\nAnd none of it ever makes the news. Who cares about a bunch of stupid \nfilthy red-state bipeds anyway...? As long as you suburban \n'environmentalists' can feel good about yourselves, that's all that matters.\n\n/spit\ufeff",

I said there were no moose in \nYellowstone, not Missoula. And there aren't. I also said the young woman's \nbody was never retrieved; the trackers had to go back and tell her family \nwhat they *thought* happened. Go tell any Russian or Alaskan how harmless \nwolves are. They'll laugh in your face.\n\n#2: Elk are not 'fine' in your area. The number of animals -- both deer and \nelk --  taken according to the game station outside Darby (for non-locals, \nthe place where, if you've been hunting, you stop and tell the game \nmanagement people what you were hunting and where, and if you were \nsuccessful) has fallen by an order of magnitude over the past few years. \nYou used to see a couple thousand deer taken a month after opening day. Now \nit's a few hundred. I drove through there year before last and saw it \nmyself. It's sickening.\n\n#3: I already told you what Dad does for a living. What do *you* do, Hippy \nBrad? Pound a typewriter? According to the Montana DFG web site you've got \nonly 700-800 elk in the West Fork, which is 50% below what that pop should \nbe, and the West Fork has always been the pilot light for the whole area. \nCalvings are only 10-11 per hundred because the yearlings are getting \nfucking SLAUGHTERED. Which means the pop will continue to collaps as soon \nas the *older* elk start dying off. Or maybe you're telling me that two God \ndamn thirds of all outfitters going out of business in that area is a \nmysterious coincidence.\n\nMaybe they all retired at once, huh? Maybe every single hunter Dad knows \nthat's driving for six-eight hours so they can find meat to put in their \nfreezers are all lying their asses off. You're telling me there's 18K elk \nleft in western Montana when whole herds have simply vanished and old \nfavorite hunting places are barren except for wolf scat?\n\nDisinformation?

                    "text": "   So it is cool to call you a bitch? And why Larry's female? Your \nsugardaddy?  Nah, too easy. You know, that is how you call a female dog, \nright? Maybe you wanted to walk into this one. Anyway, not the point. Just \ncurious about your choice of words. Being somebody's something validates \nyou? Or, you are Larry's female persona. I can't know if I can't see you. \nThese are legitimate questions, not a trash talk. No matter, lets talk \nsymbolism. You can tell me if you want though. Anyway.\n    And since we are talking about symbolism, lets see where yours comes \nfrom. It is a christian proverb that portrays a non christian, supposedly \ninfiltrating the flock under false pretenses. So, wolf is the bad guy here, \nwho is trying to break up the hail Jesus business, but trying to be civil \nabout it, instead of pointing out how childish it is to follow somebody who \nspeaks on behalf of somebody you never met, and will never do. Hence the \nsheep clothing.\n     Now, most of the old cultures see a wolf as a free spirit who never \nsubmits to a rule, but lives and survives in equilibrium with nature. \nDespite all the enemies that are trying to end its existence. It doesn't \nfight back unless you stepped on its toes, or its hungry. Either way, its \nabout survival.\n    Dog symbolizes a sold out wolf, who has been trained to protect its \nmaster for scraps, and sells out its freedom and integrity for a wooden box \nin a garden and two plates of food a day. Sounds familiar?\n     What is a sheep though? Well, just look around. Sheep, dress the same, \nwalk the same, talk the same, and do as they told, which is the same. They \nare in a flock after all. Oh, and hope for the better future. Until of \ncourse its a slaughter day because the master is hungry. It is too late, \nwhen the knife is at your throat you know. \n   Disclaimer: this has nothing to do with animals. Any similarities are \npurely coincidental and do not represent the opinions or/and beliefs of the \nones who want to talk crap and don't want to be sued for it. No animals \nwere hurt during the construction of this essay. You know, being sheep and \nall. It is churches trademark after all.\n    Sheep are innocent though. They have no strength and no much of a \ncritical thinking. Dogs on the other hand, go against their brothers, the \nwolves, to protect their masters, who incidentally are the pigs.\n   That is how this symbolism works. And it has nothing to do with real \nanimals, and how much you love dogs. I am a dog person too. Besides, its \nnot easy to tame a wolf. We all compromise. I can't have a wolf friend, so \nI get a dog servant/friend. After all, it behaves the way I taught it, \nwhich suits my needs.\n     You know, punishing it for something that is of its nature, like \nmarking the territory, or use it to attack beings I don't like for some \nreason. It makes me feel superior, I am smarter than the dog and it does \nwhat I want, or else. Surely that sounds familiar. I don't have a dog, but \nthat is the way, isn't it?\n   Enjoy being a dog. Its better to be a sheep though, relatively speaking. \nYou won't have blood on your fur, at least not somebody else's. And wolves \nwill only eat as many as needed. Won't kill you for fun like they would \nkill a dog. Symbolically speaking.\n   Whether you are winding me up or not, it matters a little. What matters \nis that I am correct. Using your strongest argument. \n  Don't feel bad. Religion is a virus that rewrites itself and deletes \nevery other data, some say. Most of the times you don't even know that it \nis kicking in. There is no logic there. Just words of free thought slander. \n   I hope it helped you understand what I meant. Slavery is bad, you know, \ndoesn't matter how you sugarcoat it, it is still bad.\n   I don't mind talking, I do mind talking to myself though. So if you want \nto hear, I'll gladly tell. As I did, I think.\n      ",

How come no one has \nnoticed the destruction caused by such a species?\n\nYou also say we destroy land and it's animals as we spread out but I don't \nthink that's true most of the time.

As a \"case of simple probability\" a intelligent species will inevitably \nalter the environment in ways that have detrimental effect.\nConclusion: Intelligent species are detrimental to a ecosystem.\n\nI take issue with step 2 since it seems plausible to me that one could \nalter the environment in ways which benefits the biosphere. As long as that \nthe case I would be of the opinion that your position is based upon a false \ndichotomy. Furthermore if altering the environment can have beneficial \neffects then if we just see it as a case of simple probability it would \nseem that intelligence neither is detrimental or beneficial to a biosphere. \nNow I would think it natural to infer that a intelligent species would tend \nto act in a way which benefited the ecosystem it lives in. If my line of \nthought is correct it would lead to an conclusion which is opposite to \nyours.\n\nIt may be the case that I'm wrong though, in which case you would simply \nneed to either show your conclusion isn't based on a false dichotomy but a \ntrue one or you could make the case that intelligent species tend toward \nacting in ways detrimental toward the ecosystem it lives in.",

                    "text": "+Graeme McRae\nWhat a wonderful article.   Thank you Graeme.    I think what this article \nintroduces very well is the idea of complexity.   An ecosystem involves \nmultiple streams of interrelated independent variables and streams of \ncausation.   When I see that the cause is just one variable like wolf \nreintroduction impacting elks and then causing them to graze less or in \nless volume, then I get very concerned.   What I've learned through my \nexperiences with survey research is that there are usually at least a few \nvery important variables.  It makes sense to me that an absolute control \nlike fences around the Aspen will make those trees grow much higher \ngenerally.  The Elk can't reach them anymore.  Wolves on the other hand \nwill control  the eating of those saplings partially and intermittently.    \nThere are many times when the wolves will just not be around and others \nwhen they are full and not interested.  If there's a very dry season, the \nAspen will be stunted as a very cold growing period will do.   Beavers are \nanother important species.   I think that great article says they are good \nfor forests too.    So, there is both top down and bottom up control and \nmany scientists think we really need to look at the middle level.   I enjoy \nthis kind of reading very much and what it brings to mind is that it is \nreally important here to have an ethnological study of the forest and \nbiosphere in the park where citizen scientists observe careful, measure and \nrecord, and gather many, many data points.  It's like  some of the famous \nstudies that have been done of native peoples and their culture like the \nfamed anthropologist Margaret Mead did.  Here's a good link to her work \nfrom a wonderful Library of Congress Exhibition:\nhttp://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-samoa.html\n    In this case, we have the computing power and perhaps a large group of \ncitizen scientists who could really help us understand that Yellowstone \necosystem.  Citizen science as a way to augment the capabilities and data \ngathering power of scientists is becoming more and more important.  \n   Here's a blog about citizen science which I enjoy very much.  There is a \ngreat deal of good information on recommended computer science projects, \nnature projects, and many new happenings in the science world where \nvolunteers work with scientists to make science possible.\nhttp://www.openscientist.org/2014/02/big-news-from-openscientist.html?showComment=1394506391130#c8376365515129550555 \n \nI used to do quite a bit of this kind of thing by participating in a \nmedicine discovery computing project on BOINC the University of \nCalifornia's backbone internet system for many citizen science projects for \ndistributed computing for science.",

                    "text": "+frogsoda I think the point was to show just how essential the wolves were \nto the maintenance of the eco-system.  The deer leave certain areas where \nthey are more easily hunted by wolves, namely flat, open terrain.  So yes, \nthe wolves follow the deer, but they are less successful in the areas where \nthey now reside.  \n\nand the wolf population isn't likely to explode.  I hope at some point you \nwere taught the basic environmental mechanism of predator/prey cycles.  the \ntwo populations kept each other in check for a long time before humans, and \nthey'll do the same thing now.  \n\nThe idea that hunters can act as a replacement for wolves is \nover-simplifying the relationship.  Hunters operate in a different way and \non a different scale.  For one thing, human hunters tend to favor large, \nstrong prey, and particularly males, as hunting trophies, therefore \nactually selecting AGAINST the healthiest individuals of the population, \nwhile wolves target the young, old, weak, and sick.  Humans don't hunt \nterritorially, so deer are picked off at random rather than establishing \nspecific areas.  And finally, humans don't live as an integrated part of \nthe eco-system, and so aren't as responsive to it as a species that is a \nnatural inhabitant.  The area has taken thousands of years to develop the \nmechanisms on which it now operates, and an incomplete human understanding \nof it makes them imperfect replacements for a keystone species.

(elk, actually)\nThird. I know what the point is. The point is that Americans are programmed \nto believe whatever they are told to believe, especially if it's by a guy \nwith a British accent. Thank you, David Attenborough.\nBut if you DID actually think about it, you might ask yourself, If the \ndeer(elk) were leaving certain areas because of wolves, did the wolves just \nstay there and wonder where all the deer(elk) went? Or did they go where \nthere was venison? Also, Bears like a bit of venison every now and then \ntoo. And Bears don't *have* to depend on wolves for a meal. Bears and \nwolves aren't exactly playmates.\n\nI'm not saying that wolves had no effect on this environment. Of course \nthey did, they are apex predators. But what I am saying is that maybe there \nwere other factors unrelated to the wolves.\nBut since \"the point\" is to show what a difference one species can make, we \nmay never know what those other factors were. And we can't predict what \nwill happen when the wolves become overpopulated and the deer(elk) \npopulation dwindles.  \n99% of all species that have lived on this planet are extinct. The vast \nmajority before humans ever stood on two legs. And yet the planet has done \nquite well.",

                "text": "\"Conflict management starts with self management.\"   And how does \nself-management affect others?   The short video \"How Wolves Change Rivers\" \nis a wonderful example of how small changes affecting one species changed \nan entire ecosystem.   When the wolves came back, although few in number, \nthe deer started avoiding certain places.  As a result, trees and grasses \nthat had been over-grazed multiplied.   Rare animals like weasels and \nbeavers began to thrive.  And eventually the river stabilized and flowed \ndifferently.   If you need a shot of hope that change is possible, and \nsmall steps can make a difference, take a break for four minutes and view \nthis!   \ufeff",

And yet...there *must* be wise ways we can geo-engineer solutions \nalong the same lines as re-introducing wolves into Yellowstone. \n\nAn example is a UK project that exemplifies what I think of as \"wise\" \nengineering: The Medmerry Coastal Realignment Project. To reduce flooding \nfrom storm surges, rather than make the seawall higher (traditional \nengineering), they decided to bust a hole in the seawall and create a new \nwetlands area. It absorbs storm surges and reduces the risk of flooding for \na huge surrounding area.\n\nSource: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24770379\n\nThe domino effect from this tiny change will likely be large, and, \nhopefully, positive, because it works with natural forces in a wise way, \nrather than working against them.\n\nBut on a macro scale like climate change, you are entirely right. We humans \ncan often engineer (think) our way out of micro problems. But macro, \nsystemic, structural problems? We simply don't possess that level of wisdom \nand enlightenment. ",

Vegans cannot. They avoid all animal \nprotein and thus they are unhealthy. There is no plant source of vitamin \nB12 on this planet, only herbivores make it with help from the special gut \nflora that has to be in an alkali environment. Omnivores and carnivores are \ntoo acidic to support it and nothing can change that. Our physiology does \nnot support veganism, and it actually reacts poorly to vegetarianism, but \nat least the latter gets some of the essential mineral.\n\nI believe in harmony, and how can we, as a species, be harmonious at all if \nwe do not take from the lessons of our fellow Earth creatures. To think \nkilling for sustenance is evil, implies that innocent animals are evil. And \nanother thing, last time I checked plants were alive, when did this change? \nI laugh when people throw the \"morality\" in my face because how moral is it \nto reject the flesh of one organism because it moves and makes noise, but \nthen devour the flesh of another organism that is defenseless and cannot \nmake noise audible to human ears?

No, sir, you leave the Earth Mother \nalone, she is what gives life to all and keeps the balance.\n\nHumans are supposed to be guardians of the Earth, but instead, money makes \nthem thieves and rapists who take and have their way with her when they \nplease. A woman is not a whore if men force themselves on her. Leave her \nalone and balance can be maintained. Work with nature, don't try to control \nit, it is a mere illusion.",

There are some who \nbelieve that Aliens came down to Earth and used Humans as slaves to create \nastonomical landing points on Earth, such as the Pyramids,etc.  It is \nthought that while they were here they mated with Humans and instilled \ntheir beliefs in the human psyche.  It was shortly after this that it is \nhypothesized that Humans went from being a more peaceful maternalistic \nculture to a more war-mongering paternalistic one set out on destruction of \none another.  It is also thought that our belief in God and his eventual \nreturn and a life away from Earth comes from this coexistemce in which \nHumans were told that the Aliens would be back to take them with them one \nday.  I remeber I had an argument with a person who advocated such an idea \na long time ago,  Shortly after I mentioned this idea to a Professor of \nBiology at a well known University who told me there was no evidence to say \nthat this did not occur.    \nhttp://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/godseden/godseden.htm#English_Version_ \n ",

They eat small mammals such as (depending \non the region in which it lives) voles, prairie dogs, eastern cottontails, \nground squirrels, mice, birds, snakes, lizards, deer, javelina, and \nlivestock, as well as insects and other invertebrates. The coyote will also \ntarget any species of bird that nests on the ground.\u201d\nThe wolf diet :\n\u201cThe gray wolf generally specializes in vulnerable individuals of large \nprey. In Eurasia, many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on \nlivestock and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild \nungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the \nmost important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of \nEastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, \nwisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. [\u2026] \nAnimals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, \nwhite-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American \nbison, muskox and caribou.\u201d\nDo you see not some difference of scale between the preys of coyotes and \nthe preys of wolves ?\n\nAnd yet still, even though coyotes usually prey on animals much much \nsmaller than men, wikipedia mentions that :\n\u201cYet, confirmed reports of coyotes killing a human have been documented.\u201d\nAnd here is their source :\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coyotes-kill-toronto-singer-in-cape-breton-1.779304\n\nSo, coyotes whose normal preys are way smaller and weaker than humans still \nsometime do kill humans, sure wolves that hunt much bigger preys than \ncoyotes would definitely never ever kill humans, lol.\n\nAnyway, you seem to be totally missing the point. Which is \u201cSeems like we \nhumans did much worse than what the deers did. Maybe we should purposefully \nget ourselves killed by predators for more awesome biodiversity ?\u201d.

                "text": "And now I want to share with you one of the most interesting short videos \nI've seen in a while. It's about the idea of *trophic cascades:* how a \nsmall change to an ecosystem can lead to tremendous consequences. In this \ncase, the change was the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone in the \n1990's, after a 70-year absence.\n\nThe direct effects of the wolves were small: the wolves eat a few deer, but \napart from that mostly keep to themselves. But the indirect effects were \nhuge.\n\nIt started because the deer, who had been running roughshod over the entire \npark, quickly figured out that places like valleys were *not good places* \nto be a deer when there are wolves about. This led to trees being able to \ngrow in those areas for the first time in decades.\n\nThe effects of that are complex and profound, and I encourage you to watch \nthe video, because I can't possibly summarize it better than it does. \nEverything from the animals to the plants to the very physical geography of \nthe rivers was changed. \n\nThe key lesson of this is that ecosystems are connected. You can't make a \nsingle change to one and expect it not to have consequences, including very \nfar-reaching ones of a sort you couldn't ever have predicted. This is a \ngeneral property of all large, strongly-interacting systems, including \nsocieties, and it's worth keeping in mind whenever things change.\ufeff",

I saw \nthat in a conversation up there and can't remember who it was between but \npeople are of the opinion that 1) humans are the only species that has fun \nwhile hunting or hunts for sport, and that 2) herbivores are vegans. \nNeither is truth.

                    "text": "+Darren Pellichino Yes, we do still retain traits that are shared with \nanimals, that will never go away, but human emotion is a far cry from \nanimal. Animals do indeed have emotion, theirs is very different than that \nof the modern, spoiled people, however. Better to look at humans who live \nin the wild to see natural human behavior. They are too busy surviving to \nact like idiots over stupid things like hot celebrities and such who hoard \nmoney while people around them starve. Those wild people help feed each \nother, instead. Much like other primate species.\n\nIt's more a matter of domestication, the more domesticated a dog is, the \nworse off it is in the wild, but it maintains its innocence in thought, it \ncan also learn to cope and survive if lost in the wild. The more domestic a \nhuman is, the more privileged and greedy they become and they lose all \nability to survive without being pampered to smithereens. There will always \nbe exceptions to these examples, as everything is unique in both physical \nand mental behavior and appearance.\n\nSecond, because secondly is incorrect, is that they do not backstab. They \nfight for dominance and territory. You would never see an animal hurt its \nown community members to slow an enemy down. Nor a member turning on one or \nmore for some sort of monetary or like gain. You will only see fighting for \nalpha status, which is not the same thing. Your example was not a backstab. \nThere was no friendship or social connection between the two species, they \njust didn't feel like fighting the bear and the bear knew exactly what they \nwere doing. You put someone chasing all of those animals, they will all \nrun, the bear won't attack the wolves to make the enemy focus on them \ninstead, that would be a backstab of sorts. But even then it does not count \nas they are completely different species who have different languages and \nsocial behaviors.\n\nThere really is no twist, you cannot compare animal behavior to modern \nsocietal behavior because 1st world humans are so far from nature they \naren't even a part of it. 3rd world generally have a more survivalist \nbehavior system, with the absolute wild humans behaving the most like other \nprimate species but utilizing tools and weapons that separates them from \nmere animals.\n\nAnd last, it's *you're.

Elaborate \ncommunication is needed to become friends on our level.\n\nBest example....Grizzly bear decides to hang with wolf pack when they go \nout for hunt.

They are responsible for the \ndecline just as much and have caused just as much trouble for humans if not \nmore. Of course, damage by wolves seems unavoidable seeing as ranchers seek \nthe lands that are now dwindling.... Don't forget overgrazing is a thing, \nall for a steak or two for you or me.

After \nan absence of 70 years their reintroduction in 1995 has helped the park to \nregenerate..\nThe grasslands of the valleys and the gorges started to regenerate, trees \ngrew taller, forests returned and the number of birds increased. Beaver \nnumbers started to increase which provided habitats for other animals such \nas ducks, otters, fish, frogs and other reptiles. \nIt\u2019s a great story which culminates in changing the physical geography of \nthe park and demonstrates how everything is interconnected.\ufeff",

Just the same as they are different from the \nalready native foxes, coyotes, bears, and others.  The lions or tigers \nwould not target the same animals.  They would behave differently.  They \nwould have a completely different effect.  That is why it is always \nimportant to prevent extinction or local extirpation of certain species, \nbecause once they are gone they can not truly be replaced.",
