Then when you get older and realize C is \nsuperior, it is hard to know what 20 degrees C *feels* like. As someone who \nhas taken chemistry and physics courses, i would always choose C over F. \nBut, in normal everyday life i'd rather use F, because i know what 70 \ndegrees F feels like, but not 21 C.\ufeff",

Metric and Celsius makes more intuitive sense for all \nof us (we're all British except for one who is American) but, from what I \ncould ascertain, we all understood why Fahrenheit could appeal to some \npeople, it's just that we didn't share the same point of view. Metric is \neasy to convert in your head because it's all just powers of 10, so just \nadd or take away zeroes as needed. And Celsius make it so much easier to \nconvert to Kelvin, plus the \"extra whole numbers\" that Fahrenheit can offer \nmake little difference since the average person can't usually notice a \ndifference equal to or smaller than 0.5 degrees C so in everyday terms you \nusually estimate temperatures to 1 or 2 degrees C, therefore 71 F *feels* \npretty much the same as 72 or 73 F.",

                    "text": "+RespectAuthorita I agree that Fahrenheit gives you a more exact whole \nnumber value (90 F and 91 F vs 32.2 C and 32.8 C) but as someone who has \ngrown up using Celsius in daily life as well as within a scientific \ncontext, I don't think that a single degree Fahrenheit makes enough of a \ndifference in terms of what it feels like. Going by the conversion, a \nchange in 1 degree C is equivalent to a change in 1.8 degrees F. In my \ndaily life if I'm talking about the temperature I will usually give a range \nof a couple of degrees C, \"It's nice and warm today, I'd say 21 or 22 C\".\n\nSo what I'm trying to say is that while F can give a more precise value, in \neveryday life it's not really necessary because most people can't pinpoint \nsuch small differences in temperature without a thermometer. You'd only \nneed that many significant figures in a scientific context, where you'd \nprobably end up using C and converting to K anyway.\n\nAs you said, it comes down to what each individual can best relate to. \nThough I must admit it would be easier if we could all agree on a single \nscale (or else get incredibly good at performing the conversion in our \nheads) because, while on the internet it's easy to let Google convert the \nunits, in a daily conversation on the street I have no concept of whether \n70 F is closer to 10 C or 30 C (I just checked, it's pretty much in the \nmiddle, at 21.1 C).",

Most of the world uses Celsius, and I'm \ninterested in getting to know more of the world. The way I learned to think \nin Celsius is by picking landmarks and assessing relative temperature from \nthere. 0\u00b0C is cold as balls, 10\u00b0C is pretty chilly: early Spring or late \nFall day in Washington, evening or night in Summer. 13\u00b0C is where I happen \nto feel most comfortable - I'm a cold/temperate weather kinda guy. 21\u00b0C is \nroom temperature. 30\u00b0C is high Summer. Anything above 31\u00b0-32\u00b0C is very \nuncommon in Western Washington. Of course, living in Western Washington, I \nwould use Fahrenheit to talk about the weather, but it is very rare that I \never find myself having little enough to do to justify talking about the \nweather. As far as I'm concerned, the only difference between Celsius and \nFahrenheit when it comes to convenience is that Celsius has two prettier \nlandmarks: 0\u00b0 is water's freezing temperature and 100\u00b0 is water's boiling \ntemperature. So I learn both and use whichever one the people I'm talking \nto will better understand.\ufeff",

However, I do think, as a linguist, that some \nimprovements could be made to second language education:\n\nSo much of the focus in second language education, at least in many \ndeveloped nations, focuses on major languages: English, Spanish, Mandarin, \netc... This is valuable, but I feel that language education should work \nmore to handle locally relevant languages, such as immigrant or indigenous \nlanguages that kids can encounter in the wild locally. This would provide \naccess to native speakers to practice with and could elevate the status of \nminority languages and possibly even be a foot in the door for bilingual \neducation for minorities. No nation is monolingual, and you should be able \nto find a number of languages spoken in most areas of the world (indeed, \naround the world, multilingualism is the norm -- go to India, China, the \nPhilippines, virtually anywhere and you'll find very complex linguistic \nsituations).\n\nThis isn't necessarily an easy proposal. The smaller languages I'm talking \nabout often don't have a lot of documentation or teaching materials, and \nthere are many cases where you may encounter resistance from the very \npeople whose languages you are trying to promote, but I think overall this \npolicy could lead to healthier ideas about language.\ufeff",
