So one could easily play gb, gbc, gba, nes, snes, sega \ngenesis, etc. Plus the games are all available in digital roms ready for \nplay. So you have access to the complete collection and you dont have to \nworry about whether a game is good or not as the game is free.\ufeff",

Because of a lack of space, I switched to running roms from my Wii's \nSD drive. I think that's the best way to play classic games, since the Wii \noffers so many controller options and runs most roms for the NES/Sega/Snes \nwith no problems. It also let's you play those old pixelated games on a \nmodern tv with no blurring.\n\nOf course, that's for \"classic\" games. Games from the PSX era on you should \nreally just own. Most are pretty cheap (except for games like Tomba, IQ., \netc.) and are much more fun and creative than the crap you have on Xbone or \nPS4",
