You may also \npurchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have \nbeen born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them \non to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves \nlike this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated \nthis way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)\"\n\nI have sooooo many other quotes to share with you =D Just ask.\nOh, and since you have such a paltry understanding of both science and your \nown bible, this quote is from *deuteronomy*. This was made (according to \nyour folk tales) at the same time as the 10 commandments.\n\nPS, \"pagan\" only means that to you. It means exactly what the dictionary \nsays to everyone else.",

(why you and that other \nguy chose non-existence rather then existence is beyond idiotic, but I will \nroll with it) I will repeat what I have already said on the matter:\n\n\"Unfortunately, I am unable to prove that something does not exist with no \nevidence other then circumstantial or personal testimony. I once tried to \nprove the tooth fairy didnt exist... I was unable to do so, so \nunfortunately you will have to continue believing in the tooth fairy, \nfather Christmas, Thor, god and spontaneous combustion.\nOr you could google \"scientific method\" and join us in the post \nenlightenment ;)\"\n\nHow can you not accept that previous post? do you actually understand the \nprocess of how evidence leads to facts?!\n*loud shouty voice* There is no credible evidence on the matter, hence it \nis not real!",

I'll try to find it but it was fascinating. \nthe Gist is that the Idea of SHC came from Fire inspectors in the 20's \ntraced some fires to entirely recognizable corpses. This meant they \nappeared to be roasted from the inside out, quickly. This was wrongfully \ndescribed as the \"spontaneous combustion of a human\". People got the wrong \nidea of what was happening. \n\nThe reason corpses in certain fires look like a whole roasted pig, is \ncaused by \"the Human wick effect\" which is when a fire is hot enough to \nrender the fat from under your skin and set it on fire. The Human is \ncombusting quickly, sustaining the flame too. But the fire is always from a \nforeign source.",
