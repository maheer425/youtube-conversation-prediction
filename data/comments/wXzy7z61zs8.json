Later in life they keep \nconsumming drugs while becoming highly salaried Yuppies who pay enormous \namounts of money to city drug traffickers, who later pay to Mex and \nColombian cartels which receive an smaller but substantial cut of the \nmoney. The cartels receive also all the finger pointing and the \nself-righteous accusations.\n-\nBut those fucking white yuppies who pay for the drug are the main guilty \nones, they feed the market and feed the crime.   Or who is the worst \nsinner?  The ones who pay to fulfill his crave for sinning, or the ones who \nsin to get some payment ?\ufeff",
