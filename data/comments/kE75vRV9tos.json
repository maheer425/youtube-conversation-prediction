Condiment/Cookie Cutter Pancakes: Don't try this with plastic cookie \ncutters... or, try them freehand!\n6.  Stuck Tape: Also, just turn the edge under a tiny bit when you finish.  \n5.  Pine Scented Air:  That's great for forced air systems.  For the rest \nof us, candles work well.\n4.  Frosting In Squeeze Bottle: LOVE This idea!! I'm gonna try it this \nyear.  \n3.  Storing Lights: You can also use a rolled up newspaper or magazine, and \nwrap the lights around those.  I've been using the same ones for years. \n LOL!\n2.  Easy Chocolate Swirls: Fancy!  I like it!\n1.  Reused Gift Wrap: Good idea for a thank you, true... but, isn't this \nalso a good way to make next year's gift tags?  You could also re-purpose \nthose cookie cutters by using them to outline the cardboard.  \ufeff",

Turning the edge under means a folded, weird looking, folded edge on the \nwrapping. Like he said \"It doesn't effect the tape\"\n5. I don't see any problem that you mentioned, but you could use a candle. \nOr just spray a paper towel with the scent and wipe the inside of the tree. \n4.Me too, I never thought of that :)\n3. that could still get kind of tangled if you do it wrong, what you should \ndo is take a twist tie and wrap the lights around your hand, every time you \ngo once move the twisty tie around it so it is only holding one side, so as \nto not get tangled. \n2. I like it too, you could also add some caramel. \n1. You could do that for next year's gift tags but don't you think you'd \nforget after 365 days?

As you've clarified, though, \nyou probably still are a bitch, if you're afraid of something simple like \nwrapping presents, baking cookies for someone, making pancakes, etc - \neither that, or your not comfortable enough with your masculinity to do so \n(which is sad.  Very sad).  And while I haven't spent much time in a hood \nrecently (at least not since moving out of one to grow up in a safer \nenvironment than the one in which I lived in), being \"a bitch\" has nothing \nto with what was posted by KoR.  I routinely have issues with the fucking \ntape while wrapping presents.  The bread clip thing is genius.  If you \nthink that a man who does any of the activities listed in the videos is a \n\"bitch\", you're not a real man.  Also, I'm not your \"nigga\".  And \ntechnically, you aren't either.  Cheers, and have a nice holiday season, \ntxhen1.",
