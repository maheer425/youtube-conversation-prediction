                    "text": "+AnimalWonders Montana Hi! I just downloaded your audio and took a look at \nit and I have some suggestions to clean it up a little bit.\n\n1. You can filter out most of the really low frequencies (anything below \n50ish Hz). There aren't a lot of these in this video, but there are some \nsporadic pops that you can edit out with a high pass filter.\n\n2. You can use a limiter to boost the volume of quiet sounds in relation to \nthe loud ones. This will generally make the audio sound more even \nthroughout.\n\n3. Make the audio mono instead of stereo. At one point in the video all of \nthe sound on the right side cuts out. If you change it to mono that won't \nhappen.\n\nThese are really minimal changes, but they could make a big difference and \nshouldn't be too hard to carry out. Hope this is helpful!",
