The \nwhite boba is just made from a different material and I do like it. The \ngreen tea milk foam is also one of my favorites from Gong Cha, and it is \nmost definitely not \"gross\". It's kind of really offensive to hear things \nlike \"that is also gross\" and \"why would anyone like this\" when it is \nactually really good stuff that lots of people enjoy. I respect a \ndifference of opinion but please don't make it seem like people who enjoy \nthese are bad. It's an acquired taste, like all food, and it's a huge part \nof my culture that I really wish people would not put down, because now, \npeople who watched this video and have never tried these drinks are going \nto go into places like Gong Cha with a preconceived bias that wintermelon \ntea and the herbal jelly and white boba tastes bad. I'm extremely \ndisappointed because I really enjoy and laugh along with most of the \neatyourkimchi videos, but this one just hurts me. It's hard not to take it \npersonally when a huge part of your childhood is being made fun of and put \ndown. \ufeff",

Stuff like herbal jelly \nor grass jelly may seem odd to you when you're not accustomed to it, but \nyou should always keep in mind that there are probably MILLIONS of people \nwho enjoy the flavour and a culture that has enjoyed it for many years. To \nsay it 'is just gross' turns people off trying something new, and is kind \nof insulting to the people who do like it.\n\nSo what if it isn't for you? Yes, it's your opinion but stating it like \nthat as if you know better, as if you're teaching people what to pick/what \nnot to pick because you *clearly* know what's 'good' is not very nice or \nrespectful.\n\nIt's like saying 'earl grey tea is gross'. Or 'black coffee is gross, don't \never order black coffee. Coffee should always be super milky and sweet' - \njust because you don't prefer something a certain way.\n\nI have friends who have really odd bubble tea preferences (200% sugar, \nhonestly), and others who have similarly odd coffee orders, but that's \ntheir preference, and I would never advise someone else 'oh don't get what \nshe's having - it's disgusting', 'cause just that's kinda rude, immature \nand insensitive. :/",
