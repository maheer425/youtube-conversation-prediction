                    "text": "Okay, so here's my theory based on theory comments above/below.\n\nPuppy cat is the space-out-law who was transformed into a \"horrible \nmonster\", (his current form), hence temp-bot saying \"you look different.\" I \nthink Bee is the Space princess. I think the princess changed her \nappearance and wiped her memory of all events that happened, and created \nher new persona, Bee. The reason Puppycat fell out of the sky onto Bee is \nbecause he was looking for the princess. When he realized Bee was the \nprincess, he got mad at her father for the way she was now living, because \nhe thought she deserved better. When Bee stated she ran out of food money, \nPuppycat felt bad for her, and got the temp job. Pulling evidence from the \nnext episode, you can see that Puppycat puts up with bee's silly ness, even \nif he doesn't like it, because only the people you love will put up with \nyou like that. Evidence I have to support bee being the princess is the way \nshe rushed to help him without thinking. She didn't hesitate to help, and \nthis may have been just because it would be wrong to just stand there, but \nbee had said \"I'm going to kill you,\" showing she really cares for puppy \ncat. The evidence I have for Puppycat being the out law is the outlaws \nhairstyle, (cat ears), and the fish, Wallace, talking about it not being a \nfairy tail. (\"I knew it was you, pretending it's just a story, lying to \nchildren, and making him look up to a hero that, in reality, is just an \nawful monster.\") \n\nThis is just a theory, (head cannon), I put together with other peoples \ntheory's and facts from the episode. Tell me what you think, and if I have \nand holes I can fill in. Open to suggestions. :)",

That's why it's \ncalled a magical transformation.\n\nAlthough you may not know what's going on, the main character of this story \ndoesn't know either, it did happened suddenly but her reactions are due to \nher personality which, from the beginning have been placid no matter what \nshe's facing in her life (except for her crush, which is understandable).\n\n Not to mention how vague you are being with what you wanted in the show, \nnot everyone shows the same interest in a show and not everyone who likes \nit is on tumblr.

I can't even tell if she's supposed to be chubby or if it's \njust, like, anime inspired chibi stylization. There's a lot less contrast \nand subtlety to the design now. She's kind of just...a bunch of clunky \nrounded off squares and huge circular hair. It's also kind of off-putting \nthat she looks so young now, I was kind of digging the aimless 20-something \nlook. But that's just my opinion! Feel free to disagree. Also calling \nsomeone gross is rude. :U\n\nExtra weight on a character can totally work for a design - look at Greg, \nSteven, Amethyst, and Rose in Steven Universe. They've got lovely designs. \nBut something about Bee just feels off, I suppose. :0\n\n ",

That's \nwhy he's always calling people peasant and demanding that they bow to him.\n\nThe outlaw is a good guy, only an outlaw because he defied the evil king \n(Puppycat).\n\nThe story goes like this--- and yes, I'm certain.\nThe King (Puppycat) did not want to give his daughter away to the outlaw.\nSo, he tried using his warlocks to deceive the outlaw into being trapped.\n\nThe outlaw's sense of betrayal turned the magic on the King and his \nwarlocks, turning them all into monsters.\n\nTHIS is why Bee dreams of multiple Puppycats- the warlocks were also \nturned; those are them.\n\nPuppycat is the bad guy. This is why he slits Bee's wrists in her dream.\nThis is why he tortures the cicada. This is why he smacks a crow out of its \nnest. This is why he tries to buy an arsenal at the store.\n\nThe other puppycat monsters in Bee's dreams are the King's warlocks, whose \nmagic turned on them.\n\nThe demon pretending to be Wallace in Fishbowl Space was one of the King's \nwarlocks. He calls Puppycat a liar because Puppycat is claiming it was the \noutlaw who was turned into a monster, when it was really the king and his \nwarlocks.\n\nThe reason that Puppycat is pursued by his warlocks is because they blame \nhim for turning them into monsters.\n\nThis is because the warlocks weren't all in favor of the King's plan, but \nhe forced them into it.\n\nWhen Puppycat sees a reflection of the outlaw in the end of the pilot, he's \nnot looking at his own reflection wistfully... he's looking at it \nspitefully... because he's ruminating.\n\nThe plot follows Puppycat as Bee makes him a better person over time.\n\nI'll bet money that everything I'm saying is correct.",

Considering the influx \nof fans and tons of fanart and excitement for this pilot when it came out, \ncompared to the disapointed reactions for the newer episodes i think they \ncould bounce back ten fold if they went back to this tone and style for the \nshow. Everything from the animation, Bee's characterization and appearance, \nthe random surprise of walace, puppycat's backstory. I get the slow build, \nbut episodes that seem random should give us information into a deeper \nbackstory, even if it feels vague. Kind of like the way it was done in this \nepisode, wallace gave information (aside from the song) and it was even \nimplied the evil wizards in disguise may be out to kill puppycat. But in \nrecent episodes i felt they didnt do enough of that information giving. If \nyou look at episodes of steven universe you get those random episodes but \nthere is usually some point in them, they arent entirely random but give \nyou subtle clues about a deeper plot. I guess its only 2 episodes in, so it \nis early still so maybe that aspect is still being built. Still, i miss the \ntone of this pilot. That first scene in the rain everything about that had \nme hooked. That is the tone i feel is missing. The continuing series, its \ngot the goofy childish parts but its missing that cynical mature side to \nbalance it out. And the animation they have here and the art style just has \nits own unique vibe about it, i wish they didnt trade it in for that steven \nuniverse esque style they have now.",

Bee and puppycat is coming out THIS fall. So stop getting impatient, I \ntook around a year to make. Animations, even small ones, take a LONG time. \nEven a few measly seconds can take a few weeks. They're giving 5 minutes! \nAlong with developing a PILOT into a SERIES. Most pilots are very different \nthen finalized series. \n\nYou ppl suck. Learn to think. You think you wasted five dollars?

(same when Bee gets the Puppycat costume during fishbowl space.) \nBut then i found that when Bee is having the dream she says \"this makes me \nfeel so sad\" which may mean she is upset for telling her father (the king) \nabout puppycat also the dream represents escape because the puppycats have \nto jump of to ESCAPE. When Bee and Puppycat teleport to temp he says \"you \nlook diffrent to puppycat\" which is interesting and then after Bee gets her \ncash she says that she will help him with a better ending which means that \nshe will even it out.

                "text": "Okay, so here's my theory based on theory comments below.\n\nPuppy cat is the space-out-law who was transformed into a \"horrible \nmonster\", (his current form), hence temp-bot saying \"you look different.\" I \nthink Bee is the Space princess. I think the princess changed her \nappearance and wiped her memory of all events that happened, and created \nher new persona, Bee. The reason Puppycat fell out of the sky onto Bee is \nbecause he was looking for the princess. When he realized Bee was the \nprincess, he got mad at her father for the way she was now living, because \nhe thought she deserved better. When Bee stated she ran out of food money, \nPuppycat felt bad for her, and got the temp job. Pulling evidence from the \nnext episode, you can see that Puppycat puts up with bee's silly ness, even \nif he doesn't like it, because only the people you love will put up with \nyou like that. Evidence I have to support bee being the princess is the way \nshe rushed to help him without thinking. She didn't hesitate to help, and \nthis may have been just because it would be wrong to just stand there, but \nbee had said \"I'm going to kill you,\" showing she really cares for puppy \ncat. The evidence I have for Puppycat being the out law is the outlaws \nhairstyle, (cat ears), and the fish, Wallace, talking about it not being a \nfairy tail. (\"I knew it was you, pretending it's just a story, lying to \nchildren, and making him look up to a hero that, in reality, is just an \nawful monster.\") \n\nThis is just a theory, (head cannon), I put together with other peoples \ntheory's and facts from the episode. Tell me what you think, and if I have \nand holes I can fill in. Open to suggestions. :)\ufeff",

They were paying for something they wanted. Yes, they \nshould of expected some changes to happen, but I don't think anyone \nexpected this.\n\nI'm not hating by the way, I love watching Bee and Puppycat, but I just \nwanted to give some of my feedback. \nThis comment may appear as hostile to some, but I just want to spread my \nopinions.\n\nIf their old \"pilot quality\" was too time demanding. then I'd rather wait. \nBest to wait for a good product than to have an \"ok\" one shoveled around \nevery month.\n\nTL:DR\nPeople who funded the project should have gotten what they payed for. Yes \ndesigns change from the pilot, but certain elements were favored and should \nhave stayed.\n\nMost fans would rather wait for good content than have \"Meh\" ones given to \nthem within a few weeks.\n\nMy message to Cartoon Hangover and the Bee and Puppy Cat team:\n\n  I'm not a butthurt fan. Your stuff is good, but elements from the pilot \nshould be involved in future episodes. Fans were excited off what they were \nshown, and they enjoyed it. The only logical reason I conclude from the \nchange would be time-restraints. (Being lazy etc)\n\nMany of us would want to wait for better content.

I think part of it is because I'm trying to convince myself the \npilot wasn't THAT amazing and I'm being too hard on the new stuff; but \nevery time I'm wrong and the pilot is as amazing as I remember it. For me \nit's not just the art either, there's a shift in the comedy from the odd \nnon-sequitor to complete randomness, the voice actors all have the same \nbored tone of voice (whereas if you listen to Deckard in the pilot it's \nclearly not that tone), and Bee's character has gone from zany and \nirresponsible, to stupid. \n\nI backed the kickstarter on the strength of the pilot, and what they have \nproduced is not necessarily a bad show, but not one I would have donated \n$130 towards. I also have an issue with how preemptively merchandised the \nshow is - like I'm wondering how much of the kickstarter went to the actual \nanimation (which at 9 x 5 minute episodes, will only be 45 minutes all up), \nand how much went to merchandising. As a perfect example, if you look at \nthe episode 3 comments, you can see Frederator plugs the Cleavage crab toy \na lot in the comments - not only do they already have a toy - on the day \nthe episodes released - but there's also a whole series of cleavage crab \nmerchandise available on their store site (and don't even get me started on \nthe backer rewards issue).
