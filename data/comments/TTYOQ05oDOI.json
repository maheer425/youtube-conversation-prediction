                    "text": "This is a warning to all non whites. White future earthlings are using the \ntime machine mentioned in the old testament chapter of Malachi for the \nexpansion and growth of the white race. They are supplying their white \nancestors with plague warfare weapons. They have murdered 100s of millions \nof Indians since 100 A.D. They had no choice. They can't defeat the \nChippewa's in war. Our main concern now is what those white future \nearthlings are doing in the sky. Write Chemtrails Conspiracy in the youtube \nsearch box. They are launching massive chemical warfare assaults. We have \nbeen warned about the whites by the Seven Fires Prophecy. Purification also \nrepresents RACIAL CLEANSING. Those white future earthlings are probably in \nthe process of exterminating all non whites. If you do not take this \ninformation seriously, you will be exterminated. Prepare for survival by \nstocking up on food, water, and weapons. It is about Atlantis. North \nAmerica is Atlantis. They destroyed our ancestors civilization at least two \ntimes. The first about 11,500 years ago when the Chippewa's Atlantis \ncivilization was located where Newfoundland is and about 200 miles to the \neast which is now a part of the Atlantic Ocean. After those white future \nearthlings destroyed the first Chippewa Atlantis civilization by seeding \nclouds to create massive rain storms, it forced the Chippewa's to migrate \nwest to near where the Great Lakes commence. However, 11,500 years ago the \nGreat Lakes did not exist. About 2,000 years ago the Chippewa's became \naware of the Seven Fires Prophecy. They responded by first sending out \nexploration parties east. They sailed the Atlantic Coast north to where \nUngava Bay is located in Labrador and Quebec. From there, they sailed east \nto Greenland. It took them about a week to reach Greenland from Ungava Bay. \nAfter reaching the southern tip of Greenland, they sailed to Iceland. It \ntook them about a week to reach Iceland from the southern tip of Greenland. \nFrom Iceland, they sailed to Scotland. It took them about a week to sail to \nScotland from Iceland. In all, it took the Chippewa's 3 weeks to sail from \nNorth America to Europe. In Europe, they are known as the Huns and Vikings. \nFor a period of possibly 1,000 years, the Chippewa's continued the contact \nbetween North America and Europe. They conquered the Roman Empire in the \n5th century. Around 1000 A.D. those white future earthlings again destroyed \nthe Chippewa's Atlantis civilization by seeding clouds to create massive \nrain storms. It created a massive inland lake. What remains today are \nHudson Bay, the Great Lakes, Lake Athabascan, Great Bear Lake, Great Slave \nLake, Lake Winnipeg and the incredible numbers of other lakes in Canada. \nTens of millions of Chippewa's were murdered. Just before 1492, a huge lake \nprevented the Chippewa's from the Alberta, Montana, and Wyoming region, \nfrom making their way east to the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the \nnortheastern part of the United States. By the mid 16th century, enough dry \nland appeared, it allowed the Chippewa's from the Alberta, Montana, and \nWyoming region, to make their way east to fight the white invaders. You \nmust prepare for survival now! Those white future earthlings are even \nlaunching massive chemical warfare assaults during nights. That is \nsomething you must carefully monitor. They may fool you. So it's extremely \nimnportant to monitor the nights for chemical warfare assaults. Prepare for \nsurvival. Those white future earthlings are not using the time machine to \ngive land to non whites. you should know already.\n\nThis is a warning to you white future earthlings. I will not stop warning \nnon whites about what you are doing. You have made yourselves very clear. \nYou will not stop intruding into my life. It don't matter anyway. I will \ncontinue warning all non whites about what you are doing and have done. You \nhave murdered 100s of millions of Indians and other non whites, especially \nblacks. You have made a terrible mistake by intruding into my life. It has \ncost the lives of many of your ancestors and your descendants. It has also \nled to the destruction of many white tribes. All for the love of land \n(GREED). You have put yourselves first. We have now surrounded you from the \nyour past and your future. We can eliminate your organization if we want. \nHowever, you know exactly what the represents. You have already let your \nancestors on to a misprinted ruse. And they believe it. We (our \norganization and that that belongs to you) know the truth. I'm nobody but i \nknow about you and your entity. I can have my way with you and your entity. \nImpressive for a nobody. It's very obvious you don't like it. That's to god \ndam bad. It has been pleasurable having my way with you and your entity.\n\nAnd this is a message to those who don't know what's going on. It's all \nabout the WWW or internet. White future earthlings are using the internet \nto communicate with people of this time. I'm responding. Those white future \nearthlings think so highly of themselves they claim they are gods. The time \nmachine fell into the hands of the worst kind of criminals imaginable. They \nare doing their utmost to paint a picture of everything being fine. They \nare liars. I'm nobody. I have no ambitions to be a leader nor a somebody. \nHowever, i know of that white entity from the future and what they have \ndone and are doing. That is everybody's concern. We have that white entity \nfrom the future surrounded from their past and their future. You figure it \nout. Follow the law. And don't believe their lies. They are liars. I expect \nmore of their childlike attitude. I'm nobody and i have to deal with a \nwhite entity from the future who know what my real ambitions are. They are \nnot political, military, or religious. You don't know but they do. And they \nhave great respect. And they have made a terrible mistake.",

Europeans north of the Mediterranean 500 years after the fall of \nthe Roman Empire benefited from the technology, metallurgy and science that \nwas created by Arabs, Chinese and Romans. Also Eurasia was spread out east \nto west in the same latitudes and were blessed by the horse, so trading and \nthe spreading of ideals made it a perfect place for civilization to \ndevelop, but the area (particularly among Europeans) war, greed, genocide, \nfamine was common place which created a arms race. Warfare was the driving \nforce for the development of industry and weaponry in Europe. Chinese \nInventors invented gun powder, guns, cannons, boat technology and most of \nthe Industrial technology that heavily influenced the \"European \nRenaissance\". Gun powder, guns and cannons were introduced by the Arabs and \nthe mongol empire. But later, a horrible management of European resources \ndepleted much of Europe of wood and other resources forcing Europeans to \nlook else where for new resources. Europe was in a failing system and \nwasn't self-sufficient, that's why they turned to looting other people's \nland and resources. \n\nIn the Americas, a lack of a beast of burden and the Americas is spread out \nnorth to south crossing different climate and topography which slowed the \nspread of ideals and innovations across the Americas. Neither the less, \nNative American people still managed to spread their ideals across the \nAmericas by relay trade networks and by large canoes and small boats that \ntraveled up and down the rivers and along the coast. The only beast of \nburden was the Lama and Dog that helped carry or pull resources on travois. \nMetallurgy developed in the Great Lakes region about 8,000 years (copper \nage and later iron age) and in the Andes about 4,000 years ago (bronze and \nalloy age). Natives built roads, cities, towns, villages, bridges, \ncauseways, irrigation etc. spanning regions across the Americas connected \nby drifting trade routes. Natives also were better at land management, \nfarming and the breeding of crops which produce several species of crops \nand their organic agriculture had little or no effect on the environment. \nNatives did have written language in Mesoamerica (particularly the Mayans), \nbut written language didn't spread much across the Americas because of the \nnorth and south layout of the Americas. But, the Natives across the \nAmericas did develop complex pictographs, Quipu (Inca), symbolism, \niconography, hieroglyphics and oral history to keep track of records and \nhistory. The Natives also developed sign language when they trade with \ntribes or nations with a different language. Natives were more advanced in \nsome areas, while Europeans were advanced in other areas. The exchange \nbetween the Western and Eastern Hemispheres changed the world for ever.",

Just like \nit's common to refer to British empire without differentiating with the \nEnglish empire. Which doesn't mean it's strictly correct (much like the \nNetherlands being called Holland).\n\nI guess I just agree with the historian Joseph Perez in the understanding \nof Spain.\n\nFor references of Portuguese of that era considering themselves Spaniards, \ncheck poet Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es (1524-1580)  \"Hablad de castellanos y \nportugueses, porque espa\u00f1oles somos todos\" (speak of Castilians and \nPortuguese, as we are all Spanish).\n\nOfficially, the first 'King of Spain' was Amadeo of Saboy, whilst the term \nand the unification of the Kingdom of Spain took place during Elizabeth II.\n\nI guess the name 'Kingdom of Spain'/ 'Spanish' is understood differently \ndepending who's judgement you follow, Spain's or England/France's... \nsimilarly, I doubt you'd convince people from Netherlands that their \ncountry is actually Holland just because foreign people call the country \nHolland.",

Portugal was not part of Spain until 1580 (then it was independent \nagain after 1640). Therefore you cannot say that he was \"King of the whole \nof Spain when he incorporated Portugal.\" That's fallacious since Portugal \nis not part of Spain, it's part of Iberia. The Romans called the whole \npeninsula Hispaniola but that was centuries before. \n\nJust because the Castillians had a monopoly on travelling to other parts of \nthe Spanish Atlantic doesn't mean that we can ignore the fact that other \nnations, mainly the English and the French, referred to the Castille-Aragon \nnation as \"Spain.\" You might think that term is inaccurate, and it is in \nsome way, but that doesn't make your assessment true. The reality is, most \nother European contemporaries of the late sixteenth century called it \n\"Spain,\" meaning that as observers of the past, we can safely call it by \nthe terms that contemporaries used. There's no \"one right answer\" to \ndefining the Spanish Empire, but if we use sixteenth century terminology in \nthis context then we at least get a better sense of how the people in the \npast thought about the term. To call it the Castillian Empire throughout \nthe early modern period would be to ignore the involvement of other \nnon-Castillians in the formation of a Spanish state and empire.\n\nI think you'd be hard pressed to argue that there was no such thing as a \nunified Spanish Kingdom until the 19th century. Most experts would \ndisagree. That logic would suggest that there was no such thing as the USA \nuntil after the Reconstruction Period following the American Civil War, \nwhich is not true.\n\nAlso, sources?",

(Trust me, you'll \nget no American bias out of John Green, that's for sure.) I'm assuming he \nsaid that to denote people of the past rather than modern Americans. As the \ncolonists back then were very different from modern peoples. Oh yes, the \nBritish Crown and authority did have favorable policies toward the Native \nAmericans, but not that favorable, as all of the Natives except for the \nIroquois sided with France in the Seven Years' War, and even the Iroquois \nmostly remained neutral, not aiding the British as passionately as the \nother tribes aided the French.\n          As for this so called \"reservation to the west\" I think you are \nreferring to the land proclamation of 1763, which (tried to have) kept \ncolonists from settling in the new lands acquired from France in the west. \nThis line, however was more to keep the colonies in a manageable size so \nthat the population could be protected from the Natives (whom all white \npeople of the time, save the French, considered savage, btw) by the British \nMilitary. Which was kind of them, disregarding the fact that the colonies \nnever had to be and never were protected by the British Military before. \nEven more: many natives protested this proclamation, as they already lived \neast of its borders, and the British authority was basically inviting \ncolonists to settle in their lands.\n            Yes, I will agree with you that the Revolution was put on by a \nlarge minority. However, loyalists were also a large minority and so were \npeople who were indifferent. American society was cut into thirds \npolitically.The actions of the British military didn't help. They seized \nprivate property, freed slaves (with the objective of hurting the southern \ncolonies economically, not with the goal of emancipation, as Britain was \nstill engaged in the slave trade at the time), and forced American \ncolonists to house troops. They did this indiscriminately, driving more and \nmore indifferent people to either extreme.\n             It was mostly the moderates and the extreme loyalists who \nstill considered themselves British. As the war dragged on, however and as \nthe British Authority continued to ignore American rights as Englishmen, \nless and less considered themselves British. The Brits lost the war in the \nSouth because they overestimated the amount of loyalists among the \ncolonists.\n             After the Revolution, the Loyalists were either driven out or \nleft out of their own will. Those who could afford to fled back to Britain, \nand those who couldn't went to Canada. Many returned later once the \nhostility died down and built fine lives for themselves as American-British \ncitizens. ",

The fact that \nJohn Green addresses the early colonists as 'English' (of which they were) \nrather than 'we' (Green and other Americans being the descendants of these \ncolonists rather than those who didn't make the trip and remain English \ntoday,) does highlight Andy's point that there is a sought of 'propaganda' \noccurring in the teaching of American history as the nation tries to \ndistance itself from the horrific genocide of the native population of an \nentire continent. A genocide of which was generally not practiced by the \nactual English authority. The English settlers spoke of in the video are \nexiles and are in no way representative of the actions of the English \npeople at large. However I would regard the actions taken by the British as \nan authority in North America in regards to relations between themselves \nand the native populace as more telling. The Indian reserve to the West of \nthe 13 colonies, the alliance with the Iroquois; The English (and later \nBritish) had a rather remarkable relationship with the natives compared to \nthat of the initial English Settlers (of which were largely exiles from \nEngland) who would later become the Americans as we know them today.\n\nSecondly I would like to dispute your claim in the latter half of your \ncomment. The revolution was waged by a (albeit large) minority. Way over \n50% of the population of the 13 colonies were either indifferent to the \nrebel cause or were loyal to the crown. Even more, including many of those \nstaunchly against the crown still regarded themselves British (English, \nScottish, Welsh, Irish). It wasn't until after the 13 colonies achieved \nsovereignty, and when the loyalist either fled, were murdered, or were \nassimilated into the idea of American statehood that a sense of national \nidentity distinct from that of their brothers to the North or over the \npond, emerged.\nKind regards, Joe",

The Pequot were \nalso instigators in the whole conflict.\n\nHowever, the British that attacked the village killed the women, children \nand elderly in a semi-battle despite the villagers setting themselves on \nfire (according at least to William Bradford) and burning down their \nvillage with them inside.  Judging by what we know about the Pequot, they \nwere a bit batshit insane.  Not saying they were completely wrong in their \nconflict with other tribes or the English (they were besties with the \nDutch) but although the Mystic Massacre was horrible, it wasn't some uneven \nbattle where the English slaughtered helpless natives.

In the Shadowrun universe, they took \nall of it back by force thanks to the revival of magic, which was strongest \nin native Americans who were closer to nature (A requirement to use magic \nin that universe.) It would likely require some supernatural force similar \nto that fictional one for it to happen.\n\nAnd it's way more complicated that it first appears, lots of grey in this \nmess. For instance, a lot of us, including me, have some native genes. I'm \na mix of about 80% French, 10% English and 10% Native American. All three \nfactions to which my ancestors belong brutally killed each other at some \npoint. So if there were to be a new war, which side should I be on? If any?\n\nWant my opinion? All the people who took direct part in this mess have been \ndead quite a while. The people who owe the natives an apology and their \nlands? Dead. The people who lost the lands? Dead. There is literally no way \nin which you or me could possibly be held responsible for their actions, we \nwere born long after the facts and nobody owes anyone anything. We really \nshould just try to get along and be friends. History is not about keeping \ntabs of who owns who what and appeasing dead people centuries after the \nfacts by spilling more blood and creating new grief and hatred, it's about \nlearning lessons and not repeating these same mistakes. The natives lost \nthe war. The French Canadians lost theirs. Then the Americans lost to the \nCanadians, etc etc and I hold no grudge, no hatred towards anyone who \ndescends from any of those guys. Why are some people upset about this stuff \nstill is beyond me.",
