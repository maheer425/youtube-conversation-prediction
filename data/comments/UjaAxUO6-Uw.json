When a particle \nis in superposition of being at two places, it means its wavefunction is \nspread at those two places. While being in superposition it behaves like \nit's at both places but as I said we can't gasp what's like being in \nsuperposition. It's out of our every-day experience. To say that the \nparticle itself is at both places simultaneously is not accurate, because \nafter all it's just a particle.

That means we caused the \nsuperposition to collapse, because of the two possible outcome we observed \none of them. But, if we put a secend layer of double slits between the \nfirst one and the detector, the same electron we'll be in superposition \nagain, and we'll have the same results at the detector.\n\nIn the Schrodinger's cat experiment, if we open the box, we observe the \nsystem and cause the superposition to collapse. But if the cat is alive we \ncan repeat the experiment and put the cat again in a superposition. If it's \ndead we can't repeat the experiment, because we can't bring the cat back to \nlife, so there will be no superposition.",

I was aware of the original thought experiment, \nthe one thing that confuses me is just this: the quantum state \n- superposition - collapses the moment it is observed, doesn't it? so, does \nthis experiment assume that once an isolated observer - the cat - dies, the \nsuperposition sort of recovers?

                    "text": "I 'd like to give a better explanation of the Schrodinger's cat experiment, \nbecause there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding. The great thing about \nths thought experiment is that we got for the first time quantum mechanics' \nproperties in our macroworld. First of all in order to understand the \nexperiment you need to be familiar with the term 'superposition'.\n\nSuperposition is a state of a particle (or system) that includes all the \npossible 'minor states'. For example, let's say a particle is in \nsuperposition of being at point A and point B. If we observe the system, we \nare going to find the particle at point A or point B. It can't be both. But \nbefore the observation the particle was not only at A, not only at B, not \nboth A and B at the same time, because it's just a particle, and of course \nnot at neither of them, because then it wouldn't exist. We say it's in \nsuperposition of being at A and B, and we can't quite gasp what is like \nbeing in that sate, but a good approach is being at both places the same \ntime. That's why you hear that in every pop-science video.\n\nNow, back to Schrodinger's cat. The original thought experiment wasn't that \nsimple. It included a trap inside the box which was triggered when the \nradioactive isotope stops emitting radiation. This is a quantum phenomenon, \nand obeys to the rules of quantum mechanics. So, at any given time the \nisotope is in superposition of emitting radiation and not to, as a result \nthe trap is in superposition of being triggered and not to, and finally the \ncat is in superposition of being alive and being dead.\n\nThat doesn't mean that every system which we don't know its outcome, exists \nat all possible outcome at the same time before we do the observation. The \nonly reason we say that the cat is both dead and alive is because it all \nstarted from a quantum phenomenon. This 'superposition state' exists only \nin the quantum world and that is what makes the difference between our \nevery-day-world and the microworld (the world of tiny particles)\n\nHope I helped",
