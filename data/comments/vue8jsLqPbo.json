                    "text": "+Cameron Seebach\n {You seem to be denying the evolution of new species}\n\nThis statement is one which cannot be responded to with the simplicity of \neither yes or no. That's due to the fact that a problem is caused by the \nword \"species\". In fact, within Biology, it's referred to as the \"species \nproblem\"\n\nNotice, I said that humans can't give birth to anything other than humans \nand the example I used for animals was that canines can't give birth to \nanything other than canines.\n\nNevertheless, a variety of different canines can be, and have been, \ndescended from a particularly specific canine. All canines have descended \nfrom Canis Lupus (Wolf). This is simply the result of micro evolution, \ni.e., variation...which does occur. Therefor, considering that Taxonomy \ncategorizes Wolf, Coyote, Fox, Dingo etc. as each one a distinct species, \nthen my response is, no, I don't deny the (micro) evolution of new species.\n\nHowever, evolutionists claim that \"speciation\" occurs, with the implication \nbeing that it proves macro evolution. Thus, whenever the word \"species\" is \nused in this manner, then my response is, yes, I do deny the evolution of \nnew species\n\nBut my two different responses to the same word is not causing the problem. \nBut rather, evolutionists are causing the problem by using the word \nspecies, while remaining oblivious to the \"species problem\"\n\nThis is what you need to know...evolutionists explain that whenever a \npopulation of organisms separate from a greater population, biological \nchanges may occur while living in a different environment. Thus, if members \nof the break away population attempt to interbreed with members of the \noriginal, parent population, they'll be incapable, due to the biological \nchanges. Or if they can successfully interbreed, but cannot produce viable \noffspring, then it is said, from either scenario, that \"speciation\" has \noccurred\n\nThis is the explanation of \"speciation\" and the same explanation is \npresented as the standardized definition of the word \"species\". However, \nthe problem is that there exist animals, such as, various species of \ncanines that can interbreed and produce viable offspring. Also, every \nexample presented by evolutionists as the occurrence of speciation, is \nmerely another occurrence of variation. The Salamanders are still \nSalamanders etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe fact is that the validity of \"speciation\" is completely dependent upon \nthe existence of a standardized definition of the word \"species\". No such \ndefinition exists and within the scientific field of Biology, this is known \nas the \"species problem\"",

It postulates that after a number of random mutations have become \npart of a greater population, a particular mutational morphologic change \nmay enable its recipient organism to survive a new, hostile environment \nthat has killed the entire rest of the population\n\nThe fact is, mutations are reproductive defects. Thus, they are not better \nsuited, than are correctly reproduced organisms, for overcoming life \nthreatening, biological adversities. Mutations are, themselves, a \nbiological adversity\n\nThis is why, for as long as man has been observing mutants within nature, \nevery time its been observed that they're the first to die. They don't \nsurvive even ideal environmental conditions...much less, conditions hostile \nto their species\n\nListen, everyone on Earth knows that there doesn't exist even one human \nthat can give birth to something other than a human. Every reproductive \nhuman can give birth to only another human and nothing else. It's a hard \nrule of Biology & it cannot be broken. Biologists know in detail, the \nspecific reasons why reproductive systems are subject to this hard rule\n\nTherefor now, consider a pair of human mates that reproduce, They, being \nhumans, are subject to this hard rule of Biology. Thus, they necessarily \ngive birth to a human. That offspring, being human, is also subject to the \nsame, unbreakable, hard rule of Biology. Thus, he necessarily reproduces \nanother human offspring. Now we're up to the third generation and the same \nhard rule applies to him because of his humanity\n\nYou can continue that reproductive line for thousands or millions of years \nand the results will never change because the cycle is one of continual \nself perpetuation.

Heck, I can't remember the last time I took an \nIQ test.\n\nSpeaking of which, don't even bother taking those free online IQ tests. \nThey're too easy to manipulate into giving you a higher score than if you \nwere to sit down with an official test from a panel of reputable \npsychologists.\n\nBack on subject.\n\nReading does help to expand your vocabulary and force you to be creative in \nimagining the story or information forming in your mind's eye. I did read a \nlot (in fact, I was reading and memorizing whole children's books when I \nwas only 3 years old), and I still do just to keep my imagination sharp, \nand I do so whenever I get the chance to.\n\nIf there is anything I am a genius at, it is at music, piano-playing, and \nstorytelling.\n\nAnd you could probably become a genius at understanding and contributing to \nthe field of studying psychopaths and sociopaths. You just have to keep \napplying yourself.\n\nTo me, the best indicator of genius in a person is that they are committed \nto learning something so much, no matter how daunting it gets, that they \neventually excel at it. To put it in perspective, it takes an average of \n10,000 hours to achieve expertise in any given field of study, even \nphysical fields like gymnastics and martial arts (speaking of which, I'm a \nBlack Belt in Shotokan karate and am currently teaching myself Chinese \nmartial arts).\n\nDon't let others' achievements be a reflection of your current status. You \nstay committed to what you want to excel at (or become a genius at), and \nmost likely, you will become one in due time.\n\nKeep up the hard work and study. ^_^",

For \ninstance, you probably never heard of Abdesselam Jelloul (who scored 198 on \nan adult IQ test), but you certainly heard of Albert Einstein (who would \nonly score 145 on the same test today).\n\nBottom line: your achievements will always stand out more than an IQ score. \nGo for the 200 score if that's what you desire. Just be sure to put your \nintelligence to use beyond a test and contribute back to the world.",

Thank you :)\n\nI learned english from watching television, it just clicked and made sense. \nThen I watch movies/shows with subtitles (I live in Sweden) both in swedish \nand english. Self-taught, in other words.\n\nDo you live in America? So I had A's in high school in english. It was the \nonly thing I was good at in school and excelled at with ease. I find the \nenglish language so easy to comprehend, of course I don't know all the \nwords in english.\n\nThat's why I like America, it's the only place on earth where I can perfect \nmy english skills and become better in english :P\n\nI can tell you what my desired goal is - 200+ IQ.

There is no 'perfection' in the universe. \nConcepts such as the 'set of integers' are merely practical methods of \nlimiting the complexities of our existence. They don't in fact exist. \nConcepts of thought such as ideologies, love, hate, independence, freedom, \netc. give us a sense of understanding without the burden of proof and so \nrely on our shared faith.\nUltimately all of these concepts are simply chemically induced structural \npatterns in the brain. The fact that we seem to share these concepts is \nless the proof that they are somehow self-evident, concrete facts and more \nlikely the result of the common physiological structure of our brains \nmanipulated by the common reactions of our senses to similar environmental \nfactors. Different environments have obviously resulted in very different \nenvironmental factors that contributed to actual physiological differences \nbetween our races.\nCommonly shared factors of thought and behavior, such as ideologies and \ncultures are what you might call 'higher' functions because they seem more \nsophisticated than those of what we consider more 'primitive' creatures. \nThey are intellectual constructs developed over a millennia of \ntrial-and-error struggles to survive and reproduce, which is nothing more \nthan you'd expect from the simplest of creatures.\nIn a very real sense we have 'gone over-board' by continuing to put our \nsurvival above the survival of any other species; we've forgotten how we \ngot here. Our most significant threat is now ourselves and our unbridled \nfear and obsession to survive well beyond our needs. There's actually a \nminority of humanity that we all have to worry about, the affluent, the \nreligious and to some extent, the intellectual (including the 'super \ngenious').\nThese Republitards, as I call them, whether they are money grubbing \na-holes, religious fanatics or simply the lower-intellect minions who long \nfor a better life and are fooled by the false profits of the latter two \ngroups into believing that if those groups succeed than their lives will \nsomehow become better as well, are the true bane of man's survival. You \nappear to be part of the minion, and as such, you are useless to this or \nany other discussion related to the superiority of man, his genius or his \nsurvival, and you will never 'see' the truth.",
