She acts... like she's \nreally dumb. Which wasn't the impression I got from the original character \ndesign (silly and easily distracted yes, but not stupid).\nIn the pilot puppycat was refined and haughty. Gave off the attitude of an \noffended royal, but with dignity. Now s/he's a spoilt brat, wrecking \npeople's houses and demanding expensive clothing. Acting more like a \ndemanding child then royalty.\n\nIf that's how the show is going to be from now on, fair enough. They have \nenough people to enjoy it. I just won't be one of them because I don't like \nmain characters that lack substance. Just a personal preference. ",

                "text": "why do people say the art quality has gone down the style just changed \nwhich happens in every cartoon pilot. the color palette is amazing I've \nnever seen a cartoon that capture natural light especially of dawn so well \nunless it was a super budget anime and still it never really left the same \nimpression as real life which here i think they did a good job . the \ndetails are great especially the background. they capture the whole \nambiance of relaxed calmness with the music. the pacing was good. just \nbecause puppy cat was slapstick in this one doesn't mean he'll be like that \nthe whole series (FYI  he was running their recipe cause Deckard called him \ncute.) this obviously wasn't a bee or puppy cat character development \nepisode but Deckards. who I love the fact that the gave him a lisp I \nstumble on words just like he does. the only thing I have to complain is \nthat I think that their lines are a tad bit to soft so the animation errors \nare more obvious but it goes well with the overall design i guess they were \nwilling to make sacrifices also bee was a tad bit too childish but I feel \nlike that her development will be kind of coming of age where its about her \nbecoming an adult final thing bee does now have a job she's just lying \nabout being unemployed how could anyone explain being an intergalactic temp \nagent thats how she was able to refurbish her apartment  \ufeff",

The humor was nothing like the \npilot and the designs seemed less polished. Not to mention the characters \nseemed, less interesting as a whole. Puppycat has been reduced to one \ncharacter trait and the plot for this episode was not interesting enough \nfor an opening episode.\n\n*BUT*- I feel completely confident that this show is *just getting started*. \nI expect it to pay off as the episodes continue.\nI'm still *very optimistic* that Bee and Puppycat will be a great show once \nall is said and done.\ufeff",

Like the backgrounds, I hated \nthe flat uninteresting backgrounds in the original. The costume designs in \nthe new one are also better over all. Just my opinion tho.    ",
