                    "text": "+Jordan Maynard\nJust to clarify, when you experience the effects of adrenaline you are \nbasically more alert. You pay attention to more detail, your senses are on \nhigh alert, and most importantly your reaction time is increased and \neverything in your body goes faster. So basically, because you are so aware \ntime SEEMS to go slower because it takes less time for impulses to travel \nfrom your sensors to your brain (and back again of course). This is why \nflies/mosquitoes can react quicker to things such as your hand trying to \nsquish it, because they are smaller and impulses have much less distance to \ntravel. This is also why flies live shorter lives because although for us \nit seems like 2 days is short. For them it may seem like months if not \nyears.\n\nHowever, what the scientists have done is conduct and experiment on \nEinsteins theory of relativity. According to Einstein TIME ITSELF slows \ndown for you (even though it feels like time is passing by normally) the \nfaster you go. This is not the way you perceive time but \"one second\" \nphysically becomes longer for you. They use what is called an \"atomic \nclock\" which is a special type of clock that detects the radioactive decay \nof a certain element (i think carbon) and uses this decay time as a \nmeasurement of time. I.e the time it takes for 1 gram to decay is equal to \na certain amount of time. The time it takes for 1 gram to decay however \nslows down the faster the atomic clock is moving.\n\nSo you confused perception of time with ACTUAL time.",

You already changed the past simply by existing. So to \nescape the time paradox, the changed timeline has to have exactly the same \noutcome as the original one. Therefore you have to reverse all changes; \nerasing yourself in the process and making your visit utterly pointless. \n(unless you find a way to send things or information to your original \nfuture without affecting your original present)\nAlso there is the whole matter of utilizing energy that was not in a usable \nstate at the appropriate time.\n\nBut there is a way out. You are able to create or erase the same amount of \nmatter and antimatter with no energy at all, because they cancel each other \nout.

                    "text": "+Trace Dominguez\n Atom excited -> the energy helps the electron with just enough energy to \ngo up an orbit but not break free of the atom -> strong force was holding \nit -> strong force quickly wins over the 'just enough' energy leading to \nbringing the electron back to its normal orbit -> energy is released in the \nform of light -> its the force at which the photon is emitted and its \nstructure that does not interact with most other stuff that ensures that it \nkeeps going at a constant speed through space.\n'If' an atom is made to go at the speed of light, it would mean that the \nstrong force won't be strong enough to bring the electron back to its \nnormal orbit and one can imagine that the electron would also not be able \nto change state. I imagine this phenomenon can be called as a Matter Freeze.\n'If' an atom is made to go at a speed that is slightly slower than the \nspeed of light then the strong force will win but at a slower rate and it \nwill take a long time for the electron to jump back to its normal state and \nthe light to be emitted.\nThis tells us how the time slows down for the atom going at a high speed. \nAnd in other words how it affected the speed at which it can change state.\nIn case of atomic clocks, the atoms whose resonance frequency is used for \nmeasuring time, resonate at a slower speed. But the clock as a whole is in \na single frame going at the same speed and thus every atom of which the \nclock is made of resonates slower and 'measures' slower. Thus, ISS clock \nticks slower compared to earth clock.\nBasically the speed affects the rate at which matter can change - change \ninstantly or freeze.\n\nTime doesn't really exists? - well, any system that changes state at a \nregular interval (absolute or perceivable) can be said to have time. Be it \nthe atoms' resonance frequency or the sun rise and sun set. In that sense \ntime exist. Its a property of a system, just like number is. Its the \nproperty that exist.\n\nI believe it would be fun to see the effect of speed on radioactive \nelements. The radio active decay would not happen after a certain speed. It \nshould be possible to calculate the speed at which that would happen.\n\nTime slows down for the 'thing' that is going at a high speed. Like in case \nof this German experiment the time slowed down for the ion that was going \nat the high speed. The ions environment i.e. instrument, lab, earth, solar \nsystem, milky way galaxy was going at the slower speed and was ticking at \nits own rate. Thus, your title of the video is misleading \"How scientist \ncan slow down time\", however an attentive person would figure out that \nscientist slowed down the time of a few ions. The title would have better \nbeen \"How scientist slowed down time for a few ions.\". That way people with \nnon scientist brain can understand the concept.",

Meaning you would teleport from where you reached it to the \npoint you slow down again, aka travel in time, because the universe aged in \nthe nonexistent meantime.\nThat's why photons exist as energy-only \"particles\" - there was simply no \ntime span between creation and impact.\n\nPlease correct me if i'm wrong.",

Time was \ninvented to help us break up the day, it doesn't actually exist. It's all \nabout our perception relative to each other. Measurement is relative. \n\nTheoretically, as I understand it, traveling at the speed of light your \nmolecules are changing state, water would melt, fire would burn, everything \nwould FEEL normal. If you were going 0.95 light speed and turned on a \nflashlight, it should still shine out ahead of you like normal at the speed \nof light, because it's not exceeding light speed relative to itself, only \nrelative to something stationary nearby.\n\nIf you were on the shuttle, you'd feel normal, just as if you were the \nstationary observer. But the way our devices MEASURE time will be altered \nRELATIVE to each other. Atomic clocks use a specific number of atomic \nvibrations to measure one second (an arbitrary measure of time). The \nvibrations in the shuttle clock atoms RELATIVE to the atoms in the ground \nclock would appear to vibrate the same if you're standing next to them, but \ndifferently RELATIVE to each other.\n\nSidebar: Technically, the clock on the ground is ALSO MOVING because the \nEarth is moving through space...

As such if say an atom goes at the speed \nof light then it has no chance to release energy and no chance to change \nstate and thus time doesn't tick for it. If you slow down the speed to half \nof the speed of light then it has chance to release energy and change state \nand thus it would perceive (if it can) time to tick but at a slower rate. \nSo the absolute universal time keeps ticking at its own pace, but its the \nspeed that controls the state change ( or age) of things.",

It is impossible for them to do otherwise, just as it is impossible \nfor particles with mass to travel at the speed of light.  Any time light \npasses through a material, what is actually happening at the quantum scale \nis that photons (moving at c) are being absorbed by the electrons around \nthe atoms in that material, the energy of which kicks them into an excited \nstate.  Those electrons then settle back into their ground state, releasing \na new photon, which travels (again at c) to another atom, repeated over and \nover.\n\nIn the \"freezing\" of light, what you do is shine a laser through a material \nthat is transparent (i.e. that passing of photons from atom to atom is very \nfast and easy and occurs in the same direction the light was originally \ntravelling, so the light doesn't scatter), but only under certain \nconditions.  Then, you change the conditions while the laser is going \nthrough so that the transparency shuts off.  This traps the electrons in \nthe excited state they were in at the time.  But while that is the case, \nthe light isn't in the form of photons; the energy is stored in the excited \nelectrons.  It doesn't become light again until those electrons are allowed \nto drop back to their ground state, releasing the energy in the form of \nphotons and \"unfreezing\" the light.",

However, it is capable of making other mechanism that \nare accurate. Atomic clock is a such a mechanism. I believe scientist are \nconfusing people :) Here is what I think it is. Understand what exactly is \ntime - if there is something that occurs at a regular period then the same \ncan be used to tell time. Humans started telling or perceiving time using \n(in increasing order of accuracy) (1) brain's internal clock namely \nsuprachiasmatic nucleus, (2) using periodic sun rise and sunset, (3) \nmechanical clock, (4) digital clock, (5) atomic clock.\n\nWhat effects does it have on the person: None\n\nSome more thoughts:\nImagine there was nothing that occurred at a regular interval and \neverything was chaotic. In that case there won't be any time! Which means a \nuniverse where there is space (or something equivalent) but no time - ah! \nno space-time, no time travel, no nothing! But that's not the case with our \nuniverse, many things are periodic i.e., deterministic and thus there is \nstuff and there is time. But, many things occur at different period, what \nwould be 'the time' against which all other time can be compared? Imagine \nthat there is one type of entity that is the smallest of all things we know \nand it has some property that occurs at a regular period, that would be the \nabsolute time of the universe. It also implies it keeps ticking on its own \npace and thus time can neither be slowed down or fast forwarded. Only thing \nthat can happen is travel time can be increased on decreased by increasing \nor decreasing the speed at which you go. But the speed is the key to \nslowing/increasing age of a thing. Note (a) light is emitted when energy is \nreleased from an atom. (b) things in motion stays in motion until you know \nwhen. That means if you throw something at a certain speed (i.e. at a \ncertain force) in to space where there is nothing to slow it down then it \nwill keep going at that constant speed at which it was projected. Combining \n(a) and (b) one can tell that the light has its speed because it is the \nforce by which energy is released from an atom. That implies that 'if' an \natom is made to travel at the speed of light then it cannot lose energy and \nit will remain in its original state. So 'if' a person travels 1 light year \n(distance) and come back he/she wouldn't have aged a bit because his/her \natoms had no chance to age. But it took 1 light year to go and 1 light year \nto come back i.e. time kept ticking, neither did it stopped nor did it \nslowed down. 2 light years time had passed by but his/her atoms had no \nchance to age so for him/her no time passed by and thus from his/her point \nof view time hadn't even ticked whereas the absolute universal time kept \nticking. If a person travels half the speed of light then his/her atoms \nwould have a chance to change state, which means he/she can perceive the \ntime to be passing and it would be a small bit. Thus its the speed that is \nthe key, time actually doesn't slow down.",

The heavier it \nis, the more energy you need to accelerate it.\nThe closer something gets to the speed of light, the more energy you need \nto accelerate it just a fraction further. For an object to reach the speed \nof light you would need infinite energy, because it would gain infinite \nmass.\n\nPhotons travel at the speed of light. Always. And photons are pure energy. \nYou can use both to calculate a certain mass. Yes. But this \"mass\" is a \nresult of their velocity.\nYou can not slow a photon down. It is impossible. You can only stop a \nphoton by direct impact. If a photon looses it's velocity, it gives away \nall of its energy and ceases to exist, because nothing is left.\n\nA photon only consists of energy; a object made of mass behaves just a \nlittle differently, don't you think?\n\n\nBtw the speed - matter thing also works as an explanation for time dilation \n(the faster something gets, the slower it's time works and the more you \nseem to \"push\" it in slow motion, until your push is finally frozen at \nlight speed. A photon as energy-only particle is possible, because for it \nthere is no time between its creation and impact.)  \n\nAll of this is only how i understand those laws, so if there are faults, \nthey are from my interpretation.",

Since time is relative, even \nthough everything around you may have gone back in time, you yourself \nwouldn't feel like you were going back in time. A good way to put this \nwould be if you took a watch with you while you went into a *Warp Drive*, \nthe time on the watch wouldn't go backwards, but if you had a clock back \nhome let's say, theoretically (correct me if I'm wrong) it should infact go \nbackwards.\n\nBy Warp Drive I'm referring to an idea proposed by Miguel Alcubierre (also \nknown from Science Fiction i.e. Star Trek) that would allow for effective \nfaster-than-light travel by collapsing the space in front of an object, and \nexpanding it behind that object, to propel it faster than the speed of \nlight, and thus would allow for backwards-in-time-travel, since you would \narrive at destinations technically before you left. As Slender Mane \nmentioned, this would require negative mass which would require negative \nenergy of which is extremely hard to acquire for the context of a Warp \nDrive.\n\nSources:\n\nWarp Drive: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\nHow we might be able to achieve this negative energy density I talk about: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect\n\nSome say a lot of the issues regarding a possible Warp Drive could be \ntackled by a better understanding of how General Relativity relates to \nQuantum Mechanics (Since they do not account for each other), hence Quantum \nGravity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong in the above mentioned, I'm not exactly a \nPhysicist, just a high-school nerd with a passion for Physics and too much \ntime on his hands.",

                    "text": "+Tespri\nWhether you think of it as a concept or a property of a system, time does \nexist. Since you can measure it you can't deny its existence. The atomic \nclock uses the resonance frequency of a particular atom, because the \nfrequency is known. We map that time to the time as if know. And yes, we \nuse it because it is more accurate than the cycles of our Sun or the \nfrequency of the crystals in our digital clocks. Now to your question \"How \ndoes movement of atoms = time exists?\". First of all it is not the movement \nof atoms, it is the change of state of atoms. My understanding is that the \nspeed at which the atoms travel through the fabric of space determines how \nfast or how slow they can change state. And various small factors add up \nand lead to visible effects at a high level. That's why, the airborne \natomic clocks ticks slower, it is not just the atom whose resonance \nfrequency that is used to measure time that changes state at a slower rate, \nits the whole apparatus (clock) that changes state at a slower rate and \nthus measure time at a slower rate. And it is not just the clock, its the \nairplane that carries the clock and the human beings that are in the \nairplane, all of their atoms change state at a slower rate and they in fact \ncame back younger compared to their age if they hadn't flew. And the age \ndifference would be the same as the time difference that was measured \nbetween the earth clock and the airborne clock. Man (or woman), you have to \naccept the fact that Einstein was a scientist and not a crazy person and he \nknew exactly what he was talking about when he said space and time are not \ndifferent and they need to be looked upon as a single entity, as in \nspace-time. If you still think time does not exist then all you need to do \nis read more,  see more and think more. One fine day you will get the idea.",

That is, there is nothing to destroy the system or slow \ndown the speed.\nAnother assumption should be that the system was either launched at a high \nspeed or via some mechanism acquired a high speed.\nThen life grew in that environment and was adapted to the same.\n(I am just another guy.)",
