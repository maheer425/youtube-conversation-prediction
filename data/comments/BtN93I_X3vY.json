So \nit's not just being totally ignorant of all the laws they enforce, but it's \nactually even more stupid than that, they have to lack basic reasoning \nskills let alone the ability to use Google. \n\nBasic reasoning skills is supposed to make us human.

If a drug is legal then it will be \nused on its own merits, instead of for all the wrong reasons of \n\"rebellion\", \"glorification\", \"misinformation\", etc. What do you mean \nsomething else will sell? We know what will sell, because they already sell \nanyway and prohibition does nothing to stop that. Are you trying to say \nthat if Marijuana is legal, people will suddenly want to buy and consume \nmore cocaine? Where is the link there that makes no sense? People buy weed \nbecause they want weed. They buy weed from gangs because gangs sell weed. \nIf weed is legal then all of the money people spend on weed won't go to \ngangs, it's that simple. The people who want cocaine are already buying \n(impure, far more dangerous and creates money for gangs and might ruin \ntheir life by being caught with it) cocaine.\n\n Not just that, but the entire concept of putting somebody in prison for \npossessing something just because it's a bad idea to consume what they \npossess is ridiculous, unethical and barbaric. Just confiscate the item and \ndestroy it if it's so bad. At most, criminal charges for PRODUCTION of \ndrugs could almost make sense. If these drugs were actually bad then you \nwouldn't need prison sentences to stop people using them, that would only \nwork if the prison sentences were worse than the risks of the drugs . . . \nwhich then begs the question WHY NOT JUST HAVE THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS.\n\nAlso, at the moment people assume that because MDMA and Pot are illegal and \nthey're infinitely safer than alcohol which is legal then heroin and \ncocaine are probably not as dangerous as the Government makes out also \nwhich results in much more problems and deaths. \n\nIt wouldn't bring any medical costs.
