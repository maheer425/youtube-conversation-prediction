The crushed coral forms countless \nnooks and crannies that will trap much more detritus then a \"smooth\" sand \nbed of smaller grained sand (1-2mm or less). Upon closer inspection, of \ncourse the sand bed isn't really that smooth, but the small detritus \nparticles that get trapped between the sand grains is easily taken care of \nby your CUC. The same can not be said for crushed coral since it has the \ncapacity to trap way more detritus then your CUC can handle.\n\nOf course, as stated by BulkReefSupply, if you want the least amount of \ndetritus build up then bare-bottom is really the way to go ;) ",
