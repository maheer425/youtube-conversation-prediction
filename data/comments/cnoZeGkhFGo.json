No doubt it begins with a very dark and disturbing \nChristian who would make most women run for the hills, and not because of \nthe sex, but it is a story, so she has to engage with him.  I liked that in \nthe beginning, Anna is the young, innocent, inexperienced one, and she ends \nup being the teacher in many ways. When Christian begins to doubt himself, \nand see his flaws, he decides that he wants no more part in sex the way he \nknew it, whereas Anna is hooked and teaches him that play is ok, if it is \nfor the right reasons. Toward the end I felt Anna was a very empowering \ncharacter, in the book.  In reality I caught myself saying after the first \nfew interactions, that in real life, I would probably throw something large \nand heavy at him......right between the eyes. But this is not real life, \nits fiction, and when you read the story, you are reading what the \nfictional character in the story did.

You have a point, but to be fair, it's not the only book/series \nthat incorrectly portrays bdsm (and much worse than 50SoG, because there \nare a lot of character that was 'raped').

Maybe because it's the most popular of its kind.\nAnyway, if you erased all the kinkiness of the story, it's just like fairy \ntale love story where the simple girl saves the Prince Charming (or the \nBeast) from himself.

She meets him and they instantly become infatuated with each other \nbut because of his traumatic childhood ( his mother was a crack whore with \nan abusive pimp ) he has sadistic tendencies towards women who look like \nher. It is usually with people who are  aware and are part of the lifestyle \nbut when he meets her he wants her but she is not part of this S &M world \nso he tries to introduce her into it but she leaves him when she sees any \nsort of violence which is when he realizes his need for her and the story \ngoes on from there with a pregnancy twist which causes a rift then brings \nthem back together with some other action filled incidents and then they \nlive happily ever after in which she has changed and fixed him. This story \nis actually not THAT pornographic if you want to take the standards of \ntoday and it really preys on women's love for \"fixing\" broken mysterious \nbeautiful  millionaires who just happen to fall in love with the plain \njane. When in reality they are all fat potbellied bald men with supermodel \nwives half their age. Also it used to be twilight fanfiction titled Master \nof the Universe it was also very famous then just like now it was the most \nreviewed and read fanfic on the site fanfiction.net until she moved it to a \nprivate blog then proceeded to remove it copy paste it with changed names \nand deny any link to her fanfiction fan base.",
