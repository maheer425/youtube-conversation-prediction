You are obviously talking out of \nyour fucking ass in an attempt to look smart.\n\nTLDR; You're an absolute idiot.\n\nFirst of all, developed countries DO NOT need more people. According to the \nHuman Development Index 14.6% of the worlds population live in DEVELOPED \ncountries, which still have higher relative growth and better standard of \nliving compared to developing nations. On the other hand, there's a booming \npopulation in developing countries who face uneven development, \ndeteriorating quality of life, and increased poverty. Why on Earth would we \nneed more people in developed countries when there's BILLIONS in developing \ncountries living in the poorest conditions. Why don't we focus on bringing \nthem to a developed stage?\n\nQuality of quantity? Are you fucking kidding me. First you say developing \ncountries need MORE people (quantity), now you're saying we need quality. \nHang on a second though, you're saying an older person (assuming 90years \nover, since this is based on prolonging life expectancy) has more potential \nand capabilities to offer society than a new born child. What are they \ngoing to do? When diseases such as Alzheimer's and dementia set in they'll \nbe useful as a potato. On the other hand a new born (through development) \nwill gradually learn new things and acquire a different perspective of \nsociety that and older person would not be able to achieve.   \n\nGod, and your comments continue to get worse. 'Overpopulation is not a \nproblem', well you certainly are special. Food and resources are LIMITED on \nEarth, overpopulation just means these resources will be used up faster \nuntil we're left with nothing.  Secondly, why would we focus on finding \nplanets when the real problem lies in society. Anyways, based on the \nsimilarity index, the closest planet to that of Earth (Kepler-186f) is 500 \nlight-years away, so I don't think we'll be leaving this planet any time \nsoon. \n\nThe restricting birth comment to one child per family is ridiculous, the \nonly reason China implemented it is because the country holds around 1/6th \nof the worlds population and needed to stabilise their GDP, there's no need \nto enforce it on other countries. LMFAO @ \"saying that we shouldn't do \nsomething because of overpopulation is just avoiding the problem\". How is \nit avoiding the problem when it is about solving the problem, my whole \npoint was people living longer will increase the world's population to a \ngreater extent, which is basically something that will lead to over \npopulation if it does happen. It needs to be dealt with now, not later.\n\nSorry but you are an idiot.",

I was referring more to just \ngetting so old that I forget people in a very long dementia kind of thing \nbeing the one thing I would worry about. You might forget some times you \nhave but you'll never really forget your important memories because new \nones will always remind you of the old ones as long as everything is \nworking correctly. \n\nThe 1000 winters is no big deal for me I actually use to like winter and \nI'm growing to like it again. You get over the bad memories and form good \nones with others. I've seen plenty of hatred and all the time I find \nreasons to hate people and then something turns around and I find something \nto like, because I don't stop looking. As long as you never loose site of \nwhat being alive means, you never will feel like its a curse to have a long \nlife even if you have alot of pain. Not everyone has the same kind of \nreaction, not everyone would suffer through a long life like that. I feel \nits better to just live in the moment, good or bad. I have good memories \nassociated with bad memories and that will never change. Like that I love \nwinter but my dog died in a snowstorm, or that most of the deaths have \nhappened in winter. I like the cold it helps me get to sleep at night, but \nI also love warmth, just because I got 3rd degree burns as a kid doesn't \nmake me fear fire.

                    "text": "+Justin Johnson This is all about the static brain (artificial) and the \nplastic brain (the organic brain that everyone already has) resulting in a \nsymbiotic brain. The static brain will be most likely made up of chips with \nbiofilm coatings to prevent infections once placed inside the brain...the \nlocations where the connections are made I refer to as anchor points...and \nit looks like you can't just shove pieces of hardware into living brain \ntissue so perhaps on top of the brain cortical regions (ie. the 'utah \narray' that can control devices,limbs via the motor cortex) and of course \nthese devices will get smaller and smaller and can be powered wirelessly or \neven use the body's own thermal-heat to power it (a more greener energy \nsolution). The hardest obstacle to overcome is not the memory because for \ninstance all it would be needed to save a person is to preserve their past \n24h existence/experiences and would not even have to include \"highlights\" \nof their lives...they would simply continue on making new memories as if \nnothing would of happened...albeit it would feel kinda strange...perhaps \nsome sort of experiment needs to be done here in order to determine how \nmuch memory loss it would take for an average individual to loose \ntheir...what can be described as their core self and identity. The hardest \nbrain regions to make the connection to the 'static' brain will be the \nthinking/future planning portions because these are connected with all \nother regions of the brain such as planning areas with memory areas. In \nfact the entire brain let's say from the frontal regions 'talks' seamlessly \nto the back regions and vice- versa but they do this...I suspect via a \nchemical wave...some sort of resonance(?) The reason why neuron to neuron \ncommunications are extremely fast is because I think that the brain is a \nchemical computer using a bunch of ions to change it's own shape \n(topology). So a memory is nothing more then an intricate composition of \nhills,valleys,boulders,rocks,meandering streams etc As long as the general \ntapestry is still there (ie it's recognizable) the memory can be retrieved \n(more or less albeit not perfectly) or degraded and lost forever if it is \nbeyond recognition. However what has to be kept in mind that memories could \nin fact be distributed all over the place..however it is generally accepted \nthat they are localized in specific regions.So, chips in the brain, have to \nstart somewhere. And then of course there are people who are trying to \ninvent the elixir of life (chemical potions) to try to extend life. That \nwould be great however if we are talking about a frail plus 5-10 \nyears...where you are still reliant on other people or machines to keep you \nalive...for the sake of being alive then I think it would not be worth it. \nTinkering with cells,genes can get you only so far...and by all \nmeans..tinker away and I myself will probably benefit from such endeavors. \nHowever to get serious about the immortality then the brain is the only \ngame in town.",

One \nof the ways this could work is a symbiosis of neuronal tissue and \nartificial neuronal tissue. Parts of the brain that are responsible for \nsimple well understood operations such as circadian rhythm, vision, \nbreathing, smelling, hearing,the long axonal tracts and such can be safely \nreplaced. The trick of course would be to tell all the surrounding \nsupporting structures that it's sill one of \"them\" with the hosts' dna.\" If \nnot then the body will obviously reject it. The more difficult part will be \nthe grey/gray matter regions of the brain. And again if you opt to simply \ncopy the structure (ie the positions of neurons etc) then you will only \nhave a copy but NOT the potential mechanical (chemical) functions thereof. \nIf the brain/synthetic tissue/mass can be grown into each other then that \nmeans you will start to have the ability to offload some fragments of \nexperiences/memories into it. Problem here is that the thinking part is \nstill done with the bio-neurons (3d spacial topological format) and that \nwill essentially end up as some sort of extra static memory space...not \nvery useful or beneficial. The higher mental function such as \nthinking,future planning in the brain is done chemically and it seems to be \na very complicated process. This is where the 'magical' nano-tech bots come \ninto play swarms of them copying/mimicking and replacing/enhancing the \nbrain and of course the entire body. Just throwing some ideas out there.\n\nIn the near term you have the stem cell therapies,the healthy living styles \netc in order to wait for the: Cyborg Tech or A.I. Savior inventions to take \nhold. For elderly and such their only option will be the body/brain \ncryogenics (and or similar alternatives) and hope to get revived some day \ninto the future.

We have two \nmajor types of memory fluid memory, which is temporary and used short term, \nand crystallized memory, which is permanent. These memories are actually \nthe same brain stuff so as we form more crystallized memory we lose fluid \nmemory; this could be part of the reason why we're so good at learning at \nyoung ages but get worse as we age. This means that the older we are the \nmore crystallized memories we have and the less fluid memory; we rely more \non our past experiences rather than what we learn in the short term. This \nbasically puts a limit on how much we can learn in our lives so if we \nextend our life to such that we learn more than that?\nOne interersting way to get around that could be to dump memories to \nexternal storage through BCI (brain computer interface) or brain scan or \nsomething and somehow convert previously crystallized memory back to fluid \nmemory. We would also have to find someway of accessing those memories \nthrough BCI without them re-creating crystallized memory; but the brain \nmight not do that anyway from having constant access to the information.\ufeff",

Now 40 \nis still pretty young and you will probably have another 40 years ahead of \nyou.  Think for a second that if people were living to be 200, being 100 \nwould be the new 40.  I could put off buying a Corvette until I'm 100. \n\nWe should probably already have more strict population controls in place.  \nThere are already too many people.  Having increased lifespans would just \nhelp everyone realize the problem we already have. \n\nIt would also create a possibility for a new social norm of a second \ncareer.  Maybe when people reach what is currently the retirement age of 65 \nthey decide to go back to college and create a new life with a different \ncareer.  It would be a little weird to be in college with your kids \nthough.  Then you work until you're 130.  Then during your 70 years of \nretirement, another scientist creates a way to fully reset all of your \ncells to when you were 20 years old.  Rinse and repeat. \n\nI will have to admit that I don't fully understand the issue presented in \nthe video.  She was down to two variants of blood cells.  However, other \nscientists have successfully created stem cells from other cells.  Couldn't \nthey recreate her original cells also, to give a new supply of white blood \ncells? \ufeff",

Also, if over population is already getting to be such \na bad problem (like in India and China where waste and trash is \naccumulating way too much and causing health issues), we should NOT try to \ngive people longer lives.
