That will help your cat navigate, say, a desktop without walking \non your keyboard, or a shelf without knocking things off.)\n\nWhen you start to open the door, the cat will charge towards the widening \ngap.  You open the door wide enough for her to see out, but not get out. \nYou put your hand (or foot) in front of her face and tell her no. The \nmoment she stops trying to get past, give praise! It's a good sign if the \ncat looks at you to try to understand what you're thinking. It means she's \nlearning and listening. Always acknowledge her when she looks at you, when \nyou are teaching her things, by nodding and blinking. She is saying, \"I am \nlistening to you.\" and you are saying back, \"You are a good listener!\"\n\nSomething to keep in mind is a narrow opening is more tempting to a cat \nthan a wide open door. When you swing the door wide, the cat should keep a \nrespectful distance, only looking curiously outside.",

I \nthink he should, if he hasn't yet, but it may not be his style.\n\nFor a cat harness, use a figure eight style. (Do an image search on Google \nto see what it looks like.) You can make one easily with a soft strap or \nstring, or yarn if the kitten is small enough not to break it. Make a loop \nthat goes from around the neck, across the shoulders, under the belly, and \nback to the shoulders.

I can open my door wide, and the cats will not dash out. \nThis training does not stick permanently, and you have to refresh them from \ntime to time, but it's workable.\n\nSo, train them on door manners as well as leash manners, and your life will \nbe easier.
