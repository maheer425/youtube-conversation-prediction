I've read all these comments and you've repeatedly \nchanged your arguments focal point just to wind up back where you started \nwith nothing to say. The fact of the matter is, you cannot build and base \nan argument around something you have no knowledge of. If you have never \nread any of the blogs these example quotes are taken from. Then you have no \nground to stand on. You cannot say it's \"quote mining\" when you yourself \ntake a quote and put your own words around it. That is what is called \nhypocrisy. You can't quote mine quotes to try and prove that quotes have \nbeen mined. I do agree you shouldn't take the stand point of someone just \nbecause they put it in a video and put their own thoughts on it. That's \ncalled being a sheep. However, again. To do an action to prove an action \nwrong is just asking to paint yourself a self portrait of a hypocrite on \nshaky ground.    ",

But i don't care what their reasons were.  The point was that they \nwere giving preferential treatment to one race over another.  That is \nracism, no matter what the intentions were.  \nAnd why should a company be FORCED to higher any one race over another? \n Why can't just the best person for the job be hired for the job, \nregardless of race?  \n\nHow do you not understand that passing laws, and regulating anything based \non race, is only serving to keep racism alive?\n\nI called treyvon a hoodlum because he was a hoodlum.  He was caught several \ntimes with drugs.  He was caught writing on school lockers with a permanent \nmarker.  When the polie searched his backpack the next day, they found a \nbunch of womens jewelry, along with a screwdriver.  His own mother kicked \nhim out of the house before he was even an adult due to his bad behavior. \n He was a bully at school, getting in several fist fights to \"get even\" and \neven attempted to buy a gun along with a friend.  \n\nZimmerman did not \"stalk\" treyvon.  He followed him so that police would \nknow where to find him.  Should he have done that? no.  But that did NOT \ngive trayvon a reason to attack zimmerman, which he did.  Zimmerman begged \ntreyvon to stop hitting him but treyvon just kept attacking until he \nknocked zimmerman to the ground and began to beat his head against the \nconcrete repeatedly.  Zimmerman didn't do anything worth being attacked \nlike that.  He only shot treyvon to save his own life.  He didn't even draw \nthe gun until Treyvon was already beating his head against the ground. \n These are the FACTS.  If you believe any different it is because you were \nlied to by the media, or by whatever friend you heard it from.  Zimmerman \ndidn't kill a black kid for no reason. He shot a black man that was trying \nto kill him for no reason.\n\nOnly Fox news ever called treyvon a thug.  And that is good.  Treyvon was a \nthug.  Does that mean i trust Fox news? no.  I prefer to find information \nmyself and make my own decisions.  \n\nI never once said that i hate black people.  You are stereotyping me as a \nracist because i am saying things you can't wrap your naive little head \naround.  I do not hate black people.  I am not racist.  I am all for \nequality.  All i am doing is pointing out that not every damn thing is \nracist, like you seem to think it is.  \n\nThe fact that you keep putting words in my mouth and trying to stereotype \nme as a racist white guy just goes to show what i am talking about.  I \nhaven't said a racist thing in this entire comment thread, but that hasn't \nstopped you from assuming i am racist.  And you are too dumb to even see \nthe racism in that.",

You just said that you were \ndenied a scholarship and that \"blacks don't have to have such a high GPA\".\nWhile there USED to be a bit of that before, it wasn't because people were \nracist against whites. It was because the U.S was trying to REMOVE racism \nagainst blacks, stating that most work places must reflect the local \npopulation of minorities, meaning that some blacks were accepted into \nworkplaces without having amazing history.\n\nCalling Trayvon a Hoodlum just solidifies my point of you being racist. \nFurthermore, you have no proof of Trayvon attacking Zimmerman. Zimmerman \nstalked Trayvon and started the fight. Also, Zimmerman was recently \narrested AGAIN in Florida. This guy definitely seems innocent. Zimmerman is \nnot technically entirely Caucasian, but it leans more towards the point of \nblacks being treated unfairly in America. White privilege still exists, \nsuch as whites not being called \"thugs\" or \"hoodlums\" for daring to wear a \nhoodie and walk around in their own neighbourhood. Zimmerman might not have \nkilled Trayvon BECAUSE he was black, but the fact is that a guy killed a \nblack kid for no reason and got off scott free for it.\n\nI am re-iterating the point that fact-based, unbiased news outlets express. \nMost \"news\" shows (like FOX, for example) were talking about how Trayvon \nwas a \"thug\" and how he deserved it, blah blah blah. I'm not whining about \nhow much I hate blacks because somewhere down the line a black guy got some \nopportunities that I didn't, or that other races are now being treated \nbetter than complete garbage in the U.S. Wake up and grow up.",

Just because you don't \nlike it does not mean they don't exist.  I don't want to be a victim, nor \nam i claiming to be.  All i am doing here is pointing out the hypocrisy of \npeople running around claiming that every damn thing is racist, and blaming \nwhite men for all of their problems.  \n\nsecond, the trayvon martin case is a classic example that proves the point \ni was making.  \n1. Every news media outlet used the picture of trayvon that was 3 years old \nto make him look like an innocent little kid, rather than the over 6 foot \ntall, 17 year old hoodlum that he was.  \n2. The NBC doctored 911 call.  NBC got a copy of zimmermans 911 phone call \non the night of the shooting, and edited it to make zimmerman sound racist. \nThen other news media outlets sampled that auido and used it themselves to \nfurther the agenda. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72zJvVQWutA\n3. Trayvon martin attacked zimmerman first and was beating zimmermans head \nagainst the ground several times before zimmerman shot him.  this is backed \nup by eye witnesses and a lot of evidence.  Zimmerman shot treyvon in self \ndefense. \n4. Zimmerman was not even white.  He is hispanic.  Yet the media made him \nout to be white and racist, in order to discredit him.\n5.  The judgment in the trayvon case against zimmerman was a justified \nruling.  Zimmerman wasn't out to kill a black kid for being black.  The \nevidence in the trial proves that.  \n\nThe fact that you think race had anything to do with that incident is just \nproof that you are regurgitating whatever the media tells you, or whatever \nyou want to believe, in spite of all the evidence that points to the truth.",

The videos you see are just short clips that are the result of \nthings that happened before hand that is almost never talked about or \nshown.  Police have procedures that they follow to protect not only \nthemselves, but the people they interact with.  I see it all the time, i \nwork with police.  And not one of them has ever just harassed anybody for \nno reason.  It is very difficult to determine when to use force.  Without \nthe proper training, the average person may not understand why a cop might \nhave shot a person.  So people rail against the police and accuse them of \nbeing racially motivated, when race had nothing to do with it. \n\nThis is a video from my area.  The activist is Rev. Jarod Mopett.  A very \nwell known black activist.  He thought the cops were racist and was \ndemanding the badges of a few cops who had to shoot a black man in the line \nof duty.  Once he was shown just how things can turn ugly, he changed his \nmind.  I recommend you watch this video.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g\n\nThe fact is that the Young Turks, and most media outlets are biased.  They \nare ignorant of how the real world works in many respects, including police \nprocedure, and use that ignorance to entice people into believing the same \nthings they believe.  That is the true cause of any racial divide in this \ncountry.  Not any actual racism.  \n\nAs far as my challenge, you will never find a law in the US that gives any \nprivilege to white people.  But there are plenty that give privilege to \nother races.  Such as diversity laws that force employers to hire so many \nmembers of minority races, even if that means turning away qualified white \npeople.

You are getting far too tied up on the political argument, which \nleads me to believe you don't do research, you just listen to the views of \nthe majority of the political party you subscribe to. You don't know my \npolitical views, so let's talk science.\n\n Lets go point by point here.\n\nWarming since 1996: Yes, yes there has been. Cherry picked data would have \nyou believe there has not been, or that the amount is so minuscule it \ndoesn't count. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/ How about we \nlook at some data there. The global temperatures since 1996 went from \napproximately 0.45 to 0.55 degrees Celsius, and that's using the average \nafter all the variations year to year. Here is a study that was done, and \nobservations made to form data showing the trend in global temperatures \nwhen you remove known natural changes (such as el ninos and el ninas, sun \ncycles etc.)\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/foster-and-rahmstorf-measure-global-warming-signal.html\n\n\nBut how about we quit cherry picking the last 17 years. Where you were \nalready wrong about, and lets move on to the last 130 years. The data we \nhave shows a significant increase in global temperatures in the last 130 \nyears, with 38 consecutive years of temperatures over the 100 year average, \nno natural cycle lasts that long, so we are getting pretty far out of your \ncherry picking range here. With a majority of the heating taking place \naround 1970-1980, after that point the global land-ocean temperatures have \ngone from an average of 0.01 Celsius, to between .55 and .6  Celsius on \naverage. If you want to look back 100 years, since between 1910 and 1920 \nglobal temperatures were approximately -0.15 degrees Celsius.\n\nYou are simply following along with rhetoric that takes small periods of \ntime, and says \"BUT LOOK NOTHING HAPPENED HERE IN THIS ANOMALOUS SEGMENT!\" \nwhile ignoring the bigger picture and seeing that even if there was no real \nsubstantial change in that small point, compared to the total view, the \nissue remains.\n\nAs for whether or not green house gasses exponentially compound, that's \nsimple common sense, I mean, if you have something that is already put into \na system. At a fairly balanced rate, and then recycled and turned into \nsomething else. Then you take more of that same first substance (in this \ncase CO2 and other greenhouse gasses) and keep throwing it in, and then \ncontinue to take out the other part that converts it (plant life) and \ncontinue to throw more in at an increased exponential rate. It's going to \nbuild up. All the deforestation, and other environmental destruction that \nis done only helps compound on the problem. \n\nAs for your point about being hypocritical, sure I enjoy the comforts of \nliving in the first world. But we all do. There are pushes to look for more \nrenewable and cleaner methods of energy that are blocked constantly by the \nlarge oil companies and their crony friends in government positions. In all \nparties. Until then it's just a matter of living in this world how it is, \nand trying to help improve it. \n\n\nsome more links for you my friend. \n\nhttp://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/#gtemp\nhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut3/diagnostics/global/nh%2Bsh/index.html\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/big-picture-global-warming.html",

Think about that.\"\n\nI'd love to, but it was gibberish. How is \"black face\" a time in history? \nIt's still a thing that is done today, hence this conversation. How does a \ntime in history not get hired? I have absolutely no clue what the hell \nyou're talking about.\n\nI'll assume you meant to say that racial slavery is a shameful time in \nhistory. And yes it was, I quite agree. But we got past that by *destroying* \nnegative stereotypes. Now you're here telling me that seeing a black face \nmust cause offence. Is that the attitude of a society that has taken away \npreconceptions about race?\n\n\n \"People would write with black characters as maids and housekeepers or \nchauffeurs knowing that a white actor would be playing the role. Why not \nhave a white maid? Because that would have been unacceptable by the \nstandards of the times.\"\n\nYep. They had a different paradigm at the time. In contemporary terms, it \nwouldn't have made sense to write a white person into those roles. Now, \nthankfully, we know better. How, exactly, is this connected to what we're \ntalking about? Just because the actors would wear makeup?\n\nIt isn't the makeup that made it offensive, you dolt, it was the FACT that \nthey insist a black person must be that character. Ever watch Fawlty \nTowers? With Manuel the Spanish stereotype who couldn't understand English? \nWas that racism? Ever watch Taxi? That had a guy in makeup to imitate being \nforeign. Andy Kaufman, one of the world's most interesting comedians.\n\nHe also employed blackface in his standup, as well as a Jewish character, \nhis foreign man character from Taxi, and an American stereotype character. \nHe was a master of using makeup and prosthetics to emulate multiple \ndifferent characters for the purpose of parody and self-aware fun-poking.\n\nHis character on Taxi was part of a made-up culture, the joke wasn't \"I'm \nso visibly different\" it was \"I'm so exotic I don't understand your ways\", \nthe makeup was just to make it realistic. Same with his actual blackface \nand oither characters. Something isn't racist JUST because it involves a \nface that isn't white. Thinking that way is insulting on all kinds of \nlevels.\n\nI would point out that if YOU believe that everything that happens to \ninvolve racism that has ever happened throughout history MUST somehow be \nlinked to what we're discussing here, simply because a black face is \ninvolved, then you are not battling racism - you're *contributing* to it.\n\nDon't tell me that everything involving blackness must be linked to racism. \nThat is NOT an enlightened attitude. Your first thought when you see a \nblack person should NOT be \"race\".\n\n\n \"So, by today's standards when we look back and we KNOW how racist it was, \nwhy would you condone the use of it as \"not that bad\" \"\n\nThe use of WHAT? The only examples you gave are people writing black people \ninto the roles of maids and chauffeurs in fiction. What in the sam hell \ndoes that have to do what painting your face for a Halloween party??\n\n\n\"unless you still don't see a problem with it in which case you're probably \na bit racist.\ufeff\n\nSee a problem with WHAT? Would I be racist if I thought a black person must \nbe a maid? Yeah, probably. Would I be racist if I thought a black person \nmust OFFEND me just because they're black (whether artificially or \nnaturally)? NO. Because being black is NOT inherently offensive.\n\nWe are a species of multiple colours and types and shapes, and that is \nGOOD. Sometimes we celebrate each other's cultures and types. Times like \nHalloween where we dress up as Native Americans or Geisha or Swedish bar \nwenches. It's just a novelty. Men dressing as women, kids dressing as \nadults, whites dressing as blacks. It's only OFFENSIVE if you think the \nmere image of any of these things must offend.\n\nSo tell me what it is about all of those examples that upsets you so much. \nOr is it only the race example?

No one's doing it for racist reasons anymore. It's just \"Hey look at \nme, I'm a black person, isn't it novel?\". Not the brightest choice of \nHalloween costume, certainly, but it's only OFFENSIVE if you honestly \nbelieve the mere image of a black person is something you should \nautomatically be offended by.\n\nAnd hell will freeze over before I'll entertain that sort of notion. How \nabout you?",

I have read entire books on a train or an airplane. \n Or do they have you loading coal to power the train?   \n\nYou poor thing.  You take food to work?  THE HORROR!!!  You shop at \nWalMart? You may as well be in a 3rd World Country!!!!  Wait a minute, do \nyou put your shoes on one at a time? I am not Obama.  I am not playing golf \nin Palm Springs.  ",

Please \ntell me that you do understand that.   \n\nAnd no, I do not like handouts to anyone.  Sorry to disappoint you.  That \nis why I prefer something like the fair tax, something that takes away all \nthe tax loopholes.  Apparently you like the current tax system, that is why \nwe have such nonsense.  Our government gives out WAY too much money to WAY \ntoo many people.  \n\nCompanies put money into overseas accounts because they do not get taxed as \nmuch.  We lower the tax rate on EVERYONE, they might bring their money back \nto the US.  That would be good for EVERYONE in the US. Make it advantageous \nfor them to bring their money back.\n\nI am all for you or anyone else helping whatever poor family you want to \nhelp.  I do not think the government is the best vehicle for that help. \n There is too much waste and abuse.  If we lower taxes, you can take your \nmoney and do whatever you want with it - you can probably help three times \nas many poor families as the government can if you oversee it yourself. \n Not to mention you know better than the government if your neighbor needs \nand deserves help.  \n\nI love and help people who work for a living.  I actually just happen to \nhave WAY to much knowledge about how people game the system. If you \nactually have a job and actually pay taxes, you too would be a bit pissed \nat what I see daily.

You literally defend \na system that encourages people to gather as much wealth as humanly \npossible and then dump it in offshore bank accounts where it's permanently \nremoved from the US economy, which in turn freezes job growth and all but \ndestroys small businesses which are essential for a thriving middle class.\n\nDo you realize how fucking stupid you make yourself appear when you rattle \noff a bunch of talking points you picked up from a.m. radio, even though \nyou don't have a clue what you're actually talking about? I hate to break \nit you buddy, but there has never been a communist nation in the world, and \nthere never will be. See... In communism there are no 'leaders' no \n'government' and most importantly there's not even 'currency'. Aside from \ntotal anarchy, true communism is the least intrusive, and smallest form of \ngovernance ever devised by man. \n\nJust because a country assigns themselves a label like democracy, \ncommunism, fascism, socialism, imperialism, etc.... It doesn't mean that's \nwhat they actually are. North Korea calls itself a republic, but nobody in \ntheir right mind is going to stand up and claim that's what it actually is. \nJust like we claim to be a democracy.... when anyone who's ever studied \ncivics, knows that's a fucking joke.\n\nThe point is.... Only narrow minded ignorant fools blame a political \nphilosophy for their problems and the problems of the world as a whole. In \ntheory true communism is one of the most noble ideologies of governance \never put forward, but it's nothing more than a fantasy, because it goes \nagainst the very nature of our species. Whether it's used in a way that \nappeals to people, or used to instill fear and hatred.... It's just a word \nrich people throw around to control large masses of simple minded fools, \nand unsurprisingly you take the bait every single time.\n\nYou and people like you are the ultimate hypocrites. You expect and demand \nmultiple elements within our society which cannot possibly coexist. On one \nhand you hate socialism, yet you expect good paying jobs that protect \nworkers rights... Whereas at the exact same time, you love free market \ncapitalism with minimal regulation, but you don't wish to see jobs and \nmoney pouring out of the country at an alarming rate. Well you can't have \nit both ways, you have to pick one and accept the consequences it carries, \nboth good and bad, while striving to make improvements along the way.\n\nDo you have any clue where all those good paying jobs that we're currently \nlosing, originated from? Or how the United States spent four decades having \nthe strongest middle class in human history? Those things didn't spring up \nout of thin air... They came from 12 years with Franklin Roosevelt in the \nwhite house. FDR for all intents and purposes, was a socialist when it came \nto domestic issues. He spent a fortune on such things as jobs programs, \npublic works, education reform, workers rights, and he even bailed out the \nentire ag industry when it collapsed from the dust bowl. Most importantly, \nhe told big corporate interests to go fuck themselves and he did what was \nin the best interest of the American people. And it has to be done all over \nagain if we're ever going to see our country return to that level of \nprosperity, but that's never going to happen as long as idiots are running \naround being terrified of words they can't even define!",

In regards \nto vaccinations etc yes, those are certainly ignorant and unscientific \nviews.\n\n \"Left's obsession with everything organic and natural drives them to \nreject GMO science\"\n\nHasty generalization fallacy. Unlike you, I actually studied formal logic. \nHad you done the same, you wouldn't be a right winger.\n\n\"Same with vaccines, which you conveniently ignored\"\n\nI ignored no such thing. I actually admitted that the left had its own \nanti-science element, and I thought maybe you would be smart enough to pick \nup on that.\n\n\"A large portion of the left also protests animal testing, which is \nfundamental to science\"\n\nDefine \"large portion\", quantify it. And many people all over the political \nspectrum have a problem with experimentation done on *certain* animals; do \nyou think we should be experimenting on humans, who are also animals? what \nabout cats, dogs, chimpanzees? notice how isn't as cut and dry as you \nthink? I realize that right wingers like you tend to lack the intellectual \nrigor to grasp nuance, but seriously.\n\n\"Nuclear isn't a cut and dry issue, it is a scientific issue\"\n\nLOL this demonstrates to me how insufferably simplistic you are. No, it \nisn't cut and dry. Look at Fukushima. People have a good reason to be \nconcerned about nuclear energy. Also there is the issue of economics and \nspecial interests involved which muddy the waters of the debate regarding \nthe safety and security of nuclear energy. Here are some pro's and cons of \nnuclear energy, proving that it isn't \"cut and dry\" as you so flippantly \nclaim.  http://www.triplepundit.com/2009/02/nuclear-energy-pros-and-cons/\n\nCould the same  be said about biological evolution? or AGW? no. Hence it's \nan equivocation fallacy. \n\n\"What do you have? Evolution and global warming? That's it?\"\n\nDo you have \"the left\" attempting to push anti-nuclear, anti-vaccine and \nanti-animal testing propaganda in school? no. Do you have a concerted \neffort of people trying to push creationism in schools and using industry \nand government to block efforts at addressing AGW? YES.\n\n\"Retarded straw-man as usual. There isn't anything \"magical\" about supply \nand demand and price-mechanism allocating resources\"\n\nOf course nobody is talking about just \"SD\" or allocation of sources, and \nto claim that this is the definition of  the \"free market\" I was referring \nto is in itself a strawman. And it was an honest question, since most on \nthe right believe in the capitalist \"Free market\" and this is the root of \ntheir denial of AGW.\n\n\"Matter of fact it is exactly analogous to scientific illiterate fundies \nwho don't understand evolution and claim animals cannot \"magically\" evolve \nand there needs to be a central planning govt God to arrange everything\"\n\nThere you go with your equivocation. How can you compare something not \nscientific, such as economic models, to something wholly scientific like \nbiological evolution?",
