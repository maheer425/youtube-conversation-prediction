They will eventually stop using the box because the smell is so \nputrid. \nA normal, large litter box should be fine for your cat, +crazycatlady39 but \nif you are worried about something getting on walls/carpet then I would \nsuggest that you make a corner waterproof. Using something like a floor \nprotector for a desk chair would be ideal for under the box. If you use \ntarp or something loud or strange feeling to the cat, he won't like it and \nwill not use the box. A tarp/rubber sheet hung on the walls surrounding the \nbox will prevent anything from going on the walls. It's important that \nyou're also reinforcing his good behaviour (using the litter boxes) by \nsmall treats, petting etc and deterring him from bad behaviour like yelling \n\"no\", spraying him with water (nothing else). When you do see him not using \nthe litter box, pick him up (ew I know) and place him in the box. When he \ntries to leave without using it, keep him there until he does. ",

Your cat is not going to \nlike it and she will resort to not using it eventually because she too, \nwill be bothered by the smell. If she has an issue with squatting like pain \nthen you need to put the litterboxes in a place that is waterproof, like \nsomewhere with tiles. No hoods.  \nTake her to the vet immediately.\nGet TWO uncovered litterboxes - if needed, place them in a waterproof area.\nMake sure that her \"smell\" is around the rest of the house - rub blankets \nshe sleeps on etc on the walls of the house. Make sure she has at least two \nscratching posts placed around the house. If this is a territorial issue \nthen this will help.",

                    "text": "I think that the key is understanding the principle behind JG's guidance. \n Each cat and household is different. I see 2 main principles here to make \nthings work for kitty and human:  LOCATION & LITTER TYPE.     LOCATION:  I \ndon't think the box has to be the focal point of the living room.  I only \nhave 1 cat and she is my first so my experience may be limited compared to \nothers.  We only have 1 litter box.  Previously, she had the guest bedroom \n(no, not enclosed -- she had the run of the apt) and her litter box was in \nthe en-suite shower stall.  It was a glassed stall with an open glass door, \nso she would't have felt closed in.  When we were moving, I stayed with my \nsister and her litter box was next to my bed.  Now we are in a tiny apt and \nher litter box is in the bathroom, next to my own \"litter box\", so to \nspeak. When we move back to our permanent townhouse home, there will be 3 \nfloors.  I don't plan to put a box in the living or dining room, but I do \nplan to have more than one box -likely one on the entry level and one on \nthe 3rd, bedroom floor, avoiding the living/dining/kitchen floor all \ntogether.  The main thing is for my kitty 1) not to have to go TOO far to \nget where she needs to go.  ie/ not have to climb or go down 2 floors;  and \n2) not to be in some scary, dark or dirty place like next to the furnace or \nin a cobwebbed, damp corner of a basement.  If she would start to have \nmobility problems so that doing stairs is always difficult or painful, I \nwould, for sure, put a 3rd box on the 2nd living/dining floor, likely in \nthe kitchen.  LITTER:  it is worthwhile spending more on a quality litter. \n I had to use a scented clay litter when we first arrived in this tiny apt. \n The dust would eventually waft into the living/kitchen area, which I \nhated.  The scented litter was evident when passing the bathroom door.   I \nwas later able to get my corn-husk-based litter.  what a relief!  Almost no \ndust and I chose the unscented kind.  I clean the box morning, after work \nand before bed.  I use a small plastic pail like a diaper pail and the used \nlitter goes in a plastic bag, twisted closed and into the pail until i'm \nready to make the trek to the outside garbage.  There is no smell at all, \nno dust invading my living space.  This experience between the 2 types of \nlitter makes me feel that the extra I spent on the better litter (World's \nBest) was very well spent.  I must admit that there is one more aspect to \nmy litter-box satisfaction - I note that there are all kinds of litter \nscoops out there.  I have more than one type.  However, the best, I find, \nis an old spoon.  Instead of breaking up the clumps by pushing through with \na litter scoop, I locate them, \"excavate\" a little and can pick up the \nwhole clump with very little breaking -- super easy with World's Best. \n With very little soiled litter left behind, the litter is clean for weeks \nand doesn't smell.\n\nCONCLUSION:  just like we wouldn't go to the bathroom in our living or \ndining rooms, I don't think kitty has to either (unless you are trying to \ncorrect a territory- or confidence-related behaviour problem -- you might \nhave to do this at first). However, just like us, she doesn't want to have \nto make a long trek when Nature calls and she doesn't want to do it in some \nenclosed, dark or dirty corner.  A good quality litter and regular cleaning \nregime can improve the quality of life you and your kitty share.  I think, \ntherefore, that there are lots of options for litter box location in a \nhome.  It's good, like someone else said, to think about the changes \nnecessary before sharing one's life with a cat(s).  However, I think Yapple \nDapple has options and may be ok with a cat after all -- or maybe not, \nafter all. A cat is a live creature with emotions and physical and \npsychological needs and cannot be contained like a plant so,yes, do think \nabout it.  But a plant isn't nearly as much fun or as fulfilling!  With \neducation, thought, research and experimentation, it can/can work.",

It didn't.  \n\nI chose the hooded litter box that was a pearl white color so light can get \nthrough it in case she did not want to go in a dark place. (It's like the \nbig round one in the video with a little stairway that does not have its \nhood.)  I doubt if the color really matters, but it was just my gut \nfeeling.  It's big enough for her to poop on one side and pee on the other. \n \n\nMaybe if there were a problem with her going outside of the litter box, I \nwould consider getting another.

Cats are not as easy to train as dogs.  Dogs are much more \ndependent on their humans than cats are.  Cats seem to want to make sure we \nknow that too with some of their attitudes. ;-)  \n\nI love animals, but I think cats are best for me. In particular one cat at \na time, because I am the only human living in a small apartment.  Cats are \nso territorial and usually gravitate to one human when there is more than \none in their living quarters.  Mostly all we need to do is give them what \nthey naturally need when they are house cats.  \n\nI think this guy is just doing his best to educate people that there is a \nbig responsibility to properly have cats living with you.  \n\nMine is jealous of my laptop.  She is usually in my lap when I'm using my \nlaptop, which sits on the arm of my recliner.  She will gnaw a little on \nits corner or place her paw on a couple keys when she wants petted.  She \nalways manages to hit the caps lock key and I ask her if she wants to \n\"yell\" at someone - haha!  My little kitty is for sure a companion in my \nlife for whom I am thankful everyday.

                    "text": "+creativeplanetjanet Hi! nice to get your email this Thanksgiving Day! Yes, \nI see what you mean, the more litter boxes you have the more litter boxes \nyou have to scoop! As far as him \"letter the cats rule the house,\" I think \nthere is a subtle difference between \"cats ruling the house\" and \"going out \nof your way to make the cat happy and secure.\" I'll give two examples to \ndemonstrate. 1. Letting cats rule the house (and you) is doing whatever \nthey indicate that they want you to do for them every single time they \n\"ask\" for it. Claire Bressant (The Cat Whisperer) gives examples of older \ncats who become insecure in the night and howl. (it seems that in England, \nthey generally shut their cats outside their bedrooms.) So the older cat \nhowls and howls and the owner gets up EVERY TIME it feels lonely in the \nnight. That is an example of letting the cat rule you. Or feeding the cat \nevery time it asks for food. One of my daughters did that and she always \nwould up with very fat cats. So, doing what the cat fancies every time it \ndemands it is often not even GOOD for the cat.  As you say WE are their \nmasters and WE know best (when we do!!)  2/ Going out of your way to \nprovide conditions that make the cat happy and secure. Here's an example of \nthat. A cat owner complains that their cat scratches up the furniture and \nthe rug every day. No matter how many times they punish the cat, it keeps \ndoing it.  Plus it is peeing on the rug beside your favorite chair, which \nis shredded by now. YOU probably already know the solution to this!  The \ncat has genetic NEEDS, that it evolved in the wild, and one of them is to \ndo this scratching thing. It allows the husks of the old claw to fall off, \nand it exercises many of the muscles in the back and legs, releases energy, \nthus relaxing the cat, and provides pleasure for it, just like exercising \ndoes for humans.  So the solution comes from CATegory number 2, providing a \nlittle extra for the cat. The result is good for the cat AND good for us!! \nThe owner provides some scratching posts, depending on the size of the \nhouse, (with retraining, you might need more than usual) and the cat soon \nis using the scratching posts and not the furniture and the rug. The owner \nis happy, the cat is happy and more healthy. And the relationship between \nthe cat and the owner is improved!!  So, are we letting the cat rule us by \nbuying scratching posts for it?   I think the issue boils down to whether \nthe CAT is ruling us or whether the cat's NEEDS are guiding our behavior.  \nBecause if we don't satisfy the cat's needs, we are going to pay for that \nby having to put up with the cat's bad behavior. Examples of cat's bad \nbehavior resulting from needs not being met can be seen on \"My Cat From \nHell.\"  Not that anyone is to BLAME. We are just ignorant of what the cat's \nneeds ARE. And that is what Jackson is trying to teach everyone.  Examples \nof cats needs: \"Property\" of its \"own.\" \"Vertical Space.\" (cat trees) Space \njust for cats that runs around the upper part of the room (\"cat \nsuper-highways,\" cat shelves placed so the cat can jump from one to \nanother, no cat flaps to the outside, b/c the cat knows its rivals can come \nin that door, enclosed places for it to sleep, for security and warmth, \n(small circular beds with sides) Cat toys to play with, on his own, and \ncontrolled by you, like a toy bird on a string, or \"fishing rod\" type set \nup, and play with the cat vigorously frequently, times for cuddling in your \nlap, if the cat likes it, and stroking, and cat signals, like the slow \nblink to show your love, and communication, and do not shut the cat away \nfrom you much, and when you go on a trip, leave fabric with your scent on \nit, to help them be secure. Do not clearly favor another cat. And if you \nWANT, you can double the amount of cat furniture, toys etc. And of course, \nproper food and proper litter boxes. See, the cat DOES NOT KNOW that you \nare going out of your way to provide these\u2014what you might think\u2014are extra \nthings. Therefore it's not the CAT that is ruling us.  It's the cat's \nneeds.  When we don't take care of the cats' needs, they become anxious and \ninsecure, and they act out their anxiety by doing things that it knows are \noutside its routine.  THAT I'd like to learn more about.  And back to \nnumber 1, the CAT ruling us\u2014that is just all those demands the cat makes on \nus that it really doesn't need, it just would like to have. I just \nremembered the old saying, \"A door is something that a cat wants to be on \nthe other side of!\" There is cat behavior in which the cat is ruling the \nhuman!  I would say allowing a cat to scratch you in play is one of those \ncat-rulling-you behaviors. Feeding it every time it asks, also, and letting \nit lie down on your computer keys, so that you stop working every time it \ndemands that you do is another. Cats will not BE better off if you allow it \nto rule you. Hey, I wonder if it's like children. They NEED to know their \nboundaries!!  Well, as usual, I've had to write three times as much as \neveryone else to explain my points!!  What do you think? Is it worth it? or \ndoes it get boring?\nAND THEN of course, there is the matter of\u2014if you get an animal, are you \ngoing to provide what it needs so that it will live comfortable with you \nand not a pest that you would like the get rid of?  I think one of Jackson \nGalaxy's goals is to educate humans enough so that they'll know in advance \nwhat taking care of a cat entails, so that you know whether you are willing \nto devote the time, money and LOVE to it!

A slight whiff will remind them of the unpleasantness. (The \n'pretreatment' seems cruel, but works better than just peppering the cord, \nand it may save kitty from much worse than a single experience of hot lips.)\n#2: Another set of cords was irresistable to one kitten (who apparently \nlikes spicy food) so I placed the whole 'tangle' inside a pillowcase until \nshe grew up.\n#3 is plastic tubing. Get a few yards of flexible tubing from a hardware \nstore (many types available), slit it all along one side and push the cord \ninside it for an extra protective layer. (Since only a few inches of my \nDust Buster cord is exposed to cats, I just encased it in a tube from an \ne-cigarette.) I guess kitties don't enjoy the tubing  \u2014 not as chewy as the \ncord \u2014 and now just leave cords alone.",

They will cry \nat first for food if they don't have it in their faces always, but try to \nfeed them some time after you wake up, maybe half or even an hour after you \nwake and then an hour or 2 before you go to bed and they will go, like a \nclock, to the bathroom in the morning and evenings and this also makes it \neasier for you to clean the tub/shower/sink. My baby's timetable :)) : eat \nat 8 am, eat at 8-9 pm and pee and poop at about 7 am, pee one more time \naround 1 pm then pee at about 10-11 in the evening. The timetable usually \nvaries by half an hour sooner or later. When my other 2 cats were alive, \nthey had the same schedule. Food and tub took about 2 weeks to turn this \ninto a habit and you can adjust it to your schedule.\n\nI love my pets and I am glad we found a way to coexist with no litter :D",

                    "text": "+Gingerjake2 Well one of my cats also tried to pee in the toilet. But, by \nthe time I noticed it and went toward the bathroom, she was already falling \ninto the toilet. That was funny to watch, but not as funny when I had to \ngive her a bath right after that. The way I taught my first 2 cats to pee \nin the tub is to place a bit of litter next to the drain (just a tiny \namount) and after some time after they finished eating (they eat wet food \nand raw meat so they get plenty of hydration), I picked them up and put \nthem in the tub, showed them the drain and with my fingers I moved the \nlitter around a bit and then I left them there with the door closed (not 2 \ncats in the same bathroom. well they can be in the same bathroom if you \nallow the other to use either the sink or a shower cabin if you have one) \nuntil they peed or pooped. After that, they instinctively went back.\n\nI did keep a close eye on them for the first 2 days, just to make sure \nthere was no \"accident\". I also cleaned immediately after I noticed they \npeed/pooped because if it is kept clean, they will be encouraged to go \nback. A few days later, it did not matter if I did not clean immediately \nand they had to pee or poop cause they just moved to the other side of the \ndrain. I tend to clean right after cause I hear the noises of the claws on \nthe tub. They will try to use the tub as if it is a litter box so, even if \nit has no litter, they will still try to bury their feces. I always check \nthe tub when I get into the bathroom for whatever reason. But you don't \nhave to check cause as we all know, it stinks when they pee/poop :)) so \nyou'll know when something is up.\n\nSo, I decreased the amount of litter every day until there was no more \nlitter next to the drain and now I have a house completely free of litter. \nWith my third cat I did not even had to keep her in the bathroom when I was \nestimating she had to pee. Right after I got her home, knowing that she \nwould get nervous when she would have to go, I just had my eyes on her a \nbit more and when I thought she would have to pee I picked her up and \nplaced her in the tub and she did there what she needed to do. She had just \none accident probably the next week but she was still a baby and it is \nharder for them to control their bladder. Now, 6 months later, if I am in \nthe tub, she will just wait for me to finish washing, then I dry the tub \nand she gets in. So try to keep your tub dry (though they will go straight \nin, no matter what, if they need to go), use something to disinfect (I \ndon't recommend chlorine because of the scent and toxicity for them. Mix \napple vinegar with water and spray then wipe or use any other cleaning \nproduct that does not have chlorine), pick up the poop with some toilet \npaper and throw it into the toilet.\n\nI know I wrote a looong comment, but it does not take that much to get them \nused to this. I was still a kid when I first did this soo it is not the \nmost difficult thing in the world. Also, use a bag of the cheapest litter, \nyou don't need anything fancy to get them used to this (it might be \nrecommended that you change the litter you already use as they seem to not \nlike it) you need something that is odorless and you will probably end up \nthrowing away most of it anyway. And, if possible, allow them to have \nseparate drains to use ;)\n\nI adopted 2 kittens and an adult cat and fostered 5 kittens and adult cats \nin 15 years and this always worked. Some were a bit more stubborn, but it \ngave results in a few days.",

You may not like this idea, but \nyou might want to separate the cats entirely into their own living spaces \nfor a while, get them all new litter (recommend Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract at \nfirst, then his Precious Cat for later) and boxes (so there is no odor \nintroduced but their own), and leave them in their own spaces to use their \nown boxes for a while. Then, just gradually reintroduce them according to \nJackson's protocol. Leave their own litter boxes in their own separate \nspaces even after reintroducing, and maybe incorporate the third one as a \ncompletely new/clean one at the same time you reintroduce them. (maybe even \nscoop a poo from each kitty's separate box and put it into the third one \ntogether?? then no one gets to put their own scent in there and \"claim\" it \nfirst!)

He will either \njust sit there and watch me do my business, or handle his own business \nsimultaneously while he stares at me in a disturbing fashion. If I had to \ndescribe it, I would say that it's a very intent look. \nI suppose my question would be is this a normal behavior? It makes me \nuncomfortable, but I'm not sure how to redirect it. If I close the door and \ndon't allow him to enter with me he will sit outside the door and cry out \nin an almost tormented fashion. Am I upsetting him? Because he started to \nspray around the apartment almost immediately after I began to do so. I've \nlooked up many Youtube videos to no avail. \nI apologize if my post was too excessive. It's just such a weird issue I \nfelt it needed a bit of explanation. Comments and advice would be \nwonderful. I need to break this habit. He has already ruined my couch in \none of what I assume to be revenge attempts. I don't want to just peg him \nas an asshole and I don't want to have to lose him. My be won't put up with \nit much longer.\ufeff",

At first I thought that he was \nassociating me using the restroom as being his potty time too. When he was \nsuper tiny he used to hate the bathroom and only go in when I or my bf \nwould.
