As of right now, most of the world's money is based off \nreputation. When money is not based off a commodity(such as gold and \nsilver), there is nothing to stop a central bank from printing and \nprinting. In the case of the United States, the federal reserve, which is \nNOT a government agency, can print unlimited amounts of money without \nbacking it up with anything physical. In the event that the US defaults on \nit's debt to the Chinese or any other lender, the dollar will ultimately \ncollapse and could not be used as currency any longer. This is why you have \npeople stocking up on gold and silver for a catastrophic collapse of the \ndollar. Realistically, it's inevitable that it will happen but the only \nquestion is when and how. The only thing preventing something like this \nfrom occurring is the reputation of the United States and it's military \nstrength, as war will be the only way to stay relevant and powerful.",

Greece.\n\nAnother interesting point, while were looking at history of other \ncountries, The US is the only first world country to have national health \ncare (mostly) and an offensive military. Almost every other 1st world \ncountry has given up the whole military thing and gone for mainly health \ncare, while most of the militarily strong countries of the world remain 2nd \nor 3rd world status. Basically they can only afford one or the other \nwithout going into massive debt.... I wonder where the lesson is in all of \nthis....
