I live in the UK and it is one island which has three countries. \nEngland, Wales and Scotland. Each country is completely different from each \nother but we are united and are able to move around the island freely doing \ntrade, etc. If we were three seperate countries it would make life \ndifficult especially for the two smaller countries of Wales 5 million and \nScotland 5 million compared to Engand which has 54 million. England is \nconnected to France/Paris by the Eurotunnel which makes trade with Europe \neven easier for England than it was before so if Wales and Scotland wanted \nIndependence that new trade route/tourism etc may not be so accessible this \nis just one example of many",
