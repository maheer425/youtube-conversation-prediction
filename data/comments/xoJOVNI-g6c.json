Park, right? well i agree with you that a story \nline is better than the artists standing and mouthing the lyrics. but at \n2am's prev videos bighit successfully fused those two with perfect balance \nand harmony. I was NOT saying that I want 2am to stand and sing for their \nMVs, what I was saying is that why not make 2am as the actors?",
