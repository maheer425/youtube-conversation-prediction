It's literally \nsurrounded by the pacific ocean so it has those breezy 60s temperatures all \nyear long! And fog comes every night! That's such a unique climate. Better \nthan LA's in my opinion. Also how the city is built. Street after street of \nbeautiful row houses. That's perfect for me. It provides you that urban \nfeel and density but you can still have the space of your own house. Like \nas if it was a regular house. Just minus a front and backyard. But those \nsacrifices are worth it! San Francisco looks like a professionally built \nand well planned community! I want to visit this place real bad to get the \nfeel of it! And then when I'm older and get good money I'll move up north!\ufeff",
