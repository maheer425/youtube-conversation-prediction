                    "text": "Science Diet is not worth being used as a door stop. Guys, you need to look \nat the ingredients of your cat food - my rule is, as much NAMED meat as \npossible (such as for example 'chicken' or 'deboned turkey,') meat as the \nfirst ingredient, NO corn, NO wheat (these grains are VERY bad for our \ncarnivorous pets!) NO beet pulp (cats do NOT require fibre in their diets \nand neither do dogs - they are carnivores and their natural diet does NOT \ninclude it,) NO byproducts (usually the byproducts are not fit for human \nconsumption so they are not fit for your pet either) and please keep in \nmind that what grain or veggies that are in the food are of usually very \nlittle benefit to the cat. I will say that a food with berries such as \nblueberries or cranberries in it is a very good idea because they help \nacidify the urinary tract which helps prevent urinary crystals. It is also \nprudent to mention that dry kibble diets are inferior and that much better, \nhealth promoting diets are ones that are wet. If you can't afford raw and \nyou can't afford to feed straight canned food, then at least supplement \nyour cat's diet with canned food, or find a way to turn your cat's kibble \ninto wet food. (Chicken broth would probably do very well - make sure that \nit doesn't include onion or garlic which are poisonous to cats.) As a \ngeneral rule, any food available in a grocery store is no good. Cats don't \nneed fancy shapes or food colouring and they certainly do not need \nvegetables. They need meat from named sources and liquid in their diet (not \njust water on the side) because cats came from the Egyptian desert and out \nthere, animals get most of their water from their food because water just \nisn't usually readily available. As a result, most of our domestic cats are \nchronically dehydrated because they are never fed properly moist food. A \nmoist diet is the best preventative to most diseases, especially urinary \ntract crystals. Please educate yourself about pet nutrition! It's the best \nthing that you can do for your animal to promote your pet's long term \nhealth - and cats, when cared for properly, can easily live to 20 or more \nyears. One of my cats right now is 17 and going strong.",

My sweet, first cat I ever \nhad, went only downhill after that, and had to be put to sleep. (Thank God \nthere are vets here in my area who come to your home to perform that \nservice.) It was a rough lesson on trusting vets. I now feed raw, and I \nalso use a ceramic drinking fountain for my cats--not plastic.

Yes, the vets office may \nthink of you as being a major pain in the ass, but so what. We know our \npets better than anyone else.\n\nFor the past 2+ years one of my male cats has been dealing with UTIs and \nkidney infections. We went from him (and our other cats) being on Hills \nPrescription CD to their KD formula. Yet the problem still exists.\n\nHe will hold going to the bathroom until I go down to where the many litter \nboxes are. Which does not help in regards to UTIs. My vet says he does that \nbecause while the litter box represents pain to him, having me there makes \nhim feel safe. While I can ensure we are not dealing with a blockage \nsituation (something I have dealt with 2 times), it has also set up a \nbehavior issue.\n\nFor awhile it will seem like everything is on track. He goes when he needs \nto without me having to be there. Then if he perceives a change in some \nsituation in the house, then we are back to square one.\n\nRecently it was discovered he had gingivitis. While being treated for that, \nthey found an infected tooth. Thought maybe that was the root to the \nproblem with the urinary issue. As blood tests have shown nothing. \nBut......he decided to poop on the bed. I immediately called the vet to put \nhim back on antibiotics. The vet thinks this is a behavior issue so we are \ntrying him on fluoxetine.\n\n5 days into using it. He has times where he is really bitchy. Hissing and \ngrowling at the other cats and me, if I am trying to get him to use the \nlitter box. Usually when he hisses I know its because he needs to go to the \nbathroom. But last night he was really angry.\n\nSo this morning I was able to get another pee sample (I am getting really \ngood at doing this, lol) to see if he has another infection or if this \nincrease anger is due to the fluoxetine.\n\nThankfully my vet is easy to talk to and does not put me off when I am \ndiscussing what is going on.\n\nMy point in this long story (sorry I got going and could not stop. Maybe \nsomeone out there has had the same issue and can shed some light) is that \nyou have to keep searching for the root of the problem. Even if it means \nrepeated conversations with the vet. In the end, I may have to keep him on \na low dosage of antibiotics like we had to do with our Great Dane male who \nfor some unknown reason kept getting UTIs. The low dosage made a world of \ndifference.  ",
