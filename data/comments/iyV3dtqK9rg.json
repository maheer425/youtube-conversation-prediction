                "text": "This nation made teaching real science in the classroom a priority after \nWWII when it realized we were going to slip behind the rest of the world \nand the Soviets if we kept teaching creationism, which is like telling kids \nthat 2 + 2 = 7.\n\nIf the creationists had their way, we'd go back to peddling their personal \nbeliefs instead of the scientific method and future generations would be \njust as ignorant as they are---unable to develop the new medicines and \ntechnologies we need to advance as a species and as a nation.\n\nCreationists keep attacking evolution, as if that somehow proves them \nright---but it doesn't. Even IF they could prove evolution wrong, it \nwouldn't mean the creationists were right. Every theory or belief has to \nstand on its own. Creationism cannot be tested because it is simply a \nfaith. The flat-earth crowd can teach whatever it wants in the home or in \nchurch, but they should leave science alone.\ufeff",

There are also some Christian (and Kabbalah) interpretations of the \nEden story that points out that Genesis describes Eden as being separated \nfrom the rest of the world. It's described as being affixed in one of the \n\"firmaments\" above earth. So, technically, even if a Christian believes in \na literal Eden Evolution could simply describe the fate of Adam and Eve's \ndescendants, or what creatures led up to Adam and Eve. Technically in the \n3rd and 4th chapters of Genesis it's implied that other people existed \naside from Adam and Eve's family (their son Cain tells God he's afraid of \nbeing harmed by other people when he's forced to leave his family after \nmurdering Abel).

Any of the earth-based major natural events that \nhave occured... I would really not get into this because it's a whole other \nconversations and it's for entirely theoretical fun. I just don't have the \ntime for it and it's not on topic. Point is, there are other possibilities \nout there, and yes there might be many discoveries left that change our \nperspective. That's the point. You just want to think I'm a Creationist or \nreligious guy and I mean some act of God....you can't get over it.\n\nI really...actually...have no religious belief oh man. I do feel that \nscience has been handled like one the last 70 years and it's intentional. \nIt's sad that Evolutionists can't get over someome being outside of \nthese..camps. They are really not much different to Creationists to someone \nlike me.\n\n> \"No, that the universe is expanding is a fact, however.\"\n\nNo it is not a fact..Hubble's law was thought to be strong evidence for it. \nHowever, many many observations of Nebulae the last few decades have had \nconflicting redshifts areas and it's now heavily being reconsidered as a \nmeasurement of velocity. Plasma Cosmologists have had success treating it \nas a relative age-measurement. I know little beyond the theoretical \ndepictions and explanations so I'll stop with this.\n\nPoint is. Still lot's of discussion and discovery going on there, so maybe \njust hold up a little bit with fact.\nTry telling that to the 1000's of physicists who study the Electical \nUniverse models (based on Hannes Alfven theories and mathematics). \n\n>\"Because...?

It's funny that you criticise me for something you \ndo yourself.\"\n\nWell I'm actually ok with not knowing all the answers, so I don't go around \nclaiming fact on matters I find to be in their infancy - a bit different. I \nmerely raised an issue, which by definition, is outside the DNA sequence. \nBut yes, theoretically, it can be a glue (give one for you, as I actually \ndon't care about a ney or yey) but at this moment it seems to reflect \nDarwin's observations within an area that won't affect species change. I \nfind many Evolutionists are afraid of this topic and/or dismiss it's \nimportance...conveniently. \n\nYou're right I didn't explain myself, so touche. It's funny that everyone \nacts out much of what they criticize, part of human nature.\n\n>\"Which is fascinating, but does in no way negate the theory of evolution. \nEvolutionary theory does not demand constant change, a successful species \ncan exist mostly unchanged for a long time.\"\n\nThis is my issue. I am NOT NEGATING the theory of Evolution. I am NEGATING \nthe idea it is absolute fact. That's a huuuuge difference. My parents have \nOrigin of Species (the print is ~ 100 years old) and I actually appreciate \nthe work. \n\n>\"Then what is the Tiktaalik,  Mesohippus, Ambulocetus and (of course) the \nArchaeopteryx? And we have PLENTY of \"transitional\" fossils to the \nrelatively recent human evolution, you just ignore what's inconvenient,\"\n\n*Mesohippus I wouldn't include in there - nothing really strange to me. But \nI mean you might as well throw in a Platypus with a list like that.\n\nI ignore them because they aren't true transitional species since we don't \nhave their pre-cursor and post-cursor. \n\nThese are more like hybrids to what we know now...well Tiktaalik and \nAmbulocetus certainly are... but transitions of particular species? That's \nquite an assumption (theory to fit a theory) without evidence.\n\nLet's look at the Archaeopteryx since Paleontology has been a hobby for me \nsince I was 6. It's similar to a Compy with feathers. It was considered \nstrange a long time ago. Now we know feathers are common with many \ndinosaurs - it's not so strange. It's not a reptile-like bird hyrbrid - \nit's really just a dinosaur. You can play and argue it's a transitional \nspecies from a Compsognathus (which lived at the same time though) and some \nother unknown species (I'm guessing you want a bird) but that's reaching \nlike crazy.\n\n> \"Which is not all that strange. Allow me to construct a logical argument:\n1. Fossilization is very rare.\n2. Finding a fossil is even more rare.\n3. Therefore we are extremely unlikely to ever find anywhere near the whole \nevolutionary history of every species.\"\n\nYou don't need the whole line. I'm sure a 1-2-3 punch would be \nrevolutionary. But this is not what I meant. \nYou're missing :\n4. Therefore (take it out of 3), it seems like species all just come out of \nnowhere in the record without any precursors.\n\n> \"They're not volatile, they actually decay at a very stable rate.\nYou believe it can turn out to be a misleading tool based on...?

The magical line that \nprevents microevolution from becoming macroevolution over time is however \nsomething that is wholly unscientific.\"\n\nThe idea that micro becomes macro is highly theoretical - nothing wrong \nwith it until you come off with 'factual' claims again.\n\nLol another insinuation. You don't get it. This isn't a message board from \n2000. It's easy to see who I am, and I'm not going to publically claim to \nnot be a part of a faith when I am. \n\n> \"Yeah, and I'm sure you have no agenda whatsoever, people who argue \nagainst evolution never do...\"\n\nMy Agenda is clear. To want to see science get out of this black hole and \nthe arrogance of know it alls. Claiming fact for theories really pisses me \noff. Having these lies stifle the exploration and development of our \nsciences disgusts me. Having alternative theories, be ridiculed and \nrejected constantly because they aren't the norm or the 'facts' disgusts \nme. To see this behaviour in all aspects of life exposes it but also gives \nme more occurances to hate and want to attack it.\n\n> \"Wikipedia: Religionis an organized collection of beliefs, cultural \nsystems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence.\nAtheism is a BELIEF not a FACT so yes it IS a religion.\"\n\n>\"Let's see, atheism is not a organized collection of beliefs (it's one \nnon-belief /belief), has no \"cultural system\", is not a world view (for the \nsame reason that it's not a collection of beliefs) and does not relate \nhumanity to an order of existance. All beliefs are not religion, to believe \nin ghosts is not a religion and to not believe in santa claus or the tooth \nfairy is not a religion.\"\nI corrected that before you responded, I meant Evolutionists but it doesn't \nmatter because it's not simply a belief any more.

The theoretic timelines were always \ntoo long from what we've obtained but they are also sloppy science because \nwe don't have any true measure's of change in reality - only assumed direct \nancestral lines of what we've found and their dated samples (mostly \nradiometric) to try and recreate the line. That's hardly exact in any way, \nso many potential holes and so many assumptions needed to even begin.\n\nWhen you consider the length of time so many species have gone unchanged, \nit doesn't seem to fit at all (maybe we are missing important discoveries \nto achieve this).

Oh year circular \nlogic.\nDarwin stipulated the idea turned theory, in one of the moments of \nreflection he remarked on the biological parallels of an Orang-utan and \nman.

A \ntrend particular to theocracies and even in my homeland there are people \nalive today or dead no longer than one generation that barely even got a \nhigh school level education because their schools were organized by \nchurches and focused primarily on theological studies.\nTime spent studying the qur'an is time not spent studying to be the next \nleading nuclear physicist or evolutionary biologist. \n\nYou could have a million polymaths teaching, but from the result it is so \nobvious that it did not lead to any significant educational change, not to \nmention, you had those polymaths educating BEFORE Islam too, so that is not \nas accomplishment of Islam even in itself.\nSo the question arises, with so many Polymaths teaching at Arabic \nuniversities, how come you have not made a single scientific contribution \nsince the dark ages (golden age of Islam)?\nThe obvious conclusion to anyone that's done any research surrounding the \nissue, is that Ghazali rejected skepticism (the basis for science) and \nhence stopped practically all scientific advancement in the Muslim world.\n\n\"The challenge has to do with the unique literary structure of the \nclassical Arabic language.\"\nAnd that is not exactly what i was talking about... why?\nI talked precisely about the literary structure and how it had lifted from \nrelated religions and pre-existing literature around the time of it's \nfounding. But this somehow has not registered in your brain yet.\nI understand the challenge perfectly well, i am not so certain that you \nunderstand that it can and has been faced and defeated, only denied by \ndishonest apologists and theologians. \n\nScience fiction is neither science nor fiction, but it lends heavily from \nboth.\nThe particular literary classification of the Arabic original Qur'an is no \ndifferent. It is classified as rhymed prose, it is neither prose nor \npoetry, because it was an attempt at creating a new literary form by \nlending from both poetry and prose without becoming either.\nWhich becomes obvious upon seeing that the text is more prose-like in some \nareas and more poetic in others.\nIn other words, identical to sci-fi.\nSometimes star trek gets more scientifically accurate, and other times it \ngoes almost entirely fiction.\nThis is a tell tale sign of a literary hybrid category. And the Qur'an is \nno different.\n\nOf course the dark age pagans and christian linguists would call it unique, \nthey had not seen that particular variety of prose and poetics yet.\nThis does not say anything about it actually being something inimitable \nwhich is the Muslim challenge.\nAnd just BTW, the dark age Christians in particular would not want to admit \nthe distinct similarity to their gospels because that would diminish the \nvalue of the bible.\n\nIt's actually quite mundane and entirely in line with what i expect from \nresearching religious systems.",

The encounter with *skepticism* led \nal-Ghazali to embrace a form of theological occasionalism, or the belief \nthat all causal events and interactions are not the product of material \nconjunctions but rather the immediate and present Will of God.\n\nThe Incoherence also marked a turning point in Islamic philosophy in its *vehement \nrejections of Aristotle and Plato*. The book took aim at the falasifa, a \nloosely defined group of Islamic philosophers from the 8th through the 11th \ncenturies (most notable among them Avicenna and Al-Farabi) who drew \nintellectually upon the Ancient Greeks.

It essentially comes down to them \nnot being muslims. He was discouraging of anything not supported by the \nqur'an, which in itself is a hinderance to science because Islam is all \nabout adherence to old rules (qur'an and islam) while science is all about \nquestioning old conventions.\nThe two are polar opposites and can only coexist by putting one on the \nshelf while they are using the other, which is what scientists of any \nreligion do.\n\n\"Genome Project?

It's more \nimportant than the advancements in physics, astronomy, maths and especially \nmedicine the Muslims made?\"\n\nI'm glad you'll take a look, and i hope what you find amazes you.\nBut somehow i doubt it as you seem to be of the mind that ~200 years of \nmeager advancement in those fields outweigh the now close to 2000 years of \nadvancements made by the western world.\nThe very machine you write this on is a product of the philosophy that \nAl-ghazali discounted for not being islamic enough.\n\nBut i'm gettign the feeling that you're one of those that believe all the \nislamic propaganda being published where pretty much every advancement ever \nmade is attributed to the qur'an with either vague or nonexistent \nexplanations oh how or why this is the case.(\"1001 islamic discoveries\" for \nexample is a good read for a laugh)\n\nNo, it very much refers to the fresh water (palatable and sweet) and salt \nwater (salt and bitter) And it very clearly states the two can not mix, \nwhich is simply wrong, and would be expected to be wrong if it was written \nby primitive humans.\nThe word (sea) from the qur'an actually translates from the original arabic \nas water, so that's a bit of dishonest editing done right there for the \npurpose of furthering this dishonest attempt to legitimize the qur'an which \nyou would think if it was so miraculous would stand on it's own merit.\n\nMuslim schools miseducates about evolution by outright and knowinlgy \nignoring the science on it that clearly demonstrate that humans evolved \njust like animals did.\nAnd by neglecting to teach this to the kids, they can not grow to become \nthe next leaders in science or medicine because they lack the proper \nunderstanding in biology.\nThey can become doctors, but only by either working locally and at \nalternative medicine clinics or by studying abroad, which again is harder \nbecause they lack the proper understanding they should have gotten instead \nof the dogma.\n\nAnd i have yet to hear about a single muslim school educate about \nabiogenesis. Which is to be expected, that would mean the entire creation \nstory be thrown out. Which is such a terrifying concept to muslims, who are \nso heavily invested in their religion that they would rather die than see \ntheir religion fade into just another fiction.\nI mean seriously, why the insistence on humans being a miracle? have you so \nlittle to feel accomplished about that you need to resort to mental \nmasturbation rather than acknowledge the marvel of our evolution?\n\nOh yes, because getting an explanation from a scholar is truly a path to \nknowledge. You know, as opposed to investigating it personally and finding \nout that the original word was not Sea, it was Water. Which makes sense as \nthese were people who believed alchemy to be real and saw water in all \nforms as just manifestations of the element of water.\nIt is clearly as it is written a matter of drinking water (fresh water: \npalatable) not mixing with ocean water. (salt)\nAnd the fact that the translations have changed to sea in later years only \nshow how far apologists will go.\n\nIt's not an insult, it is just a statement based on observation, you have \nvery little education on matters such as human evolution other than simply \nacknowledging essentially \"that is what you believe\" and speaking of \nevolution, without our understanding of evolution, there is no way we could \nhave mapped our genome anywhere even close to so completely.\nThe human genome project is a testament to the fact that humans evolved.",

These are your best examples of \npeople that contributed.

But the difference is, \nwhen it's politics or economics for example we can prosecute them for \nfraud. But for a variety of reasons, religion is given preferential \ntreatment, because it is their \"belief\" (despite the fact we know many of \nthe leaders knowingly lie) we cannot touch them because that would violate \ntheir freedom of religion.\nI'm not talking persecution here, only advocating an end to religious \neducational facilities based on the fact that they more often than not \nknowingly teach doctrine over evidence.\n\n\"science is not always the answer\"\nWhat gave us the answer to what causes disease? What gave us the answer to \nour origins? what gave you the answer to how to talk to me right now? \nScience. Whatever it hasn't solved by now, it will solve eventually, and if \nwe haven't, an alien species more advanced than us may already have, using \ndeductive processes very similar to our process of science.\nThe whole \"science cannot give us all the answers\" argument is a weak \ncop-out. I'm not advocating using only science, but excusing the \nmiseducation of children too young to know the damage that is being done to \nthem is simply abhorrent. \nWe're talking indoctrinating children who could easily be the next leaders \nin science or engineering or even art, in order to further the interest of \na religion.\n\nYou can be incredibly smart and still believe in fantasy for a multitude of \nreasons, in fact a rather big chunk of scientists (across all fields) are \nreligious, but most of them know to leave their religion at home, because \nit is not helpful at work.\n\nWho's talking black and white? there are hundreds of variants and i already \nsaid earlier that there are a ton of religious schools that are pretty much \nsecular in how they teach and what they teach, being religious in name and \nappearance only. But those schools would do just as well if they were not \nreligious, and those that are not these schools would do even better. If \nhaving an educated next generation is not in the best interest of the \npeople, then we have failed as a society.\nWe would end up having doctors come out with full honors who promote \nnothing but the sugar water that is homeopathy, or abstinence only, and who \nrefuse to save a woman's life because abortion goes against religious \nteachings.\nToday, these doctors have doctorate degrees only because they got them from \nreligious educational schools, and that's already bad enough.\n\nNo, i did not, for example, i had no say in what my name would be, or \nwhether or not to be baptized, but that is EXACTLY my point. Children do \nnot get a say, and so they are easy picking for the religious systems. They \nopen schools and tell all their sheep to enroll their children and then \ngeneration by generation they perpetuate falsehoods that benefit the \nreligion at the expense of the individual children that would have become \ngreat in the career they would have chosen without this interference.\n\nMy parents were secular, my ideology is not theirs when it comes to matters \nof religion, education and science. \nThat, i formed on my own.\n\n\"As an Atheist I believe, as an individual do not believe\" The hell does \nthis mean?\nAs an atheist, you by definition do not believe.\nLet me guess, you're either faking your atheism, not educated on what it \nmeans to be an atheist, or just horribly butchered what you intended this \nto mean. Judging by the context, i'm guessing the last option.\nActually, you DO have a say in the practices of others, because their right \nto swing their arms flailing around ends at another individual's personal \nspace or property. Likewise someone's right to tell lies ends at the point \nwhere their lies cause harm, like for example corrupting a child's mind \nsuch that a higher education becomes either very difficult, or nigh on \nimpossible.\n\n\"It is so harmful to knowledge, but look at what knowledge brought us.\"\nOh no! fire bad! fire hurt hand! must not use fire to cook cause fire burn \nhand, must not use fire to warm house cause fire burn hand.\nHere's a newsflash, those are bad,. and i agree, but look at the amazing \nthings knowledge have done that are either not bad, or actively developed \nto stop those bad things you just mentioned.\nOverpopulation is being combated by for example sex-ed, engineering, gmo's \n(the science, not the companies) food replicators, etc.\nPollution is handled also with education, as well as by development of \nalternative and renewable energy sources and fuels, and research into \nemission controls.\nWeapons of mass destruction are made by military by applying knowledge that \nwas made for better purposes, it is a corruption, but without it, we might \nnever be ready should there ever come a day where we encounter other \nsentient life. If they exist, they might not necessarily be friendly.\n\n\"And what happens when knowledge is misused. Hitler believed in the theory \nof evolution\"\nSeriously? It is arguments like this that makes me doubt it when you call \nyourself an atheist.\nIt makes me think you're only posing as one to troll.\nHitler did not believe in evolution, he believed in a principle that was \nbased on a social misunderstanding of what the theory actually was. It's \ncalled eugenics.\nAnd everything indicates that hitler himself was a catholic as was most of \nhis troops, those that were not protestant or some other denomination and \nvery likely a creationist.\n\nYes, people are people, and as i already said, some people will always seek \nto abuse others, but that is why we have laws.",

It's \nmore consistent with the rest of the Bible since the Bible states more than \nonce that God doesn't want to visit the sins of the father on the heads of \nthe son (which contradicts \"Original Sin\"). The New Testament has several \nverses which imply God intended from the beginning that Humanity would \nbecome corrupt and require a Messiah, and that Christ was planned before \nHumanity even came into existence. That would be consistent with that one \nChristian theory that God intentionally planted the Tree of Knowledge of \nGood and Evil in plain sight for Adam and Eve knowing they would eventually \neat from it and set his plan in motion to redeem humanity in the future.",

                    "text": "+TSyoutubin - Original Sin is actually not mentioned in the Bible, that's \nactually just a theory some Christians came up with in early medieval times \nby St. Augustine of Hippo. It's a belief that was possibly influenced by \nhis previous Manichean Gnostic views that the physical world is hopelessly \ncorrupt and corrupts all physical things (a common view in Gnosticism). Not \nall Christians ever accepted that theory and there's been a growth in \nChristians today who don't buy that theory. Pelagius was an early Christian \nrebel who didn't buy into St. Augustine's theory. Those who don't accept \n\"Original Sin\" believe humans choose to sin of their own free will.\n\n\"He set them up to disobey him, and he got angry at them for disobeying him\"\n\nI'm not sure if he's so much angry as telling them in a matter-of-fact \nmanner the consequences of their actions. The Hebrew Bible portrays God as \nobsessed with purity and (spiritual) cleanliness, and thus banished Adam \nand Even since they became spiritually impure/unclean since they just \nengaged in a sin (they lied to God initially when he asked what happened). \nOne of the more radical Christian theories is that God intentionally wanted \nthem to eat from the Tree so that they would know the difference between \nGood and Evil on their own. Humanity would then have to work their way back \nto being reunited with God through the effort of learning what to do with \nthe knowledge of Good and Evil rather than staying in the Garden ignorant \nas small children. Sort of like how parents will sometimes let their \nchildren learn how the world works or become more knowledgeable and mature \nby allowing them to mess up and suffer the consequences of their mess ups \nrather than constantly saving their kids from making a mistake.\n\nWhen I was a Christian I liked that theory. IMO it made the most sense (and \nstill now makes some of the most sense of any Christian theory I've ever \nheard). ",

Something about the story about \nthe tree feels that way, maybe more like a vicious circle created by God. \nHe set them up to disobey him, and he got angry at them for disobeying him \nand left the blame (original sin) on their and humanity's shoulders.

                    "text": "+roger midar The apostles were illiterate. Education takes money. You have \nto actually pay for a teacher. Which apostles were rich enough for that? \nThere are no Biblical historians who say the apostles were literate. Also \nthe apostles names were put to the books but that does not mean anything. \nThey were written anonymously at different times with the earliest being \nmore than 30 years later. There are no contemporary accounts of Jesus life, \nteachings, words or deeds. If you have sources for any let me know but I've \nread the works of Biblical scholars who have seen the available evidence \nand are fluent in the ancient tongues of the time and they disagree. Have \nyou ever heard of The Jesus Seminar? Here is a synopsis from  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Seminar\n\n\"The Jesus Seminar was a group of about 150 critical scholars and laymen \nfounded in 1985 by Robert Funk under the auspices of the Westar Institute\"\n\n\"According to the seminar, Jesus was a mortal man born of two human \nparents, who did not perform nature miracles nor die as a substitute for \nsinners nor rise bodily from the dead. Sightings of a risen Jesus were \nnothing more than the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather \nthan physical encounters\"\n\n\"Unconcerned with canonical boundaries, they asserted that the Gospel of \nThomas may have more authentic material than the Gospel of John.\"\n\nAll aside the main point of the above is to show you that doing honest \nresearch will not get you to the answer that the Bible is true, accurate \nand correct. The experts - the people in the know who have studied, \nexamined and documented the available evidence - tend to disagree.\n\nAlso you say \"well if you didn't know,people back then had really sharp \nmemories and also they where inspired by the holy spirit to remember just \nlike Jesus said they would\"\n\nThe first part needs some evidence. It seems like a hopeful statement. The \nsources of the anonymous authors of the 4 gospels are unknown so you can't \nsay that the stories are based on memories rather than made up.  There have \nbeen plenty of scientific studies and research on memory. It is not such a \nmysterious entity.  Here is an interesting article on how the human memory \nworks:\n\nhttp://www.human-memory.net/processes_recall.html\n\nHere is a scientific study on how memory can alter over time:\n\nhttp://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112697785/human-brain-memory-telephone-game-092012/\n\nHere is an interesting scientific study on how memories of even the biggest \nevents (the 911 attacks) can be altered in the minds of people (you'd think \nwith all of the coverage they got that memories could not get distorted) \nafter such a short time:\n\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/09/memories.aspx\n\nHere is a scientific article on how false memories can be created \nintentionally, maliciously or by suggestion of the person hearing the story:\n\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/eloftus/Articles/sciam.htm\n\nHere is another article on distorted memories:\n\nhttp://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=57592",

No earthquake and no massive \ninflux of formerly dead people is mentioned",

I \ndid double check your work and from what I can see you are correct on what \nyou said about Paresce.  Also, thank you for pointing out how trying to \ndebunk a well known and researched cosmological argument has absolutely \nnothing to do with Evolution.\n\nIf proving that the creator of a particular theory or law did not have a \ncomplete understanding of its complexity nullified the entirety of the law \nthen shouldn't we all be floating around? After all, Newtonian physics, was \nfound to be incomplete with Einstein's theory of relativity.  Sure it works \nin most situations, but it falls apart when you approach the speed of light \nor in a particularly strong gravitational fields.  Even those have been \nshown to be incomplete when you reach something with the level of black \nholes.\n\nNeither Newton or Darwin were proven wrong, they were shown to be \nincomplete.  As our knowledge grows we expand on their models and come \ncloser to what is actually happening.\n\nEven then, even if everything in Darwin's theory was proven false, we would \nthen have to find a way to figure out how things actually changed over \ntime.  There is no legitimate debate in Science to show that things have \nnot changed over time.  You would have to explain the similarity in the \ngenome, the shared characteristics, the fossils, why whales have the gene \nto grow legs that sometimes manifests to this day, ring species, and many \nmany more things.\n\nThere are 2 different types of Evolution.  The fact of evolution, this is \nthe observed patterns, changes, and all of the evidence. Then there is the \ntheory of evolution that describes how those changes happen.  Trying to \npoke holes in Darwin's theory and claim that the fact of evolution is wrong \nis like reading a book in another language that you do not understand and \nclaiming it is not really a book.  The theory is our understanding of how \nthe evidence fits together.  \n\nIts a jigsaw puzzle.  Sometimes you put in the wrong piece or have a gap \nfor a little while, but that doesn't mean that the pieces aren't there, \nthat they don't all go together. We just haven't put it all together yet. \nDarwin basically opened the box and started putting the outline together. \n Since then Scientists from many different fields have worked to correct \nand fill in the pieces and we have a very clear picture coming through. \n There could be a piece missing here or there, and maybe something got put \nin the wrong spot in one of the difficult areas, but for the most part it \nis very convincing.\n\nIf anyone is truly interested in learning about evolution and not just \nquote mining, talkorigins.org does a great job.",

They make perfect sense. But understand, that Charles \nDarwin himself said, natural selection does NOTHING until the favourable \nvariation CHANCES to occur. (emphasis made by me)\nMicro evolution and NS = true and observable\nMutations and Macro evolution = mutations always harmful or very least, \nneutral. Macro evolution (crossover from one species to another) = \nimpossible.\nEvolution Theory (minus NS and microE) can be debunked in three ways:\na) Origin of the common ancestor, usually a single celled organism \n(amoeba), cannot be answered and demonstrated.\nb) No evidence in fossil records of transitional forms, those put forward \nare very ambiguous and extremely subjective.\nc) No evolutionary mechanism in nature to explain how all species and \norganism arose.  \n\n2) ''Bullshit''???\n Here you go (below).....but I guess you going to deny your way out of this \none as well.\n\n''After years of striving to explain the mind on the basis of brain-action \nalone, I have come to the conclusion that it is simpler (and far easier to \nbe logical) if one adopts the hypothesis that our being does consist of two \nfundamental elements [brain and mind (or soul)]. \u2026Because it seems to be \ncertain that it will always be quite impossible to explain the mind on the \nbasis of neuronal action within the brain\u2026 I am forced to choose the \nproposition that our being is to be explained on the basis of two \nfundamental elements.\" [brain and mind, or body and soul]\n(Wilder Penfield, The Mystery of the Mind: A Critical Study of \nConsciousness and the Human Brain, Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton \nUniversity Press, 1975, p. 80)\n\n''What is it that gives a particular person his individual identity? Is it, \nto some extent, the very atoms that compose his body? Is his identity \ndependent upon the particular choice of electrons, protons, and other \nparticles that compose those atoms? There are at least two reasons why this \ncannot be so. In the first place, there is a continual turnover in the \nmaterial of any living person's body. This applies in particular to the \ncells in a person's brain, despite the fact that no new actual brain cells \nare produced after birth. The vast majority of atoms in each living cell \n(including each brain cell)\u2014and, indeed, virtually the entire material of \nour bodies\u2014has been replaced many times since birth. The second reason \ncomes from quantum physics\u2026If an electron in a person's brain were to be \nexchanged with an electron in a brick, then the state of the system would \nbe exactly the same state as it was before, not merely indistinguishable \nfrom it! The same holds for protons and for any other kind of particle, and \nfor whole atoms, molecules, etc. If the entire material content of a person \nwere to be exchanged with corresponding particles in the bricks of his \nhouse then, in a strong sense, nothing would have happened whatsoever.''\n\n(Roger Penrose, The Emperor's New Mind, Penguin Books, 1989, pp. 24-25, \n(emphasis added))\n\nIn short, what makes human beings human is not a material quality; it is a \nspiritual one, and it is clear that its source is an entity apart from \nmatter.\nIn the conclusion of his book, Penrose says:\n\n''Consciousness seems to me to be such an important phenomenon that I \nsimply cannot believe that it is something just \"accidentally\" conjured up \nby a complicated computation. It is the phenomenon whereby the universe's \nvery existence is made known.''\n(Roger Penrose, The Emperor's New Mind, Penguin Books, 1989, p. 448)\n\n3) You clearly don't understand what I'm saying to you, do you? I was \nreferring to the eye argument that Charles Darwin mentioned, in order to \ndemonstrate the problems atheists have, the moment they start thinking \nobjectively.\n''Human eye is nothing special'', are you serious?.....you really do not \nappreciate the complexity involved in the structure of ALL eyes.\n\nTo answer your last paragraph:\nThis is where, unless you think rationally and objectively, you are going \nto go round in circles. It takes a CONSCIOUS and INTELLIGENT human being to \nput together a watch, phone, sandcastle, car, plane etc. Without \nconsciousness and intelligence, those things would not come to be. \nSo how did the first single cell, for example, as its the simplest organism \non Earth, come about?\nYour answer will be natural causes......a cause that according to you, has \nno conscious, no iota of intelligence, and has somehow managed to construct \na cell, greater in complexity than any man made device on earth. (Can you \nsee the problem here?)\nMy answer is that behind the Natural Causes (which I don't deny), lies \nan underlying conscious and intelligent force, that was present in order to \nbring about a cell, otherwise Natural Cause without consciousness and \nintelligence, is just randomness nothingness. \nAt this point, you will mention the Natural Law (a collection of laws \npresent throughout universe and on Earth), which I also believe in and \nobserve. My question to yourself is....were these Laws themselves, a \nproduct of randomness nothing....or a product of a Programmer?\n\nSo it really is quite simple, if you choose to open your mind......whether \nyou look at the Origin of Universe (through the Big Bang), the Laws present \nthroughout, the origin of life, structures in organisms, ultimately, \nconsciousness and intelligence must of been present, otherwise, you will \nchoose to believe in ''randomness nothingness''.
