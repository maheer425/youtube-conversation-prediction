If we never had freedom in the first place then the efforts of \namerican generations in the past may have been in vain but right now we are \nthe only ones that aren't even trying.\n\nYou know why? Cause of the fucking American dream. Go to school, graduate, \nhope you make it into a university or just go to college, party your ass \noff, get married and have kids after getting a job that you're satisfied \nwith, watch you kids grow up and go to college, and then get old and die \nbefore you become too much of a burden on your family or become known as \nthe cranky old guy who needs a hip replacement every week.\n\nIn reality, that's generally what living to the fullest is. A life of doing \nwhat your supposed to do and settling down enjoying the ride of life while \nthe rich suck up all the money you could have had after fighting for your \nrights. Chances are, that's what your trading your freedom for, maybe a \nlife of fun partying or a life of seriousness being another part moving \nalong in the workforce.\n\nI just want to do something so that others won't have to live through this \nfucked up situation.\nFuck me, right?",

                "text": "Once again I would like to say nice work Snowden. Except theres 1 problem. \nThe NSA isnt watching hundreds of millions of people. Theyre watching \npsychos, sociopaths, terrorists, pedophiles, drug cartels, organized crime. \nUnless youre one of the listed people you have nothing to fear. If you do \nfear the NSA and FBI, youre either one of the listed people, or youre doing \nsomething you shouldnt be, something that would be condemned by the sane \nrealist part of society if it ever got out what youre doing. Also, there \nwas even a great example a few months ago, when the FBI caught 150 sex \ntraffickers and saved 105 teens. Nobody was bitching about all the \nsurveillance and privacy invading then, everybody was just happy with the \nfinal result. So why bitch about it every other day? Just be happy when the \nsick criminal minds end up in prison or dead. Law abiding people lose no \nfreedom, no privacy, or anything else. Theyre not the ones being watched. \nNow before you try to come back with Ben Franklin's quote \"those who give \nup freedom for security will lose both\" Im also going to make a quote. \n\"Those who try to exploit the freedom and constitutional rights they got to \nget away with their own sick minded actions from justice, deserve neither \nand will lose both.\" Im all for guns, as in I believe everybody should have \nas many guns as they feel necessary to their own safety, but Im all against \nidiots who think there should be no law enforcement at all, or who want to \nmake law enforcement useless against criminals. Before 2001 everybody got \nfreedom and maximum privacy in the US, not just American citizens. And look \nwhat was the result in 2001 september. A few people exploited, used that \nfreedom against the US. Im not doing anything illegal, I have no sick \nminded thoughts like looking at dead bodies or naked kids on the internet, \nI can almost guarantee the NSA and FBI wont even look at me. And people who \nwant to do something that would harm others, Im only happy if theyre being \nlooked at with a microscope and are losing all their freedom and privacy. \nPeople in the US are actually not in a bad position, you can protect \nyourselves with guns, and have the rights to protect yourselves, freedom, \nrights, and have the tools to protect these rights (guns). But what about \npeople who live in a country with strict gun control? If one of the listed \npeople is walking next to me in the street I wanna know about it. I also \nwanna know about it if I send my kid to school and he has a teacher who \nwants to do more than just teach him. All Snowden did was make America's \nenemies happy. It also sure seems like he wants to give the people I listed \n(psychos, sociopaths, terrorists, pedophiles, drug cartels) the little \nwindows they need to escape from justice. The chaos loving psychos need to \nbe watched 24/7, Snowden practically ensured that they now know the NSA's \nactivities, and they'll know how to get around the NSA and get away with \ntheir sick minded actions. Also the people who keep mentioning the 4th \nAmendment, or keep riding the high horse on \"They have no right to \ninvestigate anything without probable cause\" see the problem with that is, \nthat the listed people use that and the 4th amendment as little windows to \navoid getting caught. Some people (chaos loving psychos) want to put the \nsick criminals in an advantage against law enforcement. Without somekind of \n\"privacy invading\" these people will never be caught, cuz as I said they \nhave little windows they use to get away. If criminals evolve, so does law \nenforcement has to evolve, as long as criminals exist that go to a certain \nlevel to get away, there needs to be agencies/law enforcement that act as \nthe opposite equal counterpart of the listed people, in order to catch \nthem. I support the US Constitution all the way, but I see Snowden and the \nlisted people as people who want to destroy America/peaceful citizens.\nTelling everybody how the NSA works is like when theres a bank robbery and \nthe police would call the robbers on cellphone telling them \"hey you better \nprepare yourselves we're coming\". It makes no sense. Innocent people have \nnothing to worry about and lose no freedom or privacy, while the listed \npeople lose it all.\nThough I will get overwhelmingly negative votes, I also probably wont get a \nproper arguement. Not as long as the internet is not IQ restricted, anybody \nbelow 120 should be locked the heII out of the internet, thats extremely \nbad news for conspiracy theorists, listed people, etc. Cuz then they \nwouldnt be able to spread their stupidity, confusing others and causing \nchaos.\nLastly, what about other countries' spying? What about germany's spying? \nRussia spies on the whole world, and not with a good intention to protect \nits citizens like the US. China? Spies on the whole world too, stealing \nbillions of dollars worth of information and technology then selling it as \ntheir own making billions of dollars. But nobody cares about that. Wheres \nthe outrage? Wheres the media coverage? Looks like hypocrisy coming from \nthe anti NSA and anti US dumbaxxes. And now let the down votes begin from \nall the psychos and pedophiles who are constantly on these articles \nfighting against the NSA and FBI with all theyve got.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Kristian Harper I love your comment, cuz you gave me a perfect reason to \ndestroy and humiliate you. Youre brainwashed completely by propaganda and \nthats a fact. First of all, the typical \"oh oh history book history book\" \nbullshit. It depends on where you learned history, that the person writing, \ntelling, teaching it is leaned towards the west or east. Now as history \nproved, N America (the west) doesnt have a reason to lie about history, \ntherefore their history sources are the most accurate and reliable by far. \nBut eastern countries (eastern Eu, asia, etc) have the most reason to lie \nabout history and to fabricate information into whatever helps their cause \nand into whatever makes them look better in history, it literally is about \nsaving face. Its been about that for a century in the east. Therefore \nwhatever the east says is pretty much a lie and unreliable, and invalid, \nespecially about history.\nSecond of all, the US gov. giving money to Al Q? See this is why I dont \nargue with brainwashed idiots, youre so ignorant about things that I could \nwrite a 100 line comment explaining why youre wrong. Millions were \nsuffering under the Soviet Union, the west wanted to stop it. And the \nAfghan-Soviet war was another battleground in the cold war between the west \nand east. The US support to the mujahideen to fight the soviets. Years \nlater from the members of the mujahideen, formed Al Q and the taliban, and \nbefore your brainwashed mind wants to bitch about indirectly supporting Al \nQ and the taliban, why dont YOU learn real history and realize it was the \nfuckin cold war, that was priority 1, and nobody had any idea what Al Q and \nthe taliban would do. When the Soviet Union collapsed thanks to going \nbankrupt and to other economic reasons created by the west, the iron \ncurtain disappeared and west and east Europe got reunited which changed the \nentire world. Millions were saved, on top of that east Europe got reunited \nwith an already strong economy of west Europe, which had a strong economy \nthanks to the Marshall Financial Aid given by the evil west (the US). \nHowever you put it, no matter what propaganda you brainwash yourself with, \nthe west and east are uncomparable, they are light years apart even today \nin terms of economy, morals, human rights, freedom, mentality, etc.\nThird, in regards to you being completely brainwashed and delusional, let \nme show you some real numbers that werent created by conspiracy nutjobs who \nwant to cause as much chaos confusion and hate as possible, but was created \nby reality. In the Iraqi war, about 125 000 people died. About 75% of the \ncivilian deaths were caused by insurgents and al q, due to not caring at \nall who they shoot, or who they blow up. Thats about 95 000 civilians \nkilled by insurgents and al q. The rest of the civilian deaths, are divided \namong the Iraqi military, the US, the UK, Poland, Australia, Peshmerga. \nAbout 50% of the civilians deaths by friendly forces was caused by the \nIraqi military. The remaining 50%, is divided among the US, the UK, Poland, \nAustralia, Peshmerga. So in reality friendly forces have only killed about \n31 000 civilians, and even half of that was by the Iraqi military.\nIn Afghanistan the case is even more obvious. About 20 000 civilians have \ndied in the Afghan war so far, and 80% was caused by the taliban and \ninsurgents, thats 16 000 killed by the taliban and insurgents, the \nremaining 4000 is divided among the Afghan military and police, the US, the \nUK, and the rest of the 40 nations' forces that are in Afghanistan. I say \nwe're doing good, despite what the propaganda sources tell you.",

Read a history textbook and you \nwill see the various attempts by westerners to gain control of the oil in \nthe middle east e.g Suez Canal Crisis 1956, the Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan and the US Government giving the Al-Qaeda money and weapons to \nfight the Russians, invasion of Iraq, invasion of Afghanistan etc. These \naren't some kind of crazy conspiracy propaganda bullshit, they are fact. \nThey happened. And one of the main reasons for these various actions is to \nmaintain the price and flow of oil to the west.\n\nIn regards to the US and UK Governments being the terrorists, just look at \nthe numbers. Over 2,000 US citizens dies as a result of 9/11, which was one \nof the main justifications for invading Iraq. It is then estimated that \naround 400,000 Iraqis died as a result of the invasion and occupation, with \nthe majority of them being innocent men, women, and children. This is not \neven counting the casualties of the war in Afghanistan, or the subsequent \ndrone strikes in other countries such as Yemen and Pakistan. Again, this is \nnot propaganda bullshit.

These are reasons for constitutions to protect the \npeople in a real, functional democracy. These are the so-called laws you \nclaim need to be created. They already exist, and are ignored.  Spying has \nno place in a democracy without a legitimate cause.  People who work on \nthings that question the current environment (oil, NSA, etc) become targets \nfor abuse a la East German stasi.  Such is wrong, and there is absolutely \nno justification.  These groups of people are the 1% thugs that need \nregulating with existing rules to protect the public.
