I also believe that most of the religions \nare similar and is was the writers of religion who knitted diffent stories \nand legends which are almost same to the base core. It is like 5 people \nlistening to a story and then asked to write it from the start in their own \nwords making it more beautiful. all 5 will be different with similar \nreferences and core idea but vying to be different. The different \npublishers of those books will try to sell as much of theirs. Different \nmarketers will want to create a loyal customer base. There will be \ncompetition to capture the whole matket. There will we some peaceful \nmarketing strategies , there will be other cunning ones too. There may even \nbe forced and cajoling marketing  to sell their books to the naive \ncustomers. In the end when the market is captured, all they need is to \nmaintain their customers and add new ones slowly with different ways. Oh! \nwait, I forgot. I was talking about the religions or the books? pretty much \nsame, eh?",

And before \naccusing others of ignorance , lemme tell you that Brahma , Vishnu nor \nShiva are the supreme Gods  , not even Brahman ( as in brahmand). The \ntrinity bows only to one supreme that is \" Shakti\" ie Energy. Hinduism is a \ncorrupted version of the original religion called \" Vedic Religion\". And \nVedic religion was based totally on the 4 vedas and the 4 vedas were in \nturn based on \" Science\". But i guess ppl have forgotten all this so that \nthey can just win arguments with others in proving as to who is better. And \none more thing , most of the religions have \" TRINITY\". In Hinduism its \" \nBrahma , Vishnu & Mahesh\" , in Christianity it is \" The Father , The son & \nThe Holy Spirit \" & in Islam it is \" Allah , Messenger ( Gabriel) & Prophet \n( Mohammed). So instead of encouraging ppl from other countries who are \ntaking an interest in your civilization , you are dissuading them. Bro they \nare doing what u should also do and that is \" RESEARCH\".\nP.S. - Do refrain from using abusive language. Does not creates a good \nimpression on ppl who are taking an interest in our country !!! Peace out \n!!    ",
