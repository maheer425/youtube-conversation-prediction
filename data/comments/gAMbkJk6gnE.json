That misspelled nonsense \nshouldn't be but otherwise it depends upon who they intended to respond to.\n\n+Azazel The Misanthrope Four words; \"Tears of the Pok\u00e9mon\".\n\nEmotion actually brought Ash back to life. Similarly I had never reacted \nemotionally to fiction before that scene so it kinda brought me to life \nbecause the first 10 years were more simply spent knowledge gaining and I \ntreated all books that way fiction or not not particularly analyzing them \nfor emotion.\n\nThat emotional awakening to fiction technically lead me to several years of \ndepression a decade later when I spent nearly 5 years on the brink of \nkilling myself and still think about it every day even now having decided \nto continue on, but I digress.\n\nIt's a very emotionally important scene by itself and as such Ash totally \nfits the theme of this video saying emotion is important to your life since \nhe wouldn't be if not for emotion.\n\nNot that I think him being alive is a good thing. Maybe they actually \nwould've done something with the series instead of ADMITTEDLY doing the \nsame thing over and over for money because they don't think the now mostly \nadult Pok\u00e9maniacs outside Japan have more money than Japanese children I \nguess.\n\nNot sure why they would think that but it's the only conclusion that makes \nsense since they purposely write the series aimed at the brand new children \nwatching every Gen instead of going for a broader audience which can easily \nstill be done while keeping it child friendly.\n\nArtix Entertainment hasn't been around since 2002 for nothing.",

Me being a diagnosed autist (aspergers), I am always \ncurios in how different parts of the brain respond differently to different \nsituations. For instance in this particular video, arousal is talked about \noften. I have always founnd it hard to be aroused in this sense. Often \nbeing called cold and emotionless. I very rarely have an emotional response \nto different stimuli. Even such things like roller coasters where you would \nexpect to see and feel arousal, I often feel negligible reactions. Its \ncommon for me to get off a ride and see myself straight faced on the \npicture they take and see everyone else screaming with their eyes closed \nand mouths wide open.\n\nI would be interested in seeing a crash course psychology video detailing \nthe different oddities or abnormalities that you see with non-nuerotypical \nminds and how the different parts of the brain act different. This would be \ncool detailing exactly what various types of autism are from a \nphysiological stand point as well as psycopathy, schizophrenia and even the \ncontroversial D.I.D. I want to say some of these things have been talked \nabout some. I may have just missed a video. But I think it would be cool to \nsee a video talking about how different parts of the brain act differently \nwith different people and how that affects their personality.  \ufeff",
