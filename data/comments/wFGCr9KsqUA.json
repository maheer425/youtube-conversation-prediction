Only wealthy people could afford meat like pigs and ox. Most ate \nfish, plants, and rice or noodles. So when people killed something, they \nhad to use all the parts for nutrien.",

Just watching it made \nme feel weird. lol It could probably taste alright, since I tend to like \negg, duck, chicken etc. but everything within me just screams \"IT'S NOT \nFOOD!\" so I'd have a hard time keeping it down I think. But meh, I won't \nknow until I get the chance some day. :p\n\nTypical ew-things like snake, heart, lung, frog, feet, snail, blood sausage \n etc. don't worry me. I can't promise that I'll like it, but I don't mind \ntrying it.\nI've eaten grilled insects at some sort of medieval event once and while \nit'll never be my favorite snack, it wasn't bad. It started out as a lost \nbet, but it was good enough for me to get more just to make my friends \nsick. You just need to get over how it looks, and it's alright.\nI also tried fermented shark once. That's an Icelandic thing. That was \nbad.. Really bad. But it's been like 25 years, so I'd be willing to try it \nagain. Who knows if I'd like it today.\n\nTaste is a weird thing though, cause I will eat a lot of things that other \npeople won't, but then there's my nemesis. The tomato. I've tried different \nkinds over a period of over 30 years now, and I don't like any of them. \nIt's not that I can't force myself to eat it or can't keep it down, but I \n*really* don't like it. The texture of it is just.. Nasty.\nBut ketchup etc. is fine oddly enough. It's just a raw tomato that I hate. \n:)\ufeff",

I'm asian and I'm not really a fan of durian \nbut, durian grown in coastal areas tastes better than inland ones cz the \nmeat has this smooth and silky texture and exotic taste and fragrant to it. \nInland grown durians are more dry and harder on its meat. Less fragrant and \nmuch smaller in size too. So I would recommend coastal area grown durians. \n:) And guess what, it's durian season now! And what's even more awesome is \nthat if you are lucky enough you might even be able to tastes one that has \nmilky fragrant, which usually can be found in coastal grown durians.

I work at a sushi bar and have been learning \nmandarin since I was 13. My youth pastor at my Chinese church gave me the \ntitle \"honorary asian\". I'm pretty Asian now....but since I had a white \nchildhood I have to learn to like all the bizarre foods on my own. The \nfirst time I had intestines, I threw up. Pork blood jello is a chore to \npick up with chopsticks.TOFU FTW!!! Frog tastes like chicken,cabbage and \nbaby bok choy is delicious. That tree fungus thing is really good too. I as \nscared to try kimchi, but it was good when I finally got to try it. When I \nam given a plate of food at my Chinese church for lunch every week,  I \ndon't know what half the stuff on the plate is, but it's still (almost) \nalways good. The mom's make stuff or it's a potluck. I've seen some WEIRD \nSTUFF, but it tastes good as long as you use cabbage and rice between \nbites. *warning* be on the lookout for intestines. Your Asian friends WILL \ntry and trick you into eating it if given the opportunity. It's not good \ntasting...I'm sorry but it's true haha\ufeff",

Quit being \"Asian\" and assuming \neveryone has to be like you.  Never mind people who are not FOBS and might \nnot have access to a lot of Asian food and language skills have you even \nstopped to think about part-Asian people?
