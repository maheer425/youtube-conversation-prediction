Interestingly, when pre-salted steaks have been analysed \nafter cooking, traces of iron from the pan have been found on them. \nSeemingly, the salt reacts with the pan, catalysing a chemical bonding \nprocess. \n\nOf course, that doesn't sound appetising, but it's perfectly safe, and is \nprobably contributing to that superior flavour many people enjoy and \n(erroneously) associate with a well-seasoned steak.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the flavour of a pre-seasoned steak, but that flavour \nis not due to salt penetrating the meat.",

The \ndifference is how fast it burns. EVOO burns very quickly, while groundnut \nand grapeseed (my preference) burn very slowly. Put simply, EVOO will smoke \nand turn to nothing within seconds, whereas groundnut will smoke for quite \nsome time. \n\nSo, when you're cooking a steak, the oil that's burning and smoking won't \ntransfer heat as well as grapeseed. This results in a very poor \ncaramelization. Look at 3:47, the bottom of the steak. There's literally no \ncolor. Then look at Ramsey's video. A nice crispy outside, tender inside. \nSo +Alexander Trefz, before you spout out more bullshit, actually go to the \nkitchen and try different oils. \n\nAnd remember, we're talking about the guy that thinks flipping a steak \nmultiple times somehow keeps the juices in. Pseudo-molecular gastronomy at \nits finest.  ",
