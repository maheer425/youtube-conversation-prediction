There are plenty of crazies to choose from as one \ncrazy individual stands out among the masses for that week. Simple as \npie... And i like pie... \nHOWEVER this week proved to be challenging to say the least. You see, we \nhave not just ONE nominee for this award... But THREE. With *Coo Coo for \nCoco Puffs* \"I will pray the gay away\" *Michelle Bachmann* in the running \nthis week. The choices become that much harder. HOWEVER! With much \ndeliberation through laughter and wetting myself in hysterics the choice \nwas made... You see... \nThere can be only One! (SFM) CRAZY... For the first time ever for Robbie's \ncrazy award of the week, the unthinkable has transpired... The award for \ncrazy is generously given to:\ufeff",

Alex Jones can scream as \npassionately as he wants all day about how he's right, but that doesn't \nmake him right. \n\nI've watched his \"show\" before, which again shows that you don't take \nseriously your point about assumptions. Having watched his \"show\" I can \nconclude that he isn't an intellectual powerhouse, but a raving lunatic. He \nutilizes fallacious and manipulative emotional language, even bordering on \nbeing meaningless word salad, to support logical fallacies. When that fails \nin the face of criticism, he attempts to use childish name calling and \nthreatens to use physical force. ",

I recommend that you actually look \ninto the different pieces of people, before you start ass-umptions.....\n\nThis man truely believes in his cause, he dont want to see the people \nenslaved, nor abused because of their position, when it gets so big, it \nmakes sense that he gets mad, no infact, I wouldnt trust him if he didnt \ntruely comit to it when it is big.\n\nBut I guess people would rather want \"ass-lickers\" or others who keep their \ntemper and shut up (moral) when it comes down to what really happend?\nPersonaly I get that some people would want that, because they are afraid \nthat he wouldnt get his point acros, or sound stupid.......\nBut this video is a great example of him atually standing up to the people, \ntry to analyze......instead of just taking everything they changed or \nfocused on bs for way to long......\n\n\"so he mentions that, you take me out of context, when you are doing this \non your show, how important is the context really\".......\n\n2:51 I personally lliked this part, because it really shows how mad anyone \ncan get from something that hits the people......\n\nFor some people it takes alot, like this guy, while others dont want to see \npeople acting up and simply......fcking up the system for their own behalf.\n\nI hope you atleast read some of it, and have a nice day. \nI also hope that videos like this, where they intensly focus on 1 point \nagain and again just to make you think otherwise, wont get you, and you \nactually is seeing what they are doing, and ofc what lies behind all of \nthis, instead of talking about a man that you might have no interest in \nknowing about, but still wants to have a saying about him.",
