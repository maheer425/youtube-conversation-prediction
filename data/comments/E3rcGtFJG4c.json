The ostensible purpose was to divorce public \ntelevision content from the money power. Over the course of twenty years, \nthese concepts and protections were inverted. PBS is now MSM - corporate \nideology manufacturing center. That is, the same power that deregulated the \nbanking system, also changed the law to enable for profit corporations to \nown programs on Public Television.\n\n\n*The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has \ncontrol at the same time over the means of mental production, so that \nthereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of \nmental production are subject to it.* (Marx & Engels: The German Ideology, \ncited in Curran et al. 1982: 22).\n\n\nFixing TYT : The correct formation is \"PBS . . .
