                "text": "I am kind of a YouTube critic and came across one of your videos...I really \nloved it and was pretty much laughing through the whole thing. I was just \nhad a question for you guys, do you use fake names for your actors or do \nyou use their real names, If you use their real names I think that's really \nawesome Because it gives the viewers a chance to get familiar with the \ncharacter and their personality. I think that your videos are hilarious... \nEveryone I ask knows what  Studio C is and thinks its hilarious, so I just \nhad to check it out for myself. Honestly Studio C is by far the most \nhilarious show and if I were to rate this show on a scale of one to ten i \nwould probably rate it a good 8.5 or 9. Thanks for doing some hilarious \nvideos and I hope to be laughing my gut out with your next video. :)\ufeff",

If you look back at season 1 episodes, they were \nfunny, but not many cast members participated, or really showed excellence. \nNow, nearly every episode uses every cast member at least once, and they \nhave each developed a role that they will often fill in the various \nsketches.
