                "text": "if anyone can answer me this it would really help: when doing the \ndeductions does it switch around the rotor position constantly? because the \nletters are(obviously) not all on the same place so when writing the \nmessage the rotor or rather the small rotor has gone one step further for \nevery typed letter. so technically the turing bombe had to simulate those \nsteps forward somehow right? (and reset them when wrong and kick the rotor \nstarting position that he just checked one position up) im sry if this \ndoesnt make sense my english is quite good normally but this stuff is just \ntoo techy. help would be appreciated the internet isnt quite doing its job \non this topic.\ufeff",

Simply adding an additional turnover position \nto each rotor is as cheap as it can get compared to other measures and \naccording to one of Turings co-workers they \"would have been in grave \ntrouble\", since it makes the cryptoanalysis way more difficult. For the \nuser of the Enigma nothing would change, no extra rotor to replace, no \nrewiring, no extra training, no additional time for en- and decoding.\n\nOf course the biggest mistake of the germans was, that they never even \ntested if the code was compromised. E.g. sending a message that several \nsubmarines are ordered to gather at a remote location far away from enemy \nconvois and look if enemy sub-destroyers would show up, which would be a \nbig indicator for a compromised code.",

After passing through the plugboard and \nthe rotors, it was possible that at the end of all the cross-wiring through \nfour different encodings, the letter 'A' could indeed come out as 'A'. But \nthen the wire hit the reflector which took a letter as input, routed it to \none of the other 25 letters, and then passed it back through the encryption \nwires backwards. But it doesn't matter what letter it comes out at the \nreflector, whatever letter it gets routed back through cannot go to A since \nthere is only one route from the reflector to A, which is being used by the \ninput line.  One reason for the reflector was the design requirement that \nthe same machine was used for encryption and decryption. The lightbulb for \neach output letter was connected to the same wire connected to that letter \non the keyboard. So if you typed 'G' and got 'P', then reset the rotors \nback one space and typed 'P', you would get 'G'. (And of course, from the \nsame initial rotor setting, typing in the cyphertext gobbledegook would \nproduced the plain German appearing on the lightbulbs). Without the \nreflector it would have been necessary to have separate decoding rotors, \nand to have had a way of connecting the plugboard to the lightbulbs \nseparately from the keyboard. But all this rather brilliant design opened \nthis one hole in the encryption security.",

The version of the Enigma system \nthey solved so brilliantly was much less complex, having fewer rotors and \nmuch less frequent rotor setting changes. Turing was responsible for \nattacking the German U boat code system unknown to the Poles. Then the \nGerman Navy changed their Enigma machine in early 1942, introducing an \nextra rotor (1+3) and a much more complex setting system that defeated \nprevious techniques for finding solutions. This new system was unbreakable \nuntil a Royal Navy team boarded a sinking submarine 'blown to the surface' \nat night off Haifa in late 1942. Two men, Lt. Anthony Fasson and AB Colin \nGrazier died when the submarine finally sank with them still on board. The \ncode books recovered enabled the U boat messages to be read once more but \nwith a longer decipherment time due to their much greater complexity. Dr \nTuring's other war work is still largely secret. The fiendishly \ndifficult Geheimschreiber system was broken at Bletchley Park during the \nwar using an electronic computer.",

So there is an assumed t->e mapping here. By the time the \np comes out of the rotor section of the pipeline, for the hypothesis to be \nplausible the p must map to the final e through the plugboard. Now this \nassumed p<->e pairing can be used as part of an expanding hypothesis and \nplugged in elsewhere to give further deductions. As soon as you hit a \ncontradiction, you know something must be wrong. Of course, it could be \nthat it was your original hypothesis that was wrong, i.e. that the \nplaintext was \"wetterbericht\". This is called a \"known plaintext attack\" in \ncryptography. That term is a little misleading, as the plaintext is more \nproperly hypothesized (i.e. guessed) rather than known in advance. In \nshort, you are assuming that the plaintext is likely to feature one of a \n(relatively) small set of words/phrases/strings. \n\nSo the procedure tends to be one of \nhypothesis->deduction->contradiction->changed hypothesis. It's not \ndissimilar to the way you have to solve certain hard crosswords or sudoku: \nlet's ASSUME that X is true, then see if a contradiction results. If we DO \nget a contradiction, X must be false. (X could be a conjunction, in which \ncase we need to change at least one element of X to form a new hypothesis.)\n\nIncidentally, a known plaintext attack was the method the Hardens used to \ncrack the Zodiac Killer's initial cipher (the 408): they ASSUMED he would \nstart with 'I' and would use the words \"kill\" and \"killing\" several times. \nWhen you make assumptions you make the state space much more tractable for \nsearch. Of course, your hypotheses may all be wrong, but if at least one of \nthem is right, you ought to find the solution much more quickly than \nperforming a pure brute force attack (i.e. exhaustive search of the \npossibility space).",

With the much smaller European \ncountries, you're bordering with 2-4 entirely different cultures a few \ncities away. They have older histories that likely come with their own \nlanguages. So on top of the mere size and proximity to different cultures, \nyou have the fact that English is the universal common language of the \nmajority of our media, technology, etc. So from a practical standpoint, \nthere is very little incentive to learn a different language, nor is there \nany real existing culture in place to be inherited from outside of our \nrelatively young, English speaking colony.\n\nIt's not an apples to oranges comparison.

Also, the USSR joined the \nwar against the Germans many months before the Americans did, so your \nchronology seems a bit cock-eyed, unless you are referring specifically to \nLend-Lease.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that the Red Army did most of the heavy lifting in \nthe European theater, it is hard to overestimate just how important the \nstrategic bombing was to final victory. The British and Americans smashed \nthe German industrial heartland and made it very hard for the Germans to \nwin an attritional war after she failed to take Moscow in 1941. It is very \ndifficult to say whether or not the Soviets could have defeated the \nWehrmacht without Anglo-American air power.",

Basically, Turing just need to theorize how Enigma works and \nwork out the mathematical formula of every single permutation inside \nEnigma. The plugboard has tons of permutation, but the same letter can't be \nplugged twice. The video gives an example if the rotor setting was wrong, \nand they way they know it is by using the plugboard. If the plugboard cable \noverlaps (like TG and TA which overlaps in T), the rotor setting is wrong. \nThat alone is pure mathematical, and since Turing was also a tech savvy, he \njust designed a machine that works on the same mathematical method he used \nto know the correct setting. The machine ignores the wrong setting and just \ngo on.\nWithout math, It would be an extremely long process to decode a single \nmessage that was encoded in Enigma.",
