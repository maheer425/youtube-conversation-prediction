He's called the \"Pink Princess\" because it's his favorite color. For \nsome reason TOP is his role model..??\n\n1:00 Kim Namjoon aka Rap Monster. Leader and Rapper. Also a bad dancer but \nis good at making songs. Before debut he was in an underground rapping \ncrew. I think the other members of the crew were supposed to debut with BTS \nbut they didn't for some reason.\n\n1:10 Is Min Yoongi aka Suga (pronounced like Shuga because he's sweet like \nsugar lol) Rapper and another song writer of BTS. Also in an underground \nrapping crew called D-Town (Daegu Town)\n\n1:30 Jeon Jungkook (bias wrecker, be warned) Vocalist, dancer, rapper, \nmaknae, you name it. Golden Maknae/Triple Threat and is as cute as frick. \nDebuted when he was either 15 or barely 16. G-Dragon fanboy who wishes \nsenpai to notice him.\n\n1:35 Kim Taehyung aka V, who is extremely funny and 4D. Very weird. Likes \nto stick out his tounge. Vocalist.\n\n1:39 Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope your hope. Named a toy horse after him \n(J-horse) Underground dancer before debut. Dancer and rapper with hidden \nvocal talent but doesn't sing much. Funny and silly and like the only one \nwho actually thinks of Jimin as an actual person. Also a song writer.\n\n2:59 Park Jimin!! Vocalist and dancer (he says he's been dancing all of his \nlife) He has really great abs and stuff. Gets pushed around and teased a \nlot by BTS (but not in a serious way though) and has a secret crush on \nJungkook (he is around him so much jfc) Also a Taeyang FANBOY (waiting for \nhim to scream 'taEYAnG OpPA'). Extremely short but he's actually the same \nheight as Mark (I don't know what's going on here??????????????????)\n\nAll of these people are weird idiots but you will love them <3 Fandom is \ncalled ARMY. 6/7 of these boys have either wrote a song or have contributed \nto writing the lyrics to some song. (Jin helped write the lyrics in Adult \nChild, V and Jimin rewrote the lyrics to a duet they did covering a song on \ntheir Soundcloud and it was called '95 Graduation.' Rap Mon, Suga, and \nJ-hope wrote countless songs for Bangtan in their previous albums, and I'm \nnot really sure about Jungkook, but I guess not everybody can do it so \neasily.)\n\nOkay, sorry for this long introduction but it will be worth it when you get \ninto the fandom ;)",

Or another example is that in Miss A, Suzy gets more screen \ntime/lines than Fei even though Fei is possibly leader (or Miss A doesn't \nhave a leader and Suzy is one of the vocalists). **I could go on and on \nwith examples sorry** My point is that you can get more screen time in a \ngroup for various reasons that are possibly unknown.
