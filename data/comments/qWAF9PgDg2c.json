You want to get back \nto Earth.\n1. Could you escape the pull of the moon and achieve breakaway speed with \njust the good old physical strength of the body?\n2. If not, then what speed would be required and could you do it with what \nyou have on the moon?\n3. How fast would you have to get off the moon to get to the earth in time \nthat you don't starve to death.\n4. How fast to not die of thirst.\nP.S. You have a parachute.

As a warning, I am doing this because I am bored, no \nother reason.\nNow, TO THE ANALYSIS!\n============================================\n\nIsaac originally stated this;\n\"In my opinion, there is a very real difference between right and wrong, \ndefined by God, to lead us to be happy.\"\nThe comment this came from will be referred to as C(A) henceforth in the \npost.\n\nC(A) was in reference to a post about the emotions of the human race being \na shortcoming, objectively. At that specific part of the conversation, the \npoint of view could be called 'personally objective'.(A hybrid of \nsubjectivity and objectivity arisen from an objective take on a highly \nsubjective point of view.)\nThrough this statement, Isaac tried to turn it into a argument of \nsubjectivity, which has been done multiple times before in conversations \nlike this, but each time was a sharp turn in tonality, and the type of \nproof supplied changed. When Isaac did this, I doubt it was for the \nmalicious reasons listed above, instead changing the corse for the sake of \nkeeping the argument going, but that would have been part of the outcome \nhad the conversation not been derailed.\n\nCYD saw the comment and assumed the stance of the objective, and seeing as \nthe original comment is stated as an objective fact. However, it changed \nfrom being personally objective to being purely objective. And yes, from a \npurely objective point of view, what CYD said was correct. However, from \nthe point of view of Isaac, i.e. the subjective, he was not wrong, as there \nis no wrong or right in subjectivity.\n\nAs the conversation goes on, it becomes confused, as both Isaac and CYD are \nhaving communication issues about each other's first responses. It seems \nthat Isaac assumed CYD to be talking about only C(A). CYD, however, seemed \nto be using his objective point of view to try and discredit the arguments \nput forth by Isaac previous to C(A), meaning his comments about eating \nhumans being morally wrong. CYD wanted to bring up the point that there is \nno objective basis for the God based morality Isaac was using. And again, \nin this, he was right. Objectively, morality founded on faith cannot be \nproven or supported by proof, and as such is irrational and illogical.\n\nIsaac responded in a subjective style because, again, subjectivity has no \nright or wrong. According to this point of view, his faith based morality \ncan be used in the argument because it is subjective. To emphasis, he is \nnot wrong.\n\nThis caused a chain effect, with CYD trying to disprove subjectivity, and \nIsaac trying to use subjective thoughts to beat objectivity, repeated ad \ninfinitum. A classic case of the hamster wheel: No matter how hard you try, \nyou'll go know where, and can potentially hurt your self if you stumble.\n============================================\n\nNone of this was written with any bias or malice intended, but if you are \noffended and wish to see something rewritten, please let me know, and I \nshall consider it.\n\nBest of luck to you, in all things.

The cleanest meat is that which is \ngrown in a lab.\n\n2) while poo does contain items our body wants to get rid off, it would not \ncreated a problem if it would go through the digestion tract second time. \nthe only exception are like you mention diseases where a diseased person \nhas the bacteria in his poop.\n\n3) If we were not meant to be omivores then evolution would have already \ntaken care of it. As it happens, we MUST eat meant to recieve all needed \nmaterials or we need to input them artificially (your supplements). human \ncannot survive on vegetables alone.\n\nthere are plenty of people that live without vegetables and, surprise, they \nare alive.\n\nAnd yes, meat have cholesterol, what of it?\n\n4) you are wrong. some types of meat IS healthy.\n\nAnd while i agree that toxins injected in some farms are harmful, stating \nlife decreasion is just conspiracy nut territory here. please stay sane.\n\n5) throughout whole history female physical maturation came between 11-13 \nyears. there are exceptions when it happens earlier and later. boys \nmaturation happens around 1 year later. This is nothing new. neither are \ntall boys.  the \"symptoms\" you claim has always been this way.\n\nNow where hormones in meat do show up is cases like a 9 year old that grew \ntits for example. but those are singular cases and not widespread.\n\n6) there are type of proteins that cannot be found in any vegetable or \nfruit. not recieving those for a long time damages your body. you may not \nnotice it at first, of course.\n\n7) yes, i implied that you are a crazy vegan because your arguments \nconsists half of falsehoods and half of hearsay and conspiracy theories.",

The animals coming from factories aren't even considered \ntrue meat.\n2) Poop IS unhealthy; it contains unwanted toxins from your body that if \nyou hold onto you can get different diseases, and it can become an issue \nwhen it comes to constipation, as your body can't release the toxins, also \nmaking your risks of colon cancer much higher. It's either healthy or \nunhealthy; and I'm pretty sure that \"good meat\" wouldn't be covered in \nturd. I mean, you could get the organic meats, but how many of you really \ndo that? Money is hard to find these days, as the rich are getting richer \nand the poor are getting poorer, so pretty much everyone is purchasing the \ncheaper stuff, aka factory meats.\n3) We are NOT meant to be omnivores. Like I said, we don't need animal \nproteins; we can eat nuts/beans/grains for protein, and we can get the \nomega fats from nuts and avocados. Some ill people have been put on a vegan \ndiet and why? Because the meats have become harmful to their body. You can \nlive without meat, but not without vegetables. All meats contain \ncholesterol whether you like it or not. \n4) Again, you are generalizing that all meat is healthy if prepared \ncorrectly; wrong. Meat isn't considered \"healthy\". Maybe \"good\" if it's \norganic meat but \"healthy\"- not so much. Remember, the meat \nslaughterhouses/factories inject chemicals and hormones inside, making it \nfar from healthy. Meat decreases your life span. If you have eaten meat \neveryday for 30 years you've already decreased your life span by 10 years \n(off topic but each can of soda you drink decreases 30 minutes of your life)\n5) Have you seen people these days? Girls use to get their periods at 14-16 \nbut nowadays they are getting it at 10-11. Boys at age 12-13 are already \npassing their parents height. This kid in my class doesn't even LOOK 14; he \nlooks 20. The hormones injected to the meat that makes the animals grow \nfaster is what's going inside to all of those who purchase the grocery meat.\n6) Vegans don't \"only\" eat vegetables; there's a variety of other things as \nwell. Soy, nuts, beans, etc. contain the protein we need, and avocados and \nnuts contain the omega fatty oils. And yes, supplements are those who don't \neat to the correct daily nutrient intake, but vegans are able to eat a lot \nmore for the exact same calories that omnivores eat, so they can eat the \nfoods mentioned above, as I said.\n7) If you're implying that I'M one of those \"crazy vegans\" you are \nmistaken; I'm only saying the information I know and have received. You eat \nmeat, I don't care, but you chose to argue with me about how meat is \nsupposedly \"good for you\". Society is telling people that it's the norm to \neat meat when it's the industries who are shoving the idea that MEAT IS A \nMUST, and it's exactly what they've been putting billions of dollars into \nworking on.\n\n\n",

Poop is not \nunhealthy actually.  Our bodies do not really care and just process it out.\n\nThere is a reason i said you should eat good meat and not just any meat btw.\n\n3) humans are omnivores. end of discussion. It is not possible to get all \nproteins necessary from plants. You will need to turn to supplements. ill \nexpand on that more in 6.\n\n4) More like depending on what kind of  meat you eat. if you eat in KFC \nsure your going tyo decrease your lifespan. if your going to eat well \nprepared healthy meat its actually helpful.\n\n5) People go through puberty SLOWER than they used to, so that whole theory \nof yours is out of the window. There are plenty of nasty chemicals in \nplants too btw, pesticides and whatnot.\n\nThen again, most of the chemicals arent actually nasty, just oversensitive \npeople like to panic from everything.\n\n6) If you eat properly you dont need supplements. if you need supplements \nyou arent eating properly. Eating only vegatables means you need \nsupplements, therefore you arent eating properly.\n\n7) I agree it does not look it should do anything with the way you eat, but \nthen there are all those crazy vegans telling everyone how they should \nlive....",

                    "text": "My opinion and knowledge based on meat:\n1) I wonder how people think that eating mutated animals are tasty. It's \nlike saying plastic is tasty.\n2) there is no \"healthy\" meat. Every meat has either contamination (oh, and \nEVERY meat product is contaminated by scat (poop) by the way; have you \nwatched the documentary I told you about? It'll tell you how so), \nchemical/hormone injections, and/or other body parts blended in with it, \naka an eyeball or whatnot. And if you're going to argue about farm meat, \nall I can say is that although it's better than factory meat, there are \nstill unhealthy fats. Besides, consumption of red meats increases the risk \nof cancer, heart problems, and obesity. \n3) again, humans aren't made to eat meat, it's just a choice. We can get \nprotein from nuts, beans, and supplements. Easy peasy. \n4) I disagree; studies have shown that eating meat decreases your life \nspan, on average of 5 years, depending on how much meat you eat.\n5) not really; your body has to learn how to digest the nasty chemicals in \nthe meat first. Do you wonder how children going through puberty develop \nfaster than the olden days? It's because of the hormones injected into \nmeat. The hormones are injected because factories want meat to be produced \nfaster because of the high demand. An average chick takes one year to \nbecome a chicken, while if injected it takes only two months to become a \nchicken.\n6) again, supplements. \n7) this doesn't really have anything to do with food.",

                    "text": "+Strazdas I have to disagree with a few things you indicated:\n1) vegetarians save about 100 animals a year; imagine what a vegan can do. \nOh, and I've heard the whole spider thing, but there is an article the \nbacks up the theory that it would be rare that we would even eat one \nspider, check it out: \nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CAwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmentalfloss.com%2Farticle%2F50951%2Fhow-many-spiders-do-you-really-swallow-your-sleep&ei=rpinVLP_IpCVyATZq4CgAw&usg=AFQjCNFt9WTWOhlxvh9M9aqSLy91g0pw6g&sig2=zvKPrYoouTCDSaMWhnKSzQ\n2) the \"bad\" fats that meat has (meat has good and bad fats) collect around \nyour heart, making your heart have to work twice as much to keep blood \nflowing around your body, and meat has also been linked to some cancers.\n3) 2000 calories worth of vegetables is more beneficial than 2000 calories \nworth of meat. Besides, fruits and vegetables make you feel full for \nlonger, meaning you don't have to consume as much.\n4) calories=energy. Either way, anything you eat can give you energy. But \nvegans have reported to have energy that lasts throughout the day and \nwaking up from sleep isn't a bother.\n7) studies have shown that we as humans weren't made to eat meat. Search it \nif you have time.\n9) you wouldn't \"starve\" for eating vegetables and fruits; there's also \nnuts and whatnot. Grains too. Consuming enough calories won't make you \nstarve and your body first gets rid of the fats, and then the muscle.\n10) well then research on enzymes.\n\nI'll be typing another paragraph based on what you think. Please wait until \nI post it until you argue back. I'm also quite surprised how you aren't \nacting like a baboon like some other people do when this topic comes up, \nand I appreciate it.",

Not related.\n\n6)Not sure how your religiuos beliefs are related to anything but your \nreligiuos beliefs.\n\n7)Protein sure. there are plenty of materials you CANT get from vegetables \nand fruit. there IS a reason we evolved to eat meat as well.\n\n8)Your apperence is genetically pretedetermined for most part and your \neffort for the other part. while yes, eating healthy does affect that, \neating healhy is not the same thing as being a vegan.\n\n9)well yes, as i said before, since vegetables dont have energy your body \nis going to starve (weigh loss is your body starving and eating itself, \nliterally).\n\n10) havent researched enzymes enough to say either way.\n\nNow meanwhile eating meat means:\n\n1) Tasty\n\n2) healthy (if you eat healthy meat)\n\n3) balanced diet.\n\n4) longer lifespan.\n\n5) easier digestion of many materials.\n\n6) access to minerals and acids not available in plants.\n\n7) no urge to go around internet spouting nonsense",

                "text": "Vsauce is one of the few YouTube channel's I actually get new video updates \nemail notifications for. The questions he asks are always right up my \ncuriosity ladder.\n\nI always thought humans would taste somewhat like Pork, because while we \nare red meat, we're not exactly \"cow\" quality, a firmer texture, more dense \nlike pork.\n\nAccording to the video William Buehler Seabrook acquired some fine quick \ncuts of human meat from a person who was recently killed in an accident. \nThe description in the video is more detailed, but lets just say... Human's \ntaste like Veil.. At least back in 1880s..\n\nHuman diets have changed substantially since then, so it's highly likely \nthe human meat in 1880s would be considerably less fatty than today's \nstandards.\n\nWe're also considerably less mobile, have had our entire lives breathing in \npollutants, and consuming medicines and chemicals. However, does all that \nreally make us taste different?\n\nYes it does.. Cows are a great example, Kobe Beef for example consume foods \nwhich produce a high amount of fat woven into their tissue. I would imagine \nsome areas of human muscle would be similar, based purely on our diets and \nmobility limitations.\n\nSo we may not taste so much like veil anymore, but might be closer to a \nmore refined and taste based on our fat. So the question becomes, what does \nHuman fat taste like..\n\nThere is no reference about Marco Evaristti Human Fat Meatballs which he \nsold and ate, on what they taste like other than - \"Even better than my \ngrandmother's...\".. Which doesn't really answer the question.\n\nCertain fat taste a certain way, even different fats from the same animal \ntaste vastly different. So I would bet money we'd taste different than what \nthat person in the 1880's tasted like.\n\nIf I had to lose a limb for whatever reason, I would demand my limb be \npackaged, find a way to cut some meat out of it, and to the BBQ.. I would \nmost likely find it hard to butcher my own limb, but I am sure I would find \nsomeone who would do it for me, possibly for a price of a taste. I know \nthere is someone out there that would do it.\n\nThat might seem unusually gross to any reader, but I find myself asking \nquestions like how much interrogation could I handle. How long could I be \nin a high-stress environment etc. This is no different, as the top of the \nfood chain, this is one question in a long line of questions I would answer \nif given the opportunity.\n\n#HumanMeat  \ufeff",

Incest, Cannibalism, Beastiality, even Pedophilia are all \nthings which are more complicated to legislate around than they first \nappear.\n\nIncest - Why do liberal countries prohibit two consensual adults from \ngetting married if they're related? (The genetics argument is tenuous at \nbest)\n\nBeastiality - Why is killing animals to eat their flesh okay yet having sex \nwith them isn't?\n\nPedophilia - What about two 13 year olds having sex? What a 16 year old and \na 15 year old? What if a 15 year old boy rapes a woman? What about a 15 \nyear old who looks 19?\n\nPeople tend to ignore 'taboo topics' because they are gross, but I find the \nlaw around them interesting. ",

If you did, congratulations; you just defied science and logic. \n\nAnyways, you *blew my mind.* No way to actually eat your body, but if you \ncould, my guess is you would disappear, eating your own body weight. But \nthen again, it would come back to you. You wouldn't double your weight, \njust infinite eating it over and over and over again. You would most likely \ndisappear, if you ask me.

If there's a \ntendency for one side to be longer than the other, it might be caused by a \nparallel of hand dominance. The V formation increases flying efficiency by \ntaking advantage of the turbulence. It's exactly like the idea of drafting \na container truck (which is a bad idea because the truck is significantly \nmore likely to crash than the goose). This effect on the atmosphere would \nvary, and it seems reasonable that the outer edge of the formation would be \nsomewhat tougher to fly in than the inner edge. People instinctively use \ntheir dominant hand to do most things, so it would stand to reason that the \ngeese would position themselves so their dominant wing is on the outer \nside. Genetically, right handedness is dominant over left handedness, so \nthere would probably be a similarly significant imbalance in the geese. \nThat said, I don't know if there is any significant preference in geese as \nto which side of the formation is longer. My home seems to be off the \nbeaten track when it comes to their migrations. I just get to watch \nTrumpeter Swans.",

Well in that case light would be rare, so then the color? Well \nmaybe, but pale gold in it of it self is kind of boring. I wonder if maybe \njust maybe the color AND the shine somehow reflects back into the eye and \nsome how creates dopamine in the brain. Which would explain why fools gold \nhas a similar effect, and why (in my experience) silver doesn't.\nThen again maybe silver doesn't because it reminds me of iron, but gold \nreminds me only of gold!\nWhich is why I ask Vsauce!",
