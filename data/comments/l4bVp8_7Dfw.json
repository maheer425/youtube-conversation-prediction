It's origins stem during the Colonial \nperiod of America when the English pilgrims were still on friendly terms \nwith the Native Americans.  (Of course, that period of time didn't last \nvery long and the Europeans eventually committed mass genocide. But \nnonetheless...).\n\nThe Native Americans taught the English how to survive the first winter, \nand the following year the pilgrims and Native Americans had a feast \ntogether. That was the first Thanksgiving.",
