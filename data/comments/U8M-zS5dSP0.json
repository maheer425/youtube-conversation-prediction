This means most \nAmericans will rarely if ever run into a situation where there is a \npractical purpose in learning a new language.   Even many Americans who \ntake the time to learn different languages (I studied french for six years) \noften lose their ability to speak it from lack of practice.\n\nI also am making the point that you can hardly claim to be better for \nspeaking too languages when you speak them poorly.  Many if not most \nAmericans have spent at least a year learning a foreign language, but they \ndon't claim they can speak it because they recognize they only understand \nit at a remedial level.\n\nFinally, understand that despite not knowing other languages many Americans \nare still incredibly well educated on different cultures and ethnicity and \nin general have a greater understanding of global cultures then most other \ncountries that have substantially less diversity within their own society. \n I may not speak any other language, but I know a wide variety about the \nculture and history of south america, Germany, France, Spain, mexico, etc. \n I've had conversations with people from across the globe from easy over a \nhundred different countries and I didn't even need to leave my home state \nor learn another language to do so.\n\nBefore you make claims about self absorption, I hope you realize that many \namerican's probably have a far more broad global perspective then almost \nanywhere else on the planet.

I'm sorry but there is a limit to being gullible.\ufeff",

We are in a war over rights, \nand wars involve trying to destroy your enemy. I am 100% fiercely \nPro-Choice, but from the point of Anti-Choicers, abortion is first-degree \nmurder of an innocent person, and therefore any means that are considered \njustified to prevent murder are justified to prevent abortion. We \n(Pro-Choicers) are their enemy, and so they want us destroyed by whatever \nmeans necessary. What is so shocking about that? You mean to tell me that \nin a war the enemy side will attempt to destroy you? That they will deceive \nyou, commit arson against you, bomb you, terrorize you, and attempt to kill \nyou? Really?! I'm shocked! Shocked!\n\nSeriously, get a grip. We're in a civil war. We MUST be brutal towards one \nanother. I oppose Anti-Choicers with the same ferocity. I want them crushed \nbeyond the point of possible recovery. I will use any means necessary to \nachieve this. I support killing Anti-Choice males, raping Anti-Choice \nfemales, demonizing the entire right-wing, genociding through various means \n(e.g. mass-immigration of non-White people to every conservative White \ncountry, to reduce the White population to minority status) White \nright-wing people worldwide etc. There is nothing shocking about this; I am \na Pro-Choicer, therefore Anti-Choicers are my enemy. Consequently I want \nthem destroyed.\n\nI oppose all Anti-Choicers, but out of all of them, the ones I prefer to \ndeal with are actually the extremists, such as the Army of God. Reason why? \nThey are honest and direct. They are not wolves in sheep's clothing; they \nare open, outright predators standing in plain sight. I much prefer enemies \nthat oppose me openly, rather than those who smile to my face whilst \nclutching a knife behind their backs (e.g. most 'non-extreme' \nAnti-Choicers). Unlike the many Anti-Choice wolves in sheep's clothing, the \nArmy of God (and other Anti-Choice 'extremists') will tell me, directly, to \nmy face, in front of the whole world, in no uncertain terms: that they \noppose everything I stand for, wish to destroy me by whatever means \nnecessary, will kill me if they get the opportunity, and will applaud if \nthey do succeed in killing me. That is their message. No lies. No \npretenses. Just the plain truth: they are my enemy, and seek to destroy me. \nI in turn, am not two-faced towards Anti-Choicers. I will tell them, in no \nuncertain terms: that I oppose everything they stand for, wish to destroy \nthem by whatever means necessary, will do so if I get the opportunity, and \nwill applaud if I succeed. No lies. I don't have a knife behind my back; I \nam running directly towards you at top speed with it in plain sight. If you \nare Anti-Choice, I want you destroyed. If you're a male, I want you \nslaughtered. If you're a female (especially a White one), I want you \ngang-raped (preferably by males of another race, since I know that White \nconservatives not-so-secretly consider non-Whites sub-human) and \nimpregnated, and left with the choice of aborting or birthing a non-White \nbaby (which you'll either resent and/or will lower the White population \neven further). I want Crisis Pregnancy Centers firebombed. I want churches \nburned to the ground. I want prominent Anti-Choicers assassinated. In other \nwords, I want my side to win this war. What is so surprising about that?\n\nTo my fellow Pro-Choicers, here's an idea: quit whining about the enemy \ndoing what enemies do, and start focusing on fighting back. When Japan \nattacked Pearl Harbor, did the US sit around and complain, or did they \nrespond by crushing the enemy to the point that they would not do such a \nthing again? I think we all know the answer. And it worked. So stop \ncomplaining about our enemy, and start focusing on crushing them until they \nbreak. Every time an Anti-Choicer assassinates one of us, assassinate one \nof them. Every time they firebomb one of our clinics, firebomb one of \ntheirs. Every time they terrorize us, terrorize them. Beat the living \ndaylights out of Anti-Choice males if you get the opportunity. Rape \n(and/or encourage your male descendants/allies) Anti-Choice females if you \nget the opportunity. Brutal and barbaric? Absolutely, but so are they. Do \nyou want to win this war or not? If you do, you must be willing to crush \nthe enemy more than they can crush you. The only rule I'd suggest following \nis avoid civilian casualties as much as possible. Other than that? Unleash \nabsolute hell on the enemy.\ufeff",

In this \nwar, we KNOW where the enemy is: in churches, in Crisis Pregnancy Centers, \nin right-wing households etc. What I'm suggesting is along the lines of \nwaging 'total war' against the Taliban, while successfully avoiding causing \nhuge numbers of civilian casualties. Is that so terrible?\n\nIn other words, if we could somehow evacuate all civilians from Iraq today, \nwould it then be ethical to obliterate the country, since the only people \nleft inside would be enemy combatants (e.g. Islamic State fighters)?

                    "text": "+Maiden Of Wolves The whole family probably deserves a bomb dropped on them.\n\nI actually think we're starting to lose our rights because the enemy is \nwilling to go to extremes that we are not. There are constantly new \nrestrictions being placed on abortion, from shutting down of clinics to \nattempts to reduce the legal week limit to lack of laws/enforcement of laws \nagainst Anti-Abortion harassment of Pro-Choicers. If we fought back, we'd \nmake more progress. There are evidently some Anti-Abortionists who are \nwilling to risk imprisonment over this, so I'm certain that there are some \nPro-Choicers who are too. Elderly people or people with terminal illnesses \nwho don't have much longer to live, and therefore have less to lose, \nperhaps? Or people who know that they are going to jail for a long time \nanyway for something else: before the police come to arrest them, they \ncould go and shoot some Anti-Abortionists.\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily need to be a lot of people: there aren't that many \nAnti-Abortionists who do such things either, but look at the huge effect \nthat such a small portion of them can have. We could do the same. Just \ntwenty Anti-Abortion males killed, or twenty females raped, or twenty \nchurches or Crisis Pregnancy Centers bombed would have a huge effect and \nsend a message to Anti-Abortionists: if you trouble us, there will be \nsevere repercussions. I'm sure that, in an enormous movement like ours, \nthere are twenty people willing and able to send such a message. Even just \none person could send a message by gunning down 10+ people outside an \nabortion clinic. If Anti-Abortionists start fearing that there is a risk of \nthem facing severe danger by opposing abortion, they will start thinking \ntwice about what they do.\n\nWe have one significant advantage over Anti-Abortionists: we don't need \nracial unity to succeed. The overwhelming majority of Anti-Abortionists are \nright-wing White people, and virtually every COMPETENT Anti-Abortionist is \na White person. I have NEVER seen a non-White Anti-Abortionist set up a \nsuccessful Anti-Abortion organization, pass a law to restrict abortion, \nkill an abortion provider, bomb an abortion clinic, terrorize Pro-Choicers, \nset up Crisis Pregnancy Centers right next door to abortion clinics, spread \nenormous amounts of misinformation/outright lies regarding abortion etc. It \njust doesn't seem to happen.\n\nIn addition, most Anti-Abortionists are only really obsessed with \npreventing White fetuses from being aborted. When a visibly non-White \nfemale walks into an abortion clinic, Anti-Abortionists don't tend to \nharass her even a TENTH as much as they harass a White looking female who \nwalks into an abortion clinic. So the pattern? Anti-Abortionists are mostly \nWhite people who want to prevent the abortion of White people. So what \nhappens if Pro-Choicers start using tactics that racist White people can't \nhandle? Example: years ago, White people were more than 90% of America's \npopulation. Now, they are on the verge of becoming an ethnic minority, as \nthe result of mass non-White immigration & being outbred by said \nimmigrants. This has had an enormous effect on abortion laws: as the \nnumbers of right-wing White people have declined, so have the restrictions \non abortion. So it is quite clear: right-wing White people are the main \nproblem that we face. Get rid of them, and we get rid of almost all \nAnti-Abortionists.\n\nThus I suggest various tactics to deal with Anti-Abortionists that have a \nlarge impact on right-wing White people in particular: support mass \nimmigration (most of which will be non-White) to all conservative White \ncountries (to reduce the right-wing White population), impregnate White \nAnti-Abortionists with non-White offspring (somehow I suspect Sarah Palin \nwould have dragged Bristol to an abortion clinic herself if her offspring \nhad been non-White), spread information about the racially biased \ntendencies of the Anti-Abortion movement etc. The same tactics they use on \nus basically: violence, demonization and underhanded sabotage. You have to \nhit the enemy harder than they hit you, if you want to win. We need to send \nAnti-Abortionists a message along the lines of: if you shoot our doctors, \nwe're going to mount your head on a spike and run a train on all of your \nwife's orifices. ",

It's YOU with the 'GREY DEMON' avatar sold to \nnaive folk like you as grey \"Aliens\", fooled by the NAZI's because you are \nnot old enough to know better, and you are calling me delusional? You are a \nriot!\n\nI don't subscribe to the \"Christian Religion\", but if you were well studied \nenough in who ROME actually is, (helps if you are italian as well), you \nwould know that's what Rome invented, ROME invented \"Christianity\", it's \nwhy you do NOT find the word \"CHRISTIANITY\" in the earliest 99.5% accurate \nmanuscripts from Jerusalem/Antioch.\n\n\"You've obviously never read the story of Jesus if you don't know that his \ndeath was the sacrifice needed to forgive the sins that the father \ncondemned humans\"\n\nThanks for confirming you misunderstood the story quite a fair bit.\n\nJesus is God in the flesh number one.  Number 2, since Adam and Eve, we are \nunder the curse of sin which means also \"DEATH\", the fact we can DIE! \nBefore in the garden we couldn't \"DIE\", but AFTER the fall from grace and \ndisobeying God, we came under a curse.  There's only one way to get out of \nthe curse, it's through Jesus the CHRIST who is GOD (Christ / Messieh) in \nthe flesh! You can't save yourself, no one can, i can't, you can't no one \ncan.  Only JESUS can, and if you think you can save yourself...then it's \nYOU who is in the highest level of \"VANITY\", to think that you are \"GOD\" \nand can save yourself! It's the ULTIMATE EXPRESSION of claiming to be GOD!\n\nStop pretending you are older and wiser, when you are actually young and \nmore foolish.  You need to repent, and realize you are a sinner like \neveryone else, and you will not save yourself.\n\nAfter death... is where you realize you were wrong, not a wise choice at \nall when eternity is a mighty long time, and that's not being stated as \nsome 'threat', rather, that's the final reality that will occur, because \nit's US, YOU AND ME and OTHERS in this world that send ourselves to HELL, \nnot God.  \n\nGod gave us 2 choices, it's really simple, either you follow Him or you \ndon't... it's us who chooses hell, by ignoring the best Father we could \never have for eternity and instead choosing 'emotion driven' reality over \n'spirit driven' reality.",

Also, if they \nhave had an abortion, they would want to make sure they get checked \nregularly to prevent undetected cancer. That just makes sense. I do \nnot understand what you mean by \"You never know when you will lose that, \nand become a shell of yourself\".",

We aren't able to advise you on those things. You \nwouldn't want your pastor to tell you the risk of your medical treatments \nwould you?  We took that that thought on it.

I \ndid not bring up whether women should or should not have an abortion. It \nmust be troubling to you if this study is true. You are right. It is \nlegally their choice and you who claims to be so into women would want them \nto be fully informed before they make that choice or would you feel better \nthat they not know? You or I would not be stopping them. They would be \nmaking an informed decision themselves. And if they choose not to have an \nabortion, its their decision, right? Again the question is are these \ncenters deliberately lying or not? This well documented study done in 2013 \nsays they are not. Don't tell me you completely ignore science, which is \nwhat studies are built on and it just takes effort and research to find out \nwhat is true and what is not, center employee.

Your statements did \nnot undermine or address the logic laid out in my previous arguments.\n\nFirst, your statements didn't address the lack of freedom in a 'gun to \nhead' scenario. I explained how God puts people in an analogous, but worse \nscenario and coerces worship through the threat of hell, you didn't address \nthat at all.\n\nSecond, you state \"Though God may know the way your life plays out, he \ndoesn't plan it.\". This is clearly wrong, since God designs you knowing \nwhat you will do. God designs you knowing what your life will be, meaning \nhe chose to make you exactly how you are, knowing that doing so would cause \nyou to live the exact life you have lived. If God chose to create you in a \nway that would lead to you do everything you do, and it knows everything \nyou will do, then it chose  for you to live that life. God chose for you to \ndo everything you do by designing you how you are. Simply stating \"You're \nwrong because the bible says we have free will\" does not allow you to \nescape that logic. \n\nYour statements also assume the existence of libertarian free will, (the \nidea that we can somehow perform actions in a way that was not ultimately \ndetermined by something outside of our control) which as I stated, is now \nwidely accepted to be logically incoherent among the experts in the area in \nacademia. Although there are many ways of showing this at many levels, \nperhaps the simplest way is the following:\n1. All of your actions are necessarily based on your mental characteristics \n(e.g. what you find rational, convincing, what you desire, or value and so \non)\n2. You cannot choose the mental characteristics you start with, because \nchoosing mental characteristics would require you to already have mental \ncharacteristics to make that choice based on.\nTherefore, you must in some sense start with unchosen mental \ncharacteristics.If you are given mental characteristics and your choices \nare based on those unchosen characteristics from that point on, then all of \nyour choices are determined by something you didn't choose.

It seems you have chose \nnot to do so and I have done so. You would also know that there is a \ndifference between \"Free Will\" and \"God's Plan\" and what those to terms \nmean. Though God may know the way your life plays out, he doesn't plan it. \nWhat happens in your life is merely caused by either yourself, others or is \na natural occurrence of this world. The way I see the creation of this \nworld is that it was programmed to function in a certain way,  and man was \nput here to care for it. What they desire to do is their own free will. \nFree will is the choices and actions you make in your life(what you believe \nin, what path you take,what you like and dislike, etc.) and God can't \ninterfere with that for it was his gift to you. He doesn't want people to \nworship him because he says they should. He wants people to choose their \nown life and way. God's Plan is just another way of saying what God has \nplaned for EVERYTHING in the long term. But it may also include the small \nthings in everyone's life like you choosing(keep in mind that God doesn't \nmake this decision for you, *you* do) to be Atheist for a greater reason, \nfor example. Remember you are not coerced to do what God *suggests*. If \nthis were the case. Everyone would be a mindless worship drone. Go ahead, \ncall me a liar, an idiot, a fool.\n \nUse all the worlds expletives to your hearts content. Your persecution only \nencourages and strengthens me.\n\nIt's interesting that a person of the least understanding of Christianity \nwould critique it and try to educate me on a subject that I live with. Not \nto mention a subject that I myself have questioned and criticized \nbefore. Having an altercation about a subject you know little about against \nan individual that does is ill-advised, my friend. It is interesting to how \natheists will go out of their way to prove that their religion is the only \nperfect and right way, while shooting down others.

                    "text": "+athruz Yes, my conclusion very much does follow.  It is very simple.  If \ngod is all knowing and all powerful, then he knows about every single child \nrape that occurs AND can stop it, but chooses not to.  There is no way \naround it.  You are stuck with that reality if your presumptions about \nomniscience and omnipotence are stipulated for the sake of argument.  Of \ncourse you say you reject it, but that is meaningless.  You simply don't \nwant to acknowledge the reality of it.  You don't want to admit to yourself \nthat god chooses to allow child rapes to be going on around the globe.  \nPeople standing in judgment before god has nothing to do with the fact that \nhe knowingly allows child rape, CAN prevent it, but chooses NOT to.  People \npaying for their acts has nothing to do with god's knowledge of child rape, \nhaving the power to keep it from happening, yet allowing it.\n\nYou are trying to excuse god's indifference and inaction.  There is no need \nto completely remove free will in order to prevent child rape.  He could \nsimply only remove the horrific things from free will, and allow everything \nelse.  That is, if he is actually all powerful.  And you insist that he \nis.  That means he can do ANYTHING.  He could make it so that no human \nbeing has the ability to rape anyone, let alone children.  He could have \ndone that from the onset, but didn't, despite knowing everything that would \never happen, before ANYTHING had ever happened.  It really has nothing to \ndo with how I feel about how he does things, but yes, I believe that raping \nchildren should never have been something that could possibly ever occur.  \nThere is no rationalizing it away.  I realize that you are trapped and \ncan't get yourself to admit that your god is culpable for allowing \nuncountable child rapes, because you have it set into your brain that \nnothing about god could ever be even slightly imperfect, even when it is \nplainly demonstrated that what you believe can't be defended.  You are \ngiving god a free pass because of your predetermined conclusions and \nbeliefs.  Btw, quoting the bible doesn't do anything to demonstrate that \nthe bible is true.  Of course, none of us were anywhere when the Earth's \nfoundation was laid, 4.55 billion years ago, but again, none of that has \nanything to do with justifying the allowing of child rape.  Who said that \nany dimensions were \"marked off\"?  Where does that notion even come from?  \nThe Earth's foundation was determined by physics.  Duh.  There was no one \nto lay any foundation.  Why would you think that there had to be a \nsomeone?  This is getting way off track, and I bet that is your aim, but I \nwill continue to address the religious nonsense you are spewing.\n\nThe fact the existence of any god can't be proven or disproven, and I will \noperate under your premise there, for the sake of practicality, in NO WAY \ngrants creedence to any of the stuff you believe in that realm.  It is not \nequally likely that something is true or not based on the mere reality that \nit either is or isn't.  That doesn't make it 50/50.  I either can or can't \npick up an SUV and spin it on my finger like a basketball.  The fact that \nit is either one or the other doesn't mean each reality is equally \nlikely.  No, plausibility is NOT all you have to establish in order for \nyour cuckoo belief system to be rational, and something literally being \npossible doesn't mean it is plausible.  You are misusing the term \nplausible, and it misrepresents the nature of your beliefs.  It is \ninteresting that you went out of your way to make a semantic argument about \nthe difference between proof and evidence, since I never mentioned proof, \nand yet all you went out to speak about were \"evidences\".  Proof can exist \noutside of the realm of mathematics, but more importantly, the \"evidences\" \nyou named do not exist re: any god.  There is no evidence THAT your \n'creation' myth ever occurred, so you used a very basic circular argument \non that one.  The fact that the universe exists is not evidence that any \ngod exists.  We know the big bang was the origin of the universe as we know \nit, and not knowing what, if anything happened or existed before that is \nnot evidence for any god.  It would be an argument from ignorance fallacy \nto insert god as an answer for something to which we don't know the actual \nanswer. And religious people do that all the time.  VERY common.  Almost \nuniversal.  There is no logical argument that is sound that ends with the \nconclusion that there is a god.  Anyone that thinks so doesn't understand \nLogic and/or is being dishonest and is trying to make it seem like there is \nan actually sane basis to believe in their fairy tales.  There is no \nhistorical or archaelogical evidence of god, of course.  That is laughable, \nbut not as laughable as \"legal.\"  I would LOVE to know where that even came \nfrom.  LOL.  Again, your \"plausibililty\" line is absurd and amounts to \nnothing more than you starting from the presupposition that what you \nbelieve is true, and therefore everything you are saying automatically \nmakes sense.  It doesn't.  You are putting the cart before the horse in the \nworst way.\n\nYou just contradicted the shit out of yourself.  You can't say that you go \nby faith, and then try to provide actual reasons for believing what you \nbelieve.  That is oxymoronic, when combined.  Faith is believing in the \nabsence of evidence, but you are contending both are your reasons.  That \ndoesn't fly.  And I have no reason to believe that god even exists, let \nalone that you know specific things about why he hasn't proven himself to \nexist.  And how silly that claim is.  It sounds like a child on a \nplayground insisting to the other kids that he can fly, but just doesn't \nfeel like it right now.  No one said faith is unnatural.  Again, where you \ngot that is beyond me.  But no, we don't all live with faith, at least not \nin the sense that people have religious faith.  I have faith that the Earth \nwill keep rotating for a very long time, causing what we call a sunrise to \noccur each day.  But isn't for the fuck of it.  I believe it because there \nis a basis to expect that it will keep happening based on observation and \nother scientific realities.  And why people \"freak out about faith\" is \nbecause you are believing absolutely childish, cartoonish nonsense, and not \nonly is bad that you people base your life decisions on it as if affects \nYOU, but such things don't exist in a vacuum.  It can affect everyone else, \nespecially children.  Believing things for horrible reasons is a very real \nproblem, especially when those reasons include blind faith.\n\nYou don't know what credulity means, so you shouldn't be using the term.  \nCredulity may or may not be an incarnation of blind faith.  And you also \nstill don't know what faith means, as you described it exactly backwards.  \nFaith has no evidence involved.  Having credulity may or may not.  Faith is \nhaving credulity in the willingness to believe something without evidence.  \nSomeone may have lots of evidence for something, leading to them being \ncredulous about it.  But that isn't blind faith.  Blind faith is a form of \ncredulity, but that doesn't mean that credulity is blind faith, and it \ncertainly doesn't mean that someone that is credulous about something \ndoesn't have a rational basis for it.  And AGAIN, you do NOT have evidence \nfor god, although you think you do, which means you do NOT have blind \nfaith, by your claims.  If you had blind faith, you would just say, \"I \nbelieve it because I want to believe it,\" or something of that nature.  The \nthing is, that is actually the case.  You are trying to have it both ways \nby professing faith (because religious people think that is admirable) AND \nby claiming to have real world bases for believing the bunk you hold dear.  \nThe existence of jesus is based wholly on the bible.  There is no \ncontemporary evidence for jesus, and even the bible was written well after \nhis death.  There is much reason to doubt jesus even existed, but even \nassuming he did, there is no evidence that he was the son of any god, or \nthat any god has ever existed.  Again, you are operating from the \npresupposition that everything you wish to be true IS true, which makes all \nof the details of the crap you wish to believe automatically true to you as \nwell.  The \"prophecies\" stuff is so silly and has been debunked SO many \ntimes, it is hard to believe that anyone still puts a shred of merit in \nit.  But of course, when you are starting from the position of assuming it \nis all true....",

I, however, do not reach your \nconclusion and do reject it on the basis that your conclusion does not \nnecessarily follow.\nThe Bible is very emphatic in saying that all men will stand in judgement \nbefore Him for what they have said and chosen to do during their lifetime. \nNo form of evil done by man will escape the consciousness of God during \nthis judgement. \n\n+ God can surely stop all evil, but how would you like for Him to do this? \nDo you want Him to rid us of free will? How about get rid of all evil doers \n(which means all of us)? Or should God compensate for peoples' evil actions \n100% of the time through supernatural intervention, you know, kinda plug up \nthe holes where we fall short? It sounds to me like you're ready to \ninstruct God on how to be moral and the best way He should do things. Be \nprepared to answer these questions found in Job 38: vs 4-7:\n\n4 \u201cWhere were you when I laid the earth\u2019s foundation? Tell me, if you \nunderstand.\n5 Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring \nline across it? 6 On what were its footings set,\n    or who laid its cornerstone\u2014\n7 while the morning stars sang together\n    and all the angels[a] shouted for joy?\n\n+ God cannot be disproved or proved,  but it does not follow that there \naren't evidences for God. There is a difference between Proof (as in \nmathematics) vs Evidences (pointers like Creation, Logical arguments, \nHistorical, Legal, Archaeological, etc.) Plausibility is all we believers \nhave to establish -- and that we have in abundance! \n\n+ Yes, we go by faith, and the pointers (evidences) are good for entering \nfaith. God is able appear to all as proof that He exists, but has chosen \nnot to do this at this time (although He will in the future as written in \nthe Bible). I don't understand why people put down or freak out about \nFaith.  After all, we live in this earth exercising faith -- even within \nthe natural realm -- in different degrees, so what makes anyone think that \nfaith is un-natural? \n\n+ There is a difference between Faith and Credulity, however. Credulity has \nno evidence or pointers attached to what is believed, kinda like the belief \nof Poseidon or Medusa or Spaghetti Monster. No evidence for these exist, \nbut folks can choose to be credulous. But this is different from having \nfaith in a real person like Jesus who has a history (and fulfilled \nprophecies) as evidence of his existence and life.  ",

Idiot.  Second, YOU DELETED THE COMMENT, so that no one \ncan see the evidence of what an ass you made of yourself.  LMAO.  You are a \npathetic joke.\n\nThere are countless factual elements to evolution.  Only a brainwashed, \nignorant, blind denier says the stupid, false crap about evolution that you \nare saying.  It involves absolutely ZERO faith and is based 100% on \nevidence.  You are offering what is known as a false equivalency, and one \nthat is commonly used by religious nuts like you re: evolution.

That doesn't make it a baby.  More \nimportanly, it doesn't matter if it has the potential to become a baby, or \nthe potential for anything else tied to that, since it wouldn't matter if \nit already WAS a baby, child, person, or human being, since no baby, child, \nperson, or human being has the right to occupy, use, or alter a woman's \nbody against her will.

You either being unwilling or unable to understand \nand address it doesn't change reality, Mr Altar.  I will give you another \nchance to respond.  Since nothing that is a person has the right to occupy, \nuse, or alter a woman's physiology against her will, even if \nhe/she/it needs to in order to stay alive, what makes you think that an \nembryo/fetus (which is not remotely universally even accepted as being a \nperson) does, or should have the right?

Also, it almost seems to me that you \nthink that if a woman has a lot of sex (nothing wrong with that) and \naccidentally ends up pregnant, then she can abort the fetus without \nrepercussion?  I agree, but what about a man who has a lot of sex and \naccidentally gets a woman pregnant, it's the same case, but with a \ndifferent gender.  The man has no choice on the matter and has to either \ndeal with the abortion or pay child support, which isn't fair considering \nhe had no say in it.  What i think is that men should have the option to \nlegally \"abort\" a child and not have to pay child support if the pregnancy \nwas an accident.  It may be a little ripe for abuse, but women have been \nscrewing over men by purposefully getting pregnant to leech of their \nsuccess for a long time, so this evens the playing field i think.

Even \nsterilization fails at times. The only thing that is 100% is abstinence and \nthat's not going to happen in a fulfilling, loving and happy marriage. Why \nshould I be forced to carry a pregnancy I never wanted? Why should I be \nforced to become a parent when I never wanted to be one? I'm doing my part \nand if it fails me, I will run, not walk, to the nearest abortion clinic.",

The fact is that these superficial \nsimilarities do not constitute evidence, which is why they are generally \ndismissed by scholars. Horus, Krishna, Serapis, and even Julius Cesar have \nall been cited as purported explanations for Jesus, and all of them fail \nmiserably upon scrutiny. Your assertion that no extra-bibical proof of \nJesus exists, or that the evidence is scant, is false; there is plenty of \nevidence, and given that Jesus was a mere carpenter, the body of evidence \nfor his existence is considerable. The greatest proof is the bible itself, \nspecifically the gospels and letters of Paul, and they cannot be dismissed \nbased on belief, or lack there of. This is apologetics, but it is also \nsound logic. Jesus couldn't have conceivably been Horus, Cesar, Apollonius, \nKrishna and Serapis, and the arguments that Jesus was someone else, or \ndidn't exist, are so simplistic and flawed, that they have been either \nthoroughly dismantled or casually discarded by academicians and historians, \nincluding Bart Ehrman.\n\nI am very familiar with Ehrman, and if you are too, you will know that his \nwork deals primarily with biblical inerrancy. Even these arguments are \nweak, as the alleged proliferation of errors is explained by orthographical \nerr, and have no bearing on the text's meaning. His arguments concerning \nthe rhetorical discrepancies between the gospels are likewise unconvincing; \nthough the narratives do differ in there portrayal of Jesus, there is no \ncontradiction concerning the substance of what has transpired; it is simply \na matter of different perspectives chronicling the same events.\n\nThere is no proof that can be presented that will convince you that Jesus \nis who he, his disciples, and I myself, say he is: Jesus is Lord. You seem \nlike an intelligent individual, but you will never understand Jesus purely \nthrough intellect; what you need is an experience. I had many of the same \nobjections and concerns that you have, but I realized that my own \nunderstanding is limited, decided to rededicate my life to the Lord, and I \nam glad. I'd be more than willing to share my experiences with you, but if \nnot afforded that opportunity, I will simply ask that you open your mind \nand heart to the possibility that he is real.

                    "text": "+Nerobyrne First, the issue here IS pregnancy, not AFTER pregnancy.  \nAbortion rights is the broad topic, and the specific issue is these clinics \nthat deceitfully try to get women to think they are there to help them, \nrather than con them into not having abortions. The woman is free to choose \nwhatever she wants regarding being pregnant.  Not wanting to pay child \nsupport is a completely separate topic that really should be addressed on a \nvideo that is about that topic.  That being said, I will address your \nthoughts on child support one more time...\n\nOne parent of the other is going to get primary custody in most cases.  \nEqual custody is still fairly rare, even though it is much more common than \nit used to be.  I have a good friend who has equal custory with his ex, and \nneither pays child support, despite the fact that he makes far more than \nshe does.  I don't mean for that anecdotal situation to be proof of a broad \nreality.  I am just pointing out that things have changed to some degree.  \nTraditionally, the woman has been far more likely to get primary custody, \nwhich in and of itself makes it more of the man's burden to provide child \nsupport, since the woman is providing the primary home and care.  This has \nbeen especially true in the past,  Whichever parent is NOT providing the \nprimary home and care IS generally going to be more liable for paying \nsupport.  That's just simple reality.  AND men STILL don't contend for \nprimary custody nearly as often as women do, with there being a much more \ncommon situation of agreement that the woman will have primary custody \nwithout it being contended. You are arguing as if the common practice is \nfor every couple to dispute over primary custody, AND you are contending \nthat the man shouldn't have to pay for the child's support.  That is a \npreposterous coupling.  Does the man both want primary custody AND not want \nto provide for the child?  It is ridiculous, even theoretically.  If the \nman argues that he shouldn't have to pay child support because he never \nwanted the child, he is obviously not going to be given primary custody, \nffs.  So that renders the complaint about not getting custody completely \nimpotent for anyone that is contending, as you are, that not wanting the \nchild is grounds to not pay for it, WHILE complaining that men don't \nget custody nearly as often.  If you want custody, you have no argument as \nto not wanting the child to exist.  That is simply absurd.  Again, only one \nparent is going to get custody in most cases, which means that the other \nparent is going to be liable to owe some support.  As far as the woman \nlying to you go, that is a fringe issue that would be practically \nimpossible to prove, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, is ultimately irrelevant.  One, \nthe woman could have been using contraception and gotten pregnant anyway.  \nTwo, THE CHILD EXISTS REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT WAS  \nCONCEIVED.  How does wanting the child or being aware of a pregnancy change \nthe fact that you were the one that impregnated the woman and created the \nchild that now exists and needs food, clothing, and shelter?  Who should be \nthe parties that pay for that child's necessities and provide care for that \nchild?  Society, who didn't have sex and create the child???  Or the people \nthat DID have sex and create the child, whether they wanted to have a child \nor not?  The child exists and has to be provided for.  It is ridiculous for \nyou to contend that the first line of support should be someone other than \nthe parents.  If you don't want to make it possible for you to be \nresponsible for providing for any children, don't have sex.  You are \ninherently assuming the risk of that reality when you choose to have sexual \nintercourse.",

If not, then I was wrong. But it certainly sounds \nlike that. And yes, I think that it should be equally split between both \nparents, ideally. \n\nOf course, many factors effect these court decisions, but it certainly \ndoesn't sound like there is equality in this area of the justice system.\n\nMy original point was supposed to be about being forced into paying child \nsupport for children you never wanted if a woman lied to you, and I agree \nit should be taken up with the court.

                    "text": "+Bazooka Harwell You didn't answer my question.  I asked what the \ndifference was between saying he shouldn't give his opinion and it isn't \nright for him to give his opinion.  Apparently, you are a moron that thinks \nsaying \"It isn't right to offer his opinion\" is the same as saying \"He \ndoesn't HAVE THE RIGHT to express AN opinion.\"  I didn't say that anyone \ndoesn't have the right to express anything they like.  You are conflating \ngeneric views on what is appropriate with a literal right to do something.  \nYou don't do anything to help your cause when you make such childish, \nerroneous distinctions.  You didn't answer the question, and instead whined \nabout something else.\nNo, you actually DON'T have the right to tell any particular woman what to \ndo about her pregnancy.  That would involve you knowing her medical \nreality, which IS LITERALLY not your business.  You can make whatever \ngeneric statements you want about abortion, but you do NOT have the right \nto butt into the personal lives of all women, for ANY reason.\nThe \"sabotaged condom\" fantasy is a laughable sideshow.\nThe ideaS of \"reasonable degree of safe sex\" AND \"reasonable suspicion\" of \nit were both initiated BY YOU, asshole.  LOL.  Cry about your own bullshit \nas you will, but trying to create a diversion by pretending someone else is \ncreating a distinction that doesn't exist isn't going to work.  You have NO \nBASIS for a \"reasonable suspicion\" of not engaging in \"safe sex\" anymore \nthan you have an ability to determine that ANYONE engaged in a \"reasonable \ndegree of safe sex.\"  That is a bunch of white noise that has no practical \nmeaning and is completelely useless to the topic.  The issue shouldn't be \nconsidered at all because no one will ever know if any particular instance \nof sexual intercourse involved \"safe sex,\" LET ALONE will no one ever know \nthat any such supposed instance of a lack of \"safe sex\" was the cause of a \nparticular pregnancy.  It is a ridiculously silly fixation.\nI never said a word about any \"wife,\" asshole.  YOU DID.  You assumed \n\"wife\" in YOUR gibberish.  Marriage is irrelevant to the issue, and I \npointed out that YOU used the word \"wife\" in your inane ramblings.  There \nis no speculation.  YOU brought it up, kiddo.\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?  The expectation of a mother \nsupporting a father?  That has nothing to do with the topic, ffs.  And from \nwhere did that notion even come?  There is no such obligation.  AND there \nis no expectation of the father to support the mother.  OBVIOUSLY, you are \narguing from the precept that CHILD support paid by a man is to support a \nwoman.  IT ISN'T.\nA woman being a \"deadbeat\" has NO BEARING on the man's obligations.  I \nnever said that a woman doesn't have obligations.  I was simply responding \nto the ridiculous defense for not supporting a child that you offered.  \n\"The mother isn't supporting the child, so I shouldn't have to either.\"  \nYeah, that's a brilliant defense.  And no, no woman has any obligation to \nnurse any baby.\nSociety thinking that a woman is \"off the hook\" for raising her child is a \npreposterous imagining that pulled out of your ass.  The responsibilities \nARE equal for each gender.\nWomen have ALL the leverage regarding pregnancy, you buffoon.  That's the \nvery point.  THEY SHOULD.  They are the ones that are pregnant.  HELLO???\nYou didn't pay attention.  Calling someone an asshole is not inherently an \nad hominem, DUMBASS.  (Note the boldface type which also is not inherently \nan example of ad hominem.).  Pointing out that not wanting to pay for your \nchild is atrocious is not remotely an adhominem.  Calling something \noffensively stupid, massively misogynistic, greedy, or selfish is ALSO not \ninherently an adhominem.  As I already pointed out, you need to learn what \n\"ad hominem\" means.  It doesn't simply mean that you were insulted or \ncalled a name.  If I call you and stupid asshole, and in so doing point out \nWHY you are a stupid asshole, then it isn't an adhominem, kiddo.  An ad \nhominem is a personal attack used IN LIEU OF a substantive argument, which \nI already explained to you.",

There are several \nexperts that are not even religious that support the link between abortion \nand breast cancer, but I name one for the sake of brevity. Dr. Louise \nBrinton who was present at the 2003 workshop that determined a link. She \nreversed her decision after looking again at the evidence when before, she \nwas a proponent of her colleagues who stated there was not a link.\nIt is so easy to revert to assumptions. I could definitely say the same \nthing about pro-abortion advocates who have proven to go to any lengths to \npush their agenda. But you are right. It happens on both sides, pro-life, \npro abortion folks can behave with such bias, there is not much room for \nfacts.  I'd rather err on the side of truth. You are assuming that everyone \nin the world is wrong but Western doctors. There can be bias even among the \nso called experts. It is up to us to do our research on both sides to see \nwhat makes the most sense. It is interesting that you end your post with a \nstatement  \"even if  those rights include making decisions which may have \nrisks associated.\" Sounds like there might be a possibility that there \ncould be a link in your mind, which is the point. It would be just as wrong \nto suppress or show bias about a link because pro-abortion side does not \nwant to discourage women from getting abortions. I have warned friends of \nmine who have had abortions to make sure you check yourself, especially \nbecause there might be a link. That in itself has nothing to do with \nreligion. That is about concerned for my loved ones who might be at greater \nrisk. If you are really concerned about the truth, you would look at both \nsides of this argument OBJECTIVELY instead of dismissing it because of \nsomeone's religion. \nAgain, every person or professional who thinks there is a link does not \nthink that because of religion.",

I'm \nglad that you can navigate away from your cozy little brainwashed corner! \nHave an internet cookie~\n\nYeah, the problem is that you're looking at a type of abortion that isn't \ntypically practiced in the states. They're looking at the providences in \nCHINA, where abortions are made essentially mandatory, as they're still \nstruggling with the one child per family issue. They are also looking at \nwomen who have had more than one, and are only analyzing the abortion \nfactors, rather than any latent history (genes) or other such factors that \ncould increase (or decrease) their chances. They're also not taking into \naccount the sanitation or proper training of such places. China is not a \ngood place for worker or patient safety, in terms of heavy pollutants \n(which could certainly cause cancer) or even just everyday hazards. Why do \nyou think their labor is so much cheaper? Because they don't give a rat's \nass about their people. Also, abortion is the main 'contraceptive' in \nChina; most other nations have many other options. One study in a very \ndifferent country is not enough to prove such a devastating link for \ncausation.\n\nThe cancer research centers in the US and many other countries in Europe \nhave yet to find a positive link from abortion to any kind of cancer. If \nanything, forcing a woman to carry a rotting fetus inside of her for \nhowever long was needed to induce labor is far more likely to cause disease \nthan getting it out as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, my aunt had ovarian cancer (thankfully it is in remission now)-- \nwhich is another version of cancer that many bible-humping pro-lifers like \nto suggest is caused by abortion-- and she never once had any kind of \nabortion or other invasive method to control birth.

I mean, come on. Do \nwe REALLY need any more orphans? More children up for adoption? If I hear \n\"just put it up for adoption\" one more time, I will slap a bitch. There are \nmillions of kids out there, waiting to be adopted, and then this baby pops \nout, and where do the parents who can't have babies turn to?

I bet you once a woman decides to have a \nbaby after being convinced (or forced) to not have an abortion, no one's \ngoing to give a shit about the baby's welfare once it pops out of her \nvagina. If that kid goes wrong, steals a car, robs a bank, or something \nworse, you all will point at the mother, claiming she's to blame, she's an \nunfit mother, and she shouldn't be having kids if she can't properly raise \nthem.

Have you ever \nseen the movie Precious?\n\nSome babies end up like Precious, abused physically, sexually, and \nverbally. Her mother even told her she should have aborted her. This can \ntotally damage a child, even a teenager. Imagine having to go through that.\n\n Foster care isn't any better, I know a girl that stayed in school for \nabout a week before she moved to another school after another. The reason \nis that she had to move into different foster families. Do you know what \nthat can do to a kid? Having to move around all the time into different \nfamilies? How much education can a child get if they constantly move \naround? Not every school is going to be on the same chapter as them in \nwhatever class they are to be enrolled in.\n\nYes, some people had lived in poverty that eventually raised themselves up \nto wealth, but to have that is like finding a golden penny deep in the \nocean. Not everyone is going to have that. Do you know how many teenage \ngirls would throw away their education for a baby they didn't ask for? Same \nthing here, some women end up being rich single mothers and some are \nunfortunate, but the possibility of finding that path is almost impossible, \nmaybe even 50%. Maybe less. \n\nThere is no guarantee of any baby's future, no one can prevent a hero from \nbeing born the same way no one can be responsible for a heinous villain's \nbirth. There is just no way that *every* single baby can be saved from \npoverty later in their lives. Maybe one or two, but not all. The same can \nbe said for babies being abused for the rest of their lives, there just \nisn't any guarantee. If anything, the mother should be the one to hold the \nchoice of keeping, putting up a baby for adoption, or aborting a baby, no \none else. They deserve a chance at life too, don't they? Don't they deserve \nthe choice that may change their lives, good or bad? Don't they deserve to \nget their diploma?

As I said before, \nhowever, there are also at least hundreds of millions that abort for \nnatural reasons.

By your logic, all those sperm could've been babies!\nWhen nature can abort a child, but humans can't, there's a bullshit line \nyou've crossed. Death is part of life -- and in this case it helps the \nmother continue to live her life. I agree that those who use it just \nbecause they didn't think to use birth control methods are stupid and I am \nindeed tempted to make them keep it, just to suffer the consequences, but \nthat doesn't really *help*.

                    "text": "Wow. Just WOW.\nYou're assuming one hell of a lot with that, so let me dismantle it one \nassumption at a time.\n\nAssumption 1: That I would have sex without contraception.\nI have (and will until I'm thinking about having children) used birth \ncontrol pills. I've been on them since I was 16. I also always insist that \nany sexual partners I have use a condom, as I am currently not in a \nrelationship anymore it is even more important and immovable point if a guy \nwishes for sex from me. I currently have abstained for almost two years \nsimply because I haven't been in a relationship, so your entire point using \nme as reference is total bullshit.\n\nAssumption 2: That a one day old baby has a personality.\nIf you're literally talking about a day after conception... you're \ncompletely ignorant of facts. Until about the late second trimester, a baby \nis a clump of cells and then eventually begins to look like a shrimp, then \na chick, THEN it begins to kind of look human. No study has even found \nbrainwave activity until the third trimester. Without an active brain, \nthere is no way a child has any kind of personality. Further sociological \nstudies after children are born have pointed to at LEAST several months \nafter birth to determine a 'personality' emerging. Differences in activity \nlevel/noise level, etc are almost certainly due to biological stimulants \nrather than internal thought processes; they have to be around long enough \nto have been influenced by the world in order to form a personality, as \nthat comes from social and cultural interaction/experiences.\nAlso, if you believe a baby is a fertilized egg, then EVERY WOMAN on this \nENTIRE PLANET that has ever had more than ONE PERIOD while she was in a \nconsensual relationship and didn't use contraception is a MURDERER. That \nwould make a massive number of women SERIAL KILLERS. Those fertilized eggs \nare flushed out with her period. Also would include the about 20% of \nfetuses naturally abort before a woman has any clue she's pregnant for a \nmyriad of reasons. If nature can abort a child for reasons it deems \n'necessary', why can't we have enough reign over our own bodies with modern \nscience to do so?\n\nAssumption 3: That your argument (which is only based in emotional pleas, \nwhich you probably believe will work on me simply because I'm a woman) \nabout viewing this from the child's angle would get me to change my mind.\nFirst off: it's not a fuckin' kid. In my personal opinion, a kid doesn't \nreally matter until it becomes self-aware (which is at about six months of \nage, usually). Until that point it is like a dog or cat -- you have to care \nfor its needs and killing them is certainly abhorrent. BUT -- before a \nchild is out of its mother's womb, it is nothing more than a parasitic life \nform that is causing the mother's body quite a bit of strain and has been \nfor 9 MONTHS. If that said parasitic life form would cause the mother's \ndeath, if it is a product of rape, if it is the product of poor decisions \n(and thus will likely be forced into abject poverty or at least a family \nwhere the mother resents her own child because they stopped her from going \nplaces with her own life, [even though it was her issue of either being too \nlazy/ignorant/stupid to use some birth control method(s) or because she was \nalready in such an abject poverty situation that she could not \nafford/receive birth control in the first place]) then the mother has all \nthe right in the world to terminate HER pregnancy. I would carry no regret \nabout terminating a pregnancy, because I would only ever do it in extreme \ncircumstances (rape, if the baby was malformed and would live a horrible, \npainful life outside the womb). And, if I were the child (as you suggested) \nand you likely meant a clump of cells... I wouldn't have a clue that I was \nbeing aborted, so I wouldn't give two shits. If you believe in souls -- and \nI do -- then even if there's a soul already there, it will go into a \ndifferent child, one that's wanted, one that will be happy with a loving \nfamily.\n\n\nFinal Points:\nI'm sure I've repeated myself about several issues, but they are all \nimportant so I hope they finally sink in to your thick skull.\nIt isn't the right of white, privileged males to decide what does or \ndoesn't go on in WOMEN'S bodies. The congressmen with the \"legitimate rape\" \nand \"god-given rape\" 'arguments' make it PAINFULLY clear that not only do \nthey not know the first thing about what they are talking about and, at the \nsame time, that they want women to suffer with their natural massive \nburdens in life for their religious fanatical caucus.\n\nAlso, the point about foster care is COMPLETELY relevant -- but, as usual, \npro-lifers ignore the facts in order to attempt to bolster their case. The \nissue of abortion is heavily effected by the fate of the children that \nwould be \"saved\" or aborted. It severely undermines pro-life stances to \nremind them of what happens to a vast majority of those babies (and the \nwomen they sometimes kill in order to be born or ruin the lives of).\nGranted, I completely believe that there are a lot of people that are \nirresponsible and don't use birth control when they should be. HOWEVER, I \ndon't believe that mistake should fuck up their entire lives -- thus my \nstance on this.\n\nI'll stop fighting when it's safe, legal and nigh untouchable -- and, \nhopefully, at the same time the companies that claim birth control goes \nagainst their religious beliefs at least also ban Viagra and other such \ndrugs (and penis pumps) but preferably realize how stupid their being and \nallow birth control back onto their plans. The stats of several other \ncountries that have already settled this stupid debate point overwhelmingly \nto the idea that access to informative/comprehensive sex education, \nhealthcare, birth control and legal abortion DRAMATICALLY reduces the \ninstances of abortion as well as the numbers of children in foster care \nservices.",

I would think so.\n\nAlso, what makes us 'human' is sentience -- or an awareness of \"self\" -- \nchildren do not develop this until around six months of age. Until then, \nthey are not human but a treasured pet parasite. Don't get me wrong, \nchildren are adorable and have a large place in our society, but that \ndoesn't mean we should save unwanted pregnancies. It is the merciful thing \nto abort, both for the child and for the mother/parents.\n\nAlso, if you happen to believe that a fertilized egg counts as a baby, then \nhere is an interesting fact that I'm sure you're not aware of (because you \ndon't have the parts): every woman that has has more than one period in her \nlife-time has put out an egg (likely fertilized if she'd had unprotected \nsex before the end of her cycle) with her menstrual blood. So... by that \ndefinition, every single woman on this planet that has had more than one \nperiod is a SERIAL KILLER. Also, about 20% of natural pregnancies abort \nbefore the woman even knows she's pregnant.",

Studies show the raise in breast cancer due to the \nraise in birth control intake by women of the U.S. Don't live reckless, \nchoose a mate who lives/eats healthy as you do, be responsible, (or to \nexpress my hearts pain for the on going whorish life styles of many women, \nKEEP YA LEGS CLOSED, use condoms, or just live by the BIBLE, which says to \neat veggies, whole grain, nuts, fish, fruits, and NO pork/red meat. So much \nbacteria that lives and thrives  for years in your body from it. The bible \nneeds to be take seriously on those accounts. Also my aunt gave birth to a \ndead baby, so I understand the emotional state it put one into. It must be \nawfully hard to coup with, nerve wrecking, depressing. You do have my \ndeepest sympathy for you or who ever you may know who's gone through such a \nmishap :-/ And for the record, Christians give Christians a bad name for \nnot taking into account the power of his words, not the power of mans fake \nmagical antidotes called big pharma. In the word they speak of the devils \nproduct.  Forgive me for any offences you may have felt here, trying to \nbridge a gap that's all. ",

Gay love and such is yet another human ASSUMTION \nthat is sin when it is really not. Just wanted to point that out.\n\n3. After saying all this, I am not picking and choosing the sins I do and \ndon't like. When Jesus went don on earth he set an example of how humans \nshould act towards each other and never ONCE did he hate, ridicule, \ndiscriminate, or try to dehumanize the people around him.\n\n4. Following that the basics of being a Christian is to LOVE and share(not \nforce) Gods word. The fact that Russia churches and \"Christians\" approved \nof this discriminating law is a sin because they skipped SEVERAL verses \nthat went against it, totally ignored loved, and twisted Gods word by ONLY \ntalking about the passages in the Bible on homosexuality. :/  ",

I meant \"antique\" (I'm not \na native speaker) - term which (at least in Europe) refers to the \nhistorical time of later Egyptian realms, ancient Greece (Sparta, \nAthens...) and Roman empire - approx. from 1000 BCE to approx 900 CE (when \nearly middle-ages starts)\"\n\nMy apologies, if you are European  then it makes sense, hence why i asked \n(as well, my bloodline is italian/greek/middle eastern).  The dates you \ngive by the way, are decided differently by different secular sources, i \nprefer to remain with the Biblical reliable ones, since ladies like Eliat \nMazar, and her father's work only further impress the evidence further on \nthe world histories done by James Ussher for example.\n\n\"As I wrote, I'm European. I didn't have to pay for my education, we have \nit for free here (may be that's the reason why even religious people here \nare educated and don't believe in creationism and other shits...) \"\n\nYes, i know, you've been taught by satanists and you do not realize it, i \ntotally understand, i'm no stranger to Europe.  Not every nation in Europe \nhas it for free, so you should at least point that out instead of blanket \nlabeling it.  A shame you you don't realize you are part of the biggest \nreligion in the world, evolution, which the Pope leads, but of course, \nlet's ignore the whole Jesuit connection right?\n\n\"- although, in fact, I did payed for it, since I attended private school - \nbut that was later, university in management, which is not related to those \nknowledge of mine.\"\n\nStudy who owns the universities and why they teach what they do, then come \nback to me in 20 years and see if you still repeat the same thing.\n\n\"I got my knowledges from:\n- my history teachers (three of them during the time)\"\n\nIf the history they are giving us is not the true history, but they don't \nknow that and are teaching it as though it is factual history because their \nuniversity 'education' tells them that, then that's not learning about the \n'record of earth', it's called learning \"HIS\" story, a reference by the \nancient pythagorean egyptian secret society members to THEIR version of \nhistory that the masses will be taught under the impression they are \nlearning \"TRUTH\" and \"WISDOM\" when really it's the HIVE mentality they are \nlearning in order to have a successful Supra-National Communist Global Big \nBrother state.\n\n\" my arts teachers (religion, philosophy, sociology - three of them. Oh, \none of them also taught history of modern Palestine and Israel on the \nUniversity, beside teaching on high school...)\"\n\nOh so you got the super duper synagogue of satan mind twisting history \nlessons huh? So you are going to be even more devastated when you finally \ncome to realize how much of it was false history.\n\n\"- books (those things you can read and gain knowledge... you know, all \nthose other books which are not Bible, like Chronicle of Mandkind and so \non...)\"\n\nFunny how Eliat Mazar and her father, who are both archaeologists in the \nMiddle East, you know, the ones who are actually digging in the dirt, you \nknow, where Eliat found recently over the last decade and more, hard \nevidence of King David's palace, they were/are both secular, and they have \nNO PROBLEMS admitting that the Bible is the best history book we have, \nbecause you know, there are those of us who do study archaeology, \nanthropology, and read MANY books of history, not just the Bible, but i \ndon't expect the goyim to comprehend, it's by design by your teachers.\n\n\"- documents... I also attended arts faculty for some time - so you can add \nsome more philosophy and teachers of philosophy to those from high school.\"\n\nFunny how Pythagoreous admits that \"Philo-sopia\", a word he invented, is \nthe love of the goddess of wisdom, a RELIGION of HEATHENS, but of course, \nyou know more than Pythagoreus right? I mean, you are an Egyptian Adept \nlike he was right? Funny as well is how you don't know that all the courses \nyou have learned and what was considered art then, compared to now, were \nonly for royal/nobility class, but now they have externalized the teachings \nof Egypt and Babylon via \"EDUCATION\" for the last hundreds of years, and \nhere you are, believing that all that 'education' was 'education' when \nactually, you've been being schooled in the mystery religions of babylon \nand don't even know it.  You are in a position that if you truly realized \nhow the system ran, who runs it, who THEY exactly are, your \"Schooling\" \nwould reveal to you ALL the ways they work in order to indoctrinate whole \nsocieties into a Romano-Greco-Persian-Babylonian mindset for the final \nchapter on this earth, a shame you haven't realized it yet.\n\n\"And sociology, since I've studied psychology there... and btw., when I \nwrite \"high school\", I mean \"gymnasium\" - basically elite high school in \nmeaning of elite teachers for the best 10% of kids, it is still non-payed \nstate school -\"\n\nThen you don't know what the \"STATE\" is, start learning actual geo-poltics \ninstead of the fabian socialist mind slavery.\n\n\"I don't want to seem smug, \"\n\nToo late.\n\n\"'I'm writing it just to distinguish my education from what most people \nknow under this American term of \"high school\" which, in concept, doesn't \neven exist in most Europe.\"\n\nWell that is justified, and is appreciated, and i do not disagree with you \nthere.\n\n\"And you know what? If you would suggested shit like \"satanist history\" \nhere in Europe, anywhere, even outside academical ground, everybody would \nlaugh and think that you are religious fanatic and moron.\"\n\nYes, because that's what those who are part of the sheep for the slaughter \ntoo, they abide in what is called \"CONSENSUS DETERMINES TRUTH, NOT \nEVIDENCE\".\n\nAll you prove is how well you are indoctrinated into the mystery babylon \nsystems of the world... for folks like you. \n\nWhat a waste of money and time if you remain under their control after all \nthat \"EDUCATION\" (read: Illuminist funded education).",

His Nation. \n\n+Eruptide you can go through the Bible and somewhere you will find \nstatement which will support anything. It's very nature of any \nnon-systematic text which is long enough. \nThe fact is that in Commandments (those Commandments) is nothing about \n*lying*, just about giving the false testimony. In all versions of those \nCommandments (yes, \"versions\" - there are two versions just in Bible \nitself, than in Christian theology one commandment (third I believe) was \ncrossed out during the middle ages - for that reason, last one was split \ninto two commandments, so the number \"ten\" was preserved - for that reason, \ntoday's 10th commandment is the second part of the same sentence as 9th \ncommandment.
