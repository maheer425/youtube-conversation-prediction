                "text": "In all honesty while I absolutely love this game, the backwards logic here \nis that Nintendo's top priority concerning fun is design and solid game \nplay.  In order to provide a full, 100% potentially fun experience, they \nneed to take a step outside their little security box/bubble and learn to \n*extend* that potential to *include* presentation (graphics and audio)  and \nbalance each aspect equally.  Now don't get me wrong, here, coming from \nsomebody who games on 1 each from the big 3, handhelds included; Super \nMario 3D World already looks really good and well put together on its own, \nbut I mean they could be doing so much more to modernize and the looks and \nfeel of every character, every universe in their franchises to achieve and \ninspire more believability if they just added more necessary layers of \ntexture to really make their games pop and feel alive and somewhat real, or \nat least believable.  For instance, straight from the Super Smash Bros \nBrawl trailer (or possibly the more current 1, I don't quite recall if he \nretained the same texurized appearance), you could see how Mario's overalls \nlooks closer to real clothes, his shirt and cap even, maybe his hair and \nmustache?  Why can't he look like this in his own platformer despite the \ntrailer?  Why can't the Mushroom Kingdom present more liveliness like that \nfor matter?  What about Pokemon; With the ever growing amount you can't \npossibly tell me you haven't even remotely dreamed or imagined a more \nrealistic looking version of your favorite 1 in our world.  How about \nMetroid, which probably already does a fair job in its own respect, maybe \nKid Icarus? (Uprising being the best resourceful reference here, which I \nimage also provides its fair share)  Hell, even Donkey Kong *shudder* \n(Sorry, just never been a fan of this 1) could benefit from these factors; \nI've not once seen the guy take a step outside the side-scrolling genre of \nhis own series and into the 3D world model for a change.  What's up with \nthat, Nintendo?  Long story short, if Nintendo expects to gain back its \nonce loyal fanbase from our retro veteran days, they just need to step up \nand expand all of that untapped potential in order to play with the big \nboys. otherwise the majority will continue to see them as 2nd best despite \ntheir reputation which i'm honestly not knocking.  What the don' realize is \nthat if they don't take any risks (like on solid, reliable hardware for \nexample) they're only holding themselves back, plus how to learn from their \nmistakes and that i's OK.  Nobody will ever think any less of them if \nthey'd at least try a little harder.  These aren't the easy go lucky 1-up \ndays of Nintendo vs Sega, anymore, they have some serious competition on \ntheir hands now. slightly beyond Micro$oft and $ony for that matter, just \nnot so much on the same scale.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+xXNinjaRunnerXx Yeah, I don't really know much any more way to explain it \nthan just adding more layers of texture and detail to create or immerse \nmore believable worlds in the sense of imagining them.  1 thing I'll say \nwhile they may not pertain to Nintendo games or even game graphics in \ngeneral, is whenever I've seen the earlier live action Halo trailers, even \nsome of the current 1s here and there, despite everything else I learn of \nthe game play, is rather what really gets me jacked for a game and become \nmore immersed because it's just so alive and while it's completely fiction, \nit looks like a believable reality.  But that's just me because I'm all for \nsci-fi, not so much for WW/civil/modern combat because history wasn't \nreally a strong suit for me so I never really connected with it.  That \nsaid, half the time I'm not completely in it for the competitive side much \nanymore, but because every once in a while if I get a chance to see parts \nof their universe so amazing I'll take it whenever I can.  That's pretty \nmuch more or less why I'd like to see Nintendo take their IPs up a notch \nand I'm not saying they have to go nitty gritty or Mortal Kombat on them; \nIt's just that more or less they've always been the 1s with the best \nfranchises, (Sega for Sonic the Hedgehog anyway) that always kept me \nplaying an focused  for hours and hours, day after day, that kept us on our \nfeet to this very day.  So it'd just kinda be nice to take a little more of \nthat with us without feeling like we've outgrown them.  I don't know, I \nguess the best way I can think of it is that perhaps the games we all knew \nand loved so much from back in the day should grow with us a little, that's \nall.",

                    "text": "+Shahe Ansar False, it is you who can't accept reality. Here's an article \nthat I've copy and pasted so that you may better understand why the Wii U \nsucks.\n\n*1. The Weird Controller Stew*\nYou can\u2019t get much less simple than the Wii U\u2019s controller setup. There's \nthe gamepad and the Wii remote, with some games requiring both, especially \nin multiplayer. There's the Pro Controller. There's the coming \nGameCube-inspired controller. In multiplayer, only one player can have the \ngamepad, which can lead to fights over it or general confusion as it is \nexchanged from hand to hand. The Wii sold itself through simplicity, the \nWii U is weirdly complex. One of the most common questions among those new \nto the console is simply, \"what controllers do I need?\" \n\n*2. The Gamepad Perplexes Even Nintendo*\nWhen you introduce a new, innovative technology, it's a good idea to have \nsome idea of what to do with it, but it soon become apparent that Nintendo \nhad few ideas for the gamepad. They used it in a few party games, but \nincreasingly ignored it for everything but off-TV play. Only after a couple \nof disastrous years and suggestions that the Wii U should simply be \nre-released without the pricey controller has Nintendo started working on \ndoing something with the thing.\n\n*3. Third Party Support is Virtually Nonexistent*\nThere\u2019s a big different between getting third party publishers to announce \na handful of games for a console before launch and getting real support for \nit. After failing with a few ports of aging games, then noticing the Wii \nU's weak sales, most publishers have lost all interest in the console.\n\nThird party publishers would love to have successful games on a Nintendo \nsystem, but for the most part non-Nintendo games just don\u2019t do well, and if \nthere's anything that Nintendo could do to change that, they certainly \nhaven't done it.\n\n*4. It's Underpowered*\nWhy did people buy the Xbox 360 and the PS3? Better graphics. That was the \nselling point; these systems would blow you away with a level of detail \nyou\u2019ve never seen before. What is the Wii U offering? Graphics that may be \nslightly better than those of the 360 and PS3, and inferior to those of the \nXB1 and PS4. Why on earth would anyone buy the Wii U over a comparable \nmachine with a backlog of high-def games or new, far more powerful systems? \nEspecially since that lack of power means many new games are not, according \nto their developers, possible on the Wii U?\n\n*5. The Controller is Less Impressive Than an iPhone*\nIf you\u2019re going to do something, do it right. Sure, the Wii gamepad's touch \nscreen is a clever idea, but it also feels like it\u2019s already behind the \ntechnological curve. While an iPhone is multi-touch, allowing you to do \nthings like expand a photo by pulling it like taffy, the Wii U\u2019s controller \nis single touch, like their DS. And while the inner-facing camera might \nallow games to do cute things like put you on screen, an outer-facing \ncamera that could let the controller perfectly align itself with the TV \nwould seem far more useful.\n\n*6. It's Too Expensive for What It Is*\nSure, it's cheaper than the PS4 and XB1, but the Wii U's price compares \npoorly with the last-gen consoles that equal it in power; right now you can \nget a 4 GB Xbox 360 with Kinect for $250 or a 500GB PS3 for just a little \nmore. The Wii U is $300, with only 32GB of storage. This would be fine if \nthe Wii U were a technological advance over the others, but for a console \nthat's no more powerful than its aging competition, the price still seems \nhigh. \n\nTrue, it's cheaper than a PS4 or XB1, but it also only has a fraction of \nthe power.\n\n*7. No Internal Hard Drive*\nStorage space is yet another of Nintendo\u2019s many blind spots. When they \ncreated the Wii they didn\u2019t even consider the issues of downloading games, \nand even balked when gamers demanded a solution. This time around, they are \nstill relying on flash memory, although at least internal memory has gone \nto a choice of 8 or 32 GB from the half GB in the Wii. You can, at least, \nattach a USB drive, although about the last thing in my life I need is yet \nanother device I have to plug into my power strip.\n\n*8. Dodgy Online*\nNintendo has never understood online gaming. Market forces have dragged \nthem, kicking and screaming, towards very minimal online capabilities, but \nthey have never really seemed to believe that online gaming was necessary \nor desirable, nor have they focused resources on it the way they needed to. \nThe Wii U's online is certainly an improvement for Nintendo, but they're \nyears behind the competition.\n\n*9. Deserts Its Casual Base*\nThe Wii was a brilliant idea; a controller so easy and intuitive that it \ndrew a slew of non-gamers into the world of videogames. Now, after having \nsold consoles to millions of non-gamers, Nintendo seems to be done with \ntheir converts, and is putting out a controller with the very collection of \ntriggers and buttons that kept casual gamers from playing videogames \npre-Wii. Sure, the Wii U still has the Wii\u2019s remote and nunchuk, but those \nare increasingly ignored, meaning there\u2019s no reason for casual gamers to \neven consider upgrading to the new system. This leaves Nintendo in a fight \nwith Sony and Microsoft for the very core gamers who consider the Wii U \nbeneath notice.\n\n*10. Iffy Core Game Commitment*\nNintendo claimed that with the Wii U they were making something for the \ncore gamers they had ignored throughout the Wii\u2019s history. The Wii U, would \nnot just be a console for tots and grandmas; this time around there would \nbe far more games that could compete with the adult fare found on Sony and \nMicrosoft consoles.\n\nBut there weren't. Sure, they saved Bayonetta 2 and made it a Wii U \nexclusive, and two years later they did the same for Devil's Third, but a \nsingle core title every couple of years is hardly worth mentioning. \nNintendo likes to develop family-friendly games, and while some series, \nlike Legend of Zelda, Pikmin and Metroid Prime, are loved by core gamers, \nNintendo\u2019s own output will always skew towards families. With no support \nfrom third parties, the Wii U remains the province of tots and grandmas.\n\n*11. Gives Less Extras Than the Competition*\nWhile Sony and Microsoft wanted to be both gaming machines and media \ncenters, Nintendo still believes that a game console should just be a game \nconsole. It should not play DVDs, or BluRay, or be an MP3 player. Well, \nthey\u2019re wrong. Increasingly, gamers aren\u2019t even buying those things, they \njust use the versions that come with their consoles. If someone wants a \ngame console and a BluRay player, are they really going to buy one of each \nwhen they can just get a PS3 or PS4? As in so many cases, Nintendo is \nliving in the past, and ignoring what we living in the present have come to \nexpect from our machines; everything.\n\nTrue, you can watch Netflix, and you've got TVii, which I suppose someone \nactually uses, but that pales in comparison with the competition.\n\n*12. Nintendo Has Lost Its Mojo*\nOne of the main arguments for the success of the Wii U is simply that \nNintendo has proven previous naysayers wrong with the Wii, which industry \nanalysts predicted would be a flash-in-the-pan, and the DS, which many saw \nas a gimmick there was no real need for. But the poor sales of the 3DS that \nresulted in a shocking $80 price cut suggest that Nintendo\u2019s winning streak \ncould be coming to a close. While the 3DS did rebound, the falter with \nwhich it began, and with which the Wii U began, suggests that Nintendo may \nbe getting shakier in their grasp of the market.",

                "text": "This game is great, however so many of us were expecting an open 3d mario \ngame like 64 or sunshine. This game definitely gets the fun factor right \n(in milestones), but open world is still much better than linear. There's \nmore sense of awe to the levels, and secrets are much harder to find/have \nmore impact. It feels more like a \"world\" when it's open 3d rather than \nlinear 3d.\n\nThis game is far from bad, it's still amazing. But I just think that it was \ntimed poorly on the Wii U. If they had come out with the open world Mario \ngame first, then this game would have been received MUCH better. We are all \ncraving the open world Mario, as the last one we have seen was Sunshine. \nGalaxy and it's sequel were AMAZING, (I still consider them to be the best \n3d Mario Games), but they weren't truly open. It was fine back then because \nthe last game was Sunshine, but here, we need the open world Mario game \nagain.\n\nThis isn't a true 3d Mario game. This has become a series of it's own, \nwhich I'm cool with (really), but I am fearful that it's replacing the main \nseries of open-world 3d Mario games that we haven't seen since sunshine, \nand an extent, Galaxy.\ufeff",

I enjoy the open world \nlike structures of the levels in Sunshine and 64 (Sunshine being my \nfavorite Mario game for nostalgic reasons), but I think Mario games work \nbetter as tight, precision controlled platformers. The overall experience \nis condensed and isn't drawn out, in which I felt some levels where in both \nthose games. The frantic fast pace nature of older mario games are really \nexhilarating and most importantly fun. Games like SMG2 and SM3DW do this \nsuperbly. Nintendo provides the Mario games a good contrast with the Zelda \nand Metroid games, so I think you should really delve into those games if \nyou're looking for a fun nonlinear experience.",
