Not only does it seem like Frederator WANTS to help Internet \nTV become a Legitimate Thing, it's going to blow up in the next decade or \nso whether they're on board or not, so... might as well be on board.",

I think \nit was really cool for CH (cartoon hangover) to put the idea that Danny is \nbisexual, but like I said you (the reader) may have a different take and \nthat's ok. dang I should film a review of this episode its my favorite. I'm \njust stating my opinion and I feel that this episode is kinda creepy but it \nshows that (no I'm not going to say that Jesus is the answer to everything, \nand no Im not going to say that being homo is wrong) Danny is trying to \nfind a solid sexuality because in this world and the future people are \nso one brained someone has to be one way or the other so to speak, plus he \ndoesn't want to be a cheater cause that's just cruel. at the scene where \nroboChris is dancing in Danny's room Danny noticed how he had made a robot \nthat showed how dispirit he was and also how the reall Chris liked Beth so \nhe just gave up and went for plum.\n                                                                              \nno hate please,\n                                                                                               \npuppyinabox.",
