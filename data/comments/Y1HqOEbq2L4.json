At the event horizon the acceleration, or curvature(whatever you want to \nmeasure) is finite, the only thing that blows up there is a term in the \nmetric(for a very particular choice of coordinates), but that is only due \nto a bad choice of coordinates.

Lets say you go into a room you have never been \nbefore. The particles in your body would get entangled with the particles \nin the room, so their states have influence on the states of your \nparticles. If you would want to calculate the probability of a particle of \nyour body having a specific state, you would need to include all the \nentangled particles in your calculations. Even if you leave the room, your \nparticles keep their entanglement and never lose it. So from the big bang \nto now, every particle has been entangled with a big bunch of other \nparticles, thus influencing their states of superposition and getting \ninfluenced by them. As particles can't seem to lose these entanglements \nnaturally, they can only increase in amount, thus behaving quite similar to \nwhat we call time.\n\nI can search for the link to the paper if anyone is interested.",

Quantum theory says, a \nstate of a particle is unknown (to us AND the universe) until it is \nobserved. Going backwards in time would result in particles going back into \nsuperpositions, losing entanglement and so on. There are two possibilities \nI can think of:\n1. Quantum mechanics is wrong and the universe stores every state in time. \nThat would mean we can go backwards and forwards in time, like we want to. \nBut everything we observed about small particles leads to quantum mechanics \nbeing true.\n2. Quantum mechanics is true and every particle in a superposition is \ndescribed as a probability function (instead of real values). That would \nmean going backwards in time could result in a different past (while going \nbackwards) because particles would not be going back the exact same way \nthey came before, just the most probable one. But if the past itself would \nbe changed all of a sudden, we could definitely observe that. As we do not \nobserve any spontaneous fluctuations in time, we can be pretty sure we are \nnot going backwards in time \"sometimes\".\n\nIf there is anything wrong with my statements above, please do correct me :)",

Time is not \"something\" that \"goes\" in \nany damn direction. Times is a word we use to measure the scale of events \nthat passed and will pass. The events happend, its done, no way to go back \nor to go forward faster then you already are. All these so called \n\"scientists\" are a bunch of nerds with too much free time (the irony) on \ntheir hands. If we stay to think a little. even the black hole is just a \ntheory and nothing more. If it works as you, the scientists describe it, \nthen its impossible to ever see one because a black hole supose to absorb \neven the light and everything we see is a reflection of light into our \neyes, and if a black hole absorb light it means there is no reflected light \nand so u cant see it and so its another crap theory just like many others, \nfor example big bang, evolution theory and the rocks geologists find that \nhave miiiillions of years.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Megaprr\nPlease ignore that article. Whoever wrote that does not understand the \ndifference between a gravitational singularity and the Big Bang.\n\nThere is nothing in real science I have ever heard of that postulates \nuniverses are born from white holes. The science behind a white hole is \nsimply a mirror of the geometry of a Schwartzchild black hole using the \nKruskal-Szekeres coordinate system. The geometry shows the white hole is in \nthe infinite past. They do not exist since they violate the Laws of \nThermodynamics. The collapse of a star into a black hole using those same \ncoordinates is different from what really happens as according to GR (We \nneed a theory of quantum gravity to have one system for a collapsing star \nand a black hole).\n\nIf the writer was going off of that. He does not realize to look at the \nbigger picture. The Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate are part of General \nRelativity. GR has time symmetry. Everything in the opposite symmetry \nfundamentally violates the Laws of Thermodynamics (Time can't run in \nreverse, just as you cannot unmix ingredients). A reversal of time is \nreversing entropy, that's a no-no. GR is differomorphism invariant. We \nignore everything on the \"other side of time.\" because it's not really \nthere. General covariance is a product of physics, not reality.\n\nLet's go a step further. Ignore the general invariance of GR. According the \nthe coordinate system, the white hole and black hole are connected via a \nLorentzian wormhole existing at *about* the center. The problem is, it's \nmirrored on the other side. The entryways do not connect. So instead of \nhitching a ride to reverse-time land, you get trapped in the Schwartzchild \nbubble then smashed into and become one with the singularity. \nTheoretically, if it did exist, when you're inside the bubble, you should \nbe able to \"see\" the other universe through the wormhole.\n\nOne further, if the entries connected, the sheer amount of matter that \nwould need to be accreted is truly profane. The universe had a *whole* lot \nmore stuff in the beginning. We only exist thanks to the apparent baryon \nasymmetry. The universe started out with a whole lot more matter, but it \nannihilated with its antimatter counterparts. There was slightly more \nbaryonic matter than antibaryonic matter. If there was a balance, nothing \nwould exist except pure energy from everything annihilating. To the point, \nfor a whitehole to spit out enough energy to form a universe like ours, the \nsingularity need to be VASTLY more massive than 30 sexdecillion kilograms \n(That's a 30 with 51 zeros or 3e+52kg). That number is the estimated mass \nof the observable universe. The universe is probably many, many, many, \nmany, *many* times that size. I'm not going to say that's not possible. \nSize is relevant only to us. If there are other universes, ours could be \nmicroscopic in relation to another, just as our Sun is microscopic as \ncompared to other stars. There is no known fundamental limit to the mass of \nour universe given it is spread out enough so that it's not so dense that \nit surpasses the Schwartzchild radius and collapses into a black hole. To \ngive an example of said radius, if you take Earth and crunch it into a ball \nabout 8.8mm, gravity will take over and collapse it into a black hole.\n\nhttp://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schwp.html does a good job of explaining all \nof that about black holes and white holes and Schwartzchild geometry and \nwhatnot.\n\nTo the point of the video. I have a hard to believing it is a white hole. \nThat doesn't seem plausible to me. Why would it be where it is? Its \nlocation makes no sense. A long GRB where there is nothing capable of \nemitting such energy is strange but whiteholes are too far fetched. Quantum \nMechanics can pull off some truly, unique, for lack of a better word, \nthings. A GRB is nothing more than photons, so why not some sort of \nunfathomably low chance of an entire GRB from a supernova managing to \ntunnel via a gravitational wormhole from quantum entanglement out of the \nmess and into where it is? We know photons can mysteriously vanish and \nreappear literally anywhere (Calculable probability, quantum indeterminacy \nif I recall correctly), so I'd go for that or quantum entanglement before \nwhite holes.\n\nThere literally is more evidence to say it was a random quantum fluctuation \nthan to say it was a white hole and I don't like either answers. A quantum \nfluctuation of that magnitude? I don't think so. That's some seriously \ndoubtful odds. I don't think you could fit enough zeroes into the entire \nuniverse to show those odds. We're talking trillions upon trillions upon \ntrillions of photons, each being tunneled to the appropriate location. It \ncan happen but damn, them odds. If anybody would like to correct me on any \npoints, feel free. I'll admit, I don't know everything and I probably got a \nfew things wrong and damn, I wrote a lot more than I thought I did.",

Imagine \nwater, in a liquid state. before i start, understand that each of the three \nphases (gas, liquid, and solids) have an arrangement of atoms in them: in \nsolids the atoms don't move around and they pretty much stay in their \nposition, in liquid the atoms are more free and move around but still \nrestricted in a way, and in gas the atoms just go everywhere and fly \neverywhere and not held together. If we take water in a liquid form, the \natoms are moving around a little freely, when you freeze water and it \nbecomes solid ice, the atoms are restricted from their movements and and \ndon't move; they have more order, less disorder. If water is heated up to \ngas, the atoms are moving all around and become more free, the order they \nhad which restricted their movement a little is gone and thus the atoms \nbecame in a state of no order at all holding them done, they are \nexperiencing disorder. This is what he meant bu the analogy, the piano is a \nfixed structure with the wood all stuck together forced to be in a certain \nshape. If you chop it in a wood chipper, it loses this order and \nexperiences disorder. And so, as he states, you can take that wood and \nbuild anything, even another piano, because it is in such disorder the \nfragments are free to create anything basically, AS LONG AS IT IS THE SAME \nMASS, thus the entropy did not change. The reason it can't work backwards \nis because once you have a piano, you can't make anything out of the piano \nit's stuck that way. This is why, when referring back to water, the atoms \ncan become anything when they experience entropy, they can be solid as you \nadd more order and it can be gas as you add more disorder.

It doesn't have a configuration, it's a compact mass held \ntogether by gravity. Gravity is an attractive force, meaning that if you \ninject energy into a system operating gravitationally, it increases in \nsize. Anything outside of a black hole thus has more potential energy than \nit would were it inside, so, in accordance with the second law, energy will \ntend to spread out more evenly, moving particles from a higher energy state \nto the lower energy state inside a black hole.\n\nThe analogy of a black hole being a battery is actually somewhat accurate \nfor different reasons, however, and they have to do with quantum mechanics. \nHawking radiation slowly bleeds energy off of the surface of a black hole, \nbut even that operates in accordance with the second law. Energy wants to \nbe spread evenly in a homogeneous layer, a black hole is still a \nconcentration, so over time, they evaporate, creating a uniform cloud of \nenergy, at this point, we see heat death. There is zero usable energy in \nthe universe (or smaller system of the black hole) because it is \nhomogeneous, there is no gradient left for it to move across.

Of course, everything \nthat APPEARS to hold exactly COULD just be merely approximately true. \nKinetic energy is m*v^2/2 according to Newton, but \nm*v^2/(1-v^2/c^2+sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)) by Einstein, which is very, very close to \nm*v^2/2 for v much less than c, for instance. You're thinking that under \nextreme enough conditions, other things that seem to match observations \nunder conditions that have been observed could fail. Sure. And making undue \nassumptions is what scientists most try not to do, I believe. Or at least \nit should be. And when that happens, it's often a facepalm moment for the \nentire world, just like in 1905, when they realize it should have been \nsomething they saw all along. To that, I say, you can't just proudly \nproclaim \"everything you know is wrong, and the only true knowledge is that \nyou know nothing\" for so long. At some point, you're likely to get the \nright answers, or at least some of them. And maybe some of the answers that \nhave been produced already ARE the correct answers. Sure, assume as little \nas you can, but you're never going to get anywhere if you try to proceed \nwhile assuming nothing. It really is possible to have the right answer at \nsome point, as Einstein said, the universe is apparently comprehensible.\n\nAbout dark energy though - DOES it need an explanation in any sort of \nconceptual sense? I don't like how everyone's trying to come up for some \nCAUSE of it. Why can't it just be an inherent property of space? Like the \npermittivity of free space. Do we need an explanation for why the \npermittivity of free space is what it is, or can it just be what it is? \nThis is why I don't like calling it dark energy, I just call it the \ncosmological constant.",

So just because magic couldn't be \nexplained, doesn't mean it's something we couldn't observe working if it \nactually existed.\n\n\"a system... in which requires no effort from its creator in order to \nfunction and thrive\" This has literally been my point since the beginning, \nthank you for rehashing this for me. So how could you ever know anything \nabout this creator if its involvement is not reflected in the mechanics of \nour universe?\n\nActually, I know very thoroughly how gravity works, both equations along \nwith accompanying theory which I've already described. You, on the other \nhand, don't appear to *know* much of anything about the natural universe, \nbut rather seem fond of asserting conjecture about god in whatever subject \nyou think we're ignorant about. \"for all you know god actively makes it \nwork through, well heck magic\"\nAlthough late, and with the highest degree of irony... you are very \ncorrect! Conjecture and possibility do not affect reality. We can only \nrationally assert that our conjecture is reality when *all of the best \navailable evidence points in that direction.* The only one violating this \nvery natural, obvious principal of reasoning is you, however. You're the \none bringing up magic and god, then postulating how they both go hand in \nhand making the universe, white holes, and morality exist without any \nsubstantiation. I'm the one trying to ground your fantasy to observable \nreality. ",

You may not be able to interact with god but he has \ninvolved himself in my life.  I compared god to sand because you've been \nconsumed with asking how god was necessary when an existence isn't.  I am \nentertained by the fact that inspite of the pinnacle of scientific creation \nis a system (weather by gears electronics or other) in which requires no \neffort from its creator in order to function and thrive.  it would not need \nparts changed or updates, and yet you still pose the question what use is a \ngod if he doesnt do anything?  What more amusing is that you have no idea \nhow gravity works and only that it does.  for all you know god actively \nmakes it work through, well heck magic.  Since magic exists outside of \nscience (we are just assuming it does because scientifically magic doesnt \nexist inspite of the fact that magic could be the source of gravity) and \ngod works through magic, you wouldnt ever understand anything he does \nexcept by chalking everything up to happen-stance. \n\nNo i seriously think you missed the point.  you want to talk of \npossibilities like its a game of cards.  In a deck of cards there is either \nan ace of spades or there isnt.  Before looking at the deck there exists \nthe possibility of an ace in the deck but the possibility doesn't change \nwhat is and what isnt.\n\nAnd since we keep using it i say gravity is my proof of god.  The \"white \nhole\" was started by god.  Disprove it.  Bear in mind regardless of \nwhatever laughable proof you try to come up with, i will not be responding.",

I don't see how you're doing anything other than \nadding an unnecessary assumption.\n\nPrisoners are a really bad example. There are no public statistics on \nreform catalyzed by religion for inmates, which leaves it in the realm of \nanecdote. AA and NA might be a better example of religious reform which is \nactually monitored and controlled, at a meager 5-10% success rate.\n \nYou make a habit of missing the point. When you suggest something is \n\"possible\" your ideas ought to be contingent on some recognizable, \nagreeable reality. \nWe *observe* things fall to earth at 9.8m/s^2 and explain this using \npredictive equations we label \"gravity\", and therefore can reasonably say \nit's *possible* that perturbations in spacetime transfer force between \nindividual masses. There is nothing which resides in the remotest \nresemblance of this substantiation for your idea of god.\nIf you're starting with more than just assumptions, you have some real, \nobservable phenomenon which is explained only by an idea of god which is \nthoroughly understood and clearly defined; hence \"necessary\".\nSince god neither provides explanatory power for what you've used it to \nexplain, nor has any coherent or consistent definition it is nonsensical to \nassert that belief and non-belief are equally rational.",

Heat/radiation can still be used to do work as long as \nyou have a temperature differential somewhere in the \"system\".\nFor example that \"waste\" heat could be used to heat water to steam and then \ndrive a turbine.\nBut if all the energy in the world was converted to heat, and everywhere \nwas the *same temperature*, then the heat would be useless.\nAnd that's where the \"number of states vs total number of possible states\" \ndefinition of entropy comes into play, rephrasing the second law of \nthermodynamics: You can only ever go from a state with a lower number of \npossible states to one with a higher number.\nFor example: Ice cubes. There are significantly fewer ways water molecules \ncan be arranged so that they form a crystalline structure than a liquid, so \nif you put ice cubes in a perfectly insulated container with some room \ntemperature water, over time the ice cubes will always melt, averaging the \ntemperature of the water in the container. The reverse will never happen, \nthat a lukewarm pool of water will separate into one part boiling water and \nanother part that is frozen with the average temperature remaining the same.",

It's waaay more likely \nfor a piano to turn into woodchips than woodchips to turn into a piano.  \nBecause it's more likely, it happens more often, and so nature is slowly \nincreasing in entropy.  So you CAN decrease entropy on a small scale, but \non the large scale it will always increase.  That law really applies only \nto the overall state of things, individual events can violate it.\n\nI should also add that the law only applies to closed systems, which are \nsystems with no outside influences.  For example, a piano in a sealed box \nwill slowly deteriorate into rotted woodchips, and it will never turn back \ninto a piano.  Entropy has increased in this closed system, and it can't \ndecrease.  However, if you opened the box, which would make it no longer a \nclosed system, you could reconstruct the piano.  The Universe is a closed \nsystem, so entropy decreases for it.",

Entropy goes by the logarithm \nof the number of microstates (a possible configuration of the system, i.e. \nthis particle is at position x, that particle is in position y, etc.) \nresulting in the same macrostate (in this case, the white hole). But the \nnumber of microstates goes by the factorial of the number of particles in \nthe system. Considering there are (very roughly) 10^58 particles in the \nsun, and black holes form from stars much bigger than the sun, the number \nof possible states is on the order of (10^58)! where the exclamation point \ndenotes the factorial. This means (1 followed by 58 zeroes) times (57 9's) \ntimes (56 9's followed by an 8) times (56 9's followed by a 7) and so on. \nFactorials grow extremely fast. So fast, in fact, that the number (10^58)! \nis so large that if you were to write it out in \"long form,\" with say, font \nsize 10, the number would be substantially longer than the diameter of the \nobservable universe.\nI'm jut saying, if you're going to say \"it's possible\" then yeah, it's \ndefinitely possible. But it's not going to happen. :(\nIt's actually far more likely that 6 billion people on the earth would \nsimultaneously begin suffocating because air is only 21% oxygen and it's \nentirely possible that the random collision of atoms surrounding their head \nwould bounce all of the oxygen molecules away from them, even though I can \nsafely say from pure probabilities that such a thing has never happened to \nanyone.

Ah, Einsteins Theory of relativity... \nthe bit regarding light... and speed... where is it... uh.. Ah! here it is!\n\n(Not direct quote, cause I can't be bothered to do that much effort just to \nprove someone wrong)\n\n\"As an object's speed increases, the time and distance it travels decreases \nproportionally, and vice versa. If the speed were to decrease, the time and \ndistance it would have to travel would subsequently increase.\"\n\nExample/fact to back this statement up? Let's chalk one up real quick:\n\nThe Muons particle that is generated when the solar rays collide with our \natmosphere is rushing to Earth's surface, the half-life of the particle is \nmuch shorter than the time it would take for the particle to reach the \nEarth's surface. However, because it is traveling at .99999999991% the \nspeed of light, it reaches the Earth's surface faster, and in a shorter \namount of time.\n\nTo the *perspective* of the Muons particle, the Earth would appear to be a \ndisc. Approximately 14meters in thickness.\n\n/watch?v=VNqNnUJVcVs\n\nDistance and time, my dear Watson, are based on perspective... And special \nrelativity.\n\nIf you believe in the multi-verse theory, which is a load of bs, then that \nalso explains this \"increase in space\" through the same theory, because our \n\"verse\" (Not uni, now is it) is subsequently slowing down.\n\nAnother great example (cause I have no life)\n\nHow far did Usain Bolt really run in the 100 meter dash? He sure didn't run \n100 meters... He ran more like 99.999999999999999999991 meters.\n\n/watch?v=tflf05x-WVI\n\nSo can the universe truly slow down? Can everything be slowing down? Well \nit sure can't be speeding up, thermodynamics can't have that.\n\n1: You have to play the game of Thermodynamics (You can't take energy out \nof the system)\n\n2: You can never win Thermodynamics (You *always* lose *more* energy than \nyou can ever gain)\n\n3: You may break even (That silly idea of a Zero-Point Generator is a load \nof arse)\n\n(The hidden rule: You really can't)\n\nAs for that bit you said regarding black holes... It's more than just \nincredible.\n\nIt's bloody infinite.\n\nNo really, it is.\n\nA singularity, which is more the object in question, because a black hole \nis just what we see, but is, in fact, caused by the singularity, is a point \nin space where the volume-to-mass ratio fell out-of-wack... and it became \ninfinitely dense (essentially, anything can become a singularity... if it \nbecame compressed enough).\n\nAnd one last correction; the space next to the black hole is not empty \n(Because the singularity is within the Event Horizon, I will return to term \n\"Black Hole\"), it's filled with Hawking Radiation... a type of radiation \nthat is... leaked from the black hole because it of laws of relativity and \nwhat not.\n\n(This last bit is speculation)\n\nWith the loss of Hawking Radiation, it is possible, that given an *extreme* \namount of time, a black hole could lose enough to mass to sustain itself, \neffectively causing the singularity that had been growing to suddenly \nexplode because it doesn't have the gravitational pull to keep itself \ncompressed.",

                    "text": "+fattony638 Well it's sort of my own little theory, i like to theorise and \nsuch. So you imagine infinity as something going on forever, since that's \nwhat an infinity is right? but also try theoretically seeing it as \nsomething that has a set size, sort-of like light can be both a particle \n[photon] and a wave at the same time. So imagine there are different orders \nand sizes of infinity, \"plack infinity\" like there is plack length and \nplack time, etc. And also if you count every value in said infinity, you \nwouldn't be able to count it, but let's say you combine two of those \"plack \ninfinities\". It's still an infinity, but logically speaking, by adding two \n equally, or non equally sized sets of objects together you'll get a larger \nset of objects? right it makes sense? So why not apply the same for \ninfinity?\n\nIf i use my previous example if you count from 0 to 2 without decimals and \nyou count 1 number every second it would take you two seconds. The same \napplies if you would count from 2 to 4 it would also take 2 seconds. but to \ncount from 0 to 4 it would take 4 seconds. So that proves that the distance \nbetween 0 and 2 is the same as the distance between 2 and 4 and that the \ndistance from 0 and 4 is twice as large as both the distance from 0 and 2 \nand 2 and 4. So what if we fill in the blancs? Add all decimals between 0 \nand 2 and do the same with the ones between 2 and 4. Since the distance \nbetween them is the same, the number of decimals in that interval would \nalso be the same? Right? .\n\nLike if you just add the 1/10 decimals there are 20 of those between 0 and \n2 [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, \n1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.0 ], the same goes for the 1/10 decimals \nbetween 2 and 4 [2.1, .2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, \n3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 4.0]. and if you count from 0 to 4 \nincluding all the 1/10 decimals you would have double the amount [10 + 10 = \n20/ 10*2 = 20], thus \"0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 \n1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, .2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, \n2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and \n4.0\".\n\nSo try seeing an infinity as  the way you see finite numbers, add all other \ndecimals in-between 0 and 2 and do the same with the interval between 2 and \n4, the same correlation should still remain, since the \"space\" between them \nis identically large, but the amount of real decimals between any given set \nof finite numbers is infinite. so both the interval between 0 and 2 and 2 \nand 4 are of the same size [as i proved earlier in the message] so the \namount of real decimals aka finite real numbers that fit between them \ninfinite. However if you add them together, as you saw in my example of \nfinite numbers the space doubles, and if you add these equally sized \ninfinities together they should theoretically double in size. It would be \nillogical if the distance between two points and to points further away \nwould be the same. \n\nI hope you understand how i'm thinking here",

So that's why I asked about the intervals' cardinalities; \nyou need to know them to order them.\n\nI'm not aware of a theory other than set theory in mathematics which allows \nfor different sizes of infinity. I'm genuinely interested to know about the \none you seem to be referring to.",
