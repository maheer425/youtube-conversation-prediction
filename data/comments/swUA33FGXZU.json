Don't you dare falsely label me as some \npropagandist just so you could cover up your mistakes instead of \nrationalizing what the topic is about. We did not and I repeat, DID NOT put \nnuclear missiles in Turkey to threaten the Soviet Union. We did that in \nself-defense in case of an imminent nuclear attack, as we have every right \nto be. It was the Soviet Union that felt threatened by such presence, not \nthe other way around. While the Soviets did have a right to send its \nsupplies and material to support their ally, Cuba, what made this so \nspecial is that Cuba was such an unstable nation due to its communist \npolicies which often lead to nations being very unstable, as we seen in \nNorth Korea and the Soviet Union. You cannot compare the political systems \nin the United States in the same tone as the ones in Cuba -- that's just \nnot right and that demonstrates lack of critical thinking on your part.\n \nAnd I never said Iran could nuclear strike Israel by themselves, but due to \ntheir terrorist funding for decades, they might give half of their nuclear \nmaterials and information to terrorists in hopes they could use their full \nknowledge to construct such weapons and thereby would have a major impact \nin the Middle East. Terrorists are not rational people and they do whatever \nthey think they please, regardless of whether Iran rejects their plan to \ncarry out their attacks or not. The Iranians claim their nuclear research \nis for peaceful use, but they never routinely cooperate with UN inspectors. \nWhat does that say about Iran?\n \nAnd wanting me to prove that North Korean leaders are psychopaths, you \nmight want to check their human rights records online and their threats to \nthe U.S. and South Korea so you could brush up your memory and not be \nextremely ignorant. There is no justification for the North Koreans to get \ntheir hands on nuclear weapons to the point it would threaten South Korea \nand Japan, their next-door neighbors and thereby increasing tensions in the \nregion. Do you think a psychopathic murderer should have a right to own \naccess to firearms? Anyone with a complete rational sense would say no.\n ",

Unstable nations that are led by \nmaniacs in charge are more prone to misuse nuclear weapons to the point \nthey wouldn't think of potential consequences of nuclear-armed exchange. In \naddition, big nations like Russia and China -- which we consider them to be \nunfriendly to our interests -- have nuclear warheads too so we don't want \nto lose our bet with them and let others take advantage of our weaknesses.\n\nAlso, because of the flawed application in our isolationist policy \nfollowing World War II, we had to be proactive to prevent another world \nwar, as the Soviet Union started imposing and installing communism around \nthe world, thus ushering the Cold War (until it ended in 1991). The Korean \nWar, the 1991 Gulf War, the Bosnian War, Kosovo War, and the Afghanistan -- \nnone of them which are started by the U.S. -- are justifiable U.S. \nconflicts.\n\nThat said, I agree our foreign policy since World War II (most of them in \nthe Cold War era) is bad, but that doesn't mean Iran and North Korea aren't \ncrazy nations. Iran is giving money to terrorist organizations (e.g., the \nHamas and the Hezbollah) that killed thousands of innocents and producing \nnuclear materials so they could use them towards building nukes in \nviolation of the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (which Iran is in \nfact a party to) and thus putting other nations in the Middle East and the \nrest of the world at risk of World War III, whether now or in the future. \nNorth Korea is still testing its nukes and is potentially capable of \ndestablizing South Korea and possibly launch such weapons against that \nnation or Japan, once they get their hands on their nukes whether in a \nstate of continued hostilities or not.\n\nAs for Hiroshima and Nagasaki being nuked without military value, you're \ndead wrong.

It's nothing but a \ntypical \"blame America\" crowd that gives you right to blame everything on \nus, let alone to the point of exaggerating facts to the point it became \nsomething that it shouldn't, some of which you believe what anti-Americans \nsay so you take them as source rather than looking into sources that \ncontained factual evidences.\n\nIran got caught violating article 3 of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty \nin 2003, when they were caught enriching uranium in unreported locations, \nand still has not allowed access to the sites the IAEA want to visit.\nThe issue has been of international concern since the discovery in 2003 \nthat Iran had concealed its nuclear activities for 18 years in breach of \nits obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). \nhttp://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37697&Cr=nuclear&Cr1#.VT0iS5NmpME\n\nEvery IAEA report from 2003-2014, summaries are generally on the last page. \nIran has been found in non-compliance with its safeguard agreement with the \nIAEA.\nhttp://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iaeairan/iaea_reports.shtml\nIAEA report Feb 25 2011\nPage 12 has unanswered IAEA questions that Iran must answer to comply fact\nhttp://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2011/gov2011-7.pdf\n\nIran stalls probe into nuclear weapons research\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/07/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKBN0IR1DJ20141107\n\nSome of the materials that Iran used are clearly designed for nuclear \nweapons despite claims that Iran tried to use them for peaceful purposes \nwhich made them completely liars and distrusted.\nhttp://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf\n\nFor possible military dementions see pages 11-22 (annex)\nhttp://www.isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/IAEA_Iran_8Nov2011.pdf\n\nAnd it is a fact Iran is defying 6 UN Security Council Resolutions since \nIran got caught violating UN security council resolution 1696\nwww.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8792.doc.htm\nUN Security Council Resolution 1737\nhttp://www.un.org/press/en/2006/sc8928.doc.htm\nUN Security Council Resolution 1747\nUN Security Council Resolution 1803\nhttp://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9268.doc.htm\nUN Security Council Resolution 1835\nhttp://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9459.doc.htm\nUN Security Council Resolution 1929\nhttp://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc9948.doc.htm\n\nThese facts speaks for themselves and if you say what's true about Iran's \nnuclear weapons, then the UN and the IAEA wouldn't resort passing these \nmeasures or issuing the reports, but no, you rather blame on others for \nyour own downfall comings, like a bully blaming on others, rather than \nperpetrating on himself. Your refusal to recognize these facts is utterly \nembarrassing and nothing short but a desperate attempt to save face by \nresorting to lying or exaggerating facts in order to slander a country \nrather than arguing on factual basis. You're not only stupid, it makes you \nlook just as bad as saying the Holocaust is a lie or that 9/11 is a \nconspiracy and therefore makes you look like a lunatic.\n\nIf you are not willing to admit all the facts that Iran or other nations \nhave done to others, rather than solely the United States, then you have \nnothing to criticize the United States, period.",

Israel has been saying that Iran \nis a year away from having nukes since 1992!!!! Why would Iran claim that \ntheir program is pacific and then threaten others with nukes, its dumb and \nthat never happened. There is no real proof that Iran is building a bomb, \nand by the way, do you even watch the news!!? American senators and most of \nthe republicans are saying \"WE SHOULD NUKE IRAN\" everyday! And yet you are \nso hypocrite that first you say that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were \nthe best option, even though the second Bomb was a day later and that one \nwas thrown just to test your plutonium bomb, out of PURE EVIL towards the \nJapanese. And now you are threatening everyday to nuke Iran. When has Iran \nthreatened another country with nukes? \nBy the way, Iran has also signed the \"Non proliferation of nuclear weapons\" \nor \"NPT\" treaty which gives them the right to have a pacific nuclear \nprogram, but the world isn\u00b4t fair and because the US doesn\u00b4t like the fact \nthat Iran doesn\u00b4t sell their oil to them, they don\u00b4t want Iran to have a \npacific program being the only country that has signed the treaty but is \ndiscriminated. \nDon\u00b4t be so hypocrite towards others because the US sponsored a 8 year \nchemical war against Iran using weapons that are considered to be war \ncrimes using their proxi and ally Irak with Saddam Hussain as their leader \n(YEAH, A PARADOX). So don\u00b4t be so condescending, \n\nIf you are not willing to admit all the harm that the US has done to the \nworld, then you have nothing to criticize to others. The US will never \nchange unless they accept their crimes without using ridiculous excuses \nlike, \"the world have no right to tell us how bad we are when they did much \nmore atrocities than us. We used the nuclear bombs in 1945 because it was a \nnew technology and nobody knew the effects of such weapons and there was no \nother country that holds possession of nuclear weapons other than us.\" or \n\"the nuclear bomb actually saved more american and japanese lives\" (yeah, I \nheard that one from many people actually)",

Why should Japanese \npeople be allowed to live in Japan? Why should Arabs be allowed to live in \nSaudi Arabia? Why should Indians be allowed to live in India?\n\nIf you say something so unbelievably stupid, expect a stupid response. \n\nThe genetic makeup of Palestinians, according to most studies, are as \nfollowers: \n\nA substantial chunk of Palestinians are the descendants of Jews who were \nforcefully converted to Islam when the Arabs concurred the land in the 7th \ncentury. The rest of them are either Egyptian, Turkish or Arab imperialist.\n\nThe 1947 resolution mapped two states. One for Jews, and one for \nPalestinians. The Palestinian state not only included the West Bank, Gaza, \nJaffa, East Jerusalem and large parts of Northern, Eastern and Southwestern \nIsrael, including all the Arab cities in the North. The Jews agreed to this \nresolution, but the Arabs denied it in favor of war and launched an assault \non Israel a year later. \n\nThe day Israel was founded. Everyone, whether Jewish, Muslim, Druze or \nChristian was granted immediate Israeli citizenship. You know what drove \nthe Palestinians from their homes? The 1948 war that Arab countries \nstarted. Everyone was displaced, Jews, Druze, Bedouins, etc. Not just \nPalestinians.\n\nNever in history has there ever been a state, nation, empire or sovereign \nnation called \"Palestine\". For 2000 years it was, on and off, the \nindependent Jewish kingdom of Judea. \n\nPalestinians are a fake ethnicity. The term didn't even exist until the \nearly 20th century, in the height of the Second Aliyah, and it only came to \nbe because the Arabs hated Jewish self-determination. There wasn't even a \nPalestinian leader until Yassir Arafat, and he wasn't even Palestinian. He \nwas Egyptian, born and raised in Cairo.\n\nIt's funny, that for the whole 2000 years of the Jewish diaspora, the Arabs \nnever once cared about having a Palestinian state or even called themselves \nPalestinian. But as soon as the Jews start taking back what's rightfully \ntheirs, the Arabs get upset and want a state.\n\nThe Palestinians have been offered a state both formally (3 times) and \ninformally time and time again since the 1920's, and every single time they \nsay no. If they want to blame anyone for the denial of their own self \ndetermination, it's their own terrorist, Jew-hating, misogynistic, \nhomophobic, barbaric leaders.\n\nThe majority of the world stands with Israel, either indirectly or \ndirectly, especially developed countries. They maintain diplomatic \nrelations and trading agreements with Israel. There is also the fact that \nmost of the world is dependent on Israeli computer, technological and \nindustrial industries. Check the microchip in your computer.\n\nA good chunk of European countries recognize Palestinian self \ndetermination, in the sense that they support the 2 state solution. But I \ndon't know how you twist that into the \"world\" turning \"against\" Israel. \nWhen even Muslim countries like Jordan, Egypt, Bosnia, Albania, Azerbaijan \nand Turkey maintain relatively good relations with Israel. Israel exist and \nit's not going anywhere anytime soon, deal with it. ",

If you want to see \nthe truth about Zionism and Israel. I can show it to you. Most Zionist Jews \nare Europeans and most of the ones who live in Israel are mostly \nGerman,Russian,Ukrainian,Polish,Hungarian and Austrian immigrants. ",

They \ndid over the summer, they did during second intifada, they've done it since \ntheir inception. You didn't answer my question. If Hamas stations \nthemselves, purposely, amougst civilians, and violates cease fires by \nattacking Israel first, what is Israel suppose to do? Just ignore it? What \nwould you do? \n\nYou seem to conveniently ignore the fact that Israel tries heavily to avoid \nthe deaths of civilians, regardless of who they are. They air drop \nevacuation flyers, they supply Gaza with electricity, food, water, \nmedicine, exports, etc. They set up border crossings and try to negotiate \nwithout resorting to violence. \n\nThe Star of David is the universal symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity. \nJust like the cross is to Christianity, and the crescent moon is to Islam.\n\nZionism was proposed and started by Theador Herzl. He was actually an \natheist. Zionism has existed for as long as Jews have been exiled, but he \nwas the one who started it. \n\nThere are some Jews who oppose a lot of what the Israeli government does. \nJust like their are a lot of Americans who don't like what their government \ndoes, and a lot of Italians who don't like the EU. Israelis disagree, \namougst themselves, on settlements, on issues in Gaza, on the two state \nsolution, etc. Just like any other country.\n\nAside from our political disagreements. I'm just curious, where are you \nfrom? Have you ever met a Jewish person? and have you ever visited Israel?",

But before that, I \nwant to address two things.\n\n1.) I find it amusing how you think you can out smart me on my own \nreligion. \n\n2.) History has demonstrated, again and again and without failure, that \nthere needs to be a Jewish state. There needs to a Kurdish state and \nAssyrian state, and a Catalan state, but there is no scripture regarding \nthat, but it is true nonetheless. I don't care about scripture in a literal \nsense, most Zionist leaders, such as Ben-Gurion and Theador Herzl, where \natheist anyway. But just for the heck of it, here it is:\n\nEzekiel 11:17 \u201cTell them, \u2018The Lord and King says, \u201cI will gather you from \nthe nations. I will bring you back from the countries where you have been \nscattered. I will give you back the land of Israel.\u201d \u2019\n\nDeuteronomy 30:4-5: \"Even if you have been banished to the most distant \nland under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and \nbring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your \nancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more \nprosperous and numerous than your ancestors.\"\n\nThe Torah, which is apart of all Abrahamic religions in one form or \nanother, is loaded with verses regarding aliyah (Jewish return to our \nhistorical homeland). Sure, it doesn't say \"there should be an independent \nJewish country\". Except there is just one problem. There is a independent \nJewish country. Voted on by the United Nations in November of 1947 and \nindependent since 1948. That country is called Israel, and I'm pretty sure \nits not going anywhere anytime soon, so you'll just have to learn to accept \nthat.\n\nThe Talmud is the oral torah. It is more so an interpretation of the \ndifficult language of scripture. It isn't a religious text, it was written \nby Rabbi's, over the course of several hundred years, debating on how a \nJewish person should live. For example, does Judaism forbid piercings? Can \na Jew intermarry? That sort of thing. ",

I doubt even more that you know the history of the idea, \nIsrael, the Jewish people, Palestine, etc. \n\nIsrael pulled out of Gaza in 2005. For the sake of peace. And what \nhappened? The Palestinians elected a theocratic, totalitarian terrorist \ngroup, Hamas, that is yet to hold second elections. Gaza plunged into a \ncivil war after Israel left. A war that killed hundreds of Palestinians, \nbut anti-Zionist and Muslims don't talk, nor care, about that. They only \nget upset when it's convenient for them, in other words, when they can \nblame the Jews and get away with it.\n\nGaza was bombed because Hamas fired over 2000 rockets over the course of \nseven days into Southern Israel, and planned a massacre on Rosh Hashanah. \nIsrael gave them several ultimatums, and Hamas, as always, broke every \nsingle one.\n\nWhat is Israel left to do in that case? When Hamas breaks every single \ncease fire Israel has to offer, and purposely stations themselves in \nlargely populated areas, then Israel has, more or less, no options.
