The most common misunderstanding of type 2 diabetes is that if a \nperson never eats any sweets/sugar/carbs that they will be \"cured\". That is \nnot the case! In a non-diabetic person food is turned into glucose, \ndelivered along with insulin to the cells, the insulin unlocks the door and \nthe glucose delivers the energy, etc. for the cells to work properly. Type \n1 diabetics' bodies do no produce the insulin, so the cells aren't unlocked \nat all. Type 2 diabetics' bodies produce insulin, but their cells don't \nrecognize the insulin properly so the cells may or may not unlock. Over \ntime, Type 2 diabetics might find their body no longer produces insulin or \nenough insulin and they require shots/pump. \n\nPersonally, I am thrilled that more research is currently happening \nregarding type 2 diabetes and our food sources.

There's type 1 diabetes and then there's type 2. \nHere's a definition of both that I found on Mayo Clinic: Type 1 diabetes, \nonce known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic \ncondition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone \nneeded to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. The far \nmore common type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to \ninsulin or doesn't make enough insulin.\n\nI think it depends on how extreme the case is that determines if you need \nto take insulin, but don't quote me on that. I'm unsure.",
