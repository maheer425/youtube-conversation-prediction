It would be less likely to deform and get \nstuck in the valve, and it also wouldn't turn so that air could flow past \nthe flat side. Fluid actually flows better around a round ball, doesn't it?\n\nYou must have gotten a very good deal on those PVC adapters because they \nnormally go for about the same as you're quoting for the whole project. Did \nyou find a 2 for 1 sale somewhere? And of course you also have to have some \nacrylic balls of exactly the right size in your spare parts bin, and a hunk \nPVC pipe you can cut a couple of inches off of. You'll also have to have \nsome leftover PVC glue and primer. A more realistic price would be $3.50 \nthan $.35.\ufeff",

He is making a bunch of them so if you can \nsource enough material at the right price that's certainly possible. The \n3/4 inch balls I linked two are sold in packs of 10@ $0.81 a dollar which \nmakes the final cost on those $8.10. Even if the price per check valve came \nout to $2 a piece I think that's still rather cheap.\n\nIn fact, I just did some pricing and it look like you can pull these \ntogether for just under $2 a piece which is quite cheap.10 acrylic balls @ \n$8.10\n20 3/4\" male PVC slip adapters @ $5.20\n10 3/4\" rubber o-rings @ $4.90\n24 inches of 3/4\" sch 40 PVC pipe @ 1.42\n\n\nAltogether that's $19.62 in my area and since we are making 10 of them \nthat's an individual cost of just under $2.\n\n\nI think that meets the \"for cheap\" definition.",

I'd slam it once, \nsee if I could breathe through, slam again, do a breathe test. I basically \nkept slamming till it took a bit of pressure to blow through the torch \nhead. \n\nHowever, with further testing I've found out that the way I shut off the \ntorch seems to be the main problem.\n\nWhen I shut the torch off, I slowly turn the knob off. And that seems to \nhave been the issue. Now I engraved a mark on the knob with my dremel. So I \nslowly close the knob on the torch, but I know after that \"dash\" I need to \nQUICKLY shut the valve. As in, I jerk my wrist as quickly as possible and \nnow it seems like flashbacks have stopped completely.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is you really need to be QUICK with the valve. \nIf I'm just a teeny bit slow I'll get a flashback. I'm new to this whole \nHHO thing and still can't get over how fast this gas burns. It's not even \nlike a \"burn\". It almost seems like the gas \"detonates\" if that makes sense.",
