Saint Ives apricot scrub is one of the worst products because \nthe crystals and seeds it has in it actually make tiny abrasions on your \nskin causing you to be more susceptible to not only infection but also it \ncan spread the acne bacteria around cause more break outs if not worse \nones. May I suggest something that has salicylic acid in it. Stick with \nsomething like clean and clear if you want to go on the cheaper end. \n\ufeff",
