You\u2019ll see that there\u2019s NO such predictable \ncorrelation between the top tax rate and economic growth factors such as \nGDP, wage and job growth. In fact, contrary to what many supporters for \nTrickle Down Economics suggests, some of the United States biggest economic \ngains took place during a *70%* and *91%* top tax rate and the some of the \ngreatest periods of stagnation occurred during the lowest top tax rate. I \nhave so much data on this. \nSimple math numbers showing this.

I have so much \ndocumentation on this from various sources  RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT OF CENTER, \nRIGHT OF CENTER up the ying yang  that i can fill my local Library. I \nactually did a thesis paper on this some years ago. LOL Never worked the \nway they tried to sell it. Never did. There is so much data on this its \nalmost blinding. \nSo many factors OTHER then Trickle Down economics also contributed to that \nprosperous era. Trickle Down Economics was not the main contributor at all. \nRegardless, it's difficult to say whether trickle-down economics was the \nonly reason for the prosperity during the 1980's because of Ronald Reagan's \nover spending. While Reagan cut taxes, he also increased government \nspending by 2.5% a year. Reagan nearly tripled the Federal debt, which went \nfrom $997 billion in 1981 to $2.85 trillion in 1989. He also increased the \nsize of the Government. Which by today's GOP standards would have never \nseen him leading the party as the GOP keeps stating smaller government and \nNO over sending causing Federal Debt. Ya..Right\nMoreover, this spending went primarily to defense, in support of Reagan's \nsuccessful efforts to end the Cold War and bring down the Soviet Union. \nTherefore, trickle-down economics was never really tested, since government \nspending is also a spur to economic growth as you know.\nThe main demographics that prospered from this form of \"Supply Side \nEconomics\" were the rich and wealthy. There is so much documentation and \nproof on this it's STAGGERING. The only people left BELIEVING it worked are \nthe very ones who PROFITED fully from it. \n\n*\"The Republican Party has totally abdicated its job in our democracy, \nwhich is to act as the guardian of fiscal discipline and responsibility. \nThey're on an anti-tax jihad -- one that benefits the prosperous classes.\"*\nThat was stated by David Stockman\nHe also goes on to state how Trickle Down Economics did not work. The very \nman who was Ronald Reagan's Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nwho orchestrated Trickle Down Economics for that Administration.\n\nhttp://nomadicpolitics.blogspot.ca/2012/10/the-incredible-hoax-of-reaganomics_4.html\n\nhttp://billmoyers.com/content/david-stockman-on-the-folly-of-anti-tax-crusades/\n\nhttp://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/11/07/reagan-budget-chief-slams-gop-taxes/\n\nhttp://rationalrevolution.net/war/trickle_down.htm\n\nhttp://www.faireconomy.org/research/TrickleDown.html\n\n\n*\u201cTriumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed.\u201d  The reason: no \none at the time, Republican or Democrat, was willing to cut spending, and \nif you cut taxes, you must cut spending.

Compound this with the current interest rates and the \nonly people benefiting are the top 10% who own the stock-market.\n\nEverybody is too focused on tax-cuts, when in reality the current \ngovernment economic plan is to pretty much stimulate the stock market. If \nanyone does the math, it's pretty simple to see that the people who benefit \nthe most from this are people who own stock. \"Trickle down economics\" \nindeed.",

So we all \nbenefit. As for the banks...People are always going to need loans for big \npurchases such as cars and houses so they will still get lots of interest \nand they will probably make out better in the end because they won't have \nso many people defaulting on their mortgage/loans.\n\nBottom line is \"Trickle down\" is just greedy and obviously hasn't worked \nfor us.
