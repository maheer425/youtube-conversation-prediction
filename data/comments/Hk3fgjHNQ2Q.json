Quantum physicists \nare basically working in the dark with no idea of what could be going \ndeeper. As they analyse the data, they surely mess up/ fudge the data and \nsubconsciously make 'corrections' attempting to fit the data to their \nimaginations.

Just like how your crowd claims computers as \nproof of quantum physics and GPS as proof of relativity, the believers of \nGod may claim the same as proof of existence of God. It may be true that it \nis your religious crowd who have actually invented and produced those funny \ngadgets and hence may want to solely get the credit. But the believers of \nGod have a logical argument \u2013 it is actually God who created everything in \nthis world including your religious crowd. So whatever your religious crowd \ninvents and produces, the credit must go to the God in the first place. So \ncomputers and GPS actually prove the existence of God before they prove \nyour stupid religion.\n\nAncient humans were able to accurately predict the occurrence of solar and \nlunar eclipses despite their weird reasoning and understanding of why an \neclipse occurs. And ancient physicians had successfully treated many \ndiseases despite their poor understanding of the actual diseases and the \npathophysiology.\n\nFinally just because a farm worker manages to produce eggs from hens, and \ngrows paddy from the fields, it doesn\u2019t mean that he knows everything about \nthe creation. To do those things he only requires a superficial knowledge \nof them. And same is the case with the \u2018cultivators\u2019 of your religion \u2013 \nthey simply make use of some superficial knowledge to make your computers, \nGPS and other gadgets.

But thsi \nstronger movement causes the electrons to jump into higher energystates. It \nuses enrgy from the bouncing around of the object. But it doesnt work the \nother way around. You can have a cold atom and have its electrons in a very \nhigh state of energy. They wont speed up the atom but will just send out \nlight (in verious frequencys). Does this make it clearer?",

The same thing goes the othwer way, if i heat a crystal and \nits atoms wiggle around a bit more, or if i heat a gas and the kinetic \nenergy of its atoms inrease, was it due to electrons jumping to higher \nstates?",
