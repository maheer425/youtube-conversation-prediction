                    "text": "+Kenneth King Hi Kenneth,  I usually don't join in on the comments for \nreligious discussions. I enjoy having face to face discussions with people \nabout this kind of thing, but when it's done in writing it usually becomes \na time consuming and ultimately useless exercise. However, I did want to \nmake the effort to contact you to say that although I disagree with you on \nreligious matters I can still admire your approach to communicating.  You \ndon't change your tone to match the negativity of someone who gets overly \nemotional or attacks you or your beliefs and I think that is all too rare. \nI am not in some position of superiority that enables me to say 'Well done' \nto you, but I would like to offer a 'Well done' anyway, within the spirit \nof friendliness and appreciation.  You seem to be trying to embody the \npositive aspects of your religious text and I find that admirable. \nAt the same time, I must say that there are many who are not doing what you \ndo, and that is, from my perspective, the problem with religious texts.\n+Aumish is correct in saying that the actions of WBC are justified within \none interpretation of the bible. Southern American slave owners defended \nthe morality of the institution of slavery based on actual biblical text as \nwell. Ever since the Reformation anyone is free to interpret scripture as \nthey see fit, as well as to pick and choose what parts to pay attention to \nand what parts to ignore. You only have to look at the thousands of \ndifferent Christian denominations to see that there is no accepted \nauthority on the 'correct' interpretation of the Bible. It seems to me, as \nI believe one of them said in the video, that sacred texts like the Torah, \nthe Bible, the Quran etc. can be, and are, used to justify what a person or \ngroup Already Believes, good or bad, and then those beliefs become \nunassailable because they are 'The Sacred Word Of God', allowing religious \nbelief to be a source of great sorrow and grief at the same time as being a \nsource of love and life.\nAnyway, regardless of whether you respond or not, or what your response \nmight be, let me finnish up in the same spirit as I began, by saying Stay \nPositive. Humanity needs all the positivity it can get. I wish you and the \nones you love a good, healthy and fulfilling life.",

                "text": "I find it very interesting when people who don't read the bible or obey the \nWord of God, want to talk about the message of the bible and what it says. \nWhile I do agree that WBC lacks compassion and their message is out of \nbalance because they don't tell people how to be reconciled with God etc... \nGod is not tolerant of sin and he does not embrace it either. We all have \nsinned and fallen short of the glory of God. That is how we were separated \nfrom God, it is through our sin! That is why Jesus came to earth to die on \nthe cross and by doing so he took the penalty for our sins upon himself. \nThe penalty for sin is Death both physical and spiritual, so that through \nfaith in him and Repentance we could be reconciled with God, be forgiven \nand become his children. But we Must repent our sins and be born again of \nthe water and of the Spirit in order to enter the kingdom of God. Stop \ntrying to vilify the bible as hateful because it doesn't agree with your \nflawed morality and sinful lifestyle. Sin is hateful, when we sin against \nour neighbors we are hating them.\ufeff",

I've read the bible and there so \nmuch fucking hate in that thing I can only see your \"God\" As a hateful, \nfeared entity that you and everyone that believes your shit wants everyone \nto worship... Hell, Satan sounds a little RESPECTFUL compared to him! \n\nI have my own religion and I don't want my children to ever read the bible. \nit full of hate and it's nothing more then a ghost story. God should be \nfeared and worshiped and it you don't you got to hell... I really hate this \nregion... It's hypocritical! Ether burn for the rest of your life or Be \nscared for the rest of your life... The fuck man!?\n\nI'm keeping what I believe out of this because I don't want to be ridiculed \nby people, unlike you.
