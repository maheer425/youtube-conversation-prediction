At first he gives advice like 'Start \nyour swing with A' or '159 yards to the pin'. However, if you leave it for \na little while longer, Boo will say 'Why haven't you hit the ball yet?'. If \nyou leave it even longer, Boo will come past with quite a few remarks, some \nof which are quite funny like, 'Hey, are you even there anymore?' and 'Do \nyou plan on hitting the ball... TODAY?'. There are even more than that \nthough and I won't spoil all of them.\ufeff",
