Think about \npeople in China (where my ancestors come from, by the way). They work 12 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, make $150 a month, and they don't complain \nnearly as much as you do. Your working conditions are EXTRAVAGANT compared \nto theirs. If you want to reduce your stress on the job, just bear this in \nmind: You are actually VERY lucky compared to the rest of the world.\ufeff",

Mental symptoms of extreme stress were depression, \nanxiety, suicidal and homicidal thoughts, and panic attacks, agoraphobia. \nThey tried meds on me and zoloft made it even worse. So byebye kiddos. This \nwas 3 years ago. I loved them but that stress was destryoing me. Im lucky i \nmade it out alive.

Maybe it isn't \nstressfull if you don't care a shit about what kind of job you'll get, but \nI sure do. My mom didn't have a good education and now we're struggling \nwith our economy a lot. Do I want that in the future aswell? God no. Do I \nwant to be able to help my mom and poor kids who need it? Oh yes. And you \nhave no idea how much my school is pressuring me aswell. I have a stack of \nhomework lying on my desk. I don't have time for a social life. I don't \neven have time to go help mom grocery shopping because if I do, I will \nnever have a time to relax. And my mom stuggle with epilepsy now since she \nstressed too much at work, and she hated her job aswell. I know what stress \ncan cause. There's not a single day in my life that I'm not stressed, not \neven overreacting. Tell me all you want about adult shit. I already do \nadult shit. I clean the house a lot because my mom can't handle getting \nstressed out, clearly. So I will gladly risk my life for her. Because at \nleast then I will know that I tried to do something about this. My mom \ndidn't deserve to get poor. She just had a bad childhood and she had bad \nparents. It's like I'm her parent anyways. Because I was the one who saved \nher so that she wouldn't die when she got unconscious.\n\nI did not mean to make you upset or anything if that's the case...

Like \nliterally, nobody wants to hang out with anyone who can't afford to come. \nAnd how do you make friends then? Idk. I have 1 friend I hang out with like \nonce every sixth months. Sure, I have the internet but I at the same time \nhave too much homework to sit and play online games all day. Since I'm poor \nI feel like I have to get the highest grades possible in school and I'm \nliterally dying of stress every day. Why am I here then you ask? Well, I'm \nwriting an essay about stress. Why so much words? Idk",
