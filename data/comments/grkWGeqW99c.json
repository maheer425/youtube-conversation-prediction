The Great Courses has a lecture series \nby Arthur Benjamin, the 'Mathemagician'.\n\nAs a maths teacher of many years, IMO this is the wrong way to teach \narithmetic. Multiplication, for example, should be taught as being \nequivalent to addition. This promotes comprehension as opposed to the Vedic \ntechnique, which is nothing more than a series of parlour tricks.\n\nI can't see the benefit, in the modern world, of promoting these techniques \nover using a calculator. They seem very impressive at first but are nothing \nmore than a series of steps to follow if you don't understand what you are \ntrying to do!\ufeff",

The multiplication table for example is a basic \nelement we use by memory to operate with real numbers. Having to perform \nraw addition is not really productive in this case but can be useful in \nother cases where huge numbers can be broken down into smaller pieces. If \nyou've read Arthur's book on mental mathematics, you'd know that he use a \nlot of these 'parlour tricks' on top of his method and even devotes a \nsection of his book on memory retention using mnemonics. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that no comprehension is really lost by these \nmethods.
