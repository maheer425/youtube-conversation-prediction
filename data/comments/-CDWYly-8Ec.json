I also love \nwhen they use the excuse that they have to make their games around drivers, \ndrivers that use the same API's as they do, using the same exact standards \nto interact with their software.\nI know because I do, and I see the API's and frameworks in use and they \neven state what they use most of the time.\n\nIn other words making a game is MUCH MUCH easier then they would like you \nto think especially if they are using someone else's engine and code. Not \nsaying its not difficult just saying its easier then they would want you to \nthink.\ufeff",

They don't get to call their own shots. \nMicromanagement kills great games, and we know the feces rolls downhill. So \nin cases like with Dead Space 2 and 3? Where you can TELL EA stepped in and \nexplicitly told Visceral what they had to change to make the sequel more \nprofitable? I have no problem blaming the publisher at all. \n\nThat's why I have such a problem with Obsidian fanboys. They seem almost \nanticipatory in their desire to blame the publisher, even though Obsidian \nare independent. They don't have to do anything that they don't want to. \nThey don't have to sign any contracts or take any jobs that they don't want \nto.

In essence, your greatest enemy is this kind of loneliness and \ndesperation the environment conveys through not only the monolithic \narchitecture, but also every AI coming to hunt you. There's a part in game \nwhere you have to find a book for kindling fires (for reasons, but no I \ndon't want to spoil why it is).  You enter an area with multiple bodies \npiled outside with disfigured facial masks, contorted, incomplete, and hung \non crosses.  When you finally find the boss and enter through the doorway, \nit seems to not expect you (coincidentally it's also the weakest enemy in \ngame).  It's a pathetic little thing called Pinwheel.  After killing it, \nyou discover from the descriptions of three masks that Pinwheel had were \nnamed \"Mask of the Father\", \"Mask of the Mother\", and \"Mask of the Child.\"\n\nEach description tells a different part of the same story. \n\n\"One of the three masks of the Pinwheel, the necromancer who stole the \npower of the Gravelord, and reigns over the Catacombs.\nThis mask, belonging to the valiant father, slightly raises equipment load.\"\n- Mask of the Father.\n\n\"One of the three masks of the Pinwheel, the necromancer who stole the \npower of the Gravelord, and reigns over the Catacombs.\nThis mask, belonging to the kindly mother, slightly raises HP.\"\n- Mask of the Mother.\n\n\"One of the three masks of the Pinwheel, the necromancer who stole the \npower of the Gravelord, and reigns over the Catacombs.\"\n\"This mask, belonging to the naive child, slightly raises stamina recovery \nspeed.\"\n- Mask of the Child.\n\nIn the room, you see various books Pinwheel has been reading and Pinwheel \nhimself looks like a conglomerate of different entities.  \n\nBasically, most players believe that with this evidence given by the \ndevelopers, you killed this creature's one chance of maybe restoring the \nthree different entities, the mother, the father, and the child by taking \nthe Rite of Kindling, a book stolen by the abomination that may have had \nsecrets in reversing this curse.  There was also more lore supporting this \nconclusion, but I'm blanking on it.  In your attempt to gain power, you \nslay this beast that you only later find out what it was.  \n\nThis is only one battle.  Tons of more bosses tell their own story like \nthis. Without even a single word exposited to the player through excessive \ndialogue trees. \n\nAlso now that I think of it, L.A. Noire was also a fucking great \ninvestigation game that was also a triple a title. \n\nSorry for the long story, if you made it to this part of the convo, take a \nlook at some lore videos or gameplay videos if this game has piqued your \ninterest.
