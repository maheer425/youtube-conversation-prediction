There is even a documentary of a woman who was raped \nby several Soviet military men. So to deny this, is like denying the \nHolocaust (which some people actually do...)\nIt's not something that was made up during the Cold War or anything \nit's fact and we must remember it, so we humanity learn",

I \nnever, ever give Wikipedia as a source. Because it's true that it can be \nchanged. The only point I was really trying to make was that it's easy to \nfind out if the wiki is accurate at all by going to the sources at the \nbottom and reading through them. I HAVE found Wikipedia as a very useful \nplace to start, by pulling up a topic, and then going down to the sources. \nIt's a easy place to find sources specifically for the topic your looking \nfor instead of going through university library pages and the likes (though \nthose can be extremely useful, depending).\n\nI'm not saying anyone should give Wikipedia as a source (though in my \nstudies and discussions with professors, I've found that the majority of \nwiki tends to be accurate, because even though anyone can change it to \nsomething wrong, that wrong information rarely stays there. Though I can \nagree that it's very likely that political groups, ideas, and myths would \nbe glaringly inaccurate.). However, again, it is easy to prove or disprove \na wiki by going to it's sources. I always go down to the sources first, and \nif there are none, I won't even bother to look at the rest of the page. If \nthere are, I may read through the wiki page to give me a basic summary, \nthen go to the sources to both confirm and inform more in depth. Wiki can \nbe good for quickly finding what part of something you want to be looking \nat, and then you can go and find good sources on that specific thing.\n\nOnce again, I don't source Wikipedia pages. If someone else does, I can \neither go through the sources to see if the page is accurate. If it's not, \ninstead of saying \"Wikipedia isn't a valid source\", I'll simply rebuttal \nwith an actual reliable source, and THEN I might mention something along \nthe lines (shorter) of what I've just gone over. Wikipedia can be a helpful \nplace to start, but it is not completely reliable as it CAN be changed, so \nif you want solid ground to stand on, cite something better.

I deeply \napologise. It was the faggot before that.\n\nYou can pretty much ignore everything I said in my post because I thought \nit was the other faggot. So when I said that ass kicking thing, I was \ntalking about the other guy. But my statement stands true. Liberals ( \nMarxist definition of a Liberal ) are complete pussies.\n\nAll of the wikipedia articles this faggot sent me though are not protected \nunder anything. \n\nI don't think Wikipedia can be reliable. I once found a wikipedia article \nthat said gays had rights in Vietnam and then when they displayed the \nconvenient chart that everyone only pays attention to, they said no.\n\nAlong with any wikipedia page on the Soviet Union, Stalin, Mao. the DPRK, \nMaoist China, the kim family, etc.\n\nGenerally anything to do with Communism, or any extreme political ideology \nfor that matter, are complete bunk. They are edited by so many viewpoints \nthat it all just gets fucked up. There's so many contradicting pieces in \nthem.\n\nI also don't like people using Wikipedia ( Or me, I'm no hypocrite ) \nbecause it's fucking annoying. I've seen people link to a wikipedia article \nwithout even reading it before. People automatically just link to wikipedia \nwithout even paying attention to what it says. Everyone in the wikipedia \ncommunity is completely desensitized to actually paying attention to what \nthey're providing as a source. I, on the other hand, provide decent sources.\n\nWhy do you think no one brings up Holodomor, Socialist failure or a \nplethora of other anti-communist myths around me? I have the evidence and \nsources to back up what I say. Furthermore, I have the evidence and sources \nto go on the offensive about Capitalism, NATO, the EU and the UN.\n\nAlong with another plethora of bullshit \"Organizations.\"\n\nThey're organizations alright.

Instead of acknowledging that some members of a \ngroup have undesirable characteristics, the fallacy tries to redefine the \ngroup to exclude them. Sentences such as \"all members of X have desirable \ntrait Y\" then become tautologies, because Y becomes a requirement of \nmembership in X.\nThe fallacy does not occur in defining a group or label narrowly to begin \nwith, but in narrowing it by excluding evidence that contradicts an \ninitially broad definition.\"",

You're hilarious. \nThis, along with hundreds of other reasons, is why we DO NOT respect your \nbeliefs.",

If you seem to be clueless on \nwhat a TRUE christian is read the bible, And If you seem to be stupid on \nwhy there are other denominations Read the \"muscle and the Shovel\" by Mike \nShank. This is why problems with you people come up. You don't research nor \nComprehend Christianity.\n\nPEOPLE do PEOPLE things, like Not following orders. It's Typical for humans \nto turn things around and make it suit *them*. From a Christian standpoint, \nA lot of people DO NOT follow the bible or its teaching, simply because it \nrequires us to not \"conform\" to Carnal HUMAN behavior. For example: The \nbible States repeatedly (in adulthood) Baptism is required for salvation. \nYet Baptists Churches teach, Only repentance is necessary. Baptists \nchurches Fail at Comprehending why baptism is important. Catholic Churches \nBaptize children WHICH IS WRONG. AND FOR THE LAST TIME ARE PAGAN. THEY HAVE \nTHEIR OWN BIBLE, THEY HAVE PREISTS THEY CALL FATHER, THER WORSHIP MARY \n(VENUS), PETER (JUPITUR) Christ (SATURN) etc... Holidays by the catholic \nChurch were holidays to protect the romans from being exposed for \ncelebrating Yule and other human sacrificial days. The Catholic Church IS \nTHE WHORE, While you people wouldn't even know nor care, simple because \nAtheists fail at history, logic, and comprehension. \n\n However take pleasure in Insulting and harassing us.

I \ndon't believe in any religion myself, neither do a lot of my friends, and \nquite a few people in my family. None of us fit into the category that she \nclaims all atheists are. You wouldn't know we were non believers if you \ndidn't ask. I respect everyone's right to believe what they want to \nbelieve, more power to you, I believe what I believe and you believe what \nyou believe. I never push what I believe on others. We can have a civilized \nconversation about your beliefs and my beliefs if you want, but I usually \nchoose not to when someone's beliefs are so far from mine because usually \nthe conversation will go nowhere, it's useless when both people are so deep \nrooted into their belief system, it's like talking to a wall, so I usually \nopt out when it comes to talking about religion, unless we have similar \nbeliefs because then we can exchange ideas and viewpoints. She claims \natheists are always harassing her, I've had the opposite experience where \nreligious people are always harassing me to believe what they believe. So \nshould I make the claim like she does about atheists, and lump all \nChristians into one category since I have had so many experiences with them \npushing their beliefs on me and judging me for what I believe? No, because \nI am not an ignorant asshole and I know they aren't all the same. I don't \nknow what atheists have been harassing her, but I can assure you that we \nare not all like that, I myself am one and I know many many others just \nlike myself. We keep to ourselves and don't push what we believe on anyone \nelse, we live normal happy lives and are good people just to be good \npeople, with no ulterior motives and no murderous tendencies lol.

The official answer thus far, from multiple scientists I \nhave asked, is that they simply don't know. Understandibly, they were \nneither there at the time nor have found a way to research that far. \nSimilarly, Evolution has multiple 'plotholes' as well. Logically speaking, \nif human evolved from apes, and we still have both humans AND apes, there \nwould be at the very least a handful of races that are identifiably in \nbetween. Similarly, there would be a far greater number of animals out \nthere that seem to be in between evolutionary links for every other species \nas well, such as Dogs and Direwolves. Further complications occur in that \nthe First cell had to of been created. Granted that a single cell would be \nneeded to reproduce, and granted that the earth is billions of years old \n(more likely, but also debatable), it is possible evolution could have \noccured. A single cell, however, is complicated enough that a HUGE number \nof processes go into its creation. Here is some evidence -   \nhttp://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Life/cell_mitosis.html\nWith this in mind, for such to of occured without involvement from a \nsentient organism is almost certainly impossible. So, aliens or god. Your \nchoice.\n   That, of course, is not to mention that certain adaptions, such as a \nGiraffe having an extremely powerful heart able to raise and lower blood \npressure as well as a neck able to reach the tops of trees, (since it needs \nhigh pressure to reach its head when leaning up, and the amount of pressure \nused could theoretically BLOW ITS HEAD OFF if it leans down), would be \nuseless without the addition of the other said adaptation.\n     Finally, despite both them AND the bible having plotholes, I must ask \na simple question: Does the Bible contradict Big Bang Theory OR the theory \nof Evolution? Even if they are true (a fact I am skepctical of), the bible \ndoesn't describe how mankind was made. Therefore, even if said theories are \ncorrect, it does not disprove the Bible.\n   Sorry if you take offense to reading this, but ultimately it is my \nbelief. You believe in your books, I believe in mine. Personally, I fully \nsupport any religion, including Big Bang and Evolution.

We do put them in a prison because technically \nthey broke that law which is made to stop and prevent infiltration (a lot \nof countries have this law such as the US). I don't agree with that law and \nin no way do we condone the situation, it's never implied that we make them \nwork until they can't stand or that we execute them in brutal ways in that \nprison.

The Persians \nliberated them and and Judah flourished once more until the Greeks came in \nand Israel as it once were was extinguished as a kingdom. The land was \nnamed Palestine by the Greeks.\n\nAlso,before the the United Kingdom of Israel,there were indeed other tribes \nliving in the territory, but none of them have direct lineage with the \ncurrent Palestines.\n\nEither way, self-gloating aside you'll be surprised how the Bible can be \naccurate about some historical tales (with obvious exagerations to make \nIsrael look better). For example,Caananites and Philistines were the first \nsettlers,and apparently the theory exists that Israel came into existence \nnot from some mystical people escaping Egypt,but rather from a group of \ncaananites that had acquired different traditions over the years and \neventually declared their independence.",

The realization that there is no evidence or objective proof behind \nwhat they've spend their whole lives on is terrifying.  I am an atheist, \nbut I am not a serial killer or rapist as they believe I would be. \n\n\nI do have a \"moral compass\", far stronger than the religious.  I don't \nthink a giant, bearded, invisible man will punish me if I anger him; I do \nthings, or don't do them, because it's the right action, not because I want \nan eternity living in an outer-space mansion.\n\n\nReligion is responsible for wars, suicide, terrorism and many other \nhorrors.  Instead of take a step back and evaluate their life choices, they \nrush to their keyboard and say every problem is due to atheists.  Was Jesus \n(real name Yeshua) real?  Maybe.  Son of god?  No.  Is the earth 6000 years \nold?  No.  Are atheists bitter, angry people who secretly believe in god?  \nNo. The religious are scared, defensive people who know their lifelong \nhopes are full of holes.  End of story.\ufeff",

Now on to point 2 don't you think having such a corrupt \nand wicked beginning should be seen as a bad sign? And it wasn't just in \nthe beginning but if you want to go that far then let's count them out \nshall we the crusades. The crusades part 2 (failed attempt to retake \nJerusalem) the inquisition (causing the death of over 9million European \nwomen) the witch burnings late 1500s the Salem witch trials (which sparked \nsimilar witch hunts in nearby towns), and recently a young girl here in the \nU.S. was nearly stoned to death by her class mates for being wiccan and \nanother 5th grader suspended for supposedly cursing her teacher to get the \nflu. In all honestly I think y'all need to take a break from the judgments \nsince your high horse attitudes are built on the bodies of MILLIONS",

Generalizing things like that is dangerous and prejudice against ideals \nlike that is what fuels wars. The christian belief system specifically says \nthat we are not supposed to burn people at the stake, in fact I can't think \nof any religion that says to do that. The worst is the Amish who ostracize \npeople who condone technological advancement because it goes against their \nideals of manual labor. The people who were the heads of the christian \nreligion at the time were clearly not christian. They were liars who took \nthe leadership position because they were put in power by the kings, who \nwere not explicitly christian. These kings and popes were primarily \nconcerned with unifying Europe under one banner, which was explicitly \nwritten in the bible as impossible, compared to iron and clay that cannot \nmix. This authoritative distraction meant hard times for people. There was \na lack of labor due to most able-bodied males being sent to the killing \nfields. The royalty, in order to make unstable Europe a bit more stable \ndecided that the son of a blacksmith should be a blacksmith, and the son of \na farmer should be a farmer. This meant that education was unnecessary, \nbecause everything you would ever need to know in life was taught to you by \nyour mother or father. The only ones who knew how to read were people who \ndedicated their lives to reading and writing, aka christian monks. In fact, \nits thanks to the hard work of Christian monks living in monasteries, \nisolated from the wars in Europe, that many works from all over the world \nwere translated into Latin. We have access to many Greek works like the \nOdyssey and the Iliad now because some christian monk decided they were \nworth transcribing. The christian monks were shunned back then because they \n\"wasted their time preserving useless books when they could be out fighting \nfor their country or working the fields to feed the soldiers.\"\nYou could just be all like bluh bluh the people who ordered the crusades \nwalked around with crosses on their clothes so that means christianity is \nevil and everyone died because of it, or you could consider what I've said.",

I only say \nthis because I researched the subject rather extensively. It was the ATF \nwho raided them over reports of them stockpiling firearms and ammunition. \nAnd on top of that I heard they were not paying their taxes. During the \nsiege they had barricade themselves inside the compound. And during one of \nthe attempted breaches The ATF used old-school teargas canisters that that \nbecome very hot when used and that is what caused the fire. And because \nthey had barricaded themselves and their compound most of them could not \nget out like all the women and children Who I believe we're down in the \nbasement where they thought they would be the most safe. There were only a \nfew survivors. And it was the ATF who started the story that they started \nthe fire inside the compound to kill themselves. It was not a mass suicide.\ufeff",

The tear gas canisters were fired at a concrete bunker hours \nbefore the fire broke out. Most of the tear gas was pumped in via tanks. \nThere's also tapes from listening devices within the compound that recorded \nmembers starting fires. The physical evidence also showed that 2 of the \nfires started deep within the compound away from where any tear gas \nentered. David Koresh was a child molesting cult leader who needed to be \nstopped, however it seems like the ATF was too heavy-handed during their \nsiege and should've made more attempts to negotiate with the members. Based \non the physical evidence I don't think the ATF caused the fire, I'm not \nsure if the Davidians intended to kill themselves but it does appear that \nthey started the fire that ultimately killed them.",

It didn't have to go down like \nthat, especially since it started over stupid gun laws and was IMO a \nviolation of their rights in the first place to do the initial raid the way \nthey went about it.  \n\nBut, most people just think a bunch of nuts went crazy, shot at law \nenforcement, and then burned themselves to death.
