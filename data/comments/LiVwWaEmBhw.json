That's why, in a previous comment, I compared the introduction of \nfluoride to public water, to the production of leaded gasoline in the \n1920's.

It \ntook more than 50 years later to convince the public that it was a serious \nhealth issue and that something had to be done about it. But before that, \nthis was just a \"conspiracy theory.\"",
