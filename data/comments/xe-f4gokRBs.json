Maybe there are some \nphysicists lurking that could explain if not:\n\nHow much energy can you theoretically store in a Prince Rupert's Drop?\n\nDoes the explosion cause any heat to be released?\n\nWhat physical process causes the glass to turn into such tiny particles? \nWhy not just crack or shatter into larger particles? Is it possible to \naffect their size?\n\nIs it possible to make a \"Prince Rupert's Sphere\" (a drop without a tail) ?\ufeff",

                    "text": "+OATest If you ever watch a piece of glass break in slow motion, you would \nnotice that the glass begins to flex in the direction that it was hit. \n Glass, like anything else, getting bent has a side in tension and a side \nin compression.  Glass does not have much tensile strength so it cracks on \nthe tension side. Tempered glass has an outer layer in residual compressive \nstress. When the glass flexes, the residual compressive stress is still \nhigher than the tensile stress due to bending.  This keeps the glass from \nbreaking.  To break tempered glass, you have to hit it hard enough to \novercome the residual compressive stress.  \n\nIf you hit a glass ball, it would \"squish\" like a rubber ball, and start to \nflatten out.  Not as much of course, glass is much stiffer.  At the point \nof maximum tension, where the ball bulges out the most, the glass will \ncrack.  A PRD is tough because the intense residual compressive stress.  If \nyou used a sledge hammer or a 20 ton press, you could shatter a PRD, by \nsquishing it hard enough that the outer tensile stress overcomes the \nresidual compressive stress.  \n\nThe residual compressive stress would be a function of a number of things: \nthe size of the ball, the rate of cooling, the starting temperature of the \nmolten glass, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, probably a \nfew more variables.  But in a nut shell, the hotter the ball is when it \nsolidifies, and the faster is cools, the larger the outer surface is that \nis being compressed, the more residual stress is being generated.  \n\nThe force to break the ball would then be a stress/strain relationship \ngoverned by the poisson's ratio.  That is a property of all materials \nrelating to how much if you deform a material in one direction, how much it \ndeforms in the other directions.\n\nAt this point the theoretical calculations are getting mind boggling.  But \nthey could be determined experimentally.  Residual stress measurements are \nvery common in materials science.  So, make a drop, measure the residual \nstress, compress the ball with 3 times the measured force.",

                    "text": "In theory, the total stored energy is ZERO.  In a PRD, there is a balance \nbetween in the forces between the exterior in residual compression and the \ninterior in residual tension. Lots of force, going in opposite directions, \ncancels out.  Force is a vector.  For a PRD to exist, the force exerted by \nthe residual stress of the exterior can not exceed the internal tensile \nforce (tensile strength x cross sectional area of the residual tensile \nregion).  When a PRD breaks (or you shatter a tempered glass window, which \noperates under the same principles),  the residual compressive region is no \nlonger contiguous, and the balance gets upset.  The tensile stress is now \nhigher than the compressive and the drop \"explodes\". \n\nIt doesn't really explode, its more like a balloon popping.  The stretched \nglass, contracts quickly in all directions.  The glass goes flying.  The \nglass ends up in very small pieces because it is the lowest energy state.  \nBig pieces of glass would still hold a lot of residual energy.  The higher \nthe residual stress, the smaller the pieces. \n\nHeat would not be generated.  Heat due to rapid failure is associated with \natomic slip and a process called adiabatic shear.  It's not something that \nhappens in glass since glass does not undergo atomic slip. \n\nyou could make a ball of glass with the same forces in play as a PRD.  You \nmight be able to do it by getting the glass very hot (so very low \nviscosity) and dropping it from a very high spot so it would form a sphere \nin free fall.  This is how lead birdshot was made back in the day, with \nwhat is called a shot tower.  Once it formed, it would be very, very \ndifficult to shatter.  You would have to scratch or cut the glass through \nthe thickness of the residual  compressive layer to get it to shatter.  \nThat is why the tail is the weak spot on a PRD, the layers are very thin.

The cost of complying with aca \nrequirements is driving rural doctors out of business (minimum 2 additional \nnon-medical employees with 50k+ salaries, CNN Money, \"Doctors going \nbroke\").  So access for everyone NOT living in a city, is already declining \nseriously with their costs skyrocketing, because rather than going to their \nsmall community doctor's office, now they have to drive to the closest town \nof some size.  The rural population is about 1/3rd the total population of \nthe US.  Not enough to make a voting bloc to overturn the ACA, but there is \na catch.  virtually ALL the US agriculture, energy, mining, lumber business \nis in rural areas, and depends on rural labor.\n\nSo the ACA is hurting those who feed us, provide the energy we use, provide \nall the raw materials. required for a civilization.  There are three ways \nthey can react.  They could meekly go along.  They could pass on all their \nadditional costs.  They could organize and strike.  Of course miners, \nlumbermen, farmers, etc aren't known for being meek people, so I doubt that \none.  And the people who run these businesses tend to live in urban areas, \nso they may not be sensitive to these rising costs, and hence may not \nsupport raising wages to offset the additional costs.  Which leaves the \nthird possibility as the only one likely to generate some response... which \nwe are already seeing in the agricultural communities.\n\nOf course those most likely to be hurt by these rising prices (food, fuel, \nraw materials) are those with low incomes, who will, predictably, thanks to \ntheir ideological enslavement and poor educations, blame the evil \ncorporations for rising their cost of living, rather than following that \nrabbit back to its source.\n\nACA causes rural doctors & hospitals to close dramatically increasing the \ncost for rural people to get health care, and increasing times for them to \nget access to emergency treatment > those costs are embedded, one way or \nanother, in products and passed on > the poorly educated and ideologically \nenslaved blame the evil corporations for passing on the costs forced on \nthem by the ACA.",

                    "text": "+krishan bansal You are correct, Krishan....the thing about glass it is \nmade up of silicon and oxygen atoms...the shape of the oxygen around the \nsilicon is fixed (four O around one Si in a tetrahedron)...but the Si-O-Si \nbond can rotate.  So in essence, \"glass\" (window-type glass) is a bunch of \nnanoscopic pyramids.  If you were to take those from a hot (soft) state and \ncool them slowly, the pyramids would arrange in a regular, and tight \npattern.  If you were to take those and cool them quickly, the pyramids \nwould just freeze where they were, and not re-arrange, forming a more open \npattern.   Metals (most metals) don't really have this cooling-rate \neffect...you can cool em fast or slow and they will end up in the same \narrangement.  \n\nNow, you MAY be able to do this with an amorphous metal, but I don't think \nthe differences in final volume (due to different cooling rates) are as \nlong...also...amorphous metals have a much higher thermal conductivity \n(again, I think) so you wouldn't get such a high difference in cooling rate \nfrom outside to inside...hope this ramble helps...",

I'm \nguessing the silica and other chemical compounds in the glass formed a \nchain-like structure, so it shatters even when you hit a far spot, like \ndomino effect? or like when I pierce an inflated balloon then it explodes \ninto random pieces. That's my guess on the molecular scale, could be \ntotally wrong. \nIt's very interesting to know the vase arm joint has opacity because of its \ntension in it :D",

                    "text": "I used to do a lot of glassblowing.  The principle is that glass has \nincredible tensile strength, so if you can put it in a state where it's in \ntension it behaves very, very well.  (Glass fails in compression quite \neasily, and by putting it under lots of tension, compression only reduces \ntension, rather than actually compressing the glass.)  So a drop of glass \ninto water cools the outside rapidly while the inside's still hot, and then \nthe inside cools later, and because the glass contracts as it cools, you \nend up with an enormous amount of tension distributed across and through \nthe glass.\nWindshields on cars are made the same way -- any tempered glass is.  If you \ndo manage to crack a piece of tempered glass, it'll shatter completely, and \nif you listen after it breaks you can hear it still crackling away as \nsmaller and smaller cracks run through it.  But to get to that point takes \na much larger force than you'd expect, which is why you can put a prince \nrupert drop on an anvil and hit it with a steel hammer and put dents in \nboth of them without injuring the glass.\n\nInteresting side-issue: stressed glass polarizes light.  If you take two \npolarized sunglasses -- you're wearing one, and holding the other one in \nfront of it -- you can *see* stress in glass.  Unstressed glass will be \nclear, but stressed glass will have colors and opacity.  This is usually \nvisible on things like vases that have had arms attached.  Glassblowers \nanneal glass after working it -- cool it down slowly, to help reduce \nresidual stress, but it doesn't always work.",

However, one could argue a \nhuman-swung hammer is also part of the class \"fast-moving object\".\n+Anton Zuykov 's comment led OP to reword his statement to replace \"bullet\" \nwith \"fast moving object\" meaning he had equated the two classes. In doing \nso the OP inadvertently changed the sentiment behind his statement making \nit overly broad.\n\nFor example, if a market tester said:\n\"I need a boy to test G.I. Joe toys\"\nthen changed it to:\n\"I need a human to test G.I. Joe toys\"\nThe market tester could now get the wrong demographic to test the toy.\nBy telling the tester a boy is nothing other than a human has the tester \nmake his language overly broad and lose the sentiment he meant to convey.\n\nAll of this feels overly in depth and pedantic for a YouTube comment. Yet I \npersist, because when I see +embrezar make a correct statement that is \nignored because it was rude I feel the need to explain.\n+embrezar stop being a dick and you might positively impact the world.",

The dumpsters \nare dumped in special recycle yard. The pile is sometimes as big as a house \nwith thousands of long strands poking out of it. If you try to pull out one \nof the strands and it is held into the pile to well it breaks just as \npictured in the video. It seems to turn to dust intantly.

That&#39;s not just a technicality: supersonic motion creates shock waves, which are what does most of the damage in an explosion.

I get \nthe idea, however I've done some more reading on the subject and must \nreserve judgement as it gets into quantum mechanics. I can't be bothered \nwith more than a passing curiosity.\nOh, and C is defined as \"the speed of light in a vacuum\" and is 299,792,458 \nm s\u20131. In water light's speed is around 225,000,000 m s\u20131. In glass light's \nspeed is around 200,000,000 m s\u20131.\nMy memory from high school physics was not in error.

The speed of sound is much \nless than the speed of light in any case, this is why you see the flash of \nthunder before the clap. The speed of light is constant, and you're also \ncorrect that light takes more time to travel through different mediums, \nhowever the reasons behind this are extemely complex and mathematical, and \nin reality aren't the same as taking a longer route. It's late and so it's \nthe perfect time to have a go at explaining this. In reality, the beam \nlight is still traveling at C, however the light clusters together as a \nthing called a wave packet, and this wave packet moves slower than the \nlight does. It's the wave packet that you observe as your light traveling \nthrough the material. Imagine a line of people running forward at C, the \nguy at the front is carrying a bottle of light with a parachute attached, \nas he is running forward the wind pulls the bottle back, but  he is not \nable to slow down, so he has to pass the bottle back. If you were to \nmeasure the speed of the guy, it's C, but the light bottle is moving \nslower. Different mediums ie glass, water, air, have a stronger wind \nblowing on the bottle, so the light bottle will move at different speeds, \nbut only ever slower than the guys/ under C. The guys are the light, and \nbottle is the wave packet. What's a bit odd is in reality, once the guy has \npassed the bottle back, he'll dissapear, so err maybe it's a bottle of \nlife, I dunno. But If you even vaguely understood that then you've done \nseriously well, cuz I'm not quite sure if I do either!",

People have done experiments to \nshow this by sending sound through air for a distance, and several other \nmediums for a vastly greater distance, and them all reaching the end at the \nsame time.
