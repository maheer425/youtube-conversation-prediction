The idea in 2's complement is that you turn the left-most \nbit into a sign-carrying bit. But with 3's complement in base 3 you now \nhave more than two states for that digit--0, 1, or 2.

How do we decide where \nthe positive and negative spectra end? The point of a complement system is \nto divide the possible base 2 (or in this case base 3) representations \nbetween positive and negative equally, but you can't do that for either \n10000 being -162 or 20000 being -81, since your \"byte\" will have twice the \ncarrying capacity for one spectrum as it does the other.

You saw that he defined s as the series in question.  \nThen he calculated what 1-s would be, and the result was the same series, \nwhich results in a conclusion that 1 minus the series is the same as the \nseries itself or 1-s = s.  Then he just used basic algebra by adding s (the \nunknown value of the series) to both sides giving 1=2s.\n\nBut that proof brings up another question in my mind.  When you take 1 \nminus the series you make the number of mathematical operations in the \nseries 1 longer.  So instead of doing infinite mathematical operations you \nwould instead be doing infinity plus 1 operations which means you \nintroduced an extra +1 or -1 at the end of the series (depending on if \ninfinity is an even number or an odd number), which means it shouldn't be \nequal to the original series :p  If you look at it this way then the \nresulting formula would actually be 1-s=s-1 OR 1-s=s+1.  The first equation \ngives s=1, the second equation gives s=0.  So the real question is if \ninfinity is even or odd :p  As far as I know due to its undefined nature \ninfinity is neither even nor odd, making the answer of the series undefined \nas well.",

Much like putting all the \n1+1+1+1+1+1.....1-1-1-1-1-1-1.....And that is what is wrong with this \nvideo, you can group the terms however you like, and thereby creating a \nconvergence that does not exist in my opinion. The main point I was making, \nwas that the averaging that they were doing was not accurate, because \ntaking 1+(-1+1) and turning it into 1+0 as if it were now 2 terms instead \nof 3. Yet when they go one more term 1+0+1 they treat that as 3 terms. \nGrouping has inherent flaws and that is my main point. Also the 1*(1-1) \nthing you refer to is from the lines crossing out the minus sign that was \nthere before. Which should look like 1 (1+1) which is technically incorrect \nsince it would distribute the - onto both ones, but that is the problem \nwhen grouping in this problem.\n\nEdit: I can't seem to get rid of the neg 1's without the dashes being there \nas well.

The step from \n1 - S = S, to, S + S = 1, and so to 1/2, is valid but it is based on a \ndeduction from a non-real number. (1-1+1-1...) is a divergent series that \ndoesn't tend toward any value, as it neither tends to a number, nor +\u221e or \n-\u221e. It doesn't tend to 1 any more than it does to 0, and the gap between \nthem is an infinite set of numbers.  Where the alternation is going is not \nspecified, hence undefined. What they are doing is pulling an unreal number \ninto a real one with a mathematical process, much like one would do with \nsomething like (\u221a-1)\u00b2, which leads to -1, albeit from an unreal alleged \nnumber. The fact that they are resorting to this to explain physics only \nshows the holes in string theory and like-minded theorems.

If you shorten the time in half, the \namount of photons emitted will also be halved. After a while the \"on\" state \nwill emit only a few photons. Once you get to the point where it emits only \na single photon, you might say that it has a specific chance to emit a \nphoton (like in radioactive decay) - but this would still have a downwards \ntrend as the time is halved (50%, 25%, 12,5%...), so in the end it would \nhave an infinitesimally small chance to emit even a single photon and would \nessentially be off.\n\nAlthough, the problem would arise even sooner at the light switch (fewer \nand fewer electrons would pass through it to power the light, at some point \nreaching zero).

Re-bracketing the \nseries in order to prove convergence is a form of circular logic.\n\n3) Formal proofs supplied by real mathematicians (unlike you) would only \nre-bracket a partial sum and then make an epsilon argumentation to prove \nthat the sequence of partial sums converges to a real number. An example is \nthe proof of the Leibniz Criteria for Convergence.\n\n3) The sequence 1, -1,  1 , -1 ... is an example of an ALTERNATING sequence \nwhich does not satisfy the nth divergence test. Therefore, the series of \nthis sequence (the infinite terms) does not convergence but diverge.\n\n4) There are countless of formal ways that any mathematics student could \nuse to show why your \"proof\" is void. However, I won't say more to avoid \nconfusing the non-mathematicians reading this any further.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION: This is a farce. Open a calculus textbook to get a sense of \nhow mathematicians write a valid formal proof.\ufeff",

This is precisely how these series were analyzed which is what \ngave rise to the ambiguity of it's result and its subsequent study and \ninterest in this problem. Our modern techniques were born because of these \ninformal discussions of these problems which showed how unintuitive the \nresult is, and then rigorous techniques were designed to analyze them. Now \nwe use those methods to analyze these series. But the techniques which have \nbeen demonstrated to be mathematically valid corroborate the results stated \nin the video. \n\nfurther, you'll note that in these and other videos (can't watch them right \nnow) that they'll refer to limits which aren't really limits and methods of \nassigning values to series which seem to make no sense but in fact make \nmore sense than any other result. They are not equal in the normal sense \nbecause you can't subtract 1 from the -1/12 = 1 + 2 + 3 ... to get 2 + 3 + \n4 + ... = -13/12. They are methods used to assign values to these series so \nthey are not sums in the traditional sense. Also there are alternative \nsumming methods available (or ways of assigning sums), see Cesaro summation \nand others. So quoting things about nth divergence test is just assuming \nwhat you learn in an undergraduate degree is sufficient to apply to every \narea of maths, there's your facts. DONE. That simply isn't the case. In \nfact in higher level maths you'll often be dealing with different systems \nof numbers or objects or studying a system with different axioms or logical \nconstruction. There's a discussion of the continuum hypothesis which one is \nnot able to prove or disprove in current set theory which is widely \nbelieved to be consistent. So sometimes absolute truth is a bit beyond \nreach from what we know now.\n\nIn any case, this wouldn't be the first time math instructors \"lie\" about \nsomething to get the point across (e.g. can't square root negative \nnumbers). It illustrates the point without blowing you away with maths more \ncomplicated than what is necessary for an informal discussion. What is \nimportant to know is that the formal discussions do exist, and it doesn't \nrequire a lot of searching tbh... You just need to not be so up yourself \nand maybe read a little more.\n\nps.

In a sense, the value 1/2 is derived by \nevaluating the entire series 'as a whole', without using partial sums. It's \na well-defined, consistent result, even though it is not derived from \nconvergence.\n\nOn a more advanced note, this technique is related to analytic continuation \nof complex functions.",

Let \nme make a more extreme example: imagine we reorder the terms so it goes \n(1+1+1+1+1-1-1-1-1-1)+(1+1+1+1+1-1-1-1-1-1)...and so on.  Now the sum can \nbe 0,1,2,3,4, or 5, depending on when we \"stop\".  But if we \"stop\" the \nsequence anywhere but at a place where the sum equals one or zero, it will \nbe impossible to reorder our series to look exactly like (1-1)+(1-1)+... \nbecause we'll have too many positive ones and not enough negatives ones.  \nIn other words, sure, it's fine to reorder the terms, as long as you make \nsure not to stop in the middle of the parentheses and lose some numbers.\n\nIn your case, going (-1+1)+(-1+1) etc works just fine, as long as you don't \nstop in the middle of a set of parens.  If you do, you've invented an extra \n-1 that doesn't have a place if you reorder it to look like (1-1)+(1-1).  \nThat extra -1 is why it seems like the infinite sum could add to -1, but  \nit looks like that because you've lost a term, not because it's actually a \nviable option.\n\nIt's trivially easy to show on a graph, but a lot harder to explain in \ntext, unfortunately.  Maybe imagine this: say you go for a drive somewhere, \nand then go back home.  Then take all your twists and turns and straight \nlines and drive them all the same way you did before, but in a different \norder.  At the end, you'll still get home, because all those turns are \ncommutative, no matter how many times you do it.  But if, just one time, \nyou only use some of the turns and straight lines and not all of them, then \nwe can't really say much about where you'll end up.  Maybe you'll get back \nhome, maybe you'll end up in Timbuktu.  You've lost track of some terms and \nnow commutativity is irrelevant.\n\nDoes that help make sense of it?",

With 1+1-1... you see none of that.\n\nIn that series, there is no convergence.  You forever get the same two \nalternating results.

You want to calculate what \nfraction results in 0.242424 repeating on infinitely.\nd=0.242424....\n100d=24.242424...\n100d-d = 24.242424... - 0.242424...\n99d = 24\nd = 24/99 = 8/33\nThis works because the extra 24 at the end has infinite 0s in front of it, \nmaking it such a small number it can be assumed to be 0.\n\nIf you don't get that description, that decimal could be defined as this \nseries: d = 0.24 + 0.0024 + 0.000024 + 0.00000024 etc.. or\nd = (24*10^-2) + (24*10^-4) + (24*10^-6) etc...\n100d = 24 + (24*10^-2) + (24*10^-4) etc...\n\nBut that means there's one entry at the end of the d series that isn't \nfound in the 100d series.  That entry would be (24*10^(-2*infinity))  This \nmight be hard to visualize but I'll try explaining why.\n\nd could be defined as a sum of 24*10^(-2*I) from I=1 to I=infinity\n\n100d would then be 100*24*10^(-2*I)\nor 24*10^2*10%(-2*I)\nor 24*10^(2+-2*I)\nor 24*10^(-2(I-1))\n\nsince I is going to infinity the last 2 entries in the d series would be \nthese\n24*10^(-2*(infinity-1)) and 24*10^(-2*infinity)\n\nThe last entry in the 100d series would be\n24*10^(-2*(infinity-1))\n\nTherefore you see that the 100d series stops just before getting to the \n24*10^(-2*infinity) figure, that figure is only found in the d series.  But \nthere is also one figure in the 100d series that is not in the d series, \nthat figure is 24.  All other entries are in both series. \n\nSo when taking 100d - d the entries that are the same cancel to 0, that \nleaves only the values that are not the same 24 - 24*10^(-2*infinity). \n\nThe -24*10^(-2*infinity) is the value I was referring to when I was talking \nabout a 24 with infinite 0s in front of it.\n\nThe reason this doesn't blow up the equation is because 10^(-2*I) \napproaches 0 as I approaches infinity.  So, 10^(-2*infinity) is 0, which \nmeans 24 times that figure is also 0. \n\nThat leaves us with 100d - d = 24.  It is simple algebra from there.\n\nYou can't use the same trick with Grandi's series because the extra entry \nat the end of the sum can not be rounded to 0.",

You posted a response that was informative, helpful, and did \nnot attack my character (too much).\n\nThat link was very interesting and proved your point that, in this case, \nthe rules for summation do change - seemingly because information is lost \nwhen sums are treated in this fashion.  The article does a great job of \nwalking through techniques to demonstrate where this information is lost \nwhile still moving along pretty quickly (you have to take his word on some \nof the math or verify it on your own time).\n\nI did notice this remark in your article:\n\"Remark 1: The most famous instance of smoothed summation is Ces\u00e1ro \nsummation, which corresponds to the cutoff function eta(x) := (1-x)+. \nUnsurprisingly, when Ces\u00e1ro summation is applied to Grandi\u2019s series, one \nagain recovers the value of -1/2\"\n\nFrom this I gather that Cesaro summation is well defined and useful but \nthat the evaluated sum ought to include more terms as discrete sums lose \ninformation (which can be recovered using the smoothing techniques that are \ndescribed in the article).\n\nIn response to your analysis of Numberphile I'd say that you're right and \nthat there's nothing wrong with that approach.  This video channel tries to \nget everyone excited about mathematics and some of the cool and unexpected \nthings that can turn up as a result of study within math.  If they \napproached this video from the standpoint of Riemann sums and smoothing \nfunctions then you'd be happy but you'd also be the only one to watch it.  \nIf you'd really like to inform people then for the next video where you \nfind something that you dislike simply find a related article (like the one \nabove) and in your FIRST post state your complaint and link the article as \nreference.

You \nwould flick the light faster than the speed of light after a certain point. \nSince it wont reach the 2 minute mark, I will add the Planck rule, so on \nthe last Planck second the light would be switched. The 2 minute mark would \nstop time in the room, but it would be possible to observe it. As you move \nthrough the room you would find a room that has waves of light and darkness \nat the same time, in the order of 1,0,1,0 etc. since the distance gets \nhalved, you would have 1 unit light, 0.5 unit darkness, 0.25 unit light etc \netc. if you count both apart, you would have 1 1/3 units of light and 2/3 \nunits of darkness. so 4/3 units of light and 2/3 units of darkness, divide \ndarkness by light and you would have 1/2.

Basically what a digital controller \nwill do is just flip that particular circuit on and off at an extraordinary \nrate, and the weighted average of the \"on\"s and \"off\"s ends up being your \nattenuated amplitude.\n\nSo let's say within one second, the flips are such that the circuit is on \n80% of the time and off 20% of the time. This will equate to an amplitude \nattenuated to 80% of your maximum amplitude.

Yes, if the list of ones you add and substract is finite, \nthen it will either be equal to one or zero. But it's not. It never ends. \nThat means it cannot be equal to one, cause there HAS to be a minus one \nafter the \"last\" plus one, and it cannot be equal to zero, because there \nHAS to be another plus one after the \"last\" minus one.\n\nWith that being said, the easy and quick answer would be to say it cannot \nbe solved, and I guess that's true enough. It certainly can't be said that \nit is equal to zero or one, for reasons specified above.\n\nThe mathematical proof shows that it is = 1/2, which is counter intuitive \nenough. But you can't expect to say that centuries of mathematicians \nworking on this problem are wrong, especially when you are shown in this \nvideo two proofs that prove that the number in indeed 1/2, without coming \noff as a jackass.\n\nSaying things like \"But as long I have not understood or believe that I am \nright I dont care if 1 Million people agree on something.

Fundamentally it would equal \ntwo but it never truly would.\n\nLet's say that you stand one foot and then you move half way closer to a \nwall. You'd then be 6 inches away from the wall. You move half way closer \nto be at 3 inches. You move another half to 1.5 inches. Another half to .75 \ninches. Another half to .375 inches. You can tell where this is going. No \nmatter how many halves you go, you will never touch that wall since zero \ncan't be half of a number(aside from maybe zero?) so you will always have a \ntiny gap between you and that wall no matter how many half steps you take. \nScience proves this idea as well: two atoms can't touch. So even if you \nwalk into that wall until you can't humanly get closer to it, you're still \nnot touching it(of course, the same can be said of any object, not just a \nwall). \n\nAnother way to look at it(and an analogy that I've seen a few times in this \nthread) is cutting wood. However, instead of the previous arguments saying \nit would be two, why don't we reverse the process. You start at the \nsmallest possible positive number and then add twice that number to it \nuntil you reach two. That one seems a little more realistic, right? Wrong. \nThe problem is that you can't find the smallest positive number because \nit's the same as finding the largest possible number. As long as there are \nzeros to add(and there will be) you can never get the smallest number \nneeded to make two since you, essentially, don't have the number required \nto begin the multiplication. That's the same place we run into a problem \nwith going the original way. You can't reach two because you don't have the \nnumber required to make two. \n\nJust an afterthought: I only realized the guy above me had the same exact \nexamples I did but for the opposite reasoning.

Because of that, it doesn't always \nwork with real numbers. This is exactly why we invented the limit; to give \ninfinity a chance at working when it does.\n\nThe limit sum of 1/2^n as n approaches infinity is an example of where it \nworks just fine; the limit is 2, because the partial sums clearly converge \ntowards 2. However, Grandi's Series has partial sums that don't converge \ntowards a single number, so there is no limit. Thus, there is no sum.\n\nFor a much better example of why limits don't always work, see the limit as \nx approaches 0 of sin(1/x). The behavior around 0 doesn't converge to any \nnumber, so there is no limit.\n\nThe moral of the story? Infinity is a mean beast, don't screw with it if \nyou don't know what you're doing.\ufeff",

                    "text": "Actually there's another way of getting at what Horea came up with.\nNumberphile says the sum depends on where you put the brackets.\nOriginal series: 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ....\nOption that gives 1: 1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 +1)... \nOption that gives 0: (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ...\nBut there's also an option that gives -1. Would you agree that a + b = b + \na? Or, a + b + c + d = b + a + d + c? It's perfectly legal to do that. We \ncould reorder the terms in the original series in the same way, so term 1 \nand 2 swap places, 3 and 4 swap places, and so on. So from 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \n... we go to -1 + 1 -1 + 1 -1 +.... Now, if you put the brackets in a way \nthat you get -1 + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) +..., you get the answer -1. \nIf you stick to this order, but move the brackets up or down one spot, you \nget the answer 0, just like above. So according to Numberphile's method, \nthe sum should equal -1/2. In other words, the sum of these terms is equal \nto 1/2 and -1/2 at the same time. Which means playing around with infinity \nlike this is pointless/wrong. In my opinion, you can't draw any conclusion \non operations that include infinity, unless it's convergent (i.e. 1 + 0.5^1 \n+ 0.5^2 + 0.5^3... etc. ",

The series shown in the video is better written as:\n(+1)+(-1)+(+1)+(-1)+...\nwhere each bracket is added to one another and contains its own number, an \nalternating positive one (+1) and negative one (-1). In your summation \nthere you have:\n(+1)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+...\nwhere each bracket is added to one another and contains its own number, \nstarting with a positive one (+1) and then continuing on with negative ones \n(-1). So both summations are clearly different from one another, and so \ncannot be equated to one another.\nSorry for making such a long post, I'm just very exact about things. Don't \nshy away from asking such questions and thinking in these ways, but make \nsure to check if your questions can't be explained with a little bit of \nthinking on your end. :)",
