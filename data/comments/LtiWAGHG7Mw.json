                "text": "It will definitely be worth the money when its lost half its value and the \nprevious owner barely drove the car. Also, the Boxster drives better than \nthe Cayman. But these are really the same car, it's only Porsche marketing \nthat tries to get everyone to think they are different cars. They're no \nmore different cars than a 911 Cabriolet is different than a 911 tin top, \nboth are still Carreras using the same parts bin. For marketing reasons \nPorsche decided to sell them to the public as different cars. And \nironically, the Boxster handles better than the Cayman (and 911) because it \nhas a lower center of gravity, it simply does not need the extra rigidity \nof the Cayman if it comes at the cost of more weight up top (where you \nleast want it) and has mid engine handling on a short wheelbase. Which is \nprecisely why Porsche give the Cayman 10 more horsepower than the Boxster, \nto reduce the advantage of the Boxster's lower center of gravity. Basically \nif you had the same engine in a Boxster, Cayman and 911, the Boxster would \nbe the quickest in the hands of 99.9% of drivers. And if they ever add rear \nwheel steering to the Boxster, like on the new GT3, it will be no contest \nwin for the Boxster. But Porsche would never do this because as most \nsuspect, it costs more to make a Boxster than a base 911, so the profit \nmargin is probably much better with the 911.\ufeff",

The 911 Cab is a compromised 911. The Cayman is a \ncompromised Boxster.

Which is why Porsche has to give the \nCayman a slight power bump, but not too much so it doesn't inch too close \nto the base 991 Carrera. There has been this long held belief that the \nCayman \"feels\" like the driver's car. But you can't win an argument with \ncenter of gravity unless there's a substantial weight or power difference, \nneither of which is the case here. Porsche slipped up and made a Boxster \nthat was on the level of the Cayman R with the Boxster Spyder. I seriously \ndoubt that will happen again. We'll see a Cayman GT4 for sure but a Boxster \nGT4? Don't think so, this would make it the Porsche that checks the boxes: \nlight, short wheel base, lowest COG with the most neutral handling. Check \nx4. That would throw a wrench in Porsche's marketing plan of positioning \nthe Cayman on performance as the car between the Boxster and Carrera. *On \nequal power* the Boxster would be the quickest and best handling of all of \nPorsche's cars. Just like the 550 Spyder was back in the 1950's and early \n1960's. A car they even fitted with a Formula One engine, but that was a \ndifferent Porsche company than the marketing machine of today.",

Then in about 40-50 years people will \nsuddenly think it's the most amazing thing ever, and the market will \nsuddenly spike and in 18 months they'll be worth about 100x more than they \ncost new. Unless it's a FR Porsche, they'll always be cheap because no one \nwants those pieces of junk for anything other than thrashing around race \ntracks for cheap. So the trick is just to buy them at the right time, and \nyou don't really lose $ on the sale price if you end up not keeping the car \nfor too long. One pro of the modern cars is they are actually pretty \nreliable and can be driven regularly, but you can still expect to pay \n$6k-10k a year in scheduled upkeep (tires at least once a year, maybe more \noften depending on driving, oil changes, brakes, etc.), unless there is a \nmajor unscheduled repair and you are stuck with a $15k-20k repair bill for \nsomething like engine/transmission. My point being that the cost of the car \nisn't even really the big expense of ownership. Just owning and maintaining \na Porsche can be expensive and end up costing more than the purchase did! ",

But, what \nthey do is push a bunch of options that you don't really want and which are \ncharged to you at barely less than full price.

Even if discounts don't exist anymore, I don't feel highly about \npush marketing. On top of that, when the consumers will start being annoyed \nby Porsche's strategy, it will start hurting the brand and that will take \nyears and money to be forgotten ... \nLastly, although I have owned a GT3 that I have downgraded for a 996 40 \njahre edition (which I bought 7 years ago for the price of a non \nanniversary car), I see the difference between a 991 and my car, the inside \nis much nicer, the car probably corners faster on a track but, in every day \nuse mine is more raw and feels every bit as fast in a staight line ... \nThere is not enough of a difference to my taste for me to \"upgrade\". During \nthe same period of time, Ferrari had moved on from the F355 (which is drop \ndead gorgeous but close to 996 fast) to the 458 which is a beast of a car. \nIt seems quite obvious to me that Porsche will soon come out with a F458 \nrival using the 918 chassis or the Huracan/R8 next generation chassis but \nwill be in a few years time and will be a totally new product line instead \nof pushing the 911 or the Cayman to it's maximum potential.",
