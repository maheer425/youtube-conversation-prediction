I guess \nwhat im saying is that people should not ridicule the people bringing it, \nbut the ones with the allergies should be more careful of their \nsurroundings.\ufeff",

So when \na mom is allergic and a dad isn't then their child has a 50/50 chance of \nbeing allergic.

Ok let me try to re-teach you and break \nit down as simple as possible. A percent is a number over a whole. For \nexample: out of 100 people, 20 are allergic (20%). Out of 200 people 40 are \nallergic (20%). Out of 1000 people 200 are effected (20%) etc. If the total \nnumber of people increase and out of those people, less and less are being \naffected by peanuts then we say \"percentages decrease\" But out of the total \nnumber of people, more and more people are Being affected than we say \n\"percentage increase\". For instance: in 2005, there was 1000 kids in a town \nand 200 were allergic to peanuts (that's 20%). But in 2010, there were 2000 \nkids total and 1000 kids were allergic (that's 50%), 20%- 50% is an \nincrease. As you can see, a percentage is a number over a whole (I really \nhope you know that). let's say in 2005, 500 out of 1000 kids were allergic \n(50%). And in 2010, 500/2000 Are allergic (25%). 50%- 25% is a decrease. \nPercentages are based on proportions so what you stated made no sense.",

I have many friends that are Muslim and even \nthough they follow the Koran as their holy book which contains the first 5 \nbooks that are in all holy books they still remain my friends knowing that \nI follow no religion. books like Leviticus  which to me is one of the most \nviolent of all the books in any bible. The commandment thou shalt not kill \nis apparently one of those that can be ignored under certain circumstances \nas in if your wife were to lay down with another man in the same manner as \nyou then you should stone them both to death ie Kill them but thou shalt \nnot kill, what a conundrum isn't it. all religions in my eyes are bad with \nequal measure. so many contradictions. so am I supposed to take the book of \nLeviticus literally or is there some other interpretation that one can \nthink of to the words they should be stoned to death. how else should that \nbe interpreted. and these are only some of the reasons that I believe all \nreligions are indeed both misleading and contradictory. therefore confusing \nand violent in many ways. and the main reason I don't actually follow any \nreligion. Do I believe there is a God ?? I don't really know but if I were \nto be judged based on whether I followed a religion or not that that to me \nin NOT a benevolent being/spirit or whatever else you want to call him is \nit. then all religions believe in God, Allah, Jehovah or whatever a bible \nmay call him.

So clean, in fact, that parasites are mostly not a worry. \nHowever, there's still a mechanism in our bodies for defending against \nthem. With virtually no purpose in parasite-free countries, the system \nbegins mislabeling certain proteins as 'parasites' and begins performing \nthe functions it normally would to no avail.\n\nThe system is supposed to open up the blood vessels so that extra blood \ncells can fight off the parasite, along with constricting the airways in \ncase the parasite has to be thrown up.\n\nBecause this doesn't work for the proteins, people experience hives (from \nthe leaking blood vessels), nausea & cramps (from the 'throwing up' \nresponse), trouble breathing (from the 'throwing up' response) and severe \ndrops in blood pressure (from the blood leaving the vessels).\n\nI'm sure some of this must rely on genes, but I think environmental factors \nwould have a greater influence on this.",
