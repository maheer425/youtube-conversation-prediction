I feel for them a bit really they have a job \nto do most of them HATE Tories as they have halved their pension, stripped \nthem of perks and other parts of the job they signed up to do. Then they \nhave to face a mass of roaring prolariates which they probably share \npolitical ideals with. Shame",

In America, the vast majority of households \nown a handgun, as do all of the police. In the UK, not only are handguns \nhighly illegal, but the only reason you would own one would be to kill or \nthreaten to kill someone. Anyone who lives in Britain knows that owning a \ngun is a guaranteed prison sentence, and if any aggravating factors are \nadded in to the equation, then the sentence can easily reach life \nimprisonment. This is common knowledge to anyone living in the UK, and \nrepresents the strongly anti-gun attitude the UK has as a whole. If anyone \nis willing to take that risk, the chances are they intend to use the gun \nfor more than showing off. The police knew this moron was involved in gang \nactivity, and when they saw he had a firearm on him, acted in the spur of \nthe moment and shot him. Arguing about the finance sector is pointless, as \nit all revolves around ones political viewpoint. Free market thinkers would \nprefer banks to be less regulated, therefore when they failed customers \nwould lose all of their money but the taxpayer would not bail them out, but \nthose in favour of governmental control would disagree.

You don't see white people going crazy when someone is killed do you? \nSpeaking about double standards is not racism so you can get the fuck out \nof here with that. \n\nMoreover , this was a fucking joke that got taken way out of hand, my \ncomment about the guy that was shot being a scumbag was true and absolutely \nnothing to do with the colour of his skin. He had been under surveillance \nfor many months previous to this, had been arrested for robbery, murder and \nattempted murder previously, hardly a fucking saint was he?\n\nFurthermore, American issues have little to do with anything that happened \nhere so bringing that up is just another pathetic excuse for the fact you \nhave no real argument. Also, I wouldn't go calling people uneducated when \nyour entire comment is about how I'm supposedly racist for admonishing \nsomeone over a bullshit comment.

                    "text": "Maybe it's because in London there are a lot of 'lower class' people who \nare from black backgrounds, whereas the footage from Liverpool clearly \nshows mostly white rioters because further north 'lower class' people tend \nto be from white backgrounds. I don't think people were looting 'because \nthey're black'. I think the people looted because they don't feel connected \nto society, they don't feel equal, there is an 'us and them' mentality \namongst young, lower class people in this society, and police harassment is \na very real problem in these communities. There is a mistrust of the entire \n'system'. And that often includes resentment for anything from police, to \npeople who they feel have more money than them. The UK has some real class \nissues that we need to deal with. These estates and apartment blocks that \nthese people come from are part of the problem. This country is not \nintegrated at all. If you're from a poorer background, you go and live over \nthere in that shitty block of flats, but if you were brought up in a middle \nclass family then you can live over there on that friendly street of semi \ndetached 5 bedroomed houses with mid range vehicles on every driveway. It's \ncrazy that in our country you can usually tell which 'class' someone is \nfrom (and therefore what type of accommodation they live in, how much they \nearn, etc) just by hearing their accent. It's crazy. We are so segregated \nin terms of race and wealth that each section of society has formed their \nown accent. I wonder if this country would allow a lower class Liverpudlian \nto run for prime minister. I highly doubt it. Ah sorry I'm ranting. I guess \nwe'll never truly understand the reasons why the riots happened but I think \nin part much of it was just seizing an opportunity to take things that you \nreally want and in some cases can't afford. The whole thing was probably \nspurred by a general resentment and feeling of exclusion from the rest of \nsociety. 'Fuck everyone else, these people have never done anything good \nfor me so I'll take what I want.' But it certainly isn't because 'their all \nblack'. That was an incredibly judgemental and ignorant thing to say.\nWikipedia has a good article on the riots and highlights that \"The ethnic \nmakeup of the rioters varied in different cities: 76% of those arrested in \nManchester were white, while 29% were white and 39% black in London, and \nthe West Midlands was the only area where more than 6% were Asian.\"",

However I wonder how many of them went to and finished school. Say \nwhat you say about the british gov.'t, but there is an excellent public \nschool system. Chinese, Asian, and eastern european immigrants all \nimmigrate to England and those groups have far better rates of children \ngraduating school. So much of these problems can be fixed with education, \nand while the british authorities are far from innocent in this case, they \ncan be blamed for Black kids being educated at far lower rates. The black \ncommunity, in particular black families have to take more responsibility in \nthe education of their children. If a kids in school he's not on the corner \ndoing dirt...of a kid has an education he can more easily see the inherent \nignorance involved with destroying your own neighborhood. Plenty of people \nhad legitimate gripes with the government about the lack of job prospects \nand activities available to young people...and these morons, out to steal \nand break shit just for the sake of breaking it, ruined the chance of \nanything productive coming out of thw riots. An educated person who wants \nto see postive change in his neighborhood, would realize that destroying \nand robbing small businesses (the true lifeblood of local economy/society) \nis the worst possible thing you could do to initiate this change\ufeff",

Europe might have led to the \nestablishment of the US, but many of the accomplishments that followed the \nUS becoming established were the result of American ingenuity. Not European \ncontribution. \n\nConsidering that the majority of the US population lives in major cities, \nthe stereotype of most Americans being \"back woods racist\" would be \nincorrect. That argument might hold some water if you would have said that \nmost Americans who live in the backwoods are racist. But then again thats \nnot where the majority of the US population lives, so saying that its more \naccurate, is false.\n\nThe American \"eating to much\" stereotype is a more correct stereotype. \nAccording to food.ndtv.com, the US has about 33% of it's population of \nbeing obese. Ok, we got some fat people. I find it funny though when we \nreceive criticism from Europe about it. That same list puts the UK at \n26.9%, Russia at 26%, Germany at 25%, and Spain at 26%. Out of 196 \ncountries in the world, several in Europe happen to be some of the fattest. \nSo yea we got some fatties, but guess what, you guys are right up there \nwith us. Especially the UK so be careful who you're stereotyping as fat, ok \nfatties?",
