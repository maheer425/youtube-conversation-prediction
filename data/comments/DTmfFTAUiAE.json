                    "text": "*warning: long* I see your point, and I get why you object altering the \nanimals for the owner's convenience, however these 2 surgeries really are \nnot the same. When you declaw a cat, you're not removing their *need* to \nscratch. The mechanism, the instinct to use their claws is still there - \nthey just don't have the body part to perform it, which causes physical and \npsychological damage. When you neuter a cat - you take away their *need* to \nmate. The sexual equivalent of declawing, would be to leave your cat all \nhorny, but somehow make it impossible for him to get a hard-on... The \ninstinct is still there, just not the tool. And let it be said, that I do \nsee how the topic of neutering an indoor cat is somewhat controversial, \n(and i really detest it when people say they \"fixed\" their cat, or \"had it \ndone\". If you decide to do it - ok, but call it what it is: Neutering. It's \na surgery. It's not like having your ears pierced.). There are many reasons \nfor it, specially in areas that have so many strays they cause the \nextinction of other species (birds, fish). Also - do not project human sex \nonto cats. Cats don't mate with the thought of babies in their mind, they \ndon't feel intimate with the other cat or form a family unit. In fact, a \ntomcat could easily attack his own kittens, thinking they are prey and \nbreeders keep the kittens away from their dad if he appears too predatory \nlike around them. Cats mate, because they go into heat, and the only relief \nis mating. They don't have sex for the pleasure of it - when in heat a \nfemale needs to mate once for the heat cycle to be over (since it often \ntakes once for her to get pregnant). Cats do not connect their cat-pride to \nbirthing kittens. Their essence is hunting, being territorial and dominant. \nA neutered male will sometimes mount a female, to display dominance, he \nwill still spray, if he senses trespassers, and hunt and play. Neutering a \ncat is not the same as neutering a human - they do not have the array of \nemotions connected to the act like we do.\n\nBut still, why not just leave the cat the way he way nature intended? The \nproblem with this argument is really that nature didn't plan for house-cats \nto *be* in the first place, just like it didn't plan on chihuahuas, pugs or \nbulldogs. Can you imagine a persian cat or a chihuahua released to the \nwild, to live as \"nature intended\"? Cats are not ALCs. They look like them, \nbut they are not half as equipped for the wild life as an actual wild cat \nis. As practice shows, when left alone to do their thing, house-cats will \nmultiply like roaches, many will die at birth, diseases will be passed \naround, kittens will be bullied by other cats, the fights over the females \nwill make many lose an eye... not a pretty picture. Just like many humans, \nsadly cats are terrible in family planning, and they can't be reasoned \nwith, into procreating responsibly.\n\nYou have to see, that house-cats, all those loveable Persians and Ragdolls \nare a human creation, - humans are responsible for the fact they exist - \nand from the start their options in life are either: live free, breed, \nfight and die in 3-4 years, or live a long, safe but heavily controlled \nlife with a human - and if you're lucky, your human will have a large back \nyard and nice cat furniture. Not much of a choice, granted, but to me the \nsecond option seems preferable.\n\nThat being said, for some people the decision to neuter their cat is not an \neasy one, because they acknowledge they're altering the animal's mechanism, \nnot *fixing*, but *changing*, and no one who loves their cat is actually \nhappy about having to put your beloved pet through this medical procedure. \nRather they see it as a necessary evil, instead of letting the cat go \nmental when in heat and consequently get tumors... I can't help but wonder \nthough, if a third option could be invented? Like, adopting 2 cats, a male \nand female, and giving the male cat a vasectomy and some sort of hormonal \ncontrol?.. Maybe there will be some arrangement like this is the future, \nthat will allow them to live full lives, yet not overproduce offspring. One \ncan hope...",

It \nseems to me like you are proposing making THE DOMESTICATED CAT which is a \nPET, like a dog, into a WILD ANIMAL, wild cat, or degrading the human-cat \nrelationship into one that is no closer than that between human and cattle, \nor chicken.\nYes, humans often feed themselves (their children) and their pets wrong \n(which is a totaly different subject) and they \"baby\" them. But letting \nthose animals \"live a dangeourus life\" or take care of themselves in a \nworld that doesn't at all resemble their \"ancient homeland\" (I don't know a \nbetter term for it in english) is just cruel to me.\nI have a cat, a female one, she is spayed, not fat, healthy and happy. She \nhas a mind of her own and a close relashionship with my family. And she \nlives in an apartment. Would she like to have a garden and live in a more \nnatural inviroment? Yes, she would. Would I like to have that? ABSOLUTELY! \nBut the fact that we live in a city doesn't make either of us retarded or \nunhappy or violated of our natural rights or whatever you may think.\nWhy is she spayed? Because I don't want to be a person that throws out or \nkills a bunch of kittens that she doesn't have the space for. There are \nplenty of homeless kittens around my home and they get killed by cars, \nstray dogs and nasty \"humans\" every day. I do not want to be responcible \nfor that.",

Rather, it would add to the over \npopulation of cats and put native bird and rodent species at risk and \nthey're already at risk. Pet over population is just as bad in rural areas \nas urbanized areas and studies have shown that trap, neuter, release (or \nviolating the \"integrity\" of cats and their bodies) is more effective at \ncontrolling the population than euthanasia, which would be an even bigger \nviolation on the integrity of cats and their bodies.

                    "text": "+Jessica Cejnar Ok, so we have 95 million cat owners. The number itself is \nnot a problem on a world-wide scale, but considering the majority of \nhumanity are ignorant idiots, a large number of those cat owners should not \n\"own\" a cat in the first place. Stressed city-humans do not understand \nanimal and nature life so \"owning\" a cat should be heavily restricted in \nthe first place. The majority of cat \"owners\" live in crowded cites and \nmany do not even let their cat leave the house (because they know the cat \nwould never come back to those deluded selfish \"pet-lovers\" once it has \ntasted freedom). Most of cat disease come from humans feeding their cats \nwith unhealthy food-brands, restricting their instincts by keeping them \ninside and stressing them. Cancer simply does not occur in mentally and \nphysically healthy cats - its a man-made disease.\n\nSo, to control the \"over population\" of cats we should strive after a cat \nrelocation plan by building \"cat communities\" outside the cities and \nrelocate the majority of city cats to these \"cat farms\" and to the \ncountry-side, to people who really know how to treat cats. We still need \ncity cats too of course since they are pest control so we're not gonna \nrelocate everyone, but by entirely imposing \"owning\" rights on cats to \nhuman beings we create an unfavorable situation since urbanized humans \ncannot take care of animals. Unfortunately, the average cat owner only \nthinks about his/her pleasure by making her little \"pet\" into her \"baby\" \nand denying its true nature by doing so. There's no reason keeping cats \ncaged in city-shelters waiting for insane humans to give them a \"home\". \nEven if its a temporarily solution, its insanity on top of insanity and an \nongoing cycle without end.\n\nIts not about providing cats roof over their heads or being concerned over \ntheir \"health\". they are CATS, not humans. Cats fight, fear and live a \ndangerous life; its their true nature. Its rather about rescuing the cats \nfrom human beings who snugglify them, cut their balls of, make them fat and \nsick and let vet industries thrive on their ignorance.",

According to the Humane Society, there are 95.6 \nmillion households that own a cat. Six to 8 million dogs and cats enter \nshelters every year with 2.7 million adoptable animals euthanized because \nthey couldn't find homes. Feral cats are killing billions of native birds \nand the only effective way of reducing the numbers of feral cats in a \ncolony is trap, neuter, release. Why don't you talk about rescue groups who \ngo out to feral cat colonies to feed and provide veterinary care if about \nwhether overpopulation of cats is bullshit.
