As long as \nbeautt is concerned, every culture has it's own standards of beauty and \npeople want what others have though you don't realize you have what other \nwant so badly. For e.g, the Americans, britishers or white people love the \ncolour of tanned skin and they sit in the sun for hours to get it a lighter \nshade of brown. On the other hand, as I'm an Asian, we have naturally that \ntanned colour of our skin but here the people want to get fairer and to get \na white complexion. \nIronic right? That's why ppl are never satisfied with what they have. \nThough I'm not like that. I'm happy just the way I am and everybody should \nbe. Though i had complexes when i was young, that why i had a brown skin \ncolour, why i was fat, hair are short,but then puberty really changed \neverything.\nNow my skin tone is much lightened, I got slim and most importantly long \nhealthy hair.
