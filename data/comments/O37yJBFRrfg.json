I know my history, \ndo you know yours?\nAnd about neonazism. Neonazism describes ultranationalistic behaviour in \nthe modern day, which is present in Serbia in a huge amount of people. \n\"Kosovo is Serbia\", \"Greater Serbia\", \"Serbia and Russia above everyone\" \netc. etc. etc. \nIstria is a Croatian historical region since 600 A.D. with Croatian \nmajority since then. The Istrian peninsula had a tough, hard and exhausting \nhistory. Venetian Republic, Habsburg empire, Napoleonic France.... Everyone \nclaimed that part of Croatian land to be theirs, even though the majority \nof people living there thought differently. They were Croatians and \nremained Croatians and thats why Istria is an honorable and proud region of \nCroatia.\nJust like +We the Europeans told you, travel around EU and you'll see \npeople being happy, smiling and having a nice meal, dinner with their \nneighbours over the borderless line of Schengen, enjoying the rapid raise \nof economy and GDP in their country. \nYou mentioned Bulgaria and Romania. Why? Those 2 countries are now far \nwealthier countries than Serbia. They're in a rough situation right now, \njust like every other country since the 2009. world recession. Their \neconomy and GDP rose rapidly over the years since joining the EU, so whats \nyour point? Actually, almost every single country surrounding Serbia are in \nEU and have a higher GDP, which means that they're living in a country \nwhich has higher standards than Serbia (roughly translated- better life).\n\nRead a book, find something. The only one who is brainwashed by their \nanti-european policy is you. Right now, I'm enjoying my life in Croatia \nwith good living proportions.\n\nAre you enjoying your life in Serbia with average U$ 6000 per year? I don't \nthink so.\nCheers.",

Because the first element that brought rise to the European Union was \nfor France and Germany to share their coal production to make another war \nbetween them impossible on an economical standpoint.\n\nI see alot of people making assumptions about the European Union after just \nhaving watched this video (+ having some basic information about it). I \nbelieve that those people never had to study about the EU in school, it \ntakes a few weeks to really understand everything about it and then it \nsimply makes sense.\n\nIt's the first intiative in European history that crosses the \ncultural/economical and political gap in Europe. Where the goal is for the \nentirety of Europe to have a strong and modern economy. In order to do \nthis, richer countries dump money into the ones that need more development. \nNot as some form of solidarity but because it'll help these richer \ncountries in the long run. Reducing immigration coming from the East and \nfor better/more trade across the continent.\n\nFurthermore it's simply necessary to compete with growing economical \nnations such as China. And it works, the EU is the biggest economical force \nin the world at this moment and every new country that joined has advanced \nin overal development and economical value. (Hence why there's a waiting \nline)\n\nOne of the reasons why the European Union gets a bit of a bad reputation is \nbecause national politicians usually say \"We have to increase the tax on \nthis because the European Union tells us to do so\" while they cash in the \nimprovements that the EU makes for themselves saying \"We managed to lower \nthe tax on that.\". They tend to do this right before elections to protect \ntheir image whilst following European regulations.\n\nI can understand that some outsiders might have a negative view about the \nEU because it seems so complex and they think that there's a complete chaos \nacross the continent. All I can advice those is to come live here for a \nyear.\n\nI'm not telling you to think that the EU is great but atleast widen your \nview first and look at the bigger picture before making a statement.",

The ECB is like the club of \nunited national banks(not just the Eurozone). The ECB also set the rules \nfor the size of national debts, no more then 3% in a single year and no \nmore then 30% of the GDP. Both of those rules were broken as shown when the \nGreek crisis saw the light she had a debt of 100% of her GDP. When we went \nin the books to find out what happened the 3% was broken since 1978. This \nis when the Greek crisis started it started in at the latest the 1980's, \nbut Greece chose to ignore the problem, just like they are still doing by \nblaming others.\n\nThat is why the Greek economy failed, it wouldn't even have mattered for if \nGreece was in the Euro or not. The only difference that would have made is \nthat the Euro, even though Greece was a member, kept a stable course and \ndid not get influenced noticeable by the Greek crisis whereas if Greece \nstill had the Drachma, the currency would have fallen to an exchange rate \nof 1 Euro to 10.000.000 drachma or so. That in turn would have been \n(slightly) better for the Greek export but still a huge disaster for the \nGreek government, wealth and banking system. But then again, if Greece \nstill had the Drachma, the EU might not have been so easy with financial \naid.",

That they still feel \nsuperior to countries like Estonia or Germany, and since the EU treats them \nin the same manner doesn't feel right to them. While in fact, the UK has \nthe 3rd largest number of seats in the European Parliament, only Germany \nand France have bigger numbers since they obviously have a bigger \npopulation, this is how modern democracy works. Now imagine how a country \nlike Sweden feels. They pay enormous amounts to the EU yet since they have \na population of 9 million they get a small representation in the \nparliament. In fact the British one is more then 6 times as big. But the \nfunny thing is, the countries that actually have reason to complain, don't.\n\nAs to your plan to study in Germany, first of I think it is a great idea, \nyou will learn a lot more then just what they teach you in the university, \nas stated as before I lived abroad for quite some time and the hard part \nfor me was to get used to the Netherlands again, everything seemed weird. \nAlthough the European Union has some great programs to support you in this, \nlike the Erasmus exchange project(just google), you don't actually need the \nEU for that.

Don't want to go much into that, \nthough, I know only little.\n\nIn Europe on the other hand, every conflict, every war we've ever fought \nhere (with exception of civil wars) has been about \"No, I prefer to keep my \nland to myself, thank you very much\" and via such a long history mainly \ndefining each other over our differences, it has manifested in our minds, \nthat the other countrys are fundamentally differen from us (And they are. I \nmean, come on.). Wich in turn leads to the more simple answer:\n\nWe just don't want to. We want to benefit from each other as much as \npossible. But being grouped in with them all? Lose an international \napperance? Being he same nation as 'insert whatever you feel like'. No \nbenefit is worth that. (I'm sure you can think of examples.)\nThat may sound kind of harsh, I realize, but htink. Because you like \nsomeone as a neighbour, doesn't mean, you want to move in with them.",

Nothing changes but you now vote \nfor a joint government. How would that work? How can people that are \nlargely ignorant of each other be one people?\n\nA European public does not exist, neither does European citizenship besides \nformal rights. A German, French, Polish... guy is concerned with German, \nFrench, Polish, ... issues, watches German, French, Polish,... television \nand is not concerned with the EU except as an interference and annoyence \nwhen it comes to national legislation. You are not a European. You are \nBritish. Or Italian. You can go there without a pasport. Oh great. Not that \ndifferent from going there with a pasport. For vacation only. It's not your \ncountry. It's still foreign. Lack of border does not change that. And if \nyou work there, you a Foreigner working in a Foreign country and everbody \nsees it that way.\n\nTell that a New Yorker working in California? :D\n\nEuropean \"citizens\" cannot organize politically, or have a public \ndiscussion. If France changes same sex marriage laws, that's infotainment \nin the evening program. You might talk about it. But not with a Frenchman. \nAnd you don't really give a shit about it. It happens in another world. The \nEU ist not a federal country. Not anymore than the WTO is.\n\nWhat really drives the EU is an interesting question I cannot really \nanswer. It is sometimes discredited as an \"elite project\" which is driven \nby national governments but not their people. And that seems plausible to a \ncertain extend. Governments are certainly concerned about influence, trade \nrelations, etc. and it makes sense to join forces to gain more influence in \nthe world.\nThat is what the EU is. Bringing the countries of Europe in line, because a \ncollective decision has more force than a singular one. But even that often \nfails. Regardless, European heads of state seem to have a kind of \"do or \ndie\" mentaltiy about this, and gain at least some support for it. It's \ncertainly not the whole story but \"a desperate persuit for global \nsignificance\" is certainly a more fitting description of the EU than \"a \nhappy process of integration and people coming togehter tearing down \nborders\".\n\nI am not a historian but compare that to the US. The states had a common \ngoal to keep indepence and stuff, but also where somewhat similar enough in \nvalues and motivations to join forces at least in emegerncy. But well, not \nentirely. Like a somewhat different econmy in north and south. HEY GUESS \nWHAT! It's civil war.\nAnd now picture that with not a north and south being \"a little bit \ndifferent\" (I have to downplay the differences because in comparison they \njust seem non-existent when you compare EU states), but everything being \nhugely different east and west and north and south and center and beyond \nthe mountains and off the shores...\n\nThat there even is a process of common legislation and the worst that \nhappens is people getting a little bit grumpy and occasionally light some \ntrash containers actually seems quite impressive now. What I am saying is \nthe EU manages much more than you maybe would expect it to archieve. It's \nnot becoming a nation anytime soon.\n\nAnd that actually seems fine to me. Economic cooperation and free trade of \ngoods and services worked fine for decades without me having to agree with \nsome Polish, British guy about human rights, anti-terror legislation, free \npress or what kind of shit teenagers are allowed to put into their cancer \nsticks or having a stupid common flag.",

In the Netherlands, they \npayed with the Gulden (short: fl.), not the dollar.\nAlso: 0.37 fl. for a cup of coffee is absurd.

In fact: unlike what the vast majority of people think, \nthe Euro has not made everything more expensive. Some products increased in \nprice (most notably consumptions in caf\u00e9s and restaurant, which is why the \ncup of coffee is a bad example), but other didn't, or even lowered, and in \nthe end, it is probably a wash.\nAlso note that the Euro is a much more resilient currency than most of the \nindividual European currencies ever were, so inflation is kept much more in \ncheck, so in the end, the Euro will be to our benefit",

You say congestion is about \"the general use of cars\", suggesting \nit has little or nothing to do with immigration. Sorry, but that is \nillogical. The foreign-born population of the UK, from the 2010 census, \nstands at over 7 million, or 12% of the total population. This represents a \n50% increase on the previous decade. Seven million, and many more to come \nwhen others, such as Turkey, eventually join the EU. And my guess is that \nthe influx of Romanians and Bulgarians will kick off come Spring. Clearly, \na substantial number of these people will have cars, and that's an awful \nlot of cars. Build more roads, perhaps? Who pays for them? We're skint. And \ndo we really want even more of our shrinking countryside polluted? It's bad \nenough that snake-oil salesman Cameron seems to have given the OK to build \non greenfield rather than brownfield sites, no doubt because it's more \nprofitable for his business buddies.

As for things \nlike the NHS, schools and roads this is also a combination of myths and \nhypocrisy. Many hospitals (including one of my local hospitals) would have \nclosed if it were not for the influx of staff from Europe, roads are \ncongested worldwide its about the general use of cars. Stopping immigration \nwill not solve that but a mass investment in public transit will. Schools \nhowever are in trouble but I attribute that more to chronic underfunding \nthan immigration. Our schools have been in bad shape long before the \narrival of eastern Europeans. And finally there are houses. this one \nparticularly annoys me because it seems to be something the British are so \ninept at. In Britain we seem to have to not only own our homes but they \nmust also be typical suburban detached homes. In damn near every other \ndeveloped state (including America where there is absolutely no shortage of \nspace) there are far higher %s of people living in apartments  which are \nmuch more space effective and much more rentals (which leads to a better \nmore controlled rental market that makes it more affordable). This leads to \nsome excellent innovation with homes. Like in Germany the government backs \na program where a small group of people collectively employ a architect to \nrenovate a old industrial building or communist apartment block to more \nmodern luxurious standards, and then they all move in to one of the \nrespective units. However in Britain most brownfield sites are left \nabandoned. then there is the issue of using private development companies. \nDevelopers are currently sitting on vast tracks of land but wont develop it \nuntil conditions are more favourable, in Holland however the government \nitself just employs contractors to build it (thus cutting out the \nunnecessary middle man). this has been so effective in Holland entire \ncities have been built entirely by the government. \nThere are literally dozens of solutions to the problems you quote and \nstopping EU migration is not one of them.

And then there are the imports, which the 4 \nmost active EU members make up 29.5% of imports (the only ones in the top 6 \nare China in 2nd and the US in 4th). So no, it isn't \"5%\", it isn't even \nclose.\n\n\"Also, we trade more with the rest of the world than any other member \nstate.\"\n\nSo you would leave your largest single market for ease of doing business \nwith ones which are comparatively insignificant? Free trade deals won't \njust appear, even when it is a single state they take years to negotiate. \nBest case scenario you set all of the dozen or so trade deals currently \nbeing negotiated or ratified in the EU back 10-20 years for the UK, if the \nnations they are with bother to try again at all. When the best case \nscenario is worst then the Status Quo, only the crazy try.\n\n\"free of over-regulation this can only grow further.\"\n\nRegulations on trade for the British economy went down after joining the \nEU, but what's reality to UKIP supporters?\n\n\"Continental Europe will do what is best for continental Europe, and an \nincreasing number here are fed up of their almost daily interference in our \naffairs.\"\n\nI'm not sure which is more surprising, the fact you think of the \nmainlanders as a single group, or the fact that you take issue with less \nthen 10% of laws effecting the UK being passed by the European Parliament. \nEither way seems more a reactionary thought then a thought our one.\n\n\"The efforts to introduce a FTT, 60% of which would have been paid by the \nUK alone, is a case in point. \"\n\nThe UK is not even participating in the FTT, and there are 17 member states \nblocking it, and it requires unanimity to pass. And given what would be \ntaxed, there is nowhere near 60% of it which would come from the UK, unless \nGermany, France, the Scandinavian nations and the Benelux nations had their \nfinancial sectors shrink by 99% between now and a time the tax could be in \neffect if it passes. Not only are you talking out of your ass, you're \npulling numbers out of it.\n\n\"In good EU fashion they'll try to introduce it through the back door, \nprobably through some change in the banking laws on the pretext of reigning \nin those institutions for the \"public good\".\"\n\nGiven the type of law it is, there will be no means of passing it without \nunanimity. The EU system might not be perfect, but like all functional \ndemocracies there are some things which just can't pass.\n\n\"If it's to leave, then trade would carry on much as before but we'd have \nretaken our right to self-determination.\"\n\nThere's also the increase in price for a significant part of imports (much \nof which is food), and a reduction in exports across the board (the tariffs \nfor getting them into the EU would probably be larger then the domestic \nprices for them). So no, it would \"carry on much as before\".\n\nChurchill also said \"we must created a United Europe, one strong and free \nof outside influence.

                    "text": "+dunholm1 Alright I'm only going to address the issue of the economy \nbecause everything else is redundant at this point.\n\nChina's economic growth is slowing down, and doing so fast. I'm not sure if \nyou noticed but their economy isn't exactly a stable one (their 2012 \nprojections for Iron consumption by 2025, for example, came under harsh \ncriticism for exceeding industry production projections for the entire \nworld. A little hard to believe that is going to happen given the laws of \nphysics). China's economy has been slowing down, with last year being the \nslowest year of growth in the past 20, and the year before that holding the \nsame title. It's Japan's 80s boom all over again.\n\nAs for India, given the state of their economy 20 years ago 38% growth in \nthe past 10 years is no surprise (the country has surpassed Canada's \neconomy last year, a country with 1/35th their population).\n\nIt's also funny you use 1980 as a point of reference to show how \"far the \nEU has fallen\", given that it was before the US/Canada economic boom of the \n80s, the Japanese boom of the 80s, the South Korean boom of the 90s, the \nTaiwanese boom of the 90s, the modernization reforms in China, the \nmodernization reforms in India, the 80s reforms in Latin America, the \neconomic stabilization of Africa during the late 80s until now (relatively \nspeaking of course), the UAE oil explosion, the transfer from communism to \ncapitalism in Eastern Europe, Mexico's economic boom of the 90s, \nAustralia's boom which is still going strong, and a few relatively minor \nbooms around the world.\n\nThat's the thing about being a modern, continent sized economy (which is \nstill the largest just with the Eurozone), when 2 other continent sized \neconomies have a boom (Japan, North America), and dirt poor nations begin \nto catch up to the industrialized world, the proportion of the world \neconomy the largest economies controls shrinks. In fact in the case of \nWestern Europe it has been doing so consistently since the mid 50s.\n\nThe fact of the matter remains, economic growth is still persistent in the \nEU, it's only at levels to be expected of a 1st world economy, and any \neconomist who will tell you 8% or even 6% consistent growth should be \nexpected is unemployed with good reason. On a side note: since 1980 the \neconomy of the UK has grown by about 400%, and 2014 is expected to be see \nthe largest economic growth since 2007, so are you telling me that a 400% \nincrease over 34 years is a bad thing?",

The trend is obvious, and continuing to swing in only one \ndirection. That should not be happening when you consider that all the main \npolitical parties and much of the media, including the BBC are pro-EU and \nconstantly pumping out EU propaganda. As for growth, over recent years the \nIndian economy has grown by almost 30%, and the Chinese economy by around \n50%. Currently, it seems to be engaged in buying America and large chunks \nof the rest of the world. During the same period the EU has stagnated. In \n1980 it had a 36% share of world GDP. It is estimated that by 2020 that \nfigure will have shrunk to 15%. I'd call that a \"sinking ship\". It is also \nhighly inefficient. Look at the idiocy which is the CAP and how it inflates \nprices, or the vanity-driven Brussels to Strasbourg and back again road \ncircus which costs taxpayers around 200 million Euros every year. You \ncouldn't make it up. And the UK will do nicely outside of the EU. The way \nthe Europhiles talk you'd think we traded with no-one else. With an EU free \ntrade agreement, and able to make our own free trade agreements elsewhere, \nnot to mention being free of the burden of costly over-regulation, I think \nwe'd prosper.

Maybe one day, I hear it is beautiful :)'' Thanks \nbro :)\n\nWhen it comes to Ukraine crisis the whole thing fucking sucks so much :( \n EU have to show Russia that it can't break international laws and \nintervene things that happen in Ukraina by force (Krim, supporting \nseparatists), but Russia sees that it has right to do those things because \na) sudden change of Ukraine's foreing politics(revolution, pro-EU \nanti-Russia) b) Afraid of losing influence in pro-Russian eastern Ukraine \nand Krim c) Russia thinks that it has right to defend russian people of \nUkraine from anti-Russia government and encourages pro-Russians to separate \nthemselves from pro-EU Ukraine. Problem is that like 90% russian people and \nrussian government thinks that Russia is doing the thing that is ''right \nand fair'' and will never give up on Krim and now it seems that they don't \ngive up on eastern Ukraine either. So how to solve this crisis? Don't know \nman. EU's and USA's way is to push economical sanctions to Russia so it \nwould give up. There is a very possible way that the sanctions doesn't get \nRussia to the negotiating table solving the crisis but instead lead \nRussians to isolation from west and increases russians nationalism. I'm not \nsure but when you study Russian history you can see that you can't control \nthem with economy. Yeah you can lower their incomes and welfare but it will \njust make them feel like they were fighting. If they stayed united and \nnationalist even through 1990s when Russian economy and welfare were \nalmost non-existent, the whole country just sucked in everything and still \nthey were so patriotic that's crazy xD. Hopefully i'm wrong about the \nworld's development but it just seems to me that EU and USA are not driving \nit to the best possible direction and neither are russians.

Denmark, is quite used \nto trading with Euro's and when Lithuania get's the Euro, for the Danish \nentrepreneur it will be as easy to do business with Lithuania as it is to \ndo business with France, Spain, Belgium, Germany etc. You are taking away a \nbarrier for investments from the European countries.\n\nLithuania has no real interest from investors since it is 1. a new hard \nlanguage to communicate in, learn German and I would reach four countries. \n2. Lithuania only has 3 million inhabitants, German would reach 110 million \npeople in Europe. 3 They have their own unreliable currency(Disastrous even \n in the 90's) while the Euro is usable throughout Europe and if Greece \nproved anything it is that the Euro is stable.\n\nAs I said before the Lithuanian biggest trading partner is still Russia, so \ntake your pick, Euro or Ruble, both will peek the interest from countries \nwith a bigger economy",

While it's \ncertainly true that the Euro has been mismanaged (and this can still be \namended) it doesn't detract from the sense  of having it. For one the Euro \nmakes exchange costs 0 and a unified economic policy resulted in free trade \nacross Europe. It is doubtful whether cross-border tariffs would have been \nreduced to the same degree if there wasn't a unified European policy. The \nremoval of tariffs led to an economic boom post-ww2 in which Europe grew \nmuch faster than the United States. On balance it is probably better at the \nmoment for a nation to retain its own currency (unless you are a very small \nstate and burdened with a high deficit of course) however that doesn't \nchange the fact that a properly managed Euro achieved through MORE European \nintegration and a unified economic policy would be the best thing in Europe \nsince VE day.",

                    "text": "+jhutchyboy1 Oh god, the Daily Mail. Well, the first article uses the cost \nof public services (from Home Office) for each migrant and the absolute \nupper boundary (LSE - not Home Office - because it happens to be larger) to \narrive at the largest possible figure in terms of cost, without deducting \nthe contribution that illegal migrants make to the economy. So that figure \nis essentially meaningless.\n\nThe second article refers to a one-off event to which the UK government had \nto improvise a response. Asylum seekers are not routinely put up in 5 star \nhotels. It is not relevant and certainly not appropriate to refer to when \nconsidering immigration policy which occurs on a much, much, much larger \nscale. The actual experience of the average immigrant does not tell this \nlie that they have it better than the locals. That is totally ridiculous. \nThere is no reason for it to be this way.\n\nMost importantly, neither of those articles (because of the Daily Mail's \nconservative, racial, upper middle class bias) refer to the fact that a \nlarge proportion of illegal immigrants to the UK are genuinely seeking \nasylum for genuine reasons. I find the clamour to close the door to these \npeople particularly callous. The UK, by the way, is required to afford them \nthe opportunity to apply for asylum under international law, not EU law, so \nleaving the EU would have no affect on this.\n\nThe UK is also not part of the Schengen Area and is free to set the border \ncontrols as it sees fit, despite the House of Lords recommending it become \npart of Schengen. So the whole issue of the EU with regard to immigration \nis utterly irrelevant.\n\nNo country on Earth follows survival of the fittest. No individual on Earth \nfollows survival of the fittest. Cooperation is the human world. How on \nEarth do you think the global economy works? Do you think countries \nextract, produce, develop, buy and sell products and labour entirely within \ntheir own borders? Or that they compete for a generalised pool of \nresources? It is almost entirely the opposite of this.\n\n'Fixing things' in the UK is all very noble. The EU providing market \naccess, greater regional and therefore global relevance, better access to \nmore resources, a larger pool of highly-qualified labour - an increasing \nnumber of whom speak English - and continent-wide legislative and \nadministrative capacity which increase economic capacities across the \nboard. In providing all this, what exactly is the EU stopping the UK from \nfixing? Need I remind you that it all comes for a nominal fee - the UK \ncontribution to the EU is TINY (less than a half of one percent of GDP, and \n1.1% of UK trade to the EU). If the UK left the EU the increased budget \nwould be basically unnoticeable and completely eclipsed by the instant drop \nin GDP as trade takes a hit.\n\nTroops in Afghanistan is foreign security policy and nothing to do with the \nEU.\n\nThe 'actual governments'? The EU is also an 'actual' government, you \nrealise this, right? It might not look or feel familiar to you, but it is a \ngovernment. And, yes, as I explained, the people of Europe do have a say in \nall of the EU laws - each and every one - through their MEPs. The \nCommissioners - what you are talking about when you mention the officials \nnot directly elected by the people - do not fulfill the role of legislator \nand are rather policy-makers and administrative oversight. This might be \nunfamiliar to the role of a politician as you understand from Westminster, \nMaybe if you read up on what their day-to-day roles are you would realise \nthat the idea that they are a threat to democracy is nonsense.\n\nYes, some vacuum cleaners and light bulbs have become subject to EU-wide \nlegislation. This would, in all likelihood, have happened at the UK level \neventually. It would have taken more time because the UK government is \nslower with this type of legislation, and more environmental damage would \nhave been done. You do realise, also, that this legislation is \nenvironmentally - an economically - beneficial, right? Can't see a negative \nargument here.\n\nCameron is promising the referendum for political reasons. The people speak \nand those in power do actually have to listen, even if they disagree, which \nCameron does. This does not mean it is a good idea. It does not even mean \nit is close to a good idea. It certainly does not, somehow, mean it is a \ngood idea for the people, as you argue. If you leave the EU you will see, \nor you will keep blaming the UK's problems on things which don't actually \ncause them, like 'illegals'.",

It's just that individual \nnations have individual interest, and sometimes they simply do no want what \nthe rest of the majority wants. Since the EU still is sort of an \ninter-state agreement union, you need consensus in order to decide anything \n(unless it's an area where the states have already given mandate for the \nEU-parliament to decide on). So, as a result, you get opt-outs: states will \nvote for stuff they don't want if they get they option to opt-out of them. \nHence, the never-ending asterisks and exceptions to treaties and rules.\n\n\nThe only way to fix this, to make straightforward laws, would be to create \na federation, like in the US. But then the EU-states would cease to be \nindividual states, and that's not something most people want.",

The fact that is policies have \nbeen so successful should be a source of inspiration and not jealousy for \nother states-Greece for example would benefit much from the kinds of labour \nmarket reforms, privatisation and taxation policy Germany employed and \ncontinues to employ.",

While they have a whole manifesto, the only reason they \nare popular is because of the EU and immigrants. There is no other reason.\n\nBesides, I have another issue with UKIP in the way that it says it has \n'policies for the people'. Are these British people? Are these people who \nlive in Britain? Then why does he want immigrants out Britain? Is it being \nborn in Britain? Then why does he use arguments based in the number of \nforeigner in a region? Is it being British by blood? I have (without \nmeaning to boast, as I do not consider this a superiority nor thing to be \nproud of) English blood pure to the 1600s running in my veins. Does this \nmake me more British than others? Then why do I oppose UKIP? Is it speaking \nEnglish? Why oppose those who do who are foreigners? Is it not being white \nor Christian? Then why not full borders to, per say, America, or Canada? I \nfind contradictions and vagueness in his ideas. \n\nThis party is also nationalistic, another issue I have. What makes English \nnationalism superior to, let's say, Polish? Why should we get a better \nposition in this country than the Polish immigrants, who want nothing more \nthan a better life? Why do we deny them that, by locking down our borders \nbased upon out Island Geography. Nationalism is such a contrasting idea of \none ethnicity being superior to another. And this party is based entirely \non 'we are better than them as we have the better country so should get \nmore control over these leeches'. It is not like they come here to \ndeliberately ruin our lives. They come here to enhance theirs. And besides, \nmost even go back to their country after a few years. They want to help \ntheirs and their families, so who are we to deny them that? They want to \nsave themselves from economic stagnation, and we want to not see foreigners \nwalking down the street. They want a better life, and we want out to not be \nslightly worse as those who do want it, are denied. ",

Women instincts can fade and this one probably will, in my country more \nthan 55% of the women population vote on opposition (socialists).\n2. \"europe, a once powerful culture, we counquered the whole world\" ...\n\"Once\" that is the point Europe at its finest was at the 17th , 18th 19th \ncentury...beyond that and the Roman empire, we were not much. What happened \nto Poland and Athen will happen to every other country, it is almost \ncertain that every government will and. Dying under islamization eh? Well \nEuropean population was decreasing because people no longer have 6-8 childs \n(because the majority of the children won't die unlike in older times).\nEuropeans don't \"make\" enough children and therefore we are in need of \nforeigners , refugees (at some parts). But i agree with you, in democracy \nthe \"top of the food chain\" in terms of voting is similiar to \"lower\" ranks \nwhich is not a problem. But most (not all) of the population have less \nwisdom. I can see your points, but other systems could handle this current \nsituation better and if so only a bit better or ways better? (returning to \npoint 1) Also if women can't vote we would be even more closer to \nislamization don't you think?

During that time the EU was deemed a \nresounding success both socially and, to a lesser extent, economically.

This doesnt even \nmention the discovery and colonisation of the new world giving even greater \nwealth, income and now the ability for commoners to own land thus allowing \npopulation growth while not creating excess manpower (keeping the need for \ntechnology in demand).\n\nalso one very important part of European domination which is unrelated to \nthe mongols is competition, China, India and to a lesser extent the middle \neast were basically 1 nation in their respective areas. they had no real \ndesire to expand thus mostly killing any reason to need to advance to gain \nan edge in battle. Europeans on the other hand were at war for 99% of their \nexistence. they managed to create a balance of power (purely through \nrealpolitik not by design) which made none powerful enough to dominate \nwhile forcing them to innovate and invent to try to stay alive.\n\nwhen you combine Competition, rule of law, innovation and a few other minor \nadvantages then you get rapid advancement which when fighting against \nnations that dont have this is equal to domination.\n\nthe thing is that European nations for the most part still have these \ntraits, its possible to make the argument that americans dont when you \nconsider that celebrities get a slap on the wrist when they do drugs and \nnormal people go to prison for life.",

If anything, I think trade \nwould improve by removing barriers which otherwise exist in foreign trade. \nThis is what the EU has done, and has proven successful. If anything, \nforeign trade is a frightening but also exhilarating concept which can \nbenefit economies, but also destroy them due to the uncertainty of demand \nand supply outside a Nation.\n\nRegarding languages, seeing that English is becoming more and more popular \nand widely spoken, I don't think it will be a problem. English is very \nversatile and even allows vocabulary of other languages to be used within \nits very context while adhering to English grammar. English grammar as a \nwhole is much simpler than grammar of other languages.\n\nAs for representatives, I think with the merging of various nations we \nwould see the rise in e-democracy such that representatives would be \nelected online and proportional to a certain number of individuals. There's \nnothing wrong with 1 representative; or two; or a hundred, and thousands if \nneeded. What's important is that people are being represented in Congress \nby someone whom they've elected to communicate their thoughts of any matter \ntherein.\n\nAs for hierarchy of power, I think having presidents/PMs or whomever is \nhead of government of their State to be able to elect a Chancellor of a \nFederation. Aye, e-democracy might just put an end to physical elections \nand so might be held online, thus it may be so such a powerful position \ncould be directly elected by the people or elected through their heads of \nstate.\n\nFinally, ties would never be broken. Infact, a Commonwealth would become \nbetter integrated into a Federation since having a loose union of \nCommonwealth Nations does constitute as a Confederation insofar that its \nevolution to a Federation allows it to enjoy much or greater powers within \nsuch a framework as detailed by any ratified Constitution thereof.

I can explain it only briefly. \nit's entirely possible to have a monetary union without any sort of fiscal \nexchange. the theory is simple. if you can't adjust exchange rates and \ninflation because there are no exchange rates within a currency and the \ninflation is managed by economic principles and not political agendas, you \nsimply adjust different economies by the price of labor and goods. it's \nthat simple. if the greeks are only half as productive as germans they only \nget half their wages. right now they think they are entitled to more \nbecause of the debt fueled boom but sooner or later people will work for \nless pay and the economy will be competitive again and the prices for goods \nwill drop. also the prices for flats and houses, everything really. there \nis no need to screw around with anything. the marked takes care of that. \nyou can't make a single argument why greece and germany can't have one \ncurrency. there is none. but when the greeks fuck up their economy (like \nthey did a lot over the centuries) then they will fail. nothing to do with \nthe euro or the theory.\n3. if france falls into a recession the euro would hardly drop, but even if \nit would drop a lot, it would be good for greece and spain. yes they have \nan imbalance and they are net importers but a weak euro would be perfect \nfor them. they would gain competitiveness and their products would be \ncheaper. so either way it makes hardly a difference because pros and cons \ncancel each other out. cheaper imports or cheaper exports. doesn't matter \nthat much.\n\nlook, there is no real value in screwing around with exchange rates, \ninflation and any of that. the theories all say that inflation at 2% \npercent is a one fits all standard and politics only gets in the way. so \nthe euro is prefect for keeping short lived political ambitions out and \neconomic need in. the money supply is provided by central banks and they \ndon't care about how many countries are there or how their economies are \ndoing. that has no implications for them. you can't name a single one. \ncentral banks adjust by looking at what is there (money in it's various \nforms) at the moment and one currency is as good as the next, no matter the \namount of countries involved. it's like london and the midlands.  they \nshare the pound but the BoE still adjusts only according to one indicator, \nthe amount of money.\n4. a budged is vastly different from the pure economics. run a deficit or \nnot. simply adjust taxes or spending. that's almost purely political. you \ncan build less new roads and spend less on pensioners or the military. you \ncan raise taxes by 2% without doing any harm to the economy. if france \ndidn't want to run a deficit, they could get their act together. the franc \nwouldn't save them in this situation either and the euro is not the \nproblem. \n5. the pound is stronger so what? do you think the value of 1 in any \ncurrency matters? the pound was stronger the day the euro was created and \nthe exchange rates didn't change much. didn't you read my comment or don't \nyou understand that? if the exchange rates had changed massively without \nthe economies reflecting this, that would be notable. but nothing changed. \nthat just shows that the UK could have joined the euro in 2001 and nothing \nwould be different. they could tie the pound to the euro (almost the chase \nanyway)  with a fixed exchange mechanism and this time around it would work \nwithout political interference.",

That's a huge issue and it has everything to do with Greece \nlacking heavy industry. The best thing you can help us with right now would \nbe in recreating this industry. Not only would there be more jobs, there \nwould be far more exports and far fewer imports, which means a far stronger \neconomy. Is this not what you want for us? Oh and NOW you choose to be \nconcerned about Greek well-being? I thought you didn't give a fuck about \nthat 25% that's starving in the streets and rioting. Or maybe you're just \nconcerned about your favorite holiday spots being sullied by icky \nfactories? I'm no psychic man.\nWe don't give a fuck about what you agreed to in the nineties, you declared \nwar on us, you took loans from us, and now we want our fucking money back \nso that we can give it right back to you to pay for some of the debt.\n\nDude, we can't read your fucking minds. How are we supposed to know you \nwant us to put in that proposed bill? Oh, wait, no. I know what you want us \nto put in those bills! \"No pensions, no gifts, no salaries, I don't give a \nfuck if you have a family, go kill yourself if you don't like it, you're \nfired, if you're not working for Gov. you'll be fired soon enough because \nwe're cutting all funding now pay me more taxes.\". Did I get that right? \nProblem with that idea though is, we're not masochists over here despite \nwhat you may have heard. We don't like dying and being homeless.\nWhy is supervision not an option? If you don't trust at all like you're \nsaying then why isn't supervision an option?

Usually, yachts are only truly sailworthy and useful in the warm \nsummer season.

Ever \nheard of Pavlov and his dog?\nI am not aware of any such begging politicians, I didn't vote for them and \nI can assure you they don't represent the Greek majority, though they might \nbe representing that 25% of our 11-million-people-strong nation that's \ncurrently unemployed and starving, which consists mostly of generation X \nand Y younglings that came to be in this situation due to absolutely no \nfault of their own. I have no clue why you're choosing to put all of them \nin the same fucking boat as Papandreou and Tsipras.\nThe drachma might increase our debt superficially but at least it will give \nus the fucking freedom we need to develop a real, self-reliant economy. \nThat's the root issue of Greece as a country. European legislature is \noppressive to no fucking end on the economic level and not being able to \ncontrol our own currency and being trapped with such an unbelievably \npowerful coin makes internation competition incredibly hard for us. Sure, \nin hindsight the eurozone was a very bad decision for Greece, but we the \npeople had no knowledge of our true situation in order to make the proper \nand informed choice in the first place.\nYou're wrong on our current government, it is in every way superior to our \nprevious coalition. The right-wingers of 2012's New Democracy were corrupt \nto no end and equally as responsible for our current state as PASOK. Both \nof the parties in the new government are brand-spanking-new, and the new \nright-wingers are more to the libertarian right than New Democracy ever \nwas, which makes them perfect for economic developement. Plus, the new \nleftist party is only leftist on social and environnemental issues for the \nmost part, they aren't socialists like PASOK nor technically are they \ncommunists.\nAs for the rest of your comment, you make far too many assiumptions, though \nI do agree that you Europeans should have some say and supervision over \nWHERE and HOW our government spends your loan money, but not IF. Personally \nI believe that business subsidisation for local large and upcoming \nimportant corporations is a must in order to revitalise Greek industry. \nNormally I am a centrist and I oppose such ideas, however in extreme \nscenarios extreme measures are necessary.\nAlso, tell England to sell us back the tourist destinations they STOLE from \nus centuries ago, like the ruins of ancient Knossos in my home island.

Culturally, religiously and historical we are \nthe same people coming from the same source. The differences between south \nand north or west and east are caused by economical or climatic issues but \nthis is not such a big deal for anyone. We are historically tied and no \nmatter if you want it or not, we will stay for a very long term. I was \ntraveling a lot and I'm going to tell you the example from my own \nexperience. I was in the French Polynesia and on one of the islands we \nwere, we had plenty of people from different corners of the world living in \nthe one hotel and areas around, Portuguese, Spaniards, Irish, Germans, \nIndians, Australians, Americans etc. etc. We were forming groups, you know \npeople tend to form various groups, and those Portuguese, Spaniards and \nrest of Europeans had extremely massive problem with dealing with Indians \nor natives. We automatically found ourselves different then them and tried \nto stay close together. Guess where did this phenomenon come from? We form \na community here, in Europe, its our home and at home you find everyone \ndifferent, everybody wishes to be special and separated, it is natural, but \nthere, abroad, we realise that we are the same and not as different as, for \ninstance, Chinese with Australian. I could give you a dozen of other \nexamples and show you a historical background why it works in that way but \nit would take time. We have to understand that we share more similarities \nthen differences, and yes, we are different, everyone must be different but \nit's not because of the borderline of the state but because people try to \ncreate something new, every region has its own culture in fact but this is \na small amount of differences in comparison with similarities and the model \nof behaviour of European Civilisation. The main problem we have these days \nis that we have to pay for the XIX and XX centuries and their nationalistic \nand in some extend revolutionary disaster. The disaster which was a tool \nfor monarchs and leaders and made us different in mental perception of \nstate. I'm not even trying to change the people aged above 40 and their \nlife philosophy, therefore, their romantic view on the state but we need to \naccomplish this chapter of history and go further with a new generation, \nfuture is our course not the past.

Their own rules and regulations are being sent around \nevery country and its taking away the soul of what that said country has \nbuilt up through the years.\n\nIf my opinion is so wrong then why is it shared with so many other people? \nNot just in Britain but other nations too, especially Scandinavian \ncountries. Having Economic growth isn't anything to be singing and dancing \nabout if its the only thing thats good about the EU. This could easily \ncrash in the few months.",

The people are perfectly fine you think one \nreally small rebel group is the entire population.And if anyone was doing \nterrible things it was the Northern Irish Gov (note WAS I've no doubt that \nthe Northern Irish of today are good people) and the Northern Irish Police \nseeing as they killed unarmed protesters (who were protesting about Human \nrights which was ridiculous they should have been given their rights.) on \npurpose while the IRA's main objective was not to kill but to put fear into \nthe people to give back their land (not actually give it back but have it \nin the hands of the Irish Government).\n To the IRA the London Underground bombing was a brilliant success killed \nvery little but was a shock to the English. \n\nNow in no way do I defend the actions of the IRA or do I support their \nactions but I do believe they weren't as bad as the Northern Irish \nGovernment and the Police(not in actions but in intentions and again I mean \nthe old N. Irish Gov and police force) and they have a very good reason for \nbeing angry and doing these bombings etc (although it does not justify \nthem).\n\nBut mass executions of the Irish where's your logic all the Irish have ever \ndone is rebelled (because the English couldn't run Ireland right) then \nexited the UK....The UK invaded Ireland Planted it treated the Irish like \nshit and expected them to be perfectly happy :/. And the IRA are a minority \nand the old Unionists were worse (not in actions but in intentions). So \nbasically your posts are completely wrong un-researched and childish.     ",

Also in maintaining religion classes in state \nschools paid obligatory by every taxpayer (also catechists are not \nsubjected to Education Ministry, which means they can teach whatever they \nwant).

Their \nlatest success was taking down comedian, which made fun out of the pope \n(his stand-up was taken off in every public station and from every Internet \npage).\nSo yeah, I acknowledge fact that religion is important, but I don't see any \nbright sides of that.\n\n*Turkey was and never been secular*\n*cough* Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk *cough*\n\n*Islam is a huge danger to democracy and human rights !*\nEvery religion is huge danger to democracy and human rights.\n\n*One of most important things is that women are not equal to men in Islam.*\nQuran says:\n*A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.

Give me a paragraph about that from turkish criminal law that says \nI can hit a women.\n\n*Quran was writen by one man, and is fullfied with set of commands !*\n*cough* The Ten Commandments... *cough*\n\n*Islam has more political and millitaristic values than religious.*\nSooo... islam is militaristic, political religion that controls nothing \nmore than desert and their law applies only to their countries, when \npeaceful christianity controls 4 continents, 100 years ago controlled \nalmost whole planet, and law and politics of christian countries are basic \nof every country on Earth. Thanks god christianity is not religion of \nconquest, but religion of peace!\n\n*While atheist lobby is fighting against Christianity, Muslims are flooding \nEurope.*\n... and only 30% of muslims say that religion is important in their life. \nThat gives us 70% of muslims that are totally asimilated and secular.",

Religion is nothing but mind control and keeping people in line. \n\nI insulted your comments and attitude towards a whole religion and \ncommunity. I didn't insult you personally. I am a Turk and I know first \nhand how bad Islam is, but it isn't what you make it seem to be. I don't \nwant even one person to be misinformed because of one of thousands of \ncomments, just like your last one, that presents a biased view. We can't \nact like Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the same country just because they \nhave a Muslim majority. Also if you ever call Turkey \"Islamic\" you will \ninsult so many people. Personally that word was what got me angry in the \nfirst place. If you know a tiny bit about Turkey you will know who Atat\u00fcrk \nis. He saved us from being an Islamic country and we will be forever \ngrateful. Calling Turkey Islamic might be a mistake but it is no less of an \ninsult than any of the ones I used. ",

And I wouldn't say \nthat the Scots \"are ruled by foreigners\" whilst in the Union. In fact, \nthey've had a disproportionate influence. Off the top of my head - Blair, \nBrown, Reid, Darling, Dewar, Alexander, Cook, and on it goes. Even \nCameron claims Scottish ancestry. And a fine mess they've gotten us into! \nThe promise by Cameron of a referendum (sense of deja vu here for some \nreason) is, if memory serves, based on him being PM after the next \nelection, not on the Tories winning it. Get out of jail free card if ever I \nsaw one. He has broken practically every manifesto pledge he made, and is \nsimply not to be trusted. His party is collapsing under him.

Scotland will \nhave to apply for membership because it will be a new state.\n\nYou sound somewhat hostile to the idea of Scottish independence, but don't \nyou think that contradicts your belief in the independence of nation \nstates? If you think Britain should be independent of the EU, why shouldn't \nScotland be independent of the UK? You can't tell me people shouldn't be \n'ruled by foreigners', yet claim the Scots should remain in a political \nunion with the English, Welsh and Northern Irish.\n\nIn my opinion the economic difference made to Scotland will be minor - \nbased on what I know, there will probably be slight economic difficulties \nto begin with but Scotland will likely soon prosper. If they use their oil \nto create a sovereign wealth fund like Norway they could become very rich. \nMost importantly, they'll be able to set their own policy decisions and \nmaintain access to the EU's markets, which the UK may leave.\n\nI personally would prefer they stay in the UK for now, but I can understand \nwhy they want to go. In the long-term I think it would be good for England, \nWales and Scotland to be separate states with more powers over their own \naffairs (Northern Ireland is more complicated) within a wider European \nfederation. The UK is far too centralized, even with devolution.\n\nWe will be getting a referendum in 2017 - Cameron has promised one, and I \nreckon Labor will at some point too as it could steal the 2015 election for \nthem given the unpopularity of the coalition partners and the rise of UKIP. \nThe only reason we haven't had a vote since 1975 is because the issue \nhasn't been as prominent as it is today.

It's like \nsaying a Victoria Sponge isn't a cake - we fit the criteria down to every \ndetail. I think we could put the European interest first if we were a \nlittle more brotherly and egalitarian-minded towards our cousins on the \ncontinent.\n\nI don't see how being in a union with the rest of Europe affects our \nfreedom. We weren't exactly free men in the days before democracy when we \nwere ruled by monarchs, aristocrats, the land-owning gentry and the Church \nin a heavily stratified class-based society of rulers and peasants - yet we \nwere independent.\n\nThe size of a state is irrelevant; its nature is what matters. Henry the \nVIII ruled a small country but he did so as a tyrant with an iron fist. \nBarack Obama leads a huge nation yet is relatively humane and his powers \nare limited.\n\nI don't see how it affects our culture or identity either. Like I said \nearlier, has being British made you feel any less English? If so, is that a \nbad thing? If not, why do you fear Europe taking away your identity when \nBritain hasn't? There is no reason for us to stop speaking English or \nanything like that.\n\nHell, our culture is more Americanized these days anyway. Culture is \nbecoming increasingly obsolete as globalisation and individualism take \nprecedence, and overall I think that's a good thing. Culture is often a \nkind of social tyranny - for example think of how women in the Middle East \nare treated - getting rid of culture gives people more choice and more \nfreedom, and enables them to question unjust traditions.\n\nI don't buy the idea that we've always had to fight to defend our freedom. \nIn pretty much all major wars we fought, from Napoleon to WW2, we were the \nones who declared war on our enemies. We probably could've stayed out of \nthem and filled the English Channel with warships, yet we intervened for \neconomic and imperialistic reasons.\n\nRegardless, that is history now. I'd rather we not live in the past, \nespecially since the past was pretty awful for the average Briton. I don't \nthink freedom has been a big thing here in the past - true democracy is \nfairly new in Britain, and for the last 300 years we were focused more on \nglobal imperialism - i.e. taking away other people's freedom.\n\nIt's good that we've turned away from that and given our own citizens power \nand rights, but let's not pretend freedom was an integral part of our \nculture. We are not Americans - our history is one of much oppression. \nAgain, we didn't even have human right until we signed up to the ECHR \n(European Convention on Human Rights).\n\n'Better red that dead' - that's actually my thoughts exactly. I don't want \nEurope to be dominated by Russia, China and the US. I want us to be free \nand independent. We're too small and insignificant on our own to achieve \nthat, and the common interest binds us Europeans together.\n\nIt will increasingly be an issue as a growing China, declining US and \nresurgent Russia wage a new Cold War for influence. The EU will be a part \nof that, with or without the UK, and in the latter case we will end up as a \nvassal to either the US or the EU. Without the EU, Europe will be at the \nmercy of these superpowers.\n\nBeing part of Europe is only handing over our country to 'foreign control' \nif you view Europeans as 'foreign'. I don't see them this way; I feel we \nhave shared interests and a shared European identity, in particular amongst \nyounger Europeans. We are not living in 1939 anymore; the world has moved \non a great deal!\n\nBear in mind a huge number of people working in EU intuitions are British, \nand one of the three most powerful voices in the Union is British (David \nCameron). Scottish, Irish and Welshmen are also 'foreigners' to the English \nwhether or not you see them that way.\n\nThat doesn't meant we can't have a shared identity and work together for \nthe common good, while maintaining our unique culture and values (although \nas I said I personally dislike the concept of culture, as your viewpoint \nshows it is needlessly divisive).\n\nThe way Britain functions is evidence enough that Europe can too, and as \nthe common interest becomes stronger it will become inevitable just as the \nbuilding of the UK was. Europe will be united just as India was, and that \nis just as culturally and ethnically diverse as Europe. As is China.\n\nI don't see other Europeans as foreign to me, just as I don't see Scotsman \nas foreign. I know they both are on some level, but I don't care. I am \nEnglish, I am British and I am European. I like being part of all of these \nsocieties. My attitude to the EU is the same as Cameron's to the UK - \n'better together.'

That resonated with me because in my mind this is about more \nthan just economics or trade and the like, however important these \nthings are. It's visceral. From Trafalgar to Waterloo, from the Armada to \nthe two World Wars, Brits have had to fight and die to keep these islands \nfree from continental dominance.

We also place freedom above almost all else, possibly because \nwe've had to fight so often to keep it.

                    "text": "+dunholm1\nI know this is a late reply - sorry about that - but I will address your \npoints as best I can.\n\nPower in the EU is mostly held by the European Council - the elected heads \nof government of the member states. They decide the policies and set the \nagenda for the Union. The Commission simply implements their decisions - it \nis no different to how the UK civil service implements government policy. \nthey too are unelected, as our our Lords (and our monarch). The European \nParliament votes on every law, so our representatives make the law. It \ndecides on the EU budget. The Parliament also approves the Commission, and \nhas the power to remove them from office. It could do with some more powers \n- initiating laws would be one - and ideally the Commission should be made \nup of sitting MEPs.\n\nThese things will happen as the EU evolves from a mere economic union into \na proper federation; right now as member states have most of the power, the \ndemocratic deficit isn't too problematic (though it is increasingly an \nissue as the EU receives more powers). If the EU had the powers of a \nnational government it would be fair to say it was too unaccountable, but \nright now the scope of its power is very limited. Any criticism of the EU \ncould be levied at any other international organization with some degree of \npower, like the IMF or NATO.\n\nI think most people would argue for decentralized power wherever it is \napplicable, but what I care about more than anything is the rights and \nfreedoms of the individual. A large centralized government isn't \nnecessarily a bad thing - just look at the US. It is a federation of 50 \nstates, each comparable to a European nation, with a population of \n300,000,000 people. They are generally a free, prosperous people and they \nalmost all support federalism and unity. Why can't we have that? Why can't \nwe reap the rewards they reap without descending into some kind of \ntotalitarian regime? Europeans are not keen on totalitarian regimes as the \nRussians or Chinese are.\n\nThe US federal government is not as strong as, say, the UK government. The \nstates manage most of their affairs, and I see no reason for Europe to do \nthings differently. Less centralized power can be a bad thing for the \npeople; for example, without federal laws protecting minorities many states \nwould ban things like homosexuality or interracial marriages. There would \nbe legal segregation, atheists and minority religions would be \ndiscriminated against, reproductive rights for women would be outlawed. The \nUS federal government protects people from state tyranny. Let's not forget \nthat the UK had no human rights legislation before we adopted the ECHR.\n\nI don't see centralized power as tantamount to dictatorship because of the \nmany examples where it clearly isn't, and the important thing to bare in \nmind is scale. The EU may be a bigger beast than the UK, but the European \npeople are a much bigger collective than the British people. Bare in mind \nthe fact that a centralized EU government is never going to be a heavily \ncentralized government of a unitary European superstate like China - it \nwill be at best a loose federation like the US. It will be democratic, \ncapitalist and the people will be free. Otherwise it will collapse. No \ncountry in the Union wants a dictatorship so why would they build one? Why \nwould they surrender power to it? They want what America has, nothing more. \nLet's not forget the UK is a union of countries, and not even a federation \n- we are a unitary state. Yet we are not a totalitarian state.\n\nChurchill advocated a United States of Europe passionately, and while it's \ntrue that he spoke of Britain being separate from it, this was back when we \nstill had the Empire. Churchill thought the Empire could survive the post \nWW2 era but he was wrong - it collapsed, and we ceased to be a great power \nlike the US or USSR. Since those days, Britain's interests have been less \nour own and more so in line with the rest of Europe. It is only interests \nboth corporate and geopolitical injected into this country by the US that \nmake us different, and these aren't our interests - they are Uncle Sam's \ninterests.\n\nIt's not fair to say that the UK has no influence in the Union. We are one \nof the Big Three, and we decide a great deal of policy. Often we hold the \ndeciding balance of power, as we tend to side with Germany more on \neconomics and France on geopolitics. They often oppose each other on these \nissues.\n\nMuch of the EU's financial policies and regulations were British \nsuggestions, and the idea of expanding the Union to Eastern Europe was a \nresult of British pressure. France and Germany wanted the Union to be made \nup of just rich Western states for a more stable federal union, while the \nUK wanted the EU to gobble up Eastern Europe to undermine Russia's \ninfluence, expand capitalism and please the US by growing NATO. We also \nthought the Eastern states would destabilize the EU and thus slow things \ndown, preventing federalism. That's why we're still banging on about Turkey \njoining - it would but the final nail in the federal coffin.\n\nThe UK has had a lot more influence than people realize because our media \nis very hostile to the EU and focuses on all the negative aspects, real or \nimagined.  British farmers do well out of the CAP but it is something that \ncould do with reform. The moving of the Parliament is universally unpopular \nacross the Union - even the people of France think its stupid - I don't \nthink it will last. It's a trivial thing really; we could equally complain \nabout all the money wasted in the UK on the monarchy for it's pointless \nsymbolism.\n\nLet's just say hypothetically the EU is a federal state, like the US. It is \nas free and democratic as the US - perhaps more so - and the whole Union is \nrelatively prosperous. Would you be in favor of that? If not I want to know \nwhy, because I often hear criticism of the EU as it is today (much of it \nlegitimate, and concerns I share), but I think the impassioned hostility \nstems more from a rejection of pan-Europeanism, and I want to know why \npeople don't like that concept. I assure you, no Euro-federalist like \nmyself is also pro-dictatorship. We want to reform the EU rather than \ndisband it.",

I want the Parliament to have more \npower, while the current EU leaders (the heads of national governments) \ntake the role of US state governors, focusing on the national politics of \ntheir member states.\n\nWe don't need to cease being Englishmen within Europe anymore than being \nBritish makes us any less English. The flag can stay, the language can stay \n(in fact English would most likely be the main language of the Union), the \nQueen can stay - even the pound can probably stay.\n\nI must stress that I want a loose federation, not a heavily centralized \nunitary superstate. I don't think many people want the latter option. My \nideal would be an even looser union than the US - shared borders, shared \nforeign policy, shared currency, (though we may opt out as we do now) \nshared constitutional rights and a single federal tax to pay for things \nlike defense and EU-wide infrastructure projects. In fact I could support \nsome powers the EU has now being repatriated to national governments (such \nan perhaps environmental policies).\n\nI don't even see federalism as necessarily mandatory for all states - a \ncore federation could exist within a looser two-tier European Union, with \nmember states like the UK and Sweden staying out of the federation but \nremaining in the Union, retaining their currencies, their own taxes and \narmed forced but participating in the single market, a military alliance \nand other shared programs. There are plenty of options for Europe, but \nsticking together and working as a team is what matters.\n\nI can't see a federal union happening without a democratic government like \nthe US. It would be far too unstable - it'd collapse almost immediately. \nThe USSR only managed to stay united for as long as it did because of the \noverwhelming power of Russia (it was basically a continuation of the \nRussian empire), which constituted half the population and economy of the \nSoviet Union, and even then it collapsed. Germany could not keep a far \nlarger totalitarian union together (nor would they have any wish to do so).\n\nPeople often forget that when comparing the EU to the USSR - it's apples to \noranges really. One was a Russian dominated communist empire, the other is \na very loose capitalist union of democratic nations that are much more \nequal in size - even the largest (Germany) makes up only 16% of the total \nEU population. A dictatorship is unwanted and couldn't even hope to \nmaintain stability. The member states realize this, and have no wish to \nsurrender power to a dictatorship anyway.\n\nRight now we are in a position much like the US during the Articles of \nConfederation period (the Eurozone crises in particular resembles the \neconomic hardships of the early looser American union) and we're faced with \nthe need to pursue further integration. But like America (and unlike the \nUSSR), we have the values, the political infrastructure and the will as a \npeople to build a democratic union.\n\nWell, outside the UK anyway. My kind are admittedly a rare breed on these \nfair isles. I do think if we're not going to sign up to the federation we \nwill have to bail out eventually - we can't keep slowing it down for \neveryone else when they want to carry on at a much faster pace. It's not \nfair on us or them.\n\nBut still, I personally believe in the European dream so I'll speak up for \nit as long as it remains a prominent issue in the political sphere of our \ncountry. You must do the same for your vision of our future, because that \nis what free speech is all about. It ensures anyone who believes they have \nthe right idea can share it with the people and see if it can stand up to \npublic scrutiny.\n\nAfter the debate has been had a vote must follow. I do support that, even \nthough I'd expect to lose it. Democracy means you don't always get your \nway, but it's still important to stand up for what you believe in. Sorry to \nbombard you with all my rambling.",

Higher wages make for a higher GDP. Whether or not companies \nmove location as a result depends on a lot of things, not just wages, and \nwhen it comes to wages it depends on how much the increase is. Much of the \nforeign business in Europe is not hugely wage-sensitive.
