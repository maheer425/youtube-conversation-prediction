Tap-dancing Christ, you dense mother fucker.\n\nI have owned an iPod Touch before. iPod Touches are no more secure or \nhack-proof than any other device that can connect to a wireless (or even \nwired) connection. WiFi is hardly different from 3G/4G, due to apps still \ntransmitting data through the provided network. Just because the iPod \ndoesn't connect to WiFi without your consent doesn't mean you can't be \nhacked. Regardless of device, iPods, iPhones, Androids, computers, etc. all \nhave the capability to connect to a network of some sort. Once they do, you \nare vulnerable. Hell, your network in which you are shitposting these \nretarded comments has the chance to be within a hacker's grasp.\n\n\"Apple doesn't have the time to waste your battery on connecting to \"hidden \nnetworks,\" which if an iPod could connect to, then would drain your battery \nand raise question to Apple.\"\n\nApple doesn't care if you complain. Apple just wants money, and lots of it, \nat that. If someone complains, they just say \"Oh, well that's too bad. Try \nbuying another one and maybe your problem will be fixed.\"\n\nBesides the Apple situation, apps are always running in the background, \ndespite your hardest attempts of stopping them. Your iPod's OS is always \nrunning. Your screen is always running. There's even more than you can \ncontrol. Apps you download, again regardless of device, can transmit any \ndata through any network you provide it. While it may be true that you can \ncontrol the WiFi on your precious iPod, that won't stop hackers from \ngetting in. Bluetooth is one way. By simply getting your iPod's Bluetooth \nID and attempting to connect, they can bypass restrictions and \nnotifications by some clever programming. And yes, iPod Touches have had \nBluetooth since iOS 3.0.\n\nAnything you have to say will probably be asstarded or completely \nirrelevant to anything I, and anyone else for that matter, have just said.",

And once it is connected you cannot control what \ninformation it sends out. \nAlternatively, if you're arguing that wifi can be switched on and off, and \nsince phones are connected to cellular networks (given they have a SIM \ninserted) this makes them more vulnerable to data being transferred without \npermission? Then you're also wrong there. Cellular network can be easily \ndisconnected by enabling airplane mode, removing the SIM etc. Which renders \nthe phone in the same state as an ipod touch, and so no difference bro. \nThought I'd point that out, hope I helped",

Thinking your ipod touch is safe simply because you can 'turn off \nthe wifi' is a simple matter of blissful ignorance.\n\nFor years (at least as far back as 2009 and earlier) the NSA has been \nimplanting software and hardware into our electronics (laptops, \nsmartphones, and anything else with wifi or other connectivity options \nwhich includes ipod touches since they have wifi) that let them do things \nlike turn on your webcam, wifi, etc without you knowing so that they can \nget information from you.  This was proven through documents leaked that \nhad the government so upset.\n\nCoincidentally hackers and other third (or fourth by this point) parties \nhave also found ways to use this same software and hardware for their own \nends.\n\nWhat is even more scary is the fact that even removing the battery isn't \nenough to stop some of this either.\n\nIn the end, the only way to completely remove the possibility of being \nhacked or having your data taken is to not have anything that has any \nconnectivity at all, be it wifi, 3g, 4g, or any network connections.  Is it \npossible your ipod touch is fine?  Sure, its possible.  Is it guaranteed?  \nNot by a long shot.",

Well, I theorize that they \nare in constant communication to avoid a mishap in which one posts a video \nwhich the other was working on, thus making their video null and void. So, \nmy assumption is that a conversation similar to this took place - One calls \nthe other and asks \"So, what are you currently working on?\" the other \nresponds, saying \"Watch_Dogs in real life\" \"Oh, no! I was working on that \ntoo!\" \"Damn, what do we do?\" \"Why don't we both post our videos on the same \nday, and claim it to be a coincidence?\" \"Good idea! Lets do that!\" At which \npoint they both finished off their videos and collaborated the day, hoping \nno one would think it was any more than a coincidence.\n\nBut, hey, that's just a theory. A Youtube Theory! Thanks for reading.\ufeff",

Not to mention your grammar.\nThis reply is some-what directed to the comment - however its also a \ncorrect to anyone curious about this.\n\n1: Anyone can launch a DDOS attack, this is used to an denial of service, \ntypically, an DDOS basically is to flood the server/and or send allot of \ntraffic to one destination, forcing the servers to crash, or in other \nwords, a device.\n\n2: There is no such thing as an \"DDOS weakness\", All systems are capable of \nbeing DDOS'd, its how they counter it, some devices are unable to take \nallot of traffic thus crashing, however other devices (like drones) are \ntypically unaffected by DDOS attacks since they're manned by themselves (AI \nbasically, no internet involved)..\nDrones run on different things, as far as i'm aware (you're welcome to \nprove me wrong) drones run off of GPS signal.\nYou have to jam this signal to take control, which is very hard, then fake \nan well-authentic signal for it to read. (the basic ones).\n\n3: As far as i'm aware police drones don't have weapons, nor do allot of \npolice drones exist or are used, drones that do use weapons are far \nadvanced, which ill talk about next. \n\n4: Its not 123 hackable.. Even the most professional hackers in the WORLD \nare unable to hack drones with weapons.\nWhy? Because they use very good encryption and security, they were \nbasically programmed by professional hackers themselves.\nI'm not saying its impossible, however, the possibilities of some random \nperson doing this will be pretty hard, if anyone does it, it will be \nanother country and their military who is capable of this with advanced \ntechnology and a whole team behind them.\nAlso, not to mention if they're routed LIVE its by GPS, which is connected \nto an military satellite which is monitored by some of the most \nprofessional \"hackers\" in the world, which is also encrypted by them.\n\n5: If you was really a \"white hat hacker\" and was \"helping\" (since drones \nare Government) they wouldn't allow someone to modify their hardware nor \nsoftware, nor is it their current priority as it doesn't effect anyone \ncurrently (and the small cases of drones without weapons being hacked were \nonly by professional hackers).\nNot to mention, again, its GPS routed, so unless there is magically an wifi \ndrone which i'm unaware of with weapons, everything you talk about doesn't \nexist.\n \n\nAgain, not saying its not possible, nor am I say drones haven't been \nhacked, however drones that are manned with weapons etc are not going to be \nhacked by some guy like you who is unable spell the word \"defense\"'.\n\nNot to mention your video's are full of roblox and minecraft, and even in \none of your video's you can see your child-hands, and in another hear you \nspeak which you don't sound older than 14.\nOr referring to your description in one of your videos \"i could really do \nwith the boost to keep on going as school is a pain in the ass\".\nProfessional hacker in school?\nAlthough, to take out some of the seriousness, your animals are really cute \n(in your videos), and you seem like a cool kid, just don't go around say \ndumb things.

                "text": "Okay so what we get from this video is that there is no way in hell you \nwill ever be able to keep your privacy, well... private, in our current \nsociety. Everything you have ever done on the internet, every search \nhistory, every chat log, every password, ever picture, all of it has been \nsaved on multiple databases of varying companies such as Google and \nFacebook and of course the NSA. \nThere is no way to take any of this back. However you can prevent yourself \nfrom sharing any more personal information on the internet and here are \nsome easy tips. \n\n1. Delete your god damn FB account.\nIt's most likely turning you into a depressed narcissist anyway so there's \nno good in keeping it. You might say that you use Facebook to communicate \nwith friends and family but I know that you know that it's just not the \nsame as interacting with them in real life.\nSo go ahead and delete that bitch right now.\n\n2.Delete all other internet accounts.\nDoesn't matter if it's PornHub, Google+, Email, Gmail or whatever. Just \ndelete them all.\n\n3. Create a secondary internet personality\nStart of by creating a new Email/Gmail with a false nationality, phone \nnumber, birth date, etc. Feel free to use this gmail to register internet \nwebsites such as Youtube. \n\n4. Use the Tor browser. Tor is a Swedish web browser funded by the Swedish \ngovernment that basically allows you untraceably surf the internet. There \nare however a couple of downsides to this. Firstly your internet speed is \ncrippled. Secondly, flash player doesn't work very well with it so it can \nbe frustrating to watch videos and impossible to watch porn :/ \n\n5.Destroy your cellphone.\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention that if you're dependent on your current email/gmail \nthen you can still keep it.  Just remember to only use accounts connected \nto that email/gmail for stuff that you wouldn't mind someone seeing.\n\n*The following is for the really paranoid types*\n5. Buy an older car that doesn't use computer technology or get a \nmotorcycle. \n\n6. Wear clothing that partially covers your face. \n\n7. Don't allow friends to post pictures of you to FaceBook.\ufeff",
