That's how we got to the big bang theorem - concluding that it all \nmust have come from a single point. Physicists have even concluded the size \nof this single point (around the size of a pea).\nI unsubscribed from minute physics because they aren't very good at \nexplaining anything and they don't seem to understand stuff very well \nthemselves.

Then \nthere are the measurements, called alephs. Aleph-null is the start, then \nyou go to aleph-1, then aleph-2, etc. It's quite interesting, really; you \nshould look it up sometime :)\nThat said, the universe doesn't fall into this, I don't think. However, \nwhen we talk about its expansion, we're just talking about the motion of \nany two points away from each other. It doesn't presuppose a size to the \nuniverse. There's a size to the portion of the universe we can observe, but \nthere's more beyond that. Check out MinutePhysics' video on the Big Bang \nfor a little perspective--it wasn't something that had a center or a \nlocation. It happened everywhere at once, and the expansion continues \neverywhere at once with no center. If we were even just one light-year away \nfrom Earth, our visible universe would now include more of the total \nuniverse than it does now, and there's no reason to suspect that would ever \nstop as we move farther in space. In other words, though we're not sure, \nour best guess is that the universe is, in fact, infinite. Infinite and \ngrowing; which does not make infinity plus 1, it just makes infinity still. \nLike adding the set of irrational numbers to the set of rational numbers.",

They do cancel each \nother out and are often used as treatments, especially when overdosing (for \nexample, naloxone is an opiod antagonist, while many painkillers are opioid \nagonists.

The biggest \nchange is aural, which is a shift in consciousness that reduces the ability \nto perform linear thought (like reading or performing mathematics), and \nincreases the ability to grasp emotional concepts, things that involve \nempathy and perceiving the interconnectedness of life.\n\nThe easiest way to explain it is that it's like the emotional and spiritual \nbecomes vaguely physical. This can definitely cause discomfort and fear, if \nindividuals are going through emotional stress that they have not \naddressed. That very change in perception can be immensely valuable in \ntaking a step out of the hedge maze to work through complex personal \ntrauma, and is currently being used with success is therapy.\n\n(A true hallucination would be where one was unable to distinguish that \nwhich is real, from that which is not. It's possible to achieve this with \nhigh doses, but this is not recommended for obvious reasons.)\ufeff",

Earlier in the day I was having a conversation with someone \nabout how we can still be listened to and recorded through our phones even \nif  they are switched off. As long as it has a power source, we're \nvulnerable.( It's why you can't remove the battery from an Iphone.)

I was 18 years old, and sooo \nembarassed of that for many years - now Im not. Also, i woried i was gay, \nas u do when only a teen, but I wasnt lol.

Some did help:\n1. Do some quick exercise that strains my whole body, but not as much as to \nbreak a sweat or have muscles hurt. Then I go to bed, and keep my muscles \nstrained, and take deep frequent breaths. Then I relax muscles slowly \nduring 1-2 minutes, reducing the frequency of the breaths. As I slowly \nrelax, I can feel my heart lowering its rhythm, and a lot of the times, \njust after the full relaxation, with my last deep exhalation, I am able to \nfall asleep. Sex would be more efficient at this task, but I won't wake my \nwife in the middle of the night.\n2. My friends advised me, and it works I think, to not do anything 1-2 \nhours before sleep. In \"anything\" I mean work, learning, social media and \nstuff. Nothing that would take you in too much, and nothing that you'll \nwant to finish. During those 1-2 hours maybe even get bored a bit, but just \na bit. They also told me to do more cardio during the day, but for some \nreason I find it harder to fall asleep after the days where I've gone on \nlong bicycle trips.\n\n\"I would be tired during working hours, but somehow wake up after dinner, \nand not be able to sleep until late again. \" - 100% me. Noon is pretty \nnormal for me, but by 2-3PM I can literally fall asleep standing. Immensely \nsleepy. By 5PM I get my productivity up again, then that darn large meal, \nand from 8PM until late night or early morning I can do very cool stuff. \nNaps helped with the immediate condition during afternoon, but later on I \nwouldn't get to my max. productivity. I used to try coffee, but it didn't \nhelp, and only made things worse. Like no effect for 1-2 hours, then \nrestlessness, then a huge crash after which I'm only good for playing \ntimekiller games.\n\nIt's weird though that when I went on vacation, and after a night and half \nday without sleep (landed at midnight, check in at midday), just the second \nday I got my sleep hours from 10PM to 6AM each day without a single \nproblem. No trouble sleeping, no trouble waking up, cheerful during the \nday. So it has something to do with work. Maybe I get sleepy earlier, but \nthis much information and brain stimulation as \"Internet\" keeps me awake. \nBeing that my hotel had worse WiFi than the connection I used to have at \nhome via Dial-up 14 years ago, I was basically offline. So no internet, and \nlots of stuff to do and places to see = good night sleep.",

Go to bed late, wake up late, so \nget to work late, so you have to leave work late, when means you decompress \nlate, and cook late, and eat late, then go to bed late again. You can't \nforce yourself to sleep. I can try to force myself to wake up, but \nproductivity would go way down.

                    "text": "+Donnie  You are normal. Most people aren't susceptible to alcoholism. It \ntakes a ton of alcohol abuse for your body to start developing physical \ndependencies. Alcohol and weed isn't like opiates or nicotine. No, I don't \nthink your friends became dependent after just 10 cigarettes. The problem \nwith cigarette smokers is they tend to want to smoke them all day long. The \nbrain gets used to that and compensates. Meaning, they need the cigarettes \njust to feel normal, and then need more if they want to chase the buzz. \nOccasional tobacco use doesn't cause this. You have it once in a while, \nprobably only at night. You brain never learns to compensate and you feel \nnormal without it. Caffeine is the same. You need to drink a significant \namount every day to get addicted. I have a small addiction to caffeine. \nThis only happened once I started having caffeine every day. I could quit \nthe caffeine easy enough. There would be one day that was bad headache and \nirritable. After a week or so things would be normal again. But without \ncaffeine, my terrible sleep habits would catch up with me. I am a night owl \nwith an irregular biological clock. I feel that my clock lasts longer than \n24 hours, and that I am jetlagged almost every day. When I quit caffeine it \ndoesn't fix these problems. There are people addicted to caffeine way worse \nthan me. All I need is a couple Pepsi Max per day. Really only need one, \nbut prefer two. That's only like one cup of coffee per day. Addiction goes \nwith dependence and withdrawal. You never had dependence or withdrawal, so \nyou never got addicted. The problem is when people use drugs to try to \nsolve problems. Then they to quit, go through some withdrawal from mild to \nhorrible, and their problems come back. If they don't find a real solution \nto their problems, they go back to the drug that helped them. The problem \nis that drugs eventually just cause more problems, and they stop actually \nhelping you with your problems. The only permanent solution to my sleeping \nproblem is massive lifestyle adjustments. That would require a different \ncareer, one in which I could set my own hours and work mostly at night. \nWould also have to find friends and a wife that is compatible with this \nlifestyle. This is an unacceptable solution for me, although it works fine \nfor some people. I'd rather have to drink caffeine then give up my dream \ncareer and the hope for a normal life.",

I was curious if it's normal to not be an alcoholic after I used \nto drink much more, and more often. And most of my friends who smoke, \nbecame dependent on tobacco after just ~10 small cigarettes, while I once \nsmoked 2 loaded pipes within a week, without a filter, with pure tobacco, \nand didn't get any long-lasting effects.\nI just don't experience what others do with substances. I can't understand \nmy wife's feelings when she smells a freshly opened pack of coffee (she \ndescribes it almost like an orgasm). I can't understand how can anyone eat \nmore than enough, why would anyone be addicted to alcohol, and so on. I \ndon't understand any addiction besides thought stimulation, like games, or \nsolving problems.\nThis is just out of curiosity - maybe it's a condition which is documented. \nNot like a disease condition (because I guess I'm fine with how things \nare), but rather something that would let me know, whether it's ME who's \ndifferent, or what I do is what's different.",

Cannabis has two \npredominant active substances, CannaBiDiol and TetraHydraCannabinol. CBD is \na substance, which mostly enchance your body functions - increase blood \nvessel pressure and enchances metabolism, causing buffed-up perception and \nfunctions of endocrine system, while also causing a spontant feel of \nhunger, due to the overtaxed hydrocarbon usage by the aforementioned \nprocesses. THC on the other hand is a purely psychoactive substance, which \naffects the imagination and creativity, bringing the feel of excitement and \neuphoria, suggestivity to ideas and overall pumped up neural function, \nwhile in turn can cause very selective long-term memory function and \nanxiety/paranoia if affected person has not prepared the friendly \nenvironment.\n\nNicotine is in many terms carries the opposite effect of the Cannabis. It \nstimulates focus, caution and psychical restraint. It reduces blood \npressure, inhibits emotions, stress signals, and makes you overall more \ntimid. Muscle functions are also depressed and it's much harder to make \nphysical work or excercises after a cigarette. It inhibits the metabolism, \neasing pain and reducing feeling of hunger, but also makes you feeling your \nbody colder and constrained. Due to the almost polar difference of these \neffects to the ones CBD and THC manifests, smoking a cigarette soon after a \njoint can neutralize the effect of the latter almost entirely, and \nrepetative cases of such misuse can stress the circulatory system due to \nconstant change of blood pressure and cause headaches, feel of uneasiness \nand depression.",

Steve Jobs praised LSD, and he seemed pretty bright. \nDaily use of cannabis can surely create problems, such as feeling \ndisconnected from the world, crappy short term memory, temporarly lowered \nIQ and more. You will never get shizophrenia from cannabis alone (older \nstudies have suggested that it may increase the risk of getting \nshizophrenia if you have the genes running in your family though), but you \nmay get a psychosis. I really don't get stoners who claim cannabis is \nrisk-free. The risk of getting a psychosis is considered low though. \n\nPartly thanks to the tolerance build, LSD and shrooms are appearently way \nless likely to create a drug induced psychosis or mental health issues \ncompared to cannabis. Pretty interesting considering you can really feel \nlike you are loosing you mind on those drugs. Stoners (especially american \nstoners) seem to be completely oblivious to the fact that cannabis actually \ncomes with risks. It's annoying. \n\nBritish neuropsychopharmacologist David John Nutt did a study on drugs and \nharm and made a list where drugs were ranked after harmfulness.

That's the real \nproblem.... people thinking they NEED extra substances like this because \nthey are powerless to take action and manage themselves, that is ADDICTION. \nTell a doctor you feel anxious or depressed, and they'll offer the meds \ninstead of offering you information about nutrition, exercise, sleep, \nallergies, or psychotherapy. In reality medication should be given in short \nterm periods... all medication has long term side effects, and for even a \nlow dose of Paxil the patient does develop permanent chemical and \nneurological damage resulting in partial paralysis, memory problems, \nchronic pain/numbness, and speech problems. Long term POSITIVE effects on \nthe brain can be achieved through diet, exercise, changing sleep patterns, \nchanging lifestyles, cognitive therapy, meditation, and psychotherapy.

And anybody \nreading this stuff should not immediately go off their meds, because the \nwithdrawal can be dangerous and the real damage of the drug (it actually \nmasks itself) will be noticeable.

The first thing \nyou'll notice is a lag/drag effect on moving objects, especially those \nclosest to you e.g. your hand. It's pretty neat and mesmerizing. That same \ntype of rippling also happens to sounds sometimes. If you happen to have \naccess to the Hendrix poster with the paint splats in the background it is \nmost excellent to look at when in the zone. When I did it it was flying \njust off the wall like a magic carpet. The total effect lasts about twelve \nhours, so you must be prepared for that duration, it includes both the \nupswing and the downswing. All in all you might feel a little bummed for a \nfew days after, but that is just from the sheer jubilation that the LSD \ncauses while you do it.WARNING: THERE ARE VERY LOUD CLOCKS THAT BEGIN \nRINGING FOR A WHILE DURING DARK SIDE, DON'T FREAK OUT.",

Imagine you're aware of what's going on around \nyou, but you just have very little control over your body. In the case of \nhypnosis, you may want to move, but you're just...too relaxed, so no matter \nwhat, you can't seem to move. It's as though your brain and your body have \ndisconnected--what you want to do is not what you actually do. In addition, \nthough you're aware of most things around you, your sense of time is \naltered--what may feel like minutes can actually last hours. In normal \nmeditation, it's similar, though it's much easier to be \"snapped out of it\".\n\nThe exact opposite type of dissociation occurs in a panic attack. Rather \nthan being too relaxed to do anything, you're instead too wound up to do \nwhat you want. You often realize you're having an attack, but that doesn't \nstop you from saying or doing things you don't want to anyway. You may \nscream, or punch things, or cry; you may start telling yourself or anyone \naround that you're contemplating suicide, even if you're not actually. You \nmay run from something that you truly want to be part of. All sorts of \nthings. And only once you've calmed down do you regain control.\n\nSo in essence, losing your sense of self is just the feeling you get when \nwhat you WANT to do isn't what you ACTUALLY do, even as you're realizing \nit's happening in the moment. When you can't seem to control your actions. \nThe most accurate description I can think of is the way I used to describe \nmy panic attacks to my ex: it's like you have multiple personalities, \nexcept they all claim to be you and you remember everything they do. Which \nis actually a more accurate description than it seems at first, because \nfrom what I understand, multiple personality disorder is actually a severe \nform of dissociation (hence the modern name for it, dissociative identity \ndisorder).",

In the few flashes \nthat I do remember, I had no identity, personality, life memories, or \nhigher cognitive functions. From the outside, what those around me had \nwitnessed, I was upright, able to respond to commands, answer questions \n(usually incorrectly), and sat babbling incoherently for a while. Totally \nawake, but totally not 'present' or aware of myself or able to process the \nsituation.\n\nThat's extreme though.

He comically \nmistranslates the feather in his hat as \"macaroni.\"\n\nDoodle got shortened to dood, and then a misspelling \"dude\" took precedence.\n\nSometimes people on the internet say \"dood\" or \"d00d\" to be ironic. But the \ntrue irony is that they're closer to the original spelling.\n\nLanguage is a storm that never ends, and the second longest-running storm \nin the solar system (next to the one on Jupiter).\n\nDon't know why I felt the need to say all that.",
