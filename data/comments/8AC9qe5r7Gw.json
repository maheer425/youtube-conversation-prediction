                "text": "Wow, crazy episode. Then again, practically all Bravest Warriors episodes \nstart out halfway through a story/mission, and it's up to the viewers to \nfigure out what happened before that and/or use our imaginations. It's kind \nof odd that Plum has come back from practically out of nowhere. Last I \nremember, she kissed Chris, took that magical peach pit in his head that \ngave him x-ray vision, broke it, and showed a reference to knowing \nsomething about the Emotion Lord/future Chris before swimming off. I feel \nsorry for Danny. Both him and Wallow should have love interests. It can't \njust be Chris and Beth as the only couple in this series. However, it was \nnice to see that Danny has a cute sliced bread-making creature friend, who \nI hope will bring him a lot of joy.\ufeff",
