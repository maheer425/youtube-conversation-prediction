I don't believe any Big Bang Theory, I can only say that I think \nit's the most current believable source, and just like how you entrust a \nbook that was wrote by a bunch of old men, the Big Bang theory was \nassembled by many many scientists, after several experiments, laws and \ntheories combined. . The man stated, \"it's not religion that creates \nnutjobs,\" well it would appear that the members of my family who were \nraised in very Christian households and still hold true to those Christian \nstandards are very much nutjobs.\nWho fucking cares if I have bad genes, you bringing that up only makes me \ninstantly think you're some neo-nazi which only helps my case that you are \na nutjob.",

Eventually you might get educated enough to realize it's not beliefs \nthat make someone intelligent, it's them as a human being.\n\nYou're obviously not stemming very high up the gene pool by the looks of \nthings.",

Everywhere I go all I see is atheists attacking the \nreligious, mocking their beliefs, making memes against them, some of them \npretty gruesome consisting of their Jesus being gruesomely hurt and ripped \noff the cross etc, Not to mention youtubers like The amazing atheist, \nJaclynGlenn, The atheist experience. Darkmatter2525. Youtubers dedicating \ntheir time and efforts to attacking the religious and their beliefs. Even \nthat Christian girl that posted a simple video about how her fellow \nChristians should preach Love and tolerance (/watch?v=3YXINEYdnkY) and she \nwas actually bullied off of youtube due to death threats from atheists, \nLiterally messaging her saying they are going to find her and kill her. I \nbarely see any Christians doing anything except defending themselves \nnowadays, If you can't see that you're pretty blind. I'm agnostic so I'm \nimpartial between the two and am not taking sides but I also tell it like \nit is and know what I see with my own two eyes, To defend this kind of \nbehavior just makes you look as bad, This large amount of hatred can't be \njustified and it gets sickening to see such bullying sometimes toward \ninnocent people when they say something as small as \"God bless\" and are met \nwith replies like \"God doesn't exist dipshit\". That one I saw earlier.\n\nI'm not saying you, just the ones I see around youtube essentially, and it \nhurts to say, but it's only getting worse and more sickening in the eyes of \nus who want humanity to move more towards compassion and understanding. My \nfamily is mixed between religious and non religious, My grandfather who is \nreligious recently went overseas to do missionary work and help feed \nstarving children by building greenhouses in the area. I find this much \nmore admirable behavior than what I see from others. Now if I were to say \nevery man involved in the sex slavery ring and child slavery ring is an \natheist thus they are all evil, sick, animals. That would be a \ngeneralization and biased statement. Truth is, neither side is perfect, \nthere is only just people and unjust. Again, I'm not religious, nor am I an \natheist, I remain impartial between the two. I just tell it like it is.",

But if \nyou don't believe in god, stare up at that empty black void and thank the \nuniverse for granting you the chance at life you have in this time of \ncomfort ant technology, but don't act like an idiot saying \"you\" did it \nall.

It says we are all part of the same.  Life is a \nmixture of good and evil and we decide what road we take because we are all \nenergy or a soul (free will).  You could either be positive energy or \nnegative energy.  When you die your soul will either be a positive \nvibration or a negative vibration.  The vibration will determine what \nspiritual level you will associate with when you are dead.  If you are a \nnegative soul you will go where negative souls go.  If you are a positive \nsoul you will go where positive souls go.  If your in between, you are in \nbetween and will probably stay on earth as a (ghost/purgatory).  Following \nthe ten commandments is just good positive behavior.  Following Jesus's \nteaching are just positive behavior.  Jesus is god because Jesus was god \nlike and following him is being as close to the top tier of positive you \ncan get.  So in sum,  I believe you can reach \"heaven,god,Jesus\"  however \nyou want to describe love, light, and compassion is up to the individual. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jesus+was+a+buddhist+monk+bbc+documentary",

Although I believe there to be no god there's no doubt \nthat some people benefit emotionally and in other ways from religion and \nthat's great by me. If having a figure of a god makes them happy and fills \ntheir lives with purpose and hope then I can't say that they shouldn't \nbelieve. I really wish some christian people could, like me, step on \nsomeone's shoes and not make unfair assumptions about our lives and values \nand how we feel as atheists.\n\nIt really makes me feel bad when I get someone from any religion basically \npitying me for not believing. They feel as though something in my life is \nmissing and that there's no possible way that I'm completely happy without \ngod. They are entitled to think what they wish, that is their right and I \nwon't stand in the way of it. Although, I do wish people could understand \nthat the happiness, hope and fulfilment they get from god I get from \nelsewhere, and that's fine. Some people make me feel as though I am \npurposeless and just wandering around life if I don't follow a religion\n\nThe fact that I don't think that my life is ultimately relevant to the \nuniverse and that I'm not going to be eternal doesn't mean that my life is \nnot relevant to myself or that I'm going to live in the limbo after I die. \nIt doesn't mean that without the promise of some sort of Eden I'll be a bad \nperson. I'm a good person and have values because I understand suffering \nand that's not something I could possibly wish upon anyone. I love every \nsingle person and understand that everyone is a complex human being that \ncan't be labeled as good or bad. I believe we're all made up of chemicals \nand experiences that make us the people we are. And my belief shouldn't \ntrouble anyone, the same way other people's beliefs don't trouble me.\ufeff",

Both Eleanor and I have stated that we are open to the \npossibility. The issue is the claim of knowledge regarding the nature of \nthis designer or any claim that this designer has a substantive role in its \ncreation. What's to say that the designer didn't create the earth and \nhumanity and then move on to bigger and better things? Christians think \nthey know, muslims think they know, hindu's think they know; atheists think \nyou're all full of shit.\n\n+Kwame Cudjoe \nYou are not getting your morality from a \"god\" either; you're getting it \nfrom a book written and intended as humanity's first attempt at a civil \nsystem of law. Many (most) of the rules written in that book applied \ndirectly to the time period in which they were written (such as rules on \nrape) but are no longer applicable in today's society. BTW, morality \nexisted in various forms long before the bible was ever written; it is \nresponsible for human survival for the first 200,000 years on earth (just \nbecause the rules weren't written, doesn't mean they didn't exist). \nFurther, we are not looking for \"absolute morality\" because the ONLY way \nfor such a construct to exist would be within an extremely strict \ncommunistic state. As long as we enjoy freedom, absolute morality will \nnever exist outside of the delusional thoughts of the religious (sorry if \nthat sounds rude but please consider the premise).\n\n+BeautyTrio\nTo claim to walk into buildings based upon faith illustrates a tremendous \nlack of understanding of human motivation. People inside of the WTC jumped \nto their deaths as the building behind them perished; this was not faith, \nit was a conscious decision to choose their mode of demise. You walk across \nbridges not because you have faith in the builders but because you need to \nget to the other side of the bridge. Further, I'm sorry that you CAN'T 't \nfathom existence without a creator but more sorry that you CAN fathom \nexistence with one. Neither premise is within the realm of human \nunderstanding at this point in time thus to \"buy in\" to either is merely \nthe byproduct of arrogance and manipulation (again, sorry to sound rude). \nThere is nothing wrong with saying \"I JUST DON'T FREEKIN KNOW!!!!\". \nClaiming ignorance is not akin to rejection of either theory; it's an act \nof honesty and humility. \n\nSummary to all: Myself, and many other atheists do not reject the premise \nof a creator; we simply don't accept it based upon a lack of evidence; \nthere is a difference between \"not accepting as fact\" and \"outright \nrejecting\". One is a claim of arrogant knowledge, the other is an humble \nadmission of ignorance. We DO reject human claims of ownership over this \nso-called creator (religion) - in the same way that christians reject \nislam, atheists reject both. Personally, I think that if there is a heaven \nand a hell, all religious people will go to hell for being arrogant, \nelitist, separatist and hateful. Religion divides humanity into groups; \natheists would strive to reunite us all under the loving title of \"human\".",

I have never seen lions show gazelles any moral \ncourtesy of that sort in the wild so why should human beings who are only \nevolved animals according to atheists be truly moral n good to each other? \nWithout the God factor aspect as portrayed by the Christian dogma, the \nissue of true morality n its consistent practice as well as the parallel \nramifications/consequences whereby good deeds gets rewards always and bad \ndeeds gets punishments always is negated.\nWe see it all around us when people are wrongly shot or imprisoned for a \ncrime they didn't commit or bad people seem to prosper. But the Christian \ntheology settles all those questions of moral inconsistencies both in our \ntime or that of the past because it explains the question of good n evil \n(origin), why we are on this earth ( that's to serve God n man n ultimately \ndetermine our worth in the next life), true morality(not everyone knows or \nadheres to what is right/wrong the Bible explains that by saying do to \nothers what u want done to u. So if u want to bullied in the next life dish \nit out cos u reap what u sow etc.), the Bible also promises a final \njudgment (Destiny) where all wrong will be made right, from incurable \ndiseases to natural disasters to world peace. We have never had world peace \ndespite our human attempts bcos its one thing to fix the head-intellect, \nanother thing to fix the heart- the nature of fallen man. N am only talking \nabout the things we can handle as humans not to talk of the terminal \ndiseases or natural disasters, only Christ can fix those.\nHope this came across as humble cause that's my heart as i write this. One \nthing i know for sure is that Christ loves you very much and i pray He \ntouches your heart cause you need a heart embrace n understanding more than \nany intellectual comprehension my dear.

We aren't meant to look appealing \nto them. We must preach Christ crucified, the substitution for our sins.\n\nWe come to Christ by accepting His sacrifice, praying for forgiveness of \nour sins and turning from our sin, or REPENTING. So when we evangelise to \npeople, we tell them that they are made slaves to sin and need a Saviour \nwho will help them out of that bondage. Without Jesus' sacrifice we will \nall perish because of sin. There are many ways to evangelise in a way that \nwon't make us look like judges, but the core of true Christianity are these \nthings. Not many will want to follow Jesus and would rather live in their \nsins though, which is why preachers point out that we live in a sinful \ngeneration and we need to help them come to know Jesus.\n\nWhen Jon says we must become like the World to save the World, the \nunfortunate implication is that you will move away from God and obviously \nbecome like the World. You have a choice of serving two masters: God or the \nWorld. God promises eternal life as long as you give up your life to Him, \nbut you will be the World's slave if you take on its motto: \"do what you \nwant\". God's Word, His rules, are there to tell you that you can't do what \nyou want, and they are necessary to bring someone to Christ. You cannot \nbecome like the World and serve God - it is impossible. Therefore, in the \nend, you will love one and hate the other (Luke 16:13).\n\nJesus did not go to parties to show men that they could continue in their \nlicentious ways. During the marriage feast He showed His authority by \nturning water into wine to prove that He was the Son of God (John 2:11). In \nthe context of making wine, it shows that the pleasurable things on the \nearth are the gift of God and we should praise Him for them. This has \nnothing to do with partying with them. Although we can still go to parties, \nwe must remember to do all to the glory of God (Colossians 3:17).\ufeff",

I know you will argue with \nthat, but let's agree to disagree. \n\nAs for slavery, I'd recommend a website it's called gotquestions.org, just \nsearch for slavery in Old Testament, they explain it better than I could, \n\nRape? God commanded rape? Sure He let it happen, but no He doesn't say Hey \nI order you to rape them. \n\nGenocide, God made it very clear, He told the Israelites it was not for \nanything they had done, it was only because He had let His wrath fall upon \nthe wickedness of those in the lands before them. Not to mention the 400 \nyears He gave them to repent of their wickedness,.\n\nyes, as for the forgiving? Is it that hard to understand why He must deal \nwith sin? The most terrifying truth of God? He is good. Why is that \nterrifying? we are not. God is righteous, God is absolute holiness, and He \ncannot violate His attributes, so because of that, He cannot forgive sin. \nIt must be dealt with. \n\nWe intentionally seperated ourselves from God, an eternal defense demands \neternal payment. If God forgave sin, would He truly be just? That is why \nthe bible is totally and completely about redemption, the stories in the \nbible are just that, stories, unless you read them in their actual context, \nall pointing to Jesus. God allows what He hates to accomplish what He loves \nat some times. It wa all about what God did for us. After we offended him, \ndeserving eternal punishment for our eternal offense, He created a plan to \noffer us the choice to be with Him\n\nJesus as God in the flesh, appeased the wrath of God, sin was dealt with on \nthat tree. We aren't redeemed because the Romans naed Him to the cross, it \nwas because Jesus became all sin, and God poured out His wrath and fierce \nanger against sin upon He. As it says, It pleased Yahweh to crush Him. \n\nI think your mistake is thinking God's intent on this earth is for us to be \ngood, but It was only for us to have the choice of communion with Him. We \neither accept Him, or reject Him. Being righteous follows, but that is not \nthe point. Things happened because they must, God allowed certain things \nfor His redemption plan to come about As it does.\n\nI really have to wonder the morality part, if we are nothing but primordial \nslime, and everything is subjective/determinism, I can't understand how \nsomeone questions God. They call The idea of Him evil, but a crime against \nhumanity is only there assuming there is value to humanity, so really \nwithout the existence of God, you have no right to question it, and also if \nthere is no God, truth as a category doesn't exist anyways, so it would be \na lie to call a lie a lie anyways. The only value of humanity is that we \nare in the image of God, and he considered His love for us, greater than \nHis majesty. He stepped off his throne to become beaten mocked and killed \nFor THOSE who beat and mocked and killed Him. \n\nEven before I was a true christian, I knew there was a God, I didn't have \nHis spirit in me like I thought I did because I didn't really get it. In \norder to understand anything of the grace of God, you have to see firsthand \nthe depravity of us. \n\nLike I said, You would have some line to differentiate between bad and good \nto call God bad or good, without acknowledging His existence, the \naccusations self destruct. I've never struggled believing there was a God \nin general, most peoples problem with God isn't intellectual, far from it, \nit's moral. Man thinking they know better, that they shouldn't be \naccountable to anyone, as if they were Gods themselves.\n\nMost people also make the mistake of thinking of God as just \"another guy\". \nJust a really powerful person. But being God, He is not anywhere close to \nwhat we are, as He himself says, my ways aren't your ways, my thoughts \naren't your thoughts. He is the Judge of the Earth, all existence is rooted \nin Him, so He sets the standards of Good/Bad/justice/consequences. You \ndon't have to accept Him, but you can't sneak your assumptions in, when the \nassumptions self destruct without His existence anyways. \n\nAnd by the way, I'm not trying to be mean, or condescending, or try and \nmassage my ego by trying to win an internet debate, I'm really wanting to \nhelp. Because of course they're all existential realities we cannot run \nfrom, that demand explanation. I've studying studied the naturalistic \nworldview and arguments for hours upon hours and hours, and as most would \nadmit, it is by no means cohearent, deism trumps naturalistic arguments, as \nGod said, His glory in the universe is clearly and easily seen, atheism is \nonly the result of either the inability to accept the supernatural, or as \nmany former atheist will admit, the hatred of God. Science is unable to \nprove God, or disprove Him, but many atheists will only remember the prove \npart and try to make people assume the disprove part doesn't exist. However \nwhen it comes to at least what is more likely, and using logic and \nreasoning, it definitely supports His existence. ",

If you found many things in the bible that you could \nprove to be false and would contradicting then yes, but the bible is a \ncollection of writings written over 1500 hundred years by over 40 authors, \nand it's accuracy throughout is even by skeptics, beyond any ancient \ndocuments. That of course doesn't prove anything itself, but it should at \nleast make you think and pay attention to it. I'd recommend you watch some \nof ravi zacharias videos on here, he explains morality subjective and \nobjective very well. People's problem with God isn't intellectual it's \nmoral, and that's because they don't understand exodus and Deuteronomy in \nit's actual full context. Generally atheists I come across have the \nthoughts they should be free to do as they please without accountability to \nanyone ultimately, and that's why they'll embrace anything not of God, \nbecause His existence would in their minds take that away. \n\nChristianity has nothing to do with feeling good, doing what makes you feel \ngood, it is based off history, the resurrection of Jesus, as he claimed He \nwould be resurrected, and then do that, that's entirely what it based off \nof. On paper you can talk about subjective morality, but when you look at \nreality itself, apply it to your own heart and look how Jesus described the \nhuman heart, His accuracy in explaining humanity is best described as \nuncanny whether you believe or not. If you don't believe, I don't see what \nyour need is to try and persuade others not to think the way they do, \nconsidering subjective morality and thinking it's full context shows you \nhave no right to, and you have nothing to base your opinions off of to \ndescribe whether they are right or wrong anyways",

As soon as the word comes about we instinctively think of sinful \nbehavior. But I don't feel like he used it in that context. I believe that \nhe only used the word 'party' so that younger minds would be more open to \nthe idea of Christianity. \n\nAs for accepting gay life? I heard nothing of the sort. Please don't feel \nlike I'm attacking but I feel like sharing. What I understood was that he \nmeant that we should change the way we approach the one's who struggle with \ntheir christian lives, homosexuality, or those who just have different \nbeliefs. If we try to convert them by trying to cram religion down their \nthroats instead of trying to understand why they haven't gotten it \nthemselves, we might just be losing souls. The way we approach people, \nespecially non-Christians matter. We have to set an example for them and \nshow them that this live isn't as bad as it's made out to be. We have to \nlet them know that its okay to trust the people of God, and in time, become \none. \n\nWe as the older generation should've seen past the words of this video and \nlistened to the message, which was a pretty powerful and factual one if you \nask me.",

But no all of we \n\"blind people\" as you call us went away from the church because we felt \npeople there were doing a bad job (not that there a lot who doesn't) Some \nof us just don't want to be there. I, for example, grew up in a christian \nchurch, the one I attended until I was 20 years old. I had friends there, \nall my family went there, I used to preach and sing, I for a time I was a \nleader on youth groups there. But then a time came when my mind was looking \nfor something else. I started reading, getting into science and literature, \nand began to realize that this wasn't everything. That there can be other \nexplanations to \"Jesus everything\". I don't hate christians, and I behave \nalmost like one (maybe I got used to it). But I don't believe in gods or \nGod or Jesus, and I don't expect people to just stop believing this with \nthis post because that wasn't the way I did. I just say... There is a part \nof this \"godless generation\" who just wants to be like this. This doesn't \nmean I'm harming people. And if there is a god, and when I die I get to \nmeet him or her, and he/she is really benevolent, he/she will understand. \nSadly, Jesus said only he was the way, so if he's real, I guess that's hell \nfor me just because I wanted to put in practice the same free will people \nsay he gave me. I don't think that's good.\nGood day\ufeff",

They sit in church just so they appear normal. Appearing normal \nis the same as conformity to societies ways.\n\nPick and Choose: The practitioners that choose only to believe in some of \nthe ideals as laid out according to the Bible, while dismissing other \nideals as wrong or untruthful.\n\nGreed Only: People who claim to be Christian yet their actions demonstrate \nonly greed. Greed not only to monetary resources but greed to all \nresources. The ones who take more than their fair share of gifts we all \nneed to survive.\n\nMy Way or Highway: These are the Christians that truthfully believe that \ntheir ideals and values are the only ones worthy to God. This group isn't \ninherently evil but when taken to the extreme results in bigotry.\n\nEveryday: Those Christians who in general follow the path that Jesus wanted \nthem to follow. They try their best to be righteous with sincerity yet they \nalso realize that as humans they make mistakes and break the laws of God. \nWhile they may sin they actively seek to be forgiven and try better in the \nfuture.\n\nAltruistic: These are the followers that respect others yet follow the path \nJesus wanted to follow. They follow this path everyday and rarely sin.. \nThey are inherently givers and not takers. As a giver they respect everyone \nno matter their belief system.\ufeff",

You provided a well written and well \nthought out response which gives me a lot of respect for you.\n\nAnyway, lets get down to it!\n\n1 Timothy 2:11-14 \"Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do \nnot permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, \nshe is to remain quiet. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is \nthe image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.\"\n\n1 Peter 3:7 \"Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding \nway, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel\"\n\nColossians 3:18 \"Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.\"\n\n1 Corinthians 14:34-35 \"The women should keep silent in the churches. For \nthey are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law \nalso says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their \nhusbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.\"\n\nExodus 21:7 \"\u201cWhen a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go \nout as the male slaves do.\"\n\n\nThese passages tend to give me the idea that God considers woman inferior \nto Men. A lot of these speak of women being submissive to their husbands \nwhich, once again, means that they are not on equal footing with them which \nwould mean they are inferior. A lot of these speak of women just flat out \nbeing inferior, no mention of husbands at all. \nHave you ever gone to school? If you have then you're going against the \nwill of God since your desire to learn should be quenched by your husband, \nnot teachers. Have you even spoken in church at ANY time during your life? \nIf so then you are going against the will of God.\n\nI understand ones desire to have faith and respect the will of God, I am by \nno means trying to sway you in your faith because I respect your right to \nhave it, I simply want to know if you're OK with the God you give so much \nmuch love to seeing you as a lessor being to the men in your life.
