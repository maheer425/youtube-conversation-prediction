But I for one \n(usually) have enough faith in people to think they'll realize that \napplying any one concept to an entire group is stupid. I have a lot of \nproblems with people criticizing people for being too \"typical,\" it's \nsomething that seems to happen most with gender roles and sexuality. The \npoint about true acceptance is letting everyone be who they want to be, \nregardless of their preferences in life. Tyler is a loud, colorful, \nextroverted kind of guy. I for one think he'd be pretty similar even if by \nsome twist of fate he had ended up straight. Anyway, I think the point is \nthat he's not going to stop being a gay icon, and he's not going to change \nand become...Less himself. And I'm sorry that you want more representation \nfor the kind of gay that IS often underrepresented by the media, I think \nhaving \"icons\" from all walks would be pretty great. But there's no reason \nat all to tear down Tyler, or any \"stereotypical\" person for just being who \nthey are. If you want someone to get more recognition, work for that, for \npromoting them. Not dissing someone else. Because for someone to be \nsuccessful they don't have to crush someone else. Everyone should just try \nto get along. Everyone. <3 :)",

I've never heard a gay person say that they don't think someone \nshouldn't represent the gay community. Isn't it outstanding and courageous \nenough to do so? Plus, Tyler Oakley is kind, sweet, and giving. I don't see \nwhat's so wrong with being flamboyant and open about his sexuality. Lots of \nstraight men have the same qualities. Sure, not all gay men are like Tyler \nOakley. He is definitely special and crazy and all those wonderful things. \nBut I think he does an excellent job as a representation. And if you think \nyou can do a better job, go ahead. Have a nice rest of your day :)",
