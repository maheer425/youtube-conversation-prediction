Anyone who attributes terms such as \"good\" and \"evil\" to the past, do \nnot have the intellectual ability to reach an abstraction level, where \nstudying history can be done outside the very limited scope of their own \nnarrow minded socially constructed \"weltanschauung\".\nThat in other words means that they are about worth as much to the academic \nfield of history as nazi historians (better known by another term: liars).\nAn example would be celebrating Mongols with their little clip... Those \npeople raped pretty much every single woman from here to Mongolia at least \nones. So yay, rapists... Do you still want to attribute moral values to \nhistory, or can we move on?\n\n2. You know that calling the Allies good, means you are calling Stalin USSR \ngood. You might want to rethink that... You know Stalin that great guy, who \nasked his bureaucrats if they could send the whole Ukrainian population to \nSiberia... This meant someone actually had to say no, not because of the \nhorror and death it would cause (like it did to so many other Soviet \nminorities), but because there was not even close to a strong enough \ninfrastructure to handle moving so many people. And he also starved 25 \nmillion of his own people to death, while the US was offering food aid... \nOr just ask any Pole, what happened at Katyn, or how the USSR helped them \nliberate themselves, when they rose against the Germans (that would be a: \nnah, we will just wait here until the Germans have killed all the rebelling \nPoles)...\n\n3. Calling the invasion of Russia stupid, is being stupid. The European War \nwas about Germany vs. the USSR. The Western Front was a minor annoyance to \nGermany as Britain and France could not keep out of what was an unavoidable \n(by the time Hitler came to power) war of annihilation between fascism and \ncommunism (evil vs. evil).\n\nThis was a VERY bad episode and I really hope you get your shit together \nfor future episodes.\ufeff",

You talk about the bad things instead of just \ncalling them evil... And he spends a lot more time demonising Nazi Germany, \nthan a USSR that was objectively more horrible, but had a (to most) less \nhorrible motivation (and are therefore by many subjective seen as less bad).\n\nThe stupidity of invading Russia is a common misconception from mainly \nBritish and American historian, who think El Alamein (a single corps battle \nfor the Germans) or Normandy (also know as the diversion to get Bagration \ngoing) was the turning point of the war (not like anything significant \nhappened at Leningrad, Demjansk, Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, etc., or four \ntimes at Kharkov for that matter).\n\nThe reason why the liberal West won the long ideological war (1917-1989) \nwas because fascists and communists bleed each other out on the Eastern \nFront. The Eastern Front was the European part of WWII, everything else was \ndiversions.\n\nThe discurses are all over the place, and it look like they used sources \nfor research that was even outdated, when John went to high school.

The clear winner of the evil race is Stalin, there's not \neven a question about it. At best Germany might make it to #2, but right \nbehind them is the US. Thus if we're looking at it from the point of view \nwhom was the most evil, the allied clearly takes and eats the cake.\n\nHowever on the other spectrum there is only 1 participant of the WW2 that \nhas never been accused of any war crimes and that happens to also be an \nAxis ally. Finland. Funnily enough Finland is also the only Axis ally that \nwas never occupied in the war and the only one to pay her debts fully from \nthe war as well. Finland is also the only country that another democratic \nnation has officially declared a war against by the British.\n\nThe harsesht criticism Finland has recieved is for malnurishment of the \nPOW's, but even that is a bit of a false accusation since food was short in \nthe first place and the Soviet prisoners were better fed as POW's than they \nwere as soldiers. As a matter of fact many Soviet soldiers did surrender \nexactly for the reason that they knew they'd get better fed as prisoners.\n\nThus I have absolutely no objections to this view of what happened by Crash \nCourse. Food is the single most mightiest weapon that you can have and \nmilitary leaders have known this throughout the ages, thus the importance \nof blockades and sieges even in the medieval periods as well as solid, well \nmaintained supply routes to your own troops.\ufeff",

The entire North Africa campaign had \nthe single objective of the Suez Canal, to stop oil shipments from the \nMiddle East to the UK and to get in on that oil themselves. After Operation \nBarbarossa failed in the winter of 1941, the Germans launched a new summer \noffensive (Case Blau) to take the oilfields of the Caucasus, and one \nimportant industrial city on the Volga, Stalingrad. World War II may have \nhad origins in solidifying internal food production, but once the war was \nunderway, the objective was oil. This truly was the first major war over \noil, happening over half a century ago.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Melon Lord Yes food caused the war, but oil drove the war's outcome. Oil \ncaused Axis powers to give only limited training to mobile fighting \npersonnel, especially aircraft fighter pilots. Although Axis planes were \nstill quite effective in the hands of able pilots, few new pilots received \nadequate training to ensure success. Furthermore, oil drove logistical \nproblems that destroyed the Axis war machine, especially in Germany. World \nWar 2 was a war caused by food, but driven by oil. This is the problem with \nmodern academics, they like to focus on the cause of war and the results of \nthe war, but relatively little of what actually happened in the war. For \ninstance, we all learn what caused World War 2 and the war's results. We \nlearn that the Germans were in Stalingrad in 1942, and the Japanese \nattacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, but we never learn why. We learn that the \nSoviets lost 20 million people in World War 2, but we never learn that \nnearly 25% of those casualties were caused by other Russians. We learn that \npoison gas was used in World War 1, but we never hear the story about the \nyoung German corporal, blinded by gas in 1918, who vowed to give up his \nfruitless ventures in art and architecture and enter politics if he would \never regain his sight. That young German would help start National \nSocialist German Workers' Party, which would later be abbreviated to the \nNazi Party and come under the control of that corporal, Adolf Hitler. See, \njust knowing the cause and results of war doesn't paint the entire picture. \nTo understand the full impact of the war, you have to understand the war \nitself. To just glance over the  war part of the war, claiming that its \nunimportant, is to leaving out the most important thing you are trying to \nteach. The results of the war are based on what happened in the war, not \njust the causes. Without all three parts, beginning, middle, and end, you \nwill never truly understand what happened.",

O'Hanlon of \nthe Brookings Institution estimated that if Afghanistan generates about $10 \nbn per year from its mineral deposits, its gross national product would \ndouble and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other \ncritical needs. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in \n2006 that northern Afghanistan has an average *2.9 billion (bn) barrels \n(bbl) of crude oil*\u00b9, 15.7 trillion cubic feet (440 bn m3) of natural gas, \nand 562 million bbl of natural gas liquids. In December 2011, Afghanistan \nsigned an oil exploration contract with China National Petroleum \nCorporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu \nDarya river in the north.\"\n\n\u00b9 No oil, you say? Fancy telling the USGS they were wrong, do you?\n\nNotice the gas reserve mentions as well? Who's had a finger in that pie, eh?\n\n3- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unocal_Corporation#Operations \"*Unocal* was \none of the key players in the CentGas consortium, an attempt to build the \nTrans-Afghanistan Pipeline to run from the Caspian area, through \nAfghanistan and probably Pakistan, to the Indian Ocean. One of the \nconsultants to Unocal at that time was Zalmay Khalilzad, former US \nambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations.\nIn the 1980s, CIA chief Bill Casey had revived the agency's practice of \ngaining intelligence from traveling businessmen. Marty Miller, one of \nUnocal's top executives, conducted negotiations in several Central Asian \ncountries from 1995, and voluntarily provided information gained on these \ntrips to the CIA's Houston station.\"\n\n\"Unocal seems to have had a deeper role. Intelligence \"whistleblower\" Julie \nSirrs claimed that anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud told her he had \n\"proof that Unocal had provided money that helped the Taliban take Kabul \n[in 1996]\". And French journalist Richard Labeviere said, referring to the \nlater 1990s, 'The CIA and Unocal's security forces ... provided military \nweapons and instructors to several Taleban militia[s] ...'\"\n\n\"US State Department officials openly promoted the pipeline, and former \nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger served as a Unocal consultant.\nThe Taliban and Unocal were in negotiations in Texas to discuss \narrangements for the gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan in 1997 \nalthough it faced competition with from the Argentine Bridas Corporation.\nWhile no deal was ultimately struck with either company the Taliban were \nleaning toward making a deal with Unocal as of August 1998. The company \nsuspended work on the project following the U.S. cruise missile strikes on \nAfghanistan in response to the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings and completely \npulled out in December 1998 citing low oil prices and a need to cut costs \nin addition to regional instability.\"\n\n\"Unocal was also the third largest member of the recently completed and \nopened Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the \nMediterranean Sea.\"\n\nThe US seems to have some significant interests over there ...",

The \ncomplexity of these wars as to whom bears the mantle of \"bad guy\" and \"good \nguy\" is prickly, even today. While the general consensus is that Hitler was \nthe bad guy from WWII, the Russians kind of were the ones who killed the \nmost foreigners, the Japanese did the sneakiest attacks, and the US was the \none who dropped the fucking A bomb (being where the term \"Fucking A!\" came \nfrom). The Germans took over Poland and other countries for resources to \nfulfill their political obligations, but their methods were horrendous and \nbarbaric, and their delineation as to who was deserving of their spoils was \nflatly disgusting.\n\nBut this was nothing new. Their doing this was exactly the same as warlord \nof the history books who're often admired and revered for their warrior \nprowess. The differences are really only twofold:\n1. The Americans had television, and thus were able to stage a propaganda \ncampaign against Hitler. Accurately, largely, but present nonetheless. In \nthe past, rallying the troops was all that was required, but in the new \nworld of television and cinema news at the talkies, this gave more drive to \npatriotism than ever before, and for a country such as the United States \nwho wasn't even *fucking involved* to have such a campaign is still \nbaffling to my mind. Sure, the English probably couldn't have beaten the \nGermans on their own, but had they approached the situation without the \nAmericans in tow, surely they'd have pulled more ranks in from India and \nAustralia, given we're both their colonies.\n2. Hitler used propaganda for the common-folk. It's believed that of the \nestimated 6 million Jews who were killed in Germany during WWII and the \nHolocaust, close to half a million of these were straight up homicides: \npeople being murdered by their neighbours. This was being encouraged and \npropagated by the German media. When 1/12 of your victims are murdered by \ncommonday people because you tell them to on television, it means your \ntactics are working, mercilessly and with the worst smattering of an \ninsidious tone than ever before.\n\nBut do you know the war that rages on today that is exactly like this? The \nwar on drugs. Demonising people who use drugs so as to put them in prison \nand making them considered evil is one of the reasons America is the worst \ncountry in the world right now. Even all of the places in the world you \ncould say are \"bad\" places don't imprison more of their own people than the \nUSA, and most don't campaign on television to tell people just how bad \ntheir habits are. The reason you're losing this war is because you've \ncalled it a war. Simple.",

                    "text": "+Planeswalker123 Yeah, propaganda played the biggest roll, pretty much. The \nJapanese preached to their men that the Americans murdered Japanese POWs. \nThey were then too afraid to get captured.\n\nIwo Jima was proof that the Japanese did not need to commit suicide charges \nto cause some problems to the enemy. The Kamikazi was only effective \nbecause it was a loss of 1 man, 1 plane, and several hundred pounds of \nexplosives for an entire vessel, which is a really good payoff, especially \ngiven how the men are not phased to embark on such a mission due to \n\"Bushido\" propaganda. However, the Banzai charge was a payment of too many \nmen for too few targets. General Kuribayashi (I am sure I spelled his name \nwrong) ordered the men of Iwo Jima NOT to die until they killed 10 men \neach. Of course, no promises could be kept, but it basically meant he would \nnot tolerate suicide charges. If each man could fight longer, they were \nordered to, which really put Kuribayashi in a bad political position.\n\nFor Japanese politics, they didn't want the men and people to know that \nthey were losing the war. If the men were to suicide, they would not be \naffected by the poor moral of crushing defeats. Furthermore they would not \nspread defeatist notions in the home islands. It was only when the war hit \nOkinawa (when the most Japanese prisoners were captured) that people gave \nup and just outright admitted that the war was coming to the homeland.\n\nIn Okinawa, women committed suicide, which I think would be a whole new \nsituation. It is not an irrational fear for a woman to fear the men of an \noccupying army. History only shows that EVERY occupying army has to deal \nwith its own men mistreating or raping the women of the occupied territory. \nHowever, it further shows how much the Japanese government put an emphasis \non death over defeat, because Chinese women did not commit mass suicide \nwhen the Japanese invaded, and neither did Soviet women, or German women. \nThe fear is normal, but the action was very strange, even for the culture \n(as Japanese women are not bound by the code of Bushido).",

They thought it would \nwork against the Americans, even though almost every American had at least \na semi-automatic weapon excluding the Marines on Guadalcanal, but it failed \nmiserably. They kept doing it because Japanese propaganda depicted that \nAmericans treated POW's the same way the Japanese did. Even though some \nAmerican soldiers did some very very disturbing things to some Japanese \nsoldiers (boiling their skulls to use as hood ornaments), for the most part \nthe Americans treated Japanese POW's well.\n\nThe Kamikazi was an answer to the need for a guided weapon to make up for \nthe lack of heavy ordnance. Since they did not have the technology for heat \nseeking or remote controlled rockets (even though they had a prototype \nremote controlled tank), they resorted to manned missiles (zeroes, and \nlater there were designs to use actual jets and rockets with pilots). It \nwas effective because of the Japanese Bushido code, as the Germans brought \nthe idea first (they thought of German pilots dying for the Fatherland, but \nknew that nobody would voluntarily suicide-crash into a ship, so then they \ndecided that pilots should destroy other planes by clipping them with their \nwings and bailing, but that was also stupid).\n\nFood didn't cause anything. If you are starving, you have no energy for a \nbayonet charge.

This had created a very \nstrong impression that the USSR was weak. In addition sooner or later \nStalin would have attacked the West as he wanted to and was expanding the \nUSSR regardless. Hitler was aware of all these facts and based on  the \nNazi's incredible  and very recent triumphs in the western front from \nHitler's perspective it seemed like a very plausible plan to gain alot of \nresources while eliminating a potential foe which was a well calculated \ngamble AT THE TIME. Hitler as well as his generals and troops were \nconvinced they would be back by xmas and he even quoted the USSR as being a \nbig old house that all you need to do is kick the front door down and the \nwhole building would come crumbling down. Given the conditions of the first \nfew months such as land gained and casualties sustained the invasion did \nNOT look doomed from the start or \"stupid\".

Generals like Patton did not want the bomb dropped because \nthey believed it was dishonorable (the Japanese would have agreed), but \nothers believed saving military lives was the right thing to do. The choice \nof a civilian target was a tactical one, as it would destroy moral. Japan's \neconomy had already tanked, so bombing a military target would not have \nmattered. It wasn't black and white on the Japanese side either. Yamamoto \ndid not want a war against the US because he knew the Japanese would lose. \nHe wanted peace as soon as possible. Others wanted peace after hearing the \nthreat of an apocalyptic bomb. The militarists trusted Japanese tenacity \nenough to believe taking the bombs face first and continuing the war was \nthe right thing to do because there was a small chance Japan could scrape a \nconditional surrender.\n\nLook at Hitler and Stalin. Hitler didn't do anything he did because he was \nthe spawn of Satin like short minded people like to believe (which is why I \ncompare him to Attila the Hun because he was also viewed as the spawn of \nSatin, the \"Scourge of God\" in the immediate future after his exploits). He \ndid what he did because he believed it was the right thing to do. If you \nhonestly believe your economy is being sabotaged by one race, you kill them \noff. It makes sense, until the notion that their belief was wrong comes up \n(likewise just because someone believes something doesn't make it actually \ngood, as 6 million Jews and 12 million Russians would agree). Stalin's \nGulag system was also under the belief that everything he did was right, \nand if you think logically under the assumption that you ARE infallible, \narresting any opposition IS the right thing to do. He had Russia in his \nmind first.\n\nGood intentions pave the the road to hell, and there should be more \nforgiveness for those who WEREN'T politicians as they were put in extreme \npressure. However, people should just stop worrying who the bad guys and \ngood guys were in WWII and worry more about doing the right thing today, \nespecially when decisions will still be very difficult to make. Do you drop \nthe bomb to save your own men, comrades, friends, and family, or do you not \ndrop the bomb to save the innocent lives of your enemies civilians?",

Military \nforce was required to remove them from Asia, this is a fact.\nAgain, the Portuguese in India refused to give up Goa, they were to be \nremoved by FORCE.\n\nSo, back again, the actions of Britain, France etc in the 19th century, led \ndirectly to the wars of the 20th century.\nInstead of blaming the Japanese and others, Europeans should outright say \nthey brought misery upon themselves.\n\nLet me restate. Japan was the most insular country on the planet UNTIL the \nEuropeans started to encroach near their territory. The chain of events \nstarted when Britain and France tried to control all waters around Japan.\nThe selling of opium was instrumental in showing the true colors of \nBritain. Before it could say it was just free trade, but now it was a \npurely criminal act. It would be like Mexico trying to sell alcohol to the \nUS during prohibition... Mexico would have been destroyed by the US. \n\nyou say:\"Everyone was colonial dude, everyone.\"\n- Japan had no intentions of being a colonial power, until the Europeans \nshowed up.\nThe wars between Japan, China and Korea are just that, warring countries, \nsimilar to internal wars between European entities.\n\nyou say:\"I don't really know if you can call the chain of evens \ncatastrophic for Europe, it;s stilla  wealthy and vibrant place that has \nsome of the highest living standards in the world.\"\n--LOL, the chain of events led to 50M dead Europeans.\nIn some ways it is justifiable, because 10M+ African children were \nkidnapped by the Europeans. 2.5M by the Brits.\nOne major catalyst for German militarization was that Britain and France \ndid not let Germany enter the world stage on equal footing near the turn of \nthe century.\n\nThe reason that Europe is wealthy today is that the US has made it so. It \nhas essentially removed nationalistic squabbles and encouraged the \nformation of the EU. \n\nyou say: \"So in short, everyone goes bad when they get power for the first \ntime, maybe we can all work to put our power to good use?\"\nSure, everyone should work together. But crimes cannot go unpunished. So, \nif Britain and others found it perfectly ok to kidnap African children then \nit should be perfectly OK for Japan to think it's OK to behead British \nofficers.\n\nHere's what I am saying: Britain, France and others deserved all the \nsuffering that came to them in the 20thC because they were never punished \nfor slavery, colonialism, drug dealing etc. Since there was no \ninstitutional court of justice, deadly force via Japan, Nazi Germany, \nCommunists etc might have been just the punishment to make the world a more \nfair place.\n\nInstead of trying to cowardly avoid blame, Brits and others should say they \ndeserved everything that was coming to them - \"You reaped what you sow\"\n\n\n ",

No, I don't think \nBritain should have sold opium to the Chinese, I also believe that they \nshouldn't have Conquered India or Africa but thats what people do when they \nget powerful, pretty consistently. The Japanese and British Empires were \njust as bad as each other in the long run, no doubt, you could maybe even \nsay that the British were worse overall. But in 1942 the Japanese were far, \nfar worse than the Brits. In 1920, they're probably even. In 1820, the \nBrits are far worse. But in WWII? Thats when Japan was at it's worst. \n\nAs for Britain excerpting Imperial power yeah, we tried to do that at Suez \nbut the Russians have tried to excerpt imperial power over Ukraine and the \nAmericans over Cuba and both sides over and over again during the Cold War. \nThe idea of empire didn't die with Britain, it just changed it's look.\n\nI also think European Imperial ideals have died due to the population \nbecoming genuinely more caring, when schools teach the Empire they treat it \nas a destructive force, people don't want foreign intervention any-more and \nwe certainly don't want to go around conquering places. Everyone, or \neveryone sane, accepts that all people are equal and deserve equal \ntreatment, regardless of race or religion. White Mans burden is dead, \nConquest is dead, Soft power is king now; American, Chinese and Russian \neconomic influence is where the empires lie today.\n\nI don't really know if you can call the chain of evens catastrophic for \nEurope, it;s stilla  wealthy and vibrant place that has some of the highest \nliving standards in the world.\n\nSo in short, everyone goes bad when they get power for the first time, \nmaybe we can all work to put our power to good use?

If Britain \ndid not start to encroach towards Japan then there would not have been a \nmilitarized Japan and hence there might not have been a WW2. Sole \nresponsibility to provoking the Japanese were the British, this is \ndocumented in official Japanese government documents.\n\nNO, China or Japan never had a concept of colonization. Unlike Europe, the \nJapanese did not want to spread their belief system, they did not want to \nexpand their geopraphy, they did not want to \"civilize\" peoples. Unlike \nChristianity or Islam, Asian belief systems do not condone forced \nconversions. It started with the Portuguese, then the Dutch and finally the \nBritish. The chain of events was catastrophic for the Europeans.\n\nI will ask you a simple question:\nIf the British found it prefectly legal to sell opium to China then could \nthe Japanese do the same?\nI know you won't answer the question...\n\nYou made yourself very clear when you made the statement:\n\"British Rule was cruel but more than anything it was greedy, Britain's \nEmpire was one of Profit whilst the Japanese Empire was one of dominion and \ndomination.,\"\nIt doesn't matter what the motive, millions of coastal African children \nwere kidnapped by the British.\nThe Japanese wanted domination for greed also, they want resources just \nlike the Europeans were doing for 500 years.\n\n\"Japan is a vibrant, beautiful place and Britain's far from perfect but I \nknow which one I'd rather have in charge.\"\nBritain is a \"nice\" place now because it was forced to change it ways, \neither by force or by politics.\nRemember that the British still tried to exert their imperial intentions \nduring the Suez crisis. Colluding with the French and Israelis to make what \nmight be the greatest FAKE war in history. This also ended in disaster for \nthe British.\nThe French and Dutch still tried to hold onto their colonies after WW2.\nThe only reason European imperial intentions have died is because of \nAmerican policy along with a fully militarized world supported by Russia \nand China.\n\nSo, I go back to my initial statement:\nBritain sowed the seeds in the late 19th century for global war in the \nearly 20th century, and it paid the price with millions of British lives.",
