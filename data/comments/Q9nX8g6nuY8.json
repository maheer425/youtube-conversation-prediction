This is predicated on the idea that a pet is \nseeking attention in the first place. Most cats, like yours, aren't \nactually doing this - they get enough positive attention anyway. If a pet \nmisbehaves in order to get attention, the cure is to give him/her MORE \nattention, not less, but at appropriate times. Your cat gets lots of love \nand fuss, I imagine, so is toying with items on your desk to amuse himself, \nnot to gain your attention. Ignoring him just gives him space to continue \nthe unwanted behaviour; he couldn't care less whether you give him \nattention; but a sharp no will tell him that the desk isn't his playground.",

Would you ignore a cat who was, as one of mine used to do, \nsticking her paw into the gas fire. Yes, this really happened, often, and \nmy instinct was to shout a sharp no to make her remove her paw before it \ngot burned. She liked the warmth (that house was a cold one, unlike my \ncurrent house).\nLikewise, I wouldn't ignore a cat who was disorganising important papers on \nmy desk. My cats are given lots of attention when they are good - positive \nattention which they enjoy, rather than the negative response (which they \nhate) when they do something unwanted.\nLook up Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Behaviour Modification and you'll \nfind that the ignore method is one of the least effective for changing \nbehaviour.

                "text": "My cat has only lived here for a couple months, so I consider any change in \nher behavior to be her warming up, getting more comfortable, and/or \nsettling in. But a couple weeks ago, she stopped eating dry food. Just out \nof the blue, one morning, no more dry food. She was obviously hungry; when \nI put down food and treats for her she would hover over them and sniff and \npace and put her face in them, and her tail would be up and she would purr. \nWith the treats, she'd even put them in her mouth, crack them open, and \nthen put them back on the floor. She hovered around her food constantly, \njust pacing and staring at the bowl. After a few days, she actually went so \nfar as tearing open the dry food bag. I gave her a different brand, I tried \ndifferent treats. But she won't eat anything she has to chew.\n\nExcept, here's the bizarre part. She tears paper up with her teeth (but \ndoesn't eat it, just shreds it). She chews on my fingers when we play. She \nchews on toys. She chews on her claws when she's grooming to get stuff out \nof them. She loves to cuddle and play, and she loves guests. When my \nbrother had his wedding a couple weeks ago, she was more social than I was!\n\nWhen I took her to the vet, she said her teeth look fine and it sounded \nlike she just had gotten bored. There could be an imperceptible crack, but \nto find that, they'd have to put her under anesthesia, and that makes me \nnervous, as I know multiple dogs and cats who died while getting their \nteeth cleaned.\n\nAfter a week of hoping she was just bored of her food, and after .7 pounds \nof weight loss (she's only an 8 lb cat), I put her on a wet food diet. \nShe'll eat that with no problem. But I know that wet food this early in her \nlife can lead to teeth problems down the road, and I want to get this \nfigured out and get her back on dry food. But I know there has to be an \nunderlying problem that I just haven't spotted, and the fact that I can't \nfigure out what's making her uncomfortable makes me frustrated and feel a \nlittle helpless. You've taught me well, Jackson; nothing is ever truly \nrandom!\n\nAdditional information: during the couple months I've had her, my cat has \nhad a sinus infection and an ear infection (no mites; just an infection). \nShe was a feral stray until last November and had kittens when she was 8 \nmonths old. She has no litterbox problems. She's harness-trained and likes \nto go out on the porch with me, but is not allowed to free-roam outdoors \n(and I don't think she'd want to if she could). She plays about 3 hours a \nday and likes to always be in the same room as me. Before she stopped \neating dry food on me, the last wet food she'd had was at the shelter. I \ngave her Purina One; now I give her Publix brand, because it's the only \nfood that's sustainable financially but not suspiciously cheap. When she \nate dry food, she threw up every couple days until I switched her to \nsensitive stomach food.\ufeff",

Is your carpet the thick kind or thin? (I'm \nnot sure on the terminology) The thicker one will get scratched more. \nBasically, you remove what they're fixated on and it'll be better.
