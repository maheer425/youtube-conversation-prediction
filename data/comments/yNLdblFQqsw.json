Girls we learned how to cook and sew in \nclasses labeled \"home Ech.\" I guess that meant home echonomics. I recently \njoined YMCA and went to a predominately caucasian ymca in Blue ash ohio. I \nwas saddened at how the students we being groomed for so many different \nthings like olympic style swimming teams actual swimming drills track, \ngymnastics starting @ 12 yrs old . But not any young african american kids. \nMabey they are at other ymca's doing more of the basketball programs in \nurban Y's . Sports isn't our only way to success, and its sad that once a \nyoung man is already in the system then , they want to offer them low \npaying job training. (We) have money meaning african americans , can grab \nup these young minds who are very smart and talented, and empower them with \nsomething other than spending all day on corner, and most of time in a \nstudio rapping about things that they know are wrong in the system , but \nmost folks with money want to brag about their title at their jobs and but \nhate the young brothers on corners instead of helping them learn how to \nsurvive , Before they get on paper in the system that will haunt them for \nthe rest of their life.

Therefore the \nfact that we can sit here arguing our opinions on this quite esoteric \nfrivolity (compared to say... what people before 'modern society' had to \nworry about like hunting for dinner and trying to stay alive past 30) means \nthat you are enjoying the current system and fruition of civilization. You \n**have** freedom, what you seem to want is anarchy.\nFun fact: The average caveman had a lifespan of about 14 years...\nEdited: After actually taking the time and look at those videos you said to \nsee.... i realized that you are referring to something else entirely (I \nwrote most of this before doing that and im not gonna delete it lol). \nStill, you're original statement is quite crude and ignorant. As what \nMichael does in all of his videos is lay out the facts, it us up to you or \nanyone else to interpret them as you will. Based on these facts and the \ndefinition of what we call civilization and progress, we are indeed going \nforward. Whether or not people realize that they are being 'turned into \nbricks' have nothing to do with this channel, and everything to do with \npeople like you who misread and misunderstand the facts and go spouting \nnonsense. ie. the dunning-kruger effect.\n\nThe long answer: \nI sort of understand what SeanMauer is saying.... I had to put down my \nnatural aversion to that flag in his pic... but due to the fact that he did \nnot once come out and say what his definition of 'freedom' is and thus did \nnot corroborate what many people are thinking (that he is pro-slavery) I \nthink he may mean the freedom in which the Civil War was truly fought \nfor.... I dont feel like explaining it all, but in essence, if you don't \nalready know, the civil war was not fought over slavery, but the \nConfederate's 'States Rights' meaning their freedom to do whatever the hell \nthey wanted and not conform to the Union's 'government' or congress. \nTherefore I do agree that that kind of freedom is the ideal goal of \n'civilization' where you dont have to follow someone else's rules or \nstandards (kinda like living in your own home rather than having to live \nwith your parents)... however, one must realize that, for one, most of the \nconfederate states were full of racist, sexist, greedy pigheads (the same \ncan be said for some in the union but at least they weren't as open with \nit) who in fact created slavery as we know it today (in most cases in \nhistory it was more or less indentured servitude or pow). Subsequently, \nthat kind of freedom can never be had as long as good ole Human Greed \npersists.\nI read a book (albeit a NF Fantasy) where the inhabitants of their planets \n(made up of a variety of humans, dragons, elves, dwarves, etc) created the \nperfect society by making everybody swear an oath on an extremely powerful \nstone that made them unable to cause harm to any other sentient being. Thus \nthere is no cause for any governmental system or 'oligarchies' or \n'elitists' or 'rulers' or anybody to tell somebody what to do... as there \nwas no longer any reason or ability to cause a conflict. They even managed \nto meat out if it was okay to have sex in your front yard in view of the \npublic and other more specific nuances usually related to cultural \nvarieties.\nNow of course in real life there is no convenient way to stop people from \ninfringing on other peoples human rights so such a Utopia can never be had \nas of yet.... however I for one believe that, at the rate technology is \ngoing, in another second of the history of the world, we will have the \nability to create anything; which means no race for resources, which means \nthere would be nothing to fight over. At this point in time we would have \ncreated even more complex and lucrative government systems then we do now \nto cover stuff like limiting how many donuts we can replicate or whatever, \nwe would concentrate more and more on gaining knowledge for knowledge sake \n, we would not have to worry about having to work for a living as we could \ncreate anything in our own homes (like how we dont have to go hunt for food \nnow, but merely walk to the nearest store). So all we would do to entertain \nourselves, and the only thing to worry about is our arts and our science... \nThis is the very definition of 'civilization' : \" the stage of human social \ndevelopment and organization that is considered most advanced.\" -Google \n\"An advanced state of intellectual, cultural, and material development in \nhuman society, marked by progress in the arts and sciences, the extensive \nuse of record-keeping, including writing, and the appearance of complex \npolitical and social institutions.\" -thefreedictionary.com\n\"a relatively high level of cultural and technological development; \nspecifically :  the stage of cultural development at which writing and the \nkeeping of written records is attained\" -mariam-webster \nAlready society embodies these definitions as opposed to going around being \nable to gather as much money, land, women, and slaves as possible.\nFreedom is defined as: \n\"the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance \nor restraint.\" -Google\n\"the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action\" \n-mariam-webster\n \"the right to do what you want, make your own decisions, and express your \nown opinions\" -the american dictionary\nWhen society has advanced to a point where technology makes it unnecessary \nto have to depend on others or risk your life to sustain your life than \nyeah, thats pretty much the epitome of freedom.\n\nThis is progress. Maybe you simply *prefer* the Stone Age. *Simpler* times \nwhen the complexities of 'human rights' were not even considered.\n\nSeems I have the time to research information and make use of these \napparently limitless chat boxes... hows that for #Progress #Civilization \nand #Freedom \n\nAs for the edited version of this, after looking at Bricks or Stones and \ndismissing Divide and Conquer (seeing that is was your own video, and not a \nvery well done one at that). I must say that you seem to be completely \nmisinterpreting the bible, as wells as that rabbi. Firstly, most current \nday 'preachers' and 'religious leaders' pander to their own delegation of \nbricks just as much if not more so then corrupt political leaders and \ncorrupt businesses. I truly understand what he meant, and I even went and \ndid a little research on my own about the subject. Bricks are the masses \nthat are herded into believing whatever is on mainstream; they are the \nignorant people who do not go out and find facts for themselves; they are \nthe ones too willing to unknowingly be slaves. Bricks are the **figurative** \nabominations of God's naturally created Stones. Bricks are the \npersonification of human kind's ego, god-complex, and foolhardiness. While \nStones are the personification of how God made humans 'in his image' and \nhow he loves every single human regardless of their differences. Ideally, \nwe should be able to complement and live peaceably yet diversely as stones \ndo (like a giant jigsaw puzzle). Instead today's society seems to be made \nup of a bunch of brainwashed, ignorant people who are as diverse as bricks \nand stuck together by the Motar of mass media bull crap (to put it \nfrankly). And I agree, we should be like Stones, different yet \ncomplimentary of each other, rather than trying to make everyone believe, \ndo, look, act, and be the same way. However, the very fact that we are here \neducating ourselves with the facts of history, should humble us and make us \nmore appreciative of how far we have come as a society, we are more unified \nin our diversity then ever before thanks to the pursuit of knowledge, \nthanks to us trying to be more civilized by focusing on art and science... \nWe are now, or soon will be at a turning point in history, where we could \nbe lost in ignorance, controlled by the mass media being directed by the \nelitists of the world; or advance to a point where all Stones can be \ntreated equal, and knowledge is preferred over ignorance. However, if you \nreally want to dive into the rabbit hole of who are the 'brick makers' that \nare 'building the modern day Tower of Babylon' ... look up the free-masons.",

Now, on Earth, it's affected by gravity and friction acting \nagainst it, but the law accepts that it will keep moving since there is \nnothing to stop it in space.\n\nNewton's Second law isn't really that important.

This is because the polar vortexes( real ones, not \nthe US version) there are strong enough to carry the CFC's into the ozone \nlayer. However, when the CFC's react with the ozone both are destroyed. So \nwhen the polar vortexes are no longer strong enough to carry the CFC's up \nthere, they dissipate. Meaning the depletion stops, and the hole actually \nregenerates. That's why the hole isn't there in the summer. \ufeff",

Not sure what exactly you are imagining...the \nreason we have paltry space missions is because there isn't funding for it. \nObama diverted huge amounts of tax dollars and government money once he \nbecame president, by appointing anti-NASA people to head the NASA funding \nwhile he was in office. My life, the life of a lot of people, has been \nadversely affected jobwise, and so has our space system. No one wants to \nactually pay for it, but yet you have everyone stating that NASA should do \nx or y. Guess what? NASA is funded by the government, and it is primarily \nmade up out of a meld of independent contracting companies or contractors, \nand a few civil servants. It has no endless stream or supply of money \nfunding it. What makes matters worse? If they manage to save on a project \nand don't go over budget or are underbudget, let's say, the government \nmakes a case against them that in the next year, their project only needs \nthe amount they needed...this year. That makes people spend money like \ncrazy on stupid things, just to ensure they get the budget they need next \ntime around. Instead, they should be commended on saving that money, and it \nshould be granted that they get an appropriate budget for changes and for \ncost of living next year.

Or, as I sometimes ponder, perhaps God \n*didn't* create the universe, but instead came into existence with the \nuniverse and is meant to guide the development of life, physically and \nmorally. Though why morality should be important to a meaningless universe, \nI know not, so perhaps that part is of God's own discretion.

Deists believe that God created \nthe universe and everything in it, but has since mostly left it to its own \ndevices. They hold that God is best worshiped, not through strict \nceremonies and religious services, but through service to one's fellow man \nthe pursuit of knowledge. God doesn't need to play a visible or even play \nan active role at all in daily life for people to believe in Him. On the \nother hand, I'm reminded of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", in which Milton \njustifies Satan's existence by saying that God allows him to exist so that \nhis evil can inspire acts of goodness. If it should seem that God has \nabandoned the world to hate and evil, perhaps it is because this hate and \nevil is meant to serve some such greater purpose that mankind, with our \nlimited perspective, is unable to comprehend. Thus people like me believe \nin a God who appears to do nothing for His people. Just my opinion, not \nsaying you have to start.",
