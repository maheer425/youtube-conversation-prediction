If the dosage is low the other \ntrillion bacteria will die and the 1 with resistance will multiply \nunimpeded until there are a trillion of it. It is likely that 1 of those \nwill have a slightly higher resistance by chance then the others. This \nrepeats as the dosage gets higher and higher. However if you just start \nwith an extremely high dosage or use a combination of multiple antiobiotics \nor other antibacterials such as garlic, manuka honey etc then you can kill \nthe bacteria with resistance as well as the other 1 trillion. \n\nAt the end of the day you are just preventing the inevitable as you said. \nBut with the way we use antibiotics at the moment (poorly) antibiotics that \ncould provide decent protection for most people for 50 years barely last \n10. So the rate at which we need to find new ones is really out of \nproportion.",
