                "text": "Philly looks like a city that hasn't lost its character over the decades. \nNYC & DC, and many other places are gentrifying so fast that it must take a \nlot out of what those cities used to be. I believe NYC is the greatest city \nin the world, and that DC is a great city too, but these places probably \naren't the same as they were decades before. Philly looks like if you've \nbeen there in the 80s and came back today, you'd see that not much has \nchanged. That's probably the thing I love most about the city! I really \nhope I visit the city one day!\ufeff",
