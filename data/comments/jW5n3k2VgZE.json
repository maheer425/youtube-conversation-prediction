Depending on what you're going for, this could be \nvery good or very bad. \nAnother; didn't you say you wanted each episode to stand alone? The plot \nsounds too heavy and complicated to only be one episode (unless you do it \nin 'Parts', example: The Lunar Revolution: Part 1, The Lunar Revolution: \nPart 2; OR The Lunar Revolution: The Mark, The Lunar Revolution: The Sign. \nSo you may want to consider that. But what you've told me sounds more like \nthe premise for a movie. \nIt's completely up to you and your team what you want to do, but this \nsounds a little heavy on the stomach for your first video. Kind of like \nstarting cooking class and expecting to learn how to Souffle a la Escargot \nthe first day. This would be a great Big Project, but I think it may be a \nlittle better if you tried something smaller and simpler to start with, \njust to get the kinks worked out.\nNot too harsh, was it?",

It can help you \nsee flaws that you were to close to see before, and can give you an idea of \nhow your audiences react (even if you don't like it). Look for merit in all \nthat they say, and learn from what you find. And if you find that you \nheavily disagree with what was said, then be civil.

It took six people to animate him, but you could see a massive \ndifference between the first episode and the last one. He used to have very \nlimited motion that always seemed to be off and a little slow. By the last \nepisode, he moved fluidly and a lot faster. Such will probably happen with \nyour videos. Once you get used to it, you have the potential to really take \noff.",

This is a 100% fan created video based off the show My Little \nPony: Friendship Is Magic.\nIf it sparked your interest, I suggest you watch the show from the \nbeginning. Just be forewarned that the first two-parter is not nessessarily \nindicative of what's to come - though you'll want to watch it for the \nestablished characters and settings. It's with episodes 3 and 4 that the \nseries shows its true heading. So if you'd be turned off by a \"Magical \ngirls in Equestria\" type of show, know that it goes another direction.\nIf you're not enchanted by episode 4, it'll probably never \"click\" for you.",

After that, the bronies will be active for like a year maybe \nand then they will get bored of the old material, and the amazing artwork, \nmasterpieces by Tomb and others,the adorable ponies we all know and love... \nWill just be forgotten. What do you think? This worries me, i love ponies \nand the fandom more than 90% of people around me\ufeff",

And Celestia may be the strong leader of the two. \nThey need each other and every pony needs them. Also, I think poor Celestia \ndoesn't get enough credit. Her job has been endless stress. Especially when \nshe was forced to banish her own dear sister. She is rules over all of \nEquestria and must protect her subjects. She, also, is not perfect. She has \nmade mistakes like dating a stallion even if it was dangerous for their \nworlds (Reflections which is a pony comic). Even so, she is expected to be \nperfect in a way. I respect Celestia's character. I love both princesses \nequally.",

This is a really beautiful \npiece of work but not giving any credit what so ever as to the source \nmaterial is a real shame. Even if the extra verses aren't confirmed to have \nbeen done for the movie, the first was and the tune is still from the film. \nReally, you could've given the original author, or at least the original \ncomposer some credit, guys :/\ufeff",

This cover \ntook 1 month to make and she is a perfectionist who has been studying music \nher entire life and is more than capable of editing out anything she didn't \nwant in the final product and has addressed this point herself personally \nbefore as her yodels/turns/ornaments have confused people before, so as a \nfan of hers for 7 years I can say I'm very sure she did do that on purpose, \nglad you like the song but please listen to Birds of a Feather as it is a \nmasterclass on the technique!",

Fuck who am I kidding nobody will sub to me. I don't even have one \nvideo with over 500 views. Yet all the retarded motherfuckers on you tube \nget millions of views.Give me advice. I am also have no experience as a \nanimator so I would need people to do it for me. Also a voice of Luna. My \nidea is like two best sisters play but with just Luna, an actual Luna voice\ufeff",

But it doesn't change when she flies, where as any \nnormal mane or tail would be flying backwards almost in a straight line, \nbut her hair isn't. Could her hair be in another dimension, maybe? \nInvisible wind is the only thing that touches her hair, obviously. Her mane \nand tail *does* look like it has a galaxy inside it, anyway. Anyone else \nhave a comment or idea about this subject? Plz nothing rude.\ufeff",

She'd likely \nfly back down and get them food if they got hungry.\nThe black thing they defeated is called discord and hes like an evil \nchimera since his body is a mishmash of random animal parts.

Luna defeats Sombra, and \nbanished his whole empire! But unbeknownst to Celestia, she was infected by \nthe nightmare force... She did her best to fight it... To conceal it... \nYears passed and eventually Discord's reign had nearly conquered all of \nEquestria. The sisters defeated him and rebuilt the kingdom... And Luna \nconsidered creating her own kingdom, whether it was her idea of the \nnightmare force that does not matter. Celestia was starting to see the \ndarkness in her sister that had been growing ever since that fight with \nSombra. She feared what might become of Luna, and she feared Luna's kingdom \nbecoming like the Crystal Empire. This is why she refused... But the \ndarkness only grew... And Luna, innocent in her own mind, listened to the \nwhisper of the nightmare force... And began to build behind her sisters \nback... You can even hear her slight corruption as she sings about the \nperception of life \"murdering beauty and passion\"... But she's not \nNightmare Moon yet... I'm going I go check out Daylight's End over at Silly \nFilly Studios' channel... I may add more there\ufeff",

Perhaps in a universe wherein Discord betrayed the elements and \ntook over once more.\nThe city of Canterlot has already been established at this point, and the \nstatue at the beginning looks uncannily like Twilight Sparkle - perhaps a \ncasualty of the war? I don't see this as a start-of-darkness for Luna/NMM \nin this case (she's appreciated by her 'children', and she's not exactly \nmalevolent - controlling, maybe, but even then not that much), and you can \nsee a pony that resembles (though clearly isn't) Sweetie Belle - a \ndescendant, perhaps? Maybe an ancestor, if it takes place prior to the \nseries, but still.\nGod damn it, now I have to either read or write a fanfic based on this. \nUnless there's already one? I can't imagine this song not having a fanfic \nalready.\ufeff",

For \nafter such a great lack of harmony she thought it could shatter the kingdom \nforever. \n\nBeing denied and in the shadow of her own sister, Luna decided to carry on \nwith her plan, and ask for forgiveness rather than permission.",

It just really rubs me off the wrong way how it is \nportrayed, especially since it seems to be using this common stupid \nfancanon that celestia is basically a tyrant (despite nothing in the show \nsays that, and a lot of it says the opposite) and Luna as this some kind of \na genius that was more forward thinking (despite the fact that of the two \nshe holds more traits of the old world, such as the royal canterlot voice). \nIt doesn't help that half the people in this comment section basically are \nputting in comments that could be summed up as \"Luna can not do any wrong\", \nwhich is really infuriating seeing as she was the first VILLAIN in the show.",

The singer's voice cracks at 2:16, but this is owed to \nthe poor production of the video; the flaw is not present in Erutan's \nrecording.\n\nWhy this has 67,987 likes, I do not know. Perhaps it's because bronies are \naccustomed to being fed shit and applauding mediocrity. Just look at the \nshow they watch! A disgrace is such work, and all who enjoy it should be \nthoroughly ashamed of themselves. \ufeff",

They go around and try to make a story, \nso they intentionally pick some of the worst, most outrageous people in the \nentire fandom to interview and then try to pass it off as the \"normal\" \ngroup. The Entertainment Media horribly screwed over the Furry fandom back \nduring the 1980's and have been try to continue on it since then, but  the \n Furry fandom has gotten a little wiser. They've got the right people \nbehind them, like Kage, or, as most furries call him, \"Uncle Kage.\" He's \nthe main overseer of the major Furry conventions like Anthrocon and he \nessentially bars certain media outlets from entering and only lets in local \nnews stations because they tend to be far  less bias and will report what \nthe solely find. Any entertainment media groups are quickly kicked out in \norder to prevent them from screwing around and demonizing them any further. \n\nWith the Brony Fandom, it's a similar thing. The Entertainment media sank \ntheir teeth into us and fed on us for money. They found the absolute worst \nparts they could find and them exploited them in order to make money off of \nus, while destroying our public image from the get-go. So, we're in the \nsame boat and, in order to improve ourselves, we need to start improving \nour  public image by, for example, creating our own charities and setting \nan overall better example for the entire fandom.
