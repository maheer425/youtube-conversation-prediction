According to the Malachy Prophecy, this is the Last \nPope....THe signs are all here for Christ's second coming. The BIBLE \ndemands us to take note of the \"signs\" of the last days. We have them all : \n\"terrorism, moral corruption, godlessness...\" St. Paul tells us that 2 \nthings must happen first before the end comes: 1. THe Apostasy---that seems \nto be happening everywhere! 2. The Antichrist---He has not made his \nappearance yet, but be certain, he is in the world already.....These 2 \nthings must happen....and we are closer to Christ's second coming now more \nthan ever! MANY of the SAINTS tell us in their prophecies that the CHURCH \nand the WORLD will become one. Bishop SHeen stated that \" the Church will \nsplit into two...\"\nQuote from BISHOP SHEEN:::\n\"The Antichrist will not be so called; otherwise he would have no \nfollowers. He will not wear red tights, nor vomit sulphur, nor carry a \ntrident nor wave an arrowed tail as Mephistopheles in Faust. This \nmasquerade has helped the Devil convince men that he does not exist. When \nno man recognizes, the more power he exercises. God has defined Himsel as \n\"I am Who am,\" and the Devil as \"I am who am not.\"\n    Nowhere in Sacred Scripture do we find warrant for the popular myth of \nthe Devil as a buffoon who is dressed like the first \"red.\" Rather is he \ndescribed as an angel fallen from heaven, as \"the Prince of this world,\" \nwhose business it is to tell us that there is no other world. His logic is \nsimple: if there is no heaven there is no hell; if there is no hell, then \nthere is no sin; if there is no sin, then there is no judge, and if there \nis no judgment then evil is good and good is evil. But above all these \ndescriptions, Our Lord tells us that he will be so much like Himself that \nhe would deceive even the elect--and certainly no devil ever seen in \npicture books could deceive even the elect. How will he come in this new \nage to win followers to his religion?\n    The pre-Communist Russian belief is that he will come disguised as the \nGreat Humanitarian; he will talk peace, prosperity and plenty not as means \nto lead us to God, but as ends in themselves. . . .\n    . . . The third temptation in which Satan asked Christ to adore him and \nall the kingdoms of the world would be His, will become the temptation to \nhave a new religion without a Cross, a liturgy without a world to come, a \nreligion to destroy a religion, or a politics which is a religion--one that \nrenders unto Caesar even the things that are God's.\n    In the midst of all his seeming love for humanity and his glib talk of \nfreedom and equality, he will have one great secret which he will tell to \nno one: he will not believe in God. Because his religion will be \nbrotherhood without the fatherhood of God, he will deceive even the elect. \nHe will set up a counterchurch which will be the ape of the Church, because \nhe, the Devil, is the ape of God. It will have all the notes and \ncharacteristics of the Church, but in reverse and emptied of its divine \ncontent. It will be a mystical body of the Antichrist that will in all \nexternals resemble the mystical body of Christ. . . .\n    . . . But the twentieth century will join the counterchurch because it \nclaims to be infallible when its visible head speaks ex cathedra from \nMoscow on the subject of economics and politics, and as chief shepherd of \nworld communism.\n \n(Fulton J. Sheen, Communism and the Conscience of the West [Bobbs-Merril \nCompany, Indianapolis, 1948], pp. 24-25)",

The Christian God wanted us to be good and \nhelp others and give of ourselves... Then programmed us to do the exact \nopposite? And then he gave us free will, created laws against our \nprogramming.. And then blamed us for doing what we are naturally imposed to \ndo?\n\nLet me... Stop right there...

That is a narcissistic view.\" Ok \nfirst off narcissistic means \"having an excessive or erotic interest in \noneself and one's physical appearance:\" ... I don't think that's what you \nmeant... Capitalism is entirely based on wanting what someone else has. AKA \ngreed jealousy and envy. If mankind were to STOP being greedy jealous and \nenvious capitalism would break down, and would have to find another \neconomic system to adapt to.\n\n\"IN FACT: Capitalism is economic freedom !\"\nI agree with you on this. I think it is a bit hasty to call it a \"FACT\" \nbecause I have heard arguments against capitalism. It is by no means \nperfect, and can cause corruption and poverty. BUT! I nevertheless agree. \nCapitalism I think is the best form of economic structure that we can \nuphold right now. I mean in THEORY Communism should work GREAT! but the end \nresult is a corrupt dictatorial government. So while capitalism could work \nbetter, it does a pretty good job.\n\nAs for the rest of your words that's AWESOME! I love it. It is always great \nto see people sharing what they have gained with other people.\n\nNow again if I may remind you. The Bible names greed.. a \"God given human \ntrait\" as a DEADLY SIN in the old testament. Something gives me the odd \nfeeling God didn't like capitalism so much. And while the new testament \ndoes not say greed is a deadly sin.. It still calls greed jealousy and envy \na sin.. So Christian religions really should not be in support of a \neconomic structure that thrives on people being jealous of something \nsomeone else has.\n\nAlthough biblically Christian religious people shouldn't even be in \npolitics. The Bible repeats over and over that Christians are no part of \nthis world, and should never be part of this world.... Although there is a \nlot of scriptures in the Bible that seemed to get ignored a lot.\n\nSo back to my previous compliment! I want to compliment the new Pope on \nstaying true to biblical ideology, and focusing on the poor and living a \nmodest life himself.",

But if guess your boy \nfrom Duck Dynasty, Fox news and most southeastern rupublicans hates \nMuslims, Gays etc in the name of jesus.

So \nthe Pastor can get a free ride with his non profit church, that his cars, \nJet, Home and everything else he owns is Tax free. That my friend is a \nHypocrite. The new pope is actually following the teachings of GOD in which \nFOX news, and Most Southern Conservitives hate the most. Like most of them \nthey thought racism, killing blacks, raping their women and hanging them in \nJesus name with a burning cross is christian. Just like wesborough baptist \nchruch disrupts funerals and says soldeirs that fought for our country \ndeserved to die in jesus name is Hypocritical and biggotry.

As the Catholic Church, they're \nsupposed to speak out and say that indeed homosexuality is a sin. \n\"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of \nGod? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor \nadulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality\" 1 Corinthians 6:9\nAnd Jesus in John 2:15 makes a whip and chases the money changers out. I \ndunno how many there were but I'm guessing He was out-numbered, considering \nthe plural and multiple trades.\nJesus wasn't some \"turn the other cheek\" wimp when it came to sin! He was \nvery outspoken against it. As should the Catholic Church be!\nThat, and Christians don't follow the Pope.\nI'm thinking by the very sarcastic tone you had that you may be an \nunbeliever? Jesus Christ can be verified in history. He is the way the \ntruth and the life.\nSure, it's hard to get into heaven when you're rich. That is because you \ngain a love for the world when you have more stuff and you store up \nworthless treasures instead of treasuring the true treasure, the Lord Jesus \nChrist.\n\"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust \ndestroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves \ntreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves \ndo not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart \nwill be also.\" Matthew 6:19-21\nIf your treasure is in this world, you'll perish just like this world is \nbound to.\n\"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the \nfirst earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.\" Revelation 21:1\nI can only present facts, it's the Holy Spirit that convicts and saves, but \nseriously.

They happened, the bible records the history of the \nJews and other nations.\nIt's to be expected, right? We see these things today and sadly people \nstill do them. If I told you that some guy named James Holmes killed a lot \nof people in a movie theater, that's not me endorsing his actions; that's \nme telling you the facts.\nThe bible explicitly says that fornication is forbidden! That's why \nSolomon, David, and Israel of Jeremiah's time were punished severely! Many \npeople died at the hand of God for their unholy acts of murder, rape and \nadultery. Either died or had the sword enter their family but those \nbehaviors are explicitly forbidden.\nGenocide did happen, it was how Israel got into the promised land. It was \nfrom the hand of God, He saw the great wickedness the lands that they were \nabout to go into had committed and it was God's judgment that was declared \nupon them through his people, the Israelis.\nGod also cast fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah for their \nwickedness of sodomy, God does not endorse sin or take it lightly; in the \ncase of the people who inhabited the fertile crescent, God sent people to \ntake them down.\nAs for the dark ages, ignorant Christians did some ignorant things. I can't \nsay that is what true Christians ought to do, we ought to learn more about \nGod and the world around us. I can't make up for what they did, but I can \nsay it was wrong! And so were the Crusades, and so was the Spanish \nInquisition!! When Christians break the word of God they aren't much of a \nChristian, rather the object of God's wrath and boy did it end badly for a \nlot of those people. I mean let's face it, they're an example of why you \noppose Christianity, obviously their actions yield consequence.\n\n+Chilltoad That's true. I don't doubt God's created other inhabitable \nplanets out there. Planets we can't get to so we may as well not concern \nourselves with it at current. Maybe someday we'll be able to explore them, \nbut that day is not today so drop it.\nThere was a worldwide flood, don't you think that messed up the environment \njust a little bit? Scientists are right when they say there was a Pangaea \n(one landmass) even the bible claims that. The flood caused catastrophic \ndamage to the Earth we know and love, that's why people don't live to be \n700 years old anymore; this world is even more broken than it was after God \nhad inflicted a curse on it in Genesis 3.\nGod made the stars and the heavens to declare His majesty, His ultimate \npower! He didn't make them so we could go live there, I'm sure He \nanticipated us wanting to move out of this planet and made it quite \nimpossible for us. Even if we could get light-speed travel it would prove \nuseless cause we wouldn't be able to reach these supposed \"inhabitable \nplanets\" in our lifetime; and considering Revelations doesn't mention \nHumans living on another planet, I don't think we'll ever be able to move \nanywhere else.\nLike I've said before, we live in a fallen world. Yes, there's going to be \nearthquakes; \"We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the \npains of childbirth right up to the present time.\" Romans 8:22 If you fear \nthe uncontrollable Earth, then you do good to fear! For you have little \ninfluence or control; even secular sources say that our sense of control is \nbut an illusion!\n\n\"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather \nfear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\" Matthew 10:28. Do you \nthink this world is all there is? There's a greater promise of Heaven that \nawaits us and God has said it! He is faithful all through eternity! This \nworld is broken! But one day He will renew and make perfect the world once \nmore!\n\n\"The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is \npatient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should \nreach repentance.\"\n2 Peter 3:9",

In fact, until around 2005, the only way to run for office, even at \nthe lowest level, was to be a member of the Communist party. However, now, \nyou can even be a candidate against the party and still run for lower level \noffices, such as mayor. The amount of executions in China is also \ndecreasing. Back in the 1990's, China executed around 25,000 people a year \non average. By 2005, it had decreased to around 10,000. Today, the annual \namount of executions is around 2,000. The amount of executions in China has \nbeen falling by around 10% every year for the last several years. In 2006, \nChina even made a law that says that all death sentences have to go before \nthe Supreme Court, and nearly 20% of death sentences that go to the Supreme \nCourt are commuted.\n\nInterestingly, China stopped executing juveniles nearly a decade before the \nUSA did. China stopped executing juveniles around 1997, while the USA only \nstopped executing juveniles in 2004. However, I doubt that China will ever \nbecome \"Western\" in the way we perceive the definition. China, in about \n15-20 years, might become \"Western\" in the sense that some people consider \ncountries like South Korea, Japan and the Philippines to be Western, but I \ndoubt that China will ever get any closer than that. \n\nApparently, a few years ago, the Chinese government has even started a \nprogramme to end homelessness. Their solution is to give a sort of stipend \nfor low level individuals and families, and give them small apartments to \nlive in. Right now, there are millions who live in slum neighbourhoods, but \nthe government is working on a solution for it. Remember too, there are now \nMillennium generation Chinese joining the government, who tend to have a \nmore moderate view on society. They will also likely have an influence on \nchanging the government in China. And while about 75-80% of older Chinese \nstill favours the death penalty in China, most younger Chinese are either \nagainst it altogether, or think that it should be used less frequently.",

If you would look at the USSR when it existed, \nyou will see that even in that \"Union\" the countries were vastly different \nfrom one another.

This is ridiculous.\n\n-To my knowledge, Jesus never said anything about using the government to \nhelp the poor. It's true that he said that you should help the poor, but he \ndidn't say that you must support government programs that are supposedly \nintended to help them. If a person disagrees with using the government to \nhelp the poor, for whatever reason, but still believes in helping the poor, \nI don't see how they're going against anything that Jesus said.\n\n-If God believes that those who have should help those in need, why are \nthere still people in need?

He could instantly end all \npoverty, cure all diseases, and take away all suffering, and it wouldn't \ncost him a thing. So why doesn't he?

A free market is one in which the government places no \nregulation on what people can and can't sell, buy, in what quantities, by \nwhat means, etc. That does not exclude slavery as a business. Neither does \na market regulated by the government. Hell, neither does a mostly free \nmarket with some regulation, among those the illegalization of a slave \ntrade, because that's what we have now and we still have slavery in this \ncountry due to corruption, negligence, and cultural ignorance. However, did \npeople make money from slaves when they were free to sell them? Yup. There \njust isn't any getting around that. Did that make the lives of everyone \ninvolved better? Obviously I don't need to answer that.",

You haven't explained why that matters.\n\nYour claim that rich people would only donate half the amount that poor \npeople do now if they were also poor is a fallacy. You're assuming that \npeople always spend the same percentage on everything no matter how much \nmoney they have. If someone makes $10k a year and spends $1k a year on \ngroceries, that doesn't necessarily mean that, if that same person made $1 \nmillion a year, they'd spend $100k a year on groceries.\n\nAlso, unless you're expecting everyone to become poor, what difference does \nit make how much rich people would donate if they were poor? All that \nmatters is how much they donate now that they're rich, which is a lot.\n\nWhat difference does it make whether people vote for the actual government \nprograms themselves or on representatives who vote for the programs? If \nanything, that just makes my point more valid, because, not only do voters \nhave to research all the different potential welfare programs, but they \nalso have to research all the candidates to find out who is in favor of \nwhich programs. So MORE research is required than would be in regard to \nfiguring out which charity to donate to. Smarten up.\n\nWhat part of \"free market\" doesn't allow slavery? Gee, I don't know...

For you to argue that government funded and enforced \nslavery is part of the free market, you must either be incredibly stupid or \nincredibly dishonest.

Which to me and I think most people obviously \nsounds insane.

And the fact that sometimes people who own \nwilderness don't destroy it doesn't mean they make any effort to manage it, \nwhich is equally harmful, and it doesn't erase all the damage done by \npeople who did destroy wilderness on land they owned for no reason except \npersonal profit.

You can't \naccuse me of just assuming things that I've provided evidence for. That \nisn't being very honest.\n\nMaybe people wouldn't research charities very well before donating to them, \nbut then why would you assume that they'd research government welfare \nprograms before voting for them? You can't have it both ways. Either people \nwill research charities, in which case there's no reason why charity can't \nbe a reliable solution, or they won't, in which case they won't research \ngovernment welfare programs either.\n\nWho is kidnapped? I'm not sure who you're referring to. If you mean the \ndiamond miners, it's not a free market situation if they're being \nkidnapped. So I'm not sure what that has to do with anything that I'm \nadvocating.\n\nI never advocated child labor. I don't think it should be illegal for \nchildren to work, but I'm not saying whether they should or shouldn't. That \ndepends on what they want to do and the particular circumstances involved.\n\n\"Because it's necessary\" does not answer my question. First you must \nestablish that we have the right to do something before you can argue \nwhether or not we need to do it, or if it's a good idea. Telling me that we \nneed to do something doesn't explain what gives us the right to do it, \nunless you're saying that we have the right to do anything that we need to \ndo. If that's the case, who gets to decide what we need to do? The \nmajority? What about when the majority decided that we needed to have \nslaves? Did that make it right?\n\nIf you're claiming that any deforestation is wrong, you're going to have to \nmake the case for that. Also, most government property is the product of \ndeforestation as well; so, again, I don't see how the government offers an \nalternative.\n\nIf you're not claiming that any deforestation is bad, but you are instead \nclaiming that all privatization of land results in deforestation, your \nclaim is demonstrably false. We have examples of privately owned land where \nforests are preserved. Since there's way more land than we actually need \nfor living on or building communities on, it's hard to imagine why anyone \nwould spend the money to chop down all the trees covering the land that we \ndon't use. It seems like that would just be a tremendous waste of their own \nresources, and they'd gain nothing from it.\n\nIf you're not claiming either of those things, I have no idea what you're \nclaiming.\n\nWhen a government gives a contract to a private business, no other \nbusinesses are allowed to compete with that business. I can't open my own \ncompeting prison down the street.\n\nActually, I've never heard any definition of a government that could exist \nin a truly free market. Governments are inherently the opposite of free \nmarkets. You could have a mostly free market with a small government that \nonly did certain things, but whatever aspects of the market that were \naffected by the government would not be free. So, in your example of a \ngovernment contracting a private prison, that prison would not be part of \nthe free market.\n\nAre you honestly asking me why government enforced slavery isn't a product \nof the free market? Now you're just being ridiculous. Anything that is \nfunded through taxation is not a product of the free market. This is \nespecially the case when the thing that's being funded is the ownership of \nother human beings.\n\nAnything that's funded through taxation has nothing to do with the free \nmarket. If the government forces people to fund something through their \ntaxes, then the government is controlling the demand. This isn't rocket \nscience.",

I don't \nknow what to say, except that you are one seriously optimistic dude.\n\nNo, they're kidnapped. I knew you had some strange ideas, but I'm honestly \nstunned.

An individual shouldn't be allowed to lock a person \nhe's convinced is a murderer in his basement, but that doesn't mean we \nshouldn't have prisons or a justice system. Like it or not, SOMEONE has to \ndecide what to do in the event of war, or natural disaster, or food \ndistribution. It stands to reason that the most equitable and rational way \nto do this is to give the people as much choice as possible by having \ndecisions made by their democratically elected representatives.\n\nNow, back to your earlier points:\n\"People tend to take much better care of private property than they do of \nunowned property or public property. The way to best protect and preserve \nthe environment would be to privatize as much land as possible.\"\nWell, we live in a highly privatized landscape and deforestation is \nabundant and constant. The reasons are obvious. They don't \"take better \ncare of it\", they develop it to make money. Literally the real estate term \nfor wilderness is \"unimproved land\". I live right near a floodplain forest \nof centuries old silver maple which citizens are currently trying to keep \nits owner from destroying to build an apartment complex. \nFirst Nations did not regard their land as private property beyond it being \nowned by the tribe, and they managed to form an immensely beneficial \nsymbiotic relationship with the wilderness. The only surviving forests of \nsignificant size in my area are reservations maintained by the towns and \ncities that contain them. What you're saying is completely contradictory to \neverything we know about capitalism and the environment. Please, show me \nsome evidence that privatizing wilderness supports it.\n\nHow does the government \"enforce\" private prison monopolies? The prison is \nselling a product, the government is purchasing it. A free market is one \nwherein the government is not controlling the supply and demand. That \ndoesn't mean a government can't exist or buy services. And the inmates are \nworking at slave wages for the profit of the prison itself because there is \nno- say it with me- regulation to stop them. In your model the prison \nshould be making money by making the inmates' lives better, yet they're \nmaking money through exploitation. Why? Because it's easier to make money \nthrough exploitation, of course.\n\nBy the same token, how does a government retrieving what was legally \nregarded as lost property anti-free market? The slave trade existed with \nthe intent of making money, and claimed human beings as a commodity. There \nis nothing anti-free market about that either.\n\nAnd again, what about a free market necessitates the government doesn't buy \nanything with tax dollars? You seem to have your own definition of what a \nfree market is wherein it's only a free market if the government not only \nputs no regulation on it, but doesn't even interact with it or handle money \nwhatsoever.",

We can't \ndelegate rights that we don't have in any other situation. For example, I \ndon't have the right to sell your house. So I can't hire my brother to sell \nyour house for me. How is it that this changes when it comes to the \ngovernment, and we suddenly are able to delegate rights that we don't have?\n\nNot everyone who is opposed to welfare programs is against helping the poor \nin other ways. Your implication that none of the people who are against \nwelfare want to help the poor is demonstrably false, because there are \nplenty of examples of people who are against welfare, but who do help the \npoor in other ways.\n\nAs I already explained in my previous post, we wouldn't need every single \nperson who is currently paying into welfare to pay into charity in order \nfor it to be as efficient. This is because more of the money that goes into \ncharity actually goes to the people that need it. About 70% of the money \nthat goes into private charities gets to the people who need it, where as \nonly about 30% of the money that goes into government welfare programs gets \nto the people who need it. Here is a source: \nhttp://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_1.pdf\n\nSo, even if only half of the money that currently goes into welfare went \ninto private charities instead, the poor would actually receive more money, \nbecause 70% of 50 is more than 30% of 100.\n\nAnd just to clear up the apparent misunderstanding, I don't mean that 30% \nof the overall amount that everyone pays in taxes goes to the poor. I mean \nthat only 30% of the part of your taxes that goes into welfare actually \nends up going to the poor.\n\nIn a free society, if someone voluntarily agrees to take a job like mining \nfor diamonds, it must necessarily be because they would be better off \ntaking that job than whatever the alternative would be. Otherwise, why \nwould they agree to take that job?\n\nThere isn't anything inherently wrong with drug dealing or prostitution. If \nsomeone wants to do those things, they should be free to do them. If people \nwho don't really want to do those things are pressured into doing them due \nto economic situations, this is because the government has taken away their \nother options. By placing price controls on labor, the government has made \nit more difficult for people who are less productive to find work. By \nartificially increasing the cost of living through taxation and inflation, \nthe government has made it even more difficult for those who are able to \nfind work to make a living wage. The government also artificially increases \nthe value of drugs and prostitution by enforcing prohibition laws. If \nsomething is prohibited, it becomes harder to get, and is therefore more \nvaluable. For all these reasons, many poor people end up turning to things \nlike drug dealing and prostitution.\n\nPeople tend to take much better care of private property than they do of \nunowned property or public property. The way to best protect and preserve \nthe environment would be to privatize as much land as possible.\n\nPrivate prisons have nothing to do with the free market. They are \ncontracted by the government, allowed to have government enforced \nmonopolies, and lock people up who have violated government made and \nenforced laws.\n\nSlavery also had nothing to do with the free market. Slavery was funded and \nenforced by the government. The government made it illegal for slaves to \nescape from their masters. If a slave escaped, the government would use tax \npayer money to have that slave caught and returned to his or her master. \nSlave owners wouldn't have been able to enforce slavery on their own. In \nBrazil, slavery actually ended because the government stopped funding it, \nand the slave owners couldn't afford to go after their slaves who escaped. \nAs soon as the slaves realized this, they all just took off and there was \nnothing their masters could do about it.\n\nDo I even need to explain why the military industrial complex has nothing \nto do with the free market? The only way that anyone can profit off of war \nis if people are forced to pay for it by the government.\n\nIt's getting exhausting having to type out these long posts, and I can't \npossibly address every single one of the 50 billion things you blamed the \nfree market for.

If rich people would be so readily \nwilling to give the large amounts of money necessary to charity to \nadequately support the poor without tax revenue, why do they currently \nprove to be less generous than people far less wealthy than them? Oh right, \nyour completely unfounded theory that they just don't give more money \nbecause they have to pay taxes and are thus unaware of the increasingly \nunsustainable hardships our working class deals with in this country.\nSome certainly would. Many others wouldn't. As it is even the ones who \nwouldn't have to give something. Again, your argument rests on this \nunfounded faith in humanity that is completely contradictory to the free \nmarket capitalist philosophy the rich people you trust so much became \nwealthy from in the first place.\nUh, read up on how the US government works? They have the authority because \nwe gave them that authority when we elected them, obviously, and the huge \nmajority of the population, even most conservatives, agree that people \nshould pay taxes. I don't know what else to tell you. Are you an anarchist \nor something?",

If you want to argue about American foreign policy, I'm \nsure you can find a million places to talk about that on the Internet. That \nhas nothing to do with this discussion.\n\nAlso, Blob, since you don't ever bother addressing any of the points I \nmake, I'm not going to waste any more of my time attempting to have a \nconversation with you. You're muted.\n\n+ebutym11225 I'm not aware of anyone who makes that claim. If there are \npeople who make that claim, that sounds like a question that you should ask \nthem.\n\n+americanslime Rich people give way more money to charities than poor \npeople. I'm not sure what difference it makes what percentage of their \noverall income they give you. Would you be better off receiving $1k from a \nguy who makes $15k a year, or $10k from Bill Gates? Of course you'd much \nrather have the $10k, even though it's a much smaller percentage of Gates' \noverall income than the $1k is of the guy who makes $15k a year's income.\n\nAs I explained, having government welfare programs causes people to give \nless to charities than they would otherwise by creating the illusion that \nthe poor are already being helped. If not for those programs, people would \ngive much more to charity than they already do. How do I know this? Because \nlots of people, including many rich people, support government welfare \nprograms. So, if those programs didn't exist, there's no conceivable reason \nwhy the people who support having them wouldn't just give the money that \nthey're currently paying into welfare programs to charities to help the \npoor instead. Why wouldn't they?\n\nWhat gives Congress the authority to give the government the power to \nforcefully take money from people?",

Also, the \ncharities being donated to are hardly ever directed at working class \nAmericans. They're generally given to churches (of which a small portion \ngoes to any number of different charitable efforts, but mainly pays for the \npriest's salary and church maintenance) and foreign aid organizations. To \nexaggerate this as evidence that they would readily donate enough money to \nsupport the working class, you're going to need to provide some actual \nfacts that would indicate that. If you think the rich would readily provide \nfor the poor of their own free will, you've apparently never watched fox \nnews.\nThey have the right because congress has given them the right, obviously. I \nbelieve that is the right thing to do because 1) it is the job of the state \nto ensure that everyone has adequate food, water, work and housing. The \nfree market has no realistic answer for how to provide these things, so \nit's necessary that the government redistribute the wealth enough to \nprovide them for those who can't get them by themselves, and 2) I place \nmore trust in the government in which I at least theoretically have a \nrepresentative who will make sure my needs are being met and that I'm being \ntreated fairly than I do in a private corporation in which I have no say \n(and who's clear goal is not to provide for me, but to turn a profit) to \nprovide me with maintained paved roads, traffic lights, water treatment, a \nfire and police department, etc. You may place that unreasonable faith in \nrich people to provide for the rest of us, but most of us know better than \nthat. I see no historical or ideological basis for this faith whatsoever, \nin fact I only see the exact opposite, so I'll stick with paying taxes, \nthanks.",

Hoover greatly \nincreased spending and ran huge deficits. He started make work projects and \nfar supports. He propped up failing firms. \n\nThe crash of 1929 was preceded by a very inflationary monetary policy by \nthe Federal Reserve. The head of the Fed, Benjamin Strong, was trying to \nhelp England return to its pre-war pound-to-gold ratio. They needed U.S. to \ndebase the dollar in order to do that. \n\nThe reason that the Depression lasted so long was due to interventionist \nmethods. Rexford Tugwell, lead New Dealer, admitted years later when he was \nback at Columbia that FDR administration expanded on Hoover's \ninterventionist schemes.\n\nIt's not just the welfare state I have a problem with. It's the monetary \nsystem (Fed, fiat paper currency, rigged interest rates, collectivized \nrisk) that has resulte d in a very distorted capital and labor structure \nwhile concentrating wealth. \n\nCorporatist measures like subsidies, mandates, public private parnterships, \ncollectivized risk, government guarantees, regulations designed to create \nbarriers to entry, etc. are also distorting the economy and resulting in \nundue concentration of wealth.\n\nThe current operational system is not remotely free market. It's a mixed \neconomy.\n\nYou are as clueless as the Pope.",
