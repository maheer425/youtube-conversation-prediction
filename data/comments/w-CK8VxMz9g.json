I can see you \ndon\u2019t have a 3rd grade education, but an average is a middle number from a \nset of numbers. The average of 1, 2, and 3 is 2. Now that you know what an \naverage is, you can see that the date he gave is NOT supposed to be the one \nwhere we all die at once; rather, it is the middle point. Because it is the \naverage, some people will die before and some will die after, just like how \n1 is before 2 and 3 is after 2 (you know that, right?). There are different \nways to measure the middle point, \u201cmode\u201d which he also mentions, is another \nway, hence it is different. It is important to keep in mind that the time \nhe got is based on life expectancies and estimations anyway, and is mostly \njust a probability.  He only gave it to us because it\u2019s interesting \nscience/math stuff, and that\u2019s what his channel is about. \n\nSummary: He didn\u2019t lie and you\u2019re the \u201cFCKING IDIOT\u201d",

Michael said that Abraham Wald told the U.S. military to put \nlittle to no armor on the spots on the planes that were not damaged, while \nthe military was already putting armor on the parts that were being hit. \nThe latter part also seems to be a notion of survivorship bias, like \nMichael mentions the former being. Am I missing an assumption, like Wald \nwas arguing that they should put more armor in the most hit places AND take \naway as much from the places that were not being hit? It seems that to me \nthis is the only way that makes what Michael said to be true. Am I wrong? I \nam really just curious, because I have repeated that section of the video \nnearly 15 times now and it does not make much sense. \ufeff",
