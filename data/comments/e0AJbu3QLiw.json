The lime basil brought me back to the memory \nof that New Yorker who stood as tall as the trees, bowled like a demon and \nalways had a huge cigar with his smile. So this \"scentual science\" \nexperiement hit home with me.\nI am involved with a long time friend who does this very same thing but for \nlife and health. Like many of us who are invested/interested in this \nparticular topic began searching for but not finding anything at all, and \nwhat was found was so dissapointing or had chemicals known for physical \nirritations/carcinogens. Bummed and pissed off by the balls that \nsome retailers had the nerve of asking $22.00 for a tiny bit of product \nthat lacked something that was given the title of smells like such and \nsuch(..fill in the blank for the scents) As a finnicky person this \nmusician/professional friend & photographer of many of our favored \nmetal/stoner bands.. turned to doing it herself.\nWhat resulted in all this time invested resulted in what has been around \nbefore and found once again. Made in limited numbers because there is care \nin whats being shared and We're on that little site called Etsy under Barn \nCat Farm Soap\nWe went out of our way to produce a group of small batch seasonal organic \nsoaps that is intentionally bitch packed with scent! Big for man's hands, \nlong cured and cut by hand. It's addictive once you start smelling \nsomething and want to sniff it again and again. Destin, you are so \nromantic..You are a Great husband!",
