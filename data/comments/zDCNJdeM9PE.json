My only \nproblem is the link with Google+. If we ignore the Google+ part, we mainly \ngot more freedom. Why don't you guys want the freedom to post as much as \nyou want without having to write multiple comments? Spam will be longer as \nwell, but spam can be deleted by the owner of the video, just like before. \nThe only thing that actually got better with the Google+ fuse is the \ncomments, and that's what you complain about? The main thing that sucks in \nthe comments is that you can't reply to everybody, but I'm sure they'll fix \nthat because that option could be abused way too much. Another small thing \nis that you can't reply to older comments, but that will disappear over \ntime, I guess.\ufeff",
