                "text": "I've had dreams that seemed more real than this so called reality, the \nproperties of physics relating to that dream world seemed to be in sync or \nat least conductive to that which I needed or wanted to achieve by pure \nwill power. All my dreams are like that. Growing up I learned to control \nand manage, understand the way things work in the dream reality and little \nby little I have evolved to a state that when I dream, I no longer need to \ngo about things as I would try on earth. I used to run, then leap far, then \nfly and now I just WILL myself where and when I need to be in my dream. \nEven flying seems slow and out dated way of travel compared to the speed of \ntravel via instant thought. I no longer apply the physics of earth to my \nlife in the dream, but instead have learned an entire new way of being. I \nam not only aware that time and matter are simple an Illusion but can \nmanipulate both at will in order to fix or correct events or dream \ntrajectories i am not pleased with. When i wake up usually, this reality \nseems antique, as if I was waking up to a reality of limitations, \ninconsistencies, biased laws of physics, just a watered down, downgraded \nversion of the other reality I call dreams. I have a parallel life that I \ngo to when I sleep, and Its amazing, it takes living this one here on earth \nin order to value and appreciate the other. Its a place that seems like \nearth but its one with you and you are one with it, it responds to you and \nfacilitates anything you desire by just Willing it to happen with absolute \ntrust. For example on earth here, you must make things happen but external \nwork and force one bit at a time, the elements will not work with you, \nmatter is not under your mental command. In the dream world everything is \nconnected and there is no need for brute force, Imagination is amplified as \na form of vision and matter is at your command. Pain and death are also \nsimple illusions there, if you believe you can die, you will and then wake \nup, but if you know for fact that you are immortal in the dream world then \nno matter what you just dont die, in fact in my experience, the episodes \nthat used to relate to dying have stopped after i repeatedly defeated them \nby simply refusing to die, knowing I cant be killed. its very interesting, \nand this goes for other challenges in the dream world, one I master a \nconcept I rarely experience it again, instead the level of difficulty and \ntrickiness increases, as if trying to test me in other ways to see if I \nhave truly mastered the idea or not. Its cool, i don't know why it happens \nbut I'm grateful it does. My most amazing experiences in this life have \nbeen the ones I have had in the dream world. Nothing comes close on earth. \nIts like comparing the game play of a PS4 to a old 8 bit Atari. I wish I \ncould dream 24/7.        \ufeff",

Scientists have discovered many almost 98% of our \nactions ans thoughts come from somewhere else beyond the brain, we act out \nwhat we think we think, but in reality the impulse and master thought or \noverriding will come from some place else and we only follow it, its all \nwith in fractions of micro seconds but its detectable. So in fact I wonder \nare we simply a character of our higher self playing a game.    ",

It is more like a metaphor \n(a figure of speech in which a term or phrase is applied to something to \nwhich it is not literally applicable in order to suggest a \nresemblance). Dreaming is an experience that we know in our dualistic life, \nand, by referring to our life experience as a dream, mystics are pointing \nto the similarity of the unreality of our experience on earth, to the ever \nchanging forms we experience, to the hallucinatory nature of our \nexperience,  and even to the fact that the characters and stories in the \ndream are projected from our unawakened mind.",

It can certainly be a useful \ntool to help us loosen our attachments and help us forgive the world we \nsee. It can also be used to delay, justify wrong-mindedness, distantiate, \netc...it seems to me that the belief, like all things, boils down to what \nit is for, what it's purpose is, because that determines what it will be \nused for.\n\"Once upon a time I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and \nthither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of \nmy happiness as butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and \nthere I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a \nman dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I \nam a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. \nThe transition is called the transformation of material things.\" ~Chuang \nTzu (c. 369 BC \u2013 c. 286 BC)",
