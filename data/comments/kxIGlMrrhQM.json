This is a complicated statement because there is Macro-evolution \nand Micro-evolution. Macro-evolution is of the mindset that every creature \nevolved from a lessor creature. The Darwinian concept is like a tree \nbranching out new species from one species, however, evidence does not \nsupport this theory. In fact there were more different kinds of species \nmillions of years ago than there are now. Macro-evolution just does NOT \nhappen, however, micro-evolution can be observed as small adaptations to \nthe environment. For years mankind has been searching for the 'missing \nlink' to connect Neanderthal to Cro-Magnon. Thanks to genetic sequencing we \ndiscovered that there is no missing link. Neanderthal was a completely \ndifferent kind of human, now extinct, with no genetic markers comparable to \nCro-Magnon (from whom we descended from). So Darwin's theory is invalid, \neven by Darwin's own standards which he included in his book (see \nIrreversible Complexity). It takes more \"religion\" to believe in Evolution \n(macro) than to believe in Intelligent Design.

And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the \nretard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to \nmake more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out \nof the ocean with its mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a \nsquirrel or something and made retard frog-sqirrel. Then *that* had a \nretard baby which was a... monkey-fish-frog... And then this \nmonkey-fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and that monkey had a \nmutant retard baby that screwed another monkey... and that made you! So \nthere you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex \nwith a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!",

                    "text": "The most accurate answer is probably \"chimp-like ancestor.\" There are \nactually some features of chimps that are more derivative than ours (e.g., \nspine, feet), meaning that they changed more over time compared to our \ntheoretical divergence. Basically, from the neck up, humans changed more, \nbut from the neck down, chimps have changed more.\n\nWhen we look at specimens like Lucy and Ardi, we get a better idea of what \nour ancestor looks like, but we can't really know for certain what our \ncommon ancestor truly looks like because that kind of thing isn't really \nwell-defined. We can look at each specimen individually, but we can't \ncreate a well-defined group that allows us to really say, \"These specimens \nbelong to the same species.\"\n\nTo maybe get away from the topic a little, any given species is more of a \nuseful name than an actual, well-defined group. Sure, we can look at \nseveral different kinds of apes and say this is a chimp, baboon, etc., but \nwhen you stretch this over millions of years and leave behind only \nskeletons/fossils, it gets a bit more complicated and much more difficult. \nIs this skull heavily distorted, or is it really a different kind of ape? \nDoes this particular bone warrant a new classification within this species? \nWhat is a mutation and what is something that belongs to something we may \nbe able to call a species? These problems all arise partly because the \nsample size is relatively small, and some of the details can be considered \nto be relatively trivial. It's also a bit of a philosophical question, \nwhich I'm not really qualified to comment on.",

Is it a good idea to store batteries in a refrigerator or freezer? \n\nNo, storage in a refrigerator or freezer is not required or recommended for \nbatteries produced today. Cold temperature storage can in fact harm \nbatteries if condensation results in corroded contacts or label or seal \ndamage due to extreme temperature storage. To maximize performance and \nshelf life, store batteries at normal room temperatures (68\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F or \n20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) with moderated humidity levels (35 to 65% RH).\n\nRead more at http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/battery.asp#qqiQ3XWzg3XGARmm.99",

What he meant was 'berliner' in \nthe sense of being someone who lives in Berlin but the word also translates \nto 'doughnut'. When meaning someone who lives in Berlin, grammatically \n'ein' would not be used which is why it was translated the other way. \nAlthough, as it is one word with two meanings, everyone would know what he \nmeant, the translation is still correct as it's a matter of grammar rather \nthan the words themselves. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!\ufeff",
