I apologize for wasting people's time.\n\nI think one of the problems might be the fact that we (Europeans) encounter \nmany americans online, but omly ~10% of Americans have ever left the \ncountry, (This is a fact I heard from a travelling American, trying to fix \nforeign relations and impressions of America) and many of these same people \n(who never left their country) are spewing their nationalistic ideals \neverywhere on the internet. It kinda gets enough after a while. If said \nperson never has been to any other country, or outside the continent of \nNorth America, said person has no way of knowing whether the US is the best \ncountry in the world, regardless of the nationalistic agenda the republican \nparty + the major tv networks spew into your faces through the TV.\n\nThe same guy that told me about the passport issue with the US, also made \nme open my eyes to the American media, and the general american fright of \nforeign things, regardless of their own decendence.\n\nI do apologize for my fellow europeans, though. In the same way Americans \ncannot control the rest of their continents opinions, we cannot do so. \n(legally)\n\nHaving been in the US, I can confirm that it is indeed a completely \ndifferent place than the one I imagined, given all the prepubescent teebags \nhanging around the internet. In the same way, you'd be shocked if you ever \ncame to Norway. We do not have polar bears in our streets (Well...

Oahu was in desperate need of some highways to move \nthe traffic in and out of Honolulu--it has horrific traffic problems--so \nthe locals and the state DOT came up with H-1, H-2 and H-3 to get the \nfederal government to pay for almost all of it.  At the U.S. highway level, \nsuch as U.S. 1 and the old Route 66, the feds and the states shared the \ncost of those roads 50-50.  Anything lower on the pecking order such as \ncounty roads and city streets generally gets paid for at those levels; \nstate roads get paid for by the state governments.  At the highest level, \nthe interstates, the feds pick up 90% of the construction costs leaving the \npaltry 10% to the states.  So this is why there are interstate highways in \nHawaii with their unique route prefixes so they aren't confused with \nmainland routes with the same numerals. +Phil Hopkins",

                    "text": "+Keenan Kelly Being born and having grown up in Montreal most of my life, I \ndo see where you're coming from... It kinda saddens me a bit to know the \nimage Quebec gets from the rest of Canada, even if I'm not \"qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\" \nmyself, as I'm of Latin-American parents. But really, only non-bilingual \nstubborn quebecers are going to be rude. If they don't speak english well \nenough (because trust me, most will understand it, in Montreal at least) \nand don't hold any resent or plain ignorance against anglophones, they'll \njust tell you they don't speak english or ignore you (which yeah, can seem \nquite impolite on the moment but, whatever right ?). You don't need to \nspeak french to live here, even if it does help. But yeah I won't hide the \nfact that Quebec laws on language are pretty stupid and not only does it \naffect anglophones but also everyone here. For instance, sometimes you'll \nlearn about some event or contest you want to attend/participate in, and \nyou'll see it's happening in Canada & USA, so you're like \"Ooh great !\" and \nthen you read more about it and you see it excludes Quebec... It only \nhappened to me once but it pissed me off big time because you know it's \nbecause of some stupid and in the end, racist law. It really annoys me.\n\nRecently I went to Kansas to visit some family and when I came back, I was \namazed to see that once you enter the province, almost every sign of \nanything is french only... WTF ?!  Sure french is part of Quebec but still, \nwe're in Canada, and what does that tell to american tourists ?  They \nshouldn't come here, thinking \"Ooh, they speak french there but it's still \nCanada, everything's also going to be in english\" and then actually come \nhere and don't understand a thing, at least in the signs you see on the \nroad or in some stores. I think either french should be a minor thing here, \nlike in Galicia (Spain) for example, where yes, they speak Galician, but \nSpanish still dominates in pretty much everything), or Canada should just \nteach french more nationwide, but that's not an easy task and lots of \npeople would most likely be against it. There's that too, the fact that the \nrest of Canada just ditches french because of Quebec. I love knowing french \nonly because it opens all doors to french (from the actual France) culture, \nwhich is awesome. I really don't like Quebec culture, but that's just me. \nHowever, when it comes to France culture, it's great. I'm not a fanatic of \nanything, it's not my favorite culture, but I love french cinema, I love \nknowing that I can just go to France and just kick it, and other canadians \nshould embrace the fact that they have the possibility of becoming \nbilingual, but it definitely shouldn't ever be imposed to anyone.\n\nJust know that these stupid laws and whatnot affect us more than anybody \nelse and that not everyone here is a stubborn Quebec/french fanatic (heck, \nMontreal's so diverse anyway that here, Quebecers are almost a minority).",

While agreeing that job opportunities are greater \nin America, 89 percent disagreed with the notion that they would rather be \nin the United States, and they were more likely to feel closer to English \nCanadians than to Americans.[76]*\n\nAre Quebecers not Canadians now?\n\n*Since the arrival of the Loyalists as refugees from the American \nRevolution in the 1780s, historians have identified a constant theme of \nCanadian fear of the United States and of \"Americanization\" or a cultural \ntakeover. In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by \nFrench militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and \nHeidler (2004), \"the fear of Americanization.\"[71] Scholars have traced \nthis attitude over time in Ontario and Quebec.[72]*\n\n*Looking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in English Canada \nthat fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the \nattractions of the U.S. are strongest.[74]*\n\n*The history has been traced in detail by a leading Canadian historian J.L. \nGranatstein in Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism (1997). \nCurrent studies report the phenomenon persists. Two scholars report, \n\"Anti-Americanism is alive and well in Canada today, strengthened by, among \nother things, disputes related to NAFTA, American involvement in the Middle \nEast, and the ever-increasing Americanization of Canadian culture.\"[77]*\n\n*However Kim Nossal points out that the Canadian variety is much milder \nthan anti-Americanism in some other countries.[81] By contrast Americans \nshow very little knowledge or interest one way or the other regarding \nCanadian affairs.[82] Canadian historian Frank Underhill, quoting Canadian \nplaywright Merrill Denison summed it up: \"Americans are benevolently \nignorant about Canada, whereas Canadians are malevolently informed about \nthe United States.\"[83]*\n\n\u2191 See, Torri x?  That's what being informed looks like.  Your 'common \nlogic\" and 'estimates' seem to be about 50 times away from the truth, and \nthat's being generous.\n\nTo reiterate:  *By contrast Americans show very little knowledge or \ninterest one way or the other regarding Canadian affairs*",

I'm not American or Canadian, so I don't particularly \ncare, and its obvious that the US military is larger and better equipped. \nBut you're fooling yourself if you think your military academies alone \ncould take Papua New Guinea, let alone Canada. Or did you forget what \nmilitary academies are actually for? \n\nFurthermore, offensives rarely go well for the attacking country unless \nthey have significant help, which is why WWII and the First Gulf War were \nsuccessful, and why the Yanks were mostly unsuccessful in Vietnam, and \nAfghanistan, and the second go-round in Iraq.\n\nAs for you contradicting yourself, you said in one post that the Canadians \nwould not put up a resistance (which is not true), and in another paragraph \nthat Canadians could not possibly defeat the US in a war (which, as far as \npure numbers go, is true, but war isn't always just about numbers). That's \nnot a direct contradiction, but it definitely seems like you're holding two \nopposing viewpoints. Unless you're saying that Canadians would believe they \nhave no chance of winning so they'd give up, in which case you're not \ncontradicting yourself, but you have a very poor understanding both of \nCanadian culture and of human nature as a whole. \n\nSure, most of Canada's population lives close to the American border. But \nit still gets pretty damn cold and rugged up there, and in order to annex \nCanada you'd likely have to take Ottawa, which is rather difficult to get \nto. The Americans could do it if they wanted to, but as I said, it would be \na tremendous and tremendously unnecessary drain on America's money and \nresources at a time when they're already in debt. \n\nAnd yes, you should be worried about the international community. Sure, you \nprobably could beat Canada, even in a war on Canadian soil, and sure, you \nprobably wouldn't have to face Russia because of MAD, but you'd have to go \nup against other countries in the UN, some of whom have even been your \nallies, including the EU, most of Latin America, India, Australia, China, \nand many others including my home country of Mexico. That's more or less \nwhat happened to Iraq in 1991, and it worked out horribly for Mr. Hussein, \nand Kuwait is 100X easier to take than Canada, so what makes you think it \nwould work any better for you?\n\nBut fine, let's say you annexed Canada, and no other country came to \nCanada's aid. Now you have to rebuild a nation that's completely in ruins, \nand I should remind you, the US is already in an iffy financial situations \nand invading Canada would cost them billions of dollars. The US is already \nincredibly influential in Canada, so all you're doing right now is flexing \nyour military dick. Yes, we get it, the US has a big army. So what?\n\nI know most Americans are good people, but people like you make Americans \nlook ignorant and violent. ",

Right now \nthe Conservative Party have the most MPs in parliament and there leader \n(and our current Prime Minister) is Stephen Harper.
