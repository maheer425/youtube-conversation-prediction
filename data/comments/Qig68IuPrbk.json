                "text": "I know Einstein's last words, I am the first to know, and now you all know. \n\"In essence, the conflict that exists today is no more than an old-style \nstruggle for power, once again presented to mankind in semireligious \ntrappings. The difference is that, this time, the development of atomic \npower has imbued the struggle with a ghostly character; for both parties \nknow and admit that, should the quarrel deteriorate into actual war, \nmankind is doomed. Despite this knowledge, statesmen in responsible \npositions on both sides continue to employ the well-known technique of \nseeking to intimidate and demoralize the opponent by marshaling superior \nmilitary strength. They do so even though such a policy entails the risk of \nwar and doom. Not one statesman in a position of responsibility has dared \nto pursue the only course that holds out any promise of peace, the course \nof supranational security, since for a statesman to follow such a course \nwould be tantamount to political suicide. Political passions, once they \nhave been fanned into flame, exact their victims...\"\ufeff",

However, if they are smart enough to build instruments that \nwould pick it up then I am sure they would be able to eventually interpret \nit as long as the signal came in clearly enough. And once they heard that \nfirst powerful recording the occurrence of other powerful radio waves would \nonly continue to become more and more prevalent meaning that they would \nhave more source material to decipher. Eventually they would probably hear \na lot of english and go with it as the best language to decipher. Of course \nthat is assuming that they would be able to continue picking up the radio \nwaves as their planet (or space ship) continues to move. ",

It's the perfect example of the human's selfesteem \nselfdestructive way of thinking, our whole life we pretend to strive to \nperfection and significance while purposely extending our goal by making \nthe world bigger and our accomplishes less significant. Once it's possible \nto go see the moon for yourself your cultural trip to India won't be \ninteresting anymore, In a way it's selfish and selfdestructive to aim so \nhigh for ourselves. It's one of the many reasons I insist we focus on our \nown little planet instead of continueing this romantic way of thinking that \nwill systematically keep our selfimage down. \ufeff",

I'm personally somewhat \nuncomfortable with how much we insist on going into the universe, mostly \ncause theres this mentality among a few of us to say \"if our own planet is \nlost, maybe some day we can go to the next\". But that beside the point.\n\nCuriosity I usually don't see as a bad thing, but we do live in a society \nwhere the expectations of ourselves and others having of us are so tight \nand almost ruthless and for the ignorant sake of it we still can't figure \nout why the amount of burnouts increase and this curiosity to the universe \nis a perfect example of how our need to push further (whether thats in \nfinding new things or becoming bigger as a person or as a society) displays \nthe likeminded impulse to ask more of ourselves.\nFrom the start of time we went to working only an hour a day and spending \nthe rest of our time having fun to the kind of life we have now and that to \nme makes things as crimes, drugabuse and various psychological issues no \nmystery, but again, thats beside the point.\nI know the two seem unrelated, but think about it, they say if technology \nstops advancing we'd \"stop evolving\" and with that logic die out, but I \ndon't think you can say that, what's wrong with sticking to digital screens \ninstead of striving for holografic touch screens.\nAt the end my point is, that is it to wonder why we expand? curiosity is \none thing, but im not convinced its just that, I maybe dare to say it is a \nform of denial, to counter something else, I just wouldn't know what.\n\nId love to hear your thoughts on this, and feel free to correct me, \ncritisize the theory, its the best way to expand my horizon (ha)",

I kind of get what you're saying, but I can't compleyely agree. \"by \nmaking the world bigger.\" That depends on what you think of as \"the world.\" \nThe universe as we know it is seemingly vastless, we did not simply make \nthat up. The point of aiming so highly is not to destruct our society, but \nit is because humans, as a species, have a natural-born curiosity. It's \nactually talked about in one of Vsauce's recent videos. Your point of \nthinking at this point may be something similar to, \"well, curiosity killed \nthat cat.\" However, you may be surprised to know that it's only half the \nquote you know. The other half is, \"curiosity killed the cat, but \nsatisfaction brought it back.\" By the way, if you found these last few \nsentences pointless, I do not blame you.

In other \nwords, the transitional species (the ones that are crossed to get from fish \nto monkey to human) could never survive or reproduce long enough to \ncomplete the transition to the next species.  While microevolution (changes \nwithin a species) is proven to exist, macroevolution is logically unsound \nand proven to be false.  Also, your argument that people could make the \ncar, the house, etc. is so flawed it shows that you don't even understand \nthe argument you attempted to refute.  The car is a metaphor for the earth \nand the fact that it contains the perfect conditions for life.  Claiming \nthat \"people could've made the car\" is either claiming that aliens made the \nearth (an argument with no basis and which doesn't solve the root problem) \nor admitting that God made the earth.  Finally, even if macroevolution were \npossible and had any supporting evidence, it doesn't explain how the first \nlife came to be.  There is absolutely no scientifically sound and \nreasonable explanation for the beginning of life except for intelligent \ndesign.  You mentioned that the Bible never claimed that God was ever born. \n This is so because God is infinite, or eternal.  He exists outside of \ntime, which itself didn't even exist until the universe began.  God has no \nbeginning because he existed before the very concept of beginnings began. \n All other arguments against the concept of God I saw you make were \nmisguided at best, and showed in you a severe stubbornness and an adamant \nrefusal to learn.  In fact, from what I saw, I think you didn't even read \nthe comments you attempted to refute.  Christianity is based largely in \nfact and reason, more so than anything else.  The debate is not between \nreligion and science, but between good science and bad science; between \nacceptance and stubbornness.",

There are many reasons \nfor being on this site, and let me tell you, it is not a preoccupation with \ndeath.  Rather its a preoccupation with LIFE and living to its fullest!  \n\n     Some people will have unfulfilled dreams they hope others will care \nabout. Others may wish to express love for their wives and children, for \nwhich this will be a lasting memorial.  And some may wish to tell the world \nwhat they were never able to say while they were alive!  \n\n     As we read the accounts of certain people, we wonder who they really \nwere, behind the mask.  Some people don't wish to wear masks, but others do \nso without knowing it, simply because they have secrets.  But what if we \nwere to create a website\nwhere we had no secrets, and nothing to hide?  What would that look like? \n What if people began to make confessions, to apologize, to repent of sins \nthey have committed?  How would that appear?   Would it cause even more \npeople to do the same?",
