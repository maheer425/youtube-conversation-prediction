New York is obviously ahead. I mean given the fact that \nUSA population is approximately 10 times of that of Canada, Toronto has \ndone pretty well. Chicago is on par. Seattle : Midtown Toronto is almost \nabout the same size of Downtown Seattle. Downtown Toronto is actually HUGE. \nWe have way more Office space as well living space in downtown Toronto than \ndowntown Seattle or Philly or whatever.
