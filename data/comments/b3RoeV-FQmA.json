There's certainly no need for a \nstock pot. Just onions, garlic, olive oil, salt, sugar, some kind of \nherb(depending one what kind of sauce you make) and maybe pepper. That's \nthe base. Then depending on what kind of sauce you're gonna make you can \nadd other things. For a really fresh pizza even garlic, basil, salt, sugar \nand pepper is enough to make a good sauce as long as you reduce it down.",
