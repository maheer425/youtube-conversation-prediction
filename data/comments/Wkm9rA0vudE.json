No color travels farther in the visible spectrum! He may seem calm \nand cool but behind it is hidden powerful wavelenghts! \n\nGreen! She may not seem like much but when it comes to variance no one has \nmore sway than she does on the RGB scale! The folcrum of the group, she \nkeeps it all together!\n\nYellow! Bright, creative and fuzzy! He always manages to brighten up a room \nand can easily shed some light on a situation. When you're around him you \ncan't help but feel warm!\n\nRed! He may be the lowest on the scale but within him burns a firey heat \nthat keeps the group going! Useful in more ways than you can count, the \nteam might not even be a team if it wasn't for his big hertz!\n\nMix them together and you get a nigh unbeatable team!\n\nBut not all is well in the spectrum! Blue and green have been together for \nas long as they can remember. Infact you could say they've been together \nforever! But Blue is haunted by a vision of his future self! PURE BLUE. \nAlso known as the WAVE LENGTH PRIMARY! He has returned from his long \ndistanced travels into the unknown the warn Blue that he and Green will \nNEVER BLEND!\n\nAs if on cue, A mysterious and beautiful color VIOLET joins the crew. With \nher incredible ability to mix and charming and royal demeanor she quickly \njoins the visibles! However she has a deep secret. She is not one, but two \ncolors! A sweet and caring Pink, and an ancient and all knowing Purple! \nLead by a spectral enigma only called THE INDIGO. She seeks to take Blue \naway from green despite being her best friend from different ends of the \nspectrum!\n\nMean while, lurking within the invisible light spectrum is a terrifying \nspectral beast who seeks to slowly destroy all! Its name? THE ULTRA \nVIOLET!!! Together with Radio waves, once greens parent who attempted the \nforbidden and tried to mix himself with the invisible light spectrum, they \nseek to penetrate the visible spectral and thus destroy all! \n\nWith their intrepid leader still trapped in the colorless void. Can green \npull together the other colors enough to stop The ultra violet? Will blue \never accept his destiny as pure blue? Will violet succeed in closing the \ngap between her and blue and thus doom him to becoming old, alone and \nbananas?\n\nSee you next time on, THE BRIGHTEST COLORS!!!\n\nIn short they are literally the color spectrum.\n\nBlue belongs with green but purple wants violet to be with blue or else it \nwouldn't exist. Yellow is red main man but he really wishes to get closer \nto green or violet because he is lonely and everyone thinks he's weak (when \ntraveling through space red is the first to become black and is considered \nthe faintest of the lights but it also represents life giving heat, making \nit equally as important thus why he is an inventor.) Green can mix with \nblue or red to make just about any color, making her incredibly versatile \nbut the fate of most things hinges on who she choses to mix with. The only \nthing she can't make is purple, pink, or violet which is on the other side \nof the spectrum, thus why she is directly opposed by her. Ultraviolet is \nincredible powerful and is considered a radiation which is harmful to most \nlife. \"Don't look, its visage is too great for mortal minds to bare\" - \nHorse 2013. pure blue is a blue that has traveled so far the other colors \nhave been stripped away, leaving only blue. The deepest portion of the \nocean where light can travel is blue because blue is the only thing that \ncan travel that far. The sky is blue because blue's wavelength is so strong \nit can refract all over the place and keep going. \n\nand thats just the science part. Then we've got teenage mutant ninja \nturtles. The power rangers, my little pony, dungeons and dragons the show, \nthunder cats. All of which share many rough \"aspects\" with this show. Its \nnot that hard. I won't say that things may not have been pulled off of \nhomestuck, but i'm also saying just because a bullet lands in the same spot \ndoesn't mean the person shooting the second gun was aiming for that. They \njust had similar targets.",

No \noffense but you do not strike me as a 'details' guy...Bravest Warriors does \nnot have many episodes, and Wankershim's existence was the focus of at \nleast 2 episodes.\n\nIf you see a connection between other two shows, tell me, I'm curious.

At the end of the day even insanity \nhas its commonalities and I feel this is just an example of it.\n\n1. omniscient horse: this one i'll give you. I have no idea why the decided \nto make a horse all knowing (even though we've already learned he actually \nisn't when in the see through zone.) it just seemed fucking hilarious at \nthe time and this show is all about that.\n\n2. Dude, everyone loves cats. Thats like saying one party ripped off \nanother because they both had chocolate cake.\n\n3. The universe isn't contained within a game construct as far as we know. \nWhat happens in the see through zone has no effect what so ever on the real \nworld. Its a small pocket dimension created to be a prison, something like \nsuperman's null realm. That and homestuck are on two completely different \nscales.\n\nI stopped reading homestuck a long time ago so I can't really say too much \nmore than that. Though I don't recall insane time lords (more a startrek \ntrope) and a plot that is based almost solely around a single ship \nhappening being a part of homestuck too much (its pretty clear that the \nfate of many worlds and maybe a universe revolves around who beth falls in \nlove with). So i'd say more likely one show is referencing the next, not so \nmuch ripping off. \n\nIf its just aspects we are talking about then in something that is as crazy \nas this, having aspects suspiciously close to something else is \nsurprisingly easy. (one punch man being a perfect example of that. A world \nwhere one super hero is too strong for his own good and being a super hero \nor a super villain is treated more like a career choice. The Incredibles \nanyone? Deathstroke maybe? Fucking superman?) Its really easy to look like \nsomething else, but what is important is how you deliver it, and bravest \nwarriors has a completely different delivery to homestuck even if they are \nsimilar.",
