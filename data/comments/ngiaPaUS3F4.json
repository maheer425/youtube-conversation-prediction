One man has vintage erotica \n(with models only looking younger , only to look as an object of fantasy \nwith no victim but the thought is punished), he is finished, another adopts \na child from a poor country, waits and raises the the child up, grooming \nher only to fuck the child, having started that relationship when the child \nwas most likely under age.

Blacks or any other ethnicity for \nthat matter are offended by everything. I'm American Indian and I don't \nbitch about the redskins or people calling my people drunks or whatever. \nHalf the shit that all these so called unfairly treated ethnicities bitch \nabout have to do with their great great grand parents, but these idiots \nwant to keep the shit going on because if they don't then they won't have \ntheir special treatment they all want so bad. All these groups make me want \nto vomit. Stop standing on the corpses of the people who these offenses \nactually affected and screaming \"Me too, oooh Me too!,' I've been offended \ntoo!\". Just shut the fuck up and and cowboy the fuck up. Stop being pussies \nand look past these ancient offenses and say \" You know what, this shit has \nnever happened to me so I really have nothing to complain about.\" One more \nthing... I say NIGGER and it's offensive, a black says NIGGER and it's a \npet name or a song lyric,or even a greeting,example: What's up my niggah! \nYou people make no sense. Whatever your probably offended by what I just \nsaid.\ufeff",

That said, not all \nattractive women are bad people but in this incident Maria Shriver may not \nhave had the warm personality towards Arnold people think she did. As such, \nhe went looking for companionship elsewhere and seems to have found it with \na woman who wasn't a beauty queen but was someone who treated him well and \nmade him feel good about himself. Oddly, the world seems to be all well & \nfine when a woman cheats on a man claiming he was abusive or that he paid \nno attention to her yet if a man says this people would *never* cut him the \nsame slack they give a woman in the same scenario. Strangely, the act of \nforgiveness apparently depends solely on what's between the legs of the \naccused. The young & inexperienced would have us all believe Arnold is the \nbad guy here. These little kiddies all say they would do **anything** for \nan attractive female, regardless how she treats you. I'm merely saying \nthere's a LOT to be said for treating people like they're special, and \nphysical looks have little to do with keeping your man or woman. I would \ntake a homely looking woman any day over a beauty queen but it all depends \non their attitude, demeanor and who they are overall. Looks may initially \ndraw you in but somewhere in the process those of us with real experience \ndon't allow that one thing to determine who we ultimately want to be with. \nEnd of story...",

I looked up the news report and he said \nhis attacker was *white*, so I don't know what point you were trying to \nmake. Give me the link if you made a mistake in your summary because the \nstory I'm getting isn't police brutality.\nI never said white people can't be victims of police brutality. They are \nless likely, though.\nYour last article you post, explains *exactly* what white privilege is. I \nsuggest you read the article over. \nhttp://bit.ly/1FfkiqI\nhttp://huff.to/1tsD47W\nhttp://bit.ly/1mmB6DK\nhttp://bit.ly/1c0IeqE\n\nWhy don't the white killers(cops) of innocent blacks go to prison, if \"race \ndoesn't matter\"?\nGive me some articles of black officers killing whites and the victim not \ngetting justice. I'll wait.\n\n1. http://bit.ly/1pVnrXR\nhttp://bit.ly/1c0I9mR\nhttp://bit.ly/1fM361T\n\n2. Are you saying you see an equal amount of blacks as well as whites? \nhttp://bit.ly/1FAd9Xi\nTurn to any channel on your TV. Set an alarm for 30 minutes and count how \nmany black people you see vs. how many white people you see. A few \"token\" \nblacks isn't diversity.\n\n3. What? Who said white women don't get called demeaning names? Did you not \nread the part where I said \"culture\"? Read my sentence over. Oh, and \"Since \nwhen do white women and black women swap clothes?\" lol What does that even \nmean? I don't know, maybe they're friends? lol\nNothing about my statement was racist, either.\n\n4. I never said \"reverse racism\" is true. T Hat was exactly my point. I \nsaid the fact that it is BECOMING a thing, mainly among white teens. \n\"Reverse racism\" is just \"racism\", The fact that it's called \"reverse \nracism\", just proves that white people who say it, are actually saying that \nthere are more racist white people in the world than any minority and they \ndon't even realize it, because they're saying \"racist white people\" is the \ndefault. They're saying racism towards whites is \"the other way around\".\nYou can't be comparing the use of the word \"whitey\" and \"nigger\"?? Really? \nYou can't compare the two because idk, maybe because \"nigger\" has a racist \nhistory with roots stemming from slavery?? Any rational person would know \nthat the comparison of the two is absolutely vacuous. Were black people \ncracking the whip upon white people's backs yelling \"whitey\"? Were blacks \nspitting on whites feet, yelling \"whitey\"? Was \"whitey\" the last word \nwhites heard while they were being hanged from trees? No, no, and no.(This \nalso applies to the word, \"cracker\")\nWhite power vs. Black power now, huh? Ok, do you realize who used to say \n\"White power\"? The KKK. Who used \"Black power\"? Blacks people had pride of \nwhat they were. Besides, when white people say \"White power\", from what \nI've seen, most of the time they're racist.\nActually i have heard of Marley Lion, but guess what happened to his \nkillers? \nhttp://bit.ly/1yDGOJ4\nWhat about Trayvon Martin's killer? Oh, yeah that's right. NOTHING. The \nreason Trayvon's case made the news was because his parents TOOK his case \nto the news because of the lack of justice. Why would Marley's case make \nnews when his killers got sent to prison in a heartbeat?\n\n5. Does the word \"culture\" just fly right over your head? Because this is \nthe second time I brought it up and you seem to have mentioned everything \nbesides the cultural side. Go back to my links on girls getting kicked out \nof school and getting fired from jobs because of their hair. Also, watch \n\"Good Hair\", by Chris Rock which explains a lot of black women getting \nrelaxers and weaves. This is all because of assimilation and after slavery, \nit was forced. That mentality has been since passed down to the next \ngeneration which is why it's seen as \"unacceptable\" for a black woman to \nwear her hair naturally. It's literally being forced upon children to get \nrelaxers to \"look pretty\" and \"look acceptable\" by their parents.\n\n6. Again, what? I never said blacks get into college less. Read number 6 \nover again.\n\n7. Good Lord man, can you not read? We do have a Hispanic History Month and \nan Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, by the way. My point was white \nhistory is literally taught everyday in schools across the country. Some \nNative American history is taught along with it as well. What history were \nyou taught about blacks in school? Slavery and the Civil Rights movement? \nNow, what were you taught about white history? Oh, inventors, scientists, \nartists, musical geniuses, presidents of our country, etc. To be honest, \nwhite history is the only history taught in schools, passed off as either \n\"US\" or \"World History\". You learn something new about them everyday in \nAmerican Schools, but every year for blacks, it's the same history over and \nover again. Only a blind man can deny this. Yes, this is privilege to have \nyour own history be the only real history that is taught.\n\n8. I'm sorry, but were we talking about the Middle Easterners or \nVietnamese? No. Sounds like you're trying to justify racism. People still \ntell blacks to \"go back to Africa\". You're also comparing someone telling a \nblack person to \"go back\" to Africa, to you being called a Viking? \nSeriously? No, spare ME. Lol I've never been to Africa in my life and it's \nnot my history. Telling someone to \"go back\" somewhere is the equivalent of \nthem telling you \"Hey, you don't belong here.\" Someone calling you a \n\"viking\" isn't giving you the same message.\n\n9. You see plenty of white what? Crackheads? Anyone can act suspicious? \nExcept I'm neither and still got followed. Here's an excerpt from my last \npost \" explain to me why when I was in a store, the only black person in \nthere, I just so happened to get followed around by a worker, asking me \n\"What do you want?\" \"Do you need help?\" Meanwhile, many white people came \nin and she didn't bat an eye. She treated me like shit when I got to the \ncounter too. Whites in front of me didn't get treated as I did\".There's a \nreason why it's called \"shopping while Black\".\nIt of course can happen with anyone of any race but I've only seen it \nhappen towards blacks, so yes, race does matter in this aspect.\n\n10. Skin bleaching is a huge epidemic, especially in India. Look at \nBollywood stars, the majority of them are really light when there are so \nmany dark people in India as well. Once again, look at the diversity \nproblem I brought up earlier in #2.\n\nThe racist clerk....\"One\"? This has happened many times before ro me and \npeople I know, by yes, difference clerks, That is privilege to not \nexperience this.\n\n\n+steve french What, are you offended by the word \"fuck\"?\nWhat was wrong with my comment?

You're racist and stupid!\n\n4. Your \"reverse racism\" is nothing more than urban bullshit. So, let's \nplay this game: If the Black Panthers yell \"Take it to whitey!\" nobody says \nshit. If a group of whites says \"Give that rapist n***er the chair!\" it's \nracist. from the Urban Dictionary: *\"Reverse racism is a classic example of \nhypocrisy. When a black-skinned person screams \"Black Power!\", he/she is \nstanding up for his rights. When a white-skinned person yells \"White \nPower!\", he/she is a racist...*\" So, you're full of shit. Ever heard of \nMarley Lion? No? Because his murder by a 30 year old black criminal with a \nrecord, never made the news. Marley was white, and 16. But, meanwhile on \nthe race baiting news, Trayvon was all over. White privilege, eh?\n\n5. Not true. Depends on your life. If you're poor, and white...forget it. \nIf you're any race and poor...forget it. Society does and has always \nfrowned upon the poor and homeless. Race has nothing to do with it. Give me \nsome sources instead of just statements. Where did you get the stats on \nthis? Don't tell me \"It's obvious! Look around\" because that's bullshit. \nSo, this is why a white president damn near gets impeached over a blowjob, \nbut the black president can start martial law and bring on WWIII and keeps \nhis position. I'm a white man, a Veteran, and have gotten zero \"privilege\" \nfor it.\n\n6. Blacks get into college less? Show me proof. Let me debunk that for you:\n\n\n*Black Student College Graduation Rates Remain Low, But Modest Progress \nBegins to Show*\n\n*Nationwide, the black student graduation rate remains at a dismally low 42 \npercent. But the rate has improved by three percentage points over the past \ntwo years. More encouraging is the fact that over the past seven years the \nblack student graduation rate has improved at almost all of the nation's \nhighest-ranked universities. On page 11 of this issue of JBHE we report the \nencouraging news that African-American enrollments at the vast majority of \nour nation's highest-ranked colleges and universities have shown \nsignificant improvement over the past quarter-century.*\nhttp://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html\n\nHas it also occurred to you that many just choose *not to go*? \n*Whites represent 75 percent of the students at the nation\u2019s top 468 \ncolleges overall, even though they account for only 62 percent of the \nnation\u2019s college-age population. Meanwhile, whites make up just 57 percent \nof the students at open-access schools.*\n\n*In addition, the report said, more than 111,000 African American and \nHispanic students annually graduate in the top half of their high school \nclass but do not earn either a two-year or four-year degree within eight \nyears. If those students had attended one of the top 468 colleges and \ngraduated at rates similar to those of other students there, 73 percent of \nthem would be college graduates.*\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/minorities-and-whites-follow-unequal-college-paths-report-says/2013/07/31/61c18f08-f9f3-11e2-8752-b41d7ed1f685_story.html\n\nIn laymen terms: They either not going or not graduating, dropping out. Can \nyou taste the red pill, yet?\n\n7. Blanket statement is blanket. So, tell me the day to day life of a poor, \nwhite man and poor, black man or Hispanic man. It won't be different, but \nhow they choose their time. How are you saying we get better treatment each \nday? How white victims never make the news? How whites saying anything \nnegative about black on black crime is \"racist\"? How Sharpton and Jackson \ndeal out the race cards daily when a black is in the news but ignore a \nwhite or Hispanic victim? Why isn't there a Hispanic history month? Native \nAmerican history month?\n\n8. Who says \"Go back to Africa\" anymore? I'm Norske, and have been called \n\"Yam\", \"Viking\", \"Weegie\", etc. Irish are called: \"Donkey\", \"Drunks\", \n\"Leprechauns\", etc. Middle Easterns are told to go back to the sand pit, \ncalled \"Camel fuckers\", \"Towel heads\" and during Vietnam, the names for the \nVietnamese were numerous. Oh, which brings up a point: How us Vets (white \nor black) are treated like shit after a war. Spare me, \"bish\".\n\n9. LOL, what? Another general, blanket statement. Followed in what store, \nin what areas, by who? Once again: where is your proof, stats and \ndemographics? I see plenty of white, crack heads from other cities come to \nthis town in the summer and get \"followed\" in stores...because any one can \nact suspicious!! My motorcycle was stolen two summers ago...done by whites. \nAll depends on the area, population rates, race demographics, etc. In \nlaymen terms: You're fucking stupid.\n\n10. LOL really?\n\nhttp://www.ranker.com/list/hottest-black-models/no-rupaulogies?var=2&utm_expid=16418821-95.1qjMvFhnTUe61_EDzZKP9g.1\n\nAnd lastly...the clerk was just a racist bitch. Don't put your one, racist \nclerk into some \"white privilege\" bullshit. I bet you probably have a \nbetter job than she did, hence why she's a racist cunt. \n\nAnd the next time you site \"sources\" here's a protip: Non biased and not \nleaning towards one political side. Just the facts, maam. Just the facts. \nNot factoids generated by liberal media.",

I posted it on the same day we \nwere having the conversation.\nFuck, so now I have to re-write all of this. Here it goes. \n\nWhite privilege is not a lie. I  don't know what makes you think that. It \nhas nothing to do with \"trying to look PC\" or \"being racist against whites\".\nExamples:\n1. Not getting pulled over by police for driving a nice car because you're \nWhite.\n2. White privilege is being able to turn on the TV or read a magazine and \nsee people who actually look like you.\n3. It's when black people wear something of their culture and it's called \n\"ghetto\" or \"trashy\", but when a white woman does it, she's \"trendy\" and \n\"cute\".\n4. The fact that \"reverse racism\" is becoming a thing.\n5. White people don't have to assimilate into American culture.\n6.  The fact that Whites can go to college or get a job and don't have to \nworry about others telling them that \"You only got in because you're black.\"\n7. Want a \"White History 'Month'\"? Well, good for you because that's \nliterally the whole year.\n8. Not having to be told \"Go back to Africa.\"\n9. Being able to walk into a store and not get followed.\n10. The fact that white is seen as the beauty standard around the world. \nRefer to reason #2.\n\n In my deleted post, I gave you a couple of links to explain it better to \nyou.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1kvAiAj\nhttp://bit.ly/1azOPYV\n\nIf white privilege doesn't exist, then how come there are stories of little \nblack girls getting kicked out of school for their hair TEXTURE? Why are \nthere black women getting fired because of this reason as well??\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1KJFv0U\nhttp://huff.to/1GXqvMw\nhttp://huff.to/1CIVgSx\n\nHmm, if it doesn't exist, then  explain to me why when I was in a store, \nthe only black person in there, I just so happened to get followed around \nby a worker, asking me \"What do you want?\" \"Do you need help?\" Meanwhile, \nmany white people came in and she didn't bat an eye. She treated me like \nshit when I got to the counter too. Whites in front of me didn't get \ntreated as I did, but oh, that's not privilege, amirite?\nExplain to me housing discrimination, hair discrimination, etc. that \ndoesn't effect whites?\nYou're the one who's allergic to the facts.\n\nIf all else fails, look at the recent police brutality victims.",

The case was thrown out \nof criminal court because of no evidence. These people were greedy and \nafter his money. Did you notice that both times these people filed lawsuits \nagainst him, it was right after he did a big interview? The first time it \nwas with Oprah, the second with that other guy. Notice how the people took \nmoney rather than speak out against him? When they accused him of child \nmolestation, it killed a part of him. People see money instead of a human. \nAnd today people are so paranoid, they are easily brainwashed by the media. \nThere is no doubt that he was weird and childlike, but I think that is \nbecause he had no childhood himself, and was stuck as a kid in his mind \nhimself. You people should do your own research with an open mind, instead \nof being so quick to listen to what those accusing assholes have to say. \nMaybe you'll notice that not everyone hates kids, and that there are adults \nwho would love to spend time with them with pure intentions.

She didn't \ndo it to ridicule, belittle, or otherwise make fun of the actress who \nportrays \"Crazy Eyes\" or any other black person. Let's compare that to the \nmovie \"White Chicks.\" The Wayans brothers dress up as blonde white women \nand portray them as dumb, arrogant, and belittled blonde white women in \ngeneral. How can you look at these two examples and not realise which one \nis truly racist?\n\nOne cannot label all black face or white face as racist. It should be taken \non a case by case basis.

Hey black \npeople, MANY white people know the facts and they're mind-blowing, black on \nwhite crime is literally 50x worse then \"white\" on black crime, THEN use \nper capita, Does not look good one bit for blacks. NOW, lets play fair, \nPLENTY of black people do not commit crime against whites, MORE then 50% of \nblacks are wonderful people and just fine.\n\nHave said it for 15 years out of my 29 years on this planet \"i have my best \ntimes with blacks, i have my worse times with blacks\"..... If you're black \nand you disagree with that, you're 100% lying...... Holidays, parties, \nrelationships, going out, etc.... it's true.  It's like a damn roller \ncoaster with blacks and like a straight flat roller coaster with \nwhites...... I really wish Non-americans knew or have a chance to \nunderstand this and agree. I do feel bad for so many blacks, lets face it, \nthe whole world TYPICALLY does take your bad apples and use that most \noften, same thing for whites in the US, but they take whites from 150 years \nago way more often...\n\nMoving on, POVERTY!!!!!!!!!!! Poverty only has so much to do with it, West \nvirginia is 95% caucasian they have the worst poverty per capita and the \nleast violence and gangs per capita, AND they have some of the least \nwelfare per capita..... We americans know what's going around the world, \nBlacks live in poverty 100x WORSE in africa and south america \"brazil\" and \nhave the same crime problem....... POVERTY does not make you go target \nsomebody with different skin color and commit a racist violent crime, HATE \nand pure racist blood makes you do that, Poverty makes you go rob a store \nto eat....\n\n123 blacks were killed by cops in 2012, 386 whites were killed by cops in \n2012, 127 cops were killed in 2012...... 40 million blacks in the US and \n123 ghetto thug blacks killed is the crisis? Then whats blacks killing 7000 \nblacks and 1600 caucasians each year? \"Whites\" kill 5800 whites each year \nand 90 blacks..... 12.6% black vs 79% \"white\"....... Just stop it, facts do \na whole lot better then \"were being hunted down by whites and cops\"..... \nThat's a racist fairy tale and worse, You keep on watching your tv, i'll \nkeep on checking the facts, have all cases, names and stories available, \nNOT just 1% of whats going on.... That's your fault, this is 2015  if \nyou're reading this, Then you have access to learn the facts...... No \nexcuse \n\nLook lets wrap it up, SLAVERY, SLAVERY SLAV, SLAVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...... \n350,000 black slaves were sold to the US in 375 years out of the total 31 \nmillion african slaves in that time period, that's 4% of all african \nslaves... At the height of US slavery \"1790\",  1.4% of \"whites\" had slaves, \nover 4% of free black had slaves in 1850, A black man was the first slave \nowner in the US awarded by the state and he gained lifetime rights to a \nanglo/white man.... Look it up Anthony negro johnson 1654...\n\nFor 150 years slavery in the US was 6 years and your papers and freedom \nunder the white man, AND often 5-50 acres of free land for your service, \nThe black man changed that all.... And Anthony negro johnson never had to \npay taxes again, neither his wife or kids either... CATCH THAT? A black man \nwho was a slave for 6 years, having slaves 10 years later, became the first \nman to OWN a slave and it was a white man, and never had to pay taxes \nagain? Tell me just one of those facts are wrong? Didn't think so. Please \ntell me why ALL white people are held liable for what 1.4% of \"whites\" did \n200 years ago when more blacks had slaves themselves per capita and black \nslave owners had white slaves? 270,000 white slaves were sold to the US in \n150 years, Google white cargo\n\nBlack people stole and sold blacks, What if i told you africans and \narabs/muslims have STOLE over 160 million african slaves in the last 1400 \nyears? YEA, it's true, Arabs have stole well over 50 million africans and \nonly 11 million survived, and they have killed 120 million africans in the \nlast 1400 years. I KNOW 50% of you will not believe me so here is the \nproof- Google Tears of Jihad political islam.... BREAKS DOWN 270 MILLION \nNON-MUSLIMS MURDERED BY MUSLIMS IN THE LAST 1400 YEARS...... Muslims/arabs \nhave done 100x worse to africans then whites have ever done, And africans \ndarn sure have done worse to africans as well. You can find far more info \nif you would like google \"270 million deaths\", You're welcome OVER 500,000 \nsources prove the point....\n\nCare to explain why all whites \"200 million caucasians in the US\" are held \nliable for blacks taking blacks and 350,000 sold to the US but muslims and \nafricans get away with 100's of millions? AND THEY HAD IT FAR WORSE BY \nAFRICANS AND ARABS. Heck brazil purchased nearly 5 million of those african \nslaves out of the 31 million when the US only purchased 350,000... Brazil \nand south america had YEAR LONG BREAKING CAMPS, 34% of all african slaves \nnever walked away from those camps.... I really do not think you guys \ncaught that, so google \"brazil year long breaking camps africans, the \ntransatlantic\" and read the real horror..... The US had no such camps or \nanything like that.....\n\nAnd i think you might want to study up on 6000 years of slavery, not 350 \nyears, ALL RACES HAVE BEEN FUCKED..... That makes you incompetent only to \nknow 5% about a topic and only talk about one 99% of the time...  Lastly \nhave not heard or read 1 black person in the US care about the 8 million \nafrican slaves right now in africa and brazil, or 35 million total slaves \naround the world..... And ALL reside in africa, Asia, mexico and south \namerica...... White people never stole you, your black daddies stole and \nsold you, the jews and arabs helped march your ancestors east and the \nportuguese sailed 350,000 blacks to the US in 370 years.....  THIS IS WHY I \nHAVE NO WHITE GUILT. Learned my history 5 years ago......\n\nAir it out, come clean, fix it..... Only way i know how things will ever \nget better...... Try to use facts if you want to counter any of this, \"you \nlying\" \"dats racist\" will make me laugh and that 100% means you have lost \nthe topic......",

There are others that I can \nnot remember but those are some of the big ones. The were all arrested \nbecause information has come up that they have raped and molested people, \nJimmy Savile being the first and worst of the accused.\n\nJimmy Savile has according to victims raped and molest people from the age \nof five to seventy five and even dead people. He also made jewellery out of \ndead people, using their glass eyes. It has been said that he did this for \nforty or fifty years from the age of thirty six until two years before he \ndied. He also got a victim pregnant and he told her to threaten suicide if \nshe was refused an abortion. He got away with this for so long because he \nthreatened victims saying that his friends in the army would kill them and \nhe bribed and blackmailed police when allegations did come to their \nattention. Also because he was famous he got access all areas to hospitals \nwhich is were (besides the BBC) most abuse went on. I mean all areas, he \ngot to visit the children's wards, the mental wards ever the hospital \nmorgues.\n\nAs Jimmy Savile is dead he gets away scot free with only a tarnished \nreputation.\n\n-Rolf Harris is to be sentenced on Friday (found guilty of twelve counts of \nindecent assault)\n\n-Max Clifford got eight years in prison for his crimes\n\n-Dave Lee Travis got off.\n\n-Freddie Starr got off because he had not got enough evidence against him \nso was not taken to court.\n\nAnd the most recent winner of Celebrity Big Brother (UK) Jim Davidson was \nnot taken to trail as they did not have enough evidence against him. He was \ndismissed very quickly as being part of it so I did not include him.",
