After listening to this, I \nbecame new MyGirl, and this song is amazing, so why hate on it? It's not \ntheir fault EXO's D.O isn't here. And still some other people are \ncomplaining that people are only coming because they all thought it was D.O \nfrom EXO. Don't complain, because they're actually helping to raise the \nviews, and that's beneficial because maybe more fans will be recruited, \nlike me. But there's just one more thing; as a new MyGirl, do you guys know \nwhat TV Shows I can watch to know them better? And who is that cutie at 1:15\n?\ufeff",
