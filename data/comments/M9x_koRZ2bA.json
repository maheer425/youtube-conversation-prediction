                    "text": "+Duo Dai\nSorry that you didn't get what you wanted to find out but tough shit - \nthat's the way Dark Souls is. None of us can ever know the true story. \nThat's simply how it was written.\n\nYou don't understand this - I get it. But if you think the way the story \nwas presented was wrong then go ahead - try to find another video trying to \nexplain it. The game itself doesn't give context to any of these actions. \nThe lore itself is so filled with gaps that even the jokes in the video may \nvery well be true because the lore doesn't contradict anything said in this \nvideo. That's the genius of the cartoon. The game doesn't even tell you \nthis lore in a remotely linear way. You need to piece meal it together and \neven then most people don't get as complete a picture as to what happens in \ndark souls as what you get in this video.\n\nHere is the story.\n\n- Immortal stone dragons ruled the world since time immemorial and wanted \nto keep it craggy and ashy which suited them best. The exception to this \nwas Seath, the scaleless... who was not immortal but was desperately trying \nto figure out how and why - soon realizing it was the scales themselves. He \nneeded to research this... but the only way to do it was to kill his own \nkind....\n\n- Four Lord Souls were discovered by Gwyn, Nito, Izalith, and the Furtive \nPygmy... and with the help of Seath the Betrayer they put an end to the \nDragon's domination of the world and started the age of fire - an age of \nnew gods who's powers kept the world in line thanks to the burning of \nsomething called the first flame. Gwyn, the new god king, named Seath a \nduke and presented him piece of a Lord Soul in honor.\n\n- Keep in mind that these are not the only gods. Their children were all \ndieties (including an unnamed wargod, gwyndolyn, gwynevere, quelaag, \nquelaana, and quelaan (notice the patern)  as well as several others of \nunknown origin like Velka, Fina, and Flann,\n\n- The age of fire was found to be temporary since the first flame was \nliterally going out so Izalith attempted to recreate the first flame with \nher own lord soul but instead became a chaotic demon hellspawning.... \nthing. The city of Izalith in ruin becoming an ever spawning pool of demons.\n\n- Seath continued his obsession with his research as well as \n[implied]sexing up humans/ giants, leading to many mutated women folk, a \ncult-like group of followers, and possibly fathering the demi-god \ncrossbreed priscilla, who was banished for her unique ability to hunt other \ngods.\n\n- Realizing that their powers were only temporary there were grumblings in \nthe god's sanctuary and they soon abandoned it. They tried to found a new \ncity with lords and humans, the humans getting a pieces of the Lord Soul \nbut the city fell to ruin as the citizens were tempted by the abyss. It was \ndecided to have everyone present killed by flood to prevent what happened \nin the past - as the abyss has welled up in these lands before in a town \ncalled Oolacile.\n\n- Gwyn, in an attempt to keep his powers along with the other gods a while \nlonger, cast himself into the first flame using himself as kindling, for \nonly the most powerful souls can keep it lit.\n\n- With the abyss ever creeping up on Lordran, the land of the gods, demons \nescaping from the lost city of Izalith, the fading powers of the gods, and \nnow a new plague, the curse of the undying spreading across world various \nknights of various kingdoms around the world scrambled to solve the problem \nas the gods abandoned mortal concerns. The cursed undead too seem to be \ndrawn to this place, though everyone but the player seems to know why.\n\n- Gwyndolyn, Kaathe, and Frampt begin corralling whatever undead are \nwilling to take up their trials to whatever ends, eventually leading them \nto the first flame. People argue which ending is canon - Linking the flames \nand keeping the age of fire going a little longer or becoming the Dark \nLord, ending the age of the gods, the age of fire and ushering in the age \nof man, the age of dark..... but according to Dark Souls 2 this their both \ncanon as both seemed to have happened repeatedly over time (I won't spoil \nany lore for DS2  here other than this).\n\nAt least this is what the fans understand the story to be years after the \nrelease.\n\nThe reality is that most of the story is told like this.\n\nSomeone did something. We don't know how or why.\nSomething else happened. We don't know when how or why.\nSomeone else did something. We don't know when how or why.\nCurses. Abyss. Flames. THINGS.\nNames of people and places. No context.\nYou were chosen to do something. You don't know when where what or why.\nYou beat the game. You don't know what you did or why.\n\nDark Souls 2 doesn't really answer any questions left in Dark Souls... and \nas of right now it's so new that the community doesn't have a grasp of the \nstory yet. Yes, those of us who've beat DS 1 and 2 at this point have \nabsolutely no idea what the story of DS2, what you accomplish, and why.",

Then one day a dragon is born that is not immortal, so he becomes a \nbitch and tries to ruin the fun for all the other dragons.

The first one goes to this asshole \nking, the second goes to the bitch witch, the third goes to this stunky ass \ndude made of skeletons, and the fourth goes to the \"unknown fucker\" a.k.a \nyour ancestor. The name of the game is the same as the name of the fourth \nsoul a.k.a the \"dark soul\". The mortal dragon being the bitch he is goes to \nthe owners of the first three souls and tells them how to kill those dicks \nthat keep killing them. The soul owners go all out on those d-bag dragons. \nThe dragons go \"fuck this shit\". After some time shit hits the fan the \nfirst fire starts to go out. Alarmed by this the bitch witch with all her \ninfinite stupidity tries to save it by trying to make the fire grow with \nthe help of her daughters. As if things were not shitty to start with \ndemons start coming out because of the god awful job them bitch witches \ndid. Demons start going crazy killing everything. Now this just fucking \nrumors but i heard that them cock eyed demons go after the \"dead\" because \nthey do not want the darkness that the fourth soul brings to rule the \nworld, so yeah there you come in. The mother fucking descendant of the \nfourth soul asked to either keep the first fire burning, or say fuck you \nand go with your ancestor and bring forth the darkness.      \n\nAlso if your one of those tin foil wearing nut jobs, You could say that the \nthe four souls that come down represent \"knowledge\".\n\nOr so they say........",

How \nthere is no plot is beyond me, unless you know nothing of plot and how it \nshould work. If you mean there is no outright plot that a narrator tells \nyou with an ominous voice then ok but who gives a shit, that kind of story \ntelling is boring and irrelevant to how you structure your argument by just \nsaying there is no plot.\n\nAlso since when have games told you out right in narrative format it's \nstory, unless your playing cod or something. Story is content to understand \nthe fundamentals of an idea of a past, present and future world that \ndoesn't or does exist. What part of this game doesn't do that? Once again \nthis game has a plot it needs to be found out, researched like looking at \nhistory through an objective view. TO understand your place in the game the \nlore becomes not only just myths, but fact(in the game) that's why you go \nto lordran the land of the gods, you become apart of history which is why \nthe lore is needed to progress the story, for without the lore the game \ncan't continue plot wise its past is the plots past and where you come in \ncontinues the plots conflict, what part of that don't you understand. To \nexplain that all again where and how plot functions in this game would be \nretarded, at this point I just think people like you hold on to what your \nsaying to seem stead fast in what you think.",

When they went to the First Flame there were \nalready demons there (which may explain why you see the passive phantoms of \nmarching Knights as you enter the Kiln) so Gwyn split his forces. Half went \nwith him, and half fought off the demons, but all of them were consumed \nwhen he lit the flame, no matter where they were.\n\nAlso, maybe the chaos demons caused the flame to malfunction somehow, \nincinerating everyone nearby. After all, when the Chosen Undead lights it, \nit doesn't seem to have any negative effects. ",

DO NOT rush at enemies, because you WILL die if you do. \n2) Analyze your enemies attacks. Take your time with them. Learn them. \nIt'll make killing them ALOT easier. 3) Get a friend. Trust me, you'll need \none. 3) Do NOT underestimate any enemy. As small and fragile as it may \nseem, if you are careless, it can and will kill you. (Anything, and I'm not \nexaggerating here, ANYTHING can kill you.) 5) Never let yourself get \noverwhelmed. Don't fight more than 1 enemy at a time. If you see more than \n2 enemies rushing at you, RUN, because they will kill you in a matter of \nseconds. And here comes the most important; 6) BE PATIENT. You will die. \nALOT. And I mean, ALOT. Don't get mad. Use death as your teacher. If you \ndie, analyze why you died. Maybe you dodged instead of blocked, or vice \nversa. Learn from your mistakes. Oh and time your attacks very carefully. \nDon't just attack like crazy. Wait for an opening. And one more 7) Never \nlet your stamina drain. You're defenseless without it.\nPRAISE THE SUN! ",

Hence why she seems human, has scales, and has a \nfluffy tail. If she was conceived in a traditional way, then one of her \nparents would of had to of been fluffy-- at least somewhat.

So from your view both endings happend and yet you have to \nstart new again and no ending happend.(I guess it start to sound confusing \nright now :P)\nIn DS2 on the other hand exists just one ending, because we know about the \ncycle and know that no matter what we do it will still repeat itself(Or how \nthe game handles it: NG+ to NG+unlimited).\n\nThere is by the way an interesting theory about King Vendrick, wich says \nthat he is a choosen undead himself. But instead of fulfilling his duty and \nlinking the fire he instead tries to do nothing in hope to break the cycle.",

Not only because of the white colour, \nbut also because of the creatures present in the Painted World, and things \npresent in Seath's archive. First thing, the Fair Lady is a firekeeper, in \nSeath's archives you find a firekeeper soul and the maiden set. The dingy \nset found on the firelink firekeeper is actually a worn maiden set. Yet \nanother firekeeper in Seath's archives. So we can assume Seath likes \nexperimenting with firekeepers.\n\nIn the painted world, we find hollows infected with infections similar to \nthat of the egg carriers, we also find an egg vermifuge. The hollows in the \npainted world all use pyromancy, which the daughters or chaos specialise \nin. It is also worth noting that the NPC who invades you in the painted \nworld - Jeramiah, uses chaos pyromacy. A Type of Pyromancy originating ONLY \nat the Witch of Izaleth, and her 7 daughters. Which means Jeramiah must \nhave learnt it from them. You can also find Jeramiah's corpse in Pricilla's \narena after you defeat him, which shows he had direct contact with \nPricilla. Perhaps he was sent there to protect her by The Fair Lady, \nPricilla's theoretical mother. \n\nAs for her having access to the painting, I don't think she voluntairily \nentered. Everything put in the painting was put there because it was feared \nby the gods. The god's feared pricilla's ability to weild that power of \nlifehunt. I also belive your access to the painted world was permitted by \nVelka (the crow dropped the doll in your cell), since the crow is the one \nwho transports you to and from the northern undead asylum. Velka permitted \nyour entry in an attempt to open the painting and let her minions free.\n\nI never realised that Havel was actually trapped in that tower, thansk for \ndrawing my attention to that. I too agree that Seath is responsible for \ntrapping him there.\n\nI don't know which theory to support. I feel like there is substantial \nevidence for both.",

The statue we see in The painted world \nis clearly Velka because of the crow child with her and the crow sitting on \nher head is an indication of that. We see statues of that same woman \nholding all kinds of other babies, too. It is very possible that Velka was \nthe one who gave birth to Gwyn and then they got it on.

I'm under the impression that Gwyndolin \nlet Seath experiment on him in some kind of transgender ritual, you can see \nthat Gwyndolin HAS BREASTS, so you know, there's that. Otherwise, if \nGwyndolin didn't like the way he  looked, he could have made Seath change \nhis snakes to be normal legs. He resembles Seath in this way that they are \nboth frail and unwanted children who have tentacles for legs.\n\nIt could be velka, yes, because of the evidence that she would have wanted \nthem dead, but perhaps Velka became an adoptive mother to priscilla.",
