                "text": "Solar only appeals to people who has never actually researched the issue. \nNo matter how efficient you make your solar panels you are never going to \nget anything greater than 120 watts/m^2. Plus that energy is only available \nat a very specific portion of the day and it is never during peak hours. \nThere is no way to store the energy. It diminishes the further you need to \ntransport it. Plus you need energy to manufacture, transport, maintain and \ndispose of solar panels. They require a lot of metals, which include toxic \nrare earth elements, and require a lot of mining. There is a place for \nsolar but it cannot provide the energy needed to sustain a global \ncivilization. \n\nNuclear has a bad reputation, again because people don't do their research. \nNobody died as a result of Three Mile Island. Nobody died as a result of \nFukushima. The only nuclear accident where there were any actual recorded \nfatalities was Chernobyl. That reactor was a GEN1 reactor type, a type \nfound nowhere outside the former Soviet Union. Its core had no containment \nvessel, plus the Soviets staffed the plant with coal miners. The chances of \nreproducing the events which lead to the Chernobyl accident are nil.\n\nThere is such a thing called \"energy density\", that is how much energy you \nget out of the land and resources you devote to it. As was stated above 120 \nwatts/m^2 at 44% efficiency is not enough to maintain civilization. But \nnuclear gives you megawatts of energy for the amount of land that is \nsmaller than the average football stadium. The waste produced is so small \nthat the amount any one person would produce in their lifetime would fit in \na soda can. Unlike nuclear waste, which diminishes over time, the e-waste \nfrom solar panels last forever. When you calculate the lifecycle cost when \nyou factor in the cost of construction and disposal of the waste, the net \nbenefit comes out to be outrageously positive. Unlike solar, when you \nfactor in energy density and lifecycle cost, is a net loss.\ufeff",

The process that takes place in the reaction works as follows: \na neutron hits a uranium nucleus and two things can happen.\n1: The uranium nucleus splits (unevenly) and form two new smaller atomic \nnucleus that roughly correspond to half the size of a uranium atom. In \naddition, two free neutrons are released, and this is what causes the chain \nreaction.\n2: Very rarely, the uranium instead of splitting, absorbs the neutron. This \ntransforms the uranium into plutonium. This plutonium can then also both be \nsplit or absorb neutrons; creating ever more highly radioactive elements, \nthese are the ones called transuranics and are the dangerous ones that make \nyou want to bury it for 100.000 years.\n\nWhen the nucleus is split the resulting elements have very different \nbehavior. One of the most common ones is Xenon. Xenon can not be split like \nuranium but it has a huge appetite for absorbing neutrons and acts as a \nmassive neutron sponge in the fuel, so as the uranium in the fuel is split, \nthe amount of Xenon increases and the ability of the fuel to chain react \ndiminishes.\nAnd, since Xenon is a gas with much higher volume then solid uranium - it \nwill create small gas pockets inside the fuel cylinder, eventually making \nit brittle and hollow.\n\nWhen the fuel is too damaged from the Xenon they remove it from the reactor \nand relabel it as waste.\nAt that point only about 5% of the Uranium in the fuel has been split or \nturned into plutonium.\n\n---\n\nIn a Thorium reactor 100% the Thorium is turned into uranium and that in \nturn is totally consumed.\n93% of the material being the smaller end products and the remaining 7% the \nstuff you want to store for 300 years. But as it is spawned in a Liquid \nFluoride Salt it is fairly 'easy' to separate them chemically. So you do \nnot need to store them all in the same container, you can separate them \nbased on the half life time or the radiation type. A huge contrast compared \nto the waste we have today, which is a lump of unspent fuel, radioactive \ntransuranics and other end products with various behavior.\n\nOne medium sized mine can produce enough Thorium to power the entire world.",

Operating for about \n60 years a reactor will only produce enough waste to Fill maybe small \nconvenient store.\n\nI am not sure where you got your figures. They actually don't make much \nsense to me because if you mean well only use 5% of the fuel and throw rest \naway I'm sure that's not correct, if you mean that we use only 5% of the \nmaterial and the rest is waste that make sense, but even Thorium reactor \nproduces waste, they just use a higher percentage of the material. The \nwaste produced by Thorium is shorter lived, on the order of decades , but \nis much more dangerous since it's more energetic. Much of the long lived \nwaste is alpha emitters, which are actually not dangerous outside your \nbody(They can not even penetrate pass the skin). The problem is if they get \nin your food supply and water supply and you ingest them than you start \nhaving problems. Also the Thorium reacts waste is really bad because more \nit like CsF is a salt and will easily dissolve into water and has a half \nlife of about 300 years(but with technology like turning it to glass will \nhelp).\n\nI like LFTR technolgy, but every technology is going to have it's pros and \ncons.",

                    "text": "+RaySquirrel So you are wrong on about every point about Solar.\n1. Peak energy hour use and Solar output almost line up perfectly in most \nplaces. Solar peaks between 10 and 4 and Peak energy hours is about 10 to 8 \npm(depending on time and location) .\n2. We can and do store solar energy. For small panel system you can use \nbatteries, sure this isn't most efficient but with recent breakthroughs \nwith graphane storage won't be an issue in 10 years. Further for system \nlike solar 2 energy is stored in molten salt, and can be stored for up 40 \nhours.\n3. I'm not sure where you 120 w/m^2, but this is incorrect. The Sun \nintensity is about 1300~1400 W/m^2 on the surface. But really this number \ndoesn't really mean much. If you take a commercial solar power plant vs a \ncommercial Nuclear plant the solar plant produces about 1/5 of the power as \nNuclear. The difference is we can put panels on every house.\n4. The only real toxic used in production of PV's is Cadmium. Which it \nproduces a 1/10 of what coal does, and most of that is only because we use \ncoal power sources to make it.\n\nAs for the safety record for nuclear you mostly correct. But as long as we \nhigh pressure systems the chance for problems, we should really move over \nto LFTR's. And still don't have a good solution for the waste. Sure a plant \ndoesn't produce a lot of waste, but the long lived waste will be around for \n1000's of years.\n\nOn your last paragraph you basically wrong again. Solar plants produce \nabout 400 MW of power, compared to Daya Bay nuclear power plant which is \nabout 2 GW of power. This is less than factor of 10, for individual panels \nfor houses you don't need this kind of power. The average home in America \nonly uses about 13 KW, so even with 120 W/m^2 only about 20 m^2 is needed. \nBut actually what the power output is (solar intensity* efficiency )1300 \nW/m^2 *44 %= 572 W/m^2. Maybe it's about half because of night. So on \naverage about ~250 W/m^(2). So only really about 5 m^2 of  panneling you \nwould need for most American homes.\n\nFurther trying to compare nuclear waste to solar panel waste is \ndisingenuous. Nuclear waste can make places uninhabitable for 1000's of \nyears or more, can kill you in an instant, and except for LFTR can not be \nreused. Solar panels unless they get into your food supply pose no treat to \nyour health, and if you need get rid of a panel, you can recycle almost \nevery pieces of it.\n\nLastly you like most people on this issue no matter what side they fall on, \nare actually missing the big picture. We need to stop using fossil fuels as \nthey pose an immediate threat to us. Every energy sources has it's own pros \nand cons. The best solution is a combination of Renewables and Nuclear that \nminimize their cons while maximizing their strength. We can replace coal \nplants right now with LFTR which are safer than current nuclear, and both a \nless harmful. At the same using wind and solar to lessen the load on these \nplants, thus creating even less waste over all. While at the same time we \nneed to work on fusion technologies like they are doing at NIL and ITER to \nreplace nuclear. Further increasing the energy efficiency of the grid will \nallow a sustainable future.",

Nuclear is just behind wind in fewest deaths per \nKwh. people get this fear of nuclear power instilled in them because of the \nmedias representation of it.",

                "text": "It seems that when it come energy sources most people have very polarized \nview point, and are misinformed on the other \"side's\" viewpoint. There \nisn't a single magic bullet that's going to fix out energy needs, and a \ncombination of nuclear and renewables will be needed. Here the facts. Coal \nis by far more harmful than Nuclear and not just because of greenhouse \ngases. CO2 is a problem, but so is the Ozone, Mercury, Ash, and trace \nradioactivity. The difference between nuclear reactors and coal reactors is \nnuclear reactors are regulated by not only the EPA but the NRC and Homeland \nsecurity. Commercial nuclear reactors do Produce more power than solar \nplants, but also solar panels can be added to almost every house, and wind \nfarms can supplement this power. This will reduce the total waste that \nreactors produce over all.Also most of the problems of renewables will be \nsolved over the next 10 years.Graphane  batteries will make cheap efficient \nstorage, while better PV will produce more energy yield. Thus reducing \nwaste production even farther. Further LSTR basically will be able to \nrecycle most  waste, and eliminate the main dangerous in current reactors, \nmeltdown and explosions(both of which hardly every happen any ways). While  \neliminating most the Long lived waste, though we will have more of the \nshort lived waste, which becomes inert faster but is more dangerous while \nnot inert. Lastly will need to eventually mover away from fission all \ntogether and move toward fusion over the next century. Basically anybody \nwho claims one system is better than other has very little knowledge in the \nsubject, to face our current energy needs we need multiple sources and a \nplan to make these sources safer and more efficient over all.\ufeff",

Actually the Radiation standards for Reactors set by the \nNRC actually are not based on how much radiation safety a human can \nactually take, but a set far below this level because of political reasons. \nSo a Nuclear worker is allowed a dose of 5 rem per year, this actually a \npretty low number itself. Astronauts  get about 25 rem a year. Originally \nthe amount of radiation allowed to public was about 1 rem per year from \nreactors and other non background sources. Well when this was found out, it \nwas cast to public as Nuclear reactors are allowed to exposes us to \nradiation. The initial response was this should be set to 0 rem per year. \nThe problem though was if we set it to 0 than basically almost everything \nwe use in our daily lives would be to radioactive. Microwaves, MRIs, TV, \nect all contribute to this number. So they choose to lower it to .1 rem and \ncalled it day. But these numbers low numbers are not actually based on any \nsafe studies, in fact natural background in your body gives you about .3 \nrem for year.",

Although 2 \nyears older, she was a classmate because she had to repeat a year while I \nhad skipped a year.\nIronically, she graduated from high school while I did not.\nIndeed, an idiot who didn\u2019t know that Vietnam was a country got a high \nschool diploma whereas I have none.\n\nAnd yet, if she said that gravity is the weakest nuclear force, she\u2019d be \ncorrect, regardless of her education.\n\nFacts stand on their own, and I gave you one of the definitions of an \n\u201caside\u201d as a noun.  I chose that definition because it matched what you \nquoted\u2014the other 2 aren\u2019t what you were trying to say.\n\nNone of them would be a match anyway.  What actually happened\u2014and why it \nwas more important for you to counter my point on the definition of \u201caside\u201d \nthan how conservatives are degenerating our educational system (which one \nwould think would be a more important issue)\u2014is that you couldn\u2019t stand to \nbe wrong on a subject so personal to you that you are proud of the time in \nAP English you spent studying it.\n\nI have been wrong many times in the past, even when offering advice.  But \npeople don\u2019t lose respect for others just for being wrong.  They lose \nrespect based on how people react to/handle being wrong.\nIn fact, sometimes admitting to being wrong as I did can actually *gain* \nyou respect.\n\nDon\u2019t let your ego stand in the way of you just admitting to being wrong.\nIf you show me I am wrong, I will admit it.

You claim to know everything and \nclaimed that I knew nothing yet provided no sources for anything you \nclaimed.\nI actually gave citations for every counter-point I made, and it turns out \nyou are the one who doesn\u2019t know about what he or she is talking (your \nmother also never taught you not to use prepositions at the ends of \nphrases).\n\n* Creationists are pushing for creationism to be taught in school but you \nconceded that point.\n* I concede that not all religious people are creationists, but I never \nsuggested otherwise.\n* You don\u2019t know what conservatives are actually doing to our \neducation\u2014completely erasing factual history and replacing it with their \nown propaganda.  Texas supplies a large part of the nation with school text \nbooks, so don\u2019t pretend it is just a problem in Texas.\n* You didn\u2019t know that the founding fathers were largely (not entirely) \ndeist or heavily influenced by deism, or you don\u2019t know what deism means.\n* You didn\u2019t even know what it means to make an aside, and you wanted to \nsound intelligent by trying to define it for me, as if I didn\u2019t know better \nthan you.  You don\u2019t even speak proper English, whereas I know 3.4 verbal \nlanguages, 1.5 sign languages, and 7 programming languages (not including \nthe 3 programming languages I have invented).\n\nOnce again, thank you.",

Conservatives push for school options, allowing students \nto get a more adapted educational experience, while liberals push for \nteacher unions, old teachers who don't do their jobs properly job security. \nNot all religious people are creationists, and it was not that long ago \nthat atheists believed in spontaneous generation, which is what sparked the \ncreationist belief, in the first place. You cannot blame creationism, as \nwrong as it is, for all of your personal grievances with the public \nschools. You may love that Australia is Republican free, but if it weren't \nfor Republicans, slavery, the Vietnam War, the Cold War with Russia, etc., \nwould not have ended when they did. It's also worth noting that America, \nwhich was FOUNDED by religious people (so I don't know what the fuck you \nare saying when you imply religious people \"did\" something to America), was \none of the first western nations to have separation of church and state, \nwhich I am sure you love, right? Much like the big bang theory, it was a \nconcept adopted by the RELIGIOUS community! Now, I am a very tolerant and \nrespectful person, but I cannot stand it when belligerent atheists like you \ntake it upon yourselves to make an aside (that means to speak to an \naudience) on something you obviously know nothing about, simply because it \nsuits your personal politics. Thank you for further polarizing the \nreligious and atheist communities and making all atheists out to be \ncomplete ignorant twats!

Some of these people are land owners, who \nwere merely fortunate enough to own land that happened to have large \namounts of fossil fuels. Some of these people are business types, who make \nmoney doing the simple task of selling this fuel. Some of these people who \nare wealthy, are the children of these useless people, who, due to the good \nold boy system which is rampant in the fossil fuel industry, get their \nlucrative professions due to nepotism. So outside of getting a cheaper, \ncleaner, and a limitless supply of fuel, once the greater efficiency of \nthese greener sources of energy becomes more accessible to the public, the \nother positive is that these aforementioned useless people, who are not \nwealthy because of their talent, but because of circumstances born of the \nfossil fuel industry, will now finally be on the losing side of the \neconomic ladder - where they belong. \ufeff",
