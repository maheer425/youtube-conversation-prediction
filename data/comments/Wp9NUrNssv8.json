And \nto whoever thinks we should find charitable causes closer to home, realize \nthis.... there are programs in the U.S. that are offered to the people who \nwould otherwise starve, were they in one of these 3rd world countries.  I'm \nalways hearing about how we need to \"donate\" to the starving children here \nin America, but I KNOW that if a child is going to bed hungry in America it \nis because they are on the street where no one CAN help them OR their \nparents are at fault.  There is not ONE child in this country (if their \nparents don't have income enough to feed them) that the food stamp (SNAP \nnow) program is not available to.  Most Christians aren't trying to \"clean \nup their conscience\" because they don't HAVE to (already done at the \ncross), but are REALLY doing what they have been called to do.... \"But \nwhoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his \nheart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? Little children, \nlet us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.\"  1John \n3:17-18. - See more at: \nhttp://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Caring-For-Others#sthash.qqOvDZbU.dpuf",

You might want to read all \nthe released public documents by the CIA, dating back decades; America \ncaused a large portion of destabilization, globally. It has overthrown \nleaders, supported dictators & wars, etc. all to please defence \ncontractors, banks, corporations, etc. as well as rule by hegemony.\n\nSecondly, your perception is limited by your lack of research; it's a \ndelusion... it's like saying USA is great for giving 150 billion in aid to \nthird world nations, but not understanding they take about 2 TRILLION \ndollars from those places in unfair practices & tariffs.\n\nSince when do you think a capitalistic nation, who won't even give it's own \npeople the services they need, will just do stuff out of \"kindness\". No, \nit's about MONEY. Just like banks steal billions of dollars, then pay a 300 \nmillion dollar fine, USA isn't losing anything by aiding. They take a ton \nmore than they'd ever give.\n\nNext, the \"free market\" is an illusion. It's rigged to help the same people \nget all advantages & taxpayer money (through subsidies), etc, which \ncondenses control on the nation. There is no competition & fairness; it's a \ncycle of corruption that thrives on you believing you can ever compete. I \nmean, why do you think even your minimum wage is still so laughably low for \na nation that produced so much?\n\nCorporations buy politicians, legally, in USA. They can do whatever they \nwant & have the great citizens to give them unlimited money to spread that \ncorruption globally. We fought to keep Monsanto out of Europe, but here \ncomes USA with the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), trying to give \ncorporations more power than nations, so they don't have to even listen to \nour government or people.\n\nUSA isn't a capitalistic \"free market\"; it's a testing ground for corporate \ncorruption, passive control over citizens, & legalized theft.",

If I tell you Batman exists & show \nyou the comic as proof, you'd think I was insane. So, stop trying to \ncounter rational thoughts with irrational questions.\n\nAlso, you focused on a silly & fleeting example (explaining a rainbow? wtf) \nI used to illustrate that anything - stupid, imaginary, trivial, etc. - can \nbe the basis of a person's character. Humans ALREADY want to be the person \nthey become, religious or not, & they will choose to be good or bad.\n\nAgain, it all boils down to mental acuity, & cognitive dissonance. E.g. \n\"Person A\" may like \"Person B\" because she (person B) is kind, but \"Person \nC\" will hate \"Person B\" because she (Person C) hates kind people. The \ndifference in us is choice, & that comes from where you frame your mind; \nthere IS a right & wrong way.\n\nYour brain is similar to a muscle that atrophies if you don't use it, but \nif you use it in a certain manner, that's how it develops. When you're \nreligious, you have trained your brain to accept irrationality & made \nyourself gullible. Why do you think the worst politicians, or celebs that \nwant your praise, just say \"Jesus\" etc, to get your votes & money?\n\nIn the end, you're in control. Barring congenital defect, just like an \noverweight person may continue to eat - despite signs that they're getting \nill - you can choose to be rational & sane, or continue into mental illness \nby conditioning yourself into it.

They \"mess up\" the interpretations \nbecause it's easy to make anything up using it; it's fallible & \ncontradictory. That's what happens when men (not \"prophets\" or God) write a \nbook of laws to benefit themselves.\n\nOld Testament was about retribution, & the same kind of homophobia, female \noppression, racism, etc., we see in vile men today. When that got out of \ncontrol, breeding societies of lunatics that wanted blood from the leaders \ntoo, thinkers devised a better plan. It was, \"Ya, there's this new guy \ncalled Jesus. He says to give all your money & power to us, & turn the \nother cheek while we destroy you & your families lives. Oh, and remember to \npray for him to save you & forgive us.\"\n \nSeriously, why would anyone choose, as adults, to believe stories of people \nparting the oceans with a stick, walking on water, seven -headed dragons, \netc.? I'll tell you why... because it suits THEIR rhetoric. Objective, \nsane, & truly honest people might get spiritual, but never religious. \nReligion is for people that need a reason to keep hating some group & \npretend to be better than others by pointing fingers & shaming natural \nthings >.<",

Being selfish, hoarding money and resources are rewarded in this \nsociety. the strong survive week die, our god is all mighty, our way of \nlife is better so therefore we are better. This is the thinking taught and \naccepted by our society lived by all of us.\n  Im no better than anyone, I wear Nike, I drink star bucks, I have 2 cars \nthat I drive because I want to not need to. I hoard gold.\n Living a selfish life is survival if your society is built around the \nbelief the strong survive week die, we eat so there we are better.\n Many we know this but what do we do?\n The Human being has infinite potential we know this.\n In the systems that we all are under restricts all off us in every corner \nof the globe of true being.\nHow is are approach to the problem most efficient with the resources and \nability to distribute them best applied??\n\nMany would argue this.\n\nIf as a collective we analyzed if using $50K to build an orchard, soccer \nfield, and an 8 building orphanage is the most efficient use of money?\n A orphanage to \"Break the cycle of abandonment\".\nWere they can \"Educate the kids\"\nim not sure but I don't think this is the first Christian group to try this \nlol.\n\nI have no master save the world plan but this model of charity is not \nadaptable to the common person unless they directly send money to their \n\"Charity Fund\" believe me all \"Charity\" models like this will always have a \nplace for you to donate.\n Many would say\nBuilding community culture and society collectively is the only way to gain \ntrue control. Building where we are first a foundation of giving and \ncommunity that can be spread might be a better method.",
