You \nsay energy can not be made of anything yet photons are energy and yet made \nof things not to mention e has to be made of mass meaning its made of \nsomething. Cold is the absence of heat yet we can measure things with no \nheat (0\u00b0 K) There is no heat to measure yet we can measure it meaning we \ncan measure cold which is defined as the absence of heat. If we can measure \nsomething defined as the absence of something then how can we not measure \ndarkness? As *you* said its nothing but the absence of light(not the \nabsence of sound since that is considered \"silence\" which is also \nmeasurable which you say is impossible). Dark matter is extremely \ntheoretical? So is anti-matter. We can't obtain any since its instantly \ndestroyed on constant with matter. So saying that its \"extremely \ntheoretical makes no sense. Photons themselves as I said are not made of \nmatter since matter has to be made of a physical thing. Everything physical \nhas to be made of one of an element and none of those elements has \nsemi-intangibility nor are they energy(which photons are since they have \nphysical body of some sort making them ) ",

Remember that sight as we experience it is an illusion \nour brain generates to let us navigate the world. Color isn't a thing \nbeyond a certain wavelength of photon.\n\nWe use light to perceive the world, on earth it isn't exactly rare to see \nspecies that do this however, a animal that uses sound to navigate  would \nconsider something like a soundless vacuum, darkness would it not? A state \nthat makes surroundings hard to navigate, Its hard to see.\n\nBecause we can't see the world around us when we don't have that certain \nwavelength of visual light doesn't mean that there is a whole different \nparticle that takes its place. Darkness is the absence of visual light. \n\nEdit: Your definition of particle is off as well. You were looking at its \ndefinition as a noun, not in physics. In physics, a elementary particle \ncounts as a particle and photons are elementary particles so your beginning \nargument made no sense\n\nEdit2: \"Anything not a particle can be made of matter, anti-matter, dark \nmatter, dark energy\" Matter and anti-mater are made up of particles, dark \nenergy is a energy therefore nothing can be made of it, it can only be used \nand Dark matter is also extremely theoretical. So that part made no sense\n\nEdit3: \"We can't do that either how ever since we're on a planet made of \nmatter and they would have to be operated by humans presumably or by \nrobotic scientists who are either A.I.s or are being controlled remotely.\" \nI don't think we can control something made of anti-matter, taking care of \nanti-matter. Basically, we can come into contact, even with ai, because \nliterally everything is made of Matter and Anti-mater coming into contact \nwith matter is catastrophic.\n\n Edit4: \"We also know there is such things as dark matter\" We don't. Its a \ntheory. Astrophysics agree that dark matter explains certain observations \nthat conflict with our current understanding of physics. However it doesn't \nreally mean anything for our understanding since we have no idea what dark \nmatter is.\n\nEDIT5: Final point: Because we can't see it doesn't mean i didn't take that \nthought into consideration, its just that that thought made no sense to me. \nBecause we can't perceive it, it doesn't mean its a new thing.",

                    "text": "+Jon Nick Sean Yes but photons are made of no known elements making them \nnot true matter as defined by science which a particle is made of matter. \nThe exact definition of a particle is \"a minute portion of matter\" making \nphotons not truly a particle or matter. So the absence of of photons is not \ndefinitively a particle since photons are not particles themselves. \nAnything not a particle can be made of matter, anti-matter, dark matter, \ndark energy, or anything in between or outside our knowledge of known \nstates of things in the universe as we know of. And back to the topic of \nanti-matter real quick. We Can't measure anti-matter with tools made of \nmatter since they cancel each other out in theorized to be a nuclear \nexplosion similar to splitting a atom so in order to measure it we would \nneed to use tools made of anti-matter. We can't do that either how ever \nsince we're on a planet made of matter and they would have to be operated \nby humans presumably or by robotic scientists who are either A.I.s or are \nbeing controlled remotely.The thing is as I stated already we're on a \nplanet made of matter so we have only things made of matter(including \nourselves) so we couldn't even touch it or build something to touch it \nwithout both parties being destroyed or seriously damaged. That being said \nthat means we have no real idea who properties anti-matter has since we \ncan't study it for the a fore mentioned reasons. If we have no idea how \nanti-matter works, yet are able to clearly study it some how through \ntheoretical experiments we should be able to study darkness. Darkness could \nbe made of some sort of state of being, but we can't see it. A black hole \nis \"invisible\" to us since we can't see it due the the photons unable to \nescape the event horizon, yet we know its still there. We also know there \nis such things as \"dark matter\". A type of being that doesn't give off \nlight and \"consumes\" light given to it. Dark energy is the same. In fact in \nour universe the percents of different types of state to beings are 4% \nmatter, 23% dark matter, and 73% dark energy. So with only 4% of our \nuniverse we really know about how can you say darkness can not have some \nsort of state of being that can potentially be studied with the right \ntechnology? From what our eyes can see darkness goes faster then light can. \nit could end up working similar to a magnet force where light repels \"dark \nphotons\" so to speak and the dark does the same. Since there is no \nresistance in space and at the speed of light it seems to ignore friction \nand resistance then it would explain how light moves that fast without \nbeing thrown back if it is truly similar to magnetic forces.
