I think there's another possibility here. Some people, more \noften in fiction, but also in real life, refuse to be tempted out of sheer \ncontrariness: they don't want to do it BECAUSE the situation demands that \nthey do it.\ufeff",

Being \ncontrary for the sake of being contrary is a matter of staying true to \nyourself, it's a moral dillema in which you treat remaining yourself- not \nbeing pressured into action by outside sources, as a moraly GOOD decision.\n\nIt's a moral choice in the same way that refusing to participate in stoning \na person is a moral choice, derived from personal belief in value of \nnonviolnce, or human life, or the golden rule.

The urge to live is very strong. The reason we idolize this \nbehavior so much is partially because, in reality, it is very rare.\n\nFor me, if I were to have to make that decision, the only way I would not \nchoose to save their life, is if the whole situation happened so fast, I \ncouldn't save them in time, say like jumping in front of a bullet.\nBut if it was like, choose, should I shoot you? or this stranger?\nI would choose myself.

They don't look at drug abuse/alcohol abuse \nand it's consequences enough in the perspective that is should be healed \nnot punished. Sure, a person hurt another person in a car crash by \ndrinking, yeh, that is pretty dumb, but it is not very hard to do from a \ndrunk's perspective. It is easy to go over your limit, forget to call a \ntaxi and forget about laws. I want restorative justice. Cold blooded \nmurder, yeh, put him or her in jail for a few decades. Parking in the wrong \nplace, get a fine. But for offences like robbery, I want social services to \nexamine the case to see if they can figure out why. Maybe the thief wanted \nmoney to keep paying for drugs. One, Portugal has had some success with the \nlegalisation of soft drugs, IE marijuana, hash, so maybe an experiment \ncould be had to see what happens if we make it legal for say a 5 year \ntrial. If it works, it stays legal, if it does not work, then we make it \nillegal again. Two, put the guy in a drug therapy and recovery hospital, \nnot jail, where often ineffective drug rehabilitation occurs, if at all. \nThree, make it not a conviction, but a finding of guilt, if it is even \nneeded to go to trial for cases like this. Where there is a real reason for \nthe crime and the accused it sorry and wants to get better. This helps to \nmake him/her able to use other services, and fewer restrictions on \nemployment, and able to travel internationally easily. Make the criminal \nrecord open to very few, and make it erased of offences like this after say \n3 years. Four It is so easy to find yourself in the destructive cycle that \nseems endless, and so many are in the prison system who should not. I do \nnot mean those wrongfully imprisoned, but the others. Have that drug \nlegalisation trial and see what happens, and also, require courses in \nschool, by parents to children and by social services workers, and first \nhand experience by druggies who have quit things like cocaine, that tell of \nreally how to just say no, as even that is not enough many a time. People \nmight call you a chicken for not trying it, even when you know how horrible \nit is. Psychology is weird how this sort of pressure it so hard to resist. ",

Yes there are many psychologists that \ndo not use scientific principles, Freud didn't, but the people studying a \nsubject do not dictate it's worth, anything can be studied as a science. If \nphysicist turned to the bible it would be unscientific, but physics would \nstill be as scientific as it was before and physics is as scientific as \nresearch into sociology, chemistry, the loch ness monster, ghosts, doesn't \nmatter all that matters is how the field is researched. The only reason \npeople snub the social sciences is because it challenges religion and \npolicy, if legalizing hard drugs and prostitution in research and policy \nincreases health and reduces crime, but because most people see it as \nimmoral or unethical they snub it, just as they did with evolution, most \nphysisist, biologists and chemists are incredibly subjective outside their \nfield, a social scientist stays true to objectivity, accepting anything as \nlong as it has decent, peer reviewed, objective, valid and reliable support \nin all fields, not just their own field and leaving the thinking of other \nfields to their religion, friends, newspaper and community. BTW nothing is \ninherently a better science, that's a social construct, which is an \nundeniable observation, the explanations of the reason behind the social \nconstruct are the testable theories. FYI, this is not a feminist sociology \nrant, I am not a feminist, I don't attribute myself to a paradigm, just \nprefer to study social phenomena from the ground up rather than basing the \nhypothesis around a theory",

                "text": "Existence (nature) is made up of nothing buy absolutes, without \ncontradiction. \nIt is only the capacity of the consciousness, in it's ability to apply \nvalues to both concretes and abstractions, that non-absolutes and \ncontradictions are made. \n\nNo matter what we think we perceive, and think we know, existence/nature, \nwill not change. Not one iota. \n\nAll of our perceptions of concretes and abstractions will have values \nattributed to them by the individual. These values are then traded, \ninvested and accumulated. Or offset and avoided in the case of negative \nvalues. Our perception of the the value of a concrete or an abstraction may \nnot be functional or correct. \n\nAn action, or an ideology will be functional or dysfunctional dependent on \nit's alignment to existence. Which is, in this case, human nature as it is, \nNOT how we want it to be. That is, the values we discover as generally \npositive to us, or negative to us, regardless of our perceptions of \nconcepts will either be a benefit to us, or a detriment to us according to \nthe rules of actual human nature, or existence. Our perceptions and \nconcepts will either align with nature and existence and bring about a \nfunctional existence, or a dysfunctional existence based on our \nmisalignment with nature and existence. \n\n\nFrom that, people act in a way to profit most from any situation. The two \npossibilities are short term (opportunistic) or long term. \nTake the hypothetical situation of two men in a world without law or social \nstructures of any kind outside of procreation and survival. \nThey make a pact with each other to not kill one another for resources, but \ninstead, combine to protect each other's resources. \n\nThe long term thinker relies on trust, honour and integrity to pull this \noff. These abstractions become what we define as morality. Short term, he's \ngot to be prepared to take risks, and stand up for the values of others. \nLong term, he stands to gain the loyalty of someone, with the capacity to \ngreater protect his own. The two are now far better off. Better still if \nthey can freely trade surplus with each other. \n\nThe short term opportunist looks only at the moment, nods in agreement, and \npicks up the first rock he can find. No trust, no loyalty, no honour, no \nintegrity, no loyalty. For his short term gain, he remains little more than \nan animal at the mercy of those like him. \n\nThe long term thinker acts in a way that is greatly beneficial to all, as a \nmeans of producing the greatest benefit to himself. The short term \nopportunist seeks only the immediate benefit to himself, regardless of the \ndetriment to others, or the long term detriment to himself. \n\nThere are those among us that seek the unearned, are incapable of \nprinciples, and as moral as they can get away with. \nThese are collectivists, as collectivism gives rights to the unearned, it's \ntaking on relativism means principles are impossible, and engage in \nmorality by consensus. \nThese are the majority. \n\nThere are those among us that reject the unearned, and reject anyone \nattempting to gain the unearned from them, are reliant on principles, and \nhold to a morality defined by themselves, not others. \nThese are the individualists, as they claim rights to keep what is earned, \nthe reject relativism in order to hold principles, and morality is defined \nthrough the principles they hold to, by their own consciences and measure, \nregardless of consensus. \nThese are the minority. \n\nThe power this minority has, is that as the majority push societies into \nideologies and behaviors that don't align with the principles and laws of \nnature and existence, their can only become self-annihilating. \n\nExistence and nature, in this case human nature, will always win. \n\nWe can either align our thoughts and actions with nature and existence and \nbecome functional, or retreat into the whims of our consciences and \ndisregard existence and nature, and become dysfunctional. \n\nWe cannot bring about the existence we desiring that which is not in \nkeeping with nature; our nature, as defined by existence, not by our \nconsciences. \ufeff",

I challenge you \nto find any evidence in my previous posts that I've attacked his character.\n\nSecondly, you can't draw a causation with correlation from a real life \nevent to a scientific experiment that has already been proven by the \nscientific community to be unreliable and incapable of making any accurate \npredictions on human behavior.\nThat's like citing that the flawed circumcision study really does reduce \nthe transmission of AIDs, but ignored the fact that the non-control group \nin the sudy were given condoms and sexual education, so it was impossible \nto tell if circumcision actually did the trick or if it was the condoms \nthat were affecting the results. Zimbardo didn't even have a control group \nin his study to compare results with.\n\nThat's the problem with his study, because you can't identify if the cause \nof the Abu Ghraib event arose from the same factors that was in his study, \nbecause his study had so many uncontrollable variables that it becomes \nmeaningless and unusable. Does drinking coffee contribute to stomach \nulcers? Well it's impossible to tell because you've picked all of your \nsubjects as obese people and let them drink coffee, smoke, eat fries and \nburgers, drink alcohol, and all that junk.

I won't focus on your second \nparagraph, in your last comment to me. Instead I'll pose this to you. If \nSteven Pinker had written that comment of praise, in the exact same way, \nwould you say that is due to being gullible or naieve? If you know him, I'm \nsure you would agree it is totally within his personality to post a comment \nof that style. (imagine that scenario for a second, then re-read your \ncomment to Steven Pinker and look at how you sound)\n\n\"Giving an insight into what is clearly overstated should not quell his \nconfidence or beliefs, instead must give him some sense of needed \nself-awareness in his future posts.\"\n- This comment hinges on your original premise, that the praise was \n'overstated'.\n\nWhich you would argue is in contention. I would argue that there isn't \nenough information to make any claim.\n\nBut your belief that your comment would NOT quell his confidence or \nbeliefs, is ludicrous. In fact it aims to do just that. By insisting that \nhe is naive, is a direct attack on their beliefs, which in turn affects \nconfidence. Through this method it MAY still provide him self-awareness. \nBut more likely, as explained in this very video, it will result in \ncognitive dissonance. So his options are to either, agree with you in some \nway, or react defensively and hold firm to his belief - that this video is \nPRAISEWORTHY to the extreme. This latter outcome would actually hinder him \nfrom being able to produce any self awareness, as it is shrouded by his own \nincreased defenses.\n\nThis final point is the reason I questioned you. To ask why you put energy \ninto making a comment like that. You make your intentions clear. But you \nseem to be deluded in thinking your comment would only have a positive \noutcome on his part. This is why I suggest more POSITIVE ways to encourage \npeople to cultivate interests - if that is your intention. Otherwise you \ncan be easily confused with a dickhead or a troll.",

Zimbardo *blatantly FILLED* the experiment \nwith them.\n\nZimbardo *TOLD* the volunteers *(young boys, really)* how to act.\n\n*\"\"We cannot physically abuse or torture them,\" I said. \"We can create \nboredom. We can create a sense of frustration. We can create fear in them, \nto some degree. We can create a notion of the arbitrariness that governs \ntheir lives, which are totally controlled by us, by the system, by you, me, \n[Warden] Jaffe. They'll have no privacy at all, there will be constant \nsurveillance -- nothing they do will go unobserved. They will have no \nfreedom of action. They will be able to do nothing and say nothing that we \ndon't permit. We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. \nThey're going to be wearing uniforms, and at no time will anybody call them \nby name; they will have numbers and be called only by their numbers. In \ngeneral, what all this should create in them is a sense of powerlessness. \nWe have total power in the situation. They have none. ...\"*\n\nDuring the initial briefing Zimbardo and his researchers took it upon \nthemselves to\n*\"suggest means of keeping the prisoners under control without using \nphysical punishment.\"*\n\nCarlo Prescott, who had served 17 years in San Quentin for attempted murder \nand an outspoken advocate for prison reform, had spoken to Zimbardo *months* \nbefore the experiment and had this to say:\n\n*\u201c\u2026ideas such as bags being placed over the heads of prisoners, inmates \nbeing bound together with chains and buckets being used in place of toilets \nin their cells were all experiences of mine at the old \u201cSpanish Jail\u201d \nsection of San Quentin and which I dutifully shared with the Stanford \nPrison Experiment braintrust months before the experiment started. To \nallege that all these carefully tested, psychologically solid, \nupper-middle-class Caucasian \u201cguards\u201d dreamed this up on their own is \nabsurd.  How can Zimbardo \u2026 express horror at the behavior of the \u201cguards\u201d \nwhen they were merely doing what Zimbardo and others, myself included, \nencouraged them to do at the outset or frankly established as ground rules? \nAt the time, I had hoped that I would help create a valid, intellectually \nhonest indictment of the prison system. In hindsight, I blew it. I became \nan unwitting accomplice to a theatrical exercise that conveniently absolves \nall comers of personal responsibility for their abominable moral choices.\u201d* \n\nZimbardo asked Warden Jaffe (one of the researchers) to chastise a guard \nfor not *\"being more responsive to the job...\"*\n\nJaffe told him:\n*\"The guards have to know that every guard has to be what we call a 'tough \nguard.' The success of this experiment rides on the behavior of the guards \nto make it seem as realistic as possible.\"*\n\nHe *\"wanted to create a psychological atmosphere that would capture some of \nthe essential features characteristic\" of a \"real prison\" where \"prisoners \ncan be beaten, electrically shocked, gang-raped, and sometimes even \nkilled.\"*\n\n*________________________________________*\n\n\nThe kids were roleplaying the roles *as they were told to*.\n\nAfter the first 24 ours the 'prisoner' roleplayers obviously became \nrestless, and rambunctious, and bored. They stopped listening to the \nguards, blocked off their cells, playacting riots, escapes, etc.\n\nThey turned to Zimbardo's advice and did absurd things like spray the other \nkids with a fire extinguisher, because they had *no training* this wasn't a \nreal prison in any way, and they're kids dressed up as cops and robbers and \ntold to act cruel.\n\n*Despite all of this* the guards wanted to have a *privileged cell* to \n*reward* the kids who  behaved, but had to ask *Zombardo* for permission \nbecause they were supposed to be *cruel*.\n\nWhen one student began acting \"crazy\" Zimbardo said:\n\n*\"It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really \nsuffering and that we had to release him.\"*\n\nHe couldn't tell because they were *role playing*.\n\n*________________________________________*\n\nJohn Mark, one of the guards in the experiment had this to say in  the \nJuly/Aug, 2011, issue of the Stanford Alumni magazine\n\n*\"During the day shift, when I worked, no one did anything that was beyond \nwhat you'd expect in a situation like that. But Zimbardo went out of his \nway to create tension. Things like forced sleep deprivation\u2014he was really \npushing the envelope. I just didn't like the whole idea of constantly \ndisturbing people and asking them to recite their prisoner numbers in a \ncount. I certainly didn't like when they put a guy in solitary \nconfinement.\"*\n\n*\"At that time of my life, I was getting high, all day every day. I got \nhigh before I went to the experiment; I got high on my breaks and lunch. I \ngot high afterwards. I brought joints with me, and every day I wanted to \ngive them to the prisoners. I looked at their faces and saw how they were \ngetting dispirited and I felt sorry for them.*\n\n*\"I didn't think it was ever meant to go the full two weeks. I think \nZimbardo wanted to create a dramatic crescendo, and then end it as quickly \nas possible. I felt that throughout the experiment, he knew what he wanted \nand then tried to shape the experiment\u2014by how it was constructed, and how \nit played out\u2014to fit the conclusion that he had already worked out. He \nwanted to be able to say that college students, people from middle-class \nbackgrounds\u2014people will turn on each other just because they're given a \nrole and given power.\"*\n\n*\"Based on my experience, and what I saw and what I felt, I think that was \na real stretch. I don't think the actual events match up with the bold \nheadline. I never did, and I haven't changed my opinion.\"*\n\n\n*______________________________________*\n\n\nIt's an embarrassment to the field of psychology and its legitimacy, don't \never give the stanford prison experiment recognition because it's the \nperfect example of a completely unscientific, unethical, excuse of a \nprofessor *trying* to prove his hypothesis.\ufeff",
