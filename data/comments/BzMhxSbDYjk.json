If left to their own devices and with no real consequences for \nactions, this is what a large chunk of humans can bring themselves to do \n(or at least sit by and watch or not take action). Humans are animals. In \nevery sense of the word. This is why we create things like Law, Ethics, \nMorality, etc. To keep these inner demons (whether to commit these \natrocities or look the other way) that lurk in the depths of every human \nheart at bay. Even though our societies have gotten better (well, some \nhave) over time it's not because Humanity is improving. It's because we're \ndeveloping better systems, better laws and better philosophy.

I disagree with that view because many if not most of \nour evil tendencies shows clearly in infancy and early childhood without \nany evidence of having been taught to us. Such as our selfish crying, our \ndisregard for the lives of others, our urges to destroy other life out of \ncuriosity or amusement (kids killing bugs and birds), etc. \n\nI think it's only through intervention from ethical authority figures \n(parents, teachers, peers, counselors, etc.), constant external criticism, \nconstant self-criticism and self-evaluation, and higher thought that we \neventually partly free ourselves from these terrible natural passions.
