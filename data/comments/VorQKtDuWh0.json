Also there is no \npoltician calling a black person an ape. Maybe there once was but i doubt \nthe guy is still working there.\n\nYou think the PVV is wrong because you dont have any idea what they \nactually stand for. And yes they are dumbf*cks because of the way \nthey choose to express themselves. Doesnt change the fact they are saying \nsomething that IS an issue. They are just not politic correct about it.\n\nThey are mostly anti islam which makes a lot of sense to many people \nthrougout Europe. But they also defend muslims who are victems of that \natrocious religion. They defend immigrants who want to adjust to this \ncountry. And islam simply is a counter integration force. Even the kings of \nthe countries they come from still demand full first loyalty of these \npeople. which i would hope to think doesnt make sense.\n\nAlso the link about Zwarte Piet... its blown out of proportion for \nsomething that isnt even a real issue. Just because 26 fucktards are \nbutthurt for something neither they nor their grandparents have experienced \nor heared first hand doesnt allow them to try and destroy a traditional \nfest which is already so modified that it isnt racist in the first place.  \nThe coloured pieten have already been tried and it failed big time.. it \nsimply not working. Nor should it. most black dutch dont even have issues \nwith it and love the traditional fest.\n\nJust because your misinformed and dont understand it... gee its like a \ndiscussion with a creationist about evolution... doesnt make you right.",

People still butthurt about slavery should have \natleast experienced it to have a voice in the debate. \nAnd it specially would be good if the people standing there wouldnt be such \nracist themselfes and not the stereotypical angry negro. And then the \noverly sensetive hippy whiteys.\n\nAgain if it was the ZP of 25 years ago.. then i could understand a bit of \nit. But now.. its actually a positive stereotype. ",

Secondly, I don't \nthink liking and supporting the continued existence of Zwarte Piet is \nnecessarily motivated by racism.\n\n\"Maybe at one point it was but it isnt anymore.  Havent been for a while.\"\n\nAnd your evidence for this? Wait, let me guess ... because YOU don't think \nit is? Well, perhaps this is due to ignorance.\n\nAs I was typing before, I don't think liking and supporting the continued \nexistence of Zwarte Piet is necessarily motivated by racism. It IS, \nhowever, a byproduct of ignorance.\n\nThe image of ZP is in fact modeled after a slave that was quite popular, \nparticularly in Antwerp. It was the so called \"negerpage\".  So this \nbasically debunks the defense that ZP has nothing do slavery. ZP is modeled \nafter a slave. White people are mostly ignorant of this little factoid. \nBlack people (considerably more than 26,) aren't, and consequently feel \noffended.\n\nSo now that you know this, you are no longer ignorant. If you have changed \nyour mind on ZP, congratulations. If you haven't, I still won't label you \nas a racist. Why?\n\nBecause, just like religious people, Zwarte Piet lovers want to cling to \nsomething that makes them feel warm and fuzzy and brings up pleasant \nchildhood memories (even after learning that ZP was modeled after a type of \nslave) and engage in all sorts of mental gymnastics and use all sorts of \nlogical fallacies to try and defend it.\n\nI invite you to give me some of the reasons you think Zwarte Piet is okay. \nI guarantee that they'll be logical fallacies.

You used it on other \nvideos, so please stick to this language that everyone can understand.\n\nSecond: what you suggest is false. And here's a 1st quick clue that should \nconvince you that it is false: Muslims account for 5% of the population. If \nmost of the youngsters under 18 were Muslim, it would mean a fertility rate \nof Muslim women about 10 times higher than non-Muslim women. This latter \nfigure being 1.8 child/woman, your comment (if correct, which it isn't) \nwould require a fertility rate of 18 children/Muslim woman... which is \nnowhere near the reality.\n\nHere's a 2nd quick clue that should convince you that what you say is \nfalse: people under the age of 18 represent 24% of the country's \npopulation. If more than half of them were Muslim, this subgroup would \nrepresent 12% of the total country's population. And this figure is way \nbeyond the real statistic of 5% which includes Muslims of all age groups.\n\nAnd now for a 3rd quick clue: Muslims are crazy about the name \nMohammed/Muhammad. If that isn't the #1 name given to newborns, you need \nnot worry about a Muslim majority for decades. An example that will confirm \nthis to you is the case of Belgium's federal region \"Brussels\". Muslims \nshould represent 50% of the region's population around 2025 and you can \nfind the names charts online easily. BUT it was just an illustration and \nbeing the tyrant that I am, I will squash all further comments mentioning \nBelgium, just because I can... and also because my opening post was about \nthe awesomeness of the Dutch and that got lost after a xenophobe came to \nspew his hatred of people who don't have blue eyes and blond hair.\n\nConclusion: please check the data before making extraordinary claims!",

Havent been for a while. Just becuase 26 idiots feeling buthurt \nabout something that not even their grandmothers have experienced first \nhand. They CAUSED the racist outburst. Even people who generally are very \nmuch against racism were so freakin annoyed by these dumbfucks.  And the \nfunny thing was most of the anti-piet guys are more racist themselves. \n\nIslam.. in what way you look at it.. its a horrible religion just like \nchristianity is. The difference is muslims are still much more \nfundamental.  Many of the muslims that come to the Netherlands are also \nmore fundamental then the people they left behind. But sure not all. I know \nvery nice people who are good people despite of that vile religion.\n\nThere is no denying that islam has very bad unwanted influences in the \nwest. There is no denying we still have imams saying that muslims should \nconquer the west. And that we are all pigs and should die. (ok those are \nthe extreme version but in general they are not that nice)\n\nThe fact we have honor killings/ revenge. We have more muslim organisation \nthen there are issues to talk about these days. I was Always let to believe \ngrowing up that people who came here did something called integrating. \nAdjusting to the life here. The thing is that is long long gone.  For some \nsick reason we accept muslims on the workfloor not willing to treat women \nequally. Or that for some reason women should have seperated swimming \nbecause otherwise they are beaten by their husbands.  I get the idea that \nits commercially good for the bathing house but its kinda nuts to begin \nwith it doesnt belong in the Netherlands. Specially not that a swimming \npull is basicly put into a Burka fortress for them its stupid.\n\nAll these influences do not belong here. The issues that are caused by \nthe cultures of these people are very real too. Or do you want to deny that \ngays are bullied out of their homes because of these people. Sure there are \nstupid dumbf*ck Dutch aswell. But the majority is islamic, Marocan and \nTurkish who do this. There is also no denying that in general the \nyouth under 25 is causing much more problems then native dutch under 25. Or \natleast a more violent criminal problems. After 25 that seems to stop. So \ni'm guessing its a cultural thing. And there are many issues that need to \nbe adressed and should be handled more harschly in my personal opinion.\n\nIslamic culture and ideas, just like fundemental christianity has no place \nin 2014.  I understand your first reaction will be to call me a racist. \nSadly this word is so overused because of the silencing effect it has no \nmore value in my eyes.  Everyone who is critical about stuff like this is \nbeing silenced by calling him a racist, Nazi or Hitler. Its getting old.\n\nI am not worried islam will overtake the country because also most \nimmigrants see how ridiculous the religion is and downgrade it to a, i'm a \nmuslim, or something. status. Which is great. The less religion the better. \nI do worry about the influences and the status apartus it seems to have \nthese days. Mostly because of people who try to silence everyone with those \nmeaningless words.  \nI do think its wrong to allow Burkas and i agree its ok to wear a headscarf \nalthoug i would hope the person wearing it wants to be part of the dutch \nsociety and choses to leave it off and integrate. Same for the anti gay \nattitude and the women are inferior. If you want to work you treat the \nwomen completely equal and shake their hands as a human should do. Leave \nthe f*cking religion at home.\n ",

I could replace every word of \nEU there with the USSR. Doesn't make it a great place to live. But let's \nsee anyway:\n\nMuch lower minimum wage?

In the end it really depends on the \nperson you ask. A lazy freeloader will probably be much better off in \nEurope, while a doctor or master-degree engineer will get rewarded much \nmore for their hard work here.\n\nAnd if your going to compare the two, there really is no point.

On \nthe other side there is a libertarian party putting all their trust in \ncorporations and privatising governmental institutions to the point where \nwe should get rid of the police and private arms restrictions and let us \nfend for ourselves. There\u00b4s even an orthodox Christian party to see their \nparty\u00b4s first women be featured on their list, since the party was founded \nin 1918. \n\nTo say our politicians are progressive in comparison to US politicians is \ntrue for some. But the real issue is, nobody gives a shit if you use \nGrinder to reach out to voters. The biggest scandel of these elections is \nour very own Dutch version of Glenn Beck: Geert Wilders, to lash out at our \nDutch-Maroccan brothers and sisters. Asking his constituents during his \nvictory speech whether they would like less or more Maroccans, they \nchanted: 'LESS!'.

The left loves to portray gun owners as violent \nand irresponsible, religious people as ignorant and stupid, southerners as \nlazy and uneducated, conservatives as brainwashed etc. See, it works both \nways.\n\nThe left tolerates other religions? That's funny.\n\nThing is that that liberals don't understand what culture is. And this lack \nof understanding allows you people to have no problem with a multi-cultural \nsociety. But it's pretty much been proven that immigrants don't adopt our \nculture but instead become polarized. In the South for example there are of \ncourse lots of Hispanic immigrants, legal and illegal, and some of them get \nthe poor addicted to drugs, start gang wars, kill police officers. And then \nthe left laughs that the South has a higher crime rate. Are we supposed to \nignore this?\n\nI am against big corporations as much as socialist governments, Fox News \nisn't - that's where they get their money, but most of us are. But we \nunderstand that big governments don't stop these corporations, they support \nthem.\n\nIn Europe the government protects others from oppression. But in America, \nand our founders made this clear, that the people must always have the \npower to fight off possible government oppression, and we don't want to \ngive an ounce of that power away.",

                "text": "Well, I suppose it had to happen eventually. The Dutch government is \nclearly just so determined to prostrate its country towards Mecca that \ninsulting Islam is now officially a criminal offence. That's right. You're \nnot allowed to insult anyone's beliefs in The Netherlands even if those \nbeliefs insult you and everything you stand for. As part of the ongoing \nIslamisation process the Amsterdam appeals court has sanctioned the \nprosecution of an elected politician for making a film critical of Islam, \nand for comparing The Koran with Mein Kampf. I have to say I've never \nactually read Hitler's book, but I have read The Koran and, as an \nunbeliever (which I am, by the way; I don't know if I've ever mentioned \nthat before)\nIf I talked about Muslims the way their holy book talks about me I'd be \narrested for hate speech, and I'd probably end up in prison. Fortunately I \ndon't feel inclined to behave in that way because I don't feel the same \nlevel of hatred towards Muslims that their holy book evidently feels \ntowards me.\nIn justifying this prosecution the court said that it went according to the \nstandards of the European Court of Human Rights, which I have to say rang \none of two alarm bells for me, because I think we all know by now that \nwhenever we hear the words 'human rights' in connection with Islam we're \nabout to be confronted with another piece of ugly opportunism that spits in \nthe face of genuine human rights and insults everyone's intelligence.\nAnd so it was a few months ago when the Islamic dictatorships hijacked the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Council and immediately demandedthat western \ngovernments make it a crime to criticise Islam. At the time I didn't know \nwhether the Dutch or the Swedish government would be the first to snap to \nattention and offer them everything they want on a silver plate. But in the \neven the Dutch establishment just happened to have a convenient fall guy \nwho they didn't want embarrassing them any more, because let's be fair, \nthey're more than capable of embarrassing themselves.And what a wonderful \njob they're doing of that at the moment;embarrassing not only themselves, \nbut their people, their country, in fact the entire continent of Europe is \nblushing for Holland today, especially for the dhimmi judges of Amsterdam \nto whom the politics of appeasement are clearly more important even than \njustice. Shame on you.\nAnd what kind of justice system is it where the truth is inadmissible as \nevidence?What kind of a place are the Dutch people allowing their country \nto turn into? From a beacon of enlightened liberal values to the leading \nedge of the new totalitarianism in just a few short years thanks entirely \nto the influence of Islam. \nYou're being chewed up and spat out, is what's happening to you people. \nLook at what you're doing. You're prosecuting a man who lives under 24 hour \nprotection from attack by violent Muslims, yet he's the criminal for \nexpressing an opinion. Lewis Carroll couldn't have written this one any \nbetter. Nobody should be compelled to respect an ideology that doesn't \nrespect them, and Islam respects nobody. It claims dominion. Respect \ndoesn't come into it. You submit. That's the deal.\nThe Dutch people are finally waking up to this fact. Sixty percent of them \nnow consider Islam to be a threat to their national identity. Unfortunately \nnone of those people are in power. The ones who are in power have pretty \nmuch backed themselves into a corner. \nEither continue with this toxic multicultural lie indefinitely or admit to \na catastrophic mistake in opening the floodgates to Islam in the first \nplace. But they could never to that, because that would be racist. That's \nquite a predicament, isn't it? It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. In \nfact it's still quite funny because stupidity in action is always pretty \nfunny.\nBut this is a dark hour for The Netherlands, there's no doubt about that. \nAnd it's also a watershed moment for the rest of Europe. We'll all be \nwatching now to see how this turns out. If these charges succeed we'll know \nthe dyke has been breached and it's the beginning of the end of justice as \nwe know it in Europe, and the beginning of creeping sharia, or injustice as \nwe know it.Looking forward to that? No, me neither.\n\nThe truth is sometimes offensive, there's no doubt about that, but it \ndoesn't make it any less true. And the truth is that there are millions of \npeople all over the western world who are absolutely sick and tired of \nIslam. They're sick of hearing about it, and they're sick of having to make \nallowances for it that aren't deserved. And they feel enough is enough. And \ntheir voices will be heard. \nThe multicultural mafia can pretend it ain't so, and pass all the laws they \nwant to, and continue to harass people and shut down internet connections \nand generally behave like the Gestapo, but it isn't going to work. You \ncan't change people's hearts by force. We are not going to respect Islam \nuntil Islam starts to respect us. But then if that ever happened it \nwouldn't be Islam any more. And that in a nutshell is the problem.\nPeace, and good luck Netherlands. You're going to need it.\ufeff",
