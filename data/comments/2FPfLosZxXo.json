                    "text": "+divebomber50 Let's look at it this way, I live about 1100 miles away from \nmy home town and subsequently most of my family.  An average gasoline \npowered car with only one driver can realistically make the trip in 24 \nhours including stops and a couple naps.  A Tesla Model S has 2 available \nbattery options, but lets say for the sake of argument that it is equipped \nwith the top of the line 85-kWh battery.  Now according to Tesla this \nbattery offers a 300 mile range (now car and driver got an average range of \njust over 200 miles but I'll ignore that for the sake of argument), \nmeaning, that you will have to stop and charge a minimum of 3 times along \nthe way (more realistically 5 but......).  Not all charging stations are \ncreated equal, (according to Tesla) your standard house socket would take a \nwhopping 60 hours to fully charge an empty 85-kWh battery.  But, say you \nluck out and find HPWC charging stations along the way (the fastest way to \ncharge a Tesla outside of their own 75 minute super charge stations).  This \nwill still take about 5 hours, meaning that on top of the minimum 18 hours \nof driving there is a minimum of 15 hours of charging.   So, in the \nabsolutely most ideal scenario, a 24 hour trip takes you 33 hours.  Now, \nlets look at the FCX Clarity and give it the same best scenario possible \nlike we did for the Tesla (IE: a scenario where proper refueling stations \nare available).  It only has a range of 240 miles.......but refueling takes \nminutes, not hours.",

Do \nyou want only the manufacturer to sell directly? Where is the competition \nthen? If a car is hot, it can jack up the price, just like Apple does by \ncontrolling the retail prices of its products. This is why Apple's products \nare basically the same price, whether you buy from Amazon or Best Buy, and \nif Best Buy offered a discount not allowed by Apple, it'd lose Apple \nproducts to sell. \n\nTo allow competition - Which is what Republicans favor - the prices have to \nbe different in one state from another with different local dealers \ncompeting against each other and we the consumer getting the best deal that \nwe can negotiate. So the Republican argument actually favors competition, \nwhich the hosts conveniently don't talk about. \n\nInterestingly, I think Tesla itself will change its position one day when \nit starts to make more cars than the demand. When it will have excess \ninventory sitting in different states, it will have to allow local dealers \nto have the freedom to make deals and negotiate the prices. It will all be \nabout basic economics of supply and demand. Again, the hosts don't get into \nthat theory either. It seems it is easy for them to make the argument on \npolitics than on economics, though they still make some good points that I \ndid not think about.\n\nWhat are your views?

They would go the dealer way. What is not happening is some \nin the disguise of  capitalism are preventing Tesla to even succeed to \nreach that level, why is that so because honestly I do not think it is just \nthe dealers involved it is the big 3's interests so that they can delay the \nproduct Tesla has to market and in the mean time come out with something \nwhich can compete with it.... Well there is nothing wrong in trying to \ncompete as it is free market, but free market also dictates some fare \nrules. Just because they are too big to manage their dealerships you cannot \nforce the smaller guy to be nimble. This is the reason why so many \nstart-ups every day uproot big companies in Bay Area or any place for that \nmatter of fact. In a weird way that is why this country is so competitive. \nSome narrow minded dimwits are not understanding, well they are stupid to \nstart with and more following it as they have nothing better to do.",

Are you really going \nto sit there and try to convince me that cars that were made in a time when \nthey had NO idea what carbon-monoxide does to the atmosphere is better than \na modern car which has several systems on it to reduce the pollution output \nof the car?\n\nThe state in which the vehicle operates has NOTHING to do with whether or \nnot the vehicle puts out pollution.  Emissions are the things that come out \nof the tailpipe, not the tests they do in a state to determine whether the \nvehicle can be driven.\n\nAs I said in my last comment, Tesla was should not have charged you to \ncollect your car.  They should have collected it for free since that is \nwhat they claim they will do.  It is also their responsibility to ensure \nthat the batteries in their products are working correctly.  That is still \nnot endemic of a company-wide problem.\n\nI will say it again since you seem to not hear me.  Tesla does NOT build \nHYBRIDS.  They build ALL ELECTRIC cars.\n\nThere is no way in hell your truck runs on veggies.  The technology of \nbiofuel is simply not cost effective enough to run a vehicle on it.  Since \nyou are most likely NOT a chemical engineer, I very much doubt you have the \nskills needed to produce biofuel.  As such, even if you did manage to \nconvert your truck to run on it, you would not have a sufficient supply to \ngo all the way to California and back.\n\nJust how exactly is Tesla harming the environment?  They are doing FAR LESS \ndamage to the environment than any other auto maker.  They do not require \nnearly as much material for a model S as say, oh I don't know, YOUR TRUCK. \n A Model s is made from aluminum.  Your truck is made from steel and iron. \n Both of which require a great deal of destructive mining to get at. \n Aluminum is MUCH closer to the surface and can be mined using much less \ninvasive techniques.",

What I said was when they break down it is \ndifferent to the way a gasoline car breaks down.  Also, how does lack of \nparts equate to the break downs being \"much worse then gas cars\" exactly? \n Just so you know, Tesla knows as much about fixing their cars as Ford does \nabout fixing their cars.\n\nWhy would you buy a vehicle from another state?  My nearest Tesla store \n(what's with the quotation marks?) is in DC so when my Tesla breaks down, I \nonly have to \"send\" it two hours round trip.  Actually, Tesla Motors only \nhas to transport it 2 hours round trip.\n\nYour brother had the misfortune of getting a bad battery in his car when he \nbought it.  That hardly is a scale-able issue to the entirety of Tesla's \ncars.  One issue does not a problem make.  One moron does not an expert \nmake.\n\nFour grand to ship a car from Ohio to California seems pretty reasonable to \nme.  I think most people would agree with me.  Although, it is surprising \nthat Tesla charged you for it.\n\nAs for saying only \"pretentious douche bags that want to look green but \nreally are much worse on the environment then anybody \" driving Teslas, you \nclearly do not understand the meaning of the word pretentious.  Seems to me \nyou are the \"pretentious douche-bag\" since your truck is doing FAR more \ndamage than any electric car could ever do to the environment.\n\nFinally, how the hell is a Dodge Charger better for the environment than an \nelectric car?  The Charger is a legacy car which means it has absolutely no \nemission control technology on it.  While it is true that hybrids are only \nslightly BETTER than gasoline cars, Tesla does not make hybrids.  They make \nELECTRIC cars.  Electric cars REDUCE emissions by removing gasoline from \nthe equation.  Thus, Tesla is helping to reduce pollution while your \nbrother is just another part of the problem.",

That is \nessentially what burning means; rapid oxidation via application of intense \nheat.  In other words, when you burn something you are forcing the material \nto combine with oxygen.  The difference between \"burning\" a fuel and \nrunning it through a fuel cell is that the fuel cell does not require \nexternal heat be applied to it.\n\nThe \"explosive nature\" has nothing to do with an impact or breach.  All \nthat is needed for the tank to explode is for the pure oxygen to be \nintroduced to the hydrogen in a rapid manner.  Yes that is how you get \nwater, but it also causes the tank itself to become highly flammable.  The \nHindenburg comes to mind.\n\nYou do realize that \"nuclear\" is a fairly nebulous term, right?  Do you \nmean a fusion reactor or a fission reactor?  Because fission is actually a \nVERY well-established and stable power source.  Fusion is also very well \nestablished.

The Hydrogen itself is not being burned like it would be in a \ntraditional internal combustion engine. The explosive danger comes in the \nform of an impact or tank breach. The fuel Cell itself is actually \nproducing electricity to power an electric drive system, the fuel cell is \nfed hydrogen from an on-board hydrogen tank. The only help advancements in \nmetallurgy would produce is sturdier tanks. \"Gaskets, bearings, fuel supply \nchannels, rings, pistons, valves, etc.\" Are not relevant.\n\nI do however agree about the catch 22 of how efficiently the hydrogen can \nbe acquired in the first place. Unless there is some miracle of a \nrevolution in solar, wind, fusion etc; the electricity required to produce \nHydrogen will have to rely on the same old same old, Nuclear, Natural Gas, \nCoal etc. Check out these informative videos.\n\n/watch?v=08ZH7vwzzEg\n/watch?v=2FPfLosZxXo",

What does that prove? \nAll you're proving is that there are other people just as uninformed as you \nare.\nb) You don't know enough to comment or make claims. Your short attention \nspan doesn't even allow you to learn enough to comment or make claims. Yet, \nyou comment and make claims anyway.\nc) Auto makers and energy policy makers cannot bank everything on any one \ntechnology, and I wouldn't do so either if I was in their shoes. That being \nsaid, you can tell which technologies are the leaders, vs. which ones are \nthe \"backup plans\" purely by the amount of money they're spending on it. \nThe department of energy has spent an average of $150 million per year on \nhydrogen fuel cell development/advancement in the past 10 years. They spend \nabout $8 billion per year on battery electric car development. And, about \nthe same ratio is true in all of the major auto manufacturers. Each major \nauto manufacturer is spending billions on battery electric car development, \nand only millions on hydrogen fuel cell development. These are the people \nwho know this material 100x better than you and I put together, and their \nmoney is going into battery electric cars... globally... across the \nboard... with few or zero exceptions. It's pretty clear to me that the best \nexperts in the world think you're wrong, and if you don't believe it, \nfollow the money.\n\n2) You said: \"Surely if RENEWABLE energy was used to power the electrolysis \nprocesses\"\nResponse: Again - so what? You can grind up a tree to make a \nsingle toothpick if you want to. But, you can't make the argument that it's \na smart use of the tree. It costs about $18K worth of solar panels to \ngenerate the amount of electricity needed to recharge the battery for an \nelectric car every day. To do the same job with hydrogen fuel cells, it \ncosts about $55K worth of solar panels to generate daily hydrogen to drive \nthe same number of miles in a fuel cell car. Or, you can pay $55K and \ncharge 4 battery powered cars. Just because an energy source is called \n\"renewable\" doesn't make it responsible or smart on any level to advocate a \nsolution that wastes that energy that could be going into other things. Run \nyour toaster. Heat your home. Whatever. The point is, \"renewable\" energy \nstill isn't cheap energy, and still requires scarce resources. Wind \nturbines, solar panels, tidal energy generators, etc., are all very \nexpensive, and all require maintenance, and you can't advocate \nINefficiencies simply because you've chosen hydrogen as your pet favorite \n(while being completely ignorant of the topics). If the hydrogen fuel cell \ncar is going to be more viable than battery electric cars, it's certainly \nnot going to be because of the use of renewable energy. No matter what way \nyou spin it, you can't justify the energy waste on its merits alone, so \ndon't even try. If hydrogen fuel cell cars win the race to market \nviability against battery electric cars (which is a 100-to-1 long shot at \nbest, but who knows), it'll be because battery technology ends up costing \ntoo much, or they hit a standstill in development, or something like that. \nIt will NOT be because you can justify the extra energy consumption, \n\"renewable\" or not.\n\n3) You said: \"thanks for the cookie\"\nResponse: Go get a REAL education while you're eating your cookie. And, no, \nI didn't put your favorite drug of choice into the cookie, so don't get \nyour hopes up.",

And, the more you use them, the less \nthe lithium ion batteries can be charged the next time, requiring expensive \nreplacements too frequently for most people's liking. They're trying to \ncombat this effect by not allowing you to charge/discharge the battery to \nfull capacity, but then that results in cars like the Chevy Volt, which \nthey've restricted to only about a 40 mile range on battery in order to \npreserve the battery's long term life. But, in today's world of technology \nadvancements, I say confidently that battery/electric cars are far closer \nto \"full\" viability than hydrogen fuel cell cars.  And, as you've \nacknowledged, energy efficiency is a handicapping factor for hydrogen fuel \ncells which cannot be overcome (because it pertains to the very \nchemical/physical nature of the electrolysis process itself). Electric cars \ntoday are available (obviously), but they are still too expensive, and have \ntoo many shortcomings, to consider them viable (yet) for a typical middle \nclass buyer. As battery technology advances, and as electric drivetrain \ntechnology advances, it's probable that battery electric cars will become \nthe most viable option to displace gasoline powered cars.\n\n- I don't have a crystal ball, however, and I cannot guarantee that battery \nelectric cars will overcome their shortcomings and become the most viable \nnon-gasoline alternative. But, as I said before, battery electric cars are \nabout 20 years closer to viability than hydrogen fuel cell cars, and have \nenergy advantages.",

What effect it has varies with which \natmospheric layer it's in and on the latitude. In the lower stratosphere \n(closest to the surface and close to the equator also where a lot of \ncommercial jets fly) increased CO2 is slowing the production of new ozone \n(which may account for an increase in ozone restoration after the \ngrounding) , especially in the spring. But near the poles and in the upper \nstratosphere, CO2 is increasing the amount of ozone by preventing nitrogen \noxide from breaking it down. According to a study published in the March \n2002 Journal of Geographical Research by a joint research team from the \nUniversity of Maryland and NASA, overall, the increased amount of CO2 in \nthe atmosphere is speeding up the recovery of the ozone layer -- including \nthe hole at the South Pole.  So CO2 in no way directly depletes ozone.  ",

If nuclear power is to sustain our \neconomy the industry needs massive investments which will come out of \ntaxpayer pockets to modernize existing reactors, and make new reactors. \nThere is also a substantial risk of a reactor meltdown or accident, anyone \nremember Three Mile Island, Fukashima, and Chernobyl?",
