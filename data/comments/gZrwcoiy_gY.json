He is back to walking in a slow slink and hiding behind the bed, ever \nsince.  I feel so badly about it!  We keep them separated for almost a year \nnow, and have tried some of these techniques, but she seems to have a screw \nloose.  I am thinking she might always have to be kept separated from the \ntwo boys we have.   She also lunges viciously at our other male cat, who is \nthe same age as her, but he doesn't seem to get as traumatized...but of \ncourse, we still keep them apart.  When they see each other under a door, \nthey go at it with paws under the door.  The young male had to have \nantibiotics because she hurt his paw, last month, from under the door.  \nBlocking the doors with towels doesn't work   She just pulls on them until \nthey are on her side, and she could see under the door, again. \n\nWe would re-home her to an only cat situation, but here in Florida, there \nare no no-kill shelters or fosters that have any free space, and people who \nare looking for cats have their choice of thousands since there are so many \nin shelters and rescues.  We don't have any other options, but to keep her \nhere, and feel bad that she is so confined for most of the day.  She gets \nsome free time out when boys are locked up, but it is limited.\n\nShe won't eat, at all, not even treats, if she knows that there is another \ncat on the other side of the door.  She is more obsessed with who is out \nthere.  No distraction gets her away from obsessing with the door.  That is \nwhy I don't think the techniques in this video will work for the calico. ",

                "text": "Jackson, the two-cat dynamic going on in my home has a slight variation to \nthe standard version you are addressing in vid. I have 2 neutered males, \n6-7 yrs. One of my cats (I'll call him Cat A) had to go to the vet recently \n(UT crystals, which I caught right away), and since keeping them separated \nwhile he recoups, the other one (Cat B) has become circumspect of him, and \nthey can't seem to be reintroduced without a bloodbath! They were never \nlovey-dovey to begin with, but they, at least, had an acceptance of the \nother and have always spent most of their time in the same room hanging \nout... until now. Additionally, the day I had to take Cat A to the vet, my \nfirst attempt at getting him in the carrier was a colossal FAIL, and Cat B \nwas so agitated by the commotion, hissing and protests of Cat A that he was \ncompelled to beat the F--- out of Cat A! Energy escalating energy! Poor Cat \nA was already weakened by feeling sick, only to wind up getting blood and \nfur drawn! It was as if they had established some sort of new dynamic of \nsearing hate towards each other, of which, I can't seem to reset!\nShould I treat them like two strangers now - introducing them for the first \ntime? Or, considering that they have known each other for years, is there \nanother method or technique that would work more specifically? These cats \nlive here year-round with my 80 yr old mother, while I am here only for the \nwinter months. When I leave town, they will remain with her, and I can't \nafford to have her managing a nightmare at her age, by herself! Thank you \nso much, Jackson! Blessings to you always...\nPS.

If you can keep B shut up when getting A into the kennel and \nif you can keep B away from A to allow A to heal it will be good. There \nmust be fresh water every day and in several places to help A get well and \nkeep the crystals from coming back.

It \nis dangerous for all because sometimes a cat will go on or under the gas or \nbreak pedals, or jump on the dashboard in front of the driver.  Withhold \nfood for at least 3 or four hours before setting out because cats can get \ncar sick if they have a full stomach.  Line the carrier with some towels, \nand a wee wee puppy training pad to absorb any eliminations.  For long \ndistance travel, a large carrier with room for a litter box is good.  For a \nlong distance trip, a hard carrier is best in case there is a crash- the \ncat will be more protected. And, of course, NEVER leave a cat in a car in \nthe heat without AC or they can die from heat.  Cars heat up very fast in \nhot weather.  Windows cracked open is not good enough.  If the humans need \na rest stop break, best to have one human stay in the car with the cat \nwhile the other person tends to their needs.",

One was 7 months old at \nthe time, now she's a little more than a year. The other was around 1 1/2- \n2 years old. So the kitten, she was easy to teach her out of bad habits, \nget her to take treats, eat wet food, etc etc.\nOur other cat.. not so much. She has a problem with scratching everything \nBUT the scratching posts we've bought and I've tried everything I can think \nof to fix it.\nAlso, the other thing with her that concerns me is that she will only eat \ndry cat food. We had no idea she had a distaste for wet food until we \ndecided to switch up their food and treat them with some wet food... which \nwe thought they'd go crazy over. The kitten did, but our other cat did not. \nIn fact, she backs away from it like she is fearful. She is fine with dry \ntreats, but nothing wet or that's not a dry kibble. We recently bought cat \nmilk because our youngest cat goes nuts every time we have cereal. We could \ntell she really wanted to drink the milk but of course we didn't let her. \nWell, SHE LOVES the cat milk... we tried to give it to our oldest cat... \nshe backs away from it like we're trying to poison her. Since we adopted \nher when she was already over 1 years old (closer to 2 most likely), I have \nno idea where this is coming from. Fear? Habit? Not being allowed to eat \nwet things? Idk...\nShe eats and she's healthy, I just worry she's not getting enough variety. \nPlus I want to treat her with yummy wet food or something every now and \nthen! Any advice? Sorry this was long-winded.\ufeff",

The kibble looks untouched.   \nThat said, cats only recognize what is edible based on what their mom ate, \nso the poor deprived cat from a cereal-only household does not know the \ngood stuff is edible.   It is worth encouraging her to sample wet food -- \nas dry food is known to cause obesity and urinary tract problems.    To do \nthis, split the wet food eater's meal into two dishes and put one near the \ndry cruncher at mealtime, before giving her the dry stuff.   You can try \nputting a few kibbles on top of the wet food.  Over time, she might realize \nthat the wet food is not hurting the other kitty and will try it.  But, NOT \nif you leave dry food out all the time.  You have to give her just a small \namount of dry food at each meal.   Start with half the recommended amount \nbased on the package directions and her weight (this is usually around a \nquarter cup), and then subtract a teaspoon until she is anxious for the \nnext meal.   By feeding her just enough, she will be more tempted to try \nthe wet food.",
