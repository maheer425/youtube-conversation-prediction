I feel as though \nsome parents force their children to go for something just because of \nstatus. I think it's important to like what you do and follow your dreams, \nnot just doing something because of status or because others think that's \nwhat you should be doing. It also mentions that just because you are doing \nsomething with your life, it shouldn't stop you from your hobbies or the \nthings you like to do. Overall, we shouldn't mold or fix ourselves to be \nsomething just because people want us to be that way. We should want to be \nthat way and be ourselves, not just follow the media or whatever the rest \nof the world wants. Life is short, by the time you feel regretful about not \ndoing something you have always wanted to do, you won't be able to do it \nanymore so might as well just live your life to it's fullest. Maybe I \nmissed it, but I don't see how they are downplaying science in here\u2026 F=ma \nis an important formula but it took a whole lot of imagination to get \nthere.

Anyways, thanks \nNewton! Love this video though\u2026Mayday is awesome! I can really relate to \nthis.

Many of the major technological breakthroughs of the recent years \ndepend largely on science and engineering - without them we would not have \nnew tools in biomedical science, information technology, electrical systems \netc. The negative aspect is that science and engineering has been largely \ngeared towards profit motives in the recent years, rather than for the \npursuit of knowledge. Inventions are made more for their marketability to \ncustomers instead of how they can help humanity improve as a whole \n(especially when thinking about luxury items like the smartphone and \nflatscreen tvs) Science should be for the acquirement of objective \nobservations of nature (although objectiveness itself is hard to determine \ntoo) and (maybe) on improving human lives and the environment in a positive \nway. \n\nIn fact this MV itself also argues for the importance of allowing children \nto pursue their interests, even if it is in science (the girl was clearly \ninterested in studying physics and rocket science, but was forced to study \nmedicine, probably because being a surgeon is more profitable than studying \nrockets). The formula F=ma (and its repetition on the board) was probably \nto show how rote learning has destroyed the passion for learning in \nchildren, focusing only on teaching them how to get good grades in exams. \nPerhaps the downplaying of the formula was not to downplay science but \nrather to criticize the suffocation of the human learning spirit by the \ncapitalist machinery.
