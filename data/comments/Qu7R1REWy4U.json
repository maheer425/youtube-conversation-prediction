                "text": "I am twelve. I normally turn the lights off by 9:00 or 9:30, and ten crawl \ninto bed with my phone until anywhere from 10:30 to midnight on school \nnights. On weekends, I normally am passed out by midnight, but sometimes I \nget devious and stay up until 5 AM, working on yesterday's drawing, as I am \nan artist at heart. I suffer from night terrors and sleep apnea. If I may \ndescribe night terrors to you, it is almost as if they never happened... \nBut it did. I'd fall asleep, and wake up the next morning with my blankets \nthrown to the side, something broke, maybe Im even upside down or on the \nfloor. My little sister would always complain about how I would mumble and \nscream words in the night. She couldnt understand them, but they werent \njust typacall screams and mumbles, so I was saying SOMETHING. I kept the \nwhole family awake. Not to mention, I also have sleep apnea. I get roughly \n20%-40% less good sleep than I should. It makes my day hard and lots of \ntimes (1 out of 5 days) I skip school to stay home and regather myself. It \nmakes a huge impact on my grades but I'd have worse grades WITHOUT doing \nthat. I also have a resistance to insomnia. I have stayed up for hours on \nmy phone, computer, 3DS, and my other computer (One is primarily for gaming \nand digital art because it is touchscreen, and the other is for schoolwork) \nand as soon as I decide to call it a night, I pass out instantly. I call it \na night at, sometimes, RARELY, 7 AM. So you're thinking I've played for at \nLEAST 7 hours, and I have no insomnia from even doing it in the dark. Back \nto night terrors, I have been getting better with them. At this point in my \nlife, I wish to see and remember my night terrors. Some, I actually do \nremember. LOTS I forget. I'm really into creepy stuff right now, fuck I \neven say I'm a vampire and I threaten to rip out people's throats. Which I \nwon't, but I say I will. My favorite band is focused around death, pain, \nand blood. Its dark like my soul \u2764\ufe0f\ufeff",

Even though math was \nvery easy to me, 9-10s through the semester and ahead of most of the class, \nI forget all the formulas and such very quickly even after studying for 2 \nhours in class.\nAsk me a question I did a million times and 1 hour later I will have \nforgotten the formula for it.\n\nThat's all math is: Studying. - You learn a new formula, and then you apply \nit enough times until you learn it.\nThen comes the next part of doing it over and over and remembering it.\nThe remembering part is the part that never sticks for me.\n\nIf I didn't study extensively for my tests, I would fluke on almost \neverything, because I unfortunately don't have the kind of memory you do.\nI wish I did, though. Then I wouldn't have to study jackshit for tests and \njust breeze through everything. It would be very relaxing.\nBut unfortunately that's not something I can enjoy.",
