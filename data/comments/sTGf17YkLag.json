Don't really \nneed a specific theme, just a different design.  I always find myself, out \nof habbit, returning to the cave section.\n\n-Final Brawl Times: I am *NOT* a fan of 1 minute brawls.  It is not enough \ntime to display all the stats that I have collected.  Here's what I would \nchange:  no time limit on stock brawls, 2 minute on timed brawls, two stock \non \"Glorious Smash.\"\n\n-Some franchises have more enemies:  I like the number and variety from \nMario/Kirby/LoZ/KI.  But I think maybe Metroid/DK/Earthbound/Pikmin could \nhave benefited from more enemies.  I don't know the franchises well enough \nto list off specifics, but if it was too hard to narrow down without flat \nout copying, I understand.\n\n-Need Moar Koffings:  This is just bias.  Seriously, I love that toxic \ngoofball.  :3",

Yes, you could interfere with enemies getting all the \npowerups, and you could KO them.  But enemies already add enough difficulty \nto do that.  Plus, all interaction is saved for the final brawl (I'll touch \non this later)\n\n-Enemies/FInal events:  This is personal taste for the former, so not much \nto say.  But for both, I like the randomness.  I can win a jump race with \nGanondorf/Mac or a speed race with DK.  Just comes down to how bad the luck \nof the AI is vs. your own.  Just comes down to skill at that point.  Defeat \nas many enemies mode is a good addition, at least it's action.  But I must \nstress:  BEWARE PARASOL DEE ARMY!  XD\n\n-No online:  This one is where I'll be blunt; Smash Run would be HORRIBLE \nonline with the time length to consider.  Why?  People play with bad \nconnections.  The result?  Lag.  I don't know about you, but I don't want \nto play a game either waiting for someone's connection to stabilize or for \nsomeone to finish their run.  Now I know what you're thinking:  Time could \nbe lower, right?  Still have the connection to deal with, plus a short time \nisn't alot to explore as far as possible/get as many powerups as possible.\n\nI think that Smash Run is great for what it is, but there are ways that it \ncould have been better:  I'll make a different comment for it.",

Not to mention the fact that most of these \npeople have only just got into smash competitively, and with the ignorance \nof mechanics I mentioned before, think they are these beacons of \ncompetitive gaming knowledge. \n\nThere is quite literally nothing you or I could ever say that would make \n95% of these people think any differently, because they don't understand, \nnor care to understand what the core physics, and mechanics of the games \nreally are. Whats funny about all of this is that Brawl and Sm4sh owe all \ntheir dregs of hype to Melee. A game in which its competitive fans have \ngrass rooted tournaments for 14 years, developed an ever evolving meta, \ndiscovering new and deep tech that allows for more options, and have been \nshat on by Nintendo the whole time. \n\nIt's so ironic that people hate on Melee so much when their competitive \nscenes are suckling from Melee born tournament culture. I don't honestly \ncare if people enjoy Smash Wii U on a personal \"I enjoy playing derpy with \nitems on, in rng infested stages with my friends\" thats fine, all the power \nto you, but it annoys the crap out of me that people think they suddenly \ncan jump in the middle of the scene and act like they just know it all \nbecause they are local champs, and beat all their friends.",

In ssb wii u \n, 11 fighters of the 49 were secret .Thes custom powers and the stages \nbuilder in wii u arent too \"Awesome\" as i expected .Smash tour is funny , \nbut not more than adventure mode .In One month i unlocked all secret \ncharacters , secret stages 400 trophies and custom powers.On the other \nhand. Now im boring about that . In the other hand , i spend two years \nplaying adventure mode , or event mode. Wii u version has event mode too , \nbut  in my opinion  , this isnt so good.",

Forget I used that word, it's not really relevant to \nwhat I was writing since that's another topic altogether and pretend I just \nwrote competitive.\n\nI did say that if your experience differed, I would respect that, though \nI'd say those people aren't really that competitive, they just are \ncompetitive wannabees.\n\nBy being so close, I didn't mean in terms of non-hazarded stages. I meant \nOmega was so close to the right thought process. Sakurai had the right idea \nand was doing his best to please us, he just went about it the wrong way. \nAnd a LOT of the stages in this game aren't viable for competitive play, \nbetween being too large, walkoffs, or having plenty of non-boss hazards to \nget in the way. Most of the stages are out of the question for competitive \nplay. Builder won't even be considered for a variety of reasons, biggest \nbeing that it's not the kind of stage one can prepare for combat on, since \nin a tournament setting, it will likely be the first time one of the \nplayers is ever seeing that stage. Again, the options are limited. You \ncan't do something like Wily's Castle's moving platforms in builder.\n\nI think you aren't understanding what my complaint really is. It's not so \nmuch that the stages are gimmicky, it's that Sakurai came up with the wrong \nsolution to gimmicks. Omega mode was an idea that he thought would solve \nthe problem, but it wasn't. How is that not valid?",

Dude, you've \nalready got plenty of hazard-less, not counting the infinite possibilities \nof the Builder, stages to choose from! Ignore Omega mode, fine.

Would a hazard switch have hurt you? Are \nyou honestly against one? You haven't disagreed with my opinion so much as \nyou have told me to just shut up, which isn't the same thing.\n\nI've said in other comments (and if I haven't said it on this specific \nconversation, I'll say it now), I play casually and will enjoy the Devil \nthen. I appreciate Sakurai trying to appeal to the hardcore players with \nOmega mode, even if it wasn't the right way to do that.

Good characters goes for everyone, not just competitive \nplayers. People don't really care too much about Doc. Mewtwo got pretty \nmuch everyone hyped. For Glory mode is a bit of a disappointment, because \nit gives a false portrayal of competitive players (no items, fox only, \nfinal destination). Omega stages are literally just Final destination, once \nagain giving a false portrayal of the competitive community. The funny \nthing is, with the counter pick system in tournaments (Winner of previous \nmatch bans one stage choice, or however many in the Wii U version, Loser \npicks the next stage, and you are not allowed to counter pick any stage you \nhave won on in that set), Final Destination and all Omega forms are put as \none stage (because they are basically the same stage), meaning that you \nonly get to use Omega forms once per set. And Gamecube controllers were for \npretty much everyone, as plenty of people who played Melee (casuals and \ncompetitives alike) used Gamecube controllers in Brawl, so naturally, those \npeople would want to use a gamecube controller. And in the end, while it is \na bit disappointing to not have the option to just turn stage hazards off, \nthe fact that a few stages have bosses doesn't make us hate the game. I \nmean, Melee only has six tournament legal stages (Final Destination, \nBattlefield, Yoshi's Story, Dreamland 64, Fountain of Dreams, and Pokemon \nStadium).",

Give this person a cookie because they actually get it. \nAdventure mode and the Subspace Emissary were really lame and unnecessary \nplatforming challenges interlaced with pseudo combat and cutscenes.\n\nSmash Bros. was never really meant to be any kind of Single Player \nexperience. From the beginning, and throughout every iteration, Sakurai has \nfully intended for it to be a multiplayer party game. Even if you don't \ntreat it that way, like if you play Smash in a more hardcore manner like \ncompetitively, then still, it's a fighting game, which in its very nature, \nrequires multiplayer.\nSure, Subspace was a ~nice~ addition, I guess. But it was very hollow and \nlacking depth, and lacked true challenge or variety or incentive beyond, \n\"Oh boy I can't wait to see the next cutscene!\" But even beyond that, \nSakurai already expressed his disapproval of making another thing like it \nbecause all those cutscenes just get spoiled onto the internet, so you \ndon't even have to play through it to see them, and now your only incentive \nfor playing it is arbitrary intrinsic challenge, like speed runs or \nclearing on hard mode. Otherwise, it's something most players beat once or \ntwice and never come back to again, because there's no point. It was just a \nvery long mediocre platforming course interspersed with cutscenes and light \neaster eggs. \nModes like Smash Run and Smash Tour on the other hand completely and \ntotally embody Sakurai's goals with this iteration. Smash Run lends itself \nwell to bite sized rounds of Chaotic Smash Bros play well suited for a \nmobile experience. Smash Tour on the other hand, not unlike Mario Party, is \nperfect for a handful of friends to sit down at home and play a round or \ntwo of equally chaotic Smash. And BOTH have a lot of replay value, \nespecially in comparison with Subspace Emissary.\nParty play. Multiplayer. Chaos. You want a mechanically varied and \ntechnically replete platformer story thing, Smash Bros is not the place for \nit.",

Only Dedede really did anything stupidly unbalanced with \nthat moving platform, it kinda helped balance for most other matchups!\n\nI wouldn't expect every stage to become legal from a hazard switch (the DK \nstage being a perfect example - not really a hazard, but still something \nthat could never be used.) If they went with a general \"if it hurts you, it \ncan be turned off\" mindset, that would solve most of my stage gripes. Stage \ntransformations are another story. Some work just fine (the first two parts \nof Paper Mario), but some are just awful (the 3rd part).

Then there's the \naforementioned reasoning of whether the dynamic versions would be neglected.\n\nIf I had to guess, a stage hazard toggle would entail more than just the \nhazards getting removed, but also every single dynamic element to them, \nlike moving platforms and backgrounds, as well as unique features such as \ndual-planes and hidden rooms like in Tomodachi Life. There would be a cost \nto using the hazardless versions of stages, so you can't get the full \nexperience on them.\n\nThere's always been a small (pretty much exclusively from the competitive \ncrowd) section of fans who complain about the hazards in every single Smash \ngame.

Not buying this \ngame!\" And I see what you are trying to say about the philosphy, but I \ndisagree. Without the hazards, suddenly those stages can be used in an \nenvironment that supports the deepest and most complex fighter ever made.\n\nI could tell you had a beef with competitive players. Look, the game still \nhas plenty to make it stand apart. No other game has spacing and mindgames \nand combos quite like Smash Bros. It's still incredibly unique, even \nwithout items or hazards, it just becomes more controlled and less based \naround chance. The creators are under no obligation to please them, but IF \nthey want to, that's what they have to do, and that's all I've been saying. \nDo you agree with that, or are you going to just argue for the sake of \narguing?\n\nA complaint isn't invalid for something like that. If it's a feature that \nsomeone wanted to see, it's perfectly valid for them to complain that it's \nmissing, especially if the hazards are as large and intrusive as some in \nSSB4. This isn't only a competitive thing. I don't know what your \nexperience with other people in this game is, but of the casuals I know, a \nvery good chunk of them want to turn off bosses.

Smash run was really fun, \nand it was great to see a call back to City Trial, overall the mode was way \nto lacking to keep playing (I only play it once in a while now). Unlike \nCity Trial, Smash run does not give you the options to change the amount of \ntime, there is no free play of either the main map or the special smash \nmodes, and there is no online. All of these missing features just ruin \nSmash Run, limiting it in too many ways. I can see the same happening with \nSmash tour. While it does look like a lot of fun, and the final smash where \nyou fight with characters as your stocks is amazing, there are too many \nlimitations to it as well. For one, it looks like you'll have to play it \nlike six or seven times to get a good grasp on all the rules. Second, there \nis no online play, from what I've heard",

People have been rather vocal about that thing \nlately, I'm surprised the developer didn't think to take that little extra \nstep (relatively speaking) to give us that option.\n\nI will enjoy the game no problem as I am among the more lenient players \nwhen it comes to smash, but I don't like the idea of people getting \nshortchanged, if you see what I mean",
