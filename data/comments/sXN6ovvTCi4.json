When its late in the 24-hour period that you \nstarted to not sleep, you get to feel very tired. However, around the \n36-hour mark, when you would usually be waking up or already awake, our \nbrains send out the same 'refreshed, energized' feelings you would feel \nwhen having gone through sleep.\n\nIn a shorter, less jarbled way of saying it, our brains have naturally done \nto themselves what Pavlov did to his dogs.\n\nhttp://psychology.about.com/od/classicalconditioning/a/pavlovs-dogs.htm",
