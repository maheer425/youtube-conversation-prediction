If you don't like being called a beggar then don't beg. A \nbeggar isn't demanding it is someone who is asking for something.... A \nmugger is someone who is demanding something.... And you sir are a mugger, \ndemanding something from everyone or else... When you pull your smug head \nout of your ass, then maybe I will reconsider ever watching your videos \nagain, until then you will continue to walk over people and crumble slowly \nbut steadily into irrelevancy just as you deem those who criticize you and \nmake you money by watching your content.",
