Who else will help us through the music to feel \nsome joy in our religion ... breake our saddness and fears ... Please, \nHillsong, let her sing and dance more this style of songs, there are too \nmany of others (ballades and moderate rhytm christian worship). Her \nballades I don't find so great like this style. WE NEED THIS ENERGY AND \nMOTIVATION. Please, don't take it from your fans ... while this singer is \nstill young and full of energy. She will have more than 50 years in her \nlife to sing ballades, let her sing this kind of worship songs NOW! Please \n... \ufeff",

But lately my faith has been \nfaltering and I'm asking anybody here if is a normal phase. People at my \nchurch have been saying it is but it has been going on since the end of 6th \ngrade. I go to revivals and retreats to restore my faith in the one and \nonly God but I only feel it for as long as the retreat goes. So is it a \nnormal thing? I really do hope it is because after this phase I will know \nthat the one and only God loves me to no extent. Please reply!!! I am \nreally worried\ufeff",

Speaking from experience. \n Hope this helps :) I was in your shoes when i was around your age.

Do not wait for these retreats and \nrevivals for a better understanding of Him. Yes they do help, but that is \nnot the only option. Develop a personal relationship with Him. In any \nrelationship you have with a person and you want to know him/her better, do \nyou just speak to that person every couple months or so? I know I don't. I \ntry to ask questions, and speak to them as often as I can. Your personal \nrelationship with God will grow stronger and stronger if you talk to Him \ndaily and spend time with Him daily by praying and reading His Word. Though \nHe already knows all about you, don't you want to know more about who He \nis? I have been a Christian for the past five years and grew up in church \nalso, but God still reveals more about Himself to I never knew before. Hope \nthis helps! God Bless and I'll be praying for you! :)",

Before any of you accuse me of being \natheist or Buddhist and what not, I play guitar for my church so I do know \na thing or two about worship music. I've been a Christian for all of my \nlife as well. \n\nAnyways, some concerns that I have relate to the songs that hillsong y & f \nplays. From what I can gather, all of the songs in the album are \nfast-paced, exciting songs that really motivate me to worship God. While \nthose songs may seem appealing to non-Christians, I don't think this theme \nwill strengthen their relationship with God.Hillsong United and hillsong \nlive plays the fast-tempo songs (ex: Go, Run, No reason to hide), but also \nthe quiet, touching ones like forever reign and cornerstone. In my opinion, \nsongs like the two mentioned above are what really makes me feel the holy \nspirit. Since the songs that this group plays are in an light atmosphere \nwith the focus on praising God for fun, I dont see these songs touching \nhearts in the way that other hillsong divisions do.\n\nThis may be intended by Hillsong church, to bring people in through young \nand free and eventually lead them to the deep, spiritual Hillsong United \nand Live groups. Before all of you start hating on the people saying that y \n& f is bad, take a moment to realize that y & f are actually, in different \ncategories than United and Live. Sure, they all praise God, but in \ndifferent levels. Some people want more spiritual songs that United and \nLive give, and less of the songs influenced by the worldly values that y & \nf offer. \n\nI may be alone in thinking this. I hope not.\ufeff",

They are not dancing because the holy spirit is in them \nbut because they do it out of emotion. This type of worshiping is very \nclose to the world's dancing. They might as well go to a party because \nthat's exactly how people dance at parties. Romans 12:1 \"And be not \nconformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your \nmind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, \nwill of God. \"    We are supposed to use Jesus as an example and I'm pretty \nsure you wouldn't find Jesus dancing like this. 1 Peter 2:21  \"For to this \nyou have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an \nexample, so that you might follow in his steps.\"   You can see people in \nthis video taking their shirts off and making the rock sign with their \nhands.  It's hard to notice because the video goes by fast but if you pay \nclose attention you'll see it. I'm not judging the song, but the dancing \nhas to go. That's definitely not the Holy Spirit. My sister, who is't even \na Christian, said \"Umm you call that Christian?\" Churches these days are \nbeing fooled into believing that this type of dancing is acceptable. The \nHoly spirit is what guides us and this is far from the Holy Spirit.\n God Bless you all. \ufeff",

We could \nhelp this by continually being in worship and not on a once a year camp \nhigh that dies off in the ensuing weeks and months.

I've seen \npeople dance w/o music, while praying, and nothing else... just very \nintense prayer!  Just because others worship in a different way than you \nand I doesn't mean that they aren't worshipping God.  I'm not the type of \nperson that would label himself as charismatic, but I appreciate that God \nhas formed us ALL in his likeness. The way we worship may be slightly \ndifferent, but if our reason of being and living is to exalt the name of \nJesus, then I'm sure God sees that and that isn't something that can be \nseen through this video as many of you suggest.\n\nAdditionally...\nIsaiah 29:13-The Lord says: \"These people come near to me with their mouth \nand honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their \nworship of me is made up only of rules taught by men.\"  This seems to \nsuggest that worship shouldn't be based on rules but instead on the \nboundless grace of God,  something that we see throughout David's worship.\n\n\nPsalm 29\n2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the \nsplendor of his holiness. 3 The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the \nGod of glory thunders, the LORD thunders over the mighty waters. 4 The \nvoice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic. 5 The \nvoice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars \nof Lebanon. 6 He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, Sirion like a young wild \nox. 7 The voice of the LORD strikes with flashes of lightning. 8 The voice \nof the LORD shakes the desert; the LORD shakes the Desert of Kadesh. 9 The \nvoice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his \ntemple all cry, \"Glory!\"\n\nNow if the voice of the Lord does that... can you imagine what the Holy \nSpirit can do in us who have the Spirit of the Lord WITHIN US?!?!",

What even IS \nspirituality, and who cares? God knows your heart. We shouldn't be so \nconcerned with \"how\" other people worship. See 2 Samuel 6:16. King David \nleaped and danced foolishly before the Lord and an onlooker despised him in \nher heart. \n\nI understand that you get into a way of thinking depending on the type of \nchurch you grow up in, or what you were told. But when you really think \nabout it, how can you really speak for God and a bunch of strangers you \ndon't know?  You can't say what is or is not spiritual, or how to \n\"correctly\" worship. Worship comes in many forms, and quite honestly I have \npartied for God and had fun while doing it! And it changed me and made me \ncloser to Him. A few jumps here and there and it is suddenly unspiritual? \nWell honestly I would rather be unspiritual and worship God any way I can \nthan be spiritual and worship God only one way because man said so!\ufeff",

In \na society where people are told not to judge, it's easy to question people \nas being old fashioned for questioning the things some churches do! But \neven Peter, a disciple of Jesus himself, was reprimanded by Paul for his \nbehavior! If even an apostle could make mistakes, what more a man who has \nnever met Jesus! By the way I apologize for saying this song is not a \nworship song. Paul said everything is permitable and it was wrong of me to \ncriticize it as such. Paul however did say that not everything is \nbeneficial. In that case, as mature Christians, I think it's time we start \nquestioning our faith in a way that draws us closer to God. Instead of \nlistening to stories of a God of love, read more about the wraith of God \nand you will understand why discernment and questioning the church is \nimportant.

The instrument they \nuse definitely does not make the song carnal. What I would like to point \nout is that if the message was perverted the song would be carnal, but \nsince Young and Free are singing about the holy spirit coming through them \n(or as they say waking within them) this therefore keeps the song \nChristian. Also just because the Jews didn't dance back in the days of the \nBible, that doesn't mean that we can't either. There were many things that \nthe Jews did that Jesus was not happy with making them not the perfect role \nmodel. +Mike Allison Moving to your point about the tambourine being the \ninstrument to use, there is nothing in scripture saying that the only \ninstruments that are worthy to be used are the ones available to the Jews \nat that given period in time, so why should we believe that? To do so is \nextremely legalistic. +Daniel Ogden To say that the song makes Christians \nno different from non-Christians is like saying that playing Minecraft \n(which thousands of non-Christians and Christians play including you and I) \nmakes you the same as a non-Christian. Literally no other secular songs \nsing about the holy spirit waking in them, so that should differentiate the \ntwo parties enough. If the melody of the song is too much for you, then \nthat is when it should be compared to my above example. +Ethan Loo Then are \nyou saying we should chant like monks when we worship God? Give me an \nexample other than monk chants that fits this worship limitation.\n\nAll in all guys, I don't think that we should really waste our time arguing \nwith each other about something so small as this when there are much more \nbeneficial things we can be doing (and if you are that guy who is about to \nsay I joined in the debate too, I was just trying to clear everything up \nfor everyone and spread the truth). God doesn't want to make it unenjoyable \nfor us to worship him and we sure love worshiping him more when it is fun \nto do so (like if you have a favorite song at church, it is more fun when \nyou sing that song).",

                "text": "@Tima Gearheart\n\nGreat analysis!!! This is exactly the kind of thing I am talking about.\nHillsong music is becoming less and less about the Gospel and Biblical \naccuracy while becoming more and more catered towards \"mainstream.\"\n\nWake within Me, as Tima points out, is a great example of this (with the \nbeats and all).\nI'm not saying that this type of music is definitely wrong, but look at it \nthis way...\nA pastor is called to preach the Gospel. Many pastors today, however, try \nto preach topics. While topical preaching isn't necessarily bad, the focus \nshould be expository. You ALWAYS want to root it back to the Cross. \nWhatever form worship/praise takes, you ALWAYS want to root it back to the \nGospel.\n\nThis song, as Hillsong music has been of late, does not accomplish this. To \nsome this may seem to be over critical... but we need to be (not over \ncritical but very wary) or such changes. We often utilize \"progression\" in \nthe wrong sense. Instead of building upon the traditions of Christianity, \nwe completely knock down the foundations build throughout the years, \nconstruct our own, then call it \"progress.\"\ufeff",

To utilize what was the popular type of music and apply faith \ncentered messages to that genre. If every single christian song had the \nsame format they would become dry and repetitive. Even older Hillsong music \nhad this issue. On \"United We Stand\" a lot of the songs had the same chord \nprogressions and basis. I feel refreshed whilst listening to this because I \nknow there is a different audience that can be reached with this style. If \nyou listen to the whole album, there are plenty of slower songs that still \nbring back memories of Aftermath and even Look to You. There has to be \ndiversity or else you become stereotypical and that is exactly what drives \npeople away. Ecclesiastes 3:1 says \"for everything there is a season, and a \ntime for every matter under Heaven\" I feel as if this is a new season in \nworship, a time where the lost are found and new hearts are touched, not \nonly in our nation, but at all corners of the Earth and this is a vessel we \nare using to reach those hearts. I am happy for what Hillsong Young & Free \nis doing with this new direction and I am excited to see how God moves \nthrough this team of individuals.",

God help us all!\n\n she might as well be just singing a love song to her boyfriend as far as \nI'm concerned. i'm surprised miley cyrus didn't swing onto stage on a \nwrecking ball. the song's great, but the reality of certain elements of the \ngoings-on's of the christian pop music concert scene reflected in this \nvideo is disheartening and induced a pain of sorrow in my side!  \ufeff",

God looks at the heart. \"But the \nLord said to Samuel, \u201cDo not look at his appearance or at his physical \nstature, because I have refused him. For the Lord does not see as man sees; \nfor man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\u201d \n-1 Samuel 16:7",

I'm sure they've won many hearts over to Jesus because some of \nthose kids initially were just attracted to the sound of the music, the way \nit looks, or the energy of the performance. Some of those kids wouldn't \nhave gone to that summer camp if it didn't sound \"cool\", and I'm sure their \nfriends were like \"trust me, you're gonna love it!\" and then the message \nstarted seeping into their head and they came face to face with the gospel \nand accepted Jesus into their hearts. Think of it this way: a wife drags \nher non-church-going husband to church on potluck Sunday, and the Lord \nstarts working on his heart, and eventually he accepts Jesus as his lord \nand saviour. He didn't come there for the right reasons. He came there for \nthe food, and for his wife. But God won him over through that. It doesn't \nmatter if people listen to the message for the right reasons, so long as \nthey hear the message. (Btw, true story- my dad.)\n\nAnd there's a HUGE difference between looking like a model while retaining \nmodesty and looking like a stripper. That's a different kind of attraction \nthey are selling. This is not even comparable to Nicki Minaj, Beyonce, or \nMadonna. (That list goes on and on and on.) They picked this chick for her \nvoice, she just happened to look amazing too. Ever heard of Mandisa? She \ndoesn't look like a model, but she also sings about Jesus. And is \nsuccessful!\n\nMuch love xX",
