Okay, \nit's not slavery then. \"Break it down to a case by case situation\"? What \ndoes that even mean? Even if it's true that someone's livelihood depends on \ntheir job, whose fault is that other than their own? You seem to be denying \nthe personal agency people have to not only leave their jobs, but to adapt \ntheir lifestyles and pursue alternative careers. Sorry, but capitalism can \nnever equal slavery because by definition capitalism depends on the \nVOLUNTARY exchange of goods and services. You might want to give up on that \nfailed premise.\n\nOh I see. So not all humans are bad? Just some of them? Can you please \noffer up a solution for determining which ones are good and can regulate \nothers, and which ones are bad to keep out of the regulatory process? The \ncurrent system seems to accomplish the exact opposite by promoting the \nworst possible humans to the regulatory positions and giving them \nwidespread and intrusive power into the lives of others.\n\nFinally you say something intelligent.

Best \nof my knowlage he didn't even sniff a courtroom for that.\nSo, capitalism is good but it needs regulating (or the humans need \nregulating if thats how you want to look at it). The problem here is we \nhave a govt. thats bought and paid for ON BOTH SIDES, by coorperate \namerica, and that has to stop!",

You\u2019re \nspeaking about the structure of businesses directly as if the laws of the \nland did not apply to them. This does not reflect reality.\n\nIt seems as though you do not understand the philosophy behind voluntarism \nor anarcho-capitalism which I find hard to believe since the names are \npretty self evident. If a voluntarist community agrees a certain section of \nland is not privately owned, and no coercion is involved in stealing it \naway from someone, then this does not go against the principles of \nanarcho-capitalism/libertarianism/voluntarism. How is that a double \nstandard?\n\nThe irony in your paragraph on IFIs is behind belief. Do you have any idea \nhow these organizations work? It is literally the antithesis of the free \nmarket yet you are using it as an example of free market capitalism. \nForcing a developing country to import government subsidized products from \nthe US is not capitalism. I refuse to believe that you cannot grasp this \nsimple concept.\n\nAgain, you are confusing theoretical voluntary capitalism with modern neo \nliberal crony capitalism.

I'll move on to your justifications \nwithin your argument.\nTo when communism has never existed within centralized authority -  but by \nthe predicating growth of stalinization with economic policies, these were \nthe few outlets that deteriorated the growth of the Soviet Union. Now \nwithin the contradictions of Stalinism, the 'state' terror, \nauthoritarianism, rapid industrialization and rapid collectivisation over \nagriculture, it is determined by how they organized with the bases of the \nmeans of production and the relations of productions within classes of \nsociety. Rapid production needs an organization of specializing the \nworkplace and establishing hierarchies and coercion within also abiding to \nwhat is needed for capital interests. Privatization in Nazi Germany was \nalso unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public \nservices previously provided by government. The firms and the services \ntransferred to private ownership belonged to diverse sectors. Privatization \nwas part of an intentional policy with multiple objectives and was not \nideologically driven. Now with the soviet union it also took a notch within \neconomic policies after Stalin's death, yet again - through on the \ncontinuation of the soviet union, they did not ideologically drive into the \ncapacities of human beings within this stage. Of course, I predicted to \nmyself the same sentimental, schmaltzy of the anarcho-capitalist. When you \nput into theoretical contextualization into political discussion over the \npractises of this ideology.  \n\nWhat you're doing now is just adding in communist aims of a society, \ncommunalising property and calling it capitalism. Do you not realise the \nfucking double standard of your argument there? It's calling it \n'capitalism' and adding anarchist/communist aims within the pre-determined, \nthickness of voluntarists and capitalists.\n\n The IMF, the World Bank, and the world trade organization shoved free \nmarket capitalism into the throats of developing countries, and \nderegulating and opening their markets is bad. Within the economic \ndevelopment of the neo liberal recipe - Latin America per capita income \ngrew 3.1% in 1960s to 70s, whilst in 1080s to 2009 only grew by 1.1% during \nthat time period.

Decentralized \nplanning and ad-hoc systems are all around. I just copied a pattern of \nthought. \nBasic idea: We have ipv6 already written aka 2 to the power of 128 ips \n(basically unlimited). think about it this way, if we would change the code \nso as gateways are setup ad-hoc, not needing a central authority to \ndispatch ips, pretty much like bitcoin, like you boot up your wifi router \nand it finds others and politely asks to join them, then all the wifi \nrouters using this protocol would wire themselves randomly and you would \nnot know what router you are connected to or you would be connect to many \nwhich instead would connect to others and so on. Your connections would \nreach the destination using all possible routes at once. How can you sniff \nthat when all you receive are sparse packets, probably not even in the \nright order if any? Need more net? buy more routers and spread them around. \nThey would not be in your possession but rather a common shared resource \nwhich would only require electricity. If one of them would try to get the \nidentity of another, it would just get rejected by the others because of \nthe negotiation algorithm. See how bitcoin works to figure out how to \ndistribute IPs/IP ranges uniquely and without theft/impersonation. you \ncould have roaming, aka bye bye gsm and your communications would be hard \nif not impossible to spy on, even when unencrypted (unless the bastard has \nyou wired). It's not scifi, it's doable at least on a citywide level and \nthe speeds would be unbelievably faster then what we have today. Plus it \nworks in parallel with what we have today. You would not even know which \nline you're using, say for the speed improvement.\nI want to start working on this after I finish my current project which is \njust as important but if someone is nice enough to do it, be my guest. It's \na cool project and you would get more infamous then Steve Jobs as the man \nwho put a stop to censorship, completely replaced GSM and made internet \nun-taxable, and as accessible as a chat with your friends.\ufeff",

Say that u have a net with 4 nodes which one would be u. Then u \nhave x possible routes for the packet. So 1-4,1-3,1-2,........4-3 so x \n*1000 mb/s so 10 nodes 10gb/s ideally. Since this means all sending one \npacket through a route that ain't used by others.

This isn't the 1800s were riots can cause havoc and overthrow \ngovernments in the promise of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Technology \nisn't longer so simple that peasants can grab a gun or pike and fight. The \nU.S would use ww2 and ww1 abominations to quell the revolt. And they don't \nnecessarily have to kill, simply to cause terrific pain. Gases, \nelectricity, internment camps, the amount that the police force has been \nmilitarised is incredible. But you want real revolution don't you? You want \nguns and steel, and blood and fire, a vehement stance like in Spain no? \nThen quite frankly they would blow you up, simply because population does \nnot matter. Let me repeat that, population does not matter, all that \nmatters is whoever is technologically superior. Don't believe me, then look \nat how the japanese conquered China. Japan had about, if memory serves \ncorrectly, 1/6 the population of China, yet China was almost conquered. Not \nbecause the Japanese had more soldiers, because Japan had military \nsuperiority. I would use the classic 300 (and about 1,000 greeks) example, \nbut it's been used to death. So please, disabuse yourself of that dangerous \nthought of revolution. They rarely yield what they promised to give, a \nrevolution against control can quickly, and has often, become a revolution \nfor control. The best way to do it, to change the system, is in a civil \nmanner. I think you know where to go. wolf-pac.com ",
