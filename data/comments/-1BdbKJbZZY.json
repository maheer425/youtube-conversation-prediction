                "text": "Okay..we need to clear up something. The LDS church is NOT a works-alone \nbased religion. We know that no matter how much we do on our own, it will \nnever be enough to get us to heaven. Only the grace of Jesus Christ can do \nthat. However, good works does play a part in our salvation. We know from \nthe bible that part of our salvation is having faith in Jesus Christ. But \naccording to James in the Bible, our faith alone can't save us.\n\nConsider this from James 2, 15-17: \"What doth it profit, my brethren, \nthough a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? If \na brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, And one of you \nsay unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye \ngive them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it \nprofit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\"\n\nAnyone who has read the Bible knows that Jesus encourages us to perform \ngood works. That being said, LDS know that those good works alone will not \nsave us.\n\nConsider this from the Book of Mormon, Mosiah 2:21: \"I say unto you that if \nye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is \npreserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and \nmove and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one \nmoment to another\u2014I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls \nyet ye would be unprofitable servants.\" This essentially echoes my quote \nfrom James in the Bible. Faith without works is dead, being alone. \n\nWorks alone will not get us to heaven; neither will faith alone. It takes \nBOTH. We prove our truth faith in Jesus Christ by doing good works for Him, \nand when we fall short--and we will fall short--grace is there to take us \nthe rest of the way.\n\nThat's how it works.\ufeff",

In the law which \nwas given unto them, of which they boasted, and pretended to understand, \nand interpret, even in Psalm 82:6; for the law includes not only the \nPentateuch, but all the books of the Old Testament: it is an observation of \none of the Jewish doctors (t), that\n\"with the wise men of blessed memory, it is found in many places that the \nword law comprehends the Prophets and the Hagiographa.''\n\nAmong which last stands the book of Psalms; and this may be confirmed by a \npassage out of the Talmud (u); it is asked,\n\n\"from whence does the resurrection of the dead appear, , \"out of the law?\"''\n\nIt is answered,\n\n\"as it is said in Psalm 84:4, \"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, \nthey will still praise thee, Selah; they do praise thee\", it is not said, \nbut \"they will praise thee\"; from hence is a proof of the resurrection of \nthe dead, \"out of the law\".''\n\nThe same question is again put, and then Isaiah 52:8 is cited, and the like \nobservation made upon it. Moreover, this is a way of speaking used by the \nJews, when they introduce another citing a passage of Scripture thus (w), , \n\"is it not written in your law\", Deuteronomy 4:9, \"only take heed to \nthyself\", &c. so here the Scripture follows,\n\nI said, ye are gods? which is spoken to civil magistrates, so called, \nbecause of their authority and power; and because they do, in some sort, \nrepresent the divine majesty, in the government of nations and kingdoms. \nMany of the Jewish writers, by \"gods\", understand \"the angels\". The Targum \nparaphrases the words thus:\n\n\"I said ye are accounted as angels, as the angels on high, all of you;''\n\nand to this sense some of their commentators interpret it. Jarchi's gloss \nis, ye are gods; that is, angels; for when I gave the law to you, it was on \nthis account, that the angel of death might not any more rule over you: the \nnote of Aben Ezra is, \"and the children of the Most High\": as angels; and \nthe sense is, your soul is as the soul of angels: hence the (x) Jew charges \nChrist with seeking refuge in words, that will not profit, or be any help \nto him, when he cites these words, showing that magistrates are called \ngods, when the sense is only, that they are like to the angels in respect \nof their souls: but let it be observed, that it is not said, \"ye are as \ngods\", as in Genesis 3:5, but \"ye are gods\"; not like unto them only, but \nare in some sense gods; and besides, to say that they are like to angels, \nwith respect to their souls, which come from above, is to say no more of \nthe judges of the earth, than what may be said of every man: to which may \nbe added, that this objector himself owns, that judges are called \"gods\", \nas in Exodus 22:9; the cause of both parties shall come before \"the \njudges\"; and that even the word is used in this sense in this very psalm, \nfrom whence these words are cited, Psalm 82:1, \"he judgeth among\" \"the \ngods\"; and both Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret this text itself in the \nsame way, and observe, that judges are called gods, when they judge truly \nand aright: all which is sufficient to justify our Lord in the citation of \nthis passage, and the use he makes of it.\n\n(t) R. Azarias in Meor Enayim, c. 7. fol. 47. 1.((u) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, \nfol. 91. 2.((w) T. Bab. Beracot, fol. 32. 2.((x) R. Isaac Chizzuk Emuna, \npar. 2. c. 51. p. 440, 441.\n\nJohn 10:35\nIf he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture \ncannot be broken;\nIf he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came,.... The Syriac \nversion reads, \"because the word of God came to them\"; either the divine \n\"Logos\", the essential word, the Son of God, who appeared to Moses, and \nmade him a God to Pharaoh, and who appointed rulers and magistrates among \nthe Jews; and who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, from whom all \nreceive their power and dominion: this sense is favoured by the Ethiopic \nversion, which renders it, \"if he called them gods to whom God appeared, \nthe word of God was with them\": or else the commission from God, \nauthorizing them to act in the capacity of rulers and governors, is here \nmeant; or rather the word of God, which, in the passage of Scripture cited, \ncalls them so, as it certainly does:\nand the Scripture cannot be broken; or be made null and void; whatever that \nsays is true, there is no contradicting it, or objecting to it: it is a \nJewish way of speaking, much used in the Talmud (y); when one doctor has \nproduced an argument, or instance, in any point of debate, another says, , \n\"it may be broken\"; or objected to, in such and such a manner, and be \nrefuted: but the Scripture cannot be broken, that is not to be objected to, \nthere can be no confutation of that.\n\n(y) T. Bab. Zebachim, fol. 4. 1. & Becorot, fol. 32. 1. & passim.\nAnd the Word became flesh & dwelt among them . John 1: 14\n\nJohn 1:13\nWhich were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the \nwill of man, but of God.\nWhich were born not of blood,.... Or bloods, in the plural number. The \nbirth, here spoken of, is regeneration, expressed by a being born again, or \nfrom above; by a being quickened by the Spirit and grace of God; by Christ \nbeing formed in men; and by a partaking of the divine nature; and by being \nmade new creatures, as all that believe in the name of Christ are; and \nwhich is the evidence of their being the sons of God: and now this is owing \nnot to blood, or bloods; not to the blood of circumcision; or of the \npassover, which the Jews had an high opinion of, and ascribe life and \nsalvation to, and to which notion this may be opposed: so their \ncommentators (f) on Ezekiel 16:6 where the word \"live\" is twice used, \nobserve on the first \"live\", by the blood of the passover, on the second \n\"live\", by the blood of circumcision; but, alas! these contribute nothing \nto the life of the new creature: nor is regeneration owing to the blood of \nancestors, to natural descent, as from Abraham, which the Jews valued \nthemselves upon; for sin, and not grace, is conveyed by natural generation: \nall men are of one blood, and that is tainted with sin, and therefore can \nnever have any influence on regeneration; no blood is to be valued, or any \none upon it, but the blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin,\nNor of the will of the flesh; man's free will, which is carnal and corrupt, \nis enmity to God, and impotent to every thing that is spiritually good: \nregeneration is ascribed to another will and power, even to the will and \npower of God, and denied of this:\n\nnor of the will of man: of the best of men, as Abraham, David, and others; \nwho, though ever so willing and desirous, that their children, relations, \nfriends, and servants, should be born again, be partakers of the grace of \nGod, and live in his sight, yet cannot effect any thing of this kind: all \nthat they can do is to pray for them, give advice, and bring them under the \nmeans of grace; but all is ineffectual without a divine energy. So with the \nJews, \"a man\", signifies a great man, in opposition to \"Adam\", or \"Enosh\", \nwhich signify a mean, weak, frail man; and our translators have observed \nthis distinction, in Isaiah 2:9 and the mean man (Adam) boweth down, and \nthe great man (Ish) \"humbleth himself\": on which Jarchi has this note, \n\"Adam boweth down\", i.e. little men; \"and a man humbleth himself\", i.e. \nprinces, and mighty men, men of power: and so Kimchi on Psalm 4:2. \"O ye \nsons of men\", observes, that the Psalmist calls them the sons of men, with \nrespect to the great men of Israel; for there were with Absalom the sons of \ngreat men. Though sometimes the Jews say (g), Adam is greater than any of \nthe names of men, as Geber, Enosh, Ish. But now our evangelist observes, \nlet a man be ever so great, or good, or eminent, for gifts and grace, he \ncannot communicate grace to another, or to whom he will; none are born \nagain of any such will:\n\nbut of God; of God, the Father of Christ, who begets to a lively hope; and \nof the Son, who quickens whom he will; and of the grace of the Spirit, to \nwhom regeneration is generally ascribed,\n\n(f) Jarchi & Kimchi in loc. Shemot Rabba, sect. 19. fol. 103. 2. & 104. 4. \n& Mattanot Cehuna in Vajikra Rabba, sect. 23. fol. 164. 2. Zohar in Lev. \nfol. 39. 2.((g) Zohar in Lev. fol. 20. 2.\nJohn 1:12\nBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of \nGod, even to them that believe on his name:\nBut as many as received him,.... This is explained, in the latter part of \nthe text, by believing in his name; for faith is a receiving him as the \nword, and Son of God, as the Messiah, Saviour, and Redeemer; a receiving \ngrace out of his fulness, and every blessing from him, as a justifying \nrighteousness, pardon of sin, and an inheritance among them that are \nsanctified; for though the generality rejected him, there were some few \nthat received him:\nto them gave he power to become the sons of God; as such were very early \ncalled, in distinction from the children of men, or of the world; see \nGenesis 6:2. To be the sons of God is a very special favour, a great \nblessing, and high honour: saints indeed are not in so high a sense the \nsons of God as Christ is; nor in so low a sense as angels and men in common \nare; nor in such sense as civil magistrates; nor merely by profession of \nreligion; much less by natural descent; but by adopting grace: and in this, \nChrist, the word, has a concern, as all the three divine persons have. The \nFather predestinated men to the adoption of children, secures this blessing \nfor them in the covenant of his grace, and puts them among the children, \nand assigns them a goodly heritage: the Spirit, and who is therefore called \nthe spirit of adoption, discovers and applies this blessing to them, and \nwitnesses to their spirits that they are the children of God: and Christ, \nthe word, or Son of God, not only espoused their persons, and in time \nassumed their nature, and by the redemption of them opened a way for their \nreception of the adoption of children; but actually bestows upon them the \n\"power\", as it is here called, of becoming the sons of God: by which is \nmeant, not a power of free will to make themselves the sons of God, if they \nwill make use of it; but it signifies the honour and dignity conferred on \nsuch persons: so Nonnus calls it, \"the heavenly honour\"; as indeed, what \ncan be a greater? It is more honourable than to be a son or daughter of the \ngreatest potentate on earth: and it is expressive of its being a privilege; \nfor so it is an undeserved and distinguishing one, and is attended with \nmany other privileges; for such are of God's household and family, and are \nprovided for by him; have liberty of access unto him; are Christ's free \nmen, and are heirs to an incorruptible inheritance. This is a privilege \nthat excels all others, even justification and remission of sins; and is an \neverlasting one: and it also intends the open right which believers have \nunto this privilege, and their claim of it: hence it follows,\n\neven to them that believe in his name; that is, in himself, in Christ, the \nword: the phrase is explanative of the former part of the verse, and is a \ndescriptive and manifestative character of the sons of God; for though the \nelect of God, by virtue of electing grace, and the covenant of grace, are \nthe children of God before faith; and were so considered in the gift of \nthem to Christ, and when he came into the world to gather them together, \nand save them; and so, antecedent to the Spirit of God, being sent down \ninto their hearts, to make this known to them; yet no man can know his \nadoption, nor enjoy the comfort of it, or claim his interest in it, until \nhe believes.\nSo Christ's \"theology\", is that HE gives us power to BECOME son's of GOD, a \ngift freely given, not that we are already \"spirit\" children of the MOST \nHIGH. LDS theology, has their god being an exalted man, yet SCRIPTURE \ncannot be changed or challenged, and it CLEARLY STATES, GOD is the same \nyesterday today and tomorrow, UNCHANGING. So you can't have it both ways, \neither JESUS IS, who he claimed, and we are NOT able to BECOME gods, or \nJESUS was wrong and there is no need to worry because it's all a lie. I \nchoose to believe JESUS, that THROUGH HIM we may become\nsons of GOD, but we are obviously not already son's of GOD, even in the \nspirit. THUS JESUS TAUGHT, \"YOU MUST BE BORN OF WATER AND OF SPIRIT, to \nenter the KINGDOM OF GOD. Liljoe clearly DID NOT understand the teaching, \nand took it upon himself to \"establish\" a new gospel and a new covenant. \nWhen this is EXACTLY WHY CHRIST CAME< TO FULFILL THE OLD COVENANT< THE \nLAW<and give mankind a pathway to GOD, we need no further instruction...nor \na new and \"different\" gospel....JESUS establishes the FINAL COVENANT \nbetween man and GOD.",

In this official statement the North and South American Indians \nare clearly identified as the descendants of the Lamanites. In it we read:\n\nKNOW YE: \u2014 That the kingdom of God has come, as has been predicted by \nancient prophets, . . . This High Priesthood or Apostleship, holds the keys \nof the kingdom of God, . . . Being established in these last days for the \nrestoration of all things . . . in order to prepare the way for the coming \nof the Son of Man. . . . We also bear testimony that the \"Indians\" (so \ncalled) of North and South America are a remnant of the tribes of Israel, \nas is now made manifest by the discovery and revelation of their ancient \noracles and records.\n\nAnd that they are about to be gathered, civilized, and made one nation in \nthis glorious land. . . .\n\nFor be it known unto them that we now hold the keys of the priesthood and \nkingdom which is soon to be restored unto them. . . . The city of Zion, \nwith its sanctuary and priesthood, and the glorious fulness of the gospel, \nwill constitute a standard which will put an end to jarring creeds and \npolitical wranglings, by uniting the republics, states, provinces, \nterritories, nations, tribes, kindred, tongues, people, and sects of North \nand South America in one great and common bond of brotherhood. . . .\n\nLet the government of the United States also continue to gather together, \nand to colonize the tribes and remnants of Israel (the Indians), and also \nto feed, clothe, succor, and protect them, and endeavor to civilize and \nunite; and also to bring them to the knowledge of their Israelitish origin \n. . .\n\nHe has given us the Holy Priesthood and Apostleship, and the keys of the \nkingdom of God, to bring about the restoration of all things as promised by \nthe holy prophets of old.\u2014And we know it.\n\nHe has revealed the origin and the Records of the aboriginal tribes of \nAmerica, and their future destiny.\u2014And we know it (Proclamation of the \nTwelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints, New \nYork, April 6th, 1845, sixteen page pamphlet).\n\nThis statement by the LDS Twelve Apostles takes on official status as there \nwas no president of the church at the time. Joseph Smith was killed in 1844 \nand his successor had not been appointed. In 1845 the Twelve Apostles \nconstituted the highest authority in the LDS Church.\n\n IF GOD leads your \"church\", and directs it's leaders then this would have \nbeen PROVED true, by science and DNA evidence...but EXACTLY the opposite is \nproven by modern SCIENCE, no link between the \"lamanites\" and the Nation of \nIsrael.",

(DNA \nv. the Book of Mormon video transcript, p. 11)\n\nDr. Dennis O'Rourke, Molecular Geneticist\n\nThe molecular data, the DNA data, indicate the closest affinities of \ncontemporary Native American populations are with populations in east Asia \nand central Asia. I think it is true that there is a scientific consensus \nthat the original peoples that came to the Americas came from Asia. (Living \nHope Ministries interview found at http://www.lhvm.org/dna_sci.htm).\n\nThomas Murphy, Mormon Anthropologist\n\nAs a Mormon anthropologist I have a serious problem with the Book of Mormon \nrepresentations of American Indians, not only does it claim that Lamanites \nare principal ancestors of the American Indians but throughout the text it \nrepeatedly refers to them as Israelites, descendants of Joseph, as \ndescendants of the biblical patriarchs, of Abraham, those repeated \nreferences to an ancient Israelite connection have been clearly invalidated \nby scientific research into the genes of American Indians. \u2026 What is most \nsignificant about the genetic research and its applicability to the Book of \nMormon is that it validates what we already knew from other scientific \ndisciplines. From biological anthropology more generally, we knew a long \ntime ago that American Indians resembled Asians and particularly the people \nfrom the regions around Mongolia, and Siberia more than they did any other \npeoples. Archeologically we knew that there were similarities between the \ncultures of north east Asia and those of the early Americans \u2026 We also knew \nbased on the linguistic evidence that American Indians shared a common \nancestry with at least some of the north east Asians and Siberians so we \nhad all this other evidence from scientific disciplines as diverse as \nlinguistics, archaeology and human biology all showing us an Asian origin \nof the American Indians. Now the genetic data confirms what we already knew \nfrom that other material. (Interview quoted at: \nhttp://www.lhvm.org/dna_sci.htm\n\nSimon Southerton, Molecular Biologist, former Mormon Bishop\n\nIt was during my second year as a bishop that I stumbled upon DNA research \non Native Americans and became quite concerned with what I was reading \nbecause as a plant molecular biologist I dealt with DNA all the time. I was \nextracting DNA from plants and cloning genes, sequencing DNA and I was very \nfamiliar with the fundamental technology that was used in these research \npapers on native Americans and I very quickly over a couple of weeks \ndiscovered that in excess of 99% of Native Americans were clearly descended \nfrom Asian ancestors. I was a Latter-day Saint that hadn\u2019t been exposed to \nany research so threatening to my beliefs, and I was deeply, deeply shocked \nto find that research and DNA evidence that I understood particularly well \nwould so fundamentally challenge the beliefs that I had. And I for several \nweeks lived with two completely contradictory beliefs in my brain. On the \none side I was deeply committed to a belief in the Book of Mormon and to \nthe beliefs of the church which taught that the Native Americans were \nprincipally descended from the Lamanites who were derived from Israel. But \non the other hand I was faced with DNA research which I had a high degree \nof confidence in, which completely and utterly contradicted my beliefs. I \nknew without a doubt that greater than 99% of Native Americans were \nundoubtedly related to Siberians and not to the Lamanites, to Israelites. \nAnd it was only after two weeks that I was able to sort of come to terms \nwith the problem here and that was that the only alternative was that the \nBook of Mormon beliefs that I had were just not right. And the only way \nthat I could honestly confront this research was to say to my leaders from \nnow on I cannot serve as a bishop because I\u2019m so deeply troubled by some \nresearch that I\u2019ve come across. (DNA v. the Book of Mormon, video \ntranscript, pp. 26-27).\n\nSimon Southerton, Molecular Biologist, former Mormon Bishop\n\nIf the Y-chromosomes all come from Asia and the mitochondrial genomes all \ncome from Asia, then the only explanation for where all the rest of the \nchromosomes come from is Asia. That is a very scientifically valid \nexplanation; it\u2019s the only explanation. In excess of a hundred and fifty \ntribes have been tested now, these are scattered all over north and central \nand south America, even to Greenland. And from the survey in excess of five \nand a half thousand individuals have been involved and have been tested, \nfrom those five and a half thousand\u2026 99.4 percent of Native Americans have \na mitochondrial DNA lineage that originated in Asia. There can be no \nquestion, 99.4%. The other 0.6% have either a European or an African \nmitochondrial lineage. The very tiny minority of European and African \nlineages that they do find came after Columbus.\u201d (DNA v. the Book of \nMormon, video transcript, p. 17-18).\n\nPart 3: Mormon Responses to the DNA Challenge\n\nThis section examines ways Mormon apologists and scholars have attempted to \ndefend the Book of Mormon. There has been no \u201cofficial\u201d response from the \nMormon Church regarding the DNA research, Native Americans and the \nimplications for the Book of Mormon, other than the statement posted on the \nMormon.org website under the heading \u201cMistakes in the News\u201d which states:\n\nDNA and the Book of Mormon\nVarious media outlets, 11 November 2003 \n\nThe Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is exactly what it \nclaims to be \u2014 a record of God\u2019s dealings with peoples of ancient America \nand a second witness of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. The \nstrongest witness of the Book of Mormon is to be obtained by living the \nChrist-centered principles contained in its pages and by praying about its \ntruthfulness.\n\nRecent attacks on the veracity of the Book of Mormon based on DNA evidence \nare ill considered. Nothing in the Book of Mormon precludes migration into \nthe Americas by peoples of Asiatic origin. The scientific issues relating \nto DNA, however, are numerous and complex. Those interested in a more \ndetailed analysis of those issues are referred to the resources below.\n\n(http://www.lds.org/newsroom/mistakes/0,15331,3885-1-18078,00.html)\n\nThere are links to five articles, four of which have been published in the \nJournal of Book of Mormon Studies, a publication of the Foundation for \nAncient Research and Mormon Studies [FARMS] at Brigham Young University. \nThe articles are the basis for understanding the Mormon response to the DNA \nchallenge.\n\nFor each article I will look at the foundational statements or arguments \nset forth to counter the DNA challenge to the Book of Mormon and provide \nobservations and critiques on the Mormon defense proposed.\n\n\"Before DNA\" (John L. Sorenson and Matthew Roper, Journal of Book of Mormon \nStudies, vol. 12, no. 1, 2003). In this article the authors argue for a \ncomparatively small population of Nephites occupying a limited section of \nMesoamerica and surrounded by a much larger non-Semitic population. The \npresence of non-Israelite peoples can be assumed, even though they are not \nmentioned, because the small group of people mentioned in 2 Nephi 5 would \nnot have had the ability to build temples, put together an army or engage \nin wars. Since the Book of Mormon attributes such things to the Nephites, \nthis must mean that their small group was surrounded by much larger groups \nof people. These people then joined with the Nephites in order to help them \naccomplish all the tasks that are mentioned in the Book of Mormon. In the \nprocess of intermarriage, all traces of Jewish ancestry were lost.\n\nIt is very interesting to note defenders of the Book of Mormon utilizing \nthe same arguments to support the Book of Mormon\u2019s historicity and it\u2019s \nauthenticity that critics of Mormonism have used for the past several \ndecades to discredit it.10 Yet, in their appeal to a new understanding of \nBook of Mormon history, Mormon apologists who seek to defuse DNA-based \ncriticism, provide interpretations that run counter to the explanations and \ndefenses of the Book of Mormon given in materials published by the Mormon \nChurch. For example, Sorenson and Roper argue that the Nephites had to have \nbeen surrounded by other peoples with whom they joined forces, otherwise it \nis not feasible that they would be able to build a temple \u201clike unto \nSolomon.\u201d Sorenson and Roper state, \u201cSo few men could not have put up much \nof a temple.\u201d (p. 14) And yet in the Book of Mormon Student Manual for \nReligion classes 121 and 122, published by the Mormon Church in 1989, the \nargument advanced is that the temple of Solomon was not so big, and that \n\u201cit was quite possible for a small number of Nephites to erect a temple as \nlarge as that erected by Solomon, omitting the costly ornamentations.\u201d (BOM \nStudent Manual, p. 26).\n\nAnother example of the Sorenson-Roper attempt to rewrite Book of Mormon \nhistory is where they state that early Mormon leaders \u201cdid not read the \ntext carefully on matters of doctrine.\u201d The result is that \u201cno statement \nshows that anyone read the scripture closely enough to grasp the fact that \nthe plates Mormon gave to Moroni were never buried in the hill of the final \nNephite battle.\u201d (emphasis added, p. 10). It would appear that Mormon \nleaders are still not \u201creading the scripture closely enough\u201d given the \nfollowing statement by Elder Mark Peterson, a member of the Quorum of the \nTwelve Apostles until his death in 1984:\n\nMoroni\u2019s father was commander of the armies of this ancient people, known \nas Nephites. His name was Mormon. The war of which we speak took place here \nin America some four hundred years after Christ. (See Mormon 6.)\n\nAs the fighting neared its end, Mormon gathered the remnant of his forces \nabout a hill which they called Cumorah, located in what is now the western \npart of the state of New York.\n\nTheir enemies, known as Lamanites, came against them on this hill. \u2026 Then \nhe spoke of other leaders serving with him in the Nephite army, all of whom \nhad fallen with the forces under their command. He accounted for about a \nquarter of a million Nephite soldiers killed in that final encounter at \nCumorah.\n\n\u2026 At the time Mormon recorded the details of this dreadful tragedy, he said \nthat only twenty-four remained alive of all the men, women, and children of \nthe Nephites. These surviving few were themselves killed the next day\u2014with \none exception, Moroni, whom the Lord spared to close up the written record.\n\nWhen finished with the record, Moroni was to hide it up in that same Hill \nCumorah which was their battlefield. It would come forth in modern times as \nthe Book of Mormon, named after Moroni\u2019s father, the historian who compiled \nit. (Mark E. Petersen, \u201cThe Last Words of Moroni,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1978, 57ff, \nemphasis added).\n\nSorenson and Roper are in essence saying, \u201cOur highest spiritual leaders \nand our primary teaching manuals have been wrong for over 150 years. \nPresidents, Prophets and Apostles have been in error and have been leading \nMormon people astray for the entire history of the Church up until the \npresent.\u201d Will the Mormon Church\u2019s spiritual leadership defer to the \napologists and academicians? Given the articles provided on the official \nMormon website, it would appear to some degree they already have. I\u2019m \nguessing there will be no more Ensign articles on the Lamanites, nor will \npresentations to Hispanic members or speeches given in a Latin American \ncontext refer to those present as descendants of Lehi who have the blood of \nAbraham in their veins. Nor is it likely that future Dedicatory prayers \nwill praise those in attendance as \u201csons and daughters of Father Lehi.\u201d \nSlowly, yet deliberately, church manuals, magazines and General Conference \nspeeches will be revised to exclude any connection between Book of Mormon \nLamanites and Amerindian peoples living today. Such references undermine \nthe limited geography theory and therefore have ever decreasing usefulness \nas the Mormon Church attempts to salvage Book of Mormon credibility by \nadopting a limited geography model.\n\nWhat is notable is that both Mormon and non-Mormon writers find glaring \nproblems with proposed limited geography theories. Mormon writer Earl M. \nWunderli provides an extensive and detailed critique of the Limited \ngeography theory advocated by Sorenson and others. His rejection of it is \nbased primarily on internal evidence from the Book of Mormon and he draws \nthe following conclusions in a recent Dialogue article:\n\nSorenson and other Mormon scholars have recognized that the traditional \nhemispheric model no longer works, but their solution of a limited \ngeography model does not work either. Sorenson\u2019s model requires contorting \nterminology and text to make a case riven by esoteric complication. His \nmodel wanders far afield from what the Book of Mormon straightforwardly \ndescribes. It solves many problems with the hemispheric model but only at \ngreat cost to the Book of Mormon\u2019s internal reliability as scripture, as a \nbook that presumably means what it says (Earl M. Wunderli, \u201cCritique of a \nLimited Geography for the Book of Mormon Events,\u201d Dialogue: A Journal of \nMormon Thought, v. 35:3 [Fall 2002], p. 197).\n\nAs of this writing I could find no response by Mormon apologists to \nWunderli\u2019s detailed 36-page critique.\n\nMormon researcher and writer, Brent Metcalf, also provides a cogent \nanalysis of the problems raised by the new apologetic defenses suggested by \nRoper and Sorenson, noting that \u201cSuch theories turn traditional \nunderstandings of Book of Mormon lands and peoples, including Joseph \nSmith\u2019s revelations, on their head.\u201d (Metcalfe, Sunstone 131 (March 2004), \np. 20. In his article, \u201cReinventing Lamanite Identity,\u201d Metcalfe provides \nevidence from the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith himself that the Mormon \napologists\u2019 novel interpretations are unsupported and unwarranted. For \nexample he cites the Mormon Scripture, Joseph Smith \u2013 History, v. 34 which \nsays that the Book of Mormon plates contain \u201can account of the former \ninhabitants of this [the North American] continent, and the source from \nwhence they sprang.\u201d Metcalfe concludes that:\n\napologetic scholars have an arduous task ahead of them. They have yet to \nexplain cogently why all the Book of Mormon characters\u2014God \nincluded\u2014seemingly know nothing about the hordes of indigenous peoples that \nthe revisionist theories require; \u2026 and why their word should count more \nthan that of Mormon prophets on the one hand, and that of secular scholars \non the other (Metcalfe, p. 23).\nsee the complete link here:\nhttp://mit.irr.org/lamanites-no-more-dna-and-lost-ties-father-lehi",

The Church has spent its millions in Hawaii and New Zealand \nand other islands to provide schools for the young Lehites. Surely no \ndescendants need go now without an education, and schools (Spencer W. \nKimball, \"The Day of the Lamanites,\" Improvement Era, Dec. 1960, pp. \n922-923, 925, emphasis added).\n\nLetter from First Presidency regarding Hill Cumorah location, October 16, \n1990 \u2014\n\nBrother S \u2014 inquired about the location of the Hill Cumorah mentioned in \nthe Book of Mormon, where the last battle between the Nephites and \nLamanites took place.\n\nThe Church has long maintained, as attested to by references in the \nwritings of General Authorities, that the Hill Cumorah in western New York \nstate is the same as referenced in the Book of Mormon.\n\nNote: This is significant in that it expands the Book of Mormon lands at \nleast to upstate New York where the final battle took place, making it \nimpossible to limit Book of Mormon geography to a small region of Central \nAmerica.

Dallas Burnett\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is unique in its \ntheological and philosophical understanding of the peoples in the Americas \nknown as Indians and of the inhabitants of the Pacific islands. These \npeople are a remnant of the House of Jacob and descendants of Lehi, an \nIsraelite who left Jerusalem and came to the Americas around 600 B.C. Found \nin the Book of Mormon, a record of revelations received by these ancient \npeoples, are great promises for the Lamanites (\u201cLamanites and the Church,\u201d \nEnsign, July 1971, p. 11ff.)\n\n\nso don\"t try to tell me SIR, THAT I am lilman, when it is your denial of \nthe facts in the face of OVERWHELMING EVIDENCES, that your \"doctrine and \ntheology\", are left sadly wanting among the TRUTHS of JESUS.\n\nSpencer W. Kimball\n\nWith pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a \ndescendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ \nand with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi \nand his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes \nin North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea, for \nin the middle of their history there were those who left America in ships \nof their making and went to the islands of the sea. (page 7)\n\nMy brothers and sisters, you belong to a great race. Your father is Joseph \nwho was sold into Egypt, the virtuous man who went to prison rather than \nyield to the seduction of a queen. Your father was Jacob, the father of \ntwelve sons. You came through one of them. One of the great prophets of all \ntimes, your father, was Isaac. Another great prophet, your father, was \nAbraham, than whom there were no greater ones. Abraham was a great man who \nwalked and talked with God. He is your father back those many generations. \nBe proud of him and know that you are of royal blood; with your royal blood \nyou can achieve, rising to the top. (page 10).\n\nThere are no blessings, of all the imaginable ones, to which you are not \nentitled\u2014you, the Lamanites\u2014when you are righteous. You are of royal blood, \nthe children of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Lehi (\u201cOf Royal Blood,\u201d \nEnsign, July 1971, p. 10).\n\nHarold Brown\n\nThe redemption of the Lamanite as a remnant of scattered Israel, in \naccordance with Book of Mormon prophecy, is one of the vital \nresponsibilities and opportunities of the restored church\n\nAs the gospel is taught in various nations of the Americas and on the \nPacific islands, missionary programs for Lamanite and mestizo segments of \nthe population might well be adapted to the language and the ethnic \nposition of the descendants of Father Lehi in each nation. Missionary work \nin Bolivia, for instance, is done in Spanish and in two Indian languages, \nQuechua and Aymar\u00e1 (\u201cWhat Is a Lamanite?\u201d Ensign, Sept. 1972, 62ff).\n\nBoyd K. Packer (Senior Apostle over Lamanite affairs)9\n\nThere are more than 60 million people of Lamanite extraction. It is no \naccident that the Church now prospers among them in Mexico, Central and \nSouth America, in the islands of the sea, and among the Indian tribes of \nNorth America. (\u201cPresident Spencer W. Kimball: No Ordinary Man,\u201d Ensign, \nMar. 1974, 3ff).\n\nIn contrast to the relatively few in North America who could claim Lamanite \nlineage (1.3 million), Packer pointed to the many millions in Mexico, \nYucatan, Guatemala, and throughout South America: \u201cIn all \u2026 there are \nseventy-five million six hundred thousand who share in your [Native \nAmerican Lamanite] birthright, of whom thrity-one million nine hundred \nninety thousand are pure Indians.\u201d (Address given during proceedings of the \nannual Indian Week at BYU, cited by Armand L. Mauss, All Abraham\u2019s \nChildren, p. 96).\n\nThe Mormon Church teaching manual, Gospel Principles links the conversion \nof Native Americans to the coming of Jesus Christ when it states:\n\nThe Lord said that when his coming was near, the Lamanites would become a \nrighteous and respected people. He said, \u201cBefore the great day of the Lord \nshall come, \u2026 the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose\u201d (D&C 49:24).

We have seen thousands converted to the Lord who had his law put into \ntheir minds and written in their hearts (see Heb. 8:10).\n\n2. We have seen them organized into numerous stakes of Zion.\n\n3. We have truly seen them \u201cblossom as the rose\u201d as prophecy has been \nfulfilled through them (see D&C 49:24). (Gene R. Cook, \u201cMiracles among the \nLamanites,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1980, 67.)\n\nElder Cook makes reference to an important prophetic Mormon scripture, \nDoctrine and Covenants 49:24, which says, \"But before the great day of the \nLord shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites \nshall blossom as a rose.\" Native American converts in North, South and \nCentral America have been told repeatedly that since they are Lamanites, \ntheir conversion to Mormonism is a fulfillment of this Scripture, giving \nthem not only special historical identity, but a prophetic one as well.\n\nModern Day Lamanites Embrace Their \u2018Identity\u2019\n\nThe September 1920 Improvement Era carried the conversion story of a \nprominent Mexican Mormon named Margarito Bautista. The heading of the \narticle identified him as, \u201cM. Bautista, a Descendant of Father Lehi.\u201d It \nis clear from his testimony that the Mormon teaching of Israelite heritage \nin Native American people resonated with him, as Margarito wrote,\n\nAs a literal descendant of our Father Lehi, I feel in my soul that the \ngospel which was once known among my people but [was] taken away on account \nof transgression has been restored again to mankind. I feel that the Book \nof Mormon is one of the most glorious books on earth\u201d (\u201cA Faith Promoting \nExperience, Improvement Era 23 [September 1920]: 978-84, cited by Thomas W. \nMurphy, \u201cOther Mormon Histories: Lamanite Subjectivity in Mexico,\u201d Journal \nof Mormon History, 26:2 [Fall 2000], pp. 190-191.).\n\nThis perspective continues today among Mormon Latino membership. Thomas \nMurphy relates his experience in a priesthood meeting in Antigua, Guatemala:\n\nLuis, (a pseudonym) was teaching a lesson on the Abrahamic Covenant. In the \nmidst of the discussion Luis turned to me and explained that what \ndistinguished Latin American Mormons from Anglo-American Mormons was the \nfact that the former were direct descendants of Abraham through the peoples \nof the Book of Mormon, while \u2018los americanos\u2019 or \u2018los anglos\u2019 were adopted \ninto the Abrahamic covenant. This view was echoed by others in the group, \nand subsequent discussions indicated that a similar view was held by many \nLatin Americans.\u201d (Thomas W. Murphy, \u201cReinventing Mormonism: Guatemala as \nHarbinger of the Future?\u201d, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 29:1 \n[Spring 1996], pp. 178-179).",

None of which is SCRIPTURAL....nor does your \n\"denial\" of the Godessess wives of God in mormon theology, ring \ntrue...where do the \"bililons\" of spirt children come from? See also: God \nin Mormonism\nIn Mormonism, the concept of divinity centers around an idea of \n\"exaltation\" and \"eternal progression\": the idea that mortals themselves \nmay become gods and goddesses in the afterlife, be rulers of their own \nheavenly kingdoms, have spirit children, and increase in power and glory \nforever as a result of their posterity. Mormons understand that there are \nmany gods and goddesses in the cosmos, including a Heavenly Mother. \nHowever, the three persons of the Christian Trinity (God the Father, Jesus, \nand the Holy Ghost) are to be the only objects of worship.\nAnd yet you desire that people believe this NONSENSE....and you refuse to \nadmit this IS what your \"church\" teaches....and it is in no way \nBIBLICAL.....if we were all spirit \"children\" , GOD having formed Adam of \nthe dust of the earth, would have not needed to breathe into him the breath \nof life, when he became a \"LIVING SOUL\"\n\nLILJOE doesn't even approach the benchmark of \"PROPHETS\", or meet the \nrequirements of the same as outlined in the OLD TESTAMENT\nand as such \"preached a DIFFERENT\" gospel as outlined by PAUL, and is to be \nconsidered in the same light...\n\nGalatians 1:6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who \ncalled you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,\n7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to \npervert the gospel of Christ.\n8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you \nthan what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.\n9 As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other \ngospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.\n10 For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I \nstill pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.\n11 But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by \nme is not according to man.\n\nAnd it IS CHURCH DOCTRINE, just because you don't believe or know it \ndoesn't make it untrue...see below\nThe Book of Mormon originally stated that when Lamanites converted they \nwould then become \"white and delightsome.\" In 1981 the Church decided to \nreplace the word \"white\" with \"pure.\"\n\nMost white Americans have looked upon the stories of the Lamanites as \nracist. In 1971 the official Mormon publication the Ensign stated, \"As we \nattempt to solve the complex puzzle we call life, there is a constant \nsearch for elements that will clarify the picture. For [Mormons} one of the \nkeys to this great pattern of existence is the group of people known as \nLamanites.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Those not of the Church call these people Indians, although \nthe term actually refers to a broader group than that. Most members of the \nChurch know that the Lamanites, who consist of Indians of all the Americas \nas well as the islanders of the Pacific, are a people with a special \nheritage.\"\n\nA study done at BYU revealed, \"Ironically, the database compiled by BYU can \nonly conclude that there is no evidence of a Native American/Israel \nconnection. In fact, no DNA study at any university has ever demonstrated \notherwise.\" Ross added, \"However, it is doubtful that BYU would ever \nrelease any research that could potentially prove embarrassing to the \nChurch.\"\n\nSo here we have the LDS Church faced with potential errors in the Book of \nMormons, that started off with faulty data that proved to be an \nembarrassment and has been pointed out by some church members and by many \nNative Americans as racist: the whiter the skin the closer to God.\nThe Curse of Dark Skin\n\nThe source of this uniquely Mormon doctrine has its roots in the Mormon \nscriptures. Some very good \ninsight can also be found in an old book published way back in 1931 called \n\"The Way To Perfection.\" \n\nI will discuss \"The Way to Perfection\" near the end of the text, but for \nnow let's turn to the Mormon \nscriptures.\n\nThe first time we hear about the curse of dark, or black, skin in the Book \nof Mormon is 2 Nephi 5:21. \nIt is said that God cursed the Lamanites with black skin so they would not \nbe enticing unto the Nephites.\n\nEven though Alma 17:14 describes the Lamanites as being a wild, ferocious, \nplundering, robbing, and \nmurdering people, God felt the need to change their skin color to make them \nnot enticing to the Nephites ... \nas if their immoral acts were not sufficient enough to deter the Nephites \ninto wanting to become like \nthem. It is also stated in 2 Nephi 5:23 that the Nephites would also be \ncursed with the dark skin if they \nmarried with the Lamanites.\n\nThe Lamanite babies that were born to the dark-skinned Lamanites also had \nthe sign of this curse.\n\nHow black skin is not attractive to the white-skinned Nephite people is a \ndiscussion for another time.\n\nIn Alma 3:6-7, it is recorded that the skins of the Lamanites were dark, \n\"according to the mark which \nwas set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their \ntransgression and their \nrebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and \nJoseph, and Sam, who were just \nand holy men. And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they \nwere cursed; and the Lord \nGod set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of \nIshmael, and \nIshmaelitish women\".\n\nIn the Bible, the Israelites who conquered the land of Canaan and later \napostatized were not cursed \nwith dark skin to separate themselves from those sons of Jacob who remained \nfaithful to God's \ncovenant. Even in the LDS teaching of the period of the Great Apostasy, \nwhite people did not turn \nblack and black people did not turn white.\n\nSo that is how things progressed in the Book of Mormon.\n\nThere is a case in Alma 23:18 where the curse was removed from the \nLamanites and it did no more \nfollow them.\n\nAccording to 3 Nephi chapters 11 through 30, Jesus is said to visit the \nNephites somewhere in the \nAmericas sometime around 34 A.D.\n\nAccording to 4 Nephi 1:6, twenty-five years had passed away since Jesus \nascended back into \nheaven, from there to visit all the other lost tribes of the house of \nIsrael. In 4 Nephi 1:10, we learn \nthat all the people of Nephi had become \"an exceedingly fair and \ndelightsome people\". In other \nwords, they became white-skinned. See the footnote 10a. It links to 1 Nephi \n13:15, 2 Nephi 5:21, \nand Mormon 9:6.\n\nIn 1 Nephi 13:15, the Gentiles who are said to have discovered America (aka \nChristopher Columbus) \nwere physically white like the Nephites before they were slain at the great \nbattle with the Lamanites. \nThe spiritually-dark Nephites were slain because they had slidden into \napostasy.\n\nLet's specifically look at Mormon 9:6. \"O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto \nthe Lord; cry mightily unto \nthe Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, \npure, fair, and white, having \nbeen cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day.\"\n\nIn Jacob 3:8, one also learns that the skin color of the Lamanites could be \nwhiter than those of the \nNephites when they would appear before God's throne.\n\nAccording to 4 Nephi 1:14-17, 66 years had passed since the arrival of \nChrist to the 'Americas' \n(100 years from the birth of Christ). This was time when the happiest \npeople on earth lived in the \n'Americas.'  Only righteous people existed. There were no Nephites, no \nLamanites, \"nor any manner \nof -ites.\"\n\nFrom around 100 A.D. to 200 A.D., the period of righteousness reigned. In \nthe 201st year, sin \nbegan to creep into the church (4 Nephi 1:24). In the 110th year, a small \ngroup of people separated \nand took upon themselves the name of 'Lamanites' (4 Nephi 1:20). In the \n231st year, the designation \nof 'Nephites' had come back (4 Nephi 1:35). 3 other divisions also came \nabout (Jacobites, Josephites, \nand Zoramites).\n\n4 Nephi 1:45-46 records that the Nephites had become wicked like the \nLamanites. There were no \nrighteous except for only 3 disciples. Moroni 9:20 records that the \nNephites even exceeded the \nwickedness of the Lamanites. The Nephites were said to have raped the \nLamanite women, torturing \nthem unto death, and then eating their flesh (Moroni 9:9-10). And in none \nof this did their skin color \nbecome dark.\n\nAccording to Mormon 1:13-14 (circa 322 A.D.), \"wickedness did prevail upon \nthe face of the whole \nland\" and \"there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not \ncome upon any, because \nof their wickedness and unbelief.\"\n\nThis was a period of total apostasy.\n\nThe Mormon Jesus had failed to prevent Satan from destroying his church \nagain like Latter-day Saints \nbelieve Satan destroyed the first century church in Palestine.\n\nIn Mormon 2:14, we learn that the Nephites cursed God and wished they would \ndie. The Lamanites \non the other hand resorted to offering up the Nephite women and children \nprisoners as human sacrifices \nto their idols (Mormon 4:15). Mormon 4:12 even records that these people \nwere the most wicked of \nany of the tribes of Israel (Mormon 4:12).\n\nThe Book of Mormon never describes the return of the curse of black skin \nupon the Nephites and the \nLamanites. \n\nThe Lamanites were not a white-skinned people when the LDS Church says that \nthe Lamanites are \nthe principle ancestors of the native American Indians. The Nephites are \nsaid to be white however \nwhen they are slain in the great Lamanite-Nephite war story in the Book of \nMormon.\n\nThe curse of dark skin was not mentioned at all in the great Jaredite \ncivilization that was also said to \nhave come to a choice land above all other lands.\n\nWhen you compare the 1830 version of the Book of Mormon with today's \nversion, you will see a \nsmall editing change in 2 Nephi 30:6. The word \"white\" in the phrase \"they \nshall be a white and a \ndelightsome people\" has been changed to \"pure.\". The fact that white has \nbeen changed to pure \nreflects the LDS belief that white skin is symbolic of purity whereas black \nskin is symbolic of impurity.\n\nThe Way to Perfection\n\nWhat has the Mormon Church taught in relation to the Negroes being denied \nthe Priesthood?\n\nIt took some time to find this book published way back in 1931 by Joseph \nFielding Smith. For \nobvious reasons, it is not published by the Mormon Church today.\n\nAs we have seen earlier from a Youtube video, the former President of the \nMormon Church, Gordon \nB. Hinckley, admitted that he did not know why the Negroes were denied the \nPriesthood.  The \n1931 text makes it obviously clear. You would figure anyone who is anyone \nof high importance in \nthe LDS Church would be very familiar with this book.\n\nLet's examine some key passages in chapters 15 and 16.\n\nChapter 15 is entitled, \"The Seed of Cain.\" Chapter 16 is entitled, \"The \nSeed of Cain After the \nFlood.\"\n\n\"Not only was Cain called upon to suffer, but because of his wickedness he \nbecame the father \nof an inferior race\" (p. 101).\n\n\"Millions of souls have come into this world cursed with black skin and \nhave been denied the \nprivilege of Priesthood and the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel. \nThese are the descendants \nof Cain\" (p. 101).\n\n\"Moreover, they have been made to feel their inferiority and have been \nseparated from the rest of \nmankind from the beginning\" (p. 101).\n\n\"But what a contrast! The sons of Seth, Enoch and Noah honored by the \nblessings and rights of \nPriesthood! And the sons of Cain, denied the Priesthood\" (p. 102).\n\n\"In the spirit of sympathy, mercy and faith, we will also hope that \nblessings may eventually be given to \nour Negro brethren, for they are our brethren - children of God - \nnotwithstanding their black covering \nemblematical of eternal darkness\" (p. 102).\n\n\"The curse placed on Cain was continued in his posterity and that through \nthe seed of Ham this curse \nwas brought through the flood\" (p. 103).\n\n\"Some of the brethren who were associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith \ndeclared that he taught \nthis doctrine\" (p. 103).\n\n\"President Brigham Young, answering a question put to him by Elder Lorenzo \nD. Young in a meeting \nheld December 25, 1869, in Salt Lake City, said that Joseph Smith had \ndeclared that the Negroes \nwere not neutral in heaven, for all the spirits took sides, but the \nposterity of Cain are black because \nhe (Cain) committed murder\" (p. 105).\n\n\"When all the other children of Adam have had the privilege of receiving \nthe Priesthood, and of coming \ninto the Kingdom of God, and of being redeemed from the four quarters of \nthe earth, and have received \ntheir resurrection from the dead, then it will be time enough to remove the \ncurse from Cain and his \nposterity\" (p. 106).\n\n\"He (Cain) sinned against the light ... moreover, he was cursed and his \nposterity after him because he \ncut off Abel in his youth without posterity\" (p. 106).\n\n\"It was well understood by the early elders of the Church that the mark \nwhich was placed on Cain \nand which his posterity inherited was the black skin\" (p. 107).\n\n\"The Book of Moses informs us that Cain and his descendants were black\" (p. \n107).\n\n\"President George A. Smith, speaking of the Negro race, in a discourse, \nSeptember 23, 1855, \nsaid: When Cain brought a curse upon his own head and that of his \nhousehold, his after generations \nbear the same curse. The curse that came upon Canaan, the son of Ham, was \nextended to a great \nportion of the human race, and has continued to the present day\" (p. 109).\n\n\"This doctrine did not originate with President Brigham Young but was \ntaught by the Prophet \nJoseph Smith\" (p. 110).\n\n\"The Indians have greater cause to complain of the treatment of the whites, \nthan the Negroes, or \nsons of Cain - D.H.C., 4:501. But we all know it is due to his teachings \nthat the Negro today is \nbarred from the Priesthood\" (p. 111).\n\nApparently all this information slipped the mind of former President Gordon \nB. Hinckley before \nand during his interview.\n\n\"The Negro may be baptized and enter the Church; and some of these \nunfortunate people have \nbeen baptized and have proved their faithfulness and worthiness before the \nLord, in this their \nsecond estate\" (p. 111).\n\nAlso see pages 184-188 of \"Answers to Gospel Questions - volume 2\" and \npages 122-123 of\n\"Answers to Gospel Questions - volume 3\".\n\nI do not believe that the Negro race is an unfortunate people. But I do \nbelieve that it is unfortunate \nthat Latter-day Saints cannot obtain these books more readily from their \nchurch.\n\nIt is almost as if the LDS Church is trying to remove part of its \nhistorical teachings. Maybe this \nwould account for the fact that even a Mormon President is in the dark \nabout some church history. \nNow since he is in the dark, you can imagine the state of the ordinary lay \npersons.\n\nIn Jacob 3:8, white skin will be a sign of one's spiritual purity as they \nappear before God's throne \nfor judgment. Or maybe this is just for the Lamanites/Native American \nIndians?\n\nIn the meantime, it appears that the curse of Cain still remains on the \nNegro race even though the \nMormon Church extended the Priesthood to them in 1978. According to the \npublished declaration, \nthere is no mention of the curse being removed - for their skin is still \ndark.\n\n\nFrom your own \"SCRIPTURE\" and the mouths of your apostles and prophets.....",

Not only \nwas this visible among my peers, but in both the lds, and my own southern \nbaptist church. However the denial for admission in our church was from a \nDeacon, who had invested heavily in the congregation. Also he was a Texan, \nso his prejudices were most likely passed along by his family, as with so \nmany other southerners. The mormon \"boys\" I knew was more difficult to \ncomprehend in their prejudice.

The scripture has been changed it no longer reads \n\"white and delightsome\"....but it did. \n...their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many \ngenerations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and \na delightsome people.\" \n\nHowever, in 1981, the LDS Church decided to change \"the most correct book \non earth\" and switched the word \"white\" with the word \"pure.\" Some Mormons \ninsist that this was a clarification since the word was never meant to \nrefer to a person with dark skin pigmentation who would magically turn \nwhite based upon a conversion to the Mormon gospel; rather, it is claimed \nthat the change referred to a cleaner state of heart. This assumption is \ndefinitely not supported in the Book of Mormon since 2 Nephi 5:21 says, \n\n\"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, \nbecause of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts \nagainst him, and they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were \nwhite, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be \nenticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come \nupon them.\" \n\nFurthermore, we find another reference to a change in skin color in 3 Nephi \n2:15. This passage reads: \n\n\"And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto \nthe Nephites.\" \n\nAfter Smith's death in 1844, Brigham Young became president of the main \nbody of the church and led the Mormon pioneers to what would become the \nUtah Territory. Like many Americans at the time, Young (who was also the \nterritorial governor) promoted discriminatory views about black people.[5] \nOn January 16, 1852, Young made a pronouncement to the Utah Territorial \nLegislature, stating that \"any man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] \n... in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spake it \nbefore I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true and \nothers know it.\"[14]\n\nA similar statement by Young was recorded on February 13, 1849. The \nstatement\u2014which refers to the Curse of Cain\u2014was given in response to a \nquestion asking about the African's chances for redemption. Young \nresponded, \"The Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited \nthem the Priesthood.\"[14]\n\"Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of \nblackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of \nthe Holy Priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And \nwhen all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the Holy \nPriesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they \nwill then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings \nwhich we now are entitled to. The volition of the creature is free; this is \na law of their existence, and the Lord cannot violate his own law; were he \nto do that, he would cease to be God. He has placed life and death before \nhis children, and it is for them to choose. If they choose life, they \nreceive the blessings of life; if they chose death, they must abide the \npenalty. This is a law which has always existed from all eternity, and will \ncontinue to exist throughout all the eternities to come. Every intelligent \nbeing must have the power of choice, and God brings forth the results of \nthe acts of his creatures to promote his kingdom and subserve his purposes \nin the salvation and exaltation of his children. If the Lord could have his \nown way, he would have all the human family to enter into his church and \nkingdom, receive the Holy Priesthood and come into the celestial kingdom of \nour Father and God, by the power of their own choice.\"[23]\n\nContradictions in Mormon scripture:\nOne God\nBook of Mormon:\nAlma 11:27-39, 44; 2 Nephi 31:21;\nMormon 7:7; 3 Nephi 11:27;\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\nGod is a Spirit\nBook of Mormon: Alma 18:26-28; 22:8-11\nGod Dwells in Heart\nBook of Mormon: Alma 34:36\nCreation - One God\nBook of Mormon: 2 Nephi 2:14; Jacob 4:9\nPearl of Great Price: Book of Moses - Chapter 2\nGod Cannot Lie\nBook of Mormon: Ether 3:12; 2 Nephi 9:34\nGod\u2019s Word Unchangeable\nBook of Mormon: Alma 41:8\nNo Pre-Existence of Man\nBook of Mormon: Jacob 4:9; Alma 18:28, 34-36\nDeath Seals Man\u2019s Fate\nBook of Mormon: Mosiah 2:36-39; Alma 34:32-35\nHeathen Saved Without Baptism\nBook of Mormon: Moroni 8:22-23; 2 Nephi 9:25-26;\nMosiah 15:24-27\nHeaven or Hell\nBook of Mormon: 1 Nephi 15:35; 2 Nephi 28:22; \nMosiah 16:11, 27:31; Alma 41:4-8, 42:16\nMurder Can Be Forgiven\nBook of Mormon: 3 Nephi 30:2\nPolygamy Condemned\nBook of Mormon: Jacob 1:15; 2:24; 3:5; Mosiah 11:2\nAgainst Paid Ministry\nBook of Mormon: 2 Nephi 26:31; Mosiah 27:5\nCorrupt Churches Promise \nForgiveness For Money\nBook of Mormon: Mormon 8:32\nAdam in America\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 107:53; 116:1; 117:8\nPlural Gods\nDoctrine and Covenants:\nSection 121:32\nSection 132:18-20, 37\nGod Has a Body\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 130:22\nGod Does Not Dwell in Heart\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 130:3\nCreation - Plural Gods\nPearl of Great Price: \nBook of Abraham - Chapters 4 and 5\nGod Commands Lying\nPearl of Great Price: Book of Abraham - Ch. 2:22-25\nGod\u2019s Word Can Change\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 56:4-5\nMan Pre-Existed\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 93:23, 29-33\nPGP: Book of Abraham - Chapter 3:18, 21-23\nChance After Death\nDoctrine and Covenants: Sec. 76:106-112; 88:99\nBaptism for Dead\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 128:5, 17-18\nThree Kingdoms in Heaven - Most Saved\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 76:43, 70-112\nNo Forgiveness For Murder\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 42:18\nPolygamy Commanded\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 132:1, 37-39, 61\nFor Paid Ministry\nDoctrine and Covenants: Sec. 42:71-73; 43:12-13; 51:13-14\nChurch Members Who Tithe \nWill Not Burn\nDoctrine and Covenants: Section 64:23\nAdam in Old World\nPearl of Great Price: Book of Moses 3:8, 10-15\nI present facts, backed with SCRIPTURE...you have no answers except the \nstandard lds line that the \"apostasy\", took over Christ's church, and there \nwas a need for restoration. Yet today we have more ancient manuscripts than \never before, and the fact is, Jesus taught nothing the LDS teach....the \n idea is that Jesus filled the glass most of the way full to Salvation and \nwe must finish the filling to overflowing by our works is not a teaching of \nChristianity. Nowhere does ANY disciple of Christ give such teaching. THE \n\"VISIONS\" OF LILJOE ARE ALSO SUSPECT....since there are at least 18 \ndifferent recorded versions of the 1st vision. \nSo I KNOW, mormon doctrine, I've researched the beliefs of your \"Prophets\", \nand find them wholly lacking in regard  to MY SAVIOR, and the BIBLICAL \nJESUS. You claim that \"\n12/12/13\n\"Works alone will not get us to heaven; neither will faith alone. It takes \nBOTH. We prove our truth faith in Jesus Christ by doing good works for Him, \nand when we fall short--and we will fall short--grace is there to take us \nthe rest of the way.\n\nThat's how it works.\"\nYet that is contrary to the SCRIPTURE and TEACHINGS of JESUS....Ephesians 2 \nKing James Version (KJV)\n\n2 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;\n\n2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, \naccording to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now \nworketh in the children of disobedience:\n\n3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of \nour flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by \nnature the children of wrath, even as others.\n\n4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,\n\n5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, \n(by grace ye are saved;)\n\n6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly \nplaces in Christ Jesus:\n\n7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace \nin his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.\n\n8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it \nis the gift of God:\n\n9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.\n\n10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, \nwhich God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\n\n11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, \nwho are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in \nthe flesh made by hands;\n\n12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the \ncommonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having \nno hope, and without God in the world:\n\n13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by \nthe blood of Christ.\n\n14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the \nmiddle wall of partition between us;\n\n15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments \ncontained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so \nmaking peace;\n\n16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, \nhaving slain the enmity thereby:\n\n17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that \nwere nigh.\n\n18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.\n\n19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but \nfellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;\n\n20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus \nChrist himself being the chief corner stone;\n\n21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy \ntemple in the Lord:\n\n22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through \nthe Spirit.\nSo it is a gift, works are done out of LOVE for the MASTER, because we \ndesire to show love to our fellow man  as Christ did, we were  of the world \nwhile still in sin, yet God still loved us. The works have no part in \nanyone's SALVATION, but reflect the new man, reborn in the SPIRIT, with the \nindwelling CHRIST at the helm, we are bond servants, salves to GOD, and \nseek only to spread the WILL of GOD, in our lives to touch the lives of \nothers WITH THE LOVE OF GOD, AGAPE LOVE.\n\nDefinition: Agape is selfless, sacrificial, unconditional love, the highest \nof the four types of love in the Bible.\n\nThis Greek word and variations of it are found throughout the New \nTestament. Agape perfectly describes the kind of love Jesus Christ has for \nhis Father and for his followers:\n\nWhoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who \nloves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show \nmyself to them. (John 14:21, NIV)\n\nPronunciation: uh-GAH-pay\n\nExample:\n\nJesus lived out agape by sacrificing himself for the sins of the world.\n\nOther Types of Love in the Bible\n\nEros\nPhilia\nStorge\nso everthing I've researched is done out of love, because you like my Aunt, \nbelieve and follow a lie. And it pains me to see that the JESUS of the \nBible, is not sufficient, you must in this \"church\" and to the sacrifice of \nJESUS, and remove his DIVINE nature and make less of the WORD, than HE \nIS....for JESUS is the GREAT \"I AM\".....",

We don't know what dark energy or dark \nmatter is, we just know that something which scientists have give the name \nDark matter must exist mathematically and whatever it is will conform to \nnatural laws of quantum mechanics.\n\nThis fact only drives science further to find out the facts.  Whereas \nReligion simply shuts it's eyes and ears and says \"God did it\" then curls \nup and goes to sleep, safe in its cosy fantasy.\n\nHowever, there is not only no evidence for anything even remotely \nresembling a supernatural god, there is no need for anything resembling the \nChristian god.\n\nIn the absence of real evidence, the early superstitions and religions \nattributed all manner of phenomena, which they didn't understand, to all \nmanner of gods, spirits, and miracles, just as you do now with things you \ndon't understand.\n\nHowever, as our knowledge of the world has grown, all of it through \nadvances in science and none through religious endeavours, we've discovered \nthe true causes of more and more of these supposed *\u201cgod created\u201d* \nphenomena. Although they have been different, every one of these causes \nhave, without exception, proved to be totally natural and explainable. In \nnot a single case has there ever been found any form of divine intervention.\n\nBased on that unbroken and totally solid catalogue of historical precedence \nalone, it'd be foolish and na\u00efve not to assume that anything we're studying \nat this moment, including the start of the universe and the emergence of \nlife itself, will not have a similar conclusion, owing nothing to any deity.\n\nAs science advances, gods inevitably shrink further into the background, \nuntil one day, *(if we don't destroy ourselves arguing about religion),* \nthey will disappear completely from our consciousness and mankind will have \nleft its childhood behind.\n\nOne interesting point, regarding the \u201cBig Bang\u201d. I will agree that. so far, \nwe don't yet know the precise cause of the universe, but neither do the \nreligious. That's why \"I don't Know\" is the most honest answer.\n\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of scientists now agree the \u201cBig Bang\u201d \nis the best explanation that fits the current knowledge. Even most \nChristians in the Western democracies, apart from America, accept it. \nIncluding most Christian church leaders.\n\nHaving said that, scientists do know, from picoseconds of The \u201cBig Bang\u201d \nhappening, how the universe developed and that directly contradicts Genesis.\n\nSo, even if we assume, purely for the sake of argument, that some \u201cgod\u201d \ncaused the \u201cBig Bang\u201d. That is only an indication for a Deist viewpoint at \nbest.\n\nThe Christian Theist \u201cpersonal\u201d god as described in the bible and believed \nby Christians all over the world, has already been disproved beyond any \nreasonable doubt.",

I really wanted you to \nspare yourself some dignity and man up to your mistake, but instead you \npull this crap argument out in an attempt to shift the gaze away from your \nblatant mistake.\n\nI probably shouldn't encourage this type of red herring by answering your \npoorly constructed argument, but just because it's too easy to knock over \nthat straw house, I'll give you your retort: \"why you waste your time \nfighting something that you don't believe in\"\nI'm not.\nI'm arguing against people who believe in any gods, that is not at all the \nsame thing as arguing with, or against a god, and the fact that you can so \neasily switch the two around (Me arguing against you/ Me arguing against \nyour god) might have something to do with the fact that psychologically \nspeaking, your god, or at least the part of your mind you consult with when \ntrying to determine god's will, is the same part of your mind you use to \nconsult yourself in a decision making process.\nMore specifically, I'm arguing against the idea of believing in claims \nbefore there is sufficient evidence to believe them or before they're \nproven and meet their burden of proof. Whatever scale of evidence the \nmajority of the world's population is using for determining truth in \nregards to religion, clearly isn't working since everybody believes in \ndifferent religions, and the particular religion an individual subscribes \nto has to do largely with their geographical location.\nI am arguing against the idea of faith. It could even be said that I'm \narguing against the idea of a god (although that's not entirely true, as I \nwill gladly accept the hypothesis if there is ever what a scientist would \nconsider sufficient evidence for it). But arguing against the idea of a \ngod, and arguing with a god are not at all the same thing, and it's \nridiculous that you mix up those two things and present it as some sort of \nargument.\nAsk yourself this, if the majority of the world thought the Easter Bunny \nwas real, and spent a large portion of their lives worshiping it, would you \nnot have a say in the matter? Would you just say to yourself \"Well, I can't \ntell them they're wrong, because if I were to voice my opinion, I'd be \nadmitting to myself that there IS an Easter bunny, just by arguing with the \nidea.\" Of course you wouldn't!

What I find even more humorous than your \ninterpretation of these articles is the fact that I gave you three \nopportunities to google search it, none of which you took advantage of.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory has not been disproved.

The fact that \nthere's a hypothesis out there does not mean the hypothesis is true until \nit is demonstrated to be so, and as of now, the amount of evidence in favor \nof a big bang widely outweighs the evidence against it. The fact that \nthere's an article on the web that sells this story for more than it really \nis, just a proposition, and that you've taken that click hungry article's \nword on this (and technically speaking, you took it one step further by \ncalling this \"Disproving the Big Bang Theory\" when the article clearly \nstates \"MAY be completely wrong\") is very laughable.

The fact that anything and everything \ncan be disproved is one of the strong points of science. Every theory must \nbe disprovable, every idea capable of being questioned.\n\nUnless you actually intend to admit your fault here, I don't have any \ninterest in allowing you to comment further on this thread.

There is quite a bit of misinformation on Mormons in general \n(like the people who think they worship Joseph smith), and I'd guess a lot \nof it comes from ex-Mormon Christians trying to impress their Christian \nfriends with storytelling.\nConcerning the evidence you provided:\nI don't have any way to verify that your \"certain feeling\" was in fact not \na human emotion, or natural chemical reaction in the brain, and I don't \nthink you do either. Since you believe there to be supernatural forces, it \nseems highly likely that you could easily mislabel a human feeling as \ndivine.\nEverything picking back up where you left it doesn't seem like that big of \na miracle (unless time literally rewinded XD, but I don't think that's what \nyou're talking about).

Many people of different \nfaiths have similar, and more impressive stories about their religion, so \nif you're experience qualifies for proof of your religion, why doesn't \ntheirs?\n\nLet's go back to an earlier reply you gave me.

It's not that there are not truths in other \nchurches!..it's that the Mormons do have the fullness!\"\nYou did not answer the question here, you either purposefully, or \naccidentally dodged the question by saying something almost every religious \nperson would agree on. Other religious people would gladly agree that other \nchurches are correct to some degree. The question I asked was what reasons \nyou have to believe that this particular Christian denomination is correct \nas opposed to the thousands of others you haven't even had a chance to be \nexposed to?\nJust statistically speaking, the odds seem incredibly low that you would be \nborn into/Happened upon (Don't know if you're a convert or not) the correct \nchurch. It also seems very premature to assume that you've found the one \nfull truth, when we know that billions of people claim the exact same, or \nsimilar thing and that a person's religious affiliation is mostly dependent \non their geographical location. E.g. If you were born into a Muslim family \nin a Muslim majority country, It'd be extremely likely that you'd be a \nMuslim right now claiming the same thing about full truth you are right now.\nTo believe a claim as large as that, knowing that billions of people are \nclaiming a similar stance on several different premises, with their own \npersonal stories of faith. I don't know, I just feel like you should have a \nwhole lot more evidence than \"Things picking up where they left off\" before \nyou believe a claim as large as that.",

It's not that there are not \ntruths in other churches!..it's that the Mormons do have the fullness!  My \nmain focus is to debate the anti-Mormon Christians!  Of the anti-Mormon \nChristians that USED to be in ether the Mormon church or the Catholic \nchurch always say ''they got out!..and then found the truth!..or in other \nwords Jesus Christ!..in christian!  Which is just like protesting \nGorgoroth!..and then attesting Black Metal!  Watch the video ''Gorgoroth \nsign of an open eye.'' then tell me that they aint a G-D of Black Metal! \n To throw out Mormon or Catholic then attest christian is just like \nthrowing out Gorgoroth then attesting Black Metal!  You're not doing that I \nsuppose!  What you're talking about is not what I spend as much focus on! \n I mainly debate the anti-Mormon Christians!  Although once in a while I'll \ndebate ones who post what you post!  Ones who post what you post are rather \nuncommon!  I don't know for certain who is misinformed or who knows full \nwell what they're doing (the Tanners) in every single case when somebody \ncomments on Mormonism (Jesus Christ)!  I just shoot then ask questions \nlater!  I can be a bit diatribe!  I really tore up an Atheist here not long \nago!  But it's just that I know that the anti-Mormons are up to some pretty \nbad stuff!  So I might have tore up, hurt, offended some who are not behind \nit!  Not intending with full knowledge to do that of course!  So therefore \nI might have toned it down a little!  Now that that's out of the way since \nyou asked ''What is the VERY best evidence you have for it's truth?'' I'll \nsay this!  About 3 weeks after returning to church on 06/15/97 after many \nyears of inactivity I started to feel that certain feeling (not to be \nintertwined (confused) with some human emotion feeling)!  Around that same \ntime back in 97 EVERYTHING picked up right from where IT ALL left off from \nwhen I was a teenager to going back!  That is it was almost as if NOT even \nas much as a moment of time passed from when I was a teenager to going \nback!  But rather IT ALL picked up FROM where IT ALL LEFT OFF!  One who I \ndebated on this said something to the effect of ''but a memory of a past \nevent can bring things back to your memory banks!''  Ya but not like this! \n Two in the church spoke of having a similar experience after returning to \nchurch after many years of experience!  I just don't lose sight of it! \n Just this one example of what I'm talking about proves that that \nexperience back in 97 was of the divine!  I don't know if it's G-D, \nJehovah, or what it is!  But it's of the divine!  Not of Joseph Smith! \n Joseph Smith was just the prophet, seer, and Revelator!  ",

If you do not think there are any flaws to \natheism, then you have not really read any criticism. Do you want to open \nthat door? I am guessing you only want to make silly attacks.\n\nYou did not concede about my valid arguments about breaking laws of \nbehavior. Are people immoral for sentencing a murderer to death? I do not \nconcede? What is there to concede? You are claiming that you know morality \nbetter than God. How evil can you be? \n\nI said you cannot let a prostitute into your inner circle, without being \nimmoral. Befriending is less troubling, but troubling nonetheless. Do you \nthink politicians should hang out with liars, thieves, and prostitutes? Can \nyou swim in muddy waters and not get dirty? A psychologist will tell you \nthe behaviors of who you hang out with will pull you down. A law \nenforcement officer will tell you if you hang out with criminals you will \nbecome like them. Not in every instance obviously, but when talking about \nthe general population- certainly hanging around people of low morals \ncorrupts. And you defend otherwise? The only reason for doing so would be \nthat you are inherently immoral but yet you see yourself as a good person. \nSo does everybody else on the planet. If you interview prisoners, mostly \neveryone will tell you they are a good person. Do you agree with them, they \nare moral?\n\nAbout Noah, God cried because of the terrible wickedness of the people. God \nsaid it would have been better if man had not been created. That is pretty \nwicked. People tend to not have children the more selfish they are, there \nprobably was less children at that time to begin with. Children must have \nbeen pulled into the wickedness and taught to do it, but who knows. Maybe \nchildren were saved somehow, obviously we only have a few lines in the old \ntestament about a monumental event. The people were in constant murdering, \nwhoredoms, lying, enmity, selfishness, etc. I am not going to second guess \nexactly how or why God did what he did without knowing every detail. God's \nconsistent character for thousands of years recorded in scripture indicates \notherwise (and from my personal relationship with him). I also am not so \nproud as to tell God that he does not know morality, when one does not know \nthe character of God. \n\nAn interesting read this past week:   \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/eric-metaxas-science-increasingly-makes-the-case-for-god-1419544568?autologin=y",

What \nexactly is getting measured? Well, all good judges will tell you they must \nbalance justice with mercy. If you are too merciful to the perpetrator, you \nend up being mean to the victim and their family. God at times is merciful, \nand at times he must show the arm of justice. So why? Is a jury of 12 that \nconvicts a mass murderer guilty of killing? They are actually making the \ndecision to end his life. Are they acting immoral as a jury, as you are \nclaiming against God? The person who killed- knew the law, that it is wrong \nto kill, and he faced a punishment of death. We are told we will be judged \nout of the books that are written and that God's judgments are just. \n\nWhat one thing many today get so confused about is the order of seriousness \nof morality. Murder (not necessarily killing) is terribly wrong (if you \nknow law there are many different degrees of murder or killing). Now is it \nas wrong if you kill in self-defense? What about killing to stop someone \nfrom committing a terrible crime like genocide or terrorism? Now you are \nstarting to see some gray areas. We should not paint with such a broad \nbrush about what God does, or does not do, without fully understanding the \ncircumstances. I do not think you will disagree you are not familiar with \nscripture to any depth? God often acts to stop people in the peak of \nwickedness. It is an act of mercy to stop people from spiritual \ndestruction, which is much more harmful than physical destruction \n(eternally). Other crimes are terribly wrong because they are destructive \nto God designs for families (and spiritually). So sexual crimes are higher \non God's list than they are in our culture. Thanks mostly to the \nself-proclaimed \"sexual revolution\" of the sixties (rebellion against God). \nEven if the culture thinks immoral acts are okay, they are still an \nabomination to God, and we are individually and collectively accountable \nfor those sins. \n\nYou say I have an agenda. My agenda is truth. I am actually a doctoral \nstudent, and I have no employer. Nobody pays me for anything, I pay the \nuniversity for information. You also claim you are a tolerant person, but \nyou repeatedly insult and attack others personally. \n\nI do claim to be rational. The reason I have discussions like this is I \noften see atheists that claim they are the only rational person, and all \nreligions are irrational.

Sure, it's \neasy to find \"dirt\" on the mormon church online, but most of it is \nregurgitated nonsense from the infamous anti-mormons. \n\nI've gone through most of this stuff in my early twenties and it was a kind \nof tough process, but a necessary one. If you want to know what's up, you \nshould do an extensive reading into the history of the church and its (you \nknow, the church's) records, since they actually wrote down what happened \nand what people were doing back then. Just glancing over some websites \nonline doesn't do justice the discussion on the mormon faith. Just saying...\n\nAs to the translation of the Book of Mormon...the plates were given to \nJoseph Smith by an angel. What difference does it make that his initial \nmode of translation was odd? The seer stone was also used in ancient Hebrew \npractices. I mean, we're talking about an angel here, right? Doesn't that \nqualify bat skit crazy already? Moses parted the Red Sea and Noah road on \nan ark filled with every species of animals known to man (right?) and \nmormons are nut cases because we think crazy things didn't seize and desist \nafter Biblical times.

                    "text": "+NEW BRITANNIA it is funny to see how Jouko just ass raped you in your own \nfolly!\n\nHe had the right point and attitude troughout thus conversation while you \nbitched like a little teenager with a tantrum.\n\nI found it very hilarious when you said things like that Science has \nprooven false; then you gave list of so called doctrines, which science has \nrefuted, while ignoring the fact that theological issues or things like \nKolobs existance, cannot be refuted by science, at least not for the \nforeseeable future.\n\nI found it most ridiculous that you constantly bring out stuff about space \nstuff as our doctrine when none of those claims are doctrine.\n\nThere are plenty of speculation about doctrine but for you to lampoon those \nspeculations and to make them our official canonical doctrine is either, \nproof of your ignorance about mormonism, or proof of your dishonesty.\n\nMost Mormons I know don't believe that creation started 6000 years ago \nneither do our teaching manuals teach that.\n\nEven if we accept the existance of Adam and Eve, it is not maintained how \nall of human population started. Pearl of great price opens door for \nevolution as you should know if you are knowledgable about mormonism.\n\nYes we believe that life exists elsewhere in the universe and speculate \nwith that knowledge with real universe as far we understand. If that is \nridiculous to you, I don't care since I know there is God from personal \nexperience so I try to fit the data in to the real world as well as \npossible but never dare to claim that as doctrine or final word on the \nmatter. But you are using such investigations here as official mormon \ndoctrine, which they are not!\n\nI personally think that Adam and Eve came to a world where humans already \nexisted. I come to this conclusion without creating a dogma about it thus. \nBinbe clearly shows in the Genesis account that God commanded earth to \nbring forth grass, trees and animals while God created Adam himself. It \nsays that adam was placed in the Garden after he was created. Book of \nAbraham says that Gods prepared the warers to bring forth life; which to \nme, sounds evolutionary. Book of Mormon makes clear that before the fall, \nAdam and Eve actively partook of the tree of life before the forbiddwn \nfruit, which makes it clear that dearh came only because they were \nsepareted from the tree of life thus I understand that anything outside the \ngarden of Eden, could and would die before the fall thus making evolution \ncompatible with the scriptures at least in part.\nBrigham Young entertaines the idea that Adam would have been brought from \nanother world, even though this is not doctrine but speculation, I am \npartial to this theory.\nWe learned from the temple that tjere were people outside the garden and \nthat they were civilized enough to have monetary trade. Ancient people from \nSumer to Babylon also talk about these visitors from other worlds who \ntaught writing and civilizational skills and were larger than refular \npeople. Since Joseph Smith said that he saw in a vision Adam and Eve and \nthat they vere very large, I started to entertain the Idea that they were \nthe first watchers sent to earth as the Book of Enoch calls the Giants.\n\nMaybe their children mixed with the less sophisticated humans from earth \nand may have lived 900 years while their genes were more pute but declined \nin age as their genes were removed further and further from the \nGiants/watchers.\n\nThis is one theory but this theory is proof for me that your assumptions \nare no proof at all. There is a way around your \"scientific\" proof.\n\nProblem with you is that you are wholly dependent on what others, smarter \nand more educated than you, say; while I try to figure out for myself tjese \nthings. I do read books to learn facts from those who have laboured in the \ngiven field far longer, but far be it from me to start taking their \nopinions as authority in interpretation of my own life experience.\n\nThe flood is interesting since all major cultures from middle-east to China \nand Meso-america have a very similar Noah story taught which was \nindependent from the bible version with some variations of course. Whether \nthe flood was local or global is irrelevant to me, all around the world \nprimitive sociaties knew it though. Church haven't turned the flood stort \ninto a dogma. Baptism of the world is an assumption based on spiritual \nvalues and not rebelation from God but I am willing to believe the whole \nworld was engulfed but I am not a bit moved if contrary could be proven \nsince that has no doctrinal necessity for me as it might be for you.\n\nThe fact that Enichs city was taken to God is not the same as space, and \ndoesn't necessitate that all the buildings were taken too, it may have been \nthe people only. It is assumed that the whole city with buildings was taken \nbut nothing forces that interpretation. There's no revelation claiming that \nthe city is flying in the space somewhere. If it was, there's no quarantee \nthat you could find it anyway with your telescopes since big asteroids are \nmany times noticed by nasa just before they pass the earth quite closely. \nEnoch's city would be far smaller than those asteroids but why should I \ndefend a point that I, nor the church even teaches as truth.\n\nFor you to make such a long list of science claims to refute Mormonism when \nin fact, we are quite open on all of those issues, makes it clear that you \nare desperate to demonise us when you have to turn into space stories and \nfanrasies. Bye the way, how has science prooven false the seer stone \nstory???\nHow could it ever be prooven false???\n\nIt is sad if Mormonthink is your only source in understanding mormonism. \nYou could also go to http://fairlds.org they have pretty much responded to \nall claims that mormonthink makes. might broaden your horizon to chexk that \nout.\n\nBye the way, if you read the book of mormon, you would know that there was \nno skin color changing; it happened teoughout generations. Children of the \nnephites would change their color if they mixed with lamanites but if \nlamanites mixed with the nephites their next generation would be whiter \nagain and concerning the future of the lamanites who would join the \ncovenant people it says that not many generations would pass untill they \nwould be white. This being ifcourse both spiritual and genetical. Being a \nnephite would make them part of God's covenant people and as a nephite \ntheir children would be white when muxing with nephites for generations \nthus not many generations would pass untill they would be white as the \nnephites again.\n\nThe faxt that you didn't know this while claiming to be a huge mormon \nexpert, says much against your pretensions.\n\nBut I got to watch some falling skies with my wife so peace and out!",

Not only \nthat, it was fun! Thanks for that. \n\nI couldn't but notice the slightly sarcastic tone in your short novel...was \nthat perhaps intentional? I mean, why be so pissed of about God living in \nKolob (unless your just jealous. I know I am!) and having like 10 million \nwives? And also, what's wrong with God having a working genitalia? Man, I'm \nglad mines ok. Besides, how would you picture God being if we, the human \nrace, are fashioned after him?\n\nLook, I get it. You are one of those science guys. You like your primordial \nooze and billions of years of development time. That's fine. Who's denying \nany of that? But, why so serious? Lighten up, buddy. Scriptures aren't \nscience books and they certainly don't profess to be such. Neither do they \nascribe to dogmas created by different faiths and movements. I think you're \nmissing the point here (which should be pretty clear if you really think \nthat the Garden Of Eden and the story of the Fall happened exactly how the \nscriptures depict them) and letting something pointless ruin a perfectly \ngood thing for you. I mean, none of what you said really even fits what the \nLDS church teaches. None of it. Some people have those ideas and there are \nthese myths and traditions floating around, but no one knows for sure. And \ndoes it really matter? Reading the Book of Mormon the only thing God wants \nhis servants to do right now is to preach repentance and faith in Jesus \nChrist. That's all because in the end that is all that really matters. \nRight now you're flying around the center of the Milky Way focusing on \nnubile ladies and celestial genitalia. Focus, buddy.\n\nSo far science has not unearthed anything that I would consider evidence \nagainst my faith. I'm not joking about this. You talk about DNA as if it's \nsomething that would do away with God, when it's something that shows the \nbrilliant design of life on this planet. Sure, it is a matter of \nperspective really, but why take the negative side? You like being the \nparty pooper? You know they just discovered that the DNA is far more \ncomplex than originally thought. I guess the human Genome isn't mapped \nafter all. Not only that, but apparently there is now evidence that genes \ndo not dictate what and who we are, but rather, we can change our genes \nduring our life. Insane? Pretty sweet in my opinion. It just goes to show \nthat science is hardly ever the final word on anything, since it keeps \nre-defining itself on an annual (or even faster) rate. I don't discount \nscience because of it. I just don't let the current trends sway my \nconvictions. \n\nIn the end what really matters is the testimony that is available for \neveryone. Uuuhhh....you know where I'm going with this one. Time to take \nout the medicine! But hey, at least I have this experience that I know to \nreal. I don't have to doubt or rummage through  discussion forums and books \nfor answers that I already have. I don't have to take someone else's word \nfor \"evidence\" one way or the other. I know there is a God (Bam!). I know \nlife goes on after this one (Wham!), and I know what is really important in \nthis life. Doesn't mean I act accordingly, but I try. You don't have to \nbelieve me (I doubt you would, although I think I can be pretty persuasive) \nand I have no interest in bashing this into your head. When it really comes \nto it, I don't have to. Do yourself a favour and find out for yourself.\n\nPick up the Book of Mormon and drop the tinfoil hat in the garbage bin. \nKill off every prejudice you might have about the church and the religion \nand read sincerely. Forget science and all the little things you've read \nonline about horse bones, steel, and whatnot. Those are distractions that \nare not meant to build you, but tear down. It doesn't make you smarter. It \ndumbs you down to the level of all those people, who expect someone else to \ndo the work of figuring things out for them. Of all the claims made agains \nthe Book of Mormon and the church, have you actually verified the source \nand read the real quotes? Nobody does, because it takes effort. Well, \nfinding God takes effort too. You can waste your time reading negative \ncomments about a subject people have very little understanding of, or you \ncan do the smart thing and find out for yourself. This actually works. It \nworked with me and it has worked with most of the people that I know. It's \nthe craziest thing and you'll feel so bad-ass afterwards, but if you don't \nact on it, it will do nothing for you. A month later the experience will \nbecome something your deranged brain created for your fevered mind and \nyou'll explain it away like the smart little chap that you are. I'm not \nmocking or making fun of you. It's just that I know what I am taking about \ndue to personal experience. When people think they're being smart, they're \ngenerally being real asses and missing out on some pretty awesome things. \nThat's me right there.\n\nAnyway, do what you will. In the end, it won't matter to me. You're just \nsome guy online replying to a post I didn't think anyone would even notice. \nBut don't run around taking smack about the church unless you've at least \ngiven a real effort at reading the Book of Mormon. That's where it's all at.\n\nPeace",

Look, if you consider anti-mormon literature \nnot fabrications, revisionist, or for the most part utter nonsense, I don't \nknow where to go with you. I mean, you have to be a little biased to \nconsider their writings more honest or objective than what the church has \nproduced.\n\nAside from that, why is it that you have to always go for the Kolob and \nother obscure mormon legends? Is that like your death blow? \"Mormons are \nsilly because they think God lives on this planet called Kolob.\" Another \nclassic \"Joe Smith put his head inside a hat and translated the plates like \nthat.

Kolob, the star closest to God's seat (not the planet God \nlived in. For some reason you people always get that wrong). That's great. \nThat's like BattleStar Galactica and the planet Kobol, and you know that \nshow was awesome. \n\nAnother cool thing, Joseph Smith was translating a book with his eyes shut. \nWell, you wouldn't know since his head was stuffed inside a hat, but \nthere's no way he could see anything. It's like \"look mom, I'm riding \nwithout my hands!\" only in his case it was like \"Look Cowdery, I'm not \nusing my flippin' eyes!\". Crazy, right? I bet Cowdery was going crazy about \nit too. Oh wait, what was Oliver doing there in the first place? Scheming \nwith Joseph of course.

What will they say about me? Oh yeah, I probably won't care \nsince I'll be DEAD and will have ceased to EXIST. Science says I can take \nthat to the bank!\n\nOh well, Kolob sounds pretty cool though. So did polygamy, but I guess that \nwon't happen now...unless..wait. I know! The whole gay marriage thing is \nall but settled now (congrats!), so the next thing we should lobby for is \nto have multiple wife's/husbands (you know, for the sake of equality). \nHells YES! I think people have been ready for this for a bit now. I mean, \npolygamy is just a step up from what's happening at your company christmas \nparty, long road trips, spring break etc.Kind of like making it all \nofficial (and owning up to what you do, but nobody wants to talk about \nthat). \n\nMan, this thing could actually work out. Also, since America is going in \nthe way of socialism, although not traditional socialism, but rather \ncorporate socialism, we could fix the whole thing with the law of \nconsecration. Even the 1% will be ok with it, I mean with a tax rate of a \nflat 10% for everyone, who would complain? I know I wouldn't! Still, you do \nhave a point when it comes to omissions, revision, and flat out lying. I \nmean, who can you trust if you can't trust your church ? Well, your \nfriendly neighbourhood anti-mormon, of course! I tell you, they are the \nvery embodiment of virtue and honesty, fact checking, and information \ndigging. No subjective ,story-twisting reporting here!\n\nRight. I can't believe I actually wrote this whole thing while watching the \nLinux Action Show. Hey, you should feel accomplished.

They tell me they remove your \nname as soon as the request comes in from the Stake President which he \nsends once he concludes an interview with you in person or via telephone. \nDid you speak with him yet? That is a necessary step. Once you do that, it \nis a minor administrative action for him to send in the paper work and you \nare history. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, to substantiate my point, just go to the April \nConference statistical report and add the totals.  For instance, this past \nApril 2014 General Conference, church membership for the previous year, \n2013, was reported as follows:  \n\nTotal Membership    15,082,028\n\nNew Children of Record   115,486\n\nConverts Baptized       282,945\n\nThen you also need the totals from the previous years statistical report \nwhich says:\n\nTotal Membership:  14,782,473\n\nNow using a calculator you can add 282,945 converts baptized and \nthe 115,486 children of record baptized to the previous years total and you \nget a total of 15,180,904, which is larger than the reported 15,082,028. \n The difference of 98,876 is how many records were purged from church \nrecords last year.  That is about 1/3 of the number baptized into the \nChurch. So you see the church is still growing substantially and doing so \nwithout counting those who leave. When you are finally ready to come back, \nas my sister-in-law was a few years ago, you will have the opportunity to \nbe re-baptized. ",

Protection from bodily harm is *not* one of the \npromises. I've heard members tell stories of someone they knew who was \nsaved from injury because of wearing the temple garment, but it was not the \ngarment that saved them, it was either happenstance, luck, or God.\n\n*Baptism for the dead:*   When a person is baptized in behalf of someone \nwho is dead (known as 'proxy baptism'), the act does not automatically make \nthe dead person a member of the church. LDS believe that the person has the \nchoice of accepting or rejecting the ordinance that was performed on their \nbehalf. They decide, not us.\n\nFurthermore, there is nothing arrogant about proxy baptisms in the church. \nIt's not the haphazard act your tone seems to indicate. All proxy baptisms \nare done at the request of  a living member who is a direct relative of the \nperson being baptized for. For the relative who requested the ordinance, it \nis a very special deed that is being performed.\n\n*Have a good holiday season!*",

Sometimes God waits for us to ask before He \nopens up and explains things. Joseph Smith was an asker. Everything he \nlearned about polygamy came as a result of honest inquiry.  When he prayed, \nhe did not stop with uttering the Lord's Prayer.  He spoke openly to God. \n He asked.  God gave.  It is a pretty simply process explained by Jesus in \nMatthew 7:7  \n\n Sometimes God speaks and we don't take notice, or it doesn't get recorded, \nor it gets recorded but doesn't get passed on.  Or some things the Lord \nteaches and man just losses them. Who can say what Abraham knew?  All we \ncan say is God had no problem with his four wives.  He had no problem with \nit whatsoever. If it was wrong, he blessed Him for it.  If it was right, he \nblessed him for it. That is the extent of our knowledge.\n\nHowever if Abraham had just slept with those women rather than marrying \nthem, then you can be sure God would have a problem with it.

It is a gathering of \ninspired writings of God's prophets in every dispensation of the Gospel. \nOften circumstances change and the Lord speaks to his prophets to deal with \nthe circumstances. The Bible has many instances of this. If you were \nwilling to accept the Gospel of Paul that had living prophets who recorded \ntheir dealings with God, then you would know that God is still speaking \nthrough prophets today and when you turn off his dissemination of His \ndealings with man in our day, you sever your tie to Him.\n\nWould Noah ever have built the arc if God had not commanded him to do so? \n No.  It was not in his Bible as having happened before.  Did he stop and \nsay, wait God, you never asked anyone else to do this so I cannot believe \nit is really you who are speaking to me.  Instead, He knew who was speaking \nand he moved to the saving of all his house.  \n\nWhat of Moses? Would he have ever gone back to Goshen to get the children \nof Israel if God had not told him to?  No. It was not in the Bible of his \nday, because his situation was unique.  But he did not refuse to go lead \nthe people because it was not previously recorded that any man should have \ndone that.\n\nWhen God commanded Joseph Smith to practice plural marriage, Joseph Smith \nwasn't interested - he didn't want to do it.  He ran from it, just like \nJonah ran from what the Lord had asked of him.  It was not until the angel \ncame again and said he needed to do it or be destroyed that he went ahead \nwith it. \n\nAre you aware that we have not practiced plural marriage for several \ngenerations in our faith? Again that change was due to living prophets. So \nif you want to join our church to have multiple wives then you are going to \nbe disappointed. \n\nI don't think I have ever said that only perfect people will be in heaven. \nWe are all sinners. My true point was that God does not look upon the \ncorrect practice of plural marriage when with as much abhorrence as we \nhumans do. I wondered if you know why he would designate polygamists as the \nideal?   (see Matt 8:11)  What are we missing?  \n\nObviously you want to try to get your peeps to judge Joseph Smith and \nBrigham Young from their understanding rather than from God's \nunderstanding, but at the same time you seem to believe, if they were doing \nwrong, that God can surely forgive them as he did Abraham, whom he loved. \nDo I have that correct?",

                "text": "The LDS church has a universal curriculum designed to indoctrinate children \nso that they have a deep sense of loyalty to, and dependence on church \ndoctrine and hierarchy. There is a powerful psychological mechanism that \nteaches that questioning doctrine, or church authority figures is actually \nquestioning God, and His will. Obviously (and intentionally) this \nindoctrination occurs well before children have the cognitive ability to \nmake the kind of historical and fact distinctions which would question the \nvalidity of the LDS church, such as those referenced in this video.\n\nEven when these children get older and have the capacity to recognise \nproblems with the LDS Church, it is emotionally painful for them to do so. \nIt is not a mistake that Hans says \"It was a terrible psychological and \nnearly physical disturbance\". The reason he says this is because the Mormon \nchurch has calculated a curriculum designed to indoctrinate children (and \nanyone else that it can) such that pulling away from that indoctrination is \ntheir own emotional Hell.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. Believer will defend. Non-believers will be \nin disbelief that someone could believe something so obviously logically \ninconsistent. Perhaps the real question is how a grown man (seemingly well \nintentioned), for years, was unable to see the obvious issue with his \nreligion, and then when he tried to honestly and factually confront that \nreligions history and truth claims, it wasn't just a matter of sorting out \nthe details, but of going through emotional trauma.\ufeff",

To have a testimony of the calling and work of Joseph Smith is a \ngreat blessing that I cherish. Talking to you I get an idea of what a rare \nand blessed thing that is, and I am very humbly grateful. \n\nBut I think you probably believe correctly, as the Mormons do, that the \nform of Jesus was the true form of God, so you must obviously also agree \nthat God's true form is the form of a human Homo-Sapien. So we will go with \nthat unless I have misstated, in which case you can try to correct me. \n Would you agree that God has a face - (Gen 32:30), eyes \u2013 (Deuteronomy \n11:12), hands \u2013 (Isaiah 62:3), fingers \u2013 (Exodus 8:19), arms \u2013 (Isaiah 40:10), \nheart (Ezekiel 28:6), legs \u2013 (Genesis 28:13) and experiences love \u2013 (1 John \n4:10), pride \u2013 (2 Peter 1:17), humility \u2013 (John 3:16), mercy \u2013 (Ex. 20:6), \njustice \u2013 (Ps. 89:14) and choice \u2013 (1 Corinthians 1:27)?  So believing \nallof this you must also now believe that God created man in his own image: \n(Gen. 1:27).  Yes, and we have all of these attributes as well. \n\n\nAs to your questions, I answered this sometime back, but since you \ncompletely missed that, and since you have proven yourself clueless of the \nfacts in all of your queries, I would love to answer these again for you. I \ndon't mind at all. \n\nFirst of all there is not court testimony of Martin Harris testifying his \nwitness of the Gold plates was not a real viewing of the gold plates, nor \ndid he testify to something he was not present to, such as the testimony of \nthe other two witnesses and the eight witnesses. They don\u2019t let people \ntestify to things for which they do not have personal knowledge. That would \nbe overruled as hearsay.  I am not sure if you even realize that Martin \nHarris was not present when the eight witnesses handled the gold plates, \nnor was he present when the other two of the three witnesses had their \nvisitation. In reality, they all affirmed their individual testimony of the \nplates to their death. Martin Harris did as well. \nFor more of Martin Harris I really think you owe it to yourself to read \nthis well documented account, complete with all the references: \nhttp://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/MHarris.html\nIf any part of what I have just shared with you in the spirit of love is in \nerror, would you kindly quote from the court record and offer us a \nreference so we can check it out.\n\nI am not sure you can provide such, so allow me to offer Martin Harris \nactual words from his deathbed after coming back to the true church of \nJesus Christ. Martin Harris proclaimed this actual quote, not hearsay from \na third party. Said he: \u201cnever forget what I shall say. The Prophet, Oliver \nCowdery, David Whitmer and myself went into a little grove to pray to \nobtain a promise that we should behold it with our own eyes. That we could \ntestify of it to the world. We prayed two or three times and at length the \nangel stood before Oliver and David and showed them the plates. But behold \nI had gone by myself to pray and in my desperation I asked the Prophet to \nkneel down with me and pray for me that I may also see the plates. And we \ndid so and immediately the Angel stood before me and said, \u201cLook\u201d and when \nI glanced at him I fell but I stood on my feet and saw the Angel turn the \ngolden leaves over and I said, \u201cIt is enough my Lord and my God.\u201d Then I \nheard the voice of God say the Book is true and translate correctly!\u201d  \n\n\nNext you confuse me. You say people lived in Virginia 12,000 years ago, or \n6000 years before Adam. Is that really why you don\u2019t believe God created \nman in His Own Image, because man was already here? Wow.\n\nAnd do you seriously believe there is no evidence of people living in the \nAmericas prior to Columbus?  Go watch Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cApocalypto\u201d to jog your \nmemory.\n\nAnd as far as preservation of antiquities, what is a better preservative, a \nfreezer or a humid heatlamp?  Dah, no wonder things preserve better in the \nNorth than around the equator where atrophy and rot are accelerated by a \nfactor of 200 times faster.\n\nOn to your alleged pedophilia. Have you ever wondered why no one ever \nbrought Joseph to court for such a heinous crime as this would be if he \nwere guilty. They brought him to court for every other possible infraction. \nSo why not pedophilia? Perhaps no one was as judgmental as you are in a \ndifferent day and age.  So, are you saying that the laws of Illinois \nactually encouraged pedophilia by making the legal marriageable age 14? \n That\u2019s right. Look it up.  It was totally legal. \n\nOn to your next misunderstanding. \nI have previously shared with you how the entire Nauvoo City Council voted \nto destroy the Expositor by right of their approved Illinois town charter, \nand how Joseph Smith as Mayor was authorized by the Town Council to order \nthe destruction of that press, and how the city council, (not all of whom \nwere Mormons) executed the approved destruction of the paper and press \nwithout fanfare, noise or tumult. However, since Francis Higbee, one of the \npaper\u2019s obnoxious owners, made a complaint against multiple individuals \nincluding Joseph Smith, the city council and other leading city officers \nbefore a justice of the peace in Carthage, the complaint was specifically \nfor \u201ccommitting a riot\u201d by destroying the paper and the press, JS and \nothers were summoned to answer those charges. A municipal court met and \nheld a preliminary hearing in which they heard arguments for and against. \nAfter deliberating they decided that Joseph Smith had acted under proper \nauthority of the Nauvoo City Council, that his orders were carried out \nwithout unnecessary disturbance, and that the complaint filed was nothing \nmore than a malicious prosecution by Francis Higbee. They thereby released \nJoseph Smith and his associates and charged the court costs to Francis \nHigbee. However this municipal court was the Nauvoo municipal court, and \neven though this was a legal right under their writ of habeas corpus, many \nwere extremely angry about it.  Think Furguson of modern day.\n\nThis infuriated a citizens group in the neighboring towns of Warsaw and \nCarthage who wanted blood, Josephs blood, and they began calling for the \nextermination of the Mormons. Threats were escalating to the point that the \nMormons wrote to the Governor and explained the situation. They also \nconsulted with the state circuit judge, Jesse B. Thomas, about an \nappropriate course of action to follow to stay the crowd of onlookers. He \nadvised that although the arraignment was a legal one, it may not have been \nthe most appropriate if they wanted to appease a mob mentality and he \nsuggested that only a full trial of the case before a non-Mormon judge \nwould satisfy the mob.  To that end the Mormons were brought to trial \nbefore a non-Mormon justice named Daniel H. Wells. This time the outcome \nwas no different. The justice heard the arguments and then gave the \nprisoners a judgment of acquittal.  The mob was even more incensed now. \n How could a non-Mormon judge be so blind? This added insult to injury. \nFinally the Governor interceded and said nothing short of a trial before \nthe justice in Carthage who hated the Mormons would do. Such a trial of \n\u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d was totally unconstitutional, as was a trial amongst \nbitter enemies.  The case had already been fairly tried. Yet to his credit, \nJoseph Smith agreed to be tried yet again to appease the governor and the \nmob, but by now it was obvious that the mob would stop at nothing but to \nsee him killed. Yet in spite of this, he voluntarily came in from another \nstate to stand trial again in the midst of his sworn enemies. He was not \ncaptured, he surrendered. At the preliminary hearing for his third trial \nfor the same offense a bail of $500 was set for each defendant, and the \nbail was met. The mob did not want Joseph freed. They wanted him where they \ncould get to him. They were not ever interested in a fair trial. So \nimmediately after being released on bail, another dubious charge was \nassessed of Joseph specifically, this time it was treason against the state \nof Illinois, made by a mob member, for Joseph having declared martial law \nin Nauvoo to defend Nauvoo and its citizens against the very mob he was a \npart of, as was their right. How ridiculous is that? So this accusation of \ntreason is what JS was being held on in Carthage Jail, because this charge, \nno matter how false, made no allowance for bail. This is how the mob was \nable to hold him in jail so they could kill him, it was not for the \nexpositor episode. \n\nNow that is more than you wanted to know, but it is important to \nunderstand. JS had already been acquitted of wrongdoing in the Expositor \ndestruction by a non-Mormon Justice, but evil men cannot stand for a \nprophet to tell them to repent. Do you understand that?\n\nNow as to JS killing anyone during the martyrdom, you are ridiculously \ntaking the words of a Mormon who says that \u201che had heard\u201d that someone had \ndied from wounds at the jail. Is that not the case? This is not evidence \nthat anyone died. He did not say he witnessed someone die, nor that any \ncoroner said someone had died. He said \u201che had heard\u201d this amongst all of \nthe other things people were saying, none of which need have any basis in \ntruth. Of course people will say what they want, but that demonstrates \nnothing. All three of the wounded men were charged in Joseph\u2019s murder, even \nthe two supposed dead men.  How is that possible?  If they were dead, why \nwere they subpoenaed to appear in court, do you think?  Any wild guesses? \nAfter being subpoenaed these three men all fled the state to avoid \nprosecution. Dead men don\u2019t run and hide. An eyewitness to the murders, \nJeremiah Willey, said that \"*John Wills, Gallaher (a man whose first name \nhas fallen out of the historical record), and William Voras were among the \nmen that broke into the jail room.  Willey reported that Gallaher shot \nJoseph Smith in the back as he ran to the window. Wills, Gallaher, and \nVoras all received wounds when they were shot through the cell door by \nJoseph Smith.*\" \nhttp://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/carthage/carthageaccount.html\nHow different was their cowardice from the bravery exhibited by JS in \nwalking into his deathbed boldly, as a lamb to the slaughter. Joseph did \nfire three shots in defense of his friends. Good for him. DO you think he \nwas a much better shot than they were to take out three men with three \nshots, while they shot 500 rounds to kill two.  \n\n\n\nJust check out this site that I have found quite helpful. \nhttp://www.omninerd.com/articles/The_1826_Trial_of_Joseph_Smith_Jr  \n\nHow many Gods are there?  I have no idea. Paul says there are Gods many. I \nagree with him. But to us there is but one God. That is what we believe. We \nbelieve it makes no difference how many gods there are because no God has \nany authority or power in our lives except God the Father. That is why God \nsays there are no other Gods, because to us there are not. To us there is \nbut one God, the Father.\n\nI have read most every change in the Book of Mormon. Outside of correcting \nthe printed word to reflect the hand-written manuscript, all changes add \nclarification. The changes help us to not misunderstand nor misinterpret \nwords that have multiple meanings. For instance, the change from \u201cGod\u201d to \n\u201cSon of God\u201d. Both are correct, but the passage is specifically speaking of \nthe Son, and people like you might misconstrue it. \n\nI have watched several of Earl\u2019s videos. Which one are you hoping I will \ncomment on?  Will you read my rebuttal of what he says?  Earl did not have \na very good understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and still doesn\u2019t. \nDo you think maybe he could tell me what God\u2019s true form is?  Nope, he is \nas clueless as others I have written to.\n\nHave a great Sabbath. Lets continue this discussion. The more factual your \nunderstanding of Joseph Smith the clearer will be your views and the more \nyou will appreciate that just like our Savior Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith \nwas also lied about. Now, with your improved understanding, you cannot ever \nagain say you think Joseph Smith killed anyone, or was ever guilty of being \na conman, or was considered in his day to be a pedophile. The truth shows \nJoseph Smith was as he taught, a prophet of God. May God bless you to take \na more honest look at the work of the restoration in our day.\n\nMormons make such wonderful human beings because of what Joseph Smith \ntaught them of God and His purpose for us, His children.",

Will you answer my questions now?  You're gonna look pretty dodgy if \nyou don't!\n\nHow do you feel about the lack of actual witnesses (Remember, Martin Harris \ntestified in court that neither he nor any of the other \"11\" had seen the \ngolden plates with their eyes.  They hefted a covered box and had visions.  \nThat's it)?  If I said, \"Trust me, there's a huge gold bar in this heavy \nbox, give me a 1000 bucks and it's yours, BUT, you can't look in the box.\", \nwhat would you say? \"Pound sand.\"? WHY?!?!?!? would you be any less \nskeptical when your ETERNAL SOUL is at stake?!?!  That's just crazy!  Would \nyou even buy a car, or ANYTHING, sight unseen?  The Bible has been proven \nover and over, even by secular historians.  I can GO to Jerusalem, they are \nexcavating Jonah's Ninevah, so many cities of the Bible are still in \nexistence, and archaeological proof has been found of many more, right \nwhere the Bible says they would be.  The Bible has MAPS! that concur with \nmaps of secular historians of the age, and events that are documented in \nthe Bible are found elsewhere.  The BoM has NONE of that.   ZERO, ZIP, \nZILCH, NADA,NIL,NEIN, NEGATIVE!!!  Don't you think if the huge \ncivilizations reported in the BoM actually existed, SOMETHING would have \nbeen found by now?  A chariot wheel, a sword, pottery, ruins, trash dumps, \nANYTHING?!?!?!  People are messy, dude.  That's why, all over the world, \nwhen even small groups live somewhere, the leave crap behind.  We've found \narrowheads in Virginia made by peoples who arrived from France toward the \nend of the last ice age, even though it's thought only very few early \nAmericans arrived that way, 12000 YEARS AGO!.  See what I mean?  If \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of peeps were here just 2000 years ago, \nbuilding great cities and having huge wars, we'd have TONS OF PROOF and \nartifacts, literally.  We wouldn't have NONE!!!  Again, I know you have a \ngood brain, you have to apply it to matters of faith as well.  Moving on...\n\nHow do you feel about JS's pedophilia, by ONE of his 14 year old brides own \nwritings, she did NOT want to marry almost-40-year-old-JS, and only finally \nagreed to do it when her father begged her, after JS promised that she and \nher family would be guaranteed Mormon's highest heaven.  Pedophiles are \nnotoriously creative in what they offer their victims to subdue resistance, \nbringing her daddy into it is particularly cruel, imo.\n\nHow do you feel about JS (Per the church's OWN HISTORY BOOKS!!) murder of \ntwo men and wounding of a third while he attempted his escape from jail.  \nIf he was a noble martyr, why didn't he just turn himself over to justice \nand let those with him be freed?  Do you deny he ordered the destruction of \nthe newspaper and printing press that told truths about him?\n\nHow many gods do YOU believe in?  Was this earth's god's father a god? His \ngrampa?  What kind of sin did this earth's god commit when he was a man?  \nHow many wives does he have now?\n\nWhat do you think about the VERY significant changes that have been made to \nthe BoM since the original version (like changing references to Jesus as \n\"Eternal God\" to \"SON of the Eternal God\", BIG DIFF, that's just one) AND \nthe temple ceremonies (no more cutting off heads or disembowelments, taken \nSTRAIGHT from the Masons, btw)?  How are translations, etc. being sent \ndirectly from God, and the \"most correct book on earth\" subject to such \nsignificant revisions?\n\nJust direct answers, like I gave you, would be awesome, we've chased enough \nrabbits, I want to know how you reconcile these very serious faults in your \nbeliefs.  If you would even actually answer even ONE of the questions, I'll \nleave you alone.  Did you ever watch Earl Erskine?  I know you don't want \nto answer that one, it's hard to refute the testimony of a heart-broken \ntemple Mormon who has been to hell and back trying to salvage his faith of \n60 years, and has finally come to the realization that it's all just lies, \nhalf-truths, obfuscations and rules.  A man who, even in his heart-break, \nis still that bishop, and feels compelled to tell others what his years of \ntruth seeking has uncovered, in the hopes that they too might come to see \nthat there is a real God, there is a real Jesus, there is a real Holy \nSpirit, and if they have the courage to leave the LDS church, their lives \nwill never be the same, and they will have a relationship with God they \nnever knew possible.

NOBODY else was WRITING \nscripture in the 19th century.  The reason 17th Century English was the \nscriptural vernacular is because the Bible was TRANSLATED in the 17th \nCentury.  Now, why would somebody living in the 19th Century \"translate\" \nhis book into vernacular that nobody had actively spoken in several \ngenerations?  The answer is MARKETING.  People are more likely to \"buy\" \nscriptural claims if they stylistically match already existing \nscripture...which is itself devoid of empirical support, by the way.\n\nAs for Native Americans' being, \"born of Egyptian gentile (woman),\" I'll \ngrant that the Human Genome Project and others like it have concluded that \nALL modern humans are descended and evolved from Central/North African \nancestors.  However, unless you can provide evidence, such as links to \npeer-reviewed Historical and/or Scientific research, then your claim of \nEgyptian gentile ancestry is false, as are your claims of Jewish DNA among \nNative American populations...and for the same reason.\n\nIn any discussion or debate, the one who claims, \"This IS,\" or, \"This \nexists,\" is the one who carries the burden of proof.  You want me to \nbelieve?  Fine.  Furnish evidence that corroborates the Book of Mormon OR \nthe Bible.  The only condition is that, as the rules of logic dictate, \nscripture cannot be self-affirming.  Corroboration must come from \nNON-scriptural sources.  I'll be genuinely happy to check out any relevant \nlinks you'd care to post.\n\nAs for the alleged Book of Abraham, when countless people who have \ndedicated their lives to the study of a particular subject say the \nconclusions of somebody with NO formal study of the subject matter are \nutterly erroneous, I'm inclined to believe the experts.  Either \nthose experts are all wrong, OR Joseph Smith was a gifted fantasy author.  \nI believe option #2, and if we were talking about anybody BUT Joseph Smith \nYOU would, too.  However, as discussed above, if you'd care to present \nevidence...other than that which Agrippa The Mighty has already \nrebutted...then I'd love to be as educated as possible about the subject.\n\nJust remember that the rules of logic prohibit acceptance of, \"The book is \ntrue because it says so in the book.\"",

Is it the fact that no Native American tribe's \noral or written histories uphold the claims within the Book of Mormon?

Their \n\"fruit\".\nWhat \"fruit\"?\n1. Women being forced to practice polygamy under THREAT of \"destruction\".\n2. Designation of women as mere chattel\n(\"cows\" as prophet Brigham called them)\nand as baby factories--not allowed to pray in church til 1957 AND not \nallowed to make their own decisions in their OWN ORGANIZATION...the Relief \nSociety.\n3. Banning blacks from PH based on skin color alone. (OH! That's right! LDS \nInc.\nA L L O W E D  them to be members!!\nHow generous and God-like.\nHoly SH**!!  I was wrong!! I'm going BACK to Mormonism just based on that \nWONDERFUL and MARVELOUS point alone!!---HA!!)\n4.  Calling all other churches \"corrupt and abominable\" and \"The Whore of \nthe EARTH\"!!\n(As angry as Jesus was with the Pharisees he never called the Jewish \nreligion those names.)\n5. Marrying little girls and other men's wives (polyandry). Where is the \nokay by God for polyandry found in D&C 132??\n6. Destruction of an ICON of Liberty, Freedom and the American way, and in \ncontravention to the Bill of Rights, Smith ordered the Expositor \nNewspaper destroyed.\n7. Using smuggled guns (against the law) at Carthage to shoot 3 people.\n8. Smith LYING to Emma, the members and the community claiming to only have \none wife when he had over 30 at the time of this LIE---a public statement \nmade by Smith a month before his death.\n9. Lying about the \"translation\" process of the BoM (head in hat). \nBut...hey! That lie stood the test of time, didn't it?--about 180 \nyears!! Head in hat was just recently admitted to by the \n\"brethren\"---but...LDS Inc. has yet to ditch the lying pictures depicting \notherwise!\n10.  Lying to investors in his Kirtland Bank scam and losing several \npeople's life savings in the process. Why? Because those idiot investors \nTRUSTED Joe Smith--the \"arm of flesh\" warned about in scripture.\n11.  Lying to the American Indians, telling them they are of Israelite \n(Jewish) origins.\n12.  Instructing missionaries to not answer hard questions, but to answer \nthe questions \"they SHOULD have asked\". (Dishonest a'holes!)\n\nI could go on.\nThere's AT LEAST a hundred more \"fruit\" of Mormonism showing the fraud it \nis...but...I won't. If you're not convinced by these dozen examples you \nwon't be even if I added the other 100!\n\nGet a life, Justin.\nYou can start by leaving Mormonism.\nYou will sooner or later. Might as well get a jump on the crowd...now.",

Your tithes go to MEN, who buy nice cars massive houses, \nmultiple cars, multiple houses, Mega-churches to gather megabucks from the \nrich folk who dress well and gather to be REWARDED WITH CASH for giving to \nthe Mega-church pastors. \n\nThere is a test of one's faith in paying tithes to UNPAID elders of Israel \nversus well paid professional interpreters of scripture. The tithes we \ndonate build churches and temples, your tithes build envy, resentment, \nhatred, mansions for the pastors, egos and a yellow brick road to Hades. We \ndon't NEED the LORD to make us wealthy, and if he does we are prepared for \nthe law beyond the tithe, if we are ever righteous enough to receive it.\n\nSeek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things \nshall be added unto you.

But these statistics belie the truth.\nAlthough 90-95% of Americans say they believe in God, most of them have a \nfaith that can only be described as extremely shallow.\nAfter World War II, 87% of those questioned said that they were absolutely \ncertain of God's existence (15). By 1964, the portion with no doubts had \nfallen to 77% of the population, and by 1981, to 62% (16).\nIn 1990, six out of seven said that it is okay not to believe in God (17).\nThe consensus that Jesus is God is also misleading. Many fewer now believe \nthat it is necessary to accept Jesus in order to be saved. In 1964, a bare \nmajority, 51%, still believed that Jesus is the only way. But the same \nmeasure slumped to 38% by 1981 (18). Since then, the measure must have \nslumped further.\nTwenty years ago, 70% identified the Bible as the word of God, but about \nthree sevenths of these also said that it contains mistakes (19).\nBelief in an afterlife remains prevalent. In 1990, 82% agreed that there is \nan afterlife including heaven and hell (20). But only 4% expected to go to \nhell, and 45% also believed in ghosts (21).\nAlmost a fourth of the populace accepts the occult to some degree. A full \n31% believe that some people have magical powers, 28% believe in \nwitchcraft, 24% in black magic, 20% in voodoo (22).\nA survey in 1990 looked at opinions on leading public issues. On no issue \ndid a majority feel that they needed religious guidance to the right \nanswer. On almost all issues, a majority did not even know what position \ntheir religion took (23).\nPerhaps the most dramatic proof that America is forsaking its Christian \nheritage emerges from the history of how the law views Christianity. In \n1892, the Supreme Court ruled that \"our civilization and our institutions \nare emphatically Christian\" (24). Today, the Supreme Court has gone so far \nin enforcing separation of church and state that, in the opinion of former \nChief Justice Rehnquist, it has become antireligious. In a dissenting \nopinion, he said that \"the tone of the Court's opinion . . . bristles with \nhostility to all things religious in public life\" (25).",

(The unpopularity of the Sabbath law is the main reason for \nthe surprisingly low figure.)

For many, the Bible has become hard reading.\nThe Bible has been banished from public schools, and is ignored or mocked \nin the mass media.

As late as the 1960s, all fundamentalists could still \nassemble and feel that they shared a common identity. But then the \nfracturing process began. By the 1980s, two new movements had appeared, \nboth weighed down by apostate tendencies. One of these has been called \nneofundamentalism. The other I will call cultic fundamentalism.\n\"Neofundamentalism\" was originally a label that fundamentalist opponents of \nJerry Falwell pinned on his political action movement, known as the Moral \nMajority. The label is useful to signify churches and groups that have \nemerged from fundamentalism and acquired the following characteristics, now \nevident in many with no connection to Jerry Falwell:\nThey prefer modern translations of the Bible.\nIn 1950, Time Magazine, reporting on the revival at Wheaton College, spoke \nof it as bearing \"the stamp of its strict fundamentalist heritage: no \nmovies, smoking, card-playing, dancing or drinking,\" and it said derisively \nof the readers of Christian Life, a popular Christian magazine in those \ndays, \"Drinking, smoking, dancing, card-playing and movies they consider \nthe Devil's traps\" (1). These five prohibitions were for many years \nuniversally upheld by Bible-believing Christians. Christian institutions \nenforced them, and pastors denounced the forbidden practices as sin. Modern \nneofundamentalists may not openly reject the traditional standards of \nseparation, but they increasingly feel that insisting upon them is \nlegalistic.\nThey have adopted popular styles in sacred music.\nThey tend to be involved in politics, and in politics they do not hesitate \nto make alliances with religious groups that are nonfundamentalist or even \nunorthodox, like the Mormons.\nEvangelical churches display many of the same characteristics. So, it \nappears that except for their history, neofundamentalist churches are \nbecoming indistinguishable from evangelical churches.\nThe mark of cultic fundamentalism is its exaltation of one leader to \nspiritual supremacy. At least two fairly large cults have emerged in the \nlast twenty years, and more seem to be in the making. The first is the cult \nassociated with Jack Hyles and Peter Ruckman. The second is the Bill \nGothard cult.\nThe evolving distinctives of the first have clearly heretical tendencies.\nHyles and Ruckman teach that the King James translation of the Bible was \ngiven by inspiration.\nBoth men curry the adoration and total submission of their followers.\nBoth men are tolerant of divorce.\nBoth men promote ideas that verge on the bizarre (see the articles cited \nbelow).\nThe Gothard cult appeals to a different class of people, but is no less \ncultic in its suppression of individual soul liberty. The leader has drawn \nhis followers into a way of life that restricts their contact with people \noutside his control and binds them to his leadership for every decision \nthey make. What they believe, how they eat, how they manage their practical \naffairs, how they relate to each other, and what they teach their \nchildren\u2014all require attention to his teachings, some of which are clearly \nunbiblical. For example, he opposes (or at least many of his followers \nbelieve that he opposes) adoption, giving as his reason that a child of \nimmoral parents will inherit their moral weakness.\nExcellent critiques of these cults from an orthodox perspective are \navailable on the Web. By following the links, you will see informative \narticles on Bill Gothard, Peter Ruckman, and Jack Hyles. I do not agree \nwith every position taken, but the articles do well in exposing how far \nthese men have strayed from a sound Christianity. (Please inform me if any \nlink goes dead.)",

                    "text": "Apostasy in the Church\n\nEvangelicalism and neoevangelicalism\n\nAt the turn of the century, the advances of liberalism alarmed true \nChristians and stirred them to action. They began to cooperate with each \nother in efforts to keep existing church organizations from going liberal. \nAround the time of World War I, a series of books called The Fundamentals \nappeared, defending at length the essential doctrines of Christianity. \nThese books were so influential that the new movement which had arisen to \nprotest liberalism took its name from them, calling itself fundamentalism.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, fundamentalists failed to oust liberals from control \nof the mainline denominations. In consequence, fundamentalism itself \ndivided into two camps. One warmly embraced the principle of ecclesiastical \nseparation\u2014the principle that a local assembly of believers must separate \nitself from apostate Christian organizations. The other took a less \nenthusiastic stance in favor of this principle.\nThe first camp left mainline denominations and began forming their own \ninstitutions, including schools, mission boards, and parachurch \nassociations. From them came the GARB, the Bible Baptists, the Bible \nPresbyterians, the IFCA, and other groups, as well as many strictly \nindependent churches.\nThe second camp included many who continued the battle of trying to purify \nthe mainline denominations, many (especially among the Southern Baptists) \nwho did not feel that liberalism threatened their own denomination, and \nmany who formed new churches but who maintained dialogue and cooperation \nwith more liberal elements in the church.\nIn time, largely as a result of patronizing the same religious media, the \nsecond camp coalesced into a distinct movement known as evangelicalism. \nThis movement has retained its cohesion even as it has forsaken its \noriginal identity and evolved into something more modern, tainted with \napostasy.\nIts chief error today is an emphasis on positives to the neglect of \nnegatives. Although an evangelical church may faithfully teach the basic \ndoctrines of Christianity\u2014the Trinity, the authority of the Bible, \nsalvation by faith, and so on\u2014it gives everything a wrong slant. It says \nmuch about the love of God, but very little about the judgment of God or \nGod's hatred of sin. It speaks often of heaven, but seldom of hell. Its \nmembers hear much about getting to heaven through a commitment to Christ or \nthrough being born again, but very little about repentance. They listen \noften to promises that the Christian life will make them happy, but seldom \nto warnings about the difficulties and demands of the Christian life. \nRather than burden them with negative rules and standards, their pastor \ntells them that they have liberty to live as they please, so long as they \ndo not break an explicit command of Scripture. As a result, they never \nescape a worldly lifestyle, because many modern vices were unknown in Bible \ntimes and the Bible says nothing against them.\nIn the 1950s a small group of Christian intellectuals spearheaded a new \nmovement that became known as neoevangelicalism. At the outset, the chief \ndistinctive of this movement was its desire to engage learned unbelievers \nin dialogue, seeking not only witness, but also an adjustment of Christian \nlanguage, traditions, and tenets to bring them into agreement with the \nestablished results of scientific and academic inquiry. Neoevangelicalism \nquickly gained the upper hand at institutions like Fuller Theological \nSeminary and Wheaton College. By now, its influence has been felt \neverywhere in evangelicalism, yet some clear differences between the older \nmovement and its spin-off remain.\nMost evangelicals are politically conservative, whereas many \nneoevangelicals follow trendy liberal causes. They tend to be pacifistic, \nto favor strong governmental action against social problems, and to support \nadvances in minority rights, including the rights of women and homosexuals.\nEvangelicals hold to the inerrancy of Scripture, whereas neoevangelicals \nreject inerrancy or else deny that the Creation accounts and other portions \nare meant to be taken literally.\nEvangelicals still oppose practices like drinking and smoking, and perhaps \neven rock dancing. Neoevangelicals have no such scruples, although they \nlook on smoking as unhealthy and inadvisable, and they endorse moderation \nin drinking.\nEvangelicals avoid fellowship with people in the liberal or neo-orthodox \nrealm, whereas neoevangelicals willingly interact and fellowship with \nanyone except a fundamentalist.",

                    "text": "Apostasy in the Church\n\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the church of Jesus Christ is sick \nwith apostasy, debilitating every missionary work, every Christian school, \nevery witness through the media, and every local assembly of believers. The \napostasy that now fills the whole church germinated in about 1800. Since \nthen, it has steadily grown and spread, with corrupting effects that can be \nclearly seen in two ways.\nChristianity has fragmented into ideological camps, all of which to some \ndegree reject Biblical faith and practice.\nWestern society as a whole, once composed of nations that prided themselves \non their allegiance to the Christian religion, has become thoroughly \nsecularized.\nThe sorry state of the contemporary church exactly reproduces all the \nprophetic pictures of the church in the Last Days, on the eve of Christ's \nreturn. According to prophecy, it would be a church riddled with corruption \nand crippled by apostasy.\n\nLiberalism\n\nBefore the eighteenth century, no one who considered himself a Christian \ndoubted that the Bible is true, and in European society there were few who \nwere willing to say that they were not Christians. But in the eighteenth \ncentury, the educated elite began to drift away from Christianity toward \nalternative world views conceived by speculative philosophy. The most \npopular of these was deism. Its core belief was that God created the \nuniverse as a self-perpetuating machine, operating according to natural \nlaws discoverable by science. This new world view denied the supernatural, \nas well as God's continuing involvement in human affairs.\nIn the early nineteenth century, doubt in the supernatural and in Biblical \nhistory began to infect organized Christianity. The Unitarians, prominent \nin New England, went so far as to reject the full deity of Christ. Under \nthe influence of the movement in literature and art known as romanticism, \nmany of them believed that God is a mystic oversoul transcending nature yet \nintimately in union with it. That conception of God was called \ntranscendentalism.\nAfter the publication of Darwin's Origin of the Species in the 1860s, \nimportant segments of the church accepted his ideas and abandoned belief in \nthe literal truth of the Scriptures. Then emerged a new form of theology \nknown as liberalism. Its basic tenets were these:\nAlthough the Bible offers spiritual and ethical insights, it is only a \ncollection of human writings. Many of them must be classified as folk tales \nor legends with no historical value.\nJesus may have been divine in the sense that we are all divine, but He was \nnot uniquely God. Nor did He exist before His birth. Nor was He born of a \nvirgin. Nor did He rise bodily from the grave.\nThe purpose of life is not personal salvation from sin, but salvation of \nsociety from the evils of poverty, ignorance, and injustice.\nIn some of its manifestations, liberalism came close to denying God \ncompletely, except as a human thought.\nBy the early 1900s, liberalism had gained control of all the Protestant \nseminaries and had won over many pastors, missionaries, denominational \noverseers, and college officials. Although the average churchgoer was still \nfairly conservative, his leaders were working feverishly to bring his views \nup to date.\nBut liberalism had an unexpected effect. The average churchgoer had enough \nsense to recognize that if liberalism is right, why go to church? By \nmidcentury it became obvious that the mainline churches where liberalism \nwas dominant were losing people. So, liberals in religious professions \nbegan looking for a more appealing theology that would still accommodate \ntheir unbelief. The new theology that they created is known as \nneo-orthodoxy.",

Polygamy had nothing to do with me leaving, \nalthough at church we were taught that they practiced it in order to \nsupport the widows of Mormon martyrs, or that the marriages were not \nphysical ones.  What can I say?  We believed it.  But no, it wasn't about \nthat.  It was about other problems that we just never learned in church and \nI discovered that the list of problems is as long as my arm.  Make that \nboth arms.

And be sealed to his mate that does have children in the home. \n So no go for a missionary calling in his case.  And it is an astute \nobservation to question his motivations ... imo.\n\nBut this does make me wonder about the procedure with endowing new male \nmembers with priesthood.

When the church responds to a disaster \nsomewhere, they don't ask who's Mormon and who's not. In case you didn't \nknow it, need knows no religion. We (LDS) don't care what the person's \nbeliefs are; they *will* receive help from us. According to you, maybe LDS \nwould be better off if we just closed up shop as far as helping others in \ntimes of disaster? Kind of a *\"sorry folks, we know your homes have been \ndestroyed, but Mr. Powers here thinks we're doing evil by helping you out, \nso, you'll have to find another group--specifically, one whose volunteers \nhave all been born again. Otherwise, they'll be just as evil as the Mormons \nare and we can't have that, now, can we?\"*\n\nStupid comment on my part? Absolutely--but not nearly as stupid as claiming \nthat if person  #1 and person #2 give identical aid to whomever, person \n#1's works will be counted as good because he's born again but person #2's \nworks will be considered as \"filthy rags\" because he's not born again. God \ndoesn't think that way. He is no respecter of persons. *\"Then Peter opened \nhis mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of \npersons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh \nrighteousness, is accepted with him.*\n(Acts 10:34-35) \n\n*\"Good works  don't save.\"*\n\nNo kidding? Actually, it's \"good works *alone* don't save. Every Mormon \nknows that. Good works *do* play a part in our salvation. According to the \nBible, good works prove our true faith in Jesus Christ, and faith in Jesus \nChrist is, again according to the Bible, absolutely essential for our \nsalvation. The Pharisee was doing good works for his own glory, not for the \nglory of God. Don't think so? The just try to make a case for salvation for \nsomeone who does no good works at all. \n\n*\"Unless a Man is Saved, He will not work righteousness.\"* and *\"Works \nwithout Christ mean nothing and count for nothing.\"*\n\nI've heard a few self-professed born again Christians claim that, but it's \njust not true. Jesus encouraged his disciples to help those in need (I'm \nsure you know the scriptures on that). Are you claiming that someone who \nfollows Jesus's admonition (they may not ever be christian), will have his \ngood works considered as \"filthy rags\" in the eyes of God? If so, that's a \ntwisted line of thinking, dude.What about those who have lived and died \nwithout ever having heard of Jesus Christ? What's to become of them?\n\nFortunately, LDS know that those folks will have the chance when they \nreturn to heaven.\n\n*\"Which is one reason you are not considered Christians.\"*\n\nNo slam on you, but I'll leave the question as to whether or not I'm \nChristian, up to God. Only He has the wisdom to make that judgement. You \ndon't. You don't know me; you don't know what I've done in my life; you \ndon't know the experiences I've had. ",

Nature of God\nBrigham Young \"Adam is God\"\nFollowing Joseph\u2019s pattern, Brigham Young changed God. In 1854, he taught \nin General Conference that Adam is God (JD, 1:50-51, 1854). He kept \npreaching this! In 1873, it was, \"God revealed to me--namely that Adam is \nour Father and God\" (Deseret Evening News, June 14, 1873). Compare the D&C \n27:11; 138:38. Brigham threatened that the failure to accept this meant \nyour \"salvation or damnation\" (Journal of Discourses, Vol.1, p. 51, April \n9, 1852). His claim to authority was \"I have never yet preached a sermon \nand sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call Scripture\" \n(JD 13:95).\n\nBrigham Young, the LDS prophet, seer and revelator is credited with much of \nthe LDS foundation. So what happens to people when their spiritual leaders \nnever knew God? What about all of those Mormons who followed him to worship \nthat false god all those years? God warns about paganism.\n\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" (Exodus 20:3). Isn\u2019t it ironic to \nname a university after this false prophet?\n\nWhat was that that Satan whispered in Eve's ear?! Who did he promise Eve \nthat she could be like? ;-)\nI've got some bad news for you, You will not be a god:\nGod says,\n\"I am the first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no God.\" (Isaiah \n44:6)\n\"Before Me there was no God, and there will be none after Me.\" (Isaiah 43:10\n)\n\"Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.\" (Isaiah \n44:8)\nThere's only one God, and it is not, nor will it ever be you.\n\"Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give \nthee light.\" (Eph 5:14)\"One of the barriers to understanding Mormon \ntheology is the underlying assumption by most Latter-day Saints that \ndoctrine develops consistently, that ideas build cumulatively on each \nother. As a result, older revelations are usually interpreted by referring \nto current doctrinal positions. This type of interpretation may produce \nsystematic theology and may satisfy those trying to understand and \ninternalize current doctrine, but it is bad history since it leaves an \nunwarranted impression of continuity and consistency.\"\n*___*\n\n--The Doctrine of God (as Originally Offered in Official Mormon Teaching) \nWas That of a God Who Was a Single Personage of Spirit but Who Was \nPhysically Manifested as Jesus with a Body\n\n\"The Book of Mormon tended to define God as an absolute personage of spirit \nwho, clothed in flesh, revealed himself in Jesus Christ (see Abinadi\u2019s \nsermon to King Noah in Mos. 13-14).\n\n\"Two years later, the first issue of the Mormon Evening and Morning Star \npublished a similar description of God in the \u201cArticles and Covenants of \nthe Church of Christ,\u201d the church\u2019s first statement of faith and practice \nwhich, with some additions, became Doctrine and Covenants 20. The \n\u201cArticles,\u201d according to correspondence in the Star, was used with the Book \nof Mormon in proselytizing and indicated that \u201cthere is a God in heaven who \nis infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting, the same \nunchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth and all things which are \nin them.\u201d\n\n\"The Messenger and Advocate, successor to the Star, published lectures 5 \nand 6 of the \u201cLectures on Faith\u201d of the Doctrine and Covenants (1835), \ndefining the \u201cFather\u201d as \u201cthe only supreme governor, and independent being, \nin whom all fulness and perfection dwells; who is omnipotent, omnipresent, \nand omniscient; without beginning of days or end of life.\u201d In a letter \npublished in the Messenger and Advocate, Warren A. Cowdery argued that \u201cwe \nhave proven to the satisfaction of every intelligent being, that there is a \ngreat first cause, prime mover, self-existent, independent and all wise \nbeing whom we call God . . . immutable in his purposes and unchangable in \nhis nature.\u201d\n\n\" . . . [T]here is little evidence that early church doctrine specifically \ndifferentiated between Christ and God. Indeed, this distinction was \nprobably considered unnecessary since the early discussion also seems to \nhave supported trinitarian doctrine.\n\n\"Joseph Smith\u2019s 1832 account of his first vision spoke only of one \npersonage and did not make the explicit separation of God and Christ found \nin the 1838 version.\n\n\"The Book of Mormon declared that Mary \u201cis the mother of God, after the \nmanner of the flesh,\u201d which was changed in 1837 to \u201cmother of the Son of \nGod.\u201d Abinadi\u2019s sermon in the Book of Mormon explored the relationship \nbetween God and Christ: \u201cGod himself shall come down among the children of \nmen, and shall redeem his people. And because he dwelleth in the flesh he \nshall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will \nof the Father, being the Father and the Son\u2014The Father, because he was \nconceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus \nbecoming the Father and Son\u2014and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal \nFather of heaven and of earth\u201d (Mos. 15:1-4)\n*___*.\n\n--Early Official Mormon Church Doctrine Had No Three-Part Godhead\n\n\"The \u201cLectures on Faith\u201d differentiated between the Father and Son more \nexplicitly, but even they did not define a materialistic, tritheistic \ngodhead. In announcing the publication of the Doctrine and Covenants, which \nincluded the lectures, the Messenger and Advocate commented that it trusted \nthe volume would give \u201cthe churches abroad \u2026 a perfect understanding of the \ndoctrine believed by this society.\u201d The lectures declared that \u201cthere are \ntwo personages who constitute the great matchless, governing and supreme \npower over all things\u2014by whom all things were created and made.\u201d They are \n\u201cthe Father being a personage of spirit\u201d and \u201cthe Son, who was in the bosom \nof the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made, or fashioned like unto man, \nor being in the form and likeness of man, or, rather, man was formed after \nhis likeness, and in his image.\u201d The \u201cArticles and Covenants\u201d called the \nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost \u201cone God\u201d rather than \u201cGodhead,\u201d a term Mormons \nuse today to separate themselves from trinitarians.\"\n*___*\n\n--In Early Official Mormon Church Doctrine, the Holy Ghost Was Not a \nSeparate Member of the Godhead but, Rather, Represented the Mind of God\n\n\"The doctrine of the Holy Ghost in these early sources is even more \nstriking compared to our point of view today. The \u201cLectures on Faith\u201d \ndefined the Holy Ghost as the mind of the Father and the Son, a member of \nthe Godhead but not a personage, who binds the Father and Son together \n(D&C, 1835 ed., 53-54). This view of the Holy Ghost likely reinforced \ntrinitarian doctrine by explaining how personal beings like the Father and \nSon become one god through the noncorporeal presence of a shared mind.\"\n*___*\n\n--Significant Changes Were Made by Joseph Smith to Early Mormon Doctrines \non the Nature of God--Which Included Giving God a Physical Body, Physically \nSeparating God from Christ, Introducing the Doctrine of Plurality of Gods \nand Establishing the Doctrine of Eternal Progression from Humanhood to \nGodhood\n\n\" . . . [B]etween 1842 and 1844, Joseph Smith spoke on and published \nradical Christian doctrines such as the plurality of gods, the tangibility \nof God\u2019s body, the distinct separation of God and Christ, the potential of \nman to become and function as a god, . . . and the materiality of \neverything, including spirit. These ideas were perhaps most clearly stated \nin the King Follett discourse of April 1844.\n\n\"It seems clear that certain ideas which developed between 1832 and 1844 \nwere internalized after 1835 and accepted by the Latter-day Saints. This \nwas particularly true of the material anthropomorphism of God and Jesus \nChrist, advanced perfectionism as elaborated in the doctrine of eternal \nprogression, and the potential godhood of humanity.\"\n*___*\n\n--Following the Death of Joseph Smith, More Changes Were Made in Official \nMormon Church Doctrines on God, with Adam Taking Over as God\n\n\"Between 1845 and 1890, . . . certain doctrines were proposed which were \nlater rejected or modified.\n\n\". . . Brigham Young preached that Adam was not only the first man but also \nthe god of this world. Acceptance of the King Follett doctrine would have \ngranted the possibility of Adam being a god, but the idea that he was the \ngod of this world conflicted with the later Jehovah-Christ doctrine. . . .\n\n\"The newer and older doctrines . . . coexisted, and all competed with novel \npositions spelled out by various church leaders.\n\n\"The \u201cLectures on Faith\u201d continued to appear as part of the Doctrine and \nCovenants in a section entitled \u201cDoctrine and Covenants\u201d\u2014distinguished from \nthe \u201cCovenants and Commandments,\u201d which constitute the current LDS Doctrine \nand Covenants.\n\n\"The Pearl of Great Price containing the \u201cBook of Abraham\u201d was published in \nEngland in 1851 as a missionary tract and was accepted as authoritative in \n1880.\n\n\"The earliest versions of Apostle Parley P. Pratt\u2019s Key to the Science of \nTheology and Brigham H. Roberts\u2019s The Gospel: An Exposition of Its First \nPrinciples both emphasized an omnipresent, non-personal Holy Ghost, \nalthough Pratt\u2019s emphasis was radically materialistic and Roberts\u2019s more \nallegorical. Both were elaborating ideas addressed in the King Follett \nsermon. Such fluidity of doctrine, unusual from a twentieth-century \nperspective, characterized the nineteenth-century church.\n\n\"By 1890 the doctrines preached in the church combined what would seem \ntoday both familiar and strange. Yet between 1890 and 1925 these doctrine \nwere reconstructed principally on the basis of works by four European \nimmigrants, James E. Talmage, Brigham H. Roberts, John A. Widtsoe, and \nCharles W. Penrose. Widtsoe, Penrose, and Talmage did much of their writing \nbefore they became apostles, but Roberts served as a member of the First \nCouncil of the Seventy during the entire period.\"\n*___*\n\n--Still More Revamping Was Done to Official Mormon Church Doctrine on the \nGodhead, as the Holy Ghost Finally Emerges as an Individual Member of the \nTrinity Instead of Just Being God's Brain\n\n\"Perhaps the most important doctrine addressed was the doctrine of the \nGodhead, which was reconstructed beginning in 1893 and 1894. During that \nyear Talmage, president of Latter-day Saints University in Salt Lake City \nand later president and professor of geology at the University of Utah, \ngave a series of lectures on the \u201cArticles of Faith\u201d to the theological \nclass of LDSU.\n\n\"In the fall of 1898 the First Presidency asked him to rewrite the lectures \nand present them for approval as an exposition of church doctrines.\n\n\"In the process, Talmage reconsidered and reconstructed the doctrine of the \nHoly Ghost. In response to questions raised by Talmage\u2019s lectures, George \nQ. Cannon, of the First Presidency, \u201ccommenting on the ambiguity existing \nin our printed works concerning the nature or character of the Holy Ghost, \nexpressed his opinion that the Holy Ghost was in reality a person, in the \nimage of the other members of the Godhead\u2014a man in form and figure; and \nthat what we often speak of as the Holy Ghost is in reality but the power \nor influence of the spirit.\u201d The First Presidency on that occasion, \nhowever, \u201cdeemed it wise to say as little as possible on this as on other \ndisputed subjects.\u201d\n\n\"In 1894 Talmage published an article in the Juvenile Instructor \nelaborating on his and Cannon\u2019s views. He incorporated the article almost \nverbatim into his manuscript for the Articles of Faith, and the presidency \napproved the article virtually without change in 1898.\n\n\"The impact of the Articles of Faith on doctrinal exposition within the \nchurch was enormous. Some doctrinal works, including B. H. Roberts\u2019s 1888 \nvolume The Gospel, were quite allegorical on the nature of God, Christ, and \nthe Holy Ghost. In the 1901 edition, after the publication of the Articles \nof Faith, Roberts explicitly revised his view of the Godhead, modifying his \ndiscussion and incorporating Talmage\u2019s more literal interpretation of the \nHoly Ghost.\"\n*___*\n\n--Darwim's Theory of Organic Evolution Further Reshaped (and Muddied) \nMormonism's Official Doctrines on God\n\n'By 1900 it was impossible to consider the doctrines of God and humanity \nwithout dealing with organic evolution. Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species \nhad been in print for four decades, and scientific advances together with \nchanging attitudes had introduced many secular-rational ideas. Talmage and \nJohn A. Widtsoe had confronted these ideas as they studied at universities \nin the United States and elsewhere. In a February 1900 article, for \nexample, Talmage argued that science and religion had to be reconciled \nsince \u201cfaith is not blind submission, passive obedience, with no effort at \nthought or reason. Faith, if worthy of its name, rests upon truth; and \ntruth is the foundation of science.\u201d\n\n\"Just as explicit in his approach was Widtsoe, who came to the conclusion \nthat the \u201cscriptural proof of the truth of the gospel had been quite fully \ndeveloped and was unanswerable.\u201d He \u201cset out therefore to present [his] \nmodest contributions from the point of view of science and those trained in \nthat type of thinking.\u201d Between November 1903 and July 1904, he published a \nseries of articles in the Improvement Era under the title \u201cJoseph Smith as \nScientist.\u201d The articles, republished in 1908 as the Young Men\u2019s Mutual \nImprovement Association course of study, argued that Joseph Smith \nanticipated many scientific theories and discoveries.\n\n\"Joseph Smith as Scientist, like Widtsoe\u2019s later A Rational Theology, drew \nheavily on Herbert Spencer\u2019s theories and ideas. The Mormon gospel, Widtsoe \nargued, recognized the reality of time, space, and matter. The universe is \nboth material and eternal, and God organized rather than created it. Thus \nGod was not the creator, nor was he omnipotent. He too was governed by \nnatural law, which was fundamental.\n\n\"Although the publications of Talmage, Roberts, and Widtsoe established the \nchurch\u2019s basic doctrines of the Godhead, some members and non-members were \nstill confused. In 1911 Apostle George F. Richards spoke in the tabernacle \non the nature of God. Afterward a member challenged him, arguing that \nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost were one God rather than three distinct beings. \nRichards disagreed and cited scriptural references, including Joseph \nSmith\u2019s first vision.\"\n\n--The Mormon Church Ends Up Dumping Its Previously LDS Church \nPresident-Taught Doctrine of \"Adam-God\"\n\n\"In February 1912 detractors confronted missionaries in the Central States \nMission with the Adam-God theory. In a letter to the mission president, the \nFirst Presidency argued that Brigham Young did not mean to say that Adam \nwas God, and at a special priesthood meeting during the April 1912 General \nConference, they secured approval for a declaration that Mormons worship \nGod the Father, not Adam.\"\n*___*\n\n--The Mormon Church Further Tweaks Its Official Doctrine on the \nRelationship Between God and Christ, Deciding to Finally Give Jesus a \nMission Statement\n\n\"Reconsideration of the doctrine of God and the ambiguity in discourse and \nprinted works over the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ \npointed to the need for an authoritative statement on the nature and \nmission of Christ.\n\n\"From 1904 to 1906 Talmage delivered a series of lectures on \u201cJesus the \nChrist\u201d at Latter-day Saints University. The First Presidency again asked \nTalmage to incorporate the lectures into a book, but he suspended the work \nto fill other assignments. In September 1914, however, the presidency asked \nhim to prepare \u201cthe book with as little delay as possible.\u201d In order to \nfree him \u201cfrom visits and telephone calls\u201d and \u201cin view of the importance \nof the work,\u201d Talmage was \u201cdirected to occupy a room in the Temple where\u201d \nhe would \u201cbe free from interruption.\u201d After completing the writing in April \n1915, he said that he had \u201cfelt the inspiration of the place and \u2026 \nappreciated the privacy and quietness incident thereto.\u201d The presidency and \ntwelve raised some questions about specific portions, but they agreed \ngenerally with the work, which elaborated views expressed previously in the \nArticles of Faith.\"\n\n--Reconstruction of Official Mormon Church Doctrine on God Eventually \nStarts Swinging Back to the Teachings of Joseph Smith\n\n\"By 1916 the ideas which Joseph Smith and other leaders had proposed \n(generally after 1835) were serving as the framework for continued \ndevelopment of the doctrine of God. Talmage, Widtsoe, and Roberts had \nundertaken a reconstruction which carried doctrine far beyond anything \ndescribed in the \u201cLectures on Faith\u201d or generally believed by church \nmembers prior to 1835.\"\n\n--The Mormon Church Continues Reinventing God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost in \nIts Attmept to Get It Right\n\n\"Official statements were soon required to canonize doctrines on the Father \nand the Son, particularly because of the ambiguity in the scriptures and in \nauthoritative statements about the unity of the Father and the Son, the \nrole of Jesus Christ as Father, and the roles of the Father and Son in the \nCreation.\n\n\"A statement for the church membership prepared by the First Presidency and \ntwelve apostles, apparently first drafted by Talmage, was published in \n1916. The statement made clear the separate corporeal nature of the two \nbeings and delineated their roles in the creation of the earth and their \ncontinued relationships with this creation. The statement was congruent \nwith the King Follett discourse and the work of Talmage, Widtsoe, and \nRoberts.\n\n\"This elaboration, together with the revised doctrine of the Holy Ghost, \nmade necessary the revision and redefinition of works previously used. By \nJanuary 1915, Charles W. Penrose had completed a revision of Parley P. \nPratt\u2019s Key to the Science of Theology. Penrose deleted or altered passages \nwhich discussed the Holy Ghost as non-personal and which posited a sort of \n\u201cspiritual fluid\u201d pervading the universe.\"\n\n--The Mormon Church Ultimately Removes the Lectures on Faith from the \nDoctrine & Covenants\n\n\"Less than two years later, in November 1917, a meeting of the twelve \napostles and First Presidency considered the question of the \u201cLectures on \nFaith,\u201d particularly lecture 5. At that time, they agreed to append a \nfootnote in the next edition, apparently clarifying the lecture\u2019s teachings \non God. This proved unnecessary when the First Presidency appointed a \ncommittee to revise the entire Doctrine and Covenants.\n\n\"Revision continued through July and August 1921, and the church printed \nthe new edition in late 1921. The committee proposed to delete the \n\u201cLectures on Faith\u201d on the ground that they were \u201clessons prepared for use \nin the School of the Elders, conducted in Kirtland, Ohio, during the winter \nof 1834-35; but they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as \nbeing otherwise than theological lectures or lessons.\u201d\n\n\"How the committee came to this conclusion is uncertain. The General \nConference of the church in April 1835 had accepted the entire volume, \nincluding the lectures, as authoritative and binding upon church members. \nWhat seems certain, however, is that the 1916 official statement, based \nupon Talmage\u2019s, Widtsoe\u2019s, and Roberts\u2019s reconstructed doctrine of the \nGodhead, had superseded the theology of the lectures.\"\n\n--The Science of Organic Evolution Continues to Force Changes in the Mormon \nChurch's Official Doctrines on God and Mortal Man's Eternal March to Godhood\n\n\"Basically, concern over the increasing vigor of the theory of evolution \nthrough natural selection seems to have outweighed all other considerations \non the doctrine of man. The First Presidency wanted to see the truths of \nscience and religion reconciled, and much of the work of Talmage, Widtsoe, \nand Roberts dealt with that challenge.\n\n\"On evolution, for instance, they generally took the view that while \nevolution itself was a correct principle, the idea of natural selection was \nnot. The First Presidency\u2019s official statements of 1909 and 1925 \nspecifically addressed the problem of evolution and of human nature, which \nwas an important part of Talmage\u2019s, Widtsoe\u2019s, and Roberts\u2019s works.26\n\n\"Because evolution was constantly in the background, it seems apparent that \ntwo things happened. First, church members internalized the implications of \nthe doctrine of eternal progression, assuming that men and women, as gods \nin embryo, were basically godlike and that the flesh itself, since it was \ncommon to both God and humanity, posed no barrier to human perfectibility. \nSecond, members seem to have concluded that Joseph Smith\u2019s statement in the \n\u201cArticles of Faith\u201d that God would not punish man for Adam\u2019s transgression \nwas a rejection of the doctrine of original sin, which held that humanity \ninherited a condition of sinfulness. In general, it seemed, the doctrine of \nabsolute free will demanded that any evil which man might do resulted not \nfrom the flesh but from a conscious choice. How these, and related \ndoctrines, will change in the future remains to be seen.\"\n\nThere you have it in all its glorious tinkering.\n\n3. The Mormon Church Is The Most Liberal With Salvation\nIt is important to understand that salvation is \u201cGod\u2019s gift\u201d and doesn\u2019t \ncome \u201cfrom works, so that no one can boast\u201d (Eph 2:8-9). This comes only \nthrough belief in Jesus (Acts 16:31; Rom 10:9-10). While some teach that \nsalvation can be lost, it is impossible for a Christian to lose God\u2019s \nfavor. In fact, the Bible provides plenty of references to show how God\u2019s \nSpirit will never leave the believer.\nPaul certainly supported this idea throughout his writings. He wrote in Rom \n8:38-39 that nothing can \u201cseparate us from the love of God that is in \nChrist Jesus our Lord!\u201d This is because \u201cHe who started a good work in you \nwill carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus\u201d (Phil 1:6). \nIn essence, God \u201csealed us and [has] given us the Spirit as a down payment \nin our hearts\u201d (2 Cor 1:21-22). Jude, another New Testament writer, added \nthat God is \u201cable to protect you from stumbling and to make you stand in \nthe presence of His glory, blameless and with great joy\u201d (Jude 24).\nIn addition, the apostle John spent much time and effort assuring believers \nthat they are eternally secure in their salvation. According to John\u2019s \ngospel, Jesus came to earth so that believers could \u201chave life and have it \nin abundance\u201d (John 10:10). God never meant for Christians to worry about \ntheir salvation. This is why Jesus said, \u201cAnyone who hears My word and \nbelieves in Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under \njudgment but has passed from death to life\u201d (John 5:24). Jesus later said, \n\u201cThis is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He \nhas given Me but should raise them up on the last day\u201d (John 6:39).\n4. Families Are Forever\nAlthough Paul mentions a practice known as baptism for the dead in 1 \nCorinthians 15:29, little is really known on the subject other than he \nappears to exclude himself from such a practice by using the word they. The \nMormon interpretation is rejected as are all ideas of a post-mortem \nsalvation. Hebrews 9:27 clearly shows \"it is appointed unto men once to \ndie, but after this the judgment.\" This makes an after-death restitution \nwith God an impossibility. Ironically, this same idea is taught in the Book \nof Mormon in Alma 34:34, 35.",

Mainstream their Christian message by talking more about Grace: This was \nadvanced a few steps fairly successfully by Holland and Uchtdorf, although \nI have to say they couldn't go quite all the way to saying we are saved by \ngrace alone. Most evangelical Christians would still have found too much \ntalk of obedience and \"works\" as the source of \"accessing grace\" in these \ntalks. 6/10\n\n2. Talk about the LDs family as the model. This was hit on repeatedly, both \nin the women's conference and the general sessions. My verdict: It did not \nresonate. Not with TBMs and not with exmos. They really, really don't get \nit, still, and this generation of church leaders is painful to watch as \nthey flounder through this pressing social issue. Trying to solve 21st \ncentury issues with 18th century tools is NOT working. No one that I know \nunder the age of 70 came away from conference fired up to oppose gay \nmarriage or feeling that the \"family is under attack\". This one is getting \nNO TRACTION, which must baffle the Q15. The rhetoric is so obviously false \nthat even TBMs can't pretend to care. Have any of you seen differently?? \n2/10\n\n3. Talk about religious freedom/ie., pretend to be persecuted: BUST. Only \none person, Robert D. Hales, possibly the worst speaker in the world as far \nas I can tell, even addressed this. 1/10\n\n4. IMO the biggest goal of all: Try to get people to stop leaving the \nchurch/project confidence and strength/reassure members who see their \nfriends and family leaving: I think this was a TOTAL FAIL. Quentin Cook is \nalready backpedaling from his lies. The talks did not address anything \nspecific. They provided NO ANSWERS and NOTHING NEW. 3/10\n\n5. Show the membership that Thomas S. Monson is still in command of his \n'faculties': I think they succeeded at this. He seemed fine to me. Boyd K. \nPacker was another matter entirely. 7/10\n\nOverall: 3/10\n\nSuffice it to say it was not the infusion of energy and commitment they \nneeded.",

I'd have killed him too.\n\n*Smith and 16-year-old Fanny Alger\nSmith's first known sexual affair was with a teenager named Fannie Alger, \nwho was living with Smith and his first wife Emma in their Kirtland, Ohio, \nhome. Fanny was also Smith's first confimred plural wife. Smith \u201ccame to \nknow [her] in Kirtland during early 1833 when she, at the age of 16, stayed \nat his home as a housemaid. Described as 'a very nice and comly young \nwoman,' according to Benjamin Johnson, Fanny lived with the Smith family \nfrom 1833 to 1836.\u201d\nFanny eventually became the target of Smith's sexual advances, with Smith's \npredatory behavior soon becoming the talk of the town:\n\u201cMartin Harris, one of the 'Three Witnesses' to the Book of Mormon, \nrecalled that the prophet's 'servant girl' claimed he had made 'improper \nproposals to her, which created quite a talk amongst the people.' Mormon \nFanny Brewer similarly reported 'much excitement against the Prophet . . . \n[involving] an unlawful intercourse between himself and a young orphan girl \nresiding in his family and under his protection.\"\nEmma discovered the sexual affair between Smith and Fanny and exploded in \nanger. Caught with his hand in Fanny's cookie jar, Smith confessed. A \nnoticeably pregnant Fanny eventually was kicked out of the house by Emma, \nas reported thusly:\n\u201cFormer Mormon apostle William McLellin later wrote that Emma Smith \nsubstantiated the Smith-Alger affair. According to McLellin, Emma was \nsearching for her husband and Alger one evening, when through a crack in \nthe barn door she saw 'him and Fanny in the barn together alone' on the hay \nmow. McLellin, in a letter to one of Smith's sons, added that the ensuing \nconfrontation between Emma and her husband grew so heated that Rigdon, \nFrederick G. Williams, and Oliver Cowdery had to mediate the situation.\n\"After Emma related what she had witnessed, Smith, according to McLellin, \n'confessed humbly and begged forgiveness. Emma and all forgave him.' While \nOliver Cowdery may have forgiven his cousin Joseph Smith, he did not forget \nthe incident. Three years later, when provoked by the prophet, Cowdery \ncountered by calling the Fanny Alger episode 'a dirty, nasty, filthy \naffair.'",

What is truly important is \nthe change that was wrought in my life because of it. Your comments to the \neffect that you aren't my judge lead me to wonder if you misunderstand what \nI wrote. I am not sorry about my loss of faith. In fact, quite the opposite \nis true. I feel more free and more content now than at any time when I was \nan LDS. Unlike many of my fellow apostates, I did not replace my faith in \nmormonism with a faith in another religion. I am not out on the internet to \ndestroy faith, or to ruin lives, especially since I have no agenda to \nreplace it with something else. Sometimes the truth can leave you empty. If \nyou're happy in your world and with your God, you are free to keep them \n(until you try to force your belief system on other non-believers, that is).\nAs far as being born in the covenant goes, I am also well aware of this \nmormon principle. My parents were sealed in the Salt Lake temple and so I \nam a child of the covenant. Which only serves to exacerbate the absurdity \nof temple sealings in my opinion. The church makes a strong effort to \npreach that \"families can be together forever\". This is a message that has \nresonated well with younger families, who still have smaller children at \nhome. This message is misleading. It attempts to sell the notion that the \nnuclear family unit will be together forever; that the children will \ncontinue to be children, etc. This is the absurdity and the misleading \npart. Converts to the church are taken in by the promise of their nuclear \nfamily being together for eternity. What they are actually getting, if they \nspend two minutes of thought about it, are whole nations of people being \nsealed together: from parents, to children, to their children, to their \nchildren's children. The nuclear family disappears and is replaced with the \nentirety of the human family. When you consider that baptisms and temple \nordinances for the dead are the effort that the LDS church takes to ensure \nthat ALL persons who have lived on Earth are afforded the opportunity to be \nbaptized and sealed together, we really are talking about the entirety of \nhuman existence, all sealed from parents to children and so on. I don't \nthink the church's message of eternal families would go over so well with \ninvestigators and new converts if it were properly described as joining the \nfamily collective, instead of how the church currently sells it.\n\nWell I've enjoyed our little back and forth here, Terry. You've been a \nfantastic sport. I don't mean to sound condescending; it is something that \nmy wife tells me I need a little work on :) I do remember a time when my \nfaith was as valuable to me as yours is to you, but happily my faith has \nbeen replaced with knowledge of the goodness and nobleness of the human \nspirit. If you ever want to debate the truthfulness (or lack thereof) of \nthe LDS church, feel free to look me up. In the meantime, I wish you and \nyours a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.",

However, \nI'd be interested in knowing the lesson topic that you had such a struggle \nwith (either I missed reading it, or you neglected to state what it was). \nSecondly, your statement that \"which fades to absurdity when you consider \nthat kids grow up, have families of their own, are sealed to their kids, \ntheir kids, and their kids until everyone is sealed to everyone and the \nconcept of family is lost\" is in error. If the parents were sealed in the \ntemple when they first got married, any kids have are automatically sealed \nto them (it's known as being \"born in the covenant\"). The concept of family \nis definitely NOT lost, but is actually strengthened as more generations \nare sealed as couples and sealed to parents. I was an ordinance worker in \nmy local temple for almost 5 years, so I know how that works. \n\nYou are not the first LDS person I've met online who somehow got tripped up \nby something he/she didn't understand, and seemingly couldn't get a \nsatisfactory answer on, even through sincere prayer. I have to believe that \nsometimes the Lord remains silent, just to test our faith. I know that has \ncertainly happened to me. I've always approached situations like that with \nan attitude of \"for some reason, I'm not meant to know that at this time\". \nIs that a cop-out on my part? Is it blind obedience? Personally, I don't \nthink so. At the last general conference, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland gave a \ntalk titled \"Lord, I Believe\".

                    "text": "I don't think you really want to know, but since you asked I'll tell you :)\nI was born and raised in the church. My parents are 3rd and 5th generation \nLDS. My great, great grandfather was a captain in the mormon battalion. He \nwent on to be the first bishop in Sandy Utah. I have many aunts, uncles and \ncousins who remain firm and stalwart in their LDS faith. To say that I was \na child of promise in the faith was a bit of an understatement. I attended \nPrimary and Sunday School as a child, as a teen I was ordained as a deacon, \nteacher and priest. I was a cub scout, a webelos, and finally a boy scout, \nthough I never achieved my Eagle. I was a huge nerd and felt more at home \nworking on my atomic energy and chemistry merit badges than I did playing \nsports or doing outdoorsy stuff. Unfortunately for me, my peers in the \ntroop were the jocks of the basketball and football teams, and the pack \nleaders were their fathers so there was precious little time for my \nscholarly pursuits in scouting. I attended seminary and would likely have \ngraduated from it had I not excelled in my scholastics and earned an early \nadmission to the University of Utah for what would-have-been my senior year \nof high school. I finished a year of my undergraduate degree before I was \ntoo burned out on school to continue. I followed a girlfriend of mine into \nthe US Air Force the next year and served 4 years on active duty. In \nGermany, I met and wed the love of my life and we had our first child \ntogether. I was there when she entered the waters of baptism and renounced \nher Lutheran faith so we could be together \"for time and eternity\".\nWhen we returned to the states, I was ordained an elder and we started \npreparing to go to the temple. I finished my undergraduate studies and \ngraduated with a pair of BSs in computer and electrical engineering. I \nlanded my first job at Intel, followed by many other software firms. Our \nspiritual life was also flourishing. We had two more kids and I was called \nto work with the cub scouts, then the boy scouts. I got to baptize my \noldest son. I got to taste of how sweet a life that a faithful LDS member \ncan have. We paid our tithing; we attended church every week. I got my \nhometeaching done on the first Sunday of every month. We had many friends \nand warm relations with our neighbors. I was called to teach one week a \nmonth in elders quorum.\nI have said it before and I will say it again: I loved being a member of \nchurch. Nowhere else have I ever felt such a feeling of belonging and \npeace. There were some seriously righteous and earnest people that I had \nthe good fortune to call friends. I loved my fellowman. My wife would \nconstantly say that I always came home from church on Sunday a completely \ndifferent man (in a good sense). We were praying daily and studying the \nscriptures on a more-or-less daily regimen. Together, my wife and kids had \nmany spiritual experiences. I remember as a teacher, my first home teaching \ncompanion had been our ex-bishop. Where other kids were only going to visit \n2 or 3 families on the last Sunday of the month, my companion was asking me \nto go out almost every week after church to visit 6 or 7 families, and \nsometimes more. His love for people was infectious and a lot of rubbed off \non me. I remember thinking that I wanted to be just like him someday.\nWhy do I mention all this history? The reason is that I want to make it \nabundantly clear that leaving the LDS church was the single most painful \nthing that I have ever done. For a long time I felt like it would have been \nbetter if I had died. And just to head off the inevitable speculations: no, \nI was not excommunicated, nor was I disfellowshipped. I didn't have an \naffair, nor did I have any sexual or grievous sin that is almost always \nattributed to the newly apostate. The reason for my apostasy, ultimately, \nwas the loss of my testimony of Joseph Smith as a prophet, seer, and \nrevelator. I did not start down the dark corridor of faith-destroying \nwebsites. I believe that I was once much like you, and anyone else who took \nto electronic media to defend their beliefs. Before the internet, before \nusenet, I used to actively debate folks on BBS's about the truthfulness of \nthe gospel. In those days, I had didn't have a greatest debate skills, nor \ndid I have the most polished points and counter-points, but what I lacked \nin style, I made up for in raw zeal. I came out of time when the legacy of \nthe prophet David O'McKay was a scholarly approach to religious studies. It \nwas quite vogue to hear around our house growing up D&C 93:36, \"The glory \nof God is intelligence\". I won't belabor this point too much, but suffice \nit to say that in our house growing up, be sought to honor God by emulating \nhim and learning as much about His creation as we could. The beautiful \nthing was that as I was taught as a child and then as teen, God was as much \nthe master scientist, biologist, chemist, mathematician as he was a supreme \nbeing. Thanks to the great era of LDS intellectualism, it appeared that the \nchurch did not dissuade that interpretation.\nBack to my apostasy. It started innocently enough. My monthly lesson in \nelders quorum was on a peculiar topic, even though the subtitle for my \nlessons was \"teachings for our time\". I had been teaching the series for \nover two years when this topic landed in my lap. I had never struggled to \nput together my lesson as much as I did that week. I prayed about it. I \ncalled my elders quorum president and told him that I didn't think I could \ndeliver that lesson that week. He exhorted me to pray about it so that I \ncould gain a testimony of the principle. I made what I felt was an honest \neffort. Bearing my testimony came naturally to me, and I was habitually \nbearing my testimony during my lessons and on Fast Sundays, too. But on \nthis occasion, the spirit was silent. I did not have a manifestation of the \ntruthfulness of it. I called my elders quorum president again and told him \nthat I could not deliver that lesson as I did not believe it and I did not \nhave a testimony as to the truthfulness of it. He reluctantly found one of \nthe other elders to give that lesson that week. I debated with myself \nwhether I should attend elders quorum that week or not. Eventually I \ndecided to attend. Perhaps I hoped that hearing the lesson given by another \nin the quorum would quench my restlessness. Sadly it did not have that \neffect on me. I watched from the back row as my friend, my brother in \nChrist delivered a rather mundane performance. I watched as he bore his \n(uninspiring) testimony as to the truthfulness of the content of that \nlesson.\nRather than feel at ease, I felt more agitated than before. Surely, I \nthought, this cannot be official church doctrine! I could remember a time \nin the church when the subject of that lesson would never have been \npresented or taught as official church canon. I started out on a quest to \nfind out for myself if this was the official word of the church, or whether \nmy own memory was flawed. Like you, I was wary of trusting internet \nresources, so I sought out official church scriptures, conference talks, \nmodern revelation, to see if what I remembered was true, or whether perhaps \nthat this had always been the official canon of the church. Sadly, in my \nsearches, I found that this new teaching WAS official canon. It was not a \nsubject that received a lot of attention, but as a result of the LDS \nchurch's attempting to become more mainstream, more traditionally \n\"Christian\", it had realigned its beliefs on this subject to more closely \nalign with mainstream Christianity. Some would say that it was just a \n\"clarification\", or a \"cleaning up\" of principles that were well \nentrenched. I, however, felt betrayed. Here was the church that claims to \nhave the unerring, unchanging word of God, and it had taken a sacred pillar \nof belief, something that I had believed for almost my entire life, and \nchanged it to help clear up a public image problem.\nThat was the straw that led to a mighty change in my life. My faith was not \ndestroyed overnight. But what entered in was a sliver of doubt. It was \nclear that the intellectualism of the LDS church that I had grown up in was \ngiving way to something else. If the church could change their position on \nsomething as seemingly unimportant (to most people, anyway) what else could \nthey be willing to change? After that, the doubt took hold and within a few \ndays I felt that I was finally looking at the church with new eyes. Points \nand counter-points that I would have debated until I was blue in the face \nwere no longer necessarily wrong to me. I started looking to anti-LDS \nwebsites for nuggets of truth. You are right, however, you can't accept \neverything that is written by many anti-LDS sources. In many cases the \nstories are just outrageous. However there is truth to be found there, for \na person with a curiosity and the patience to help sift the wheat from the \nchaff. There are plenty of historical accounts, studies, and non-biased \nthings in the official church records and doctrine to make one ponder. It \ndid not take long for me to come to a conclusion that Joseph Smith was a \nfraud.\nIf you take even one of President Hinckleys many quotes to the effect that \neither Joseph Smith had the first vision, or we are engaged in \nblasphemy/fraud/sham (take your pick). Given that predicate, I could only \nconclude that the church was false.\nAs I said, leaving the church was extremely hard. I have not had any \ncontact with my extended family for years. We were ostracized in our \nneighborhood except to our closest friends. It has been over 10 years since \nI last set foot in an LDS church. I am not bitter, nor am I angry. I still \nhave member friends to this day (although probably do not know the \nparticulars of my apostasy). I love most LDS people, and I still find LDS \nfamilies to be among the nicest, most moral, and delightsome people. I \nstill believe many of the LDS teachings; love, brotherhood of men, \ncompassion and charity, et Al. but what is missing (and what I do not miss \nin the slightest) is the false doctrine of the church. The borrowed temple \nceremonies, the promises of eternal families (which invokes the mental \nimage of mom, dad, and all the little kids being sealed together as a \nsnapshot of a Normal Rockwell existence) which fades to absurdity when you \nconsider that kids grow up, have families of their own, are sealed to their \nkids, their kids, and their kids until everyone is sealed to everyone and \nthe concept of family is lost. The church as an institution is a fraud, at \nworst, and at best, is willfully misleading.\nTo answer your question: I no longer believe in baptism, eternal marriage, \nor forever families. My mother used to say, \"Either the LDS church is \nright, or none of them are\". I took her expression quite literally, when I \nleft the LDS church, I became a humanist. I love people, a legacy that I \ncarried with me from my earliest days of home teaching with my ex bishop. I \ndon't believe that we need religion to be happy, to be productive, to do a \nmighty good on this world. In fact, I believe, that it is religion that \nneeds us. ",

                    "text": "+Retziel Crimson Yes, a muslim's interpretation. It shows how muslims can \ninterpret it one way just as much as you can interpret it another. That's \nbecause of the ambiguity of not just that verse but the Quran in general. \nThe verse is obviously not clear enough as I've already said muslims around \nthe world find it perfectly inclusive of prepubescent girls. It's easy to \nsee why as the verse does not say it like you say it. Instead it reads as \nif pregnancy is a mere example as to why a women would have not \nmenstruated. Another example would of course be that she has not started \nyet from being too young. Of course, you don't read it that way as being a \nmoderate muslim, presumably raised in the west, your values are somewhat \ndifferent from one raised in Saudi or Yemen. I never said it was only a \nmuslim problem mere that muslims like to legitimize the behavior on their \ntheology. Even in far from impoverished nations like Saudi Arabia like the \nexample I gave earlier. But your right that poverty plays a large part too.\n\nI never said Islam had no influence in your life, you're twisting my words \nif you think i did. I only that it does not have as much influence as it \nhas on people's lives who are raised in more fundamentalist Islamic \ncountries. At least you admit your interpretation is just that, an \ninterpretation. Protection and care of children are values not unique to \nIslam, they are intrinsic in human nature. ",

But since you acknowledge it's someone else's interpretation, then \nwe're getting somewhere. Not sure why you're saying the verse is ambiguous \nto include children? The verse refers to what's to be done in the case of \ndivorce, and if a woman stopped menstruating she is to wait three months to \ncheck if she's pregnant. How can she be pregnant if she didn't menstruate? \nYou still didn't answer that question. Child marriage is a social ill borne \nout of poverty, lots of countries on the ICRW list are majority non-Muslim, \nbut all share widespread poverty.\n\nTo claim that Islam has no influence on my life is false. I'm a Muslim, and \nmy faith informs a lot of aspects of my life. How I choose to interpret it \nis up to me, as God is my judge, not you or anyone else.

That's \nwhy there are so many branches, sects, schools of thought, etc, of Islam. \n\nBut you're right, it iS ambiguous. Ambiguous enough to not exempt \nprepubescent children from its meaning. If the Quran didn't permit such \nthings not only would it be more clear but it wouldn't be interpreted to \nallow it by so many muslims to this day. When you have religious \nauthorities coming out of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam saying \ngirls can be married \u201ceven if they are in the cradle\u201d i think you have a \nproblem. \n\nI did google Yemen's laws. The common understanding may be 9 but there is \nno legal prohibition to marry younger.  Even where it is prohibited it is \nindeed a problem in most, if not all Islamic countries. Especially in the \nrural regions. Even if marriage to prepubescent children is less of a \nproblem marriage of children younger then 16 is a pandemic and is hardly \nmuch better. If you want to argue otherwise i implore you to learn \nPsychology and child development.\n\nHere are some stats for you:\nhttp://www.icrw.org/child-marriage-facts-and-figures\n\nSexual abuse happens everywhere, the difference is in the West we usually \ndeal with it. It happens in Islamic countries too just it's not reported. \nWhen girls, and even women, report abuse or even rape they are often \npunished even further:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/07/20/world/meast/uae-norway-rape-controversy/\n\nIt is a Christian problem too. If you do not hear condemnation for the \nabuse in the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations you are \ndeaf. They do not, however, organize rape gangs nor feel the need to pray \non non-Christian children because they are non-Christian. Muslims in these \nrape gangs just have such a lower view of non-muslims they feel entitled to \ntake out their religiously repressed sexual urges on weak among them. They \nalso justify these actions on the Quran, something no Christian abuser \ndoes. They do also abuse their own only we never hear about it because \nthose abused often fear greater retribution from their family should they \nreport it. I don't smear all muslims for this, I smear Islam for providing \nat outlet to justify these interpretations. Interpretations I'm glad you \nyourself do not follow but, perhaps, its because western civilization and \nenlightenment has had greater influence on you then unfiltered Islam. ",

Also \"and\" is used several times in the \nverse, note that it mentions \"if you doubt\", if the girl never menstruated \nbefore, why would there be doubt? It specifically refers to ambiguous \nsituation, i.e. an old woman, who might have conceived but might not, or a \nhealthy young woman whose menstruation stopped. There might be pregnancy, \nthere might not, and so waiting a three month period to check. If your \nbelly shows you're pregnant, then you wait until you give birth, clear? The \nwords are clear, you just choose to ignore words and add periods (sorry, \npick translations that show periods) where none exist.\n\nYemen's AoC was lowered to 9 not abolished, google it. Most Muslim \ncountries don't have this problem, and CSA is quite prevalent in USA and \nEurope (some stats suggest about a third of people were subjected to \nvarious degrees of molestation, including up to rape). Most of the victims \nare not Muslim. It seems that Britain has seen a rise recently in CSA cases \ninvolving Pakistani men, but again not sure why this would be considered a \n'Muslim problem', when a blond man hurts a child, nobody screams 'Christian \nproblem', make the perpetrators face justice, but don't smear 1.3 billion \npeople while doing it.\n\nMy interpretation is taken from the Qur'an (The real Qur'an, not a \ntranslation/interpretation), and in that there are no periods. Why would \nanyone give their little girl in marriage? The problem is rife in Yemen due \nto extreme poverty, lack of education and opportunity, not because they \ninterpreted it in the Qur'an.",

I only capitalized \"and\" for effect. Only 2 out of the 5 \ntranslations they provide have no period, which still does not invalidate \nthe fact it is a separate idea. \"And\" is usually used within the same \nsentence anyway to denote two completely separate ideas. A post-menstral \nwomen cannot get pregnant either so i don't see your point. \"those who have \nnot menstruated\" is a blanket term which does not exclude prepubescent \ngirls. You're contradicting yourself by saying it refers only to pregnant \nwomen but then saying the waiting period for them is until they give birth. \nIt's either 3 months or until they give birth, it can't be both. \n\nEven before Yemen's age of consent was abolished (not lowered to 9) it was \nrarely enforced and local Islamic customs still prevailed. Yes, most muslim \ncountries do have this problem. They may have reasonable consent laws but \nthat doesn't stop thousands of young girls from being married off from \nwithin their borders. It's always justified via Islam. I didn't say the \nrest of the world is perfect but most of it, especially the West, does not \nhave this problem within our own customs. It's only being brought here by \nimmigration, mostly (though not exclusively) muslim. \n\nOf course, you cannot accept any of this this because it goes against your \nown interpretations.

Surely, they \ncan't get pregnant, then why doubt?

God is separating the wheat from \nthe tares.\nI was once a Mormon but fell away when I was young (praise God!). Never had \na testimony of that church nor their beliefs. All the people were corrupt \nspiritually. Which leads me to believe, people with corrupted spirits will \nflock to the church because they are around people who are like them. Those \nthat don't have corrupted spirits will fall away from mormonism and be lead \nby the Holy Spirit to the truth, which is the Word of God.",
