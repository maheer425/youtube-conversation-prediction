To sum what \nothers have put more eloquently, if time travel is possible and there is a \nsingle mutable timeline then the past, present and future will be in \nconstant flux due to meddling time travelers. The only variable which needs \nto be changed to end this flux and restore stability to the timeline is the \nuninvention of time travel. Therefore, a universe without time travel is \ninfinitely more likely than a universe with time travel, and all \nindividuals who invent a time machine will be rewritten out of \nexistence/killed/maimed/made unable to invent a time machine.",

Again, this is all based on possibly \napocryphal accounts, but the bull was, indeed, heated, and Perillos was \ntortured in it for a time, before Phalaris ordered him removed from it. \nThen Perillos was thrown off a hillside to his death on Phalaris' order. So \nwhile the injuries suffered while in the bull probably did nothing for \nPerillos' state of health before his execution (especially since there's no \nmention of a gap between these events), it was the injuries suffered from \nthe fall down the hill that actually killed him.\ufeff",

Orville did, \nhowever, end up in an accident in one of the models of the Wright Flyer \n(the 1909 Model), but he survived, but the person flying with him, an Army \nOfficer from Fort Myers, Virginia, did die in the Crash. Ironically enough, \nOrville lived until 1946, Outlasting Wilbur, who died of Typhoid Fever in \n1912, and was able to attend the ceremony for the Wright Brother's Memorial \nin Kitty Hawk, which dedicated the first recorded account of man flying in \na powered, heavier-than-air Flying Machine. \n\nNow, another interesting fact that I may want to  mention is that, where I \nlive, we had the first usage of an areal vehicle in a warzone. Between May \n31st and June 1st, 1862, the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines erupted nine \nmiles East of the City of Richmond, Virginia. North of the Battlefield, \n across the Chickahominy River, a Hydrogen Balloons were launched up into \nthe air, which acted as a observation point and eventually aided in the \ndefense of the Union against the Confederate assault. This was the first \nofficial use of an areal vehicle in a warzone and it was the first time \nthat an Areal vehicle turned the tide of a battle. The site of the Battle \nof Fair Oaks is now where Richmond International Airport resides and they \nhave an aviation museum near the airport with a monument dedicating the \nhistorical event next to the Museum. \n\nI know my stuff. ^^",

                "text": "Actually Thomas is actually thought by many to have committed suicide in \nhis 'Rope Bed'. Why?\n\nWell, go back to the late 1910's. Motors where growing more powerful, and \nmore impressive. But with this came a problem: knocking. Knocking is the \nresult of one or multiple [usually multiple] pistons running so quickly \nthat when gas is injected into the chamber the piston head comes up and so \nquickly that the gas explodes pre-maturely before the spark-plug goes off, \nwhich is what is *supposed* to cause the explosion. Along with the annoying \nknocking-like noise it can eventually lead to engine damage, and even \nengine failure in extremely bad cases [usually if left alone for waaaay too \nlong].\n\nA company who was trying to cure this hired Thomas. He originally proposed \nalcohol from wheat [if I'm correct; it may have been something similar], \nbut his boss denied it, saying literally half the country would need to \nbecome farms in order to supply what was already out there.\n\nThomas eventually found lead mixed with petrol also worked, which also only \nrequired a tenth of an ounce per gallon to be effective. However, during \ntesting Thomas became victim to lead poisoning due to this, though he \nrecovered. Unfortunately, most of his mechanics and co-workers were not so \nlucky. In its first two years alone the company lost about 75 mechanics due \nto lead poisoning or related to lead poisoning. Although states banned it \nfor a short time which after it was published as 'toxic' the company went \nto court claiming it was safe...and won. Although the success was major, \nand Thomas literally earned millions, many think that he felt guilty about \nthis. Although we don't know and might never know if it was intended to be \nsuicide, it is known he was aware of what it could do.\n\nInterestingly when lead gasoline was banned altogether in 1996, a year \nlater the national IQ levels went up by an average of two points. Also, \nThomas was correct; his original solution worked very well [required a \nlittle more but gave the same results] and although a little more was \nneeded compared to lead it still did not turn half the country into \nfarmland.\ufeff",
