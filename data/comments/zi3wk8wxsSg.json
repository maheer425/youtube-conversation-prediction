                "text": "i am a little disappointed that this video was a little less informative \nabout tips and tricks that a Guan Yu can do and how to counter him compared \nto the first 2 videos that you made about Neith and Ymir! i can list you \neven more tricks and tips! please take this as constructive feedback \nbecause i feel like you missed on these points! for example and this is the \nmost important thing about Guan Yu that players always seem to not know \nabout is how to control the Ulti! it is a new form of movement that cant be \nsteered by the WASD but does in fact steer with your mouse and your forward \nand back buttons! if you push your forward button (W) you move faster if \nyou press (S) you slow down and by doing so it makes it easy to get those \nUlti hits on your enemy by speeding or slowing down if you have some gods \nthat juke you and this trick can help! another trick is that if you start \nyour attack with your dash and channel the 3 seconds Taolu assault it is \nguaranteed to hit the full 3 seconds on your enemy because they are slowed \ndown plus at the same time the dash will get CD reduction because you are \nusing another skill and it will get off CD for you to be able to chase down \nthe enemy again! another trick also is that Toulo assault pushes the enemy \nminions back so its a great tool specially in the solo lane to push the the \nmelee minions back to the range minions and then be able to hit your dash \non all of the minions guaranteed to get them all! last but not least the \nbest way to counter Guan Yu is to hit him with CC before he hits you! if \nyou can disrupt a Guan Yu full frontal attacks by denying him the ability \nto engage and start fights then you can easily win because Guan Yu rely too \nmuch on his skills rather than his Auto-Attacks so if he get the CD rolling \nthe best way to stop it is by locking him down! i really hope that the next \nvideos will be more informative like the Neith and Ymir because i was \nreally disappointed of the lack of tricks and tips on this one... Guan Yu \nis my favorite God and i was really looking forward to this video :(\ufeff",

                "text": "Guan Yu will shit on you... only a noob would think Guan Yu is bad or you \nnever seen a good Guan Yu yet.  I have only lost 1 out of 12 of my recent \nmatches with Guan Yu...  Guan Yu certainly shits on people and I have 1v2'd \nmany people with Guan you and forced them to stop fighting me.  I will list \nall the reasons why Guan Yu does not suck below.  If your a noob you will \nprobably have to open the \"Read more Tab below\" because if your noob enough \nto call Guan Yu bad your also noob enough to not know how to open the rest \nof my comment explaining why Guan Yu does not suck.\n*Why Guan Yu does not suck*\n\nHis Taolu Assault (3) does like 550 fucking base damage at max rank, and it \nsteals 30 protections.  First off al realize that is a lot of fucking \ndamage and mostly nobody is going to want to fight Guan Yu when he is \ndealing all of that damage to your face meanwhile gaining defense while \nyour losing defense.  YES Steal protections means that not only is Guan Yu \ngaining your protections but he is also TAKING THEM FROM YOU meaning you \nare weaker and have 30 less protections when you keep getting hit by his \n3.  That move zones like hell as well, I have 1v2 people because they chase \nme and I just back away while 3ing them and they do not want to chase me \nany more after the realize I will just zone them while running backwards \nthen heal up.  So this move pretty much allows Guan Yu to 1v1 MOST note \nMOST Gods in the game who cannot cancel this ability.\n\nHis heal (1) - Yes his heal is weak by itself, but its not his weak heal \nthat makes him good, his passive is okay but its not even the fact that his \npassive makes up for part of his weak heal.  The fact that his heal heals \nteam mates as well is already better than a regular heal.  On top of this \nit reduces all your cooldowns by 2 seconds??? Yes, I don't know about you \nbut a CD reduction heal that heals my team as well is not shit.  Yes the \nheal is weak but with the 2 forms of CD reduction Guan Yu has in his kit he \ncan spam his heal on his team to the point where he has a strong heal and \nhe sustains his team and lanes.\n\nHis dash warriors will (2) - This ability isn't that great by itself, its \ndamage is okay and the slow is just good for using your 3.  What makes this \nability great is the fact ONCE AGAIN it reduces all your cooldowns by 2 \nseconds... so combined with your heal that means Guan Yu can CONSTANTLY \nREDUCE HIS COOLDOWNS BY 4 SECONDS over and over again.  That means he can \nspam shit over and over and his ult comes back fast, his heal comes back \nfast and his damage comes back meanwhile you are waiting on your long ass \ncooldowns while he is healing up his team and doing what he wants with his \nother abilities.\n\nGuan Yu's ULT (4) - This is what makes Guan Yu SHIT on people.  His ult \nliterally SHITS on people.  It is the MOST DAMAGING PHYSICAL ULT IN THE \nGAME!!!  That means if you eat his fucking ult you will be dead unless he \nwent tanky.  His ult makes most Gods unable to escape him, the damage on \nhis ult means most Gods will not survive after getting hit with all of it, \nthe fact that its a team fight ult and he can hit an entire team with that \ndamage, and the fact that it stuns at the end makes Guan Yu a damn beast.  \nOnce you get your ult you almost have a free kill on whoever eats your ult.\n\nGuan Yu DAMAGE is WAAAAY SUPERIOR to Guan Yu tanky...  trust me, I have \nplayed many tank builds and some are okay but damage Guan just shits way \nharder, when you go too tanky your ult does not do what its suppose to, \nwhen you build to tanky your just healing and not doing enough damage to \nkill.  When you build damage people strait up DIE from you left and right.\n\nI prove Guan Yu does not suck, play him in solo lane and do this.\n\n#1 Buy transcendace as your first item on him in solo lane before boots.  \nYa, think it sucks, until you realize that you have a shit ton of mana to \nspam heals and you have so much power from the stacks that your 3 and ult \nshits on everything you come in contact with.  Every time I bought \ntranscendence I pretty much dominated my lane.  I seriously forgot about \nthis item, one day I tried it on Guan Yu and I use it most of the time in \nSolo because I do so much damage with it and have more mana to spam \nabilities without having to back.\n\n#2 Buy pen boots, CDR boots are food noobs, Guan already has CDR in his kit \nand pen is a actual stat that will deal more damage in combo with \ntransendance.\n\n#3 Buy Jotunns wrath, right now you probably have full stax on \ntranscendence and with all of this damn pen from boots and jotunns in combo \nwith a shit fuck ton of damage from your first item with stax, you will \nobliterate anyone who faces you in a strait 1v1 duel, if your ult is up its \npretty much GG for them. \n\nI usually shit on the enemy God about 2-3 times by now and probably taken \ntheir tower by this time, usually the enemy team surrenders by this point \nbut assuming they don't your next step is to judge how OP you are at this \npoint.\n\nIf your super fed, fuck it just go more damage, buy something like brawlers \nbeat stick for more pen and anti healing if they have Ra or Aphro, or just \ngo buy witchblade to make you out box them even harder and speed yourself \nup.\n\nI usually only pick up like 1 or 2 tank items MAX.  Mostly I build damage.\n\nIn solo, just 3 the wave, if they have someone who can stun you out of your \n3 then you have to use your 3 on the wave side ways, meaning you move \nsideways so its hard to hit you, most noobs just go strait into the wave \nand get outstunned which is why they think Guan Yu sucks dick but he \ndoesn't.  Guan Yu actually clears pretty fast, and then just heal the wave \nup when they use an ability to troll them. \n\nThe way you win solo is easy as shit.\nDo damage to their wave, heal your wave up, then you LET THEM COME TO YOU.\nYou let them leave tower and troll them into fighting you.  Act like your \ngoing to back to make them want to stop you like all the trolls usually do, \nonce they are too far from tower just jump on your fucking Horse and make \nthem realize why they don't fuck with Guan Yu.\n\nYour ult alone will either kill hem or almost kill them.  The stun at the \nend will just set up for your 3 or dash.  They basically DIE EVERY TIME.\n\nTell me Guan Yu is bad again?\ufeff",

If you're one of those noobs who \nalways care about KS and big plays like penta kills, you will not do well \nwith Guan Yu at all just like Aphrodite.
