            "text": "D: What&#39;s up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com dustinsfishtanks bringing it to you on an Easter Sunday. Hope you all are having a wonderful Easter Sunday and spending some quality time with your family, eat good food, doing some Easter egg action that sort of thing. To be honest the household of mine Nola was up like ten times last night puking. She is at home with mommy chilling out. Mya and I are over at Steve&#39;s house. We got Species Sunday for you today. Not actually a fish, not actually a plant, but my man&#39;s got some skill with Discus and I want to show you how he does it, so get a little white worm action. Is that right brother? Take it away because I just don&#39;t do this stuff man, so talk about it.\nS: Discus can be thick eaters and the food can be expensive especially, if you are buying tons of blood worms or tons of plaque, or tons of beef heart. If you do a planted tank with Discus you want food that is nice, that doesn&#39;t dirty the tank like beef heart or too much flake. I grow my   own culture white worms. They are not in the perfect shape right now, but I will show you what I do. This is right now and I am going to throw out this moldy bread. They eat bread and I have got some pieces of glass here that I used to hold them. Eventually, from time to time you will see that the worms would just group up at the bread. Unfortunately I moved this box a little while ago. Look at there, you can just see tons of white worms. If you put a new piece of bread up they will come up to the new piece of bread eat a little hole out of it and you can grab them and feed them to your Discus. See if I can enough to get them over here.\nHere is what I do. I take some old stale bread, a nice new piece like this, I put just a little bit of  water...\nD: So is it new or is it stale?\nS: It&#39;s tale...I put it down here and I use something to weigh that down. I typically use like a piece of glass or something. That just holds it down and eventually you are going to see so many white worms just build right up here at the top. You are going to have a handful of white worms to just throw in for your Discus. Discus love them, other fish love them. They will go right up on the glass and they will eat them like crazy. I am sorry I don&#39;t have a bunch to show you right now. But if you grab these few right here I will show you...\nD: Real quick before we go over to the tank: What is all the brown stuff underneath? What is all that?\nS: That is just dirt!\nD: That is straight up dirt?\nS: Top soil dirt! Don&#39;t use anything with fertilizer in it. Obviously, because you are going to kill...\nD: Did you like the seed them?\nS: I bought a little lab culture. Here&#39;s a bunch more.\nD: Should I sell this on aquaticjungles?\nS: You could!\nD: No, that&#39;s tight dude. These bugs fly up.\nS: I am keeping it in my garage and my wife obviously won&#39;t let me keep it inside. I probably don&#39;t want to anyways. But I got some worms right here. Let&#39;s throw them in the Discus tank. \nD: As we walk over here brother, what&#39;s the temperature you are trying to keep them at ideally?\nS: They like it cool. They don&#39;t like it much hotter than 70. So anywhere from forty to seventy would be great. That&#39;s why I keep in garage.  Once it gets hotter, I don&#39;t know. I will probably move them into a cool place in the house somewhere, but here you go. Let&#39;s watch.\nD: They go crazy for them.\nS: They are high fat, high calories to make your Discus good and fat real quick. Great food! Love them! They wiggle around, the Discus get all excited. That guy is not going to mess with them. Those two are going to mess with them. Because I have got two pairs right now in the same tank and both laid eggs. Can you get a close up on those eggs back a bit?\nD: No man, I would hate to show off the discus eggs. Absolutely! The Barry Manlow Discus, right here dude! You are able to get these hot finicky, because we have compared them to hot chicks before. They need expensive food, but you are getting them to breed. That&#39;s so tight dude. Now I want everybody to put in the comments how badly you want Steve to raise these, so he just has to dedicate his life.\nS: I just want a cool looking tank with some cool looking fish!\nD: It looks sweet. There&#39;s pair number one all right side there. Look at these ones! These guys have been getting down.\nS: Yes, pair number two!\nD: That is awesome bro! It is so sweet.\nS: This tank is going great. I don&#39;t have the filter running while I feed them, because it will suck the stuff in, but I will get the FX pipe plug back in a second and clear up the water. Working on the tank, trying to get the glosso growing a little bit better.\nD: Looks good dude!\nS: White worms man! Growing them on my filter. Growing free food for your fish!\nD: And the fish obviously love it.\nS: Discus love it, and the cool thing is they are terrestrial animals. They grow on land, so you want get any parasites that fish can get from white worms. Unlike other live food you can give them. That&#39;s a cool thing to do.\nD: That&#39;s very cool dude! Loving the tank.\nS: Ultra healthy, ultra high calories, big fat discuss!\nD: Loving it dude! How long have you been feeding them the white worms?\nS: I do it about once or twice a week. If you feed them too much they will only eat white worms. They will give up everything else. I grab earth worms from the yard every now and then. They love those earthworms too.\nD: That&#39;s awesome! Your tank looks great man! Looking good, Discus over here just getting buck. Everyone make it a great week, happy Easter Sunday folks!",
