                    "text": "+Z estiny You make A LOT of assumptions about religion.  As I said before I \ncare about truth, spirituality and \"heart\" of religion are not special \nthings you can only get from religion.  \n\nYou can feel just as much and more wonder and spiritual(and when i use the \nword spiritual i mean NOTHING supernatural but that is the best way to \ndescribe the feeling so that you will understand it) fulfillment from \nscience and the universe alone, instead of stories that can't be proven you \nget the real thing.\n\n The cosmos in all its glory, and you feel better then religion could ever \nmake you feel because you know its actually real, you can test it, you can \nsee it with your eyes, you don't have to take anything on faith, making it \nfar greater then any religion could ever hope to be.\n\n\"And when you find your self being moved around like a sheep you start to \nquestion which is part of human nature and then you try to find proof which \nis not meant to exist\"\n\nYou do not know that proof is \"not meant to exist\".  This is one of the \nassumptions you're making without any good reason for it and part of why \nthe logic you use is faulty.  That is the indoctrination of religion \ntalking, for all you know there is a god and he wants you to settle for \nnothing less then proof.\n\n\"Then you learned alot about cases where religion was abused for power \n(which is clearly human fault) at that point you had already decided that \nreligion is just not your thing\"\n\nI've decided truth is my thing, if the truth is in a religion then that is \nwhat I want, its just that so far none of them bother to try and find truth.\n\n\"To sum it up you were most likely introduced to religion in the wrong way \nwhich made you shackled by it and had to break your self free\nI cant blame you for that \"\n\nI can't say I ever felt shackled by it since I never truly believed it, \nthere are plenty of atheists out there that believed in religion with all \ntheir heart sometimes for most of their lives.  I was not one of those \npeople but you can't deny that they are out there who understand exactly \nhow you feel about it and still ended up caring more that what they \nbelieved was real rather than having faith.\n\nLastly I have a question for you, if you respond to anything in this post \nplease respond to this.  If the truth of the universe was that there is no \ngod, and someone could prove it to you with 100% certainty beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and it was actually the truth, would you want to know?",

And through religious texts we can see what they were \nworshipping and how they worshipped hundreds of years ago, maybe learn a \nlittle bit about how they moralised in those days.\nBut I think in this modern age, ancient belief systems that may have worked \nthen (Or maybe been the cause of a load of wars, I don't know.) maybe \noutdated now. Maybe even harmful. I've heard that people who believe in \nreincarnation are more reckless with their lives, thinking they'll be \nreborn again.\nI do make the distinction between, let's say the 9/11 bombers, and a \nMuslim. They were simply terrorists, their motive was political, but it had \nan ethnic and sectarian element to it.\nIf you've studied the history of northern Ireland, you will notice similar \nmotives for violence. A mixture of socialism and religion and sectarianism \nis a dangerous thing.\nLike cannibalism, I don't think it does society any good.",

Not everyone's mind can \nbe changed of course, and some people are convinced for bad reasons and \nsome for good reasons.  \n\nI was brought up catholic always having to go to church every Sunday, until \na random day in my early teens I came to the realization that I didn't \nactually believe any of it, so after that I was an atheist, although at the \ntime I had no idea that word even existed.  And I readily admit at that \npoint in time I had no good reason to not believe in god, it was a gut \ninstinct that I didn't think god was real, and that is not a good reason.\n\nIt was only after years of looking into religion and its history that I can \nsay I had good reasons for my lack of belief.  Knowing its history and how \nit was used in the past along with the psychology of belief in humans is a \ngreat way to understand why people believe extraordinary ideas even when \nthey have no evidence to support them.  I still find religion very \ninteresting even if none of the stories it tells are real, and whether I \nlike it or not it is a part of humanities history and culture so you can't \nignore that, lest you repeat the mistakes of the past.",

The brain is made mostly \nof fat, so that's important, and if you want to build muscle you need a \ncertain amount of protein which is hard to get from vegetables, especially \nconsidering that blending can denature protein. Real food to me is anything \nthat comes from nature, incl eggs (especially the yolk), lots of green \nveggies, some fruit, meat from healthy, naturally raised animals and \neverything else in between. The human body has many complicated functions \nlike hormone production (again mainly fats involved here) and you should \nstrive to feed it with as many different things as possible. Eliminate \nsynthetic and natural toxins and you will be fine. I try not to follow any \n\"food religion\" and always stay open to new information.",

To do so, break your fast by 3 dates, and a cup of \nwater, wait for 5 minutes, then take soup, after you are done, wait for \nanother 15 minutes, then eat your food with no more than 500 calories, and \nkeep the sweets to a later time..... this helps tell youd body that there \nis food coming, so it wont store it all!

Normally we will break fast at 7.18pm or maybe longer.. but I don't \nknow why when I break my fast, I don't have much appetite to eat my foods, \nwhich is kind of weird.. \n\nWhen comes to activities like playing floorball or etc (I play floorball \nkeeper btw hehe) IT REALLY SUCKS!!! I really need water so badly!!! But to \nkeep myself from dehydration, we can just rinse our mouth or wash my face, \nits really refreshing hahaha!! I still can play, but I don't give my 100% \nso that I can conserve my energy heh lol! \n\nI know that fasting is good for health so why not try to fast with us too? \nIm just asking by the way, im not forcing you guys to do it ;) but it give \nus long live right? So why not give it a try for just one day or so? Haha! \n\nFor those who have read my whole text, thank you really much for your time \n:) im just sharing my experience.. \n(Hopefully no mean comments)\ufeff",
