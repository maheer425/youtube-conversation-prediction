They see it as a \"me\".

They assume that because they have this same body, \nthat the body is them or is part of them or they exist within the body or \nthe body exists within them or the body exists because of them... whatever.\nIn any notion of self-identification, there is the notion of a permanent \nentity which exists all by itself. The personal traits, the tendencies of \nour actions, our opinions, all of that junk \u2014 those are just mental objects \nwhich the mind grasps onto and identifies with because of its ignorance. \nPeople tend to identify with these things most because the mind seems \nconsistent to them although it is changing every single second. These \npersonal traits or opinions constantly come and go, they are never the \nsame, but people still give them an aspect of permanence and \nsubstantiality, so they develop an identity-view in regards to them. If \npeople knew impermanence with the heart rather than with \nintellectualization, they wouldn't do this.\nThe 'self' is a fabrication of ignorance. Science is never going to find \nthis 'self', they will only find things which people have attached an \nidentity to. \"I think therefore I am\" is only the identification with \nthoughts, which do not arise because of a \"self\" but because of a natural \nprocess of causes and effects.
