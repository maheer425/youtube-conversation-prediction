                    "text": "+Dominik Tichy lol..The Director's Cute better explains it.  I'm probably \ngoing to explain it poorly but.....\n\nSpoilers obviously \nThe movie begins with an airplane engine crashing through the house, which \nwould have killed Donnie, but the bunny lured him outside. The airplane \nengine actually comes from the future, and in finding a \"worm hole\" or \nwhatever, it's creates or disrupts this altered universe by crashing into \nthe house days before it was suppose to. (Like 32 days or something) Donnie \nis chooses as the person to \"fix\" this problem and set things right in \norder to save this alter universe. Some of the communications Donnie has \nwith the Bunny suggests this may not have been the first time he has \nattempted to \"Set things straight\" and he could have failed time and time \nagain before hand. \n\nIt's hard to explain, as I barely understand myself. But pretty much every \nline, every action in the movie has a deeper many and purpose behind it. \n All the destructive actions Donnie takes all are leading up to the ending \nof the movie which is needed to \"fix\" the universe. And Donnie's death is \nexplained as either because Donnie couldn't exist in the \"fixed\" universe, \nor because he realized his existence would lead to his girlfriend's death. \n\nAgain I don't fully understand either. But these are from explanation I \nread online, because I am a cheater. I honestly just like Donnie's \nCharacter and the sheer randomness the movies SEEMS to have. I think it's \nsuppose to look like a series of just random events with no purpose, when \nreally there is a purpose and meaning behind it all. It comes from the idea \nthat life itself is just a series of events with no purpose, but we often \ngive it purpose and make it out to be grander than what it really it. But \nthat part is just my opinion. ",

First to project or assume \nwithout reason is declared the loser. I have no time to waste on people \nlesser educated than myself that loop in cognitive biases and fallacies.\n\n1.) Chemical Imbalance isn't even a theory, it's only a hypothesis \naccording to both the NIMH and the APA.\nThis is a solid, legally verified fact by their own paperwork. There have \nbeen zero, I repeat zero tests to prove chemical imbalances in patients.\n\n2.) There is zero data on the conceptual belief that \"behavioral \ndisorders/diseases\" are caused by any damage to the brain. They are defined \nby distress, which according to the award winning research of Steven Pinker \nis actually a good, positive, evolutionary reactionary trait when the \ndistress motivates people.\nStress only becomes a nuisance when:\na.) Environmental distress is not assessed, and it increases distress \n(usually ending in suicide - NIMH. Rosenhan)\nb.) Ignored environmental distress triggers hereditary reactions and it \nannoys others (Thomas Szasz, Rosenhan)\nc.) Distress is used as a coercive measure, such as in bullying or \nconformity demands (Thomas Szasz).\nAll three of these examples suggest that the origins or distress are not \ndiseases or innate imbalances, but instead manufactures by an environment \nthat causes distress and then ignores the cause for any number of reasons \n(egotism, laziness, self-serving bullying, etc...).\n\n3.) The idea that chemicals that sedate people or get them high therefore \ncombats chemical imbalances is no different than declaring that taking an \naspirin to cure a headache proves your brain has a negative imbalance of \naspirin. Sedatives help ease pain, but that doesn't mean the pain is \nirrational or part of a disease.\n\n4.) Finally, the fallacies you committed:\nA.) Argument from ignorance (claiming the chemical model is correct with \nzero information)\nB.) Argument from authority (where then entire \"imbalance\" hypothesis lays, \nsince it is only a hypothesis)",
