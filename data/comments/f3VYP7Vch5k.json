It just means you feel \nuncomfortable with the behavior, which doesn't necessarily mean you can't \nor won't respect them.\n\nIn other words, it's YOU who don't know what \"homophobic\" is. It's \nanalogous to how black people get offended for being referred to as \"black \npeople\" and say \"it's racist\", in the way YOU misunderstand it.

It's no \"atheist \ntheory\"; here're three well-voiced explanations (stating exactly what I \nhad; that Mosaic Law is nulled) by theists:\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/resources/commentaries/IVP-NT/Gal/Understanding-Law\nhttp://biblethumpingliberal.com/2011/05/19/you-can%E2%80%99t-quote-leviticus-to-prove-god-hates-homosexuality/\nhttps://bible.org/article/mosaic-law-its-function-and-purpose-new-testament\n\nI'm certain you're going to obstinately refuse to read any of those links \n(you won't read your own bible; there's no way in hell you're gonna read \nanything else)... Let me tell you exactly what's being said in all three \nlinks: That physical manifestation of the law is WRONG. We're not talking \nabout the SINNING, we're talking about the PUNISHMENT. Anything that is \nsaid to be worthy of punishment in the law is NOT TO BE PHYSICALLY CARRIED \nOUT ANYMORE. That is directly stated to be VERY VERY WRONG. The entire \npoint of Galatians is to teach you that, even though you probably oughtn't \nbe doing anything stated in the Old T, you MUST NOT punish people. The only \nrequirement is to be spiritual on your own time. That's an enormous part of \nthe New Testament (a very prominent, recurring theme). You're not \nencouraged to sin, but rather you are commanded to only deal with it \ninwardly (spiritually). They specifically state NOT to make official laws \nof the Old T. again and to ONLY be spiritual. In terms of homosexuality, \nyou're expected not to do it, but you MUST NEVER STOP SOMEONE FROM DOING IT \nAND NEVER PUNISH THEM FOR DOING IT. This subsequently means \"it's none of \nyour business, leave people alone,\" but you don't exactly care about \nrespecting other peoples' lives or privacy, as you want homosexuality to be \na sin worthy of punishment. Granted, I personally don't believe in that \nbullshit (that the most natural of actions that is both pleasurable and \nrewarding, emotionally and physically, is \"sin\"... even if there was a god, \nhe doesn't hate homosexuality enough to stop it), I just let people do what \nthey want so long as it doesn't harm anyone else.\n\nI'm sorry you're unable to understand this on your own. I have explained it \nmany times and even provided links for you from many sources. Hell, this \nshit is even on Wikipedia, if you'd bothered to do even the laziest of \nresearch binges. It's in scholarly articles that're peer-reviewed, as well. \nAND IT'S STATED MANY TIMES IN THE BIBLE ITSELF. There's NO actual debate on \nthis, other than YOU managed to not read the bible and only listened to the \nlies you made up on your own time to fill in the blanks of what you didn't \nunderstand. (The King James bible has a horrific history of not being the \nword of god, by the way. It's the most revered version [and claimed to be \nthe most \"accurate\"], but it doesn't even sort of resemble the \"true word \nof god.\" Yet you people still follow it. That's insane.)",

                    "text": "+Autocratic Snowman And there's your problem: You don't understand the \ndifference between sex and reproduction (and yes, there's a biologically \nprogrammed difference). There are different levels of both urges in our \ngenetics; meaning attraction to genders/sexes is not necessarily linked to \nthe yearn to reproduce. (By the way, the concept of \"homosexuality\" wasn't \nmade until just recently; past cultures recognized it as part of sexuality, \nnot a separate sexuality... this is a common misinterpretation by people \nlike yourself; you assume that, because there's a separate section \nspecifically for homosexuality, that it's a \"different\" sexuality, not PART \nOF the sexuality that everyone has. Contemporary society is about ramifying \nand defining, not segregating [scientifically speaking... socially, it's \npractically the opposite].)\n\nAnd I never claimed the contrary that you didn't agree with homosexuality. \nI'm telling you that you're incorrect in stating that it's \"unnatural.\" \nBiologically, it's 100% natural. Your last explanation (about the temporal \ngenetics theory) is rather dated and unpopular, but it progresses into a \n\"natural\" explanation, nonetheless.

That's what every \"Huh, I guess \nRay Lee decided to opt out of the conversation\" comment you made was. Don't \nbe stupid.)\n\nI've done plenty of research (reading the bible was part of that; which you \nobviously haven't done... and if you did, you failed to understand it). You \nremember Paul? Apostle Paul? He wrote a rather extensive letter in the New \nTestament about how the old law was nulled whereupon one accepts Jesus's \nfaith. That's what the entire section is about. That's what most respected \nscholars concur upon, as well (even without their input, it's clearly \nstated). \"Old law\" is Mosaic Law; the first five books of the Old Testament \n(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). This law is no longer \nin effect so long as you accept Jesus as your savior. \"But that no man is \njustified by the law in the sign of God, it is evident: for, The just shall \nlive by faith. And the law is not the faith: but, The man that doeth them \nshall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, \nbeing made a curse for us [...]\" and \"But the scripture hath concluded all \nunder sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them \nthat believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up \nunto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was \nour schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by \nfaith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a \nschoolmaster.\" Seriously, look it up. READ your bible. Galatians. It \nexplains that, even if everything covered in Mosaic Law is \"sinful,\" it \ndoesn't matter because when you accept Jesus's faith, you are no longer \nbound by the consequences associated with Mosaic Law. Better start ignoring \nthe word of Jesus (god) if you want Leviticus to matter.\n\nThat answers your first question. Your second question is self-evident in \nthat you didn't read/understand your own bible.\nThe last ones (\"How did I pervert/misquote\" the bible?\")... Leviticus 20:13, \nLeviticus 18:22, 1 Timothy 1:10-11, Romans 1:32, 1 Corinthians 6:9 are the \nverses you used in your argument. We already know that anything in the \nMosaic Law is nulled if you believe in Jesus, so precious Leviticus is \nvoid. The Corinthians and Timothy verses do NOT specifically state anything \nabout homosexuality/sodomy. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 states \"neither \nfornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of \nthemselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor \nrevilers, nor extortioners,\" not sodomites or male/male lovers. \"But it \nsays 'effeminate!!'\" Okay, so your god meant no sissies (hetero or homo). \nJust buff guys. \"But that's not what he meant--\" Sorry, YOU don't get to \ninterpret your god's word. He was unclear and imperfect; he wrote it in a \nlanguage he knew wasn't universal and accurately translatable. So he's \neither a dick or a moron. But I've digressed...\n\n1 Timothy 1:9-10 also supports my earlier answer to your first question... \nit also states that \"the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the \nlawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and \nprofane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, \nFor whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for \nmenstealers, for liars, for perjured persons,\" not sodomites. Sorry to \ndisappoint you. It'll save you some emotional/social-whiplash if you stop \nmisinterpreting your beloved bible.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the golden Romans 1:32. HURRAY! You finally \nfound the ONLY verse in the entire bible that specifically mentions \nhomosexuality and is in the New Testament! HOWEVER, it's not about \nhomosexuality in general; if you would stop taking everything out of \ncontext, this section talks about your god getting mad at people for \nsinning, so he forces them into homosexuality. \"For this cause God gave \nthem up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural \nuse into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving \nthe natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men \nwith men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that \nrecompense of their error which was meet.\" Again, scholars agree (and it \nclearly states) that the god is forcing the people into homosexuality as \npunishment (he's not punishing people for being homosexual). In fact, many \nbiblical scholars regard the mentioning of \"forcing into unnatural acts\" as \nthe god forcing heterosexuals into homosexuality (causing it to be an \n\"unnatural act\"). By the way, only a few lines later, you're specifically \ncondemned if you've ever disobeyed your parents. That means if you've EVER \nbeen grounded or something, you're going to hell. No negotiations. So, I \nguess you'll be in hell with homosexuals.\n\nAnyways, learn what your bible really says before condemning people. Too \nmany lives have been damaged because of it.",
