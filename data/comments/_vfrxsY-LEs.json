Although, when I \nonce worked at a place 9 tram stops away from my home for one year, I only \nbought a ticket twice, and never got checked (the ticket inspectors usually \nseem to avoid rush hours where you can't move through the car). One of the \ntwo tickets was because at my stop, inspectors were getting on the tram, \nand so I just went to the ticket machine and got one. However, only a \nKurzstrecke (short trip) which is good for 6 stations instead of 9. I was \nlucky, but in other cases, I have also had bad luck.\nThe best way to ride without a ticket works on trams (in busses also, but I \ndon't use them very often): You buy a ticket at a subway or s-bahn station \nvending machine, but don't validate it. Then inside a tram, you position \nyourself next to the validation stamper and if you get checked, you stamp \nit to show it. If not, you can take another ride ;-)",

Cabbies can tell you almost every time, how much a \ntrip will cost when you ask them before getting on the cab. Also, if you \nwave a cab from the side of the street, instead of getting on one that \nwaits at a taxi stand, you may ask for the \"Kurzstrecke\" (short trip), \nwhich is good for up to 2km and costs you only 4\u20ac - this is something other \ncities don't have. But, in any case, don't forget the generous tip, because \nlike everywhere, cab drivers are working minimum wage jobs.
