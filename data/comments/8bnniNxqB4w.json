                "text": "While it is scientifically proven that physical activity can be a very \neffective tool in helping with mental illness, I find it rather audacious \nof this guy to generalize depression as if all types of the illness were \nthe same. Yes, making these changes may work for certain people with \ncertain types of depression and that may be all the help they need and that \nis fantastic! The changes he mentioned can also be a good place to start or \ncan be a good addition to other types of treatment. I think I get where he \nis trying to go with it and the point he is trying to make by dumbing down \nideas of mind-body connection and brain chemistry and that sometimes the \nsolution is simple and doesn't HAVE to include medication-I guess just to \nme it came across like he was suggesting that people suffering from \ndepression just need to eat less sugar, get off their arses and gaze at the \nsun for a while. Which as someone who has been actively fighting depression \nfor many years of my life, I find to be a pretty insulting \nover-simplification of a complex mental illness with many different facets, \nunique individual manifestations and a vast range of severity. Oh, and I \ntried that whole work-out and change your diet thing and it did in fact \nhave a very negative side effect (yes, just like with some medications) \nwhen I got addicted to it (again, just like people can with some \nmedications too) and because of the way my brain chemistry at the time \nfunctioned, I developed an eating disorder. Obviously that is not going to \nhappen to everyone, I am just trying to make the point that there is not \none cure-all and I don't like the way this guy implies that the use of \nmedication (plus a variety of other kinds of treatments out there that he \ndidn't even bother to talk about) is somehow the 'wrong' way.\ufeff",
