Indeed Sicily, and in particular the town of San \nVito lo Capo, also hosts yearly \"Cus cus fest\", a world-wide \"sagra\"-tipe \nfestivity with cooks from throughout the world, during which the best cus \ncus cook is selected. http://www.couscousfest.it/ (The website is available \nin several languages.) Obviously, though, for the presence of cuscus in \nItaly we must be thankful for the Arabs that ruled southern Italy in the \nMiddle age!",
