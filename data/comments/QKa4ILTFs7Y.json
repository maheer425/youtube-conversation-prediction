If \nthe violent protesters decide to attack Russia supporters as they have in \nother Ukranian cities, that could escalate into a full civil war and where \nRussia would have to use deadly force to counter it. It was smart of Russia \nto police people who consider themselves Russians. People only look at this \nlike the Ukranian people are of a singular mind, like poor rebels fighting \na huge empire, but it's not that simple. Russia is in the right to protect \nthe people that rest of Ukraine may not protect or even attack.\ufeff",

Don't get me wrong, you can read something else I just posted \nabout American journalism. American news reporters aren't a bunch of angels \nunwilling to bend over forward for those that butter their bread either. \nIt's more of a matter of whose worse and more obvious. I'd give you that \nour news media and politicians are worse, especially with Obama, but Russia \nis worse, as is the case in all communist countries where the media is \nowned and run at the behest of the government. Russia kills its own \nreporters that are willing to stand up the the lies of Putin and the rest \nof the political machine, but they have to tread much more softly and less \nobviously in their broadcasts here. Don't worry, where RT leaves off, the \nleftist media in America picks up. I don't agree that reporters need to \nshut up and take it and leave quietly if they disagree. The news media was \ngiven the privilege of 1st amendment rights for a single reason, as a \nprotector of the citizens against abusive government. As long as they fight \nagainst what's wrong with government, they are really doing their jobs. \nBeing silent is what Putin demands of his reporters and to say only what he \nwants them to say. It's the same in N.Korea, China, and any totalitarian \nstate like any of the many Muslim countries. Saudi Arabia routinely gives \nout punishments of 1,000 lashes, 50 at a time, to anyone that criticizes \nthe islamic rule. A blogger is being given that punishment right now. Putin \njust poisons them if he doesn't imprison them for life. Castro has them \nkilled or reeducated depending on the offense. No, media should be very \nopen to point out the bad that's done against citizens, especially in \nAmerica, given any respect and professionalism due, but not cowering. \nSheryl Attkinson pays a high price for not keeping silent. She's incredibly \nawesome for what she does. ",
