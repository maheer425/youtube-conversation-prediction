If \nyou're not willing to invest days or weeks to applying, leveling, \nreapplying, and leveling as many times as is needed for you to be \nsatisfied, then you can always get it repainted.  This video shows how \ntouch up can be applied to achieve show quality results, but as you can see \nthe area he is applying touch up is very small.  The larger the area that \nhas to be covered, the easier it will be noticeable to the naked eye that \nthere was touch up applied.
