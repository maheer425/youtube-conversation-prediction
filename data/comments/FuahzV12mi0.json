Try to go to conferences, meet people and \nmake connections. Amanda Simpson, the first transgender presidential \nappointee, was openly transgender at Raytheon, where she was Deputy \nDirector and Senior Program Manager leading teams developing advanced \ntechnology in the Advanced Missiles and Unmanned Systems Product Line.- On \naerospace engineering, what an amazing story!

I saw the images from the probe and from that moment, I knew \nthat space was all I ever wanted to do with my life.  I still remember \neverything about that moment.  I was in the Navy, in Miami, and I was on \nwatch.  It was about 9:00 in the evening and I was on an eternal hold \nwaiting for a painfully pointless conference call when the link popped up \nin my facebook feed.\n\nHanging in with the family...  Right now I need to keep my family close in \ncase I need to move back in with them after school.  But I'm about this \nclose to being completely done with them after that.  Seriously, I don't \nneed this from them.\n\nIt's great that the job market is becoming more accepting, but as yet I'm \nnot aware of any specific instances of success in the aerospace industry. \n Boeing apparently has a very good transition program for existing \nemployees.  Nominally, so does Lockheed Martin, but I know at least one \nLockheed employee who was fired soon after her coming out.  Getting in the \ndoor is what concerns me, since in the end, it's all about the impression \nyou leave with a person.  The company can say \"great transgender health \nbenefits\" all day long, but if the hiring manager doesn't like transgender \npeople, it's so easy for them to think of some BS but legitimate sounding \nreason for passing over them, up to and including \"I just didn't think they \nwere the right person for the job.\" That's my fear, anyway.  I went to the \nschool's career fair last year and the reception I got there wasn't \nnegative.  Surprise, confusion, clearly put them off of their cadence.  No \njob, though.  Which is more a function of it being my first semester there \nthan anything else.  The school is really bad about bringing in commercial \nspace companies, though.  This year we had Orbital Sciences.  That's it. \n Boeing showed up, but they weren't hiring for commercial space.  Only aero \nengineering majors and business types.  So I don't really have a good feel \nfor the commercial space industry.",

Here is \nanother truth: we have all been taught different truths. Here is one more \ntruth: the human mind and the human body is a complicated place, and origin \ntales or gender binary myths are not enough to explain most human \nexperiences. Most of us conform and interpret these truths so that we can \nmerge with the world that we perceive.\n\nThis can be seen in how we represent ourselves as that is how we confirm in \nour heads that we are what we are supposed to be. The mind and the body \ncollaborate to perpetuate these truths. However, some people are born so \ndifferent that they cannot interpret the truth to assimilate and the \nacceptable forms of self-representations contradict who they actually are. \nThere is no room for compromise.\n\n These people threaten the rest of the world because they stand as proof \nthat the truth that we have believed as being carved in stone and absolute \nare actually not what they appear to be. After which we are left with two \noptions: de-construct and re-construct our beliefs, which is harder but \nwill result in less human casualties, or vilify and systematically \nmarginalize the people who do not adhere, which is easy but can result in \nas many casualties as millions. \nYou must be wondering why I can empathize with Karissa.

People the world wishes didn't exist. The world would like to \nignore us and they do, but doesn't mean we stop happening. And here is the \nbiggest truth of all: We are as real as you. The less you dismiss us as \naccidents, problem-creators, liars, villains, etc, better the world will \nget for everyone. And....the more you will understand yourself. \nAnd I think, you need to engage in a dialogue with yourself.

And not to stir a debate or anything, but I think, if \nyou know and you feel in your heart that you are, in fact, \nextraterrestrial, and you believe it enough that you'd jump into the next \nspacecraft headed to mars to be with your people, then who's to say you are \nnot? If you BELIEVE that you can be, should be, would be a doctor, a \nscientist, an astronaut, a superstar, or a dog, then you can't let other \npeople tell you thath you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't. Coz, isnt that the \npoint of \"identity\"? That which you believe to be true about yourself? \nWhatever kind of identity we are talking about, sexual, professional, \nsocial... it all boils down to what you believe to be true. And no one \nshould be able to prove you wrong about your self concept, except you. So \nif you identify as an extraterrestrial, I won't believe you are, but I \nwould accept that and respect your belief because no one in the world knows \nhow or why you feel that way.",
