The only issue I'd have is that the Phenix (Jean) is \nsupposed to be more powerful than even Professor X (at least Professor X \nsays that's the case, could be a lie I suppose). Anyway that's the movie \nlore. In the comics she definitely was stronger than him.

So, what if that scene where him and Eric go to see Jean is all real \nto Eric, Jean, and Logan and something they actually experienced, but in \nreality Charles was never  there. He somehow used Cerebro to even trick \nJean into thinking he was there knowing somehow things would go bad and he \nmight not make it out alive. So to Eric, Jean, and Logan Charles is killed \nright in front of their eyes, but really he is just in hiding. He did this \nknowing the rest of the xmen would need something to rally around, and what \nbetter than the death of their leader. So, much later on, as this serum to \n\"cure\" mutants is wearing off of most mutants, the sentinels are beginning \nto be used to hunt down the mutants, and the world is being thrown into \nchaos again, Charles comes out of hiding, apologizes, pisses everyone off, \nbut then works with Eric and party to try and stop the sentinels who have \ngotten out of hand.\nCould that be it?",

He only lost \nhis immortality and healing factor, and even those were restored at the end \nof the movie. Professor X on the other hand isn't clear. At the end of \nX-Men 3 it was hinted that he had somehow transferred his consciousness \ninto another person's body. However, this seems to have been scrapped due \nto him having his old body in Days of Futures Past. My only guess is that \nhe somehow rebuilt his body with his powers, or that he somehow made the \nnew body look like his. Of course neither of those makes sense so your \nguess is as good as mine on that one. : /",

Obviously things have changed but it \nisn't like  future Logan went back and told past Professor X and the others \nthe entire future so they are likely to do the same things just slightly \ndifferent and with perhaps better outcomes since Cyclops and Jean Grey are \nstill alive in the new future.

Also how \ndid Future Wolverine still have his metal claws when he lost them in \nWolverine? Also how is Professor X alive in the future if he died in The \nLast Stand?",
