Then what about the conditions? Some feudals were \nharsher than other slave owners, so what is it? Even now some bosses treat \nworkers worse than other slave owners treated their \"cattle\", not to \nmention the wealth gap that is incomparably wider nowadays. \nSo is it possible for slavery not to exist in that way? Some people will \nalways do better than others and some much much better, does it just come \nto work conditions in the end? Any capitalistic economy will generate such \ninequality. Will it be possible in a communist community? \nIn Russian, the word for \"work\" or \"job\" is RABOTA, \nguess what the root of the word stands for? \nRAB - slave. \n\nSo it all comes to drawing lines. \n\n(communist thing didn't work, tried it)",

                    "text": "+Mk101T First, when did I say there has never been a white slave? I never \nsaid that. I said there has been slavery independently of whites, meaning \nthere were cases where white people were not doing the enslaving, nor being \nenslaved (again, examples in South America and Asia of cultures enslaving \none another, without contact with whites). Second, Egyptians did enslave \nJewish people, but long before that they also enslaved other groups, \nincluding black people from Nubia (who Egyptians called Ta-Seti). If you do \nsome research, you will find that Egyptians not only took slaves from the \nmiddle east (including Jews, which some consider whites), but also slaves \nfrom south of their empire (who we now call Africans). This happened before \nand during their enslavement of middle easterners, so again, I don't see \nhow you think that white people came up with the concept of slavery.\nSlavery really cannot be attributed to any one group. Different groups have \nenslaved others throughout history, even when they lack contact with the \nworld at large. The sad fact is that slavery is a HUMAN concept, not a \nwhite, black, or Egyptian one. Even though Egyptians are the first to be \nrecorded as having slaves, I am willing to bet that slavery predates them; \nit likely predates the written word/records. That said, I do not deny that \nwhite people took the concept to a whole new level (first the Romans, and \nthen the Atlantic slave trade), and that we have definitely made ourselves \nfamous for it.",

Your comment can be paraphrased as this: \"Whites are terrible \nfor enslaving others, so now we should enslave them.\" Tell me you see the \nirony and hypocrisy there. Also, slavery has existed independently of \nwhites, so I don't think we are entirely to blame. We definitely ran with \nthe concept, but Egyptians enslaved black people long before whites such as \nthe Greeks and Romans came along and picked up the concept. Peoples in \nSouth America enslaved each other, long before contact with Europeans, and \nthe same is true in Asian cultures. True, we may have had the largest \nslave-trading network, and may have enslaved more people than any other \ngroup (though I am not even sure that much is true), but we are not the \nonly ones who practiced slavery, nor can the concept be traced back to us \n(it existed before whites came to power).

Or even the modern low-wage \nwork/sweatshops?

Equating a low-wage job with poor \nworking conditions to slavery, where your children are born as property and \ncan be beaten/raped in front of you? Low wage work might be fruitless, \ndangerous, or even a bit degrading, but it does not compare to actual \nslavery; saying otherwise disrespects actual slaves, and shows a lack of \nunderstanding when if comes to the spectrum of exploitation and oppression. \nWould you honestly compare working at McDonald's with a sex slave who is \nbeaten if she refuses to be raped by men three times her age?

That is a drawback of limited intelligence robots: they \nhave no thoughts/concerns for themselves (in terms of \nfreedom/revolution/self-protection), but they also are not capable of \nthoughts/concerns for humans either. A certain degree of fear/respect for \nthe danger of machinery is necessary, but you don't need to fear their \nuprising.

                "text": "I was a little hopeful, at first, as the presentation starts out by \nadmitting that slavery was common, in Africa, before white people arrived.\n\nIn fact, it was totally common everywhere for most of human history.\n\nAnd while Transatlantic slavery affected some 10 to 14 million individuals, \nthe Trans-Sahara slavery by Arabs / Muslims had started much earlier \n(probably even before Mohammed) and was totally justified by Islam. It \naffected about 70 million Africans. And about 1 million Europeans were \ntaken as slaves by Muslims, until France invaded Algeria, which put an end \nto that practice.\n\nIn fact, the word for \"slave\" and \"black person\" are IDENTICAL, in Arabic: \nabd. \"Abdullah\" means literally \"slave of Allah\" and that happened to be \nthe name of Mohammed's father, i.e. Allah was venerated BEFORE Mohammed.\n\nMohammed approved of slavery and held slaves himself. He even explicitly \nsupported the rape of slave women - and pedophilia, as he thought it was \nperfectly ok to rape a 9 year old girl.\n\nWhich is why Muslims still see nothing wrong with slavery and keep \npracticing it in various forms. Every so often, we hear about Saudi or \nEmirati diplomates who are found holding slaves in their homes in western \ncountries.\n\nAs another illustration, Gadaffi's son was arrested in Geneva, Switzerland, \na few years ago, over his treatment of \"employees\", a man and a woman he \nwas regularly beating up, i.e. he didn't treat them like employees, he \ntreated them as slaves.\n\nEuropeans didn't suddenly have the idea that they could import slaves from \nAfrica. They never even set foot inside the continent until the late 18th \nand 19th century. They found fully working slave markets on the coasts of \nAfrica, operated by Muslims.\n\nThe truly remarkable thing about Europeans was that they OPPOSED slavery on \nmoral grounds and MADE IT ILLEGAL, then went on to hunt down slaver ships.\n\nThat was an absolute first in all of human history. For the first time, it \nwas declared, as legal and enforced principle, that no human being may hold \nanother human being as property.\n\nThe Abolition movement started around 1750 and was founded by Christians, \nwho saw no justification for the practice of slavery in the Bible (NB: I'm \nNOT Christian, I'm Atheist).\n\nThe amazing thing is that the usual suspects keep bashing Christians for \nbeing responsible for the transatlantic slave trade and ignore that it was \nChristians who OPPOSED and ABOLISHED it. Were there hypocrites who LIED and \nclaimed that the Bible approved of slavery? Sure. Liars are everywhere. But \na closer study shows that the Abolitionists were right - and won.\n\nWhich also proves that a MAJORITY of Europeans saw blacks as PEOPLE with \nrights! (if it hadn't been a majority, the abolitionist movement would not \nhave won).\n\nThe same moral crusaders totally ignore the EXPLICIT support for slavery in \nthe Quran, Mohammed's example as slave owner and slave rapist and the far, \nfar greater harm caused by their enslavement of 70 million Africans!\n\nArabs who took slaves always castrated the men, which made it not just \nslavery, but an act of genocide. It explains why there are practically no \ndescendents of those 70 million African slaves in Arab countries, while \nTransatlantic slaves were even encouraged to have children and represent a \nvery large minority in all the Americas.\n\nDid the slave trade cause a few major political changes in Africa? Maybe, \nbut far more so because of the Arab slave trade, wouldn't you think so? And \nI'm not even all that convinced - long before Europeans arrived on the \ncoasts of Africa, Sub-Saharan tribes had been continuously at war with each \nother, which was the origin of the \"winner takes all\" tradition: the \nstrongest warrior or king could take multiple wives - hundreds, if he \npleased and was really powerful - the weaker ones got nothing.\n\nAnd why was the fact that mostly men were taken a bigger problem? I'd say: \njust the reverse! If mostly women had been taken, that would have ended up \nlike a genocide.\n\nBut as Europeans took mostly men, the impact on the African demographics \nwas minimal. Within a generation, the population could always be restored \ncompletely.\n\nSo sadly, overall, I see that this video perpetuates a culture of excuses, \nwhich will do nothing, for Africa, and it keeps blaming white people for \nsomething a tiny minority of white people did (only 1% of all the Europeans \nin the Americas owned slaves, throughout history), instead of celebrating \nthe extraordinary achievement by Europeans to legally and morally condemn \nslavery for what it is: a heinous crime!\n\nAnd it fails to point at those countries that still support slavery, \nbecause their dominant religion approves of it.\n\nSo ultimately, it is historically incorrect, as it is incomplete, just \nrepeats the same old narrative and tries to make white people feel guilty \nfor something no one currently alive has even the most remote connection \nwith.\n\nIt also fails to point out that the COST of slavery was far, far greater \nthan the benefits. Slave societies are always poor and backward.\n\nRead Frederick Douglass (a self-freed slave who became an abolitionist \nwriter and activist) who found, to his amazement, that a free black man in \nthe North was able to live better, as farmer, than most people in the South \nwho owned slaves. As described in \"My bondage and my freedom\".\ufeff",

This was crucial to those Western European countries which, in the \nlate 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas \nempires. Why is it always USA getting blame for these black slaves.....The \nPortuguese were the first to engage in the New World slave trade in the \n16th century, and others soon followed. Ship owners considered the slaves \nas cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as \npossible, there to be sold to labour in coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar and \ncotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, construction \nindustry, cutting timber for ships, in skilled labour, and as domestic \nservants. The first Africans imported to the English colonies were \nclassified as \"indentured servants\", like workers coming from England, and \nalso as \"apprentices for life\".\ufeff",

The most \nrenowned group of \"maroons,\" as they were called, escaped to the mountains \nnear Veracruz. Unable to defeat these intrepid Africans, the colonists \nfinally recognized their freedom and allowed them to build and administer \ntheir own town. Today, their leader, Yanga, remains a symbol of black \nresistance in Mexico.\n\nOther slaves rebelled or conspired to. The first conspiracy on record took \nplace in 1537, and these assaults on the system grew more frequent as the \nblack population increased.\n\nRegardless of the form it took--escape or rebellion--resistance \ndemonstrated an angry defiance of the status quo and the slaves' desire to \nreclaim their own lives. As such, black resistance occupies a special place \nin Mexico's revolutionary tradition, a tradition that is a source of pride \nfor many Mexicans.\n\nBeyond that, Africans in Mexico left their cultural and genetic imprint \neverywhere they lived. In states such as Veracruz, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, \nthe descendants of Africa's children still bear the evidence of their \nancestry. No longer do they see themselves as Mandinga, Wolof, Ibo, \nBakongo, or members of other African ethnic groups; their self identity is \nMexican, and they share much with other members of their nation-state.\n\nYet their cultural heritage has not entirely disappeared. Some African \ntraditions survive in song, music, dance, and other ways. But much has \nchanged since slavery ended, and it is difficult for a small minority to \nmaintain its traditions in a constantly changing society.\n\nAs their ancestors did, the few remaining persons who are visibly of \nAfrican descent continue to be productive members of society. But history \nhas not been kind to the achievements of African peoples in Mexico. It is \nonly within recent times that their lives have been studied and their \ncontributions to Mexican society illuminated. Suffice it to say that \ncontemporary black Mexicans can claim this proud legacy and draw strength \nfrom it, even as they become a shrinking part of their country's peoples.",

As indigenous peoples \nwere killed or died from European diseases, blacks assumed a \ndisproportionate share of the burden of work, particularly in the early \ncolonial period. African slaves labored in the silver mines of Zacatecas, \nTaxco, Guanajuato, and Pachuca in the northern and central regions; on the \nsugar plantations of the Valle de Orizaba and Morelos in the south; in the \ntextile factories (\"obrajes\") of Puebla and Oaxaca on the west coast and in \nMexico City; and in households everywhere. Others worked in skilled trade \nor on cattle ranches. Although black slaves were never more than two \npercent of the total population, their contributions to colonial Mexico \nwere enormous, especially during acute labor shortages.\n\nWherever their numbers permitted, slaves created networks that allowed them \nto cope with their situation, give expression to their humanity, and \nmaintain a sense of self. These networks flourished in Mexico City, the \nport city of Veracruz, the major mining centers, and the sugar plantations, \nallowing Africans to preserve some of their cultural heritage even as they \nforged new and dynamic relationships. Although males outnumbered females, \nmany slaves found spouses from their own or other African ethnic groups. \nOther slaves married or had amorous liaisons with the indigenous peoples \nand to a lesser extent the Spaniards. In time, a population of mixed bloods \nemerged, gaining demographic ascendancy by the mid-eighteenth century. \nKnown as \"mulattos,\" \"pardos,\" or \"zambos,\" many of them were either born \nfree or in time acquired their liberty.\n\nAs in the rest of the Americas, slavery in Mexico exacted a severe physical \nand psychological price from its victims. Abuse was a constant part of a \nslave's existence; resisting oppression often meant torture, mutilation, \nwhipping, or being put in confinement. Death rates were high, especially \nfor slaves in the silver mines and on the sugar plantations. Yet, for the \nmost part, their spirits were never broken and many fled to establish \nsettlements (\"palenques\") in remote areas of the country.",

                    "text": "In \"Dixie's Censored Subject: Black Slaveowners\", published in The Barnes \nReview, Robert M. Grooms furnished several examples of Black slave owners \nin the USA.\n\n\"In the rare instances when the ownership of slaves by free Negroes is \nacknowledged in the history books, justification centers on the claim that \nblack slave masters were simply individuals who purchased the freedom of a \nspouse or child from a white slaveholder and had been unable to legally \nmanumit them. Although this did indeed happen at times, it is a \nmisrepresentation of the majority of instances, one which is debunked by \nrecords of the period on blacks who owned slaves. These include individuals \nsuch as Justus Angel and Mistress L. Horry, of Colleton District, South \nCarolina, who each owned 84 slaves in 1830. In fact, in 1830 a fourth of \nthe free Negro slave masters in South Carolina owned 10 or more slaves; \neight owning 30 or more. \n\n... The majority of slaveholders, white and black, owned only one to five \nslaves. More often than not, and contrary to a century and a half of \nbullwhips-on-tortured-backs propaganda, black and white masters worked and \nate alongside their charges; be it in house, field or workshop. The few \nindividuals who owned 50 or more slaves were confined to the top one \npercent, and have been defined as slave magnates. \n\nIn 1860 there were at least six Negroes in Louisiana who owned 65 or more \nslaves The largest number, 152 slaves, were owned by the widow C. Richards \nand her son P.C. Richards, who owned a large sugar cane plantation. Another \nNegro slave magnate in Louisiana, with over 100 slaves, was Antoine \nDubuclet, a sugar planter whose estate was valued at (in 1860 dollars) \n$264,000 (3). That year, the mean wealth of southern white men was $3,978 \n(4). \n\nInterestingly, considering today's accounts of life under slavery, authors \nJohnson and Roak report instances where free Negroes petitioned to be \nallowed to become slaves; this because they were unable to support \nthemselves. \n\n... [regarding Black ex-slave William Ellison] As with the slaves of his \nwhite counterparts, occasionally Ellison's slaves ran away. The historians \nof Sumter District reported that from time to time Ellison advertised for \nthe return of his runaways. On at least one occasion Ellison hired the \nservices of a slave catcher. According to an account by Robert N. Andrews, \na white man who had purchased a small hotel in Stateburg in the 1820s, \nEllison hired him to run down \"a valuable slave. Andrews caught the slave \nin Belleville, Virginia. He stated: \"I was paid on returning home $77.50 \nand $74 for expenses. \n\n...Following in their father's footsteps, the Ellison family actively \nsupported the Confederacy throughout the war. They converted nearly their \nentire plantation to the production of corn, fodder, bacon, corn shucks and \ncotton for the Confederate armies. They paid $5,000 in taxes during the \nwar. They also invested more than $9,000 in Confederate bonds, treasury \nnotes and certificates in addition to the Confederate currency they \nheld.\"[39]\n\nAs an interesting sideline to Black slave owners in the South of the USA, \nis that there were also an estimated 65,000 Southern blacks in the \nConfederate military, including over 13,000 who fought against the North in \nbattle.[40] \n\nA well-known and favourably reviewed novel, The Known World, by Black \nauthor Edward P. Jones, has tackled the issue of Black-owned slaves, much \nto the surprise of those readers who had never heard of Black slave \nowners.[41] However, the interesting story of Blacks who owned slaves is \nlargely ignored by the media and educators.",

According to the \nfederal census of 1830, free blacks owned more than 10,000 slaves in \nLouisiana, Maryland, South Carolina, and Virginia. The majority of black \nslave owners lived in Louisiana and planted sugar cane.[37] \n\nJohn Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger, in Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the \nPlantation, revealed that conditions under Black masters could be such that \nslaves would run away.\n\n\"The largest black slaveholder in the South, John Carruthers Stanly of \nNorth Carolina, faced a number of problems in the 1820s in dealing with a \nslave labor force on his three turpentine plantations in Craven County. \nWith a total of 163 slaves, Stanly was a harsh, profit-minded taskmaster, \nand his field hands would run away. Stanley dealt with this through his two \nwhite overseers and with a spy network that included a few trusted slaves. \nBrister, his slave barber in New Bern, was responsible for relaying to his \nowner rumors of planned escapes ...Nor did Stanly have any pangs of \nconscience about selling children away from their parents or holding free \nblacks in bondage.\" \n\n\"Free black slave owners who lived in urban areas - Charleston, Savannah, \nMobile, Natchez, and New Orleans - also faced difficulties with their slave \nproperty. Free mulatto barber William Johnson of Natchez was not certain \nwhat had happened to his recently purchased slave, Walker, when he \ndisappeared in 1835. He had either been stolen or had run away to Kentucky \nto rejoin his wife. When on 4 July 1833, authorities in Ascension Parish, \nLouisiana, jailed the twelve- or fourteen-year-old black boy named Isaac \ntaken off the steamer Watchman, he admitted he was owned by a 'free woman \nof color in New Orleans named Jane'.\"",

                    "text": "Black slave owners in the United States\n\n\nLittle has been published regarding those Blacks who owned Black slaves in \nthe USA, however, more research is bringing this little-known subject to \nlight. \n\nPhilip Burnham, in the article \"Selling Poor Steven\" published in the \nFebruary/March 1993 issue of American Heritage, found that in the US Census \nof 1830 there were 3,775 free blacks who owned 12,740 black slaves.[32] \nBurnham wrote about the slave John Casor, who was denied his freedom by \nBlack slave owner Anthony Johnson.\n\n\"In the 1640s John Casor was brought from Africa to America, where he \ntoiled as a servant for a Virginia landowner. In 1654 Casor filed a \ncomplaint in Northampton County Court, claiming that his master, Anthony \nJohnson, had unjustly extended the terms of his indenture with the \nintention of keeping Casor his slave for life. Johnson, insisting he knew \nnothing of any indenture, fought hard to retain what he regarded as his \npersonal property. After much wrangling, on March 8, 1655, the court ruled \nthat \"the said John Casor Negro shall forthwith be returned unto the \nservice of his master Anthony Johnson,\" consigning him to a bitter lifetime \nof bondage. Given the vulnerable legal status of servants - black and white \n- in colonial America, the decision was not surprising But the documents \nreveal one additional fact of interest: Anthony Johnson, like his chattel \nCasor, was black....\"[33]\n\nCarter G. Woodson, whose grandparents and father had been slaves, was one \nof the first to write about the Black slave owners. In Free Negro Owners of \nSlaves in the United States in 1830 (published in 1924) Woodson gives the \nnames and number of slaves owned by free blacks counted in the U. S. Census \nof 1830, listing them by name and the number of slaves owned.[34]\n\nMichael P. Tremoglie, in \"The Black Roots of Slavery\" also noted the issue \nof Black slave owners.\n\n\"There were many free blacks in the American colonies. They were \nenfranchised and as early as 1641, Mathias De Sousa, were elected to \nlegislatures. These free blacks owned slaves - some for philanthropic \nreasons, as Carter G. Woodson suggests. However as John Hope Franklin \nwrote, \"...free Negroes had a real economic interest in the institution of \nslavery and held slaves in order to improve their economic status.\" \n\nThe census of 1830 lists 965 free black slave owners in Louisiana, owning \n4,206 slaves. The state of South Carolina, lists 464 free blacks owning \n2,715 slaves. How ironic it is that so many blacks owned so many slaves in \nSouth Carolina. Yet, no one seemed to mention this during the flag \ncontroversy. \n\nSome blacks served in the Confederate army, which is another omission in \nour popular culture. The movie Glory did not happen to mention that blacks \nserved in the Confederate army. It did give the impression that the black \nsoldiers in the 54th Massachusetts were former slaves - which was not \ntrue.\"[35]\n\nHarry Koger, in Black Slave Owners. Free Black Slave Masters in South \nCarolina, reported on the success of Black women in Charleston.\n\n\"By 1860, so many Black women in Charleston had inherited or been given \nslaves and other property by white men, and used their property to start \nsuccessful businesses, that they owned 70% of the Black owned slaves in the \ncity.\"",

No Atlantic Slave ship touched the St \nLaurence. African Slaves rarely passed through Canada for labour, and the \nones that did were brought through by American slave owners. Relatively, \nCanada compared to the entire continent, had seldom used slaves for \neconomic production. The populations of Canada were able to sustain \nthemselves quite well without heavy slavery. In Canada, our injustices \naren't committed so much towards Black Canadians, rather towards Aboriginal \nCanadians.

That is time and stress that you can avoid.\n\nThe thing about Canada is there were no cash crop or highly desired \nresources that were well suited to slave labor.  The fur trade required a \nskilled woodsman that would have to operate alone or in small isolated \ngroups.  Even if you found an African slave able to navigate the wilderness \nof Canada, he could use those skills to disappear into the Canadian \nwilderness.

What is your point? \nHow does what you say address the glaring omission of the islamic slavery \nenterprise? \n\nOf course (!!!) slavery occurred in all combinations and permutations \nbetween every race and other groupings etc., but SO WHAT!! Was there a \nUNIVERSALLY commensurate level of ANTI-slavery activism???\n\n\nYour idea that civilizations were built on slavery only holds so much \nwater. Civilizations and societies which were based on the freedom and \ndignity of the individual (at least in principle if not always in practice) \nand a free market and free trade were/are far more successful and \nprosperous. Slavery just pushes labor prices down and devalues voluntary \nlabor thereby creating other problems. And before you go citing slavery in \nthe US or North America, realize that HARDLY ANYONE on the North American \ncontinent owned slaves and only a very small minority of rich people in the \nsouth did. Slavery only benefited a minority, never the broad majority.\n\n\nAnd another thing: the slavery in North America was (relatively) benign - \nie the least worst form. If you compared and contrasted what occurred in \nNorth America with what muslims did to their slaves, you'll see the \ndifference.\n\n\nWe're not trying to defend the egregious muslims now, are we Mister \n(possibly-Left-leaning) +Tastentier ???",
