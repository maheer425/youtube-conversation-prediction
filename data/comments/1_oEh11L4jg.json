It was in \n1943 that the Cairo Declaration was created by the USA and later in 1943 at \nthe Tehran Conference, the plan for Korea was hatched.\n\nIt said that Korea would be occupied for at least 40 years and would be \npartitioned among multiple non-Korean nations. All this was created by the \nUSA.  In 1945, the USSR had no agenda in Korea according to Russian \nhistorian Lankov, who specialized in Korean studies.  \n\nIn 1948, the Soviets left Korea. Since 1945, the USA wanted to make Korea \ninto a colony along with Taiwan with the goal of using them to contribute \nto Japan's economic recovery, knowing that the Japanese would be lucrative \ntrading partners on the world market, which they became, as they are the \n3rd largest economy on the planet. \n\nIt was the USA who persecuted the independence, unification and democracy \nmovements of Korea in the 1940's and it was the USA who claimed operational \ncontrol of South Korean forces as they executed those in Korea who wanted \ndemocracy and independence as well as unification from a partition they \ndidn't vote for.  \n\nIt was the USA who killed 1/3 of the population of Jeju Island in the \n1940's, where protests to US occupation were held and where Korea's \ndemocratic refugees fled.  \n\nIt was the USA who supported Korean puppet president Sygnman Rhee in the \n1940's as he terrorized North Korea with cross-border raids and attacks. \n It was the USA who supported the violent crush of the Kwangju Uprising in \n1980 against South Koreans who opposed the US-endorsed military \ndictatorships in South Korea. \n\nIt was the USA who dropped over 9 million tons of napalm on Korea in the \nKorean War and killed 3 million people.  It was the USA who blew up the \ndams and irrigation districts in North Korea in 1953 which caused flooding, \nfamine and starvation.  It was the USA who threatened to use nuclear \nweapons on a Korean nation who only wanted independence from foreign \ninterference from 145-1953. Korea did nothing wrong.  \n\nIt was the USA who continued to persecute South Koreans with their \noperational control of South Korean para-military forces from 1953-1998. \n It was the USA who dropped dummy atom bombs on Korea in the Korean War as \na form of rehearsal for dropping the real bombs.  Thank God they didn't do \nthat. \n\nIt was the USA who thereafter scattered 50 Atomic Demolition Mines in Korea \nand armed F-4 Phantom fighter jets with nuclear warheads in Korea and \nconstantly threatened North Korea for no reason, because North Korea didn't \nhave nuclear capabilities until the 1990's, and it was mainly for energy \npurposes, not weapons.  The USA also had nuclear weapons on naval ships and \nsubmarines stationed in Korea.  \n\nIt was the USA who threatened North Korea with nuclear bombs in 1968 when \nthe North Koreans discovered the USA naval spy ship, the USS Pueblo \nviolating its national territory.  North Korea released the crew unharmed \nafter 11 months. \n\nIt was again, the USA who knew that Kim Il Sung froze his nuclear program \nto negotiate a peace treaty in the early 1990's and STILL threatened to \nbomb North Korea.  And like I already said, in 1993-94, 1998, 2000 and 2003 \nthe North wanted to get rid of it's nuclear program and they were being \nhonest because inspectors of the IAEA as well as satellite spy vessels \nreported no suspicious activity, but the USA refused to accept that North \nKorea was not hostile and continued to threaten North Korea.  \n\nNorth Korea has never been hostile outside of simply RESPONDING and \nRETALIATING to USA aggression and aggressive threats.  It was president Kim \nDae Jung and president Roh Moo Hyun (1998-2008) who were moving toward \npeaceful unification, but Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye have both agreed \nwith USA aggression toward North Korea and those 2 presidents along with \nthe USA reversed 10 years of progress on the Korean peninsula's effort \ntoward peace and unification, as well as aid for the North Korean people.",

First, neither LBJ, Clinton, Bush or Obama ever came close \nto war with North Korea. I live in America, if there was ever any \ndiscussion of us going to war with another country I think I would have \nheard about it, lol. But, for the sake of argument, let's say they did. \nComing close to war is *NOT* war. In order for your conspiracy theory to \nwork America would actually have to use humanitarian reasons as \njustification for going to war and then actually go to war.\n\nFurthermore, if America really wanted to go to war with North Korea we \ncould have easily done it *before* they actually had nuclear weapons. As \nfor the NK army, if America wants a pretext to go to war with North Korea, \nwhy would that matter? You can't claim that America wants to go to war with \nNorth Korea, then claim we don't want to go to war with North Korea because \nwe don't want to fight their army. That's a contradiction.\n\nDude, seriously, snap out of it.",

But the duration - decades - and the guilt by \nblood condemnation of whole families, makes North Korea especially horrific \nwhen it comes to state brutality. \n\nThis is the first state to make \"thought crime\" an issue of blood libel as \nwell. If your uncle says something which could be interpreted as critical \nof the daily corn ration that means you and your spouse and your kids, \nalong with your sibs, nephews and nieces, and parents, are all going down \nto the internment camp for \"re-education.\"\n\nI am not trying to say regimes like, say, Pol Pot's weren't horrific at \nall.

With that in \nmind, when you're saying \"So informing, and discussion yes, but blaming \nsomeone for not having solution while you have none either is what I'm \ncommenting on,\" is perceiving him as a hypocrite, which in fact is not the \ncase since he did his job of supplying a solution.\n\nHe is blaming the US, but that's because we are the double standard nation. \nWe talk about how we want liberty, but a huge pluralities of particular \ngroups want it only towards their convenience. Liberation and rights are \ndifferent, in that rights grant you privileges(they may or may not be \nnaturally endowed to you, but rather a social agreement based on popular \nbelief), while the other gives you freedom, based on it's raw definition. \nWe fight for rights, and forget that some people may lose their liberation \nthrough it. You may choose your own examples in mind to support this, but \nthere are quite a few so be as creative as you like. Point being, we want \nwhat's good, but we instantly lose momentum for that cause if it comes at \nthe convenience of what we've grown comfortable having in our lives. We \ndon't do well with sacrifice in our country of entitlement.\n\nThat being said, we have to come to a solution that will put an end to NK's \nextreme tortures. War has proven in the last decade that it feeds the \ncorporations, and that's bad internationally as corporations can buy their \nway out of limitations. That's last on my list of solutions, if a solution \nI'll ever take. For the moment, I'd have to agree that pressure needs to be \nput on those who can put pressure on NK. Granted, it might make us lose \nties with particular groups and suffer some losses in trade, but in another \nlong written discussion I could go on to support how those losses are \nnecessary for ethics. Our nation is always priding itself on being the most \npowerful and calling itself \"the hero nation,\" and heroes make sacrifices \nthat are immediate, consciously known, and likely to make them enemies. Our \nnation accepts the pride and the power, and rejects many of the duties that \ncome with it (accept when considering War, since War for some reason is \nalways the first to come into the list of options and is supported by \ncorporations that brainwash citizens). Enabling these countries to let NK \ntorment its people is not following the code of honor and duty that America \nis supposed to uphold.\n\n\"I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to \nsucceed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with \nanybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part \nwith him when he goes wrong.\"--Abraham Lincoln",

We have to pick our battles.\n\nTo decide that you will focus on animal rights and value animal life over \nhuman life is your choice. However, you are also depending on others to \nvalue your own life over animal life every time you enjoy that luxury. How? \nEvery time you eat you are consuming food which is of higher quality than \nthe food fed to livestock. You are eating from the highest quality land, \nwhich was taken away from grazing animals and hunting animals. You are \nliving in an area which was probably populated by wild life of some sort \nbefore humans converted it. Just by living you necessarily put your own \nneeds ahead of animals'. Your rights were put ahead of animals' rights at \nnearly every turn. And yet you have the temerity to stand up and demand \nthat others' rights be ignored because of the idealism fostered by the \nlifestyle given to you. \n\nThe people in those camps have to eat corn and cabbage gruel. They \nsupplement their diets with rats, bugs, snakes and lizards. Are you going \nto be more upset about the animals they manage to poach? Seriously, if you \nare as committed as you claim to be, you should be. Those animals all have \nfeelings. The prisoners are obviously not valuing their right to live. \nThey're being selfish, aren't they? Or is it that they don't have the \nluxury to pass up a food source? I want you to think very deeply about \nthis. They don't have the luxury to make the same decision you make every \nday when you eat your quinoa. \n\nThose who are starving don't have to worry about heart disease like we do. \nThey don't have to make a choice between lentils and beef. They have to \ndecide which child eats. So when you come at me, talking about how animals \nfeel, I'm going to come back at you with how a mother feels when she has to \ndecide which child will live.

This misery is actually the consequence of first world consumer \ndemand. Yes, you're complicit, too. You're using technology to type this \nstuff up. That's almost always a product of slave labor. Almost all of our \nclothes were made by slaves. Unless you're buying second hand you're buying \ninto these markets. There are more slaves now than ever before. And you \nare't bothered. You probably even consume slave-created products. The \nslaves of the world have created a utopia for you. And you stand up on \ntheir backs to say to hell with human suffering. Animals first. This is the \nheight of hubris. Your'e like a spoiled crown prince who wants to hand feed \nhis horses while the people starve. \n\nThat's why I dismiss you with \"first world problems.\" What you're saying, \nunwittingly, is let them eat cake.

Yugoslavia, Vietnam, The original Korean War, a bunch of little \ninterventions throughout the 80's, the Somalia Intervention in the 90's. \nYou can say the US had something to gain when they intervened in all of \nthese places, and that's true. Just like every nation on earth, the US \nplaces it's own interests first. However, the US does have a lot to gain by \ntoppling the North and reuniting the peninsula. \n\nThe one glaring benefit would be China losing it's only satellite \nstate(China knows this and it's why they are willing to invest so much in \nthe regime). A reunion of Korea under Southern leadership would be a huge \nboon to US interests in the region. China would completely surrounded by US \nallies(Japan, Taiwan, the new United Korea et cetera), thus blocking any \nfuture attempts by China to assert itself. The reasons the US can't \nintervene are obvious.\n\nChina has a seat on the UN Security counsel, and thus will veto any attempt \nto overthrow the regime. Plus, even though the North Korean Military is a \njoke, They still have artillery loaded with nuclear shells aimed at \nSeoul(the South Korean Capital). Any attack will result in Seoul being \nnuked. \n\nInvasion is currently impossible, even if we get China to support such a \nmove. Internal revolution isn't likely. The biggest thing we can hope for \nis to stop China from sending aid to North Korea(it's largely the reason \nthe regime is still able to function).\n\nEven a covert operation to take out the \"dear leader\" would likely result \nin nuclear weapons being used on somebody. It's an impossible situation. \ufeff",

And the fact is that the major obstacle to green \nenergy is the current conflict of interest that divides the people from the \npolitician's masters -- the energy companies. There already exists \ntechnology that completely solves some of the long-distance travel in a way \nthat doesn't consume any resources whatsoever -- magnetic trains. There's \none in use in Japan already, and it's both the fastest train in the world \nas well as the most green one. The problem is that in the current economy, \nstuff like that are insanely expensive to produce and put into practice. \n\nWe also have the opportunity to use solar energy to a degree which it's not \ntoday, which is a ridiculous waste. For example, many homes could become \nself-sufficient in energy by the use of well-designed and well-placed solar \npanels. There's even a case of a man in the US building solar panels \nhimself from aluminum cans -- old soda cans -- painted with a certain kind \nof paint, and the energy he harvests from this device is enough to \ncompletely fuel his entire home. \n\nNot only is this less of a Gehenna to the planet, it is also cheaper \nlong-term for both our society as well as our individuals. The cost \nbarriers at the moment is in the Research and Development. For example, \nmagnet trains could probably be streamlined into a cost-efficient stage \nwithin the next 30 years to the point where it could be affordable to a \nwider degree than it currently is -- but this is extremely unlikely without \nproper funding from both private investors as well as government, because \nboth the research and the technology is insanely expensive right now -- \njust like all technology is at its genesis. \n\nThere are solutions to the problem of finite resources in certain areas, \nthe problem is that the market economy and its profit-based tunnel vision \ndiscourages sustainable -- i.e profitless -- energy and investments into \nit.

                    "text": "+godonlyknows13 It's gotten a bad rep by the same forces that have stolen \nthe word \"libertarianism\". Historically, Libertarian Socialism is the \nantithesis to the authoritarian capitalist and the neoliberal society. But \nmaintaining the status quo of having clear and well-defined structures of \npower and class divides, is paramount for both politicians and the rich to \nstay in control of society. In an anarchist society, there is no place for \nrisk capitalists. Workers have no reason to sell their labour, in contrast \nto owning their own work.\n\nThis is incompatible with how society is currently run, especially with the \ncurrent idea of democracy. American Democracy is the biggest lie in \ncontemporary political discourse. America has no democracy, it's an \noligarchy. The Republicans and the Democrats are essentially two factions \nof the same political party, and have the same financiers and masters. \nThird party candidates have no chance of winning the presidential election, \nor become representatives with actual power. Propaganda that steers public \nperception away from there being any alternatives to how society is run is \nparamount for this status quo to continue.\n\nThis is also why the CIA has toppled or attempted to topple many South \nAmerican democracies with leftist economic policies and social safety nets. \nThis is also why they've tried to assassinate Fidel Castro more times than \nI can count. Propaganda and force makes people think there's no alternative \nto how society is run -- but the problem with the status quo is that it \ndemands infinite growth on a finite planet to work economically. But the \nfact is that the liberal psuedodemocratic consumerist society cannot \nsurvive long-term. \n\nThe entire global economy is based entirely around the debt of countries \nwhere private banks and other profit giants reap the benefits. This is \ncompletely self-destructive for everyone in the long-term. The fact is that \nthe US has dug itself into a hole that is so big that if the US publicly \nexpress explicitly that they are never going to repay their debts, then the \nentire global economy would collapse instantaneously. In other words, the \nexact same thing that happened to Greece would happen to every first world \n(and most second world) countries on the planet. On the other hand, it \nwould sky rocket the growth of the third world, because the biggest \nobstacle to third world autonomy is western corporations for example forces \nfarmers to sell their production to the west, by making sure that the \nlocals can't afford to compete with their prices. This is also based around \nthe debt economy, where the farmers essentially end up in a position where \nthe only way they can continue to produce food is if they sell a fixed \namount of the produce before even planting it. \n\nWith this long-ish analysis, I think it should be self-evident why the \nestablished powers have shifted public perception into thinking things like \nanarchy, or a democracy without representatives overall, is chaos and \ndisorder. It's also the biggest evidence of the representative politicians \nnot working for the people, because of the conflict of interest whereby \nwhat's best for the workers is mutually exclusive with what's best for the \npoliticians and their financiers.
