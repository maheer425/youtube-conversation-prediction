If Simon and Martina ask what our opinions are then I will \ngive my two cents on what I think, in a positive manner. What you are doing \nis unnecessary. I can honestly say you are 100% wrong, there are plenty of \npeople who adore Jrock idols, just because you don't care for them doesn't \nmean you can speak for those who haven't mentioned them. On another point \nSimon and Martina have gone to Japan and have said they do enjoy Japanese \nmusic there for they would love to hear from my point of view. So do not \nseat there and say what I had to say was pointless, your negativity in my \ncomment is pointless and you should stop while you're a head and leave \nother people and their dreams alone.

Perhaps I just felt like \"Asian fans are so stupid\" was too \nmuch of a blanket statement.\nI only wanted to point out that there might be an underlying cause to it, \nthat Korean culture doesn't seem to care. Like it's the norm to have \nclearly mental teenage girls who need help because obsession is a very \nunhealthy behavior. Instead the industry just demands they take it with \ngrace and poise and they're fired if they don't. I think one other \ncontributing factor is the sheer amount of incredibly famous idols that \nexist. Justin Beiber is popular the world over and there's only about what, \n7 other really famous boy bands like that? Where as Kpop has far more, \nthere is more to focus and hone in on, not to mention many of them aren't \neven known outside of Korea. Basically, the asian specifically female fans \nare terrible more because of culture and the way kpop is handled, as \nopposed to simply being Asian, since Asian includes all other Asians, not \njust Koreans. I don't know if Japan, China, Vietnam and others have issues \nlike this with their idols.\n\nFor the record, I think a lot of closed off countries, like SK get a kind \nof attitude that foreigners are stupid unfortunately :( Not all of them of \ncourse, but clearly a large amount with in the kpop fandom.\nWe hate or fear what we're not apart of and don't understand.

This is based off of my experiences and \nwhat I have seen. When that one guy who's name I've forgotten from Suju got \nmarried, the fans who were giving them hate mail were like 75% Asian. Yeah \nit's negative, but is it really racist? It's an assumption that has \nsomething to do with race, just because it's negative and involves race \ndoesn't mean it's racist. (BTW I hope I'm not sounding like a jerk or \nanything. I'm being sincere here and as a middle eastern Muslim I've felt \nracism directed towards me) In fact some Korean english speakers translated \nsome of the comments. I saw comments of people saying racist things towards \ninternational fans because most of the I ternation fans still supported him \nand they said stuff like \"They're too dumb to know what we're saying \nanyways\" there was also a fair amount of hate direction towards Saudi \nArabian ELFS I think? Don't know where that came from... but I think it \nwould be fair to say that most saesengs and other haters are Asian.

I mean, even now, when \nI'm writing this, I feel a really weird sense of... Idk, betrayal? Or that \nfeeling when you've been rejected after you finally plucked up the courage \nto say \"IREALLYLIKEYOUPLEASEDATEME\" to someone. Like, WTH.\n\nThank God I'm not a crazy fan, because even this comparatively mild \nhappenstance took a surprising amount of willpower to control.\n\nI mean, I KNOW I have never met the guy, that he most definitely does not \nknow I exist, and unless I somehow become the girl he's marrying, a \nrelationship just will not happen. Rational Me almost always loses to \nFangirl Me though, before RM wrestles FM back into her cage.\n\nIdk, if I had to give a reason at all, I'd say it's because of the length \nof time I've been a fan of Sweet Sorrow (and particularly JinHwan), how \nendearing I find him, and something else I can't explain at all. I just \ngrew very attached to this guy who, effectively, was just a face on my \ncomputer screen most of the time.\n\nDefinitely not a rational reaction, but very much an emotional one.

They made it clear that they, \nthemselves, wouldn't want to be a k-pop idol, but understand why Koreans \nwould want to stay, but does that mean they can't speak the truth? They've \nbeen backstage and have experienced more than we have as fans, so I think \nthey have the privilege to speak the truth. Especially when the truth isn't \nseen as much as the facade that we see idols portraying. I love K-pop just \nas much as you do, but I hate the fact that they work so hard and the way I \nsee it, they get punished for doing great, and when they do horrible, it's \nten times worse. Their only reward is making a great song/album that \neveryone loves, or topping the charts. And to some people, that just isn't \nenough as the years pass by. Idols need nutrition and love not just from \nthe fans, but from their companies and the people they are mostly around.",

Who do I \nkeep doing this for\u2026.? I put up with it as long as I could, and I have \nsomething called opinions too.\" His company didn't sweep it under the rug, \nat least, which is rare.

I, too, suffer with the same problems \nand relate to Lee Joon a whooole lot. I can totally understand how he \nfeels. I see a lot of myself in him, tot he point it's scary LOL. I do feel \nbad, because I know he's very passionate about acting, but even actors can \nhave hectic schedules, I'm sure. I mean, you can sometimes just look at \nJoon and tell if he's well or not. For me, it's easy to see.\nOne thing I can say, from my personal experience with bipolar disorder, it \nis very hard for me to be happy, even when things go well for me. Like now, \nI have a good career opportunity, but I'm passionate about singing and \nmusic. I can be making a lot of money, but I'll be miserable, though I am \ndoing something else I enjoy. Bipolar disorder is something hard to control \nand random for me. As Joon says, he feels bad for those who put up with his \nmood swings. I totally understand, as when I hit my lows, I can say awful \nthings and I really worry people with my actions and words. It's a very \nscary thing.\nAll in all, bipolar disorder is one hell of a mental illness. I really feel \nfor Joon. The members of MBLAQ seem to get along well and he seems to be \nvery close to Seungho and trust him enough. So, as far as I know, at least \nhe has a good friend in Seungho. I mean, Joon even said he felt closest to \nSeungho (In that double talk interview if I'm not mistaken?) and he felt \njealous of the others sometimes. I can relate to that as well, being \njealous and maybe a bit possessive.\nWow, this was longer than I thought haha. OTL Anyways, I do wish the best \nfor him.",
