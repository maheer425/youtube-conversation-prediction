                "text": "People associate colors with more than just color though.  For example: \n Red is usually considered an angry color, Pink a girl color.  We \nunderstand brighter and darker colors.  \n\nOf course, there are our own individual relationships that we develop that \nwe assign color to.  We also understand the relationship between color and \nphysical forces like wavelengths.  Sure, someone else's red might be \nanother person's green or blue, but since the relationships with color are \nclose to identical with few individual differences, the question is \nmeaningless.  Our brains develop very close to the same way, so it's not a \nridiculous assumption to say that red to me looks the same as it does to \nyou if the part of the brain that recognized color got swapped with yours.\ufeff",

They represent associations with \neach other, brightness intensity, and specific events.  The only thing the \nexplanatory gap fails to cover is the brain's exact interpretation of a \ncolor.  As I said, it's possible in theory that my red is someone else's \ngreen, but considering the ratio of our rods and cones, it's just very \ndifficult to justify it looking any different to any other person.",

I think it depends on what \nyou're talking about. Like, go outside at night, it's pitch black meaning \ndark meaning absence of color.

And there is no intrinsic \ncolour to a neuronal firing pattern. (Or is there?)\n\nThis of course relates directly to the \"Hard Problem\" of consciousness, \nwhich is concerned with how physical mechanisms in the brain can produce \nsubjective conscious experiences and qualia like the colour \"Red\". \n\n*Question*\nBut what I'm pondering here is whether you could ever assess the relative \nsubjective qualia between two people? Not that by looking at someone or \ntheir brain you could ever *know what it is **like* to be them, but simply \ngain insight into whether their subjective experience might be similar to \nyour own. \n\n*Experiment*\nIt is well known that if you show someone a pattern in their visual field, \ne.g. a black star on white background, and scan their brains while they are \nviewing it (~fMRI) you will see a star-like pattern of brain activity \noccurring in their visual cortex. The physical object / pattern being \nviewed is represented as or is mapped onto a corresponding pattern of \nneuronal activity.\n\nMy question concerns taking this experimental data from scans of many \npeople, to see if you can see difference in the pattern of neuronal \nactivity for different brains viewing the same physical object or pattern. \nDo they all map cleanly and distinctly, in the sense of physical star \npatterns always forming star patterns of neuronal activity? Are some \npeople's resulting neuronal star patterns more intense than others?\n\nCould you extend this to physical scenes that hold not star patterns but an \nentire visual field composed of bright red light (from a screen for \nexample) to determine what parts of the brain light up in different people \nin response to red light? Blue light? Green light? \n\nAnd could you compare the brain activity in each person that occurred when \nexposed to bright red, dull red, different intensities of red? \n\n*Assess*\nFinally, with a large data set comprised of brain activity from different \npeople exposed to different physical stimulus (concentrating on colour to \nkeep it simple) at different intensity . . . could you not assess whether \npeople appeared to be experiencing the same subjective qualia as one \nanother?\n\n*Imply* that their \"Red\" was the same as your \"Red\"? \n\nSomething along the lines of:\nThese regions in different people correspond to red, those for blue, and \nthese other for green. This is the activity that occurs for more intense \nstimulus, that for less intense. Aha it seems that in this population of \npeople this red screen induced an \"intense red\" activity pattern but in the \nother group of people it induced only a \"standard red\" activity pattern and \nin this small subset it actually induced a \"blue\" activity pattern while \nthis weird outlier dude had his auditory cortex light up in E-major. etc \netc. \n\nCould you ever know? \nCould you ever gain a degree of confidence that this was so? \ufeff",

                    "text": "I am going to sidestep the debate about whether my red is the same as your \nred. This question doesn't interest me as much because if you look at it \nfrom a functional perspective, it doesn't matter that your red isn't the \nsame color as my red. What matters is whether there are differences between \nthe subconscious connections you make with the color I perceive as red and \nthe connections I make.\n\nPersonally I don't think we'll ever know exactly how others experience \nanything subjectively. We might be able to get very close but to truly \nunderstand how someone else sees red you would have to become him.\n\nThe majority of people on this planet are conditioned to connect red with \nlove because centuries ago we made the heart, which is actually greyish but \njust happens to look red because of the blood being pumped through it, a \nsymbol of love. Most likely because we noticed hearts beat faster when the \nowner is aroused?\n\nRed is danger, if your body is losing a lot of red, you are in serious \ntrouble. Red is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances human \nmetabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has \nvery high visibility, which is why stop signs, stoplights, and fire \nequipment are usually painted red.\n\nThe majority of people also connects red with warmth. Perhaps a leftover \nfrom the time we discovered fire and gathered around campfires? fire, \nyellow/orange/red = hot. Blue is actually even hotter and more energetic \nbut by the time we discovered how to make fires this hot, red had already \nstarted representing warmth? something hot is also dangerous so there is \nnice overlap there. \n\nRed is the color of fire and blood, it is associated with energy, war, \ndanger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and \nlove. This is the kind of stuff we can semi-objectively agree on (within \ncultures). \n\nSo that's the stuff we can agree on, still I think there is a lot of \nindividual coloring going on (pun intended ;)) If you happen to have had \nbad experiences with red (red objects, people wearing red, ...) this might \nhave an effect on how you see the color. Perhaps a particular kind of red \nreminds me of my grandfather who died wearing his red suit which in turn \ncreates feelings of loss and nostalgia. How would I find out what you feel \nwhen seeing red?\n\nIf I run an instance of your mind experiencing red as a subset of my own, I \nhave to make sure that they run completely separate from each other in \norder to not corrupt the data with my own experiences of red. In fact, to \ntruly experience how you see red, I(you) wouldn't be allowed to know you \nare a simulation. I would have turn off myself completely and only be you \nand you are not allowed to realize you are not really you so that means \nprior to setup I would have to hack visual cues, create a digital avatar \nthat matches the simulation's expectations, engineer a past to create the \nillusion of continuous experience, ... lots of work. :p\n\nBut now the real problem, if I have to keep your experience and \ninterpretations separate from myself then how can *I* ever experience \nsomeone else as myself? Whether you experience the simulation in real time, \nrender it virtually from stored brain patterns, you have direct access to \nsomeone else's memory, ... any situation you can come up with, the second \nyou bring in your own point of view, the experience becomes less pure, \ntainted with your own views.\n\nNot to mention that all this sounds rather dangerous because once I am you, \nhow would I remember I am not really you? Prior to setup you could set up a \nkill time for the simulation but still... being someone else could be one \nhell of a drug. Perhaps you would fall in love with your own view of \nsomeone else's memories? Why would I want to be my old self again if I \nreally like my romanticized and idealized version of what it's like being \nyou? What if not being allowed to be you I become depressed about being me? \nWhat if you can't stop me? Now that I sort of know how you tick, I don't \nneed you anymore. :p \n\n/far out there ;)",

For \nexample we know that there are gender differences in perception of colour; \nmales and females are typically slightly more sensitive to different parts \nof the colour spectrum. Additionally we know that women tend of respond \ndifferently to men who are wearing (or visually accompanied by) the colour \nred, but not vice versa.\n\nThis last example hints at what I think is the real problem with qualia \nwhich is that conscious experience, both at the seemingly irreducible \nsubjective level, and at the neurological level, is incredibly complex. How \ndo you know that your own mental representation of red is that same from \none moment to the next, you've got nothing to compare it to (since \nrecalling it and seeing is are essentially the same thing at this level). \nDo you see red the same when you're anxious and so primed to respond to it \nmore emotionally, isn't the emotional response part of the experience of \nthe colour? Aren't all your personal learned associations of a colour part \nof your experience of that colour. This would suggest that in the same way \nthat you can expect a fair amount of consistency between \nour primitive experiences from one moment to the next, we can expect a \nsimilar degree of consistency between one human and the next (given that \nour brains are fundamentally pretty similar). However you can not expect \nany two experiences of anything to be identical, due to the highly personal \nnature of the formation of every experience as a whole and \nthe inseparability of each element of an experience, or in other words, due \nto the chaotic nature of the systems that bring about consciousness.",

The colorimetry \ntristimulus values x, y, z are the international standards for defining \ncolor (e.g., the common CIE1931).\n\n\"so if 255,0,0 is RGB Combination of red color which I perceive, it is \npossible that you perceive it  255,1,1 or 255,2,1 or 255,1,3 but it is \nimpossible to see it as 0,255,0 (which stands for green) as it is a very \nhuge difference.\"\n\n255,0,0 isn't a color.  Oh, it's called a color in computer science, but \nonly because we work with RGB devices and normally can only specify to that \nlevel--but in more precise terms, if you render 255,0,0 on your \nmonitor--and I render 255,0,0 on mine; then there's not only no *guarantee* \nour monitors rendered the same color, but it's *unlikely* in practice that \nthey did.\n\nSpeaking of human perception in terms of RGB is even worse.  Human vision \nsimply doesn't work that way.  Our cones--which are *not* RGB devices--are \nsensitive to an entire spectra of light.  But our brain never gets the pure \nsignals from the cones--before it even travels down the optic nerve it's \nmixed into three different color channels by ganglia; the red/green \nchannel, the yellow/blue channel, and the lightness/darkness channel.  The \nlatter is special in that it can be perceived mixed; the former two \nnominally cannot.  However, under certain extremely controlled unnatural \nconditions, subjects can be made to see what are called \"Martian Colors\" \nlike reddish-green.\n\nSo, I have two very technical and scientifically supported reasons to say \nthat what you're saying is gibberish: (1) RGB isn't a standard, (2) even if \nit were standardized, it's irrelevant to perception.  Instead, I offer that \nyou need to research color theory and human vision quite a bit more before \nconfusing what you think you know with science.",

                    "text": "+Funnysterste Actually, it's 100% correct. We all share a basic genetic \nblueprint, true, that's what defines us a species. For instance, most \npeople have two eyes, one nose, and one mouth, and they are generally \narranged in that order descending the face. Some people have green eyes, \nsome people have blue eyes, and some people have brown eyes. Now, even \nthough all these people have two eyes, obviously something is different in \ntheir respective genetic compositions to alter the pigmentation of their \niris. Hence, biodiversity.\nTo address your original comment, I believe you may be misunderstanding the \nquestion that is being asked in the video title. It's a question about the \ninternal workings of your mind, or your internal perception. If a group of \npeople were to observe a light bulb covered in a transparent red film in an \notherwise dark room, every single one of them would have light entering \ntheir eye with an identical wavelength. They would, because their genetic \nmake up is similar, all be observing light with a wavelength of \napproximately 650nm. What the real thought provoking question is here is \nwould all of them perceive it the same way, internally? What's to say that \nthe color my brain has assigned to red isn't the color your brain has \nassigned to blue? That is to say, even though we are seeing the same \nwavelengths, the same light, our brains may have assigned different mental \nshadings to accompany it.\nOf course now we run into the problem of qualia, and if you can't grasp the \nconcept from the video itself I doubt I have the linguistic talent to open \nyour eyes to it (pun intended). I hope, though, that this may have helped \nto explain it.",

When we \ndescribe an object as red we're basically saying that the object reflects \nlight of a certain wavelength, specifically, light at the red end of the \nspectrum i.e. around 400nm. As long as we all agree that objects that \nreflect that wavelength of light are to be called \"red\", we can \nsuccessfully communicate. However, since language can't communicate private \nsubjective experience, but rather, only information about the external \nworld, we can never know what its like to experience the world from the \nperspective of someone else. In other words you can't experience the same \nexact thing as I'm experiencing because we're two different people, and you \ncan't communicate the nature of your experiences because they're part of \nyour own internal experience and not the external reality that we can all \nperceive.",

If we see our red...our red \ncomes up on the monitor. Of course, that red could be green to others, or \nblue, or yellow, etc. I think this would be the closest possible way of \nfinding out if we all see the same colours, or not, and if not, how \ndifferent they can be.\n\nFor one, I understand how TommyEdison feels trying to learn what a colour \nis, or how it looks. I understand the concept of seeing different reds to \nsomeone else, but I can't wrap my head around the fact that there's a \npossibility that when someone looks at me, they see me as light green or \nblue instead of a light tan. I understand that I could look like that to \nthem. I think the whole idea I can't wrap my head around is the fact that \nif I looked at someone and saw green or blue, I would probably freak out. \nAnd I would probably react the same way if a device could transmit to a \nmonitor what colour someone saw, and I saw something different to what I \nsaw. Could you imagine having green or blue skin? Could you imagine looking \nat fire and seeing purple? Or looking at the sky and seeing red?

It's like how some people \nsee better in the dark. What I mean is the change in color may happen \nfaster for some people. Imagine yourself holding a hard plastic tube full \nof water, with a bubble of air in the center. Like this: /---( )---/ if you \ntip it slightly, the bubble will rise. The more you tip it, and the steeper \nthe angle, the faster the bubble moves. What if for some people, the tube \ntilts at a steeper angle quicker? The bubble being how light or dark the \ncolor is. The people that have their tubes Tilt slower would see many \nshades of reddish colors as just red, where the people that have their \ntubes at the steeper angle that see the many reddish colors as dark red, \nlight red, and pink. For example, there is a simulated test where on a \nscreen a dark red color is getting lighter. Some people may think it starts \nto look pink quicker than others.

                "text": "This video (mostly in the first 3 minutes) explains the concept of qualia, \nor subjective experiences which we do not, and cannot truly share with any \nother person.  \n\nWhen two people see light at the wavelength 650, they experience a color \nwhich they have both been trained to label \"red\".  Assuming neither person \nis colorblind, they can communicate about the color red, because the two \ndistinct experiences are caused by the same stimuli.  An example of failed \ncommunication is the Japanese perception of the \"go\" street light as being \n\"blue\" not \"green\".  The color of their streetlights are \nnot noticeably different from our own, but they have labelled it \ndifferently, and so we fail to communicate when faced with the same stimuli.\n\nThis led me to a thought experiment.  Assume an alien species with \"perfect \ntelepathy\" approaches earth and attempts to communicate from deep space \nwith a human in a mutual first contact scenario.  The two beings are not \ninteracting in any physical measurable way, but can only transmit and \nreceive \"signals\" to the mind.  The alien will be incapable of describing \nthings as simple as shapes, let alone abstract concepts.  Each entity has \nconstructed a model of a \"square\" in their mind and labelled it, and each \nmight project their model into the other's mind.  However, without an \naccompanying reference in visual or tactile form, neither model will have \nany meaning to the other.\n\nTake this a step further and consider a \"superhuman\" telepath.  Matt \nParkman from heroes could \"hear\" words in his target's mind.  However, \napplying the above limitations, he would not hear words but rather a jumble \nof mental models.  That's not to say that it would be impossible for Matt \nto read minds, but he would have to use some parallel stimuli to make the \ncorrect mappings.  He could learn his target's mental models by \ntelepathically perceiving while listening as they spoke words out loud. \n However, each new person who he tried to read would have entirely \ndifferent models.\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that generalized telepathy in the \ntraditional sense is impossible.  Each mind speaks its own language.  One \nneed not develop the \"mental shielding\" of sci fi and fantasy, and only \nthose nearest to you could hope to natively understand your mind after \nyears of exposure.  On the other hand, telepathy in a technological sense \nmay be only a few decades away, but it will consist of training your brain \nwith a neural interface to use a common language, or a \"network protocol\".\ufeff",

My main sticking point is that \n\"instant access\" (i.e. \"magic\") telepathy implies an unknown and generally \nunexplained method of perceiving thoughts.  This may or may not presuppose \nunderstanding of a lower level \"language\" from which thoughts are \nconstructed.  It is entirely possible that this telepathy could manifest, \nnot as understanding abstract thoughts of the target, but as experiencing \nthe raw qualia of the target.\n\nAlternatively, it could manifest as a translation layer.  Perhaps when I am \nthinking \"red\" and a telepath examines my thoughts, he gets his own \ninternal experience of \"red,\" without really delving into my subjective \nexperience.  Essentially, this version of telepathy would be equivalent to \nspeech.  Talking with your brain, if you will.\n\nOn the other hand, if it is a more mechanical process that essentially \nconsists of reading electrical brain activity and converting that into \nuseful information, I generally agree with you.  Certain general \ninformation (\"this dude is real angry,\" \"this lady is getting intense \nvisual stimulation\") would be immediately obvious because it is expressed \ncommonly in all humans, but more specific information would require some \ncalibration.",

You as an engineer can examine the current \nstate of the memory, and you can examine the logic circuitry connecting to \nthe memory.  You can even perceive the changes in memory enacted by the \nlogic.  I contend that there is no way of understanding anything that is in \nmemory given these constraints.\n\nHowever, once you can connect the input and output devices, and watch how \nthe logic and memory circuits interact with input and output, you can begin \nto interpret the results in memory, and the process will be even faster if \nyou are permitted to provide specific test data to the computer. \n Unfortunately the next \"unkown computer\" would not necessarily have any \ncompatibility and the learning process would begin anew.\n\nSimilarly your example of \"thinking in English\" would remain meaningless to \nthe telepathic observer *until* you spoke or typed those words.  At that \npoint, the telepath could begin to connect your words to the \"word forming \nmodel\" in your brain.  Interestingly they would have to examine a great \nnumber of examples to pry apart the word forming mental process from the \nidea forming process which precedes it in the sentence speaking exercise.\n\nTo your final point, I haven't ruled out telepathy at all.  What I have \nruled out is the traditional \"instant access\" form of telepathy that \nappears in most scifi and fantasy.  In fact, I argue that telepathy is not \nonly possible but inevitable using technological means.  What my argument \nshows, though, is that the theoretical \"psychic telepathy\" must follow the \nsame rules as a not-so-distantly-theoretical \"wifi telepathy\".  We must \neither learn each individual's internal language, or we must agree upon \ncommon telepathic languages.  So if the telepath wished to do so they \ncertainly *could* learn to perceive blue in the same way, but it would take \na great deal of time spent studying a person's thought.",

Our own ability to mimic or \nunderstand doesnt exactly equate to a loss of potential. Even now, there \nare procedures in use and in development that can alter how a person \nperceives. Using these methods, you can mimic the same perceptual outcomes \nof others to experience the world as they do. \n\nYou can see in rudimentary practice by \"subjectively\" experiencing \nsomething. If I tell you about snow, and explain all about it to you, but \nyou never see it or experience it yourself, we can count it among the gap \nportrayed here. However, if I put a snowball in your hand, your \nunderstanding increasing drastically.\n\nThe basic idea is that this video puts all the emphasis on verbal \ncommunication, but forgets about visual, auditory, and other sensory \nmethods of communication.

I can \ndescribe the smell of an orange, but until you smell it you will not truly \nknow it. I can describe the feeling of cold, but until you put your hand in \nsomething cold you will know it, and so forth. \n\nThe difference in perception described here, where my red is not \nnecessarily your red, is also measurable, even by today's methods. I can \nsee how viewing a red strawberry will impact your mind and senses, what \nrods and cones are activated, etc, and see whether, for starters, the \nimpact on your senses if the same as on mine. \n\nbut you make object in saying that even if the physical results are the \nsame, there may still be an underlying difference that is undetectable. In \nwhich you must then believe in the supernatural. In reality, all things are \nfinite. No matter how numerous the factors at play are, there are still \nfinite numbers of factors at play to determine my perception.

I just thought it was a very interesting question to make \nsince so far I've seen that a lot of people links music almost directly \nwith emotions (at least from what I've read/seen on the internet and on my \nparticular country). For me, the part that many people I know and including \nmyself are interested is whether emotions towards music is a learned \nbehavior or is just part of something deeper...\n\nIn fact, here is just one of the several pages I've found talking about the \nsimilar topic (I haven't read it for a while):\n\nhttp://www.ted.com/conversations/14034/what_is_the_relationship_betwe_4.html\n\nThanks for your point of view. :)",

I wouldn't put music into line with the general \nperceptions such as smelling, feeling, hearing, etc.\nEmotions towards music is a learned behavior and (as I am quite sure about \nthat) 100% depending on the individual's associations to it. This also \nexplains why you have such a wide variety of musical styles and tastes. So \nif you claim that music or a certain melody or even just a note \"blends\", \n\"mixes\" or \"wakes up\", then you're making a claim that's probably not true \nfor the majority of people.\n\nThere is a little sharing ground if you talk about specific musical \ndynamics, such as sudden shifts in pitches, rhythms or volume, but these, I \nwould say, can be largely attributed to the general hearing perception and \nthe eeriness of breaching a pattern that was expected. Humans are quite \nkeen on pattern recognition and any disruption of such. But that goes far \nbeyond the scope of your post. :)",

But you dont \nhave any unique color experiences, if we look at a blue object together, \nsince the goal will be the same, we will both see blue as blue but with \ndifferent codes...and if i sent you my signal for blue by \"blue\"tooth you'd \nsay \"wtf this is red not blue, use the \"red\"tooth.\" Color joke, i know its \nnot funny :) ... but you get the idea?

I've \nwatched five of his videos and it seems like he is trying to give a broad \noverview of the different hypothesis of the hows and whys of a given topic. \nIt can be misleading to some, but to people who are scientifically savvy \nthis is actually a very good overview of other hypotheses, even the invalid \nones. Sometimes it's nice to know how other people think. \n     And on the topic of subjective experience, it is essentially \nimpossible to know without a doubt that what I experience is the same as \nwhat you experience in certain circumstances, and while I haven't given it \nmuch thought, color does seem like a good example. Why doesn't it make \nsense that certain things exist purely in our head? A certain wave-length \nof light does not \"create\" red or green. And dogs do see colors differently \nthan we do, as do cats. The question is do human beings see color \ndifferently from one another. I for one believe for all intents and \npurposes that we do experience the world the same way (except for the rare \nexceptions) as it would seem implausible that we evolved completely \nseparate perceptions of the physical world. \n     And on that topic it is EXTREMELY implausible that an alien race would \n\"feel\" the same way we do. They would very likely feel pain, nausea, \npleasure, but it doesn't change the fact that how they feel those things \ncould be completely different from us. Physical injury could create a \ncompletely different sensation, yet serve the same purpose and elicit the \nsame response as pain. We only experience physical sensation because they \nserve a purpose, there is no law or theory in physics that explains the \nsensation of pain. \n     I honestly don't really understand the materialist/immaterialist \ndebate. I'll admit I honestly don't fully understand either one, mainly \nbecause while I have had debates with people in person, and even more \nonline, I can't for the life of me see where either theory leads \nideologically.

So this is the first result when you Google \n\"immaterial mind\".\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind) \"Varieties of \ndualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material \nbody and vice-versa have come under strenuous attack from different \nquarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often \nasked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally \nmaterial \u2014 this is the basic problem of causal interaction.\"\n\nHere is a video about the immaterial mind..\nThe Mind is Immaterial: Scientific Evidence\n\nAnother result.\nhttp://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/ \"Recall that the immaterial mind or soul \nas substantial form is suppose to act on a properly disposed human body in \norder to result in a full-fledged human being.\"\n\nYou obviously didn't look very hard.. or at all. That is the belief system \nof an immaterial mind. A mind that is apart from the brain/body.. but the \nthing is, they're pretty much just referring to their soul. They don't \nthough, they refer to it as the mind and the brain is simply a tool of \nsorts for the mind/soul. Then they try to argue their personal belief and \nrefer to it as the mind when people who don't believe their mind is anymore \nthan the chemical/electrical/physical brain don't know they're actually \ntalking about their belief in a soul. If you watch the video again and \nreplace the word 'mind' with 'soul', it would pretty much change nothing.\n\nAs for color, you just need to Google \"is color an illusion\" and find all \nsorts of things.. like:\nhttp://www.gmilburn.ca/2009/06/19/color-and-reality/\nA blog that ends basically stating that it's not possible to prove or \ndisprove that color is an illusion.\n\nhttps://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101228200808AAXYY9i\nWhere the majority of people said color is NOT an illusion.\n\nSo no, it has not been widely accepted to the scientific community or any \ncommunity. Science can't prove or disprove that color is just an illusion \ncreated by the mind, so science doesn't really touch it. That's why you \nwill find no scientific, peer reviewed papers that declare color being an \nillusion or not as a fact.\n\nUnless you believe in the soul.. you're being duped by a philosophical \nargument with a spiritual/religious bias towards an immaterial mind, a soul.",

                    "text": "+John Eydelson\nThere is nothing related to playing semantics when I am only referring to \nwhat was said in the video.. Now look, I am going to make a claim. It is a \nfact that our experience of color is NOT an illusion. You can't disprove \nthat.. just as much as I can't disprove the claim that it is an illusion. \nSpeaking of, you're trying to say that whatever our brain creates is an \nillusion.. and that's playing semantics because that's not what an illusion \nis. An illusion is a sensory distortion that shows us how our brain \ninterprets. Notice the distortion part? That distortion comes from the \ntricking of the senses, the illusion. When your brain processes, projects, \npaints, and materializes sensory input is NOT an illusion.. it when your \nbrain does all that and is tricked into doing more. By definition, phantom \nlimb syndrome is an illusion of the brain.. Normal sensory input is not an \nillusion of the brain.\n\nBut, if you want to play with semantics and say that all sensory input is \nan illusion.. then ok. All that our brain perceives is an illusion. That's \nwhat you say, but then you also say that even though that is the case, the \nworld around us exists. That means the apple pie you smell (the \"illusion\") \nexists, the wall that you touch exists, the clouds that you see exists, the \ntea that you are tasting exists, the car horn that you are hearing exists.. \neverything you sense exists.. so color exists. It exists outside your \nbrain, waiting to be processed internally just like everything else. It is \na very real characteristic of reality.\n\nAlso, what the hell is up with the \"chemical miracles\"? How our brain works \nisn't a miracle.. it's a mystery. A miracle is something that cannot be \nexplained by science.. and our mind is not a miracle. It's still a mystery, \nbut we will have it figured out in the future. Might be 100 years from now, \nmaybe more.. but we will learn it's secrets. To believe that the mind is \noutside the grasp of science (a miracle) is believing in an immaterial mind \nthat akin to a soul.\n\n+Jack Stuart \"He's talking about how my translation of sensory data into \nwhat \"red\" means to me is probably different from yours and everyone elses.\"\n\nNotice how you said probably? He never fucking said probably.. he said it \nis a fact. That is a flat out lie.. and that is what propaganda is! Fucking \nlies. If you want to try and say that it is a fact that color is an \nillusion, then provide me some scientific references backing up your claim.\n\nAnd there is actually a big difference in how people see the mind/brain. \nThere are people, like me, who don't believe the mind is anymore than the \ninternal physical processes of the brain. You could call it a material \nmind..\n\nThen, there are people who believe in an immaterial mind that is apart from \nthe brain. An immaterial mind is basically that same concept as a soul.. \nand that is what this video is biased towards. If you can't see that, then \nyou're keeping yourself blind. The only problem is, when someone believes \nin an immaterial mind and gets into a discussion about the mind, they're \ntypically referring to their personal believe in the immaterial mind while \nother people just think they're talking about the mind as in the brain. So \nbasically this dude is giving a philosophical argument for his personal \nbelief in an immaterial mind while people like you are getting duped and \nthinking his is talking about the mind as in the brain.",

So in terms \nof the light spectrum, I think violet feels like it's as high a frequency \nas you can go while still being visible, and is usually brighter and \nlightly colored. And purple is the darker hue, and makes me think of what \nroyalty would wear long ago, those deeply hued fabrics. But, even though \nviolet is as far as you can go on the spectrum, I think it is actually \npurple that has the bit of red in it.\n\nIn other words, violet feel like it is its own color, at the very end of \nthe light spectrum, while purple is just dark blue mixed with red.\n\nHey! You said that in Russia, you consider light blue and dark blue to be \ndifferent colors, right? But if you mix blue and red, you get purple. So, \nin Russia, if you mix (light blue + red) vs. (dark blue + red), do you get \ntwo different colors, or do they both make purple?",

I'm studying \nlinguistics and I've always been curious about the differences in ability \nof differentiating between colours depending on the native language.\n\nFor example, in my native language, Russian, there are two common words for \nthe colour blue: \"\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439\" (light-blue) and \"\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439\" (dark-blue). So every \ntime I see something like \"It's blue\", I always have trouble picturing it, \nbecause just \"blue\" is too vague for me. It's the same with Italian and \nMongolian.\n\nIn reverse, there are \"purple\" and \"violet\" for Russian one and only \n\"\u0444\u0438\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439\". And up to this day I've never managed to find out the exact \ndifference between them.\n\nEnglish language has \"ginger\" and \"redhead\" to describe someone's hair, in \nRussian there's only \"\u0440\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0439\"\n\nSome of languages, for example, Vietnamese, Ancient Egyptian, do not \ndifferentiate between blue and green. There's even a linguistic term for it \n- \"grue\". As a result, the sky and grass are considered the same colour for \nthem.\n\nChinese, Japanese and Korean have some really unclear concepts about the \ndifference between green and blue and for that, the very definition of \n\"green\" and \"blue\" is pretty vague and you can see blue light on the \ntraffic light.\n\nFinnish has a separate colour between green and blue, something like teal.\n\nIn Chinese, red and pink are not separate colours but different shades.\n\nEtc, etc.",

In fact, my opinion is \nthat if you don't ask people whether the dress is white & gold or blue & \nblack, but just ask them what color it is, they'll say it's white & gold, \nand won't try seeing blue & black. Also, I think it was just a clever \nmarketing idea by the company which makes these dresses. They made one in \nwhite & gold, photographed it & then started this campaign, saying that the \ngirl who took the picture KNOWS the dress is blue & black, but it appears \ndifferent to other people. Once there's certain mindset, people can't see \npast that.

The term \"qualia\", for me, simply \nevokes that particular conscious experience rather than the underlying \nneural processing itself - I certainly don't hold any weight for this \nexperience being non-physical in any way; you can't have conscious \nexperience / qualia without neural processing. \n\nEvery non-physical proposal that I've seen has been inherently \nnon-falsifiable and thus not really worthy of serious consideration. \n\nI also think that our technium is on track to engineer both artificial and \nbiological neural circuits that produce conscious experiences, and later to \ngain mastery and produce novel conscious experiences. I do wonder if we'll \nbe able to engineer novel colours, etc on either side of the conventional \nspectrum. And beyond the standard sensory modalities that we are currently \nhardwired for, states of consciousness that are physically impossible for \nus to presently imagine. ",

When Mary escapes the room and actually \nexperiences color (instead of just having the book smarts knowledge \nconcerning wavelength of light etc.), there isn't anything magical about \nthat... and we would expect to find Mary's brain adjusted accordingly. (now \nhaving the experience of color)\n\nMy opinion is that soon enough we will reverse engineer consciousness and \nactually be able to transmit experience directly. So, with the case of Mary \nand her Colorless Room, we will be able to give her knowledge of all the \nquantifiable (via language and mathematics) aspects of Color, and then also \nadditionally transmit the experience of Color to her consciousness as well.",

Well, I can tell you with all \ncertainty that when a red corvette drives by and we both know it is a red \ncorvette. Color is bending of light and wave length, and like a cat, will \nnot cater to your perception. It just bends indiscriminately, and says,\" \nhey, look what I can do. do you see me?\" So, if this were true, then we all \nwould have flunked kindergarten. Perception is still that. However, if an \nAmerican 100 dollar bill was dangled in front of all the 7 billion people \non the planet, they would know it was green. Well, unless you are blind, or \nred-green colorblind, in which 1 out of 10 men really don't give a *&%$ \nabout how many shades of green there are. Thank you for listening to me \nspew.

I agree that no matter what, that \ncorvette will be reflecting 650 nm wavelength to everyone, and everyone \nwill call it \"red\".  However, the moment our eyes convert that 650 nm \nwavelength into electrical impulses, and our mind tries to interpret / \nprocess those electrical impulses, all similarity is thrown out the window. \n No two brains are identical, like fingerprints, like trees, snowflakes, \netc.. so those electrical impulses will travel different paths in our \nbrains, and be interpreted differently for everyone. While the impulses \ncreated from a 650 nm wavelength of light will always travel the same paths \nin your mind to create what you know as \"red\" in your mind, for someone \nelse that 650 nm wavelength of light can and will travel a different path \nin their mind, and create what you know as \"blue\", but they know it as \n\"red\".  You will both be experiencing different colors, but both referring \nto the same wavelength.",

Cool.\n\nIt also suggests (via analogy to AI) how we could assess the actual values \nof qualia in our experience: if we could brain-map two different people's \nidea of \"red\", we could recognise whether they were actually different.  \nThis would require neurology and instrumentation beyond our current \ncapabilities, but it is very easy to see how it could be possible: if our \nsubjective visual processing attaches to a fixed set of connections in a \nfixed order, it would in theory be easy to identify that someone's \"red \npathways\" look a lot more like my \"green pathways\" than my red ones.\ufeff",

I'm not good enough to graduate school\" or \"I'm not good \nand responsible enough to start a family or take care of the family I have \nat the moment\". Basically all the emotions that I have not (or rarely) felt \nin the time I was awake comes flooding down. Mostly negative emotions. \nThere are less often times where my brain goes to overdrive or something \nand suddenly, I feel like my Japanese is more fluent and I remember a whole \nlot of things that I've forgotten a long time ago, lessons from class would \nstart coming back to me and I would start wondering about the weird things \nin the universe like \"Who made us?\" and stuff like that. There are rare \nchances of me entering that \"mode\" when I'm up and about.

Which he doesn't. All PERSON A knows is that B did point at the red \ncrayon, so this test is completely worthless.\n\nIf your teacher taught you that the colour \"RED\" was called \"BLUE\", then \nyour test would  work.

After proofreading I realize I rhymed and alliterated \nunintentionally so there's a bit of art.  While typing might not be the \nfastest form of artistic expression(a picture is worth a thousand words), \nit's at least something that with practice can be learned by anyone, it's \nup to them to choose to use it to it's fullest at that point.

The act of 'feeling' \nabstractly. \nUX designers face the challenge to try and guess how other people, with \ndifferent minds, experience an interactive product. It is more or less the \nsame problem that every designer or artist that have to deliver any kind of \ninformation to an 'user' or an 'audience' have to deal with every day. \n\nHow can we craft amazing experiences when experiences and feelings are \noften very difficult to communicate and - actually - seems like there is no \nway to prove that 2 people experience the world in the exact same way?\n\nCheck out this genius video about this topic (is very enjoyable, and not \nboring at all\u2026 or is it?)\ufeff",

The simple fact is that we are \nboth physiologically and psychologically able to perceive colors.

Yes, red is out there in the world.... to us. It is \nconstructivist, but logical.\n\nAnd indeed everything you have ever felt, tasted, or heard all did happen \nin your head. It doesn't mean that those things aren't real or experienced \nsimilarly by many different people. It just means the equipment you used to \nexperience it is also similar, or identical which is the whole point of DNA \nand genetics, yes?

                "text": "Saying our reds can be different is meaningless when we can never know that \ndifference, if it existed. Also, saying our reds can be different would \nalso be stating our genetics can different, well, they can, to a degree. \nThe remaining question is how much difference, if any, can there be to our \nvision due to slightly different genetics? Can there be slightly different \ngenes to slide the difference in perception of light wavelengths one way or \nanother when it comes to our eyes and brain perception of signals from \nthem? In that case, I imagine there can be slight difference in perceived \ncolors, but a red is still a long wavelength of light and a blue still a \nshorter wavelength of light. Relative to another, colors will still produce \na linear difference, one from the other, a red will still only affect the \ncones of the eye which respond to longer wavelengths, blue to the ones \nwhich respond to shorter. I guess from there it's all perception baby and \nwe know we perceive things differently, but when it comes to something so \nbasic and hard wired into us from our genes which are probably so close as \nnot to make much difference in this area, I think we are probably seeing \nthe same red. From here it becomes a philosophical discussion, I guess, \nexcept for one good example, individuals who are color blind, this is an \nexample of extreme genetic difference when it comes to our eyes, they do \nsee color differently, except not different from one to the other, rather, \nunable to see the difference.\ufeff",

If we take the the odd cases, the people \nwith odd vision or faults in their vision we can get closer to the \nunderstanding on how people see colour. There are people with synaesthesia \nwhere their senses mix and they can experience for example colour as sound \nor even taste. Then there is the case of colours that do not exist and our \nbrain creates them like pink. Colour is a physical phenomena and \nmeasurable. Even if the concept of colour perception being different for \neach human is correct, how could the colours perceived be different and the \npsychological effects of colours be very similar across humans? What about \nthe perception of colour across other species? Look at how many plants and \nanimals generate specific colours to give information to other species. If \ncolour could be perceived so different across the majority of humans, how \ncomes across groups, civilizations and time the perception of such colour \nis the same?\n\n  I don't disagree that perception  is something generated in the mind, but \nfor most humans it must be the same. Brains work the same, so do eyes. \nThere are cases where tribes have developed extreme descriptions about \ncolour because of their environment. Look at the tribes that live close to \nthe north pole, they have multiple names to describe snow, based not just \non texture, but on colour, etc. Then there is the case that if you take \nsome coloured lens and use it for a long period of time you will dream on \nthis colour. This discussion is like saying that someone would be taught \nthat red is blue then their perception of red would be blue which is \nclearly a language issue rather than a perception issue. You could even go \nas far to say that this could be said about many if not all of the things \nwe perceive  For sure there are people out there that the perception of x \nor y colour is different, but overall I would say that it is very similar \nacross the board.",

                    "text": "+TheOriginalGinger213\nI also have an astigmatism and am nearsighted and this does play a role in \nthe way that our eyes perceive color. Since color is in fact not tangible \nor real, it is a wavelength emitted by an electromagnetic field that is \nperceived differently through the way the eye perceives the wavelength. So \nbecause of our mutual astigmatism our eyes are shaped differently than the \naverage \"normal\" persons eye. Due to this irregularity in shape the \nwavelengths are interpreted differently by each eye thus giving a different \nhue, or shade, to certain colors given off by the visual light spectrum.\n\nAll that being said having an astigmatism isn't the only thing, other than \ncolorblindness, that affects the perception of color. Any shape \nirregularity having to do with your eye will alter your perception of color \nas it's a wavelength that is registered through rods and cones and many \nother anatomical devices which means that shape irregularity in your eye \nalters how it is reflected and refracted as you perceive it to alter the \nwavelength that you are seeing.\n\nI hope that makes sense, if not I'd be more than happy to explain a \ndifferent way that might help you to understand if you are curious. I hope \nthis helps in explaining why you see a difference in color with each \nindividual eye. Also feel free to ask if you want an explanation as to why, \nwhen you look at a color with both eyes, it is not altered in a blueish or \nyellowish hue. The human body is an amazing thing in how it works. Hope \nthis helps! :D",

Now you end up with an uneven a distribution of wavelength \nsensitivity, where maybe you have a slight lack of sensitivity in the 521 \nto 531 nm range, and is over sensitive in the 553 to 559 nm range, and that \n\"heat map\" will differ from human to human. It would even differ from eye \nto eye, and probably during your lifetime as well, as your cells die and \nare replaced.\n\nSuppose you now looked at an object that emits light at exactly 525 nm. You \ndo this several times during your lifetime. But during that life time your \neyes have changed slightly, so one year it was more sensitive to that \nwavelength and the next year it was less sensitive. It'd still be the same \nwavelength, but your brain would be getting a different signal.\n\nAnd that's where it gets interesting, because you \"know\" that it's supposed \nto be that specific colour.

(As long \nas we talk about basic stuff like colors where subjective bias finds no \nreason to apply.) Of course, empirically this is unprovable, but it can be \nderived logically from empiric evidence.\nIn short: Red looks the same for everybody because that which observes is \nnot an individual, but the unified consciousness. There is only one \nobserver, thus there cannot be deviations in conscious experience. While \nthe perspective, the viewpoint, is subjective, the nature of consciousness \ncannot be altered.\nThis is tough stuff for narrow-minded scientists (because mindblowing), but \nin Eastern spiritual sciences, it is nothing new.",

Your statement was what you said \"seems\" to \nbe the case. Then you provided a guess as an analogy.\n\n\"A lot of the dolphin's \"intelligence\" seems to be [an] illusion\"\n\n\"Guess it's just shooting a dart and accidentally hitting a target, then \nsaying you're a good shot.\"\n\nAll I did was point out the fact that to someone who is making assumptions \nbased on what \"seems\" to be happening, then their definition of whether or \nnot a species is intelligent will rely on how that individual defines \nintelligence. Nothing more.\n\nI am not talking about what a cognitive ethologist or behavioral ecologist \nmight think. You suddenly bring up intelligence and it's definition on a \nscientific level, but your first comment provided no clue that you were \nspeaking on a scientific level.\n\nWe're not all scientists here on YouTube. We don't all know what science \ndefines intelligence as. As such, I was simply pointing out that discussing \nit in YouTube comments is pointless, because chances are, we all define it \ndifferently.\n\nAs I said...\n\n\"These concepts are poorly explained in common contexts, and it takes \npeople with united definition of each to be able to decide what's true or \nnot.\"\n\nCommon contexts are not scientific contexts. And because scientists have an \nawareness of what true intelligence is defined as, they have a united \ndefinition of it. Therefore, YouTube in general shouldn't even bother \ndiscussing this.",

Intelligence on a scientific level has been perfectly well \ndefined for some time. It does not take people with united definition of \neach to be able to decide what's a fact and what isn't because that isn't \nhow facts work. That's how opinions work. An individual who is physically \nnot capable of the average brain's capabilities is mentally retarded and a \ndeformity in the species. Stupid people are capable of being just as smart \nas their brain allows them, however due to their experiences in life, \ndecisions, willingness to learn, or perception, they have limited \nthemselves to the intelligence they have.\n\nWe view these things as negative because they hurt our species as a whole. \nWe apply this to other creatures and expect them to be on the same level as \nus because we see what we perceive as successful for our species is \nsuccessful for all life in general. Elephants morn their dead too? You'd \nsay it's a positive thing. Why exactly is that positive for any reason? \nBecause we do it too.\n\nAs a social creature we try to relate to anything we can even though such \nrelation to what we apply it to could be completely alien and even \ninvisible to the subject. What kind of extraterrestrial life do we long for \nthe most? One that can communicate with us and one that has the \npotentiality to understand and be on the same level as us and our culture. \nThis is why we make bullshit up about dolphins that has been debunked for \nages. We want every living thing to be just like us and we'll project \nourselves on it anyway we can and adorn it with all our hopes and dreams. \nOf course dolphins communicate, every living thing does.\nIf you want truly smart animals then have crows, rats, and octopi.

You can see that every day, just by browsing YouTube \ncomments.\n\nBut regardless, it seems to me that you might be talking about either tamed \nperformance dolphins, or just dolphins viewed in controlled situations.\n\nTo be fair, it is difficult to judge how intelligent a species is, because \njust like with humans, it varies for each individual. The discussion of \nwhether or not dolphins can communicate and whether or not they are \nintelligent always boils down to something very simple:\n\nIt depends on what you as an individual define what \"communication\" and \n\"language\" mean, and what \"intelligence\" means.

                    "text": "+L2K4D44L4R hi there, I think you're slightly mistaken if you check the \nEncyclopedia of philosophy it definitely states that \"Locke appears to have \nbeen the first to formulate explicitly an inverted spectrum scenario\" ... I \nthink what you're referencing to when quoting Democritus and the \nfascinating points he made is more to do with another very interesting \nphilosophical inquiry called the \"primary versus secondary quality \ndistinction\" which Locke and many others have worked on but originates from \nDemocritus(amazing feat given the time he lived in)...\n\nLocke also put forward some idea's on the primary versus secondary quality \ndistinction that you were pointing out but he would conclude that it \ncontradicts the last line of your second paragraph, Locke stated that we \ndefine an object by its primary and secondary qualities. He takes heat as \nan example of a secondary quality. If you put one hand in a bucket of cold \nwater, and the other hand in a bucket of warm water, then put both hands in \na bucket of lukewarm water, one of your hands is going to tell you that the \nwater is cold and the other that the water is hot. Locke says that since \ntwo different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot and \ncold, then the heat is not a primary quality of the water and rather a \nsecondary quality of perception. Instead of two hands you could of course \nexpand the idea to two people disagreeing about the water being hot or \ncold...  \n\nThe biggest problem I had with the Vsauce video (and I am a fan) is that he \nbadly misrepresented Dan Dennetts position which is one I find the most \npersuasive ... Dan explicitly rejects the use of the term Qualia on the \ngrounds that at best its incoherent and worse it's actually causing a \nprofound amount of confusion ... he even goes so far as to reject the \nmedium in which qualia are supposed to be taking place If there is no such \nmedium, there is no fact of the matter about whether one's qualia (as \ndistinguished to one's merely reactive dispositions) are inverted.. \n\nI would like draw your attention to the last sentences of your piece \", \nRussian differentiates between sky blue and darker blue, using two distinct \nwords for two colors that we (can) call by the same word. This still does \nnot mean that a Russian sees the color of the sky in any other way than I \ndo.\" ... This is all about fascinating and ferociously debated subject of \nlinguistic relativity and the color naming debate, You should check out \nthis documentary :\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1kabkn_bbc-horizon-2011-do-you-see-what-i-see-pdtv-xvid_tech \n  \nskip forward to 45:30 and check out the piece on the muwabi tribe\nthere is actually some very interesting empirical evidence that may suggest \nthat the language structures we use to understand the world actually have a \nprofound effect on the way we perceive the world.... I was very very \nsurprised when I first stumbled across this information.. I honestly don't \nknow what to think anymore except that I find it incredibly difficult to \nthink about the mind and conscious experience, I also find myself pulled \nmore towards the methods of thinking and the theories of mind from people \nlike Dennett, Metzinger, Sapolski ... the more I try to understand this \nstuff the more confused I become.... thank you for your repy",

                    "text": "+Erick Murphy You're actually placing the appearance of this idea a couple \nof thousand years too late. See Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \n\"[Democritus] famously denies that perceptible qualities other than shape \nand size (and, perhaps, weight) really exist in the atoms themselves: one \ndirect quotation surviving from Democritus claims that \u2018by convention sweet \nand by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by \nconvention color; but in reality atoms and void\u2019\".\n\nThe example in the video of the green strawberry is misleading, and the \nwhole treatment of the video of this interesting philosophical question is \na bit shallow. Democritus couldn't have known it: colour is the mental \ncorrelate of a physical fact. Of course I can find out if you see a similar \ncolour, which we call \"red\", as I do when looking at a ripe strawberry. The \nsensations and connotations that come with a colour are another matter. But \nit is not possible that what to me is green is red to you and that at the \nsame time what to me is red is blue to you, and that what to me is blue is \norange to you. Not anymore at least than it is possible that what is hot to \nme is cold to you.\n\nDisabilities aside, it is of course natural that all humans (and all \nmembers of the same species in general) roughly agree on their assessments \nof physical facts because the correct assessment of those facts enables \nindividuals to survive. One of those facts is the wavelength of the light \nreflected by objects.\n\nNevertheless, the colour spectrum may be compartmentalised differently in \ndifferent cultures. Without speaking the language I've been told that, for \nexample, Russian differentiates between sky blue and darker blue, using two \ndistinct words for two colours that we (can) call by the same word. This \nstill does not mean that a Russian sees the colour of the sky in any other \nway than I do.",

                    "text": "+breezebro It's even worse than that. All our ideas are just abstractions \nand abstractions always omit the details.\n\nFor example, \"male\" and \"female\" are concepts we think of as perfectly \nbinary, but in practice even physically it's more of a spectrum that just \ntends to cluster around the two extremes (even the XX/XY distinction isn't \nperfect -- e.g. there can be more than one \"X\" but the child will only \ndevelop as a male if \"his\" SRY gene is functional).\n\nAnother example is: we don't actually speak the same language. Every person \nhas their own \"ideolect\", which is generally based on those of the people \naround us (i.e. parents or people we grew up with, but also those we \ninteract with as adults) and it is constantly changing until we die. What's \nworse, we also have various different subsets we use depending on who we \ntalk to or even how we feel. It's not surprising machines are bad at \nunderstanding us -- it's far more amazing other humans do.\n\nWe like to think that we are all \"born equal\", but this is actually not \ntrue in the direct sense: every single person is different (and in fact, \neach person is different at any given moment, right down to the cells they \nare made of). The idea isn't that we are actually all the same -- it just \nmeans we should all enjoy the same rights irrespective of where we come \nfrom.\n\nIt's easy to wonder what the point of abstractions is if they are so \nobviously broken, but it's simply a consequence of how our brains work. In \norder to be able to reason about the real world at all, we need to be able \nto compare situations, objects and persons to other scenarios we have \nexperienced before. And to make them comparable we need to reduce them to \ntheir common denominator leaving us with mere abstractions. If we wouldn't \ndo this, we could only perceive but never reflect or act upon those \nperceptions.\n\nOh, and this is also where stereotypes, superstitions and prejudices come \nfrom. We are not only wired to group our experiences, we're also wired to \ndetect causal relationships (even where there are none) and agency (even \nwhen things are not caused by any living being).

If you are encouraged to try lots of new \nfoods as a child, I think you are given a wide variety of things you like, \nso the chances are that if you come across something new then it won't be \ntoo outside your comfort zone, and you can tolerate it to the point of \neventually liking it. If you were not exposed to many types of food as a \nchild, then your 'acceptable range' of flavours is quite narrow, and then \nlater in life you will end up with lots of things that are well outside \nyour comfort zone, and it will take a lot more effort to like them.\n\nFrom my experience, you don't always like something the first time you try \nit; and sometimes you actually have to work quite hard to try and feel the \nbenefit of eating it! But once you are over that, the food can become \ntasty. This means that without that ability to try and like something \noutside of your comfort zone of eating, you will have a small palate of the \nthings you like. If you really go for it, I believe you can like almost any \nfood.\n\nThis state of mind must also help to some extent. If you are open to try \nlots of new foods, then you will slowly chip away at your flavour comfort \nboundary, increasing your comfort zone. If not, then you will just stay in \nyour edible comfort zone forever. It makes sense that this would require \neffort, as there is probably an evolutionary advantage to only continue to \neat the food you already like. By doing this, you don't put your body at \nrisk of eating something that could kill you; if you have already eaten it, \nthen it is probably safe!\n\nIt would be amazing to raise a child on all the different foods of the \nworld to see what they will enjoy and dislike later in life.\n\nFeel free to call bullshit on any of this.

                "text": "I would like to share a theory.. The human eye can tell the difference \nbetween brightness and darkness. Due to increasing or decreasing of \nbrightness, we can determine whether a color is light or dark.. This can be \nmeasured by observing the reaction of the eye. I won't go as far to say \nthat colors like black and white are actual colors, but as humans we can \nagree that the color white is light and the color black is dark.. Probably \nalso the lightest and darkest colors we are able to see.\n\nIn that case, when looking at this screen on youtube, the background is \ncompletely white and the white color is represented by RGB colors at its \nhighest value (255, 255, 255). This is also a scientific definition, and I \nam not able to teach my brain to do differently. I can't say that other \ncolors like orange, purple, and yellow together in even amount, can give \nthe color white on the screen.\n\nTherefor I think that we can all agree that Red, Green, and Blue are colors \nthat are represented correctly to all of us. What I can't say for sure, is \nwhether you see these three colors as I do. Again we can look at the colors \nindividually, and perhaps my red colors is not your red color, but as far \nas I can see, the science can tell us that at least Red, Green, and Blue \nare colors that is separated as part of known colors to all of us.\n\nOn the other hand, i often experience people having different opinions of \ncolors and nuances. For example a very sharp red color, might appear more \norange to some people than red. Also the turkish colors might seem more \ngreen to some people while more blue for others.\n\nColors also have a different approach on people, that is not based on \nindividual observation. If you are in a yellow room, you are more likely \nwork different, than if you are in a blue room. This is again not something \nyou are taught but a psychological observation. \nhttp://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm This \nlink tells more about how colors can affect our trust and moods and this is \nnot something we choose to feel, but is determined by science.\n\nTherefor my conclusion would be, that it is very unlikely that humans \nexperience colors differently from each other.\n\nThanks for reading.\ufeff",

If we were able to measure the emittance \nof radiation from a colored object, that object's color could have a set \nvalue. Things with other color values would be proven different colors, \neven though the colors may be interperated differently by each individual. \nOf course we also need to take note that even though we are \"alone in the \nmind\" because we never have proof of others' consienceness, genetically and \nchemically people are similar; leading to the assumption that people have \nthe same qualia.\ufeff\n\npretty mind blowing philosophical stuff. probably better just to not think \nabout it, it would cause too much pain... on another hand how do we feel \npain?....",

This \nmeans, we are also animals. So a statement along the lines of \"No animal \nhas the same ability to  '...do this...' as a human\" is wrong. Human \nanimals have that ability.

This is what is explained in the video, there is no way our minds can \ninterpret what they will see. So when we consider the 'potential of various \ncolours' there's nothing physical we can actually consider. 'Colour' is \nsomething we as humans give to the whole spectrum of colours we see, \nanything outside that is impossible for our brains to process and then \ncannot be defined truly as a colour, as colour is subjective.",

It shows an understanding of the concept that someone else knows \ninformation that you yourself do not. And that asking questions is a way to \nget access to that information.

Saturation and luminosity \nprobably similarly vary slightly from person to person.\nThat is not theory to be contemplated. The research has been foundational \nto many commercial applications. That's still just our perception; all the \nwavelengths of light in the world don't care about our eyes.\n\nUnfortunately, it has not made it into modern art schools (or Vsauce's \nchannel apparently).

Indeed, I \nbelieve that this barrier is only apparent and that it arises as a result \nof language. This sort of obstacle emerges when there is any translation \nfrom one language to another.\nHow does this idea apply to the brain and the study of consciousness? I \nsubmit that we are dealing here with two mutually unintelligible languages. \nOne is the language of nerve impulses - the spatial and temporal patterns \nof neuronal activity that allow us to see red, for example. The second \nlanguage ... is a natural spoken tongue like English or German or Japanese \n...\"\np. 231 Phantoms in the Brain\n\nIn other words, he says, the problem with qualia is a language barrier. If \nwe were to bypass spoken/written language and directly connect the neural \npathways from my color-processing areas to yours, there would be no \nintermediate language translation. At least in theory, you would see what \nmy eyes saw, and know what it's like for me to see red.\n\n\"The key idea here is that the qualia problem is not unique to the \nmind-body problem. It is no different in kind from problems that arise from \nany translation, and thus there is no need to invoke a great division in \nnature between the world of qualia and the material world. There is only \none world with lots of translation barriers. If you can overcome them, the \nproblems vanish.\"",

Take for instance synesthesia or more specifically chromesthesia \n where sounds evoke a sensation or perception of actual color. There are \npeople out there that have this and do not know the majority of the \npopulation do not experience sound in this way.\nI always take issue with statements of our knowing something to be true \nbecause our brains interpret our environment so we may perceive something a \ncertain way but that doesn't necessarily make it true.\nI like this as a demonstration:\nPenn & Teller Explain Ball & Cups on Jonathan Ross 2010.07.09 (Part 2)\nYou know what is going on, you are told what is going on, you can see what \nis going on, but somehow your brain is still being hacked by these two \ntalented magicians. Your mind makes assumptions about what it will see and \nthat overrides what you actually see. If you frame flip through the vid \nit's all clear but if you watch it at full speed your mind kicks in and \ndoes what it does. \nThe only things we can say for certain are true are statements about self. \nI like cheese, I feel sad, red to me appears vibrant. \nTo some degree we all suffer from some degree of Sally-Ann, believing that \nyou experience things the same way that I do.\nSally Anne Test..mpg\n\nThe mind is a wonderful playground.",

And there \nare many things that change the way we see color. There was a study done \nwhere they should a bunch of American people and some people from some \ntribe somewhere several cards one after the other. Each card had a slightly \ndifferent shade of orange, but then the Americans were shown the cards, \nthey all believed them to be the exact same color, \"orange\". When the \ntribesmen were showed the same cards, they could easily tell the difference \nbetween the different shades in orange. Why? Because they had words for \nthem. When the cards were placed side-by-side, then the Americans could \neasily see the differences in shade, but once they were separated again \nthey could no longer \"see\" the difference in color, even though they knew \nthey were different. There has been a HUGE amount of research on how \nlanguage affects what we see and how we see it. So, if just having names \nfor slightly different shades of orange can change how we see color, then \nit is by no means unreasonable to think that billions of other factors \ncould determine how we see any particular color. And on that note, what \nlooks like blue to you may objectively look like your red to someone else, \nbut since it's internally consistent in each person's brain, you would \nnever know. You'd use the same word to refer to something, and not know \nthat it looks completely different to them. And it's something you could \nnever know, because there is no objective description of color, because \nthat isn't possible.",

These are literary examples used to teach \nyoung children.\nThese aren't the actual reasons colors got associations. Most will have to \nwith myths and associations with other meanings. Maybe some \nplant/flower/etc was meant to have healing powers. Whatever color this \nplant is might soon be associated with healing/life/etc. Maybe a specific \nflower/gift was commonly used for a certain occasion (wedding/death/etc), \nthat color may now represent love, or darkness. Maybe there is a venomous \nsnake that is identified by it's color. Even something like water, a \ntropical place might have a different association with blue (water) than \nthat of a desert or a tundra.\n\nI'm fairly certain that purple came to be associated with royalty due to \nthe fact that purple was an expensive/hard to obtain/create dye, and this \nmeant only wealthier people could afford (to waste money on) purple cloth.\n\nMany things come into play. I can assure you that color association is not \njust \"Water blue; water is cold; blue now means cold\". People (other than \nmaybe poets) don't care about things like that. Associations developed for \nactual reasons. Some are bound to overlap between many cultures, and some \nare bound to be distinct. The human brain tries to be smart with the \nconnections and associations it makes. So, either the associations were \ntaught, or there was an importance to the color for some specific reason. \nEverything is a color, and everything can have hundreds (thousands, \nmillions) of associations drawn from it. There needs to be a deep \nimportance for an association to connect to an entire culture.",

Our sun \nfor example emits full spectrum 'white light' - Colour is a reflected \nwavelength of light which is emited by a light source and the light source \ndoesn't have to be a star.\nA green apple absorbs the light that doesn't fit within the spectrum of \n'green', and reflects the green spectrum giving us it's perceived colour.",

Said that then to see the color of a ray of light at just one \nwavelength; our eyes take that single signal and convert it into three \nsignals, how much red, green and blue is in what we see. This is how we see \ncolors. So, when we want to reproduce those colors, e.g., in our computers, \nwe use three kinds of light and modify their amplitudes to generate the \nsame perception of that color in our eyes... Buuuut, what's on the screen \nis not the same original color; remember, the original thing has only one \nwavelength, not three but we are using three wavelengths now, in each pixel \non the screen, each wavelength fine tuned to trigger the perception of each \nkind of receptor in our eyes and our brains have no way to know they're \nbeing tricked... Both signals are very different, but we see them exactly \nthe same and call it the same. Colors are a fake thing created by our \nlimited perception of the world.\n\nFor the second part. Man, your eyes are different than mine, your retina is \ndifferent than mine, your proportion of color receptors is different on \nyour retina that on mine, your nerves are wired similarly, but not exactly \nequal as mine and your brain is trained very different by your childhood \nthan mine, meaning... you and me have different physical structures, \nsimilar but different and we still identify blue as blue, that's only \npossible if our brains fine tune our different perceptions, causing our \nbrains to use different signals and representations...",

It gathers OUR \ninterpretation, because the camera was built so: to gather what people were \nexpecting to see as a result.\nSame thing with LCD. It was the human who adapted the liquid crystal \ntechnology, in order to reproduce the colors that he wanted to see on the \ndisplay. The bottom line is that you cannot treat this human built \ntechnology as an independent observer.\nI would define camera+lcd as \"image reproducing device\". No matter how we \nsee the input color, the output color will be the same as the input color.\n\nBut, your example this is a very good way to explain the topic to Luxai.\nIf the image sensor on the camera is our eye that collects the info, and \nthe LCD display is what we end up seeing in our conscience, then our brain \nwould be the processor in the camera. And the \"special effects\" of the \ncamera would be our topic. If the camera had an effect to swap the colors \naround, then you could relate that to a human that has seen the colors \ndifferently since day 1.\nSepia effect would be color blindness for some animals and maybe humans, \nthen we have black and white effect... Hopefully nobody has fish eye \neffects =)",

Take the following into consideration:\n1) Eyes perceive the colors, but brain is what you use to understand and \nstore them. The brain has a different structure than eyes, meaning you have \nto translate the color into an internal representation. Maybe your brain \ndoes it in a different way.\n2) The amount of color recognizer cells in your eyes are different than \nmine. Despite your eyes are sending different signals to your brain than my \neyes to my brain, we recognize the same color, meaning we translate \ndifferent signals into the same concept.\n3) What about people with color blindness? They still recognize some colors \nwe also recognize but fail with others... So they have internal \nrepresentations of colors different than us, cause they still see things \nand recognize them.\n4) What about people and animals with tetrachromacy? They have four \ndifferent cone cells in they eyes while common people have only three. They \nsee some colors we cannot see. I think they use different internal \nstructures to represent colors based in a four-tuple rather than me, using \na three-tuple of data.

You can read about a \nwoman that sees more colors than us, colors we don't even have a way to \nimagine: http://digitaljournal.com/article/326976.\n5) Compare it to another sense, hearing. My brother and i agree in what \nnotes does the tetris song have... but i can hear more high pitches than \nhim, and he is able to hear some low frequency sound i'm deaf to. That \nmeans, he have an internal representation for sounds i don't have in my \nbrain and i have internal representations of high frequency sounds his \nbrain is not aware of.
