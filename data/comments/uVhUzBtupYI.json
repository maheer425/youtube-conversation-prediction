She has a cone \naround her head because she keeps licking her fur away :I so I would ask \nHow do I set her mood again? She is a really playful cat to begin with, we \ndon't even need to buy toys for her! Heh she just finds things to play with \nall the time! Like pens, socks! She also goes trough my drawer and steals \nstuff just for fun I guess! That's why I love her so much! She has been \nlike this since she was 1 month old I guess! Thank you mr. Galaxy :) please \nhelp may I ask politely! ~Katelyn\ufeff",

He would scratch my \nvinyl carpet and the door like his life depended on it and made crazy \nsounds like he was about to die. He also peed everywhere while I was at \nwork.\n\nHe was neutred (?) when he was 6 months old. I took off the caps from the \ncat toilets and bought an extra cat toilet and that helped. When Jinx \nunexpectedly died, I decided to buy a new cat as a friend for Mello. A 2,5 \nyr  Turkish Angora female. That went well for a while. But unfortunately, \nsomething happened, and they couldn't get along anymore. I tried everything \npossible, but eventually I had to find her a new home. Now it's just Mello \nand I and we are waiting for a new Turkish Angora male kitten <3\n\nHe still wants to be near me, but I managed to keep him out of the toilet \nonce I'm in there. He doesn't cratch on the door anymore or make crazy \nnoices, so that's a relief! The only thing he still does is scratching my \nvinyl carpet, which is damaged because of all the scratching. When he does \nthat I open the door, far enough so he can see me, but not wide enouhg so \nhe can come in. Sometimes I can close the door again.

My family \nhad a cat before I was born. One day a homeless momma cat with a kitten \nwalked into their kitchen through a window. They ended up keeping the \nkitten and a friend adopted the momma. The kitten grew up to a loving, \nsocial and veeeery patient boy (my sisters were 1 and 3 y.o when he moved \nin and would push the cat around in a dolly-pram etc). He was used to come \nand go as he pleased, no leash. He'd wait outside every morning and follow \nmy mom all the way to kindergarten and back home a few meters behind her \nand the kids. \nThat's the closest I've ever heard of cats going on actual walks.\nCats on a leash will set the pace and direction for your walks. You can \npull a bit on the leash to turn her away from going into bushes etc where \nyou can't go or the leash might tangle and to indicate a preferred \ndirection.\nBut trying to control where she goes and a slower/faster pace too much will \nlikely cause her to:\nLay down on her side refusing to walk/attempt to squirm out of her \nharness/hiss and growl, hunch down or jump to gtfo.\nAlso most cats like to stop and eat grass or lay in the sun, some never \nwant to do anything else on walks but find a nice spot of grass and chill \nthere.\nYour cat will love to go out on a leash IF you do it right and have \npatience.",

Here's \nhow:\n1. Get her used to wearing the harness indoors. Then add leash.\n2. Do not pull her out by the leash, either \n2.1 open the door and relax, let her get used to seeing and hearing the \noutdoors by the open door, harness and leash on. Let her set the pace she \nwants to go outside and how far/how long at a time to be out. This will \neventually make her feel secure and comfortable to go on regular outings.\n2.2 harness+leash on, pick her up and go outside, still holding her, and go \na short distance from your door, (preferably so she doesn't see the door) \nto a spot that's quiet and calm. Minimal nearby traffic and people! Put her \ndown, patch of grass is great, and sit down next to her. Be calm, speak \nwith a soft, encouraging voice. If there's no sudden noises/movements to \nfreak her out, she will begin to look around, sniff the air and what's \nclose. Then she will take a few tentative steps and if it's still as \ncalm/quiet soon she will be curiously exploring! \n\nI've tried both ways with different cats and have in mere hours gotten my \nindoor-cat loving leash-walks outside and after just 2-3 days with 1-3 15 \nmin walks (the first time will take min 2 hours of patience) they began \nexpecting and demanding it by meowing at the door, getting excited just \nseeing the leash!\nMy dad has a 12 y.o indoor-cat he takes out on a leash twice everyday! His \ncat meows LOUDLY for his walks. When he's accidentally gotten out of his \nharness he's ran ahead to the door to wait for my dad.",

If it's \"just because,\" I would \nsuggest just letting her be. If she doesn't want to go out on the walks, \ndon't make her. Dogs need to go outside in order to have space to exert all \nof their energy and take care of their business, cats don't. The poor thing \nprobably just feels like you're tormenting her. \nHOWEVER, if you're trying to help her feel more in control of her \nterritory, try positive association. Let her investigate the harness. \nWhenever you get her in harness (if possible), give her a treat. [:",
