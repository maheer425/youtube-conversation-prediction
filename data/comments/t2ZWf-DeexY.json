                "text": "1:27 The part about the \"WORLD'S LARGEST MAZE\".\nLooks impressive, but nope, well not to me anyway, and possibly not to you \neither in a moment.\n\nI wrote a program in Python which creates a random maze, the same type as \nin the video (World Largest).\nI wrote the entire program in only 29 lines of code. Pretty impressive. I \nusually write about 200+ lines in my other programs.\n\nThis is the actual function which generates the whole maze. I wrote it in \nonly 13 lines:\n\ndef build(self):\n    adj = self.adjacent(self.pos)\n    if not adj:\n        for i in self.points[::-1]:\n            adj = self.adjacent(i)\n            if adj: self.points = self.points[:self.points.index(i)]; \nself.pos = i; break\n    if adj:\n        rand = random.choice(adj)\n        new_dir = rand[0]-self.pos[0], rand[1]-self.pos[1]\n        if new_dir != self.dir and len(adj)>1: self.points += [self.pos]\n        self.tiles += [(rand[0]-new_dir[0]//2,rand[1]-new_dir[1]//2),rand]\n        self.pos, self.dir = rand, new_dir\n        return True\n\n\nSo basically that guy having the record isn't a big deal at all. It's just \na matter of how long he left his computer running.\nI could beat his record by a long shot over night. I could just set my \ncomputer (Script i wrote for Python) to build a maze 4 times as big as his, \ngo to sleep, wake up, it'd be done. Also i say 4 times as big cause that \nwould form another great big square!\n\nPlus another thing i figured out was, if you make Python have a process \nbar, it makes the program much slower, if you just forget about graphics \nand have the computer run it's fastest on the Command Console, it goes much \nfaster.\n\nCause having it open a window and draw objects makes if do more work, but \nleaving it to re-loop the same simple function (From above) over and over \nuntil it's complete is much much quicker. When the function finally returns \nFalse it's finished and stores the image.\n\nExtras:\n\nThe other code in my program was setting up an empty list for the walls to \nbe added, another function was to get the adjacent tiles, defining the size \nof the grid and having a bit of code ensure it rounds up to the appropriate \nsize so the maze has borders around the edges, setting the starting point \nto the center and finally one last function to export the maze into an \nimage.\ufeff",
