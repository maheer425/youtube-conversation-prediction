I wish parents could teach \nchildren true values like not discriminating between classmates, supporting \nclassmates with good words when they succeeded, encouraging them, and also \nuplifting failing classmates and advising them. Parents should explicitly \nteach children to be very kind to other kids. This is because you do not \nknow who will become who!!! I have seen where the ugliest and most bullied \nteenage girls suddenly becomes the most beautiful at the age of 30. ",
