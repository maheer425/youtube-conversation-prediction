I don't see anyone throwing fits, except for the people being \nangry about people pointing out some weird flaws. I wouldn't mind the \nwheelchair thing either but that's something completely random.\n\nThe fact is, it wouldn't be so hard for them to not have to make everyone \nstraight. Also, they already have romance and relationships in this game, \nand with that follows sexuality, naturally. Like in Sims, it just happens. \nIt's not a big deal, they wouldn't have to include anything, they'd only \nhave to have the miis be able to fall in love with everyone. That's why \npeople are a bit annoyed. It's a very simple thing to do. They would almost \nhave to do nothing. They have programmed them to be straight. That's more \nwork than just let shit happen.\n\nPersonally I don't mind either way, I would prefer to have it be slightly \nmore realistic in that one aspect though. And I don't see any reason for \nthat to be annoying so many people. What is it with people getting mad \nabout constructive criticism or personal preference?\n\nI see lots of people complaining about tons of other games. No one gives a \ncrap. But as soon as it involves gay people, it's because gay people are \ncrazy  and narcissistic. I'm not even gay myself, but relax.",

Including homosexual relationships isn't \npandering or homogenizing or unnecessary like you seem to think it is with \nyour (rather flawed) Call of Duty comparison, it's basic sense. Call of \nDuty's target demographic is anyone who's into guns and shooting, not \n\"males\". Just like Tomodachi Life's demographic is anyone who's into quirky \nlife sims, not specifically heterosexuals. Or, rather, ideally, it *should* \nbe. \n\nLet's drop whether the exclusion of other facets of life is the same as \nthis. Instead, let's imagine the reality of game development. \n\nHow easy would it be to include male on male or female on female pairings? \nOr even bisexual relationships? Pretty goddamn simple. It's purely text and \nvisual dressing, but it's enough to get the job done. You've just pleased a \nconsiderable amount of your demographic with VERY little effort, minority \nor not. \n\nNow, how easy would it be to include wheelchair Mii's? That requires extra \nanimations for every activity/occurrence in the game, which is a lot. It \nessentially doubles the amount of animations. That's a lot of work for the \n(likely) even fewer in wheelchairs that would pick this game up. \n\nWhat about mental disabilities? Amputees? You see where I'm going with \nthis? \n\nIt's not the same. Them excluding homosexual/bisexual relations in a game \nthat's advertising itself as a life sim that features dating simply isn't \nacceptable in this age. ",

It makes the game more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nHmm. If Nintendo felt the need to apologize, I'm pretty sure people said \nsome rude crap to Nintendo. Lol who do you think you are? I completely \nunderstand the situation. Gay people think they should be in the game as \nanyone else is. Here's a question I found a while back. Why put something \nthat's mostly illegal into a video game? Nintendo could've just said that \nthey understand the situation but they said sorry as well. I don't like \nthat. They have nothing to be sorry about at all.\n\nI never said that. I said people will always find something to whine about. \nI went into great detail about this. If I feel that a feature is missing \nfrom a game or wasn't included and I get my friends/strangers to agree with \nme and we message Nintendo, that would be considered whining. Run on \nsentence I know. Just be happy with what's there. You don't need a large \ngroup of people to tell that you have a problem with something.",

In my opinion, its \nsomething basic and not something that ''people should feel lucky if they \neven added it''. This, when heterosexual relationships are allowed.\n\nNobody is forcing Nintendo anything. People are just upset; can you \nunderstand that at least?\n\nHow is apologizing bad? Really? Indeed they dont apologize for a lot but \nwhat's wrong; at least they understand the consumers more than you, in this \nsituation. \n\nYou honestly think people are just whining to be whining? Why would anyone \never criticize something for heavens sake if the only reason they ''whine'' \nis because they ''whine''. What???",

I think that's a possible action that could \nhappen.\n\nThe feature wasn't in the game. They don't have to add it to the game. \nThere are other Life Simulators out there. Why haven't they been attacked \nand \"forced\" to add a homosexual relationship option in the game?\n\nThey shouldn't have apologized. I explained this in my video if you'd like \nto give it a watch. My video probably sounds better than this. Nintendo did \nnothing wrong. They often don't acknowledge a lot of things. Why was this \nacknowledged? It would've gone away after a while. If you don't want the \ngame, don't buy it. Simple as that. People made Nintendo look like the \nvillain in the situation when they should've been looking at themselves. If \nI feel that a feature has been left out of a game or just not thought of \nand I complain to Nintendo about it, they won't add it. What makes this \nsituation any different? Oh it's because they're gay. Sexual orientation \nautomatically trumps over everything, huh? I think they're idiots if they \nwon't buy the game for this. I'm straight. What if there were no \nrelationships at all? I wouldn't care. Maybe they should do that. Either \nway, people will find something to complain and in some cases, their \nwhining will pay off.",

On the other hand due to the random nature of the game the \nimplementation of this would be pretty hard, too. Are you going to \nimplement set probabilities for Miis being gay? But what about the exact \npercentages then? Setting them as 50:50 wouldn't even closely resemble \nreality, but setting them to be realistic (aka homosexuals being a \nminority) might feel discriminating against them. The only sensible thing I \ncan think of is to have the player set the probabilities on his own in some \nkind of options menu.\ufeff",
