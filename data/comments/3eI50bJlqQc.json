Ik lots of people say, \"well, \nit's good for them to see what the world is really like\" but really? U \nwanna show them when they're in 1st GRADE??? They will learn about the \nworld on their own, same as most people should. It is much easier to accept \nthe world for what it is if u learn at ur own time and pace. So stop \nrushing the kids!!! They will learn when they understand a little more and \nhave matured more.",
