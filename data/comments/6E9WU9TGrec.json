Most of the historical publications available \nin the US are from the anglosaxon historiography, which I would not call \nthe most unbiased and that coined the Black Legend (which again, is not \nonly about what the Spanish did in America, but to \"demonize\" and degrade \nevery aspect of most of the spanish modern history and promote the \nstereotype of the spain as if it was populated by a bunch of greedy, cruel, \ninquisition loving religious fanatics that did not contribute at all to \nhumanity and whose empire was kind of meh. Advocates of the Black Legend \ntake the exception and make it the rule.\n\nAlso, history should be told taking into account the the \"moral\" standards \nof the time.\n\n\nIt would be much interesting if you made an entire video about the Black \nLegend and did some (unbiased) investiagion trying to search for the actual \nfacts and tryng to bypass that the world's top powers have been anglosaxon \nfor the last 250 years or so, information revolution included in that \nperiod...\ufeff",

Then \nwe forgive and forget, that's why we have a rather low amounf of wars, and \nthe ones that do break usually don't have indiscriminate use of force like \nyou see on Europe. No cities get nuked, no genocides are purpoted, and \ncivilians are largely spared.\n\nWe can't unite because we do have some huge ideological differences, and we \nalso do not use force to \"convert\" the neighboors. So Bolivia is very \nethnic, Venezuela and Cuba are very Commie, Chile and Per\u00fa are very \ncapitalistic, Colombia is basically a USA army base and so on. To make \nthings worse, the impossibility of trusting each other forces us to look \nallies elsewhere, and they in turn play us like pawns to deepen grudges, as \nyou see so clearly on Venezuela and Cuba, where the US is using all it's \ninfluence to ruin them, while countries like Argentina are trying to ruin \nSpain and Great Britain (emphasys on trying).\n\nNow, I don't think it's impossible, but I do feel that whenever we're close \nto achieving ideological unity either Russia, USA or Great Britain step in \nand offer military help to one side. The US prevented Spanish Allies to \nintervene during the independence wars, GB helped Chile win the Pacific War \nagainst Per\u00fa and Bolivia, so they hate us. Then in the 80s, Chile helped GB \nagainst Argentina. Colombia relies on USA money to keep the drug cartels at \nbay, and even bombed Ecuatorian territory to kill a drug overlord, then \nEcuador got really pissed and USA told him to back down, other countries \ngot angry. There's countless examples, but it usually comes down to foreign \npowers helping political minorities during times of hardships that \ndestabilize the good relationships of all countries. Ask your peruvian \nfriend if he'd invade Chile. He'd be like \"Fuck yeah\". Then ask him if he \nwould kill a chilean in the middle of the jungle. He'd probably go \"No! \nHe's a human being? What has he done to me?\". We're like that. So yeah, \nmaybe we'll never be unified, but you will not see all-out wars either.\n\nOh, and the last, and perhaps more important reason: We're all \nprotectionist, nationalistic and selfish. We say we want everyone to \nprogress. But if I can make my country get 1% more by making the other \n\"brother\" lose 2%, fuck it. I'll take it! So it all comes down as one big \nspiral of I fuck you becuase you fucked me last year.",

                "text": "This video is totally wrong and ignorant. There're different kinds of \nslavery and what we consider slavery today it wasn't yesterday. And what we \nconsider slavery yesterday isn't today. \n\nThe first slaves in America or Spanish America weren't all black people and \nthe first black people in Spanish America weren't slaves as in the \nexpedition of Juan Ponce de Leon in today's North America with free black \npeople or the Irish slavery in the British America. \n\nAccording to the University of Vanderbilt Spain in the time had moral and \nreligious values that promoted the honor, charity and paternalism to the \n\"miserable classes\" that made the slave a moral and legal person and the \nmajority of slave had the right, yes the right to self-buy and be free. The \nslave in Spanish America had the right to have and transfer properties and \nto proceed with legal actions and this lead to \"manumit\" the majority of \nslaves. This made that the most of slaves in the Spanish America were free. \n\nThere were so many free Black people is the Spanish America that they \nparticipated in the defense of Spanish colonies from the British army and \nBritish piracy. \n\nIn fact, Spanish Florida was a hope to black slaves from the British \nAmerica to reach freedom. Slaves from British America always tried to scape \nto the Spanish colonies. \n\nAnd other thing that the video doesn't say is that free black people in the \nSpanish North America became slaves when United Sates occupied the northern \nSpanish land and so on.\n\nAnd the numbers! In the middle of 18th century there were more slaves in \nUnited States than in Spanish America. \n\nSpain had something called \"the Laws of the Indies\" that protected the \nIndian people not only their culture, but also their land. The Spanish \ncrown protected the identity and property from the merchants, usurers, \nslavery-merchants etc. Why this video hides this? The Laws of the Indies \nwere abolished when liberals and supporters of independence took the power \nof Spanish colonies thanks to the British and Netherlands empires' help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Marietou Keita What happens sweety, is that in Hispanic countries you can \nfeel this resentment agaisnt Spain because of the Black leyend. The black \nleyend is one of the first and most succesful propaganda wars in History, \nin which most of the northern (and Protestant) european countries attacked \nand insulted Spanish culture, economics and Global empire. \n\nAnd today you see their results. People think that Spaniards where \ncompletely brutal in the conquest, which they where not. Also they think \nthe spanish inquisition burned indians and suppressed their culture, which \nthey also did not do that. And at the end the Indians where pictured as \nsimple beings, mere slaves that they couldn't defend themselves from the \nevil \"iberian\" landowner. Which again, was far far from the truth.\n\nWhen spaniards Waged their military campaigns across Nowadays Mexico and \nSouth america, they allied with shittons of tribes and rival communities \nfrom the Aztec and Inca empire respectively. And then, most of them married \nthe nobiity of those tribes and started making the first Mestizos of Latin \namerica. Later in colonial times most Franciscans and monks from differents \nparts of Spain travel to the Indies to indoctrinate peacefully tons of \nIndians and try to educate them into the European culture.\n\nAnd most of the time when the Spanish landowner got a little too ruthless, \nbecause that often happened,  the Natives revolted and killed them and \ntheir entire family. And this was endorsed by Spanish law, that any Native \nhad the right to defend themselves agaisn't the \"tirants, the powerful and \ndespotics\". \n\nWhat happens is that much of the \"Suffering\" that natives had in Spanish \namericas happened because of two things:\n1. the Decimation of their numbers through disease, a problem that wasn't \ncaused by the spaniards directly\n2. Later in the Colonial times and the republic, the natives and Spaniards \nwhere already the same culture, and most of the spaniards and spanish-born \namericans believed to be above them because they where lower class within \ntheir society, and this problem was acentuated and permanently endorsed in \nrepublic times. And that is human nature, and this kind of shit you see \neverywhere, people putting themselves above others because X reasons.",

Ethical \nRelativism breaks down under the principles of personal autonomy, fairness \nof the distribution of risks/rewards, nonmalefiecence, and beneficence. The \nobjective measure is the measure of the society that is making the \nmeasurement. The modern global society operates under these norms. As a \nhistorian and ethicist, you must understand that. The American Holocaust \nwas a morally condemnable act because it cannot be supported by any of the \npillars of moral strength. (Courage, Wisdom, Temperance, Commitment, \nCompassion, Conscientiousness, Discernment, Fairness, Fidelity, Freedom, \nHonesty, Integrity, Kindness, Respect, Hopefulness, and Tolerance). The \nGerman Holocaust was kept a secret from even hardened Nazis due to it \nrunning afoul of normal German ideas of justice and fairness at the time \nand would have been seen as a crime.\n\nI digress, my point is there is no objective history. Trying to do so takes \nthe human experience and the human consequence out of the narrative. In \ndoing that we risk de-humanizing the other and perpetuating further \natrocities.

They destroyed complex civilisations centuries old barely ever \nstopping to consider what implications this could have. No populations \nwerent the same.The reason why Mexico, Central America, and Andean \ncountries have high population of people who are of native descant is \nbecause there were tens of millions of more Natives that already lived \nthere, due to their agricultural society and lack of disease. In the US and \nCanada, the Natives were more semi nomadic so naturally their population \nwas way smaller but had huge territories.The majority of Native Americans \nwere killed after 1776 when America had declared their independence from \nEngland (and the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in general). The most \nimportant events when the Natives were killed by the Americans were between \n1776 and 1973, I've given a list bellow: (1973) Wounded Knee II - 2 (1890) \nWounded Knee - 178 (1864) Sand Creek Massacre - 200 (1862) Dakota War of \n1862 - 38 prisoners executed (1876) Battle of Little Big Horn - 136 (high \nestimate)\n(1838) Cherokee Removal - 4,000 (1817-58) Seminole Wars I,II, & III - 1475 \n(likely high as 10,000) (1831) Choctaw Removal - 2,500 (1812) Red Stick War \nof the Muscogee or Creek- 3,000 (1791) Battle of the Wabash - 21 (1830) \nIndian Removal Act It is estimated that 500,000 Native Americans have died \nsince 1776 due to \"removal\" or conflict. Although Many natives were killed \npre-1776 the number was far less significant and most persecution was in \nthe form of laws not killing.

It \nwas so bad that Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas - a bishop and first hand witness - \nwrote an account of what happened resulting in royal degrees stating the \nSpanish colonials had to behave better.\nIn North America, the English (after 1707 British) settlers initially tried \nto co-exist with the Amerindians. Territorial disputes led to violence, \nwhich became like for like. The Amerindians would attack resulting in \npunitive English action, or the English would attack resulting in \nAmerindian punitive action. There was no policy like the Spanish and it was \nnot as bad as to require Royal degree to put a stop to abuses. The British \nwere able to ally with numerous North American Indian tribes on a regular \nbasis. After theSeven Year's War, the British degreed everything west of \nthe Appalachian mountains to be Indian territory confining their colonies \nto the eastern coast. This was one of the long term causes of the American \nRevolution (along with a bunch of others).

Fortunately, there are also records made by the British or neutral \npeople to explain the situation of french colonists in territory of what is \ncalled now Canada, and there're even clearer! Like I explained, those \nrecords told about the trading and very respectful colony established by \nthe French, they realised those had many allies within the Native tribes, \nthey were mixed by kin or even very mixed (like the Manitoba M\u00e9tis), as it \nwas the condition imposed to the few colonists arriving there by the \ntribes, if they wanted to stay there and to trade a lot with them, it was \n\"become our parterns and brothers\", it was the best choice since the French \narrived in a new vast continent with extremely harsh weather that the \nnatives mastered perfectly. Even the evangelists trying to convert the \nnatives to \"the good faith\" didn't settle in colonists' territories and ask \nthem to come or to capture them, it was written that they went to explore \nand to meet them, learning somehow their languages to understand their way \nof life and tells, etc.\n\nSo to resume it shortly, it wasn't a spanish conquistador way of \ncolonisation with a motto like \"follow me\" to the indigenous, or the \nenglish producter and settler way with the motto \"get out of my way\" to \nthem, the French way in all actual Canada was about trade and respect with \na motto that would be like \"lead/show me\" to the natives. That is why the \nBritish disliked so much the french people there, not only because they \nwere hereditary ennemies for its 13 colonies, but fairly because they \ncolonise very differently and englishes found it disgusting the mixing with \nthose \"inferior savages\" (the conception of strict hierarchy of the races \nwas getting popular in the 18th). So it gave them a good reason to consider \nthe canadiens and others well inferior for a good time.",

Some people have traveled and/or are in the know, but most \ndon't get a clue. They could also think it is convenient for them, lol. \nThey need to masturbate the masses into their delirium, when, in fact, \nEnglish Speaking people are sheep too.\nI'd like to use the opportunity to thank you english msm defecators and \nspreaders, because 2008 was the first time in my life I watched living \nSpanish People on English Broadcast who were 'white', not the usual \nultra-tanned, mulatto or directly ebony Nigerian they always depicted as \n'Spaniards through US and UK media. It was @ EC08 celebrations, and \nOccident masses watched real Spanish Masses, and I could see on TV what I \nwatched in my life, something impossible to fake, a breach in the system!\n\n If you have read to this point, I tell you that, If you wanna know a \nlittle of something, go watch Bill Hicks, or George Carlin is his latter \nyears. They were fantastic people, ppl who knew English Media is fucked up, \nand almost all media is, and all sorts of msm media have in common they \nwant you STUPID, and unable to research anything, unable, to question \nstuff. Spain is very important for you to understand our World now, far \nmore than you can grasp now, I'm talking usury for example. Colonial US \nHistory also is KEY, ANDREW JACKSON for example, watch Bill Still's Money \nMasters if you mind too. We're in 2014 and d scam goes on and on, uncaught \nby sheeeeeeeeeeple.\n\nAnd yes, we the Spaniards are bad people, and we are murderers who won't \nmisuse a second to fuck your wive and make you eat your balls, and we all \nare like that, we don't mind: kill people, bulls, astronauts, we just don't \ncare, at all, we are the Spic Catchers on the Rye\n\nLast word for the beautiful and historic city of Cartagena de Indias, \nColombia. The first time the city appeared in English Media so far I knew, \nwas to be shown in the context of a trip to watch the 'Colombian donkey \nfuckers', and including fully English Speaking people arguing that it's \ntheir 'tradition'... In that bit they also had time to make obscene \ngestures at local kids which through the language barrier became unnoticed \nto them and innocently took as a funny moment. Disgusting. They did not do \nthat to people in US, freaking disgusting. Maybe you are too brainwashed to \nsee that as a problem, I don't know\n\nFunny thing is Spain helped USA became independent, it is just that in 1913 \nEuropean Bankers took control of 'America'. So the Earth keeps spinning.",

They perceive \nHispanics as loud, backward, and uncultured, and the constant portrayal of \nAnglo Saxons as being these calm, intelligent people does little to help \nthem change that image.\n\nFor others, it's because parents want their children to blend in better \nwith Americans, so they only talk to their children in English and do not \nspeak Spanish in their household. When I was younger, my father would only \nspeak to me in English so I would know English by the time I started \nschool. My mother would speak to me in Spanish, though.\n\nFor most, it's because we find English to be more convenient than Spanish. \nEnglish is a lot easier to speak because the language does not conjugate \nsubjects based on gender or number. Also, I've personally noticed that \nEnglish typically uses less syllables, has more word choices, and is a lot \nmore flexible than Spanish, so that's what draws me more to English than \nSpanish.\n\nWhen I was younger, I hardly spoke Spanish because I didn't have any need \nto. Both of my parents could understand what I said in English and I could \nunderstand what they said in Spanish, so I felt no need to actually speak \nthe language. However, I eventually grew ashamed at myself for not knowing \nthe language of my grandfathers so I started speaking it. Nevertheless, I \nnever did bother to learn how to read or write Spanish because I didn't see \nany point: I mostly communicate with people verbally, and everything is \nwritten in English in the United States, so why bother learning how to read \nand write Spanish?\n\nSorry for the long comment, but the question you are asking is complicated.",

I enjoyed it muchly, and even considered moving \nthere after my discharge from the Navy, but ultimately I remained in the US.\n\nThe earliest Christians were Jews, and used the Jewish Bible. However, as \nChristianity is distinct from Judaism, some additional directions were \nnecessary. Christianity represents a new relationship between God and man, \nso the additional books are known collectively as the New Testament. The \nfirst of these were the early letters of Apostle Paul; Galatians, \nEphesians, Philippians, Colossians, believed to have been composed about 50 \nA.D. Several people, including some of the authors of books that became \npart of the New Testament, wrote about the life of Jesus, to explain their \nfaith to the people they encountered.\n\nSome people, Jewish and Christian, include other books that are not \nconsidered canonical or divinely inspired, but are included among holy \nbooks as beneficial reading. These are the Apocrypha, which I distinguish \nas the Old Testament Apocrypha, because there is also a large collection of \nworks that could be called the New Testament Apocrypha, most of which are \nradical departures from Christianity.\n\nThe Kingdom of Israel covers a period of several centuries, about 600 \nyears, if I recall correctly. Prior to that time, Israel existed as a \ntheocracy, for about 400 years. So, ancient Israel existed, in one form or \nanother, for about 1000 years, give or take a few centuries. In that time, \nancient Israel did lose a lot of battles, but it also won a lot. It's \ndifficult to say how the modern state of Israel would compare, as it has \nexisted for only 65 years. However, you are correct in noting that the \nBible is unique among ancient national narratives, in that it details the \nfailures of her people, not just the successes.",

When Mexico relinquished its claims to the Southwest, the whole \nregion had a population that was definitely less than 200,000, the slight \nmajority being descended from Spanish settlers, about 20% of whom were \ndescended from the Moorish Muslim and Jewish converts to Catholicism hiding \nout to avoid the barbaric auto de fe. Contrast the development of Santa Fe \nuntil 1850 with that of Boston until 1850. Industry was almost non-existent \nthere compared to English colonies and they never developed beyond \nprimitive feudalism until the US cemented control over the territory. They \nhardly even had metal working, and by several accounts, had trouble shoeing \ntheir horses. The Spanish Empire was hungry for gold, but their \nconquistadors didn't even look much for it in California. By several \nmeasures, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan were more advanced than the Spanish \nsettlers in the Southwest. The truth is that the Spanish, in 300 years of \ntrying, had very little success colonizing the Southwest. \ufeff",

Although with Yellow I wasn't referring to all \npeople from Asia, just specifically to the human race that is called' \nYellow', which doesn't include many Asians (Semitics, Caucasians, etc); as \nyou said, the name doesn't reflect the actual colour of the skin (it \ndoesn't really with any human race) but it is a given name a 'race'. Other \nthan that Turks are white, so are Moroccans and Spaniards (the latter two \nare both massively Berber and Semitic amongst many other white ethnicities, \nso obviously they'll be closer to each other than to slavic). And I always \nthought that Jewish was a religion rather than a race/ Hebrew a subgroup of \nSemitic ethnicity (similar to Arabic). But I get your point. Race and mix \nraces can be understood with different standards and their distinction can \nquickly lead to discriminatory discourse.\n\nLastly, Hispanic.....racial terms used in the USA are probably as correct \nas their understanding of geography and knowledge of history... :P (i.e. \nthe use they make of the term 'Latin' )",

You could argue that people from \nLatin-America are of American race- as in indigenous from that continent- \nplus caucasian traits due to the colonization. But there is not such thing \nas the \"hispanic\" race.\nAlso being white, black and yellow is not a race per se, though it can be \none (but not the only) indicative of your race. This association of colour \nwith race basically comes down to the classical classification of people as \ncaucasoid (white), negroid (black) and mongoloid (asian). Of course there \nare fifty shades of any coulour within those races. Someone from Sweden \nancestry would normally be whiter than someone from Spain, but both are \ncaucasians. Also, within those anthropological distinctions you had plenty \nof subcategories that had to do with physiognomyamong other things. In \nfact, the term \"aryan\" which you seem scared to use is a legit term to \ndescribe almost the entire population of Europe and it has to do more with \nthe origins of the languages spoken there than with \"whiteness\". Forget how \nthe Nazis used the term to suit their own interests.And yes, Jews are also \nconsidered a race: they are a subcategory of caucasians, just like aryans, \ncalled the semitic race. This classification also takes into account the \norigins of the languages, and funnily enough Biblical history (Noah and his \nsons and whatever)\n\nIn conclusion, STEREOTYPES.",

Pretty sure over 90% of \npeople of European descent on this continent have no ancestors present \nduring the time when genocide happened. \n\nIndian reserve are where the natives could create their own laws and \ncontinue their own tradition. So they don't necessary have to speak Spanish \nor Portuguese like their Latin America cousins does. They have a choice of \nmoving into the city if they want to, if their choice is to stay in reserve \nthen let it be. Again, you're bringing up Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador but I have \nArgentina, Cuba, Chile, Haiti, and to some extend Brazil where European \nand/or Africans are majority. Racism in Latin America countries isn't \nalways better than in the US, but you know where media often focuses their \nattention on.\n\nAnd what can feeling sorry for the ancestor do anyway? It's practically \nnone of the descendant's business. And you have no idea who could you blame \nanyway, and it'll only get less relevant over time as more immigrants moved \nin, the harder you have to try to trace the ancestors of those who commit \ngenocide.",

Then \nexplain why Aboriginal Canadian constituted less than 5% of Canada's \npopulation even though historically they treated the natives better than \nanywhere else in the continent. \n\nThe majority of the modern population of Latin America countries isn't even \na \"pure\" natives. Look at Argentina for example, constituted mostly of \npeople of European descent. In fact there're more people of African and/or \nEuropean descent in Latin America countries than the natives. Being \n\"Hispanics\" or \"Latino\" isn't a race nor any indication that they're of \nindigenous descent.\n\nAnd whatever you're attempting to make me prove, you overlook one other \nfactor, immigration. It's not only about killing off natives, but how many \npeople from Old World immigrated to the continent. Even if no natives were \nkilled at all, if sufficiently large numbers of Old World immigrants moved \nin, the percentage of natives will decreased due to displacement.

Native populations \nin the Americas lacked immunities to common European diseases like \nsmallpox, measles, and mumps. \nMexican epidemiologist Rodolfo Acu\u00f1a-Soto, decided to reopen the \"smallpox\" \ninvestigation, which devastated the Aztecs. Some key pieces of \ninformation\u2014details that had been sitting, ignored, in the archives\u2014just \ndidn\u2019t add up. His studies of ancient documents revealed that the Aztecs \nwere familiar with smallpox, perhaps even before Cort\u00e9s arrived. They \ncalled it zahuatl. Spanish colonists wrote at the time that outbreaks of \nzahuatl occurred in 1520 and 1531 and, typical of smallpox, lasted about a \nyear. As many as 8 million people died from those outbreaks. But the \nepidemic that appeared in 1545, followed by another in 1576, seemed to be \nanother disease altogether. The Aztecs called those outbreaks by a separate \nname, cocolitzli. \u201cFor them, cocolitzli was something completely different \nand far more virulent,\u201d Acu\u00f1a-Soto says. \u201cCocolitzli brought incomparable \ndevastation that passed readily from one region to the next and killed \nquickly.\u201d",

Initially they would be enslaved pretty much the same way any \nother opposing people would be enslaved (POWs in the Mediterranean where \nforced to row ships until they died of exhaustion, this was done by \neveryone sailing this sea) and actually Hernan Cortez (famous destructor of \nthe Aztecs) actually allied with other tribes oppresed by the Aztecs and \nmarried a native, but after several authors started complaining about the \nconditions in which prisoners where treated and specially after the \nuprisings the conclusion was that of tolerance and respect to human \ndignity, even if it where just for the sake of efficiency. But the passing \nof laws against this didn't prevent it from happening (to a smaller scale) \nsimply because those who owned slaves considered that brutalizing them was \nmore productive and in order to justify themselves they stuck with the old \n\"they're not even human\" theory, even though it had been debunked (thus \nmaking it worse).\ufeff",
