Besides, why would they introduce her to Kristoff & have the \ntrolls sing that stupid \"Fixer-Upper\" song? Are we that dumbed down as a \nsociety to not see the foreshadowing?

                    "text": "+Sharon Wang I also found it predictable. There was no real villain so you \nknew it was going to be a character already introduced. Weasel was too \ncomical, Elsa was too innocent, and so that left a guy wanting to marry too \nquickly. Plus they introduced her to Kristoff. I could already see she was \ngonna end up with him way before the fixer-upper song. They rushed alot of \nthe plot. We don't get a chance to even see enough character development to \ncare about them. For instance, the parents were just a plot device so I \ncan't sympathize with their death. We're supposed to immediately accept a \ntroll adopting a little boy and A. Not get creeped out B. Not wonder where \nhis family is. I'm also supposed to believe that Elsa stayed in her room \nall those years and never interacted with Anna or anyone else. I'm then \nalso supposed to buy the fact that these trolls exist without any \nbackground as to who they are or why they're there and that the King & \nQueen know them personally. Yes, it's a fantasy movie but there should \nstill be layers and context to create a thread through the plot. Instead it \nresults in one jumbled mess that I'm force fed to swallow. Anna is the only \ncharacter I liked, everything else was just filler. No real dimension or \ndepth. Look at other Disney movies and you'll see the way those captured \nyou vs the way this one does. This one is well-liked bc it has some good \njokes and is stuffed to the brim with feel-good, back to back songs. But as \nan actual story, it leaves a lot to be desired imho.",

The Wind Rises was a more creative, romantic, thoughtful, \nimaginative, ~ I mean the list goes on ~ movie than Frozen. It had a better \nplot and though not everyone (especially kids) may be able to relate to it \ndue to cultural and historical reasons, it touched peoples' hearts about \nfollowing your dream, the right way to follow your dream, about sacrifice, \nfamily, and love. I find the Oscars' judgement and attention on the \nanimation category ridiculous. Animation isn't just about making it \nrelatable to kids. It goes way beyond that. It's about making a statement \nand though Frozen certainly make a statement, it incomparable to the \nstatement The Wind Rises made.\ufeff",
