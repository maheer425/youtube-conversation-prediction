From there it travels \neverywhere, brain included.\n\nThe brain have a treshold. when it's full it close the door. As soon as he \nis no full, he'll open the door. THC from the blood will be quietly waiting \nto get the open door for the brain.\n\nDuring that waiting time, he'll travel throught the body and will \neventually go to the kidney where it will be filtered and removed (to end \nin you bladder)\n\nSmoking a lot will make you as high as you can be for as long as your \nkidney will take to filter all the thc from your blood (usually 8 to 16 \nhours. in worse case after 24h all thc is removed.\n\nI like to say it's like a glider. When you smoke you quickly reach cruise \naltitude. From that moment, the only thing your join will do is maintain \nyou up there. You won't go higher but you won't get low until your body got \nrid of enough thc.\n\n\nAs for cookies, eat small pieces, every 10-15 min. so that you get a slow \nhigh that you can stop when you feel ok.\n\nI'd say that someone who don't smoke everyday should'nt take more than 0.3g \nper 60g of cookies. and no more than 1g per hours.\n\nI have to add that i tryed edible weed. I felt nothing and i thought it was \na waste of good stuff so i rather simply smoke or vaporize. I understand \nthe biology and how thc work but i have low poractical experiences.",

I took a hit watching cartoons....then watched as the picture on \nthe tv kind of \"flowed\" onto the floor.  Then I started freaking out, \nclosed my eyes, then opened them and looked up at the ceiling and the \npicture on the tv was now on the ceiling.  Thankfully it ended about 3 \nminutes later.  Having done LSD and Shrooms multiple times before that, I \nstill was not prepared for an actual hallucination.  \n\nI'm sure I will get \"Well you didn't take good acid or shrooms then\" but I \ncan assure you, I did.  I had plenty of closed eye visuals on LSD of the \ntype I \"saw\" on Salvia, but nothing has ever come close to that experience \nwhen it comes to open eye hallucinations.  ",

I appreciate your concern (even though you do \ncome across as a bit of an asshole in your last post).\n\nI think you are very wrong in assuming certain drugs have exactly the same \neffects in everyone. If you google \"depersonalisation marijuana\" read up on \na few experiences of other people. It may not have anything to do with you \nor your circle of friends, but realise there are a certain small percentage \nof people who get a really bad reaction. Just because someone has a bad \nreaction to coffee, are you going to judge them as having something wrong \nwith them?\n\nYou are right that i should cease to take recreational drugs. Even though I \nhave not had the negative effects of pot with even harder drugs. It does \nNOT mean that I am psychologically unstable - I am succesful in almost all \nfacets of life. Maybe i have a fear of losing control more than other \npeople. Does that  mean you should lock me up in a mental hospital?\n\nSo I still don't understand you point. Yes some people get really bad \npychological reactions to it and should stop taking it (like the \njournalist). Is it not OK to say: weed is not perfect for everyone? I think \nthats what the author was trying to say.\n\nI'm all for legalising weed, but i just want people to realise that weed \nain't perfect.

They are hallucinogens. \nIts not my fault your stupid.\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative\n\nWeed is not a hallucinogen or a psycadellic.

It shares it with a few \nother designed drugs that where made to imitate mdma. Wow I misspelled \nsomething...\n\nNo. Psycadellics do not fit empathogen because to be a psycadelluc you must \nhallucinate. You do not hallucinate on molly numbnuts.

If you don't \nhallucinate its not a psycadellic.\"\nOh my fucking god there's no way you're this retarded. FUCKING IDIOT; all \nhallucinogens make you hallucinate but not all drugs that make you \nhallucinate are hallucinogens. Just like not all weed is kush but all kush \nis weed. My point was you're acting like the only common effect \nhallucinogens have is hallucinations when that's not true at all they have \nMUCH more in common with each other than that. Hallucinations are possible \non many different types of drugs like dissacociatives but they're still not \nclassed as hallucinogens and you know why? Because HALLUCINOGENS bring \npeople to the same kind of understandings and behaviors as other \nhallucinogens do. LSD, Mushrooms, Peyote and weed can lead people to \nsimilar lifestyles (hippies) which is why they're classed together. They go \nwith each other and have a lot of similarities OTHER than hallucinations. \nSo there's more to hallucinogens than just hallucinating. And if you still \ndisagree with that then read what I just wrote again because you clearly \ndidn't pay attention the first time. \n\nAlso marijuana (cannabis) does have it's own class because it's unique but \nas I've said before that's not good enough for the scientists, they have to \ngroup it with a group that already exists and the group most similar is \nhallucinogens. MDMA doesn't deserve it's own, there's nothing special about \nit it's just like any other stimulant or weak psychedelic. It's just half \namphetamine half phenethylamine nothing unique. Also I think you mean \n\"empathogen\" however any real psychedelic would probably fit into that \ncategory even more so than marijuana. \n\nFace it people have hallucinated on marijuana, you can deny it all you want \nbut I don't see the point. It's not like it's a 'bad' thing, you just need \nto calm down. Tons and tons of people have claimed to have hallucinated at \nleast once off marijuana including myself and you're saying they are all \nlairs? What reason do we have to lie? Many of us also have experience with \nreal hallucinogens as well so we know what we're talking about. Also it's \nextremely strange to see you say you have \"never gotten paranoid off weed\". \nKind of makes me think if you're trolling or not  or if you've ever even \nsmoked weed before because that's extremely unlikely. I honestly can't say \nI've ever met someone who hasn't been paranoid at least once while stoned. \nEven the people I know who claim hallucinating on weed is impossible will \nadmit they've been paranoid before. Maybe you're just some kind of freak \nand weed effects you not the same way it does for all of us. Idk just you \nsaying that is really making me start to question your credibility here. ",

That's what its closest to.\n\nPersonally I think it should get its own definition, just like MDMA did... \nIts not proper to put it in any of the present ones...\n\nYes hallucinogen means you hallucinate.\n\nIt is propaganda. \n\nHow the fuck does it being a \"mild psycadellic\" (which its not) make it so \nsafe?!?!

Psychedelic means mind opening, all psychedelic drugs \nopen the mind to some extent or another. There are drugs out there that \nwill make you hallucinate but aren't classed as psychedelics because they \ndon't open the mind. \n\nWhy do you think hippies used pot and LSD and shrooms together? Because \nthey lead to a lot of the same hippie behaviors and ideas. Sure PCP will \nmake you trip out like LSD but you don't see a whole lot of hippies \nlighting up PCP because even though it will make you trip it's not \nenlightening and it doesn't lead to the same path of psychedelic peaceful \nhippie living. It doesn't destroy your ego either and though marijuana \ndoesn't destroy it either it can temporarily soften it. \n\nPoint is cannabis is technically in it's own class but in the scientific \ncommunity we technically have to group it in a class of drugs that already \nexists and that class is psychedelics/hallucinogens. It by far has most in \ncommon with them and again the term hallucinogen is very misleading because \nit doesn't necessarily mean hallucinations will occur. So in a sense I \nguess you could say the term 'hallucinogen' is propaganda therefore making \nthat whole class propaganda but it is not suddenly propaganda just because \nweed shows up. Cannabis is a mild psychedelic case closed. It's not \npropaganda, there's nothing wrong with it in fact it's a very good thing \nand is one of the many reasons cannabis is so safe. ",

Palin herself was dressed \nin the golden battle armor of the goddess, Athena and she held aloft the \ntrident of Poseidon\n\nShe soon called out, her voice like a mighty gathering of trumpets \"I am \nPalin, Empress of the Earth, behold my godly power!\"\n\nShe then pointed the trident forward and towards the earth and a terrible \nbright beam of light shot forth from it and struck the soil. And in a \nmighty poof, the earth became a giant bran muffin.\n\nThat's when I woke up... and took a shit.\n\nThat was also the last time I ate strange colorful mushrooms before bed.",
