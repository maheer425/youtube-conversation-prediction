Meat is all protein and fat, two very important \nthings for the body. Our body breaks down te protein into amino acids and \nmakes it's own proteins out of them. Fat is also needed. Last time I \nchecked very few fruits and vegetables have much protein or fat at all. \nGood nutrition comes from eating food from every food group, cutting out \nthe main source of protein and fat entirely is a terrible idea.

A bunch of \"cute\" boys get together and talk about \nnothing in front of a camera. And girls love them and watch all the videos \nONLY because they think the guys are cute.\n- Some makeup channels. Look at me, I'm rich and can afford everything I \nwant, watch me twirl in my new dress and act like a model!! Don't you with \nyou had MY LIFE? You can, just watch my videos! \n\nOh, and the YouTube mobile app is AWFUL at loading comments.\ufeff",

It's a lot easier to look at \nreplies at a comment, you can have an unlimited amount of text in your \ncomments, and you can post links. The only thing they really forgot to do \nwas to be allowed to like, dislike and reply to old comments. I also like \nthe website itself. I think the only reason why people hate Google+ is \nbecause of the new comment system.\n\nBroccoli: I love broccoli (and it's even in what I'm having for dinner \nright now lol) but I'm not the biggest fan of plain broccoli. It tastes \nmuch better with toppings.\n\nMondays: My opinion on that is mixed. It is bad with the fact that you have \nschool, and I have to go to bed early for three more nights. On weeknights, \nI can stay up until 11:00 P.M. but on weekends, I can up until 2:30 A.M. If \nyou have off school on Monday, it's much better.",

With any market place, there is supply \n(the YouTubers) and demand (we the audience). However, also with \nmarketplaces, there are institutional forces, like YouTube and Google \nthemselves, and, gasp, structural irregularities that can be manipulated \ninto more capital, in this case: views. Over time, this has led YouTube to \ngo from being a relatively free and open market to certain styles and \ntrends, like the awful Cinnamon Challenge, to becoming ubiquitous. \nUnionizing might be an effective way of counter-balancing the fact that \nYouTube itself is a microcosmic market dominated by a sole institution, \nGoogle, and lead to more variety. Anything to get us free from the \nincreasing blandness of YouTube content. Finally,@fksdlfj...whatever, \nYouTube isn't free. Ads, baby. That's how they monetized this.  ",
