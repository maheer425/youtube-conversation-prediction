Regardless it's NEVER a smart move to cut away muscle \nespecially when your nation's \"leader\" projects nothing but weakness making \nus out to be a paper tiger. Cutting our forces is cutting muscle. These \ncuts are indiscriminate and do not target any wasteful spending \nspecifically. If you want to trim the fat instead of cut out muscle, \nheavily monitor where the money goes and if it goes to a wasteful program, \nshut that program down that's cutting the fat. Food stamps, welfare and \nwasteful government programs need to be cut not our combat capacity. \nMonitor the entitlement spending and abruptly cut off the able-bodied and \nable-minded men and women that refuse to make an effort to look for a job \nand cut that fat from the programs. Replace the current tax code with a \nfair tax, a flat tax rate, the same percentage everyone must pay with no \nexception, disband the TSA and replace them with privatized security, the \nnew tax code would eliminate most of the IRS turning it into nothing more \nthan tax enforcement. These measures alone would make our deficit plummet \nbecause with the new tax code, more businesses hire more people who will be \nable to pay into taxes, increasing revenue and the fixed, constant tax rate \nwill encourage the rich to pull their money out of offshore banks and bring \nit here where it's needed and with the growing number of people going into \nemployment, more people get out of welfare and food stamps, causing more \ncuts to both programs.

You probably sat in Dhahran \nshuffling paperwork and packing ejector seat chutes.\n\nDon't give me no shit of what it was like to live in the military while we \nlived in quanset huts, squad bays, shitters with no doors, pissing 3 to a \npissing stall, tents, shelter halves, out in the cold Japanese winter \nslushy rain for weeks on end and in the rainy desert cold as hell at night \nand hot during the day. \n\nI doubt you did even half of that in your 20 (+) years.

Cheney being the Ex-CEO of Halliburton and who had made massive \nprofits from the first Iraq war Desert Storm. We all know now that they \nknew there were no WMD's in Iraq.

He's upset because the cash cow is about to be \nslaughtered. War for him and his kind is gold. They will start something \nsomewhere in the world to keep us in perpetual war.
