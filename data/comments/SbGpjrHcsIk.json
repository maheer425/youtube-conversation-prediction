She's also got a blog post on it here: \nhttp://www.howtocookthat.net/public_html/instagram-cake/\n\nI personally enjoyed the gelatin bits on account of my obsession with \ngummy.  It looks like she's actually making something in between my Basic \nGummy[1] and Opaque Gummy[2] recipes, so that should be interesting to try \nsometime as well.\n\nI subscribed to the channel and circled her G+ page after seeing this via +Lex \nLarson.  Hopefully will find time to check out some of her other vids as \nwell.  My other cake decorating peeps might want also to look further.\n\n\n[1] http://www.eat-the-evidence.com/gummy/basic-gummy-recipe-and-tutorial/\n\n[2] http://www.eat-the-evidence.com/gummy/opaque-gummy/\ufeff",
