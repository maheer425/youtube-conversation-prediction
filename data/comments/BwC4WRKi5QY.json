It felt great at \nfirst, but over time I began to develop increasing health problems, \nincluding agonizing abdominal pain of a mysterious origin, constant fatigue \nand depression, panic attacks, intense sugar cravings, even fainting \nspells. I was eating lots of veggies, fruit, tempeh, olive oil, beans, \nbrown rice, nuts, etc. While I admit that I could have done better about \nvitamin supplementation (of course might we not ask why this would be \nnecessary for a diet suggested as the ideal?) and that some people may do \nbetter on it than others, I can say from personal experience that I feel \nmuch healthier consuming a higher-fat omnivorous diet. Humans evolved \neating meat. There are no traditional vegetarian (let alone vegan) \nsocieties for a reason. I would rather take my chances with the diet that \nhumans have been following for 99% of their existence than trust some \ncooked studies funded by agribusiness.\n+ShadowSarah It's not just modern agriculture that destroys topsoil, but \nagriculture itself. When you deforest and then till the soil, there will be \nerosion. Traditionally, agricultural societies begin in the floodplains, \nwith their nutrient-rich alluvium deposits. As populations expanded, they \ngradually moved up the slopes of the valleys, worsening erosion and leading \nto desertification. This is why the soil of the historic centers of \ncivilization (Italy, Greece, Northern Africa, the Middle East, etc.) is \nmostly sand and rocks. The Epic of Gilgamesh, perhaps the oldest written \nstory, depicts Gilgamesh cutting down the great Cedar forests of Sumer in \ndefiance of the gods.\n\nAnd fiber slows digestion because it makes things *harder* to digest, and \nin the case of insoluble fiber cannot be digested or absorbed at all. \nExcessive insoluble fiber can bind to minerals, preventing their \nabsorption, and inhibit pancreatic enzyme production. If people ever have \nundigested food in their stool, it's most likely going to be a high-fiber \nplant food.",

Great idea we are already losing 35% of bee colonies due to our \ngreedy diets. 10 X more available protein than beef??? Guess what else is? \nVEGETABLE protein.. She is using SOOOO many statistics that she has \nhijacked from the plant based diet movement. If we removed eating animals \nfor flesh or fluid we would remove the SINGLE GREATEST polluting industry \non the planet and have us use crops that we feed to animals to get back the \nlost protein that is taken from eating animals that eat our crops. \n Its another sad day when we are using other sentient beings for another \nfad or trend instead of being honest and eating an EXTREMELY healthy \nvegetable plant based diet to THRIVE from..\ufeff",
