Well here is my theory. It is the \nonly zombie story I HAVE EVER SEEN that had people doing the math on how it \nspread.\n\n Just think about it. A newly turned zombie is a human without dexterity, \nintelligence or basic motor skills. The most dangerous part about an \noutbreak is the not knowing and not having dealt with any thing similar \nbefore and by the time they learn what they need to know it is to late. We \non the other (with all the zombie related entertainment media) hand live in \na time where you can ask the average 13year old and they can give a \nzombieland length zombie survival guide. So thats out the window. The only \nthing that actually makes them dangerous is the ability to catch people off \nguard and strength in numbers. Its safe to say that while some people will \nbe caught off guard,  billions of people won't be getting infected because \nthey aren't watching their step.\n\nAnd so if this is the case, how do you  spread this infection? Answer, You \ndon't. If visible spores and bites are the only way for it to spread than \nyou are left with the most curable epidemic in human history. For the first \ntime in the history of disease a dumbass redneck can help as much as the \ncdc. Also the",

The \nfungus then has to deal with non infected humans trying to kill it + \nthere's an ever adapting immune system and the fact that biting and spores \nis a terrible way to spread after the human populations \"adapts' and builds \nmassive walls to keep infected out.\n\nIf cordyceps was to infect humans it would most likely be in a completely \ndifferent method.\n\nfiy there a virus that rewires rat brains to seek out cats...half the \nhumans population is infected. It use us as a method of carry but high \nlevels of it can drive you insane :)",

Anyway this is indeed true but on \nthe flip side that's the thing one is created through a set process but \nwe're talking about fungus which is known to mutate and evolve to keep \nitself alive at all costs. Take for example the common fungus you can find \ngrowing in your yard, you can kill it with herbicide or just straight up \nrip it out of the ground but it will at the sign of any foreign harm \nrelease a spores that will take in said foreign anomoly and instead evolve \nwith it. So if it's ripped out of the ground it will evolve to be able to \ncarry itself better to plant somewhere else or evolve to grow on inorganic \nmaterial. With the herbicide it will evolve with the herbicide inside it so \nthat it will no longer be effective. That's just how fungi tend to work. So \nif they were taken out of their natural environment then it'd have to adapt \nto the newest host: dogs, cats, cattle, and yes humans.",

It isn't build to penetrate raw live meat and break bones \nas portrayed by every single Zombie or zombie like infections seen in \nmovies and video games. The common conception is the fact that u have to be \nbitten for the virus to spread, rather than a sneeze or a touch makes \nzombification even more difficult for it to spread when u look at it at a \nlogical basis. By the time it hits a million ,the government would have \nmore than enough time to wipe them out but they probably wouldn't need to \nas people themselves will probably take them out with ease.\n\nSo logically speaking. I would rather see a Zombie like pandemic than a new \ntype of super virus that can't be cured easily. The black death and the \nSpanish flu like pandemic are much more harder to fight when they are new. \nThose viruses have many ways to get into your body than a virus from an \ninfected Zombie. Another words, zombie's can be controlled with force and \nwith modern technologically advance weapons, that wont be hard. A pandemic \nof a super virus may spread with ease and kill millions to billions, \nsilently and ferociously. Logic always win when u think. Given the fact \nthat Zombie pandemic as we know it is almost impossible, when u still \ncompare it to realm of possibility then u can say its just noway near as \nthe most destructible virus. ",

What it means is that it's \npowerful, but easily broken. For HIV, it can only survive inside our bodies \nwhere it is warm, isn't too acidic, has a lot of host cells to replicate \nin. When exposed to even small environment changes - like our saliva where \nit is too acidic - it dies. Same with stomach acid and our entire gut. \nWayyy to hostile for it to survive, and also why it doesn't spread by \nsneezing or in the air, it's too weak. Blood and semen however, are an \nideal acidity which stays the same no matter what, have host cells, and is \nusually warm and quickly transferred (which is why it's so important to \nwear a condom). Basically, the butcher could only have gotten the precursor \nHIV (not the modern version we know, but like a prototype) by blood \ntransfer from an ape that he was chopping up for dinner; and yes, they did \neat chimps. It's a food source, plain and simple. They could have also been \nhunters who skinned it for the pelt.\n\nEither way, The blood simple trickled into an open wound, infused with his \nblood, and the HIV spread into it's first human host.",

Surviving isn't about strength, it's about tactics and \nwisdom. You may be strong having a machete against someone with a knife but \nif that someone with a knife is smart and has good tactics, you have a low \nchance of killing that someone. In the walking dead lee and clementine \ncovered themselves in zombie guts to get past the zombies, that kind of \nthing would help you survive, making a noise and attracting attention with \na gun will not. If I could choose between a rifle and a pistol I'd choose a \npistol because it's not as loud. If I had the choice of a machine gun and \nknife I would choose a knife. Strength doesn't always help you, wisdom \ndoes. A wise one would know when and where to use a gun and when and where \nto use stealth. What I'm saying is that you shouldn't always rely on your \nstrength.",

In a zombie apocalypse, the amount of \nfactors you haven't taken into account are MASSIVE. Firstly: The zombies \nthemselves. They have three things going for them: Huge numbers, being \ndifficult to kill and also they're absolutely terrifying. You might be \nconfronted with 50 zombies. So, first off, you won't be able to shoot them \nall before they reach you. Second, you'll be scared shitless, most likely. \nThird, assuming the typical zombie of today's pop culture, the only way to \ncompletely kill a zombie would be destroying the brain, so lots of accurate \nheadshots would be required, and since you're scared of the numbers, you \nmight not be able to shoot straight. Also, ammunition isn't infinite.\n\nMoving on from the zombies, you've got other humans. In a zombie \napocalypse, the biggest danger is not the zombies, but other humans trying \nto survive. They are MORE than happy with killing you to get access to \nsupplies, and they too will probably have weapon, which they will know how \nto use. Plus, some people have nerves of STEEL, man. They won't bat an eye \nas they shoot your head off so they can get that truck full of tinned food \nyou were grabbing.\n\nIn addition, in a zombie apocalypse, healthcare is not a thing. You will be \nunlikely to be able to properly treat serious injuries you get, and \ninfections would be high in number. On top of that, if you were to say, cut \nyour knee before you got into a fight with a horde of Zombies, the killing \ncould be your downfall. OK, so, you fight a dozen zombies with your cut \nknee. You blow one away. Then you shoot another one's legs out from under \nit, causing it to come at you in a slow crawl. Then, you blow away another. \nThe other 9 then get closer to you. You back away, but slowly, because \nyou're hampered by your badly cut knee. You shoot another zombie, and the \nbullet hits its head, causing a massive blood spray. Just a drop hits your \ncut knee and enters your bloodstream, and BAM! You're a zombie now.\n\nSo yeah. In a zombie apocalypse, NOBODY is likely to survive. Some are just \nmore likely to die than others.",

Sure, Hollywood zombies are \nthoroughly exaggerated for maximum entertainment, but like I posted \nearlier, something like it is not all that far from reality.

This is sort of like \nthe real and totally not made-up parasite that mind-controls infected rats \nto be attracted to cat urine in order to be eaten- as the parasite grows in \ncat brains. Or rabies, in which among other results of neurological damage, \nunnatural aggression is heightened and the virus spreads through biting- a \nresult of said aggression.

I'm not \nsure if you don't understand the definition of mutation and only attribute \nit to things like being able to control metal, shoot beams out of your \neyes, and such, but a mutation is any permanent change in an organism's \nDNA. This is how evolution works. No matter if you believe we evolved from \nsingle-celled organisms unquantifiable time periods ago, God created the \nuniverse in 7 days, or any other theory of the origin of life, it is \nundeniable that evolution through mutation occurs in all living organisms \n(and btw, last time i checked Fungi was one of the 6 kingdoms of life \nalongside animals, protizoa, chromista, bacteria, and plants (which are not \nthe same thing as fungi). An example is 2 parent deer with light brown fur \ngive birth to 3 fawns. Of these 3, 2 fawns have the same color fur as the \nparents, but 1, who we shall name Greg (Why, cause it's a cool name). The \ngene for fur color in Greg mutated, and any of Greg's offspring will have \nthat gene passed down to them, but that's only if Greg survives. If say \nGreg's color was a darker brown than the parents and they live in a heavily \nwooded forest, Greg would blend into woods better, and be less likely to \nattract the attention of predators than the rest of his family and \ntherefore have a better chance at survival. The opposite is also true \nthough, say Greg came out much lighter brown or even white. Due to Greg's \nnot so subtle color difference from the rest of the environment, he is \nunlikely to survive and therefore the gene doesn't get passed down. But \njust like the how mutation can be unpredictable, so can mother nature. What \nif, after Greg is born with much lighter colored fur than his parent's, an \nice age hits (Ridiculous yes, but not impossible. It's not like deer can \nmonitor world weather patterns and plan accordingly). Assuming Greg, his \nfamily, their food source, and the predators are able to survive the new \nclimate, then Grags new lighter color will give him a better chance at \nsurviving than the rest of his darker family. He will survive, reproduce \nand pass on his light color fur gene, giving his offspring better chances \nat surviving and breeding and passing it on again. The same can happen with \ncordyceps or any other disease. An offspring with a mutation that allows it \nto infect humans can be born at any time, and if during its lifetime it \ncomes in contact with a human, then it begins flourish and pass on that \ngene, eventually changing the disease all together.",

I don't know what you mean by \n'2012' or 'the day after tomorrow' since those were comedies. and this \nvideo regarding what happened in the last us could actually happen, is just \na viewer grab. he's saying that since diseases and viruses have mutated and \njumped from domestic animals to humans in the past, this fungus spread is \nhighly plausible; and that's total bull. Why? a fungus isn't a disease or \nvirus. it's a plant. it doesn't mutate and have the same nature as viruses \nand diseases because IT'S A FUNGUS, a plant, it does NOT mutate.\n\nNOW, if you actually do want to talk apocalypse, one is already coming \n(this might be what you you were hinting at by those disaster movies, but i \nconsider them to be a joke since they say this could happen in a couple \ndays but it will actually take generations). Ever since NASA went to space \nthey have been monitoring the earth through an infra red lens. the earth \nhas undoubtedly heated up in the past century. And if their future \nestimations are correct, in 150 years from now we will be looking at an \napocalypse. Desserts will exist where there are no desserts, cities will be \ncompletely submerged under water, deadly and chaotic weather, complete \nannihilation of species and famine and starvation covering the world, \nleading to world wars with limited nuclear warfare. It's already started, \nthe only scientists denying this are the ones in the oil companies pockets. \nThe desserts are already expanding, water levels are rising, some cities \nare sinking, species are already going extinct every day, natures temper \ntantrums are everywhere, and the world is quite literally running out of \nfood. in the next 2 to 3 generations, if nothing is done, it will reach a \npoint of no return; earth will become near uninhabitable in a few \ncenturies. it won't be nature or a fungus or a disease that wipes us out, \nbut our economy driven by greedy corporations buying out stupid government \nofficials leading apathetic citizens. We will destroy us, our own \nstupidity. And i don't know how old you are SNORLZ SNORLY, but if you're \nunder 30 you will reach a time of famine in your lifetime.    ",

However, it would also have to simultaneously \nundergo a mutation that involves a more effective response against the \nimmune system. Most macrophages wouldn't take too kindly to foreign \nobjects.  Such a mutation is possible and even plausible, but not likely.\n\nSo you are wrong, it does have a chance of happening, the probability is \njust incredibly low that the two most necessary mutations would appear in \nthe wild in tandem.  But if they did, the entire situation is completely \nplausible, since patient 0 would likely be taken to a hospital for seizure \nor rabies-like symptoms, or wouldn't go in and would manage to affect some \nother people.  That's assuming that such a fungus wouldn't target other \nmammals and propagate along them before first making contact with a human, \ncausing the new cordyceps to be widespread before we are even affected.",

Though \nI have gotten bit on the tongue a time or two, which really smarts and is \nas bad as eating a really hot pepper but only on the tip of your tongue.   \nBut hey if I had a cow, I would not eat it, I would only have a female and \nI would milk it.  I don't really want to kill a big milk producer if I can \nhelp it.   The ant hills I don't kill off, I just sort of harvest ants for \na tasty snack.  Sounds odd, but if you are out in the wild humans can eat \nalmost everything a Bear does.\n\nThe idea of the pandemic was written about by a lot for people, even me.  I \nkilled off all but the last two people on earth.  then didn't end the story \nbut on a cliffhanger where the guy was slipping off the edge of the \nbuilding and the girl was not within reach of him,  the end.   the twists \nthat make you think.

Ya, that William Shatner. Who knew he was such a knowledgeable \nwriter on the topic of having sex with lower primates, and proper etiquette \nduring your ape-love sessions. Did you know that it was proper to bow \nbefore your ape-partner before pummeling their bum-hole? Neither did I.\n\nAnd just remember, if mother nature didn't want us making love with \nmonkeys, then why did she make them so damn sexy? Answer that, doubters!\n\nA word of advice though, avoid the baboons with the red, raw, hairless, \ndroopy butts. They are more trouble then they are worth.\n\nAll you need to enter into this world of delights, is an extremely \nhyper-active sex drive, a very strong stomach, and a rather poor sense of \nsmell.\n\nGood luck, y'all.",

                    "text": "+Zee Nooo Untrue. What are you, a noob? Do you eat only white bread? Of \ncourse you don't. And monkey sex does not have to be your only sexual \nencounters. Some nights, can be for the human ladies, and some can be \nmonkey-sex nights. Which are nice because you don't have to shower, apply \ncologne, worry about garlic breath, dressing well, or pretty much anything \nthat will be an issue on human-sex nights. A good strategy is to alternate. \nYou can have monkey-sex on Monday, human on Tuesday, ect. Another method is \nkeeping the monkey-sex nights on weekdays, since you can't get them into \nclubs, bars, or restaurants. Save those activities for human partners on \nthe weekends. Both are wonderful, and you don't have to sacrifice one for \nthe other. But beware, habits can unintentionally cross over into the wrong \nnight. Once, I bit my human partner in the crotch very hard, not fully \nrealizing it was human night until she was screaming. Opps. My bad. But on \nmonkey nights, that sort of behavior is very much appreciated. Also, I \nlearned that flinging a goodly amount of excrement prior to making love is \na good bonding exercise. But, it only takes hitting your human date in the \nface once or twice with your poop...before you learn to think twice before \nyou fling poo. Oh, and forcing your partners face between your butt cheeks \nis also another activity which should be reserved for monkey-nights. What \nelse? I can't think of more at the moment, but there are many lessons which \nmust be learned. Keep an open mind, follow the guidelines, and you too can \ncan enjoy the rewarding, exhilarating, and romantic benefits of \ndual-species interaction. Plus, it's good for both the ozone, global \nwarming, and a reduced carbon footprint. Monkey sex is not only fun and \nprofitable, but it's sustainable, green, saves whales, and helps children \nwith learning disabilities. It's a win/win for pretty much everyone.",

                    "text": "All you said was very true.\n\nBUT the idea is still plausible. Honestly, with global warming, it is \nincreasing the amount of wild animals that are sick because of parasitic \nbased disease. Ticks, chiggers, mosquitoes, (those are based in malaria) \nand fleas are thriving in the warming climate. These bugs are great \ncarriers for diseases and viruses, and there are plenty of them. Just as an \nexample of what the parasites are doing, moose are dying out. They are \nbeing eaten alive by ticks. (Not saying that there will be zombie moose \nroaming around, though it's interesting and freaky thought.) Global warming \nis also helping diseases and viruses grow and change. Swine-flu and \nNile-virus for example. Rabies could be next on the evolution list.\n\nHere's another thought about how the infection could spread. Think about \ndensely packed cities, India's major cities* for example. Very packed, \nlarge quantities of animals around. If someone got bit by an animal at \nwork, that person could get infected and then attack a crowd that he/she is \nin. A few people get hurt(cuts or scraps) and they don't think much about \ngetting sick from the person who attacked them because they're already \npissed at him/her. Not knowing they got hurt, process repeats. 1 to 5 to 25 \nto 125 to 625 to 3,125 to 15,625 etc. (assuming each person attacks 5 \npeople) It would be underground for a few days, until a very large quantity \nare infected. Then BOOM! The virus is nearly impossible to control because \n100 of thousands have it. (Seems a bit ridiculous to myself... But still \npossible.) This could be similar to the Black Plague. \n\n* I don't have anything against India, just an example.\n\nBack to the neural functions. \n\nThe human brain doesn't even need to be \"possessed\" and lose it's control \nand neural function. The realistic zombie apocalypse is just people that \nare overly violent, aggressive, infected, and have dropped down to primal \nanimalistic behavior. They are very sick. So sick that they are only doing \nwhat the brains is telling the body to do and un-able to make choices. The \nperson doesn't even need to eat its prey, it only needs to attack to spread \nthe disease. I admit, I don't know what exactly the rabies virus does to \nthe brain to, I guess, control the animal/person, but if the viruses \npurpose is to spread, it will make itself spread.\n\n\n",

Not to mention, that it \nwould be contained fairly easily if a virus were to spread that way. The \nonly thing that comes close to a zombie like virus in nature is rabies. And \ncases of rabies are rare. It is far more probable that a flue like disease \nwould decimate our population though.",

(Although I have read your response in \nEnglish it says \"Translate\" below your post...)\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video... \n\n\"This is the method I use to manage fear. It has helped me in life or death \nsituations. I hope it helps you.\nIt is possible overcome fear when facing real physical danger, and there \nare some very compelling reasons to learn how, but it's not easy. Having \nthe right philosophical scaffolding can help, but in the end it will always \nbe up to you.\n\nLet's begin with a reality check This planet is, and has always been a \ndangerous place.\n\nThe adrenaline you feel when standing on the edge of a cliff, or when you \nrealize that you almost just stepped on a poisonous snake, or when you \nfinally come to terms with the fact that the government you live under has \nbecome a militarized police state... that feeling is there for a reason.\n\nFear is our physical body recoiling at the prospect of annihilation. Fear \nis a biochemical alarm system which helps keep organisms on this planet \nalive by triggering a fight, flight or freeze response. If the attacker can \nbe defeated, fight, if you can outrun it run, if you can't beat it or out \nrun it freeze and play dead.\n\nThis alarm system has persisted in the gene pool and will continue to \npersist because in many life or death situations it is highly effective. \nFear, however, is a double edged sword.\n\nPanic can send a herd of buffalo stampeding over a cliff, and it can make a \ncrowd of humans behave in much the same way. If you need evidence of this, \njust take a cursory glance at the pages of history, or better yet, take a \ncloser look at current events.\n\nFear doesn't make you smarter. In fact studies have shown that terror \nliterally shuts down the rational and logical parts of our brains.\n\nNow it's obviously not a good idea to face dangerous situations, or to make \nimportant decisions with the most useful parts of our brains turned off, \nbut consider the implications of having an entire human society operating \nat this level.\n\nTrouble is, the ruling classes have always understood that it is in their \ninterest keep the peasants in a perpetual state of fear and insecurity. \nThose who are able to dictate the nightmares of a nation, usually end up \ndictating everything else.\n\nThe stakes are higher than our emotional well being.\n\nThe ability to control our fear and reduce or eliminate its hold on the \nmind is what allows us to take INTELLIGENT action in the face of danger. \nHaving full use of one's brain also helps to distinguish between real and \nimagined threats. This skill is often referred to as courage.\n\nCourage doesn't just happen randomly. A man doesn't just get up one day and \nperform a triple twisting flip off of a cliff out of the blue. Chances are \nhis heart was pounding like crazy the first time he stood at the edge of \nthe high dive when he was a kid. The primary difference between an expert \ncliff diver, and someone who passes their whole life paralyzed by their \nfear of heights, is that one of them made themselves jump, and kept doing \nso until it became second nature.\n\nYou might gather from this example that the way to defeat one's fear is to \nface it. This is true on one level. If you are afraid of snakes, and you \nhandle them long enough, the fear will subside. The same principle applies \nto most individual fears. Trouble is, fear is like a multi-headed hydra. \nCut off one head and another can grow up to take its place. Furthermore, it \nis often not practical or even possible for us to overcome each little \nphobia and worry through direct exposure. For example it would be foolish \nto attempt to confront one's fear of a dangerous disease like Ebola by \ncontracting it.\n\nTo overcome fear in a long term, sustainable way, you have to go to the \nroot.\n\nBut what is the root of fear?\n\nThe root of all fear, even seemingly petty and insignificant fear is, \ndeath. Social anxiety for example can be traced to the primal need to be \nwell integrated into one's family and tribe. Being rejected by one's peers \nwas a death sentence in ancient times, and still is today in some \nsocieties. This primitive legacy leaves most humans unable to resist the \nforces of social conformity and authority.\n\nBeing unconscious of the root, makes the irrational byproducts impossible \nto process.\n\n\n \nThis underlying fear of death is the body of the hydra. Facing it \neffectively is the key to freedom.\n\nWe all live under the shadow of annihilation, whether we consciously \nacknowledge it or not. You are going to die. I am going to die. In three \nhundred years every single one of us will be dust. No one leaves this place \nalive, and there is no getting around that reality (though some convince \nthemselves otherwise).\n\nDo you find that thought disturbing? Does it fill you with dread and \ndespair? Whatever you do don't look away. Hidden within that discomfort is \nthe secret of life.\n\nYou see death is the ultimate councilor. It is the ultimate point of \nreference.\n\nWill this thing that you are afraid of matter in three hundred years? In \nmost cases you'll find that the answer is no.\n\nRegardless of how dire your situation may seem, no matter how serious your \npersonal problems may be death will erase them for you someday. Once you \nfully integrate this reality, you'll find that it is a relief. Just a short \ninternal glance at one's tombstone can be used to release those surface \nlevel fears. Take a deep breath, let it go, and do what needs to be done.\n\nWe are dust in the wind.\n\nThere is absolutely no sense in poisoning the precious little time that we \nhave with inner turmoil. You're going to die no matter what, so you might \nas well look your death in the eye and smile like a kid who's been caught \nwith their hand in the cookie jar, but eats the cookie anyway.\n\nBut what if the answer is yes? What if this issue that's keeping you up at \nnight WILL matter in three hundred years? Well, what would you do about it \nif you weren't afraid? What would you do if you knew you only had a year \nleft to live? Answer that question and you have found your mission in life. \nYou have found something bigger than yourself. Something worth dying for is \nworth living for.\n\nAre you are afraid of walking your path? Then take another look at your \ngrave.\n\nIronically confronting your death can also help you avoid it. Those who \nhave accepted the inevitable actually have a tactical advantage over those \nwho are terrified of it. Courage is a wild card which can turn the tables \nagainst impossible odds. (300) A small group of highly motivated, fearless \nindividuals can accomplish far more than an army of cowardly and obedient \nsheep.\n\nRemember, we can negotiate the time table to some infinitesimally small \ndegree, but no matter what we do our lifespans are short like sparks on \ntheir one fleeting trajectory of existence.\n\nYou want to really live?

It is unavoidable.\n\nIt has been said that today is the first day of the rest of your life. That \nis not true on the day that you die.\n\nWhen you come to grips with that fact and are able to laugh at it in the \nface of it then you will realize an absolute freedom from any fears that \nyou have.\n\nSo why don't you concentrate on living with what time that you have been \ngifted with, to the fullest, instead of worrying about death, an event \nwhich you are powerless to prevent?",

Jetplanes \nhave been flying towards Sweden (Stockholm), flying very close to the \nground, and there have also been reports of near collisions. There have \neven been two jetplanes and a bomb plane flying towards Norway (I live in \nNorway, so I know this). So who knows? Russia is a big country and pretty \npowerful, and it looks like they are looking for trouble. You can also tell \nwith other things happening around the world, that there will probably be \nanother world war in near future or later in the future. I mean, if you \nlook at what Russia is already doing, messing with Sweden and Norway.. then \nthere is North Korea and shit. So yeah, there is a bigger chance humans are \ngoing to wipe out mankind. And if there will ever be another world war, \ndon't worry... I don't think it's going to be the same as in WW1 and WW2. \nI'm sure nearly every country in the world with Nuclear Bombs and things \nlike that, is just going to use that..
