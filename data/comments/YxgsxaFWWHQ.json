You attack a fictional fantasy story that has nothing to do with \ninequality in any form (especially since eowyn, a woman, kills one of the \nmost powerful and dreadful enemies in the story, the witch king [a man] \nthrough virtue of simply being a brave woman)\n\n2. By viewing your profile pic, I'd say you could pass for a cave troll in \nthe movies. Did you play the troll in the mines of moria in the fellowship \nof the ring? I can see the resemblence\ufeff",

Of course, he \nmeant Sauron when he said this, but I think this holds true for Melkor as \nwell.  The parallels between Melkor and Lucifer are obvious, but I strongly \ndeny allegations that Tolkien intended a Christian allegory by this.  It's \nsimply a storytelling necessity when you have a benevolent god and you wind \nup with a world full of suffering - at some point you've gotta write a \nrebellious angel or demigod into the story.\ufeff",

Another reason is that it's \"power efficient\" a lot of Melkors power \ngoes into creating minions of evil and that's why he at the end of \nsilmarillon only hides in Angbad since he has drained alot of his power, \nthe trolls were molded from rock btw.

No. Eru is not purely good which is shown by the fact that Melkor even \nexists, since he's a child of Eru's mind. Thus is Melkors work not really \nblasphemous against Eru but rather against Eru's intentions for Arda, kinda \n(?).\n2. Everything evil is not only something good which has been twisted.

It was not necessary to include the origin of orcs \ninto it but Christopher thought it to be important to at least somehow \naddress it. Therefore he took the version that contradicted the least the \nother parts of the Silmarillion he had decided to choose.\n\nHowever, even still the way the published Silmarillion alludes to the \norigin of orcs is indirect, and says that the wise of Eressea think it to \nbe true that orcs were originally elves.\n\nBut like I said, there is no finished and \"real\" version of the \nSilmarillion in existence, since Tolkien wrote many parts of it again and \nagain. Tolkien actually decided later, that the Silmarillion is a \ncollection of legends compiled during the Third Age by Men, not by Elves.",

Of course, I watched the LotR movies first, but it was \nlong before I really got into the world.\n\nI strongly believe reading The Silmarillion first gives meaning to the \nother works. There are so many references to the older days in both the \nHobbit but especially LotR, that you won't understand otherwise. You'll \njust wonder who the hell they're talking about. Also, The Silmarillion is \nnot very long. It's basically a long summary of everything that's happened, \nwithout going into detail in anything. It's kind of like an index.\n\nAfter The Silmarillion, I think you should read the big works \nchronologically, meaning start with The Hobbit then LotR. Watching them \nafterwards is also a good idea, especially The Hobbit as there are many \ndifferences between the book and the films. When watching LotR, do make \nsure to get the extended editions. Otherwise you will swear at the TV at \nall the things that are cut out from the book. Even in the extended \nedition, there are many things missing, such as the beginning with Tom \nBombadil.\n\nAfter you've done this, you should then dig deeper into the Unfinished \nTales and Children of H\u00farin. I've not read the former yet, but I'm halfway \nthrough the latter. The Children of H\u00farin is basically a chapter from \nSilmarillion told in depth in the same way The Hobbit and LotR are told. \nAlso, The Children of H\u00farin is the first of the books I've read in English, \nwhereas I've read the other in my native tongue, Danish. It's so much \nbetter in English. The way Tolkien writes reminds me of a modern \nShakespeare.\n\nAlso, The Silmarillion is the best of them, since it gives so much more \ninformation that any of the other. It also makes you wonder more about the \nplot in The Hobbit and especially LotR. For instance, why did the Valar \nsend the Istari to help against Sauron and not Tulkas? He loves war and \nbattles, but they don't want him to beat up Sauron singlehandedly? It \ndoesn't make sense to me, but I guess having a superhuman character run up \nto Murder, give Sauron his ring and defeat him 1v1 in hand-to-hand combat \nwouldn't make for an epic story.",

Think about how much it took for them \nto embark on the war of wrath, after all. I also think the Valar knew \nsomewhat of the potential for men to turn wicked. Certainly Elves could \nalso do this, but I get the impression that it was more probable for men to \nturn their hearts, as their lives are shorter and they're in a way \ninherently less wise as a result.\nAs for men being unable to enter Valinor, that was because Valinor itself \ngranted immortality to all that was there, right? It wasn't called the \nundying land for no reason. If Eru himself wanted men to have this gift \ncalled death then obviously they couldn't be permitted to enter(at least en \nmasse, and not anyone), and Manwe understood this.\n\nI'm not so sure- when Ainur enter in the picture it's hard to say. \nObviously when Eru created Arda, at least I think, he created for the \nchildren, even though he permitted Ainur to descend into it. Eventually the \nValar at least realized this, and I think that's the main reason why they \nstopped interfering so much- why they allowed Morgoth to do as much as he \ndid. They wanted the rightful heirs of Arda to overcome the issues \nthemselves(which obviously they couldn't do). The Valar did of course \nintervene. I think if men had been unable to anything to Sauron, regardless \nof if he made the ring, help eventually would have been sent. Once the \ninfluence of the Ainur is truly gone, then men are left to their fate, and \ninstead of the Ainur messing around within the song, they can watch it \nunfold without direct action. I also think that Frodo destroyed the ring, \neven though Gandalf assisted him plays an extremely important role in all \nof this. It ultimately wasn't an Istari who defeated Sauron in combat or \ndestroyed the ring- it was one of the children. After this I think it was \nespecially evident to the Valar that the children's time is now- though \nthey did assist, it was a child who completed the deed. It'd be like if \nsome hero of men delivered the final crippling blow against Morgoth in the \nwar of wrath. Even though the Valar cleared the way and smote Thangorodrim, \nit still would have been a man who defeated Morgoth- and that would've \nmeant a ton.",

Elves go to the halls of Mandos \nwhen slain, but as for where men go nobody save Eru knows. It's also \nheavily implied that Eru called death the special gift to men(if he didn't \nsay it outright, which I think he did), which is to say their fate is \nbeyond the world's. Elves die with the world, whereas men would somehow \ntrudge onward.\n\nAlso, if the elves truly were favored, then they wouldn't have gradually \nleft Middle-earth. The world is given over to men to control, but the elves \njust leave.\nElves only seem to be favored if you consider death to be outright bad- \nwhich isn't the point in this case because of the unknowns associated with \nit, which imo is one of the more interesting aspects of Tolkien's \nlegendarium.",

                    "text": "+DuBaas007\nMost Tom Bombadil theories have one or more of the following problems:\n1. They make Tom too strong (he would fall to Sauron with the Ring, so he's \ngot a clear limit, and he's definitely not Eru).\n2. They make him too weak (he's not mortal, nor does the Ring affect him \nlike it does the Maia)\n3. They don't account for Goldberry, when any decent explanation would \nexplain both of them.\n\nI've also heard that he's the Witch King, which is interesting, but not \nsomething I buy into at all. And I've read a somewhat tongue-in-cheek \nargument that he's actually some eldritch dark lord waiting for the others \nto take out Sauron for him so he can move in. And I've heard that it's Aul\u00eb \nand Yavanna, that he's some unnamed Maia, that it's Manw\u00eb, Eru, or just \nsome unknown nature spirit (usually parallels to Ungoliant- whom is also \none of the legendarium's big mysteries- are brought up in these cases).\n\nMy favorite theory is that he's the embodiment of the Flame Imperishable, \nlike a Holy Spirit-esque being. It meshes well with the Catholic influence \nwe already know about. It doesn't explain Goldberry, though, and that's a \nproblem... some kind of nymph? A Maia? *shrug*\n\nI find it extremely unlikely that he's weaker than or equal to a Maia in \nstrength, considering his relationship with the Ring.\n\nI once heard that Tolkien implied that he did have an actual idea of what \nTom was, but simply chose not to reveal it. So in theory there is a \n\"potentially canon\" explanation for him that we'll just never know about. I \nfind that both very cool and very frustrating at the same time.\n\nAlong with the Entwives and Ungoliant, it's just one of those things we're \ngoing to have to accept not ever knowing about.",

Known to the Elves as Iarwain Ben-Adar, \nto the Dwarves as Forn, to Men as Orald, he displays many of the \ncharacteristics of the Ainur, and many theorize he is one of the lesser \nAinur, ie., the Maia (of which kind are also Gandalf, Saruman, and \nSauron).  But since other Maia are vulnerable to the seduction of the Ring \n(witness Saruman's fall) and Bombadil clearly is not (witness his casual \ndisinterest in FotR), it seems unlikely he is a Maia.  Is he a Vala then?  \nWell, Tolkien clearly enumerates the Valar and seems to imply that there \nare none unaccounted for.  Is he Eru?  Tolkien went on the record and \nexplicitly rejected that.\n\nSo, we can fairly confidently say Bombadil is not Eru, not Vala, not Maia, \nand not mortal.  So what the heck is he??!\n\nThe best guess is probably that Bombadil is some sort of Earth- or \nnature-spirit who was created along with the plants and animals, during the \nMusic of the Ainur and before the First Day.  He is likely a result of the \noriginal, uncorrupted music (ie., before Melkor's revolt).  He is not of \nthe Ainur but neither is he mortal; this combination of traits would \nexplain both his immunity to the Ring as well as his relative indifference \nto the struggles between the Free People and the Dark Lord.",

But as he was about to smite them he was moved by their pleas \nfor pity, spared them, and bestowed the gift of independence on them.

He did it so secretly even his wife Yavanna \ndid not know.\n\nEru asked Aule why he did what he did and why he wasn't content with the \ncoming of Elves and Men, and in shame Aule raised his hammer to destroy the \nDwarven fathers (and mothers) but to his surprise they recoiled and begged \nhim not to destroy them. Eru had indeed granted Dwarves sentience and a \nplace as his 'adopted' Children- but warned Aule that strife will come \nbetween the natural and the adopted. Eru also made Aule lay the Fathers and \nmothers (apart from Durin, who lay alone) in tombs of stone under the \nmountains until the Elves awoke but before Men awoke.\n\nOddly enough this also led to the creation of the Eagles and Ents- Yavanna \nfound out what Aule was up to and complained that he should have told her, \nsince now in addition to the Elves and Men the Dwarves will likely damage \nher forests with no pity as they do not know Yavanna's work. She complained \nto the boss of the Valar, Manwe (sort of their big bro) and he listened for \nthe will of Eru (which was communicated directly to his mind) and came to a \ndecision; he would be granted the use of Eagles to patrol the mountains and \nforests  while among the trees the Ents would walk.",

Add to this the balrogs killed \nfighting for Melkor, and I assume some kind of death is possible. Is this \njust a loss of a physical form - ie did Gandalf the Grey die and then his \nspirit be granted a new form, or was he preserved from death (which would \nthen imply death was possible)...

However, many of those Ainur that descended into \nArda wanted to have dealings with the Children of Il\u00favatar (Elves, Men and \nalso Dwarves), and therefore it was easier if they had a body of sorts. In \nmany cases it was some kind of \"vestment\" that reflected their personality, \nbut some took actual physical bodies. However, such a process used some of \nthe inherent power of Ainu-spirit in question. Morgoth took it to extremes \nand tried to control the entire matter of world and therefore he was \nactually inherently weaker in the end of the First Age than Sauron was, but \nhad enormous control and domination over the physical world.\n\nIn a sense, when Ainu took a physical body, he became in a sense \"an \nincarnate\" like Elves and Men (that is, body-soul-composite, person that \nhas both body and spirit instead of just spirit). That made them vulnerable \nand \"mortal\", since death is separation of soul from body and body is not \ninvulnerable.\n\nWhen the Istari are sent to Middle-earth, they must take physical bodies \nfor themselves in order to relate better to peoples of Middle-earth with \ntheir weaknesses, problems and pains. That made them also \"mortal\".\n\nSauron also took physical body, and lost it at least three times. Every \ntime he lost some of his original power. First time he lost his body in the \ndestruction of N\u00famenor, and he lost his ability to assume fair form. He \ntook new body relatively quickly, but was \"killed\" again by Gil-galad and \nElendil. It took much longer for him to assume new body, but he was able to \ndo so, because the Ring into which he had poured much of his original power \nstill existed. When the Ring was destroyed he lost his power to maintain \nhis physical body and was killed again. He was not able to assume another \nbody again and became a spirit that could not affect the physical world \nanymore.",

When I thought the Order consisted \nof White, Gray, Brown, Blue and Red, I could imagine the Blue and Red \nWizards were just as distinctive as the others, just in some other part of \nthe world.\n\nNow I get the impression that Blue was just the color Tolkien assigned to \n\"filler\" wizards when he realized he had described the Wizards as an \n\"order\", but needed to establish the existence of at least two more for \nthat to really make sense. \n\n\n\n ",

Panentheism is his prime initial use describing \nthe void outside of Eru initial creator of reality that we can enjoy as his \ncreation and his creations' creations to come.  The great spider Ungoliant \ncame from the void, it did not come from the \"divinity\" of Eru Illivater. \n The void is present distinctly from Eru the divine being who is filling it \nwith creation of his.  \nPanentheism is better to describe Tolkien's fantasy certainly not \nmonotheistic where creation comes from only one divine being who needs no \nassistance from any other, as this type of divinity is paradoxically \neverywhere all the time and knows everything and is without mistakes and \nalso controls the void as well as everything else, which Eru doesn't.  \nHenotheism describes better the way in which all the Valar, demi-gods and \nminor angle like demi gods come into the world.  The creations of the earth \ncalled Arda are made by his demi gods, not by Eru. Eru seems to delight in \nseeing what others would do or add to his creations making his creations by \nthemselves not perfect or desirable on their own.  He reserves spots for \nhis workings and lets them do essentially anything else.  And since the \ncreatures and sentient creatures may worship the Valar as gods, Henotheism \nfits this description.  Valar are worshiped as gods and create as gods with \nvery little guidance from Eru.  Roman pantheon mythology followed similar \nlines as Tolkien:  Initially Gaea and Chaos are from nowhere one divine the \nother the void have union to make creation. Gaea and Chaos and in one myth \nEros god of love are primordial gods.  They gave birth to Uranus \noriginally, then Uranus and Gaea give birth to the Titans which created \nmore to the world. Then Uranus gets overthrown by a Titan Cronus, Gaea and \nand Cronus give birth to the Olympic gods which gave birth to more stuff \nand won dominion over the world from their prior creators the Titans. \n Henotheism is strongly used, a little panentheism is being used as its \nokay to worship any of the Olympic gods including their defeated \npredossesors the Titans such as Saturn during Saturnalia; Saturn or Cronus \nbeing the father of Zeus and many of the Olympic gods.",
