As His creation, humans were also created for His praise but \nuniquely blessed with the role of partner in creation. Humans unlike other \ncreations were made in likeness to the created but not to over rule or \nusurp but to partner for the joy that comes in unity/harmony. Though humans \nchose to pursue independence instead of partnership and therefore lost the \nsource of all knowledge, the creator himself. Humans can only see and \nunderstand in part until we are restored in relationship with our creator. \nThe math was always there. We just can't figure it all out without God.\ufeff",

It all \nstarts with a very simple equation (like 1+1 equals 2, and so on), and from \nthat we take ground to develope a further description of \"WHAT IF...\" (for \nexample 2^2). Then, if we just jump over all the other similar formulas, \nand want to create a definition of a new thought, we either mess up these \nnumbers a little more, or (if it is very difficult) we make up a whole new \nweird combination of letters and numbers to show that this theory is named \n\"THIS\".\n\nNow, my conclusion, math and formulas and ecuations are just thoughts \ndefined by names. The formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is just a name we have given, \nand the answer is not REALLY  and physically c^2, because there is no \nnatural answer. There is only a definiton so we all can communicate and be \nunderstood when living our every day lives, because math (in all its glory) \nwill always be in the world around us. It's simply a language, and just \nlike languages, it was created and, even though not in the same way, it was \nshaped.\ufeff",

For instance, 1+1=2 because 2 is defined to equal 1+1. \nMeanwhile, many properties of math, are discovered, such as 2+2=4, because \n4 is not defined as 2+2, but 1+1+1+1. To bring that to a more \"real\" \ndiscovery (since 2+2=4 was probably discovered pretty much instantly upon \nthe creation of math), the billionth decimal of pi was discovered using the \nset and invented rules, rather than settled upon by someone who decided it. \nAs for the tree question at the end, I would suggest this: The number \nexists if there is someone to uphold the definition of it (a human or an \nalien or a computer or whatever). It does not apply to the trees, however, \nnor do the trees exist. I don't mean that in a \"are those trees really \nreal?\" kind of way, but they are just quarks and gluons and whatnot that \nare in places. There's one. Here's one. They all exist independently, and \nalthough they affect each other, they share no \"treeiness\". However, the \nway they are ordered is likely to result in others being ordered the same \nway, and they are held together by some force (electromagnetic?), and thus \nhumans see them as parts of larger objects of a category, and in this case \nthat category is trees.\ufeff",

The good, the bad, the scientists, the \narchitects, the dictators. We can only imagine (and I refer here to John \nLennon) a world with no religion. How would this world look like? \n\nReligion had a strong influence on all people, no doubt, but so did honey. \nOr alcohol. Or pet dogs and cats. Or vegetables. Or other people. Or books, \nIf I may name a better\nand less ironic example. Should any influence be mentioned? \n\nPerhaps I could make the context of my personal disapproval of God being \nmentioned in an educational video even clearer. I come from a country where \nreligion is being pushed into education, science and has a growing \ninfluence in the government. It is forced down the throats of my fellow \ncitizens by the mass media, by the priests and by the creationist governors.\n\nI am all for the freedom of religion. But as long as one keeps his religion \nto himself and we can live in a peaceful and secular world of science and \nreason. And when it comes to technology, education and development (those \nthings that TED stands for), I can see more of a negative influence of \nreligion, rather than a positive one, no matter how much I try. \n\nConsider those science books that have been banned by the inquisition \nduring history. The books that have been burned. The libraries that have \nbeen burned. The free thinkers thathave been burned. Was that an influence \nof religion? Or perhaps this led to an artificial lack of influence that \ncould have otherwise brought up more scientists and educated men. \n\nWe know a lot of dark facts about the dark ages and the religious wars \nwaged at those times that have never stopped and continue up to this very \nday. In some countries people are killed for having the wrong religion or \nhaving no religion at all. Or they are killed for having a different sexual \norientation, because a holy book says that is a sin against God. Or they \nare killed or sent to prison for drawing or saying something that some \nreligious people do not approve. Or for art that some religious people do \nnot like. Must I name these countries or do we all understand what I am \ntalking about?\n\nSome of these countries are somehow at good diplomatic terms with other \npowerful countries that claim to be secular. Possibly one that you live in. \nBecause we are thought to respectall religions. We are thought that \nreligions are important and good influences, not a source of prejudice, \ndiscrimination and violence. So when I see that something as irrational and \ndangerous as religion becomes entangled with beautiful and wondrous science \nin an educational video I can't help to feel as if someone drew a swastika \non a painting by Isaac Levitan.",

They \nhave done nothing for our scientific advancement. What they do is they brag \nabout \"how important philosophy is\" but bring nothing of importance to the \ntable.

Mathematics are \nuseful in Technology and in planing experiments.However, in physics and \nchemistry things constantly move and change faster than determined \nmathematically, so new measurements may show multiple possibilities. There \nare 8 basic numbers, describing Spectrum of Colors that make White, but \nthere are many more Octets on Energy Level of Grays. Dark Spectrum also \nhave an Octet. Because an Electronic Outer Shell can only hold 8 Electrons \nmaximum to be full as Stable Matter Element, there ere 8 possible Photons \nto be Emitted, giving those 8 Colors.
