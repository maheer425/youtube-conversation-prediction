Basically a smear campaign to ban Marijuana was ran \nby William Randolp Hearst in the 1930s to protect his interest in the \ntimber industry. Because hemp had a multitude of uses and was poised to \nreplace wood as a inexpensive alternative to paper. Naturally the timber \nindustry felt threatened and attempted to illegalize it in which they \nsucceeded. As a result the timber industry thrived lacking any competition. \nSpreading inaccurate propaganda that Marijuana was an incredibly harmful \ndrug. Albeit the fact it has failed to provide substantial evidence in any \ndeaths related to Marijuana (if not rare). In fact it has quite a few \nmedical uses. Like wise alchohol corporations benefit from millions of \ndollars a year despite the staggering amount of deaths it inflicts. An \nestimated 3.3 million people die a year worldwide as a result of alcohol \nrelated incidents. To conclude the thought that alcohol is legal in the \nplace Marijuana is absolutely stunning.",

But I'd like to make some corrections.\nI'm not condoning/supporting bestiality, but you're a dumbass, not Connor. \nPlease research before calling people dumbasses.\n\nContrary to popular belief, *zoophilia* and *bestiality* are *NOT* the same \nthing, although they are similar.\n\nBestiality is outright fucking an animal because you want to, aka animal \nrape.\n\nZoophilia is when the animal is fine with it, so to speak. Let give \nexamples, since this doesn't sound like it makes very much sense.\n\nKeep in mind this sounds really fucked up, because sex with animals is \nfucked up - bear with me though.\n\nYou get your dog to lick your dick. It walks away because it doesn't want \nto, obviously. You pull it toward your dick and make it. Bestiality.\n\nThe dog, either out of curiosity or its own desire, licks your dick because \nit\ndecides to. Zoophilia.\n\nI'll also use the popular example of peanut butter on your privates to get \nyour dog to lick it. This could be either bestiality or zoophilia, \ndepending on your own views. The dog simply wants the peanut butter, but it \ndoesn't really know what it's doing.\nYou're not FORCING it to lick your testicles (dear god) so technically it's \nzoophilia but could be seen as bestiality since the dog is ignorant to \nwhat's going on.",
