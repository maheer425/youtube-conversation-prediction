Nowhere in my comments \nhave I said it's a true representation or even what I think, or what a lot \nof people think. But of course, your \"racist\" or \"bigot\" alarm was \ntriggered because someone said something that made you feel uncomfortable.\n\nFor the record, the label I give dumb Americans is they're violent and \nanti-science. And again, like when talking about Jewish people, it is not \nall of them, but it is a representation of how the world sees them. Why? \nLook at the news. Read a newspaper. Read comments on these comment boards. \nYou will see why people have that perception. It doesn't matter that some \nof the smartest people on the planet are Americans (Lawrence Krauss and \nNeil DeGrass Tyson being two that come to mind immediately).\n\nMany of the ones that don't fall into those seemingly blanket statements \nremain too quiet and in doing so, silently approve of the actions that \ncause people to have that world view..\n\nI personally find it funny how some people can't see why many  people don't \nlike the Jewish people sometimes. Like previously mentioned, 2.5 billion \npeople think that the Jews killed their messiah. For over 3000 years, \ncalling themselves \"the chosen people\" or \"God's chosen people\" suggests \nsuperiority to everyone else.  That sort of rubs people the wrong way.\n\nMe, I don't care. There is no god so there is no \"god's chosen ones\". There \nwas no messiah, so not a big deal to me either. To me, I just find it \namusing when someone, or a group, think they're being hated by everyone \nalways think the problem is everyone else. That was the point of my \noriginal comment. It wasn't some racial comment intended to say that \"Jew \nare bad, mmmmkay!\"  It was simply to point out that maybe, before any of us \npoint the fingers at others for how we are treated, perhaps we should look \nat ourselves first and maybe work on our personality and delivery before we \ntry to force everyone else to accept our bullshit as acceptable behavior \nand actions.  That was it.\n\nMother Teresa was a horrible person. Gandhi was a racist. Not everything is \nalways as it appears.",

As they stated, they named this city a thousand \nyears ago and after that no one gave it a second thought, which is normal \nbecause many words have lost the original meaning or they have simply lost \nmeaning, like in this case.\n\nIt was very cmmon that city names as well as surnames would be invented \nbased on what someone did as a profession. Killing Jews was one of those \nthings and the same happened a few centuries later with the Moors and now \nthe surname ''Matamoros'' (Moor killer) is very common not only in Spain \nbut also Latin America. Now if you ask anyone what they think about a name \nthat says Moor killer, they will be surprised because they haven't \nconsidered the surname to have a meaning.\ufeff",

As a concept the term \nwas coined precisely to make the argument for the creation of a jewish \nstate.\nAnd your argument is fascinating for the giant, yawning chasm of a blind \nspot you clearly choose to ignore. You're correct that the jews have been \n\"persecuted\" everywhere they've gone, all over the world, by different \npeoples from different cultures and religions for thousands of years. On \nthis we agree. But to attribute those agreed upon historical facts to a \npsychotic \"irrational hatred of jews\" (the definition of \"antisemitism\" \nsince a rational hatred implies there's a REASON for it) shared by all \nthose disparate peoples from disparate backgrounds spanning millennia, when \nthey share few other psychological afflictions, instead of attributing it, \nquite logically to the one common denominator: THE JEWS, is what is truly \nabsurd and insulting to the intelligent. There is no such thing as \n\"antisemitism\". There is racism, xenophobia, nationalism, racial supremacy \nand cultural chauvinism, but no special irrational hatred of one little \ntribe.\nIncidentally, the reason jews have been unable to live peacefully among any \nof the cultures who ALWAYS have started out allowing the jews to live, work \nand flourish among them, always to this very day, is precisely due to \nracial supremacy and cultural chauvinism: that of the jews and their deeply \ningrained concept of election or \"chosen-ness\".",

If you aren't shocked \nby those figures YOU SHOULD BE.\n\nThere is no inherent reason why anyone brought up in a Muslim background \nshould be any less intelligent or capable than someone brought up with a \nJewish background.
