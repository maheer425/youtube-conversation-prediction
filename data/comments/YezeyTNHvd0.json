                    "text": "+RawrSaysOlivia\n Man I'm sorry to burst your bubble but I used to study at a Korean \nuniversity (Seoul National) and lived in Seoul and Korean people are \ncompletely aware that K-pop and drama are fantasies, to a much larger \ndegree than foreigners. In fact, many people are aware that a lot of \nwesterners idolize Korean society because of music videos etc and some few \nexploit it. In the night district of both Gangnam and Hongdae I've run into \nboy groups of really sweet-looking, handsome Korean guys that have \nspecialized in seducing foreign girls who come to Korea because of their \nlove for K-pop and dramas, and will act sweet and impersonate people from \ndramas in order to seduce them. Then, once they get to sleep with you, \nthey'll dump you and add you to their list (and high-five their pals and \nbrag about it to the foreign guys they meet in the bars (\"oh, you're from x \ncountry? I slept with a girl from there y weeks ago!\")). Furthermore, as \nKorean pop and dramas are an expression of, the pressure for good looks is \nEXTREME in South Korea and there are certain areas of Seoul (esp around \nInsa-dong) that are just CLUSTERED with plastic surgery clinics. The subway \nstations too have all kinds of advertisements for plastic surgery, and \npeople who are considered unattractive in Korean society are regularily \nharassed for this. Examples I've encountered are 1. meeting a group of \nfriends of a friend and them apologizing that the girls who are there are \nugly, while they stare embarrased into the table and 2. hearing my foreign \nfriend get told she's \"too fat to get a boyfriend\" constantly when she \nexpresses that she wants to meet someone. In other words, if you're \nunattractive don't expect Korean guys to be sweet. They'll probably tell \nyou directly to your face that you're not.\n\nNow Koreans are a lot of fun and are cool to be with (their frankness is at \nfirst very intimidating but they make for excellent close friends), and \nSeoul is a magnificent city if you go there with the right mindset. But \nidolizing Korean society and Korean guys because of what you see in music \nvideos and dramas is a dangerous way to think cause it makes you a) look \ndown on your own local guys who might not be that bad at all once you look \npast certain flaws that you think Koreans don't have because b) you think \nKoreans are perfect beings and are unable to see flaws in their characters \nas well. Koreans are just people too, and the chances are if you're coming \nto Korea you'll find a lot of Korean guys are more interested in Korean \ngirls or PC Bang, and if they are interested in you then there's quite a \nchance they're playboys looking for their next target. I've studied at a \nJapanese university too, and I must say it's comparable to the western guys \ncoming to Japan because of the Japanese adult videos they've watched that \nhave given them unrealistic expectations of what Japanese girls are like. \nI've met some white guys in Tokyo who think it's realistic they'll get to \nhave sex with schoolgirls in public toilet because they're white and \nJapanese girls what to do it with foreigners anywhere, anytime. say whaaat\n\nNot to shit talk Korea, though, cause it'll have a heart in my place \nforever as one of the countries I lived in for an extended period of time \n(a bit more than 1 year). But going to Seoul knowing that it's a HUGE \nmetropolitan with both good and bad sides that has a lot to offer in \nentertainment and culture is a much better mindset than thinking it's a \nfairytale-city where guys will give you teddy bears and roses in the hope \nof getting to kiss your cheek. That's a fantasy. It's not going to happen.",
