He did not commit \nthis fallacy as he stated that the flaws in Marx's theories lead to abuse. \n Even if you disagree with that assessment, it's enough to get him off the \nhook from the slippery slope fallacy.  \n\nAd Hominid - An attack on the person rather then the argument.  The \nbeginning half of that statement doesn't attack your person hood, just your \nlack of evidence.  Although, the final \"are you easy?\" statement is an Ad \nHominid.\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantiam - Shifting the burden of proof.

You're speaking like it was a hypothetical thing, that US \nexperimenting with for the first time in human history. There are many \ncountries (most of them actually) where this is illegal already. I'm not \nguessing on what will happen, I'm talking from the experience (for example \nin my country). Making it illegal is a good step and obvious one, but it is \nnot THE solution. Death penalty won't stop people from murdering. Reality \ndoesn't work like this. As well as 20 years prison won't stop other \npoliticians to be corrupted. That's fairly naive. \n\nFurther more, you think that \"multi party\" system won't help, because it \nwon't stop politicians to be bought of. But I'm not disputing that. But \nbribing is not that easy. By having two fixed parties, you only have to \nbribe some much people and then you're done. You know that no other party \nwill appear and you can't allocate much more money, because there's less \nrisk. If on the other hand you had parties changing constantly because if \nthe old ones were found to be bribed, then these corporations has much \nharder work. In combination with bribery being illegal, you might easily \ntry to bribe a new politician, that will not only refuse the bribe, but \nwill cooperate with police. So the risks are suddenly higher, and also \nthere's flux of many people, and new (\"unreadable\") parties. Not only \ncorporations have to do much more effort, but the failure rate will be \nhigher. \n\nIn the end imagine this. If, for example GOP politician - after bribery \n(money in politics) is deemed illegal - will be caught, the party will only \nexchange him. You'll never get a chance to remove whole party. Thus they \nhave time over decades to devise the mechanisms for invisible bribery. They \nwill always tell you, that that one politician was rotten apple, but the \nparty stands strong. And you will believe, because it's not like you have \nanother party to vote for. In our country, the parties are in fear of \nbecoming obsolete, and this fear keeps them trying to be the best party. \nIt's a free market competition. In the US, there are only two fat \nmonopolizing parties, that have price agreements (cartel), and the voters \nare fucked. Enjoy.",

The problem is right there, in front of your fucking face, but you \nchoose to ignore the empirical nature of the argument and try to choke it \naway by trying to eliminate the medium in which the problem is caused. \nYeah, it's like arguing that we shouldn't have tax because too much tax \nmoney is being redistributed towards programs we might not like. Instead of \nvying for reform that will change the people making the decisions or simply \nreallocating where the spending goes, you want to eliminate the spending \nitself by cutting off ALL the money that might go into it.

When a giant bank \nlike BoA approaches him and offers to help him allocate $5 billion dollars \nwith plenty of upside his decision to accept is based on sound business \nprinciples and nothing else.

I would have all \nkinds of cash to invest in starting a company or sending my daughter to a \nbetter school. I don't care how much money the rich have I just want to \nkeep more of my own money. \n\nThere are sociopaths but sociopaths are created, as far as I have read, \nsociopathy is not genetic in almost all cases but is actually bred from \nchildhood trauma. Better parenting could reduce the amount of sociopaths \nfairly quickly. If we got rid of the government, whatever that would or \ncould mean, we would linking ourselves with conceptual organizations like \nDispute Resolutions Organizations. There are a lot of entrepreneurs ready \nto take the place should government loosen its grip. DRO's unlike the \ngovernment focus on violence prevention, at least I wouldn't pay for one \nthat wasn't other wise we'd just end up with a shitty reactionary police \nsystem like we have. Competing DROs would show us who is doing a better job \nat violence prevention by offering lower costs to people who take domestic \nabuse classes which is one of top calls officers get on the job. Like auto \ninsurance if you take defensive. These companies would have to address our \nfears as well like you mentioned what if sociopaths try to take over again, \nwell we would be paying a portion of our insurance to go towards just that. \nIf a group tried to take over it would be in all the armed DROs best \ninterest to knock down any attempt a take over. Now its theoretical I know \nbut the people waiting to start these business models are not. the biggest \npart of it is the volunteerism. I can't choose to pay taxes when I don't \nlike what the government does but I still have to pay them and they don't \nlearn because all they have to do is win an election. A private company has \nto respond to cash flow every day. If a DRO had an officer that lets say... \nshot an unarmed citizen there would be outrage an many people would leave \nthat DRO and find another or at least demand he be fired and he most likely \nwould be but again if you don't like the decision you go somewhere else and \npeople respond to money lets face it. Again if that was the government they \nstill and will always get your money lesson learned or not. I guess I just \ndisagree that we would not be able to set up something up that would be \nable to stand up to someone forming a new government.

We don't need to wait on \napproval to think or promote these things. This is how the Tea Party became \nto being. There was no leader.

Yes the same globalisation \nthe has a negative influence on salaries, but a positive influence on what \nwe can buy for the same money. \n2) Much of the crash is as a result of government intervention, it was a \ngovernment push to get more poor people into the housing market which \ntriggered the housing bubble. At the very least its the governments \nresponsibility to make sure that that bad loans don't put the national \neconomy at risk.\n3) The worst thing about this whole push for housing for the poor was that \npeople were duped into believing houses are investments, they are not. \nHouses do not generate any revenue. The poor that under clinton were duped \ninto buying houses would have been much better of spending that money \nelsewhere like a small business, gambling, booze, hookers. Instead they \npaid of the mortgage for 10 years and ended up nothing but a Fuck You and a \nboarded up house. \n\nSo Clintons push for the American dream... somehow is the fault of \nCorporations,  (note right now we have exactly the same thing in the UK, \nAustralia and China, in all 3 cases the government is heavily involved in \nbuilding the housing bubble. When it finally does crash it will be the \nfault of corporations.

The primary reason I used 1999 is because that's when gas prices \nwere important to me, as that is when I was actually driving.  Its called \npersonal experience.\n\nThe point is, I see essential services becoming more expensive, while only \ntechnology and optional entertainment-based services dropping in price.  \nThis means, things are easier for those who CAN afford it.  What about \nthose who can't?\n\nMore personal experience.  I work my ass off, in jobs that not only require \nexperience, but set skills that take years to acquire, yet still hover \nright on the edge of minimum wage, for my full-time job.  And for an \nadditional 50 cents, I would load three times as much responsibility on my \nshoulders (which I have seen how stressful it has been, and continues to \nbe, to others).  The backbone of the company, driving all sales that come \nfrom our location, STILL cannot have a liveable wage.\n\nIs this fair?  Is this \"paying people what they're worth\"?  The ladder to \nsuccess is missing its rungs, and we're left with nothing to climb, while \nMORE is piled onto our shoulders in increasingly demanding jobs that don't \ngive you anything more for the greater amount of work you do.  And I see \nthis same exact story over and over and over.\n\nNobody is asking that you pay no-skill jobs that require no experience more \nthan minimum.  We are asking that you take into account what experience you \nrequire, what skills you require, what the job entails, how demanding that \njob is, and differentiate between someone who is working hard and someone \nwho is half-assing it.

I understand the \nfallouts of crony capitalism as much as you do, but where we differ is \nwhere the answers lie. You say government is the answer, and I say it is \nthe problem. The only way these \"corporations\" could exist, is the fact \nthat the government has allowed them legislatively to exist. You ignore \nStalins seizure of the Ukrainian food supply. Did corporations do this? No. \nYou ignore the thousands of political prisoners put into gulags. Did \ncapitalism do this? No. You ignore the fact that the only reasons China had \na massive uplifting of living standards after the creation of free market \nzones and the production of goods and services. Did communism bring this \nsuccess? No. Who buys all of the condos in West Vancouver you ask? It's \npeople from Hong Kong and China, who have profited from Capitalism. Where \nwould you rather live? North or South Korea? One is a shining light and the \nother is as dark as space.\n\nI find it funny that you blame the starving people in Africa on corporatism \nwhen it is quite obvious that the people there have not seen the true \nembrace of the free market. Imperialism is one thing and the free market is \nanother. When the laws are created to enslave peoples under a corporations \nrule, this is not the free market, this is fascism.\n\nI find it quite funny that you bring up production and World War II, \nbecause it is quite obvious that after that \"central planning\" created a \n\"explosion\" in productivity, in the long run people have lost their living \nstandards, rights and freedoms by ten fold. Today we have nothing compared \nto what we had before the central banks were established. This is what \neconomists call a \"bubble\". When you print money and inject it into the \neconomy it creates false positive, therefore giving a false indicative of \nwealth, which will fool the masses into thinking that Keynesian economics \nis our saviour, however it is really our own personal satan.\n\nIf you follow the booms and busts in the last 100 years, you will come to \nrealize that every rescission comes after a good session quantitative \neasing, or stimulus. This degrades the soundness of the currency and the \nwider and wider gap between rich and poor. This is a large conclusive \nevidential fact that puts central planning into the philosophic grave. This \nis why 50 states were created, to decentralize the power, because \ncentralized power leads to an empire, and this has been proven over and \nover in history.\n\nAgain back to the disparities in the third world. India, China and South \nAmerica - benefiting to something we call Capitalism. The only thing that \nwill stop these peoples living standards from going up is the fretful \nideologies in which we call Communism or Socialism or even Fascism (Crony \nCapitalism) - which is a rather clever idea to introduce if you have a \nsecret need to conqueror the world with apparent good intentions. The road \nto hell is paved with those good intentions. I think it is clearly obvious \nthat we have on our hands a group of people funding communism because it \nfeeds on peoples intrinsic moral compasses, which can be exploited to the \nuse of sophisticated tyrants. Diversity, Equality and social justice are \nall good things, but the solutions are cotton candy filled with poison. \nCommunism along with Keynesian central economic ideas are in no doubt \nidealogical ploys introduced by the elite class to destroy democracy and \nfreedom and to persuade the masses to accept their adherence of the elite \nclass while feeling they are morally doing the right thing at the same \ntime.

People are calling you out, just accept you're wrong \nand if you care that strongly, go do some library learning.  Money exists \nin a system, an economy. When you have a company, they aren't held in any \nregion, which means they can sell their products in one place and produce \nin another. \n\nThis is how cheap textile products are made, by paying .10c a day to some \nworker in Asia and selling for a %3000 markup in North America.   In this \ncase workers are getting paid less while artificially elevated inflation \npushes prices higher as companies get greedier.  The difference with \nhousehold income is people have dependents, it's how humans exist, with \nfamilies.  No one should be 'poor' , especially not in an industrialized \n1st world country, the whole 'you got to work hard to get what you need' is \nbullshit, and saying that it isn't, is pure fantasy. \n\nThe means of production, technology, has offered a fair life for all, \nhowever the economic system is skewed in the mega-rich/corporate favor, and \nthey pay/buy governments to keep it that way.  Meanwhile greed is \nunstoppable, so they push and push and push without thinking (like the \ncommon trait of republicans).  \n\nThe biggest problem with people like you is you do not think.  If something \ndisagrees with making sure you get yours, then you make shit up.  Like \nreligion, my politics are open to what works to have a healthy life without \ndogmatic bullshit.  Having people fighting to survive makes things worse \nfor everyone, and eventually ramps up to rich people's heads on sticks.   \nIt's far more democratic for everyone to be somewhat at the same level, \neducationally and financially, so the whole society can prosper.   \n\nThe only people who would 'suffer' are the rich who simply have a disease \ncalled greed.
