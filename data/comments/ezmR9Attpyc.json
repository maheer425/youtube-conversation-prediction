                "text": "I've spent my life searching, so please listen. \n\nYing-Yang indicates the dual nature of reality. All creation must have a \nbeginning and an end, rise and fall, birth and rebirth and movement and \nstop. Much like a light and sound waves can not exist without ups and \ndowns. They all imply a change and a change is what causes an experience, a \nreality. \n\nIf reality did not change at all, there would be no experience.  All \ncreations are transient, as birth implies death itself. What must have \nbeginning, must have an end the very nature of creation. \n\nIt is the self that experiences the changes, meaning the world indeed does \nnot exist without an observer or a witness. Hence the importance of an \nobserver in studying sub atomic particles (quantum mechanics). \n\nNow if we connect to Buddha's teaching and ancient philosophies like \nAdvaita, the true self, the nature of you is not dual, it is not relative \nor subjective. The true self is absolute, timeless, changeless and \nformless. That self can not be described by words or concepts created by \nthe mind. \n\nIt is the changeless background among which changes (yin yang) are \nperceived. In which creation is perceived for all creation are transient \nand are constantly changing. \nThe real self however never was born and never will die. It is an \nmanifested absolute void of emptiness that is open for all. Unity occurs \nwhen 2 consciousness see themselves as one, known as love. It is to see \nyourself in others and in all.  Greed and fear occurs when one views \nthemselves as separate. \n\nThe only right way to meditate is completely empty your mind and be the \nwitness of all perception. Let them come and go, rise and fall, ying yang, \nbut do not cling on to them. Our very clinging and resistance is what \ncauses suffering. This is led by desire, so desire is indeed the root cause \nof not only creation but suffering. \ufeff",

It is, and yet it is not. \nIt is there as long as I want to see it and take part in it. When I cease \ncaring, it dissolves. It has no cause and serves no purpose. It just \nhappens when we are absent-minded. It appears exactly as it looks, but \nthere is no depth in it, nor meaning. Only the onlooker is real, call him \nSelf or Atma. To the Self, the world is but a colourful show, which he \nenjoys as long as it lasts and forgets when it is over. Whatever happens on \nthe stage makes him shudder in terror or roll with laughter, yet all the \ntime he is aware that it is but a show. Without desire or fear, he enjoys \nit, as it happens.. \"\n~I Am That",

We can only see the changes, we \nsee a property and its opposite, but the reality doesn't actually has \nconcepts, it is what it is. We judge things with properties like \ndark/light, tall/short, big/small, but the REALITY is these things are just \nwhat they are. I think it's very arrogant and self centered to view the \nworld as an external thing and the \"true self\" as the absolute, unchanging \nthing.

Then I took the \nlaughing gas hit and then I hit my head on the floor and look forward into \nthe couch and look through is and as I was looking further through it I was \nlike, so what it's just a fucking couch, where is the meaning of life? So I \nkept looking deeper through the couch and went through the earth and into \nspace with all the stars around and said, so what it's just stupid space \nwith stars everywhere, where is the meaning of life god? why you not \nanswering my question? the I kept going further through space but still \nthere just was more space and more start. Then I went extremely fast \nthrough space and finally went somewhere where there was no space, and then \nI just was there and said, so what now? And then something small happened \nand everything became so very clear. But the problem is that after I woke \nup from this trip, I had to try to recall what I saw and it was difficult \nto remember, and over several days I was trying to remember what I saw that \nwas so clear. And after a few day I think I figured out what I saw on that \ntrip, it was the fact that when there is absolutely nothing, then there is \nno meaning, but when there is two opposite sides like left and right, then \nthere is a meaning to life. But the thing is that it's everywhere, I walk \non a street and see that anything that exists has a contrast to it, it is \nthe opposite, like girl and buy kinda. Like black and white, and like real \nis contrast to unreal, and nothing is contrast to something, and so on, it \ngoes on and on. Even though this whole experience is wacky tobaccy, it \nstill makes a lot of sense to me, I feel there is a deep fundamental \nmeaning in it somehow, maybe an answer from god, and I don't even believe \nin god.

                "text": "As a child of 8 or 9 I became fascinated with the teachings of Christ. Probably specifically His Love. Real Love, which transcends all, which heals.<br /><br />As I grew into adulthood I observed that people used the various dogma and doctrine of their paths to separate us, argue, fight, even to the degree of causing wars and killing. There&#39;s something wrong with that.<br /><br />The Taoists say that to try and describe the Tao is to not know the Tao. I think that to worship a person and miss the message they taught / teach is insane, and that&#39;s what religion seems to accomplish. I would rather not be associated with anything and yet accomplish Being the Love that Christ taught. What you believe isn&#39;t as relevant as what you live. If True peace and Love are not in it, you&#39;re in alignment to create disharmony.<br /><br />Peace is a reflection of Love. If you fail to Love and be an expression of that harmony, then it matters not what your doctrine or dogma say. If you disbelieve in anything called Devine, but live Love, Honor and Respect, you live a purpose for which we all should strive.<br /><br />It is better to seek to understand than to be understood.<br /><br />So I ask you to ask yourself, what are your intentions when you claim a belief system?",

Also it doesnt go \nnegative so its still not truly infinite (yes, there are more kinds of \ninfinity)\n-and the planck length is the smallest length theorized, and? What is your \npoint with bringing these numbers up?\n-also no, nanotechnology will not go below ~1 angstrom, there are simply no \nmolecules to nanostructure at that scale.\n-who advanced spiritually? Well I suppose you already have some sort of \nevidence for this being possible, right? Because there is no mention of a \nspirit in any of the sciences that exist. Time travel is physically \npossible, the laws of physics allow for it, however a spirit would break \nthermodynamics lol\n-so you say that if you end up believing so much in something you unlock \nsome other thing? Can you not see how stupid that is? I dont suppose you \nhave any evidence of this even being possible...\n-of course you have no idea, of course you are philosophical, as I said, it \ndoesnt really bring any technological advancements, its just what ifs, \nwhile science is \"what is\".\n\n+yaocong low\n-if matter and antimatter were balanced we wouldnt exist, its because of \nthem not being in balance that we are here now and why we mostly see matter\n-your whole second paragraph is a big ad hominem, congratulations, you did *absolutely \nnothing to refute my points*. You're pretty new at this, aren't you?",

I totally agree with you, but I think you're \nmissing a very important factor, which I thought you would bring up since \nyou kind of talked about it.\nAll life exists because it survived, that is the basic concept of \nevolution. And so we talk about \"we're here and we might as well do the \nmost with it.\", but what exactly is the \"most\"?\nWell it's obviously to be the best, to achieve the greatest good. The \nproblem I'm talking about, is that we define what's good based on that \ninitial principle, survival. We think that by surviving \"better\" and \nachieving greater quality of life we are becoming better, but it's all \nreally based on our own instincts of survival. That sense of progress is \nonly a result of evolution, since it proved to be such a great tool for \nsurviving.\n\nMy question is, if we know that we only want to make progress and achieve \nour highest potential as a society because of instincts which come from \nevolution, why should we make it our goal? Why is it so important?\n\nAt the end, we are just forwarding what we've seen in nature since the \nbeginning of humanity, in a very similar sense to a religious person \nfollowing what their parents teach them.\n\nSo what is our real purpose?

Everything \nabout us has evolved over millions of years to ensure our continued \nexistence.\n\nWe are made out of the same things that make up the rest of the universe, \nyet most of what is around us is does not have the power of perception. \nIt's all listlessly floating compounds.

We humans are particularly good at stuff \nlike that and more. We're always finding ways to survive better, and maybe \nsomeday we'll be among the big leagues. Maybe we'll start the big leagues. \nThat's pretty dang neat for just a couple lumps of space stuff.\n\nSo no, there may not be any predestined final Ragnarok, nor an intricate, \ncalculated plan, but we're here and we might as well do the most with it. \nMake a name for ourselves, see whats out there, because what else is there \nto do but keepin' our groove on?",

Instead I was conclude with this statement. \nWhy isn't there more people like you or Kevin x to teach the world, or \nbetter yet, America that they need or \"NEED\" with big quote fingers to stop \nusing the played out curse words. I mean seriously, it's been used so many \ntimes, I don't even find it threatening anymore. It's basically boring to \nme. And stop being racist to their own people. Last time I checked, British \npeople have more respect for their own indigenous Africans than most \nAmericans. I mean, seriously, the Africans that's been living here for so \nlong, they've already entered into most American DNA. Not to mention their \npopulation numbers been so large on the charts, I can't even consider them \nto be minorities anymore, comparing to American Whites. And I mean, pure \nuncrossed gene-ed with any other nationalities, American Whites. It's so \ncommonly used, people literally use them as jokes, my African American \nfriends even laughs at it, and it's only offensive when you desperately \ntried to convince them you're arrogant as (bleep), who thinks he's hot \n(bleep), and thinks everyone is a lesser man than you. Believe me I've \ntried, and I had my shares payback. Also fags? Really? Fags? I have friends \nthat are gay, but I will literally do what ever it takes to stay out of \ntheir love life, since I adore girls. And if you call me that, well, let's \njust say, that is the whole reason why I rather have a girlfriend. People \nuse it so much that I'll bet you the future of gay marriage the word \"fag\" \nwill become a compliment in the future. Another thing, being sexist to \ngirls are making girls more and more hostile and aggressive. Believe me, I \nhave friends that are girls and about half of them, especially the ones I'm \nreferring to personally, have high self esteem, very aggressive, will fight \nyou if provoked, even when they're just depressed and weak, in reality, \nthey're kind and sweet hearted ladies. Okay, a bit exaggeration on sweet \nhearted there, but they're pretty nice once you get to know them. My point \nis, while me and the rest of us who are making friends and making the world \na less of a grim place than it already is, you can do what ever you do \nthere. But you can always join us, or not, your choice, not mine. Cheers \nmates.",

However, Yin Yang is a Chinese and \nTaoist philosophy (not religion) based on observations of nature. \n'Everything in nature is whole, a balance of Yin Yang energies.\n\nThe concept of this duality manifested itself into the origins of Chinese \nscience, philosophy, traditional medicine, and martial arts. Later, \nConfucianism and the I Ching Ten Wings gave the concept a greater moral \naspect. The Han Dynasty was very influential in the metamorphosis from the \nold ways to the new.

Even if there was a god, now well he isn't well defined and \nthere is no proof that could say that The Christian God named Allah/Jehovah \ncould exist, neither is there such proof for Thor, Zeus, Isis(The goddess \nmarried to Osiris, not the terrorist group or as they would call themselves \nthe Freedom Fighters of the Islamist State of Iraq and Syria.), \nQuetzalcoatl, Amaterasu and so on. And for you morons that think love and \npeace is the true message to take to heart from religions, let me just \nfinish that evil villain laugh, are outright nonsensical, there are certain \ntruths about religion that will always be true, 1. Religion is the easiest \nway to control the masses. 2. Was made to control us humans so that some \nother moron could take advantage of the situation. 3. The little hope it \nbrings is nothing compared to all the pain it brings with it. Sure the \nTorah or Bible or Qur'an or the dead sea scrolls and all that shit contains \nepics and great deeds but they are few and spread apart like 1 piece of the \nfinest glass dust in a desert. Sure they exist but does really 1 drop of \nGood in an ocean of evil weigh out, like expecting a drop of water to put \nout a raging forest fire.\nSure love is a good thing and does deserve to be spread, but religion will \nnot spread it. Pandora may have opened that box and unleashed all evils but \nalso a smidgeon of hope, just as I opened up a bible in church and thought \nit a bit lacking in plot but all the evil stuff was nice and clean and I \nfound that smidgeon of hope, that one day J.K. Rowling would write a book \njust as bad and voila Harry Potter. Bad plot, an almighty evil, the savior \nand magical nonsense.\nNot that I don't like that concept but J.R.R. Tolkien had a better knack \nfor it albeit even his books were flawed. If you got this far, thank you \nfor reading all this and bearing the pain of the wall of text. If you just \nskipped ahead to the bottom, one you deserve a spanking, and you should \nread the whole thing again. Maybe you'd learn something.",
