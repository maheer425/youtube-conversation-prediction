Not really anything to do with the Tudors.It was all \nabout the fights within the House of Stuart. The ruling came in because \nJames VII of Scotland and II of England converted to Catholicism then had a \nbaby, James Stuart, the future Old Pretender. The baby had two older \nProtestant sisters, Mary and Anne, but because he was male he was heir to \nthe throne so both Scotland and England looked like having a Catholic royal \ndynasty restored. Mary and her husband (William of Orange) were invited by \nsome in England to restore the Protestant throne so William invaded England \nand James fled. Once he lost his English power base the Scottish parliament \nbranded James a traitor and offered the Scottish throne to William and Mary \ntoo. They later died without heirs so the younger sister Anne Stuart took \nthe throne but she had no heir either so the most obvious next monarch was \nher nephew the exiled James Stuart the Old Pretender. The Scottish \nparliament had passed a law saying that the Scottish monarch needed to be \nboth of the Scottish Royal Line and Protestant which paved a way for James \nto return were he to convert from Catholicism. The English Parliament \nlooked to exclude James altogether so they passed the law which not only \nexcluded Catholics but specifically stated that the future English monarch \nwould be Sophie of Hanover and her descendents. Sophie was the daughter of \nPrincess Elizabeth of Scotland the elder sister of Charles I. While Anne \nwas still alive the union between Scotland and England happened and the \nHanovarian Succession was one of the articles of the said union treaty \nwhich created the new united kingdom called Great Britain. In fact that is \none of the major reasons union came about. The English parliament wanted to \nensure Scotland chose the same monarch as England. Sophie was already dead \nprior to Anne dying herself so Sophie's son George I became monarch on \nAnne's death.",

The state of Georgia itself was \ninitially founded on a motto of \"no alcohol, no slaves and no Papists\".",

Democracy.  \nHaving a monarch is antiquated tradition and the head of state should be an \nelected not a hereditary position.  \n\n2. Revenue.  \nThe British Monarchy pays no inheritance tax.  The British Tax payer has to \nmake up the difference.  The Royal activities also cost the British \nTaxpayer many millions of pounds.  They also stifle tourism revenue because \nthey occupy the historic palace that limits the number of days people can \ncome to visit.  Paris's historic sites get far more visitors.  \n\n3. Separation of church and state.  \nBritain's official state religion is Anglicanism despite the vast number of \nnon believers that live there.  The Monarchy's claim to the throne rests on \nthe assertion that God put them there according to tradition and royal \ndocuments.  We all know that isn't true and we should stop pretending for \nthe sake of tradition.  ",

Around the mongolian chinese border! So if \nyou call the ottoman nation an empire then the Principalities of Cilician \nArmenia, Antioch and Jerusalem are also empires, which they obviously are \nnot. Therefore to prevent my brain from exploding I just call the ottomans \na sultanate, as its the best explanation because the term Sultanate doesn't \nhave any requirements besides the ruler being a sultan, unlike empire or \nkingdom. So bottom line its just up to the personality.\n\n2) You made a clear point. I agree with you there\n\n3)We do learn other countries history, actually quite in depth, its just \nthat I don't study history very well xD\n\n5) Oh, so your Arabic.

These two churches are already at the extremes as \nfar as the role of the monarch goes and wars were fought in the 17thC over \nthe issue. The CofS believed there was no head of the church but Christ and \ndenied the monarch even the right to impose bishops on the church.

So if William converts to Islam \nor Scientology or neo-paganism, according to the rules that won't stop him \nbeing head of the Church of England.\n\nAlso, you can't just be a descendant of William the Bastard Conquerer, so \nsadly I'm not in line, and you probably aren't either. You have to be \ndescended from Sofia of Hannover, who was around in 1701 when they made the \nrules. The long list of succession is interesting, as pretty much every \nEuropean royal is on there. So Prince Phillip could be king, but he doesn't \njust need to outlive his wife, he needs to outlive about eighty other \npeople.\ufeff",

Not the same as it \nbeing impossible for a Muslim to be monarch. Though very unlikely it is \npossible but there would need to be disestablishment of the CofE.

Scotland and England were the first countries to \nplay each other at football and were then joined by Wales and Ireland \n(united at that time within the UK) so when the world caught on the other \ncountries joined our club so to speak.

The Act of \nSettlement as passed by the English parliament and accepted by the Scots as \npart of the union settlement specifically excludes Catholics.

This Act and union settlement \nthough did not necessarily override the existing Scottish settlement (as \nstated in the Claim of Right) that the monarch should be of the true \nProtestant religion (ie Presbyterian) and of the Scottish royal line. The \ncurrent monarch is still of the Scottish royal line and as soon as she \ncrosses the border she symbolically stops being Head of the Church of \nEngland and becomes a member of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.\n\nIn truth who would be accepted as monarch would in the end be up to the \nopinion of the public. British constitution is based on precedent and is \nflexible so can be changed. There was no law stating that a monarch \ncouldn't marry an American divorcee yet a reigning king was forced to \nabdicate when he chose to do so because of opinion and attitudes at that \ntime. I'd imagine the British public would have much less opposition to \naccepting a Catholic than they would a Moslem (for example) one.   ",

Knowledge is apprantly =/= intelligence. He may know the history \nor the royal inheritance system of the entire world, but if he can't tell \nwhen someone is joking. No matter how much you know, if you're a dick you \nare a dick.\n\nAlso, I even pointed out an obvious things that people seems to forgot. The \noriginal statement was \"If enough people got killed, illegimate son will \nhave a chance to inherit the crown\". One side stated that it will be valid \nif people die until law become irrelevant or if you take the throne by \nforce, but the other side said that if law = nonexist or if you take the \nthrone by force = new dynasty = invalid. Also, they can't assume some \nhypothetical situation, as it will make things invalid, again.\n Which they are right.\n\nBUT people seems to forgot that the the throne inheritance will become more \ntolerant/less limited when the legitimate reciever of the crown die (I'm \nnot native speaker, so I don't know the exact word for \"reciever of the \ncrown\"). And it is not the hypothetical situation of whatever the hell they \nsaid. It actually how it has been ever since the past. The first son die, \nsecond son inherit. All sons die, daughter inherit. All daughters die, \ncousin inherit. etc etc. So, IF enough people die, but not so much as the \nlaw become irrelevant, just enough death to make the rule of inheritance \nbecome more and more flexible at some point, it will be possible for the \nillegitimate childrend to inherit the throne. (ie, all legitimate people \nthat can inherit the crown die out). That dick guy may argue that \"nope it \nwill be new dynasty and shit\" but that would be wrong, since in the first \nplace, the reason why they made the rule more flexible is for the dynasty \nto survive by letting more people continue the bloodline/dynasty. So, in \nreality, people would rather give the throne to people whom they did not \nwant to give it to before, rather than letting the dynasty die out.",

                    "text": " Just going to throw my relatively informed tuppence worth into this \ndiscussion. The current Act of Succession 1701 (the 2013 amendment is not \nyet law until all 15 commonwealth nations have also passed the equivalent \nlaw) defines those in line of succession to be only the lineal descendants \nof George I's mother, the Electress Sophia of Hannover. Said descendants \ncurrently number something like 5000 legitimate living individuals (though \nmany are or may be Catholics), so you would 'only' need to 'forcibly \nremove' a few thousand people from the succession to completely wipe the \nwhole line out and force parliament to pass a new succession law that \nstarts with a new individual, and said new individual is almost certain to \nbe an ancestor in the line that led to Sophia in the first place, or else a \nlater descendant of such an ancestor. Since Sophia's line is the last \ngenealogical line from James VI&I (many others having been stepped over by \nthe 1701 act due to Catholicism) then the new individual would probably \nhave to be from further up, but James was the only surviving son of Mary, \nQueen of Scots, herself the only surviving child of James V of Scotland, \nhimself only surviving child of Margaret Tudor's first marriage to James \nIV, so the next ancestor chosen for a succession law would probably be a \ndescendant of Margaret's second marriage to Archibald Douglas, Earl of \nAngus, via her daughter Margaret Douglas, grandson Charles Stuart, Earl of \nLennox (brother of Lord Darnley who was married to Mary, Queen of Scots), \nand great granddaughter Arabella Stuart who married the Duke of Somerset. \nIn the event that there are no remaining descendants in this line (I don't \nknow for sure off the top of my head), then the next line parliament would \nprobably choose is that of Margaret Tudor's sister, Mary Tudor, which was \nthe line followed by supporters of Lady Jane Grey, who was said to have \nreigned for 9 days. There are several thousand descendants of Mary Tudor \n(some having already been dispatched as descendants of Sophia of Hannover \nin the previous round of 'forcible removable') so another round of \n'forcible removable', this time of all Mary Tudor's living descendants, \nwould then lead to parliament to have to decide which genealogical line to \nfollow next, since all legitimate descendants of Henry VII would now be \nremoved. Acting as if Bosworth hadn't happened, and reinstating Richard \nIII's succession prior to that battle, would not resolve the issue \nentirely, as it was already unclear who would succeed Richard III, and \nwhether or not it was he, or one of Edward IV's remaining descendants, who \nwas the actual legitimate claimant of the throne. Nonetheless even if we \ncould define the order of succession of the many hundreds of thousands of \nheirs of Edward IV's father, and therefore the entire Yorkist claim, and \nensure we then 'forcibly removed' them from succession, parliament would \nthen, in effect, either have to choose to maintain the Yorkist claim back \nthrough the line of primogeniture from Edward III, via the Clarence and \nMarch families, or else to effectively reverse the wars of the roses and \nreinstate the Lancastrian succession (further complicated from there \nactually being two Lancastrian claims, the one we think we know which \nlogically starts with Henry IV's usurpation of the throne and is confined \nto his issue, and the one actually made by Henry IV, that he was the \nrightful heir to the throne through his mother, due to his father's line \nbeing ineligible because of the supposedly invalid marriages made by Edward \nI, which would make Henry IV the rightful heir of Henry III and lead to \nmany thousands of additional Lancastrian heirs). Suppose parliament has \nsomehow navigated all this confusion, made a publicly accepted decision on \nwhich line to follow next at every turn, and correctly identified each and \nevery valid descendant in each respective line, and that somehow every \nidentified person has in some way been subsequently removed from the \nsuccession, either naturally or forcibly, then by now we have seen maybe \nmillions of people in the UK, Europe, US, Canada, Australia and many other \nplaces 'removed' from the succession, and if we continued to keep going \nback until we exhaust all provable descendants of William the Conqueror \nthen that number would surely be tens or even hundreds of millions, but \ncrucially there will always be millions upon millions of others who have no \nknown and provable descent from an English or UK monarch, and millions more \nwho's only known descent(s) come through an indisputably illegitimate link \n(some cases could be overcome if the illegitimacy was debatable, or \nsubsequently legitimised (think of the legitimised Beaufort's descent being \nHenry VII's main genealogical claim to the throne) but most cases could \nnot, so many millions of people who were relying on simply waiting in line \nwould never see the throne, even if hundreds of millions of others in line \nhad somehow been 'removed' from the succession first. Even for those \nwaiting in line, and planning to 'remove' the people ahead of them in some \nsystematic way, it would still prove very difficult to identify and remove \nevery single person in the way, whilst at the same time escaping justice at \nevery turn, the odds would just be insurmountable. To go back to +Green \nPhoenix 's original point you would have to be a descendant, in a wholly \nlegitimate line, of an English/British monarch, or at least be able to \nproduce a convincing argument to legitimise the previously illegitimate \nlink that was debarring you.",

The two \nbiggest commonwealth countries are the biggest delayers in this respect, \nAustralia is actually made up of several states who usually pass their own \nlaws, rather than laws being made nationally, and although some states were \nhappy to let the law be passed at a national, rather than state, level in \nthis specific case, there were some states, Queensland in particular, that \nfelt this was against the Australian constitution so tried to hastily pass \ntheir own law first, which may have ironically had the effect of preventing \nthe proposed national law from being able to take legal effect. In Canada \nthere is a similar problem, although this time the main problem is with the \nfrench-speaking province Quebec, who aren't exactly monarchist in the first \nplace, but whose laws need to be altered before a Canadian law can be \npassed, in turn before the whole law can take effect in the UK and all the \nother commonwealth countries. The whole process could take at least another \nyear, or possibly even several years. It's even feasible that law changes \ncould be permanently prevented in one or more commonwealth countries, or \ntheir constituent parts, which would prevent the law change from ever \ncoming into effect. So in summary as it stands the law hasn't changed, and, \nto use the closest immediate example where the different rules would \nactually have an effect, if the Princess Royal's daughter, Zara Tindall, \nwere to get immediately pregnant again, and have a son before the agreement \nwas made, then he would still be ahead of her newborn daughter Mia, at #13 \nto her #14, in the succession, at least until the changes did come into \neffect (the changes themselves being retrospective to an already specified \ndate in 2011).",

God may send a woman to the royal family first but he never wanted her \nto become Queen and leader of the Anglican Church. No, he wanted the second \nborn, male child for that role. The girl baby was just a test run to ensure \nthe Queen was prepared for the birth of the male child.\n\nSetting all of that aside, setting up the rules of succession in 1701 was \nupending centuries of tradition.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror was a bastard. By the rules set forth in 1701, he \nshould never have been allowed to be King. The entire history of England \nwould have been irrevocably altered had rules like those existed back then. \nThe rules today are having an equal effect.
