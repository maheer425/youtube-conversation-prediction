Particularly \nsevere famine was in Ukraine and in the Volga region (Russia). My ancestors \nof the Yaroslavl region. This Volga. There was a famine stronger than in \nUkraine. The famine lasted for 6 months. In Ukraine, spring begins earlier \nthan in Russia. The Soviet government has delivered grain for sowing in \nUkraine earlier than in the Volga region. Famine in Ukraine ended earlier \nthan in Russia. Thus six months. 3 months of autumn could stretch on \npotatoes mushrooms berries, corn .... more 3 months of winter. It was the \nworst but near the forest and the Volga ... and hunting and fishing. If \nthere are men in the family then you can go through these 3 months. Next \nspring begins in Ukraine and this is an opportunity to find something in \nthe woods and in the fields. For Russia, 2 more months of hunger because \nthe spring comes later than in Ukraine. Seeding began in early May. The \nBolsheviks bought grain in the United States and brought in the Volga \nregion in May. Ukraine has received seed in late March. WHO longer and \nstronger starved ???? Why the US sold grain only for gold but refused any \nother currency? Why is this grain was the most expensive in history. Why is \nthe \"good\" US .... so expensive grain sold in Bolshevik Russia? Why the US \ndid not think of the starving Ukrainians? OK. Let all Russian kick the \nbucket from hunger .... but why Bolsheviks were forced to buy such a \nterribly expensive bread for your favorite Ukrainians ?????\n\nBy the way Ukrainians themselves sold their entire crop so as not to give \nthe Bolsheviks .. Then there was the depreciation of money and Ukrainians \nwere left without money and without harvest. Russian left without harvest \nbecause they do not have time to create a collective and to prepare and \ngranaries and fruit and vegetable base. This negligence and incompetence of \nthe new leadership. But not intentionally sabotage. Never again will not \nrepeat such a tragedy, the Soviet government is not allowed. Even during \nthe war with the Nazis ..... food distribution was sharp and timely.\nGerman fascists starved Leningrad (Russia) almost 4 years. Nobody cares. \nSupposedly this is not a tragedy. But 6 months of famine in Ukraine is a \ndisaster. There has been a number of Europe. Why can not feed the hungry \nUkrainians? How Come? Why the US pushed up the price of bread if they knew \nthat in Russia and Ukraine HUNGER ????? Why sell such expensive bread \n?????? Shut up .... Leningrad starved for 4 years but Churchill refused to \nsend aircrafts and help break the blockade of the city. Let Russian die in \na hostile environment. This is not a tragedy.\nIt is the policy. West uses the old tragedy (100 years ago) to incite \nUkraine against Russia.",

(No, these \nfacts aren't pro-russian propaganda, it's in fact facts told by the media \nin Denmark (an EU-country).\n\nFacts:\n- Viktor Janukovitj never ordered ordered murders of \"peaceful\" \ndemonstrators, that was in fact the EU, they at least knew about it, and \nthat IS proven.\n\n- It has NEVER been proven that Russia had military on Ukrainian soil.\n\n- The Ukrainian government that is right now, is illegitimate. By Ukrainian \nlaw there has to be 383 mandates, in the election to overthrow a president \n(Viktor Janukovitj) there was 328 (if i remember correctly).\n\n- The russian minority in Ukraine was threatened by death, by right wing \nextremist. That's why Viktor Janukovitj ASKED Putin to help the russian \nminority on Crimea.\n\n- Russia closed for the gaspipe to Ukraine (which runs through Ukraine) for \nan amount of time, because they stole gas from it.\ufeff",

Although, there were some questions and doubts that real \nnumber of \"Yes-voters\" were below one half.\nTry to remember ANY Russian ruler that made Russia stronger to be \npositively discussed in your media and education system. Is there anyone?\nHistorically, England rivaled Russia - e.g. wars and interventions at \nCrimea and Arkhangelsk (GB even transported tanks there!). So you see, \nthere is a historical reasons why only leaders like Gorbachev or Yeltsin \nmay be popular in GB. If your media praises someone in Russia, then it \nmeans that he will do nothing good in overall for his country. That's why I \ncall it propogandic and politically motivated.\nThere were Gulags. My grand-grand-father were in one of those labour camps \nfor owning too much land at Crimea. Mostly people with any-Soviet, \nanti-Communist and sometimes even pro-Western views were sent there. If \nsome landlord or large property owner refused to give his properties to the \ngovernment, he could also be moved there. But its not like half of the \ncountry had been through them. Of all my relatives, only one was moved \nthere. My wife did not have ane relatives sent there, for instance.\nIn current days you can get thrown in jail for critisizing Ukranian \ngovernment (the ones who got power through armored assault), you can get \ntortured to death by SBU in Ukraine (institution similar to KGB and NKVD in \nUSSR).\nBut Western media copletely ignores it, like it's not happening. And it is \nnot somewhere in Siberia or Japan, it's right in a hart of Europe.\nBut since you are told that Stalin is worse than Hitler, but not explained \nabout most of what's happening in West-supported Ukraine right now, you \nwill have no chance to compare and that's how you will develop double \nstandards yourself regardless of if you want it or not.\nAnd labour camps can be different. In 80s we've had \"LTP\"-s - labour \ntherapy dispensaries. Which in real life were small towns 1,500 to 15,000 \npop., where alcoholics and rounders were sent to be corrected. There was no \nfense around them and no bars on the windows, they looked like normal \nSoviet towns if you were driving near them. But the differense from normal \ntowns was thet there were a lot of police who supervised that \"population\" \ndoes not skip work, does not abuses alcohol, etc... It was an ONLY \ninstitution of correction facilities that had practically corrected people \nwho took a wrong step one day. It is much better than jail.\nI think those \"terrible modern Goulags\" that your media reports about from \nNorth Korea are probably clones of Soviet \"LTP\"-s.\nThere is no English page for LTP, but you can paste this one into Google \nTranslate: \nhttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9",

He \ntook a falling apart country full of pesants in bast shoes and left the \ncountry with world's best education system, with rebuilt cities and with \nnuclear weapons. And all this - after suffering in most bloody and crude \nWar and defeating most powerfull aopponent who had better educated army, \nbetter weapons and better military infrastructure.\nDidn't you heard about USA plans to nuclear bomb several dozen soviet \ncities? Stalin had very little time. And guess what would have hapenned if \nUSSR had nothing to reply with? There was a time when USSR had better \nweapons than US, but we did not attack US, nor any of it's satellites with \npuppet governments (but US doesn't hesitate to install its puppet \ngovernments even in former-Soviet repuiblics when it has a chance).\nI understand you have grew up in US, and even though you say you favor \ncommunism (which is banned in your country), somewhere deeply you are a \npatriot and Americans deserve respect for that.\nBut when human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, etc. only works for US \ngovernment when it benefits from it, it does not cause anyone to respect \nyour country, it causes understandable causiousness and fear.\nI didn't called you the names you wrote, I think you mistaked me with \nNikola.\n\nAnd if you belive school teachers, I can tell you a short story. In the 1st \nclass (1st grade, 6-7 y.o.) in school year 1990/91 our teacher told us \n\"Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will continue to live\", and that we must \nlearn well and then do everything to achive Communism. After USSR began to \ncollapse in spring, she told us absolutley opposite, that now we will have \nCapitalism and we must be thankfull (???! such a 180 degree turn in just a \nfew months!).\n\nAlso, don't think I'm antisymmithic or something. I'm cosmopolitic and live \nby rules of \"treat others like you want to be treated yourself\" and \"live \nand let others live\".\n\nBut if you will study Catholism, you will come across some statenments that \nthe People are allowed to use all the resources and nature they need to \nprosper because those are a Gods gift to mankind.\nIf you still don't belive me, see how much US and even Western Europe \nconsumpt natural resources and how much waste they produce. Then take into \naccount population in these parts of the World. And then, compare those \nnumbers to other parts of the World.\nThat is what I was talking about.\nIf people think that God sort of wants them to be wasteful, they will treat \nother aspects of life the same way.\nAnd because of that, developing of double standards over time is inevitable.\n\nP.S. Up until late 90s my family was pro-Western and I was brought up like \nthat. From where do you think I speak Enlish? In 2nd grade I took English \nlessons with 7-graders. After US bombed Yugoslavia and also after 9/11 \nevents (I don't belive planes brought the towers down), I was much \ndisappointed in US and Western system and ideology.\nAfter NATO moved in here, I've just realized, that we were fooled just to \nbecome stupid enough to let ruin our mother country, to betray it because \nof some stupib CIA propaganda, and when we separated into many little \nrepublics - just enslave us one by one.",

What Stalin did is he tried to return what \nUK/US spy Lenin gave away, and not a hectare more.\nDispite that predominantly all Russia's wars were defensive. Russia didn't \neven defend Serbia when it actually had to. And Russia is still demonized. \nIs it split personality in not say schizophrenia?\nCenturies pass, nothing changes.\nIf you are Slavic and want to live a peaceful life, best thing to do is to \ngo  settle somewhere at Urals or Siberia, Novosibirsk for instance.\nI don't belive their propaganda. I was born in Baltic States and first \nthing West did after Russia (again in 20th century) gifted indepenence to \nthose republics, is moved NATO military here.\nYou will not have peaceful life if you live in European part of Russia or \nin Europe. Anglo-Saxons (with a little help from Jews maybe) start a war \n(or even a few) almost every century. And always blame everyone else for \nit. Everyone else and they themselves know that it is B S but they continue \nevery time like the first time.",

Half the \ncountry wanted Yanukovych and half the country wanted Tymoshenko in a free \nand fair election, and one of them won by a small percentage (By 1 million \nvotes).

U.S. Wants to wave their proverbial sausage around, it \ndoes. They had an agreement with Russia Not to wave their proverbial \nsausage around after the cold war and Not-expand NATO. Which it did. Russia \nwants to be treated like a big boy. Just like U.S.\nAll that Small and world-politically insignificant Baltic countries want.. \nis for the 2 super Saiyans not to stomp our gardens and ruin our burrows \nand steal our chickens. Thank you.  Also. When it comes to talking about \nthe situation in Ukraine- Believe no single source. Believe no combined \nsource. Trust no one, Stirlic, only me.\ufeff",

In \nexchange you had to give Ukraine natural gas. You broke the deal when \nYuschenko tried to establish relations with the EU and turned off the gas. \nStill, even after that they honoured their agreement.\n\nThis deal did not allow for masked Russian ground units who had illegally \nremoved their insignia and surrounded Ukrainian bases on their own land. Do \nyou really think Ukraine agreed to having Russian forces surround them?\nNo one had a problem with the BSF, Russia has a right to its security needs \non the black sea, but that does not mean you can menace Ukrainian troops in \ntheir own country. Infantry and special forces were not part of the deal, \nonly navy. Ukraine never protested the Russian bases, they kept their side \nof the deal.\n\nFor the last time, Yuschenko wanted to join EU and NATO. Both said no \nbecause Ukraine has too much corruption. We saw the Ukrainian army in \nKosovo and Iraq where they stole petro and lied about it. We will not allow \nUkraine to join NATO. NATO already has Turkey for the Black sea, we do not \nneed or want Ukraine. The EU already has Greece and does not need another \npoor country. We will protect them though.\n\nHowever after all this, do we have to take Ukraine? Are you going to \ncapture Kiev and conquer Ukraine? The world wants to know.\n\nYour government has called everyone fascist including Belgium and UK. Why \nshould we believe you?\nThere was no violence against ethnic Russians. Find me one source, Al \nJazeera, Chinese media, Iranian media, anyone besides the Putin owned media \nthat has said this. The whole world knows there was never any violence \nagainst Russians. Putin lied because his puppet Yanukovich was ousted after \nstealing $70,000,000,000 from Ukrainians taxpayers.\n\nThe riots were in Kiev, not Sevastopol and not Donbas, There are almost no \nethnic Russians in Kiev, it was Ukrainians fighting Ukrainians, protesters \nvs police. They fought against the corrupt Ukrainian government, not \nRussians.\n\nDo you really think the whole world is evil? No one else thinks Russians \nwere attacked. Not even your allies. Are we all wrong? No Putin has lied to \nyou and your troops die for him, not Russia.\n\nYou signed the Budapest memorandum and swore you would protect Ukrainian \nterritorial integrity. In exchange they gave up their nuclear weapons. They \nthought you were their brothers and looked to you for leadership but you \nbetrayed them. No one will ever trust you again.\n\n Get out of Ukraine now and invite the UN to hold a referendum with Chinese \nobservers, neutral observers who are friends with NATO and Russia. You have \nto be fair for once. If Crimeans wish to leave then that is their choice \nbut you cannot do this at gunpoint. Ukraine must have a say in this. All \nthe gas lines and electricity to Crimea run through Ukraine. Russia must \nnegotiate and not use force. You must compensate Ukraine because you are \ntaking so much of their resources and population. You cannot steal it \nbecause they are weak.\n\nStop splitting everything into two comments. Just write one large commnet \nso I do not miss your points.\n\nAnd stop sending armed bombers into Canadian airspace! Stop trying to steal \nour land in the arctic. We have caught you up there many times. You have \ndone this for years and we will not take this anymore. Stay away from our \nhome or else.",

Comments such as 'your argument is dumb' 'you are \nbias' and 'you lose credibility by making childish statements', yet not A \nSINGLE ONE provides any quotes from the video itself to back up these \nclaims. The problem on both sides of this issue is that propaganda ensures \nsome individuals become so sure that their side is the right one that they \nfight tooth and nail to protect them, without any real knowledge of the \nevents, and/or any willingness to listen to the arguments of the other \nside. And this transcends past Youtube and into politics and the rest of \nsociety; modern day propaganda is so well constructed that so many \nindividuals refuse to listen to another side of the argument because they \nhave been told from television, the internet and other forms of media that \nthe other side is the one making all the mistakes. The spread of \ndisinformation really doesn't help with this either, with massive news \nnetworks on all sides spreading half truths and straight up lies to further \nthe political agenda of the country, and only a very small minority able to \nfind out the real story (which at times still is not the accurate truth \nthat many claim it to be). It's time to break down the east/west barrier \nthat didn't fall during the end of the cold war, and finally have some \nclarity and communication between all superpowers, because if not we will \nbe doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. Ironically, the only saving \ngrace in today's world is Nuclear weaponry and M.A.D., which is both a \nterrible blessing and a potentially catastrophic time bomb, both making the \nuse of nuclear weaponry incredibly unlikely, whilst ensuring that if any \nnuclear weaponry is used, a global catastrophe is inevitable.\n\nInb4 tl;dr.\nAlso, if anything I've said offends you, perhaps it's because it's you I'm \ntalking about.\ufeff",

I'm inclined to call it a tragedy under high \ntensions. but not a war. \n\nif russia was not there, there would assuredly be protests again against \nUkraine in that region since they do not recognize what they believe to be \na new puppet EU  installed government, who are accepting unfavorable trade \nagreements right from the get-go. but remember what happened the last time \nprotesters had a scuffle with Ukrainian soldiers?  \n\nppl there are genuinely upset with the new ukraine and rightfully so. even \nalot of soldiers in the Ukrainian bases have left their positions, and \ntheir commanders have largely allowed it. (if u seen pictures of the bases, \nthey are very sparse and few and alot of them even put away their guns into \nthe armory lockers to prevent accidental provocations.)\n\nreunite with russia is a better term because for those ppl, they have had a \nLONG LONG history of being part of russia, but when the USSR broke down the \nborders got drawn such that they were part of Ukraine, and because the way \nthat infrastructure was set up there want any arguing since that situation \nhad no better outcome. but many of them believe that russia (being in a far \nbetter financial situation than ukraine-- which at the moment is neigh \nbroke, and now entering trade deals and loans and other policies they don't \nagree with in Crimea.\n\nppl are chanting russia in the streets and it is not a small portion, it is \na supermajority. and no one is forcing them to do it.  if you think \nsomething else is going on, its because you have speculated before even \nlooking deeper.\n\ni wont lie, there is a sizable number of ppl who dont want to join russia \nand call for Ukrainian unity. but even if they all showed up to vote they \nwould have been out-voted. which is why they opted to boycott the vote \nbecause the act of voting in it makes the vote more legitimate.(and they \nare corect to because that is the strategically/politically correct move)-- \nand why the passing vote is so unusually high.\n\nbut none the less. there is no way that Crimea would be happy with the new \nUkrainian government. but a good number DO feel that  they would be better \noff joining Russia.",

I guess you don't understand how does that work. Let me explain. \nRussia transport gas through Ukrain. Ukrain takes gas... Ukrain does not \npay for it... And, for some reason, which you may not understand also, that \nis not how the things work in the world. You get gas, you pay for it. So \nrussia, after several months of negotiation, just understood that ukrain \nain't paying( they want 50% discount. Else they won't pay. For real...) . \nAnd, for some reason, that is only known yo europe and US, that was a \nhorrible thing to do.\nText above was filled with sarcasm. Because screw you.\n2) Crimea... In had an election, it desided to become part of Russia. \nCrimea was like a cow for Ukrain. They only took grain from it and did not \ninvest in it. It had russian forces in it as a part of agreement with the \ngovermen. And when the shit hit the fan, those forces protected the \ncivilians from ukranian \"right\" forces, that were not going to pat their \nbacks.\n\nUkranians train their kids to hate Moskow and Russians. They gather them up \nand just scream out loud '\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0443', which kinda states \"kill \nall russians\", which isn't the best thing to teach young souls... But may \nbe in the more civilised US and EU things are different, and \"kill all \nrussians\" is a normal thing to do. Hell i know... I guess that is part of \nsome euro integration programm... Tolerance and respect is not a part of it \ni guess.\n\nI am not involved in the conflict. Nor i spend alot of time studying the \nsubject. It is my view on the situation, that is based on a lot of \ninformation from different sourses and videos with not high view counts.\ufeff",

Russia should not push Muslim culture and ideals \njust because there's large Muslim population in Russia. It should not adopt \nChinese language and teach Chinese history in schools just because there's \nlarge amount of immigrants from China. There's the importance of national \nidentity and pride. Nobody is hurting Russian people, in fact Poroshenko \nmade it very easy for Russian people to get Ukrainian citizenship as \npolitical refugees. Ukraine is just taking an independent stance and it is \nunderstandable. \n\nOpen meeting in Saint Petersburg was organized by the subsidiary of United \nRussia, ruling party of Russia. In other words - Russian government \nsupports a meeting full of nazis, fascists, supporters of mass killings, \nracial hatred, xenophobia and human extermination. \n\nThe EU does not support these parties. Most of them are banned in European \ncountries and they had to rename their party and tone down on the radical \nideas to continue legal political action. They definitely have a minority \nsupport in their country (talking about less than 1%).\n\nConsidering that Russian government banned toys of Nazi soldiers, because \nit 'incites hatred', why are they fine with a political party from \nGreece which uses an almost copy of Nazi flag, throw zieg hails when \ngreeting each other?\n\nUkrainian far-right parties, in total, received around 2% of votes. They \nare not supported by Ukrainian people. \n\nAgain, for Stepan Bandera - that is further lies of the Russian government. \nHe already attained national hero status in 2007 and 2010, even during \nYanukovych. And he is remembered not for supporting Nazis, but for fighting \nagainst Soviet soldiers and Stalin (who invaded Europe leading to 40 year \noccupation). Just like Stalin in Russia is remembered for industrializing \neconomy, fighting Hitler in WW2 and not for mass extermination, racial \nhatred or collaborating with the Nazis. Is it wrong? Yes. But it's not \nexclusive to the new Kiev government and not because Ukrainians are \nfascists. ",

                    "text": "+Brot Pros \nSorry for the late reply. Yeah. It's still legal. I didn't say that it's \nillegal to speak russian. The point is, that they make everything to exlude \nand replace everything russian, including language and culture. First, they \nmake russian unofficial. Second, they try to present that russian \nlanguage/culture is not patriotic and language of occupants. They try to \npresent ukrainian in abetter way while russian in a negative way. \nAnd about gestapo. There are no gestapo looking for the russian speakers, \nbut there are people who could be called as gestapo, who looking for \nrussians (who are possitive about ukrainian way with Russia) and\npro-russian ukrainians or even for the ukrainians who want federalization. \nI have never seen that russian mass media spoke that russian language is \nillegal. Though it could be possible and one of the sources of russian \nsecond-rate media could proclaimed that but it looks for me as a myth about \nrussian propaganda.\nI read about that meeting. As I know, that meeting was about Russia and \nabout supporting of traditional values. And as I know, extreme-right from \nEurope (including people from this parties) and Russia, which are \nsimphathized to nazis fight on the ukrainian side, in battalions of \nUkraine, and the small parts of the nationalists, that fight with \npro-russian separatists are more like conservative or imperialistic.\nSo your statement that Russia supports NSDPAP successor politics causes a \nnumber of questions.1. How is the open meeting of european far right in \nSaint Petersburg is act of support to NSDAP politics, if there main theme \nof the meeting was about Russia and traditional values that Russia \nsupports?2. Doesn't that make the EU, the one, which officially supports \nthese parties? Because these parties officially recognized in their \ncountries, they have parliamentary representatives and the right to vote \nfor enactment of the laws in their countries. And they have seats in EU and \nright to vote there.3. How, as you said \"if anything\" it's Russia that \nsupports NSDAP politics and not Ukraine, if Ukraine has got so many \nfar-right nationalists in their supreme council Verkhovna Rada and their \npolitics quite repressive against communists and other pro-russian sitizens \nand parties? When dubious events take place in Ukraine in a straight \ndirection or connivance of the authorities of Ukraine, related to violation \nof internal laws, violation of human rights in rough form and international \nlaw. Especially in Donetsk and Lugansk.Even if we'll present Russia as a \nNSDAP successor in our minds, just because there was meeting of far-right \nfrom Europe, it won't change the fact of far-right nationalistic tendencies \nin Ukraine, that are familiar to NSDAP: like torch processions to the glory \nof Stepan Bandera (who was extreme right nationalist and criminal), \npopularization of far-right topics in mass media, corporate raids and \nstrange deaths, and a lot of other things mentioned above. But at the same \ntime I won't say that ukrainian nationalist will fully take the same path \nas NSDAP did. Because the german nationalists were more powerful on their \nown. And ukrainian nationalists subordinate to the politicians and oligarhs \ninside Ukraine, who also subordinate to the US politicians and oligarhs. \nAnd as I said their goals more humble at least now. Though I understand \nthat US will take the path to their hegemony that would probably be in some \nsort of way faschist, judjing by their current policy.",

There's no just good and bad, but many shades of grey too. And the \nonly way to know the people's will is voting, of course, this doesn't mean \neverybody is going to be happy with the results and there will still be \npeople who won't agree, but democracy works like this: majority wins. But \nas I mentioned there will still be people angry, and that must be solved by \ncalmed dialogue between both parts. What I think is that this should be an \ninternal issue and neither Putin nor Obama nor Angela Merkel have the right \nto interfere. I just hope that our leaders don't become mad and wish a \npeacefull end to this problem. Greetings and peace from Spain! \ufeff",

Yes, even \nthose, who were enslaved by the Poles were still called Russians, who got \nenslaved by the Poles. have they mixed with the Poles? Yes. Are they poles \nnow? No. They hated the Poles for enslaving them and always fought against \nthem ALONG WITH RUSSIANS, who helped them get back to Russia, they way they \nWERE BEFORE this slavery. Ukraine as an independent state exists for only \n23 years. Who saved Ukrainians from Polish slavery? Russians. Before that \nslavery Russia and Ukraine shared the same history of Kievan Rus.Then \nStalin? Please. Why don't you mention the fact, that some of the Ukrainian \nterritories were annexed to Ukraine thanks to Stalin? \nhttp://orientalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/map.jpg\nWhy don't you mention, that the Ukrainian language became official thanks \nto Stalin's ukranization of the 1920th and 1930th? Before him everybody \nspoke Russian on the Ukrainian territories, except for some villages. \nUkrainian was called a peasant language before Stalin forced the whole \ncountry to learn it. He did the same with Bielorussia and Kazakhstan. It \nwas important to preserve the official languages of every republic in the \nUSSR. Why don't you mention the starvation, that was caused in Russia by \nTrotsky and his jolly Jewish gang, who came from the U.S. and were \nsponsored by the American bankers, as well as the Russian-Japanese war? \nStalin's holodomor was the consequence of this. He didn't do it on purpose. \nHis goal was to save this country for it's complete destruction, which he \ndid and thanks to what he built on the Ukrainian territories Ukraine wasn't \nonly successful, it became one of the richest regions of the USSR. REGIONS, \nnot country! Most of the Ukrainians survive today ONLY thanks to all the \ninfrastructure built for them by the Soviets. The country was devastated \nand almost destroyed by Trotsky's zionist gang of bolsheviks, who were not \neven Russian. WHAT? 90%of people on the Crimean peninsular voted for \nindependence from Russia? Where does this information come from? Nobody \neven asked them, when Crimea was illegally annexed to Ukraine in 1991.

Afterwards, the Ukrainian government resorted to \nstealing gas from the pipelines that ran from Russia to other European \ncountries (for which Russia was paying rent).\nThe same thing is happening right now. The new Ukrainian government is \nrefusing to sign a new contract. It's the same old story:\nPro-russian guy gets elected, NGO's, sponsored by foreign countries, rally \nthe population with false pretenses, and allegations of fraud (and never \npresent any proof), there is a revolution, a new government comes, steals \neverything it can, sells the country to those who invested in the NGOs, \nprovoke conflicts with Russia to then shout to Europe that it's all \nRussia's fault, get in even deeper shit so the population is fed up, and \nvotes for the pro-russian guy again. Repeat until civil war.\n\nSo a mob organized a coup, and the president fled to another part of the \ncountry, and called for allied support, which you call \"Invasion\".\nThe acting government is NOT democratically elected, yet you trust its \ndecisions and call them legal, while the democratically elected government \n- illegal. Democracy is illegal - nice.\n\nYou call \"tyrannical leader\", but compare this coup to other riots, even in \nthe US. I've compared. The US has a habit of killing more people over more \nriots. Just try and do the same to government buildings, and see how \n\"non-tyrannical\" your government is. As for shots - the news were talking \none day ahead, that the next day the forces will have the right to open \nfire, because in the days before, there were deaths among the police force, \nbecause they couldn't defend themselves against aggressors. The rioters \nknew about this. Yet they went into fire. I saw footage. It was horrible, \nyet funny. How insanely stupid can you be to go ahead, when they can shoot \nat you?\nYeah, they said that snipers killed the first civilians. They automatically \nassume that if there is a sniper, it HAS to work for the government. \nEvidence? Pfff! Who needs any? They didn't need any to say that the rioters \nrepresent the population, or that the elections were rigged significantly \nenough to cause a difference in the outcome. Why have evidence about \nanything else?\n\nThe EU has HUGE interests in Ukraine. The money is huge. Ukraine won't be \nable to export its production because of new regulation, and they will have \nto sell the raw materials only, at the lowest prices,.otherwise they'd lose \nit all. Next, they'd have to \"liberalize\" the investment laws, allowing \neasier access to limited natural resources to foreign investors, so \ncompanies could just buy the country piece by piece, especially when the \nexisting companies find it harder or impossible to sell their products. \nSure, Russia also does this, but it learned from the EU, and is much more \nagreeable economically. And the US also has huge interests. It has already \nplaced anti-missile systems in Romania, so they practically reduced their \nopponent's power to negotiate. Russia is the only one that stopped a \nmilitary disaster in Syria. With its advantage gone - there will be nobody \nwho can stop the US government from trampling whoever they want to.\n\nThe whole thing was sponsored. It's not even a secret. The US has admitted \nits part. And look at what the acting government does - it DOESN'T decide \nanything without the EU or the US.\ufeff",

And 7 cents are in the UK, who get their gas out of the offshore \nplatforms. The rest of the countries have it more expensive.\nSo, shitstain, HOW is Ukraine getting prices which are 100-150$ higher than \nin other European countries?\n\nAnd WHY would anyone be obliged to sell you at a price that YOU want? Don't \nwant the price? Don't get the product! It's called MARKET ECONOMY. \nEspecially when you're being such huge assholes. What kind of an idiot \nbites the hand that feeds him?

FCC raise their fairs but the services are still crap, if anything it&#39;s been getting worse, but I won&#39;t do anything about it. <br />Write a complaint letter but still pay my inflated fair n get on that train cuz I&#39;ve got to get to work in time.<br />",

                "text": "As a frequent visitor to Ukraine, I would take issue with your map of \nRussian-speaking versus Ukrainian-speaking population. \n\nI have seen the same map shown on many US TV stations and there are three \nbasic problems with the map:\n\n1. It is an absolute distortion of the truth. 100% of the population of \nUkraine speak Russian daily in their lives. After all, Ukraine was a part \nof Russia for decades. The languages are remarkably similar. The chart was \nproduced by the Ukrainian government - the same government that spent tens \nof millions of dollars in 2010 replacing every Russian-language street sign \nwith Ukrainian street signs...this in a country with severe economic \nproblems and huge debt...and remember everyone speaks and can read Russian \nin Ukraine. So you see this map is a political statement by the government, \nnot at all accurate. If you go to Kiev, the east, or the west of Ukraine, \nyou will hear people speaking both the Russian and Ukrainian language. It \nis the primary language of business in Ukraine as well.\n\n2. Even if the map was accurate, which it is not, the primary language of a \nperson doesn't tell you which way they lean politically in this crisis. \nSomeone who does not speak Ukrainian as their primary language may be a \nfierce Ukrainian nationalist, and visa versa. So the primary language of a \nperson cannot be used as a proxy or straw poll for whether they are \npro-Russian or pro-Ukraine...and most Ukrainians are both pro-Russian and \npro-Ukraine. It is not an either/or proposition.\n\nAs an aside, calling Yulia Tymoshenko \"slightly corrupt\" is the most kind \ncharacterization of her dishonesty I have ever heard. She is a bold-faced \nliar and manipulator who stole billions of dollars from the Ukraine \ntreasury, was imprisoned for her crimes (with almost unanimous praise for \nthe verdict, and little public protest), and is not well-regarded by the \ncitizens of Ukraine. That is why she was quickly yanked from the political \nstage during the latest celebration in Kiev square.\n\nYour facts on Ukraine's history are 90% accurate and you give a good \nsummary of Ukraine's history, but please don't show that map again, it is a \npiece of propaganda, not an accurate depiction of language used in Ukraine, \nand certainly not a reason for the US and Eurozone to try and split a \nunited country down the middle. Don't give Putin another excuse to split \nUkraine further.\ufeff",

Im not sure where u are hearing \nthis because u can easily find on youtube, or from blogs and jounalists on \nBOTH sides that the voting polls were quite safe. even in the tar tar \nneighborhoods (although they have outright boycotted the referendum. )\n\nthere is no media blockade in crimea. if u walk up to military personell \nwith cameras you wont be welcomed, but thats the same most anywhere.In \ncrimea, the internet still works, cellphones still work. It is not some \nkind of media censorship program going on. (well there is.. but its the \nwestern one for us and the russian one for russia, but the internet has \nbeen mostly free from censorship, so u can check for yourself.  tough u may \nneed to employ google translate if ur surfing around on that side of the \ninternet.\n\nthe quality of life in russia is not terrible, i think u are mistaking it \nfor the USSR of eras past. they've got problems but id say they are not \nworse than the current Ukraine, quite arguably better in many sectors. \nthough joining the EU does have great prospect for the Ukrainians. they are \nalready pushing for some unsavory and unfair trade agreements. as they know \nthe current Ukrainian government is in financial trouble, and they can no \nlonger turn to Russia, who they have snubbed. the EU is able to take \nadvantage of this situation and leverage their recognition of the new \nUkrainian government's legitimacy against them.\n\nthe situation is, as Mr Green points out, Complex.\n\nmany crimeans believe they are better off joining russia than allowing the \nnew government to take power, as they lack faith in the new government. \nSome even going as far s calling them facists, neo nazis, and gangsters. \n(which a very small part of them, are unfortunately, since basically anyone \nwho wanted to join the kiev proests were welcomed through their common \nenemy at that time- but has now worked agaisnt them because it makes their \nlegitimacy kind of shakey)\n\nin Crimea, most of them didnt like  yanukovych either, but were willing to \nwait till his term ended. and think of the new government as largely ill \nsuited leaders who filled the void left by the ousted yanukovych, and who \ncame to power through poorly decided means.\n\nIt is my opinion that despite the strong russian military presence, no one \nvoted in fear of their lives, people were allowed to vote as they pleased. \neven by the account of western journalists, the russians had very \nnoticeably stepped back before and during these votes to try to better \nensure their legitimacy and well knew that their actions were being \nwatched.  the people who would have voted against opted not to vote at all, \nas the act of voting makes them aknowledge themselves as an autonomous \nCrimea making such a decision, which make the referendum more legitimate, \nand so  instead they boycotted it. \n\nand that of course is the politically correct move for them, especially \nbecause they would have been outvoted even if they participated. \n\nthose things considered, i dont think the poll numbers are wrong. whether \nyou think it should be legal or not at this point isn't a humanitarian \nrights issue, its just a legal technicality one.\n\nand the Crimea self defence force is infact a real thing... their uniforms \nand equipment shipped from Russia, but you can sign up to join them if u \nhave an address in Crimea, and look the part., they don't even carry guns \nmost of the time, and they have no training or discipline to speak of... \nbut.. they're a thing,...sorta. cuz Russia knows and everyone else knows \nthat the green uniformed men with no insignias were russian. but theyre not \nwho've been patrolling streets or anything(that was the purposed of forming \nthe self defense force) like that since about a few days before the \nreferendum. and are only now  after the vote, returning enough to be a \nstrongly visible presence.  they were strictly told not to bully or \nintimidate, as that would undermine their legitimacy.\n\n  I strongly recommend looking around some more, if you are curious about \nit. and especially if you feel vocal about it.-i wouldnt even call myself \nvocal, just responding to you i think. maybe you've seen something i \nhaven't.  but i haven't seen anything truly outrageous yet. infact, i'm \nalot more surprised there isnt more violence since the situation is a \npretty hefty powder keg of disagreements.  two people died i think when pro \nrussian and pro ukraine protesters clashed, but i was actually the police \n(who at that time had pledged to the autonomous Crimea) who broke it up and \nformed human chains to stop the citizens from hurting each other. and one \nother incident between Ukrainian and Russian military when they occupied \ntheir base. no military vs civilan conflicts as of yet.

Not even having remain \nUkraine as an option nullifies the referendum.\n\nYes, violation of international law is common, but not all laws are equal. \nInvading another country to annex territory is at the top of the list along \nwith genocide for crimes which can not go ignored, and is pretty much the \ntop one that doesn't warrant immediate war for those not involved.\n\nAnd no, there is no Crimean paramilitary. They are Russians. We saw them \nmove in from Russia, we can see their markings are Russian, their equipment \nis of a level no government would allow paramilitaries to posses, and all \nthose asked in the occupation force have admitted to being Russian. They \nare not from Crimea, they are not armed by the Russians, they ARE Russians.\n\nAnd yes, both sides have an agenda, but which has a record of benefiting \nthe populous? Russia, with poverty and diseases (especially HIV) having \nrisen by a large degree since the fall of the USSR, and a general fall in \ntheir quality of life, or the EU, where quality of life and poverty have \nfallen over that same time frame?

One of these would make the \nvote at best questionable and likely invalidate it, all four invalidate it \nwithout question.\n\nSomething to remember is that last year a poll was done on ethnic Russians, \nand only about 40% supported joining Russia, and almost no Ukrainians or \nTatars did.

I know my facts quite well, and I receite only aknowledged \nhistorians and other sources. For example, we have the documents from the \nMVD high inspection of St. Petersburg from 1st January 1914, where it's \nconcluded that the total population of the \"Veliko-rossiya\" region, that \nmeans without malorossiya, belarus, kazakhstan, kirgistan, Caucasus, \nFinland and so on, was precisely: 174,074,906 citizens. I'm sitting reading \nup from a copy of the original right now. The estimated growth of \npopulation in the year 1913 was calculated, and later recorded to 2,754,500 \ncitizens per year in that exact year. This curve would exponentially grow \nevery year after 1913. But, we had a revolution which costed 9 million \nlives, then we had the peoples courts, not just in my native village, but \nin all inhabitated places in the former Russian Empire, and yes, they are \nrecorded to have existed. The only thing that wasn't recorded in all \nplaces, was the brutal masskilling of everyone not hailing the soviet \nsupreme regime and give up their lands to the newly formed, illegal coup \nimplemented government. There were mass protest against the communists and \nmassive forces of men were gathering to throw over the soviets in the early \n'20s. But the difference is, that they were farmers, and that the NKVD were \na mix of traitors from the former imperial fleet and specified terrorists, \nwho had been working to terrorize Russia since the early 1850's.

The city of Moscow \nwas build by the  Knyas (grand-duke) Yuriy Dolgorukiy, and that's correct, \nhe decented in perfect line from Knyaz Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev, given \nlegitimate power to rule all the Rus by the byzantine emperor Constantine \nthe 9th by giving him the crown of the Monomakhs (\u0428\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430). That \ncrown has passed down, generation to generation from Vladimir and the \nlegitimate rule of the Byzantine Empire by the byzantine Empress Anna who \nmarried Vladimir and became mother to his children. The bloodlne was not \nextinguished in 1453, because it was passed through the Monomakhs, the \nRyuriks and the Romanovs. Unfortunately it was washed through with the \ncoming of Peter the terrible ( the first). But some of us genealogists has \nproven by  perfect lines that that particular bloodline from the Monomakhs \nstill exist in a number of families. It's all \"Rus\", there's no \"Ukraina\" \nwhich is a degrading polish word for the borderlands. Ukraina is \n\"Malo-Rossiya\" which is the Greek term for the Center of rule or prosperity \nin a nation, in this case the Rus. \"Veliko-Rossiya\" is the greek term for \n\"the great lands\" or \"the big lands\" which was adopted by the Russians. \n\"The great lands\" means all the uncivilized provinces ruled by the cultural \ncenter of \"Malo-Rossiya\", which is Kiev. Outrageous Imperialism from the \nPolish and Lithaunian empires invaded and destroyed much of prospering \nculture and beauty of the Kievan Rus. They occupied, and I must say, \nsucceded in depopulizing the lands from the ethnics and sending in their \nown poles. Now it's just a mess and an ilegitimate demand for rule in the \ncenter of Russian culture, which is Kiev, and don't write \"kyiv\" because \nthere is no city called that way. In the ancient manuscripts of Vladimir \nMonomakh, it clearly says \"Kiev\", kyiv is another Polish dialect pushed \nupon the rus in the region. For example the loved and famous Writer and \nscreenplay author Gogol, he was \"Malo-Russian\", and he never spoke the \nPolish jargon, He spoke only pre-revolutionary Slavonic, read his works \nfrom first hand editions and see.

For centuries it was the base of the \nRussian/Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Russia has the legal right to send troops \nto said base. That's what they did. As for arming the locals, and maybe \nsending their own disguised troops - I can't really condemn them for that \nconsidering the amount of money the US has almost certainly invested into \nthis latest conquest.\n\nMake no mistake, these sort of protest revolutions do not occur \nspontaneously, or without serious financial and political support. It makes \nno difference to US interests whether the leader is elected perfectly \nfairly, like Yanukovych, or a quasi-dictator like al Assad, or a full-blown \ndictator like Saddam. If he's not playing ball - he's gonna go, one way or \nthe other. The US certainly has no problem whatsoever with dictators as \nsuch, as long as they're their dictators. Pinochet is just one of many, \nmany examples. Saddam's another.\n\nObama has the gall to say an elected leader of a sovereign country should \nbe deposed for making fake election promises. Take a guess at how many \ngovernments could be \"rightfully\" deposed under such hypocritical reasoning.\n\nI'm a citizen of the EU. And as such its in my interest to see Ukraine join \nthe EU. That doesn't mean I'm deceived for one second as to the tactics \nused by my own bloc, and the double standards of the media.",

Just as there is a propaganda war against Russia \nthat Putin was the problem back in 1990 this scene was set the same for \nSlobodan Milosevic president of Serbia. So you see this is nothing new in \nfact it is a very old schematic that was first tested on the Serbs. In fact \nto prove what I have wrote we have a voice recording of Milosevic before \nhis death in 2006 where he tries to warn the Ukraine, Russia and Belorussia \nof what will happen to your countries if you let the west meddle in your \naffairs. Milosevic\u2019s testimony word by word has sadly become reality in the \nukraine. It is not a coincidence that Croatian nationalists (former Serbs) \nhad come to help the Ukrainians nationalists(former Russians). The Croats \nwere sent to fight around lugansk once former slaveno-serbija. Not a \ncoincidence but a message from the west to all Orthodox Slavs! The whole \nthing is a set up for their public  to accept yet another war.",

                    "text": "We have been led to believe that in order to industrialize at any price \nStalin pursued a ruthless policy of forced collectivization deliberately \nmurdering several million peasants known as kulaks during the process. The \ntruth is quite different however.\nWhen the Bolsheviks seized power one of their first acts was to legalize \nthe seizure of the huge landed estates from the feudalistic landlords. The \nslogan of this campaign was\n\"Land to the tiller.\" This however, left most land in the form of small \nholdings unsuited for large-scale agriculture particularly the production \nof the vital grain crops necessary to provide for the urban centers. Under \nthe NEP, agrarian capitalism and a new form of exploitative landlordism \nbegan to flourish in the countryside. The class known as kulaks, literally \n\"tight-fists\", consisting of usurer lenders and other petite capitalists \nincluding village merchants and rich peasants, were cornering the market in \nthe available grain grabbing more and more small holdings of land, and, \nthrough their debt holdings, coercing peasants back into tenant farming and \nwage labor. Somehow, the small peasant holdings had to be consolidated so \nthat modern agriculture could begin. There were basically two ways this \ncould take place. Either through capitalist accumulation, as the kulaks \nwere then doing, or through the development of large-scale socialist farms. \nIf the latter, there was then a further choice: a rapid forced \ncollectivization, or a more gradual process in which co-operative farms \nwould emerge first, followed by collectives, and both would be on a \nvoluntary basis, winning out by example and persuasion. What did Stalin \nchoose?\n\nHere, in his own words, is the policy he advocated and that was adopted at \nthe Fifteenth Party Congress, in 1927.\n\"What is the way out? The way out is to turn the small and scattered \npeasant farms into large united farms based on cultivation of the land in \ncommon, to go over to collective cultivation of the land on the basis of a \nnew and higher technique.\nThe way out is to unite the small and dwarf peasant farms gradually but \nsurely, not by pressure, but by example and persuasion, into large farms \nbased on common, cooperative, collective cultivation of the land with the \nuse of agricultural machines and tractors and scientific methods of \nintensive agriculture.\nThere is no other way out.\"\n\nTo implement this policy, the capitalist privileges allowed under the NEP \nto redevelop industry to the necessary phase of development where a \ntransition to vanguard socialism could begin, were revoked. This was known \nas the restriction of the kulaks. The kulaks, whose very existence as an \nexploiting class was thus menaced, struck back. They organized terrorist \nbands who attacked the co-operatives and collectives, burning down barns \nwhen they were filled with grain, devastating the fields, and even \nmurdering Communist peasant leaders. Even more serious than these raids, \nthe kulaks held back their own large supplies of grain from the market in \nan effort to create hunger and chaos in the urban centers.\n\nThe poor and middle peasants struck back. Virtual open civil war began to \nrage throughout the countryside. As the collective farm movement spread \nrapidly, pressure mounted among the poor and middle peasants to put an end \nto cruel landlordism and loan usury in the countryside for good. In 1929 \nStalin agreed that the time had come to eliminate the kulaks as a class. He \nled the fight to repeal the laws that allowed the renting of land and the \nhiring of labor, thus depriving the kulaks both of land and of hired \nworkers. The ban on expropriation of the large private holdings was lifted, \nand the peasants promptly expropriated the kulak class. The expropriation \nof the rural agrarian capitalists in the late 1920s was just as decisive as \nthe expropriation of the urban industrial capitalists a decade earlier. \nRural landlords and village usurers were eliminated as completely as \nprivate factory owners for their exploitation of the masses. It is \nundoubtedly true that in many areas there was needless violence and \nsuffering. But this did not originate with Stalin. It was the hour of the \ncountries rural peasant masses, who had been degraded and brutalized for \ncenturies and who had countless blood debts to settle with their \noppressors. Stalin may have unleashed their fury, but he was not the one \nwho had caused it to build up for centuries.\n\nIn fact it was Stalin who checked the excesses generated by the enthusiasm \nof the collective movement. In early 1930 he published in Pravda \"Dizzy \nwith Success\", reiterating that \"the voluntary principle\" of the collective \nfarming movement must under no circumstances be violated and that anybody \nwho engages in coercive collectivization objectively aids the enemies of \nsocialism. Furthermore, he argues, the correct form for the present time is \nthe cooperative, known as the artel, in which \"the household plots, small \nvegetable gardens, small orchards, the dwelling houses, a part of the dairy \ncattle, small livestock, poultry, etc., are not socialized.\" Again, \noverzealous attempts to push beyond this objectively aid the enemy. The \nmovement must be based on the needs and desires of the masses of peasants.\n\nStalin\u2019s decision about the kulaks perfectly exemplifies the limits under \nwhich he operated. He could decide, as he did, to end the kulaks as a class \nby allowing the poor and middle peasants\u2019 to expropriate their land. Or he \ncould decide to let the kulaks continue withholding their grain from the \nstarving peasants and workers, with whatever result. He might have \ncontinued bribing the kulaks. But it is highly doubtful, to say the least, \nthat he had the option of persuading the kulaks into becoming good \nsocialists.",

For instance capitalists love to cite that the \ndeath tolls of the holodomor  as around 7mil. This statistic actually has \nits origins in Nazi propagandists for the purpose of making Hitler look \nbetter than Stalin under the premise of that Hitler killed 6mil in 4yrs \nStalin killed 7mil in 1yr, Hitler is therefore better than Stalin. Now if \nthe questionable origins of this statistic aren't enough an historical \nanalysis of Ukrainian population growth can provide clear evidence against \nit. In 1926 the population of ethnic Ukrainians was 23,218,860 and then \n13yrs later the population was 23,667,509. Now looking at this it becomes \nevident that the Holodomor did indeed happen to some magnitude else the \nethnic Ukrainian annual growth rate was 34,511people/year. But when we \naccount for this statistic of Holodomor 1932-1933 death tolls then the \npopulation of that year would be around 16,158,860 with full recovery to \nPre-famine levels by 1939. Implying an annual growth rate of 1.25mil/year, \nyou may look at this and say,\"That sounds reasonable.\" but when you compare \nthis with Ukrainian growth rates during the later half of the century you \nobserve that during the 60's the decade growth rate was 3.84mil/decade with \nan average annual growth rate of .384mil/year, that during the 70's the \ndecade growth rate was 2.88mil/decade with an average annual growth rate of \n.288mi/year, and during the 80's the decade growth rate was 1.92mil/decade \nwith an average annual growth rate of .192mil/year. These are far smaller \ngrowth rates at a much later period than the 30's annual growth rate of \n1.25mil/year. What this indicates is that either this statistic for \nHolodomor death tolls is completely inaccurate for it would imply a \nPre-industrial growth rate far exceeding that of several Post-industrial \ngrowth rates, which is absolutely ludicrous. Or it indicates that Stalinist \npolicies of collectivizing agriculture are 5 times more beneficial than any \ncapitalist agricultural policy. Leaving you to choose between the lesser of \ntwo \"evils\" on what the actual truth is, either your a liar or you believe \nin idiotic policies.\"",

Some of them multiple times.\n\nThe US is known to have established 'banana republics'. A fruit growing US \ncompany lobbied for the government to topple a Central American \nDEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT that took away some land rights from the \ncorporation, to INSTALL A DICTATORSHIP that led to the destruction of the \ncountry.\n\nLikewise, you just have to take a look at how effective the US invasions \nhave been in countries. The only half succesfful one was the one in Korea. \nSouth Korea most certainly does better than the North, even if the US \ndidn't even win the war.\n\nBut if you look at Vietnam, you only see millions of people mindlessly \nkilled.

It only caused more terrorists to join up \nwith ISIS because the US had caused far too many civilian casualties, \nwillingly or not (I doubt it was willingly, but oh well, the fact still \nstands).\n\nSo, Russia is not allowed to invate a plot of land that is culturally and \nethnically extremely intertwined, was part of the country for hundreds of \nyears, and annex it?

The \npuppet government allow the US and her allies to set up military base \n(including missile bases) within Ukraine. which is equivalent of Russia \nsetting military base in Cuba.\n\nRussia see this like the Russian version of Cuban missile crisis desided to \nprotect their \"red line\"\n\nUnderstand Ukraine serve as a kind of borderline between Russia and the \nwest.\n\nNow here is other things we need to look at.\n\nFirst of all Why would the police shot unarmed civilans when they were \norder to step down, and the President Yanukovich know that the west is \nwatching his everything move.So by logic he would not order any shotting of \nthe protestors.  On the other hand the rioter need the west support. think \nabout that.\n\nSecond: the new government is nothing more than rebels, they started a \ncoup, and the government choice not to use military to suppress it (so that \na civil war doesn't break out). In many people's view this \"new government\" \nis not legal nor legit. UN should have been against this \"new government\" \nlike they did with 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nThird: the western media is trying to make us think that Crimea is push to \njoin Russia at gun point. If this is true why would people of Crimea join \nthe Pro-Russian militants? why would they freely sign up to join?\n\n\nNow there is clues that it is the West (mainly US) supported and started \nthis coup. If so, at which point is it make it okay for support a coup? \nwhat requirement is needed to support a coup LEGALLY? and has Ukraine meet \nthose requirement?\n\n(also lets not talk about \"Nazi\" in the \"new government\" that would be too \nmuch to talk about)",

He also \nmentioned that if the Ukraine joined the EU then missles could be installed \nin the Ukraine. The point of this video is to try and explain in a way that \nwe could at least get some understanding of the events happening over there.\nHe clearly says that parts may be over simplified, and in a video lasting \nless than 10 minutes it's hardly surprising. I think to get a true \nunderstanding it would take many months of research and looking at \nviewpoints from both sides, something which cannot be compressed into 10 \nminutes...\nYou are correct about the US foreign policies pushing the world into wars. \nThe policies are awful and always have been. At the same time illegally \nentering another country could easily be considered an act of war. And is \nwas an illegal entry. Clearly the president of the Ukraine should have been \nvoted out rather than protests to force his removal, however it is also \nclear he should not have killed his own people. There are few innocent \nsides in the conflict. The Ukrainian president, the protesters, Russia, and \nthe US, none of these are innocent, the only people who are are the people \nof the Ukraine who are suffering.",

When you \nreplied to BoxaBole, you wrote, \"its in your interest to have Ukraine taken \nby the EU.\" Granted, BoxaBole said he/she is from Serbia, but whether it's \nSerbia or Ukraine, you have no right to tell a foreigner what's in their \ncountry's interest, only they can decide that. (It was also kind of a dick \nmove to add the smiley faces when you were telling him/her that they \nbasically had no choice in the matter; if that's the case, you shouldn't be \nhappy about it, it's a tragic thing for someone to be powerless to decide \nthe fate of their own country).\n\n#2 I respect the fact that you tell it like it is. Too many people are too \neasily disillusioned by their country's bullshit explanations for what in \nthe end is simply conquest. However, you come off as being content with \nthis, which is part of the reason why I accused you of thinking \nimperialistically (meaning your thinking seems to be very much in line with \nimperialism). Maybe that's going a little far, if so, I apologize, but if \nyou go back and read your comments objectively, you can see how what you \nwrote implies imperialism.\n\n#3 and #4 The \"moral ideal\" is the \"will of the people,\" or possibly a \nthird alternative to poverty and servitude (i.e. prosperity and \nindependence). I understand this may be unrealistic (that's why it's called \nan ideal), but unrealistic does not mean impossible. Perhaps a truly \nindependent Ukraine, or that of any other country currently being forced \ninto a subservient position, is just a Disney fantasy, but only in today's \ngeopolitical atmosphere. Therefore, \"contemplating otherwise\" is the first \nstep toward changing the geopolitical atmosphere to make that ideal \nachievable. Every political/social accomplishment was possible because \ninitially, someone believed it could be.\n\nBut maybe our personal amounts of respective optimism and skepticism on \nthis issue is the base of where we diverge, and the most we can do is agree \nto disagree. If that's the case, I'll just say this: citizens of powerful \ncountries like us should not be content with the injustice our countries' \nforce on others in their pursuits of power, but subject them to criticism \nand actively try to change them, no matter how unrealistic that may seem or \nhow long it will take. That's all we can do. If we don't, who will? And how \ncan we expect to better our countries or make the world a better place if \nwe don't strive toward those ideals and utilize what free speech and \nopportunities our governments grant us?\n\nThat is all, sorry if I got a little preachy there.",

However, I \nthink you're making a lot of assumptions claiming that the CIA was behind \nthe developments in Ukraine and all those other countries you mentioned. It \nwouldn't surprise me that the CIA played some sort of role in some of those \ncases, but I would say \"natural\" revolutions occur much more often since \norchestrating a revolution and mobilizing thousands of people living in \nanother country from the outside, while trying to keep your involvement a \nsecret, is obviously pretty fucking difficult, and would never work unless \neverything was perfectly in place. However, if you know of any evidence \n(and I mean from good, not-totally-biased sources) to suggest that this was \nthe case for the CIA in Ukraine, please share.\n\nAlso, I'm a citizen of the US, and obviously the interests of my country \nand yours are in alignment on this issue, but personally, I would prefer to \nsee Ukraine not conquered by anybody and a political administration arise \nthat represents the interests of its people, whether they are pro-EU/US or \nnot. They seem largely divided on whether they stand with the EU or Russia \nas you get between Crimea and the rest of the country, but I am hoping that \nsome sort of peaceful resolution that works for every party involved can be \nreached, and as John said, the ideal is that Ukraine can develop its own \nidentity and not be defined by whoever it affiliates itself with \npolitically.",

Pathetic.\n\n1) Ukraine has been part of Russia for hundreds of years, except for the \nlast 50 or so years.\n2) Its culture is extremely inter linked.\n3) A vast number of people living in Ukraine are ethnic Russian, and plenty \nof people speak Russian.\n4) The democratically elected (indeed, you don't know how democratic the \nelections were in the first place, but meh) was toppled, with the clear \nsupport of the US behind it. THIS IS FACT. It wasn't the wish of the \nUkrainians to violently overthrow the government. But you don't know shit, \nso what can anyone expect from a narrow minded idiot.\n5) Russia provided Ukraine with very significant financial aid. (WAY more \nin terms of fuel subsidies in total value than all the financial help the \nUS and the EU pledged to give to Ukraine WHILE THE EU AND US FORCED UKRAINE \nTO PRIVATISE for them to get the money (less than what Russia would have \ngiven) so that Western companies can come in and buy the companies, acquire \na monopoly, take control of the country and raise prices). Not only joining \nthe EU would be disastruous for Ukraine's economy (its domestic industry \nwould be destroyed and its workers exploited), but even aligning and \nopening up to EU and US financial 'help' would ravage the country's \neconomy. You are so ignorant it's sad. Example: Greece's economy started \ngoing downhill the month it first joined the EU. Prices increased greatly \nwhile debt started increasing greatly.\n6) Russia was a very sure fuel source for Ukraine, and a very important \ntrade partner. Now Ukraine has a much more shaky supply of fuel, especially \nwith Russia starting to sell all of its oil to Japan, China, and the rest \nof Asia.\n7) The protests themselves were thought to have been STARTED BY THE WEST. \nAlso, it is thought that some killings in the crowd were abnormal, so some \nother sources might have incited violence for no real reason (so, it was \nthe West).\n8) The current Ukrainian government JUST APPOINTED A NEO-NAZI AS AN \nADVISOR!!!!! AND THE CURRENT UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT PUT DOWN REVOLTS IN \nEASTERN TOWNS BY KILLING STRIKERS!!\n\nLikewise, some points to go against the West:\n1) The Propaganda was disgustingly obvious. Everyday I would see and hear \nof news outlets barely stopping short of outright insulting Putin and \ncalling him an imbecile. Every major news outlet adopted a hugely \nsubjective tone. Zero objectivity was present...\n2) The US is no longer classified as any sort of Democracy by top \nuniversities in the world. It is now an outright oligarchy; and yet US \nmedia vehemently support the idea that Russia's oligarchy has to fall.\n3) The US has toppled democratically elected governments to be replaced \nwith dictatorships due to corporate lobbying (thus the term bana republic \nwas born).\n4) The US has puppeted countless countries, but simply hasn't annexed them, \nleaving them to economic ruin after invasion, and allowing US corporations \nto come swooping in. Russia annexes a territory full of Russians that is \nimportant to the country's NEAR HOME geopolitical security and immediately \nannounces a very hefty investment plan.\nHonestly, I'm being completely objective here. I might sound extremely \nsuggestive and opinionated, but the END RESUTLS speak for themselves, \nreally. I don't think states are inherently evil; they're just playing 'the \ngame'. However, it is obvious whose fault is in this case...\n\n ",

On one hand, yea, Crimea \ndoesn't have the constitutional legitimacy to secede and if Russia were to \nannex it then it would cause a shitstorm. And on the other side, the new \ngovernment is trying to force the Ukrainian language on these regions. \nHowever, I think it's fair to look at the reasons behind these both.\n\nCrimea wants to secede because they have a rather large pro-Russia base but \nALSO because right now there are a LOT of Russian soldiers in Crimea (The \n\"unmarked\" soldiers have been seen driving vehicles with Russian plates \nand, quite honestly, they are WAY too geared and too well trained to be \nanything BUT a military force from another country, and the only nation who \nwould have a reason to do this would be Russia). If you point a loaded gun \nto someone's head and threaten to kill them unless they say something, you \ncan bet you can make them say it. There can be pro-Russian people who DON\"T \nwant to secede, but you won't hear from them because they fear speaking up \nwill make them targets). These two things are what makes things even more \nproblematic. Is this referendum driven by their own desire, or is it \nbecause right now there are a lot of military personnel in the region that \nwant them to join Russia (Something Russia wants, due to the naval base \nthey have in the region: it's Russia's only naval base that doesn't freeze \nup at some point in the year).\n\nThe new government right now is actually really afraid. Them trying to \nforce the Ukrainian language on the Russian-speaking regions is driven by \nthis fear. What are they afraid of? Well, for starters, the protesters. \nThese protesters weren't as peaceful as it seems, especially during the \nfinal couple of weeks, and the government is afraid of what'd happen if \nthey start up again. Because of this, they're trying to force all Russian \ninfluence out of the nation. Does this make it right? No, but what matters \nis understanding the root cause of it.\n\nEither way, both are problems. They just come from different sides. This \nisn't easily solved, and is only being made worse by the actions of the USA \nand Russia.",

In \n1917, three states emerged: Western Ukrainian Republic, Ukrainian People\u2019s \nRepublic, and Ukrainian Socialist Republic. Ukrainian Socialist Republic, \nwith the help of Russia, fought and conquered the other two states.

(backed by american NGOs financially) neo-nazis fought \npolice for several weeks, at first they used only molotov cocktails, knives \nand traumatic guns, but later started using real firearms.\nseveral weapon storages were captured by the masked \"protesters\" (Right \nsector, svoboda etc) in western ukraine on 18-19 February and there was an \nactual shooting on Maidan (not just snipers).  20 policemen are killed, 140 \nwounded with guns and 400+ got into hospital  during 2-3 days  19-21 \nFebruary.\nthe riot police forces didn't have any firearms at all (except some \nnon-lethal riot guns that shot baton rounds, but they can be used on close \ndistances) that's why they began to retreat when shooting had begun.\nThe situation turned to hell when some snipers (as it later turned up they \nwere not police snipers, and not snipers from among the protesters) shot \nabout 100 people (both protesters and policemen), then main police forces \nretreated from the city, former president Yanukovich fled the country, and \nsince then Kiev streets are in fact controlled by armed groups of radicals, \nthey fight each other like some gangs, to have 'protection money' from \nbusiness and even government buildings and everything like that, and police \ncan't interfere since those radical guys fought against former government, \nand brought new government to power, so new government can't (or doesn't \nwant to) do anything about it, and even sometimes uses those armed gangs to \nraid companies (because new government is controlled by oligarhcs, they're \nnow raiding companies that belonged to oligarchs from previous government).\nafter that, people of several provinces, including krym (crimea) \ndemonstrated peacefully (no masks, no weapons, no violence) against the new \nnazi-led government. all except krym were attacked by the neo-nazis, as \nkrym is the furthest away. Krym's population organized into militias and \ncreated roadblocks and barricades. Krym's government allowed for a \nreferendum with choices of ukraine, independence or russia. 83% of \npopulation turned up and 97% of them voted to join russia.\nwhy? because Krym was russian territory with russian people for centuries, \nbut 60 years ago a dictator tore it from russia and gave it to ukraine as a \npresent on a whim.\nno soldiers were present during referendum, as observed by international \nmonitors. couple of days later Krym's government formally asked to become \npart of russia and were accepted.\nrussia has a naval army base in krym, that's why some russian soldiers were \non (former) ukranian territory.\nobama does not accept the referendum because he wants russia to lose the \nblack sea base. he does not care about people. he wants a strategic attack \nposition for the NATO.\nthe EU (which especially after the new trade agreement will suck ukraine \ndry) wants Krym because it's responsible for a huge part of ukraine's GDP, \nso EU also deems the referendum illegal.\nthe US invested all it's money into weapons and nothing into it's people's \neducation, standard of life, health, economy. now they want to use those \nweapont no matter what...\ufeff",

                    "text": " I've actually investigated some capitalist accusations and found little \nfoundations in reality. For instance capitalists love to cite that the \ndeath tolls of the holodomor  as around 7mil. This statistic actually has \nits origins in Nazi propagandists for the purpose of making Hitler look \nbetter than Stalin under the premise of that Hitler killed 6mil in 4yrs \nStalin killed 7mil in 1yr, Hitler is therefore better than Stalin. Now if \nthe questionable origins of this statistic aren't enough an historical \nanalysis of Ukrainian population growth can provide clear evidence against \nit. In 1926 the population of ethnic Ukrainians was 23,218,860 and then \n13yrs later the population was 23,667,509. Now looking at this it becomes \nevident that the Holodomor did indeed happen to some magnitude else the \nethnic Ukrainian annual growth rate was 34,511people/year. But when we \naccount for this statistic of Holodomor 1932-1933 death tolls then the \npopulation of that year would be around 16,158,860 with full recovery to \nPre-famine levels by 1939. Implying an annual growth rate of 1.25mil/year, \nyou may look at this and say,\"That sounds reasonable.\" but when you compare \nthis with Ukrainian growth rates during the later half of the century you \nobserve that during the 60's the decade growth rate was 3.84mil/decade with \nan average annual growth rate of .384mil/year, that during the 70's the \ndecade growth rate was 2.88mil/decade with an average annual growth rate of \n.288mi/year, and during the 80's the decade growth rate was 1.92mil/decade \nwith an average annual growth rate of .192mil/year. These are far smaller \ngrowth rates at a much later period than the 30's annual growth rate of \n1.25mil/year. What this indicates is that either this statistic for \nHolodomor death tolls is completely inaccurate for it would imply a \nPre-industrial growth rate far exceeding that of several Post-industrial \ngrowth rates, which is absolutely ludicrous. Or it indicates that Stalinist \npolicies of collectivizing agriculture are 5 times more beneficial than any \ncapitalist agricultural policy. Leaving you to choose between the lesser of \ntwo \"evils\" on what the actual truth is, either your a liar or you believe \nin idiotic policies.\"",

The Bolsheviks \nwanted to take everything, but he divided all the property between the \nolder children. Almost nothing left. Then the Bolsheviks took the mill, \nland, horse and sheep ..... There was one goat, a cow, chickens, and a \nlittle land. Now what? Go and hang myself? \nThen famine. Famine in the Volga region was Similar Ukrainian famine .This \nperiod 1932-1933. The famine was throughout the USSR but Ukraine and the \nVolga region particularly affected. Stork is a normal meal ..... in the \nVolga region ate ate cats and dogs. But in the forest live animals and \nthere is a fish in the river. Had the opportunity to hunt and fish. The \nfamine lasted 6 months. My grandfather kept the 5 younger children .They \nall survived and planted land of grain which the Bolsheviks have bought and \nbrought from the United States. Maybe the Ukrainians need to stop whining? \nSo many years have passed ...... \n\nGenghis Khan slaughtered the entire male population including infants in \nmany Russian cities and villages .. Napoleon burned Moscow. Hitler killed \nover 23 million Russian people ... I missed the war with Poland, Turkey, \nSweden, Japan, the First World War .... and so on.

Everything is changing.\n\nMongols, French, Turks, Germans, etc. ..... Now are not enemies to Russian. \nUkrainians are very actively fought on the side of the Bolsheviks. There \nwere no less than the Russian Bolsheviks. Jews were the most active fans of \nthe Soviet regime. Any claims against us? We suffered no less, but more \nthan the Ukrainians.

The Slavic community, \nmostly Russians, have displayed such severe nationalism, they are more than \nhappy to wage a war against another Slavic country in order to keep a \nSlavic country from working well with Europe.\n\nI have lived in Europe, USA, and Ukraine, and although I never lived in \nRussia, I have family there and stayed there for months at a time. Of all \nthese places, if I were to choose which countries ukraine should be more \nlike, I would choose the western countries. I say this with my 12 siblings \nwho still live in Ukraine, in mind.",

That \nsame nationalism is what is threatening my mother's job because she has the \nwrong language, even though she has very Welsh ancestry, she was raised in \nAustralia, and is therefore somehow English in the eyes of the \nnationalists.

                    "text": "I'd like to elaborate a little bit on this whole \"Nazis in Ukraine\" \nsituation. Most of them probably don't qualify as such, they are rather \nultranationalist, which is not, technically speaking, nazism, but comes \nvery close, in my opinion.\n\nDuring WWII, the German forces created a division of the SS (Schutzstaffel) \nfrom Ukrainian volunteers in the Western Ukraine. They fought for Hitler \nagainst the USSR until almost the end of war. Now they are considered \nheroes in the Western Ukraine. In the city of Lvov/Lviv, the largest there, \nthere is an annual parade in honour of that division, with thousands of \npeople cheering for them. For the guys that fought for Hitler.\n\nAround that time, there existed an \"Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists\" \n(OUN), which technically declared fighting against everyone for the \nindependence of Ukraine, however, repeatedly acknowledge that their main \nenemy was the USSR and had made a deal with Hitler to leave each other \nalone. Those people had attempted a genocide of Polish population, having \ndeclared certain territories \"Ukrainian\" and demanding that ethnic Poles \nleave that area within one or two days or otherwise be killed. By various \naccounts, in a few years the organisation murdered, if I am not mistaken, \nfrom 30 to 60 thousand Polish civilians, not discriminating by age or \ngender, simply because the lived (and may have lived for the past couple \nhundred years) on the territories that were now deemed \"Ukrainian\". These \npeople, the OUN, are also nowadays considered heroes. In 2009, \nthen-president Yushenko awarded the highest state award to the leaders of \nthat organisation (again who committed genocide and made deals with Hitler) \n- those awards were later withdrawn by the following government. But still, \nWestern Ukrainians now consider them heroes.\n\nThis organisation, the OUN, coined the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to \nheroes\", which has recently become popular again with all these protests. \nMost people, sadly, don't realise that they are honouring murderers and \nNazi collaborators. Instead, they insist that \"definitions have changed\" \nand now this phrase honours just \"any people fighting for Ukraine\". Like, \nyou know, the popular German phrase \"Sieg heil!\", which translates as \"Hail \nvictory!\" and refers not to military victories specifically, but any \n\"victory\", like scientific progress, social advancement, etc.\n\nNow, the people in the East and in the South of Ukraine are different. We \nhave always been taught that Hitler was bad. Sure, Stalin wasn't amazing \neither, but if I were asked who was worse, for me the answer is obvious. As \na result, all those who refer to Hitler collaborators and supporters as \n\"heroes\" are not exactly people who we enjoy too much. This is why whenever \nthere is an election of any kind, the country becomes polarised.\n\nThe problem of language, of course, is another very important issue. \nRussian-speaking population is concentrated in the East and South, but it \nis concentrated there very densely, especially in urban areas. Two largest \nEastern cities, Kharkov and Donetsk, have 1.5 and 1 million people, \nrespectively, and AT LEAST 99% there speak Russian, yet the Russian \nlanguage has literally no special rights there, no more than English or \nSwahili. If you go to a cinema, all foreign movies are shown only with \nUkrainian dubbing (and not too great, at that), and all Russian movies are \nshown with Ukrainian subtitles, which makes it even more ridiculous. If you \ngo to any government establishment for any reason, even though every single \nperson there speaks Russian, you'll be forced to fill in all the forms in \nUkrainian. If you buy medication, instructions are there in Ukrainian only, \nwhich constitutes problems for older people, who often don't understand it \nvery well. If you open a business and try to give it a Russian name, it may \ncreate some additional bureaucratic problems for you. Last winter I was \nwriting my master's thesis in the university in Donetsk. I was not allowed \nto write or present it in Russian. In fact, I was given an option to choose \nEnglish, German or French if I wanted to (and, of course, Ukrainian), but \nnot Russian, no.\n\nSo, for the past twenty years, people in the East despise the government \nfor either ignoring the language problem altogether or promising to do \nsomething and then not doing it at all. Only the last government of \nYanukovich did finally create a law about \"regional languages\", which, \ntechnically, did allow for some possibilities for the Russian language. It \nwas a very bad law, it was ridiculously ineffective and it didn't bring any \napparent changes. But at least it existed. (also, note that it didn't refer \nspecifically to Russian, but to any minority language) When the new \ngovernment came to power after the coup in February 2014, the parliament \nbecame under its control, as many people from the party of the previous \npresident either fled the city fearing for their lives, or changed sides. \nSo, what does the \"new\" parliament do? Well, LITERALLY on their very first \nday, they repeal that law. That, in my opinion, was the last straw that \nsparked the protests in the South and East, especially in Crimea, which \nlater gave Russia the excuse to go there. The law, by the way, was returned \nin a few weeks, I think, but by that time it was far too late.\n\nSo yeah... quite a long text I got here for a random youtube comment... but \nhere you go, an opinion from a person from Eastern Ukraine who disapproves \nof the original Kiev protests and the February coup.",

I have absolutely no doubt that the West \nhas been manipulating Ukraine for years, in fact since the end of the Cold \nWar. Equally, I have no doubt that Russia has been doing the same. However, \nRussia can not actually seize land like that, if only because it escalates \nthe conflict into military action and risks retaliation from the West. \nThink what that would look like... a war with Russia over such a stupid \nlittle squabble. millions of people could potentially die, and the \n'leaders' who started it would be just fine. We have for decades only \nfought the kind of enemy that can't afford a real air force. I don't think \nmany people have any real conception of what a modern World War would look \nlike. If you fight another developed nation with modern technology, you \nwon't have a lingering occupation against petty insurgency, you will lay \nwaste to continents. Nothing is worth that kind of loss.\n\nWhat I think should happen in these situations is that referenda on \nindependence should be called for a year or two down the road, and \nagreements drawn that both sides will provoke no further disturbance in the \nmeantime, so everyone can calm the fuck down and remove the threat of war. \nThen, if there really is a majority in the east that wants to join Russia, \nthey can show through clean, independently monitored elections, and get \ntheir wish. Not everyone will be happy, but these spur of the moment \nreferenda are not at all legitimate, no more than the Svoboda coup was.

America has its problems for \nsure..but Russia just plain terrifies me...And too, what gets lost in \ntranslation here...is Ukraine in general.

Second - you call Crimean case \"invasion' - HOW \nCAN IT BE if Crimeans want to be with Russia, if you thing referendum was \nmanipulated - GO TO CRIMEA and ASK PEOPLE. Plus, Russia didn't send the \ntroops there - it was SELF-DEFENCE groups of Crimean Russians themselves \nbecause they ALWAYS feel petriotic to Russia, because of history. Imagine, \nthe situation was THAT bad that they didn't care about economical ties with \nUkraine and now Russia helps to keep their independance from Ukraine and \nbuilds the bridge in Kertch. More than that, you should understand that \nRussians ans russian-speaking ukrainians is almost same thing. 90% in \nUkraine speak both languages as native - some thing that Ukrainian is \ncloser to them, some - Russian. And, again, stop calling the country \n\"regime\" if you just don't like the president. And you didn't tell the main \n- what is UPA, who is Bandera and what difference between east Ukraine and \nwest Ukraine - agin, not a single word, but THIS is the main reason of \ncurrend events! Ukraine can be stable only in neutral position, Russia was \nok with that, then WHY EU and USA started to push only on one side of \nukraine - west side, Ukraine is POLAR, you can't get entire Ukraine in EU \nand NATO, people will not agree in east!

My apologies, but that reply was addressed for +Ed \nO'Meara )))\n\nBut if you want examples... here are few from top of my head:\n\n-Shootings during the protests began much earlier and were done by both \nsides.\n-Protestors had a fare share of weapons from west part of the country, \nwhere far right movement activists were raiding police posts. \n-Yanukovich and opposition on 21st of February, organised by EU signed an \nagreement to end political crisis. Yanukovich agreed to that, because of \nthe shooting. Among many things that agreement required both parties to \nleave streets of Kiev. However when Ukrainian police did so, protesters \ninstead of going home as agreed, started taking over key buildings and \ncontrol. At the same time Ukrainian president fled the country.\n-Russia still does not recognise temporary government, because no official \nimpeachment procedure was ever made and technically Yanukovich is still a \npresident. Russian position was that a coup organised partially by \nnationalists, who now openly demanded to do all sort of nasty things to be \ndone to the ethnic Russians in the east. \n\nFew other examples, not as important to what is happening but still:\n-John also mentioned that poisoning skyrocketed since Putin came to power, \nbut Litvinenko aside (and still not proven, only allegations), I don't know \nof a single case when something like that would occur.\n-Another line that I is inaccurate is when John mention that when in 2006 \nRussia cut off gas supply to Ukraine only because of its \"friendliness with \nthe west\". He forgot to mention that previously Ukraine, was receiving a \nbillion dollar worth of gas discount, paying third of what rest of Europe \nwas. When Ukraine and its new leader decided to break close ties with \nRussia and get very close with Europe, there was no political/economical \nreason for Russia to continue offering that discount. Problem started when \nUkraine refused to pay any price increases and to seek any compromises. \nThat angered Kremlin, who was already fuming with the whole \"revolution\" a \nyear earlier right in its backyard. Eventually Gazprom, said you either pay \nwhat we say or find your gas somewhere else. You know how that story ended. \nRussia switched the gas for a bit, Ukraine had no choice, but to accept new \ntariff, which still were a third less than what Europe was paying.\n\nP.S. and there is so much more to say.",

(WAY more \nin terms of fuel subsidies in total value than all the financial help the \nUS and the EU pledged to give to Ukraine IF it privatised its industries, \nno doubt for Western companies to come swooping in)\n6) Russia was a very sure fuel source for Ukraine, and a very important \ntrade partner. \n7) The protests themselves were thought to have been aggravated by outside \nsources.\n\n\nLikewise, some points to go against the West:\n\n1) The Propaganda was disgustingly obvious. Everyday I would see and hear \nof news outlets barely stopping short of outright insulting Putin and \ncalling him an imbecile. Every major news outlet adopted a hugely \nsubjective tone. Zero objectivity was present...\n2) The US is no longer classified as any sort of Democracy by top \nuniversities in the world. It is now an outright oligarchy; and yet US \nmedia vehemently support the idea that Russia's oligarchy has to fall.\n3) The US has toppled democratically elected governments to be replaced \nwith dictatorships due to corporate lobbying (thus the term bana republic \nwas born).\n4) The US has puppeted countless countries, but simply hasn't annexed them, \nleaving them to economic ruin after invasion, and allowing US corporations \nto come swooping in. Russia annexes a territory full of Russians that is \nimportant to the country's NEAR HOME geopolitical security and immediately \nannounces a very hefty investment plan.\n\nHonestly, I'm being completely objective here.

By 1800, \nlittle more than 50 years after first Russian contact, the Unangax \npopulation had been reduced by some 80 percent, to about 2,500 people. \nBattles between Unangax and Russians, Russian atrocities, forced Unangax \nlabor, and introduced diseases all took their toll, and no part of \ntraditional Unangax culture was left unchanged. In the realm of \nsubsistence, many traditional activities continued through this time, but \nsome important shifts took place. Because many men were forced to work for \nfur-hunting companies in the region, women and children took on increasing \nresponsibilities for providing their families with foods and resources.\nWith population loss came far fewer occupied settlements and the \nconsolidation and relocation of many villages. By the end of the Russian \nera in 1867, only approximately 17 Unangax communities remained, a number \nthat, with some fluctuation, declined until today. At the same time, social \nand religious changes were also imposed. The earlier matrilineal kinship \nsystem fell apart. Traditional leadership structures were used by Russian \ncolonizers for their own purposes, with Unangax leaders soon finding \nthemselves serving in the often difficult role of middlemen between their \nown people and the dominant Russian economic interests. Hand in hand with \nthese changes came a new religion, Russian Orthodoxy. By the later \neighteenth century, even before the first Russian Orthodox priests had \narrived from Russia, Unangax were being baptized into the church by Russian \nlaymen, and Russian Orthodoxy quickly became the sole religion of the \nregion.\"\n\nEvery nation has done crimes, why would Russia deserve special treatment \nwhen discussing such things? \nNow, what was that you were saying about spreading misinformation? ;)\n\nIf you require further reading let me know, I have a wealth of sources =) \nThough I am sure you are more than capable in researching the topic. Next \ntime think twice before accusing someone of spreading lies... Especially if \nyou have not looked heavily into the subject material.",

I've met irrational \nnationalists like you who put your nationalism before even God or Jesus \nChrist. \nYes, nationalists like you can throw words around like \"kremlin stooge\" but \nfacts often escape you.  I'll do the same as you.   Uneducated Nazi \nNationalist!!   In the USA, the Nazi's who wear all the symbols are usually \nvery low on the socio-economic scale.   I assume the same in your case.\nKiev is a disaster.   The economy is a disaster.   Economic activity is \ndown 40%.   Don't get off your butt and do something about it, just blame \nRussia though, that can help.  Now the IMF has its fangs in your \nbusiness.

That would allow them to do the referendum vote that they just \ndid. Considering Crimea is almost 70% Russian, has Russia's only entry into \nthe Black Sea, and is a pretty popular tourist spot for Russian citizens it \nmakes sense why Russia would invade the region.\n\nThe question then is Russia going to invade Eastern Ukraine. Personally I \nthink the new Ukrainian government should offer to sell some of the Eastern \nterritories of Ukraine to Russia as an offer of good will. It would remove \nthe majority of Russian descended Ukrainians which would make it much \neasier for Western Ukraine to integrate with the EU. It will also diffuse \nany possibility of a civil war breaking out. I doubt that they will \nwillingly give up more territory though.",

I've actually investigated some capitalist accusations and \nfound little foundations in reality. For instance capitalists love to cite \nthat the death tolls of the holodomor  as around 7mil. This statistic \nactually has its origins in Nazi propagandists for the purpose of making \nHitler look better than Stalin under the premise of that Hitler killed 6mil \nin 4yrs Stalin killed 7mil in 1yr, Hitler is therefore better than Stalin. \nNow if the questionable origins of this statistic aren't enough an \nhistorical analysis of Ukrainian population growth can provide clear \nevidence against it. In 1926 the population of ethnic Ukrainians was \n23,218,860 and then 13yrs later the population was 23,667,509. Now looking \nat this it becomes evident that the Holodomor did indeed happen to some \nmagnitude else the ethnic Ukrainian annual growth rate was \n34,511people/year. But when we account for this statistic of Holodomor \n1932-1933 death tolls then the population of that year would be around \n16,158,860 with full recovery to Pre-famine levels by 1939. Implying an \nannual growth rate of 1.25mil/year, you may look at this and say,\"That \nsounds reasonable.\" but when you compare this with Ukrainian growth rates \nduring the later half of the century you observe that during the 60's the \ndecade growth rate was 3.84mil/decade with an average annual growth rate of \n.384mil/year, that during the 70's the decade growth rate was \n2.88mil/decade with an average annual growth rate of .288mi/year, and \nduring the 80's the decade growth rate was 1.92mil/decade with an average \nannual growth rate of .192mil/year. These are far smaller growth rates at a \nmuch later period than the 30's annual growth rate of 1.25mil/year. What \nthis indicates is that either this statistic for Holodomor death tolls is \ncompletely inaccurate for it would imply a Pre-industrial growth rate far \nexceeding that of several Post-industrial growth rates, which is absolutely \nludicrous. Or it indicates that Stalinist policies of collectivizing \nagriculture are 5 times more beneficial than any capitalist agricultural \npolicy. Leaving you to choose between the lesser of two \"evils\" on what the \nactual truth is, either your a liar or you believe in idiotic policies.\"\nDon't spout bs just cause you read it in a book written by a senile \nconservative economist while he had his dick sucked by a stripper and \nsoaked in a jacuzzi.",

                "text": "Crimea's history goes back a bit further. The Tatars (of Turkish ethnicity) \nwere the first documented colonisers of Crimea. When the Ottoman Empire \nemerged, they were essentially left alone (being allied to Turkey) and for \nover a hundred years were the main suppliers of Slavs for the Ottoman \nEmpire's slave trade, running frequent raids into Eastern Ukraine and \nwestern Russia.\n\nCatherine the Great arrived, and Russia spent much of the next 170 years \nkilling / starving / forcibly migrating Tatars from the territory and \nmoving Russians in (OK, you can justify them doing it to begin with, but \nisn't 170 years a bit long to be taking your revenge on a population?). It \nwas only with Gorbachov's Perestroika reforms that some Tatars started \nmoving back, with more following Ukraine's independence - although still \nrelatively small in number, as obviously by-and-large they couldn't return \nto their ancestral homes.\n\nMeanwhile, with Ukraine as a whole, I've heard rumours that during \nYanukovich's negotiations with the EU and Russia, Russia was open to \ntripartite negotiations but the EU wasn't.  Whether that's true or not, if \nUkraine had been able to engage in tripartite negotiations for some money \nfrom both the EU and Russia, that may have quelled both camps - especially \nif Ukraine stated from the outset that while it was interested in trade \nagreements / economic alliances, it wouldn't join a political alliance on \neither side.\n\nMore recently, when the two Eastern provinces unilaterally declared their \nindependence, Kiev reacted in just about the worst way you could expect \nthem to if they were interested in maintaining the unity of the country \n(which you'd think they'd want given the two regions are the economic \npowerhouse of Ukraine), with shelling towns and the Odessa debacle. Then \nagain, there are elements in the separatist factions who yearn for the old \nsoviet days when the economy was stronger but dissenting opinions from the \nleadership's were discouraged (to put it mildly).\n\nAs with the events of WWII, it's likely the majority of the population are \ncaught in a catch-22 situation: do you ally with the tyrant in the West or \nthe tyrant in the East? In WWII, even if they didn't support either, when \nthe relevant tyrant's armies started marching into the country, it made \nsense to at least pretend to be allied with them to maximise their chances \nof staying alive and being left alone. Of course, if a town was occupied by \nfirst one group then the other, things got complicated...\ufeff",

In fact a large chunk of territory occupied by turkey \nwas origionally Greek. So technically the tartars stole that land from \nGreece, and Russia liberated Crimea. The unfortunate fact is the tartars \ncompletely exterminated the Greeks in Crimea when that happened, and Greece \nitself was ocupied by Turkey. So for all reasons of practicality Russia had \nto keep it. Plus when Russia was liberating countries in the Balkans from \nthe ottomans, including Greece, the Greeks never really asked for the land \nback. But they do want to take back Asia Minor from the turks, who really \nbelong in their homeland mongolia. And if Turkey decides to have a war with \nGreece, I am 100% sure that Russia will intervene, kick turkey back to \nmongolia, and give back Asia Minor. That will compensate for not giving \nback Crimea to Greece, even though no Greeks don't live there anymore. \nAlso, when it comes to mass murder, those were commited by the soviet \ngovernment, which goes against everything Russian. No doubt God will judge \nSoviet authorities for their numerous atrocities, but Russia itself, and \nits government, from the Romanov dynasty, to the Federation, aside from \nBoris Yeltsin, remain good in God's eyes.

There is a sentiment \nthat Russia should reunite the USSR. Ukrainians in the west want better \nlives. They are tired of being pawns.

Russia has been imperialist since the time of \nthe czar, many people are still imperialist in Russia and want to expand \ntheir borders, but there are also many people who want to live in peace \nlike the 50 000 Russians in Moscow who were protesting against the Crimea \nintervention. All dictators have fallen, the ones still in power will share \nthe same faith(goes both ways).",

They would have to hide, burry in the fields , food that they \nharvested because Soviet soldiers would come and take ALL the food and \nanimals and literally leave them to starve.

The Spanish \npeople mostly supported Franco, not the Republican government. And he'd \nwon. And stayed in power until 70s.\nPoland was not divided by it's own choice. It was a single country, which \nwas divided by it's neighbors, when it was in a crisis. One of those \ncountries was the Russian Empire. The turmoil, caused by the Russians in \nthat area goes a long was back. Evidenced today is the fact, that Russians \nstill divide countries along imagined lines of any splinter groups, as long \nas those groups support them, while stomp out any such movements inside of \ntheir own empire. \"Federation\", I mean.\nAnd I am well aware, that Putin uses exactly the same polemic, as Hitler \ndid, and that the Russians support him in exactly the same way, as Germans \nsupported Hitler. Putin even had his own Olympic, and it was even under \nstress due to certain controversies, and after that he reenacted the \nSudetes Crisis, almost to the letter.\nSO, no wonder some people are even ready to excuse Hitler, and even think \nhim as a \"good leader\". After all - if they won't, then they'll be forced \nto admit to double standards between one leader, and another.\nThe British involvement in the Russo-Japanese is a myth though. Russians \nhad lost due to the colonial nature of the war, and complete inability to \nsupply their forces that far, while the Japanese were right next to the \nplace.\nThe only apparent involvement was the training and the ships, bought from \nthe Royal Navy. While the Russians did that with the French. Still do to \nthis day, actually.\nThe people of Crimea spoke loudly and convincingly in the 1990, deciding to \nstay with the country of their choice.\nAnd until Russians staged the so called \"referendum\", with no chance for \nthe actual choice, no campaigns, no chance for one side to present itself, \nno democracy at all. Only with the armed people all over the place, and the \nunsaid threat \"if you won't chose us - it'll continue\".\nMobster wars, mobster methods.\nImperial ambitions.\nMost of the problems in the Eastern Europe is due to the said ambitions of \nthe Russians, the only Empire to survive 20th Century. At least in the \nminds of it's people. Or, rather, in the minds of the warmongering \npeace-hating drones, who support the Putin's Propaganda and bend history to \nsuit their own needs.

                    "text": "+LeeNTien\nYour first statement is a distortion. In the Spanish Civil War in the \n1930's Russia and Germany were on opposite  sides. Sure Poland was split \nbut it was divided before that anyhow by ethnic differences. The turmoil in \nthat area goes back a long way. Evidenced today by the fact Poland would \nnot want back the West of Ukraine and the West of Ukraine would not want to \ngo back. The West of Ukraine always had more in common with Russia than \nPoland. Easy to pick on Germany for WW2 but what about Britain and France \nafter WW1 and before that for centuries. It was supposed to be an \narmistice. An armistice that left Germans almost starving until Hitler came \nalong and told Britain and France to get stuffed. If I had been a German at \nthe time I also might have been tempted to vote for Hitler based on what he \nsaid publicly. Germans had had a gut-full of being manipulated and pushed \naround by Britain and France for centuries. All of Europe in effect shares \nthe blame for WW1. Not just Germany. One event normally leads to another. \nHit me in the face repeatedly and the day will come when I have had enough \nand hit back. Just remember France without provocation attacked the \nPrussian [German] States in 1870. Britain if it was so moral and righteous \nshould have sided with Germany when that happened. No they just sat back \nknowing the French were trying to do what they would have liked to do. Keep \nGermany from becoming the strong nation it had a right to be. Finally \nGermany has achieved its rightful place in Europe. One of the leaders. \nThat's all Germans have ever wanted. There rights. Remember also Britain in \n1905 sided with Japan out of spite to try to bring down an emerging Russia. \nThat alliance of convenience resulted in the virtual destruction of the \nRussian Navy. Was that just when all Russia was doing was what Britain had \nbeen doing for centuries. Trying to make Korea a Colony of Russia which \nJapan was also trying to do. Were any of those actions justified.  No! \nBritain being two faced as usual. History affects attitudes and subsequent \nevents. The most important thing in the long term is for people to have \nthere say based on the circumstances at the time. The people of Crimea have \nspoken loudly and very convincingly after being denied a say in the early \n1990's thanks to Russia standing up for there rights. Not like the USA who \nwanted to deny them there democratic right. The people of East Ukraine are \nnow trying to have there say but as usual are being denied that right by \nthe Kiev Junta and the USA. Forget the recent elections. Only just over 50% \nof all of Ukraine voted in the most important election for over 20 years. \nThat says it all. No election held during a Civil War has any credibility. \nThose who did not vote are the true majority. The US backed Junta in Kiev \ninitially acted no better than Stalin in many ways. Worse than Stalin in \nmany ways. What did you expect the people of East Ukraine to do. Sit down \nand accept there draconian first actions. They were only in effect an \nillegal caretaker Government. Do you expect Russia not to support the East \nwhen almost 1 million fled to Russia as refugees trying to escape the \nactions of the US and British installed illegal Junta in Kiev. It was not \nEast Ukraine that threw out a democratically elected President and put an \nunbalanced Junta in control of Ukraine. They had the decency when the \nCorrupt Pro West factions won in Ukraine to not violently overthrow it. \nThey sat and waited until the next election. Russia and Putin put up the \nonly feasible solution for Ukraine from day one. Ignored by the USA and \nBritain in there normal bully boy imperialistic ways. A united Ukraine with \n2 autonomous regions. West and East.  Just like in Canada. Crimea is \nRussian and should never ever have been forced to stay in Ukraine in the \nearly 1990's by the West.  Most of the major problems in the World today \nhave there origins in British and french and now USA imperialist attitudes. \n5th Generation Australian.",

Total of severe \nconditions during the Nazi occupation (hunger, disease, overwork) in Russia \nhas killed more than 42 million people.
