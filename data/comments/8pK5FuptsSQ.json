If (theoretically) the \nhuman race prevented people with Schizophrenia from having children, would \nthat at least largely eliminate the disorder from future generations?  \nCould the same be done with other genetic diseases?\n\nFrom an ethical point of view, I don't see that it would be wrong, either.  \nNot having children isn't a bad thing, and not being allowed to have \nchildren may not be pleasant, but the other option is to do nothing, and \nallow the conception of individuals who will inevitably suffer.

                    "text": "+TheOtherGuys2 The problem as I see it simply, how do we choose who should \nnot be allowed to procreate? Denmark had a program stemming from the \n19...20s I think, where people with low IQ (aka the mentally disabled) we \ninterned and in many, many cases forcefully sterilised. It went on until \nthe... 60-70s. The problem here was that most of the people seen as \nmentally disabled at the time were simply poor and uneducated. While I hope \nhumanity has learned a lot more about mental problems since then, we still \nrun the risk of becoming not only dictatorial but simply wrong. How do we \nchoose who gets to procreate?Depression and anxiety can also be genetically \nlinked, will they also be prevented from procreating? What about those with \nthe genetic disposition but no symptons? Will we run a gene test on the \nwhole population to figure out? What those with schizophrenia but without \nthe genetic disposition?\n\nNot to mention, like you mentioned further into the dicussion, once we \nstart trying to purge ourselves of genetic imperfections, where will it \nstop? People with genetic disposition to be obese? Colour blind? Asthma or \ndiabetes?\n\n\nSo yeah, I totally see your logic but getting that ball rolling through law \nis not really something I want to risk. We already discourage severely \nmentally disabled people to get voluntarily sterilised (mostly since they \nwouldn't be able to take care of a child and so would have it removed once \nborn regardless) and I think that anyone who's told they have a genetic \ndisposition towards something think's twice about having children already, \nso...

Of course ethically speaking and given the lack of knowledge \nwe have, we'd have no way to be sure it would work, and therefore it would \nbe unethical.  The main idea was the question of if it could possibly \nwork.  Other comments have explained that no, it probably wouldn't, because \nit's a mixture of genetic traits that cause it.  I can understand that, and \nthus would never suggest actually carrying out the eugenics practice I \ndescribed.\n\nI would agree that forced sterilization would be unethical as well, even if \nwe did know everything about genetics that we needed to.  It's no more \nethical than involuntary slavery.  But one argument that I keep hearing \nfrom people is that \"it's unfair to the people who wouldn't be born\" and \nvariations on that.  To which I would have to respond \"No more so than a \ncondom\"\n\nOn the other hand though, if I had a condition that had a significantly \nhigh chance of being passed on genetically, and was detrimental to my \nhealth/life/well-being, I think I would voluntarily choose not to have \nchildren.

                    "text": "+TheOtherGuys2 This fails on exactly what eugenics has always (and will \nalways) failed on. We do not have anywhere near the necessary scientific \nknowledge to act upon it. We do not know which genes are responsible, we do \nnot know which genes are not, we cannot diagnose people who are only \ncarriers, and thus the exercise is redundant; yes, instance of a particular \ndisorder may decrease slightly, but it's very fair to say that without the \nrequisite knowledge we would be putting countless people through entirely \nundue and unimaginable suffering to alleviate only the potential suffering \nof future generations. You're only dealing in likelihoods after all; two \nschizophrenic parents do not necessitate schizophrenic children. \n\nAs a secondary reason that eugenics is absurd, it narrows the field of \nhuman mutation, which is simultaneously guaranteed to narrow our chances of \nsurvival versus new illnesses (and current ones), changes in environment \netc. We know, for example, that sickle cell anaemia functions as a strong \nresistor (not cure nor preventative, but resistance nevertheless) to \nHIV/AIDS. If there were a similar illness in our future (which likelihood \nis, there is) that began to eradicate the human population, it's only due \nto seemingly negative traits that life may be able to persist beyond such \nan epidemic. We do not know/have the ability to research what it is about \nthose of us who are left now that made us resistant to the Plague, as it \nrather efficiently killed all of us without whatever genetic mutation that \nwas. It could be that people without that genetic mutation had an almost 0% \nrate of depression, or anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. If we had attempted \nto sterilise (literally or through governmental mandate) those of our \nancestors who suffered from depression, humanity could have been wiped out. \nBoth are only theoretical suppositions, but it ought to be obvious that \nwithin the infinite expanse of time and space, these situations most likely \nwill arise. If our ethics dictate that the survival of the human race is \neven equal in importance with the judicial use of public money, it's our \nethical responsibility to ensure mutation is accepted, tolerated, and \nsupported. \n\nBut since I think the point here is much more significantly ethical than it \nis scientific, let's look at the actual ethical conundrum. Suppose these \nthings were not factors. In a world where we had absolute knowledge of \nexactly which genes caused Schizophrenia, divine wisdom that these \nmutations would never in any way prove beneficial for humanity, and where \nfoetal screening was unnecessary as we could guarantee that a person would \nhave a schizophrenic child if they bred, should we allow them to breed? \n\nThe answer's a resounding, 'YES!' isn't it? At what point did we gain the \nauthority to take the most natural action we can perform in our lifetimes \nand start classifying who was and who was not worthy of this? At what point \ndid we become knowledgeable and wise enough to deem a life lived with \nSchizophrenia a life so unpleasant as to be not worth living? I have plenty \nof friends with Schizophrenia who would spit on you for the suggestion. \nWould we also be applying this profound wisdom to whether or not couples \nshould be allowed to breed based upon other factors, like health, \neducation, lifestyle etc? The great human success story is always fraught \nwith illness. So many brilliant people only ever came to their brilliant \nconclusions courtesy of the disabilities and illnesses they have suffered. \nWould their contributions to humanity have come from another source if not \nfrom them? Perhaps, but we've no evidence to support the idea that they \nwould. \n\nAnd in final conclusion, if you still don't get it, and you still think \nthere's a rationale for massively increasing the amount of human suffering \nin the world (because I'm fairly certain as a person who does suffer mental \nhealth issues, my suffering is balanced by the rest of the things in my \nlife... The suffering of those couples who discover they can't have \nchildren of their own, is not... And one of the main things that does \nbalance out those lows in my life is the high that (if I am so fortunate) \nwill be having children...) just remember: we do not have that perfect \nsituation described above... We will not EVER have that knowledge, that \nwisdom, that guarantee. We'll always be under-informed, scrabbling around \nin the dark hoping our guesses will make some positive change. Why not \ndevote our guesses to things with a much higher chance of success, or \nthings without the guarantee of collateral damage?",

Terms are not exactly officially defined like the \nDSM has done in the past, and psychopathy/sociopathy is not technically a \ndiagnosis, but they are all still constructs that are heavily researched in \nforensic populations and there is talk of bringing them back as part of a \n\"spectrum\" classification to ASPD. There's also some really cool theories \non evolution and how that ties in to psychopathy. The rest is spot on and \nTHANK YOU for this video. \ufeff",

                    "text": "Hello Courtney\nMy father suffers from \"paranoid schizophrenia\" (schizophrenia with \nparanoia). I did not grow up with him (unlike you, I guess) and can \ntherefore not say what living with someone with that condition might feels \nlike. I never smoked weed or did any other drugs. I rarely drank alcohol, \nalmost alway very moderately, way below average. I just did not feel the \nurge to try drugs or get drunk. I found it stupid. At age 20 or 21 I \nrealized that not smoking weed (the most common and socially accepted drug \nwhere I live) was a very good idea in retrospect. Because smoking weed can \nlead to schizophrenia. Or to put it more exactly: If you have the \npredisposition, it can lead to an outbreak of schizophrenia. So I decided \nto never do drugs, just to be as safe as possible. For about eight years, I \ndid not know more than that. I don't know why I did not do some research. \nBecause in these years in my mind I had this more or less fifty percent \nchance of having inherited the disposition from my father. Today I know \nthat there is only a probability of about 10 to 15 or 10 to 20% to inherit \nthe disposition if only a one of your parents (biological father or mother) \nhas schizophrenia. That was quite a relief. Also I found out that things \nlike too much stress can cause schizophrenia if you have the genetic \ndisposition. So I try to take care of myself stress-wise and just stick \nwith not taking any drugs. My advice to you is to do some research, some \ncalculating, not do drugs, try to avoid stress and always have in mind \n(somewhere far in the back, otherwise it might easily cause unnecessary \nworries and - in your case - \"dangerous\" stress) that you have these \ndiseases in your family. Also take care with anti-psychotic drugs \n(anti-depressants, tranquilizers etc.) and inform your doctor about your \nfamily member's conditions, even if you are not directly asked about them.  ",

Usually portraied as moody, broody, mysterious types... who \ncan overcome their sadness through friendship! When in reality it ends in \nthe person killing themselves after decades of lethargy and unhappiness. \nThose suffering from depression already hear a \"c'mon, just cheer up! Just \nbe happy, it's not hard!\" every day from family, friends and others around \nthem... even though they just fucking can't. And every \"cheer up\" ends up \nbeing just another stab at your self conscience, making you wonder why you \ncan't be normal, after all everyone tells you it's so easy.\nOr OCD. The neat freaks, tidy, always on time, a few funny ticks.... Yeah. \nGood luck holding on to any job when you have to go wash your hands 30 \ntimes an hour and being absolutely helpless to change that. Good luck \nfinding a girl/boyfriend that keeps up with all your ticks, and a circle of \nfriends that understands that you cannot come to the movies because you \nkeep messing up the house-leaving ritual and so cannot leave the house.\n\nYes, if you're only talking in a small circle of friends with one person \nafflicted with \"whatever-disorder\" it doesn't matter much, that person will \nprobably understand. But on the large scale? You're making life even more \nunbearable for those that suffer from these conditions.",

You might fake it, \nknowing logically that it is bad based on what you've learned. But on a \ntrue emotional level you don't care at all.\n\nPsychopathy is the condition in which causing harm is granting your \npleasure. You basically enjoy causing suffering to those around you.\n\nWhile a sociopath can be harmful to society, he can at least function on a \nlogical level, and might never actually cause harm to anyone.\nBut a psychopath is actively looking for ways where he or she can ruin the \nlives of others for their own personal gain, be it materialistic or simply \non an emotional level.\n\nFor example children who torture animals when they are little have clear \npsychopathic behavior tendencies. A child who simply doesn't care about \ntheir dog, or cat or rabbit dying are merely sociopaths.\n\nI could be totally wrong on this here, maybe all of it is psychopathy but \nyou have different gradients of intensity.\nBut at least this is how I always understood it.\ufeff",

At the time, sociopath was the real medical term. So the \nunderstanding you describe came about. The thing to keep in mind is that \n\"Sociopath\" is itself an outdated term. It's not even included in the \ncurrent DSM (the diagnostic book for psychology). Sociopathy is now \nunderstood to be much more complicated and can refer to various personality \ndisorders.

It's like there are 2 \"paths\" to kill people. What I describe \nhere is focused on the extreme of killing people.\n\nThe 1st path is killing for the sake of killing/pleasure. These people have \nabnormal ways of feeling the joy ( hence they have psychological disorder ) \nand they can find that pleasure in killing others. They don't feel the same \nway that normal people feel. They also cannot fake it to look normal. \nBecause they don't have the ability to conceal their twisted feelings, \npsychopath usually kill because they find the joy in killing (or because of \nemotional unstable that they tend to act without clear thinking of the \nconsequences). In short, their motive is mainly caused by acting with their \nemotions. \n\nThe 2nd path is the master of disguise. These people are a lot smarter than \npsychopath because they can appear normal in other people' eyes, can show \nsympathy to the death but deep down, these affections are just fake and \nmimicked and they don't actually feel sad. They can kill people, for \nwhatever twisted reasons but not for the joy of killing cause like i said, \nthey don't really feel any emotions and can only fake it to look like a \nnormal person. Their motive for killing usually is because of some \nsophisticated believes or ideas.\nHannibal in my opinion is the perfect example for the sociopath. He is a \npsychiatrist, which is the perfect irony for someone who pretend to \nunderstand how emotion works. His motive for killing people is also not \ncome from the pleasure of killing. Hannibal kills to eat, which then add a \nlot to \"I don't give a damn about those people' death, they are only pigs \nin my eyes\".\n\nOf course, Psychopath or Sociopath are all in the psychological disorder - \ndisorder of not having normal felling and emotions. But it appears that \nthey recently change it so there is only psychopath now. In the books, \nHannibal is described as a \"pure sociopath\", but in the film adaptation \nthey change it to \"pure psychopath\". :\\\n\nAnyway, glad that i find someone who thinks the same as me to share some of \nmy thoughts about this topic, even thought we both might be wrong. :)",

I \ndon't like it when people use it only to describe someone who is a \nclean-freak, though, since OCD can come in many different \"flavors\". For \nexample, my OCD comes to food (and other things, but mainly food). I don't \nlike people even sneezing around me when I'm eating, and when they do, I'll \nnot only freak out on the inside, but I'll often times stop eating for the \nrest of the day. The sneezing thing is mostly gone, but even just someone \ntouching my plate/cup, etc. will make me not eat... for the rest of the \nday. Honestly, it sucks, and I really wish I could get rid of it \naltogether, and my medicine really doesn't help. It used to suck more when \nI was a little kid, because I used to go to birthday parties and not eat \nthe cake... I wouldn't even eat my own cake. My OCD also is bad, because it \nmakes me a very picky eater. I only have a variety of three to four foods \nin my diet, and most I'll rarely change it. Worse more, it has to be cooked \na specific style, look a certain way, and taste exactly the same as it \nalways has. Otherwise, I just won't eat it. I remember camping once, and I \nflat out didn't eat for most of the weekend, because I threw up at the \nthought of eating something not regular to me. \n\nProbably worse than everything listed above, I have had asthma my entire \nlife. I've used inhalers since the fourth grade to stop from, you know, \nhaving an asthma attack. However, my OCD for food and things like that kind \nof went the same for my inhalers. This meant that if someone as even \ntouched the inhaler, I wouldn't use it and we had to call in a new one. \ufeff",

For me it was just \nrefusing to flick the light switch or count my fingers, it may be harder \nfor you because you'll have to force yourself to do something, which is \nharder than forcing yourself to do nothing. You really have to trust that \nwhat your mind is telling you is wrong, and that everything will be fine if \nyou don't listen to it. It's like trying to come off from an addiction, \nthere will be 'withdrawal symptoms' as you'd expect with OCD, but my \ncompulsions are extremely reduced now, i only have very minor ones on \noccasion. \n\nOn occasion I'll still suffer badly from intrusive thoughts, but they're \nslowly becoming less frequent. It's now also a large part of my personality \nthat i wont do anything without knowing why I'm doing it. That's a positive \nthough, I can easily identify if I'm becoming addicted to something, and it \ngives me more insight into the workings of anything I'm doing.",

Right now, it's a spectrum disorder, with \neach person with autism somewhere on the spectrum based on how much it \naffects them. In the simplest terms, it is a strange wiring of the brain \ncompared to how it usually is. In more complicated terms: motor skills, \nsocial skills, verbal skills, etc may be weaknesses balanced with an \nunusually high aptitude in a narrow field (and sometimes more than one \nfield). STEM fields are the most common, but arts, history, and geography \nare also common fields. People like Thomas Jefferson, Albert Einstein, Mark \nTwain, Thomas Edison, and many other American heroes are believed to have \nautism (but we will never really know for sure), but today we have \nsuccessful people with autism in our modern world, like Bill Gates. Given \nthis, and the fact that I couldn't care less about politically correct \ncrap, I'd say that autism is both a disability and an \"antidisability\". \nTake this from someone who has been surrounded by kids with autism and \nliving with it for 16 years.",

Instead of using schizophrenic or bipolar to describe someone like \nthe figurative neighbour, use 'two-faced' or 'mercurial' or 'volatile' or \n'erratic'. Anything that actually describes their behaviour. Use a \nthesaurus if you really feel the need; there are several on the internet \nalone...\nIn my view, not being allowed to make jokes for fear of offending someone \nwhen that definitely was not your intention and when you don't belittle or \ndisrespect that mental condition either is a bit thought-policey. But you \nshould think about whether you really are being unnecessarily rude or \ndisrespectful to people who are already marginalized, or if you intended \nto, if you want to call yourself a good person, or 'nice'. Is it \nreinforcing your or anybody else's prejudice about others? Is there a \npossibility someone with OCD or schizophrenia or another disorder will hear \nyou and feel hurt, or then view you as someone not to be trusted or opened \nup to? Is your usage even vaguely correct? (Remember, schizophrenic does \n*not* merely mean acting erratically, as Hank explained.)\nThat said, the meaning of words and phrases changes over time, as do their \nconnotations. Is it still offensive and demeaning to call someone \nhysterical? How about calling someone a witch? A hooligan?",
