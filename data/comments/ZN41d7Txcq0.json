That he can't read music is not a radical claim, I doubt \nthe Spice Girls can read words, but is unfounded. He CAN read music, and \nplay the piano, and he wrote most of his own lyrics (and all the songs on \nhis latest album).\n\nI'm not a fan of his because I'm not a 12 year old girl. That's his fan \nbase. They play with dolls and only speak in whispers and screams. Why are \nyou listening to him, anyway? I don't care. But here's some facts about the \nperson you would not want to be.\nHe has about 53 MILLION dollars in the bank and is a venture capitalist \nwith a tech-heavy portfolio. His last concert movie made over $100 million \ndollars worldwide. He has the most-viewed video in the history of planet \nEarth with over 500 million views and when he tours makes about $600,000 \nper show. He's 19 and Canadian. He makes more in a year than anyone reading \nthis will make in a lifetime.\n\nNow, let's compare an apple to an orange.\n\nLudwig was the oldest of 3 boys to survive birth, 4 died, and was a child \nprodigy in music. His mother died when he was only 18 and his father became \na severe alcoholic. He became the breadwinner and went to court to get half \nhis father's salary to feed his brothers and himself while taking intense \nlessons and performing. He always had money problems and was frequently \nquite poor and sick. He had chronic stomach problems, went completely deaf \nby age 26 and frequently contemplated suicide, which he wrote about in \ngreat detail. His brother became sick and died and Ludwig had his nephew \ntaken from his mother by the court and sent to private school. The nephew \nattempted suicide shooting himself in the head, but surviving, then joining \nthe army without reconciling.\nHe had horrible but incredibly romantic experiences with women. Denied \nmarriage from his true love because he was a commoner and she was in a \nprivileged family  he wrote the moonlight sonata, #14. For another lost \nlove, he wrote F\u00fcr Elise.  After a performance of his finally realized \nninth symphony, he turned around to see a standing ovation thunderously \napplauding and he could not hear it at all, overwhelmed by sadness, he \nbegan crying uncontrollably.\nHe died at 56.\ufeff",

But eight notes \ncan be in a measure in 4/4 eight times, or take up an eighth of the \nmeasure, quarter notes take up half in 4/4 or Common, half takes half, \nwhole takes up the whole thing in common time, sixteenth notes take up \nsixteenths, etc. it starts to get more complicated when you get into non \n2^x type values, like how triplets can be 3 notes in an eighth note, \nquarter note, half note, or whole note depending on how they are notated, \nreally any basic note that is a 2^x styles of note vakue. But that is \ngetting into more intermediate not very beginner notation.",

Another name for it is common time, and \nsometimes instead of a \"4/4\" you'll see a large \"C\" where a time signature \nnormally sits. Most music you hear is in common time, so it is what the \nmath behind music is based on. A whole note fills an entire measure in 4/4 \ntime, a half note fills half a measure in 4/4 time, a quarter note fills a \nquarter measure in 4/4 time, and an eighth note fills an eighth of a \nmeasure in 4/4 time. Therefore, since a whole measure in 4/4 is four beats, \na whole note is four beats, half is two beats, quarter is one beat, eighth \nis half a beat.",
