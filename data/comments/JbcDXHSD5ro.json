                "text": "I'm a big fan of John Krasinski so by default, I follow Emily as well. I \nhave finally figured out what bothers me about Emily. She is not feminine. \nBeauty and femininity are not the same. I watch a lot of her interviews and \nher actions. Who says about their baby that they are \"Stinking Cute\". \nPlease don't tell me that is the way they describe cuteness in England. I \nfeel she has a lot of Tom Boy in her. She also says she doesn't cry easily. \nI'm not sexist but that, IMO, also is something woman, who are generally \nmore sensitive, do. Listen, I'm a fan of hers so this is not a bashing of \nEmily by any means. Just an observation.\ufeff",
