They exclusively recruit players that are good to \ngreat students. I know people find this hard to believe, but it's truly \nimpressive. Many of the players that they have signed recently are 3.5+ GPA \nguys and 25+ ACT guys. Pretty good for elite athletes.\n\nAs far as Michigan, we have recently tried to up our standards as well to \nensure that our team has more stability and less players unable to compete \nacademically. As a result, we have recruited against Stanford often, which \nis how I came to understand how rare an offer from Stanford is unless you \nhave great academics. Not every player we've signed has been a genius, \ndon't get me wrong, but many have been at or near the top of their class in \nhigh school.\n\nAdditionally, Michigan's basketball team has had a perfect graduation rate \nrecently (tops in the nation), with many of the players studying business, \nengineering, and the like.\n\nI know Cenk was just pulling names out of nowhere, but he may have picked \nbad examples by random chance, as these two schools actually do care to an \nextent. Again, I will not claim that every bball/fball player at UM is a \ngreat student, but far more are than you'd think (at least on the team \nnow). Stanford though, is one heck of a smart football program.\ufeff",

The \naverage person will get 20 right, which is typically where an NFLer falls.\n\nMy issue with this is, if these athletes can barely read, how can they \nread, comprehend, and answer the questions quick enough not to score well \nbelow 20?  Granted, some do, but some score very high, and most score \nbetween 16-26 (close to average).\n\nAnd it's not like the Wonderlic is a baby's test.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.\n\n\"Lets take a look at the reality the leaders have created relying on \ncreative people to hold peoples attention while the exercise of economy \ncontinues. \nAs everyone knows in their heart of truth economy is what exists outside \ntrue humanism its center is great and pats on the back which is worth more? \n\nThe greed fullfilled or the pats on the back? Of course greed is like any \nother addiction, without true contentment it can never be filled and of \ncourse I quote the literacy of the bible to convince one side of humanity \nthat what i say is true. The difference between this world and its nemesis \nworld is merely the success of the sponsored race. \n\nWith a playground agenda like economy this world will undoubtedly fail \nwithout intervention. A world with at least a foundation being set for a \nfamily initiative, will reach a crechendo of unbelievable heights of power, \nwhen I speak of power it is the power of good and pure things, the \npreservation of innocence, the preservation of planetary health, the \nbuilding of family values and the building of real adventure and games \nwhich are some of humanities favorite past times.\nIt comes down to a simple choice for each person yet only together can a \ntrue world exist fully in every life and in the holistic life. \n\nIf the majority isn't 100% then it is not a agreed upon subject and as we \nall know the majority has always been responsible for error, usually \nbecause of an emotional reaction to belief in the value of others compared \nto the majority hence democracy has always been bigotry and because of \nbigotry on this grand scale humanity is perceivably fragile. Existence in a \nreal world calls for reality not mere figments of professed reality from \nbiased bigots with their ever widening grins which hint of future hatred \nand murder. Decidedly an enemy only exists if there is a lack of adult \nconversation and understanding. \n\nCall yourself a man or woman and you gesture to the world that you are \nevolved from the monsters you were in ignorance of self worth and the power \nof fulfilled hearts in communicated worth beyond the weak shell (however \nbeautiful and stunning some are) I know its true that all centers of self \nare exactly the same within every eye if a black hole this to me speaks of \na starvation for love and guidance similar to the theory of black holes \ndoing what they are created to do to create new grand scenes across the \nuniversal canvas. \n\nPoetry for adults is in big creative and yet poetry for the young is in \nvery small and easy to understand and yet still potent created things.\"",

I don't see why TYT \nsees a problem with this when colleges are making millions off their \nathletic programs.\n\nThe problem with schools these days is they keep trying to throw all these \ngeneral education requirements on people who simply don't have an interest \nin them. Everyone is walking out of school with worthless degrees because \nthey aren't focused enough on what the really want to do in life. If people \nwant to be football players, let them! TYT hates athletes because they get \npaid so much money, well I'd like to see TYT try to do what they do.\n\nThe solution to fixing our education is to put a limit on student loans. \nWhen universities are guaranteed LESS money through student loans, they \nwill be forced to make cuts. I for one am not happy to have to pay \nthousands more on my tuition for philosophy and 2 years of a foreign \nlanguage when I am studying structural geology. Most of what schools teach \nin the gen ed requirements can be learned at home anyways...\ufeff",

The time commitment for sports is enormous; few people can do \nwell in both.\n- Related to the above, bad students when they're young are often steered \npreferentially away from academics. Then they have no hope of catching up, \neven if they aren't really that stupid.\n- Colleges are going for the best athletes, regardless of intelligence, so \neven if all other factors were level, they'd end up with plenty of \nmeatheads.
