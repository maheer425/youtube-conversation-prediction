What some companies do is \nthat they will lower the production cost for an item but not the item's \nshelf price. That way the company can have a larger net income and make \nmore money.\n\nWhat is more common though is that a company will do something in-between \nthese two methods, they will lower the production cost for an item as well \nas the item's shelf price, but they do not lower the shelf price as much as \nthey would in the first method so they still generate a greater net income. \nKeep in mind though that the size of this price reduction is completely up \nto the company and it could be large or small.\n\nAnd of course there is the fourth method in which a company lowers an \nitem's production cost, but raises its shelf price. For example the \nestimated production cost for a pair of Beats headphones by Dre is around \n$18.00 where as they are sold from $169.95 to $399.95.\n\nSecond, have you seen the unemployment rates? Yes, a price drop in items \nwould mean that the displaced workers do not have to work as hard to get \nsaid items, but what if they can't find any work at all? Short haul company \ntrucking (i.e. trucking for companies such as Target or Walmart) is \ncurrently one of the few jobs in which a college degree is not required and \nthere is a large demand for workers as well.\n\nBut with this new technology in place not only would the demand for workers \nshrink, but depending on what skill sets might be needed to operate said \ntechnology a college degree could be required for this occupation as well. \nAnd with the number of jobs that do not require college degrees \ndiminishing, where does that leave families that can not afford college \neducations.",
