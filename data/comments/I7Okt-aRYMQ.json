Learn the difference. \n\nBengalis are predominantly a blend Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. The turkic \nlineage may be prevalent in present-day Bangladesh due to years of isolated \nforeign administration.\n\nThe Aryans were from Eastern Europe, not Central Asia. They practised proto \nIndo-European paganism which later evolved into Vedic Hinduism in India and \nZoroastrianism in Persia. \n\nHinduism is native to the entire subcontinent. \nIslam is indeed an Arab concept as its origins lie in Arabia. As for \nMughals, I never said Mughals were Arabs. Babar was an\nIslamized Uzbek from Ferghana. \n\n\nIslamic empires/sultanates were characterised by enforcement of Sharia Law \non the lands they controlled and levying of heavy religious tax or jiziya \non non-Muslim communities so they were just as bad as the Hindu Caste \nsystem, if not worse. \n\ufeff\nIndian Bengali food is actually native to Bengal. There is no foreign \ninfluence whatsoever. ",

They barely take shower first of all, and that is important \nbecause they spend a lot of time with their pet animals. Then, they do not \ntake water when they poo. That is an ew. I had a white gf in Canada and one \nof the reasons for not wanting to marry her (and eventually breaking up) \nwas not because she would not be approved by my parents  but because I do \nnot want my children to grow by barely wiping their asses with paper , \nwhich is nasty. But the western media will always portray us as dirty and \nstinky and all that crap.\ufeff",

We usually have it with steamed rice, so the rice bolus tends \nto take care of the smaller bones while the larger ones are taken out \nduring the mashing of the fish. ^_^ It is a delicious fish, even with all \nthe bones, but there are some other delicacies you could try if you \nactually manage to find a traditional Bangladeshi family and get invited to \ntheir dinner (cause the variety in a home cooked meal is a lot better than \nthe generic ones in the restaurant and a lot more authentic). :)",

Focus is extremely \nimportant, as well as paying attention to the detail of the questions. \nSince the SAT has a time limit, you do need to kind of hurry...it's best to \nset a pace and keep that pace. If you can't answer a question then guess \nand come back to it, if you have time to come back to it then good...if not \nthen you've at least got an answer down. As for the actual content, you \ncannot be totally certain what to expect, it's best to study general \nsubjects in math, science, and English; as for reading when you're reading \nthat 1000 page book you should assess your understanding of the content of \nthe book and make any corrections, the book should definitely help you. You \nhave an entire month, I'd start small and start studying more and more up \nuntil the 8th. On the night of the 6th and 7th you should review everything \nyou have studied and make sure you've understood everything thus far.\n\nRemember, if you don't do good the first time...you can always retake it. \nAlso, we have the internet this day in age...Google is your best friend \nhere, Google will help guide you to your desired result and beyond.",

Both myself and my \nolder brother would have been lefties, but our mother worked hard and \nsternly to force us to use our right hand instead of our left, slapping our \nhands hard if she saw us eat with our left hand, etc. I noticed that \nsomeone here said that it is acceptable to use the left hand if one is \nusing a utensil, but when I was little (I'm almost sixty now) it WAS NOT. \nWhether you ate with your bare hands or used a utensil you still used your \nRIGHT hand, period.\n\nMy Dad talked about it to us for many years, especially myself because it \nresulted in me taking longer to learn how to write properly with my right \nhand than it did my brother. I had to employ a rather strange grip on the \npen/pencil in which I leaned it across the third finger of my right hand to \nsteady it as I was writing.\n\nIt resulted in my brother later doing most things with his right hand but \nsome things he would switch to left, such as when he was up at bat playing \nBaseball. As for myself. I instinctively use my left hand when handling \nanything that is heavy or commands a firm grip.",
