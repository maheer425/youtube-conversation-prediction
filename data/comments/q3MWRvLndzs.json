While I do think that religion does hold back our scientific \nprogress, I do not think that we should approach this by forcing people to \nabandon their beliefs, but rather by adjusting exactly how religions \npreach. I think that certain stories in holy scripture can be said in a way \nsimilar to that of, say, Aesop's fables, hopefully keeping it open to the \nopinions of theists and otherwise, and hopefully alleviating part of the \npersisting conflict between them.\n\nI think this because, in many cases, theists firmly stand by their beliefs \nas they fullheartedly, you know, believe in it. Epistemological solipsism \nis a perfect example of a non-religious belief that is difficult to prove, \ndisprove, convince someone of its falseness, or even comprehend. It \nrevolves around the fact that the only way we can prove anything is with \nour senses, beyond which there is no further evidence (even observational \ntools as we use our senses to perceive them too), therefore provoking an \nuncertainty of whether anything actually exists.\n\nIt's the same case with theistic religions. God is supposed to be \nincomprehensible for a simple human mind, only speaks in silence through \nchosen \"prophets\" and is only known after death, of which no one has lived \nto tell the tale (ha ha). In other words, it is a complete waste of time to \ntry to convince the 5.8 billion religious people in the world of an absence \nof any metaphysical men. The only time I am perturbed is when it interferes \nwith someone else's life negatively and without consent. Otherwise, I get \nalong with them fine.",

And, very roughly, two \nviews have been held. First, there is what is called the materialist view. \nPeople who take that view think that matter and space just happen to exist, \nand always have existed, nobody knows why; and that the matter, behaving in \ncertain fixed ways, has just happened, by a sort of fluke, to produce \ncreatures like ourselves who are able to think. By one chance in a thousand \nsomething hit our sun and made it produce the planets; and by another \nthousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life, and the right \ntemperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so some of the matter on \nthis earth came alive; and then, by a very long series of chances, the \nliving creatures developed into things like us. The other view is the \nreligious view. (*) According to it, what is behind the universe is more \nlike a mind than it is like anything else we know\nThat is to say, it is conscious, and has purposes, and prefers one thing to \nanother. And on this view it made the universe, partly for purposes we do \nnot know, but partly, at any rate, in order to produce creatures like \nitself\u2014I mean, like itself to the extent of having minds. Please do not \nthink that one of these views was held a long time ago and that the other \nhas gradually taken its place. Wherever there have been thinking men both \nviews turn up. And note this too. You cannot find out which view is the \nright one by science in the ordinary sense. Science works by experiments. \nIt watches how things behave. Every scientific statement in the long run, \nhowever complicated it looks, really means something like, \"I pointed the \ntelescope to such and such a part of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th \nand saw so-and-so,\" or, \"I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to \nsuch-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so.\" Do not think I am saying \nanything against science: I am only saying what its job is. And the more \nscientific a man is, the more (I believe) he would agree with me that this \nis the job of science\u2014and a very useful and necessary job it is too. But \nwhy anything comes to be there at all, and whether there is anything behind \nthe things science observes\u2014something of a different kind\u2014this is not a \nscientific question. If there is \"Something Behind,\" then either it will \nhave to remain altogether unknown to men or else make itself known in some \ndifferent way.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2\n\nThank you for that, now I know where you stand on Reason and it seems you \nhave a firm understanding of it.\n\nSuperstition and many stories told in Religious text do deify the laws of \nreason; everything from the Easter Bunny, to black cats crossing your path, \nto Moses turning water into blood deifies reason because they are things \nthat supposedly occur within our observable universe; we can test them and \nconclude if they are possible. The existence of a God is not so narrow. \nEven the definition of \"God\" is broad as God could mean the bearded man in \nthe sky, to an inter-dimensional \"force\", to simply an idea and everything \nin between. If God really is this \"being\" or \"force\" that exists outside of \nour observable universe or beyond, God cannot be observed or tested as far \nas his existence is concerned.\n\nSecondly, to reject reason in any given circumstance does not mean that \nperson is not capable of reason or is an unreasonable person. There were a \nfew occasions where I was walking or driving and a black cat would cross my \npath; many times, I would turn around or wait for someone else to cross \nthat path if I didn't have anywhere to be. However, here I am, recognizing \nthat believing in such a superstition is unreasonable. Superstition and \nReason are not compatible, but because a person believes in or holds some \nsuperstitious ideas does not make them unreasonable people.\n\nThe part where you criticize Buddhist Monks, the Catholic Church, the \nindustry around psychics and such is just silly, to be honest. The time you \nspent writing your 114 line comment could've been spent learning or helping \npeople. The money you used to buy the computer you typed it on could've \nbeen used for charity or books, the money and time you use to buy your \nhouse and move into it could've been used to help the needy, instead of \nbuying your meat at the market you could've bought a hunting rifle and shot \na deer that would feed you for months with a bullet that costs .30 cents \nand used the money you saved for charity, but you don't. If everybody did \nthese things, we would have more money and available labor than we'd know \nwhat to do with and they don't even involve religion in any way. Everyday, \nyou do things you don't NEED to do, buy things you don't NEED to buy but \nyou do. In your lifetime, you'll waste hundreds of thousands on internet, \nair conditioning, and gas when millions, if not billions, of people around \nthe world survive just fine without these things. Waving a magic wand and \nconvincing every person in the world to throw away their religious beliefs \nwould not change this fact.",

                    "text": "+Cozmolyne Obvious, isn't it? Reason tells us that the natural world is \nconsistent. It isn't gravity that keeps us on the ground in place on Earth \nbut invisible gnomes holding on to our feet in another place on Earth.\n\nSuperstition (which by definition includes religion - I only add the \n'/religious' because religious people in general are ignorant of that fact) \nholds that anything can happen for no reason at any time.\n\nDistinguish between these claims: only gravity holds us to the Earth vs. \nonly electromagnetism holds us to the Earth. They are clearly different \nclaims because they are claims about the natural world. There are rational \n(consistent) rules at work in the natural world.\n\nNow distinguish between these claims: only the will of Thor holds us to the \nEarth vs. only the will of the Easter Bunny holds us to the Earth. Are they \ndifferent claims?\n\nThere is no possible way to reason about claims of the supernatural. Are \nthey different? No one can say. Are they contradictory? No one can say. Is \none of those claims true on Thursdays but false on the other days of the \nweek? No one can say, because no one has ever found any rules or reasons \nassociated with the supernatural world.\n\nSuperstition and the supernatural are just different names for one giant \nsteaming vat of anti-rational shit that people present as their warrant \nwhen they are unable (or unwilling) to accept that reason works.\n\nIf there are no rules, then reason can never be apply. The closest anyone \nhas ever gotten to actually reasoning about the supernatural world were the \nattempts to measure the length of angel's wings and to count how many of \nthem could sit on the head of a pin.\n\n\nImagine where the world might be if those ignorant cretins had spent all \nthat utterly wasted time considering where diseases and infections came \nfrom. Imagine if Buddhist monks spent decades pondering cell formation \ninstead of selfishly pursuing their own personal experiences. Imagine if \nthe Catholic church spent its billions on a cure for cancer instead of \nusing it to cause death and misery by blocking family planning, stem cell \nresearch and the distribution of condoms. Imagine if the trillions of \ndollars wasted on psychic hotlines, horoscopes, palm reading and tarot \ncards were focused instead on solving the problems of homelessness and \nhunger. What if all the person-hours wasted removing the 13th floor from \ntall buildings or changing addresses so no ones house number was 666 were \ninstead spent pondering ways to make construction or city services more \nefficient?\n\nThose are real world examples of superstition and the rejection of reason \nare one and the same.\n\nThey're the low hanging fruit, but I honestly can't think of a single \nsubtle case where adopting superstition isn't a blatant rejection of \nreason. As soon as one accepts \"Maybe cancer starts because the gods are \nangry\" then I can see no possible path to reason after that point other \nthan simply returning to the starting point and accepting that reason works \nand unreason doesn't.\n\nThere is also the fact that reason identifies cause, whereas superstition \ncan only postpone identifying cause.\n\nReason supports the extremely counter-intuitive evidence that quantum \ntheory and the big bang are correct. All the bizarre behaviour at the \nsubatomic level, all of the unimaginable temperatures and pressures present \nat the time of the big bang, they were all established using reason and \nthey can all be confirmed using reason, because reason can identify false \nreasoning. If it contradicts all the available evidence, then it is false \nreasoning.\n\nSuperstition cannot identify cause because it's fundamentally opposed to \nreason. Superstition can't identify false unreasoning. Superstition, rather \nthan eliminating the false, simply splits into additional superstitions \nwhenever it encounters a contradiction.\n\nAgain, there is no path back to reality. You can say \"maybe telekinesis \ninvolves an undetected energy... and since this contradicts \nrenormalization, maybe it involves an undetected energy to which \nrenormalization doesn't apply... and since that flies in the face of the \nstandard model then maybe it involves an energy that is outside the domain \nof renormalization and outside the domain of the standard model... and \nsince that would defy our understanding of space-time...  At no point does \nsuperstition ever arrive at \"enough is enough, stop the bullshit.\"\n\nSuperstition cannot allow reason to be applied, because that would cause \nthe collapse of the entire chain of claims no matter where in that chain \nyou apply it. As soon as you apply reason and say \"There isn't any evidence \nof anything outside the bounds of renormalization\" then the entire chain \ncollapses.\n\nIf you jump in the middle of the chain and apply reason e.g. \"the standard \nmodel is incomplete but there's no evidence that one of the missing parts \nis a type of energy strong enough to interact with matter\" then the whole \nchain logically collapses - though from a superstitious perspective that's \nnot a problem as it one can just postulate more superstitions.\n\nIf you go straight to the end of the chain and say \"There's no indication \nthat our understanding of cosmology is so faulty that an energy of the \nmagnitude required would not be detected at all\" then once again the whole \nchain of superstitions collapses because the same reasoning can be applied \nat every bifurcation of the superstition tree.\n\nActually that's probably a good way to think about it - science starts with \nfacts on the ground and tests claims against those facts in order to build \nthose roots into a solid trunk of theory, whereas superstition starts with \na single claim arbitrarily selected from that trunk and from there splits \ninfinitely many times, leafing each time it collides with the newly \nacquired evidence.\n\nSuperstitions can't converge on a single truth because new superstitions \nmust always be created as a reaction to new evidence. More facts = more \nsuperstitious rationalization. Science converges on a single truth because \nreason (Occam's razor in this case) inhibits divergence. More facts = fewer \nscientific theories.\n\nAn Neil Turok likes to show on his slides, the proof that we understand \nmost of what happens in the observable universe fits on a single page - \neven if printed on a single line on a single page, it's still readable.\n\nMeanwhile tens of thousands of years of accumulated \"wisdom\" from the \nsuperstitious crowd, millions of written pages and yet they can't even \nagree with each other on what constitutes evidence for supernatural beings \nor supernatural forces.\n\nReason says that after all that time they should have been able to make at \nleast *some* miniscule bit of progress towards explaining whatever the fuck \nit is they're babbling about. Since they haven't made any, it's safe to say \nit that such beliefs aren't just contrary to reason, they're actively \nhostile to it.",

But this is the beginning of only our universe. \nThe Bible clearly states that the heavens in Genesis is the universe, and \nis very very different from Heaven. Of course there was a beginning, but \nonly to us. This solves the question of multiverses, unless you disagree. \nLet's think of the universe. Forever expanding? Yes! However, others are \ntoo. The infinite plane holding universes is infinite, and as the universes \nexpand, so does the plane. I call this the Infinite Area Principle. There \nwould only be one universe there from the VERY beginning of time, and that \nwould have to be created by another being, someone outside the laws of \nphysics. Then that universe newly made would spew out energy, birthing new \nuniverses, setting a chain. Maybe, instead of the beginning of EVERYTHING, \nnot including God, would be not 13 billion years, but more like over \nGoogols of years. God, as I've stated, is out of the laws of physics, \ntherefore, he has the ability to basically be omnipotent, omniscient, \nomnipresent, and forever. God can't have a beginning without the laws of \nphysics. So what if he does? Then he wouldn't be able to create the first \nuniverse, making us non-existent. Where did God come from? No one, he has \nno beginning, has no end, and breaks the space time continuum. Maybe, as we \nspeak, a new universe is being set off! That squeeze of the universe not \nbreaking time but still compressing is the past universe's particles, \ncoming outside the plane. If you don't like my theory because you have a \ndifferent opinion that you want to rub in my face, then don't even argue, \nbecause I won't reply. \ufeff",

In fact I think changes or exceptions should be made for people of \ncertain, more demanding religions to pray properly in school.\n\nI only went to a public high school for a handful of classes so my \nexperience is limited, but I remember it having awful administration in \ngeneral and not just towards religious issues. American public education is \njust an embarrassment all around imo. The university I attend now is a lot \nbetter though and is very accommodating of different religions as well.\n\nAs for the flood and Noah's Ark though... I mean I don't know which is more \nridiculous, the flood or the boat. I'm not sure I can post links on \nyoutube, but stuff isn't hard to come by. Disregarding common sense, a \ncouple off the top of my head are...\n\n1. We know that civilizations lived through the supposed time that the \nflood happened (Egyptians are the example most often used) and there is no \ntrace of it happening in their histories or archaeologically.\n\n2. There isn't even enough water on Earth for the flood to have possibly \nreached the levels stated in Genesis and the water cycle proves that the \nsame amount of water has always been on Earth.\n\n4. Noah couldn't possibly have gathered 1-7 (depending on account) pairs of \neach species of animals/plants in his lifetime, let alone the food and \nwater to support them.\n\n5. Noah's Ark, at its largest reported size, could only physically have \ncarried approximately 3-5 of the larger elephants not including any of the \nother thousands upon thousands of species of animals/plants/etc. and the \nfood and water to keep them alive throughout the flood.\n\nMany researchers now believe that Noah's flood was based off pre-existing \nflood stories found mainly in Mesopotamian literature along with a lot of \nthe other Biblical stories, or possibly on a less severe event that was \nexaggerated out of context.\n\nAlso I'd like to mention that not all Christians are fundamentalists or \ncreationists and therefore don't necessarily take every word in the bible \nas fact; most Christian denominations I am familiar with just view them as \na kind of moral code.",

A link would be helpful, but \nradioactive dating and even carbon dating could be off. For example, \nchanges in the air or surroundings can be a factor, as with water. Now, \nrocks under tons of pressure from the water and the currents of said water \ncould bash, break, and possibly change radioactivity, when under extreme \npressure for a long time (Say, 40 days). Anyway, the same could happen to \nfossils, and there were probably some dead things after 2000 years after \ncreation. Just like the core of Earth is under a lot of pressure and its \natoms are so close together it burns off radiation and molecules/atoms, the \nFlood could have had the same effect.\n\nAlso, when they say the Big Bang THEORY, it means thought, not fact. I \ndon't know why it's being taught in public schools as a fact, considering \nthey give their students almost no lunch and forcing them to do a math \nproblem like 6 + 4 in a way that takes a whole minute. Most likely isn't \ndefinitely true, and if they call it true, then science is lost, especially \nwhen there's more evidence for a created world than a world out of chance. \n\nDo you agree with me that they shouldn't be teaching kids theories and \ncalling them facts?

There is no authority. How else can we \never come to any conclusions about how the universe works without putting \nour ideas to the test?\n\n\"You see, I think the debate between empiricists and 'mystics', ... is more \ncomplicated than most initially assume.\" - I would disagree. I would \nactually pose that we have created a problem where there isn't a problem. \nWe have complicated things more than needed.\n\nWe have invented this \"realm\" that supposedly exists beyond the \"natural\" \nworld (supernatural) when that in itself, is something we could never have \nknown to exist. The way in which we have defined the supernatural tells me \nit doesn't exist and we can never know if it exists - In order to construct \nan idea within our mind about the universe, we would need to have had \nobserved, experienced, sensed or measured a phenomenon - but by the very \ndefinition of the supernatural, we cannot observe, experience, sense or \nmeasure using any tool so therefore, the only conclusion I can come to is \nthat it is merely a label we have used when we are unable to explain an \nevent. \n\nIt is merely the label we use when we cannot explain things. Other labels \ninclude the paranormal, mystic, magic etc. - all of these labels are used \nwhen we cannot explain a certain phenomenon about the reality in which we \nexperience. And in every case where we attached these labels for certain \nevents, we have always been able to explain it by natural means and there \nwas never anything \"beyond the natural world\" required to explain them. \n\nSo why should I change my mind and assume that there is an actual \n\"supernatural\" realm when the idea itself is a paradox to me? \n\n\"Both individuals are working from completely different worldviews, values, \nand systems of authority.\" - But when it comes to the reality, there is a \nway in which the universe works and there are ways in which it doesn't. And \nregardless of the world views, values, and systems of authorities that the \nindividuals employ, this doesn't change that basic fact about our \nexperience. Do you not agree?\n\n\"You say that an individual must produce repeatable and controlled proof to \nverify a belief of his.\" - It is much more complicated than that but on a \nvery basic level, yes. We cannot ever \"confirm\" our belief. We can never \nknow if we are completely absolutely right about something. We can only \never know when we are wrong. But we can conduct tests that show us when we \nare wrong. And by a process of elimination, we can observe that the data we \ncollect (through experimentation), will start to point towards a particular \ntruth about the universe. We then start to form a theory about that truth. \nWe cannot actually \"prove\" it to be true. But it stands as the best \nexplanation, until further experimentation shows us where we went wrong. \n\n\"The individual counters that his belief comes from experiential evidence \nwhich cannot be routinely duplicated or tested, which is of greater value \nto him than objective observable evidence. \" - I think we are in \ndisagreement of what evidence is. If you experience something, that - \nitself - isn't evidence for anything. You have to construct an hypothesis \nin order to see whether the experience supports your hypothesis. A \nhypothesis being an idea that can be tested. If you have an experience, and \nyou think it was [x], you cannot just declare that the experience is \ntherefore evidence for [x] without actually testing it can you? You need to \nbe able to put your own ideas to the test in order for you to claim that \nthe experience is supporting your hypothesis (your idea). \n\nSo, in other words, if you cannot routinely duplicate your experience, and \nyou cannot routinely test your idea about what you think the experience \nwas, how can you possibly know that the experience is in support of what \nyou think the cause of it was? It comes down to faith - merely what you \nbelieve it to be. And if you truly want to know about your experiences and \nwhat the cause of them was, you will depend on being able to replicate the \nexperience and experiment and test your hypothesis. \n\nThe process I am trying to explain here is basically the scientific method \n- which is our best method (no doubt) of acquiring knowledge. Now you can \ncomplicate things as much as you want. But you cannot argue with the fact \nthat using the scientific method, we have accomplished things that just 20 \nyears ago, we would think the technology we have now was alien technology. \nIf we go back further, like a thousand years ago, the things we have \naccomplished now would be indistinguishable from magic.

Now that we know the \ntruth about virtual particles, suddenly they retreat even further into \ninsanity and claim that even the quantum vacuum isn't nothing any more.\n\nThey can cherry pick and ride on the coat tails of science and redefine \ntheir claims every single day, but they can never engage in an honest \nargument because they put their claims above any rules of evidence, any \nproofs, and any reason. They will always find new magical arguments to make \nno matter how long rational people engage them.",

I said the arguments presented for God are irrational - and the \ndefinition of God is irrational in my judgement - well - not irrational, \nbut inconsistent. Also, the belief in God is irrational by definition. \n\nThe debate about God is, of course, the best debate one can have in my \njudgement. It is the most important question of them all - mainly because \nit deals with what our purpose is - if there exists such a thing. \n\nBut my problem is the popular monotheistic belief in modern day. \nChristianity, Judaism, Islam, etc. the kind of God that is proposed here, \nis a diabolical creature to me. And the very concept of it negates any \npurpose if there is such thing - especially Christianity.\n\nBut even after saying all this, it is still rather meaningless to debate \nabout the existence of God. Given that we actually had any evidence for \nsuch being, then there would be a discussion worth having. But since there \nhas been nothing in support of anything of any \"God-like\", it is completely \nuseless.  \n\nThroughout history, the definition of God hasn't always been the same - as \nyou may know.\n\nBut one thing is for sure: In every case where God has been used, it has \nbeen used at the peak of our ignorance. Whenever we cannot explain \nsomething, we insert God as the explanation - we have done this all \nthroughout history and even the best human mind did it - Isaac Newton. \n\nWhen Isaac Newton reached the height of his knowledge, and when the \ncalculations of the motions of the heavenly bodies became too complex for \nhim, he essentially gave up and said \"God must be responsible\" - but we \nsoon learnt that no God was required - like always, it is physics. \n\nWe once did the same when trying to explain volcanoes, lightning, \ntornadoes, disease etc. the list goes on\u2026 \n\nGod is the explanation used for when we don't have an actual explanation. \nThat is why currently, it is a popular belief among theists that God was \nthe being who made the big bang - bang! The reason for this is because we \ndon't have a proper explanation yet. And I predict very much like in EVERY \ncase, the explanation for what happened before the big bang will not \ninvolve God but it will be physics. ",

I'm not \nsure if you've tried to straw-man the construct, or you are unaware of it's \nrefined form.  The existence of all the things which we observe in the \nphysical world is contingent upon an external source from itself.  The \nquestion of whether it is necessary for the chain of existence to \neventually run backwards into a non-contingent source of existence is not \nirrational.  Call this \"God\" if you will.\n\nYou are correct in presenting the premise that there is not sufficient \nevidence to rationally conclude the matter beyond any doubt.  That \nstatement has no direct relevance to the central thread of this discussion. \n \n\nI surmise from your comments that you are an empiricist.  I respect that \nposition.  However, it appears to me that perhaps your ego is clouding your \nperception of objective logic.  Other basic worldviews besides that one \nhave been widely recognized as having a rational basis by which to engage \ndiscussion in for a very long time.\n\nConsider the rational and logical discussion that has proceeded from our \nexamination of question of the existence of God itself.  I understand your \nunderlying premises regarding the argument itself, but your assertion that \nthe question itself is irrational puzzles me.\n\nBeyond the present evidence of our exchange itself which is contrary to \nyour statement, I don't quite see how you are comfortable with the degree \nof confidence you exude against the rationality of questioning the \nexistence of God.  You are discounting thousands of brilliant philosophical \nminds which believe the contrary.  It is also slightly ironic that there is \nevidence which exhibits the probability that your screen name refers to one \nof them, but I digress.\n\nNow, I am aware this last presentation strays from the direct logical \ndialogue somewhat, but given the overwhelming capacity that both individual \nand collective minds possess for error, bias, and general fallibility, it \nappears to be prudent to approach concepts with an overwhelming audience in \nsupport of either side with a degree of humility and open-mindedness, no?\n\nAfter all, the question is still very much open for rational discourse, \nmuch like that which we've all partaken in, after thousands of years, which \nis more than can be said of many extremely well-observed, tested, debated, \nand near-unanimously agreed-upon intellectual concepts and constructions \nthroughout history.",

Your argument here, the \"first cause\" argument isn't logically \nvalid - never mind logically sound. Your argument says that everything that \nexists has a cause, the universe exists, therefore the universe has a cause \n- it is called God. But logically, it follows that since God exists, he \nmust have a cause also (since you deduced that everything that exists \n\"must\" have a cause). You get into what is called an \"infinite regression\". \nYou get an infinite amount of causes. \n\nBut then you say \"but God has always existed\" - with which then you commit \nthe logical fallacy of special pleading. Which is you say \"everything but \n[x] has a cause\" - this is logically fallacious. You cannot just exclude \nGod from everything else - there is no rational reason to. If you say \neverything that exists has a cause, then everything that exists has a cause \n- including God. \n\nNow at this point, you may want to employ the Kalam Cosmological Argument \nfor God's existence - which is essentially the same argument that you used \n- but instead of saying \"everything that exists has a cause\" - you insert \nthe word \"everything that \"begins\" to exist has a cause\" - you purposely do \nthis in order to once again, employ the special pleading fallacy and say \n\"but got didn't begin to exist - he always existed - so therefore he \ndoesn't need a cause\" - which is logically fallacious - never mind \nlogically sound. \n\nSo no, you don't have a rational basis for the belief in God. Nobody does \nby definition. All the arguments for God are either a) logically fallacious \n(they contain logical fallacies) or b) logically unsound (they contain \npremises which are not supported by evidence). \n\nSo now I redirect your comment back to you, how about you read the \nresponses to the arguments for God - or better, show your evidence for God. \n\nAnd once again, no matter how much you try and recover, your analogy of \ndark matter and god are false analogies. We deduced dark matter from our \nobservation - there is no observation of the universe that would warrant \nthe hypothesis of God because of how we now define God.

                    "text": "+Descartes Rene You are making the argument more complex than it is. We \nobserve the world to see that there is existence. There is life and that \nlife exists because some other thing gave it life. Ex: a child exists \nbecause their parents had sex, a tree grows from a seed of another tree. \nEven none-life follows this--a waterfall forms because a river cut through. \nThe river comes from a lake, the lake from a crater which formed below sea \nlevel. Everything that we can observe exists because something else existed \nbefore it.\n\nTherefore something must have caused the first form of existence.. We can \ncall that God. It does not matter which God, that is not even a part of the \nargument.\n\nI brought into the example dark matter because we observed a problem that \ndid not fit with our understanding of the universe. (like we observe that \nall things get their existence from elsewhere) There was no evidence for \ndark matter--but a lack of something we knew ought to be there based on our \nprevious observations of the way the world works. This fact was that the \nmass of galaxies needs to be much greater than what we observed to be there \nin order to \"hold together.\"  It was deemed that the matter must exist \nbased on what we know and it was called dark matter.\n\nThis is a hypothesis that was made--no evidence yet, but an observation \nthat something might be there we can't physically observe.\n\nI am not trying to get you to believe the premise \"there is a God,\" but it \nIS logically founded. You can critique the arguments or reject them or \nsubscribe to something else. We observe what we know about the universe and \ncan come to different conclusions about what that means. There are several \nlogical proofs that indicate the existence of God. You can reject the \nPREMISE, as I said earlier, but you can not deny that it is a RATIONAL \nargument, as in, logic and reason are used to deduce the concept.\n\nMaybe you should try to read a rational argument for God... like here: \nhttp://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_first_cause",

There are \nas many Gods as there are people - because everyone has their own little \nidea of what God is. You also assumed that there exists something beyond \nthe physical world - this is inconsistent with reality by definition. There \nis no reason to assume there exists anything other than the physical world. \nYou have to demonstrate this - which of course, given you did demonstrate \nthe supernatural world, this would contradict the very idea - which is why \nI don't think there exists even such thing in the first place. \n\nIn my opinion, human beings have defined God in such way to exclude him \nfrom scientific investigation in order to shield their irrational belief in \nhim. And it is not only God that people do this - they do it with Ghosts as \nwell. If we define God, or Ghosts as beyond the natural world, as you say, \nnobody could prove it wrong - this is not a good thing - to the contrary \nactually. Because this means that despite what is true, people could \npersist in believing in their own beliefs without ever finding what is true \nor false. It is a nonsensical circle. And one would only do this in order \nto never find out that what they believe is false. \n\nIt is also a false analogy to compare dark matter and atoms with god. Dark \nmatter has no physical evidence by the way - you are wrong about that. Dark \nmatter is merely a label used to describe the extra gravitational effects \nwe observe where there is no visible matter - hence the name \"Dark\" matter. \nAnd we didn't hypothesise about dark matter before we observed the extra \ngravitational effects. Dark matter came from the observation - not the \nother way round. It is the same for atoms. The idea of atoms, despite our \ninability to observe them directly, came from other indirect observations \nfrom the natural world ( or world as I would put it - natural is a \nnonsensical word for me - there is nothing but natural to me) . \n\nThere is no observation of the natural world, that warrants the hypothesis \nof God because of the very definition of God. Everything that happens \nwithin the universe that we observe, could not possibly be of anything \nsupernatural because that would be a contradiction. \n\nThis is why it is much more consistent to reject the idea of supernatural \nas being something real from the very start - but this is merely a label \nused to exclude our beliefs from scientific enquiry - because science is \nour best method of acquiring knowledge - and why would one want to put our \nwish-thinking beliefs to the test using our best method of acquiring \nknowledge?

                    "text": "+Senaneone My friend, you are confusing definitions.  The term theory in \nscience holds a very different meaning then the common mans theory.  Even \ndictionary.com and Google define will give multiple different definitions \nof the word.\n\nThe conman mans definition of theory is \"a supposition or a system of ideas \nintended to explain something.\" I believe it is this definition you are \nhung up on.  And you are correct to assert that a supposition is subjective \nto to presenter and therefore (potentially) incorrect.\n\nBut you also have to keep in mind that theory can mean several other very \ndifferent things.  For example, in Mathematics a theory is actually a set \nof steps that need to be taken in order to solve a problem.  It is neither \nan idea nor an opinion, it's a series of tasks.\n\nNow to the point of argument, a Scientific Theory is \"an explanation or \nmodel based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning, especially one \nthat has been tested and confirmed (keywords here. tested and confirmed) as \na general principle helping to explain and predict natural phenomena.\" \n\nRemember that in order to be considered science, an idea must start as a \nhypothesis, be subjected to a battery of tests and experiments designed to \nrule out all other possible explanations while confirming the idea.  It \nthen must face peer review by other scientists who's sole mission is to \ndebunk the idea.  Only then can that idea reach the status of theory, after \nall known, testable alternatives have been attempted and disprove.  If the \nidea fails at any one step, it does not graduate to theory, rather it \nre-stets to hypothesis.\n\nThis method insures that personal bias has little to no influence over the \nidea.\n\nI hope this clears up some things.\n\nRespectfully",

It is however excellent evidence that if he did exist, he was just \nsome local, purely human shmuck doing simple magic tricks and pawing them \noff as miracles.\n\nNo one knows who actually wrote most of the bible. In particular the \ngospels. No one knows who wrote those. We do know that they were cobbled \ntogether and heavily edited, and that portions of them are forgeries \ninserted by later authors.\n\nIf you read the gospels in the order they were written, rather than the \norder they are presented, you'll also note very clear cases of selective \nediting going on.\n\nWe also know the Nicean councils made wholesale revisions of the bible for \npolitical purposes and for expediency. Entire books were thrown out during \nthose exercises.\n\nAll of the significant tales in the bible - creation story, the virgin \nbirth, the 12 disciples, the repeating magic numbers like 3 and 12, the \ntale of death and rebirth etc, they're all just rehashes of older religions \nor older traditions.  Even the ten commandments are just rehashes.\n\nAre the stories in there true or false? Hard to say because the actual \norigins of the stories are lost in history that predates the bible hundreds \nto thousands of years.\n\nAre the stories likely to be accurate? Well, in 300BCE or so at least one \nof the Greeks were busy measuring the radius of Earth while the bible still \ndescribes it as a flat disk with an iron dome over it that the stars were \nembedded in. Some Arabs were busy studying and naming the stars while the \nignorant semi-primitives who wrote the bible were still declaring that bats \nare birds and that unicorns really existed.\n \nDoesn't seem like there's much need to disprove anything in the bible since \nit repeatedly contradicts and disproves itself. Just try and figure out how \nmany people were actually hanging around the magic tomb after the Jesus \ncharacter was supposedly hung on a stick (thank you again, Richard \nCarrier!)  The bible certainly has no fucking clue on that score. You'd \nthink as that is _the_central part of the book that they'd have taken some \ncare to get that bit right!",

Invariably they'll agree that those all prove that science is \n\"limited\" or just flat out wrong because clearly the  calculations/failures \nof the calculations prove that it's crap.\n\nBut when *they* introduce infinities, like an infinitely old god that is \ninfinitely large and infinitely wise and can conjure from nothing an \ninfinitely heavy object and an infinitely immovable object and whack them \ntogether an infinite number of times... then suddenly infinities are good \nthings, and solid reality! They want to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nYou certainly could go on for millenia listing all the things that are \npossible. However, if your goal is to leave the planet slightly better off \nthan it was during your lifetime, it's best to take the rational adult path \nand discuss the things that are likely, not the things that could be. Could \nthere be gods out there? Sure, there could also be a poop monster a la \n:Dogma.\" Suppose there were. Have they demonstrated good leadership? Good \nmorals? Does the human race show any signs of benefit from them?\n\nClearly the answers are no. Innocent infants and children suffer and die \nfrom cancer and house fires. If there are all-powerful gods out there, \nthey're real lowlife shitbags, and any moral human should reject them based \non their actions, precisely the same way they should reject any human \nleaders who did the same sort of things to infants and children.\n\nBTW you're making a common mistake. The gods of the Jews, the Muslims and \nthe Christians are all the same gods, literally. They're all labeled \"the \ngod of Abraham\", though as with all gods there are thousands of mutually \nexclusive versions of them. The gods that fly planes into buildings, the \ngods of the Westboro Baptist church, the gods of the Catholics (a.k.a. \nPaeodphiles Anonymization), the gods of the Jews, Mormons, Quakers, \nBaptists, those are all just variations on the \"god of Abraham.\"  When a \nJew, Muslim or Christian tells you \"there is only one god\", they're all \nreferring to precisely the same mythical character.\n\nThey'll all despise you forever for pointing that out. They'll usually also \nshow you what arrogant fucks they are because they'll tell you that *their* \npersonal narrative of what that god is/does/stands for is far superior to \nany of those others.\n\nHow do they know? They communicate telepathically with it on a regular \nbasis. And it telepathically communicates back to them, telling them what \nit wants and what it thinks is right. Just like it telepathically tells the \nWestboro Baptist church members that it hates gays. Likewise, it \ntelepathically communicates with suicide bombers too. Heck, it's got lots \nof open telepathic communication channels, some that go the pope (where it \nexpresses its will on birth control and bank interest rates when lending to \nthe mafia), priests (where it communicates which little boys are an easy \nfuck), bishops (where it tells them to protect the priests they just caught \nfucking that little slut from the 6th grade), and that lunatic wearing \ngarbage bags and shouting \"Praise the lawd!\" at cars passing on the streets \nof NYC.\n\nAt least the latter likely has mental health issues that make him think \nthat gods are talking in his head. Everyone else has no excuse, other than \nthe sheer fucking arrogance of believing that an all power god chooses to \nspend its time talking to them.\n\n(can you tell I'm not a fan of corporate religions or ultra-pompous \nfuckwittery in general?)",

And do not be conformed to this world but be \ntransformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will \nof God is, that which is good and acceptable, or well pleasing and perfect.\u201d\n\n\nTrue worship is not confined to what we do in church or open praise \n(although these things are both good, and we are told in the Bible to do \nthem). True worship is the acknowledgment of God and all His power and \nglory in everything we do. The highest form of praise and worship is \nobedience to Him and His Word. To do this, we must know God; we cannot be \nignorant of Him (Acts 17:23). Worship is to glorify and exalt God\u2014to show \nour loyalty and admiration to our Father.\n\nLuke 4:8And Jesus answered him, \u201cIt is written, \u201c\u2018You shall worship the \nLord your God, and him only shall you serve.\"\n\n+Edwin Guerrero\n\n\n\nThose Christians you speak of about worshiping are the true Christians that \nare DEVOTED.",

Even his gravity, while \nan excellent approximation, is still fundamentally wrong, it doesn't \ndescribe gravity as it really is.\n\nLike the typical Christian zealots (it is a doomsday cult after all), he \nmade doomsday predictions that in 46 years will be proven just as false as \nall the hundreds/thousands of false predictions we've had to endure. He \nconsidered himself a \"special messenger\" from the gods.\n\nHis science endured, and his bullshit was discarded, and that bullshit is \nfervently ignored by zealots who only want to associate his successes with \ntheir religions.\n\nWhy don't you defend your claims instead of making excuses for them? Why \ndo  you have to cherry pick one or two people out of the millions who \nparticipated in the Inquisitions and the witch burnings and the child rape \nand slave trade and the stonings and the torture and their relentless \nobsessions with sex?\n\nYou have to sort though that massive shitpile just to find *one* name of \nsomeone who got something right 300 years ago. That's not a recommendation \nfor your superstitions, that's a strong indictment of them.\n\nIf your religion has something to say about the natural world, then why the \nfuck don't you cite what it has to say as evidence? Scientists don't have a \nproblem with that. They cite their evidence all the time. You're claiming \nyour religion is associated with or similar to science, get off your \nfucking ass and prove it.\n\nThen don't be surprised at being ridiculed for such epic fucking failure.\n\nWhy do you have to always reach into the past for examples you pretend make \nup for the vicious and immoral history of your religion.\n\nScientists make predictions. Sometimes quite accurate ones, in one case the \nprediction matched the measurement to 14 decimal places.\n\nYour religion couldn't even predict a simple eclipse - not even to the \nnearest decade.\n\nOh, but Newton was a Christian!

There have been lots of atheists who committed murder and all \nsorts of really shitty things.\n\nYour job is to present some fucking evidence that they killed or raped \nanyone *because* they were an atheist!\n\nYou know, all those times when atheists burst into crowded shops and shout \n\"There is no god!\" before detonating their suicide vest and killing \neveryone without 20 feet.\n\nOr all those times when atheists invade other countries, raping, pillaging \nand plundering, all the while shouting \"We are a great nation because no \ngod is on our side!\"\n\nThen that was time that whack job used the atheist convictions of 900 \npeople to convince them to drink cyanide laced koolaide because they \nweren't going to get to meet any gods.\n\nLet us not forget the atheist inquisitions where religious people were \ntortured until they finally rejected their belief in the gods!\n\nOh yeah, and the gangs of atheists who burned women at the stake for \ngossiping about their sexual failures. How many young women were set on \nfire and had their screams cheered on by groups of atheists who claimed \nthat witchcraft wasn't real?\n\nNow, let's put that shoe on the other foot. How many theists have detonated \nsuicide vests in crowded markets, or in front of Federal buildings, or \nconvinced 900 people to drink cyanide laced koolaide? How many people have \nbeen enslaved, tortured and murdered by Christians, Jews, Muslims, \nBuddhists, Sikhs and all  the rest of the religions of the Earth?\n\nThe point, which you clearly fail to grasp, isn't that Christians are all \nrapists and murderers, it's that religion is both the cause of and the \nfocal point for the greatest acts of horror throughout all of history. As \nSteven Weinberg says:\n\n\"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you'd have \ngood people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for \ngood people to do bad things, it takes religion.\"\n\nSetting aside the fact that never cited atheism as the reason to kill \nanyone, you can list that handful of atheist dictators and mass murders by \nname because there have been so few of them. No one can even count the \nnumber of bloodthirsty Christians who have burned \"witches\" at the stake, \nritually sacrificed their children, committed genocide and fucked little \nchildren up the point.It would be almost trivial to compile a list of 1,000 \nsex obsessed religious wackos who killed more than 1,000 people, and I'm \nbetting there's enough documentation to list 10,000 of them. So hey, \ncongratulations, you found 3 atheists in the pile of mass murdering \nshitbags. That really, really strengthens the case for your sick and \ndepraved sex-obsessed religion.\n\nIn case you're still not getting it, your religion is immoral. Religion is \nresponsible for almost every horror that has been visited on the human \nspecies by other humans, and if you so much as fucking hint that you might \nhave been thinking about the possibility of potentially claiming that \n\"religion does good too\" then I will simply tell you to go fuck yourself \nfor claiming that good people wouldn't do good if they weren't religious.\n\nI learned my vocabulary in the fucking submarine service, probably before \nyou were even born. When you have had 1/10th of the adventures in life that \nI have had, *then* you can make an appointment with my secretary to \ncriticize my choice of words. You know what?

Folks who will follow \nthe nth twist and the ten billionth turn of the logical rabbit hole and \n*still* say \"well, there might be supernatural beings behind the ten \nbillion and first turn in this rabbit hole so we can't say they don't exist\"\n\nRationally speaking, we can dismiss the rabbit hole as causation for \n*anything* without even peeking inside of it and not be in violation of any \nprinciples of open-mindedness or reason.\n\nPicture two rabbit holes.\n\nFrom the first hole, called the supernatural, billions of people claim that \nthousands/millions of supernatural things emerge. The Easter Bunny, gods, \ndragons, elves, magic bunnies, faeries, gnomes, telepathic powers, psychic \npowers, witches, wizards, sorcerers, sea monsters, vampires, werewolves and \nevery other sort of imaginary creatures and powers supposedly emerge.\n\nBut in observing that hole for all of human history, no one has ever \nobserved or produced evidence of *anything* actually coming out of it. Not \nso much as a grape seed has ever popped out of that hole.\n\nThe other rabbit hole is labeled \"Science\". Millions of people make \ncompletely insane claims about what comes out of that one. Absolutely \nincredible tales of different kinds invisible forces, of time that twists \nand bends, claims of invisible dimensions, mind boggling claims that there \nare things that can be magically entangled such that changing the state of \none will instantaneously change the state of the other, even if there are a \nbillion light-years between them. Stories of explosions so big that all of \nhuman life might be obliterated if one occurred within 100 trillion miles \nof Earth. Batshit crazy stories of bringing dead humans back to life using \ninvisible forces, of replacing the hearts, lungs and kidneys of human \nbeings in order to keep them alive. Crazy talk, not just about curing \nillness, but of preventing it from happening in the first place.\n\nOut of that hole, things are emerging at an ever increasing rate. The real, \nsolid evidence for these stories being true surrounds us, we actually use \nthe stories in our radios, televisions, cell phones, GPS, cars, airplanes, \neven in children's toys. The stories about invisible forces are used to \npower our cities and to send rovers to other planets so that we can drive \ncreating even *more* fantastic stories about our universe. It's so \npervasive that the odds are pretty good that you've got a friend or \nneighbors or co-worker who has died and been brought back to life, or who \nhas been cured of what used to be a terminal disease, or who has donated an \norgan or received a donated one, or has traveled faster than the speed of \nsound - or otherwise has first-hand experience with any of a million other \ncompletely fantastic things.\n\nEvery claim of something emerging from the first hole, throughout all of \nhuman history, has eventually turned out to be a mistake, the result of \nhuman ignorance and fear that trial and error has corrected. The gods and \ndevils from that hole that create thunder and lightning? Oops. The \ngods/devils who send the rains? Oops. The gods/devils/giants/trolls who \ncreate the earthquakes? Oops. The sea monsters? Oops. The dragons? Oops. \nThe gods and devils as sources of disease and illness? Oops. Horoscopes? \nOops. Telepathy? Oops. The answers to those riddles and the solutions to \nour problems, big and small, have always come from the second hole, never \nthe first.\n\nSo, how long does a reasonable, rational human being have to spend staring \nat that first hole waiting for *something* to come out of it before they \nare granted leave to give up on it? Is it possible that someday a grape \nseed or an elf could pop out of it? Sure, if you're going to be an anal \nbastard about it, just because the first 10 billion turns of that hole \nweren't hiding any elves doesn't mean there aren't elves or gods or magic \nbunnies further down the hole, however at some point all but the most \nterminally stupid human beings have to give up on the claims that \"there's \nmagic in this hole!\" and just admit that it's empty.\n\nThat first hole empty! here is *nothing* ever going to emerge from the hole \nlabeled \"Supernatural.\" Some people refuse to grow up and deal with that \nlike a reasonable adult. They throw tantrums and claim that \"my logic \ntextbook says you can't say for *sure* that it's empty just because nothing \nhas ever emerged from it.\"\n\nThey can nitpick the shit out of the logic, stomp their feet and demand \nthat a thousand (or a million or a billion) years staring at a dry hole \n\"isn't long enough\" to dismiss the possibility of something coming out of \nit, but those of us wearing long pants and trusting in reason and evidence \n*are* able to ignore the first hole and focus on the second with absolutely \nno significant degradation in the quality of our reasoning.\n\nDemanding that we still pay attention to that first hole, is a drag on the \nadvance of the human species. The diseases that don't get cured, the life \nenhancing or life saving discoveries that don't get made, those are mostly \nthe result of countless people wasting time and human lives by staring at a \nhole that has been empty since the beginning of time, and worse, teaching \ntheir children to stare into the same hole that has never produced a \nfucking thing.\n\nIf you insist that every time an answer isn't immediately available from \nthe second hole that we *must* go back to the first hole and expect an \nanswer to emerge from there, you're exposing yourself as a fucking idiot \nwho doesn't give a shit about human progress. It's not optimistic, it's not \nhopeful, it's just your masochistic desires running wild. You *know* that \nany explanation you dream up based on the expectation that the supernatural \nhole will finally cough out its first real answer will be proven wrong. You \n*know* that the only genuine answers we've ever received in all of human \nhistory have all come from the second hole. Insisting that we all run over \nand wait for the very first answer to ever come out of the eternally silent \nhole labeled \"Supernatural\" is nothing but mean-spirited, humanity \ninsulting, and complete fucking idiocy.\n\nThe answer to \"Where did the universe come from\" *will* come from \nscientific inquiry. The origin of the universe was *not* magic because \nthere is no evidence for magic as a cause of anything. There is no evidence \nthat the origin of the universe is beyond our comprehension, it is merely \noutside the bounds of our current knowledge. Offering sacrifices and \nprayers to the gods is *not* going to expand our knowledge to include the \norigin of the universe. Hard work and the sometimes tedious process of \ncollecting and evaluating evidence *will* give us an answer.\n\nAnyone who is still staring at that hole called the supernatural deserves \nto be ridiculed, loudly and in public. It doesn't matter which of the gods \nthey claim is still hiding in that hole, it doesn't matter what brand of \n\"hope\" they falsely claim lies in that hole, it doesn't matter *how* \nintimately they claim to know the supernatural world they claim exists \ninside that hole, they're fucking idiots who have never actually delivered \non anything and it's you, your children and your parents who are losing out \nwhen you don't tell them to shut the fuck up when they make those claims.\n\nThey're wasting time at a time when we don't have any to waste. Our \npopulation is growing too large, our global climate is at high risk, our \nwater supplies are dwindling or polluted, there are people out there who \nhaven't got enough to eat, there are millions dying of easily preventable \ndiseases, and some reprehensible, irresponsible, irrational sacks of shit \nare *still* telling people that the solution to those problems lies in \nholding hands, chanting to the gods, and waiting for solutions to sprout \nmagically from a hole in the ground that has never produced an answer to \nanything in all of human history.\n\nIf you give a shit about the human species, then kick those people right \nsquare in the ass every single fucking time they claim that is the solution \nto *anything.*  We need positive contributions and solutions, not the \nendless negative contributions of the religious/superstitious crowd. We \nneed kids raised to respect the achievements of the human species and with \na desire to expand on them, not yet another generation of groveling \nshitbags all too ready to give credit for our *amazing* accomplishments to \nsome mythical gods, gods those people assure us live in that first hole, \njust around the ten billion and first bend...\ufeff",

The \npower plant feeding you electricity would not have been built without \nunderstanding gravity. The X-ray and PET machines used to save lives would \nnot exist without a deep knowledge of quantum mechanics, nuclear power \nplants would not exist without nuclear physics, the GPS systems that guides \nevery airplane, ship and vehicle would not exist without the theory of \nrelativity, every house taller than a few storeys would collapse without an \nunderstanding of gravity... And so on. There are so, so, so many examples \nthat prove that humanity's \"fancy theory's\" are, if not correct, very close \nto being so; and the Big Bang is what our theories point to being correct. \nIt is intellectually dishonest to admit a theory works in some cases but \nsay it doesn't in others because you don't want it to. You can't have a \nfundamental theory that can explain how computers work, how stars work, and \ntell yourself that it can't explain how the universe works because it \nconflicts with your personal views.",

                "text": "Hello +MinutePhysics I have to admit you do have a great point there, when \nyou mention that there might have been a time before the beginning. Or as \nyou put it... the time before the \"previous cycle\" of the Universe \ncollapesed onto itself to then begin stretching after the \"big bang\". \nHowever, I must also mention that this concept does not contradict at all \nwhat the Bible says about God and the beginning of our Universe.\n\nTo quote the book of Genesis, according to the New Life Version (NLV) \"1 In \nthe beginning God made from nothing the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth \nwas an empty waste and darkness was over the deep waters. And the Spirit of \nGod was moving over the top of the waters.\" In these 2 verses we have: \"God \nmade from nothing the heavens and the Earth\", which reflects the fact that \nthere was Something at the beginning of our Universe, which Catholics, \nChristiand and Jews call God. Scientists, on the other hand, appear to \nprefer the term \"Singularity\", which appears to be despised by you as much \nas it is to me.\n\nAlso worth noting is that in Verse 2 we have the scene of an empty waste \nand darkness with the Spirit of God moving on top of them. That clearly \ntells us that before the \"beginning\" there must have been something there. \nOtherwise, God wouldn't exist. But, if it were true that God didn't exist, \nthen it would also be true that there would not have been ANYTHING before \nthe \"big bang\", which is not true, and (as you also claim yourself) has \nbeen proven by science. Therefore, my humble guess is that the Universe \nMUST be cyclic somehow, and that definitely God does exist. Since both \nstatements are proven by the same hypothesis (I guess). Mind blowing, huh? \nKeep up the great content, I'm starting to love your channel.\ufeff",

So you have to add in all of \nthe homophobic, anti-women, anti-unbelievers, and all of the other horrible \nhorrible things in the bible, you have to take all that and add it into the \nequation of your purpose, meaning, and the \"why\" of life. \n\nSo not only is the bible contradictory in itself, to science, it is \nextremely immoral.

Science is unrelated to any \"search for a higher \nmeaning\", nor does any such search fall within the domain of science.\n\nIf there is one thing that science has taught us, it's that the universe is \nmostly random and that we and everything around us that we interact with is \nentirely the result of simple laws running their course over long periods \nof time.\n\nYou denigrate all of the value and all of the accomplishments of every \nhuman being when you insist that there must be a \"higher meaning.\" Just \nbecause you find human love, friendship, sacrifice and achievement to be an \ninsufficient reason for existing doesn't mean everyone shares such a \nshallow and narcissistic viewpoint.\n\nIf anyone resembles the religious fruitcakes, it would be someone who runs \nfrom the points made and rather than addressing them advocates censoring of \nthe opinions and ideas that they cannot respond to. That's your problem, \nnot mine.\n\nReligion is anti-science. Do you not own a dictionary? Look up the freaking \ndefinitions!\n\nScience is a repeatable process based on the premise that nothing is true \nunless the evidence agrees with it. If the claim being presented doesn't \nagree with nature, then the claim is wrong.\n\nReligion and superstition (two sides of the same coin) are based entirely \non the belief in the supernatural, not only without evidence but by \ndefinition the belief must persist *in spite of* any evidence that could \never be presented.\n\nScience and religion/superstition cannot co-exist. They detract from each \nother.\n\nWhat's even more problematic is that science proves that its rules and \nprocesses work, 24x7, every single fucking day of the week for centuries on \nend. Everything that is good around you, including the health of your \nfamily, your ability to communicate worldwide, the food on your table, it's \nall due almost entirely to human beings testing their hypothesis by \ncomparing their expectations to real-life results.\n\nWhen the same rules and processes are applied to religion/superstition, \nthose beliefs are shown to be completely and utterly pointless wastes of \ntime. Not just wrong, not just unhelpful, not just fuckwittery of the worst \nsort, but a complete waste of the time efforts and good will of billions of \npeople worldwide.\n\nThe more religion/superstition you have, the farther removed from reality \n(science) you become. Religious fundamentalists are as religious as anyone \ncan get. How much room for science/reality is there in their world? Only \nenough to build a bomb. \"Spiritual\" people (i.e. religious people who don't \nwant to be called religious people) are the same, the more \"spiritual\" they \nare, the less room there is for science/reality in their lives - until they \nhave a life threatening disease at which point they abandon their fucking \nidiocy and go to a doctor (or just die like idiots, which is fine in my \nbook which happens to be titled \"The Origin of Species\")\n\nScience gave you western medicine, most of which was developed in the last \ntwo hundred years. In 4M years of humans indulging their childish fantasies \nand imagining that \"maybe somewhere out there, magic is real!\", what the \nfuck has that contributed to your life today? Name one tangible improvement \nall that fucking daydreaming has made.\n\nThe only answers you can come up with are selfish or narcissistic ones. \n\"Oh, x makes me feel better about myself\" or \"Believing in y keeps me from \nhaving to deal with reality\"\n\nFour and a half million fucking years, and the very best that religion and \nphilosophy has ever come up with is \"treat others like you want to be \ntreated\". That's pathetic results.\n\nHowever the same four and a half million fucking years of the daydreams and \ndelusions of the \"spiritual\" crowd, and what in the fuck has that *ever* \nproduced other than \"Oops, well we thought there was some supernatural \nagency behind event x or process y, but it turns out it was just a) \nchemistry b) electromagnetism c) radiation or d) random chance.\"\n\n4.5M fucking years looking for \"a higher meaning\" by all the billions of \ndaydreamers that have ever existed and you haven't produced a single \nfucking thing of benefit to the human species. Seems just a tad \nself-indulgent to pretend that anything is ever going to result from that \neffort, doesn't it? It smacks of megalomania to believe that somehow by \njoining a 4.5M year old unbroken chain of pointless, unproductive wishful \nthinking that you're somehow going to contribute something to the species, \ndoesn't it?\n\nMeanwhile in less than 300 years science took us from Chinese fireworks to \nlanding humans on the moon and rovers on Mars.\n\nYou can flag and censor my words, but you can't flag away that reality. \nScience works, it produces an endless stream of benefits for the human \nspecies, while religion/superstition fails, not just by never producing \nanything of value, but by corrupting the minds and wasting the time of \npeople who *could* be applying the scientific process in their lives and in \ntheir jobs and actually making a difference in the world.\n\nTo the degree that you instill a life-long belief in magic in a child's \nmind, you detract from or destroy the opportunity for that kid to be as \nproductive/valuable as they might be. One human being, in their own \nlifetime can change the entire world using science (that not hypothetical, \nit has happened, literally hundreds of times) while the cumulative effort \n\"to find higher meaning\" by the majority of humans for 4.5M years has never \nproduced a fucking thing.\n\nI'm glad I pissed you off, because the points/issues that are now stuck in \nyour head will not be resolved until *you* resolve them to your own \nsatisfaction. If you're satisfied with sweeping them under the spiritual \ncarpet then the world is no worse off (even though you personally will be). \nIf you can only be satisfied by a resolution based on solid reasoning and \nconsistence with the evidence, then everyone benefits.",

I've been raised by two parents that have given up their \nlives because of this and they've naturally \"brainwashed\" me to dislike \nreligion as a whole.\n\nBut taking a standpoint against religion and dismissing their followers as \nidiots will never solve problems.

How about this for polite: fuck you too, sport.\n\nNow quit whining about being called on your bullshit and present your \nevidence for your claim.\n\nBetter yet, if you actually are a physicist then you should know the \nimportant of making testable predictions. So give us a testable prediction \nbased on your idiotic magic book. Not one that we already know that you can \nlie and back-fit excuses for, but something that we don't currently have \nthe answer to.\n\nIf your gods were divine and knew all about the universe and your magic \nbook is their doing, then why the fuck couldn't they write clearly? Are \nthey that stupid? Why do they need to be \"interpreted\" by true believers \nbefore they can be understood?\n\nNewton expressed seriously complex and very precise ideas. He did it in \nabsolutely clear language. He had to describe all of the framework for his \nlogic as well as his his actual principles and he still took less than 400 \npages to do it all. No one needs to interpret what Newton meant, his words \nspeak for themselves.\n\nEinstein's paper on relativity was only 30 pages long and precisely \ndescribed the motion of everything in the entire universe. His theory made \nprecise and unambiguous predictions, some of which took more than 70 years \nbefore we figured out how to observe/confirm them. In a single year he was \nable to write concise and precise documents that completely revolutionized \nour understanding of the natural world. I doubt all of those papers took \nhim even 200 pages.\n\nYour magic book goes on for 600 pages and can't even clearly state ONE \nsimple fact about a simple natural process without generating centuries of \nargument and controversy among \"true believers\" and without every claim it \nmakes requiring some sniveling apologist to make excuses for the shit job \nthe author did of explaining what they meant. Seriously? Every single claim \nit makes about the natural world is batshit crazy and easily verified as \ncompletely wrong, but you figure you can cherry-pick and back-fit data \nuntil you make it sound like it's only batshit crazy and mostly wrong?\n\nWhy do gods, who should be able to write more clearly and more brilliantly \nthan anyone on Earth, always write such fucked up babbling idiocy that they \nalways need to be heavily \"interpreted\" by self-aggrandizing fuckheads \nwearing magic hats, magic clothes/underwear and constantly referring to \npenises and vaginas?",

As for me,and the way i view \nreligion:\nI dont like how over time we have come up with names and organizations for \neach and every religion, even the people of the same religion divide \nthemselves once they find differences. To me i believe that people should \nstop identifying themselves as this or that (ie; Christian, Hindu, or \nCatholic, Baptist) I think the bible was written in such an abstract form \nin certain areas that we *ourselves*, *individually* should determine what \nthey mean, rather than have a man in holy robes tell us what the verses \n*should* mean to us. We pick, choose, and even make our own sides to the \npoint where we are all but disconnected from the rest of humanity to the \npoint where we begin to think of our group as the \"best\" group, or the \n\"superior\" group and ignore all other possibilities and groups. I once \nasked a guy what his religion was if he had one, his answer: \"im a human\", \nit sounded silly at first but then i realized this was probably the best \nanswer I've ever heard when that question was asked. As for me, im an \nOmnist because i believe all religion holds some truth to them, im a \nChristian because I find that lifestyle familiar  and comfortable to me, \nand im agnostic because i truly dont know what lies beyond in its entirety \nand neither does anyone else. And most importantly of all im an \nIndividualist, I judge for myself what i believe has truth and what doesnt, \nrather than have someone else tell me what is true and what i should \nbelieve. I listen to other opinions no matter there view, and respect \neveryone's opinions and lifestyles equally, however when it comes to whats \ntrue and whats not i think this is something everyone should decide for \nthemselves. Some choose religion because it makes them feel comfortable and \nthey like it, others do so because they believe it to be absolutely true, \nwhat ever the reason for an individuals belief, make sure its the one you \nlike the most, the one you admire the most, and the one that makes you \ncomfortable :)",

I don't really know if god is real or if religion is 'real' \nbecause that in and of itself causes contradiction of what is 'real' \nanyway. I would consider myself jewish because I am raised in a jewish home \nwith those values, I was Bar Mitzvahed and I am a member of the jewish \ncommunity. I observe jewish holidays and those are great ways to be with \nfamily and appreciate being with loved ones, and the stories behind them, \nwhile seemingly impossible (or at least highly improbable), there is \nclearly a message behind them. I do not mean in anyway to sound as though I \nam demeaning the stories of the Torah or Bible or any other religious text \nbecause I have no right to do so, but they are in a sense, very elaborate \nstories that follow a similar pattern to children's stories, they have a \ncentral problem that is resolved and a lesson or theme or moral behind it. \nLike in The Boy who cried wolf it describes that lying is wrong and it \nencourages us not to lie, the story of Noah's ark, while a Global flooding \nis highly improbable and there is no way that two of every land-based \nspecies of all life forms on earth could have fit on a boat that can \nactually float, it still teaches us to have respect to authority in a \nsense. The reason 'god flooded the world' is because people had become \ndisrespectful and disobedient to his presumable authority, and they were \npunished on, a perhaps excessively large scale. While I don't adhere to the \nbible as a means of finding my morals, as my moral values have no bearing \non the existences or truthfulness of any text and more on the way I am \nbrought up, and I consider the torah (or any other text) to be used in \nmodern times as more of a tool to teach children, and even adults, proper \nmoral constructs (granted there are plenty of not so morally just sections \nof the bible, but that's another discussion entirely). So I don't know, nor \ncare, for the existence of god or nonexistence of god, because I find moral \ntruth within myself, my loved ones, and my upbringing (which is still a \nwork in progress at 15). \n\nAlso, for your research, I encourage you to look into the Jefferson Bible. \nIf you don't know what it is, it is a rewritten form of the bible that \nexplains what the bible teaches without using supernatural or miraculous \n'acts of god'.",

You forget to mention that religion has been \ncited as a reason to kill and control far more times than it has ever been \nused as a means of empowering the meek, feeding the hungry, or alleviating \npoverty.\n\nWe've had at least 100,000 years of religion promising everything and \ndelivering *nothing*, of religion people demeaning the value of human life \nand reassigning credit for what humans do to some ridiculous magical \ninvisible gods.\n\nAll religion does is capitalize on the fears of death and use it to \nmanipulate people, invariably to the detriment of the world.\n\nMeanwhile in 200 years, science has given us treatments and cures for \ndiseases.

Your free to disagree on \nany of my points, in fact i welcome it lol it gives me more to research.

The \nwhole point to that notion is that if bible god was real, and as described \nin the book, the ideas of \"reality\" and \"good\" and \"evil\" go out the \nwindow. The framework under which those words make sense in the real world \nis not the framework of the bible. That is why religion is the handle \ncapable of making good people into monsters when used by bad people.\n\nYou though, you like to say fuck a lot, and act like a condescending \nasshole. You aren't looking for a conversation, just a soap box to vent you \nanger at an empty sky.\n\nSeriously, take a little more time and try and understand the ideas you are \ntalking about. You claim a lot of knowledge but your actions show only \narrogance and ignorance, and those are dangerous combo with or without \nreligion.",

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2\n While I sympathize with your view point you are making some categorical \nerrors. The Easter Bunny is pretty specific. If you asked me about the \nChristian God, or the Bible god I'd agree with you the evidence is \noverwhelmingly against the existence of that thing. When it comes to Elves \nwe have a broader concept, and we would have to define our terms a bit \nhowever I'd say it's safe to say there are no such things. Still Elves are \na concept that would likely generate empirical evidence. Gods are not, \nnecessarily, in that same category.\n\nThere are two basic god ideas, the one that interacts and the one that \ndoesn't In the case of the former the idea comes wrapped up with magic \npowers and when you allow magic as a concept all empirical bets are off. \nIt's frigging magic. So no empirical evidence can be expected because \nfrigging magic. The second kind leaves no evidence because after being the \nprime mover, or first cause, or whatever it takes no further action. It's \npure philosophy, a thought exercise. Interesting, but not empirical and not \nsubject to any kind of physical analysis.\n\nNow if someone comes up to you and says their imaginary friend has powers \nand x will happen if we don't y, well we can test that. All it shows though \nis that said person was delusional or lying.\n\nI find the idea of God (big G) interesting. I would like some aspect of \nmyself to survive my physical death, though I am not counting on it. I \ntreat the idea as philosophical and when I hear a strict empiricist start \ndemanding proof it just seems like well poisoning. There are plenty of \nphilosophical arguments against the existence of god, and even more for \nspecific ideas and any kind of rules or holy texts. I don't need to say, \n\"Show me the evidence\" when I know the idea is one which precludes such.\n\nHypothetically, lets say that there was some empirical evidence of God. How \ncould we possibly evaluate it? Any thing which could point to god could \nalso point to advanced tech or hallucinogens. The only way to know \nconclusively that there was a god would be to be the god, then you would \nhave the faculties to know you were not being deceived.\n\nSecond point. Evil. I've done a video on this, but the short version is, \neven with the suffering and the horror of life you can't use it to brand \ngod as evil any more than you could brand a engrossing novel or video game \nas evil for bad things that happen there. If we accept the idea of gods, \nthen we have bundled up in that mess the notion of souls and alternate \nplanes of reality where we are all imortal and to which we no longer \nremember our that side existances. The events of reality then have to be \njudged through the lens that it's not realty reality, just another \nsimulation. To do otherwise is to dishonor the idea behind the thought \nexperiment.\n\nThis brings me back to the idea that we need to know what we are talking \nabout before the ideas are dismissed. You can certainly say that gods are \nirrelevant to you, but they and the ideas that spawn them are a big part of \nhumanity. If we are ever going to get past the mysticism of our past we \nneed to understand the ideas, and their foibles. Failure to do so will just \nlead to the deification of science, or whatever comes next, by the masses.",

You \nclaim that  at least 2,999 other gods do not exist, but that yours is \nsomehow special.\n\nWhat you and all the rest of the bible thumping morons on here refuse to do \nis to specify exactly how one tells \"fake\" gods from \"real\" gods.\n\nI don't have any questions, I'm demanding an honest answer to a simple \nquestion and not one religious wacko out there is willing to even attempt a \ngenuine answer.\n\nReligious people go on and on and on about how everyone who does not \nbelieve in the right gods will suffer for all eternity - not a trillion \nyears, not a trillion trillion trillion years, but burn in agony for all of \neternity. Then the lowlife, amoral fucks refuse to tell anyone specifically \n*how* to choose the right gods so that they can avoid this horrible fate.\n\nWouldn't you think by now that someone would have written down the \ninstructions on how to decide which gods are real?\n\nShouldn't there be a list of criteria that tell us how to distinguish the \nvoices in our head that are just voices in our head and the ones that are \ntelepathic messages send by the gods?\n\nHow am I supposed to tell whether \"That gal in the skirt is *sexy*\" popped \ninto my head because the gods are communicating telepathically again, or \nbecause 3.5B years of evolution is simply reminding me I should still try \nto breed?\n\nWhy are religious people so immoral? Why won't they tell us what they \nobviously know how to do? They've been through this selection process, they \nknow why they have dismissed all the other gods as fake and chosen their \ngods as the \"real\" ones. Why the fuck won't explain? Do they not give a \nfuck that by their own declaration they condemn every child on Earth to \nsuffer for all eternity, then they sit there with smug looks on their faces \nand say \"Fuck you worthless little kids, suffer and die because I'm not \ntelling anyone how I distinguished between real gods and fake ones!\"\n\nThese religious types aren't here saying \"Well, this is what I think...\". \nThey post absolute claims that they know where the universe came from, what \nthe metaphysical characteristics of the gods who created it are, what those \ngods want, all about the nature and goals of devils, angels, what specific \nevil curses have been cast by the gods, and who and what those gods hate or \nlove,\n\nThen, as if that isn't sufficient arrogance, they flatly declare the \nscientific theory of biological evolution is just a global conspiracy by \nscientists to make religious fundamentalists look like fatuous fucking \nmorons.\n\nTalk to a priest? Sure thing. Priests can come to me and to talk to me, so \nthat I can demonstrate that their pompous and arrogant child molesting \nfuckwittery is precisely that.",

We did not, nor will \nany professional claim that we ever evolved from \"Apes.\" We evolved from a \ncommon ancestor between us and the current primates. Primates are still \naround because they aren't the ones who evolved into us.\n\nEvolution happens in populations, not species. One group of the original \nancestors went off and evolved into ours, and then a group of our ancestors \nbroke off to evolve into something else. That leaves the original \nancestors, our ancestors and another species' ancestor to evolve or split \ninto whatever. This is why all primates look similar, but are genetically \ndifferent than all other species. We don't have 300 - 400 different species \nof primates for nothing. Of course, this had to take a while, so it took \nmillions of years for this to happen.",

One that could literally save billions \nof people from an eternity of hellfire and damnation. You *choose* to \nwithhold the information they need for spiritual salvation.\n\nYou choose to worship gods that you claim are all powerful. Infants and \nchildren get cancer. Your reprehensible beliefs are called into question \nbecause your all powerful gods either cause that cancer directly, or by \ntheir own inaction, allow that cancer to be inflicted on infants and \nchildren. Rather than justify your beliefs, you simply claim special \nprivilege, that people *must* tolerate your beliefs even if you have no \npossible justification.\n\nThat's pretty much exactly what the Saudi hijackers on 9/11 said, isn't it? \nTolerate their beliefs. They believed they'd get 72 virgins and privileged \npositions for their family in the afterlife. What did you do? You didn't \ntolerate their beliefs, you called for killing their families, friends and \nanyone else who believes as they did. Fuck you for being completely \nintolerant of the beliefs of others.\n\nYou worship immoral gods. In fact, I judge your gods to be the lowest form \nof existence in all the universe and not worthy to lick the dog shit from \nmy shoes. I believe them to be vile, immoral sacks of shit. My belief is \nthat anyone who would worship such gods should be ashamed of themselves and \nthat they should be shunned by reasonable people everywhere because the \nindividuals who worship vile and immoral gods are also vile and immoral. In \nfact, I believe I wouldn't piss on those individuals even if they were on \nfire.\n\nShoe: meet other foot.\n\nSo, accept my beliefs. Stop being so intolerant of my beliefs just because \nthey differ from yours.\n\n\nIf you're not going to explain what specific criteria you use to \ndistinguish real gods from fake gods, then you have absolutely nothing to \ncontribute to the human struggle or to human progress.\n\nYou claim that everyone who doesn't believe in your gods will suffer for \nall eternity, but you won't even tell anyone specifically *how* to tell \nreal gods from fake gods, how to tell gods from devils, or even how to tell \ngods from artichokes and bunny rabbits.\n\nI believe you're a sick, subhuman fuck for doing that.\n\nNow run along and be tolerant of my beliefs.",

You're the one who hiked up your skirt and \nare running screaming from a completely innocuous and very simple question.\n\nAnswer the question: What specific criteria do you use to determine which \ngods are real and which are not?\n\nWhat kind of a disingenuous person would demand specific reasoning from \neveryone else yet refuse to provide even a single reasons to believe his \nown claims?\n\nSeriously folks, does anyone need any clearer example of the fundamental \ndishonesty of religion? All of *you* who just say \"well science can't be \nreal because I believe otherwise\" are just as dishonest as this clown is.\n\nWhen you can't answer a simple question like \"What specific criteria do you \nuse to determine what is true and what is false\", you have abandoned reason \nand honesty. More importantly you have abandoned the children of today and \nof every generation to come.\n\nIn the 21st century pretty much everything you have that is good in your \nlife came from scientists and engineers. If you insist that those same \nscientists and engineers are conspiring worldwide just because they \ndisagree with some ancient hand-me-down superstitions scribbled down by \nsome Iron age semi-primitives, you aren't just being unreasonable you're \nbeing ridiculous.\n\nDo you have any respect for this clown, a guy so dishonest that he can't \neven acknowledge, let alone answer, a very simple question about his \nbeliefs?\n\nSo what's different about your beliefs? Can you say specifically what \ncriteria you personally use to determine that all cosmologists are fucking \nidiots or conspiring against your beliefs that the gods created the \nuniverse?\n\nScience is the only method we have for converging on the truth. It's the \n\"agile methodology\" of  human progress. It's the reason your children \naren't dead from cholera or the flu or plague. Reason and science are the \nreason daughters are rarely burned at the stake and sons are rarely \nsacrificed on altars anymore.\n\nThe gods didn't rescind their demands for human sacrifice and retribution, \nthose events are rare because reason and science showed that human \nsacrifice didn't produce better crop yields or end plagues. On the rare \ntimes they do happen, it's *because* religion is still tolerated.\n\nWhy stop human progress now? What happens when your child suffers a spinal \ninjury that leaves them permanently disabled where stem cell research \n*might* have provided a treatment for the injury? Religion makes the claim \nthat sort of research will make the gods angry. Are you still going to put \nup with primitive idiocy like that when it's your great grandchildren's \nlives they're fucking with? If so, do you really consider it moral to deny \nthem treatment because of an ancient superstition that says a clump of 150 \ncells has a magical soul?\n\nWith what generation will we stop taking \"it will anger the gods\" as an \nexcuse for anything? Why not make it *your* generation that finally puts an \nend to it?\n\nReason and science will move us forward. We have endless examples of that. \nYou can put your hands on multiple pieces of tangible evidence of that \nwithout even leaving the chair you're sitting in. The screen you're reading \nthis on works, doesn't it? We're driving rovers around on Mars, aren't we?\n\nCompare that to religion. Hundreds, maybe thousands of children *RIGHT NOW* \nare starving to death or dying from HIV infections in Africa and other \nplaces because religious people claim that condoms will make the gods \nangry. Look at Kevin Carter's famous photograph. Study it. Do you really \nwant to be a part of the tradition that created the conditions he \nphotographed?\n\nYou can claim that those aren't your beliefs, that your version of religion \ndoesn't do that, but when you argue that everyone has a right to their own \nbeliefs, you're complicit. If you assert that no one can make value \njudgements on belief systems then *you* are endorsing that behaviour and \nthe behaviour of the 19 Saudis who crashed airplanes into buildings on 9/11.\n\nThere is such a thing as right and wrong, If you choose religion over \nreason and science, it's easily demonstrated that you're on the wrong side.\n\nChoose reason. Ask how we know something is true and *demand* a reasonable \nanswer to the question. If there isn't a reasonable answer then it's not \nvaluable and it's also extremely unlikely to produce any rules or reasoning \nthat is valuable.",

If they had OSCARS Awards Ceremonies that \npraised all categories for asshole-ism, you'd be given every award under \nthe sun. \n\nOK, by seeing the example you've given about USA's statistics, I see you've \nonly been given historic information about the USA. I studied history in \nLondon. I don't know how differently they do things over there, but I am \nencouraged to do my own historical research to avoid being given subjective \ndata which produces pricks like you. During my years of researching, I \nfound out a shocking fact that not all wars are caused by religion! *gasp*\n\nSince we like giving out statistics, let's look at some of these:\n\nIn the book of 'Encyclopedia of Wars' I see that we have about 7% of wars \nwere caused by religion accounting 2% of wars that occurred during the \ncause of 1763. If we'd like to go back to 'ancient world' times, we'll see \nthat most wars were rarely based on religion. Medieval wars were based on \nwealth. Renaissance based their conflicts on simply control. It seems that \nthey have more important things to worry about like controlling borders, \nterritorial conquest, or simply reacting to an 'ugly comment' that one \npolitical party said to another. In fact, it sounds a lot like today's \nstandards. Seems like the world hasn't changed much despite the drop in the \nreligious followers' numbers. \n\nIf we look at modern wars like the American Revolution, the American Civil \nWar, World War I, Napoleonic Campaign, the Russian Revolution, though \nreligious people were targeted in some of these conflicts, religion was not \nthe cause of them. \n\nIf we'd like to talk about genocide, over 170 million civilians were killed \nduring the cause of the 20th Century, which had nothing to do with religion \n(most of which caused by Communist laws in China & Russia); while about 33 \nmillion military deaths. \n\nOverall, there's an estimated 203,000,000 deaths during the 20th Century;\n\nSure, the Bible has note on many wars and conflict in them, but I'm sure if \nwe recorded all the non-religious wars and conflict that occurred since the \nBible was written, I can almost guarantee that the book would be a lot \nfucking thicker. \n\nInstead of me going to 'fuck myself', maybe it would be a lot more \nbeneficial to the world if you went and 'fucked' a few history books, mate. \n\nBlimey, some people. \u00ac\u00ac",

Given that it is used daily as a reason to retard human \ndevelopment, oppress, jail, torture and kill people all around the world, \nit is *the* place that the world should look for how not to raise their \nkids.\n\nYou're simply making an excuse for religion, but how do you know your claim \nis true? How do you know that if people were raised to be humanists and \nrationalists that they'd be as easy to rouse for wars and murder the way \nreligious people are?\n\nReligion and science *CANNOT* coexist, I do not understand why anyone with \na rational cell left in their brain says otherwise. We see it over and over \nand over and over again, in every corner of the world. Look at the USA, the \nfruitcakes are blocking medical research, they blocking the delivery of \nwestern medicine both in the USA and in foreign countries, they're \ndemanding that their religion be taught in fucking science classes!\n\nWe *have* statistics, we *know* for an absolute fact that prohibiting the \ndistribution of condoms, prohibiting the distribution of family planning \ninformation, restricting abortions and promoting prison terms and even the \ndeath penalty for homosexual acts is killing tens of thousands of people \nevery fucking year.\n\nHow do you get that religion and rational thought/science to coexist? \nReligion is the antithesis of science, religion is by definition the \nexplicit rejection of empirical reality, it is the explicit acceptance of \nsupernatural beings and supernatural/magical processes and events in spite \nof all the evidence against the existence of such crap.\n\nI do not for one second buy the argument that \"moderate\" religion is \ncompatible with humanist values or with science, because as soon as you \ndeclare that the supernatural is real and that the gods make their will \nknown to humans, then humans (and politicians who use humans) are going to \nstart declaring wars on everything that isn't their brand of religion.\n\nThere's a reason they put the escape clause into the clinical definition of \ndelusional specifically for religion - because religion truly is a mental \nillness. The deeper the beliefs, the more ill the person is.\n\nOh, and go fuck yourself, I'll point out how evil religion is whenever and \nwherever I want.\n\nOf course, any time you feel up to shaming me into going away with my tail \nbetween my legs, knock yourself out. All you have to do is enumerate the \nspecific criteria you applied to all the other gods when you rejected them \nand chose your own gods as the only \"real\" ones.\n\nOr perhaps you'd like to explain how you personally being able to \nunderstand and converse with the only \"real\" gods doesn't qualify as \narrogant fuckwittery of the most supreme sort?",

You come in demanding \"respect\" for \nyour superstitions and then you say that everyone else should prefer to die \nrather than annoy your imaginary gods.\n\nLike I said, you *earn* respect, you don't demand it. The only thing you've \nearned is abuse and ridicule, and perhaps a free ticket to an insane \nasylum. Probably a mention in the Museum of Self Hatred.\n\nIf you want to commit suicide rather than make the gods mad at you, then go \nthe fuck ahead and kill yourself (please!)\n\nThe law on apostacy doesn't apply to your own useless fucking hide though, \ndoes it? It applies to killing *other* people should they ever come to the \nrealization that their religion is just ignorant and hateful Iron age \nsuperstitions. Nice (and extremely cowardly) dodge there, but it doesn't \nwork in the outside world. You are used to making excuses for the \npremeditated murder of human beings, it's part of your religion. The \nnon-religious and the non-fundamentalists of the world are capable of \nreasoning out that killing in the name of religion is *always* wrong. \nOutside of Islam, even *children* can reason that much out.\n\n How fucking arrogant can you possibly get? Everyone on Earth should prefer \nto die rather than disagree with your superstitions? Really? That is beyond \nfucked up.\n\nThen you go on to describe your fantasies about the outside world, where it \nconsists only of immoral creatures and sexual depravity. Only in the tiny, \nsheltered, ignorant and vicious world created by your hideous fucking \nreligion can you find this sick and twisted outside world. Nowhere in \nreality does it actually exist.\n\nLies and false dichotomies is all you seem capable of speaking when you \nimagine the outside world. You should stick to just making excuses for \npremeditated murder rather than venturing into claims about the outside \nworld that you clearly have never allowed yourself to experience.\n\nYou can't even tell us what specific rational, testable criteria you \napplied to all the thousands of other gods when you decided to reject all \nof them as false. You want us to accept that you simply managed to get \nlucky and picked the right gods? You are one *supremely* fucking arrogant \nbit of pig shit! Fuck you for demanding that all of humanity outside of \nyour shithole world cannot be moral because they don't follow *your* \npersonal randomly chosen gods!\n\nI do want to thank you for posting your response. You see, Christians in \ngeneral and Catholics in particular used to paint these horrific pictures \nof the \"perfidious Jews\" (the official Catholic description of Jews until \n1966) claiming that the Jews used to drink the blood of Christian children \nand all sorts of other vile nonsense. Of course they were forced to retract \nto claims because they were clearly lies with no evidence to support them. \nThe sick nature of their own words exposes them for what they have been, \nand what they still are based on: superstitious fuckwittery. It is their \nAchilles heel to this day.\n\nLikewise, thanks to ignorant savages like you running around trying to make \nexcuses for your primitive and twisted beliefs, secular humanists will \n*never* be forced to retract any claims made about religions and it \nfollowers. Your supreme arrogance is documented for all to see, in your own \nwords. Your sick and twisted claims about what the world outside of your \nbubble of superstition is supposedly like stand on their own. *You* are the \nAchilles heel of Islam.\n\nIt's your own words that fuel the fire on which religion is being slowly \nroasted. You can't blame it on outsiders, or on misinterpretations, or on \nanything else because the words and sick/hateful rationalizations come \ndirectly from your own hand.\n\nThere are great museums in this world. There are fantastic libraries. There \nare immense efforts in science and technology going on today. We've created \ncures for diseases, we're driving rovers around on Mars, we're learning how \nto treat all sorts of illnesses and injuries, we can transplant hearts and \nlungs from one human to another. We can repair birth defects, we can build \nairplanes that can fly around the entire fucking planet using nothing but \nenergy from the sun!\n\nWhen I say we, I mean everyone outside of the world of Islam except for a \ntiny handful of exceptions (so tiny and so exceptional that they've even \ngot their own fucking wiki page!) You backwards fucking fundamentalist \nsavages have contributed *nothing* to *any* of those efforts. Even fucking \nshitbag Scientologists have contributed as much or more to modern science \nand technology than all the billions of Muslims have.\n\nAll that Islam ever does (or can) talk about is what they contributed to \nscience a thousand years ago. They point with great (and justified) pride \nto what they accomplished back then - when they weren't so fucking \nreligious and so fucking arrogant.\n\nEvery time you get treated with modern medicine, every child of yours that \ndoesn't die in infancy, every wife you ever have that doesn't die in \nchildbirth, every airplane you fly on, every time you use the internet, \nevery computer you ever touch, pretty much everything that improves your \nlives or the the lives of the ones you love, you owe your gratitude for \nthose benefits to the people you claim are immoral and cursed by your gods.\n\nListen to the call to prayer over the PA system. Guess who you owe for that \nPA system? All of us immoral, sexually depraved, open-minded, rational, \ngenerous, loving, capable people, the people you despise so deeply, the \nones you insult with your words and your actions, you can thank all of us \nfor every fucking thing that's good in  your life.\n\nThe violence and hatred going on outside your door and across the world? \nWell, you can thank Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions for that. \nHumanists have invented all sorts of things, but it is religion that daily \nreinvents the concept of \"justifiable fratricide.\"  Give thanks to them for \nthe kids dying in Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan. The gods are on \ntheir sides. no matter which side they're on. Go out, enjoy the fruits of \nyour religion.\n\nI'd suggest not shaving before you go outside though, because some vile, \nignorant and savage piece of shit may decide that you should prefer to die \nrather than anger your gods by not wearing a beard.",

Just in this case, So I \nGoogle it and found the website I mentioned first and the translation I \nfounded first.\n\nThe Qur'an is the word of Allah, So it's hard to translate. And everyone is \ntranslating it according to the meaning he's thinking every part is mean.\n\nIf you read this verse in Arabic it would be so obvious that that what is \nmean.\n\nLet's be fair, If you get this verses in Arabic and even translate them \nwith Google Translate it will get this meaning.\n\nIn the 1400 years you talking about, People never heard about universe or \nplanets. If I read the same verse 1000 years ago. And it's literary like \nthat... \"The skies we build it powerfully and we are (and always) expanding \nit\".\nI translated this part... And it's obvious what it's mean.\nBut if I lived before 1000 years I will understand it this why...\n\"The heaven we built it powerfully and are expanding it\".\nI have nothing called universe way back, And because it's something need \npower to build and it's expanding so it's heaven, Heaven is something \ngreat, It must be heaven.\n\n\u064fLike a verse about black holes... It's said:\n\n\"Fala oqsimu bilkhunnas, Aljawari alkunnas\"\n\nI will translate it word by word...\n\nFala: Something like \"And I\" used in Arabic to strongly confirm and force a \nphrase.\noqsimu: I swear.\nbilkhunnas: By khunnas, Kunnas mean the disappeared or invisible.\nAljawari: That are moving, Or running.\nalkunnas: Brooming, Also in Arabic we use this word to describe the vacuum \ncleaner, We only add electric to it.\n\nOther thing, In my opinion I believe that sky on Qur'an mean universe. And \nskies mean mean multiverse. So according to Qur'an the big bang not created \nonly our universe, But all the multiverse.\n\nOther thing (personal believe again), The Qur'an is mentioning more that \nonce 7 skies, As I said it's the multiverse... So 7 universes... Just as \nthe M theory mention.",

If you choose the latter option, what reason have we \nto think modern muslims know what it says, given that they are much further \nremoved from Mohammed in time?\n\nRegarding 21:30 Tafsir al-Jalalayn interprets it like this:\n\n*\"Have they not ([one may] read a-wa-lam or a-lam) realised, [have they \nnot] come to know, those who disbelieve, that the heavens and the earth \nwere closed together and then We parted them, We made seven heavens and \nseven earths \u2014 or [it is meant] that the heaven was parted and began to \nrain, when it did not use to do so, and that the earth was parted and began \nto produce plants, when it did not use to do so; and We made, of water, \n[the water] that falls from the heaven and that springs from the earth, \nevery living thing?, in the way of plants and otherwise: in other words, \nwater is the cause of such [things] having life. Will they not then \nbelieve?, by affirming My Oneness?\"*\n\nNow, I assume you were of the opinion that the verse said something about \nthe big bang. Would you agree that we can completely rule this out, for \nexample due to the discussion of rainfall in this process, unless 1400 \nyears of islamic scholarship was all false? Because this is not a minor \nauthority I'm quoting here. Muslims have never interpreted it the way you \nare pushing it and you are arguably using a modern revisionist translation \nthat's written specifically to be able to make the argument you are making \n- unrelated to what the Qur'an actually says.",

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2 I am flabbergasted. Not many people admit to being a \nbully. \nQuote: \"There is no anger involved in any of my posts. Period. Derision is \nnot anger.\" \"As for stopping the insults to religion, have you ever heard \nthe response 'Not only no, but fuck no?'\"\nYou have, in essence said: I know that I am hurting people, but they \ndeserve it and I won't stop. Which is tantamount to admitting your a bully \nwith nothing better to do and no respect for the well-being of others.\n\n Your tacit position that your derision is a method for protecting people \nis inaccurate. You use a false dilemma against anyone who does not want to \ninsult the other camp. Your argument is that by not insulting the other \nside, you are allowing them to harm children. This is an especially weak \nargument, because A) Regal290 has already suggested more effective \nalternatives to your method of curbing ignorance B) It\u2019s not clear how \ninsults actually stop child molestation C) It\u2019s quite obvious that there \nare many more methods of stopping child molestation, such as careful \nparenting and police work. You have a tandem argument about mental \nmolestation (kudos on the rhetoric, by the by), that the children are being \nindoctrinated against the truth. Unfortunately, it's also unclear how \ninsults would convince someone to raise their child differently. I suppose \nit\u2019s possible, by creating enough hate, you could initiate an ethnic \ncleansing and destroy the infidels, there by killing/orphaning the children \nto protect them. But at that point I think it\u2019s quite clear the welfare of \nthe children was not the point. So your argument that your derision and \ninsults are a method of protecting of others seems unmerited.\n\nIt follows from this that, lacking alternatives, you either hurt people \nbecause you enjoy it, or because you believe you must (or both). That you \nmust, seems obviously false: it achieves nothing other than hurting them, \nand you have already show some care for the well-being of others in your \nconversations about molestation. Unless you view yourself as an avenger, in \nwhich case it would be nice to see some evidence that any of the people you \nare attacking have done something worthy or avenging. If that something is \nnothing more than disagreeing with you, then I would fall back to my \nstatement about \u2018childishness\u2019. It is childish to hurt people for simply \ndisagreeing.\n\nIn response to your response to me: Sir you are childish at the very moment \nyou decide to insult a straw-man, and that is all you are doing. Adults \nfight real battles, against living opponents. But you have made it very \nclear, from your setting up of an obviously simplistic and false version of \nChristian beliefs, that you have no interest in that. You would much rather \na hollow meaningless victory.\n\nYou have inaccurately portrayed a number of elements of the religious life, \nbut lets just start with some of the big ones. The circular argument you \npoint out ( I believe in Pink Elf because the bible says so, I believe in \nthe bible because Pink Elf says so) is ultimately fallacious. The religious \nbelieve in deities, texts are merely a path. It would be like saying that \nscholars believe in books, when in fact that\u2019s just how they gain access to \nthe material they are studying. You point to moral corruption among the \nreligious, which is an ad hominem attack. Teacher molestation do not make \nevery person through public education worthy of ridicule and derision, and \ndo not make the evolution I learned in school false. Bad people in the \nenemy camp do not make their arguments any less valid. \n\nYou use broad, ill fitting, generalizations to refer to all with religious \nbeliefs. For example: \u201cThese people are molesting children. They are \ndiminishing the health and well being of the entire species by molesting \nthe minds of children.\u201d This is clearly, and patently, untrue. SOME \nreligious people are molesting children. SOME religious people are \nportraying truths inaccurately. But your banal painting of a world where \nevery religious person is a monster, is simply not backed by the evidence. \nIf that were true, I would be very shocked to find that a Christian nation \nlike the USA has laws against child molestation. Would be pretty silly of \nthose religious politicians to make laws against what they and many of \ntheir constituents are doing wouldn't it? Furthermore, the assertion \nignores and denies the existence of non-religious pedophiles, helping to \nperpetuate myths about sexual abuse and continuing a cycle of lies and \ndamage. After all, a child is far more likely to be molested by a relative \nthan a anyone else. You're using the victims of sexual assault as pawns in \nyour sad little argument. \n\nAnd that brings us to the argument from absurdity. Lets play your game. You \nshouldn't believe anything that seems silly when simplified? I go and smash \nmy fingers against some buttons every day to change the pictures on a box. \nIn exchange, someone presses some other buttons, to tell another person \nthat I have papers. I go to the other person to get papers, and give these \npapers to my landlord. She lets me sleep inside a warm box where I keep my \nthings, but always needs more papers before she will let me stay there. \nReduction is the finest form of comedy because human life is ludicrous at \nits very core. This is why the argument is so weak. It has nothing to do \nwith which nouns you substitute; a rose would smell as sweet. \n\nBut lets do the noun game too while we're here. Lets say I believe that \ngummy bears come together to form little collectives, and that these \ncollectives stick to other gummy bears collectives, which all work together \nand form a big, talking, thinking, feeling thing. Silly, until you \nsubstitute gummy bears with \u201cAtoms\u201d or \u201cMolecules\u201d and suddenly it \nmagically is believable (because it\u2019s true). Words have meanings, and what \nnoun you use really does matter. \n\nOne more, tiny note. You seem to posit science as the source of all moral \nreasoning. I may just be reading that into your responses, so please \ncorrect me if I\u2019m wrong. This has always been a sticky way of doing things. \nEugenicists have often used a corrupted version of science to stand in as a \nmoral guide. This is stupid, because obviously science is a descriptive, \nnot a prescriptive, study. While I don\u2019t want to say that you are in the \nsame camp, I think that anyone who wants to place science as a moral \nauthority should think very carefully about the implications of that \nthought. \n\nI do not mind strong arguments, and I can certainly take some rough \nhousing. But what I don\u2019t like to see is people using invalid argumentation \nto try to push hatred and misinformation on other people. There are already \nenough lies and deception out there, and I really do believe that if you \nuse better argumentative methods, you will not only get at the truth more \nfully, but you will also be able to convince others.\n\nP.S. Of course beanie babies are big! you can get a box full of them for a \ndollar at any garage sale! Who doesn't want cheap pillow fort projectiles! \n(Never heard of a salad shooter though, sorry that one is over my head)",

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2 Actually, I do know the difference between criticizing \nsomeone and describing something to someone. To describe is to lay out \nfacts and details on the table. Example, \"Your book believes that one god \nor another created the universe\" (general description of most religions).\n\nTo critique someone is to explain in detail why someone's opinion is wrong. \nExample, \"Philosophical, mystical books written by mankind have a tendency \nof using abstract and vague language to get across so-called prophetic \npoints\" (TheMathShaman, his first comment).\n\nThen, let's take it a step forward. An intolerant or boorish critique is a \ncritique that not only explains why the viewpoint is wrong, but then goes \non to explain why the person should feel bad for having ever believed it. \nExample, \"You'll be ridiculed as a superstitious idiot with no idea what \nhe's talking about. I love that part in your book where stars fall from the \nsky. You've got some real hardcore fucking science.\" (You.)\n\nYou say that if something is obviously wrong, then telling someone why it's \nwrong isn't a critique.

In your most recent comment (the \nmost recent as of this response), you actually described the difference \nbetween a critique and an intolerant human being.\n\nSee, there's nothing wrong with a critique. In fact, I agree with you, and \nI've been stressing that point this entire time: Organized, dogmatic \nreligion is obviously false. We get it. The Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny \ndon't exist. Thor didn't make the universe (actually, even in Norse myths, \nhe didn't--it was Odin. I get the gist of it, but still. Facts). As far as \nI'm concerned, any religion that follows a book, especially millenia-old \nbooks, is at LEAST 80% fiction, probably more.\n\nHere's what I would say if presented with a practitioner of Islam: \"I don't \nbelieve you, and here's a detailed explanation of why you're wrong.\"\n\nNow, here's the difference between you and me. You're gonna love this one. \nReady? Ok, here's what you would say--actually, what you DID say in your \nfirst comment: \"Here are a multitude of extremely basic, preschool-level \nfacts that prove that you're a childish, sexist, infinitely old moron who's \nobsessed with genocidal gods, because you believe in something that's \nobviously wrong.\"\n\nSee the difference? And yet, we both functionally said almost the exact \nsame thing.\n\nYou and I, we're not so different. We both believe that organized religion \nisn't true. Hell, neither of us believe in a single, sentient being known \nas \"God\" (I'm making the assumption that you're atheist--just correct me if \nI'm wrong). But people are going to argue against you more, disagree with \nyou more, dislike you more, and overall resist your claims more, for the \nsheer fact that when you point something out, from the little that I know \nabout you, I can tell that you feel the need to insult someone alongside \nyour critique. And maybe that's who you are, someone who insults people \nbecause they're wrong. Or maybe it isn't who you are, and your views on \nreligion are more complex than you've led the internet to believe. If \nthat's the case, I strongly recommend you make that clear now, because your \ncurrent representation isn't doing you any favours. \n\nThe way I see it, there are two types of childish.\n\nThe first is the one you described: believing in fairy tales, denying \nreality because you like your own world better (actually, Afraz was trying \nto reconcile the two when you shot him down, so not even that swings your \nway), and general disillusionment. Believing in something that most anyone \ncan see is false, like an imaginary friend. You are correct. That is \nchildish. But it's a nice type of childish, one that I'm sure most people \nwent through at some point. Some people are still stuck in it. Some people \nembrace it. It's FUN. It's HAPPY. In most cases--not all, but most--it does \nno one harm. To this child, we gently say that the Easter Bunny isn't real, \ngently tell them the truth, and let them choose to believe you and adapt or \ngo on living in their own little world. \n\nThe second type is throwing a tantrum when things aren't all the same. When \nthings go wrong, and when things defy what the childish person thinks is \nright, they get defensive. They get irritable. They don't want anything to \ndo with the different one, and to prove how different they are, they throw \na tantrum. This is the child that becomes the bully. The one that becomes \nan oppressor. This is the child that later in life has to surround himself \nwith the same people as him, because when something different and wrong \napproaches him, he needs to strike it down, to distance himself from it. To \nshow the world that he's the opposite of this weird, messed up thing. To \nthis child, we send to his room, punish him, and scold him, because it's \nWRONG to make others feel bad, even when you have the benefit of being \ncorrect in your assertions.\n\n\nPlease stop insulting religion just for the sake of insulting it. Even if \nit's wrong, you should point it out from an objective, factual standpoint. \nYou shouldn't personally insult everyone who practices it.\n\nIf you don't like it, stay as far away from it as possible. Ignore those \nwho try to talk to you about it, and if they insist on trying to get you to \nbelieve them, then you gently dissuade them. You don't go on a tirade how \neveryone who goes contrary to the facts of the 21st century is a bumbling \nmoron. Just... Let them be. Unless you get personally involved, which is \nyour own damn fault, there's no reason it should affect you. Especially \nhere on the internet, where instead of sparking this huge, pointless \ndebate, you could have downvoted, laughed to yourself, and closed the video.\n\nGood day, sir. ",

The original comment \nwas \"Would anyone here hate me if I pointed out that my religion addresses \nthis topic?\" Hardly an \"ancient cultist,\" to be sure. Not 100% true, mind \nyou, since the religion DIDN'T actually address the topic, but it wasn't \nworded in a threatening way. At most, all you know about Afraz at this \npoint is that he's Muslim and that he wants to reconcile his religion with \nscience.\n\nAnd then, the response! Oh, the response... Not just you, but EVERYONE! The \ngeneral response has been, \"No, I won't hate you for pointing that out, but \nI will despise you and publicly humiliate you for believing in that \nreligion to begin with.\" Of course, by saying that myself, I run the risk \nof generalization, but with you, Alex Anderson, and ExperienceCounts2, I \nthink my point gets across for this particular instance just fine. And you \nwanna know the worst part? The very first reply to that original post--the \nVERY FIRST, from TheMathShaman--responded exactly how you did, but in a \ncivilized manner, without insulting Afraz or Islam specifically, while \naddressing the general inconsistencies with religion as a whole. WITHOUT \nsounding like a total douche. And yet, despite seeing the issue already \nresolved, you (not you specifically, the general you, as in those who \nopenly mock religion) HAD to bring the issue back up, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. \n\nYou're right about everything you said regarding the interpretations, and I \npersonally think you're right about Islam being flat-out incorrect. I don't \ndeny a single word of that. But if you add in stuff that has no purpose but \nto insult the religion as a whole, as if Afraz's believing in a single \nirrational belief is a mistake that can never be forgiven, you sound like \nan intolerant human being who doesn't understand that fact that some people \nWANT something to believe in beyond pure science (one of the reasons I'm \npantheist instead of atheist, actually). Really, that part about \n\"thankfully, they're all blowing themselves up\" was extremely uncalled for. \nEXTREMELY. Even if, in your eyes, it makes people like Afraz look \nridiculous to follow what you call driveling nonsense, you don't need to \nget up in front of everyone, point and laugh, and encourage others to do \nthe same. At worst, you chuckle a bit at what you perceive to be stupidity, \nand keep on walking.\n\nSeriously, I know this is the internet, people, but can't we just have a \nLITTLE bit of tolerance?",

There's an ayaat \ndescribing the creation of the universe. How at the start, everything we \nknow of was at a small point, which was then expanded rapidly.\"*\n\nThis is an outright lie. What it actually says is something like this \"Can \nthey not see that the heavens and the earth were joined together at some \npoint and were cloven apart\" or something like that. The bit about \n\"expansion\" is a modern translation unheard of before the 1970s and is not \nfound in any tafsirs either, while there are tafsirs that contradict it(for \nexample from al-Jalalayn, look it up, it's available on altafsir.com for \nexample). What it's actually talking about is Allah *adding to* the \ncreation in a similar sense as adding mashed potatoes to a plate. That is, \nhe creates man, mountains blah blah.\n\nIn any case, the joining together of the heavens and the earth actually \nrefers to is the ancient Babylonian creation myth where the primordial \nsalty and fresh waters are joined together in the beginning and are parted \nby the creator god to reveal dry land. He erects the invisible firmament to \nhold up the fresh space ocean that all ancient people knew existed due to \nfresh rain dripping down from above at regular intervals.(This is further \nnailed down in other parts of the Qur'an that talks about how the fresh and \nsalty oceans don't mix - referring to how the sky and the ocean meet in the \ndistance. This was a great problem for ancient people and Islam's answer is \nthat Allah decreed that the two seas shouldn't mix even though they touch. \nNeedless to say, this is an imaginary problem rooted in a long discarded \ncosmology, even 1400 years ago, and an utter embarrassment to Islam.)\n\n*\"The book also mentions the continuing expansion of space, describes the \natmosphere (and the ozone layer) and also mentions osmosis.\"*\n\nNo, it doesn't. If you are talking about the 7 heavens, realize that the \nQur'an also says that the stars are fastened to the lowest heaven and that \nthe moon is placed in one of the middle heavens. It is confused drivel that \nwas embarrassing nonsense even 1400 years ago. Islam could never have \narisen in Greece for example, where they had a far superior understanding \nof these things even 1000 years earlier when Aristotle demonstrated the \nshape and size of the earth using the earth's shadow on the moon during an \neclipse. It required a profoundly ignorant bunch of bloodthirsty Bedouins \nto get going to the point where it was powerful enough to execute any \ncritics.\n\n*\"It's fine if you don't agree with my views, everyone has their own \nopinion :)\"*\n\nOk... so now your objective claims about supernatural revelations reduce to \nanyone having their own opinions... it is my contention that you do this \nlargely because you can't do jack to defend your absurd assertions. But it \nreally is not about opinion. We know for a fact what the early muslims \nbelieved the Qur'an said and what you're peddling here is not it.\n\n*\"My comment was aimed at those people who try to insult, mock or humiliate \nanyone who tries to share his/her beliefs. You know, the douchebags who try \nto appear smart by putting down everyone else.\"*\n\nWe do this because your beliefs are profoundly irrational and you cultists \nare apparently immune to being corrected on your own factual errors and \ninconsistencies, forever repeating the same lies and revisionist \ninterpretations of your ancient texts.\n\nThe truth is that you would have been executed by Mohammed had you traveled \nback in time and told him about your interpretation about the big bang. He \nwas a flat earther who believed in a space ocean held up by the invisible \nfirmament. If you doubt this I suggest you buy a copy of Tabari's history \nand look up Mohammed's detailed explanations of how the sun and the moon \nrace in chariots pulled by angels and how they sometimes fall into the deep \nend of the heavenly ocean due to signs from Allah etc. This stuff could \nnever have been published in the muslm world were the views not generally \nheld as reasonable to hold.\n\nThere are other things as well, like how the rules about when to eat and \nfast on Ramadan don't even generalize to a spherical earth. Beyond the \npolar circles fasting would either not be required at all or you'd be \nforced to starve for a month depending on whether Ramadan falls on the time \nof the midnight sun or winter darkness. The whole thing is laughably \nprovincial. But it's not just that it's false. The garbage also provides \nimmoral shit that kills many thousands of people each year via Islam's \nmartyrdom doctrine and promises of extra rewards in the afterlife for dying \nfighting the infidels. This is of course just a minor contemporary concern \nas Islamic imperialism has killed many millions all over the world through \nthe process of spreading \"the religion of peace\". Thankfully, muslims are \nmostly blowing themselves up at the moment due to sectarianism having made \ninfidels out of them all as seen from other muslim sects.",

To a lesser extent, the same is true about \nNewton.\n\nMeaning, religious \"idiots,\" as you call them, aren't idiots. Not even \nclose. Even if everything in the BIble, or Qur'an, or Torah, or Dharma (am \nI forgetting anyone?) is completely fucked up (which, not everything is. \nJust a good percentage), that wouldn't make a highly religious person any \nstupider than the average non-religious person.\n\nAnd for all your analysis, for all the empirical evidence the world as to \noffer... Who's to say that God didn't just point and say \"Let there be \nscience\"?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't personally believe in any singular \ndeity/deities or higher being that could be called \"God\" (pantheism, \nanyone?), but you really have no proof that they're wrong, either--God \ncan't be proven or disproven, only believed in or not.\n\nAdditionally, as for that quote you gave at the beginning, trying to \nexemplify the ludicrousness of holy books, I'd like to make an example out \nof that, to prove a point. So, if you'll just bear with me a little longer, \nI'll explain.\n\nAlthough it's hard to tell which religious book you're quoting form, since, \nyou know, you don't specify which one, but in every instance that I've ever \nseen--Bible, Torah, Qur'an, and their respective commentaries--that \nparticular line only refers to the heavens shaking as stars fall from the \nsky. Of course, you scoff at this even still, but even secular minds refer \nto meteorites that enter the atmosphere as shooting stars. Given this, it \nseems extremely unfair to restrict religious types to only actual stars, \nwhen many atheists aren't willing to make that restriction on themselves. \nOr, even if it does refer to actual stars in the scientific sense, that \njust limits them to condensed masses of hydrogen and helium. And, as most \npeople know, it's not impossible for a huge, flaming fireball to drop from \nthe sky. Just look at bombs. Or napalm. Or literally anything else that \nexplodes violently. Additionally, in any reading I've encountered, It never \nmentions dropping \"into oceans\" or \"being quenched,\" just dropping. No \nquenching involved. But, even if I just haven't encountered the line you're \nreferring to, and you AREN'T misquoting to make yourself seem more credible \nthan your opponent (why would someone so against organized religion be \nreading holy books, anyway?), it's a moot point--it need not be waxing \nprophetic, it might be waxing POETIC instead. It might not literally mean a \nhuge ball of fire is going to descend from the sky and turn the ocean to \nsteam. Don't authors and poets often refer to the sunset as sinking down \ninto the ocean, or down into the horizon? And if that's the case, are \npeople from a thousand years ago not allowed to write in poetic speech? \nBecause in my experience (not an ironclad rule, but from what I've seen), \nthe quality and quantity of poetic speech has declined in recent times, not \nincreased. It could just mean that one by one, stars in the sky will stop \nshining. And although unlikely, it's not impossible that since supernovas \nwill continue in humanity's future, we won't be able to see nearly as many \nstars in the sky remaining, meaning the interpretation isn't \"stars will \ndrop,\" but \"in the future, there won't be as many stars,\" a highly \ndefensible argument. Plus, the whole point is moot--remember that we aren't \nnecessarily dealing with actual stars.\n\nBasically, what that huge block of text you probably just skipped instead \nof reading (and if you did, then don't call me an idiot or something \nsimilar for insinuating that you didn't, because that would be rude and \nhighly uncalled for) says is that your argument isn't \"You people are all \nworthless, idiotic, sexist maggots for believing the impossible,\" but \nrather \"You people are all worthless, idiotic, sexist maggots for believing \nin what I think is impossible because the probability that it is true is \nlow.\" \n\nSomething else I'd like to bring up is that it's highly unfair to indict \n88% of the world for believing in organized religion. Unless, of course, \nyou were referring only to religious zealots who are just as bad as you \nare, the ones who try to force religion on you as if there was no \nalternative, the same as the atheists who love to insult anyone who ISN\"T \natheist (I know that the majority of atheists aren't like that, but let's \nbe honest--the ones who are give the rest a bad name, just like religious \nzealots), in which case you should make that clear and not insult was \namounts to nine tenths of the world.\n\nOne last argument I want to relate is that on a basic level, although an \nextremely well-worded argument could defeat most organized religions (you \nknow, an argument with better wording than your angry tirade), that doesn't \nprove you right. See above for the \"Let there be science\" example. In other \nwords, even if they're wrong, you don't get the authority to act as if \nyou're right.\n\nAlso, one last word to you. Einstein was a devout Jew and Newton was \nChristian, during a time period where Christianity was still accepted as \nnear-fact, and he BELIEVED it, too. To them, at least, it wasn't a forced \nchoice between \"physics exist\" and \"God exists.\" And, from a logical \nstandpoint, it shouldn't be.\n\nNow, given all the above--and remember that I don't believe in God any more \nthan you do...\n\nStill think that religious people are stupid?",

The only sad thing is that he's wasting \nhis life away here on youtube arguing out of pure hatred that he so \nvisciously harbors against those who believe in some kind of a magic toilet \npaper that has the ability to wash all our shit away forever. Somehow I get \nthe feeling that he truly believes that evil can exist only in the form of \nmonstrosities such as murder or human sacrifice, if there is any difference \nbetween the two. Money is one form of evil that does not need any gods, \neastern or western. Gentrification, Agent Orange, Operation Shamrock, CIA, \nprison industrial complex locking up potheads who would share even their \nfucking lives with you, and that's exactly how altruistic they usually are \nwhen you come into contact with them.

It does not mean that they \nare right, but it is enough proof for me to see that they are not some evil \nbunnies trying to kill us all. Why do they need to follow reason when they \nseem to be happy? Religion has less power than the Rockefellers and other \nsuch families in this century, so I cannot see any reason why we should \nstill try and make it disappear. This right here seems to me rather a fight \nagainst religion as a concept, not the evils of its conduct. The man with \nso much experience waiting dormant somewhere in the voids of his brain \nfails to understand that evil will not be exterminated by simply erasing \nreligion. The only path through which we can achieve that for which we \nstrive for, a better, almost perfect humanity, is the path that people do \nnot dare to tread. We have been taught by capitalism that to follow our own \ngoals and capitalize on them is the only important thing, so how is it even \npossible to follow one goal that would profit the whole of humanity?

Brainwashing children? Spreading \nhomophobia? Settling the issue of whether the gods hate foreskin? Telling \neveryone that every other religion in all of history is \"wrong\"?\n\nBTW, fuck you for lying. *This* is what the bible actually teaches about \nnon-believers:\n\n\"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the \nwife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee \nsecretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not \nknown, thou, nor thy fathers; Namely, of the gods of the people which are \nround about you ... *Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; \nneither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt \nthou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first \nupon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. \nAnd thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die.*\"\n\n\"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus \nChrist is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.\"\n\n\"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship \nhath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with \ndarkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he \nthat believeth with an infidel? ... Wherefore come out from among them, and \nbe ye separate, saith the Lord.\"\n\n\"Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is \nthe antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.\"\n\n\"The coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of Satan, who \nuses all power, signs, lying wonders, and every kind of wicked deception \nfor those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so \nbe saved.\"\n\n\nAre you starting to get the idea why your religion is shit, and why your \nlies and apologetics should be ridiculed every fucking time you open your \nmouth and spew them?\n\nOf course the followers of Islam aren't all terrorists. There are lots of \n\"moderate\" followers who only believe in mutilating the genitalia of their \ndaughters, cutting off their clit to prevent them from ever experiencing \nsexual pleasure and then sewing things shut. There are lots of \"moderate\" \nfollowers of Islam who don't crash airplanes into buildings, they just call \nfor the execution of cartoonists or anyone else who renders an imagine of \nMohammy. Plenty of middle-of-the-road Muslims who think wife-beating is one \nof the privileges of marriage, who force their wives and daughters to live \ninside cloth bags, who commit \"honor\" killings because women are only one \nstep higher than cattle according to Islam.\n\nAgain, by the time you get to the \"liberal\" Muslims, all they take from \ntheir idiotic fucking religion is \"Do unto others...\" (which like in the \nbible, was plagiarized from much earlier traditions) \"don't be a dick\" and \n\"have a nice day\". That's all that's left of any religion by the time you \nremove all the patently insane, absurd or repeatedly falsified claims\n\nYou're making luke warm/half assed apologies to try and cover up a few \nlittle zits on the ass of religion while steadfastly ignoring/denying the \nfestering bag of shit that *is* religion. It's foul, and it's the source of \nfar more evil and inaction than it can *ever* offset with positive \ncontributions to human progress.\n\nI can think of nothing in the world that good people wouldn't have done if \nreligion had never been invented, and we can read history books crammed \nfull of the evils that otherwise good people did because of religion.\n\nReligion and morality/ethics are like Enron and accounting/ethics.

This is extremely prejudiced and untrue. For \nexample, Barack Obama, one of the most respected people alive today, is a \nChristian - as is the Queen of england. Mike Tyson and Mahummad Ali were \nboth Muslims. Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt where Buddhists. You can't say \nthat these people have 'fucked up everything they've touched', nor that \nthey are uneducated, nor that they do not own much. Just because many, or \neven most, people of a religion have certain views, this does not mean all \nof that religion do. Take Christianity for example. Many Christians condemn \nall atheists, but the Bible does not teach this, so Christians that pay \nmore attention to the Holy Book of this religion do not condemn atheists, \nthey simply see them as 'misguided.' Also, Islam is a good example. Many \npeople hate Muslims because of some Muslims commiting terrorist acts. \nHowever, the majority of Muslims are against terrorism.",

It's embarrassing when the atheist is \nthe most rabid fanatic in the room.\n\nNevertheless, I'd like to reiterate Leonard Zu\u00f1iga's argument because he \nwas correct and made his points well.\n\nThe concept he was championing but did not name is called Scepticism. The \nlogic is that we should be sceptical of any claim unless it can be \nsupported with evidence. After all, there is an infinite number of possible \nclaims that can be made about the world, and if we were open to them all \nthen we would have no way to sift the true from the false.\n\nScepticism is rational, logical and scientific.\n\nThe claim of the religious is that there is a creator God. That is the \nclaim. And until it can be supported with evidence, then it is rational and \nlogical to be sceptical of it. 'No God' is not a claim we need to support - \nit is the default null hypothesis to the 'God' claim.\n\nMoreover, you stated that Christians never claim to know anything for a \nfact - they just claim to have faith. If that is true in your experience \nthen you obviously don't get on the internet much. :-) Granted, this CAN be \na position Christians can take. But a lot of vocal, public Christians \ndemand that their faith is true and be taken as fact. That is where the \nproblem starts. I don't think I can recall a conversation with a single \nChristian who happily admitted their faith was the evidential equivalent of \na guess.\n\nFinally, let us just take a moment to consider faith. It is belief in \nsomething for which we have no evidence. When put in those terms, it's \nclear to see that this is not a good thing! This is the opposite of \nScepticism. And religion really is one of the last social holdouts which \nchampions faith as a virtue. As such, it is thoroughly unscientific in \nnature.\n\n+Kieren Miriah Happily - with a single question. How did Judas die? \n\nIn Matthew 27, he returns the money to the priests (who used it to buy the \nPotter's Field), and went and hanged himself.\n\nIn Acts, Judas used the money to buy a field but then died when he fell \nfrom such a height that his guts burst out upon landing.\n\nContradictory accounts. Both cannot be true. *At least* one must be wrong. \nErgo, the Bible contains false information.\n\nCase closed, I think.",

Even though it has already been proven countless times by \ncountless scientists of how valuable it can be. You listen to a Priest or \nwhatever he was, I forgot, about a beginning, ever listened to a Sheikh? \nno. The Quran doesn't say anything about 72 virgins in heaven, it says many \nmany many many... many many things about science. Every science.\nFor example, in the Quran, 1400+ years ago, we were told that hell is a \nfire, a fire so hot and merciless that it's dark.\nand now we know from science that fire and heat, when at a high enough \ntemperature, turns black. First fire in red, then when hotter turns white, \nlike our sun. Then when much hotter turns black.\nThe Quran provided us with that information, even though we learned it a \ndifferent way.\n\nAnybody still think we should look somewhere other then The Quran for info \nwe so badly need to know?\nIt's a sad reality we live in, we have a miracle with us, and we still \nignore it.\nIf/When you're aware of this, you're gonna feel something you never \nimagined existed, a sense of regret and sadness that overwhelms you.\n\nI hope you realize that science literally started out from Muslim \nscientists literally following their beliefs, which lead them to science. \nThen EU adopted and translated out books and took it from there.\n\nMath, or more accurately Algebra, was originally from a Muslim scientist, \nAlgebra was taken from an Arab word, which is the scientist's last name (Al \nJaber).\n\nIt's even sadder that Muslim nowadays are too busy fighting and killing \neach other and themselves.\ufeff",

Energy transfer is only no longer possible \nafter the highest state of entropy and equilibrium has been obtained, or \nthe heat death of the universe.  The current energy transfer is increasing \ntotal entropy in the universe, it does not require any additional energy to \noccur.  In short, no energy needs to be added and galaxies, solar systems, \nand life are simply the byproduct of the overall universe increasing in \nentropy.  Your statement that outside energy must continuously be added for \nthese process to occur would counteract the entire concept of entropy and \nbreak our current laws of physics in stating that heat transfer is a \nnon-spontaneous process.\n\nThe only point where you can postulate the need for added energy is the big \nbang, or creation of the universe.   However, as has been previously \nestablished, the big bang is the point where our laws of physics break down \nand no longer apply.  The statement that energy cannot be created or \ndestroyed does not apply to this point in time as it predated our current \nphysical model.\n\nOf course, this entire line of argumentation is pointless as we currently \nbelieve that the universe is not a closed system and there is no reason to \nassume that it is.",

Energy transfer from anything in the Universe is energy \nconservation, and entropic, which is exactly why the lecture I mentioned \nended on that unanswered question.  For any of the theories to work, \noutside energy not part of the universe must be used.  It was why the \nelaborate lecture fell apart on that point.\n\nOne example he used was similar to your galaxy analogy, allowing for energy \ntransfer from one area to another to explain breakdowns in entropy.  But \nthe same problem still existed, outside energy needed to be added, and as \nlong as the system was gaining energy and thus breaking the laws of \nthermodynamics (2 at least by my count), it worked.  The inherent problem \nwas where the finite or infinite Universe was getting the extra energy. \n His point became moot when early on even he admitted early on that energy \ntransfer couldn't overcome entropy on a large or small scale, as that would \ninvalidate thermodynamics to say, \"It's a law, just not as this moment, but \nin a few minutes it will be again.  You can't play willy-nilly with laws to \nsuit your purposes,\"   Which is the inherent problem with the added energy, \nlocalization is simply trying to say the laws of thermodynamics breakdown \nwith scale or location.",

You also have not clarified why the closed universe assumption \nmakes sense and is reasonable.\n\nThe expansion of the universe is vary clear indicator that our universe is \nNOT a closed system as some undefined physical force (currently named dark \nenergy) is putting energy into our universe that counteracts the \ngravitational force of our galaxies.  This could be the case if the \nuniverse is finite or infinite.  Many modern theories of quantum physics, \nincluding string theory, also indicate that the universe (and indeed, all \nuniverses) is an open system.\n\nIf anything, the point of the question is that it is very unlikely that we \nlive in a closed universe, although not quite impossible.\n\nAll that aside, your question is quite easy to answer which is why I find \nyour statement somewhat doubtful.  While the over all entropy of a closed \nsystem will always increase, this is not always true for different parts of \nthat system.  In fact, energy transfer from a place of more concentrated \nenergy to places of lower concentrated energy is one of the ways that \nhigher states of entropy are achieved.\n\nTake for example our galaxy, which is a closed system by our current \ndefinition.  Despite increasing overall in entropy, there is quite a clear \ntransfer of energy from stars to planets as they radiate heat from nuclear \nfission.  This means that despite the Galaxy (and for the most part the \nsolar system) being a closed system, and steadily increasing in entropy, \nthere is still a clear energy transfer from stars to planets.  It is this \nenergy transfer that is largely responsible for life on earth.  Thus, even \nif the universe was a closed universe (either infinite or finite) there \nstill easily exist the energy transfer to bring about life.\n\nAfter the heat death of universe (an estimated 10^100 years from now) and \nmaximum entropy has been produced, THEN the statement you are making will \nbe true.  However, until then energy transfer can and does happen on a \nregular basis allowing for the creation of galaxies, solar systems, \nplanets, and indeed life.",

That the sun always rises at the same \npoint. That the stars fall from the sky into the ocean. All those sorts of \nunambiguous observations it makes.\n\nAnd before you claim the idiocy about \"it predicted quarks\" or \"salt water \nand fresh water really don't mix\" see my usual blithering rant about Newton \nand Einstein vs. every religious book ever written:  No one has to \ninterpret them correctly in order to kinda/sorta see what they might have \nmeant. Their words stand on their own, extremely clear, extremely concise. \nAnyone can read their books/papers and come away with the same \nunderstanding. Between them they made more claims and predictions about the \nnatural world than every magic book combined, yet no interpretation is \nneeded to \"adjust\" their claims to match empirical evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, every religious book on the planet needs some \nself-aggrandizing fuckheads in magic hats and magic robes to \"interpret\" \nwhat the gods really meant when they wrote their magical books, and pretty \nmuch none of the morons in hats agree completely with each other on any \nclaim from the magic books, trivial or significant.\n\nSo if your magic book was written by incompetent fucking idiot gods who \ncouldn't express themselves clearly enough for you to simply cite a \nsentence or a paragraph that stands alone and is unambiguous in its claim, \nknock yourself out.\n\nI'm betting all the beer in my pantry that your gods are incompetent \nfucking idiots who were unable to write a single clear and unambiguous \nclaim that does not involve a penis (or parts thereof), sex, misogyny, \nmurder, genocide, or a magic number.\n\nMost of a case of Traquair house ale in the pantry, along with some Negra \nModelo, Dos Equis, Guiness and Alaskan amber.

In the video he \noffered that right now we are able to see back further in time because \nthere is something new to see. Previously there was no way to see gravity \nwaves.  We still can't beut we can see the effect that is caused by them \n(rearrangement of the path/alignment of light).  If the evidence holds \ntrue, we should be able to \"see\" back further in time.  The question is \nwill there be a beginning where everything came to a static single point or \nwill it show that it was a unique state of the universe.  Think like you \nare focusing a light from a magnifying glass. you can focus the light of \nthe sun to a very fine spot.  If you move the magnifying glass closer or \nfurther away, the size (and intensity) of the light spot will change.  The \nspot will become cooler and larger.  That is kind of what may have \nhappened.  That is something that we hope to discover over time. In this \ncase, there was never a previous universe, it was just in a different state.\n\nIf you are asking based on a religious point of view, I will defer you to \nthe message given to Abraham in regard to God (most monotheist [Believers \nin a One God] believe in the God of Abraham which makes up the three \nlargest religions on the earth and covers the largest part of religious \nbelievers). God told Abraham not to have graven images to worship because \nhe could not be contained.  He is in everything and is Everything. In other \nwords, everything is made up from \"God\".  The universe is technically \n\"God\", we are just examining and trying to better understand it from a \nnon-emotional viewpoint, just documenting.\n\nTrue science doesn't care if there is a God or not, and doesn't try to \nprove or dis-prove God. Through out history, people in control tried to \nimpose how to understand things. A classic example is the Bible said the \nsun and moon revolved around the earth.  Galileo said that the earth \nrevolved around the sun.  He was locked up by the authority at the time (it \nchallenged their authority). Science figures used this to take control \nbecause they were enlightened and it proved no God.  Then Einstein came \nalong and with relativity showed that you could express it either way \nmaking both parties correct and incorrect, and basically that the Bible was \nnot wrong, people interpret it incorrectly.  Lets face it, parts of it were \nwritten long before complex math and science existed and so if it was \ndivine, it had to be worded such that it is simple to understand and is \ntechnically not incorrect. \n\nUltimately, it is up to you what you wish to believe, which is what the \ndivine message is all about, if you believe in that.  :).",

Although he \ndoes make valid arguments, his points are backed up by evidence, and I \nagree with his scientific statements, I cannot help but notice his \naggressive and demeaning manor.\n\nI'm all for open and honest debate, but the way he presents his arguments \nand the way he responds to others was just too much for me. I got a little \nsmile on my face, giggled, and just couldn't help myself. Thus the \"troll \nmuch.\"\n\nPlease forgive me, it is not directed to anyone else than him. And I agree \nwith you, Andrew, there is much ignorance and hatred on both side of the \nargument which could be cured by a reasoned discussion.

Religious \npeople feel they don't have to do the best they can, because \"the gods will \nmake it all okay in the end\" The gods aren't going to make it okay, they \nnever have, they never will... and the closer to out-of-resources we get, \nthe more critical doing our best becomes.\n\nThousands of years of the best that religion can do got us to inquisitions \nand witch burnings.

As for all the stuff \nyou're saying now, i wont bother giving you any kind of response not \nbecause I don't have the wherewithal to do so, but solely because the way \nin which you speak about things that other people might find to be of value \nin their lives.

The response you gave me was nothing but a stubborn \naddition to the rantings you've already put out against others and their \nbeliefs. Why not address what I said about your character??? or do you \nreally not give a damn that you are portraying yourself in a manner that \nany compassionate-minded individual would find disgusting? I bet you're \nstill probably only thinking of your next comeback on a topic im not even \nreally trying to discuss with you at the moment. So ill put it plain and \nsimple for you. It doesn't matter if you know the secret to the fucking \nuniverse, nobody is going to give a damn so long as you continue to talk to \nothers the way you do. Nobody wants to side with a person who has no \nrespect for others, whether they claim a religion or not. And THAT is \nsomething i am positive can be proven easily. If you can allow yourself to \nunderstand that at least, then I am sure myself and many others would be \nhappy to focus on the topic at hand and engage you in a proper discussion. \nAs of now though, your nasty character is a bit of a distraction from \nhaving any kind of adult conversation with you. I mean, if you cant even \nallow yourself to possess any kind of self-awareness, how in the hell can \nyou expect us to take you seriously in regards to your awareness as it \nrelates to other matters? If you're not even aware of yourself, who knows \nwhat the hell else you might not be aware of??? There is no amount of \nevidence in the universe that anyone can give you to convince you to step \naway from your own ignorance when it comes to the way you view the lives of \ncountless individuals who are nothing like the horrible people you go on \ndescribing. You're the only one that can give yourself self-awareness. And \nIf you are just too stubborn to do that, then in a way you've made science \nyour own religion.",

The first written documents were related to commerce anyway, not \nrelated to gods.\nMy wife's grandmother was never taught to read or write. She could \nliterally count only until 3-5. She did not know the names of the rest of \nthe numbers. She went shopping using money though. When prices were quite \nstable, she learned that she need one green with blue, small bill, to buy a \nloaf of bread, and get 3 large coins back, for example.\n\nPeople were involved in trading for longer than they even had a word for \nthat occupation. When trading, people always come up with ways to score \nmore profit somehow. Customers will want to borrow, sellers will want a \ngreater commerce volume. The first written information was probably some \nsort of note of either credit or ownership, where very simply drawn \ninformation would describe the object and subject of a transaction.\n\nEarly writing is actually full of commercial notes. Only when it has \nevolved enough to express more meaning, was it used for purposes like laws \n(Code of Hammurabi for example), and only much later afterwards was it used \nto transfer folklore onto documents, which became written myths, legends, \ngospels.\n\nReligion was late in adopting any cultural breakthrough throughout the \nentire human history. It is a retardant for cultural evolution.\n\n\"The first being a bland, routine place where you are curious, but \nuninspired.\" - people were inspired by everything around them. What do you \nthink is more inspiring? A retarded tale about a freak turning women into \nsalt piles, or the sight of a supernova, solar eclipse, moon eclipse, and \nother phenomena that people were curious as hell about.\n\nIf religion was the more powerful engine behind cultural evolution, then we \nwouldn't have witnessed a scientific society that's mostly atheist, at best \ndeist, that made more breakthroughs in the last 100 years than humanity did \nin its entire existence.\nThat's because it's NOT religion. It's curiosity, bound by freedom of \ninformation, freedom of expression, unhindered by stupid laws enforced by \nreligious organizations, and uninspired criticism from total morons who are \nstuck in their ways and old ideas, but have political power from religion.",

                    "text": "+Christfreak\nI might be able to shed a little more light into this topic. Just an FYI if \nyou do not know, radiation and light can be used almost interchangeably, as \nI will be doing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'm an engineering student, so I have no expertise in the field \nof cosmology. I just really enjoy learning about the big bang theory and I \nabsorb and keep all information I can find. Take this with a grain of salt.\n\nThere is this thing out there called the cosmic background radiation. \nEssentially what this is light that is radiating at us, from every single \npossible direction. No matter where you look in the sky, if you search for \nthe right frequency, it is there. This radiation has been calculated to \nhave originated some 400 000 years after the big bang happened, or just \nover 13 billion years ago. This blanket of radiation is the absolute \nfurthest that any observation can go, it completely blocks our view, \nexplanation to follow.\n\nNow this radiation is at a intensity and frequency that suggests that all \nthat time ago, the universe was incredibly hot. So hot that the radiation \nwhich the particles emitted could tear atomic nuclei apart. Essentially, \nparticles back then were all too hot to form atoms, so before then there \nwere no elements whatsoever. The universe consisted of a plasma or soup of \nsuper-energetic electrons, protons, etc. all flying around, more or less \nindependently.\n\nA key thing about this theory, is that as the universe expands, the \nwavelength of light gets stretched as the space it is occupying is also \nstretched. According to Plank's Law, this means that all the emitted \nradiation diminished in intensity over its travel time to reach some place \nin the universe (this is actually how the radiation was dated). The more \nspace which was created, the longer the wavelength would be stretched. It \nwas only after this critical point in history when the expanding of the \nuniverse caused the particles to lose enough energy such that the radiation \nwould no longer rip the nuclei apart; atoms could form. These atoms were \nmostly hydrogen, a bit of helium and even less of lithium. All other \nelements would then be created in stars which were now physically allowed \nto form.\n\nI said earlier that this is as far back as we can see. The reason for this \nis that back then, every single particle was emitting light, more or less. \nAll this radiation was obscuring anything which might have existed; \neverything before then is being enshrouded by the incredible amounts of \nradiation. It's after the 400 000 year mark where the universe essentially \ncleared of this fog, letting us see.\n\nThe reason that we can still see this background radiation is that as the \nuniverse is expanding, the speed of light remains constant throughout. \nImagine a RC car driving at a constant speed on a treadmill which starts at \na high speed but then slows down. Initially, the net effect of the car is \nfor it to go backwards from a stationary viewpoint, as the treadmill is \nfaster. Eventually, once the treadmill is slower than the car, then the car \ncan then begin to move forward. Once this stage has been reached, it's just \na matter of time before the car drives off the end of the treadmill. This \nis exactly what is happening in the universe, though the speed of the \ntreadmill is analogous to an expansion of space.\n\nSpace is being created between us and the particle which emitted the \nradiation. So even though our position in the universe and the particle may \nhave been quite close, space was created in between us at a far greater \nspeed than light can travel. It was only after the expansion slowed to \nbelow light speed that the radiation could make any sort of progress on its \njourney to our viewpoint, at which point it was so distant (and remember \nthe expansion is ongoing) that the light took 13 billion years to reach us.\n\nSo at this point some 13 billion years ago, the particles which emitted the \nbackground radiation were already some distance from us. As the light that \nthey emitted traveled in our direction, the space was stretched, letting us \nonly see the radiation now, at a far lower frequency (and hence energy) \nthan when it was created due to the wavelength stretching. Currently it is \nresiding in the microwave range, around 160GHz (as a reference, visible \nlight is between 400 and 800THz, much larger and more energetic than the \nbackground radiation).\n\nI think I might have overkilled this a little bit, I just get really \nenthusiastic when I explain this theory, whether or not they asked for an \nexplanation :P",

A tree for example is still and always be a mystery, no one \nknows what a tree is, you can say what kinds of patterns it shows, you can \neven say well it is made out of \"wood\" but wood is just a word based on a \nconcept we use, its a representation of our experience or a copy of it from \nour limited senses, it is not the actual thing itself, which is unknowable \nbecause it is beyond words or concepts, it just simply is what it is and we \ncant claim to know, you have to be careful that you are not using science \nas a religion either, religion is fundamentally based on a very sound piece \nof information or pattern which is the oneness of the universe how all \nthings are linked and how we are all parts of the same whole, but that's \njust the core, the rest of it is a story on top of that, which to believe \nin as the truth is naive, there is a God in a way which deep down we all \nknow to be true, we are born seeing everything as one big happening, \nbecause it is, our language and definitions create the illusions of \nseparability, this \"God\" I speak of, it is a pattern itself, it's not a \nmagical man or even a deity who wishes to punish and reward, its nothing \nseparate it just is what we are, all is just a pattern and that's all we \ncan really know for sure like I said before, this pattern doesn't need to \nbe defined, we as humans are the ones who wish to define and then call \nthose definitions the truth, unaware somehow that our definitions are just \nmental constructs, they are not real, they are representations. Religion \ndoes in fact hold a lot of truth, but to be a religious follower is a con. \nGod and religion are two different things, the concept of God itself (Not \nan entity, that is religion, a common mistake people make) is not due to \n\"not knowing\" or \"illogical thinking\" its actually the most logical, and I \nthink religion has destroyed this sense of oneness which if you want to \nknow of it just think about it, think about life and the universe, dont \njust rely on Religion or even Science to do the thinking for you, think for \nyourself, follow reason and logic, of course use science, its a great tool, \neven religious scripture can show you things in a way that you may not of \nthought of before, just dont just be a follower or a simple believer, be a \nthinker because there are not many in the world, and we need them.\n\nIt's also important to note that religion is made up of ancient scriptures, \nthe ancient scriptures came before the religion, as the books are compiled \nof fragments of these texts, there are many scriptures out there related to \ncertain cultures but not in those culture's religions, if they were they \nwouldn't be left out, there's no evidence what so ever that religion today \nis what it was back in their origins, its much more likely that religion \nwas never supposed to be taken literally, just look at how language has \nchanged, hieroglyphics for instance were basically metaphors, not that long \nago in history metaphores were used so much in every day language, a lot of \nold text's are \"poetic\" in nature, religion is but a control tool, and the \nbest lies contain some truth, its the best way to decieve, it doesn't make \nthe scriptures garbage, that is a great dishonor to our past, these are \nbeautiful story's that do contain a lot of wisdom, unless you take them \nliterally of course.",

The \"infinite\" series, \n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16...= 1, not one minus epsilon. From zero to 1 second \nis not infinite, it's 1 full second, i.e. finite. \nJoseph Rodgers is quite correct. If the universe were infinitely old, then \ninfinitely long ago plus a positive one trillion years would still be \ninfinitely long ago. The present would never occur, much less the future. \nWhat's the answer to this \"paradox\"? It's that time and infinity are \ndiametric opposites. Time MUST be finite because it progresses, if you \nwill, one unit at a time in a very real sense, and infinity does not. That \nis, infinity + 8 million = infinity, not infinity and 8million. Infinity is \nnot a number, so it doesn't behave like a number. It is an unreal concept, \nlike ratios. Pi \"goes on forever\", but there is no existential pi, Pi is a \nratio, not an actual length. The diameter of a circle is finite. The \ncircumference of that same circle is finite, but the ratio is infinite and \na transcendental number to boot, but the ratio is merely an unreal concept, \nan idea that does not exist in reality. *There are no existential \ninfinities.* This is because everything that exists has duration, i.e. \noccurs in time, and time is finite by it's very nature.

The idea of random fluctuations in empty \nspace-time producing something physical isn't just conceptual, it's a fact. \nWe know it really happens.\n\nLikewise if a universe can also spontaneously appear from Nothing, there is \nno rational reason to believe or pretend that some supernatural was at \nwork. Based on overwhelming evidence throughout all of human experience, \nthe only rational explanation/expectation is that it is a purely natural \nprocess that we simply haven't identified yet.\n\nAs for the fine tuning argument, I think it's basically just primitive \nnumerology. \"Oh well if gravity wasn't this value and Planck's constant \nwasn't that particular value then...\"  There is no evidence that they are \nin any way related, nor is there any evidence that there are no limits on \nthe values they can take.\n\nAgain, there are trillions upon trillions of virtual particles \nspontaneously appearing in what,until recently,  everyone would call \ncompletely empty space.\n\nThere isn't any reason to believe that universes couldn't behave in a \nsimilar fashion. Consider Hawking radiation, where a virtual particle pair \npopping into existence close to the event horizon of a black hole can \nresult in one virtual particle becoming a real particle, and the other \nbeing lost beyond the event horizon. Of all the uncountable number of \nvirtual particles that have popped into existence, only those particular \nparticles become real. Why? Random chance. They just happened to appear \nnear the event horizon. There was nothing supernatural involved.\n\nSo why would anyone assume the supernatural was involved if an uncountable \nnumber of causally disconnected universes are popping into existence all \nthe time and some just happen to randomly encounter the right conditions so \nthat they don't collapse before they develop structure, and some of those \nlast long enough that life gets started?\n\nYou're trying to inject the supernatural even though *every* single claim \nof supernatural agency ever made in the past has turned out to be not just \nwrong, but completely fucking ridiculous. The gods do not create fire, but \npeople who were ignorant of chemistry insisted that must be the case. The \ngods do not make earthquakes, but people who were ignorant of geophysics \ninsisted that must be the case. Lightning, thunder, volcanoes, life, \ntsunamis, hurricanes, plagues, disease - every single complex natural \nprocess/event ever attributed to the supernatural has turned out to have a \ncompletely ordinary natural cause.\n\nOnce we establish the truth about the origin of this universe has a \nperfectly natural origin, then the people making the gods of the gaps \nargument and the fine tuning argument will then switch to \"well where does \neternal inflation come from? *That* must be supernatural!\"\n\nIt is childish to continue a 10,000+ year old streak of primitive ignorance \nand insist that *next* time the supernatural explanation will turn out to \nbe right.",

When you start claiming that \nyour faith has evidence and that it represents physical reality then you \ngive up your right to cry about your claims and evidence being challenged \nand your \"logic\" being derided when it's so obviously faulty that only the \nblinders of faith could make it seem otherwise.",

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2 Yes, you (as everyone else) should respect all people no \nmatter what they believe, as beliefs are not actions and behavior. People \ndecide what to do with their faith. \nIn Hebrew there is a saying \"Proper behavior precedes the Torah\" - acting \nas a human being and respecting other is before anything else you learn.\n\nOne can find contradictions on any false claim and belief , and by doing so \nto disproof it. \nScience is divided to sections, and some of them are based on statistics \nand probability (and some are called \"Empirical\" so that people can examine \nthem and call things true or false in 100% certainty, like math) . Such \nsections are actually beliefs too, and this includes History, Archeology \nand even what seems to be what you believe in (Evolution of everything in \nall scales, including of your ancestors). As such, not everything in \nscience can be measured or have proofs to. One can't even measure the \nchances to some of what is decided to be true. All is left is believing in \nsuch things till someone finds otherwise.\nOn so many fields of science (even Physics), even when there are no \nevidences or solid proofs, theories arise and people start believing in \nthem till proved otherwise. Theories come and go. Not all fields of science \nare accurate. All is bound to our senses, tools and understanding.\nGeneralizing all fields in science as 100% true or 100% observable is \nwrong. \nAlso, just like in any field in science, if someone finds any hole in a \ntheory that one believe in, he must ask himself if it's real or not, \ncontinue investigating current theory for possible explanations or ditch it \nfor much better theories. In fact, the bigger the hole, the larger the \nchance the theory is false ( \"Evolution of everything\" has lots of holes \nand contradictions, for example, and needs stronger and stronger belief in \norder to still exist, but that's the only theory out there currently for \norigins of life as we know it).\nRuining something is usually much easier than building it.\n\nIf anyone know the \"Matrix\" movie, you can get interesting questions from \nit. I can't prove anything is real. I can't even prove the world existed a \nsecond ago - it could be that the universe just started in this state a \nsecond ago, with all of the people having a snapshot of memory from it. \nWhat I can say is that I believe it was existing before, because all \nevidences show it.\nWhen someone is judged in court, no matter how much science is involved, no \nmatter how many evidences there are, there is always the chance of being \nwrong in the verdict.\n\nScience is the research of what exists in this universe, the searching of \ntruth and knowledge. Science cannot answer everything. Science cannot \nanswer why (and I'm not saying \"how\" or \"when\") the universe even exists \nand why it has laws that can be researched and aren't random (because the \nuniverse could run in any set of rules one can think of). Science can only \nanswer to other questions, but not to those.\nWhy can there be physics and chemistry? I could think of any set of rules \n(even random ones) instead of all that is currently known.\nWhy is there even a universe? Why is there even an existence of anything?  \n\"Nothing\" could easily be a nice alternative of a universe. In such a \nuniverse, there could be 0 atoms, 0 energy, 0 of everything that can be \nmeasured.\nIf there is a multiverse (infinite number of universes), why does it exist \nthen? I could easily think of the non-existence of all multiverses...\n\nIf nothing \"needs\" to exist and nothing has a purpose, then life has no \npurpose too. End of life mean nothing as nothing goes after it to look for. \nThere is no meaning to what anyone does in life since you will forget \neverything. This means everything is a lie, as Kohelet (king Solomon) said: \nbecoming rich, having fun ,pleasure and memories, having a family, succeed \nin life in any way, everything you ever wished to have,... no a thing means \nanything anymore, since you die in the end and you get nothing after that. \nEven as you get older, you forget more and more things, as everything you \nhad and experienced in life is gone and never to exist anymore.\n\nIn order to bypass the limitations of science, one need to have those \nquestions and only then continue. \nIn general, if you wish to find the truth beyond what can be measured or \nproved by tests, you cannot limit yourself to your senses (and you have \nalready written it actually) and the empirical science.\n\nI think that the older a person is, the more fixated he is in his believes. \nAs I've written, I don't care what others believe in, as long as they do \nnot offend others (and me) in any way. I can of course make conversations. \nI prefer not to make conversations with people who do not know how to \nrespect others.\n\nI'm very sorry if I ever offended anyone who read what I've written, but I \ndon't think I deserve how you treated me. I was deeply offended though, and \nI hope you don't do it to any other stranger you meet outside, or people \nyou care of.\n\nI wish you best.",

I see the \nuniverse as the only reality that you can experience while living, and the \nonly one that you can't when you are dead. Since I'm not dead yet I can't \nsay what is the reality then, so God is more than the universe and space \nand time, as it created all of them and isn't bound to them.\nTime is quite an artificial thing, but for all humans, time has started \nwhen the universe started its existence . \n\nHowever, if you define the universe as the group of everything that exists, \nyou might be able to put god as an entity into this group, but as the one \nthat created all the rest.\n\nIt is quite a philosophical thing (and depends on your definitions) , so I \ncan't argue much about it.

                    "text": "You've missed the definition of god. God is an entity , not a creature. \nGod isn't a physical thing as it's not an entity that was created in the \nuniverse, it created the universe.\nWhen you ask what made X, you mean that something was superior (or before) \nto X in order to make it, so X cannot be god since something else has \ncreated it.\nIf god was in the same level as the rules you are living in , it means it's \nbound to them. Since he made the rules, it doesn't mean it is bound to them.\nIf I make a game, with a specific set rules, does it make me a part of the \ngame, and do I have to follow the rules even before the game was started?\n\nThe idea of putting god into a physical set of rules isn't a new one. It's \nactually started from the logic of creating gods, by making sculptures. \nWhen people worship something they've just created, this is a paradox as \nwhat they've created couldn't have created them...\n\nAnother example of an eternal entity is an idea. More specifically, Math. \nMath is full of ideas and rules that aren't bound to any rule in the \nuniverse. They were always there and will always exists, even if there is \nno universe. Math is absolute and contains only one single truth. Any \n\"paradox\" you see in math, you'd probably believe someone is messing with \nyou.\n\nAlso, you speak of time, but it seems that time had a beginning and nothing \nelse was before, so this is the reality as we know it.\nAnd even though this video suggests there could be something before the \n\"big bang\" , most scientists (including the most known one -  Stephen \nHawking) believe it isn't so, and that time and the entire universe really \nhad a beginning.\n\nIn any case, I think one of the arguments of how come god exists, is that \nreality has rules, and quite strict ones. I could easily think of an \nalternative universe where there are no rules where gravity changes \nrandomly every 1 hour, or nothing is actually existing. Why do we have a \nuniverse at all? Why do we have rules in it?\nThe reason we have science is that there are rules in our universe, and \nthere are people willing to discover them and help mankind.\nI think science is here to answer the questions of how, and not why. \n\nEven though I'm not a christian (because god having a son that cancels its \nown laws even though one of them is that all are sealed and cannot be \nchanged is just against my logic) , I like the debates of creationalists vs \nevolution. more specifically this rather old one:\nwatch?v=UKyyaURZW-o\nThey show there some interesting ideas of both sides. \n\nNo matter what you choose to believe in, I think its the actions you make \nthat truly matter and is the right religion in my belief. \nWhen you do choose to believe in something, I think it's best to check it \nfrom all directions, and if there is a single contradiction (especially \nwithin itself), it means it's flawed and must be explained, otherwise it's \nincorrect to believe in.",

We know with absolute certainty that the supernatural being \nconjured our universe from nothing. We know with absolute certainty that \nthis invisible supernatural being interacts with the natural world, and we \nknow with absolute certainty why it undertakes specific interactions within \nthe natural world (plane crashes, earthquakes, cancer and pictures on \ntoast) even though we have never been able to say in advance if, when, or \nin what manner it will next interact with the natural world. Oh yeah, and \nregardless of which theory of origin that science determines is the correct \none, we know with absolute certainty that the 1) the supernatural being did \nit, 2) why the supernatural being did it 3) the supernatural being's magic \nbook already contains a description of whichever theory it is.\n\nOops, almost forgot one more thing: We know absolutely that our \nsupernatural being is far more concerned about what sort of genitals that \nmarried partners possess than it is about children starving or dying of \nAIDS in Africa, therefore we ignore our supernatural beings direct orders \nto care for the sick, feed the hungry and give shelter to the poor, and \ninstead we spend our time and effort trolling youtube, banning gay marriage \nand other abominations clearly described in the supernatural being's magic \nbook like pornography, condoms, cloning, stem cell research, the internet, \nsaying words like \"fuck\" and \"cunt\", and the wearing of clothing that isn't \npure cotton. Or eating shellfish. Or eating fish on Friday. Or going to \nworship it on Saturday.\n\nNo wait, make that worship on Friday. INFIDELS! You know the holy day is \nSunday!

The reason I am still discussing with \nyou is because you are clearly only commenting on this video to stir up \ntrouble, as you have commented multiple times; and each time, you claim \nthat opinions are being forced upon you, yet everyone is only being \ndefensive against your derogatory comments against them.

Every single argument you have brought to me has had a \nlogical fallacy so far, and every question you have brought to me has \nassumed that I am arguing a religious standpoint.

The very foundation of the point I am making is that there is \nno way at the given time to prove the supernatural false or true, and \ntherefore we cannot assume either.

                    "text": "+ExperienceCounts2 It's about time you brought out the core of your beliefs \nso that we can observe the fallacies in it.  The fallacy in your beliefs \nhas to do with philosophy, not science.\n\nFirst off, you claim that every single supernatural explanation turned out \nto be false in all of history, this is a small part of the fallacy in your \nargument, because only many of the supernatural occurrences have proven to \nbe false.  There are still some that are unaccounted for that (maybe) we'll \nfind evidence to disprove, but until then we cannot dismiss it, as \ngenerally their evidence for it is the fact that it cannot be explained.\n\nNext, I'll try to use more descriptive words so you understand the fallacy \nin your \"easter bunny\" argument.  The easter bunny is proved false because \nthe conditions required for that case are false (the entire easter bunny is \na tradition that would discontinue with tradition, however in the case of a \ngod, the god would live regardless of people's belief in it, continuing to \nexist in it's initial conditions, unless the initial conditions were proved \nfalse)  Also keep in mind that religious texts are not scientific papers; \nthey will not go into detail about the scientific process of how their god \ncreated the universe or any other act, but only that they did it.  And as \nfar as I have seen, initial conditions for a god do not include people \nexperiencing the supernatural.\n\nAnd now for a core fallacy: the assumption that because most cases have \nbeen proven false, that all cases must then be false.  In statistics, this \nis called extrapolation, and has the potential to (meaning to or not) \nmisrepresent data.  This is also true with things that are well developed, \nsuch as the laws of physics, or any science for that matter; for example, \nwe have not observed gravity act upon EVERY object according to the way we \ndescribe through laws, therefore our scientific laws cannot be proven \nabsolutely correct: even though we have absolutely no evidence of a \nmacro-object that does not obey the laws of physics does not mean it does \nnot exist--and the same can be said about a deity. Science also isn't as \nexact as we would like it to be, we learn new things about everything the \nmore we look into it (some examples are the change in structure in atoms, \nthe beginning of the universe (or lack thereof), the center of the \nuniverse, evolution, or electricity, where we still have a lot to learn. \n Your argument also assumes that everything we know today is correct, and \nthis is false (and that is shown through advances in technology and changes \nin theories, as well as some things that are observed that contradict or \ncannot be explained by our current understanding.  This is also very key to \nproving whether or not a deity can exist, if we only had the information we \nhave today, we would never prove it one way or the other).\n\nI hope this has cleared things up for you.  I'm sure there are some things \nI've missed as well, but they can be addressed later if needed.\n\nP.S.\nJust because it can't be proven that a deity cannot exist doesn't mean \nthere has to be one (which is another fallacy), it just means that a deity \nexisting does not contradict with science or logic.  Along with that, that \ndoesn't mean that every religious quack is correct just because of the \npossibility of a deity.",

                    "text": "+MLP Fede Maybe you can answer a question that he refuses to: Can we not \ndiscard the Easter Bunny theory of the origin of the cosmos because it's \nillogical?\n\nThe point is that once you accept that supernatural explanations might turn \nout to be real, then you must answer the next logical question: which \nsupernatural explanations are real?\n\nSince there is no definition of/structure/logic to the supernatural world \nthen you cannot possibly distinguish between \"more supernatural\" and \"less \nsupernatural\" or \"correct supernatural\" and \"incorrect supernatural\" or \n\"slightly bluish green supernatural\" and \"orangey-pink supernatural\". If \nyou accept that one supernatural cause might be real, you have to accept \nthat *any* supernatural cause might be real.\n\nTo me that's the core idiocy of supernatural beliefs. It's beyond \nintellectually lazy, it's the intellectually comatose going on vacation to \nrelax, laying on the floor and washing down a fistful of tranquilizers with \nbottle of tequila.\n\nThe defense of supernatural claims is just human vanity/arrogance parading \naround as \"oh my definition of supernatural is so much better than those \nother definitions of supernatural that mine could be real while all those \nothers are just silly\". It's just religion in an alternate uniform \"oh, all \nthose other gods are just silly but *my* gods are *real*\"\n\nThe Easter Bunny theory of the origin of the cosmos is equivalent to any \nother supernatural theory about the origin of the cosmos, which includes \nall creation myths from all religions, and every batshit crazy claim ever \nmade by inmates in  insane asylums.\n\nThe other point is that every supernatural explanation ever made has turned \nout to be false. All of them. Not a single one turned out to be true, in \nall of human history. So it's perfectly reasonable to ask how many \nthousands/millions of supernatural explanations have to fail before it can \nbe considered \"safe\" to dismiss all supernatural explanations out of hand?\n\nIf we witness a billion supernatural explanations for something all \nfailing, do rational adults still have to hold the door open for the \nsupernatural claims, just in case the 1,000,000,001st one is right? Ten \nbillion? A trillion? Where do we draw the line?\n\nThe trillionth time, when we entertain the Gargantuan Four Dimensional \nChameleon theory of the universe wherein a ten trillion light year long \nchameleon (whose sacred name is Englebert) found it neccessary to take on \nthe exact size, shape and color of our universe in order to camouflage \nhimself from the Evil Wizard known as Tim... if that explanation turns out \nto be false too, do we *really* have to keep an \"open mind\" that the ones \nabout the magic gods of Iron age nomads conjuring the universe from \nnothing, or the indifferent, coalition of unnamed deities who simply group \nfarted the universe into existence and walked away?\n\nThe people who call for rational people to \"keep an open mind\" are \ninvariably the ones who are completely unable to answer the next logical \nquestion \"about what?\" The reply from the superstitious is invariably some \nvariant of \"well... for anything really\".\n\nI say fuck it, \"anything\" has worn out its welcome as causation for \neverything we're uncertain about. It can go get stuffed, and anyone who \nseriously proposes \"anything\" as a possible origin of the universe is a \nmoron, first class, with honors, and probably also wears a diaper.\n\nAs Feynman said, maybe we never get to the center of the onion, maybe it's \njust more and more layers no matter how far down we dig. I think that the \nonly rational thing is to say \"we don't yet know what this natural process \nis\" Seriously proposing that \"maybe *THIS* time it's magic!\" is as \nirrational and idiotic as proposing \"maybe *THIS* time I'll throw myself at \nthe floor and fall up to the ceiling because gravity won't see me\"",

It's hard to \ndetermine whether anything from the gospels actually happened, and by \nlooking at their content, the conclusion is that we shouldn't trust it. It \ncan be used as some sort of insight, like the way you would look at the \ntantrums thrown by a mentally insane person when you're trying to determine \nwhat that person witnessed.\n\nAs a source of morals, it is the worst possible place. Everywhere, where \npeople are ruled by religion, the moral values are on the ground. And why \nshouldn't they be? The bible for example tells people to kill, rape, have \nsex with own daughters, kill again, kill children, burn people, etc.\n\n\"Thus it and science can coexist. \" - only if there is a very thick wall of \nignorance between them. A realm of \"I'm not touching this subject\", a mode \nwhere you can disconnect your brain when it comes to religion. My wife has \nbeen like this. A devout fanatical christian, yet she loves science. Every \ntime I told her that something about her religion was contradicting \nscience, she didn't want to listen, she got angry. But she loved talking \nabout science. Until it got to religion. I wasn't trying to flush religion \nout of her. I even went with her to church when she wanted to. But in the \nend, with all the science I inundated her with, she began to really doubt \nwhether christianity has any credibility. Only after she really understood \nwhat evolution by natural selection is (she didn't know exactly), only \nafter she understood the classical laws of motion, and saw simulations made \nby me and not only me, did she understand that most of what she learned \nfrom religion was in contradiction with science.\nThen she picked up the bible. She was told by the priest that she can't \njust read it. That the reading must be preceded by long sessions of \nprayers, talking with priests, so they would tell you how to interpret it. \nBut she didn't do any of that. She knew that she wanted to see what's \nactually there, not what priests want her to see. So she took it, read the \nfirst page, and shut it closed in horror, then burst out laughing. It was \nthe stupidest thing she has ever read. She then continued to read, \nannotating it. That book was full with sticky notes on every page, with \nannotations from her.\nBut she didn't go past Genesis. It was beyond stupid and horrible. Stupid \nas in - written by a retard. Horrible as in - that retard was also a \nmerciless savage mass murderer and rapist - a sociopath, a maniac. As a \nimpressionable woman, she once even had a nightmare once after reading the \nmore explicit depictions of mass murder.\n\nAnd she thought that other religions can't be that bad. I showed her parts \nof the Qur'an. Chilling. Then she read greek mythology. They're all the \nsame.\n\nWhoever worships these texts today either never read them, or are too sick \nto be treated as humans any more.",

                    "text": "+Donnie not at all. Because the who created a creator idea assumes time and \nwe believe time is actually something man thinks is linear and that God is \noutside of man made time and space. The human mind, even using math and \nobservation, cannot think beyond a certain dimension. It is just not \npossible. So people dismiss it because they think of God as an entity that \nexists, and existence to us has space and time but we find it hard to think \noutside of that frame of reference. And even if the how of science explains \nthe laws we observe that create movement of inanimate forms and life of \nanimate forms, we are still not able to perceive beyond what we can observe \nor hypothesize, and our thinking is still limited by both our experience as \nhumans before becoming a scientist and by just being human in \ngeneral. There are things that we will not know for a long time to come, \nand there are things that seem certain now that will be found in error at \nsome point. But we will still be limited by our human mind. The Bible \nclearly states that God is spirit, outside of time and space. We look at \nGod as the why and the reason and we may naturally anthropomorphize Him but \nthat is normal behavior for humans. However, what convinces me is the \nthings that occur in the spirit as it were whereas I will do or say or \nthink or pray or want something specific and there is a response. Now this \nhappens not only more frequently as I do these things, but has become quite \ntargeted and precise. Being as it was only in my spirit or consciousness \nand that I made no physical effort to do anything or tell anyone, and yet \nthe responses occurred anyways, how would one explain that? Certainly \nrandomness and chance are out the window because these things happen in \nresponse and depending on my choice of frequency. They are turning thoughts \nwe cannot measure into something concrete that we can, or in some cases \nknowledge beforehand that  later turns out to be measurable and observable \nbut nonetheless does occur just as explained earlier. So we could say \nsomehow my thoughts send out signals which we cannot see to other forces we \ncannot see and they react in such a way as to send something back that \ngives me the thing I want. But then you have to ask why? Is it good for a \nlife form to get what he wants that is good for him so as to propagate the \nspecies and keep the life form alive longer? But if that is what is \nimportant, why is that important? Why does it matter to the spirit or \ncosmos or whatever it s receiving and responding whether the life form \nlives longer and multiplies, or not? If the forces are inanimate chemical \nreactions or some other form of wave or particle or what have you, why do \nthey \"care\" to respond to my whims and wants? Perhaps they respond to \neverything, but if I want something bad it usually does not happen so it \nseemingly does respond only to good things, which is what the Bible says \nabout getting the desires of our heart if it is good for us and is in \nalignment with His will. Science, if that is what you attribute response to \nprayer to be, would seem to give credence to this idea. But why then? If it \nresponds to anything and not just us and our whims, why only respond to the \ngood things that help us as a species survive longer and attain more \nhappiness, not at anyone else's expense. Why does it matter to an inanimate \nparticle and why would it not respond to our wants if those wants come from \na bad place and would cause harm? How can those particles or waves or what \nwe call the spirit differentiate between the two, and again, why would it \ndo that? How could it do that with no standard of right and wrong or \ngoodness or even intelligence? I am assuming you take me at my word when I \nmake the statements about the back and forth of specific, targeted prayer \nand other things that we as humans do and how they coincide with what the \nBible says. I know I am being honest though you have no way to know that as \nyou do not know me. However, I have written down many specific examples of \nsuch answered prayers and wants and knowing things before they happen or \nbeing given information even from afar that eases my mind or lets me know \nsomething, and as I told no one and as I put no physical effort into \ngathering the information, and as I have seen these things happen only when \nI choose to ask for them, and as they are so targeted and precise, timed \nand influenced by the frequency of my requests, and as they only occur if \nthey are for the good as we perceive it, and as I cannot find any \ncorrelation to randomness or chance that makes any sense, what then would \nyou attribute that to if not what we call the love of God, the why to \nscience's how? And if someone cannot consider that option, perhaps that \nclose-mindedness is just further proof of the limits we either innately \nhave as humans or which we place upon ourselves which leave us wholly \nunable to understand what we would call God or what non-believers would \ncall the theory of everything.",

                "text": "I always have a question in my math class but I've never ask anybody about \nit.  In math class they always use a bouncing ball as an example to \ncalculate rebound of the ball.  eg. 1/2 of its height when it rebound.  \nThen technically it will be an infinite time of bouncing after you drop the \nball on the ground or so to say, everything is bouncing.  But what we know \nor what I know the world is not like that.  If you drop a ball on the \nground even if the ball rebound 1/2 of its height, without a brute force to \npress the ball onto the ground the ball do stop bouncing.  If you input the \nequation into a computer to simulate.  The computer does simulate the ball \nwill keep bouncing infinitely.  So Is there something wrong in the math and \nphysics? Or there has another physics to describe this phenomenon.\n\nIf we use this concept to back track the beginning of the universe.  Could \nit not be not what we expect?  Like the ball doesn't keep rebound \ninfinitely? The universe doesn't shrink infinitely small?  Maybe it does \ncomes in a singularity like the ball will stick to the ground after its \nbeing drop and 1/2 of its height every rebound?  Can't figure it out here, \nhelp me out.\ufeff",

The ball produces no \nfriction, the ground has no friction, and there is no air resistance. Due \nto the elastic qualities of the ball, it will bounce when it hits another \nsurface. When it hits the surface and bounces, there is an impulse. Because \nthe ball bounces, the impulse is very large. Of course when the ball hits, \nthere will be a loss of energy. It will lose energy in a variety of things \nsuch as heat energy. Most importantly though is that momentum has to be \nconserved. When the ball hits, its momentum due to speed converts into the \nearth as momentum due to mass. After this transfer of momentum, the ball \nlosses half of its overall momentum on the rebound.\n\nsorry for the word salad. I tried my best but my thoughts are jumbled today.",

If you add 3 to infinity the sum is not \ngoing to be any bigger obviously but it's bigger than plane infinity. What \nEverett was getting at is the volume of an infinite glass that is half full \nmeans the volume of water is also infinite because as the cup grows larger \nin volume the water matches it to keep it half full.\n\nIf you pour a finite amout of water into this cup then you won't change \nanything. If you pour an infinite amount of water into the cup you will \nstill never fill it up. This is because we started with it half full.\n\nThe cup still has a halfway point. Just because it's volume is infinite \ndoesn't mean we cannot measure it in one way or another. We know the cup is \nhalf full so we know the height of the cup is twice as big as the height of \nthe water roughly. We can even write an equation for it. H (height of the \ncup) = 2 * (A+infinite)\nA is the initinial amout of water it takes to make the cup half full. \nThe halfway point isn't a number but we could come up with an answer \nbecause of how it's defined and it's relations with other things. \n\nBoth are infinite but not the same kind of infinite. Infinite means \nincreasing forever. When you add or multiply with infinity you get a \ndifferent kind of infinity.\n\nEverett's hotel paradox is not the kind of paradox that ends up with a \nfalse conclusion. All it means is when we deal with infinity we get very \nimpractical results to deal with it. We've been dealing with regular \ninfinity as in...\n1 2 3... and so on, there's also this kind of infinite\n0.01           0.001         0.0001... and so on. The list of numbers \nbetween 0 and 1 is also infinite and an even bigger headache is what his \nparadox says. Any questions?",

His arguments seem to suggest that either infinite space or infinite \ndifferentiability of the metric is needed for this to work. Neither \nstatement is true.\n\nGeneral Relativity requires twice differentiability, but one can write down \nan expanding Universe without any such restrictions.\n\n3. \"Singularity\" is in fact the least misleading term in the name. In \nmathematics if something becomes infinite somewhere/when then the thing is \ncalled \"singular\". e.g. f(x) = 1/x is singular at x = 0.\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"happened at a single point\". e.g. f(x,y,z) = 1/z \n is singular along an entire plane. \n\nThey could have just checked \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity\n\n4. Singularity does not mean \"we don't know\". It does indicate a breaking \ndown of General Relativity, but that is because we known quantum mechanics \nis important there. Whether this gets rid of the singularity or not is an \nopen question.\n\n5. \"Time does not make sense\" is a correct conclusion but that is not \nbecause \"our models breakdown\" just like at the North pole North makes no \nsense, but there is nothing breaking down there! In fact if our theories \nare wrong then \"time will not breakdown\".\n\n6. \"Seemingly arbitrary laws of physics\" is very very misleading. There are \nvery very good reasons for why the laws of physics are exactly what they \nare. These are more of a technical nature but these reasons do exist.\n\n7. The Universe having a collapsing phase \"before\" the Big Bang is very \nvery problematic because of the second law of thermodynamics \"entropy \nalways increases\". So normal everyday physics pretty much rules out a prior \ncollapsing phase. It does show up in other theories but their interaction \nwith the second law is not very well understood.\n\nBasically the argument is a follows.\n\na. The entropy should increase with time.\nb. This means the early Universe had very low entropy.\nc. Gravity causes collapse of things. So if something is uniform intially \nit will clump up. This is what happened in our Universe. Early universe was \nmostly uniform, but now we have galaxies and stars.\nd. This must be true in the earlier collapsing phase. So a collapsing phase \ncannot give rise to a very uniform Universe \"after the Big Bang\".",

This questioning salves problems in our world and has \nfurthered high levels of medical, technological and scientific advances. It \nis one of the best questions God have given us to ask. BUT, this line of \n\u201cQuestioning\u201d is also intellectually and scientifically cyclical that has \nto have an end, or the question can\u2019t be asked. Saying everything had to \nhave a \u201ccause\u201d, but this cause goes on eternally backwards is illogical, \nbecause that in itself is an \u201ceternal cause\u201d and ends up making (A) the \ncreator of (A) or Eternal is Eternal and that is a logical absurdity. \n Eternal means = \u201chas\nalways been\u201d. Eternal means it has no beginning and has no end. For the \nAtheist to insist on asking if God had a beginning is as logical as the \nAtheist asking if \u201cMatter and space\u201d had a beginning. They do have their \ndeity, It is their God of the gap, they worship \u201cEternal\u201d, a belief that \ncan\u2019t be explained, observed or tested. Yet they bow down to it, they \npromote it, call on it, bend it, and use it when they reach the end of the \nbeginning that has no beginning. They will even philosophically use it as \nbeyond our comprehension - the deity of omniscience.     \n\nIt will boil down to a pretty simple answer and a very logical and more \nprobable one at that. If there is a God, and he is the \u201cCreator\u201d, then He \nis greater than the sum of his creation, and would not be subject to what \nwe see as creation, i.e. the cause and effect of matter. God is eternal, \nnot matter. Therefore, you either see \"Matter\" as Eternal, or you see God \nas eternal, but both are not true eternal. You either have mindless matter \nas eternal, giving way to Constants/laws/intelligence/morals/determinism, \nor you have a mindful Creator that gave way to \norder/constants/laws/intelligence/morals/free will\u2026 to even deny Him.",

At this stage, yeah I guess I don't know, and \nmaybe I don't want to admit it.

That seems like evidence to me, but is not empirical.

You look at fossils and see something die and take \nhundreds of years to be covered - an impossibility I look at the sediments \nfrom my flood and see the expected billions of dead animals, perfectly \ncovered immediately in an anaerobic environment, so fossilization, a VERY \nRARE phenomenon to happen. So you have two different people looking at the \nsame phenomenon and applying two different paradigms.

ALL the evolutionists arguing steady \nstate cosmology up to that point were ALL wrong. BUT still they mock \ncreationists, even after being proven right so often, while evolution has \nNO pillars that are 50 years old. That is about the maximum life expectancy \nof a \"fact\" of evolution.\n\n Its Never about the evidence - its about what you choose to believe about \nit Forensics is often wrong - even when we already know most of the story. \n That can never be true of historical sciences. Far too may assumptions. \nAnd as expected far too often wrong.\n\nTry explaining C14 in Dinosaurs from YOUR perspective? Fossils out of place \nby 80 million years? Oort's cloud?  The incredible information in the \nsimplest DNA?  Your view cannot even attempt rational answers.\n\nAs far as testing the origins of the universe - of course you cannot. That \nis why it is NOT science in the pure form- it is a narrative about what \nsomeone thinks may have happened.

Important certainly, but it's no magic wand to \nsave my soul, though i might consider it a blueprint on how to.\n\nI consider the holy ghost to be time and circumstance, that which moves us \ntoward destiny.\n\nSpirit i consider to be our animating energy.\n\nHeaven i think of as being one with God in Death. I have no idea what that \nwould be like aside from the possible cosmic hum of energy within the \nuniverse, but i'm fairly certain there wont be any gates, crowns or thrones\n\n To me God is the ever present field of energy within the universe. \nPermeating everything, serving as the base for everything. God is all.\n\n   It's not like i'm denying any of those things exist or have less \nmeaning.

Many of the scientific criticisms of which I speak \nare well known by scientists in various disciplines, including the \ndisciplines of chemistry and biochemistry, in which I have done my work. \n... None of the great discoveries in biology and medicine over the past \ncentury depended on guidance from Darwinian evolution -- it provided no \nsupport. ... In my judgment, this state of affairs has persisted mainly \nbecause too many scientists were afraid to challenge what had become a \nphilosophical orthodoxy among their colleagues. Fortunately, that is \nchanging as many scientists are now beginning to examine the evidence for \nneo-Darwinism more openly and critically in scientific journals.\nIn 2001 the Discovery Institute, the principal sponsoring organization for \nthe intelligent design movement, began to form a list of scientists who \nquestion evolution. Each of the scientists on this list, known as \"A \nScientific Dissent from Darwinism,\" affirmed the following statement \n[Dissent2010]:\n\nWe are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural \nselection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the \nevidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\nAs of April 2012, this list had 840 names.\nhttp://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/evolution/scientists-evolution.php",

They predict things that no had \never observed before, and when the theory told them what they should look \nfor, sure enough it turns out that those predicted effects were there for \nanyone to measure.\n\nNow take the creationist claims (it's not a theory) about the origins of \nthe universe. It was probably first proposed around 100,000 years ago, and \nit was expressed in oral traditions or writing more than 3,000 years ago. \nThe Christian version of the creation myth (a myth that is common to almost \nall religions) began about 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe creationists have had 2,000 years to hone their logic. They've had all \nthat time to marshal their arguments, to test their claims against the \nevidence, to polish up and present the very best case they can possibly \nmake for the gods having conjured the universe from nothing.\n\nAny of you feel like you are getting 2,000 years worth of finely honed, \nwell tested logic when the creationists stumble in here and say \"Oh yeah? \nWell fuck your evidence, I have magic book that tells me how the universe \nwas created, that if the sun stops orbiting the Earth then the day will get \nlonger, that unicorns were real (seriously, it's in the bible, read it), \nthat bats are birds, that rabbits chew cud, and that the Earth is flat\" \n(just ask Daniel who had a tower so tall he could see all \"four corners\" of \nthe Earth)\n\nEvery single claim that religious books make about the natural world is not \njust wrong, it's fantastically, insanely, \nyou've-got-to-be-fucking-kidding-me out in the left field babbling idiocy \nwrong. For exapmle, the bible and the quran both claim that the stars are \nlittle lights embedded in a metal hemisphere, with the quran going on to \nclaim that stars sometimes fall to Earth and are quenched in the ocean.\n\nOkay, I'm shooting fish in a barrel. Let's ignore the fundamentalist wacko \nclaims and consider the \"modern\" mainstream religious claims of magical \ncreation, the conjuring of the universe from nothing by invisible gods.\n\nOkay, invisible gods conjuring a universe from nothing... whut? Seriously? \nWe have a theory that explains the motion of the galaxies, that predicts \nthe relative abundances of light elements in the universe, that predicts \nthe cosmic microwave background and for which there isn't a single bit of \nevidence that seriously refutes the theory... and then we have a claim that \nsome invisible gods magicked the universe into place.\n\n2,000 fucking years they've had. They are presenting are the very *best* \narguments that the very *brightest* minds from *every* country in the world \nwhere there religion is practiced.\n\nYou generally don't see all the ancillary evidence supporting the big bang \ntheory presented or discussed because of the overwhelming nature of the \nbiggest evidence to support it, but there are many smaller bits of \nsupporting evidence. You can seek it out, read about it, look at the \nevidence and test it for yourself.\n\nWhat you're seeing here on youtube is the *very* best, absolutely most \nconvincing evidence for the magical creation claims about the origin of the \nuniverse. There is no hidden cache of data, no myriad of smaller bits of \nevidence, what you're seeing here is the whole fucking enchilada. \nEverything they've ever had, and everything they will ever have is being \npresented to you here \"Well I have a book that says it's magical and it \nsays that the universe was conjured by invisible gods\".\n\n2,000 fucking years to produce that? Seriously?\n\n2,000 years is a long time. Even I could learn to be smart, good looking, \nwell spoken and grow an extraordinarily large penis in that amount of \ntime... so what's holding up progress on presenting a rational case for the \ncreationist claims?\ufeff",

The insults \nand derision are reserved for anyone who makes statements of fact that are \nin clear denial of all the available evidence, which all religion based \nclaims clearly are.\n\nHaving faith is one thing. Abandoning faith for belief is another. A person \nwho has faith doesn't need evidence, and they don't pretend that their own \npersonal faith represents physical/object reality for other people. James \nCarse does his usual wordplay with those concepts in \"The Religious Case \nAgainst Belief\" and it's an idea worth remembering.\n\nThe people who show up in discussion forums to claim that their personal \nbelief in magic translates to reality for all are not religious, because \nthey clearly lack faith. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+faith \"n. Belief \nthat does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.\"\n\nTo claim that the gods made the universe moves clearly from the subjective \nrealm of faith/religion (unfounded beliefs) into the objective realm of \nevidence based reality.\n\nYeah, science *is* awesome and cool but it's also the *only* hope for the \nlong-term survival of our species. It is only through science that we have \nadvanced the human condition so much in the last few hundred years, and all \nthe evidence is that only science can get us through the next few hundred \nyears.\n\nTimothy Ferris \"The Science of Liberty\" does a reasonably good job of \nexplaining why science is absolutely necessary to ensure that liberal \ndemocracies continue to flourish. It's the only way out of the hole that \nreligion and politics dug for us over the last 10,000 years or so.\n\nThe quality of life of every future generation depends on human beings \naccepting that the evidence talks and the bullshit walks - no matter who \nmade the claim/who proposed the theory, if the testable evidence \ncontradicts the claim/theory, then the claim/theory is false/wrong. Period. \nNo exceptions for religious affiliations, no bending the rule for political \naffiliations, no changing the rules for particularly lucrative industries, \nno clinging on to failed theories no matter how famous or popular the \nscientist(s) who presented them.\n\nIt's *all* about the evidence.

I said that the church throughout history has \nhad leaders who have used the authority granted to them by the ignorance of \ntheir many followers as an excuse to control people and cause mayhem, all \nin the name of their corrupted misrepresentation of the holy books. I could \nbet that if all religious followers knew the book inside and out as well as \napplied reason to the moral teachings, there could never be any problems \nfrom a corrupt leader, as the people would know that their leader is wrong.\n\nThe soviets may have been atheists but to assume that their actions were \nthe result of their atheism is not correct. Atheism is, by itself, not \nhaving any faith. There is no correlation with atheism and the oppression \nthey caused on religions. The correct term which explains the reasoning \nbehind their attacks on religion would be anti-theism. This is not a reason \nto cause oppression though, it is indeed the despise of religion but just \nlike religion, it isn't supposed to be used to cause any sort of oppression \nto others who have different positions. The problem is the same as \nreligion's, corrupted leaders who are complete socio/psychopaths and the \nwillingness of their ignorant followers, whether its civilians or military, \nto do what they say.\n\nAntitheism is supposed to ween people off of religion by teaching them \nrationalism and how to view things scientifically, not by bashing them with \nsticks or insults (however frustrating it may be). Same goes for \nmissionaries of religion who seek to teach their own views and allow the \npersons they speak with to choose. The political objectives for both sides \nare what cause this evil to spread, religion was the pope's excuse to \ncreate a war to conquer the holy land during the crusades and anti-theism \nwas part of the excuse the Bolsheviks had.\nIn fact, not even anti-theism is a proper use since it is not claiming \nanything which gives the soviets higher authority to do their evil, they \nwere just plain bad people like any other redneck racist out there.\nIn the end, if the soviets were naturally decent people they would have \ntaught rationalism to their citizens. That would let the people understand \nhow their religion is nonsense rather than delude them into it should be \nreal like the religious do with indoctrination. The crusader's, however, \nwere actually trying to retrieve something which was for their religion, it \nisn't black and white like the Soviet union. If religion didn't exist in \nthe first place, neither the soviets nor the crusaders would have something \nto kill for. ",

This is \nredshift. We expect certain stars to emit light of specific frequencies, \ncalled the emission spectrum. And so we can see that the expected emission \nspectrum is shifted in wavelength towards the red usually, which means the \nlight has expanded, grown longer, as it has travelled through space, \nsuggesting the space has expanded too. Some stars though are blue shifted \nand so are coming towards us",
