This means, if the skippers child, or parents,  have a health \ncondition, and get picked up trying to go through airport security with a \n12 ounce can of soda in their carry on luggage, they could get detained. If \nthey mouth off a bit, or the TSA agent is a dick, they will get put into a \ntemporary holding cell. At this point, the skippers family is now a \nprisoner.  2 years for the skippers family in solitary, without access to \nmedication, resulting in the death of the skippers family would make me say \n\"Good\".",

He deserved to go to jail for Strong Arm \nRobbery, but he did NOT deserve to sit in the hole for even 9 months.  He \nwent straight from the hole to Paroled out into society in ONE DAY.  He \ndidn't even get a week in the General Population before release.  I visited \nhim a couple of days after he was released and he was a quite \"broken\" 28 \nyear old man.  Unless a guy is a serial killer he should not be put in the \nhole for more than 2 or 3 days.  Leaving ANYBODY in the hole is \"cruel and \nunusual punishment\" I don't care how much he deserves to be locked up.  The \nhole is something we all think we know about from TV or we think that WE \nwould never find ourselves there but guess again.  In America our Prison \nSystem is horribly overcrowded and barbaric in a different way than a Third \nWorld Prison.  Knowing the full and awesome Power of \"The State\" is against \nyou could break any Man.  This guy deserves every penny of his lawsuit.  \nBTW; I'm a former small town Cop (34 years ago) and an armed Federal Guard \nso I've talked with hundreds of Convicts and ex-cons and Parole Officers.  \nI'd rather take a beating than go into the hole for even a month.\ufeff",

Or someone at the courts noticing an old casefile \nand reporting it.\n\nListen, my wife was looking into a job at a local prison. Yes, it's part of \nthe standard training that you're not *allowed* to listen to anything that \nthe prisoners say, because every last one of them has one thing in mind, \nfinding a way out. No guard is going to *care* if you tell them that you \nhaven't had your day in court, or in many cases whether you've had a phone \ncall. Some prisons won't let prisoners in solitary confinement *make* phone \ncalls. They're expected to make their phone calls when they get removed \nfrom solitary.\n\nI want you to think about the fact that he screamed for days to get them to \nfix his tooth. He had to remove a rotten tooth *by hand* because they \nwouldn't pay attention to him. Do you know how bad tooth pain is? I split a \nwisdom tooth a few years back. It's the most intense pain I've been in in \nmy life. I can't imagine being in that much pain and  reaching into my own \nmouth to tear a tooth from its socket.

I sold them the \nfiles for \u00a311,000 and the concept for another \u00a312,000 after negotiations, \nthey also purchased other smaller game concepts for \u00a31500 each (2 of them) \nand an interactive cooking app which was separated by culture \n(Mediterranean for example) I got 25k ish different recipes and sold them \nthe files for those for \u00a35000 an the rights for \u00a36000.\nThe last was called \"the guide to world politics\" which was a full app I \nmade myself 2 years ago. They're probably going to change it a lot before \nrelease but that was purchased from me for \u00a34000. It was my first app and \nnot very professional.\n\nMy cousins stepfather is a prison warden and I was asking about the \ndifferences between the prisons he has worked in and what the different \nlaws are and traits compared to the US. We have better laws to protect the \ninmates. I am sorry but anyone you know who went to jail in the UK was \nprobably a pedophile if they had a bad experience.\nI do a side course in politics and world law, the UK has plenty of laws \nthat the US does not have which entitle inmates to better care and \naftercare.\n\nThe majority of people in Africa never received a good education, as long \nas the PMC managed to successfully instigate a coup with the promise of \nfreedom an protected the people, others would follow their lead. After time \nif a few billion was pumped into development and security things would \nalready be infinitely better. I guess you don't know about how these \nleaders operate or rule...with violence and fear, it does not take much to \nget people to fight back against men they hate for the promise of freedom, \njust look at how Scotland rose against the English or the US rose up \nagainst the Empire.\nHope is the most dangerous thing in the world and inspires acts of heroism \nand bravery in conflict.\n50 PMC veteran fighters vs 3000 government militia, the 3000 would be \nfucked.\nThere seems no point in explaining to someone who does not understand \npolitics or war...\n\n\n\n ",

                    "text": "+kristian perez\nI just came up with a plan in 3 minutes to take a single country very \neasily. You underestimate how poor these places are and what you can buy \nwith $50 (a whole apartment)\nIf you were to go to a country where the government is weak and rules by \nfear you can then exploit that fear by recruiting people to fight, in \nAfrica weapons can be purchased easily and for very little. All are Russian \nmade AK's of some form, very good and reliable weapons.\nSay you hired 100 contractors, they can lead the way with the new militia \nbehind them, as long as the group had no HQ you could order attack on \ngovernment held towns and villages, then flee before a response can be made.\nSay you got Blackwater in, they have some very skilled snipers, set 2 of \nthem up in a good spot and have some men with them to guard that spot, they \ncan take shots all day. Eventually the group would quickly start making \nheadway. These governments are poor and have little support, therefore can \nbe easily overthrown, it may be as fast a 6 months with less than 3 million \nspent.\nIt really is that simple.\n2 years with no social interactions may put you in the best position \npossible to do this kind of thing.\nYour mind is gone, nothing left to lose,\nBlackwater are a good organisation, most ex US and British forces who have \ncontracts with the US. It is not the nature of a business to kill it's \nclients.\nHell, if you were in jail for 2 years that is then 2 years to think about \nwhat to do and get a better plan together.\n\nA previous civil war is just the thing that would be needed, government \nloyalists are kept loyal through money and fear of having their families \nkilled. Once the government is toppled (that could actually be very easy if \nyou could get a large bribe to one of the leaders of their remaining \nmilitary) they would then be safe.\nFrom there, you appoint a puppet to rule, someone with no backbone would be \ngreat.\nThe countries income could be spent only on schools, healthcare centers, \nsmall businesses who could not properly start up before, creating farms, \nthat would probably create a lot in exports too. I would then build \nclothing factories in which people could work, again these would go out as \nexports, these would be government owned, all profit from them could be put \nback into the country.\nThis would be the first actual development in Africa since the slavers from \nEurope and the US went there. I am sure after this other countries would \nwelcome some liberators. The $22 million would be blown quickly but it does \nnot take a good economy to start making more than that. Africa has huge \npotential in exports, this could easily be capitalized upon.\n\nThe country would be put under the control of a puppet, a built like \nAmerica did in Afghanistan, Iraq and Ukraine. This man holds no power, the \nmilitary don't do what he says, they only guard him from attack. It's been \ndone before hundreds of times in history and there is no reason why it \ncan't work again, I mean parts of Africa used to be puppet states to Rome.\n\nYou have to understand leaders in Africa are nothing like in the west.\nMany came to power through brutal tribal wars after their leaders had been \nkilled off and they were the highest ranking man in the end, they don't \nknow how to rule because they are not educated so d it the only way they \nknow, through violence, oppression and threats. Just hearing about a \nwesterner who is coming to liberate (which could be spread by propaganda \nposters being air dropped) would sound amazing to these people. Especialy \nif it listed the changes that would be made\n\nFrom there, as a source of income a private militia could be set up, \ntrained by ex British soldiers and set up to fight for whoever offered the \nmost.\nWith the current situation across the world many countries will have no \nfresh water supplies in 20 years, this means that they will start fighting \nover the sources, like freshwater lakes and rivers. If a contract was \noffered to the stronger country tied up in this conflict, there would be \nbig money to be made.\nWe are talking billions this time. About 8 billion for a well trained, \nEnglish speaking force of a few thousand men, 6 billion would be invested \nback into the country, 1 billion into the group (buying armoured vehicles).",

Also, if he moans about pain or mumbles something in his attempt \nto tell them something could only annoy them and thus justify their \nmistreating/ignoring his plight even more just out of spite. There's \nprejudgement possibly in play for DUI suspects. \n\nThe report mentioned the reason he was placed in solitary because he \nsuicidal, but the rest of the story does not make much sense because if the \nreason was accurate then he should have been monitored closely to keep him \nfrom killing himself and he should have been seen by a mental health \nprofessional to assess and provide treatment so he wouldn't be suicidal \nanymore and not need the more costly special cell and monitoring. They \nmight have just made the reason up to cover up their sadistic act thinking, \nwrongly for people familiar with suicidal risks, that it would somehow make \nthem seem like they cared about his health and wellbeing. However, two \nyears of inhumane treatment through neglect makes their claim absurd on its \nface and damns them even more for not getting him the medical treatment \nthat they admitted they knew about and concerned enough about him killing \nhimself to take protective measures.\n\nThe state of Texas was forced to overhaul it's mental health laws last year \nafter a study revealed that hundreds of people with serious mental illness \nsit in jail each year awaiting psychiatric evaluation and treatment in \norder for them to be deemed competent to stand trial. Most more never seen \nby anyone and wait for months, with some locked up for over two years with \nno trial date in sight.

My point with weed was that just because you ban \nsomething doesn't mean people who break the law *wont* get it anyway.\nI have already named a study from Harvard and you have yet to explain how \nthis prestigious center for thought may be biased or unsound. However, I \ncan give another. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that from 1993 \nto 2010 the highest rates of firearm violence were among blacks, *males*, \nand *young adults (18-24)*. Even your own source says first off that *male* \n(not female) teens are most likely to dy by firearms. It also says 3/4 \nof of these murders are *gang related*. Sounds to me like the real problem \nis gangs, not guns. It also points out that school shootings, despite their \nmedia hype, accounted for *1%* of \"All child homicides\" in 2009-2010! So \nwhy do you use Adam Lanza if not only for the moral shock value?\nI'd like to know that story about the teacher gettin shot in training. Not \nto mention, it doesn't have to be mandatory. According to the National \nCenter for Education Statistics (a government bureau) the average estimated \nsalary for teachers in elementary and secondary schools is about *$56K*. \nThat's \"barely enough\"? Hell, that's almost *twice* what I make as a \nfull-time certified aircraft mechanic, and I don't get a 3 month vacation \neither!\nSo tell me why I shoul'nt be concerned about \"militarization\"? Why \nshouldn't I be worried when police (already proven time and again as \ncorrupt) are accquiring 50cal machine guns, army surplus tanks, drones, and \neven blackhawk helicopters?

Many states and even more cities don't even allow conceal and carry \npermits. There even was a case where a Chicago man was charged with \nposession of an hand gun (illegal in that city at the time) after he used \nit to stop an armed intruder in his own home.\nNow, if criminal are using modern weaponry, and citizens are restricted to \nmuzzle loaders, thatstill leaves them pretty hopeless. Truth is, Benjamin \nFranklin demonstrated that a quality bow and arrow was more effective than \nthe rifles of the time. If you have seen police videos, you also see that \nsuspects on a variety of hard drugs can shake off pepper spray or tasers. A \ntasr is also single shot and you may have multiple attackers, which is \nquite common in muggings. What happened at Sandy Hook was a trajedy, but it \ncould've been less so if each teacher was given a handgun and training. And \nshooters would be less likely to pick schools if they know this.\nAs for firepower, the term \"assault rifle\" was coined by people who have no \nknowlege of guns in the first place. Example: my father has a collection of \nvintage rifles that are classified as assault weapons. Every single one of \nthem is bolt-action. They are assault weapons only because you can stick a \nbayonett on them. \"assault\" weapons only means they look like the ones the \narmy uses; nothing more. a bayonett, a pistol grip, flash supressor, \nfolding stock, none of it has to do with the gun's actual firepower.\nWhy this kind of firepower? There is an article that may interest you. it's \ncalled \"Comming to a Police Station Near You\". And it points out the \nalarming rate of militarization of our police forces, and it doesn't lay \nthe blame on liberal policies either. It even puts some of the blame on \narms brokers. Please read it. As I said, the purpose of the second \nammendment is to allow the citizenry to protect itself from an opressive \ngovenment (as well as a foreign invasion, and I dont mean immigrants). If \nthe govenment is posessing fully automatic weaponry and the people have \nonly muzzle loaders, then they're still helpless. No we don't ned grenades \nor missile launchers, but we need to be capable of resistane.\nRemember though, an armed rebellion is not something we conservatives talk \nabout lightly. America is far from ever needing to even consider that \noption yet. But every population needs a last resort.",

There is no reason the guns Adam Lanza and many other \nshooters like him should have had the guns they had (or should have had a \ngun at all). My next question to you is why you need such firepower when a \nstun gun would do just fine, and so now I do not take back my comment about \novercompensation.

Now, I could just throw some blind insults like you just did, but \nrather, I want to reach you; to make you my brother.

All the places \nwith the strictest gun controll laws. You never hear about Houston or \nNashville having rampant gun violence. The truth is, for every \none-in-a-million psycho who goes on a rampage, there are hundreds or \nthousands of violent crimes stopped or prevented by the presence of a gun. \nIn fact, Harvord Journal of Law has released a 40p study concluting that \nbanning firearms does not reduce murder or suicide rates.\nNow, lets take a look at *why* we conservatives love our guns so much. It \ngoes back to the very nature of the American spirit; one of rugged self \nsufficiency. We want to take care of ourselves and we dont trust a big \ngovernment to do that. Guns allow us to hunt our own food and protect our \nproperty, family, and lives. They are the essence of survival in a hostile \nworld. More over, they are the single greatest obstacle to a tyranical \ngovernment. That is the entire purpose of the second ammendment. The \nfounders knew that a day *may* come when the government becomes so corrupt \nand detatched that the people have to cast it off and start over.

Example: Supposed Magnetic Reversals on the Sea \nbed supporting Old Earth Theory....many magnetic reversals in the magnetic \nfield of the rocks making up the seabed would have to mean that the North \nand South Poles had to have flipped many times throughout a long duration \nof time, suggesting that the Earth is very old. \nDEBUNKING: quite simple example of media and scientists altering results to \nget the outcome they want. There are NO magnetic reversals on the sea bed. \nhere's the real unaltered data. There was a pattern of low and high \nmagnetisms in the rock on the seabed that they scanned with a boat-tugged \ndevice, and a scientist decided to put a sinusoidal axis through the wave \npattern and said \" anything below the sinusoidal axis will be considered a \nnegative magnetism and anything above will be positive.\"\nto highlight the flaw in this reasoning, i'll use a parallel structure. A \ngroup of 30 people's height are measured, the average height is found, a \nscientist then feels inclined to claim that anybody below the average \nheight has experienced a height reversal. don't make much sense do it?\nP.S. MUCH more details went into this, but it would have looked more like \nan essay then, and i'd rather not spend five minutes boring you just to \ndebunk one \"fact\" that proves an old earth",

I too was once as ignorant as \nyou. But then I began to study law, and so let me enlighten you as to why \nyou are wrong, and why we must care about this douche. \n\n       The United States judicial system on every level often makes major \ndecisions in policy on what is called case law. That means that even one \ncase that raises all of these issues can be cited in future cases to form \ndecisions in court about them. In effect, what happens to even one person \nin the justice system in the USA can affect EVERYONE AFTER HIM IN THE SAME \nSITUATION. Basically the law in the justice system is something that is \nconstantly evolving, like science in order to get it right, something that \nwill never happen, but they are always theoretically coming closer. So this \nkind of sets a precedent in the court system in a way , in the same way \nthat major cases like Roe V WAde, Bruce Rich V Fl DOC Dusky Vs United \nStates etc. have. \n\n\nIn the justice system in the US there is no room for even one case being \nhandled badly, as like I said the entire system is evolving constantly and \nshaping itself. I guess I didnt explain that too well, my bad, but I hope \nyou get the idea. And no, you dont have to care about him, but you should \nas a fellow human being, more than anything you have to care about \nyourself, dont believe me if you dont want but THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU \nTOO!!! TRUST MEE! All it takes is one ahole who hates you, and a corrrupt \nsystem that is willing to take you. Oh and also your tax dollars are paying \nfor it, so in a way your as responsible for it as Saudi Arabia is \nresponsible for Al Qauda!!!",

Certain drug trafficking crimes can carry the death penalty.\n\n\"That is a completely logical use of the death penalty. Murderers, in most \ncases, don't deserve to live.\"\n\nUntrue. Most murders are crimes of passion or done inadvertently in the \ncommission of another crime.  Very few murderers would, or have, ever gone \non to commit a second murder regardless of how long they spent locked up. \nThat holds true in the U.S. and other countries that have <life sentences \nfor murder.  If recidivism were the sole criteria, we'd let the murderers \nout and keep burglars locked up.  The murderers it could be logically \nargued deserve to die are serial and contract killers. The former are not \nthat common and the latter are rarely caught.\n\nThere are no uses for the death penalty not based on *illogic* and emotion.\nThe only logical use of the death penalty is the protection of society or \nthe staff and inmates of a prison. With the prisons we have today, none of \nthose goals requires the death penalty.  Capital punishment doesn't even \nmake sense in purely economic terms.\n\n\"In the EU, prisoners are treated extra-kindly and given light sentences, \nbecause Heaven forbid that a murderer should spend the rest of his life in \nprison, or be killed himself. What a tragedy that would be!\"\n\nWould you rather live somewhere with a very high crime rate that punishes \ncriminals as severely as possible, or somewhere with an extremely low crime \nrate that doesn't punish criminals at all? According to you, you'd prefer \nthe former.  The proof is in the pudding. The EU has a crime rate that \nwouldn't make a blip in the U.S. crime statistics.  Whatever they're doing, \nit works. What we do is expensive, often immoral and *doesn't work*.  \n\nBut I suppose you are one of those people for whom crime prevention is not \nthe purpose of the criminal justice system. You want your blood and if it \nmeans the crime rate rises and even more people are hurt or killed, that's \na small price for them to pay for your satisfaction.\n\n\"LOL The EU is such a stupid place. I'm so happy I don't live in one of \nthose disgusting nations.\"\n\nSo are they. In fact, I'm pretty sure you'd have a hard time immigrating to \nthe EU. They wouldn't want you. They don't want ignorant American \nimmigrants. That window closed several decades ago. America is to the EU \nwhat Guatemala is to America. They don't want uneducated Americans with a \npropensity for violent behavior and nothing to contribute.  So, instead of \nliving in a \"stupid\" place with low crime, better health and education and \nless social dysfunction, you're stuck in a country full of ignorant people, \nwith a high crime rate, a crappy health and education system, endemic \ncorruption and widespread social dysfunction. Congratulations. You're a \n*real* 'Murikan and a real 'Murikan never goes anywhere.",
