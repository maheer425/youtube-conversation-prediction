A bear CAN come into your home and eat you and your children. But it \ndoesn't. On average someone who swims in the ocean at least once a year \nwill be within 15 feet of a shark large enough to mutilate them. But it \ndoesn't. Why? Because they don't need to. They can find food and that's all \nthey need. Human beings don't need a majority of the bullshit they acquire. \nYet they do. Because they can. And the only thing that matters is them. \nDon't you think the bear cares more about itself than you?\n\n\nThe thing that is so fucked up about the extinction of thousands of species \nin the last 600 years is that it didn't need to happen. We would have \nsurvived and still thrived without the eradication of countless animals. \nSome of which are so fascinating and so rare that they live on only in \nmyth... when we could have seen and studied them in real life if we didn't \ndestroy their habitat and remorselessly hunt them down. Unlike some people, \nI can see all that nature has given us, and I think that by only paying it \nback with destruction is the same as biting the hand that feeds you. It's \nlow. It's more than low. Bite it enough and that hand will stop feeding you.\n\n\nHonestly I do sometimes wish a pack of rouge bears would come and eat \nentire towns so people could know what it feels like to be hunted down to \nthe last man. But, of course, we wouldn't learn a lesson there. We'd just \nkill off all the bears for doing a minute scale version of what we've done \nfor millennia.\ufeff",

I wish people would just see \nhow it hurts for a species to become endangered but we can't see that \nbecause we are doing a part in their destruction. We're on the top of the \nfood chain so we don't feel all that threatened about other animals and \neven if we do, we only look at the simplest solution... to eradicate them.",

Politics \nplay a part of it but it's not the major player in it.\n\nPlease don't tell me that you believe what you're saying about companies. \nWho do you think is in control of the big corporations? There's a few \ncorporations in the world who control the smaller ones. Also that is not \nthe point I was trying to make. I was talking about the whole system of \n\"get up, go work, go home, sleep, repeat\". That's the big portion of ours \nlives in a nut shell. Well... The big majority of it anyway.\n\nWhat you tried to say about the hormones is entirely untrue. It's actually \nthe opposite. After cows started to get injected with hormones - their \nhealth got worse and the meat can cause countless health problems to those \nwho eat them longterm, but the cows produced a lot more milk so that's good \nfor business. It doesn't make them healthier in any way, shape or form, or \nyou... You really think that the ones who make those products think about \nthe quality of their products? That is really depressing... I'm sorry to \nbreak it to you, but there's only one thing people in that industry cares \nabout and you probably know what that is. If pushing toxic but cheaper \nproducts would be legal - they would do it. They don't give a shit about \nyou or anyone else who eats that meat. You should watch Documentary \"Food \nInc.\" it covers most of what I'm trying to say here and more.\n\nHow can you be so selfish? It's really hard for me to comprehend such \nscumbaggery... No one will stop you forcibly, but if it was made legal, I \nwould do more than stop you from hunting other animals.\n\nThat is the entire point. Money is what stops humanity from being something \nmore than mindless, fucking assholes like you. But I don't have time to get \ninto that discussion right now.\n\nYou need to wake up and smell the coffee, because I cringe at your utter \nmaterialism and selfishness. I really don't have anything else to say to \nyou, because I get worked up because of your ignorance.",

How can we support a \npopulation this size without finding ways to meat out of cows? That's why \nwe use steroids to make them bigger, and leaner. all the chemicals and \nhormones are for a better quality product so we don't starve to death. And \nuntil a way that comes across that is efficeint and ecomically sound, the \ncompanies will switch. \n\nYes, it does. We are on top, I can hunt animals, you don't like it? Too \nbad. You would have to forcibly stop me, which you can't.

                    "text": "+Dan A oh wow. Where do I even begin here.\n\nWe won't colonize other planets any time soon. We won't deplete entirely \nEarth's resources, because we will destroy each other before we can do \nthat. Look at the world right now. Worldwide conflicts brewing every day. \nWe are in a brink of world war 3 and you think that we will venture into \nspace some time tomorrow? Don't. Just don't.\n\nIt's sad that you think that without destroying your own planet you can \nonly wear \"leave pajamas\" and live in \"mud huts\". Your thinking is so \nsimplistic and one directional as it possibly can be. If instead of making \nproducts to control you - we made products to help our needs and the \nenvironment, everything would be infinitely times better. But it won't - \nbecause of people like you, who stay the way it is right now. We are \nevolving, but to what direction? People with higher power don't care about \nany of us or the world they live in. All they care about is how to control \nyou and me. You are saying things that they want you to say. Like we've got \nthe right to exploit our planet's resources and lives of other sentient \nbeings - humans or nonhumans. Electricity can easily be made with magnet \ngenerators. Everything has an alternative for the better of everyone, but \nbecause those things won't make a profit like the ones right now - no one \nwill do it. That is the point here.\n\nIn my opinion - we live in the dark ages. Just with a better technology. If \nyou think that technology alone shows how we are not in the dark - I feel \nvery sorry for you. Our ways of doing things have changed, but the purpose \nstayed the same and in most cases got even worse. For example - in \"the \ndark ages\" as you call it, our ancestors hunted to survive and to eat \nanother day, but in today's society - humans breed animals, inject them \nwith hormones that cause those animals enormous pain and suffering, \nseparate mothers from their cubs just so they wouldn't drink all the milk \nfrom their mother that was meant for them. Not only that, but keep them in \nmachines so their leg muscles couldn't form to produce more tender meat, \nthen slaughter them and keep doing it for the biggest profit. If this is \nthe direction we are evolving to, I want to part of it. No other animal in \nthis world will ever reach the level of cruelty of ours.\n\nLast time I checked, Benq, MSI and other companies don't cut any trees and \nit's not made of animal parts - so I doubt any animals had to be killed in \nthe process of making my computer. More so, how do you know what methods \nare used to make electricity in my city? There's different ways to run \ndifferent generators to generate energy. It brings me back to alternate \nmethods. Everything you state in your paragraphs can be made without \nharming environment, animals and humans. You just have to do some research \nabout them. No one uses those, because the ones that they use now brings \nmore profit. Everything around you is being run by greed of other people. \nPeople that don't want you to be free. Your whole life is about serving \nsomeone \"more important\" than you, but the fact is - no one is more \nimportant. Every person or living being deserves his way of freedom.\n\nSo the questions I want to ask is - Why can't we adapt our technology for \nthe better of everyone on the planet? Not just the people who are in charge \nor just people, but everything? Animals, plants and so on. We are so \nadvanced that we see ourselves better than animals, which by your opinion \ndoesn't care about anything else but themselves. So if we are more advanced \nand not like other animals - why focus solely on ourselves and see other \nbeings suffer just so you could have a more comfortable life? Didn't we \nreach a point now that we are beyond only survival? Does the selfish life \nof being On Top of The Food Chain fulfill you? Surely you say that Earth's \nresources are so vast and plentiful, so why not use it for something else \nmore than ourselves?",

What exactly is \ntheir significance aside from being cute? This is the way nature has been \nworking for billions of years and approximately more than 99% of all \nspecies that have ever roamed this planet have gone extinct. I think most \nanimal lovers seem to forget that we humans are a part of nature so if a \nspecies directly or indirectly goes extinct because of us it's just a part \nof natural selection, isn't it?

Natural selection makes the world go 'round. So why should we care or \nat least why do some (including me) care? Because some of us are \ncompassionate beings and we would hate to see another creature die and be \ncompletely wiped out of existence even if they \"are not vital to our own \nsurvival\" thats why. Because some of us DO think and see the value in each \nliving being even if its not a contributory value.

Pollution, \nsoil erosion, and a dramatic waste of FOOD come from us throwing a natural \nenvironment out of balance. Even in the case of making a population \nexplode. (ie cattle)\n\nEverything effects everything on this earth. We don't even understand the \nfull extent of ecology but we know that when we abuse and overuse the land \nwe can no longer live off it. That's a concept so simple a 5th grader could \nunderstand. That is what we are doing to the world. \n\nIf we do not stop we will see major food and resource shortages within our \nlifetimes. And part of the reason is because we are destroying the \nenvironment and the creatures that naturally coexist with other creatures. \nThat other creatures, ones we live off of, use to live. Human beings can \nhave a symbiotic relationship with earth if we choose. But as has been said \nwe choose not to due to greed. Because of this we will not only destroy \nlarge amounts of the beauty in this earth, but also ourselves. We will \nbecome the extinct species in the end because of this \"the only thing that \nis important is me\" mentality.\n\n\nDon't worry though. We're not quite there yet.

The cloning system is \nimperfect, and I've learned a lot through this thread about how it works \nand what the consequences are.\nHowever, I actually wanted to use the cloning technology as another form of \na safeguard against animals going extinct.

Same as cattle varieties. Breed them and create hybrids with \nmore robust species. We don't need to preserve the individual species in \norder to keep the animals alive. Particularly because the more we try to \nconserve them, the more they end up inbreeding and gaining deformities.\n\nThat's what they did with the tortoise, and it can be done with other \nendangered species as well.\ufeff",

Making it \nimpossible for anything to evolve, because that animal/person would die \nbefore 1 million years.\"\n\nDear god, I am facedesking so hard right now. It's not one single \nindividual animal that evolves, it's hundreds in a line of animals. \n\nLet me give you this as an example.\n\nThis is called natural selection:\nThere are two sets of bugs. One has a biological immunity to a certain type \nof poison that a farmer sprays, the other doesn't, this one is the control \ngroup. The farmer sprays the poison, and the control group dies, and the \nother goes on to mate with a group of females that weren't exposed to the \npoison. The immunity trait then gets passe don the children of that bug, \nand  a generation of poison immune bugs have just been made.\n\nThe idea of Natural Selection is often shortened to survival of the \nfittest. But Natural Selection actually states that those better adapted to \nthe environment will produce more offspring that will live, thus producing \nmore animals with the adaptations that allow them to survive. Whereas those \nwithout the adaptations will die off because they can not produce as much \noffspring.\n\nNow extrapolate this over millions of years, and you get the basis of \nEvolution.\n\nEvolution doesn't say we came from chimps, it says that chimps and Humans \nshare a common ancestor. A place in our history where we split and became \nthe original template for Humanity. However, we have yet to find that \nmissing link, the Father, or possibly even, Mother of Humanity. But that \ndoesn't mean it doesn't exist. As conditions for fossilization often don't \nexist. Or the fossil possibly didn't even survive up to this point.",

Is there any proof that the devices used to show resemblance \nactually work. For example, a device says that one object like a fossil is \none billion years of age. How can you actually prove it is that old? You \ncan't, unless we can time travel. Which is as of now impossible. All that \nhas been explained so far is only adaptation. Supposedly evolution takes \nmillions of years to take place. Making it impossible for anything to \nevolve, because that animal/person would die before 1 million years. If the \nenvironment changed from one moment to another, then all the animals would \ndie leaving this Earth barren. Unless evolution isn't true, then that would \nexplain a lot.",

The theory suggests that Humans, apes, monkeys \nand other primates share the same ancestor, and this is backed up through \ngenetic research.\nA lizard did not \"turn into a Tyrannosaurus Rex\". Evolution merely suggests \nthat reptiles developed earlier, and housed similar characteristics to \nthem. Dinosaurs in general are more attributed to birds based on the \ngenetic structure we've gathered, as well as bone structure, and the \ndiscovery that some dinosaur species house evidence of feathers and \nfeather-like appendages.\nAnother leaning towards the theory of Evolution is the eerily striking \nsimilarities between entirely species of animals when studying early formed \nfoetuses. I highly doubt a deity would go to the trouble to make an early \nHuman embryo look similar to one of a fish, right down to the evidence of a \ntail and gills!\nDon't laugh off Evolution as a fanciful delusion made up by Athiests. \nDarwin was a devout Christian who was trying to figure out how the world \nworked. And this isn't addressing the theory that he plagiarised the \ninformation from other Naturalists and his remark on how Aboriginals \n\"exhibit Human-like behaviour\".\nI probably got some information wrong, but I'm merely using memory based on \ninformation I've gathered over the years. Evolution just makes the most \nsense to me. Until some other method is discovered and scientifically \nproven my money on Evolution.",

Maybe not to the extinct on some \nbut hunting keeps population in check. And not really just for that \nspecies. We do take it over board though. I will admit that.\nHowever, for those saying the world would be better off of humans died. \nThat is false. Humanity is a large supporter of life. If our race dies out \nthen countless others will soon fall behind. Which leads to others. And a \nhuge chain reaction. Ecosystems suffer as well. The reason why is because, \nas I explained before, we keep populations in check. We are one of the main \npredators for some animals. If we die then they will reach their carrying \ncapacities and eventually hurt themselves. Then they will die and leave \nother animals without food and others will get out of control to. \nPlant life comes into affect when nothing is there to eat or maintain it. \nIt becomes overgrown and such, causing other plants not to get sunlight. \ufeff",

If they were to die out, this \nwould cause a vast number of trees and bushes to go extinct as well. Well, \naccording to your reasoning, that's not all that bad. If they're gone, \nthey're gone, and nobody should worry, right? Some of those trees affected \nthe most by a potential extinction of bees are apple and other cultivated \nfruit trees, and a vast number of other plants important to us humans for \none or another reason.

And please do correct me if I'm mathematically or scientifically \nincorrect.\n\nOkay, so most of you pretty much hate the man race for doing such things to \nanimals. Some people might even go as far as to hope for the extinction of \nour own race. But I did some research and some math, and if there are \n100,000,000 different species on earth, and the extinction rate is \n0.01%/year, at least 10,000 species will go instinct each year. But keep in \nmind that scientifically, between 1.4 and 1.8 million species has been \ndiscovered. Now keep I'm mind that over 95% percent of the ocean is \nundiscovered, and the ocean makes up 70% of the earth. 80% of that 100% of \nspecies are still undiscovered. The fact that we still have not grasped \neven the most simplistic way of discovering half of those 80% of species, \nor half of that 95% of oceanic floor should make you think. The 1.4-1.8 \nmillion we have scientifically found, vs the 7.3-6.9 million species still \nyet to be discovered, making a total estimate of 8.7 million species in \ntotal, or maybe more since 70% or more of our earth is either undiscovered \nor unexplored. With this being said, estimating that the lowest would be \naround 100 million different species is true, then there are about 2 \nmillion species discovered/yet to be explored more in depth. . The the rate \nwould be about 200 - 2,000 extinctions each year. This is accounting for \nthe loss of our biodiversity, but there are too many variables to keep \ntrack of. As a pose to natural extinction rate which would be \n1,000-10,000'less that it is now. Though I hate to imagine how much \nbiodiversity we are losing while still maintaing the ecosystem services \nthat humanity depends upon. I wouldn't go as fat to hope we as a species \ndie, for there are a few out there who at least try to something instead of \nsitting watching this video and complain how 'humans are single handedly \ndestroying endangered animals'. The Convention on Biological Diversity \n(CBD) is actually trying to save them by starting the Biodiversity Action \nPlan (BAP) by identifying these animals and saving them. Instead of sitting \nhere, again, complaining. \ufeff",

We need to \ncarefully try to change our corse of living while preserving the animals \naround us. The commenters only care for the the adorable animals that are \ndying out because people want their meat, and grilled to perfection. Or the \ncutting down of their habitat because more and more of them want the latest \nandroid or apple product. Some of these people don't know how diverse is \nour ecosystem, and just to say they hate the human race for it, merely does \nnothing for it. Because they are part of that human race. And frankly, \ninstead of just saying negativity, they should do something.

In reality, a large group of people have forced many to believe \nin only a black and white, and that either the black or white must reign. \n In the case of many extremist environmentalists the black is the human \nrace, and the white is everyone else.  Ere go, the perfect world is where \nevery last human is dead and life lives on without us...which is incredibly \nself-destructive and in my opinion a crime against nature's laws itself \n(more on that later).\n\nPeople rail against hunters for hunting animals for sport.  A lot of people \ndon't know (or rather refuse to believe) that these same hunters are the \nreason why we have wildlife reserves and wildlife conservation in the first \nplace.  Hunters love their sport, primarily because it is a way of life and \na means to reconnect with our roots, where we didn't have massive farms \ndedicated to butchering cows for our Mcdonalds hamburgers, and we were \nforced to live off of the lay of the land.  Of course, naturally hunting \ncan't happen anymore when you're game is either gone or so rare it will be \ngone soon, so hunters solved this by giving back to nature what they take \naway.  Hunting seasons only occur when the level of prey like Elk or Deer \nis at a considerable level, and even then only certain genders are ever \ntargeted each year.  Once you do manage to bag and tag your buck or doe, it \nis considered against the law to waste your meat, so you essentially have \nto carry nearly the entire animal back with you for food, and the antlers \nand head are the sole reminder of your successful hunt.  It's not like in \nthe movies where people go about randomly killing rhinos and elephants and \nleaving them to die anymore.  Hunters really do care, and it's only the \nvery few (and very disliked and shunned by the greater hunting community) \nstupid ones who are ever caught on camera and added to the hype to get rid \nof them.\n\nNow I know what people are thinking; that this is a long bit of \nconversation written by a guy who probably either lives on a farm or in a \ncity and has only the internet to inform him on this.  Nope, I live in \nIdaho, which is almost hunting-controversy central.  We used to have native \nwolves that were hunted down by people who were careless and didn't think \nabout the consequences, thinking only about their businesses and the \nwell-being of their lifestyle.  Thanks to that purge of a vital predator, \nour entire ecosystem up north has been thrown into chaos, and it's only \nbeen recently that we've got new wolves back.  But these wolves are not the \nones we've wanted; these are Canadian wolves with absolutely no experience \nwith humans.  They are huge, they see us as food, and they are a problem. \n Sure, we got our ecosystem back up and running, but it is at the expense \nof much of our wellbeing, and there's a good chance that these wolves will \nmeet the same fate as the old Idaho wolf in the future.\n\nBy the way; the same people who authorized the killing of those wolves, \nthey're among the same people who now sponsor the supposed environmentalist \ngroups today, and who also brought in the Canadian Wolves up from the \nnorth.  They also authorized for vast amounts of salmon to be buried in the \nconstruction of the dams here in Hell's Canyon when the dams were being \nbuilt.  I know this because my grandfather worked on those dams, and was \namong the people who buried them himself.\n\nFood for thought, people.  The lesson; don't pick an extreme.  Do your \nresearch and benefit for the good of all, not just for the good of one side \nor the other.  We could all do with a bit of lesson learning in this day \nand age, that I promise you...",

If you have (which I don't believe you if you say no because even \nthe Dalai Lama kills insects) do you eat them after? I mean they pose no \nthreat only a slight annoyance.

Its actually amazing \nhow people perceive life based on how much we like the species.",

Basic society causes the most problems, \nconstruction, industry, hunting, etc. But the \"Government\" are also doing \nthings to help the situation when possible. Natural Selection is when \nanimals are born with a mutation that suites the environment they live in, \ngiving them a higher chance to survive, which means a higher chance to \nreproduce and pass that mutation on to the rest of the species. It has \nnothing to do with people arming themselves. When you pick up a firearm, \nyou can't say you mutated. Obesity is just another disadvantage of basic \nsociety. Humans aren't meant to be like everyday animals, we as a species \ncan't be natural and still survive. We need clothes, weapons, tools, \ninventions, communication, cooked food, medicine, and the list goes on. We \ndon't really count anymore when it comes to a food chain. Naturally \nextinction isn't a problem unless the species isn't adapted to survive. \nAlthough population increase and decrease is possible, we just normally get \nin the way of the natural pattern on accident.

It's a beautiful \nthing to return a dead thing to a life-like state once more.\nAlso I support hunting (to an extent.) If you use all the parts of the \nanimal I see nothing wrong with it.
