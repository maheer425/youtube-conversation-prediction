Also, the buns cooked in \nhalf the time you said to keep them in the oven (20 minutes) I do know that \nmy oven isn't calibrated properly so it does overheat, but i always keep my \neye on things when cooking. But I don't think the overheating alone caused \nthe fast cooking. Could it have been that i put them too low and that I \nused a thin baking tray? Would that affect the cooking time?\ufeff",

It is natural yeast that is created in these \ndoughs so you will always get a bit of that in a no knead dough. In my \nrecipe it really is a tiny bit of yeast. The flavor is a tiny boozy (what \nyou are saying is yeasty) but it is good flavor, not bad. I do recommend \nyou try it. I feel you will really like it. If you do, make a full recipe. \nI don't recommend to half this recipe, it doesn't like that :).Sound good?",

If you don't like honey you can just use the same weight in \nsugar. maybe a light brown sugar. If you are worried about the flavor being \nlike honey, don't worry it isn't and it does add a lot of great texture and \nflavor to the dough. :)",

It \nstrengthens the gluten structure of the bread to hold even more bubbles. \nWhen you don't know out the air the dough walls are 'weaker'. Science! \nDough making shouldn't be difficult, thats why I love this method :), happy \nBaking :)",

When you roll it, be careful not to use too much flour. If \nit's too sticky,you can add in some flour to make it easier for rolling, \nbut brush the excess flour later. If it's brown on top but raw inside, it \nshould be that the temperature of your oven is a bit too high. Lower the \ntemperature a little bit and it should work better the next time.",
