I know it is tempting to think that \nthere are other reasons that explain everything. Don't get me wrong : there \nare other reasons (poverty, violent environment, strategies of nations, \ngreed... etc...). But Religion is also a good reason to blow yourself up in \na crowd of people. It's a very good motivation. We are tempted to think \n\"Come on ! They don't really think they are going to heaven ! They do that \nfor their country, or because they are desperate...\". \nPlease be open to the idea, that religion might be a very big problem (not \nthe only thing wrong with the world though). It is a catalyst.\nFurthermore, how can you blame people who are indoctrinated at a young age \n? People who are completely brainwashed ? I don't think your argument is \nlogical. Education goes beyond what your parents told you, what your \nteachers told you at school... Education is every encouter you have, it \ndoesn't stop after school. Education is your friends, the society you live \nin... etc... And sometimes, because of the corruption of Religion, all of \nthat is not even enough to make you understand that people who don't share \nyour religion must die. Sometimes it's the opposite.\nBeing too optimistic about religion is dangerous I think. You are wrong to \nthink that everyone is as reasonable as you.",

(Maybe I'm just \nall over youtube, getting lost with who I'm talking to.)\n\nGo ask your parents what makes them different from you.\n\nBullshit aside, they are your creators & you are their creation.\n\nThe power they used to create you is the same power used to create them, \nall the way back to the beginning.\n\nThe Power of Arche, which is Greek for First-Cause & the basis for words \nlike archetype/architect, spark...communicating the essential concept of \nwhat is interpreted as Ex-Nihilo, the foundation of Consciousness & \nThought, Judgement & Feeling, Action & Creation.\n\nWhat I can tell you, is that He (neutral-sense for now) is a Real Person \nwith a Body & Soul. He is only as Transcendent of The Universe as you & I \nare. He exists like you & I exist. He is not a blur of a concept, or an \netheral fart/blob in the wind, or a collective identity (panentheistic \nmind-trip) with a multiple personality disorder.\n\n*He exists in the Linear-Minimalist sense, which is, in perfect obedience \nto the Laws of the Universe. This is what actually makes him different from \nus.* Choosing to do doing nothing more than what he knows & feels needs to \nbe done, in order to survive, thrive, & create. If First-Life did not obey \nthe law perfectly, then logically we shouldn't & wouldn't be here, since we \nknow that a simple & small mistake/break/fall is always destructive even \nfatal...thus terminating (though not immediately) the survival & \ncontinuation of the pattern.\n\nThe Creator was not always The Creator. His creations were not always \ncreated.\n\nTherefore, First-Life, as he was before creation, was once desolate of \ncompany *& is the only one that ever knew or will know complete, perfect, & \nutter loneliness.* Everyone else had others to help them along the way. He \nis the only one to truly have no one. His experience is unique to him. It's \nwhere he gets his power.\n\nThe loneliness & suffering we have gone through & will go through, is \nmerely a reflection of what First-Life, had experienced at the beginning, \nbefore becoming The Creator.\n\nHe is a lover & creator of life. He is not the destroyer of it. He has no \nneed. The Universe will punish & damn. \n\nThe Creator's involvement in this world, if he is able & willing at all to \nbe involved, technically cannot be distinguished from the works & power of \nman....which is almost* limitless potential...limited only by The Law & how \nsensitive we are to knowing it.\n\nThe only thing that would give him distinction.... even from \"aliens\" (if \nthat becomes an issue at all, lol) would be to re-create/resurrect you, \nyour parents, your parents parents, etc...with perfect bodies (original \ngenetics) & memory, ready to teach us exactly how to survive, sustaining us \nuntil we do. \n\nThere is no other way to know if God is God except that the power that \nsustained First-Life in The Beginning is used by one who existed before & \ntherefore remembers exactly all the information that composes our \nmemory/experience so that it can be restored.\n\nAll other methods of proving one's character can be duplicated. Hence The \nDoppelganger Paradox.\n\nEveryone in this world is basically a sacrifice or a slave to whoever \npossesses the most power & influence. Cruel Might makes Right....Sophistry \nis Truth....\n\nFor example....\n\nThe Resurrection of Jesus may or may not have been real. Chances are it \nwasn't...which means the Occult Power in this world had likely brainwashed \nhim, or he had to develop a set of coping mechanisms in response to what he \ndiscovered about their existence, which he eventually shared, thus becoming \nThe Gospel.\n\nYou can't be saved except that you're being saved from something....& \n****Rome**** had hi-jacked Judaism & would later hi-jack Christianity\n\nIf it was real, then at the very least, Jesus, Son of God or not....was \nactually teaching deistic principles & praying, even unto death, that God \nintervene & save everyone from the nightmare we are all living in.\n\nOf course any of this would mean one way or the other that the biblical \naccount of his birth & things associated with astrology & \"atonement\" was \ncompletely fabricated by the conspirators in order to give people \nfalse-hope.  (basically what Jesus originally taught & warned about, was \nfought against until they realized they had to hi-jack/assimilate it in \norder to mitigate the damage)\n\nMercy, Charity, & Forgiveness by their very nature, are 100% arbitrary. \nThey are not virtues the Universe possesses, they are only virtues that you \n& I possess.\n\nIn regards to how we got here, in this hell-hole....\n\nA Deist would use pure logic & evidence, right?\n\nWell here is the logic.\n\nFor every Pattern there is an Origin, right? For every Break in that \nPattern there is a Slow-Decay/Evolution, right?\n\nHere is the timeline. \nCreator -> Pattern -> The Break -> Slow-Decay/Evolution -> Death\n\nThis is what we see with all our creations down to the individual & their \ngenetics.\n\nEvolution is Entropic & has nothing to do with God. \n\nOn a non-deistic note (though still worth analyzing): \nEvery ancient major western religion teaches about being cut-off from God \nby an 'evil stranger'.\n\nThe Babylonians, The Greeks, The Egyptians, The Jew, The Norse....& even \nsome Eastern religions.\n\nYou have probably seen some stuff about Nephilim, Aliens, \"Reptilians\" on \nyoutube by now...just be careful....The Enemy is trying to herd people into \n\"New-Age\" religions...but there is nothing \"New\" about them. It's just more \nsacrifice & slavery. It's the same template used since before The Bible \never existed.\n\nNo one knows how long we have been here on this planet, going in circles.\n\nEveryone is playing this stupid game of \"King of The Hill\" (Artificial \nHierarchy/Ponzi-Scheme).

For Deists love the \nOriginal Nature of things...both First-Life & Creator & The Laws of the \nUniverse.\n\nThere is one that we do not worship. That is Satan/Saturn/Cronos/The \nFall/Break/Destroyer & all he represents as the anti-thesis to Life, Love, \nLearning, Logic & Liberty.\n\nAlthough as a Deist I cannot say what will happen....I really do feel like \nwe're alone & that Dad isn't coming to keep The Stranger away from us...\n\nTLDR?

Life \nis distinctly different from The Universe. The Soul itself in a limited way \ntranscends The Universe...cuz we have Free-Will.\n\nIt is also an assumption on the part of some Deists to say that First-Life \ncreated anything else aside from Life....cuz that part IS superstition.\n\nMatter, Energy, The Laws....these things were not created. The power of \nWatch-Maker God is based in fantasy. Have you ever created matter, energy, \nor universal laws?\n\nThey were simply already there.\n\nDeism is more complicated than that & it is truly offensive to see other \nDeists assume Transcendentalism, Omnipotence, & Omnicience in the \ntraditional manner as Theists do. It undercuts what made concluding the \nexistence of an Original Creator, the centerpiece of Deism...\n\nWhich is quite simply, The Principle of Archetypes & Truth of the Pattern, \nwhich states: For everything we see in this world, there is a First & the \npattern continues, except that there is a Break/Fall & then that is \narchetypal as well, so the pattern will either continue or end when that \nevent happens.\n\nEverything surrounding Logic itself is the search/observation for an \narchetypal cause to the effect.\n\nHence why you hear Deists reference the Pattern of Creation as their \nevidence....or some Theists & their conclusion that there is a living \nembodiment/archetype of \"The Fall\".\n\nAgain, against the notion of this Watch-Maker God....No Deist can even know \nif God will intervene or is or already has & is no longer intervening in \nthis world.\n\nQuite frankly, to you & all everyone else (Theists included)....no one \nknows how to recognize him...\n\nSo we're dealing with The Doppelganger Paradox here.\n\nThe only \"Gods\" that were ever active in this world, are The Devil & The \nSon of The Devil....who manipulate mankind for better or worse. The roles \nof Cronos & Zeus are themselves being played as we speak by real persons.\n\nEver wonder where the phrase Evil & The Lesser of Two Evil's comes from? \nIt's based on Greek Mythos, where Cronos is The Devil who cut us all off \nfrom Ouranos The Sky-Father & Zeus is the Son of the Devil.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that Deism really doesn't start with someone elses \nsystem & it doesn't make assumptions for false-absolutes.\n\nWith that, I hope you begin holding a respect for The Original, without any \nsuperstition. If not, then at least hold other Deists accountable for their \nown absurd claims....cuz the definition you gave of Deism ISN'T DEISM & is \nwithout an understanding of why Deists do say that God isn't here....not \nthat he is absolutely without question completely inactive or apathetic.\n\nThose ideas were created through brain-storming the possibilities.\n\nJust understand that when using a \"Logic-Star\" or the Ordo-Ab-Chao method, \nthat is where people often get lost if their dedication & intelligence is \nlacking....& their thought/feeling becomes numb from exhaustion, \nfrustration, & distraction.",
