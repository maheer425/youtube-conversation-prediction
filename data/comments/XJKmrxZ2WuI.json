What they're implying by using the term tea-bagger \nto describe a movement of people who are supposedly homophobic (I'd tend to \nagree that they are homophobes) is latent homosexuality and that they suck \nballs. It's the same as libtard and conservatard. All bastardisations of \nthe proper terms that people call themselves in order to make it synonymous \nwith stupidity. There's no other reason to use the term tea-bagger other \nthan to insult and it's not common to insult women by calling them \ncocksuckers but it is common to question a man's sexuality in that way.

Bullshit... it was too corporatist. Most \nof us would celebrate populist policy whether it came from the right or the \nleft.\n\nNow back to the original comment.
