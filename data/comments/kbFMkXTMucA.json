And caterpillars from that I have seen have \nalways been solidary animals as in no cohabitation with another \ncaterpillar. So seeing caterpillars work together in such a unique way is \nfascinating",

I wonder if anyone ever did a proper study on this or if \nits a new thing they just developed lately... like those birds that in just \na couple of years developed new skills to protect their nest from the \nparasitic cuckoo birds that were laying eggs there. That's also a \nfascinating story about how under threat of extinction evolution sometimes \ndoes not wait for thousands of years and just happens in one generation. 2 \ndifferent species under threat by this phenomenon developed in just couple \nof years 2 different skills to protect from that. One specie developed a \nsong that it sings to the eggs and when they hatch only the same specie \nchicks can reproduce it so the mother only feeds the right ones, and one \nspecie changed the spot patterns on the eggs to recognize them and to push \naside the egg that does not belong to it. This just happen as researchers \nwere looking for ways to fight off the cuckoo invasion that sent on the \nendangered list several bird species.",

So if he steps on one lego, (roughly guessing) 5% of the surface \nof the bottom of his foot is on a lego, while the other is distributed on \nthe ground. You would also have to take in where the lego is under his \nfoot, as more weight is spread out at the heal than the toes. So my best \njudgement would be, if one lego were stepped on under the heal, it would \ncause moderate pain due to the thick skin, compared to if the lego was \nunder the middle of hit foot(the bridge) where the skin is thinner and more \nsensitive. While the toes would be rather unharmed. However, if he were to \nstep on legos(plural) more of the surface of his foot would be on legos, \nmeaning more weight would be placed on all of them. Yes it means the weight \ndistributes, however in both ways it distributes, one means more weight on \nground, many means more weight on legos.",
