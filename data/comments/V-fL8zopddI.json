His super breath is impossible because for him to expel \nthat much air his lungs would need to expand to a size much larger than his \nbody. The insides of his eyes likely lack the elements and a light source \nto produce lasers, his flight is impossible as well for the matter he has \nno explanation behind it I know of that can make logical sense or give us \nsome excuse why such as telekinesis or the will power of green lanterns. \nThe entire character is a mess and just dumb.

But in this case if Superman \nwere to punch The Hulk with this much force then I don't see it possible \nfor him to survive it. Hulks durability isn't anywhere near Supermans. At \nleast not right off the bat that is. Not to mention The Hulk has been shown \nto tire out and revert back to Banner.

It was later revealed that \nsuperman had turned into raw energy from the overexposure which leads into \nthe whole supermanprime 1 million story. So this demonstrates that supes \nphysical body does have limitations to the point where he literally had to \nshed his physical form to adapt to his new found power. And to be fair goku \nwas just introduced to god mode and it only lasted a few minutes before \ndissipating but left enough of it's residual energy in goku to challenge \nBeerus but not defeat him. Beerus even said at the end that goku taxed his \npower a little more than he would've liked and whis teased him about it. \nSuperman lost to a god too! Anybody remember Hades (ironically the god of \ndeath, similar to goku's loss to the god of destruction)? Hades owned the \nhell out of superman, his punches had no effect on Hades.",

I also agree with you that it would be \nincredibly dangerous to do physics experiments with the help of superman. \nHowever I think you missed a point when you talked about Superman eating \nall those Big Macs. If you read the comics or if you have any info on \nSuperman then you would have known that Superman actually do not require \nany food for his energy. Each cell in his body(in comics) is described like \na nuclear reactor and for chain reaction Superman uses Sun rays I don't \nknow specifically which rays. But yeah consistent nuclear explosions would \nbe bad for Physics experiment.",

                    "text": "Since this is the channel that digs deep into silly things, I'm gonna dig \ndeep into this (presumably) not-so-serious comment:\n\nFirst, Superman would need those billions of big-Macs to actually deliver \nthe punch, and I think buying so many big macs would not only cost very \nmuch, but also be very very hard to do. If one big mac would weigh 100 \ngrams, then you'd need ~8.2*10^9 kg of meat. According to a quick google \nsearch, all cattle combined at the moment has a biomass of 5.2*10^11kg. If \nyou'd assume you can productively use half the weight of the cow for \nburgers, you'd need 1 in every 50 cows in the WORLD, just to make the \nburgers for a single superman punch.\n\nThen also, regardless of the food you'd give superman, you'd probably kill \nloads of people in the process. Feeding superman such a huge part of the \ncurrent amount of food on this planet would surely cause the food stocks of \nbasically everywhere close to the testing site to be completely empty, \nwhich means the less wealthy probably wouldn't be able to get access to \nfood.\n\nNow, if these didn't convince you this wouldn't be a good idea even if \nsuperman were real, there's another problem. You can't study the effects of \nnuclear fission by simply detonating an atomic bomb, because the process is \nway too uncontrolled to gather any data, and any data you'd gather would be \ndestroyed immediately. You can't transfer the data to another device \neither, since the electromagnetic waves emitted by the bomb would make it \nimpossible to distinguish the signals that are being sent. The same applies \nto superman punching with this much energy: the explosion caused by it is \nway too uncontrolled to ever gather any useful data from, except for being \nable to answer the question \"when is humankind going to blow itself up\".",

But what would happen if Superman was to \npunch an ordinary person in real life?\n\nWell... as the video puts it. He'd punch the atoms out of you. We're \ntalking energy on a scale of nuclear explosions.\n\nAnd that assumes that Superman cannot punch faster than light speed. Which \nis questionable given some of the powers he's been shown to have over the \nyears.\ufeff",

So how much coin \nthrowing does this take?\nMethod 1)  Throw all 10 coins, if they dont all come up heads, then start \nagain.  Its 1 in 1024 throws x10 coins = 10240 to get all heads.  This is \nwhat you are suggesting, and it is NOT how nature works.\nMethod 2)  Throw 10 coins, keep the heads, re-throw the tails and repeat.  \nIn this method, it takes only about 19-20 throws to get 10 heads on 10 \ncoins, and this is how nature works, it keeps the successes and moves on.\n\nSo you see, with around 14 billion years and a universe to play with, the \nformation of protein is not just likely, its a certainty.",

What do people or Children do when they say if you \ndon't do this you will go to hell. People listen they follow. Hell I bet \nyou don't even know this. The Gospels were made 50 years after Jesus death \nand wanna know something else? the First Bible ever to be made was made by \nthe King who started the Crusades and by a bunch of Corrupted Churches. \nThey made the Bible, Handed it out to people, and Said \"THIS IS THE TRUTH.\" \nYou are to never use Gods name in Vein but what did people do? they said by \nthe name of God you will die. they are using his name in Vein the FIRST \nBible and the Crusades used his Name in Vein. I bet you didn't know all of \nthat did you? Even with all that I still go to church, I believe in Demons, \nghost, and God. But I am the only one who is open Minded in my church. When \nyou go to church you go there to learn about God not what Pastures think. \nWhen Pastures says. \"In the name of God I think we should do this.\" The \npasture is using gods name in Vein and is Sinning. Let me tell you this \nlike what is said. \"Beware of the Wolves Among the Sheep.\" I hope you \nlearned something and when you go to church again try listening. :p.

Only one half of his \nbody could face the sun at a time, and assuming 12 hours exposure per day, \ngives us 2.5*10^9 calories at best per year.\nAccording to some calculations the planet can produce 10.95*10^15 calories \nper year in total. The amount from the sun is negligible at this point.\nAssuming Superman had a 100% efficient metabolism, Superman punching \nsomething as hard as he could one time would consume 0.415% of all the \nenergy the sun and earth could deliver to him in total if everyone else on \nthe plant stopped eating. If he did this once a day starting Jan 1st, he \nwould starve sometime before August 30 (and everyone else would have \nstarved sometime before Martin Luther King\u2019s Day.)\ufeff",

SSJ4 Goku would kill them \nboth, dont even try to deny that.

Why exactly is the Kryptonian limited to one of his weakest \nforms? This sentence just had it implied that he isn't worth of a change or \na power boost. No please, don't do that. Gogeta loses.

It's not like Batman ever struggles with any of \nhis guys after his first encounter (sometimes not even then).  \n\nJack Kirby introducing the whole Fourth World/New Gods mythos through his \nSuperman/Jimmy Olsen series in the 70s, John Byrne's redefining of the \ncharacter in the 1980s during the Crisis on Infinite Earths era, Dan \nJurgen's main series in the 1990s (beyond just the Death/Return of \nSuperman), Grant Morrison's handling of Superman and others in the 90s \nrelaunch of JLA (still the best version of that team ever written). And \nthen the more recent stand-alone stories like Superman: Birthright, Red \nSon, All-Star Superman, Earth 2, Kingdom Come. All of these various runs \nand stand-alone short series over the years present plenty of great writing \nof the character, I think certainly equal to anything Batman's gotten - and \nmore than many other DC A-listers.",

In the case of superman not many people can make \nthat happen.

Obviously we know they're going to win in the end, \nbut with most superheroes there's a real possibility they won't for some \nreason. No one feels like that could happen with superman. If what I was \ntold in another discussion is true, he fought someone on a planet littered \nwith kryptonite and at least one red sun, managed to punch the guy clean \nthrough it, and carry on like it was nothing. Again, IF that's true, \nthere's just no way the reader/viewer can genuinely feel his life is in \ndanger.

His travel speed is unimaginably more \nfaster than his combat speed, which it more comparable to machine gun fire \nspeed. One of Superman's greatest feats and abilities is something he stole \nfrom the flash, his \"infinite mass punch\", in which he spends time, prior, \nbuilding travel momentum, until he essentially travels through you, at \nlight speed, with his fist at the front.(not saying it makes scientific \nsense, just saying what's present in the comics) I still like the video, as \nit kinda gives you an idea of what one of his more powerful techniques \nwould do to someone, but saying it's something he can to at any given \nmoment isn't accurate at all. \nBut, in the end, you're really not going to be any less dead, getting hit \nby Supe's fist, on nearly any occasion.\ufeff",

So I guess if Superman could \nVaporize everything with his heat vision if he wanted too and can destroy a \nsolor system just by sneezing. I think that sums up a lot also xD. Also I \nlove DBZ but start to hate because of the fanbase. You all say they give \nSuperman Random power ups and is OP. But all DBZ fans now treat Goku like A \nsuperman. Giving him random power ups out of nowhere just so it seems like \nhe beats Everybody Even though there are so many animes that would Destroy \nthem even with this God form. You all over exaggerate the word God and yes \nI already know the force to destory a solor system. It's 5.50x10 31 times. \nAlso if you haven't noticed Superman only used the Infinite mass Punch to \ndestroy planets and I say Supermans Punch is greater because I'm sure he \ncould charge that thing up to go Solar if he wanted too because he could \nincrease his powers with a dip because he did that punch without a inside \nsun dip charge. So a good 5 minutes inside the sun could boost that punch \ntremendously. You know how DC writers are.",

However, an alien species given special powers by solar \nexposure (Kryptonians) may, by using their knowledge of how physics can be \nmanipulated, use the laws of physics against physics themselves. For \nexample, perhaps by vibrating his body until his molecular bonds weaken as \nwell as flying full speed allows Superman to travel faster than light speed \nbecause he is essentially negating his own mass by turning his body \nslightly intangible thus negating that pesky, \"nothing with mass can go \nbeyond light speed.\"  It would also explain why it was stated in the issue \nwhere he IMP'd the Shadow Moon that he \"only works this hard when traveling \nfaster than light speed but this time he wants to stay just under.\"\n\nMaybe that's it. The elusive answer to satisfy the laws of physics are \nimmutable fans. Superman can travel up to light speed which increases his \nmass infinitely just like the scientist all say. However, when he reaches \nlight speed he goes slightly intangible which allows him to fly even faster \nbecause he's negating his own mass. Which is also why he doesn't do it \nunless he has to, it's a lot of work to get to that point because he's \ndoing two incredible things at once....\n\nI can live with that explanation. ",

Unfortunately for Flash, he is only human and \ncouldn't survive the extreme destruction of the atmosphere that he would \ncause if he went WAY over the speed of light. Superman however, when flying \nthrough space, has no limit. A simple Google search made me come across a \nforum where it was stated that the fastest Superman has ever been was going \nfrom Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy (2.5 million light-years away) in 12 \nhours. I'm quite sure that is millions, if not billions, of times faster \nthan the speed of light. So yes, in a foot race, Superman would lose. But \nif you were to give Flash and Superman somewhere in space to run where they \nwouldn't cause harm to the atmosphere, then Superman would win outright.",

This is \nmostly focused on the game \"Mortal Kombat\". There is a fatality that has me \nrather stumped. A classic Fatality from the character Sub-zero depicts him \nactually tearing another persons head off with the spine still attached.\n\nThe thing is. How much for force would it require to tear another persons \nhead off? Would it even be possible to have the spine remain intact when so \nmuch force is being applied? This is a question I think should be answered \nfor all the gaming geeks out there, like myself.\ufeff",

You see, when Sub-Zero pulls the \nhead off the opposing fighters' body, it would be moving quite fast so it \nprobably wouldn't break.\n\nIt's similiar to the tablecloth trick, where you pull the tablecloth out \nunder the dishes on top and have them remain intact. In this case, Sub-Zero \npulls the head off, leaving the body intact and dropping to the floor.",

Hmm if I wasn't dumb I'd say.. 10 x 40 = 400 tons and it was easy \nas pie in SSJ oh and in BoG when Goku punched his fist through King Kai's \nplanet is a real good measurement.. And you DC fanboys be like \"Goku can't \neven destroy King Kai's planet with his most powerful punch\" so let's do \nsome math and science.. Something you DC fanboys leave out of the \nconversation because you lack the ability to use it.. So in the Daisenzhuu \n(official written wiki for DBZ) King Kai's planet is considered to be \n2,000,000 times the density of earth meaning in order to destroy it, You \nwould have to exert 2,000,000 x 53 quadrillion MEGATONS of force.. The \nreason I say this is because it takes 53 quadrillion megatons to destroy \nearth so being 2,000,000 times denser than earth would make my equation \ncorrect.. Therefore in ssj3 goku can exert power very close to that \namount.. And LETS NOT FORGET that absorbed ALL the power that he received \nwhen he was super Saiyan God into his BASE FORM towards the end of the \nfight with Beerus.. And SsjG is hundreds of times more powerful than ssj3 \nand now goku has this power absorbed into his BASE FORM.. Thank you for \nreading and I don't want to fight im just stating the facts..

Also it is not like Goku could even hurt \nsuperman when pretty much nothing hurts him except kryptonite, and as i \nsaid before, Goku would not use that to his advantage since he wants his \nfoes at their strongest.

The flash can only move \njust a little faster than him and is only a little stronger than regular \nhumans. Superman's punch would be more powerful seeing that both of their \nspeeds are close.",

Now assuming that Cell had a Power strong enough to \ndefeat ssj1 goku without effort, we can assume that he has 60% of Cell saga \nssj1 power. Ssj1 has survived a planet explosion from freiza or something \n(needs correcting) so that means he at least can cause planet busting \npower. \n\nSo Goku can Punch planets, cool. Supes can lift 200 Petatons. So he at \nleast can destroy something like a continent and tow planets. So BUU SAGA \ngoku can inflict more damage than supes. \nBut supes would survive 10 supernovas while goku was not able to deflect 10 \nPlanet busters. So if Goku does his punches fast enough he would win, but \nIf supes hit him w/o infinity punch would take a while.\n\nNow have a nice day:)\ufeff",

In the \nrelatively newer version, he has to apply a lot of his strength to even \nstop something as heavy as a crashing aeroplane!  or in MoS, in the part \nwhere he's supporting the huge iron structure, after he rescues the workers \nfrom that oil drilling thing at sea, you can see from his facial \nexpressions that he has to exert a lot of strength to keep it from falling. \nGoku would do that without ANY effort. lol and anyways, Ssj4 Goku is strong \nenough to destroy Multiple galaxies, maybe even the universe like Ssj4 \nGogeta.\nThe older comics can't prove shit, superman is no where as strong as they \nused to show him. He doesn't have that dumb time reversal power, or that \nstupid claim that he can travel nearly as fast as light either.",

About this last thing I \ndisagree, because there are a lot of superman comics (and writers) and in \nones he's godly strong, and in others he es only very powerfull.
