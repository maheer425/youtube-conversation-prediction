I think they\u2019re debating on killing her off because \nthey didn\u2019t except people to fall in love with Emma Stone as Gwen and the \nchemistry between her and Andrew as much as we all have. And just because \nthey don\u2019t kill her that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t being faithful to the \ncomics. They aren\u2019t changing everything! I honestly hope they reconsider \nbecause i don\u2019t understand what will come out of killing Gwen. I mean yeah \nit\u2019ll be dramatic as hell and then they\u2019ll be people like me who will be \nbawling their eyes out in the movie theater. But other than being faithful \nto the comic, the general response of shock that\u2019ll definitely generate \nticket sales if she does die, and the audience outcry to a beloved \ncharacter dying that\u2019ll have people talking even more about the movie, why \ndoes she have to dieeeeee!?
