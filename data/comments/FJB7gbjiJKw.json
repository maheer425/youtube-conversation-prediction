                "text": "So tell me about light. If you hold a flashlight in front of you, slightly \npointed away, you will only see what the light hits, not the photons. Light \nits self is not visible at all, but the light source and the object that \nreflects said light is. Color as we see it is the light that did not get \nabsorbed or scattered by an object. So does this mean that everything is \nactually fluorescent in some way? Or do different spectral colors travel at \nslightly different speeds based on their wavelength. Different wavelengths \ncannot travel the same speed from the same source... can they? If so would \nthat redefine the speed of light? \ufeff",

At night, \ncity lights brighten up the sky until they sky itself is brighter than the \nstars, and so we don't see them.\n\nIt's not really because our atmosphere is scattering or blocking the light \nof the stars. If that was the case then even in dark places we wouldn't be \nable to see them. Our atmosphere does distort light entering it slightly, \nbut that happens constantly, and to the same extent extent all over the \nworld.\n\nDon't worry about your eyes either. It's a question of relative brightness, \nthere are no eyes that can pick out a dim star behind a bright sky.\n\nAlso, to comment on another topic that came up: without an atmosphere earth \nwould be like a lot like the moon. Pretty hot on the side facing the sun, \nand really cold on the side facing away. The changes would be very extreme \nbecause having an atmosphere catches light and distributes heat throughout \nthe surface of the planet. When there's no atmosphere, all of that light is \ncaught or reflected by the surface, so it will get pretty hot, pretty \nquickly. But because the surface doesn't flow and distribute that heat, the \nside facing away will remain very cold.\n\nAlso! Atmosphere or no, no matter far away you are, the sun will always \ncast light over the all of the half of a celestial body that faces it. \nImagine the light as a sphere expanding concentrically from the sun. When \nthe surface of that sphere reaches you, it will cover the entire day side \nplanet, not just a small part of it.",

However, there are some smart things you can do.\n\nTake this example, you can measure the height of a tree without using a \nruler. You just require the distance from it and the angle at which you \nneed to look up to see its top. The same works in reverse if you know its \nheight, you can measure the distance to it. This is called triangulation.\n\nThrough several similar steps (and many other), people have been able to \ndetermine an approximate radius for Earth's orbit around the sun. If you \nknow this value, and you know the angle at which you look at the star, then \nyou have the distance to it.\n\nHowever, this is accurate only up till apprx 400 light years. Further than \nthis you can use the color spectrum of the star by comparing it to the \ncolor spectrum of stars of known distances. This allows us to get its \nbrightness, which we can use to determine its distance.",

                "text": "This subject ( black holes, super novas, outer space in general...) has \nalways interested me. Not because of what we know about them, but because \nof how little we know and yet claim to have knowledge of. Its not \nscientific really, considering its all theoretical. However scientists and \ntheorists alike speak on these subjects like we've been there, and yet we \naren't even minutely close enough to them to draw any kind of reasonable \nconclusion. Its glorified guess work. And with all the math and observation \nwe have, its more like a shot in the dark. Let me put it his way (also a \nvery unscientific approach): let's say the earth was completely transparent \nfor a moment, and a hunter was able to look through its crust and core with \nan incredibly high powered scope to the other side. He would see another \ncountry, and its people going about their daily business. With no sound, \nand a poor perspective, he could make some pretty good guesses at what's \nhappening in that country only to travel there later and realize he was \ncompletely wrong about what he saw. Even though he had convinced himself \nand maybe a few others with what he saw. The difference with the hunter and \nmodern science, is that we have the luxary of not knowing for certain, and \ntherefore not really being able to be proven wrong. Scientist often (not \nnecessarily purposefully) mislead their peers because the information is \nalmost too incredible to dispute. Black holes sound like this amazing \nthing, but we have truly have little or no knowledge on them aside from \nwhat we can observe with our bare eyes. And yet for some reason, we claim \nto know all of this bizarre information based on very basic observations \nand experiments that cant be proven. Its kind of naive if you ask me. Its \nlike looking at an ant with a magnifying glass once, seeing it carry a \nlarge cracker on its back and just assuming it must be magic supporting the \ncracker. In reality, we only know what we know about the ant or any other \nanimal or thing in our earth through thorough testing and scrutinizing \nexamination. But at the same time, we blindly accept everything that is \nspoon fed to us about existence and the cosmos. Again, it contradicts the \nvery characteristics of humanity that allow us to survive.

He talks about 'apparent horizons' instead of an 'event \nhorizon' now..\nAll this could lead to two things, or Quantum mechanics are wrong (meaning \nthat information/energy can in fact 'die'), or General Relativity is wrong.\nSome other people theorize that Black Holes are a massive force that comes \nfrom another universe/dimension, therefore implying that information does \nnot die it just gets trapped into another place out of our universe, hence \nwhy Black Holes suck stuff up infinitely without losing force. The problem \nwith that hypothesis is that there's nothing to back it up, just \nphilosophy. But there's also nothing to back up Hawkings new hypothesis, he \njust says that because he defends the old idea that information can't die \n(because, in his own words \"the Strings theory proves this\").",

Over time, through quantum \ntunnelling, one of these particles will find itself outside of the black \nhole, which means that the black hole itself loses that particle's worth of \nmass. \n\nWhile the gravitational attraction of a black hole is truly immense, in the \nworld of quantum mechanics, traditional gravity doesn't \"work\". To date, \nthere is no definitive theory on how gravity works on a quantum scale. But \nquantum tunnelling is better understood in comparison.\n\nOver timescales useful to us (thousands-millions of years) this loss is \npretty much considered to be almost nothing. However, over a timespan that \nwould be difficult to imagine or comprehend, it will add up and eventually \nthe black hole will evaporate into nothing.\n\nThis is a very simple and non-technical explanation of the phenomenon.",

This hawking Radiation (Which I assume was first \ntheorized by Stephen Hawking) eats away at the black hole, to form what? \nmatter does not dissapear and energy (Or radiation) would be absorbed back \ninto the black hole no?\nWhat I'm talking about can only happen in a specific scenario where a black \nhole is large enough, and is being affected by another black hole's gravity \nwell. Essentially this Gravity well would stretch out the black hole JUST \nenough for the sphere to collapse in on itself in what could be considered \na gorgeous display. (Thought again, a theory.

In the swinging case they need to have a tremendous \nspeed and their trajectories must be parallel for that to happen. The most \nlikely thing to happen is that the event horizons will \"kiss\" and they \nspiral in each other. Without other matter in the near surroundings the \nincrease will be pretty small, but the universe isnt empty. That process \ncould double the expected increase of the black holes. All of these are \nstill theoretical, because... well, we never saw it happen and we cant \npredict how black holes act(with that I mean 100%, not 20% or 30%).",

                    "text": "+Shahlan Saleem Well, your quote of the Quran isn't quite correct. The \nexcerpt is meant to read: \"it is we who have built heaven\", not \"built the \nuniverse\" as you have quoted, therefore everything else in your point has \nno value towards that part of the discussion.\n\nGoing back to some early points made by others:\n\nWith the way the world is right now could you truly say that in the \npossibility that god exists, that he is benevolent?...I see the word evil \ntyped a few times...we are all agreed that evil exists right? Well, is god \nable to get rid of evil, or, if he is, is he willing?\nIf he is able, but not willing, he is malevolent\nIf he is not able, but willing, he is not omnipotent\nif he is able, and willing, then why is there evil?\nor, if he is neither able, nor willing, then why call him god?\n\nI also see faith described above by several people, so I bring you a quote \nby AronRa\n\"We either base our 'confidence' on reason (evident probabilities, past \nexperience, competence, etc) or we base our beliefs on faith, which is \nblind by definition. Faith is the most dishonest position it is possible to \nhave, because it is an assertion of stoic conviction that is assumed \nwithout reason and defended against all reason. If you have to believe it \non faith, you have no reason to believe it at all.\"\n\nAlso, above you quoted the bible, saying that it was evidence for humans \nnot being animals. When, in fact, the bible is evidence for nothing apart \nfrom the fact that a few people from the 1100's were literate.  Because, \nthat's exactly what it is.  It is a story written in the 12th century of \nsupposed events that happened over a millenia before. Also,you were quoting \nthe bible about the beginning, which is what, supposedly 6000 years ago? \nYou can't believe that to be true, being written 5000 years after the \n'fact'. We are closer to the time in which the bible was written than they \nare to the events they are writing about! Surely, it's obvious that the \nbible cannot be used as harbingers of fact--more so, neither can any other \nreligious writings such as your Quran, or the Jews' Torah, because that's \nall any of them are. They are stories written by people many years after \nthe events written about.\n\nAlso, I want to tell you that if anyone talks to you as though they are \nbetter simply because they don't believe in \"fairy tales\" (sorry).  Most \natheists are not bigoted towards religious people--being good is not \ninherent to religion.  Morals come from basic empathy, which stems from \nhuman interaction. So don't believe at all that without god we are without \ngood.  Likewise, I stress, very firmly, that anyone who reads this that is \nreligious: Don't be bigoted towards anyone due to ANYTHING, including their \nreligion, or lack thereof, because, truly, doesn't the bible preach more \nthan anything to simply be a good person?",

From a moral \nperspective, a person who punishes entire populations based on the mistakes \nof a few is considered evil. If we apply the same moral to divine beings \nthe god you speak so fondly of is evil. He is a god who deliberately \ncreates temptations to see if we fall for them, and punishes us if we end \nup falling for them. \n\nWho created God? Where does his powers come from? Etc.\n\nOf course you can't prove anything while discussing things related to \ndivine beings, sicne it is all theories. However science is based on \n\"proof\" which is in turn based on other observations we have made. Religion \nhave a nunber of texts which serve as base for their entire theory. If we \nmeasure the detail of the proofs and the amount of them Religion is at a \ndisadvantage. Nothing new there.\n\nBut enough of this. You can belive in whatever you want.

I can't even imagine living in the \ncity, I would be calling the police because I couldn't see the glowing \nclouds in the sky hahaha. \nBut seriously, take the time out to visit somewhere away from city/town \nlights and enjoy the view! And here's a tip, take a pair of binoculars(that \nhave at least 50mm lenses) and scan the sky, you'll see lots of amazing \nthings! \n:)\n\nEDIT: If you do decide to go out for a look, make sure you go when there's \na new moon (no moon in the sky), a full moon makes the sky look as though \nyou're in the city no matter where you are.",
