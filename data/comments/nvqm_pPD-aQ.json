We already \nknow nothing is off-limits in war, as from the nagasaki and hiroshima \nbombings, corrupt pollitical genocide and biological weapons. It stands to \nreason that a nuclear war could be very realistic in the future. We almost \nhad one back in the 60's during the cuban missile crisis, and the only \nreason Russia hasn't nuked america in he past was because the commanding \nsoviet officer was patient enough to wait. Luckily, it was a false alarm.\nI suspect American leaders would'nt hesitate to to return fire based on the \n'mutually assured destruction' agreement between nuclear superpowers. If \nthis accident had been the other way around, im sure there would be a lot \nless people around today.\nAfter a global catastrophy like this (most of the world will probably \nbecome involved in such a war, and being humans, we don't know when to \nstop) governments would collapse. looting, killings and the rise of new \nleaders would occur. We all criticize governments, but without them our \nsocieties would be defunct. No rescue services, medical centres, no \nsupermarkets.\nWe have become dependant on our current state of living, especially in \nfirst world countries. Without a large supply of ready-made food we would \nnot cope. Humanity would be the first species to 'eat eachother'.\nGranted all those ghouls and giant mutated monsters wouldn't happen, a \npost-apocolyptic scenario could almost definately occur after our already \ndwindling supplies run out.",

When it mentions \n\"two hundred years ago\", you usually have some idea of what's going on.\n\nFor me, that's why Fallout trumps Elder Scrolls in terms of lore. I mean, I \nlove TES, for sure, but when it mentions \"Two Eras ago,\" I can't completely \nwrap my head around it, since \"eras\" in TES depend on major events, rather \nthan set periods of time.

Or should I rather go to the \nnearest zoo and start making secret handshakes with the monkeys there, \nwhich we have no proof of ever changing (with the exception of 2 types of \nmonkeys breeding and making a mix of the 2 which is not evolution) as he \nmight one day become my Great times 2000 Grandson? You claim the earths is \nbillions of years old, and (not all of you believe this, I am sure of it) \nthat the earth has been destroyed on I believe 4 occasions? And life has by \nsome small chance only sprung up again on earth and no where else yet know \nto us FOUR TIMES!? by that much time, the earth as it is slowly losing \nrotating speed, would have just stopped spinning a loooooong time ago, and \nour moon with is moving a few centimeters away from the earth every year \nwould not be visible from earth any more, as it should be 37,800,000,000 CM \naway from the earth, and that is only 1 billion of years for you... Imagine \nyour theory of hundreds of billions of years ago... Unless Mars and Venus \nwere once Earth's moons... Then I would be mistaken!",

However, technology was more \nadvanced than ours in some aspects. They had lasers and power armor but \nnever quite got round to miniaturizing computers which is why they're so \nbulky and large.\n\nThe cars are the way they are because America had kept them that way since \nthe 50's and eventually, they used fission cars which, I think, runs off of \natomic energy. They were so good that they really never saw a reason to \nchange them. Jet propulsion was also discovered but many civilian airliners \nstill used propellers.\n\nConsider it an alternative universe, completely different from our own but \ncarries similar laws in terms of science, language, humanity etc. Remember, \nthis is the Fallout universe and has nothing to do with our own. It just so \nhappens that their President(s) (Nixon for example) were the same as ours!\n\nYou should read about the Divergence on the Fallout wiki which is where I \ngot most of my information from. I'll quickly try to explain what the \nDivergence is as simply as I can. - Basically, our universe in real-life \nand the Fallout universe were exactly the same up until just after World \nWar II where we kind of 'split' and developed different technology. Our \nuniverse (real-life) focused on computer technology and in the Fallout \nuniverse, they focused on nuclear energy and making it apart of their daily \nlives - something we haven't done quite yet. \n\nHere's a link for you: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Divergence\n\nUltimately, in regards to your question, I think that the 50's were \nconsidered the best time for America and had a feel-good vibe to it which \nmade the Americans (in the Fallout universe!) keep that style up until 2077 \nwhen the Great War occurred.

PEOPLE ARE IGNORING WHAT I LIKE!!!! :( NOW I HAVE TO SHUN \nTHEM! NYEEEESSS THAT'LL SHOW THEM MY GAME IS KEWL!\" You therefore think \nbecause you like something older then it's better and so are you. That's \nnot how the world works..things get better as time progresses.\n\nWhat I mean, for example: Say I have a bagel 200 years ago. It's probably \ngoing to not be as sanitary as a bagel now.. Now a closer example, Play \nFarCry 2, play FarCry 3. FarCry 3 is better than 2. It's more intriguing, \nanimals are dynamic, the story is better as is the gameplay.

We're finding \nit quicker than we can use it and we are becoming more efficient with it. \nOur oil reserves are increasing every year. Even with oil consumption \nbiotech companies have developed bacteria that eats sugar and excretes oil. \nI'm a physics major and the tech on clean energy is improving greatly. The \nworld isn't as bad as it looks. Now I know that there are bad things \nhappening but life generally improves each year. Increased media exposure \nhas seen a general reduction in crime yet the average person thinks we're \nliving in a more violent world because violent acts are more efficiently \ncovered. The cost of daily living is generally increasing. Prices have \nincreased but if you look at the amount of hours needed to work for food \netc it has greatly dropped. People complain more now because they have the \ntime to sit around and think about stuff. Knowledge thanks to the internet \nis easier to access. psychology studies are showing that after earning over \na certain amount happiness decreases. The more technologically advanced and \nknowledge a civilization gets the kinder it generally gets. We live in an \nexciting world were the average person has more freedom and power than \never. it's not perfect by far but life in general is improving. You have \nmore power now than if you were born at any point in history to make a \ndifference. 30 years ago would you have so easily been able to express \nyourself to others all over the world as easily as this?? I think not. As \nfor the food people in history worried about harsh winters and people \nstaved when we didn't get a good crop. Again it isn't perfect and there are \nstill people starving now but not as much. Life expectancy in general is \nincreasing. ",

I'll give u an interesting list: The most powerful nation \nin the World (chosen by the population and military budget they receive)\n1. US\n2. China\n3. Russia\n4. North Korea\n5. South Korea \nLet's say US gets into a war with any of those countries. That means US is \ndeclaring war at all four countries as China, Russia and North Korea is \ngetting closer.(I'll count in SK too, as SK is starting to 'ditch' US, and \nfriend with China. The majority party of SK openly claims there favor of \nChina over US) Therefore, if US declares war into any of those countries it \nmeans:\nUS declares war = Economic Depression, and possibly be taken over by China \nor Russia). So how did this happen?, Wasn't US the strongest country that \ncan never be defeated?, as I said that's because of arrogance. US has been \narrogant and hid themselves in a delusion  that makes people think they \nhave done no wrong. Such arrogance blinded US of increasing power and \nhatred of 2nd world country. I'll give u an example. Many americans, who \nthink US can win in US vs China war, believe that although China has more \npopulation US has more tech. That is an utterly rubbish, and pure \narrogance. We've seen that China has equal or sometimes superior technology \nthan we do. Such as air force, when China showed their stealth bomber that \nwas exactly same to US air forces stealth bomber which was the same Jet US \nboosted around for years claiming that no other country on earth has such \nJet. \nAlso do you know China actually developed the stealth field as fallout \npredicted?, It was reveled few days ago,  although it is in prototype and \nright now, it can only cloak size of cats or dogs. Now what does US have \nagainst this?, Oh wait, it was only few months ago when Britain-US \nscientists learned that Stealth field was even possible. \nI hope you understand what I mean, arrogance of citizens = Fall of nation",

Real sci-fi sounding shit, right?) to \nbreak down any and all garbage into what's basically natural gas. Imagine a \nchamber that does what earth takes millions of years to do.\n\nLast but not least, we're also finding ways to speed up the half-life of \nnuclear waste to bring it to lead far faster. And there's plenty of uses \nfor lead.\n\nMy best guess is that we'll use Fusion to power our cities and \ninfastructure, cars will become a mix of clean-burning, trash-made natural \ngas and electric powered cars (A La Tesla Motors), and Dubai will have some \nserious fucking problems.",

Anything not directly \nincinerated was irradiated, and that kills the shit out of bugs and \nmicro-organisms, which prevents spoiling.\n\nLet me put it this way. Ever hear of Chernobyl? It's a real-life Soviet \nNuclear plant that had a melt down like 20 years ago. Nothing out-right \nexploded Micheal Bay style, but a huge area around the plant was lethally \nirradiated, forcing a permanent evacuation. What's interesting, and leading \nback to my point and your question, is that the leaves that are on the \nground NOW, are from *20* years ago! They never bio-degraded because \nthere's no micro-organisms to eat away at them. So if a non-explosive \namount of radiation can keep leaves from bio-degrading for a few decades, \nit's not a huge stretch to think that a few dozen-thousand nuclear bombs \ncould keep food microbe-free for a couple centuries.\n\nThis is why you also get irradiated when you eat the food.",

This war began when the \nMiddle East increased oil prices. Europe responded by invading the Middle \nEast militarily. Eventually the UN disbanded. The US sent forces to Alaska \nto protect their oil. Tensions between the US and Canada rose as the US \ncontinually attempted to pressure Canada in allowing the US military to use \ntheir resources and airspace. China invades Alaska. Eventually, Canada \nbacked down to the US pressure, allowing the US to use their land and \nairspace to move troops. Over time, the US begins depleting Canada's \nresources, which leads to protests and resistance from Canadians. After an \nattempt to sabotage the Alaskan Pipeline by Canadian resistance groups, the \nUS had all the justification to annex Canada.\n\nIt wasn't about gaining land to gain land (imperialism/ expansionism), it \nwasn't about keeping or losing allies, it was about protecting the oil, \nwhich in the end was a futile mission anyway. By the time the US forces \nreclaimed Alaska, there was hardly any oil left, and within a year, the \nGreat War happened.\n\nIn one of your previous comments, you had said that Canada would have \ndeclared war on China for invading Alaska. Why would they ever do that? \nAlaska US territory and Canada would have no right or justification for \ndeclaring war on them, not to mention the fact that China would easily \ndefeat Canada militarily. Canada was trying to stay out of the conflict \naltogether.\n\nIn conclusion, please learn the stuff you're trying to discuss, and also \nlearn what a period is.",
