BUT!\nI am pretty damn liberal and I simply cannot see how it's any business of \nthe government what people do on private property.\n\nA restaurant is not a public area like a library is, where everyone has a \nright to be. A restaurant is privately owned, so if the owner wants to make \na non-smoking restaurant, no one has ever prevented him from doing that.\nThe owner can kick you out if he doesn't like you, if he finds you ugly, if \nhe has a dress code or whatever.. You do not have a right to be there. It's \na privilege that the owner can take away whenever he feels like it. It is \nprivate property that he allows you to use. He should be the one deciding \nsmoking rules on his own property.\nIf people don't like it, they can go elsewhere. Just like the people who \nfind his dress code idiotic.\n\nPeople need to get rid of the entitled attitude. Entering a bar, a \nrestaurant, a club, a bookstore etc. etc. is not a right. It is a \nprivilege. If you don't like it, gtfo. \nSmoking rules on private property is none of the government's business. \nPeriod.\ufeff",

What I found especially \ninteresting is, I had no problem smoking in the clubs in Korea because the \nair conditioner/circulation whatever was that good, you could barely smell \nthe smoke and you could breathe perfectly. Another good idea from Korea is, \nwhen you go to smoker sections in public places like restaurants, cafes, \nclubs etc. they always put a tiny wet piece of paper in the ashtray so the \ncigarette will not burn any further so it won't burn any other cigs in \nthere (filter or some leftover tobacco) and won't cause that ugly smell. I \nthink this should be like that everywhere. Or making smoker sections \n(fumoirs) so it won't disturb other people.",

In fact only half \nof people who smoke get any type of disease from it (10% or less get \ncancer) and half of those dont die from that disease.  Half of those who DO \ndie from smoking die OVER the age of 75, so its meaningless because thats \nabout the time people die anyway, average life expectancy is around 78-80.  \n\nIts also important to note that about half of the population gets the same \ndiseases at some point in their lives, smokers or not.  So its unclear \nexactly what caused it, but since there has been shown a correlation \nbetween smoking and these diseases they just go ahead and chalk it up to \nthe smoking, when it could have been something else because these are \ncommon diseases like heart disease and other repository diseases, strokes, \netc.  \n\nSo even if we assume that all smokers got these very common diseases from \nsmoking alone, then only 12.5% of smokers die from smoking under the age of \n75, meaning only 12.5% of smokers die early from smoking.  \n\nThats literally the worst thing you can say, as its very possible its less \nthan that because many of these same people would have gotten these same \ndiseases anyway.

Smoking is more dangerous \nbecause it affects other's people health around you while drinking only \naffects the person drinking. This is a small snip-it of statistics from the \nCDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; government site) Cigarette \nsmoking causes about one of every five deaths in the United States each \nyear. Cigarette smoking is estimated to cause the following:\nMore than 480,000 deaths annually (including deaths from secondhand smoke)\n278,544 deaths annually among men (including deaths from secondhand smoke)\n201,773 deaths annually among women (including deaths from secondhand \nsmoke) source: \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/\n \n I recommend to read the facts.

My bad?\n\nI'm a (rather unabashed) smoker. I swear, I must have born to be one, \nbecause since I was a little girl, I remember thinking that cigarettes \nsmelled great. I quit for two years before resuming the habit. During that \ntime period, my nose became far more sensitive, and the smell of cigarette \nsmoke was truly foul. Having been on both sides now (twice), my opinion on \nthis has always remained the same: It's private property, so let the \nbusiness owners decide. Then I can decide whether or not I frequent them.\n\nThat said, having been a smoker, even when I quit for two years, I'd still \nlet people smoke in my car, my home etc. I never wanted to be that person \nthat criticized or passed judgment, because the stigma around smoking is \nexhausting, misguidedly encouraged and hypocritical as hell.\n\nI've been told off for smoking by fat people, by alcoholics, by people who \nhave bad hygiene, etc. From a smoker's perspective, there's an underlying \nirony that non-smokers typically cannot see: If you're overweight, why are \nyou lecturing me on health issues? If you're an alcoholic, should you \nreally be one to criticize \"poisoning\" myself and/or those surrounding me? \nIf you have bad hygiene, can you really complain about how I smell? The \n\"overweight and lecturing\" one particularly bothers me, mostly due to its \nsaturation and apparent separation from the issue of smoking. If you tell \nme I smell bad, I'm going to tell you that you look bad and assume that we \nwere both pointing out the obvious. Maybe next time they'll think before \nthey speak to a stranger.\n\nBesides, if it's two in the morning and I'm at IHOP, I'm assuming that \neveryone there (including staff) is a.) unconcerned about their \nhealth/diet, b.) drunk, and c.) likely smells pretty poorly. Let me smoke \nmy god damned cigarette, please; we've all given up on ourselves around \nhere.\ufeff",
