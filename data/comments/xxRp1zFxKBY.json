People can \n\"build their own cars\" and have them registered and inspected, but people \nrarely do that.\nWhat they do is take an existing VIN (serial number for a car basically) \nthat is registered with the state and they attached it to a car that they \nbuild and then they can get plates by claiming it is the stock vehicle that \nthe state thinks that it is.    In most cases what they just did is \ntechnically illegal, but often is not enforced.  Again, it can depend on \nthe state that they do it in.  Some states care more than others.",

The only thing there is to go on is that it is a Reo engine \nbuilt for the White motor division from a '51-52 White water truck. Another \nthing is that Diamond REO part, the companies didn't merge until way later \nin the '60's I believe but that's not really an issue though because the \nplate on the side says it's an REO built for White. If the engine had been \nrebuilt it would be understandable (almost) but they said it had never been \ncracked open. It's frustrating because I like the car too and I really want \nto know more about the engine... Whatever it is, I like it too, seems like \nit would be a real beast.",

I don't know where \nthey came up with Diamond REO because like you said, they had not merged \nyet so who knows... Here's a link to the engine I was talking about that \nlooks like this one. It's an REO 331 Gold Comet, it only puts out 128 hp, \nhave no clue about the torque but I'm sure it's not 1600 fp...\nhttp://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1952-reo-f-22-dump-truck-i-can-dig-it/\n \nNow he also mentions that the car only did around 45 mph which would make \nsense because if you put an engine like that in a truck, you're gonna have \nto have some insanely low gears just to get it moving and I may be wrong \nbut I don't think they would ever be able to use 1:1 ratio because of the \nhp, there's just not enough power there for a truck so based on what he \nsaid about the donor truck and it not going over 45 mph and the engine \nnever being opened, I think it's pretty safe to say that the numbers are \nmost definitely wrong and that we can officially call BS on this one.",

                    "text": "Hmmm. I think this guy did in fact butcher the numbers. Possibly to get the \ngear heads interested in it. If there is anything I have learned, it is \nthat most things on the internet tend to be incorrect. If the best diesel \ntruck engine you can buy for a Ford 450 now generates somewhere along \n700-800 Ft Pnds of Torque. Only because of the extreme technology behind \nit... Well anyways: If the Military has these M1 Abrahms tanks that can \nmove at 42 MPH carrying 62 tons... ... Nevermind, pretty useless. Ok! Here \nis what I found off of the internet. How much power does it take to move a \nfully loaded semi and trailer? A Detroit Diesel DD15 14.8-liter inline \nsix-cylinder engine weighs 2880 pounds, or 345 pounds more than a Mini \nCooper. This colossal powerplant makes up to 560 hp and 1850 lb-ft of \ntorque, and at just 1200 rpm the engine produces more than 1500 lb-ft of \ntorque.\nMost turbocharged diesel engines put out between 1200 and 2050 lb-ft to \nkeep all that weight moving. 950-2100ft/lb. in stock form. They can be \nturned up or tuned for more power. A C15 Cat is rated up to 625 Hp and 2050 \nTq. It is a 928ci motor and weighs 3090lbs. It depends on the motor (Cat, \nCummins, Detroit). There are many different displacements available as well \nas horsepower ratings (the higher the HP the higher the TQ). Many of the \ntrucks run a 450-575hp rating, depending on type of truck and what it is \nbeing used for.\n\nSo these engines that put out that kind of Torque weigh a LOT. Let's check \nTractor Engines.\n\nHere is something interesting and truthful I encountered. \n\nLike we say in the car business, torque wins races, HP sells cars.\n\nI would like to add something that my teacher taught me. \"Torque gets you \ngoing, RPM keeps you going\"\n\nHere is something interesting I found. Perhaps it is based off of After \ngear reductions... (30,000 Ft Lbs of Torque!) \nhttp://tractors.findthebest.com/l/570/Landini-Rex-110\nApparently it has 15 different Forward gears.... So, in my opinion... 1 \nGear Ratio, 1 other Gear Ratio, then a Stable Rear Diff. Ratio. \n The best I could come up with through simple mathematics is 31x31x31 To \nincrease 1 Ft Pound of Torque to about 30,000. Let's see here... Hmmm... \nLet's say this tractor started off with 300 Ft Pounds of Torque. Some what \nreasonable. Based off of the comparative size of the driver to the Tractor \nin the given picture. So, in order for us to turn 300 Ft Pound of Torque \ninto 30,000 Ft Pnds, we need to increase it by 100. Let's call the rear \nDiff a simple 4 to one Rear Diff for the sake of this being easy. so, \n100/4=20 Let's say that the 3 speeds (LL, LH, HH: Low Low, Low High, High \nHigh) are 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. So, 20/3=6.66 Which mean that the \nfive primary gears need to have first gear to be a 6.66 :1 gear Ratio. \nHmmm... \n\nShall we chalk this one up to a simple: This thing was never dynoed \nproperly?",

REO also built trucks for the military so \nthere may be some information floating around out there but I don't know \nhow it could be found considering the only thing ''known'' about it is that \nit's a gasoline inline six with a shitload of torque... Basically the only \nI've learned from all of this is that REO was founded by Ransom E.

I can imagine that if it has that much \ntorque and that mileage, the connecting rods must be about 10 ft long with \nabout a 2 ft stroke, well, maybe not quite that extreme but I'm sure it has \nsome pretty damn long arms and one hell of a stroke to produce that much \ntorque and not be completely worn out at 1 million miles. I've seen Volvo's \nwith a million miles on the odometer and their engines probably aren't even \nhalf as beefy as this one is. The thing that really surprises me though is \nthat it isn't a diesel, for some reason I could just imagine smelling raw \ndiesel pouring out of the exhaust and covering the entire car and the \ndriver with diesel and soot whilst leaving an oil slick behind it the whole \ntime I was watching this.

This guy \nis also talking out his ass. Diamond T and Reo didn't combine till 1967 \n(White bought and combined). Diamond REO had nothing but diesels, Cummins \nor Detroit Diesel. The engine does appears to be a REO Gold Comet. Which \nwas a L-6. 331 ci is correct but,1600lb.ft isn't. It might have produced \n280hp but, I doubt it. Probably more like 170ish hp and 250ish ft. lbs. No \ngasser of the time produced those numbers unless it was three times that \nsize. ",

                    "text": "+Ben Kerchner You are wrong and I don't think you know what an exhaust \nmanifold is. At 1:56 is the exhaust side, you will count 6 exhaust runners \nconnecting the head to the downpipe, which connects to the 6 individual \nchrome exhaust tips. That part which does all the connecting is an exhaust \nmanifold. At 4:42 is the intake side, you will find there is not a manifold \nconnecting the head to the exhaust tips in any way. In the same location on \nthis side of the engine, you will see the 6 gray plug wires going to the \nhead where there must then be 6 spark plugs, and the other kind of manifold \nknown as an intake manifold to which the carb is mounted. The \"exhaust \nmanifold\" you're referring to on this side is actually just exhaust tips, \nprobably welded on for show, or connected to the other side with a plenum \nbox of some kind underneath.\n\n   This is an engine with one bank if cylinders, see how it's a straight \nline, not a \"V\"?  Since there are 6 exhaust runners on the exhaust side, \nand 6 plugs on the intake side, we can assume it is a inline or straight 6. \nBut if that's too complex for you, count the wires on the distributor at \n2:20 you will find there are 7. 1 for each cylinder and 1 for the coil. \nThis is absolutely a straight six. I'm not sure why you would think this is \na V10...V10s have two banks of cylinders and two heads. There is nothing \nthat would suggest that statement is true, even in the eyes of a novice car \nguy. I can seen how a novice would think this is a v12 maybe because there \nare 12 exhaust tips...but it's neither.\n\n  And there are many manufacturers of inline sixes that produce more torque \nthan this thing even does. Including Mac, Cummins, and International to \nname a few. They are the best engine for pulling due to their torque \npotential and their perfectly balanced crankshafts. I am a diesel \nserviceman, I know what I'm looking at.\n\n   Ever seen a V10 with one bank of cylinders, 7 wires going off the \ndistributor, 6 exhaust ports on one side of the single head, and 6 spark \nplugs? Me neither, class dismissed.  ",
