'Bad' words \nare considered bad in several ways from 'it shows a lack of intelligence' \nto 'it's the devil speaking through you' as a way to try and tone down the \nrebellious nature of most of us. There seems to be a lot of correlation \nbetween 'bad' words and certain behaviors, but the presence of that \ncorrelation does not guarantee the causation of it.\n\nThis is a bit of a rant, so I am sorry to anyone reading it, if you don't \nwish to, feel free to slip on by. There are facts that both malevolent and \nbenevolent people use 'bad' words, that they are often used in times of \nstress, or used to degrade others. The idea that words themselves are 'bad' \nseem to be a loose argument at best, considering that any combination of \nwords, profane or otherwise has the capacity to hinder or help others \nregardless of its standing as 'bad' or 'good'. Calling someone ignorant can \nhave the same effects to some as calling others s#!*heads.\n\nThen again, sometimes, people get offended just to gain the attention that \nit implies.",
