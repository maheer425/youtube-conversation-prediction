They are literally trapped in the wrong body and have to live a \nfake life until they come out and transition. Both intersexual and \ntransgender bodies present a physical \"difference\" only, not mental in the \nslightest (\"difference\" being quoted bc society deems it as \"not normal\"). \nIf transgenderism was a mental birth defect, then it would be suitable to \nattempt to change the mind instead of the body (which is what society / \ndoctors used to do ignorantly before being educated). That's why \ntransgender people change bodies, not brains/minds. Brain scans reveal a \ntransgender person's brain to be the opposite gender of their assigned sex \n(\"trans\" meaning the gender and the sex being \"across from each other\"). \nYou are right in that gay / les / bi / pan / asexuality are brain-oriented \nor mental ways of being, all of which are congenital as well.",
