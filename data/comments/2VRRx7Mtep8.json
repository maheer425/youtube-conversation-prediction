                "text": "Let me give you an example of something that might start off with simple \nstress.\nAnd all small things might seem trivial and manageable at first becomes a \nlifes worst burdain.\n\nAs a person who has carried the weight of an endless amount of stress and \nmy surrounding not understanding my situation. (before the depression) I \nhave carried with me the \"black dog\" with me from as long as i can \nremember. It started with the ritual bullying from the age of 6-8. Onto \nbecoming more aware of my own situation in teens and my \"friends\" dropping \nme due to social status. At the age of 12 I started to think I was not \nallowed to sob or cry. I days consisted of waking up, going to school and \nface bullying alone, coming home in a situation where we where struck by a \nlot of cancer in the family and feeling alone there with no one to talk to \nbecause my friends already left me.\n\nI burried my emotions to the points I only felt stress and anger. No more \nways to get happy, no more ways to get sad. I forgot to mention my school \nrefused to do a dyslexion test and i was send to the lowest highschool \nlevel while right now if i do an IQ test I score just into the gifted area. \nI spend my life on highschool not doing a single thing but dealing with \nbullying and not even having to study. At the age of 18 at my college I \nstarted to feel the presure... i just could not study anymore I could not \nkeep my mind focussed at all. Things went downwards and downwards. Within \nthe year the college, my family and and social workers of my college send \nme home to get help.\n\nSo I got help, people tried to give me help making me see I was sick. But \nat this point I was so far in denial that the only problem I could see was \nan overdoses of stress. I dived into online gaming and met a wonderful girl \nwho lives on the other side of the world. She has her own deal of problems \nsure. But for the first time in my live, i felt some one understood me. At \nthis time my official help gave me medication. That medication was supposed \nto be without side effects. It mind numbed me, I did not even see it... 1,5 \nyears later I look in the mirror I see myself extremely fat (i used to be \nnormal posture). I browse the web and apparently this medication in some \ncases causes extreme weight gain. I now several years later managed to get \na part of my life on my tracks. My best friend from across the world \nmanaged to regain me my emotions, yet the drawback.... i fallen in love \nwith her. Now I have to get out of the cycle of hating myself for standing \nstill, hating myself for being outcasted while i was young by people around \nme, and hating myself for the way I look. Doing anything does indeed take a \ngreat deal of strength.\n\nThe only joy I find in life right now is my love for my friend, but she \ncannot/will not return it because of her own situation making it more then \njust difficult. So my only joy becomes a frustration. I try to help myself \nand let myself be helped. But my black dog has grown not into the average \ndog size its a full car sized dog and fighting it takes its toll to the \npoint i sometimes just fall back.\n\n!! The point I try to make with this story. !!\nIf you are/or know a person who seems fine, it might be your kid your \nhusband or wife or your friend. But you notice they start acting slightly \ndifferent. It might be because they try to shoulder more then they can \ncarry. They might seem fine for now and  i agree i was extremely \nindependent before this happend. But if you do not stop and ask yourself if \nthat simple stress isnt more then just a bad day. You might end up where I \nam fighting a battle (practically what feels like alone) against a problem \nthat might have been kept in control if some one or I would just have seen \nit faster.\ufeff",
