Liam was probably talking about \nhow the family stuck together and said they wouldn't continue the show \nwithout Phil but he didn't specify and it was bad timing and Tyler was just \ntrying to stick up for something he believes and he didn't deserve the \nbacklash he got for questioning Liam's tweet.

Liam went and had a big tantrum \non twitter about how he gets treated unfairly because he's famous and blah \nblah blah, while Tyler was tweeting about The Trevor Project and trying to \ngive some insight about the organization.
