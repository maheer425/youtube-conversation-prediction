                "text": "Team Cat Mojo working here - I have taken care of a feral cat colony for \nmore than a decade. I started with 42 cats in the colony. I tamed them and \nfound many new homes. I have 22 left in the colony and they are all safe \nnow from getting hit by cars etc. due to my building them a shelter with \ntheir own little house in my yard.\n\nWith some help from other local rescue groups I was able to get all of them \nspayed or neutered so no more kittens. I often wonder when doing an \nadoption if the people adopting realize their cats entire story and that he \nor she started out completely feral. I pay for all their food each week \nmyself and have a great vet that lets me make payments so I don't go broke \nfor regular vet care or emergencies.\n\nI do plan on keeping a few of them and those few are not up for adoption. I \nwill be both happy and sad on the day when I have just those few left.\n\n- Heidi\ufeff",

At one point \nwe were up to 19 cats, now down to 11. Just the feeding takes so much \nmoney. We've built shelters and cat houses (thank goodness for the Habitat \nRestore having cheap plywood pieces). When one gets hurt, we go to the vet. \nI wish one of the vets around here would let me make payments but none of \nthem seem to worry much about the animals, just their money. The vet I go \nto most often does try to keep the costs down but there is nothing free. I \nunderstand they're in business but jeez, their prices are astronomical! The \nnearest Humane Society hospital is 1 1/2 hours from here. But, that's the \nprice of caring for them - I would gladly go hungry if it meant my kitties \nwere medically taken care of! Once you've snuggled with a cat, had it press \nup to you and purr, curl up in your arms, if you've got a heart, you're \nhooked!",

But our girl has \nparadentosis and when we got her, she had a severe mouth infection as well. \nShe went to surgery a couple of times, got a lot of her teeth removed and \nthen we gave her antibiotics and pain relief for a few weeks. Our vet \ndescribed it as we worst case she's ever seen with bacteria eathing so much \nof her gums, her teeth were loose and there was even dead tissue in her \nmouth from years of suffering. Today she is still having the aggressive \nillness, but we are controlling it. We go for regular check-ups and at the \nvets hospital. She has started to eat a lot more, groom herself again and \nshe's much more playful and happy. If we didn't take her, she would've \nprobably been euthanized because her mouth and teeth would be in such an \nawful shape.

You did it again!\nIt's funny how Link starts to purr when my parents dog comes to visit :3 \nPyry was the first animal he met after I adopted him and I think he likes \nPyry (who is a westie) because he is calm and likes to sleep next to Link. \nPyry is used to cats because we had one when we adopted Pyry 10 years ago \nand Link is just like that cat :)",

I know lots of people think it's radical or \nunreasonable to outright hate religion, but I tried for so long to justify \nit and the more I saw, the more I just shook my head. To me, I wanna look \nat it in a factual way. Countries that have lots of religion and in \nparticular the abrahamic ones have a lot more violence, zealots and \nreligious based hatred for others. They all teach acceptance of others and \ndo unto others as you would have done unto you, but not one of them follows \nit, especially not to the letter. I think humans are too biased and well, \nnot evolved enough in that way to follow it. I'll be the first to say I \ncan't help feeling uncomfortable around certain people because only two or \nthree of that race or religion acted out in a terrible way.

Personally, I find most religions if not all about selfishness \nand cruelty. And like you said, not all of them do that, but it's too \ncommon to simply be a coincidence or say that it's the individual, not the \nreligion. It often is the religion and in particular the Abrahamic \n(Judaism, Christianity and Islamic) seem to have the worst zealots and \ncruelties among them. To me I think religion is a mental illness, something \nthat anyone can \"contract\" because our brains have a particular part that \nseems to deal with what we perceive as  supernatural. I also have come to a \npoint where I don't think anything can be just personal to that persons \nlife. What we believe in seems to affect how we react and treat anything \nand everything else in our lives. Which is why I'm personally against \nreligion.\nOn a happier note, my boyfriend and I are definitely getting a cat and a \ndog when we move to a place more suited to it )",

It is better to keep a vet slush fund if you have \nmore than one cat imho. If you've had cats in the past, add up what you \nspent on vets over their lifetime, divide that by the number of years they \nlived, add some on for inflation, then you have a rough figure of what vet \nbills are likely to be. Take the monthly insurance payment, work out what \nyou'd pay over a year, then work out the cheapest option. But remember that \nsome circumstances, like being hit by a car, will involve abnormally high \nbills.
