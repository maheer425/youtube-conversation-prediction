Basically it's the reverse of the product rule. \n\nThink about the product rule using Leibniz notation -\n\nd(uv)/dx = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)\n\nmultiply everything by the differential dx (don't worry we can do this \nbecause we're treating it as a differential) \n\nd(uv) = udv + vdu\n\nintegrate everything\n\n uv = integral(udv) +integral(vdu)\n\nmanipulate to get \n\nintegral(udv) = uv - integral(vdu) \n\nAnd in Lagrange's notation \n\nintegral(f(x)g'(x)dx) = f(x)g(x) - integral(f'(x)g(x)dx)\n\nWhat this means is that you can use this formula to find integrals of \nfunctions that can be expressed as the product of a function that is easy \nto differentiate and a function that is easy to integrate. In the case of \nthe gamma function, t^2 is easy to differentiate and e^-x is easy to \nintegrate. What it comes out to is it says that gamma(t+1) =(t+1)gamma(t) \nand that gamma(0)=1 (recall that the gamma function is the same as (t+1)! \nfor natural numbers) which are all you need to define the factorial \nfunction recursively.

Note that this definition is relevant \nbecause we can look at permutations from the opposite perspective: A set \nhas N! permutations, each one a unique state. Suppose some set exists. Then \nthe set must be in some initial state. The total number of permutations is \nequal to the initial state plus every possible rearrangement of that state.\nThe definition of a rearrangement can be expressed as follows:\n\nSuppose there exists some set of real numbers E, with X number of elements \nlabeled E(1), E(2)... E(X-1), E(X).\n\nSuppose there also exists B, a set of Y real numbers labeled B(1), B(2)... \nB(Y-1), B(Y).\n\nThen B is defined as a rearrangement of A, and visa versa, if and only if \nthe following holds\ntrue:\n\n1. E = B (Two sets are defined as equal if and only if every element of one \nset is an element of the other).\n\n2. There exists at least one pair of positive integers N, Q such that:\n\nI. N <= X (N is less than or equal to X)\nII.Q <= Y (Q is less than or equal to Y)\nIII.N != Q (N is not equal to Q)\n|V. E(N) = B(Q) (Element N in E is equal to element Q in B. Because a set \ncannot have duplicates, this means that when combined with the previous two \nfacts, the following equivalent statement can be made: There exists an \nInteger in E that isn't at the same location in B, meaning they are in \ndifferent orders).",

We define these operators addition, subtraction, etc so whenever we \ndiscover a set of number then we need to incorporate them within the \nalready defined paradigms. Zero is essential to the number system and even \nthough all the operations outlined by login892173 seem insignificant they \nfollow from the fact that we have operations and 0 is a number on which \nsuch operations can be applied. \nAlso consider the following:\n1! = 1\n1 x anything = anything\nanything ^ 1 = anything\n\nAll of the above operations seem meaningless but we don't then jump to the \nconclusion that 1 is meaningless. There are things in mathematics which are \nthe consequences of our logic and even though we can live without \nacknowledging them so much can be learnt if we do.",

What \nassumption does 0! = 1 make that 0! = 0 does not?\n\nI don't know if there's any immediate direct application of 0! in nature \n(besides the coin example).  But there are applications of the formulas \nwhich include factorials.\n\nFor example, the formula for a combination.  The formula nCk is given by \nn!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nIf you want, you can go out and perform tests on this formula.  For fun, \nlet's say you there are 5 cookies on the table (let's say each cookie is a \ndifferent type).  And you are allowed to take 2.  How many possible \ncombinations of cookies can you get?\n\nWell, the formula says 5!/(2!(5-2)!) = 5!/(2!3!) = 10.  And if you were to \nactually get 5 different cookies, and count how many combinations of 2 \ncookies there are.  And I encourage you to actually model this and see if \nthere are in fact 10 combinations of 2 cookies from a collection of 5 \n(spoilers: there are).\n\nNow, what if there are 5 cookies on the table, and you are allowed to take \n5 cookies?  Clearly, there's only one combination of 5 cookies you can take \nfrom a group of 5 cookies.\n\nThe formula gives 5!/(5!(5-5)!).  Simplifying this (cancelling the 5!), we \nobtain 1/0!.\n\nThis is an instance where we *weren't* plugging 0 into a formula.  We were \nplugging 5 into a formula.  A formula that works in all other instances. \n But here, we obtain 1/0!.  And we know the actual value for the situation \nis 1.  The only number that 0! could possibly be (if it is a number at all) \n*must* be 1.\n\nWell, yes, we *could* say that the formula works unless n=k.  But then in \nso many formulas, we'll need to specify all these rules and exceptions for \n0! (the binomial formula requires both 0! = 1 and 0^0 = 1, for example).\n\nThat being said, I'm not so sure Occam's Razor really helps you here.  0! = \n0 requires just as many assumptions as 0! = 1, but 0! = 0 includes the \nadded benefit of making everything more complicated and less elegant. \n Hmmm... I wonder what Occam's Razor says about that...\n\nWhy is not being able to divide by 0 contradictory?  I don't see it.",

Basically what I got from this guy was that it's \nsatisfying the pattern, and to call nothing something is only to satisfy \nthe pattern, and is an essentially useless point to make.  By this logic, \nif 0! did = 0, he would be saying nothing is nothing, while still \njustifying the satisfaction of a pattern.  So ultimately, WHY is 0!=1? \n From first logical principles, how can a person equate 0! into 1?  You \ncould as a mathematician start adding things, essentially making shit up to \nallow a pattern to function or further satisfy, or avoiding compromising, \nexisting theories, however this doesn't mean it should logically follow \npertaining to real world application, after all, as I stated above, math is \nonly as good as it's real world application.  That's why it exists.  Even \ntheoretical mathematical practices may not necessarily be utilized in \nexperiments that can be run in real time in the present, but essentially \nused to predict based on predictions to pave a general trajectory for \nstudy, until the real world applicable experiments can confirm or refute \nthe known theories.  We're always rewriting the textbooks.  That's what I \nwas driving at with the Einstein quote.  Einstein was also a mathematician, \nthat's what his theories were founded by.  Until the rationality by which \n0! = 1 can be logically demonstrated to me, and not simply because it \nsatisfies a pattern, that is what I must accept it as, a satisfaction of a \nrule to avoid compromising or to reaffirm existing theories.  That being \nsaid, I'm curious what utility 0!=1 has in the real world, and if it does, \nand it has been proven to provide results, I would be very interested, but \nnot entirely convinced.  Look up occam's razor by the way.\n\nAlso, as stated by a previous poster, if nothing is something, why can't a \nnumber be divided by 0?  Seems contradictory to me.",

However, there are many reasons to define 0! as 1.\n\nAs said above, the number of ways to arrange zero objects can be thought of \nas 1.  This is a philosophical argument, to be sure.  But in mathematics, \n\"nothing\" is something.  Examples of nothing being something include 0 \nbeing a number and the empty set being a set.  Mathematics is a much more \nbeautiful theory with much greater explanatory power if we allow nothing to \nbe considered as something.\n\nAnother reason is utility.  There are many situations (such as power \nseries), where factorials show up.  If 0! were 0, we would not be able to \nuse the same formulas for many of our power series.  We'd have to write the \nfirst term separately and then use the formula for the other terms.\n\nIt's kind of funny that an Einstein quotation would be brought up about \nthis, as Einstein was all about making notation easier to write.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation\n\nSince Einstein found it too cumbersome to even write the sigma for a \nsummation, I think he would find it far too cumbersome to write out the \nfirst term of a power series (or some other series) separately from the \nrest and then use the formula for the others.\n\nBut I don't find appealing to Einstein to be the most convincing arguments \nabout mathematics.",

This is usually denoted \nby a big pi with i=0 underneath, n above it and a_i afterwards, similar to \nthe sum-symbol. Then obviously (product from i=0 to n+m over a_i) is the \nsame as (product from i=0 to n over a_i) * (product from i=n+1 to n+m over \na_i), i.e. I can \"spilt the product\" anywhere.

Then for the whole equation \nto make any sense at all, the last product HAS to be 1.\n\nThen of course the factorial can be defined as (product from i=1 to n over \ni) and thus 0!=(product from i=1 to 0 over i) is the empty product, which \nis equal to 1.",

It is undefined when x=0. As this is what I am reading from your \nquestion I think. Honestly not sure what the actual domain would be since \n x!/x =(x-1)!= \u0393(x).

In fact 0^0 \nis often defined as 1, simply because the function x^x converges to 1 as x \nconverges to 0 for instance. If you have studied Taylor series you will see \nthat it is really convenient for the first term. Or what about probability, \nwhen you have n over zero.\n\n So things like 0^0 = 1 or 0! = 1 could be controversial they serve a \npractical goal. If you wouldn't use it that way you would have to define a \nfunction f such that f(n) = n! if n is a natural number and f(0) = 1 and \ndoing that every time is quite time consuming and not convenient. I think \nthat's the main reason to define 0! = 1 or 0^0 = 1.",

We'll use \nthis fact later.\n\nSo, let's say you have n objects, but you only want to arrange r of them. \nHow many ways are there to do that? It turns out the answer, which is \nanother widely-used formula, is n! / (n - r)!.\n\nTo see this, say we have 7 objects and are arranging 3 of them. For the \nfirst object, we have 7 choices. For the second, we have 6 choices, and for \nthe third, we have 5 choices. Therefore, there are 7x6x5 ways to arrange 3 \nobjects from a group of 7. This is equal to 7! / 4! because of the \ncancelling and stuff.\n\nSo, when r is a positive integer less than or equal to n, there are n! / (n \n- r)! ways to arrange those r objects. \n\nWhat happens when r = n? Then the question is, we have n objects, and how \nmany ways are there to arrange all n of them? According to the formula, \nthere are n! / (n - n)! = n! / 0! ways to do so.\n\nBut we already know the answer. There are n! ways to arrange n objects. \nTherefore:\n\nn! / 0! = n!\n\nHence, 0! must be equal to 1. It can't be equal to any other number. It \nalso can't be undefined due to that equality.",

A function F(z) is \nmeromorphic if it is holomorphic everywhere except a few isolated points. \n So the complex derivative of the gamma function exists except at a \ncollection of isolated points, in this case, the negative integers.  We \ncall these places \"poles\" (pole has a technical meaning, and is a special \ntype of singularity, but it turns out that meromorphic functions have poles \nwhere their complex derivative does not exist).  It turns out that the \nfunction is undefined where it has poles and is defined everywhere else.\n\n2. Yes, in fact, what I was talking about in number 1 was actually the \n\"analytic continuation\" of the gamma function.  It doesn't even really make \nsense to talk about an analytic function unless it is complex-valued to \nbegin with.  But yes, we can extend the gamma function to the complex \nplane.  So the gamma function is defined for all complex numbers, except at \nits poles, the negative integers.\n\n3. Yes and no.  In 2, I said that the gamma function has an \"analytic \ncontinuation.\"  Technically, this is not true.  Rather, it has a \n\"meromorphic\" continuation, which just means that the gamma function can be \nextended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane.  A lot of people \nwill call it an analytic continuation, which is technically incorrect, but \nnot a big deal, since we generally understand what is meant.  By \ndefinition, though, an analytic continuation is, in fact, an extension of a \nfunction to the complex plane so that the function is analytic/holomorphic.\n\n4. The meromorphic continuation of the gamma function cannot handle \nnegative integers, but can handle all other complex numbers, including \nnegative real numbers which are not integers.  Since the gamma function has \npoles at the negative integers, some people work in the extended complex \nnumbers and say that the value of the gamma function at a negative integer \nis \"complex infinity.\"  In fact, if you use WolframAlpha and type in \n\"gamma(-1)\", it will spit out complex infinity as the answer.\n\nYour questions all deal with a branch of mathematics called \"Complex \nAnalysis.\"  It is a very advanced mathematics courses (some math majors \ntake it as undergrads, but many don't see it until grad school!), so if \nthis seems confusing, don't feel bad.  There's a lot of weird terminology, \nand it is really difficult to follow the terminology unless you actually \nstudy the subject.",

To \ncreate an inverse function, you flip the terms in the ordered pairs, so \neach (x, y) becomes (y, x) in the inverse function.  However, for a \nfunction to have an inverse, it must be both one-to-one and onto. \n One-to-one means that if (x, y) and (z, y) are both in f, then x = z. \n Onto means that the codomain of f is equal to the range of f. \n Colloquially, this means that every member of the set Y is in at least one \nof the ordered pairs in f.  So for the basic definition of factorial, If X \nis the set of all non-negative integers, and Y is exactly the set of all \nnumbers which result when you apply factorial to all members of X, then the \nfunction would have an inverse...otherwise not.  So specifically a mapping \nof non-negative integers into non-negative integers would not have an \ninverse.  I'm not sure what the result is when both X and Y are the set of \nnon-negative real numbers.  Some math guy would know the answer, or could \nsolve it easily from the equation in the video...I'm not really a math guy.\n  ",
