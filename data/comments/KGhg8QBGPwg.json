That's not a bad thing \nin and of itself because I like the Just Cause games, but FC1 and 2 were a \ndifferent experience. Sure thematically FC1 is very silly and FC2 more \nserious, but in terms of gameplay they were a lot more compelling, for the \nreasons described in the video that you linked (though some of those \nreasons obviously don't apply to FC1).\n\nAdded to this, FC3 and 4's world design was obviously game-y, whereas FC1 \nfelt like a real Pacific island and FC2 felt like real Africa. Esepcially \nFC2. I'm from South Africa myself and the visuals and sound assets (apart \nfrom some of the human accents) were so spot on that at several points I \ncould swear the game was even evoking the smell of the places it was \ndepicting. Even though graphically it's no longer that special, it did way \nmore for me in terms of making you feel grounded in a real place than its \nsequels did, and that's all up to the game mechanics rather than the \ngraphical fidelity. And again - there's nothing wrong with FC3 and 4 per \nse, but they're not what I was looking for and I don't know what the hell \nthey're doing in the Far Cry franchise.",
