So it is very well possible that 4J \nSTUDIOS, not Mojang, has implemented a stalker mob that never attacks, just \nstays about 50 blocks away at times when you aren't to notice, AKA \nHerobrine, I have seen very real footage of the discription I just gave, A \nvery famous encounter is by TheGamingLemon himself, so go check those out. \nRemember, 4J STUDIOS and not MOJANG have most likely added him in.

This is the only place I've ever heard \nanything about how lanterns lit up places when held, so I'm not so sure \nthat was actually going to be the case.

If anyone \nhas time for a story feel free to read but if not just go on with your day.\n\nSo i was in my minecraft world. it was titled DubbaWUbbaSHubbaGRubba. I was \nbored when making it. Anyway i had a pet wolf and a cat outside my home \nincase of creepers.  One day i went out to go get some food. I normally \nmake hunting runs every once in a while and bring back a lot of food and \nput it in a chest. Well my food supply was low so i went out to go get \nmore. Bringing the last of the food with me.\nAnyway, I saw a mountain top and me. Not knowing that mobs wouldn't render \nfrom that far away. decided to climb it and look around for some cows or \npigs. Now when i got to the top anyone who plays minecraft knows the mobs \nwouldn't render so naturally i saw nothing. I span in a slow circle on the \nmountaintop scanning for food. When i saw him. This was a singleplayer game \nno brothers trolling no lan connection. offline mode. I just stared at him \nfor the longest time. I had heard about it but never thought it was real. \nIt was already there before i had reached the top of the mountain waiting \nfor me. and it stared. for what seemed like hours i just looked at it \ntrying to figure out how to take a screenshot. When it despawned like a mob \nwould when you get too far away. I have never seen it from that day. but i \nhave lost far to many wolves in the forest i saw him in.\ufeff",

It is the same \nreason why games such as the Elder Scroll Series on the PC stays popular \nfor so long is because of user created content.

In life, I'm not \nsure, but I think it's the place where people go when they are not allowed \nneither in hell nor in heaven, so i guess you'll have to be the most \nneutral person in the world to go there. But in Dante's Inferno (the poem) \nit describes the purgatory as a giant mountain that you need to climb to \nget to heaven once you have completed your sentence in hell. I may be \nwrong, but I remember that you have to climb the mountain in a way that \npunishes you according to the sins you committed (i.e. if you committed \ngluttony you'll have to climb the mountain without any food, and if you \ncommitted envy, you'll climb the mountain while you're blinded)",

Also, if you mean also passive mobs \n(sheeps, cows, pigs...) you can just put Peaceful mode, and to have wool, \nyou just use shears! When you start the game, you just kill like, one cow \nand then it becomes night. It's your first night. Then zombies and \nskeletons comes to kill you, for unknown reasons. Hostile mobs are evil. \nNot Steve.\nAnd villagers are simple people, I never killed them, because killing them \ndoesn't do anything. You just trade with them, here some emeralds, and \nbooya! Diamond chestplate from that villager!\n\nAnd what if I put another skin? \"Oh look! I'm no longer Steve! 'parties'\"\n\nWhat's the purpose of it?",

Then something \npunch me there was a canyon near the sign so i almost fell down but luckily \ni was crouching.Then I turned around.For 7 seconds he was looking at me.I \ngot scared to death he had some gas particles floating around him like the \nmods but its on xbox360 and it was my friend's server and if there was a \nmod I couldnt have join.I started telling him and as soon as I can tell it \nwas herobrine. U got to believe me I swear me and my friend on a private \nworld and randomly a fire started and it was coming towards us and i saw my \nfriend burned to death.So we went in creative mod and see if hes there but \nhes not we prepared as much as we can to survive atleast 1 night without us \ngetting separated.One day I swear i was at a house then....Herobrine was \nwatching me in a window! i got so scared i pulled out my map and...My \nfriend was lost somewhere but he wasnt near the house he was lost.Remember \nthis was December 23,2012 \ufeff",

Does it explode?? you bet it does! To spread its spores, as \nwith most mosses, Sphagnum disperses spores through the wind. To accomplish \nthis, the capsule holding the spores builds up air pressure before \nrupturing and launching the spores high into the air. Its a method that's \nvery similar to a pop gun, air being squeezed into a tight space, before \nerupting all at once. Hissing sound anyone?? Little pockets of air leek out \njust before the time of explosion. And even though this moss is one of the \nmost primitive plants forms on Earth, it has one of the most sophisticated \nmethods of launching these spores. It creates a vortex ring. Kind of like a \nsmoke ring or a mushroom cloud. These vortex rings allows Peat to launch \nits spores at an incredible speed for such a small plant. \ufeff",
