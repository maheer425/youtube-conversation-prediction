However, I must say that I liked \nThe Catcher in the Rye, and that it DOES have a motive and a plot.\n\nNo action? Perhaps. A cyclical, or even short, stopped plot? Perhaps. But \nit does have a plot. Problem is that nothing out of the common happens. \nNothing spectacular or \"revealing\" happens at any given time. It's just \nlike life itself: in most novels, you have a moment of miracle, of \nepiphany, in which characters, and readers through them, find out some \nessential truth. Some sort of \"revelation\". That revelation doesn't happen \nin this novel, or, at least, doesn't happen directly, nor explicitly and \nnot at all suddenly, but it does happen throughout the novel itself.\n\nIn life, most of the days go by without nothing particularly new \nor important happening. Most of our stages in life are just a series of \ndays, weeks, months or even years in which we do the same stuff over and \nover again, and nothing changes. And it comforts us knowing that. Then, \nwhen we go watching movies and reading books and we look for those \nexciting, miraculous, visibly crafted stories. That's what's great and \nwrong with The Catcher in the Rye: it doesn't appear to be crafted. It \nlooks more like a diary, like... real life.",

Most authors often use \nconcrete things as symbols; The Great Gatsby's green light, The Hunger \nGames' mockingjay. I have a new appreciation for Salinger because he used \nactual diction as a symbol. These symbols are subtle even though some are \nused nearly 180 times throughout the novel.

Even reading the first 10 pages \nyou'd understand what Dick Johnson said about Holden. Also, Holden is far \nfrom a pessimist.  \"Why must kids look at the darkness in a world \noverflowing with light?\", because the world isn't a bag of sunshine and \neveryone isn't a special little snowflake. If you actually think that way, \nyou're delusional. There's good in the world, but there's equally or \ngreater bad in it. I can understand your point of view, that doesn't mean \nit's right, nor does it mean I care for it. You mean absolutely nothing to \nme, your retard of a mother and failure of a father can go jump off a \nbridge for all I care, the fact you pointed such things out over YouTube \nmakes me think you're secretly emotional, but you put on a facade saying \nthat there's so much good in life. You've been through so much shit (If \nyou're telling the truth about your parents) so you try and block it out \nsaying there's a light everywhere you go. How is Holden spoiled? He \nunderstands he was given such things and is even appreciative of what he \nreceived, but it doesn't really matter to him. He's most definitely not \npathetic or pissy. The end of the book he explains his one dream is to safe \nchildren from falling off the edge of a fucking cliff. Does that seem in \nany way to be something a pissy spoiled brat would do or wish to do? And \nyes, you do act like a child. So does Holden. You don't care much for what \nothers think of you. Neither does Holden. Holden isn't self centered, he \nsee's the wrong in himself. That's one thing you don't understand. I don't \nbelieve you read the full book. Because you are ridiculing him over things \nyou don't understand. Maybe you lack the mental capacity to understand what \na reader truly means and to put pieces together. That would explain why you \ndon't understand this book and why your mother is a nutjob and your father \nis a failure.Your final statement is what really gets me. Throughout the \nwhole book, Holden ridicules everyone for being \"phonies.\" Stating that \nnobody is truly being themselves. Then you say almost the same thing. \"Be \nyourself.\" I don't expect a well thought out or semi decent reply in \nreturn, but any response would help me further understand why you don't get \nthis book. It truly fascinates me how you are so against Holden, yet you \nboth in some aspects seem to be a little alike. You just don't realize it.",

Do you understand that? Stop judging, pointing your finger, calling \npeople \"phonies, liars, dishonest, rotten, etc.\" If you go around life \nbitching about what you see wrong with it without seeing the wrong in \nyourself (doing that alone is pretty goddamn wrong) you will simply be \nanother bitter-ass old man who will die disappointed in life.

Eventually we get to Allie, Holden's younger brother, \nwho died of leukemia.\n\nThroughout the story, Holden tells us it's all about Allie, how the grief \nhe had for his beloved sibling led to his broken hand, how he carries \nAllie's mitt for comfort and how he prays to Allie to save him. For me, \nthat is the thread that links all of Holden's good and bad choices \ntogether, that is the layer we must reach to really understand this story, \nand that is what we adults can look to in order to really recognize the \nweight and beauty of Salinger's book.....that's just my opinion and maybe \nits because i read it at a certain time in my life and that's why I enjoy \nit so much and have a love/hate relationship with Holden because he is an \nasshole and annoying and  ....maybe you should read to book again",
