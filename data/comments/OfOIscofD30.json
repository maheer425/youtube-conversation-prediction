It's not about vanquishing the world of criminal \ngangs; of course crims will always just move on to more profitable forms of \ncrime. However, they'd no longer be able to rake in huge profits from drug \ndealing. This would make many of the social ills associated with the \nenormous and unregulated black market in drugs (rampant violence, \naddiction, deaths from adulterated substances, unnecessary criminalisation \nof users etc) less costly and damaging to society at large, and easier to \nbring under control - as was the case with the ending of alcohol \nprohibition. I hope I've managed to explain my meaning better.   ",

The negative publicity, the criminalization, the \ngangs that work an underground and violent black market, it's all there! \nIt's *all* right *THERE*! It's people like *you* that are the problem! \nSecondly: What the fuck do mental illness patients in hospitals have to do \nwith drugs? Nothing.\nThirdly: You know what would help reduce (reduce, reduce *reduce*) drug \nusage and hence the drug overdoses the paramedics and police officers see? \n*Education* about what drugs *REALLY* do, instead of fear-mongering \nbullshit the government has been dishing out. Teach the facts, and the \npeople will know what to do.\nFourthly: Using drugs is a bullshit reason to get fired. What I do in my \nfucking spare time and does not affect my work performance is none of my \nemployers business! What other \"vices\" do you think should get you fired? \ndrinking? smoking? prostitutes? And why do companies do these drug test? \nbecause of the stigma the bullshit propaganda has given to any drug user. \nPropaganda *you* have fallen victim to, pal. \"if you legalize drugs, people \nwill be bums, smoke crack all day and collect welfare...\" I call *BULLSHIT* \ndid that happend *before* the drugs were illegal? were people bums in the \n1940s? were people bums in the 1930s? were people bums in the 1920s? were \npeople bums in the 1910s?

During prohibition of alcohol, people continued to \nsell alcohol, only illegally, and sales of alcohol actually increased. \nCrime rates went way up and mobsters amassed great power leading to even \npolice officers becoming corrupt. When you're dealing with a hard drug like \nmeth, the negative impacts on society are drastically amplified. You're not \nstopping anybody from doing a drug by keeping it illegal, don't you \nunderstand? They can still do the drug. You're not going to get rid of a \ndrug, get that through your thick head. People are going to do drugs if \nthey want to! And how does your argument about kids getting drugs even hold \nup? Have you noticed that alcohol is harder to get than weed? Alcohol is \nlegal. You basically supported my argument with that statement.\n\nYes, drug addiction is harmful. I agree. If we legalized drugs the tax \nrevenue could pay for treatment centers instead of wasting money on sending \ndrug addicts to prison to become hardened criminals. And giving drug \naddicts felonies? What the hell? They come out of prison a hardened \ncriminal AND they can't get a job for 7 years, so what choice do they have? \nA criminal life of theft or going back to the drugs. \n\nDo you realize how many heroin addicts DIE because they don't have access \nto simple things? I'll list them:\n\n1. Novacaine - this drug should be widely available, but of course not. \nDrugs are illegal! Why would you need it, right?!!? derp..\n\n 2. Clean needles - stops the spread of STD's and infections, etc. leading \nto less health problems for drug addicts, saving money on healthcare as \nwell!\n\n3. Regulated drugs - Many heroin addicts die because they accidentally \noverdosed their heroin. They don't know if it's going to be weak or not, \nthey don't know what it's going to be cut with. They might not even know if \nit's heroin. Legalized drugs would lead to pure, clean, regulated drugs \nwith the ingredients/strength clearly listed.\n\n4. Education - ever have a D.A.R.E. class in school? They spread propaganda \nand give you some false information. That's not the way to go about it..\n\nPortugal decriminalized all of their drugs, after a decade there has been a \n50% reduction in drug abuse. We have spent the past 40 years fighting an \nimaginary drug war here in america. We the taxpaying citizens have put $1 \ntrillion to waste, when we could have simply taxed the drugs all along and \nhave a healthier society. There are so many more reasons to finally \nregulate/decriminalize/legalize drugs, and so little to not. Stop thinking \nwith emotion, please. You're not gonna stop anybody from using drugs.",

In any case, \nthere's another side to this as well, namely that there are/were millions \nof addicts who are so thoroughly immoral that they will fund organized \ncrime to get their hits.

The reason for this is \nthat, when they're highly available, the substances can be used as \nadditives in all manner of foods to create compulsive cravings for those \nexact foods in people as the drugs have rewired their brains to repeat \nactions that led to highly pleasurable experiences. When they have those \ncravings, you can sell the foods at ridiculous prices or simply out compete \nyour competition by chemically programming consumers.

We are talking about drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, \nheroin, and even bath salts. These things are basically poison, so what \nshould we start legalizing ricin and cyanide? Do you realize why \nprohibition was such an epic failure? Because alcohol was a major aspect of \nculture. If you legalize these drugs, the same thing could happen. People \nwill start to normalize it and then they'll get addicted. Addicts often \nhave a problem simply admitting they have a problem and will not seek help. \nThat is why I think rehab for drug offenders needs to be mandatory and drug \nusers should have job opportuities and voting rights when they get out of \njail. Oh and as for Portugal's so called success-there are many countries \nthat have not legalized these drugs and have WAAAAAAY lower drug rates than \nPortugal.  So there is another way., \ufeff",

(other than the scumbags of course) The \nthing I'm getting at is make something *better*, that is literally it. The \nwhole synthesizing thing is obviously a complete and utter failure, how \nabout the THC oil though? No high, still helps those who need the drug. \nYour comment is quite long, and quite frankly I just don't feel like \nreplying to it as it's just a comment...so I will reply in points rather \nthan spend the time typing everything out.\n\n1. That sucks that you had to go through all of that, but just because one \nthing worked for you, doesn't mean that's the only thing that can work for \nyou. I'm sure if enough time and research is put into your disease a cure \ncan be made.\n\n2. Who are you to judge those who you don't know? Those people who I \ndescribed lives *revolved* around marijuana, it revolved around their lives \nso much it seemed as though every word that came out of their mouth was \nrelated to marijuana in some way. I'm not saying that all those who use the \ndrug are like this...because just about everyone I know has used or uses \nthe drug, most of them are fine.\n\n3. I've seen successful potheads too, like in the last point...but no where \nnear those who you describe. Your grades however, are quite irrelevant, \ngood on you though.\n\n4. No I don't think all potheads are lazy, didn't even remotely say or \ninsinuate that.\n\n5. Nothing is impossible, that's a fact of life. Existence is literally a \nblank canvas, you can do absolutely anything you want...all you need is the \nresources to do it. Just because this may not be possible *now* doesn't \nmean it's impossible. We cannot currently create stars...does that mean \nit's impossible...og course not. Did you think those synthesized chemicals \nmight not be safe because we don't have the understanding to make safe \nsynthesized chemicals in the first place?\n\n6. That analogy does make sense...but we're talking about a *theoritical* \nprefect drug vs a natural drug...not some artificial drug that would \nprobably cause death. Sure those pharmaceutical companies can't make a drug \nas good as marijuana...but last time I checked Mother Nature was a master \npharmacologist, geneticist, etc. we however are not.\n\n7. Already aware of the potential of Marijuana, no need to tell me your \nstory there, I know it works quite well...which is why I am for medicinal \nuse.\n\n8. Just because you've had experience with illness and one thing worked for \nyou, doesn't mean you know everything. The simple fact is, in the past 10 \nyears marijuana was a terrible thing, the general opinion is changing and \nnow you can use it...that doesn't make it a miracle drug just because it \nworked while other options failed. The simple fact of the matter is it *can* \nbe improved...that that's my whole point.",

Just using that word and meaning it \ndiscredits you right off the bat. *ANY* scientist in his or her right mind \nwouldn't use that word, because there is not one thing that is in any way \npermanently impossible. I'm not, nor did I say marijuana is a bad thing, \nbut it's certainly not a miracle either, the point is we can *make* this \nmiracle drug, there's no reason not to try.

Who the FUCK do you \nthink you are talking to?!\n\nBecause of my autoimmune disease, I have had countless steroid injections, \nlow-dose chemotherapy (which we had to discontinue because I lost 10 lbs in \nthe last 5 weeks.. too much even with my wisdom teeth removal... which \nresulted in infection because of the methotrexate), I take 13 pills a day, \nhave had knee surgery... The methotrexate has even caused hair loss and my \nnails to turn yellow, as well as anemia. I have spent the last 10 years in \nand out of hospitals, trying to be able to chew or walk without struggle \nand pain. I smoke medical marijuana, and take a synthetic marijuana pill \n(nabilone).\n\nThe negative effects you go on about tells me, quite frankly, that you have \nsurrounded yourself with losers and rather than holding their shortcomings \nagainst them, you take a lazy cop out. It's easier to blame marijuana than \npoor character. Just like parents that blame the media for their kids \ninability to show empathy. These negatives you talk about are imaginary. \nPeople don't surround their lives around pot- they surround their lives \naround nothing, and smoke pot while they do it. Don't blame the drug for \nthe ignorant people that consume it. You see the same character traits in \nnon-potheads just as often.\n\nI have also seen MANY successful potheads. The potheads I am surrounded by \ngo to school, go to work... one of the biggest potheads I know is the owner \nof an extremely successful small business, house, vehicle... in his mid \ntwenties, with no silver spoon to help him. Through highschool, I have \nsmoked weed. Despite being too disabled to have great attendance, I get \nGREAT grades- excluding a midterm, I haven't had a grade below 90% this \nyear.\n\nThe fact that you think of potheads as lazy, unmotivated individuals says 2 \nthings. 1) You surround yourself with unmotivated individuals. 2) You \nblindly follow the propaganda that is intended to justify failing drug laws.\n\nAlso, the fact that you say \"nothing is impossible\" to the idea of a \nflawless synthetic drug shows just how ignorant you are on the subject of \npharmacology. YES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE! Why the hell do you think they give me \npills to cope with the effects of pills to cope with the effects of \ninjections? Because synthesized chemicals are NOT 100% safe.\n\nThey synthesize marijuana because it is ultimately a legal loophole. Big \npharma can play drug dealer, take a bigger cut, and dodge the law. That's \nit. They synthesize it to make money and make it easier to legally \ndistribute.\n\nTo say that synthetic is superior is like saying an apple I grew from my \nown tree is not superior to one I buy in the grocery store, full of \nchemicals and oftentimes genetically modified. They're NOT. That's why \nwe're encouraged to eat organic. Because natural is best.\n\nWhen I had my knee surgery, I didn't take any pain killers. They made me \nnauseous. I ONLY used marijuana as pain management... and my doctors said \nthat I was managing my pain better than they had expected. When I smoked \nweed once in a while, my disease was out of control. When I started smoking \nfor medical rather than recreational reasons, the progression started to \nslow.\n\nThe last 10 years of my life have been procedures, pills, injections, I \nhave spent days and days out of my life in MRI machines alone... I have \nmore experience with the reality of illness and medications than most \npeople experience in a lifetime. Honestly, I don't know who the fuck you \nthink you are, but you need to shut up. You don't know what you're talking \nabout.",
