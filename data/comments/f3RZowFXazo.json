Besides, high schooler's now \neither have never heard of either of them, or know/have been taught that \nthey are fake.\n\n+sgtdavid primary Same thing. No mention of The Haeckel's Drawings. When it \ncomes to the Miller-Urey Experiment, the textbook explains what they \nthought, and then, on the same page, has a section called: \"Reevaluating \nthe Miller-Urey Experiment\" which explains why it was incorrect. It also \nasks the students to explain why the Miller-Urey Experiment is incorrect. \nThen, on the next page, it has the Bubble Model, another theory that is \nmore probable, as a replacement for the MU Experiment.\n\nRead the actual textbooks before you spout shit from a creationist website (\n+sgtdavid primary) or spout shit out of your ass (+Patriot News Network).\n\n[Also, +sgtdavid primary, your citation doesn't say that it is in \ntextbooks. Albeit, I looked over it quite fast, but if there is indeed a \nquote in there that says that, please specify where it is. Either way, it's \nproven wrong in more modern books. Plus, the citation has nothing to do \nwith whether or not the information is in textbooks anyway, so it is a \nuseless source. Please research better in the future.]",

I really meant it for this person. \n\nA LOT of people who know what An 'Australian' accent is have already said \n'wtf?!?'\n\nNot a big deal - just incredibly irritating,  because, no matter where \nyou're from, when you hear someone - poorly imitating you - it's like nails \non a blackboard. I'm sure if you heard someone pretending to sound like \nwhere you're from, it would sound 'odd,' and if you tried listening to them \nfor awhile, you'd get so hung up on listening to the 'oddness,' you'd \nforget what it was the speaker was saying.\n\nSame thing here.\n\nFunny thing is, I don't know where you're from, nor do you know me. but, a \nlot of people think they 'don't have an accent,' (depends who's listening - \neveryone does), and a lot of people wish they sounded like \n(fill-in-the-blank).\n\nThis guy's 'accent'  is so poor - if I took him into either a bar or one of \nthe private clubs, near my place in Eliz. Bay (which I'm sure he doesn't \nknow where that is - w/out Googling), he'd quite quickly be laughed at, \nwhen he started to speak with that.\u2026'thing.'\n\n.",

                    "text": "+Brett Melton But you also have to consider the fact that no other country \nhas  come forward with this claim and most of everyone believed it was lost \nforever. Seriously,  though, take a look throughout all of  history and you \nwill find that no other nation other than the original nation of Israel \nunder the kings of the Holy land have never claimed to have had the Ark. \nEthiopia has been the first and only one to do so. \n\nWhat is believed  to have happened to the Ark was that, during King \nSolomon's reign, some myths claim he gave it to the Queen of Shiva and the \nland of Shiva is located in the modern day country of Yemen,which is \nactually just a quick travel across the Red Sea to Ethiopia. Then, there's \nseveral ideas that the Egyptians may have taken it and Egypt itself went as \nfar south as Ethiopia and, in fact, the  tributaries of the Nile River come \nfrom the Ethiopian Highlands. Then, there's one other possibility. Some \nbelieve that it was taken when Babylon took over the  Holy Land and they \ntook it as a part of their loot, but the thing is, the Ark itself just \ncompletely disappears from most of  the records around that time and is \nbarely mentioned after King Solomon's reign. So, any three of these  could \nbe true, but the two most  likely ones that many believe in is either the \nBabylonian myth or the Queen of Shiva myth. \n\nSo, simply put, it's one of the hardest things to find and, considering how \nlong it has been since it's disappearance, anyone could have claimed to \nhave found it, but no one did and 99% of it all was pure speculation. That \nis until Ethiopia became a nation and they claimed to have the Ark of the \nCovenant. ",

                "text": "Despite everything that's so far been put forward as a \"missing link\", no \nreputable palaeontologist, geneticist or anthropologist will stake his or \nher reputation that they have found unequivocal proof of any kind of \nevolutionary link between Homo Sapiens Sapiens (that's you and me, folks) \nand 'hominids' found in the fossil record. With ONE possible exception: \nHomo Sapiens Neanderthalensis -  Homo Sapiens Sapiens' contemporary; and \na human who might have some residual genes in some modern day people. (But \nI think it wise to hold our breath on that ... claims of DNA links might \nyet prove to be unfounded)\nRegarding PEKING \"man\"... aka 'Sinanthropus':\nPeking Man was discovered in China, in the 1920s and 1930s, and like Java \nMan has since been renamed Homo erectus. The fossils, found about 25 miles \nfrom Peking (Beijing), consisted mostly of skull fragments (only five \nskulls were intact enough to gauge the brain capacity) and teeth, with very \nfew limb bones. All of the original bones were lost between 1941 and 1945. \n(Fortunately, some excellent casts of the originals were made before their \ndisappearance.) Peking Man was a bit smaller overall than the average human \ntoday, but in all respects falls within the modern range of variation, and \nits middle ear structure has been found to be just like ours.\nAs with Java Man, much of the truth surrounding Peking Man was kept from \nthe public.  At the site were also found the remains of ten fully human \ninhabitants who quarried the limestone, built fires, and left behind a \nvariety of tools. It seems that - far from being the ancestor of modern man \n- Peking Man was not only a contemporary, but may also have been his \ndinner. The evidence suggests that the larger people removed (and very \npossibly ate) the brains of the smaller Peking Man individuals.\ufeff",

And \nhe was a suitor to Charles Eden's (1673 \u2013 26 March 1722) daughter, who he \nnever married, but tried. So he also had important wives of politicians of \nthe time. Eden was an important figure during the colonies being over North \nCarolina, he is thought to have protected Blackbeard. Blackbeard is seen \ntoday as uneducated and horrible looking, but in fact, he was very educated \nand (while not on Ship sailing) was said to be charming and well liked in \nthe Bath area. ",

Many hikers go up the mountain looking for the gold \nand end up getting lost and in some cases don't get found. According to my \nteacher and geology stuff, the majority of the gold is burred below the \nsurface where they still currently mine today and keep a VERY close watch. \nThe only reason why we don't hear about too many people finding the gold is \ncause the obviously have high security in certain areas and well ya know, \npeople go up trying to find the lost ditchmen's mine and die/get lost. : P\ufeff",

In fact some of the \nbooks I have read indicate that the French king tried to convince England \nto torture the Templar that were arrested there under orders of the Papacy.\nThe problem with the Templars was that a number of them did confess under \ntorture, but none of the confessions made sense because they were saying \nwhatever they thought the torturers wanted to hear, and (I can't remember \nthe exact event the triggered it) they later recanted their confessions \nhaving them struck from record due to torture.\n\nWould you mind providing reference to the fleets of Templar ships leaving \nFrance the morning of the arrests?",
