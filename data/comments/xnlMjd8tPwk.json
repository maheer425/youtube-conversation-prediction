On the other hand, the appearence of the \nEnclave and BOS would not, so you would have to change that.\n\nP.P.S. I've actually heard some rumours that originally, F3 was supposed to \ntake place 20 years after the War. Then, it was changed into 200 years, so \nthat the Enclave and BOS could be implemented. If it's true, I wander if \nBethesda will do this again, that is, setting the game much earlier than \npreviously.",

The truth is, it is not a true sequel, that is, it doesn't build upon \nF2, instead it does its own thing to the point where having 'Fallout 3' in \nits name is a bit... misleading. From my point of view, if NV had been \ncalled Fallout 3 and F3 had been called Fallout : DC, or something, it \nwould have been much more acceptable, because it would show that NV is the \nsequel to F2 (which it is) and that F3 is a spin off title, just like \nTactics.",

Choices you make lack consequences and basically don't affect anything.\n-Godlike character - Things like putting Intelligence to 9 when starting \nthe game and going straight to Rivet City to get the Int Bobblehead, and \nperks like Almost Perfect completely destroy the core purpose of the \nSPECIAL system.\n-Dialogue and writing - The dialogue is extremely immature and simplistic, \nwhen compared to the older games and New Vegas. The way you can convince \nAutumn and Eden to stand down sound like they were ripped off from a \nB-class Hollywood movie.\n-Twisting the lore for the developer's own purposes - The Brotherhood was \nmade good simply because Bethesda wanted to have someone as the \"good \nguys\". Same goes for the Enclave, which was included in the game simply to \nhave someone as the \"bad guys\". The only real reason you're kicked out of \nyour vault after the Trouble on the Home Front guest is that the developers \ncould pull off a reference to Fallout 1.\nThere's more I could talk about but this comment has gotten pretty long.",

Yes because they appear to be remnants of pre-war US gov't \nas well, but no because they're... different.\n\n\"(Then who was phone?)\"\nSorry I don't know what you're trying to ask. I can't answer that.\n\nHere is some text from the terminal In Grayditch that I found on the \nfallout wiki proving what I said:\n\n\"I can't believe I went through all that trouble to leave Navarro and make \nmy way across the country just to get stuck in this shithole. I'll be \ndamned if I'm going to die here.\nNow that we're cut off from Lesko and Wilks, I think we're on our own. The \ndamn ants keep trying to find a way to get inside the house. Even as I'm \ntyping this, I can hear them scraping the walls looking for a way through. \nI don't know how much longer we can last.\"\n\nWe can see that he is, in fact, an Enclave soldier from Navarro. He seems \nto have escaped and traveled across the country. He couldn't bring much \ngear with him, I guess.\n\n\"I was scavenging some of the near buildings for junk to sell and came \nacross a working radio. No sooner did I turn it on than I heard the \nfamiliar patriotic anthems they used to play whenever Richardson would give \na speech. But this was different. Who the hell is President Eden? When did \nthat happen? Are they on this coast too? Most importantly, will they come \nlooking for me?\nI hope this journey wasn't a huge mistake.\"\n\nSo this guy, from the Western Enclave, has never heard of Eden, who is \nallegedly the president of the Enclave (as the Eastern Enclave would say). \nHe doesn't even know how they got here, or when. They're just there and \nit's weird as hell. They aren't looking for him because Enclave never set \nfoot in that town. They aren't looking for him because they don't know that \nhe ran away, or even the fact that he is an ex-Enclave soldier, so that \nshows that Eastern Enclave don't even know that a Western counterpart \nexists, and vice-versa.",

This can \nbe seen in one of the houses in Grayditch (the town in F3 overrun by fire \nants). Basically the resident of that house worked with the western \nEnclave, and the Enclave in the east apparently had no idea. As for the \nwhole BoS thing, again, a majority of Lyons' BoS aren't from the west, and \ntherefore don't follow the Codex. Also, Lyons' BoS went to the Pitt, not \nthe \"traditional\" one, explaining why they didn't \"kill everyone there\". \nYes, the Codex is pretty much a religion of brainwashing but that doesn't \nmean there can't be any people who betray it like Lyons' did, obviously \nnoted that the Outcasts actually call Lyons a traitor. As for the BoS being \n\"cold-blooded motherfuckers\", that description matches the Outcasts who \nboth follow the Codex AND treat the player and locals like shit (eg. \nattempting to kill you right after unlocking the door in Op Anchorage).\n\n\nSorry for the vague details pertaining to the dead Western Enclave guy in \nGrayditch. I haven't played F3 in years... so I don't remember much detail. \nIf you can, play it again and search one of the shacks and read the \nterminal entries. You'll see what I mean.",

They sell slaves/drugs, \nand their goal is to restore humanity to its former glory by killing off \npretty much everything in the wastelands.\n\nThey have no reason to be on the East coast. And yes. IN GAME you can learn \nall this, and that the Enclave's only bases are the Oil Rig, and an \nunderstaffed Navarro.\n\nAnd once again with the BoS. You can't just suddenly change your heart \nafter being raised by a codex which is pretty much their religion. And I'm \nnot talking about casual christians. I mean a religion that can be similar \nto brainwashing. The Elder Lyons and his group should have just stayed in \nthe Pentagon and sung songs about Liberty Prime.

Every newgame is terrible, I \nhave played every new game and they are all reduced from what they used to \nbe old games are much better than new games because I played them when I \nwas younger and theefore they have better critical game design and don't \nsay its just nostalgia because I have 5 nipples.\ufeff",

The reason they brought Ghouls to the East is to make \nFallout familiar. I a sure you wackos would be saying Fallout was not \nfallout if there were no BoS, no Enclave, no Ghouls and if the \nSuper-Mutants were different. But let me give you a little bit of lesson my \nfriend:\n\nThe reason the Vault 87 are similar to the Mater's, is because is the same \nFEV with slight alterations. It is explained in the different terminals and \nholotapes you guys seem to ignore, plus Fawkes explains a little bit more.\n\nThe reason the BoS turned into a faction of goody-two-shoes is well \nexplained in man conversations with different BoS soldiers, Scribes and \nOutcast alike. Then there's the Outcast which are the true BoS, and feel \nlike the true BoS sending you to impossible suicide missions, like the West \nCoast BoS do. Lyons reached Elder because he was one of the best, and he \nearned that title when discovering Liberty Prime. It is explained by \nCasdin, Rothchild, Bowditch, Peabody and many more, how he was one of the \nmost skilled and toughest of Paladins (shows mow much you pay attention to \nthe game u close-minded fool). There are two main reasons he went soft. \nFirsty, he became a father. Secondly, he got old, and seeing how the \nSuper-mutant threat (which was one of their main missions) was killing many \ninnocent lives, he decided to act. Many of the scribes are pissed at Lyons, \nbut serve with him non-the-less. And the true BoS, when finding out Lyons \nturned 'native' they ceased communications with them, since Lyons had tried \nto convince them to bring back up.\n\nThe Ghouls, yes that is a convenience, but a welcomed one.\n\nThe Enclave, the only thing I am pissed is that we have the option to help \nhem, but they still attack you. It is also well explained why there were \nmany Enclave troops. And guess what? There's bound to be more. The Enclave \nremnants might be hundreds of them. Few o what it was before, but come on, \nthey are the United States FEDERAL government.\n\nIf anything, all you original Fallout fans do is bitch and whine \nannoyingly like the Batman-fans do when Batman gets defeated by a foe. It \nmakes me sick!\n\nEDIT: There is one thing we can agree on, and that is the fact that some \npeople are 'essential' and can't die, until we finish a quest. Why? Because \nthe story is a little linear. But it does NOT ruins the fun and definitely \ndoes NOT ruin the lore.",

There was one too many \n\"coincidences\" in it. Like how F3 super mutants were \"coincidentally\" just \nlike the West ones. And how the Enclave \"coincidentally\" had enough \ntroopers away from Navarro and the oil rig to make a full force military. \nAnd how the BoS \"coincidentally\" has a soft hearted leader (which I wonder \nhow he managed to be elder in the first place).\nI was saying that *IMO* (a term you guys can't seem to grasp) if anything \nFo3 is the odd one out, because it takes place in the East coast (small \ndetail, but worth noting), and the atmosphere was just a zombie game, but \ninstead of zombies, it had scorpions, rats, and ghouls (speaking of ghouls, \nin the first 2 games, it wasn't just Radiation that made them, it was about \n200 worth years of radiation leaking through a crack in the door, along \nside some sort of industrial chemical which I can't name for the life of \nme. The ghouls in Necropolis really should be the only ghouls, now back to \nmy statement), and instead of finding a cure, you had to filter some water \n(that was still irradiated after 200 years). The game also has one of the \nmost bullshit frustrating mechanics ever, that certain characters are \ninvincible unless you do a quest for them. *IF I WANTED TO KILL THEM WHY \nWOULD I DO A QUEST FOR THEM*",

So if you're barely making any money from \nthese videos why even bother asking for a like or subscribe if it's only \nworth a dollar? Oh that's right because it's not worth just $1. My friend's \nbrother does quickscoping for call of duty on YouTube and gets paid $300 a \nvideo with only 10000 subscribers. on top of that you're a whole thing \ntalking about animations it's really mods and set up spawning which is time \nconsuming but you can knock it out in a few hours for their scenes. You do \nrealize when it came to the Elder Scrolls lore they actually hired somebody \nfor a voiceover they didn't need to do that if they were hurting but they \nhave enough money to throw around to do that. Also for the fallout lore \nseries season 2 they added a lot of animation for just the opening so yes \nmore money that they are throwing around.",
