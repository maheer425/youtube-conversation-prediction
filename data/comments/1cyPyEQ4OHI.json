Visual light is big enough that it quickly becomes an issue. \nIt's the same reason you can't get a microscope to look at a virus: That's \nbeyond the maximum magnification.\n\nThat being said, we're talking about somewhere in the 5-20cm range based \noff of a lot of variables. ( Orbit of the satellite, weather/seeing \nconditions, size of the satellite, etc. ) So, an 850m would indeed be \nclearly visible.\n\nOh, just a follow up though: Most detailed images you see, for example \nthose of Google Maps ( but this also applies to government agencies ), are \nfrom planes not satellites. One of the biggest factors is distance from the \ntarget, for obvious reasons. So, a plane flying at 3,000 feet gets an \nimmensely better image than a satellite at more than a hundred times that. \nSatellites are for monitoring an area. If you see something interesting, \nyou send in a plane. Still looks interesting, send someone in on ground:)",
