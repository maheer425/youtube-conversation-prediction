Of course, he prepared by breathing pure Oxygen first.\n\nAs long as you have oxygen in your system, you can hold your breath without \ndying.  Once the oxygen to the brain starts thinning, the body will \n\"complain\" and want to take a breath, but it is possible to hold you breath \nfar beyond that point, just as a matter of willpower.\n\nWhether it is possible to hold your breath long enough that your brain gets \noxygen deprived I have no idea, but if the body is screaming to take a \nbreath, there is probably a reason why not doing so for extended periods of \ntime might be a bad idea. :D",

I have nothing against your sharing \nof your opinion, I just have a bit of a pet peeve for spelling issues. Oh, \ndear... if I've spelled anything wrong in this comment, I'm going to really \nseem like a hypocrite.\nRead on if you want a long, boring explanation that proves just what a bad \nYouTuber I am:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am now going to go through your comment and point out all of the evidence \nproving you're a troll:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. You kept repeating, over and over, the statement that you're not a \ntroll. If you've seen typical cartoons, whenever somebody's lying (well, at \nleast if they're a bad liar) they overly repeat things. For example: \"Of \ncourse I didn't eat any ice cream, but if I did, it would've been very \ngross because I would've found a fly in it. Once again, I did not eat that \nice cream! I didn't eat it.. how could you think that? I did not eat it!\" \nObviously, (though it would also depend on their tone of voice), you would \nknow they were lying.\n\n\n2. Not only did you insult Studio C ( which you did very thoroughly), you \ninsulted several different people/things. To list them, Canadians, the \nDisney Channel, Jack and Jill, linear algebra, Mormons, and garbage. Okay, \nthat last one wasn't too offensive. :)\n\n\n3. You overused hate words. Once again, I'm going to list them. They were: \nunfunny, horrendous, overall bad, campy, tragic disgrace, utter filth, \nblind idea, emotionally dead, disgusting, internet trash, sickening, \ntasteless garbage, crazy, etc. I've got to say, even if you're trolling, \nthis is a pretty creative vocabulary.\n\n\n4. You acted condescending, undermining everybody else's opinion except \nyours. When you said \"How dare you think otherwise\", I became pretty \nconvinced you were a troll. As said before, it's perfectly fine to share \nyour opinion, but please take into account that nearly the entire world has \na different opinion than you, so this is equal to saying \"I hate the \nworld.\" Pretty controversial - not everybody has the same, exact ideas as \nyou do.\n\n\nYou know, I could go on forever, but I am just going to post this and hope \nfor the best. I'm so sorry if this seems impolite in any way, but I just \ncan't let anything go - even a YouTube comment. :/",
