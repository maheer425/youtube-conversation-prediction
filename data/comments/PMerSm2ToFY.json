In 1941, Russian physicist Andrey \nKolmogorov (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov) made a very simple \nargument based on dimensional analysis that described the energy in a \nturbulent \"wave\" (in quotes because it's not really a wave) as a function \nof the \"wavelength.\" This is the famous 5/3 law (\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence#Kolmogorov.27s_theory_of_1941). \nDespite being a simple heuristic, the 5/3 law is amazingly accurate.\n\nAmazingly, we recently discovered that many of Vincent Van Gogh's \npaintings, which look very turbulent by eye, actually *reflect* the 5/3 law \nextremely accurately.\n\nWatch this *super cool* video to learn more.\n\n(Thanks, +Lisa Guinther  for pointing me to this video!)\n\n#physics     #ScienceSunday      #science   #fluids   #turbulence   #art  \ufeff",

Think the rapids in a fast-moving river. \nMaking predictions about turbulent fluid flows is incredibly difficult... \nso difficult that we can't really do it.\n\nBut we can make heuristic arguments... In 1941, Russian physicist Andrey \nKolmogorov (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov) made a very simple \nargument based on dimensional analysis that described the energy in a \nturbulent \"wave\" (in quotes because it's not really a wave) as a function \nof the \"wavelength.\" This is the famous 5/3 law (\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence#Kolmogorov.27s_theory_of_1941). \nDespite being a simple heuristic, the 5/3 law is amazingly accurate.\n\nAmazingly, we recently discovered that many of Vincent Van Gogh's \npaintings, which look very turbulent by eye, actually *reflect* the 5/3 law \nextremely accurately.\n\nWatch this *super cool* video to learn more.\n\n(Thanks, +Lisa Guinther  for pointing me to this video!)\n\n#physics     #ScienceSunday      #science   #fluids   #turbulence   #art  \ufeff",
