I mean for \nchrists sakes the first{or one of the first} \"serial killer\" of note, and \nto this date still the most prolific of all serial killers in terms of \nnumber sof victims{or one of the most prolific} was Countess Elizabeth \nBathory whose number of victims is somewhere between 70{she was charged \nwith this many, but there were far more} and several hundred victims. And \nshe is not the only female serial or mass killer in history in the world. \nWhy do people always only blame males and ignore all the female serial \nkillers and psychopaths?\ufeff",

You are bisexual but you are disgusted by your attraction to \nmales. All that really means is you aren't comfortable with yourself so \nmuch to the point you are Dening a part of yourself. Also there is no such \nthing as gay sex and straight people get stds as well you are just as \nlikely to get an std from vaginal intercourse and the sphincter does in \nfact return to normal size because you seem to forget people shit logs \nevery day. Realistically speaking your poop thickness can be 5in and more \nif you know any facts about penises you would know average girth of a penis \nis 5in-5.5in. You're argument about it being unnaturally is inaccurate \ncause if it's really a choice. Why would a child purposely choose to be \ndifferent like that why? According to your bible(which by the way was \nwritten by man. Therefore full of flaws, is vague and contradicts itself. \nIt wasn't written by God himself/herself. It's been edited over the years \nto support people's propaganda. Is taken out of historical context cause \nyou know back then people total knew what was natural and what wasn't) it \nsaid we were all made in the image of God himself. Now you'll probably say \nit was Adam and eve not Adam and Steve but Adam was a straight make the \nperfect partner for a heterosexual male is a female just like the perfect \npartner for a Homosexual male is another homosexual male or a bisexual \nmale. What you fail to grasp is in saying you're against the act of being \ngay you fail to realize part of being gay is loving people, hating people, \nand living life. Now lets talk about suicide. You aren't cast out by \nsociety or frowned upon by society for being who you are and your religious \nviews shouldn't even influence our laws as a society but Christian feel \nlike they are entitled to a lot of things they forget this country was \nfounded because of persecution. They came to this country for freedom and \nthen decided they'll impose their religious codes and morals on us. Just \nbecause you don't agree with it doesn't mean you have to voice it your \nreligious prejudice should stay to yourself cause you know what happens \nwhen have people who are like you and strongly believe this way we get the \nholocaust again. Not only that but if you are Christian you don't follow \nthe old testament because the new testament denounced the ways of the old \ntestament. In the new testament they are very vague on with the \ninterpretation of a lot of stuff because we are trying to take something \nthat was made a long time ago and translate it into our modern day context \nwithout realizing it has historically context you can't just change the \nhistorical context of everything to fit your modern day view.",

I've \nseen them very frequently, so I daresay I am strongly familiar with them.\n(Also, you shouldn't yell. All it does is, just like spanking, incite fear \nat a certain volume and show you have troubles upholding authority without \nusing it.)\nBy the way... kids don't become afraid of the consequences alone. They \nbecome afraid of the person as well. This isn't always obvious, as your \nchild won't quake in fear from just a couple times spanking, but it WILL \nmake the kid wary about you and feel MUCH less at home, Eventually, they \ntoo will most likely say that the spanking was alright, it's a normal \npsychological defense mechanism to cope with it and the fact the parents \nwere abusive, even if just mildly.\nOf course, educational measures aren't abuse, yet something like spanking \nby no means can be justified as such. You wanna know how I am able to keep \nmy cousins on a leash when it's needed? They look up to me as a person. \nI've been a role-model for them ever since. They respect me without me \nhaving to use any authority whatsoever. There's a major difference between \nhaving authority and using authority.\n\nThink of a good teacher and a bad teacher. A teacher supposedly is an \nauthority figure for the child and has some rights in terms of educational \nmeasures, though these are linked only to school. Some teachers just are \nable to keep a class's attention, some aren't. Thinking back at my school \ntime, I've had some teachers that had no trouble whatsoever getting back a \nclass's attention whilst others just couldn't. Same deal with parents. \nSpanking is no go-to excuse because you can't deal. I know quite a few \npeople that would never be able to raise a child... and I'm more than happy \nmost of them actually don't plan to.\n\nKids are kids and by nature, test the boundaries of rules. Which is a good \nthing and something many simply forget to do when they grow up. They are \ngonna break boundaries, that much is obvious and to be expected. They are \ngonna break rules in the process, some of which don't make sense, some of \nwhich can be forgiven. Is either of that a reason to spank a child?\n\nIn Finnland, your child can get taken away  even just at the rumour you \nmight have spanked your child... it's right that spanking is just wrong, \nbut that IS a little bit extreme. However still a true approach. I \npersonally would rather have them attend parental training. A child taken \naway from the parents unless they are truly abusive is the worst thing one \ncan do.",

I've actually gotten a lot softer and more understanding of \npsychopaths and sociopaths after hearing their stories.

It's NOT their faults that they are the way \nthey are. \n\nI am 100% aware of how extremely dangerous these men are, but we as a \nsociety have really shirked our responsibilities towards the mentally ill. \nPrison is not a substitute for asylums, medicine, study, and education. And \nuntil we as a society stop being lazy and selfish and start taking care of \nour own, we're never going to see a reduction in crime and violence. \n\nAs for the emotional binding of boys and men...nowhere will you find a more \nstark example of how damaging this is than prison. We brutalize men and \nboys, deny them compassion to toughen them up and make them hard, and \nprevent them from being allowed to express themselves with anything other \nthan anger...and we WONDER why some turn into dangerous violent cons? \n\nEveryone is responsible for their own actions...but that doesn't mean \nsociety isn't lazy and selfish and shirking its responsibilities to it's \nmembers.

                    "text": "From my experience working in the local courts as a transcriptionist and \nhearing a great deal from clinical psychologists called in for expert \ntestimony in cases of clinical sociopathy and psychopathy, I concur with \nwhat people have said that that it seems to be something to do with male \nbiology in cases like that. Generally every psychologist mentioned that \nthey didn't know absolutely for certain why these kinds of traits are more \nprevalent in men, just that they seem to have found a link between the \ngenetics of men that may make males far more prone to these diseases. Often \nchronically violent men have trouble with testosterone and hormone issues \nand they tend to calm down when chemically castrated or with use of other \ndrugs that help even out their fluctuations. \n\nThis has no inherent meaning on how we should consider men as a gender. \nIt's not bashing them to talk about it. There are a LOT of diseases that \nonly men or only women get. Like thyroid problems for example tend to show \nup much, much more commonly in women than in men. Same sort of thing. \n\nHOWEVER, it's very important to understand that there are many reasons WHY \nsomeone would want to kill multiple people and someone doesn't need to be \neither psychopathic or sociopathic for it to happen. For example, in my \ntown of Seattle there was a female serial killer by the name of Dr. Linda \nHazzard (I highly recommend looking her up if you're interested in serial \nkillers :) ) who was not either, but a woman who genuinely believed in her \nown quackery and had a love of money. She ended up accidently killing \nherself with her own treatment the way she used to kill others. ",

Tormenting/Killing someone weaker than them. \nNow, to show I'm not sexist, here's a few fun facts about women. As of \nrecent times, women have been increasing in strength since the 80's, & as \nof 2010 30% of the female populace of Russia, Canada, the US, & Mexico are \nstronger than an average 35 year old adult male.

                    "text": "+H Ritter Hello. Some people (can't be bothered to scroll up and find the \nnames, apologies) touched on some subjects to do with this. The differing \ntestosterone/ serotonin levels and the XYY chromosomes for eg, as well as \nthe early abuse and the nature vs. nurture debate. It's none and all of \nthese things. Male and female physiologies are different, including the way \nthat their brains work. I am generalising here. Men tend to have certain \nparts of their brain hardwired to respond to things differently- for \nexample, the parts of the human brain that recognise a threat tend to be \nmore sensitive in men than women, and usually elicits a more aggressive \nresponse which is the responsibility of another part of the brain. \nTestosterone plays a huge part in this. Women with high testosterone levels \ntend to be more aggressive (there was recently a study showing that drunk \nwomen became violent/ aggressive because the alcohol was raising their \ntestosterone levels). So, there are subtle differences in hormonal and \nneurological interplay here between men and women. Now the nurture part. \nThere are numerous schools of psychological thought here, but I'll try and \ngive a very brief overview. There's a stereotypical view of serial killers \nas having being brought up in houses with an overbearing abusive mother and \na distant or abusive father. There is some truth to this. As boys begin to \nmature and they awaken to sexual urges and the like, they are incredibly \nsensitive at this point. An incident that happens in these initial phases \ncan have long bearing influences on a mans sexual psyche. This is how many \nfetishes take life. If a parent were to catch the boy pleasuring himself, \nand make the child feel shame for his actions, punishing him, this is \nconsidered one of the key motivations for sexual based crimes. There are \nother indicators in childhood- the Macdonald triangle? Bedwetting (this is \ntied into the shame a child is made to feel) pyromania/arson (the discovery \nthat this act makes them feel powerful and important as they created and \ncontrolled it) and hurting animals/ younger children (again, the control \nover something, only a living thing, something that becomes their \n'plaything' which is too powerless to fight back) That is not to say that \neveryone who did any of these instantly becomes a serial killer, it is \nsimply a progression that, coupled and mixed with hundreds of other \nvariables, including the biolgical basis, can cause a person to become a \n'classic' serial killer, and these things tend to be more common in men \nthan women. So, nature vs. nurture = The genetics can set you up to be more \npredisposed to violence, and little incidents throughout a persons life can \naccumulatively add up before a trigger pushes you into full blown serial \nkiller mode. While women do sometimes become serial killers, the specifics \nthat lead to that tend to be more prevalent in men, with women more likely \nto commit other types of crimes, or commit serial murders for different \nmotivations. Feel free to reply back if you'd like to know more. I'd \nconsider myself to be a fairly informative source on this. If not, I hope \nthis has at least made for interesting reading. I'll stop there, I could go \non all day (in fact I did when I undertook this subject for a research \nproject) so apologies for the massively long comment!",

However although he is credited for 5 \nmurders, he was still a sick bastard who was loathsome and brutal. What he \ndid with Mary Jane Kelly for instance, the supposedly last and youngest of \nthe victims attributed to him, is quite revolting. He flayed off all the \nflesh off her face, her chest, her thighs, removed her heart, opened her \nabdomen, removed her uterus and everything near it, removed her ears, her \nnose, slashed her throat to near decapitation.. and even one of her arms \nwas only slightly attached to the body.. not to mention he deposited her \nflesh and organs throughout, on the bedside table...a breast was found \nunder her head, her kidney, between her feet... her heart never found. So \nyes... this murderous psycho may have only killed 5 but his methods were no \nless horrific. But the monsters on this list have a more lengthy list of \nvictims. ",

Bush idiocy. \n\n\nAmerica has been getting involved in a LOT of wars recently.\n\n\nNow before somebody crucifies me, I'm not trying to say America is \"the \nland of Demon Spawn\" or anything. Every country has done things that it's \nnot proud of. Canada (my homeland) had residential schools, where Native \nchildren were abused, and were forced to forget their heritage and adopt a \nEuropean way of thinking. China had a terrible famine partially caused by \ncommunist Mao Zedong where ~45 million people died. Also the Crusades, \nwhere Christianity and Islam literally tried to eradicate each other \nbecause both religions thought the other side \"was doing it wrong\" for \nhundreds of years.\n\n\nIn short, everyone should stop being a bunch of fuck-balls, and learn to \nlove one another.",

A mass murderer kills many \npeople in a single occurrence.  And most importantly, someone who kills a \nstring of people on one episode without picking the mantle back up later is \na spree killer.  For example: a man who kills three kids, takes a year off, \nthen kills a young girl is a serial killer.  Someone who kills seven \nfamilies at a church is a mass murderer; Someone who kills 8 girls over \nthree months is a spree killer.\nIt's important to know the difference :)",

The thing is that these are real people who were violently \nmurdered by psychotic men and you're playing it off like it's just a cute \nfake story that no one got hurt from.\n\nJeff the Killer, Slenderman, Paranormal Activity- those aren't real. That's \nfine. But what it sounded like you were saying basically was \"Oh, Ted Bundy \nwas cool! I'm glad he killed all those women.\" which comes off as \ninsensitive and cruel. (and that was just an example of what it sounded \nlike you said, not the actual thing. please don't reply to me saying \nsomething like \"I never said Ted Bundy!\" or anything..)\n\nNow, there's a difference between liking what the serial killers did and \nbeing intrigued by who the killers were and why they'd do such a horrible \nthing. Historians are interested in the history, they do not support the \nact themselves as a \"mere fun gore story\".\n\nBut, you know what? You can like serial killers if you want, you can be \nhappy they killed innocent people if you'd like. (It's you're life, no one \nhas control over you.)

Holmes is the alias used by Herman Webster Mudgett during much of his \ninfamous murder spree; it is estimated that he may have killed two to three \nhundred people between 1886 and 1894, most of them during the Chicago \nWorld's Fair in 1893.  He built a block-long three story hotel over a drug \nstore that has been dubbed the \"Murder Castle\" and included secret \npassages, rooms he could seal off and gas, vats of acid, abattoirs, and a \nthriving business selling the bones and cadavers of his victims to medical \nschools, hospitals, and research centers.  He was also a thorough liar and \ncon artist, and thus it is difficult to know how much of what he claimed \nwas true or not.  Only 9 deaths were confirmed, and he confessed to 27, but \nthere were indications of far more victims, particularly based on records \nof disappearances and other trace evidence.",
