Later we also \nseem Plum's true power, but ONLY after no one's around to see it. And ontop \nof that she lies about it. There's more to Plum than meets the eye and \nthat's what I love about this series. You THINK its all just a random mess \nof things, but when you actually try to look at you realize all events up \nuntil now have served some greater purpose and the writers are really good \nat introducing us to things early and using very effective foreshadowing.",
