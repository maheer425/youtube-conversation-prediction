My answer was that 1: It is none of my \nbusiness 2: Homosexuality is no excuse to not come to Christ and be \nembraced with the love only God can give.\n\nIgnorance and intolerance just leads to more of the same on each side. \n Donahue fights against something, but it his own personal war, because if \nit is God's will that homosexuality be fought against, he will do so.  It \nis a Christian's duty to spread the love of word of god, not exclude and \ncondemn others because we feel they don't deserve it.  On the flip side, \nresponding with Leviticus and challenging someone's beliefs with responses \nthat are just meant to be damaging is wrong.  I want safety and assurance \nfor all people, homosexual or otherwise.\n\nIf anyone reads this comment, please remember that we are all sinners. \n Everything must be brought before God, no one else.  It will not be a man \nthat judges us for our lives, and so no ones judgement can be absolute on \nearth.  The one and only sin that can never be forgiven is knowing God, \nknowing love, and turning away.\ufeff",

I would contend there is no contradictions in the Bible, and \non that I am not here to argue with you.  Everyone is entitled to their own \nbeliefs and the liberty to share those beliefs.  I agree with you, even now \nI watch atheist videos about Christianity and lately I feel a calling about \nthe hypocrisy in our Churches today, about those who twist the message and \nuse it to fill their own selfish agendas.  These need to be called out, the \nhateful messages need to be shown for what they are, and the perversion of \nthe word of God must end.\n\nWhat I am saddened to see is people considered leaders of the Church being \nthe impression of Christians as a whole.  There are people who will spout \nBible verses at others, thinking that this is how you spread the word of \nGod.  I have been guilty of this a few times in my life, and it has never \nworked out well.  I am excited and zealous of my faith in God, I know for a \nfact he works in my life, and I am happy with what God provides for me. \n\nThat happiness didn't come from being judgmental, spitting hellfire and \nbrimstone at the non believers.  It came from LISTENING to EVERYONE, \npraying to God to let him use me to help anyone I can, and through God and \nthe teachings of Christ I better those around me by the way I live my life. \n It will be God that opens his arms to any who come to him through Christ, \nnot me or anyone else on this Earth.  Man is the reason for hypocrisy and \nhateful debates of this world, not God.  The only way to change this world \nand uproot the evil is to change ourselves, and so doing change all around \nus like a ripple in a pond.\n\nI hope you know that I pass no judgement on you, TYT or The Catholic \nLeague.  I only pray for those stuck in the vicious cycle of hate and \noffense that so easily takes us all at times.  God has shown me grace, and \nI have seen it as pure love and a beautiful gospel to share with all I can.",

                    "text": "Easy. The Torah is a polytheistic text, and if you learn a bit about \nMesopotamian and Babylonian history you can prove it. Noah's ark is a story \nthat was plagiarized from the myths of the Babylonians (read the Eridu \nGenesis and epic of Atrahasis) and Jews weren't even 100% monotheist at the \ntime the Torah was written. In fact, certain Hebrew words that still exist \ntoday were originally the names of Sumerian gods. Take for example the word \nShamash. In the context of modern Hebrew it means the candle of the \nhanukiah that you use to light the other candles, correct? Shamash was \noriginally the name of the Sumerian god of the sun about 5000 years ago. \nThat's around 2000 years before the ancient nations of Judah and Israel \neven existed. Once again, during the Babylonian exile the ancient Judeans \n(Jews) came into direct contact with Babylonian mythology. The Babylonians \nutilized a very large amount of the Sumerian religion in their own myths \nand legends. The epic of Atrahasis I mentioned above, for example, is taken \nfrom the older Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh. In the case of certain gods such \nas Shamash (and I am using Shamash as an example specifically),  the \nBabylonians often times wouldn't even bother to change the names of their \ngods from the Sumerian name. If Even modern Hebrew still contains clear \ntraces of polytheism, as does the Torah itself with stories like that of \nmoses smashing the ten commandments after seeing his people praying to the \ngolden bull idol, then it should be painfully obvious that other sections \nof the Torah (like leviticus which condemns homosexuality or the part that \ncondones slavery which I think was in deuteronomy but I'm not quite sure) \nshould not be taken literally. In fact you could argue that if there truly \nis one god (assuming you aren't an atheist like me) and the Torah is \nlittered with polytheist influences, classifying the Torah as a holy book \nthat is literally true is effectively polytheism which, obviously, would \ncontradict the concept of monotheism modern Judaism is founded upon. You \ncould thus go so far as to suggest that someone truly Jewish shouldn't \nconsider the Torah as a law book at all but rather as a hybrid text \ncontaining both mythology and fragments of the history of the Jewish \npeople. If the book is no longer observed as a law book, there's no longer \nany reason to take leviticus seriously. If you're interested in the various \nother links between Sumerian, Babylonian and Jewish religion, you should do \na bit of further research. There are in fact other connections between them \nthat I have not listed here.",

Over those years, like you, I was taught many things that later I \ndiscovered were not necessarily the case. For instance, I was taught that \nthe Roman Catholic Church is the only true church. All the Protestant \nchurches were basically going to hell. \n\nWith regards to homosexuality, it in itself is not sinful. One cannot \ncontrol how one's body responds to another sexually. One's sexual response \nis part of the autonomic nervous system and is involuntary. However, it is \nthe selfish engagement in sexual activity that is sinful, whether it is \nheterosexual or homosexual. The key word is selfish. I believe that \nselfishness is original sin because all other sins stem from it. Maybe \nbring this up with your teachers in class. It would be a good discussion \ntopic.\n\nAs to the Old Testament, it came down through the ages primarily in oral \ntraditions. Some were written in scrolls but mostly by word of mouth. Have \nyou ever played that group game where you tell something to the person next \nyou and that person 'repeats' it to the next person, etc until it comes \nback to you? What comes back you rarely is what it started out to be. That \nis what one can visualize when reading the Old Testament and some of the \nNew Testament. Jesus told us that He came to fulfil the OT. Let's just take \nour cue from Him and His teachings and example. We can't go wrong.\n\nWe have to decide for ourselves what is right and go with the conscience \nthat God gave us.\n\nGod bless.",
