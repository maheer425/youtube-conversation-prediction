This is the internet, we = everybody = also \npeople in China and 200 other countries. I do not remember China being in \nthe war for one and a lot of other countries (including my own) were \nneutral.\n\nIf I am not wrong in thinking you are referring to the US, then it was \nbecause they had let France and the UK buy a tone of industrial war goods \non loan, and if they lost the war, then the US would get no payment on \nthese loans. And on top of that some stupid propaganda about (1) Lusitania \n(although it did not start until month after the sinking, because now it \nhad become good propaganda and not bad propaganda) and (2) after the \nRussian February revolution (not the Red one in October of their calendar, \nthe white one) some started arguing that it was a war between liberty and \ntyranny.\n\nBut basically it was about money. And when the war ended the USA went from \nthe most underrated power in the world, to be viewed the most \nimportant both in term of money and power.\n\nWar is always only about money and power. The American Revolutionary War of \nIndependence only succeeded because they had help from France and Spain in \nblockading the British. The only interests of France and Spain was a new \ntrading partner and to kick some British butt.\n\nAnd the whole revolution thing became a bit of a problem for the French \nking not many years later. I even ended in him having major and permanent \nneck surgery. So freedom and democracy is now a goal in war, but it is \noften a bi-product of postwar stabilisation.\n\nAnd on topic: In WWI there were no good or bad guys, just many power, \nstates and nations with many different goals and aspirations. The \nassassination was the trigger, but the point of no return was in 1912, when \nGermany decided that it needed a war with Russia soon or Russia would \nbecome to strong for Germany to ever have a chance against (Russia had just \nstarted industrialization at this time and was catching up to Germany, \nwhile Russia had a lot more people, land and resources than anyone else in \nEurope) . Germany wanted a war and that is why Austria got a blank check, \nand if they had not then in the 1920's or 1930's Russia would have become a \ncontinental hegemon. And a second Crimean War would not have done a lot of \ngood if attempted. Germany saved Europe from Russia in two world wars, but \nwent about doing it in such terrible ways that very few feel comfortable \nacknowledging it today.\n\nAnd in the Balkans everything was chaos, as it has always been and always \nwill be. Learn to love the beauty in the chaos, pick your favourites (if \nthey were not picked by your passport), and enjoy.\nSerbia for one is an awesome place.",

Sorry for correcting you but in \nthat time, if you said that \"black hand\" (Crna ruka) wanted a \"greater \nserbia\", you would probably get shot by the same group or it's followers. \nTheir goal was unitig serbia, bosnia, croatia and slovenia with expansion \nto places now known as macedonia and montenegro. The kingdom of SCS or \nlater known as Yugoslavia. Great Serbia was introduced in 1990's when that \nidiot** Sheshelj (\u0160e\u0161elj)* came to power. \n*not officiall power\n**let's not discuss if this guy is idiot or not. \ufeff",

They contrast each other like black and white.\n\nThe first pan-Slavists (and inventors of Yugoslavia) were the 16th-century \nCroatian writer Vinko Pribojevi\u0107 and the 17th-century Croatian Catholic \nmissionary Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107. The catholic priest was the one who actually \ntook the ideology from radical writings and kick-started the Yugoslav \nmovement.\n\nCroatians invented Yugoslavia and Croatians suggested the idea to the \nFrench at the end of the Great War that they should unify with the Serbs. \nThis is partly why France supported the creation of a Yugoslav state so \nstrongly. Croatians wanted to unify with the Serbs! They had a referendum!\n\nAlso FYI Serbia had the most multi-ethnic and multi-religious governments \nin the early 20th century in Europe and still is relatively diverse today.\nThe fact that there were a few corrupt politicians does not mean the system \ndidn't function and that Serbs and Croatians on a social level couldn't \ncooperate. Serbs in Krajina in Croatia have been mixing with Croatians for \nover a millennium!\n\nThe fact that you made the comment that you did makes me cast doubt on how \nmuch research and fact there is behind what you said.\n\nFinally it is NOT the west's perspective that Princip was a radical \nmilitant nationalist who felt sorry for himself and wanted fame. Thats YOUR \nopinion. Making bold statements like that makes me wonder if you have a \nbias?\n\nAnyway i hope i managed to educate you a bit on what history books say and \nnot your drunk racist uncle at the dinner table. I hope when you grow out \nof being a teenager you will be more culturally aware. Good luck to you i \nhope i managed to enlighten you on something.",

First the Versailles treaty pissed of the Germans, and \nthen the Wall Street crash that ruined the international economy and sent \nGermany back into depression, which meant the Germans had their final straw \nof democracy (there was also the far left, that was anti-democratic, which \nhad about 1/4 to 1/3 of the vote towards the end of the Weimar Republic).\n\nThe First World War was for us today a good war.

                    "text": "+AccentedGamer Haha thanks. Well I can give you an example of how nations \nthought of others as lesser sure:\n\nRussia was seen by Germany and most of the other European Powers as \nbarbaric, backwards, and not up to par with the rest of the nations. This \nwas only slightly true. Russia was certainly less industrialized than say \nGermany but they were catching up fast (Finished the Trans-Siberian \nRailroad in 1916 for example). Germany wanted to become the powerhouse of \nEurope and the high German command saw a war with Russia in the near \nfuture. \n\nAustria-Hungary was a mixed bag. It was a very diverse state. Ethnic \nAustrians saw themselves as being the greatest especially when compared to \ntheir Slavic Balkan counterparts (Like the Serbians). Austria-Hungary \nthought that they would crush Serbia in the war and that there was no way \nSerbia could hold out against their great army. In actuality Serbia fought \noff against numerous attacks and it wasn't until Bulgaria, and Germany \nhelped out with yet another Serbia/Montenegro invasion that Serbia was \nwiped out. \n\nFrance and the United Kingdom had a longstanding rivalry. They, with \nRussia, were allies in the Triple Entente but this doesn't mean they really \nliked eachother. Actually researchers has found documents stating that the \ntwo had plans for invading one other before World War 1 began. England (UK, \nI'm just gonna refer to it as England cause it's easier) was only allied \nwith France, whom they didn't really like, and Russia their \"All time \nRival) because the German Navy was the only one strong enough to attack \nEngland.\n\nGermany was scene as savages in the Entente powers during war time. A lot \nof anti-German propaganda pictured the Germans as barbaric apes with simple \nminds. In actuality the Germans was a major cultural and economic \npowerhouse before World War 1. Something many of the other European powers \nstrongly admired.\n\nNationalism is a mixed idea. It can give people pride in ones country but \nit also makes countries see themselves as the ultimate country. No other \ncountry is worthy of being compared and that was no more evident than in \nthe years following World War 1.\n\nAs for specifically Franz Ferdinand's sense of Nationalistic pride I would \nsuggest reading a Biography on him as I don't know too much on his personal \nbeliefs as a whole.\n\nWhat I do know about Franz Ferdinand was that he was one of the few \nAustrian High Command that didn't want a war with Russia and was willing to \nprevent one at all costs. He knew that the Slavic pride between Russia and \nSerbia was strong. He still saw the Slavic people as backwards (Many people \ndid) but he knew that Austria would most likely be crushed in a war against \nRussia. ",

Reason for that is to weak Serbian people and to \nconvince them to stand against Milo\u0161evi\u0107 but they made counter effect (I \neven remember flayers which NATO throw from the airplanes saying that \n\"Clinton is with you\" and \"NATO protecting innocents\" so local people \nmostly use them like a toilet paper and to burn them on the street lol). On \nthe ground Serbian army beat UCK terrorist very fast, so most of them run \nto the forests attacking local non-protected villages, police patrols and \ncars on the roads from time to time (there were couple of battles with \nmilitary but they do not have logistic and machines like Serbs so they were \nalways retreating). Main battles were close to the border line with Albania \nwhere Serbian army keep the same position all 78 days and that line was \nconstantly bombed every day + attacked from the Albanian terrorists from \nthe other side without succeed because of smart tactic (it is mountain \nterrain with lot of places to hide and I already told you about fake makets \nwhich Serbian army made so bombs hitting the fake tanks, airplanes, canons \ncouple of times per day). Serbian army win the war on the ground in that \ntime but Milo\u0161evi\u0107 give a signature to resolution 1244 because he was \nscared that if bombing continue Serbia will be complete destroyed in the \nnext phase of bombing (some of west politicians say in direct talk to him \nthat they will start with carpet bombing if he do not sing that agreement). \nRest things after that are history and today we have this situation on the \nBalkan.\n\nFor other things lets wait the time and we will see what will happen in the \nfuture. I personally think that EU will broke on couple of parts or \ncomplete disappear depend of what will decide hugest players like Germany \nand France in the future. China will start central rule in world economy \n(even today they will soon kick USA out of the game). Russia will be weak \nfor couple of years but I think that they will use this time to search \nalternative markets before EU change their opinion (Putin is very smart \nleader no matter what on the west say about him).\n\nP.S. One of the game that I will always very well remember is Partizan - \nLazio (2:3) on 1998. That was a great football back in the days and that \nmatch stay like a something really special till this days for me especially \nfirst goal by Mladen Krstaji\u0107 (even if I was a kid in that time).",

                    "text": "+Rogy N Please in the future right in paragraph, it makes it a lot easier \nto read, as it is clearer when you are switching subtopic...\n\nThe bombings were against the Serbian military. Therefore you not only bomb \nit in Kosovo, but all over Serbia. If there is a bridge 200 km north of \nKosovo that is part of a supply line, then you bomb that. If there is a TV \nstation that is offering strategic communication in cooperation with the \nmilitary, then that is a lawful military target. This is all very much a \nquestion of how much the directly or indirectly supported the war effort, \nand a very many civilian things support a war effort in ways that you do \nnot directly think about. I could make up 10 different reasons, for why it \nwould be okay to bomb a TV station, but I do not know the reasoning at the \ntime, so I am not going to speculate.\n\nNow what you hit is not important. It is what you try to hit. And war \ncrimes is nothing new to the West (Dresden is a good example). But still \nthere is no evidence of \"intent\" (this is what matters legally), so until \nyou can prove intent, then nothing wrong was done. You can have theories, \nbut until you can prove anything, then your theories have no values.\n\nThe 4 big baddies are not countries, people or something like that, they \nare the worst breaches to international law that all states are obligated \nto do something about. Which is also why Serbia (although it should have \nbeen Yugoslavia) was guilty of failing to prevent genocide, as all states \nhave an obligation to take action to prevent genocide. Which actually means \nthat when Milosevic knew that the situation was out of control in \nSrebrenica (which there is evidence supporting that he knew, exactly what \nwas going on, but was not in command or control of it) it was his legal \nobligation to do anything to prevent genocide, which in this case would \nhave been to notify NATO commanders of what was going on (which effectively \nwould have meant treason in the eyes of Serbians).\n\nI did not watch the specific cases, as I do not have a personal interest in \nthe specifics... And I have some issues with some aspects of international \ncriminal law. Also why I did not take an electorate course we have in my \nmasters called \"Prosecution of War Crimes\", and I kept making the joke of \ncalling the course \"Persecution\" instead of \"Prosecution\"... But that is \nnot going to make me care about the specific cases. It might be that not \neveryone in the Hague is guilty, but no one of them are completely innocent.\n\nNow do not forget that both the wars also very much had a geopolitical \nprofile. Serbia bet on Russia, and there was and still is a grand strategy \nof reducing Russia's Western influence to zero. Serbia picked a really \nstupid time to challenge Western hegemony. If the Kosovo War had been after \nMilosevic and 9/11, then you could have shut those Albanians up for \ngood....... Solving the East-West divide is mostly about Russia accepting \nthe reality of things. They need to make friendly arrangements with \nneighbours instead of relying on threats to protect Russia minorities and \nenter into the European community. And to me that actually means Russia \njoining the EU and NATO, but lets just wait a few decades before that is \ngoing to happen.\n\nAlso remember that double standards are a natural part of any political and \nmilitary campaign. The truth is in people's nature, and not in what they \nsay... And in a time of war a lot of things are very different from \neveryday life. Liberal (Western) values are about ideals, and trying to \nreach as much freedom for the individual as possible, but when you go to \nwar over those ideals, they often become strained at home...\n\nYes, I am a huge Lazio fan... I might not have been able to see the Serbia \nperspective in this, if it was not for the actions of Stankovic and \nespecially Mihajlovic back then...",

                    "text": "+bloodlazio With this words which you wrote \"bombing civilians is perfectly \nacceptable, if you also hit something of military value\" you just confirm \nmy theory that NATO generals should be sent on international court for \ncrimes that they made. In the most of actions which I mention NATO actually \ndid not hit ANY military value object MOSTLY civilian objects and people \nthat standing FAR AWAY from the Kosovo war zone. You will also agree with \nme that freedom of speech is important part of EU culture (and most of the \nNATO states). We saw whats happen now in France with this terrorist attack \nwhen 10 journalist were killed? Let me remember you that the same NATO who \n\"defending freedom of speech\" strike official Serbian TV station in the \nmiddle of Belgrade killing the 16 Serbian journalist in 1999 (this building \nstill standing like that in Belgrade I would be really glad to show you if \nyou anytime visit the city). So conclusion is that NATO and western values \nactually do not respect themselves and their own values and that they have \ndouble standards for their own interest (like you said, 4 big baddies can \ndo whathewer they wont unfortunately). About international court I see that \nyou are good informed and I must say you are one of the rare people on the \ninternet which have very good knowledge about many things. I have a \nquestion for you also. Did you watch any Hague processes live on TV, \nInternet and so on ? Here we had it live from varius cases and what I saw \nthere is that they let free for example Croatian General Gotovina even if \nthey have crucial proof  + many civilian witnesses (that proof is recorded \ntalk from the meeting that Gotovina and Tudjman had before action Storm \nabout how they should clean area from all the Serbs and kick them out of \nthe country which by the way they did at the end). Now around 250 000 Serbs \nfrom Croatia after war living in Serbia. Everyone know that USA support \naction storm in which Serbs were forced to leave Croatia so if they charge \nthem then all those things which they set to this action will fall down in \nthe water. Also Serbian general Perisic (who is by the way captured in \nSerbia after the war in the middle of the street with an CIA agent in the \nmoment when he giving to him some important documents and after USA urgent \nthat they let him out of police) was free in Hague even if everyone know \nthat he was very responsible for many war crimes. About Naser Oric case I \ndo not wont even to speak because proofs what he made with his Islam army \nin Bosnia you can find even today in the villages which they burned and on \nthe internet with all videos, pictures and stuff (how I remember they wrote \nsomething like yea they did some war crimes, there is even pictures with \nhim and others standing by burned Serbian civilian areas but there is not \nenough proof to punish him). Seselj case is specific and I am not his fun \nat all but what he made in Hague is a shame to international law because he \nalone shown that he know better law and documentation then any judgments of \nthe court, joking them all how they do not know basics of international \nlaw, history and so on... This man alone succeed to defend himself for 12 \nYEARS! Even Carla del Ponte wrote in her book that someone stole lot of \nimportant proofs from Hague documentation (just imagine international \ntribunal and someone can do those things?), also that most of witnesses on \nKosovo which were \"protected\" in cases against Albanian commanders were \nkilled, that some of judgments have a pressure from different sides to \nbring decisions and so on... For someone this court maybe will have some \nvalue but for me it will always stay like an political tribunal and nothing \nmore. Serbia is fault because till this time have pro-western poltronic \ngovernment which is scared to push those stuffs against their \"friends\" in \nthe name of EU integrations (so again here you are complete right and I \nagree with you because no one will looking for our rights if we do not look \nit for ourselves). Lets finish this discussion with a better future and I \nhope that whole Balkan will have it with more peace and prosper. Serbia \ntoday is like it is but I hope we will be more smarter then in the past. \nAlso hope that we will this time be enough smart not to go in EU (where \nthey force us to go unfortunately) and in NATO or on other side to go to \nEast because we need to be country on the crossroad that will made \nconnections between East and West not sided one.

And knowing well that you are bombing civilians is perfectly \nacceptable, if you also hit something of military value (it is a bit more \ncomplex than that, but that is essentially how the rules are).\n\nYour point about \"USA players\" at the end makes no sense in the context...\n\nInternational law is not a joke. A lot of countries put a lot of focus on \nit. After the ICJ case Serbia apologised for failing to stop the genocide \nin Srebrenica (although Serbia is not legally the continuation of \nYugoslavia). But there is the fundamental problem in issues of \n\"International Peace and Security\" (the specific and very important wording \nin the UN Charter), where essentially the UN is obligated to react, but \nsometimes certain countries (Russia and China) veto such actions, therefore \nthere is a legal question if there exists a \"Responsibility to Protect\" \n(which was the idea behind the Kosovo intervention) or not, and that is \nstill not decided (for or against). Russia has though used an R2P argument \nin Georgia in 2008, so even the sceptical countries are not completely \nagainst it.\n\nInternational law is just like any other law up to interpretation. Russia \nsees some things one way, America sees them in another, and far from all \ncountries have ratified the same treaties, so very few things are illegal \nfor everyone. Except the 4 big baddies: aggression (war for territorial \ngains), war crimes (Geneva conventions), crimes against humanity, and \ngenocide.\n\nSerbia decided on their own to drop having a case before the ICJ on NATO \ncarrying out an intervention without a UN mandate (aid apparently was more \ninteresting). That is why no Western country has been held responsible, and \npost intervention a UN resolution legitimized the intervention.\n\nNow before ICTY the cases have been taking forever. As I understand it is \nbecause the evidence in such cases is very problematic, as proving who did, \nknew of, and ordered what is difficult to prove. One of my professors was \nthe Danish judge at ICTY (though it was not a course on ICTY), and well he \ndid not change my mind about a potential discourse against Serbia. But I \nhave seen no evidence that anyone not guilty was put in jail, and not had a \nfair chance to defend themselves and cases can take very long, when you \n(like \u0160e\u0161elj) also have contempt of court cases that need to be handled... \nIf someone is actually guilty, but there is not enough evidence, then they \nstill do not go to jail. But well there is a huge difference between \ninternational criminal law and public international law... International \ncriminal law is still in its infancy and therefore not functioning as well \nas it should. But before an international court or tribunal it is not \nstrange that cases take many years to complete.\n\nAs things are now, nothing on this can change, and the most important part \nof that is Serbia not pushing it. I completely understand and respect your \nposition, but it feels like you unfortunately are a bit stuck in the \nhistorical Serbian narrative.\nA lot of things have changed in the last 100 years after national \nself-determination became important after the end of WWI (but not really \ngot into effect until after the collapse of the Soviet Union and \nYugoslavia), and today Serbia is choosing its own path, no one is forcing \nthem into anything, but if you challenge the powers, then there will always \nbe consequences. Looking forward and building a better future for Serbia is \nmore important than the past. Especially if we want to limit the influence \nof political islam in Europe...",

And not all bombs are smart bombs as \nthat is financially impossible. So most munitions used are classic dumb \nbombs which can fly far off their target. And where there no military \ntargets in Ni\u0161? Remember bridges, power plants and other elements of \ninfrastructure that in any way can support a military force is a military \ntarget. It is not just about actual military personel, vehicles and units. \nBecause as you rightly pointed out, they are a lot easier to hide than \nsomething fixed (buildings, bridges etc.).\n\nMistakes happen a lot in war and many civilians die... 500 confirmed and at \nmost 5000 suspected civilian casualties in a 2-3 week bombing campaign is \nextremely low. Calling 15 deaths in one case a lot is completely \ndisproportional with the realities of war... If it was not for skilled \nairmanship and accuracy of the weapons used, you should have expected a \ncivilian death toll in the tens of thousands...\n\nBombing cities with cluster bombs was not illegal. There is a long ethical \ndebate on it, but by the standards that Kosovo, Serbia and the rest of the \nWorld have accepted that is not even close to the scope of the atrocities \ncarried out by both sides inside of Kosovo.\n\nThat the operation never should have happened is the relevant point, but I \nwould like you to carry out such an air campaign with fewer civilian deaths \nwith the technology of the day. Unless you can prove beyond reasonable \ndoubt in a court of law that the individual bombs was intentionally dropped \nto hit a non-military target with the purpose of killing civilians, then \nyou have no argument for anything but logical collateral damage in time of \nwar (both the pilot and the officers designing the mission knew they where \nmurdering civilians).\n\nAnd if you want to know, why Serbia was bombed, then it was because \nMilosevic decided not to follow the International Community, but do his own \nthing (since Srebrenica the whole of the West was just looking for an \nexcuse, and we got it in Kosovo). And yes, at that time what the US and \nEurope said was the International Community was the International \nCommunity, as the end of the Cold War had made the US the worlds single \nsuperpower and even stronger than that with allies (which is not the case \nany more, the US is not that powerful on its own any more).\n\nIf Milosevic and his system had been forced out earlier, then you would \nhave started of with a clean slate. Kosovo should never have been taken \nfrom you, but really it is your own fault that you lost it. Milosevic tried \nto play big politics and he lost.\n\nAnd you can make a million arguments about the other sides, it is a \ndisgrace that so few have been taken to The Hague over the crimes against \nSerbians... There are many criminals that still need to be brought to \njustice over the Yugoslavian and Kosovo Civil Wars... But a big issue is \nthe lack of evidence and the perceived bias against Serbia. You lost the \nmedia war, which is often more important than the actual war, and in both \ncases the Bosniaks and Albanians managed to win it, losing a war is one \nthing losing the perception of who was right and wrong is a lot bigger of a \nproblem. If you want Serbia to be treated justly, then you have to \nobjectively prove that the others were just as bad, and that is before and \ninternational court... Because all the evidence points to Serbia being a \nlot worse than all the other sides of the conflict (and therefore \nunreasonable measures was taken to punish Serbia as a result).",

Write the date on google and you will see \nall the videos and pictures from that day (NATO next day wrote for the news \nthat it was a \"mistake\" like many times before). Whats happen in Srebrenica \nis a huge war crime massacre but not Genocide (by the way Serbia officially \njudged this massacre in national parlament and Serbia send all the people \nwhich were responsible for that to the court, even on local ones so those \npeople are now in jail and will be for many years while other states like \nBosnia, Croatia, and fake Kosovo keep their criminals in political parties \nwhich are still active today). At Kosovo there was lot of small massacres \nmade by both Serbian and Albanian sides but nothing was even close to any \nkind of Genocide. There were also lot of refugees on Serbian and Albanian \nside during the NATO bombing of course depend on the place where fightings \nwere and also where NATO throwing their bombs (NATO killed also not only \nSerbs but and many Albanians during the bombing so Albanian politicians now \ncan not speak about that since USA give to them fake \"independent\" Kosovo). \nAfter the war all the Albanians come back to their homes while Serbs were \nalways kicked out when they tried to come back. After NATO arrived on \nKosovo almost all the Serbs from the South of Kosovo which survived till \nthat time were forced to leave their homes because of constant attack from \nthe local Albanian groups which burn their villages, shotting and scaring \nthem with the guns, kidnap the local people, torturing them, planting the \nbombs under the buses and houses, destroying Churches from medieval times, \ngraveyards, attacking Serbian children that were playing next to the river \nand most horrific of all taking their organs when they were still alive for \nselling (of course till today they do not judge anyone for all of this war \ncrimes even if Dick Marty made resolution in EU parlament in 2010 spotting \nthe Hashim Tachi (today fake Kosovo prime minister) like the central war \ncriminal who organize drug and organ export, but this guy is still there \nlike a USA politic puppet)!

The US, Israel, Russia, and others have not ratified it, so \nit is legal for them to use. So using Cluster munitions in 1999 was not \nillegal if it was against a target of \"military necessity\" and carried out \nin the most \"proportional\" manner to still take out the military target. \nPretty much everything else I completely agree with, the problem was that \nMilosevic did not cooperate with the UN force in Bosnia, and therefore the \nSerb side was never represented, where it should have been heard, and it \nwas too easy for Bosnians and Albanians to make false allegations of \ngenocide (genocide did happen both in Bosnia and Kosovo at Serb hands, but \nlong after the allegations of genocide started).\n\nIt would have been a lot better if we could have had a common front against \nthe jihadists in the 1990's for everyones sake.",

                    "text": "+Frank White I do not argue the history is written by the winners thing. \nThe problem about understanding even WWII is we do not have access to the \nRussian archives. When Barbarossa started the Russians where in what seemed \nlogically offensive positions and there is some talk about Germany maybe \nhave saved Europe for an coming Russian invasion... But 14 days that saved \nthe world is not exactly written by pillars in the historic community. But \nif it is true (which would not be off compared to how Stalin was going \nabout things), then you might want to start thinking about Nazi Germany as \nnot just the bad guys.\n\nFrom my perspective good and evil are term for narrow minded people who are \nunable to understand the nuances of human beings.\n\nBritain and France did not go to war for their love of Poland, there was \nnothing noble about it. They did so because they knew they would have to. \nThey created the monster through the Versailles treaty (although not really \nrelevant by 1933, the damage had been done in the eyes of the German \npopulation). They were fixing their own mess that they should never have \nmade to begin with.\n\nAmerica entered the war because they entered into an oil embargo on Japan \nthat forced Japan to war (which the US well knew). They just needed a \nlittle Pearl Harbour to get the population on for the whole war thing.\n\nThere will always be someone who suffered at the people you see as the \ngood. Intentionally creating a firestom (something that in of it self \nserved no military purpose) over Dresden was a war crime, but for some \nreason neither the British or the Americans had the balls to put Le May and \nHarry in front of a firing squad.\n\n\"War does not determine who is right - only who is left.\"\nBertrand Russell\n\nOn the Balkans: Does that book take into account the bosniaks massacred by \ncroats? Or later on Serbian in Kosovo being harvested for organs? There is \nenough blame to go around, and the problem is not the different \nperspectives it is the lack of responsibility being taken on all sides. And \nthis is not just about Yugoslavia, it is the same all over the Balkans. \nPeace comes when people give up their pride, and that is probably never \nhappen in the Balkans, because many have very little more than their pride.\n\nMy core point is that you only have the sources you have access to. You \nhave a lot more than from 500 years ago, but you still do not have the most \nimportant ones as they are locked up in archives as long as they have a \nrelevance in the politics of today. And even if two people have access to \nthe same sources they will prioritize them different and have different \nbaggage. We are humans, we attribute value to things and mostly other \nhumans. To understand history we structure our knowledge, which means when \nwe make our first prioritizations, then we often forge a part that we only \ndeviate slightly from when gaining new sources, as we know that no sources \nare objective.\n\nAnother source aspect is that primary sources rarely get translated, so you \nare reading a lot of secondary sources that have original sources in a \nlanguage you cannot read, and therefore a lot (if not most of you \ninformation for most people) has already gone through at least one \ninterpretation before you get to look at it.\n\nSo really, we do not know that much as individuals. History is not about \ntruth, and it has never been about truth. Humans are terrible at \nunderstanding truth. Even in science where they get close to objective \ntruth, often the human element ruins it. History is about the human element \nand those humans' (or states') perceptions of the reality they were in. In \nunderstanding ourself past self we understand our present.\n\nI strongly disagree with the whole notion of facts and truth. If facts were \nto prevalent in history, how come for 50 years no one said anything about \nhow 4 million jew where supposedly killed in Auschwitz, while 6 million \nwhere killed in total, and most where killed by einsatzgruppen. History is \nabout emotions and perceptions. No one wants a good story (or as per my \nexample: a sad story) ruined by normative \"facts\", which in reality are \nsubjective interpretations that a lot of people happen to agree on for a \nwide variety of reasons.\n\nI remember in a method class (studying history) my professor saying:\nQuestion everything... [*pause*] eh except the Holocaust.\n\nOnes you have exceptions to anything between you and objectivity (which \nincludes your own brains interpretation of information), the you are not \ndealing in facts. And it is a massive problem for the understanding of \nhistory, when people forget that facts are irrelevant, and that the subject \nis not about understanding the past, it is about understanding yourself and \nhow you see the world. The is why history is in the humanities department \nand it still confuses social scientists (my minor and now my masters).\n\nMore meta and methodology would be nice in Crash Course History, but it \nwould probably scare of the intended audience...",

So in some sense it was more personally impactful on the \n\"opinion makers\" of the time.",

I can't find separate numbers for French colonies in \nWW1, but since apart from those invaded by Japan they sat most of WW2 out, \nI think it's safe to say they mostly suffered more in WW1 too.\nThe numbers from Austria/Hungarian empire cannot be compared due to it's \nbreakup, and Austrian figures being counted as part of the German figures \nfor WW2.

                    "text": "+adamarimba\n\n\nWell just off the top of my head from what i can remember him saying some \ntime ago \n\n1. Princip was NOT part of The Black Hand, he was part of the Young-Bosnia \nmovement. These are two distinctly separate organisations with different \ngoals and different compositions. I don't know how well informed you are on \nthe situation but this is not opinion this is a fact. Comparing The Black \nHand to the Young-Bosnia movement is like comparing apples to oranges. The \nonly Similarity the two groups have is literally the fact that they both \nhave Serbs, though one is exclusively Serb and the other isn't. \nIf you would like me to you can request me to write you up a detailed \nexplanation of their differences and what they are about.\nOne thing i would like to mention now is that the assassins were \npro-yugoslav, regardless of its form. They had nothing to do with the \nconcept of Greater Serbia, which concept didn't even exist back then. I'll \ngo further into this later in my post.\n\n2. He implies The Black Hand and the Serbian government were practically \nthe same thing and went together like peanut butter and jelly. This is \nfalse. The two had almost nothing to do with each other. Yes some \nindividuals far and few between from the government might've been members \nof the Black Hand and many sympathetic but calling them two peas in a pod \nis a gross exaggeration. The Black Hand and the Serbian government's \nrelationship is comparable to the Masons in The U.S.A. and the United \nStates Government, maybe less so. Conspiracy Theories aside the two in both \ninstances have nothing to do with each other really.\n\n3. The Serbs accepted the entire ultimatum but the Austrians attacked anyway\n\n4. He called Gavrilo Princip a terrorist. I cannot begin to to emphasis how \nbiased, narrow sighted, myopic, and derogatory that is and even somewhat \nracist that statement is. You only need to read the comments section to \nunderstand but if you want i can give you a super-compact-nutshell \nunderstanding of the situation.\n\nContrast to what Mr.Green said there was a build up to the war and there \ndefinitely was uncertainty amongst the governments. Following the 2nd \nBalkan war in which Serbia led the liberation of Eastern Europe from the \nOttoman empire there was something called the Berlin conference in which \nevery single European country attended (except Bulgaria) and discussed \nissues facing the newly freed Balkan states, including who had claim to \nBosnia.\n\nDue to the the history of the Balkan Wars (which you can read up on if you \nwant) almost the entirety of Europe conferred Bosnia to their culturally \nsimilar counterpart Serbia. Despite this agreement Austria-Hungary annexed \nBosnia anyway and basically told the rest of Europe 'what are you going to \ndo about it'. The Austrians ruled Bosnia with a bloody iron fist. As a \nresult of this occupation (and it was nothing less than that) a number of \nliberation movements sprung up of seeped into Bosnia, one of whom being the \nYoung-Bosnia movement.\n\nLet me now explain why Gavrilo Princip is not a terrorist but a freedom \nfighter. Would shooting a Nazi Waffen SS Officer in the Balkans during the \n1940s be wrong and an act of terrorism? No? How then is this situation any \ndifferent? Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was an occupier, who came to \na Serbian dominated city on major national holiday, emotions flaring, so \nthat the duke can flex his political muscles, moderate or not and deserved \nto be assassinated.\nBy the way interesting fact; the original assassin of the plot was supposed \nto be a Muslim Bosniak called Muhamed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 and when he failed to \nthrow the grenades on time the Archduke's driver sped away and accidentally \ntook a wrong turn and stopped right in front of Gavrilo Princip. Gavrilo \nPrincip, taking this opportunity, lept at the vehicle and shot the royals. \nThis act then gave the Austrian a cause to attack Serbia because the lucky \nassassin is a Christian-Orthodox Bosnian-Serb from Herzegovina. Those \nAustrians and their logical links and conclusions.\n\nThis entire point is a massive nutshell of why the Serbs are in the right \nand the Austrians and Germans (as per usual) are in the wrong. I explained \nit better in another post. But Mr.Green and the Western education system \nbelieve that a teenager can't handle that sort of critical thinking so they \njust slap a black&white cause to the war and say 'Gavrilo & the Serbs \nstarted it, just because'. Thats definitely what our kids need to be \ntaught, that lifes problems are black and white and that there are such \nthings as good guys and bad guys. -_-\n\n5. Serbian expansionism? Greater Serbia? Mr. Green clearly has a bias and \nis making things up in an attempt to defame Serbia and their people inside \nand outside the country.\nThe concept of Greater Serbia didn't even exist back back. And Serbia's \ngovernment was and still is the most ethnically diverse in the world.\nHe accuses Serbia of expansionism when they were literally half the size \nthey are today in the early 1900s and doesn't even bat an eye and the \nAustrian war-mongers that are controlling seven other nations and a dozen \nethnicities that desire independence with a homogenous Austrian government. \nyup that makes sense. Oh the hypocrisy. I feel like i'm watching fox news. \n\nThese are just some points. I hope you don't mind the light sarcasm i laced \nin for entertainment. I'm mostly being serious though. I hope you \nunderstand my opinion. I have some biases too but not as much as this guy. \nI can't explain everything in a single comment but yeah i hope you enjoy \nthe read. I look forward to your response.",
