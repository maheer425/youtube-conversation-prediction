I grew up in the 90's so I love \nJRPGs as much as anyone but you have to admit that western RPGs really blew \nJRPGs out of the water in the past 2 gens. Also you're coming at this from \na western perspective looking only at what you want to find in the east, \nsince you live in the west you are being bombarded with things you don't \nenjoy from commercials, idle chat, etc. etc. The same thing would happen if \nyou lived in the east.\n\n  I love both western, and eastern forms of story-telling in video games, \nhowever they are both equally awful as they are great. JRPGs do have great \nCHARACTER depth, but they are full of tropes, and a flimsy world. Western \nRPGs have amazing world and character depth along with a bigger focus on \ngameplay, and customization so you can feel yourself in the world they have \nworked so hard on.\n\n  Also before you knock western culture again try to crack a book. There \nare dozens, and dozens of great fantasy novel series all by western authors \nthat are completely full of amazing story-telling, character depth, and \nworld depth. \n\nEdit - I will also add that I haven't played this game yet, and decided to \nlook up a review before doing so. So nothing of what I said has to do with \nthis game in particular, just your weaboo statement.",
