It is your \"opinion\" that I do not know much about evolution. I however \ndisagree with your \"opinion\". I believe I know a very decent amount about \nthe \"belief\" or \"theory\" of \"evolution\".\n\nHere are just some \"beliefs\" that I know to come from the \"beliefs\" of \nMacro-Evolution (A.) and Cosmic Evolution (B.).\n\nA.  Most \"evolutionists\" \"believe\" (or again at least teach) that humans \n\"evolved\" from other living things through millions of years. They \n\"believe\" we evolved from Starfish, Sea sponges, etc...\n   They \"believe\" about 30 million years ago (dates vary and change \nconstantly) larger primates such as monkeys and apes evolved into humans. \nThis \"belief\" of \"evolution\" is not limited to humans. This is all included \nin Macro-Evolution.\n\nSources: (Discover Magazine November 2004), (Holt Earth Science, 1989, pg \n294) \n\nNo one has ever experienced Marco-Evolution. It takes \"belief\".\n\nB.   Most \"evolutionist\" \"believe\" (or at least have been teaching young \nstudents) in the \"Big Bang Theory\" (or whatever other starting \"spark\" they \n\"believe\") happened around 20-22 Billion years ago (date varies and changes \nconstantly, also note some also \"believe\"/teach that the universe is a \nclosed universe, which leads to another slightly different \"belief\" as to \nwhat happens). Most believe that all the matter in the universe was either \ncondensed into a very hot, very small dot, or that all the matter came from \nnothing at all and In a quote from one of the leading scientific magazines \none of our foremost theoretical physicists and cosmologists he said:\u201cThe \nobservable universe could have evolved from an infinitesimal region. It\u2019s \nthen tempting to go one step further and speculate that the entire universe \nevolved from literally nothing\".). Either way, when this dot (or nothing) \nexploded they \"believe\" it somehow created \"time\" \"space\" and \"matter\". \nThis is all included in Cosmic Evolution.\n\n    A person can talk about their \"belief\" that reptiles evolved into birds \nall day long, but where did the reptile come from? The answer for most is \nthe \"belief\" of Organic Evolution. How life came from something that wasn't \nliving. Well then how did a rock, or soup mixture from an ocean turn into a \nliving thing. Where did that rock come from? It all leads back to the \n\"belief\" of \"Cosmic Evolution\"\n\nSources from school text books:(Prentice Hall Earth Science, 1999 pg.63), \n(Prentice Hall Earth Science, 1999 pg.63 and Prentice Hall General Science, \n1992 pg.61), and (HBJ General Science, 1989, pg 362).\n\n   Cosmic Evolution has never been observed or experienced. It is not \nscience.\nIt is however needed to occur for certain parts of \"Evolution\" to happen.\nSome questions one might ask. \nWhat made the Big Bang happen (what caused it to explode)? \nWhat was before this dot (or nothingness, if there really was nothing then \nwhat about the 1st law of thermodynamics which says that matter and energy \ncannot be destroyed or created)? \nWhere did or when did the laws even form (and do they change)?\nWhat caused this dot to hold together (what kept it condensed)? \nWhat originally caused it to come together? \nWhere did the matter and energy come from?\n\n Any person can ask me questions about my \"faith\" in God. Rightfully I can \nalso question their \"belief\" in evolution.\n\n  Many \"believe\" that the universe is a closed universe and that we keep \ngetting squished and then exploded over and over.\n\n Well then if someone tells me that their \"belief\" is that everything \nalways existed, (and that that is how we got here),  I can point to my \n\"belief\" that my God always existed (and that him creating us is how we got \nhere). \n\nNeither one can be experienced today.\n \n     Yes I did mention those terms (micro,macro, etc) in my last post \nbecause they are what make up the different meanings of \"evolution\".  When \nsomeone says \"evolution\" they could be referring to any on of them.\n\n  You state they (micro, macro, etc...) are not \"scientific\" \"terms\". I \nwould then ask what \"your\" \"definition\" for \"scientific terms\" in your \nstatement means? What words do \"you\" consider to be \"scientific terms\". For \ninstance \"Macro-evolution\" has it's own definition in the dictionary, and \nso does \"Micro-Evolution\". I fail to see how I invented something that is \nalready in the dictionary. The other words are also commonly known and \ntalked about by both evolutionists, and creationists alike.\nHere are the definitions from one dictionary for Macro and Micro-evolution.\n\n\"Mac\u00b7ro\u00b7ev\u00b7o\u00b7lu\u00b7tion makro-ev?'lo?oSH?n,?ev?/\nNoun-BIOLOGY\nMajor \"Evolutionary\" (developmental) change. The term applies mainly to the \nevolution of whole taxonomic groups over long periods of time.\"\n\nMi\u00b7cro\u00b7ev\u00b7o\u00b7lu\u00b7tion?mikro-ev?'lo?oSH?n,?ev?/\nNoun-BIOLOGY\nEvolutionary (developmental) change within a species or small group of \norganisms, especially over a short period.\n\n You also state that I judge the work of scientists as false. Where is this \n\"work\" from these scientists? I am assuming you are saying that they have \nexperienced evidence of evolution.\n\n How can one judge something that does not exist? There is nothing to \njudge, but the unproved \"belief\" of evolution, and I don't think that it is \na very good \"belief\" at all.\n\n2. You also show narrow mindedness when you assume that a scientist's job \nis to simply look at a fossil and declare what it is, that's a really \nstupid assumption and you know it. I can smell the bad faith 10km away.\n\n2.Can you please show me where I stated this assumption, or point out what \nled you to believe that I assumed this? I don't believe I ever did. I did \nbring fossils up, but not in the context that you are saying I did.\n\n\n3. \"And I mean, your overwhelming use of semantics proves the rest of your \nintellectual dishonesty...\"\n\n3. Again don't see how I am to talk with you without using the meaning of \nwords, sentence, phrases, and text. I also fail to see how I could \nunderstand what you are stating unless you were using the meaning or words, \nsentences, phrases, and text behind what you post.\n\n The meaning of words and their definitions are important. If definitions \nand meanings did not exist for words, then words would be meaningless.\n\nIt appears like you are saying that because I am using the meaning of \nwords, sentences, phrases, and text to communicate with you it somehow \nshows \"intellectual dishonesty\", but if your own words are applied to you \nthen you would be showing the same.\n\n4. \"...it's not like you're bringing up maths to disprove evolution, you're \njust playing these word games, thinking I'm stupid enough to be convinced \nby your mediocre rhetoric, trying to explain that evolution isn't \nscientific.\"\n\n4.How can one bring up maths to disprove something that does not exist?\n\nHere is a definition of mathematics from the dictionary.\n\nMATHEMATICS-The science of quantity; the science which treats of magnitude \nand number, or of whatever can be measured or numbered. \n\nSo mathematics is the science of quantity, science is knowledge, and \nknowledge is a clear and certain perception of that which exists, or of \ntruth and fact.\n\n I can have a knowledge of two apples and therefore quantify (or number) \nthem. They exist.\n One can not quantify something that does not exist though.\n\nYour implying that I should use mathematics, which requires something that \nexists, to disprove Evolution, which does not exist and has never been \nobserved), and thereby prove that it is something that can't be perceived \nso as to be called science. I don't need to disprove that one can't \nperceive something that does not exist.\n\nEvolution is not science.\n\n5. \"To me, anyone who delves into semantics in a discussion immediately \nloses credibility, because it's the lowest thing one can resort to, any kid \ncan start playing stupid word games just to stall the discussion and avoid \nadmitting they are wrong. In your case, not only you go into semantics, but \neven there you're still wrong about it.\"\n\n5. Again I fail to see how someone using words and their proper definition \nloses credibility. Nor do I see how it is the lowest thing that someone can \nresort to.\n\nIt seems that you \"believe\" that when one starts using a word and \ndefinition they are \"playing stupid word games\". It also seems that you \n\"think\" the fact that they do this means that they are stalling instead of \nadmitting they are wrong.\n\nThis \"belief\" would apply to yourself then as well.\n\nYou can \"believe\" I am wrong whether I am wrong or right. \n\nHowever you will not tell me the living empirical (experienced) evidence of \nevolution (the one you are referencing besides Micro evolution) that you \nhave to demonstrate how it can be personally experienced so that it could \nrightfully be called science.\n\n6. \"Look at how you say \"evolution is just a theory\". A Theory in science \nis NOT a hypothesis. It's a full fledged model that has the hypothesis, the \nobservations and conclusions to establish itself as part of reality, just \nlike the theory of gravity. Please do yourself a favor and go to school.\"\n\n6. If evolution is a fact then why is Darwin quoted as saying \"...If my \ntheory be true...\" \n\nHYPOTHESIS-is \"A supposition; a proposition or principle which is supposed \nor taken for granted, in order to draw a conclusion or inference for proof \nof the point in question; something not proved,but assumed for the purpose \nof argument.\".\n\nA hypothesis is the position of something known not to be true or not \nproved.\n\nIf \"evolution\" has hypothesis then as a whole it is not true or not proved, \nthen \"evolution\" (the parts that are not true or proved) cannot be \nconsidered science. \n\n7. \"It's a full fledged model that has the hypothesis, the observations and \nconclusions to establish itself as part of reality, just like the theory of \ngravity. Please do yourself a favor and go to school.\n\n7. You seem to again say evolution has been observed. I will again ask for \nyou to give a living experienced observation of a reptile giving birth to a \nbird. Evolution is not a reality it cannot be experienced to be called \nscience.\n\nYou seem to state that evolution has been established just like the theory \nof gravity. \n\n Well I will at least mention before I go on that there are some people out \nthere that would say that Evolution is not even a \"theory\" because it can \nnot be experienced. They consider it like trying to explain how something \nhappened that has never happened. It's certainly something to challenge \nones understanding of the terms hypothesis, theory, and law.\n\n\nAnyways for gravity (if one was not aware) there is what people consider to \nbe the law of gravity, and then there are actually a couple different \n\"theories\" of gravity.\nThe law is what appears to happen.\nThe theory tries to explain why.\nOne thing to point out is that the theory explaining why it happens \nactually tries to explain something that actually happens.\n\n\nA law does nothing more than tell you how something behaves. It does not \ntell you why it behaves the way it does.\n\nThe theory is what examines what happens and tells one why and how it \nhappened. \n\nDon't think that a theory is immune to being proved wrong though. Theories \nare changed entirely or ditched all the time . They are not necessarily \ntrue. \n\nI actually fail to see what observable thing the \"Theory of Evolution\" is \ntrying to explain. Seeing that \"evolution\" (not Micro) has no way to \nactually be personally experienced. \n\n   Hypothesis, Theory, and Law, these are terms that are argued about, and \nneed to be properly defined, but I will be honest the words are defined \nvery differently even among people who all \"believe\" in \"evolution\".\n\n8. \"I don't want to have a real debate because it's a waste of my time. \nThere is nothing to debate about evolution, it's been discovered a hundred \nyears ago. It's the reality of the world we live in. I already have a good \nunderstanding on how it works, and the science we use based on evolution \nworks just fine. All I'm saying is that you should go and further your \neducation, go watch channels like SciShow or something.\"\n\n8. II don't see how it is possible for us to have a fake debate.\n\n You say evolution was discovered a hundred years ago, but still no one has \nlive experienced evidence for this \"belief\".\n\nEvolution is not the reality of the world we live in currently.\n\n     If this \"belief\" of evolution is now being excepted as science purely \nbased on the\"belief\" that it exists then the word science needs to be \nupdated in the dictionary. Just realize that in doing so, I can also call \nthe \"belief\" of creation a science as well. And anyone else with a \"belief\" \ncan also slap the statement science onto their \"belief\"\n\n    Watching more of people explain this \"belief\" of evolution will only \ntell me more about the \"belief\". It will not give me any personal \nexperienced evidence so that I could know it happens.\n\n It all comes down to this again.\n\nI currently admit what I \"believe\" is by \"faith\". \n\nYou will not admit that your \"belief\" is a \"belief\", but yet you will not \ngive the personally experienced evidence that you say you have for it to \nshow that it is science.\n\nPlease provide it.",

If \nthere is no living example of it happening today then it cannot be \nexperienced to be called science. It is just a \"theory\". \nYou say there is as much empirical evidence for evolution as there is to a \ncrime scene.\n The crime of murder without the murderer being known gets a little more \ncomplicated. There can be thousands of footprints and fingerprints in the \nroom of the crime, but one has to find the right ones that were responsible \nfor the murder. One also then needs to find the person responsible for \nmaking those footprints and fingerprints. One can't just point to all 1,000 \nand say \"See, this person was murdered by these 1,000 fingerprints and \nfootprints\".The fingerprints and footprints are not what murdered the \nvictim. Again one would have to find the person who made the fingerprints \nand footprints before bringing the \"suspect\" to trial.\n\nOne cannot look at a fossil and say that it is a missing link for a reptile \nturning into a bird and call it science. You don't know if that fossil had \nany offspring. You don't know if the fossil's parents didn't already have \nthe wings.\nIt's like saying that the footprint is the thing responsible for the murder.\nNo, bring me the person who is responsible for the footprint and prove to \nme how they did the murder.\n\n Show me the living experience of your fossil turning into another animal. \nSomething that is real usually makes a footprint. You show the footprint, \nbut can't show the thing that made it. There is no case to be made.\nYou are trying to say what made the footprint without actually seeing for \nyourself what made it.\n I will not deny that you can \"believe\" or \"speculate\" that your footprint \nwas left by the process of evolution. It is another thing to say though \nthat you have anything more than that footprint. \nNot only that, but as I have stated before, the creationist looks at that \nsame footprint and makes their own \"speculations\" and \"beliefs\" about what \nmade it as well. Somebody is wrong and somebody is right, or both are \nwrong. Neither however has personal empirical evidence for their \"belief\". \nIf they did then it would not be called a theory.\n\nDestin's \"about\" page (on February 23, 2015) says this \"I explore the world \nusing science. That's pretty much all there is to it...\"\n\nNow he is showing us science in his balloon experiment. How? I can go and \ndo what he is doing and experience it for myself. So Destin can say he has \nempirical evidence for this balloon experiment. I can also go do this \nballoon experiment and have empirical evidence for myself that it can be \ndone.\n\nNow if Destin had posted a video not showing anything but him saying \"Look \nhere is science!\", and then went on to say  \"I believe that if you drive \nforward in your car with a balloon attached to the floor of the car it will \nturn into 8 solid gold bars!\" \nThat would not be science! No one can do this experiment and get that \nresult. \nNow Destin could \"believe\" this as much as he wanted. He could look for \nproof of it's happening his whole life. However it does not change the fact \nthat it hasn't happened to be witnessed, and that it cannot be experienced \nby others to be called science. Destin himself wouldn't even have had the \nexperience to tell so that others could put their \"faith\" in what he saw.\nYou ask who am I to say it does not happen (in regards to evolution). I am \na human being, therefore I am able to utilize science. I cannot however \ncall something science that is not science. Science has a definition. \nScience has a meaning. If you are to call something science it must fall \ninto science's definition.\nWhich leads me into your next statements about word meanings and semantics.\n2.\"Also, there is no such thing as micro and macro evolution, those terms \nare not scientific.\nThe rest of your post is pure semantics.

Well I don't agree with you as far as Marco-evolution and \nMirco-Evolution not having value (as far as a word or phrase having meaning \ngoes). \nWhat you said about Macro-Evolution alone does hold some truth, although \nnot in the way you were stating it. Macro-Evolution cannot be called \nscience. It cannot be experienced. It therefore is a \"Theory\" or \nspeculation.\nYou say what I wrote is semantics. SEMANTICS- is the meaning of a word, \nphrase, sentence, or text.\nSo I fail to understand how anyone is supposed to communicate with another \nperson if neither can use words, phrases, sentences, or texts that have a \nmeaning or a definite definition. I have been trying not to say crucial \nwords without defining them, because then the interpretation is left open \nto speculation.\nWithout a definition of a word we could be talking about two different \nsubjects.\nIf one does not believe the meaning of words are important then why was a \ndictionary ever made?\nI don't \"believe\" I am being unreasonable with the words I am using.\nI am not defining a word like cheeseburger and saying that it is an insect \nthat flies around a barn.\nYou are free to address anything you like. \n3. \"What I'm interested in seeing, however, is you proving your points \nthrough mathematics or direct, empirical evidence. If you can't provide \nthat, too bad for you, you have no credibility.\"\ufeff\n3.I have already told you. I cannot give you empirical evidence that God \ncreated. I was not there to perceive and experience it.\nWhat I \"believe\" you are failing to see is that you also cannot give a \nliving example of empirical evidence that evolution happens.\nI am willing to say that I cannot give you what you are asking for. You \nseem to not be willing to say that you cannot give me what I am asking you \nfor.\nIt is like two people each \"believing\" they personally own a dog, but each \nnot having any personal memory or experience with their own dog. They each \npersonally don't know where there dog is. They are each asking to see the \nother's dog as proof that the other actually owns a dog. The one admits \nthat although he \"believes\" he has a dog, he does not actually have the dog \nto show. The other insists that he too has a dog, but is not willing to \nadmit that he doesn't really have his dog to show the other. \nIf you have your dog please show him.\nI have asked for a living example of a reptile turning into a bird.\nYou have stated that you have thousands of examples of empirical evidence \nfor evolution. \nYou still have not provided any though.\nSo you can say I have no credibility, but if you were held to your own \nwords, neither do you.\nPlease tell me what breed of dog I can go buy, male and female, and then \nbreed them too get a bird? Please tell me what experiment I can do to get \nliving experienced evidence that evolution happens.\nDestin can show me that his balloon experiment is science. I can go do his \nexperiment and get the same results as him for myself.  \nPlease show me how I can experience a live example of evolution so that I \ncan experience it and consider it to see if it can be called science.\n ",

                    "text": " Interesting... You say \"Both Armathyx and I can point to thousands on \nthousands of incidents proving evolution.\" \nPlease tell about these incidents and tell about how they can be or have \nbeen experienced by somebody..\nHowever before you do, I would like to know what evolution you are \nreferring to.\n\nCosmic evolution: the origin of time, space, and matter from nothing in the \n\u201cbig bang\u201d\nChemical evolution: all elements \u201cevolved\u201d from hydrogen\nStellar evolution: stars and planets formed from gas clouds\nOrganic evolution: life begins from inanimate matter\nMacro-evolution: animals and plants change from one type into another\nor\nMicro-evolution: variations form within the \u201ckind\u201d?\nPeople can experience Micro-evolution. It happens, but these others do not \nhappen and cannot be empirical (experienced) evidence.\n\n I am curious to see your incidents of evolution. \n\nYour statements\n1.\"[referencing the enormous body of knowledge of information around \nevolution]\"\n\n1. I still don't know of any enormous body of knowledge of information \naround evolution. I can't perceive something that does not exist.\n\n2.\"It is just knowledge, the values used in discerning the information are \nthe point of difference.\"\n2. Knowledge- means \"A clear and certain perception of that which exists, \nor of truth and fact; the perception of the connection and agreement, or \ndisagreement and repugnancy of our ideas.\nWe can have no knowledge of that which does not exist.\"\nYou say that evolution is just knowledge. I would disagree to that. \nKnowledge is a perception of that which exists. It is a truth or fact.\nSCIENCE- is \"In a general sense, knowledge, or certain knowledge; the \ncomprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind.\"\nScience only deals with things that exist. It only deals with facts.\nFACT- is \"Any thing done, or that comes to pass; an act; a deed; an effect \nproduced or achieved; an event. Witnesses are introduced into court to \nprove a fact.\" Those witnesses have to have experienced the fact. It's not \na fact unless it has been experienced by the individual.\nEvolution is not a fact. It is a belief, theory, or speculation. That is \nwhy it is called the Theory of Evolution. Evolution itself is not science. \nIn order for it to be science it must be able to be observed and \nexperienced personally by an individual.\nI have never experienced seeing a living dog give birth to an eagle. \nI would dare to say neither has anyone else.\nThat is why it is a Theory.\nBoth an evolutionist and a creationist can look at the same fossils and \ncome up with different theories of how they got there. Neither of their \ntheories have been experienced though. Neither of their theories are for \nsure facts.\nThey can \"believe\" them, but they have not experienced them.\n\nAlso you use the word values.\nIn order for something to have value it must have worth. It must exist.\nVALUE- means \"Worth; that property or those properties of a thing which \nrender it useful or estimable; or the degree of that property or of such \nproperties. The real value of a thing is its utility, its power or capacity \nof procuring or producing good. Hence the real or intrinsic value of iron, \nis far greater than that of gold. But there is, in many things, an \nestimated value, depending on opinion or fashion, such as the value of \nprecious stones. The value of land depends on its fertility, or on its \nvicinity to a market, or on both.\"\n\n3.\"Where you have not evolved past an early stage of value development, \nothers have.\nDeveloping a different altitude with wider perspective.\n3. I again would find it interesting to know your definition of \"evolved\" \nhere. I am assuming that the word here you are using it to state \nadvancement. It would make this even more interesting if you were saying \nthat I have not evolved as in Macro-Evolution.\nAs far as I know you and I are still both human. So again I am assuming you \nare referring to advancement.\nWhich I would not agree that your \"belief\" is an advancement. Nor do I \nthink that it is right that you seemingly say that one who doesn't \n\"believe\" the way you do has not \"evolved?\" past an early stage of \ndevelopment.\nYou say these people who have passed this early stage of development have \ndeveloped a different altitude with wider perspectives.\n\nNow I do agree that certain \"beliefs\" will change a persons attitude, but \nthat doesn't mean that the \"belief\" is right. Somebody could have a belief \nthat killing all the animals in the world was his duty. This would \ncertainly change his attitude towards people's pets, and broaden his \nperspective so that he would ignore the fact that other people may like \ntheir pet, and he would start shooting every animal he saw.\nHitler had a \"belief\" that people of certain qualities should be \neliminated. It certainly affected his attitude and perspective.\n4.\"All that is needed is knowledge, context and discernment. However sadly \n these values are opaque to you, unseen and literally unknowable.\n4. Again knowledge is a clear perception of that which exists. Values can't \nbe opaque to a person unless those values are based on something that \nexists. So how can something that does not exist be put into context or \ndiscerned? How can something that does not exist even have worth? To my \nknowledge it can't.\nYou say that these values (which truth be told I do not see... because they \nare not there) are unseen to me (I agree I can't see something that does \nnot exist), and literally unknowable (yes you can not perceive something \nthat is not there).\n5. \"Why unknowable? \nBecause you like many with unevolved value systems; are simply stuck on an \nearlier tier of human development.*\"\n5. So it seems that someone who does not \"believe\" or at least \"think\" the \nsame as you is automatically stuck on an earlier tier of human development. \nThat is fine to \"believe\" within your \"belief\".\n6.\"This level of development has nothing to do with intelligence and worth, \njust the personal evolution of values, each of us grow - some not so much, \nthat is all.\"\n6. I would disagree completely with the statement that it has nothing to do \nwith intelligence and worth. I could theorize that several people with this \n\"belief\" system \"COULD\" see others that don't believe the same as \nworthless. You have already stated that I am stuck in an earlier tier of \nhuman development and that I might not grow much at all. So if someone with \nyour belief system knows that I might not \"grow much at all\" why not just \nget rid of me? I am not trying to say that you believe this way. I am \ntrying to state I see some possible dangers in this approach (at least for \npeople like me I guess).\nAlso it does not make sense that you say this development has nothing to do \nwith worth.\nIf your \"belief\" is so much better then someone who does not \"believe\" then \nthey would not show as much worth.\nA baby and a man both have worth.\nHowever if you narrow the context of worth down just to whether or not they \ncan work and plow land. Then the man has more worth because he can and the \nbaby cannot.\nSo I personally think that your \"belief\" does set worth to people at least \nin certain contexts.\n7. \"Flipping the question:\nHow can you know God exists and he created the earth?\nFaith is just not enough in this era of technology, and vast human \nknowledge... \nStill in all probability, your answer - going on earlier comments is;\n'belief' or faith a hope God both exists and created life on earth.  \nSay that aloud, hear the words and meaning. Feel what that set of language \nreally indicates.\nBecause I have seen 4 year olds with a similar belief in Santa, no one \ncould tell them he wasn't real either!\" \n7. Yes you are right I \"believe\" have \"faith\" and \"hope\" in God.\nI will point out that one who \"believes\" in the \"theory\" of evolution is \ndoing the same thing. They are believing something. So if faith is not \nenough in this era of technology, and vast human knowledge then those that \n\"believe\" in evolution are having the same faith you say is not enough.\nI understand what you are saying about Santa. However if you are going to \nuse it in that context your \"belief\" also applies.\n\nOne could ask the child to prove to another that Santa exists. They could \npoint to the man dressed as Santa in the mall. Now the Santa in the mall is \nlying, but that is a lie that is effecting the child is it not? The child \nsees this lie and believes it.\nSo moving on, one could show the child that the Santa is just a man by \npulling his beard off. That doesn't mean the four year old will stop \nbelieving. However that four year old will convince no one until Santa can \nbe shown.\nSame with Evolution.\nSame with God creating the world.\nA creationist can look at the same fossils a evolutionist looks at and come \nup with a different theory than him. The evolutionist can do the same.\nHowever one thing that is upsetting is that in evolution many things get \nput in (I am not saying on purpose) that are later found to be a fraud or a \nhoax. These things remain in children's text books for a long time before \nthey are taken out. \n\nI personally don't like the idea of Santa to begin with because parents are \noriginally knowingly lying to their children. However if the parents truly \nbelieved in Santa and found out he was fake and then continued to try and \nconvince their children he was real that would be very wrong ( and yet I \nsuppose this is what is happening seeing that the parents themselves when \nyounger were lied to as well, found the lie out, but then still passed it \nalong).\nThe difference is that Santa is looked at as something fun to lie to the \nchildren about (not saying it's right). Does that mean other beliefs that \nadults believe should get these same liberties of lying?\n8. Lastly \"The body of evolution exists, it is your choice to have belief \nin it or not. That is point of difference - no faith or hope is required. \nBoth Armathyx and I can point to thousands on thousands of incidents \nproving evolution. Where is your evidence?\"\n8. I disagree with you that you don't need \"faith\" to \"believe\" evolution \nas I have stated previously.\nFAITH- is 1. \"Belief; the assent of the mind to the truth of what is \ndeclared by another, resting on his authority and veracity, without other \nevidence; the judgment that what another states or testifies is the truth. \nI have strong faith or no faith in the testimony of a witness, or in what a \nhistorian narrates.\"\nUnless you can say you yourself have experienced a living example of \nevolution happening (a fish turning into a bird) you are \"believing\" \nanother person's words or statements as you yourself have not experienced \nit. A person can read and believe Darwin's book, but even Darwin himself \ndid not personally experience a live fish giving birth to a bird. So that \nperson is taking on another person's \"belief\".\nAnd I do not know of any person throughout human history who has ever \nclaimed that they experienced macro-evolution and then went and testified \nabout it so that others could have \"faith\" in what he said. Because even if \nthere had been such a person, his word of mouth could only give somebody \nthe choice to put faith in what they said, unless they themselves too could \nexperience macro-evolution taking place.\nTo my knowledge today there is still only the theory that it even takes \nplace.\nYou ask where my evidence is. We need to determine what evidence is though.\nEVIDENCE- is \"That which elucidates and enables the mind to see truth; \nproof arising from our own perceptions by the senses, or from the testimony \nof others, or from inductions of reason.\"\nI would bring up the testimony of others. \nI would bring up the writings of the people who wrote the old-testament. \nThey wrote about how God created. They told about how Christ would come, \nand what he would do.\nI would then point to the writers (Many who were eye witnesses of Jesus) of \nthe new-testament, how the old-testament prophecies were fulfilled, how \nthey wrote about how Jesus came and died for our sins according to the \nscriptures, he was buried, and that he rose again on the third day \naccording to the scriptures. \nThese are people giving an account of what they experienced. Now I was not \nthere. So I put my \"faith\" in what they said. There are a lot of \ntestimonies from these people. I also see in my life certain things that \nthey talked about happen. It is my \"belief\" that reason these things happen \nis because of the reasons they say they would happen.\nI cannot give you empirical evidence of God creating the universe simply \nbecause I was not there.\nRemember what evidence is though. It is proof arising from our perceptions \nby the senses, or from the testimony of others.\nIt is a convincing factor, but a person still has to make a choice on a \nmatter.\nThere could be evidence on both sides for two opposing views. One is still \nmost likely wrong and one is still most likely right.\nBoth the evolutionist and the creationist have what they believe to be \nevidence to support their \"beliefs\". They wouldn't however need evidence \nfor either \"belief\" if it was something that could be experienced today. If \nit could be experienced today then it would be a fact and fall into being \ncalled science.\n\nAnd it all comes back to just that, science is knowledge the comprehension \nof truth and facts. Knowledge is a clear perception of that which exists, \nor truth and fact.\nIf something has not been experienced as a fact by an individual it will \nalways fall into the category of \"belief\" or \"faith\".\n\n\n ",

The equation for the \nspeed of sound in an ideal gas is c=(\u03b3kT/m)^0.5, where \u03b3 is the heat \ncapacity ratio, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and m is \nthe particle mass.\n\nMonoatomic gases like helium have a slightly lower heat capacity ratio than \ndiatomic gases like nitrogen or oxygen, but helium has a much lower \nparticle mass so it has a faster speed of sound. This is because the \nparticles move faster for the same temperature.\n\nIron and water are (at room temperature) solids and liquids respectively, \nso they behave under different rules. Heat them up until they evaporate and \nat the same temperature sound will travel faster through helium.\n\nIn terms of a vaccum, you are mixing up speed and ease of travel.",

Spirituality is a more \ngeneral term for a feeling of awe and wonder, as well as a feeling of \nconnectivity to the universe. Religion is the following of a specific \ndoctrine. Being spiritual does not imply being religious, however it seems \nbeing religious most often implies being spiritual.\n\nSurely there could be genetic disposition as well as a part played by \nexperience. I agree with that.\n\nI also agree that some people are born with a propensity to believe in a \ngod as well, however I don't accept the notion that a baby believes in a \ngod until it has been introduced to the concept. Hence, all babies are \natheists, some more likely than others to change their position to theism \nonce they understand the debate.\n\nSaying a baby is born as a theist is like saying a baby is born as a \ngolfer. No, the baby is not a golfer, it doesn't know what golf is. \nTherefore it is not a golfer.\n\nPerhaps you could tell me how you think a baby could be a theist.

This means that this \nexperience was enforced by the brain on them rather than learned. Of course \nI do not deny some can learn that state of mind, but the relation can go \nboth ways. And of course this means that at least some people who are \nreligious have a good chance of being genetically preconditioned to it. To \ngive a good parallel: it is similar to obesity, some people become obese \nbecause or bad habits (learned behaviour), some from bad DNA (genetic \ncause). Similarly with this, some are spiritual/religious because they \nlearned it, and some seem to be genetically predisposed for that.\n\nThus to conclude, relating to the original comment as children being born \natheists: I think that some are born atheists, and some are born spiritual \noriented.

Being religious or not is rooted in DNA and in our brains. In has \nbeen shown that people with naturally stronger activity in temporal lobes \nhave significantly higher chances to be religious. Of course it is not a \ndecisive factor, but very well may be dominating.\n\nSo a child (including me and you two guys :) ) is born with strong tendency \nto be religious or being atheist as a predisposition of the DNA code and \ntheir brains. Just to give example Richard Dawkins underwent testing (as a \npart of mentioned research) and was shown to have extremely low activity in \ntemporal lobes, thus his strong position on atheism very well could be a \nnatural consequence coming from his DNA. As a side note brain of course \ndoes not carry information which religion person will choose, this is 100% \nlearned.\n\nI do not have the sources for this but you can easily Google it, it is \nserious research that sprouted from research on epilepsy (since originally \nit was observed that epileptics have statistically significantly higher \nchances of being religious) .",
