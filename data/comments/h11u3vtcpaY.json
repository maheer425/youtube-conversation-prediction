When I first watched this, \nand the times since where I've looked at some vids that give a small \nchronology of his life, I've been more impacted by his nature than anything \nelse. There is always going to be somebody richer and power; and those \nthings do make a difference (I have a small idea but not details on the \ncosts of that area). But if you try to convince some that Logan doesn't \nstand out even in his own community, just do a little more searching and \nwatching and reading and I think you'll find not just a great kid with \ngreat friends and community, but a heritage in his family line (something I \nknow little about but sense). So, yes, money helps, but helps what? \nSometimes it helps stagnation, other times it helps people thrive. In this \ncase, his parents had a big part in making he and his brother thrive.

I'm still amazed at the way he \nnailed it and pulled it off with style; this and his Al Capone Y.C. are my \nfavorites.\n\nHe's marked a big spot in my memory, and actually changed some things in me \nfor the better; he's probably helped a lot of people w/o directly knowing \nit.\n\nI hope nothing but the best for him and I'm sure his Mom & Dad, Friends and \nFamily will continue to nurture his growth, and he, others.\n\nAt least that's my hope & I believe the hope of others; no reason to doubt \nthat he would fly the nest at the wrong time in the pre-collegiate years. \nWith those kinds of great influences, best to make absolutely the very most \nof it; I bet he's in good hands.\n\nI've not seen anything to indicate that he did this as a result of John \nLennon's quote.

Every speaker has to find their groove and move from point to point \nwith good transition, articulation and sincerity. I saw gestures, eye \ncontact and an effort and rhythm in Logan that was sincere; very authentic. \nPeople in the crowd he made eye contact with (and smiled genuinely) that \nwould not have been planned beforehand. Points he made in jest that went \nover great, one jest that went over in a delicate moment that was made \nspecial because of the way he flowed right through it into the next point, \nshowing a strength that you don't often find in a person as young as he is, \nand also another example of something that could not have bee planned \nbeforehand. His talk was genuine and he's authentic alright, and he has a \ngreat story leading up to this point if you look into it, and from here I \nbelieve he's just beginning.

He discusses how hacking his education is \nhelping him achieve this goal.\"\nThis is ridiculous. The child is as any other adult (because he behaves as \nan adult): struggling to become happy and healthy. To achieve that it is \nnot hacking his education that helps, but a pair of parents that create a \nspace in which the child can develop as the unique itself, and not trying \nto be a copy of the parents. This is what I see here: an American self \noverestimated adult, never having played in the freedom of a real child, \nnot natural at all, and completely the copy of those who were and are \nconstantly around him, putting him on clouds of illusions. The way he talks \nis not a child's talk, he might be hailed for his intelligence, and maybe \nhe will get the Nobel Prize, but.... is THAT what makes him happy? Here is \nalready the greed for success, and has nothing to do to become or be happy. \nNot at all. \nHe is a victim, of the \"modern\" parents. But only on the other side of the \nmedal named \"normal\" education. He copied and pasted the same as other \nchildren do on normal schools. Here is a parent speaking, even his gestures \nare copied, even the .....right? question after a sentence. No, this is not \nsomething special. Not at all.\nThis is in fact sad, it makes me sad and should leave the audience. \ufeff",

Its \na pretty simple premise. Logans happy at this period in his life by \nfollowing the 8 TLCs, and it's his goal to remain happy. Schooling and \neducation come into this because everyone knows a jobless adult with no \nincome isn't usually all that happy. By implementing internships into \nLogans education as well as your standard Maths/English/History online, \nhe's not just being educated from a traditional school perspective, he's \nalso setting himself up for future employment. I did ok in school but no \none cares about my grades, its all about my experience, and if Logan keeps \nup these internships he'll be far more versed in the work place than your \naverage kid looking for work. As for mimicking his parents instructions on \nstage and lacking the freedom of a \"real\" child....all i can say is give \nthe kid some credit. Its an assumption on your part that his talk was \ncoached and as for lacking a real childhood, from what i can see hes \ninvolved in some of the best sports activities most kids would give their \nright leg to be involved in.

                    "text": "+KennEH I know, it is a hard concept for folk to wrap their heads around. \nI'll try and walk you through it like I was. Let's start with money.\n\nMoney is a representation of the access to societies resources we get in \ncontribution for our service to society. The resources we by often come in \nthe form of goods. Most of the goods we purchase are made of various atoms \nand chemical compounds. A decade ago we entered into the era of being able \nto send data files to 3 dimensional printers in order to print off an \nobject. Most people that are fixed on the corporate media think the worst \ndanger is the printing of fire arms. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n\nAs this technology matures it will allow for retail outlets to sell torrent \nfiles to costumers so that they can print off everything from clothing \nto steel tools. We aren't there yet but we soon will be. Are you starting \nto see where I am going with this? The technology won't stop there.\n\nGiven the price v. performance trends in this technology we will have 3D \nprinters that can manipulate material at the atomic scale in under two \ndecades. Now it should be starting to sink in. Want a car made from a \nmaterial stronger and lighter than steel? Try carbon nano structures. Where \ncan the material to make this compound be found... in piss, shit, dirt, a \ncompost heap, things that are utterly valueless can be turned into a wide \nvariety of functional products. The functional products can then be turned \naround to be turned into anything else including another 3D printer. And \nthere is the slippage.\n\nIf you have a portable house hold appliance, that can be powered by \nsunlight to extrude any product from the atomic scale up from things you \ndon't want or need... will you need to go to the grocery store? What would \nyou buy there that you couldn't have for free at home? Would you need to go \nto a gas station to buy gas for your solar powered diamond framed roadster? \nWhy, when you could just print off gasoline at home (not that you would \nbecause your vehicle uses solar)? Would you go to a job you hate in order \nto buy the shit you need to survive even though you cold have all the shit \nyou need and more for free at home? Really? Would you punch someone else's \nclock if there was absolutely no reason to do so? Furthermore... who would \nyou hire and what would you sell if you and everyone else no longer needed \nto buy anything? Now you must be starting to understand...\n\nThis is just one technology among many that is being engineered today... \nthat will one day eliminate work, money, and market economies. This \ntechnology is coming... and it is coming soon. Not only that but when the \nfirst nanotech assembler (atomic scale 3D printer) is created the second \none will be extruded for cost of a bucket of piss and shit or anything else \nyou can find in a land fill or sewer. What I mean to say is... this \ntechnology will not only be globally transformative... it will be cheaper \nthan shit you can't even give away. We will print off copies of our \nassemblers for our friends and family and use a pay it forward model to \nspread it globally like a wild fire. It will spread like a global pandemic \nto every country and every home in a matter of months. It will sweep the \nlast vestiges of capitalism away in a flash. No more money... no more work.\n\nTo those few that understand that money is no object in the present day... \ndo they all laze about and sleep all day? No. They do things that they find \nfulfilling. So when I say that we won't work in the future... I mean to say \nthat we won't work for a living. We will work at the things we enjoy to \nwork at. Ask yourself what you would do with your time if you already had \nall the money you could use and more... and that is what you will do when \nthe resource based economies of the near future arrive. Prepare your \narse... the singularity is near.",

I can't deny \nthat the stereotype of the socially awkward home school kid started without \nreason. I also cannot deny that there was a time homeschool for many \nfamilies involved sitting at the kitchen table all day with a workbook and \ntextbook. I do believe this approach to homeschooling is a way of the past. \nYou might be surprised to learn that, in our state of Arizona, the \nhomeschool kids are just as socialized as the public school kids if not \nmore so. Here is how that is possible: 1. Homeschool co-ops. Most families \nI know who homeschool are involved in co-ops and the students take anywhere \nfrom single classes to a full day. This differs from public school because \nclasses are smaller and families can hand pick the subjects their students \nwant to study. They still have class discussions and group work the same as \npublic school kids. 2. Homeschool support groups. These groups offer \nclasses, social and academic events, and field trips on a weekly basis. 3. \nA large home school community in AZ has resulted in numerous homeschool \nprograms being offered by everyone from the Phoenix Zoo to the Desert \nBotanical Gardens to the AZ Science Center just to name a few. 4. Yes, they \nhave friends. Friends in public school, private school, charter school, and \nhomeschool. They meet friends at extracurricular sports, arts, academics, \nchurch, and the common ways that everybody makes friends. 4. Let's take a \nreal look at how much actual socialization our kids get in school. I \ncomment on this not just as a homeschooling parent, but as someone who was \nin public school my whole life and went on to teach every grade kinder \nthrough grade twelve. How much time do they have to feely socialize in a \nschool day? I already addressed our homeschool kids have class discussions \nand group work. What socialization do kids get beyond that in the school \nday? When they aren't sitting at their desks they have lunch and recess. \nThat's about an hour at most schools. Specials are being taken away, recess \nis being shortened. If they are lucky enough to have a teacher that does \nspecials they get a little extra time. So my daughters does not get her \nsocialization \"at home with mother\". It comes from co-ops, homeschool \nsupport groups, community and institution supported programs, gymnastics, \ndance, martial arts, church, and, at her young age, play dates with \nfriends. I'd also like to point out that there are plenty of kids that are \nsocially awkward in public, private, and charter schools as well. Based on \nthe fact that all the homeschool families I know personally are as active \nas we are, making the comment that homeschool kids lack socialization is \njust simply an outdated opinion.",

Generalizations \nlike this nearly always turn out to be false (note my clever usage of the \nworld nearly ;-). I have plenty of counterexamples to disprove yours.\n\nThe word \"lazy\" had been all but retired from the neurocognitive science \nlingo for being essentially useless. There is no \"lazy\", there is \n\"insufficient motivation\". Learning in itself is quite interesting, and, \nwhen done right, releases a lot of dopamine into the brain, which acts as \nreward and makes us feel really good. Motivate the kids (and yourself) \nright, and learning is what they (and you) will want to do more or less all \nday long (with breaks, of course). Sure, there are some boring parts, but \nagain, motivation is key, and there is nothing to suggest that parents \nwould be unable to enforce rules to get kids to learn.\n\nAgain, I am not necessarily a staunch defender of homeschooling. But not an \nopponent either. I've seen both homeschooling and traditional schooling \nsucceed spectacularly, and I've seen them both fail equally spectacularly, \nand then I've seen everything in the middle.

I hope you agree that this is important \nstuff: Kids; the future.\n\nFirst, that word disingenuous, you're reading into something there that is \nsubjective to you. Second, I was saying that I think you're going a bit far \nin expecting a \"detailed video\" Third, about the book rage, that hints of \nsome publicity stunt, wha? Finally, about how to pull it off the way he \ndid...\n\nI'm not sure the point was to pull it off in the same way he did. I think *Friends, \nFamily, Community* was the point and \"even Traditional Schools\" as he said, \nI don't think it was publicity either. Remember, some of this movement got \na big boost with Sir Ken Robinson's talk which inspired Logan to an extent.\n\nI just saw a great poster of Michael J. Fox promoting this very idea of \nschools teaching kids the way they learn best; and he's not looking for \npublicity I can assure you someone going through that struggle wants \nmeaning and purpose out of it; I think there's meaning in Logan's story \nalso and that is the origin; not publicity or \"how to\" rage as you put it.\n\nI also think it's possible that the driving factor behind Logan's story \nmight not just be a decision to try TEDx instead of Young Chatauqua one \nyear as he says in the article that I hope you've read by now for the \n\"details\" you want. I think it's possible that when his parents originally \nmade the decision when he was 9 as he says, at least one teacher was not \nrecognizing Logan's talents (and probably others students).\n\nI hope you'd agree that his statement about his Mom being in tears was very \nauthentic. That combined with the article above I cited tells me that Logan \nis, as you can see here and have agreed previously, an amazing, bright \n*Hands-On* kid (as he mentions in the X-Games article).\n\nIf there were a teacher that was exceptionally insensitive to Logan, \nimagine if his Mom had not had those instincts, knowing her child, to act \nand do what was needed.

I didn't \nmention Logan's Dad above, but he has Skiing in his blood. All you have to \ndo is a little research to know that; it's in his kids too; part of the \ngenetics of at least 4 generations. From what I've read (and everything I \nknow comes from research), Logan's Dad wanted to be a champion downhill \nskier when he was young, but got injured and his Dad (Logan's Grandfather) \nbrought up what he called the \"C\" word (college), and so Logan's Dad went \nto Reno, fell in love with Nevada, and met Logan's mom his first week of \ncollege. He earned his degrees and worked very hard & I'd assume being \ninvolved in Finance saved up and started his own very unique company.

And often allows \nso many of the smaller fish to slip through the giant holes that make up \nits very structure.\n\nIn order to have higher effectiveness in school, it is necessary to put \nmore EFFORT into educaton. And of course do that in a way that is \nintelligent, not simply pushing more homework.\n\nFilling in the gaps left by the school system with practical education is \nrewarding but so difficult to organize and accomplish when parents feel \nthat putting their kids through schooling is enough.\n\nI often include my boss's children and other children I know in activities \nof my spare time, including repairing vehicles, working with wood and \nmaking guitars, painting, building and repairing computers and working on \nvarious DIY projects around the home and office.\n\nSadly, there doesn't seem to be a way to use that to replace the regular \neducation system.",

Frankly, I don't expect to see a full establishment of \neducational reform happen in my lifetime - it'd be nifty and all to see it, \nI suppose but I truly believe that the most effective and enduring change \ntakes time to take root and then to grow into something strong, that can \nflourish and be flexible enough to withstand the ongoing ebbs and fluxes of \nsocial change.  I'm not impatient for me so much - I'm through the \neducation system - I get foolishly frustrated by the gap between what \nindividuals can see and do and the capacity for large scale systemic \nchange.  I understand the discrepancy, entirely, but I remain idealistic \nenough to get impatient - particularly because so many (*ahem* the vast \nmajority) of the impediments of the progress to getting from point A to \npoint B a generated by the fear of change on the part of human beings, and \ntherefore are not truly beyond \"our\" control (using our in your sense of a \nglobal \"we\"... sometimes I would like to whack the global \"we\" silly with a \npool noodle, but I suspect that would be counter-productive).  \n\nIn the meantime, I do what I can, with the kids I do work with, to create \nas much of this as I can, with the resources I have available or can scare \nup, dig up, shake free, etc, and I tell my students at every possible \nopportunity about the differences between an education system and learning, \nabout not mastering an assigned task and \"failing\", I explain why hoops are \ncreated for jumping and how that has very little to do with their worth as \nhuman beings but why jumping through might be useful to them in the short \nor long term, and I challenge them to be curious, to dig, to expect respect \nbut to also give it, and to take nothing for granted, from the fact that \nthe blue shirt they are wearing is not in fact blue to the fact that they \ndon't have to graduate in 12 years. \n\nIf I wasn't impatient for change, perhaps I wouldn't be willing to make \nwhat changes I can, in my lifetime, from within the system, even when it \npits me against administrators and traditionalists, because I believe that \nwhatever drops I put in the bucket count for something.  Not every kid can \nor will be a Logan, but some will, and some will be Logan's parent, and \nsome will be somewhere in between - but the most lasting revolutions aren't \nthose that destroy one system, and leave a void, which, needing to be \nfilled immediately is usually filled by something almost as rancid as that \nwhich it destroyed.  The most pernicious forces are like weeds that take \nroot in the cracks and crevices of decaying walls and rip the hard \nboundaries to bits, making them functionally irreparable - surprisingly, \nmany things called weeds by those who built walls and tore down forests to \nplant fields etc. have roots, flowers and leaves that can be useful on many \nlevels - as long as they in turn are part of balanced bio-systems. *grin*.  \nYes, I'm mixing my extended metaphors, I know.",

(This isn't intended as a snide comment - I honestly \nfind it so odd that I'm curious as to why you would bother to do one but \nnot the other.)  PS - this is also long, so you might not want to read any \nfurther (again, this is not snide, but the comment and question aren't \ndesigned to try and force you to read the first comment or this one).\n \n+Abel Dantas I suppose my response would be who is meant when you say \n\"we\"?  I certainly want a citizenry of of healthy, critical thinkers who \nlived balanced lives both as individuals and as citizens of their local \ncommunities, of their countries, and of the planet in the immediate sense \nand in thinking of the impact of their actions in the here and now, and \nlong term.  I dare say many, many educators would agree with me, and many \nadministrators, as well.  I also happen to believe, based on the statistics \nthat a citizenry of such individuals pays out dividends not only in for the \nindividual, but for society in terms of fewer people reliant on social \nassistance networks, and for less time, fewer people involved in the \njustice system, and for less time, fewer people needing long term care for \npreventable, chronic illness, and for less time. \n\nThat being said, until we change the fiscal/economic paradigm - not just \nthe small business but large corporate business, the social expectation \nthat school is a babysitting-cum-sorting house, and that \"certification\" is \nnot the same as learning, we will continue to see a struggle between \nparents and teachers who want to nurture this same passion for learning and \nengagement in kids, including those without LaPlante's social or economic \ncapital to leverage, and an economic / political paradigm that seeks to \nsupport it's agenda to maintain power by using short term data. \n\nEducation and health are money sinks - the benefits are demonstrated over \nsuch a long term and in so many arenas it can be difficult to see direct, \nshort term correlations.\n\nFinally, as for it being an Idea Worth Spreading or not, the reality is, \nregardless of what young Logan says, it was not really he himself who \n\"hacked\" his education, it was his Mom, and hacked isn't quite the term - \nit was taking ownership to develop a skills and competency based course \nload that meets a curriculum, in order to maximize student engagement by \nbuilding in choice and interactivity.  His Mom evident has the social and \neconomic capital to leverage to do so successfully.  For most kids and \nparents, this would be extremely difficult to manage effectively given \ntheir financial and time constraints. \n\nWhat if the \"Idea Worth Spreading\" is simply this - by starting where kids \nare NOW for content, and involving them in their learning by providing them \nwith choice and relevance in their work, adults can develop \"courses\" that \nfocus on competencies (skills) that support whole-kid development - across \nsubject areas, with the result that kids can be engaged, enthusiastic \nlearners, eager to participate in their own education, wherever it may lead \nthem.   Ultimately, that's really what Logan, from his hyper-idealized and \nhighly individual perspective, is truly saying...and there are many, many \nschools - home schools, charter schools, public schools, \nschools-in-schools, teachers in schools, that are trying to do more and \nmore of that.  I'm not skeptical that we will get there.  I'm just \nimpatient!  *grin*",

I still \ndon't see this TEDx as an \"Idea Worth Spreading\".\n\nThe fundamental difference between the tone of young Logan and my personal \nopinion is that I'm much less optimist in the sense that we clearly don't \nwant citizens to be healthy or happy. And I sense that you share my \nskepticism as to where we are heading.\n\nOther than that, as I said, homeschooling or hybrid approaches to education \nseem to be a very valid choice nowadays, to those who can afford it ofc.\n\nEDIT: as for benefits I was referring to the benefits for individuals, \nwhether on not they are healthier, more sociable, more intelligent",

                    "text": "You're sort of missing a few key points - first of all, the point of TED is \n\"Ideas Worth Talking About\" not \"Ideas That Have Already Been Proven \nThrough Exhaustive and Conclusive Traditional Scientific Method Based \nObservation and Statistical Analysis\".  That would certainly be far less \nexciting as a catch phrase.  Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. Further, \nthe TEDx format is even looser, asking only that participants challenge \naudience members to consider an idea and accept a call to action - even if \nthat action is to simply consider a different way of thinking.\n\nAs an educator, I would suggest that the interest is that it's an opinion - \nand it's just that - from the trenches, so to speak.  It's all too rare \nthat we take the point of view of students into account, frankly, and some \nof his points are entirely valid, particularly as the work world moved \nincreasingly away from an Industrial Era model.  Many kids, when posed the \nquestion \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" are actually playing a \npart guessing game designed to incur the approval of the adults asking the \nquestion, and partly engaging in fantasy/role play.  Adults ask the \nquestion from the point of view of wanting kids to plan ahead for a secure, \nrealistic future in which the child-now-adult-to-be will be likely to be \nable to hold their own in a stable, solvent career, as we any more than \nthey can see into the future with clarity and certainty.  It's a silly \nquestion and designed to build a false sense of security for the adults.   \nThis kid is a relatively articulate, relatively informed, and moderately \nentertaining speaker, who is obviously passionate about his learning.  This \nis unique enough that it would generate interest. \n\nFinally, at no point in his talk did Logan LaPlante make a case for more \npeople getting out of the regular school system, nor did he suggest that \nall homeschooling is inherently superior to all traditional \nbrick-and-mortar schooling.  He was referring to his own experiences, and \neven suggested that the type of \"hacking' of education, and the focus on a \nhealthy, balanced approach to life where students could pursue studies in \nwhich they are interested, is entirely possible in the regular school \nsystem.  If you're looking for information on that, it's ubiquitous, with \nthe correct search terms: inquiry based learning, project based learning, \naffinity based learning, competency based learning, 21st Century Skills, \nStudent Driven Learning, SOLEs (Student Organized Learning Events), \nComprehension through Conversation, Experiential Learning or you can look \nup the works of people like John Hattie, Sir Ken Robinson, Ian Jukes with \nLee Crocket and Andrew Churches, Wiggins and McTighe, Maria Nichols, Howard \nGardener's new and improved understandings of how the mind works in 5 Minds \nfor the Future... the list goes on an on and on.\n\nThe key is that any educational organization is behemoth, and change comes \nslowly.  Like a massive ship, you just can't stop it and change direction \non a dime.  We know about these things and many of us do our utmost to \nimplement the best of what young Logan gets in our classrooms.  What makes \nhomeschooling categorically \"better\" is that evidently Logan has a solid \ncombination of sufficient access to resources - both community resources \nand other small-group learning opportunities, and financial resources to \nallow him to do things like ski, have a laptop at Starbucks etc. - and the \nresources of family support, a network of adults that can help him and help \nhis parents educate him. (The old village educating a child.)  There are \nsome tiny villages, even very poor villages, that do their best to make \nsimilar things happen on shoestring budgets, and can manifest incredible \nopportunities for their kids, and their educations may not be as rich in \nfancy \"things\" as Logan's but they can be rich, nonetheless.  The glitches \narise in the reality of many classrooms where the teacher ratios are such \nthat the quality time needed to really mentor kids is lacking, the \nresources are lamentable at best or missing altogether, or in homes where \nsome of the same conditions apply.  In those situations, regardless of the \nphysical location - home or a brick-and-mortar school - the deficit is paid \nfor in the short term by the kids, and in the long term by society. \n\nLastly, you would need to clearly define \"benefits\" - economics benefits \nfor individuals? Socio-economic benefits for entire countries? What would \nbe the time frame in which something would need to occur in order for \nsomething to counted as a benefit?  These are key questions; typically, \nso-called 'accountability' measures are limited to the one year time frame \nof the agricultural year that is the basis of our fiscal year, through to \nthe four year time frame that tends to fit with many political terms.  \nEducation, however, is not a one year or four year process, and the human \nmaturation process, and it's ramifications, including the statistics that \nmeasure various implications for education, are felt beyond the years a \nperson is involved with \"education\".  By measuring \"benefits\" in the short \nterm, we miss potentially significant information and influences in order \nto fit into fiscal plans and political agendas.\n\nIf we want to make effective change and make it last, the key isn't proving \nthat home schooling is worse or better than \"regular\" school - the question \nis moot, particularly since almost every home school story is different (I \nwork as part of a team that delivers home school \"options\" to both rural \nand urban families North of 60, as well as developing blended learning \nprogramming for teachers in the classroom, so I'm not just blowing hot air \n- this is experience talking). \n\nThe traditional school model has never been effective, IF you are willing \nto take  Logan's initial thesis as valid - that we might want to maximize \nthe opportunities for all children to become members of a citizenry of \nhealthy, \"happy\" (let's call it contented to the point of not needing \nexcessive physical and mental health care intervention, stress, and \ncontributing to society) contributing members of society.  That was never \nthe intent of the Industrial model of education - and it created a society \nthat has become increasingly unhealthy, dysfunctional, divisive, and \nself-destructive in the long term.

By the time I was \n12 and 14, I was studying college level math and biology (two of my top \nsubjects when I went back to school at grade 10), was studying A+, built \nwebsites, and lots of other things that most kids back then weren't doing. \nHome eco was normal life, I learned sewing, crochet (by someone who sold \nthings they made), and cooking. I learned the saxophone and picked up the \nguitar along with my love for the piano. I wrote poems which got published \na few places, and short stories I've some admittedly never shown anyone and \nsome I have. I learned photography and photo editing and learned how to do \nevents like weddings, big events, etc.\n\nI honestly loved learning, because I could customize it and learn what I \nwanted. I had access to books by the thousands. I mean that literally. \nWhenever mom and I went to Florida, we went to where the colleges and high \nschools gave up books and spent hours picking the right ones, packing them \nup, and shipping them home.\n\nI for one, believe that the system should indeed be tailored to the kid \ninstead of the other way around. It helps build passion for what they want \nto do in life, and I know it helped build mine. So thanks Mom, for sticking \nwith me for that time and teaching me well, you'll probably never \nunderstand the thanks and gratitude I have for you on doing that.\ufeff",

However \nmy friend, the world is quickly changing and well so is the economy. \nSometimes college is the only resort to a successful future to get a job \nand survive. You remind me alot of myself when i was younger. I thought the \nsame way and yes it is true all that you said. You did a great job \npreparing for this presentation. I think people fail to see the positive \npart of your presentation. Honestly all that most people especially online \nwant to do is post negativity and cuss.

                    "text": "+Natasha Rzanca I see your point, but I live near an area where poverty is \nrife and many families have recently emigrated from Asia or Eastern Europe \nwith little knowledge of the English language. I know for a fact that \nchildren in those families would be lucky to have any education at all, so \nhomeschooling may not necessarily be ideal for them. I am fourteen years \nold and a strong advocate of the public schooling system as it gives every \nchild the same opportunities for learning regardless of their economic \nstatus. \n\nFurthermore, LaPlante speaks of his education system as the be-all and \nend-all of education which will automatically work for every child and that \nadults should strive to cater for all children's interests. I disagree: \nstudents can have some freedom in their lessons, but to be properly \nprepared for a workplace environment they need to learn to respect \nauthority figures and work with what they're given. My mother is a very \nexperienced teacher who has worked with children from all kinds of \nbackgrounds, and I'm sure she'd agree that they would all benefit from a \nlimited curriculum and strong authority figures, especially when their \nparents have little or no influence on them. \nTo conclude, I find Logan's ideas excellent in some aspects but slightly \nmisguided in others, and I probably wouldn't base an education system \naround them. I understand that as a teenager I have little life experience \ncompared to the adults commenting, but I would still like to prove my point.",

I, personally, am still in a traditional classroom but we \nhave implemented some of LaPlante's ideas into our classroom. That may be \nan idea for you to bring up to a teacher or multiple, really. I feel that I \nshould also mention that I very much agree with you as for not all kids \nhaving access to a computer or an English speaking parent, because that is \nvery true, but in LaPlante's defense in this generation many students can \nfind access to a computer.

I understand that his \"hackschooling\" system works for him, but \nit wouldn't work for me: I'd get lost and wouldn't know where to start. I \nget the feeling from his presentation that he views his method of education \nas the only solution to all kids' problems when it's really up to the \nindividual to decide what works for them, and I can't help thinking that he \nwouldn't have had so many opportunities if he wasn't so wealthy and \nprivileged. I'm not saying his opinions have no value, but I think he \nshould at least acknowledge the fact that there are some kids out there who \nmay not have access to a working computer or a literate, English-speaking \nparent and would therefore be lucky to have any kind of education at all \nwithout public schools. In addition, he also needs to learn that not all \nadults are as closed-minded as he implies and that some of them, including \nthe teachers at public schools, are trying to teach him skills they've \nlearned from years of experience, not turn him into something he doesn't \nwant to be. However, I give him credit for having the courage to make a \nspeech like that: he's obviously an intelligent and articulate boy and I \nwish there were more kids like him where I live.

Before I was \npulled out of school I thought that school was just an obstacle in my day, \nnot a source of education, which it isn't. I was taught Italian for 1 year \nin my school and I can't even say one word in Italian. SAVE YOUR CHILDREN \nFROM SCHOOL! Because all schooled children seem the same. Homeschoolers are \nunique.",

What the kid in this \nvideo is essentially talking about is that we live in a different time \nwhere school isnt essential when it comes to learning.

Also, you don't have a clue \non what school does for you. It is much more than giving you \"life skill\" \nas you would define them.\nI'll give you an example. YOU... You are here writting (school) talking \nabout statistics (school) and and history (school) and whining about how \nschool doesn't help you... The problem with the public school system is \nthat it has to take care of everyone. It has little time or resources to \nteach the basics and critical thinking. \n\nFor example, the difference between your wishful thinking (school is bad \nand i'm mucho cool because i sport two earings) and reality. You look at \nevery single place on this Earth without a school system and you will \nquickly realize that not only school is vital in the building up of a \nsociety, but societies without school are utter failures by every \nconventional measures.\n\nThis is much more of a rational and meaningful approach to the subject than \nbabbling about a few anecdotal situation of people being stupid. School \ndoesn't make you immune to being stupid unfortunately. But not going to \nschool won't either and will contribute tremendously to your ignorance.  \n\n\n\"It does kill creativity, it does NOT express free thinking, but rather \nthat we must ALL think exactly alike.\" \n\nDoes it now? I guess that Ghandi didn't go to school then? Oh wait... Or \nhow about Mandela? Damn... That doesn't work either. Chomsky perhaps? Nope, \nthat sucker studied to the highest degree. Eisntein, Immanuel Kant, Hume, \nLocke, Newton... In fact, can you point out a great thinker and/or \ninnovator that hasn't had at least a moderate degree of schooling in his \nlife?\n\nSchool didn't kill their creativity. School didn't made them conform to \nanything. In fact, their schooling broadened their horizons and allowed \nthem to be the men they were. But there you stand... In all your Youtube \ncommenter glory. Claiming that you don't need school. \n\nWhat i always see is people dissing school because they couldn't cut it. \nThat is it. School is selective. School will tell you that you can't be a \ndoctor. Can't be a lawyer. That you can't be an architect. That you can't \ndesign. That you just aren't good enough. And that makes some rebel and \nclaim that school is worthless. It doesn't make it true. \n\nIn reality, some people just don't have what it takes. That is all. It's \nnot school. It's you. ",

I think everyone needs an \neducation, but that education is NOT what you would consider an education. \nIn standardized public schools, something that everyone \"must\" partake in \n(unless you're lucky enough to get into a private school, and I have heard \nno better from them either) you are taught absolutely no life skills, zero \nfundamental things you need to know in order to survive, your \"government\" \nclass explains nothing of what a government is doing but what they have \ndone in the past, and how they operate (great, you got one out of two). \nYour english class is 90% writing definitions endlessly expecting you to \nmemorize them and only 10% actual critical thinking on REAL literature. \nWhat about math? Well have you even seen this \"Common Core\" bullshit? fuck \ntrying to learn anything with that garbage. Handwriting is gone (I have yet \nto meet anyone my age even, who was taught hand writing till the 2nd grade, \nbig whoop, who has legible writing capabilities). History class, how about \n\"What did the world do to America, and how did we get even?\" class, oh, and \nmore mindless definitions. I have met two teachers in my entire life who \ntaught at a public school who were even willing to work with an individual \nstudent in order to really find out what makes them tick and how they can \nget the most out of the material. This standardized testing bullshit has \ngot to go. I passed all those tests with flying fucking colors, while \nfailing ALL my classes (I scored perfect on every single test I ever took \nin school... I don't rightfully give a fuck if you believe me) All while I \nhad friends who would never get below a 90 in any class, but couldn't pass \na test to save their lives. Because they never really learned anything, you \nhave someone to help you work through the every day bullshit, then nobody \nwhen it comes to the test. Not everyone learns exactly the same. Sitting in \nlarge groups in front of a single person who doesnt give a flying fuck \nabout their job, while all they do is hand out packets you have to pass in \norder to pass the class, just does not cut it. How do you organize your \nfinances? How do you apply for a loan to buy a house? How do you even fill \nout a fucking job application? What builds work ethics in a person? I love \nmy job, therefore I have great work ethics, I used to fucking hate my job \n(previous jobs) and I sat around accomplishing nothing with my life 24/7 \nlike 75% of the population (no offense to anyone, that 75% is a personal \nobservation, not an actual figure or insult) I see people being taught that \nwe need to know what we want to do with out lives before we even graduate \nhighschool. Those people end up going to college, majoring in something \nthat they think will make them rich, not something they enjoy doing, so \nthat they can get a job, HOPEFULLY make it a carreer, and fucking hate \ntheir jobs for the rest of their life not giving a shit about it. I had no \nidea what I wanted to do when i graduated, much less sophomore year, which \nis when everyone really starts getting on your ass about it. I thought i \nwanted to be a tattoo artist, peaked my interest for a bit, a whole two \nyears. Was great at working with computers, so i started with jobs in the \nIT feild thinking im going to be rich making $100k+ a year like all the \nadvertisements say. Then went on hoping i would make it in construction. \nlesson here, is everything we want to do nowadays, is based on the \npresumption that we MUST choose a \" career\" that will make us a lot of \nmoney, that we MUST spend a shit ton of money on specific schooling on that \nsubject to make more money, and if we dont do all of that and become overly \nsuccesful then we have failed at life. Yeah, I would like to be rich, but \nthere is no way in hell im going to hate life to do it. \nnow back to the school bullshit. It does kill creativity, it does NOT \nexpress free thinking, but rather that we must ALL think exactly alike. It \ndoes in fact waste a good portion of our lives, and for those unfortunate \nnot to break free themselves, their whole lives. But none of this matters \nto you anyway, for a few reasons. #1 I'm at the point of rambling\n#2 you don't give a fuck what other people say, you're going to think \nyou're right anyway no matter what\n#3 you are one of those unfortunate people, and can't face the truth that \nyou could have done much more with your life, so you are going to sit here \nand argue with absolutely everybody trying to force your incorrect belief \nthat \"formal schooling is the only way\" and try to convice us that it makes \nour society better and \"more productive\" when, in fact, most of the most \nsuccessful people\nyou're more then likely refering to are drop outs in the first place.\nLet me remind you that \nBestie\nDo over\nE Tickets\nSciency\nfirst world problem\nselfie\nand hashtag are all new entries in the Oxford English Dictionaru, among \nmany other, even dumber words that do not realy exist are were created by \nyour \"more productive and advanced\" society. \nAnd we dont even know what a fucking pound sign is. hell, i heard some guy \nthe other day talking about how a 1990's phone had a hashtag even though \n\"twitter wasn't even invented yet\"... yeah, public school helped him a lot.",

Good teachers need to be \nheld on to at the same time, Good school systems also but politics must not \nget involved - The Community must get involved and work it out.\n\nIn the end, from what I've observed and learned, the Parents need to be \nable to make the choices for their kids and *not mandatorily have to send \ntheir child to a school which in some cases, might include a teacher who is \nunusually cruel to the needs of special people. *\nIf the teacher is well \u201cranked\u201d and entrenched, and does not attend to the \nneeds of every child, they need to be looked into and booted no matter how \nlong they\u2019ve taught. My lesson here on this: I had a teacher that taught \nfor years & told me to wait after class near years end, he grabbed me by \nthe hair and said he had the power to take away my College Athletic \nscholarship (which I needed or I could not have gone); those kinds of \nteacher are out there; even if there are good ones.\n\nNow that I'm an adult, I look back and say, if I had the speaking ability \nand knowledge of the law I do now, I would have handled that much \ndifferently. Kids need all the knowledge they can get. I'm glad this is \nbeing debated. Peace.",

Part of this is parent's background and \ndetermination as well as resources available. So while you most likely \nwould have thrived in such an environment, in my learning style hack \nschooling is too free and well free. I would wish kids could be happier in \nschools, but being unhappy with education as a whole is a different topic \nthan being happy at school. (Make kids learn while making them think they \naren't can be feasible but teaching a person to want to learn is much more \nvaluable.)",

In a world \nthat ties access to economic standard, the choices you have in life are \nalso tied with a certain degree of economic well-being and in this world, \nfor all but those in the top 1%, it rests on ones utility. If you are \nuseful to them, people give you more money. A proper education gives you \nthat.\n\nYou won't see this type of recommendation coming from the rest of the world \nthat come from less privileged backgrounds because these people realize the \nadvantage of placing hard work and utility first. While the United States \ncloses down it's space program, China is landing rovers on the Moon. This \nshould give one pause.\n\nWhen my family immigrated to Canada we barely had any money for food. We \nwere in the bottom 1% of the population in terms of wealth and my parents \nworked their way into the top 10% and I'm already in the top 6% by 30 and \nhave dined with world leaders, climbed mountains, and even dated the \ndaughter to a Sultan. All of this and more is not possible without good \nparenting and a focus on education and hard work.\n\nWhen the North American education standard has regressed toward the \nappalling, you should not be aiming to put even less emphasis on it nor \nshould you be taking life lessons for success from an already wealthy 13 \nyear old child who has no clue about struggle in the face of achievement.\ufeff",

La face de Dieu, c'est notre raison ; car de m\u00eame qu'on \nconna\u00eet quelqu'un \u00e0 son visage, ainsi Dieu nous est connu par le miroir de \nla raison. Mais cette raison a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9form\u00e9e par le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 de l'homme, car le \np\u00e9ch\u00e9 rend l'homme oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 Dieu. La gr\u00e2ce du Christ a r\u00e9par\u00e9 notre raison. \nC'est pourquoi l'ap\u00f4tre Paul dit aux \u00c9ph\u00e9siens : \u00ab Renouvelez votre esprit \n\u00bb (4,23). La lumi\u00e8re dont il est question dans ce psaume c'est donc la \ngr\u00e2ce, qui restaure l'image de Dieu empreinte en notre nature... \n\n\nToute la Trinit\u00e9 a marqu\u00e9 l'homme \u00e0 sa ressemblance. Par la m\u00e9moire, il \nressemble au P\u00e8re ; par l'intelligence, il ressemble au Fils ; par l'amour, \nil ressemble au Saint Esprit... Lors de la cr\u00e9ation, l'homme a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00ab \u00e0 \nl'image et \u00e0 la ressemblance de Dieu \u00bb (Gn 1,26). Image dans la \nconnaissance de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ; ressemblance dans l'amour de la vertu. La \nlumi\u00e8re de la face de Dieu c'est donc la gr\u00e2ce qui nous justifie et qui \nr\u00e9v\u00e8le de nouveau l'image cr\u00e9\u00e9e. Cette lumi\u00e8re constitue tout le bien de \nl'homme, son vrai bien ; elle le marque, comme l'image de l'empereur marque \nla pi\u00e8ce d'argent. C'est pourquoi le Seigneur ajoute : \u00ab Rendez \u00e0 C\u00e9sar ce \nqui est \u00e0 C\u00e9sar. \u00bb Comme s'il disait : De m\u00eame que vous rendez \u00e0 C\u00e9sar son \nimage, ainsi rendez \u00e0 Dieu votre \u00e2me, orn\u00e9e et marqu\u00e9e de la lumi\u00e8re de sa \nface.\n\nSaint Antoine de Padoue (v. 1195-1231), franciscain, docteur de l'\u00c9glise \nSermons pour le dimanche et les f\u00eates des saints (trad.

Je doute qu'avec tes 50 ans tu aies ne serait-ce qu'une \nportion de mon exp\u00e9rience de vie; surtout en ce qui concerne les drogues... \non voit clairement que tes notions sont en surface uniquement.\nMaintenant... je ne veux pas argumenter ni discuter parce que tu es le \ngenre de personne qui n'est pas capable de discuter autrement qu'en \nessayant d'imposer ton point de vue douteux que tu essayes pourtant de \nfaire passer pour une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 universelle. En plus du fait que tu estimes \nque d'autres se font juge... alors que tu te permets de juger de bien \nnombreuses personnes dans tes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents commentaires.\nMon beau-p\u00e8re est Gilles Langloys -- le seul Chaman reconnu de France et \nl'auteur de la Gu\u00e9rison de l'habitat. J'ai beaucoup \u00e9cout\u00e9 ce qu'il avait \u00e0 \ndire et j'ai appris de ses enseignements. Je me suis ouvert \u00e0 beaucoup de \nchoses autour de moi -- mais rien de ce que tu pr\u00e9tends \u00eatre ce qui est.\nTu penses \u00eatre sur un plan spirituel sup\u00e9rieur au sien? Tu te crois \nsup\u00e9rieure? Pr\u00e9tention, pr\u00e9somption, mensonge sont des mots qui te si\u00e9ent \u00e0 \nmerveille d'apr\u00e8s tes commentaires pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Tu es pleine de vent et de \nhaine lorsque l'on te met en doute.\nTu n'es ouverte et instruite en rien -- sauf de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9tendue. Je peux \nprouver de mani\u00e8re simple qu'il est mon beau-p\u00e8re (et contrairement \u00e0 tes \npr\u00e9tendus documentaires sur la drogue tu peux trouver ses ouvrages sur \ninternet).\nQuand tu auras 51 ans j'esp\u00e8re que ton hypocrisie & ta mythomanie auront \ndisparues.\nContrairement \u00e0 toi... c'est mon dernier commentaire et je ne suis \nintervenu de nouveau que parce que tu crachais un venin haineux sur deux \nautres personnes.\nJe tire ma r\u00e9v\u00e9rence.",

                "text": "As usual, this is another TED (x) talk that sounds great and makes people \nfeel good, but is ultimately naive and pointless.\n\nI mean, people realize that these types of \"creative\" home schooling is \nonly possible because so few kids do it right? The public education system \nis responsible for educating and evaluating hundreds of thousands of \nstudents, if not more. Inevitably, this requires a systemic structure and \nmechanical teaching techniques. It is unfeasible to accommodate for the \ncreativity and subjectivity of a large number of people.\n\nSure, elementary schools could be more creative, but beyond that it is \nutterly stupid. Like the examples that he gave, could you imagine bringing \na whole class of high school students on a field trip just to learn about \nnewton's laws? And also doing something \"creative\" and \"fun\" for everything \nthey're supposed to learn? They would learn less in a whole school year \nthan what we are currently learning in a month.\n\nNot to mention the extremely subjective and unreliable marks that these \nhome schools produce. This kid will be having fun building stuff to \"learn\" \nwhile other traditional school students actually read a textbook and do the \nwork. How are universities supposed to pick applicants if everyone's \nsubmissions resulted from a unique, unregulated, non-standardized, \npick-your-own-adventure education? They can't.\n\nThat's why things are the way they are now. They're reliable, standardized, \nefficient, and are able to accommodate the mass numbers of students that \nneed an education. These \"creative\" homeschooling or alternative schooling \nprograms only work because they exist in small numbers. So again, like most \nof these videos: great food for thought, but not practically useful.\ufeff",

My children learn more in one summer of school \nin the forest, on any subjects: astronomy, physics, medicine and \nliterature, than school year. Kids were relaxed, and attending classes at \nsuitable to them time( there were several lectures during the day) and were \nfree to leave and come as they were more interested in one subject, or \nanother. In just one summer they learn a year's programme at home too. I \nwas also self- educated. Point is: school can't make you smart, If you are: \nyou need your space to think, and concentrate; and you will learn. If you \nare not a good learner, school will only emboss some basic knowledge into \nyour memory, but won't make you intelligent. In the end, while sitting at \nthose desks, kids will not learn how to be smart, but also miss the \nopportunity to practice things they might well be good at (be that a \nsportsman, or  a seller). There is talent for something in everyone, and \nschool makes everyone follow one pattern, not all; depriving children of \nopportunity to develop their own. I love university, since we choose for it \nourselves, and follow our natural interests there, and are free to leave \nonce it does not give us knowledge we seek; but school- it's imprisonment \nof mind and talents. Mostly a place of competitiveness and bullying, and \nfollowing trends. HIghly intelligent children don't like classical school \nsystem, and often rebel. Wasting energy on fighting to have some time for \nthemselves, fighing social standarts; instead of using all the time for \ntheir creativity and talents- that's school.",

Yes textbooks, curriculums, teachers, etc. vary across the \ncountry, but they're still GENERALLY similar and reliable (might be worse \nfor the US, idk). Homeschooling can be compliant with public school \ncurriculums, but its too hard to actually regulate each individual home \nschool and ensure proper procedures. Yes, there are problems with many \npublic school systems, and yes, there are probably many great home schools, \nbut overall I would still have more faith in the marks of someone who went \nthrough a public school system than someone who was schooled in their own \nhome by their parents.\n\nAnd in regards to the \"are they trying to make it fun for anyone?\" point. I \ndon't care whether or not they're trying to make it fun. I'm just saying \nthat the traditional teaching method of teaching from a textbook in the \nclassroom is fast and efficient. If they're going to change the teaching \nmethod to something that is \"creative\", such as going on field trips or \ndoing experiments, each topic would take a long time and students wouldn't \nlearn nearly as much as they are now every school year.",

                    "text": "+Jeremy Li I have to respectfully disagree with some of your points. You \ndid say that elementary schools could be more creative and I agree. My mom \nwas an elementary school teacher who was incredibly creative in her \nmethods. She was able to do this by accommodating for the creativity of her \nwhole class through a variety of methods, but one was centers. Centers \nevolved from Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. This theory \nalso gives validity to your comment that making everything then learn fun \nimpractical. Obviously what is fun for one person might be tedious to the \nnext, but I think one of his points is are they trying to make it fun for \nanyone? To address the comment about unreliable marks of home schoolers I'd \nlike to point out most college bound home schoolers still take the SATs. \nThat is a big part of how students are admitted still. I am very interested \nto know why you think the education system is standardized? Academically \nstandards, textbooks, curriculums, and lesson plans vary not just from \nstate to state but from teacher to teacher. In the last decade there have \nbeen schools here in Arizona where the students were instructed in their \nfirst language of Spanish with English comprehension being so low the \nteachers had to translate the questions on the state tests. Their are \nschool with little to no budgets where the majority of the class is \nstruggling to work at grade level while schools in wealthier districts are \nable to take advantage of tax credit money and have rock walls in pe, \ngardens on campus, and iPads for every student. The whole reason common \ncore is becoming so popular is it is an attempt to create standardization \nwhere there hasn't been. Maybe schools are more standardized in your area, \nbut in AZ I'm sad to say we are struggling. This young man's ideas are not \nall completely impractical. I hope the people in charge continue to seek \nhow to grow and better our education system.",

But its pure and simple, pick careers that make \nyou happy for as much power you have in picking the career. But don't try \nto conform your happiness around a particular career or try to make a \nparticular career into happiness. Do what makes you happy and healthy is \nwhat I got out of it. \nWhich is wise in its simplicity. Becomes more difficult when trying to fill \nthis out in detail when life hits.

But at the same time, I think there's a part of \nus that doesn't want to make the mistakes of the past, and want to strive \nto a better version of the future. You cannot loose sight of the \nperiod/moment you are experiencing right now, and if you do so, you will be \nout of your own time. \n\nAnd at the same time, think about our family/traditions/education/cultural \nparadigms. Aren't we being grown with a \"methodology\" of life based in the \npast, suposedly useful for the future? I think we are constantly \"present\" \nin all the time periods at once. I don't wish to enter to the realms of \nexistencialism right now, but our conscious awareness make us go further of \nwhat is only flesh and bone, and therefore, meaning and explanation of \neverything.  \n\nAnyways, it's important to take into account what you've just said about \nwhat approach of \"time\" we use in order to create our current reality.",

Also, \nthere are many different types of intelligence. IQ, of course, is one of \nthe main ones. There is also intelligence in the patterns of your thoughts \n(which are technically created by the combination of your brain chemistry \nand environment/experiences) and intelligence in understanding others. The \nlatter is known as EQ, or Emotional Intelligence Quotient. Having a high IQ \nis only one piece of the puzzle for mastery of self, and doesn't \nautomatically mean you can out-think anyone. It simply means that your \nbrain operates in a way that is higher than average for the specific things \nthat an IQ test measures.

I agree with you about the \nmajority of homeschoolers just keeping kids out for the sake of religious \nreasons. We had to leave a homeschool group once because of the gay \nbashing. (I am not gay, but my niece is. It felt kind of insulting to me to \nhave to stand and listen to a group of parents...well you know how people \ncan be.) I have met some in our group that are sweet parents, but they seem \nto take their children's education for granted. For instance when I asked \nthis one lady we met up with at the park, \"So have your kids finished all \ntheir work for today?\" She replied, \"Well no, we mostly just did chores and \nthey read a little bit from their weekly reader. We may or may not get to \nit today.\" My question is how many days does that happen? If it's all the \ntime then they are better off in school. Some I know just do reading and \nmath then use the Bible for science and history. Then of course their are a \nlot that go by a program that keeps them at home all the time and they \nhaven't got much of a social life. My philosophy is you just have to find \nthe right balance. If you want to teach your children about religion \nthen they need to understand that there are many religions out there. If \nthey thought everybody believed the same thing when they moved out on their \nown...that would end in culture shock.",

If \nyour not a native English speaker than I hope if you live in America that \nyou moved from a foreign country, and in the event that you have then you \nwould probably not understand just how bad of an education some kids would \nbe getting by going to their local public school. I have seen it myself. My \nkids as previously stated are homeschooled because they get a better \neducation here. When my son was in his kindergarten year of homeschool, he \nhelped his first grade cousin who was in public school learn how to read. \nShe recently got put in the K12 program at home. She should be in the 6th \ngrade, but could not do the math. They bumped her back to 5th and my son \nhas been helping her catch up. I'm glad he can. It is a great challenge \nteaching three different grade levels at once! I would not send my kids to \nthat school system though. One child learns from another sometimes and it \nis at a higher grade level. For instance my 1st grader has learned \nmultiplication and division simply by sitting at the table with the older \ntwo. Another thing people do not know about homeschoolers is they do have \nmeet ups with other homeschoolers. Our kids get to do things that some \nschools don't get to. Last year we visited the Air Force base, fire \nstation, police station, had picnics and play dates at the park with other \nhomeschoolers a.k.a. friends!  We went to a neat little farm, the youngest \nhad a fancy little Kindergarten graduation etc. At the end of the year \nafter taking the state tests the oldest passed on grade level. Only the \noldest because the younger two do not take the test till the end of their \nthird grade year, and I know when they do they will do great. ",

School does not promote happiness or life, rather this crazy \nfocus on education. And you know, if you grow up in a prison, you don't \n\"know\" what real life is. \"What you don't know you can't compare\". If you \nread some \"happiness\" books you will find out that your happiness level \nrange can go from 1-10 and for some others 5-50. So if you grew up in a \nprison, you would think that is what makes you \"happy\". \n\nThat's true, but the purpose of life is not happiness, in my view. It's \nexpercining life fully. Its up and downs, and you cannot do that in school. \nOur striving for happiness is killing humanity. Our fear for \"negative\" \nfeelings and emotions is actually what creates this sub conscious \nsuffering. Suffering only occurs when you deny life. ",

(Hint: no part of this infographic \nstates or supports that claim.) In fact, there is one part of the \ninfographic which DOES show education level of parents, and shows that 90%+ \nof homeschooling parents have at least some college.  Guess what?  This is \na greater level of education than parents of public-school parents, so that \nright there completely rejects your claim (you think 29% of public school \nparents have a Masters or Doctorate degree like the guy in this picture???)\n\nThis infographic is 100% unscientific data manipulation, and here's why: \n Socio-economic-status HAS, in fact, been proven to be a huge factor in \neducational performance.  What the homeschooling stats here don't show is \nthat the vast majority of students in many public schools are low-SES, \nwhile the majority of homeschooled children are higher-SES.  So saying \nthings like \"homeschoolers score in the 87th percentile\" is completely not \nscientifically valid -- because you aren't isolating the variable (the \nconfounding variable here is SES, among others: single vs. dual-parent \nhome, for example.)\n\nThe only way to have ANY validity to these claims would be to compare \nhomeschoolers to public schoolers of the same background (not very easy to \ndo, due to the variety of factors, but finding scores of those with the \nsame mean or median income levels, or income-relative-to-state-average, for \nexample, would be a start.)\n\nOh, and then there's the outright fallacious claim that the average \nhomeschool family spends only $500 per year.  Nope, false -- because there \nis an opportunity cost that is being spent when a parent stays home instead \nof having a job. If that parent even worked just a minimum wage job, they \nwould be earning at least $15,000 per year.  Therefore, homeschooling is \ncosting the family at LEAST $15,000/year -- or >50% more than the per-pupil \ncost of public schools.\n\nMy homeschooled cousin is from a two-parent, reasonably-high SES... and \nafter \"graduating\", he went on to work as a retail clerk at GameStop. \nShould I put THAT on an infographic?",

It is a good idea, and valuable at many levels. However, \nto put it into practice at a national level, it needs to consider ways by \nwhich to make it feasible in economic terms, so that it becomes available \nto everyone.\nA great presentation and an amazing perspective on education, no doubt! My \nonly concern though, is regarding the opportunistic feature of it (as \nexplained by the boy). Community life is only called upon when useful to \nthe person under this type of education. Even if it is said that work in \ncommunity is an aspect of it (of this kind of education), the hacker \nmindset is worrying to the extent as it disregards the freedom of others. \nTo think creatively is definitely FUNDAMENTAL but so it is to think about \nthe Other, for the Other\u2019s sake \u2013 not ours.\nOne cannot be happy without the Other and without contemplating his or her \nown interests \u2013 something often implies giving in. Happiness has to do with \na symbiotic notion of community and not with a harsh or insensitive \nprocedure that often characterizes the work of hackers who are literally \nonly after fulfilling their own plans, disregarding whoever may constitute \nand obstacle to the achievement of their idea. \nHaving said this though, this kid is definitely a 5 start speaker and if he \ncontinues this way, a bright future awaits him!\nThanks for the post.

I \nread where Logan said he had got some critiques, and I believe one was \nabout people wanting him to take things out that were his favorite parts so \nhe rewrote it and memorized it in 3 days. This was published on an ESPN \nrelated site; reputable. His Dad is a quality guy, business and community \nwise from what I've read. So when I read somewhere where he says, as I \nrecall reading it \"I wish I could take credit for Logan's talk, but he \nworked real hard on that.\" I believe it. Why? Because I've looked into it \nenough to know his Dad is very reputable. It makes sense Logan's parents \nare bringing up two awesome kids, Logan and Cody LaPlante, each talented in \ntheir own way. And Btw, no I don't know them; I've just read up on this a \nlot, as I've not seen a kid as all around talented as Logan on TEDx, and \nwhen you look into it, you'll see why; it's the way he was raised. For \nthose who have the $$ argument; they don't know squat (I say that \ncheerfully not in angst), there are so many-many people that have money \nthat actually raise their kids poorly.

Here in VA, I have to submit \nthe ItH as well as one state approved standardized test score per kid. \nHere, we've opted to go with the California Achievement Test, since VA \napproves of it, the fees are minimal ($25 per kid), and we can take it \nonline, so the results are available immediately as a PDF (minimizes the \nchances of scoring machines screwing up, things getting lost in the mail, \netc).\n\nWe \"get away with\" quite a lot, because outside a very small curriculum \nthat ensures they get to their \"test required milestones\", we utilize \nwhat's around us, the library, and take full advantage of any and all free \nresources we can. When the time comes, the girls can either go for their \nGEDs if they're desperate for a certificate, take a correspondence course \nfor a \"real diploma\", or many colleges simply accept their yearly test \nscores as their transcripts in lieu of a diploma, if they even require a \ndiploma at all (many don't, and happily accommodate homeschoolers of all \nstripes).\n\nNow, as far as economics, yeah, we're definitely \"lucky\" in that we're able \nto keep me home and live on one income so I can facilitate learning for the \nkids. Some families are able to make it work, and I've seen a number of \nother families band together to form co-ops of sorts, wherein families with \nstay at home parents take in neighborhood homeschooled kids while their \nparents are at work, but it's rare because homeschooling and alternative \neducation (if we can be so bold as to umbrella all other forms of \nnon-public-schooling under one term) aren't considered \"normal\" yet.",

Most kids aren't even aware of just how valuable \nthey are and what nurturing environment they're in; and when one does \nbecome aware, by that time, they are usually surfacing from the depths as \nadults.\n\nTo preserve the moment of a child at this particular time in Logan's life, \nis a great testament to our times (long reaching media) and in this \ninstance, to Logan, family unit, and his timeline of life.\n\nI've searched for as much of it as possible, and I'm sure it's only a peek \ninto the way he was raised, but what I have seen is another world and \nit...'means a lot'\n\nSo easy for people to take something beyond us for granted.",

                "text": "Exercise is a big part of gym class and is a required class for all kids. \n\nDiet and Nutrition are handled by the kid's parents while at home and the \nschool's lunch gives kids the required nutrition for said meal. \n\nTime in Nature? This is subjective nonsense, some kids absolutely despise \nnature it's all about the child's personal preference. \n\nContribution and service? Do children really care that much about helping? \nAnytime my nephews decide to \"help\" around the house, they do help for a \nmoment, but quickly grow bored and drop the task. This desire to help seems \nto be mistaken curiosity. \n\nRelationships is a good point. Children should form happy and healthy bonds \nwith others, but this does not mean the child shouldn't be subject to \ncriticism.  A big problem with today's notion of bullying is that it \nprovides a simple but inadequate solution to a very complex problem. \nSometimes a kid needs to be made fun of. It's how we learn humility and \ngrow based on social pressure while it doesn't matter so much. You ever \nwondered why you see so many adults behave like overgrown children? It's \nbecause they were never criticized by their peers. This special snowflake \nsyndrome is causing people to think they're more significant than they \nactually are. Don't get me wrong, I'm not condoning harassment, but a laugh \nor two at little Jimmy's sake isn't a big deal. \n\nRecreation is also a good point. Kids like to play and should be allowed to \ndo so. \n\nRelaxation and stress are also key points that he never really delves into. \n A child should experience a balance of both in order to best prepare them \nfor adulthood. Childhood isn't there to pander to how kid's want to live, \nit's there to make them capable adults. \n\nReligion and spirituality are not a key requirement for a happy child, and \nto say so in front of an audience like it's fact really makes TED look bad. \nThere are many happy secular kids out there. \n\nHealthy, happy and creativity, and the \"hacker\" mindset are important to \neducation are they? \n\nKids should be healthy, but attempting to keep everyone happy all the time \nwill lead to disappointment. Kids need to learn to associate failure with \nsadness or discipline. It's absurd to pretend that keeping these kids happy \nall the time should be up most importance. \n\nCreativity is a good thing in some people, but to say that we should \nharness such a vague concept that varies from person to person and attempt \nto expand upon it is silly and inefficient. You've also got to have a \nwilling kid which ,more often than not, you don't.  \n\nExperimental classes and camps are an absolutely terrible idea to use on a \nlarge sample. What if these new classes and camps don't work properly? What \ndo we do with all the kids we've misinformed? Children aren't test dummies, \nand using this vague new schooling system would create quite a few problems \nin terms of regulation. \n\nTechnology and online resources. Coming from an IT guy who works on \ncomputers kids have been on, I can tell you firsthand that the moment \nthey're put on a computer to work their first instinct is to goof off. \n Their history is 80% games and 20% educational sites of which they will \ninevitably rush through because a computer is a toy and not an instrument \nof learning for them. You've also seen about how well online classes do in \nterms of teaching. This could work if we are able to shift the computer \nfrom a form of entertainment to a tool of learning, but I have no clue how \nto go about doing that. \n\n\"'Hackschooling' is a mind set, not a system,\" he says. This is the \nproblem. You can't possibly hope to enforce this feel good mindset on kids \nfrom the ghetto or broken homes. Kids who have no interest in learning and \nwill abuse this newly proposed system. The traditional education system \nworks because it is that, a system. It needs some work, but it works well \nenough for the average student. \n\nHe also needs to be prepared to write about a prompt and not just what he \nfancies. Part of the dull writing prompts is preparing the student to think \ncritically about something they otherwise would pay no mind to. The stuff \nMs.Page taught us wasn't exactly my top priority in terms of stuff I want \nto write about, but it did teach me about researching and writing a paper \non an unfamiliar subject. I'm glad this kid loves writing, but this will, \nonce again, be abused by those who dislike it. If kid's aren't made to \nbroaden their minds, they never will.  I also dislike how he seems to think \nit's easier to teach yourself than it is to receive instructions from a \nteacher. Could you imagine learning calculus without a teacher? It wouldn't \nwork. The concepts are just too difficult to grasp without someone more \nexperienced guiding you. Self education is akin to deriving the knowledge \nfor yourself. Will it work and stick to your mind better? Yes, but it will \nmove along at an abysmal rate if completed at all because most students \nwill give up. \n\nThey also seem to be spending more time on field trips than actually \nlearning in class. This is neat, but some complex stuff simply cannot be \ndemonstrated. The whole idea of a mathematical concept is demonstrating the \neffect on paper. They also seem to have volunteers from tons of \norganizations to educate these kids. We'll run low on volunteers if this is \napplied to every school. \n\nI could go on, but there are many flaws in this new system of education. It \nis proposed as a solution, but it could do not such thing. It has potential \nin students who show initiative, but cannot easily be applied to every \nstudent.  \ufeff",

On that retarded note: I'm not a \"wanna-be\" \nbut i think you are. You see,  you died your hair black and wear hoodies \nbecause you want to say that you have problems and expect everyone to feel \nsorry for you, the problem with that is that you have a totally fine life \nbut you will never accept that fact, you want to be able to say how bad \nyour life is and show your razor-cut arms to everyone because you have \n\"problems\". I also feel like the reason you stick up for this idealistic \nfaggot is because you want to be part of something bigger, because religion \nwas too \"mainstream\" for you uptight lifestyle, i doubt your going to \nactually read this far but if you do i want to know that you are a special \npile of shit. you are so much worse than every other fucker in this goddamn \ngeneration. you have not given me one valid argument, only excuses and \nrevived ideas of the faggots that followed in your belligerent path. \nEveryone has problems, but you feel like your owed compensation for the \nstress you've been through, where the fuck does that come from? On a \nseparate note, why the fuck wont you accept the fact that I am right, and \neven if I'm not \"right\" who are you to say I,m wrong? and with this in \nmind, what is wrong? what is right? are you judging this by morality, or \nfactual manor? and what is morally right? do I tell the truth about my \nopinion or do I lie so I don't hurt this kids feelings? Is my opinion \nwrong, if so, what factual evidence do you have that your opinion is more \nvalid? is your opinion better than mine? does it hold more relevance? is it \nmore morally correct? is it a factual opinion? the real problem is that you \ndon't know the answer thus disproving your argument, and because we take \nnearly \"opposite\" opinions, and because you are wrong, does that therefore \nimply I am correct? correct in what way? am i correct morally? factually? \nrelevantly? is it more valid? does it represent an answer to the truth? \nwhat truth?: with all of these questions in mind, have you started to \nrealize how unjustified it was to deliberately post your counteractive \nopinion on my clearly shared opinion? I hope you really think about your \nlife, your cut up arms, your coal-dyed hair, your emotional ways, and \nreally look at what you've done, the mess that you've made.

My \nconcern is that if you go through this type of schooling and you study the \n\"wrong\" things you'll find it hard to integrate. Also I'm not sure if \nemployers trust the certification gained in this way. School is not really \nabout what you know, it's possible to learn whatr school teaches by your \nself. But you need school for certification that employers need to see \nbefore they hire you.\n\nAs for this kid, I guess the concern is unwarranted (I even mention it in \nmy comment). As he did say he was studying business and he seems sharp \nenough to know how to leverage the system despite his schooling methods. \nAlso who knows what the future holds this might be the way education works \nin the future.",

Things often \nhave many layers and they seem to flip flop based on our perceptions. So if \none is not turned off, listen. Then listen again and research. Then when \nyou get to the 2nd or 3rd layers, listen again and research. If you're \nstill inspired, learn as much as you can and then go back up to the \nsurface. I think you'll find that Logan's story is almost surely a great \none, nurtured from a very young age (and he's just 13yo here). Amazing. \nWith his great talent and skills come great challenges by the nature of \nmaintaining that talent and skill; so in the end, money, though it matters \nvery much for those just getting by, still at any level of survival, has \nits challenges (resources; sustainability).

                    "text": "+Arpit Waghmare\nOh \"faith\"! That's a fascinating topic for education... for me. Though it \nextends beyond \"schooling\" (even homeschooling) because in a sense we are \nwitnesses, evangelists and even missionaries to our children... though of \ncourse in the best of ways (in that way I too agree that we must not force, \ncoerce or \"buy\"/reward their faith). When dealing with faith I have my own \npresuppositions.... and so I govern my actions around those.\n\n1. (in no particular order)... there is no neutral non-faith space. Every \nspace is influenced by a worldview/religion/ideological perspective. \nWestern *and now eastern* animated/non-animated media for instance is one \nof those powerful (though sometimes seemingly neutral) perspectives that \ninfluence that attitudes, perspectives and sometimes even \nactions/behaviours of our children (not all is bad, though, i also think, \nespecially if parents are involved in the watching/interpreting).\n2. Children need help/guidance in what is reality AND how to interpret the \nreality they see. Their \"why\" questions are research questions... they want \nto know... not just the \"truth\" but what is the correct perspective... how \nto look at reality. (they may not be aware of it, but they are asking for \nboth content AND method to get that content). Sometimes we give too much \ncontent, sometimes we give good content with wrong methods, and sometimes \ngood method with wrong content. Ideally, and I think I agree with you, that \nwe want our children to be able to question, make decisions for themselves, \nbe assertive (in a positive way, not be swayed), and be humble etc.... and \nmuch of this comes through the WAY we arrive at the answer and how we \ncommunicate and not simply in telling a child the answer.\n3. Faith, the Christian faith, I believe, is one such perspective... like \nthe world's perspective. And it is ok for christian parents to speak from \nwithin that perspectives... hence to pray, to go to Church, etc will \nnaturally influence the child, but to NOT go to church because we want the \nchild to be \"free\" is another perspective as well, that will also \ninfluencing the child... (even if it seems more politically correct)... \n(for example, one our friends are raising their daughter to make up their \nown mind about faith, but it looks as if they themselves have wanted to \nkeep an open mind about their own faith). So I think our faith expression \nin the lives of our children is a valid, necessary, and God-given mandate \nfor our children.\n4. Another assumption... children are not ready to understand/comprehend \ngrapple with all the perspectives/ideologies the world has to offer.  And \nso, to intentionally go out and see alternative theories to God, especially \nif it is forced as a curriculum, rather that emerging out of natural \nconversation and exposure... may not be the best way to treat the child... \nand may even overwhelm them. Certainly some difference is needed, but \ndifference, lack of \"truth\" / even alternatives, are evident more easily \nthan we think. Starting from our own contradictions as parents where we do \nnot live up to our own high ideals (and then we tell Taarika that we are \nnot acting as we would want)... to talking about the neighbouring temple, \nBeatles music (that is not about Jesus, but still nice to listen to), to \nunderstanding the context of festivals like Diwali/holi to the recognition \nthat there are those who believe in Jesus and those who do not. Apart from \nthis exposure... which in itself is so much that needs a lot to process and \nunpack... I don't think we need to go too much out of our way to enforce \nthe exposure to difference... especially we if remain critically away of \nthe differences close within.\n5. I assume that the right method is one that takes a lot of time and \ncannot always be communicated through content (ie. we cannot \"tell\" the \nright method). In terms of the method for faith, therefore, I also believe \nthat the true way of understanding takes time. While I do want a child to \nbe critical/self critical/parent critical.... I also believe that it takes \ntime and maturity on the part of the child. In time the child, I think, \nwill go through the next phase of the journey.... we need not enforce \nself-critical processes/methods right now. So while we do a lot of faith \nexpressions (sometimes overt and sometimes less overt), still we have also \ntried to express that true understanding (ie. true belief in Jesus.. and \nhow I express it to taarika is the ability to not just talk to God but \nlisten to Him and be led by Him... comes through time... when she is older \n(and in my view .... which at this age I will not tell her just yet... \nthrough the process of being critical of parent's faith and deciding for \nherself if this is indeed true). Here again, I would trust the child to \ngrow up feeling resentment to the parents and parent's faith. Almost all \nthe people I've had a serious conversation with about their childhood to \nmaturity journey... have confessed of something like this.... a journey \nthat takes place... for some it is a crisis... for others it is less \ndramatic... but the process where the parent's God, the Sunday School God, \nthe Bible God, the God of Abraham, becomes my God, will take time... and is \nprone to risk... because the child may, regardless of parenting, choose \nanother way, but it is at that moment the freedom to choose by the parent \nwill be most critical and hardest.\n\nSo... within these assumptions I operate. There are certainly many more... \nbut mainly on the issue of \"freedom\" and \"exposure\" I mention these.",

                    "text": "For Christian homes \u00ad does Jesus exploring his own education/faith at age 12\nring a bell? :-) I am grappling with the need to give our children autonomy\neven in what they believe. Perhaps they need to be given freedom even to\nexplore their own journey with God. Been reading Peck lately and agree with\nmuch of what he says about what he calls 'spiritual growth.' Of course this\nmust be done within boundaries \u00ad and that is the struggle \u00ad how do we define\nthose? Maybe a good answer is to model the faith at home, have our family\nprayer, conversations about God, learning of Bible verses but give them the\nfreedom to adopt it for themselves when they are ready (as against\norchestrating the process).At some stage (when?) the kids should be free to\nevaluate the faith of their parents in the light of their own experiences\nand other world views. For this they need to be exposed. Hence I believe if\nthey are participating in the faith practices at home, it is all the more\nimportant for their education to help them critically interact with their\nfaith \u00ad rather than unduly reinforce it. That might lead to superficial\nfaith. Hence I would like my kids to understand evolution deeply rather than\nprotect them from the world view of the evolutionists! I believe this\napproach is less dangerous and more rewarding than it sounds.\n\nWould love to hear opposing viewpoints. Will really help us flesh out stuff!",

In saying that \nyou are \". . . sooo surprised that no one mentioned it here by now . . .\" \nyou have demonstrated that you have yet to take the time to review a \nrepresentative sampling of the available comments.\n\nYou have also evidently have yet to perform a simple Internet search using \n\"logan laplante\" as your search phrase.  Had you done so, you would have \nbeen able to learn that Logan wrote and delivered his TEDx talk as a change \nfrom his three previous years tackling of Young Chataqua events as a \npresenter.  Developing and delivering this talk was a schoolwork assignment \nthat he challenged himself to.\n\nAs to the content being \"ok\" . . . I observe that Logan's presentation is \nresonating strongly with families, educators, and publications all over the \nworld.  You don't see that with something that's just \"ok\".\n\nSo . . . as one of the \"guys\" you so artfully put down as not being \nobservant, may I be the first to respectfully request that you turn your \nskills as a trained (and practicing?) psychologist to actually spending \nsome time researching what this young man as accomplished through his TEDx \ntalk and reporting back to us at your earliest convenience?\n\nOnce you have done so, you may find that an apology to Logan and his family \nis in order.",

The fact that we now have \nnearly four million views of the video here is a testament to the fact that \nLogan has managed to gain world-wide interest as a result of his family's \nand his educational philosophy.\n\nSkiing does take some money, but there are many ways for a family that is \ninvolved in competitive skiing to significantly reduce most of the costs.  \nLogan and his brother are top competitors for their age groups.  The family \ngoes above and beyond in terms of cost-savings to support the competition \ntracks the boys are on.\n\nWilderness adventures are extremely low-cost for families that live in \nlocations surrounded by wilderness and public lands.  The area where \nLogan's family lives certainly qualifies in that respect\n\nWhile it may be a little easier to support a homeschool / hackschool \nlifestyle at a certain financial comfort level or above, it's not necessary \nfor a family to be wealthy in order to homeschool.  There are many cases of \nsingle-parent households with incomes well below governmentally-recognized \npoverty levels who have successfully homeschooled their children.  What is \nnecessary for this to happen is for the parent(s) to make a conscious \ndecision to place their children's educational needs at the top of the \nfamily budget priority tree, right behind food and shelter.\n\nWhile many child actors can appear to be poised, that's certainly not \nnecessarily true.  Most of them are working from a script.  Logan was \nworking from the product of the educational process leading up to his \npresentation.  He's the one who put it all together.  (He wanted a change \nfrom his previous participation in the Young Chautauqua program.)  In order \nto make it all work, he had to be a goal-oriented self-starter.  A large \npart of that comes from family values, work ethic, and many other positive \nattributes.\n\nHis leaving the traditional educational setting for homeschooling / \nhackschooling is, as you note, not the reason he is so \"seemingly smart\".  \nWhat it does demonstrate, however, is that he has escaped the restraints of \nthe traditional classroom and the pressures (formal or informal) against \nperformance at a student's maximum potential.\n\nHomeschooling does not produce geniuses.  It can, however, allow a student \nwith a high IQ to become educated in an environment that encourages \nengaging with information at a higher level than is possible in a \ntraditional classroom setting where teachers generally have to work within \nimposed standards more often designed to produce good workers than fully \nactualized leaders, thinkers, and innovators.  While our public education \nsystem has produced creative thinkers, you are correct in stating that this \ndoesn't happen at the rate we need for the challenges we face as a society.\n\nYour jab at homeschooling producing \"people who think the world was created \n6,000 years ago\" is entirely gratuitous and inappropriate in the extreme.  \nJust as our society has extreme progressives and extreme conservatives, \nfamilies who participate in homeschooling / hackschooling come from all \nwalks of life and all belief systems.  While their numbers are smaller than \nthose families who use the public school system, you'll likely find that \nthe bell curve is similar for both groups.\n\nI have known homeschooling families who are extreme off-the-grid \nprogressives living in yurts, and I've known some who are devout \nevangelical Christians.  I've also known homeschooling families all across \nthe socioeconomic and spiritual spectrum.  The one point they all have in \ncommon is that their children are nearly all well ahead of their age \ncohorts in educational achievement, regardless of the IQ or socioeconomic \nfactors they start with.  These are going to be some of our most successful \nadults and societal influencers.\n\nLook at society as a bird.  Every bird has to have a fully formed and \nfunctional left and right wing.  So, too, for human society.\n\nAs to your final point . . . no, I did not find Logan to be \"spoiled\" or \nsmart-alecky\".  I saw a confident, witty young man who put himself into a \nposition to talk about his passions and his chosen path of education.  We \ncould do with more like him.",
