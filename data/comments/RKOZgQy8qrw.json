In this category, two negatives are \nused in the same sentence or clause to express a positive idea rather than \na negative one. For instance, in the sentence:\n\nBlake was not unaware of his appearance.\n\nthe writer is using two negatives to say in a subtle and indirect way that \nBlake was in fact very aware of his appearance. This sort of double \nnegative with a positive result is an aspect of the rhetorical technique \nknown as litotes, in which deliberate understatement or denial is used to \nreinforce a statement. The double negative creates a nuance of meaning that \nwould not be present had the writer just made an affirmative statement such \nas:\n\nBlake was aware of his appearance.\"",
