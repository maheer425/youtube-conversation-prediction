                    "text": "@ Kali Dallas - Different flours are used for different purposes. They have \ndifferent gluten contents and can be made of hard or soft wheat. Bread \nflour has a high gluten content and is made from hard wheat, which is why \nwhen it reacts with yeast it gives you that soft fluffy interior with a \ncrispy, crunchy outer crust. Obviously, if you're making a cake or a tender \nbutter cookie (like this recipe) you'll want something that's going to give \nyou a soft, delicate texture (which is why you would use cake flour). \n\nAs for Vanillina, each packet is about .5 grams which should be equal to \nabout a teaspoon of vanilla extract. However, Vanillina has a very \nconcentrated vanilla flavor and does not add any brown coloring like an \nextract will add. Be sure to use a high quality vanilla extract such as \nNielsen-Massey to get a similar strong vanilla flavor. Most regular store \nbought extracts will impart an alcohol aftertaste.",
