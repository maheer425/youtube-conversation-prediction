                    "text": "+50ftFrankenstein From my understanding, 12 is just a nation wide standard \nbasically set to sperate different severities of sexual misconduct with a \nminor.  Most local standards in Japan state a specific older age.\n\nIt actually makes sense if you think about it.  A person shouldn't get the \nsame punishment for fucking a 16 year old as they would for molesting a 9 \nyear old.\n\nIn the state I live in in the US the legal age of consent is 16 period \nexcept for instances where the sexual partner is in the position of \ncaregiver or guardian.  Then it is 18.  So legally, a 70 year old man could \nhave sex with a willing 16 year old.  I know this because when I was 19 I \ndated a girl who was 16.  ",

The person with the absolutely lowest IQ \nhad a value of 14, but she's disabled. Funny thing I stumbled upon while \nsearching for that: The person with the IQ of 42 was part of an experiment, \nin which she met Stephen Hawking and talked to him for several hours (he \nhas an IQ of about 190). But according to the online article, Hawking got \nlate and she had to wait almost 10 hours. After 7 hours she first noticed \nthat Hawking wasn't already there and that she had been waiting for a long \ntime. So it's not just about knowing and not knowing. Hell... this just got \nfrom very funny to extremely sad... anyone here to raise the mood? Did you \never hear of something like what I told about in my first comment?",

People \n(English natives) need to spell properly because the majority of native \nEnglish speakers spell like a bunch of 1st graders. The fun part? I know \nlots of people that have English as their second language, and they spell \nit perfectly fine as if it was their native language, compared to the \npeople who have it as their native language and talk like \"omg ! r u \nserious ? tat is so cute!\" or we have the idiots that cap every word like \n\"You Sure About That?

At \nleast it's better than any other regular show's (see what I did there?) \nwriting these days. I can't really give any opinion on the character \ndevelopment though, since I've only seen a few episodes of each.\n\nIn the 21st century, show writers and show creators believe that some \ngeneric character who has a repeating line that gets annoying after a while \nwith them screaming loudly and just making their actions and sayings \ncompletely retarded is funny to an average American child. That's how \nSpongebob went down hill. They stopped focusing on the writing and \ncharacter development and instead went for overused butt jokes and \nexcessive screaming. I hope I made my point clear, I'm not too good at \nexplaining things.\n\nShows like Gravity Falls and Steven Universe I can actually respect because \nthe show writers try to AVOID the kind of stuff they see in regular shows \n(hey I did it again!) these days, and they do a pretty good job at it. As \nlong as they do that, they can focusing on the characters and figure out \nhow to NOT make them like an annoying or useless character that's just... \nthere. In The Amazing World of Gumball and Regular Show, you can see that \nthey add in some bits of drama and eventually go full on reality show \ndrama. They try, but it just doesn't fit in too well and is expected to be \na show more like other regular shows (Okay, I'll stop) you see nowadays. I \ndon't believe it's the setting that or scenery of the show that sets off \nthe mood for drama, but instead it's the characters, because you'd expect \nthem to act all stupid but all of a sudden they're acting like it's the end \nof the world. Not that they don't act like that in every damn episode, but \nyou get my point.\n\nWhatever happened to Fanboy and Chum Chum or Sanjey and Craig? Those shows \nare dead now, right? They were only up for a season or half a season, and \nnow they're dead. You see what can happen? You don't want to be going down \nthat road. The creators just want money and fame, which ends up with their \nshows failing. Those who actually care for their viewers are the ones who \nare going to get the fame and money with out even asking for it in the \nfirst place.",

As for Regular Show, it may be someone \nrepetitive at times, but it can be creative and sometimes funny as well (In \nmy opinion).
