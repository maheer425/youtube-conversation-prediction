At \nleast those non english speaking players don't constantly whine and feed. \nHell, today some guy (obviously american) kept making settle hints about \nhow i should be warding, when I WAS, and he kept feeding alone himself. \nWhile I was trying to defend my point all he was doing is calling me \nmexican shit and talking about \"all my cousins\" and shit, idk.

When I \nfirst started playing Dota 2 I had the impression that everyone just picked \na hero and played. The tutorial does nothing to teach some of the most \nimportant parts of the game: team composition, using teamwork, and adapting \nto the situation. All the time I see people play terribly because they just \npick whatever hero they want to play as and have no regard for the team and \nwhen things start going bad they continue to play the same way that gets \nthem killed. The tutorial on Dota 2 needs to be reworked. The last hit \ntraining was a nice step in the right direction, but the tutorial needs to \nteach how to lane, how to pick heroes, how to work with your team, how to \nturn around games, how to adapt to the situation, how to survive and not be \nreckless, and it needs to encourage new players to watch/read guides and \ntry to keep learning about the game outside of just playing.\ufeff",
