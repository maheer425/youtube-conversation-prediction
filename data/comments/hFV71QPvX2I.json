Please do not generalise \"the people\" as many totalitarian \npeople have in their argument: if you find the subject simple then it \nreflects your ability and understanding more than their expression and \n\"depth\" of knowledge in this video. This is no specialist class: it \nportrays itself as being a \"Crash Course\". Read if you want to learn more, \nwhether in academic books or using Google Scholar for articles: it doesn't \nmatter. The pursuit of personal knowledge satisfaction and ergo \ncontribution to humanity DOES matter. We are a people built on it.

You really \ncan't prove that gravity exists as we think it does, because if it just \nfails one time, fx if it is 10% weaker tomorrow, then the theory has been \ndisproved and a new hypothesis has to be formed. As of right now, gravity \nfollows the same rules every time, every where, and has never been proven \nuntrue.

It is a misconception that we all end up as clinicians. \nMany PhDs in clinical psychology are employed teaching at universities and \ndoing research. As a MA student in experimental psychology (behavioral \nscience), I will offer the anecdote that almost every psychology textbook \nand course I have encountered in both my undergraduate and graduate career \ncovers research methods in the first few lessons. Entire courses on \nresearch methods and quantitative methods are required at some point in \nboth undergraduate and graduate coursework. Often the classes even serve, \neither unintentionally or intentionally, as bottleneck courses that can \nprevent students from progressing further in the degree. I will not deny \nthat psychology has methodological issues, both historical (even Watson \nhimself) and current, but there is an active movement to correct the \nproblems.

I worry \nthat people forget how to learn and retain information correctly. As I \nlearned in my psychology class, remembering is a process. It involves \nrepeating, applying and associating the subject that is being learned. \nAnyone who watches this will get a feeling that they understood much, but \nwill retain very little. I would not leave the retaining and memorizing \npart of teaching up to the student. Just like using google instead of \npiling through a mental lexicon dumbs down a persons ability to recall \ninformation, these videos too teach people to bounce thoughts around in \ntheir head. They skip from one point to the next. Creating attention spans \nequivalent to that of a chipmunk. In a society marred by ADD, ADHD and \nlearning disabilities I find it rather important that we work to increase \nstudents focus and attention instead of reinforcing bad learning habits \nlike this video does. I understand that we can just rewind the video, but \nrewinding is not, and should not be part of the learning process. (already \nposted this but it is relevant here)",
