                "text": "Psych question regarding the last example: Which coffee shop do you think \nwould get more focus? I'd imagine that people would visit the \"free \nTuesday\" shop often on Tuesdays, and maybe that would encourage people to \nbuy more coffee to alleviate the withdrawal.\n\nHowever, I think the \"lottery\" coffee shop would get more business, as we \nhave a tendency to ignore negative reinforcements of our perceptions, and \nfocus on positive reinforcements. Thus, people would buy lots of coffees \nthere, even if the win rate was below the \"buy 10 get 1 free\" shop, as it \nwould allow us to focus on and emphasize our inherent belief that we're \nluckier or better than other people.\n\nAnybody else care to comment on which shop they think would get more \nbusiness, or critique (constructively) my viewpoint?\ufeff",

Usually during fixed-ratio schedules there is a pause after the \nreinforcer is delivered, so the shop might go through periods of high and \nlow attendance. However since coffee is so addicting that might not \nactually happen. Those that are lucky enough to constantly win a free drink \nin less than 10 tries would probably stick to the \"lottery\" shop. I imagine \nthat shop would have a lot of the same customers since variable-ratio \nschedules are usually associated with lottery addictions.",

Fast food places do similar things to that one, \nprobably on \"clean out the coffee maker\" day (so not equal quality). \nOtherwise, I'd go with the reliable discount of buying 10 to get a free one.\nBut in the real world, I'm not going to cross to the other side of a \ndivided highway to get the freebie, and I'm going to go with the \nbetter-tasting choice over the occasional savings, unless it is grossly \noverpriced.

People also really like to \nfeel like they're part of a \"club\" and that there's a sure reward at the \nend.\n\nI agree with you about the lottery mentality but that tends to be amplified \nwhen the reward is larger (which is why the huge sums of money lotteries \nare so popular) and less so when it's something small like a coffee. \nAlthough, if the lottery was a mix of free coffees and big prizes then, \neven though next to no one would win the big prize, they would still get a \nhappy rush from winning a coffee and keep coming back for the fantasy of \nthe big win.

                    "text": "+EmilyExplosion27 wow. i'm clearly outdone here (i thought some of my \ncomments were somewhat long). Now first this is all purely hypothetical and \nobviously not very practical :P. But what i was using a subtle, neutral \nscent (well neutral at first) that the patient will not directly notice \nright away, and will ultimately get used to. These scents would become \nassociated with certain emotions, not necessarily experiences, so scent A \nwould be produces every time the patient received a strong positive \nemotion, it does not have to be very specific. I don't think it would be \npractical (or even possible) to sense the difference between apprehension \nand anxiety. Now when you buy a new car, there is that certain \"smell\" it \nhas that never fully leaves (you can still smell it in your friend's \ncar the first time you go into it) but you ultimately get used to it and \nassociate that smell with that being YOUR car or YOUR house. Even though \nyou don't conscientiously register it all the time.\nYour right, the scent would have to be released after they felt the \nemotion. But the emotion, in this case at least, would be the reaction \n (like Pavlov's dogs salivating). If the bell was rung while they were \neating, eventually they would still associate the bell with food, just like \nyou would eventually associate this scent with that particular emotion.\nNow, if you somehow made your friends car (which, for the sake of argument, \n you have never been in before) smell exactly like yours, would you be more \ncomfortable in it? I would guess so. This would be the same reaction you \nwould get if you released a scent that your patient would normally \nassociate with happiness, and release it while they are next to a, say, \nparking meter  (First thing that came to mind) Because they would associate \nthat scent with happiness subconsciously you could trigger it around \nsomething over and over again (like a parking meter) and they would just \nassociate the feeling of happiness with a parking meter, just like how you \nfeel more comfortable in a car with a normal scent.\nGod i hope i didn't run in circles and actually made sense :P. I'm not \ntotally familiar with all the rules of psychology, i don't know much more \nthan my 9th grade classmates. If I'm completely wrong, which i probably am, \nplease correct me and don't get mad.          ",

For it to be a reliable stimulus, it would have to be able \nto be manipulated. To manipulate happiness, a researcher would have to \npresent a stimulus that can reliably create happiness. But that would make \nhappiness a response and create an infinite loop. Therefore, happiness \ncannot be a stimulus. There lies your first problem.\nBut let's assume that you nonetheless decide to treat happiness (or any \nemotion) as a stimulus. Well, first of all, it isn't very reliable. You \nnever know when the subject will feel this happiness. Secondly, it is only \none of MANY emotions, which all lie on a continuum. You would need \noperational definitions of every one. Where do you make the cut-off? \nApprehension and anxiety are very similar, but they are usually caused by \ndifferent experiences. Would they receive the same scent? \nBut maybe you only care about happiness right now and your subject has no \nother similar emotions (elation, satisfaction, pride, etc.) Well, you are \nsuggesting that we wait for your fancy emotion-monitoring machine (perhaps \na modified fMRI?) to tell you that the subject feels happy. Then you \nrelease the scent. What scent? Fresh-baked cookies it's a very good one to \nchoose because it already causes positive emotions. In fact, \nsensory-emotional memory is VERY strong. You would need to come up with a \nbrand new scent that has never existed before. \nBack to the story. Your subject is happy, you release the scent. Does that \nseem a bit off? It should. This is called \"backward conditioning\", where \nthe CS (scent) comes AFTER the US (happiness). This is not a very effective \nform of classical conditioning. In almost all experiments, the CS comes \nfirst and the US comes second. This is the point of classical conditioning. \nThe CS is learned to be a signal that the US is coming, so the mind takes a \nshortcut and causes the response without waiting for the US to actually \noccur.\nNow say that you actually WERE putting the US after the CS. So you release \nthe scent and then make the subject feel happiness.\nWell, if you can already make the subject feel happiness, then what was the \npoint of this experiment?",
