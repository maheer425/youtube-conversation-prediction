Most are \ntoo afraid or realize they have it because they were conditionated to act \nlike this sick side of male (agressive and mean one) they dont even want to \nthink diferently because that's how they were created, not to think about \nit, just be it and if they had any doubts about his behavior and question \nit they would be gay. That's not true. If you make some researchs women and \nmen mentaly are almost equal and even if they dont, there are no men purely \nwith men qualities nor a women purely with women qualities, every human \nbeing is mixed but we act nowadays much more because of what society teach \nus than for what we are. People who does can be judged but for sure, they \nare much more happier. Anyway. I think this acceptanc of femininity is the \nsolution. Femininity is: love, equality, comprehension, friendship, \nemotions, spirituality, and all much human feelings. You wont be gay or \ninferior doing that. If they knew how pretty and awesome a men that \nembraces his feminine side is, for me those are the truly men and human \nbeings. The rest is just living an ilusion an sad life, the are inferior to \nanimals in there behavior.",

I \nmyself got married at the local court house with our parents and two best \nfriends in attendance.  But in general, this video is poking fun at many of \nthe cliche wedding traditions in America.  Weddings are a multimillion \ndollar industry in this country.  Some people spend literally hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on their weddings.  A large/ expensive wedding tends \nto have several bridesmaids and an even number of groomsmen.  Having a \nweddings party (bridesmaids/ groomsmen) is a way of including those close \nto the couple (best friends, siblings) in the production an American \nwedding can be.\nThe bachelor/ bachelorette party (or stag/ hen party, to use a more \nold-fashioned term) is, I think, a celebration of a single persons last \nparty being single.  It is not always held the night before the wedding, \nbut it is usually within a week or two of the nuptials.  It's considered a \nway to live it up before being anchored to \"the old ball and chain\", in \nother words, before committing oneself to a lifetime of fidelity to one \nindividual.  Men traditionally go to a strip club or have a stripper come \nto them.  There is lots of drinking and whatever else one might be expected \nto give up as a married person.  Bachelorette parties are a newer tradition \nwhich I think stems from the feminist perspective that what's good for the \ngoose is good for the gander.  Women sometimes go to a male strip club or \nhave a male stripper at the party, or they may just have drinking and \ndancing.  The genital cake is usually something found at bachelorette  \nparties.  I think it probably has ties to the whole antiquated notion of a \nbride being a virgin until she is married.  Penis cakes and straws are \nsupposed to be a funny way of introducing a young innocent to \"this is \nwhat's in your future!\".  Of course, very few women are virgins on their \nwedding day in this day and age, so it's also another way of saying, \n\"goodbye to all those penises in your past, now you'll only get to see one \nfor the rest of your life.\"  It's all in good fun and honestly, I don't \nknow that either bachelor or bachelorette parties are as common as \nHollywood would have us believe.\nIf you are really interested in the subject, check out the movies \"The \nHangover\" and \"Bridesmaids\".  Both huge hits in this country.",

These kinds of weddings \ninvolve inviting 100+ people of extended family and friends on both sides \nand their dates. \nThe partying thing can range depending on how reserved the marrying couple \nare but usually drinking is involved, either at home or at bars/clubs, and \nit is usually planned by the best man and best woman. It is a \"last night \nout\" to let loose before marriage. As for the genitalia thing it is a \nsexual humor that is an extreme version of wedding parties. Mostly college \nage individuals do this and people who are very open about sexuality and \nsexual humor. It's not that common.",

I'm under aged and wouldn't do it if I \ncould anyway. Again, it's just adults doing stupid things. I've never heard \nof people going out and partying before the wedding day.\nThere are so many people because in American weddings it's customary to \ninvite family and close friends. So that's family and friends on both the \ngroom's side and the bride's side.\nI hope this helped at least a little. ^^'",

I was never invested in his character, he was \njust another bland white dude that didn't understand feelings. If I wanted \nthat, I could go watch Star Trek with Spock, who is infinitely more \ninteresting. (Though, technically, Spock is supposed to be pale-ish with \ngreen undertones, not pink :P)",

The first season, few people watched the show. They watched it \ncause they liked the theme, or the plot and characters, not because of how \nhot they were. The first episode was scary, but now they aren't as \ninteresting or creepy. I still like the show though. Now that Sam is ripped \nand has long hair, and Dean looks cooler, the weird teenage girls are all \nup on the Winchester bros.",
