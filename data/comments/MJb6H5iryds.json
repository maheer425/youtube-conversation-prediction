If you can \nfind that anywhere, written down or evidenced (not sure if that is a word, \nbut it is now), I will be amazed. Until then, you have no way to prove that \ncreationism does not exist.

Agnostic, in that they \ndon't think that knowledge is known about or can be known about deities.\n\n\"An agnostic is a person who has no position on a particular idea.  An \nagnostic as it pertains to religion is someone with no position on the \nexistence of God.  The agnostic neither supports nor rejects any idea of \nGod's existence.\"\n\nAgnosticism tells you what someone claims to 'KNOW' about deities. That's \nthe 'KNOWLEDGE' part. It does not tell you what they 'BELIEVE' about \ndeities. That's where the 'ATHEISM' and 'THEISM' part comes in. The \n'BELIEF' part.\n\nGnosticism means 'knowledge'. Agnosticism means 'without knowledge'.\n\nAgnosticism goes to what you claim to KNOW about deities. And Atheism and \nTheism go to what you claim to BELIEVE about deities.\n\nAgnostic atheist = Someone who does not 'believe' in Gods, and does 'not \nknow' about Gods.\n\nI hope that's clear?\n\nP.S. I'm not shouting, I'm just trying to be clear about this. :)\n\nThe agnostics beliefs are two fold. Firstly, there is the 'belief' or \n'non-belief' in a deity. The 'pure' agnostic, such as myself, has no \nbelief, one way or the other, about the existence of deities. The atheistic \nagnostic 'disbelieves' in deities. The theistic agnostic 'believes' in \ndeities. That's the 'belief' part dealt with. And secondly, all three agree \nthat no knowledge is known or can be known about deities. That's the \n'knowledge' or agnostic part dealt with.\n\n\"The Atheist, however, rejects claims of God's existence.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the atheist rejects 'belief' in deities, as does the \nagnostic atheist. The difference being that one is open to evidence for \ndeities, whereas the other claims that knowledge of deities is currently \nunknown and is, in fact, unknowable.  \n\n\"Atheists do have a position on the existence of God when they reject \nclaims.\"\n\nYes, they reject the claims, and the evidence presented, by theists as \ninsufficient for belief in a God or Gods.\n\nThere is more to atheism, theism, and agnosticism than you think there is. \nIt's certainly not a black or white issue.

If you watch the movie \nV for Vendetta and read the book 1984 then you can see what the future of \nall western countries will look like. A perfect example of countries that \nare already like this are countries like Cuba and China. They've already \ntaken religion out of the schools and it's affected these younger \ngenerations. These children have no respect. Liberal feminist destroyed the \nfamily by passing laws that encourage divorce. The future of America is \nlooking really bad. America can't keep up with the liberals. We are going \nbankrupt. The liberals are developing a country where people are not \nresponsible for their choices in life. \n\nExamples of this:\n1. Have a baby out of wedlock with a dead beat dad. That's fine the \ngovernment will pay for low income housing.\n\n2. If a women wants to divorce her husband because she's not getting along \nwith him. That's fine the government will approve her divorce without \ntrying to fix the marriage and award her half of the assets, alimony, and \nchild support. Even if she was at fault. \n\n3. If you fuck up in your job and the boss wants to fire you that's ok just \ncall the union. \n\nThose are just some examples of what I'm talking about. America has become \nsoft and trust me this is not going to last forever.\ufeff",

Only point here is - except the time it will take of course- is how \natheism will evolve. Cause it can easily become another religion too. It's \ncompletely another thing to have no masters and lords on you and completely \nanother to create others. But so far so good. It's a stage human kind has \nto take for a healthier; free and better civilization. A planetary. At that \npoint the sky will not be a limit. It will be an infinite journey of \ndiscovery. Only higher!! Only more!! With eyes wide open, as the voyage of \ndiscovery consists only on having new eyes. \n\nCheers very positive post. \n\nPS It matters not that we may not live to see atheist presidents. It \nmatters that we are part of what will make that happen. That's far more \nimportant :-)",
