They're screwed and they know it. This is a \ndesperate move on their part. That's sad!\n\n In anycase if a person wants an Electric car ,,, These franchise laws are \nnot going to stop them and that's the lesson the auto makers and dealers \nare going to have to learn.

But apparently they thought they could and are \nstill trying to.\n In anycase if it's only about making money ,,, then the oil companies have \ngotten stupid again ,,, as there's a tremendous need for high quality \nbatteries for electric cars and so there's much money to be made in the \nbattery business.\n In anycase we've seen the destructive consequences of so many gas guzzle \ncars on the roads. That coupled with the high cost of gas it should be \nobvious the old ways of thinking can't continue to work anymore.\n\nWhen I look at what's going on in the auto industry I'm sometimes reminded \nof a movie from a few years back called 'Other Peoples Money'  Part of the \nmovie is about a company that wouldn't modernize with the technology of the \ntimes. If you've never seen it ,,, it's worth watching at least once. \nEspecially the passionate speeches toward the end of the movie. I can't \nhelp but think that if a companies leaders won't give up thinking that \ndoesn't work anymore ,,, then maybe it is best to let that company die out. \nAlthough it is sad for the employees caught in the middle.",

The dealers also make the manufacturers pay for any \nundercutting and bargaining and extras they throw in.  Tesla avoids this \nand the dealers see themselves as missing out.\n\nOTOH, what Tesla doesn't like is the current status quo of handouts to \ndealers.  The big car manufacturers can give dealers preferential deals for \nselling their cars instead of Teslas, and thus cut Tesla out of the market. \n Having seen dealerships here in Canberra telling people that the \nMitsubishi iMiev and the Nissan Leaf didn't exist or weren't as good as \npetrol cars, Tesla would really be putting themselves at the mercy of the \nentrenched petrol car industry by going through dealers.",
