You simply say what doesn't work, \nwhy, and how we can fix to make the artwork look better. End of story.And \nyeah you are right. You are criticized from day you are born since the day \nyou die. Mary Wang is no different. She is being criticized for being rude \nby all these commenters because of her unnecessary attitude. So she might \nas well take it and embrace for her disrespectful replies. The reason why \nso many people are saying she was rude was because the way how she spoke. \nYeah it's the internet; no one is polite.

When creating rock candy you want to \ncreate a super-saturated sugar solution, without over-heating it. It should \nbe heated JUST long enough to dissolve the sugar. If you cook it too long, \nthe solution gets hotter and enters the temperatures used for making candy, \nlike lollipops - which is what happened to you. Watch the heated sugar \nwater VERY carefully and take it off the stove IMMEDIATELY once the sugar \nhas all dissolved.\n\nI haven't tried this myself, except to make old-fashioned rock candy for \nfun when I was a kid, which takes up to 7 days to form the crystals on a \nstring or wooden skewer suspended in the cooled sugar water.\n\nI'm not sure how the crystals are forming so quickly in this recipe, unless \nit has to do with using fondant as the base, since you need to prepare a \nsugar-coated string or skewer in order to get the crystals to form. Since \nfondant contains a lot of sugar, perhaps that's why it works. But the \nsecond version of the recipe uses only aluminum foil for the base, so I \ndon't know why the crystals would form in only 2 days, rather than 7. If \nyou really want to know, ask a teacher - making rock candy is often done in \nscience classes to demonstrate the properties of crystals. ;-)\n\nWhat I do know is that temperature is critical. You get the lovely crystals \nwhen making traditional rick candy only if you keep the temperature of the \nsolution below BELOW 223 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a candy thermometer to be \naccurate. Also, the slower you cool the sugar solution, the bigger the \ncrystals will be!\n\nPerhaps the owner of this video could post what temperature she heats the \nsugar solution to in order to get the crystals?",
