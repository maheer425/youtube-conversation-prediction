The loser of the war would \nbe reduced to merely rebels, and crushed as soon as possible. The only \nreason why the Taiwanese government still exist and claiming so called \n\"sovereignty\" is because of U.S. involvement. Long years of stalemate (now \npeace) and the influence of the West's opinion created the illusion that \nthe two separated into two entities, but it doesn't change the fact that \nPRC won a CIVIL war and therefore retains the claim to all traditional \nChinese land. If it weren't for the U.S.'s own empire building, there will \nonly be one Chinese government remain by now, thus international \nrecognition would not be an issue. Being the unwelcomed involving third \nparty of the conflict, offical American (and those influenced by America) \nopinions are worse than biased.",

But the Taiwan scenario \ncan be comparable to if the Confederacy won the American Civil War, and \ntook all of the 48 contiguous states plus Alaska, but the United States \ngovernment still having a hold on Hawaii (Despite Hawaii and Alaska not \nbeing part of the United States during the Civil War). Countries around the \nworld would react to it in different ways. Some would recognize the \nConfederate government and all of the 50 states, and some would recognize \nit as a feeble uprising and back the U.S.' claim over all of the 50 states. \nKeep in mind that alot of countries actually do not recognize the PRC in \nits entirety, and back the claim of the Republic of China's sovereignty \nover all of China. This sounds silly to me, because of a nation has proof \nit can assert independence, and even be part of the U.N.'s Security Council \nand the \"Big Five,\" then it is most certainly a nation. Same goes with the \nConfederacy if that scenario truly happened.",

The KMT may not see eye to eye to \nPRC, still consider themselves Chinese and thus named the government \nRepublic of China. I'll give you that there's a difference in time period \nwith the Confederacy, but the \"cause\" is similar - a region with a \ndifferent ideology tries to leave the union by having a different \ngovernment.\n\nAs for Hong Kong, it relies its economy, defense, essential utilities, etc \nall on mainland China. A couple of separatists rioting and the Western \nmedia exaggerating doesn't represent the majority of the population. Which \nis similar to the far right situation in Texas.

Albanian \nand Serbian peoples are different in many ways, one of which is their \nfertility rate. While Serbs (like most of the Europe aswell) has a \nfertility rate that's very low, Albanian couples used to have (now its \ndropped to 5-10) 12-20 children on average (I'm serious about this, not \nexagerating, you can look it up). They have so many people that they \nexhausted all the inhabitable land, and started moving to parts of Serbia, \nMontenegro, FYROM and Greece. The lands where they inhabit, they actually \nassimilate due to the extremely rapid population growth. That's why you \nshouldn't just consider the ethnycity of the land to claim it to a country, \nor a country, but also other circumstances, like this one. Imagine if \npeople of Middle east suddenly decided to inhabit America. They would \nslowly over time assimilate the American people as they reproduce WAAAAY \nfaster. Would you accept the makeshift country they would claim afterwards? \nNo. This example was not here to throw you off, but rather to make stuff \nclear here.",

I don\u00b4t even watch Russian news.I know they are propaganda,not \nas much as Western news but still....\nAnd this is gonna be long,but please,read all of it.....\nAmericas strength and Achilles heel is the dollar,more precisely the petrol \ndollar.Saddam and Qaddafi payed for not accepting it for their oil,But \nBRIKS will be tough to crack,with nations like China,Russia,India.. If the \ndollar dies so does the US.There also lots of internal problems,look at \nFerguson...\nThe Ottomans do justify some things.We Serbs hate them,and with the hate \nfor them comes the hate for Muslims.The Muslims in Bosnia went as far as \ncalling themselves a different ethnic group,which is only gonna piss people \noff and release the nationalistic elements in them.A lot of Serbs call the \nMuslims here Turks,even though they arent.Cause in their eyes the Muslims \nare the same as the Ottomans,and that justifies killing them.Personally,I \ndon\u00b4t hate them and I think all the hate they get in the comments is \nwrong.Personally,I want another Yugoslavia.\nIt was also me trying to explain to you how we Serbs are the most fucked \npeople in history,but we survive.The \nTurks,Austrians,Croatians,Albanians,NATO....and we still survive.\nPeople forget all the things we did.We defended Europe against the Muslim \nTurks when it was needed the most.We gave everything to beat the Austrians \nin WWI.It was mostly our troops that broke the front in Salonika,which beat \nthe Central Powers.After than Hindenburg concluded that it\u00b4s game over for \nthem,and the path to Vienna and Berlin is now open.We lost 28% of our \npopulation in the war.We also lost a lot in WWII.Yugoslavia was hard to \ncontrol for the Germans.Constant partisan attacks forced to Germans to keep \na lot of men here.Those men could of been used somewhere else,like on the \nEastern front.While we Serbs fought them,your beloved Croats and Albanians \naided them.I already told you how.\nYou know I feel about you? Ungrateful.We gave some much and cause of the \nfact that we were on the wrong side in the 90s we are branded \u02ddthe bad \nguys\u02dd and are demonized by Western media.Hell,the electricity that is used \nto powers thing without which we can\u00b4t imagine life today was invented by a \nSerb.\nI feel like Croats are the most ungrateful.The Italians were promised most \nof Dalmatia so they would join the war as an Ally in 1915.On Corfu in \n1917,our PM was given an offer to not create Yugoslavia,and Serbia would \ngain all of Bosnia,Slavonia,Dubrovnik and the north of Albania.It would \npractically be a \u02ddGreater Serbia\u02dd.He rejected it.Had he taken it today \nCroatia would be small as fuck,that\u00b4s counting that the Italians don\u00b4t eat \nthem. How do they return the favor?By commiting genocide over us in WWII \nand declaring independence form Yugoslavia,which was forged with our blood.\nI did mention Croatia and Albania,which are related to the Balkans.But I \nguess you don\u00b4t have an arguement for them.Oh well....\nOne of the topics was ethnic cleansing,I told you that cause NATO calls us \nout for it,but ignores the ones they have commited,which are thousands of \ntimes worse than ours.\nKosovo never was and never will be country.There is no Kosovar people,there \nare only Serbs and Albanians.\nI want you to answer this: How would you feel if your countrys most \nimportant historical land was over populated by your neighbors,who now want \nindependence,they protest like mad,burn you houses and churches,and they \nform a terrorist group to fight you.Than a superpower backs them and bombs \nyou.How would you feel?Would you support it? Cause if you support Kosovo \nyou have to support that.\nAs I\u00b4ve said I don\u00b4t watch Russian news.You are brainwashed cause you \nsupport Kosovo,only people brainwashed by Western media do that.You believe \nNATOs excuse of a \u02ddhumanitarian bombing\u02dd,which was \u02ddsupposed\u02dd to only \ntarget military targets,yet it bombed cities and industrial complexes.Its \ngoal was to bomb Yugoslavia so much so that it couldn\u00b4t recover without \naid.NATOs only goal was to take Kosovo as a base.\nI swear if we turned on Russia and joined NATO they would stop supporting \nKosovo.But we will never betray our brothers....\nIf you came this far thanks for actually reading it all...",

Estimates wary,but around 300-500 thousand \nis a good number.They comited mass ethical cleansing over Serbs,Jews and \nGypsies.They also made forcible conversions,converting Serbs from Orthodoxy \nto Catholicism.Look up \u02ddJasenovac\u02dd,you\u00b4ll get it.....\nAlso,do I need to mention that Albanians drove Serbs out of their homes \nduring WWII,when Kosovo was under Greater Albania.Most of them couldn\u00b4t go \nback to those homes.\nOh,and not to mention Operation Storm in Croatia in the 90s,which drove \nmost Serbs from their century long homes.\nAnd never forget the biggest genocide in history,the one over the Native \nAmericans,and guess who comited it? Western powers,like \nSpain,Britain,America etc...\nI find it funny how they call us out about Srebrnica,saying that 6000 \npeople is a genocide,when they\u00b4ve killed hundreds of thousands in the blink \nof an eye in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.I don\u00b4t see the difference,both were \nwar and both were civilians,except one was 6000,the other 200 000...\nSo yes,I presume that you are from the US.

Is the newly declared \nIslamic State a country? Hardly. It may have a degree of control & \nauthority over a certain geographical area, but they aren't a country. In \nfact, ask them if they think they're a country and they will tell you, \n\"There are no countries, only Islamic State! World is Islamic State & \nIslamic State is World!\"\n\nSo quite obviously your definition isn't very useful. As CPG said, \"What \nmakes a country a country is if other countries think that country is a \ncountry.\" That might sound confusing but by going by that method we can \ndetermine what is and is not a country.\n\nTake Kosovo. According to Serbia, Russia, China and some others Kosovo is a \nrebellious Serbian province but according to USA, the UK, France and much \nof the western world Kosovo is independent. Now despite the fact that it \nshould probably be an Albanian province, Kosovo is in fact a country. 3 out \nof 5 UNSC members (including the most important one) along with 107 UN \nmember states say that Kosovo is a de jure state, thus, despite not being a \nUN Member state, Kosovo is a de jure state.\n\nNorthern Cyprus on the other hand, despite having de facto control over \nit's claimed territory, only one UN member state, Turkey, recognizes it and \nthe UNSC says that it does not exist. Thus, it is a fiction of Turkish \nimagination.",

The reason why the Communist party \ndidn't take over Taiwan is because USA was interfering and back then China \nhad no power to actually take this extra step. Considering the military and \neconomic power China has now, its pretty easy to destroy Taiwan...\n\nRegarding Tibet, Tibet is economically and militarily supported by China. \nIf it is to become independent, I doubt it'll be able to sustain itself \n(much like Ukraine, who depends on EU or Russia, but that's a different \nstory). Besides, that province contains so many extremists that constantly \nterrorize the neutral civilians. Even if it becomes independent there would \nbe constant bickering on who actually becomes the leader, much like the \nAfrican countries. It will just be war over war over war.\n\nLastly, Israel...

In the six day war Israel conquered all of this land (and \nthe Sina\u00ef and the Golan heights). In 2005 the Gaza strip was given to \nPalestine for the promise of peace. Well, after the elections Hamas won and \nthey started to, foolishly enough, shooting rockets at Israel. This got way \nworse after Mursi in Egypt rose to power but it luckily stopped after a \ncoup from the army. And then Hamas started to attack Egypt too so Egypt \nclosed its borders. So, because of the mistakes made by Hamas, their people \ncan go absolutely nowhere. (Might have gone slightly of topic there).",

I'll tone it down. \n\nWell, Israel is actually quite barbaric in a different way than North \nKorea, because it's racial laws brutally oppress over 2 million \nPalestinians under their control  in the West Bank and the militarily \nblockaded Gaza, while Israelis enjoy a high degree of freedom (except for \ncertain restrictions on women regarding ultra Orthodox rules in certain \ncircumstances and areas). \n\nAlso Israel and North Korea are not a buffer, but a terrible burden on the \nUS and China, respectively. North Korea stays in the Stalinist 50s while \nChina is more capitalist with far more prosperity and freedom than in the \nMaoist era. Israel brings hate unto the US from many countries around the \nworld while seriously interfering with the US gov't and election process. \n\nSo, the US and China should cut their client states loose, as these trouble \nmakers need to survive on their own thru forced civilizing, by virtue of no \nlonger being protected from the consequences of their actions. \n\nJust to clarify, I have traveled in China and Israel. Obviously, not North \nKorea! ",

But \nTaiwan has been separated from China politically since 1895. \n\nAs for the short four-year window of 1945-49 after WWII when Taiwan was \noccupied by the ROC army, it was the only exception when Taiwan and China \nwere actually under the same regime, while at the same time ROC was \nbeing challenged in China by the communists, a fight which it ultimately \nlost. \n\nThe military occupation did not constitute legitimate sovereignty transfer \nof the island from Japan to China, nor has that imagined transfer ever \nhappened between the two countries.  As a matter of fact, in all post-WWII \ntreaties Japan signed, it only says that Japan gives up the sovereignty \nof Taiwan permanently, and says nothing about to whom that \nsovereignty shall be transferred.  Therefore, it's mean and right so \nto say from 1945-1990 Taiwan's sovereignty was actually held among the \nTaiwanese people, and the ROC regime never through any due process \nattempted to claim it, until the 90s.\n\nThrough a series of political reformation of democratization and \nlocalization, the ROC government's legitimacy to rule in Taiwan was \nfinally confirmed as the congressional and presidential elections \noccured in the 90s, during which ROC has also lost its so-called \"legitmate \nrepresentation\" of China.\n\nHope all this is made clear.\n\nYes, we still have a constitution that was written in China in 1947, and \nalthough it has been revised several times for the past two decades, it \nstill needs some more definitive terms to better describe and define our \ncountry.  But the fact that we have it, different from China's current PRC \nconstitution, I think, is the most valid proof that Taiwan (ROC) and China \n(PRC) are two different countries.",

The only \ntwo countries that really adamantly supported the union was the Russians \n(who wanted the war to end and a rich union to buy their Alaska before the \nBrits realized it would be fairly easy to invade), and the Moroccans, who \nsimply liked the union and curiously captured confederate, french, and \nBritish forces when they were meeting, and refused to give them back, along \nwith engaging in a surprising amount of espionage against the confederacy.\nAnd secondly, from a technical standpoint, it was 'about states' rights.' \nThat is correct.\nBut think for a second, what 'states' rights' do you really think mattered \nto them the most? The right for states with large amounts of plantation \nowners continue using slaves, no? The right for each state 'itself' to \ndecide whether or not it could continue having slaves (this is a slight \npoint of hypocrisy, because when most western states joined the union, they \nwanted them to be slave states, despite the residence of those states by a \nhuge margin having the opposite opinion), instead of Abraham's decree (or \nrather, more accurately, the 'northern' states, and the abolitionists, \nAbraham only really took the anti-slavery stance once it became hugely \npolitically beneficial.)\nAs some have pointed out, the secession events really started with the \ntariffs, but what do you honestly think the tariffs were about?

And yes, I have seen his video on whether or not Texas could \nsecede from the Union. He references that the Supreme Court ruled that \nstates are not allowed to secede from the Union. This ruling was made after \nthe Republican Party took control of the Supreme Court some time after the \nCivil War. Immediately prior to the Civil War, when South Carolina was \nthreatening secession (for the second time), President Buchanan asked the \nSupreme Court if 1) states were allowed to secede from the Union and 2) he \nwas allowed to use force to keep them in the Union in the case they did \nsecede. The Supreme Court answered that states were allowed to leave the \nUnion and he was not allowed to use force to keep them in the Union. So \nbasically, the Supreme Court ruling that CGP Grey references was made after \nthe fact and was made in complete contrast to a previous Supreme Court \nruling, even though they never overruled it. So, technically, there is one \nSupreme Court ruling saying states can secede and another one that says \nthey cannot secede. So, the way I approach the issue is that there is no \nreference in the Constitution to secession, and the 10th Amendment says \nthat \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people\", so therefore it would be legal, as the \nConstitution does not specifically ban it, so therefore it would be an \nissue which is up to the States and their people. If they wished to leave \nthe Union, they would be allowed to.",

He was no abolitionist. He was, in fact, extremely \nracist. Hell, he even founded the country of Liberia as an attempt to get \nrid of as many of the free black people as possible. The Republican Party \ndidn't give a rat's ass about whether or not the Southerners held slaves, \nthey just wanted to keep it out of the West. And Virginia was given back \nthe land it ceded to form DC in 1846, which is well before they started \neven threatening secession. Now granted one of the reasons they wanted it \nback was so they could have an extra pro-slavery county in the state so \nthat abolitionists wouldn't gain a majority in the Virginia General \nAssembly, but that was only one of many reasons. The biggest reason they \nwanted it back was because the city of Alexandria (which is the main city \nin the area that Virginia ceded to Washington DC) fell into a major \neconomic decline due to neglect from Congress. To find the causes of \nsecession, let's look at the first state to leave the Union,\nSouth Carolina. During the Nullification Crisis (which was over tariffs), \nSouth Carolina threatened to secede from the Union. To explain it very \nbasically, a tariff was passed and all the Southern states were not very \nhappy and South Carolina went so far as to declare the tariff null and void \nwithin their state. The federal government then offered a compromise \nby lowering the tariff. Most of the Southern states accepted this because \nthey didn't want any kind of confrontation, but South Carolina still felt \nit was unacceptable, so they raised their militia to ensure that the \nFederal government could not enforce the tariff in the state and threatened \nto secede. So another compromise was offered, greatly reducing the tariff, \nand South Carolina accepted and backed down from their threat and allowed \nthe tariff to be enforced. One of the main points of Lincoln's campaign was \nto pass an even higher tariff than the ones that caused the Nullification \nCrisis. They had threatened to secede if the tariff was passed, and when \nLincoln was elected, they knew he wouldn't listen to them, so they seceded \nfrom the Union, and they were followed shortly by Mississippi, Florida, \nAlabama, etc. The Southern economy relied heavily on trading with foreign \nnations and the tariffs would have completely crippled their economies.",

Caner Telimenli\nI understand your desire to be precise.\n\nAn empire is just a nation that controls foreign nations is it not ?\n\n*Vikings*\nTo be fair to the Vikings they were traders, explorers, settlers and not \njust barbaric raiders as Hollywood would have us believe. \nThey had high tech seafaring knowledge and they certainly ventured far \nacross the world. Denmark ruled a section of the UK called Danelaw as a \ndirect result of attacking London. (London bridge was not falling down, it \nwas being pulled down by Longships).\nIceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are also Danish.\nMaybe the Vikings did not have an empire because they did not have a centre \nruler as such, other than the gods. I was just throwing it out there \nbecause it was a very influential movement of people. The UK is still full \nof Viking DNA and place names.\n\n(Come to think of it, who were not raping and pillaging in that dark period \nof history ?)\n\n*Economic Systems*\nI consider the modern day economic system to be primitive. Trade is trade \nis it not ?\nAs for money, or one currency, most nations used the same currency of gold \nor silver coins. Maybe that is too early in the monetary system to use for \nor against the topic.\n\n*Empire Definition*\nIf the definition of Empire is to dominate the immediate area then England \ndid not have an empire as they did not command South Ireland. Unless you \nwere referring to their own immediate country of England.\nThen there is the grey area of when did the English empire start. When the \nRomans came or left, after Danelaw, after the Magna Carta, after the fall \nof Scotland etc.\nThat also complicates the topic.\n\nWhat of the Roman Empire and the Vatican Papal States ?\n\nI'm not sure that domination of the immediate area can count for the \ndefinition.\nHas every empire not been contested by its own native \"rebels\" in one form \nor other ?\n\n*Christians*\nI was referring to the entire history of Christianity so yes, Crusades, \nexploitation of wealth, influence all across Europe and the Americas, the \nethnic cleansing under the guise of the Witch Trials etc.\nThey have a central power base, conquered many nations by using fear \npropaganda, military force, infiltration and assimilation of foreign \ncultures, making laws and banking systems across their domain etc.\n\n*Jews*\nJews certainly have a reputation for infiltration, money and law control \nthroughout history so they also have credibility for being jerks on a \nglobal scale. That is why I added them to the list. Not sure what their \npower centre is but it is far reaching.\n\nAs Christianity, Muslim and Judaism come from the same roots I'm not sure \nwe can just label that under Arab. Also Arab is not a country or single \nmovement of people. Like the Celts, or Vikings, they are more tribal \norientated and come from several geographical locations.\n\n\nI'm just exploring the topic, if we learn something then that is a bonus :)",

I \ndont have any information whatsoever about an unified Viking economic \nsystem with one currency. Thats why they are not included. \n\nProblem with Dutch is they had major contestants in their neighborhood, so \nthey lack the power projection. They've never be able to dominate their \nimmediate area. So thats the reason why they are not in the list.\n\nAbout Christian empire, if you are referring to crusader states formed, \nthey weren't around long enough. And The Muslim one was actually Arab. \nAbout Jews, I think they didn't have any state long enough to be a major \npower in immediate area. \n\nAbout the trade issue, I dont really have an objection what you say, but \nthe real problem is the power projection in immediate area of the country \nin question. If you are contested in home, you cannot really claim to be an \nempire in my opinion.\n\nOf course I am only a human, so if there is any evidence disproving what I \nsay above I wouldn't insist on opposite.

Perhaps you've heard of Hamas? If not I'll give you a little info on \nthis group: it's a terrorist organization that's dedicated to the \ndestruction of the state of Israel. Of course you might be one of those \npeople who doesn't think Israel is a legitimate state, and if that's the \ncase nothing I say further will matter to you at all.\n\nIf you're not one of those people then please read on. Hamas is an \norganization whose charter dedicates the group to the destruction of Israel \nand the raising of Allah over every inch of Palestine (Israel, the Gaza \nStrip, the West Bank, and Jerusalem). Look it up, it's in their charter. \n\nSimply glancing at the news or Wikipedia searching the Palestinian/Israeli \nconflict isn't going to give you the whole picture. You'll see footage of \ndead Palestinian children and the startling difference of Israeli and \nPalestinian casualties and initially think: \"Israel is a monster!!\". Trust \nme, I thought the same thing when I first started looking into this issue.\n\nUnfortunately that would be placing the blame where the blame is not due. \nYes, it's true, Israel fires missiles upon towns, and sadly people die. I'm \nnot going to to try sugar-coating it, it's terrible. But that doesn't \nautomatically mean Israel is the villain.\n\nBefore going on I have a question for you: if you were the leader of a \ncountry and you were under attack by missile fire from a terrorist \norganization, what would you do? Negotiation won't work, these people just \nwant to see you dead. So what is there to do? Retaliation, no?\n\nThis is the case we find in Israel. Hamas fires missiles upon Israelis from \nhighly populated areas of Palestine. Why? Because they don't care about the \npeople living in those towns, all they care about is destroying Israel. In \nfact, Hamas purposefully fires missiles from Palestinian towns, schools, \nmosques, etc, because they WANT Israel to retaliate. Why? Because it makes \nIsrael look bad.\n\nCondemning Israel for doing what any other country would do in this \nsituation is not the response. Especially since Israel has been actively \npursuing a two-state solution with Palestine since 1948. Israel does want \npeace. But they're not going to just stand by when missiles are fired upon \nthem from those dedicated to their destruction.",

My point is that almost all wars were Israel has been involved \nhave been started by not only Palestinians, but Arabs in general. The Arab \n- Israeli war from 1948 was started by Arabs who tried to invade the \nrecently founded state of Israel. The Six Days War from 1967 was started by \nall countries surrounding Israel. Yom Kipur war from 1973 was started by \nSyria and Egypt. The Israeli invasion to Lebanon was started by \nPalestinians refugees in Lebanon who launched attacks on Israel. In this \nlast case, I would say Israel went to far by invading Lebanon, action that \nwas completely unnecessary. What I want to say is that if Arabs in general \nknow how much far Israel has gone through all this conflict, why they keep \nattacking? I understand the \"defend their homeland\" and everything, but \ndoes it really worth it? All the losses and suffering really worth all this \nconflict? In my personal opinion, I don't think so.",

The palestinians are paying the price \nfor the holocaust in Europe, that we can all agree. They had to give up \ntheir homeland because of anti-semitism, backed by countries like the UK \nand USA, the Jews made their way into palestine and slowly began pushing \nthe palestinians into a corner. Look up the state of palestine before 1947, \nand look how over the years how the zionists slowly took up about 90% of \nthe land, leaving the palestinians in cramped starved places. Don't forget \nthe atrocities committed by israel, for example in 1982 when they attacked \nGaza and killed nearly 20,000 palestinians, or how over the years they \nattacked palestinian villages and towns, destroying critical pieces of \ninfrastructure like water supplies. Also note how the lands axcquired by \nisrael are ILLEGAL under international law and UN protocols, yet they do \nnothing about this. Now note how it literally appears that Israel routinely \ninvades, yes routinely,  invades the gaza strip, west bank, lebanon \n(illegal under international law) etc etc- dropping white phosporous \n(illegal under international law), as well as threatening Iran and Syria \n(also illegal under international law) - and constantly reminding the world \nthat Israel are under threat and they need saving.\n\nAre you honestly trying to tell me that with no air force, navy, artillery, \ntanks, heavy weapons or modern day technology- that the palestinians are \nthreatening and routinely attacking israel? It's the other way round my \nfriend- And if you look down upon the palestinians for having RESOLVE to \nFIGHT for THEIR HOMELAND,, do you expect them to do nothing as they starve, \nreceiving no help from the international community or their so called \nallies? (Egypt, Iran etc) - Palestine is between a rock and a hard place, \nrather than sit there and accept it, I think it's comendable they are \ntrying to fight back.

It's \nexplained within the Treaty of Montevideo, and these criteria are quite \nhigh quality, for they include Vatican City but leave out Hong Kong. Now, \nthese criteria are the following:\n1. A territory. Basically, a piece of land. Or part of an oil rig. Or the \nlocal McDonalds. Pretty much every piece of walk-able land can be claimed \nas territory, and this is probably the easiest to fulfil. This makes \nimpossible the 9gag Empire due to lack of territory. \n2. A people. The Dutch, the English, Dixies, Yanks, Brazilians, the Muslim \ncommunity... You basically need a number of people to live in your nation. \nThis, of course, stops Sealand from being a country, with her population of \n1. You need some more to actually claim to be a nation.\n3. Real Government Control. This is a very tricky bit, because this is \nwhere many would-be nations fail. They need control over their citizens, \nthe ability to make laws and enforce those laws. This, for instance, begs \nthe question if the central government in Somalia is the government of a \ncountry at all, if their control doesn't reach beyond the doors of the \nparliament. \n4. Ability to engage in foreign affairs. Now, this is the single most \nimportant criterium for this video. Can a nation engage in foreign affairs? \nDoes it have the capabilities to do so? It doesn't matter if other nations \nactually engage in these affairs, does a nation have the capability? This \nmakes the important distinction we need in the video. Let's take Vatican \ncity as an example, as well as Hong Kong.\nDoes VC have a territory? Yeah, VC. It even has a wall around it.\nDoes VC have a people? Yeah, Italians, Swiss, and Catholics. She can make \nthe claim.\nDoes VC have a real government with control? Oh yeah. A king, a pope, \nabsolute royal authority... You bet she has. \nDoes VC have the capability to engage in foreign affairs? Yes, she does, \nand she uses it a lot to go on tour and all. \n\nNow, for HK.\nDoes HK have a territory? Yeah, HK. It even has a sea around it.\nDoes HK have a people? Yeah, Brits, Chinese, the whole shabang. Some even \ncall themselves Kongers. Or is it just me?\nDoes HK have a government? Yes, they even fight about it like in every \ncivilised nation. Check.\nDoes HK have the capability to engage in foreign affairs? No. She doesn't \nhave a foreign ministry, that is left to China. So, according to these \ncriteria, HK is not a country, while VC is. Hurrah for international law!\ufeff",

A country is a country when the people \nwithin it's defined borders say it is. For example, Tibet is it's own \ncountry. It's people say it is its own country. Just because China still \nthinks it own's Tibet because of historical conquests doesn't mean they do. \nThe same goes for any country that is asserting it's independence. \n\nI analogize this to families. When do you become independent from your \nfamily? Either when you chose to, or when that family chose for you. When \nyou leave home and assert your independence you are no longer intrinsically \npart of your former family. You're an individual on your own. This doesn't \nmean your family ceases to be your family, just as a country's origin \ncountry doesn't cease to be that, but you are a separate entity. \n\nIn a similar sense when a US state secedes from a larger state to become \nit's own state it becomes independent of that initial state. It is up to \nthe people (while no longer a viable option for current states). \n\nHow the world around the new country perceives them should be irrelevant. \nUnfortunately because of the UN and it's rules, some countries find it very \ndifficult to attain their world nationhood...this still doesn't dismiss \ntheir independence and claim to be a country. \ufeff",

Similarly, \na government that is representative will act significantly slower because \nof the need to give everyone a voice.\n\nThe PRC system, with the right people in charge, is highly efficient. \nTthat's why it's able to enact new policy so quickly (with no example \nbetter than how rapidly its economy has grown in the last 3.5 decades).\n\nBelieve it or not, the CCP isn't as unified as it presents itself.

China wants the reunification no matter what, \nby peace or force. You are suggesting that Taiwan should not trade with \nmainland because Beijing does not give up on the second way of \nreunification, but you can not tell Taiwanese companies to stop investing \nin mainland and make profits, and those billionaires will definitely not \nabandon their assets and support such policy.\nAllowing Taiwan to be independent is a scenario that will never happen, if \nthe government really does that, it directly threatens the integrity of \nChinese sovereignty and the legitmacy of the communist government.",

I think the \nsame situation also exists in Hong Kong, since some people in HK wants to \nlimit the number of travellers from mainland, and when mainland residents \ngo to Hong Kong or Macau, they use permits that are different from \npassports.\nMy point is, a \"cease-fire agreement\" is really unncessary, the \ncross-strait relation has improved a lot in last few years, and if some bad \nthing really happens, a piece of agreement can hardly prevent a conflict.",

Thus, \nmany Taiwanese sees the KMT's ROC as another invader, and many supports the \nidea that the country is Taiwan not ROC. \nHowever, as a Taiwanese, I prefer to be called Taiwanese while the \ncountry's official name is ROC.

People will ship bombs with \nself-lighting fuses once the targeted enemy is within range but the shipper \nis out of range. Drones will be sent using mobile phones and computers to \nenemies and will kill said enemies. People will threaten each other in \ncomments sections and via posts. Of course, there will still be armies \ntraveling internationally to fight physically, in the flesh, in real time, \nface-to-face, causing lots of physical and economic injuries, but the \nmajority, even if slight, will be via the web.\nThat's just a theory, of course, on what WWIII will be like. And seeing as \nwar is  inevitable, or *almost* inevitable, based on the course of human \nhistory, I thought I'd like to post a comment about it. Also, next year \nit'll be a century since WWI, and it honestly wouldn't surprise me if the \nnext world war started next year, or within a few years of this year.\nThank you for taking the time to read my (unnecessarily long) comment,\nHGF88\ufeff",

By the 21st Century they'd have \ntheir own, superior democratic government to the US, they'd have a stronger \nand prouder culture. - Independence is always better. They'd be in the UN \ntoday, there'd be much less racial conflict as most blacks would have left \nthe nation post-civil war or emigrated after southern emancipation, and \nthose remaining would have much less enmity with their white counterparts \nas blacks would have been integrated into southern society and culture far \nmore slowly and naturally as opposed to the mess that was reconstruction \nand all the racial shit that's caused for everyone, white or black.\n\nAs far as Cotton is concerned, yes we got better quality cotton from India \nbut the reason Cotton was profitable in the south was due to the HUGE \nquantity it was produced in, due to mechanical and industrial evolution - \nbearing in mind that cotton growth in India post war increased \nexponentially - but didn't require and increase in available manpower due \nto the mechanical advances. Also, had we had the Dixie cotton available, we \ncould have kept production in India to food, rather than letting them \nswitch to Cotton in an attempt to get more money - and those hundreds of \nthousands would not have starved to death the way they would.\n\nI also don't think Apartheid would have happened in the south. I think that \nthe black population of Dixieland would have dropped hugely at the \nend/after independence, as hundreds of thousands of slaves see it as their \nlast chance for freedom and run to the Union (who would definitely receive \nthem readily) and the southerners would be in little position to stop them \nas they try to set up a nation. Secondly, after liberation - can you \nimagine the levels of emigration? It would be HUGE, also I think you may \nagree that many of the remaining black would have been colonised to British \nAfrica (as the British did with their own freed British slaves) to help \ndiffuse tension between free blacks and whites post slavery. I see it as \nmuch more plausible that the Civil Rights movement - rather than being a \ncounter to the racist movements born out of the deliberate humiliation of \nthe southern people - would have been a slower, drawn out process from post \nWW1 into the 21st Century. rather than a surge in the 60's/70's.",

Being independent, and - due to the necessities of military \nindependence - allied and in the British sphere, would have allowed The \nConfederate States to industrialise naturally, being able to make lucrative \ncotton-trade-deals with the defeated US - whose industry would still have \ndepended on southern cotton - trading and becoming the cotton exporting \ncapital to the whole of the American Continents AND Europe - making \ninternational legislation to protect that cotton industry - it could have \ngrown exponentially in the remainder of the 19th century and been one of \nthe fully industrialised and (admittedly still modernizing - ill give you \nthat) modern countries by the outbreak of the First World War.\n\n\"Backwards\" is a very broad term - it would be far more conservative than \nthe US due to, well, Democracy. (Side not their superior democratic system \nto the US.) Without the southern states the US would be far more liberal \nalso. But slavery would have been gone from the south by the dawn of the \n20th century as it just wouldn't have been necessary with the booming \neconomy, and the influence of the UK - similar to how the British treated \nEgypt at the time.",
