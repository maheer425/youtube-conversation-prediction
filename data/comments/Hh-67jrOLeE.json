It is more likely that people on \nhere will understand at least a little bit of English than another \nlanguage. Think of this way: If you make a video in English, even if it has \nsome mistakes, the majority will be able to understand you and the point \nyou are trying to make, and may even help you out with any mistakes you \nmake. If you make your videos in another language you are narrowing down \nyour audience to only those who speak said language. It is not rare for \nsomeone to click on a video, notice it's not in English, and click away.\n\n2) After a while you are bound to get better with your English if you are \nconsistent with your videos. (Ex: Look up a couple of PewDiePie's older \nvideos and pay attention to his English--or better yet, the one where he \nwatches his old videos. Then, watch some of the newer ones) It's all about \npractice, and you won't even realize it. Yay!\n\n3) You could use your native language as an advantage. Cracking jokes in a \nlanguage people don't understand is hilarious. They laugh because they have \nno idea what you're saying. Also, many people find other languages \ninteresting.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your channel, now get out there and go \nmake people love you!",

If you could spare a few minutes in your busy lifestyle, I'd \nreally appreciate it even if you just read this.

All the \nvideos I make will have to be made on this until I get some better \nrecording and sound equipment.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking of making some gaming videos like Walking Dead and \nWolf Among Us, but they seem overused and tired out already.\n\nI am a young musician and actor who just wants to get themselves out there \nand be noticed. \n\nSo, all this being said, do you have any extra hints and/or tips that might \nbe able to help me out just a little bit more?\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I haven't wasted \nany of your time.\n\ufeff",

Those people are extremely \nboring (dont talk at all), suck at game, are annoying little kids, or just \ndont get any viewers/subs. We are going to be putting effort into this \nchannel, and if it does well in a few years, we could make it as a \ntemporary job. And you dont need that much talent for a gaming channel \neither. And as i said, dont base this cahnnel as what i am going to be do \non the future channel. I guess i can say your my first hater. ",

Second, if you read my reply to +Andrew \nD., my channel is going to be nothing like what this channel is now. My \ncurrent channel's videos, name and EVERYTHING are going to be nothing like \nwhat you would see in the channel we would make. I couldnt get Fraps to \nwork at the time i made those videos, and i used an actual camera not a \nphone. I will be using real recording stuff instead of a handheld. And \nalso, looking at your channel, you just post videos from other channels on \nyour channel, which are the lowest/saddest level of being a youtuber. So \ndont judge me, cause the channel were going to make will be more like good \nvideos, like Markiplier, VanossGaming, H20 Delirious, etc.",

I think that you could have one main channel that you both are \nalways on together, or have a network of your own channels that you \ncollaborate on.

Any \nprogram would do, and there are plenty. Fraps, Dxtory, ZD Soft Screen \nRecorder, etc.\n-Make a name that doesn't have to be insanely hard to remember, lie yours \nwhich is just a random series of numbers and letters.\n-Personalize your channel! Your icon is just the boring default one, and \nyour banner is one of those you can just choose of of the YouTube menu.\n-You seem like you don't know what kind of channel you want to be. You have \nlike 6 or 7 different games and some random videos of cats or squirrels. \n If you want, get some sort of anchor game people would associate you with, \nsuch as how the main game the Yogscast play would be Minecraft. That \ndoesn't mean you should only play that, as playing only one game would be \nstale so keep it varied.\n-Get a quiet place to record so there's no background noise.\n-Try providing some witty commentary, otherwise your videos are relatively \nboring to watch.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n1. I am a fan of gaming videos, but I have no idea what new videos you are \ngoing to produce so I can't say for sure. There are *billions* of gaming \nchannels out there, so to answer the question- maybe.\n2. Editing software? A lot of the big YouTubers use Sony Vegas but it's \nquite expensive so if you're on a low budget then I'd say just use a \ndefault and easy to use software like Windows Live Movie Maker.\n3. By equipment, I assume you mean a software to record with so I'd advise \none of the softwares I mentioned on the first bullet.",
