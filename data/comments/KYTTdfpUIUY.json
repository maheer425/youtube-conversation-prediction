Based on personal experience where the only time I've \nseen anything other than OEM markings printed on products like Bose are \nfrom the Chinese counterfeits.. 3. Business sense. Meaning if someone pays \n$20,000 dollars for a single plane ticket, I doubt they are really going to \nhave any attachment to a hotel/airline branded pair of headphones (again, I \nmay be wrong), so it would make smarter business sense to pay less for a \nproduct. Again, playing into the joke some that most businesses are corrupt \nand only care about customer service when it affects their profit...... in \nall reality, these may very well be genuine Bose headphones. I just don't \nknow why many people who would spend $20,000, would use hotel/airline \nheadphones. It would be like me staying at a motel and using the mini bars \nof soap, rather than using the much better soap I already have.",
