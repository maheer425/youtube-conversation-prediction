But we cannot have a discussion on the mechanics and workings of \nthoughts and decisions and their biological processes unless we agree, \nfoundationally, on whether or not we wish to support monism or dualism. \nOtherwise, our discussion will always remain at a standstill, as the \nfundamental principles surrounding or terms are necessarily mutually \nexclusive.\n\nBecause you knew the monist explanation from studying biology, then why ask \n\"is this known\"? Clearly, you know what a monist will answer, and you \ndisagree with monism it seems. This also means that you likely know what a \ndualist will answer\u2014the answer which you seem to support.

I'm going to study engineering in a year (officially, I only \nknow basic stuff like Calc and Design rn) but I never quite get a joy out \nof something as philosophy. I studied it since I was 15 and still actively \nresearch it, sure everyone tells me it's useless I get made fun of it by \npeople that play League, but jokes on them the investment surely will pay \noff in the long run. I'm not planning to get a philosophy job but it is \ngoing to strongly differentiate me from all other job seekers. Philosophy \nor Psychology by itself is not recommended by any means though.\nWhat are you studying right now unless you're currently in grade school \nlike I am?",

To get a master's in \npsychology requires 9 years of college, and this is if you never fall \nbehind on work, and the pay is very low. Its only successful if you go for \na high paying job that requires use of it, such as a psychiatrist or (in \nthe case of my uncle, a Ph.D. in psychology and current professor of the \nUniversity of Maryland and owner of a large home in Washington D.C.) a \ncollege professor. Getting a simple major in psychology is very idiotic, \nthe field has no demand and it truly a hassle to even learn, which is why \nhigh schools offer short half year courses on it when it can be studied for \nyears. Yes, it is interesting, but its also extremely difficult and not \nlikely to be worth investing in unless you are very successful at it.",

If you clasify conditions by sympthoms you'll mix things \nthat should not be mixed.\n\nTake the sympthoms for depression, for example, and label it a condition, \nnow:\n\nIt can be a genetically predisposed condition, inhereted, that has nothing \nto do with the person's mind or family dynamics. In this case it would be a \npsychiatric condition, treatable only with antidepressives. Psychotherapy \ncan help, but it won't cure anything, only make it less bad.\n\nIt can be a disfunctional adaptation of the mind to its enviornment. If \nthis is the case it is a psychological condition, antidepressives will do \nmore harm than good, and the person needs psychotherapy to get rid of it.\n\nIt can be part of the patient's family dynamics, in which case no ammount \nof psychotherapy or psychotropics will do a thing, unless the psychotherapy \nis aimed towars chainging the family dynamic (which would no longer be \npsychology, properly speaking, but family therapy through the individual) \nTo fix this family therapy is needed.\n\nIt can also be a chemical imbalance caused by malnutrition, and in this \ncase any of the above would be useless, and the solution would come from a \nnutriologist.\n\nThe sympthoms are the same in each case, but the source of the condition is \nvery different. You have to identify conditions based on what they are, not \nhow they look.\n\nYou are also assuming the patient has a single condition and a single \nproblem, when this rarely the case.\n\nFor example, when a patient has a psychiatric condition, rest assured the \nmind of the patient will try to adapt to it, and very often this adaptation \nwill result disfunctional. Aditionally it is posible that the family \ndynamics that will change to acomodate both those conditions will result \npathological too. This makes 3 conditions, not 1, and if you treat it \nthinking it's just 1, you'll get nowhere.",

That's only a theory, people that support \nit are called biological psychologists. There's cognitive psychology, \npsychodynamic psychology, social psychology, behavioural psychology, \nevolutionary psychology amongst others. Biological psychology is only one \nperspective of many. Twin studies in disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa for \nexample have cultural, age and sexuality differences and lack 100% \nconcordance rates across monozygotic twins therefore other non-biological \ninfluences have influenced peoples psychology.\n\nBiology is useful in explaining emotion, growth, biorhythms and homeostasis \nbut cannot reliably explain lynch mobs, deindividuation, what music I \nlisten to, what religion I believe in, it can't even properly explain \ndisorders such as Anorexia Nervosa and Schizophrenia. Nor can it adequately \nexplain the placebo or nocebo effect.\n\nI'm a big fan of your videos because I'm lazy and I like learning stuff but \nthat statement is theoretical, do not treat it as factual. I'm sure you're \ngoing to discuss other psychological perspectives in the future, the \nStanford prison experiment is pretty big in psychology for example and is \nusually explained with social psychology. Please understand that although \nbiology and psychology are linked, biology always influences psychology at \nleast to some degree, but everything psychological is not yet proven to be \ncaused by biology.\ufeff",

And being able \nto treat something does not mean understanding it.

It is the same as \nopposing philosophical debate, this is the same for all sciences, including \nphysics, computer science, chemistry, biology, sociology, geography, ANY \nSCIENCE!\n\n\"Yes, everything psychological is caused by biology\"\n\nExplain to me exactly how you established that causal relationship? It \nwould make you the most famous psychologist that ever lived!\nBiology certainly influences psychology, but it does not cause everything \nin psychology, even biological psychologists understand this. If psychology \nis cause by biology, then if one identical twin has schizophrenia, \ndepression or other disorders then the other twin must have it because they \nare biologically identical, so must be psychologically identical if \npsychology is cause by biology!!!!? BUT THEY'RE NOT, most of the time when \none twin has schizophrenia, bulimia, anorexia, bi-polar disorder or \ndepression, the other twin does not have it! So other things must come into \nplay! that are not biological/\n\n\"because without your body functioning right, you wouldn't be able to form \nmemories\"\n\nNo one knows how memories are formed dumbass, and that doesn't even prove \nbiological psychology, they're are many people that function properly \nwithout memories due to brain damage!\n\n\"proper or improper behaviors\"\n\nThere's no such thing, that's a social construct and it's part of sociology \nkid.\n\n\"or to find anything you do pleasurable\"\n\nThen why don't we all enjoy coffee is one person enjoys coffee? That's not \nbiologically hardwired into everyones psychology\n\n\"Without some kind of basic biological system, you'd feel nothing and \ntherefore have no incentive to do anything\"\n\nNo, there are plenty of life on earth without brains that do things, this \nis completely unrelated to psychology.\n\n\"You'd be a skeleton with some meat on you, basically.\"\n\nThen how do plants survive? They don't have a brain!\n\n\"Biological Psychology should be the one thing everyone can agree on\"\n\nWell It's not, countless intellectuals with PhDs disagree, because there is \nallot of proof against biological psychology, like what I explained with \ntwin studies and environmental influences.\n\n\"The process of thought isn't some kind of function that takes place in \nsome astral plane not of this world\"\n\nYou mean cognitions? All perspectives believe that cognitions occur in the \nbrain kid, but just because they happen in the brain does not mean the body \ncauses it. We need light from the sun to tell us the sun exists!

Afterwards Tyrosine hydroxylase converts \nTyrosine into Dihydroxyphenylalanine or L-DOPA which then depending on the \ncell is made into dopamine or into norepinephrine another neurotransmitter \nwhich sounds a lot the previously mentioned epinephrine because big shock \nthat's where it comes from, just depends on the cell.\n\nAs too where all these amino acids come from, food, reduction, things like \nthat. It is impossible for our brains to physically create the chemicals \nthey would need to come from somewhere else or at least the resources for \nthem would need to come from somewhere else and then they are constantly \nbuilt and broken down and rebuilt and then cases like epinephrine they \nbreak apart so that they are no longer epinephrine which is a good thing \nbecause if it stayed that way forever then your heart would probably end up \noverworked and, you know, stop. The enzymes which do all the work of \nchanging Phenylalanine to Tyrosine to L-DOPA to dopamine to norepinephrine \nto epinephrine are made in the cells (though some also come from food) and \nwithout them cellular activity would be impossible and it also shows again \nthat what you get depends on the cell because if you want a certain \nchemical compound then you need the right enzyme to help change it.\n\nFinally I am done, I read up A LOT so no TL;DR and anyone who wants to \ncorrect me, please do; I decided to do some research to figure out the \nanswer to this question but my answer may have been false or misleading, \nbut eh best intentions?

Mr. Green is \nright in saying that it's reuptaken into the first neuron, but it may also \nbe kicked out of the cleft completely (diffused), or broken down by enzymes \n(deactivated). Either way, SSRIs block the first neuron's ability to \nreuptake the serotonin, which means that it hangs out in the cleft a lot \nlonger, and is more likely to be used by the receiving neuron, thus \nallowing for more serotonin to be normally used, even when serotonin is \nrelatively sparse.",
