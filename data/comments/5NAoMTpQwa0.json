I am absolutely blown away by the sheer amount of \nsupport this silly little idea I had six months ago has received.\n\nBut I suppose I should lay down the ground rules for Know Your Enemy going \nforward. The main thing to note is that it will never be limited to any one \nfranchise. I know GameXplain is known mainly for Nintendo content, but I \nwant to celebrate all video game franchises whether I know the series well \nor not. The only limitation on which enemy gets the spotlight is that it \nhas to be a normal one so no bosses. This means that I'll never cover the \nlikes of Bowser, Ganon, Eggman, Ansem, etc. on Know Your Enemy. This is a \ncelebration of the little guy :)\n\nAs for how often you can expect these to be posted, I'm going to try my \nbest to get out one episode each month. There is a LOT of research to do \nwhen it comes to KYE plus double checking all of those sources. Fortunately \nwith the pilot out of the way, it should be a lot easier to make future \nepisodes. But as I said, I'm hoping to keep a schedule of one each month.\n\nThanks again for all the support, and I am already starting a list of all \nYOUR suggestions for future installments. Keep them coming! I can't wait to \nget started on the next one!  ~Derrick\ufeff",
