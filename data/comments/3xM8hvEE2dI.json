                "text": "Genuine question: is it a problem for an individual novelist to write a \nnovel where the hero is a rich white dude, or is it a problem for society \nto develop an environment where the predominant stories only feature rich \nwhite dudes?\n\nI'm in favor of a wide diversity of protagonists in literature, but it \nseems unfair to fault Harper Lee on her use of a privileged, white man as \nthe hero, when thematically the novel explores how to resist participating \nin racism while still belonging to a dominant social class.\ufeff",

But \nwith Harper Lee, in her time it was probably a lot more uncommon for white \npeople to boldly speak against racism in the first place let alone there be \nmany books about the hero against racism being a white person. Also, since \nthe author apparently wrote the book based on real events it seems a little \nunfair to be super harsh on her because it's not exactly like she sat there \nintentionally dreaming up this exaggerated story where the white man saves \nthe day just to glamorize white people's role against racism.",

                "text": "Ugh. I liked To Kill A Mockingbird's commentary on racism and social \njustice, but the feminist aspects just irritated me and fell thin and flat. \nI appreciate the fact that the scene with the teacher telling Scout to \n\"un-learn\" can be read as a subtle jab at the fact that many of the \nstereotypes and expectations impressed upon women was done BY other women, \nbut the rest of its social commentary was a bit absurd.\n\nI mean, it STARTS on a good idea of prejudice, but like most contemporary \nbooks on prejudice, it doesn't bother to question WHY the stereotypes are \nthere or what LEAD to these societal expectations and instead spends its \ntime condemning the status quo without making any real progress, again much \nlike Jane Eyre. The result is equivalent to having a next door neighbor in \nan apartment who loudly complains about the noisy plumbing but never does \nanything about it and instead just makes EVERYBODY pissed off.\n\nIn addition, the idea that had the women been on the jury Tom wouldn'tve \nbeen convicted is a false premise- if they HAD been, the jury would've been \nhung until every last member of the jury could be convinced that they \nwouldn't be joining Atticus as the town target for ridicule, or the jury \nwould've been repicked and the verdict would probably come back the same \nway. Tom was an easy target the town had grown up being taught they ought \nto treat like dirt because that's how THEIR ancestors had treated them, and \nto be honest the only way that trial could've ended well is if Atticus \ncould successfully incite the anger of the town against Ewell (perhaps if \nhe could have incited Ewell enough to get him to assault Atticus right in \nfront of the jury resulting in his immediate arrest and complete \ndiscrediting of his claim and that of his daughter), but Atticus caved into \nfear of lynching and instead ended up begging the town to change their \nmindset altogether.\n\nI also find it very disturbing how Harper uses racism and domestic abuse to \ncover up the fact that she's trying to justify having a woman falsely \naccuse a man of rape by softening it with the excuse that \"well she's a \nvictim too.\" She stumbles upon a very real and often unacknowledged truth \nthat when women accuse men of rape, they are almost ALWAYS assumed to be \nguilty until proven innocent and require very little to absolutely no \nevidence to be convicted, which is a severe problem since there is such a \npush from activists to make the evidence required to indict a man for rape \nto being as little as mere testimony by the victim, without any thought of \nthe possibility of a false accusation. Here we have a rare instance of the \none major and most disturbing type of sexism against men, and it's \ncompletely overshadowed and trampled underfoot by anti-patriarchy and \nanti-racism themes. Something just feels wrong there to me. Like the book \ncould've gone further and have even pointed out the flip-side to its own \narguments, but it instead played it safe and deliberately left no grey \nareas.\ufeff",

Shows and movies use this a lot--the audience will \nknow that a killer is in the room or a bomb is about to go off, but the \ncharacters will be clueless until something actually happens.  It's instant \ndrama.  Irony can also be linguistic, where you saying the opposite of what \nyou mean (which is often mistaken for and overlaps with sarcasm, which is \nsaying a mean thing in an ironic way).

It is a long, dull, boring, plot \nconsisting mostly about racial tensions via a court trial so mind numbingly \nmeh that it may as well be a real court trial you are trapped in by demonic \nforces and made to watch despite not caring at all about it's outcome. The \nside story of the girl and her friend finding some albino guy might have \nbeen interesting if it weren't for the court case plotline and the fact \nthat every single character is a cardboard cut out. This includes the main \ncharacter tho preplexingly is a Marry Sue character (Nothing wrong with \nthat really but...) AND a cardboard character of a little girl.\n\nSo what you have is a boring, snore fest of a plot with character you are \nhard pressed to find even the slightest bit of intrest in. To Kill a \nMocking Bird is NOT fun to read. Its a long sludge threw chest deep mud and \ndose nothing at all but drive kids away from reading.\n\nLest you think I just hate court dramas, I don't. I actually love them, my \nfavorite being Inherit the Wind because while it can be a bit boring at \ntimes stuff actually happens in it which breaks up the Drama Fest regularly \nand the issue being discussed is (somehow) still relevant today.\n\nTLDR; To Kill A Mockingbird sucks, schools should teach somthing fun but \nstill good lititure instead. Say The Cleric Quintet, Eragon, or Heir to the \nEmpire. Or hell if all books taught in school need to be really old for \nsome reason, Ender's Game.\ufeff",

Then they will find the great literary classics \nand be like \"Oh hey, books are awesome, this is supposed to be an awesome \nbook, I should read it.\" Then they can read it, and be entertained.\n\nAs for books teaching about a tiem and place... dude we have the internet \nnow, you can just Google that if you care what it was like back then. Most \npeople however do not care what it was like at all.\n\nAlso the Dragon Lance series taught me more about the values of loyalty, \nfriendship, perseverance, honor, and trust, and thought me more about \nracism, politics, and the human condition then any book school made me read \nclaiming that it would teach me about those things. I challenge you to \ncounter that point.",

Those who \nare more mature may be able to find the implicit themes of the novel, \nwhilst younger minds will find the book intriguing as it has clear \nprotagonists, and an evident message of the importance of equality that is \neasy to interpret. I don't believe a book needs to be complex to be \nconsidered a masterpiece, and the fact that Mockingbird is quite an easy \nread is a testament to that. Although I do agree that Atticus was one of \nthe few likable characters in the novel. Scout's intelligence was \nrepeatedly stated, but that is an easy way for the author to make a young \ncharacter likable. I believe she was quite well developed for someone so \nyoung. It was a simple measure to convey Lee's message as such a young, \narticulate girl would easily expose the stupidity and sickening nature of \nsociety at that time. And when I read the book for the first time at 13, I \nquite liked her.

Race matters to a young man\u2019s \nview of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up \nas he passes, no matter the neighborhood where he grew up.

                    "text": "+Alwyn2112 Nah, he just hates it.  Here's from a response to a Tumblr ask \nabout his dislike of Atlas Shrugged: \n\n1. Atlas Shrugged is a novel of ideas. The plot exists only so that Ayn \nRand can lay out her set of philosophical beliefs. So it\u2019s the kind of book \nthat makes you feel smart because you \u201cget it,\u201d but the story itself is \npaper-thin and is carefully constructed to explain and celebrate Rand\u2019s \nobjectivism. I have an inherent problem with novels of ideas, because I \nthink they fail to do most of what is interesting and useful about fiction, \nbut I particularly dislike them when the ideas are bad ideas. \n\n2. The philosophy of objectivism is absolutely repugnant to me (and also \ndoes not hold up to scrutiny). The philosophy of selfishness is all built \naround the idea that the person ingesting the philosophy feels special \n(i.e., that we all identify with John Galt), and of course we do all \nidentify with John Galt, because we all feel that the world is against us \nand we are secretly a unique flower that could bloom brilliantly if only we \ndid not have to carry the weight of other, lesser people.\n\nBut the fact that when we read Atlas Shrugged we all identify with the \nelite is itself evidence of the book\u2019s crappiness, because either A. only \nextraordinary people happen to read Ayn Rand, or B. we all feel \nextraordinary, because we are so busy being our multitudinous and complex \nand extraordinary selves that we do not imagine other people as being as \ncomplex or interesting or extraordinary as we are.\n\nAll of my novels are written in persistent and direct opposition to the \nideas put forth in Atlas Shrugged, and since there is nothing to the novel \nexcept its ideas (the language of the novel imho could not be less \ninteresting), it follows logically that I would strongly dislike the book.",

I mean, \nif we bend the situation slightly and say the novel is about showing sexism \ninstead of racism ( i know that the two don't really compare well but bare \nwith me).

Yes the guy could be talking all about the \nwrongful-ness of inequality between the sexes but does really make it a \nnovel promoting gender equality if the girl does absolutely nothing to \neither defend herself or defend what she did and instead leaves it all to \nthe guy? The problem i see with the white rich man being the central \ncharacter in this novel is that by having him as the main character it \ncompletely takes away the agency of the black characters. In the novel the \nwhite people are off deciding and doing things which moves the plot along, \nwhile the black people take a more passive role, in that they have things \ndone to them and have things decided for them, and this moves the plot \nalong. Don't get me wrong i love Atticus, but if your really going to talk \nabout how racial relations in the south are bad for black people, surely \nthe best way to do so is to give the black character actual agency and have \nthem take an active role in the story instead of simply showing them off as \nthe victim who need some white guy to save them.

He is a subversion of what so many assume would \nbe a subversion of this town of Maycomb, and of what would BE a subversion \nof a racial patriarchy.\n\nIf we take this interpretation that by racial patriarchy, we mean the 21st \nCentury idea that there is a pyramid of control and subversion that a rich \nwhite man would lord over by his privileges, then surely Atticus would be \nour villain and most influential member of this rotten state. But Atticus \nhas no real influence. He stands alone in taking down the rabid dog that \nthe people fear in the book. He stands alone against the town ready to \nthrow Tom to jail to fuel their narrative. Ewell's daughter doesn't come to \nhim as the clearly more powerful patriarch to set justice, but works \nagainst him all through to hold the world as it is. He cannot stop Bob \nEwell's actions, and only the monster of Boo Radley, with nothing to lose \nor gain, steps in and ends it as an outsider. The patriarchy has no rich \nlord to soak, or patriarch manning the control. It is the rabid dog, wild \nand dangerous, no sense of right or wrong, just frenzy. Wild and dangerous, \nborn of a gentle beast.\n\nThe problem that John Green has can only be that he doesn't believe that a \nman of assumed power can be just as unable to reign in a social order, and \nthat there is no final lord of a rotten state. His narrative is that to \nKill a Mockingbird is a system that should show the whiter the richer and \nthe maler as the villain, and the other as the good. That IS racist, and it \nmisses what this system is. He implies to imagine that the system has a \nvillain or hero. The hero must fit an antithesis to this supposed evil, and \ncome out on top. But Atticus is only the hero Maycomb deserves, not the one \nit needs. The innocence lost is that there is no good or evil force in \nMaycomb. Just good and evil men, beyond the ties of a system that either \nMaycomb has, or the mirror image John Green proclaims is good in its place.\n\nIf your only answer to a rich white man not being a good man is that it \nhappens too much and that it is overdone, then you suggest equality of \naction over equality of opportunity, that we can only be free of racial \nstandards if we acknowledge them, place them on pedestals, and factory \nassemble our collective work to balance our media for some end of karmic \nracial forgiveness instead of just moving on. That's no world a writer \nshould live in. A rich white man as a hero is NOT a problem, and to imply \nit is IS racist.",

She sets up a story that questions (or even \noutright refutes) the idea of racial patriarchy, but when the chips are \ndown, she brings in White Daddy to save the day - well, almost save he day. \n In Generic Story #27,827 rich, white dude as the hero isn't a problem; but \nif you are subverting Generic Story, to then plop an unrepentant Generic \nStory trope right smack dab in the middle of it is pretty much giving a \nmiddle finger to everything you just did.\n\nNow, finding a not-white, not-sorta-rich, not-man lawyer in rural, \nDepression-era Alabama may have been just too far of a stretch for \nsuspension of disbelief, but Atticus is still problematic in relation to \nthe rest of the story.",

Thank you for the analysis - since TKAMB is one of my \nfavourites it was delightful to hear/see your juxtaposing of the \ncharacters/time/social consequences/guilt of the story.  I really \nappreciated how your examination went through gradually deepening \nconsequences based on a supposedly innocent story of a girl growing up \n'southern'.   Thank you. ",
