Well, considering how far away she is \nand how she was blasting music through half of his confession, she \n\"rejects\" him purely 'cause she can't hear him. His future self appears \nafter she leaves and JB thinks he's hallucinating because he clearly is \nlol, so he ends up falling off the roof into a parallel universe. There he \nfinds out that the girl is super friendly with him and initiates a lot of \nskinship which confuses him since he just witnessed her rejecting him in \nthe present world. At the end of the MV when he follows her up to the same \nroof and he warps back into present world, he realizes that he shouldn't \nconfess to her yet since she'll reject him. \nHope that helps! I may have over explained >.< Also, turn on the subs and \nthe story will have a better context. =) Ohh, and thanks for the interest \nin GOT7 via Jackson! You're pretty much sucked in at this point, it will \nonly get worse. Good luck, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",

I know that the \nother groups also worked hard, but GOT7 started from scratch since their \ndebut. No reality show to back them up before their debut.\n\nI maybe off point for some others point of view, but I'm a fan here, and \nrealizing how a lot of GOT7 fans around the world are all trying hard to \nsupport them, and I just can't seem to take that it will all just be going \nto waste.\n\nI still believe that GOT7 will prove them wrong, when the time comes.

                "text": "Seriously, I'm sad that ignorant people just use the word 'flop' for every \nboygroup they hate or don't like. I mean, excuuuse me, (diva tone lol) GOT7 \ngot over 12 million views just for their debut mv less in less than a year, \ntheir second MV got over 15 mil views in less than a year too and stop stop \nit mv got 1 mil views in a day which puts them at the same level with a few \nsenior groups. And now they have over 7 mil views. (GOT7 lol, I just had to \nadd that). Reminder: GOT7 also debuted in that same year their MVs got out. \nEven their dance practices has million views and those are like more views \nthan some MVs other newbie groups have. Don't forget they're also a rookie, \nladies & gentlemen. Some of their live performances even got 1 mil views. \nNot enough? Forget about views then.\n\nContinuing on with awards. Every year we have loads of rookies and guess \nwho got the rookie awards this year? GOT7. They got those awards along with \nWinner & RedVelvet. All representatives of the BIG3 companies. Yes, they \nmight not have won any music shows yet but even RV from the biggest company \ndidnt win yet. That doesn't make GOT7 a 'flop'. \n\nFor those haters out there, you kept comparing GOT7 with Winner(who was \nalready known before debut with their show) and EXO (who debuted few years \nbefore GOT7). I actually say that proves GOT7 isn't a flop cause think \nabout it, would you compare someone who you consider a 'nobody' to people \nwho are already popular? If GOT7 was really a 'flop', then why would you \neven bother bashing them and saying they are one? Cause if they are a \n'flop', you wouldn't have to waste your energy trying to argue with \neveryone about it. Why, you say? Cause you wouldn't even heard of GOT7 and \nthere wouldnt be so much people defending them.\n\nIf they are a real flop, you would care less and wouldn't even know their \nname. You would be saying 'Who are they?' instead of actually arguing with \ntheir fans (yes, FANS. 'Flop' would mean they have none and you wouldnt be \ntrying to defend your statement right now).\n\nVisit Wiki and you would know GOT7 topped the charts with their albums even \nin Thailand & Japan. Their album even shot up to the number 1 spot on \nBillboard's World Albums chart and was number 2 on Gaon Album Chart.\n\nSeriously, I didn't know 'flop' means being number 1 on charts. (In case \nyou haters are still stupid, I was being sarcastic.)\n\nFlop - Unsuccessful, fail totally. (Just making sure you haters were aware \nof its definition)\n\nWanna know if GOT7 is still a 'flop'? Visit the wikis for other rookie \ngroups that debuted on the same year as them(if wiki has them) and compare \ntheir awards and nominations(if those groups have any). I dont want to \nmention names cause I might offend the fans of those groups but honestly, \nother groups can be considered a 'flop' if they were compared to GOT7. I \neven know a couple senior groups that would be the same.(Not gonna mention \nnames).\n\nWell, I will end my essay here. lol. See ya haters. If you want to try \nbashing me or prove me wrong, then go on ahead. I wouldn't care less cause \neverything I said was pure facts and information I got online and from my \nexperience of being GOT7's fan. ^^ If I was rude, I apologize then. I was \njust trying to lay my opinion out there. \ufeff",

They performed here in our country with SISTAR and BERNARD PARK but *the \nevent was dominated by GOT7 fans.* I was on the VVIP seat but I can barely \nhear them sing because fans keep screaming and cheering for them. The \nguards keep pushing the railings because fans went berserk during their \nperformance and the hosts even told the fans to stay calm for us to enjoy \nthe show. Some fans wore shirts with GOT7's logo. *GOT7 is very different* \ncompared other groups (they really stand out) that's why I love them. They \nare only rookies but they already have huge fan bases overseas ! Although \nthey have lower album sales compared to other groups, the number of sales \nis way higher than other groups to be considered flop and if they were \nflop, i'm sure they will be disbanded right away. *You HATERS better watch \nGOT7 grow and eat your words.* I'm sure that you will be absorbed in this \nfandom very soon. Please continue to keep an eye on them. Continue watching \ntheir MVs and their shows to gain viewers. Keep listening to their music \nuntil you will have a \"last song syndrome\" Spread the word to people that \nGOT7 exist not just an ordinary KPOP group but a *SPECTACULAR ROOKIE that \nshaken up your bias list !* *GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* GOT7 \n*GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* GOT7 *GOT7* keep reading this word until \nthis word get stuck to your mind. *I am an AHGASE* (IGOT7) and I'm proud of \nit ! Nobody is perfect (even your idols are not perfect) and even though \nthey have flaws or whatever hateful comments that you can think of whether \nits true or not *I STILL LOVE GOT7. I LOVE ALL OF THEM. I LOVE THEIR GOOD \nAND BAD SIDE because they are GOT7*. That's it. *G O T 7 slay !* I LOVE \nMARK, JAEBEOM, JACKSON, JINYOUNG, YOUNGJAE, BAMBAM and YUGYEOM why? because \nthey are GOT7 !!! so simple yet meaningful - THEY ARE GOT7 ! *COME and GET \nit GOT7 !!!!!!!!!!!!!*\ufeff",

They are currently doing an \nAsia showcase, they already went to Taipei and Shanghai, next is Hong Kong. \nI am not sure if they'll add more stops, it hasn't been announced yet. They \nalso participate in the JYP Nation tour since last year. They of course did \ntheir Japanese tour/promotions, they went to Philippines for KCON. They \nattended most of the year end events, if you haven't seen their \nperformances for those you should definitely watch them! Their remixes and \ndance breaks are awesome! They're filming for Idol Athletics next week, \nthere's also rumors of them coming back to the Philippines twice in first \nhalf of 2015, and Bangkok and Vietnam. They'll be in Japan for some more \nstuff in June too. Right now there's no plans for a comeback, but we're \nspeculating that they'll have at least 2 this year. And they'll prolly do a \ncomeback for Japan too. Quite a lot of Koreans count in English rather than \nKorean. Mark and Jackson are fluent in English, BamBam knows English pretty \nwell - he learned it from Markson, the others have basic understanding of \nEnglish. I would say that Youngjae knows English a bit 'cause he was \nstudying it, but we dare say that Yugyeom may be better than him now with \nhis recent trip to America with Mark lol. Generally, you can count on \nanyone in JYP to have pretty good English skills. The variety show is \ncalled IGOT7, that one actually aired on tv in Korea. Real GOT7 was/is just \nan online thing for fans, JYP does them for 15& and 2PM as well. People \ndon't put fake info in the wiki page, rather they just remove info is all. \nSo what used to be pretty informative is now really bare. They used to have \nmost of their show appearances on there, but now they only note Dream \nKnight - their mini web drama that just started Tuesday. Used to have like \nall their ages/birthdays too, now it's just names. I'm not really sure why \npeople do that honestly, in December when a lot of the year end stuff was \nhappening, their page literally got edited multiple times a day - I \nguesssss you can say it's kinda a good thing? Means there was a lot of \ninterest in them.. But still annoying. It's slowed down a lot now, less \nfrequent editing but still very bare.  ",

GOT7 kinda hasn't done many shows and such as a group \nlately, plus Youngjae is pretty quiet. Jackson is everywhereee lol. I don't \nthink Youngjae has his own pet name that I know of. Mark is Taiwanese \nAmerican because he was born and raised in America, but his ethnicity is \nTaiwanese =) GOT7 actually had their own show last year too called IGOT7, \nyou can find it subbed on kshowonline. Also, they've been on After School \nClub 3x, mainly English speaking show. Markson did little After School \ntalks for them like 3? times too I think. Those are kinda what I can think \nof off the top of my head right now, there's a lot more though. Their wiki \npage used to have all their show appearances and such, but people \nconstantly mess with those pages so it's not showing right now. =/ Ohh! \nTheir Weekly Idol appearances are good too. Pretty much everything they \nappear in even if not as a whole is great LOL.\nPS: You're sucked in sooo bad right now LOL. IT ONLY GETS WORSE",

Can you briefly tell me about \ntheir personalities? For example Jin is known to be awkward or Taehyung is \nknown to be weird. I really like Young Jae's voice and I might make him my \nbias cuz to me he looks the most handsome (i love his eyes \u2665), but I've \nbeen reading comments about how he's kinda quiet? Btw I was talking about \ntheir fan meeting in Malaysia, they're coming on 21st of March :)",

They should have stunning songs \nsimilar to EXO's style or maybe BTS, their songs are all the same. I like \nsongs with stories behind them like Roy Kim or WAX. Got7's songs are about \nthe same thing, having a girl to love or whatever you please to call it. I \nreally like their new album tho! ^^  \n*UPDATE*\nYou have to really listen to the song a couple of time to become addicted.. \nwhen i first saw it i wasn't wooed at all. I just would really like for \nthem to have a powerful comeback.... again like BTS with powerful songs. \nGot7 really has a  lot of talent but this sounds a lot like \"A\" now that i \nthink of it. but... yeah.. they're still #1 in my heart.\ufeff",

Seriously, I did try but every time I see him during his \nsolo shots, flashes of Rainbow's Seungah's face keep resurfacing. I still \nremember how much of a dickwad (sorry for the word) and how ungentlemanly \nhe was towards the lady. They were on this show called \"The Romantic and \nIdol\" and god was he such an asshole (sorry again) back then for treating a \ngirl like that. And now every time I see him, I just keep thinking about \nhow he may be in front of girls and the girls he's going to meet in the \nfuture. Will he treat them the same way he treated her? Or will he be any \ndifferent? I can't stop worrying. That's how much he left an impression on \nme and man is it bad. If you guys could just help me patch up his ruined \nimage in the way I see him now and the way I remember him, I'd be so \ngrateful.\n\nP.S.Before you start commenting, you might as well watch the show first. \nFeel free to share your opinions.

If you want to enjoy \nGOT7 in peace, give the guy a chance.

I'm very good at reading people and I watched all \nthose shows and tbh he ended up being my bias. Not only because of his \nlooks, but you could see how much he cares about the group and the members, \nand isn't super strict and rude as a leader, but rather knows when to have \nfun and when to be serious.\nAfter you give him a chance, then reevaluate your feelings.

As we grow up, we become sensitive and learn a lot from \nour mistakes. We understood that this world needs love and gentlemen. Since \nGOT7 debut, I never see problems with JB's attitude. I know he was \nhot-tempered and easily to be irritated, as I have heard a lot of negative \nhumors about him, but I think he is a grown-up now who knows how to be a \nhuman using all his experiences and lessons in life. He even does fan \nservice now. At first he was awkward and asked the rest of GOT7 members why \nthey do aegyo, that couple thing, and fan service. After their promotion \nwith A, he started to meke fans happy with his actions. During a recent \ninterview, the emcee commented if JB is really flirting now with fans, and \nthe other GOT7 members agreed to the emcee. JB is a human now. He became \nmatured, and happy now.

Imagine if \nwinner or anyone from big companies came out of a different company. They \nwould not get the same public attention. That is all I'm saying I never \nquestions their abilities.

If u don't like it then u can go to ur yge \nvideos or something. And this exact same thing applies to got7. Except hype \nfandom is so much smaller. They wouldn't have got so much attention in \ntheir debut if it wasn't for jype. That is why the company u debut from is \nso important in korea. ",
