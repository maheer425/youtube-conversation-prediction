I would state \nthat Flemish people don't know how to properly do that (generally, not all \nof them of course). I lived 25 years around Brussel & Leuven, moved to \nVielsalm, the Ardennes. 24 km from the German border, 17 km from the \nLuxembourg border. If I have to go to Brussels, it's ok to drive ... untill \nyou pass the Flemish Brabant border ... then nobody respects the right lane \ndriving rule anymore, most of them just stick to the middle, and between \nTienen & Brussels it's the worst. This associal behavior is something you \ndon't see that much (almost not) on the highways of the French part of \nBelgium, more specifically, the Ardennes. I've driven +25K km in Germany & \nLuxembourg last year, 15K in the Ardennes & 10K in the Flemish part of \nBelgium, 4K in France, 3K in Spain. Luxembourg has even better drivers then \nGermany. Flemish come last, Ardennes & Germans are pretty close ... \nSpain & France, on the countryroads had most respect for motorcycles (they \nlet you through without you asking). ",

I have seen a few of his vids and in all \nof them he just seems to have this arrogant air about him. just the way he \nspeaks is very \"better than you\" and he generally has a piss poor attitude \nbecause he sets his standards so high. they should really replace him. I \nmean look at Larry, Mike, Matt, and Chris. These guys all get excited about \nthe cars and find things to like about cars they don't like. This guy just \nblahs and bitches about everything. The autobahn has construction. boo \nfuckin hoo. You just legally went double the highest posted limit in the US \nand triple the average posted speed limit. Seriously.\ufeff",
