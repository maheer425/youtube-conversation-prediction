                "text": "This is a true story that happened to me back in 2012...\n\nI got into bed where all was fine until about midnight. I woke up to \nsomeone knocking on the front door. I went to look through the peephole but \nthere was no-one there. The same knocking was heard on the window in my \nbrothers bedroom. I ran to check on him, afraid of an intruder but no-one \nwas there and there was no sign of intrusion. My brother was fine, so I \nwent back to my room, when I heard rattling on my window. I locked the \nwindow and ignored it. I fell back asleep but at about 4am, I woke up to \nsmell perfume. I knew it wasn't my parents perfume. It smelt like my \ngrandmother's perfume. The only thing was... my grandmother died in 2007....\n\nWe have since moved houses\ufeff",

He grabbed a lighter and ran upstairs to \nwhere the wedding dress was and said, \"listen you son of a bitch, I will \nnot hesitate to burn this piece of Shit if you do not stop.

                "text": "One time, I went on a vacation with my family. We just arrived at our hotel \nand checked in as you should do, then we took the elevator 2 floors up. I \nhad been carrying the heaviest suitcases so I was behind everyone. As our \nelevator opened, we walked through the hall and I heard a strange voice in \na room not so far from ours. While my family kept on walking, I was curious \nto what it was I heard, so I stopped in front of the door. The sound was \nreminding me of a screaming girl. I decided to look into the keyhole before \nmy family had gone to far. I put my suitcases down for a brief moment and \ncrouched in height of the keyhole, and looked through it. To my surprise, \nall I saw was red, and the feeling was weird and as someone was watching \nme. Anyhow, I didn't think much about it and rejoined my family and we \nspent our days living in the hotel.\n\nI did not think much about this until the day we were leaving. Once again I \nwas the last one because of my suitcases. As we entered the elevator to get \ndown and check out, I remembered the weird room I just passed by but I \ncouldn't check the keyhole again because it was too late. As we approached \nto check out, I asked the woman working:\n''Do you know who is living in Room 126?'', this is the room I heard the \nweird voice from.\nShe gave me a straight-forward answer:\n''There is currently no one living there. No one is allowed to spend their \nnights there, because a girl died mysteriously in that room.''\nI did not want to say I heard a screaming girl, because I was scared at \nthis point, but I was still curious:\n''I inspected the room by looking at the keyhole and only noticed something \nred, why is that?''.\nThe woman looked at me, stunned, and after she told me the answer I \nimmediately dropped my suitcases and ran out of the hotel out of fright:\n''The girl that died had red eyes'', she said.\ufeff",

                "text": "I have a few... Well start with the one that actually happened to me, the \nnext ones are ones family and family friends have told me.\n\nThe other night whilst I was watching YouTube videos on my phone, Siri \npopped up without me touching my phone. A few seconds later, words starting \nsplaying on the users side. I was so freaked out I didn't give it time to \nfinish I closed Siri immediately, only noticing two words \"suck my\"\n\nThese next two are ones I hear every year at Easter (long tradition of \ngoing bunyip hunting and hearing scary stories) I'm telling them from first \nperson but yeah.\n\n1. When I was younger I had a teacher who I was very close with. One day \nshe came to school very tired. I asked her what was wrong and she said \n\"there's been creepy things going on in my house. So that night my friend \nand I went to spend the night. And she took us into the kitchen and sat us \ndown at the table. At exactly 12am the back door opened all on its own, \nmuddy foot prints walked to the sink, stopped, went back and the door \nclosed. We were both really creeped out by now so we decided to stay \nanother night to see if it happened again. But this time we locked the \ndoor. It happened again, once the door had closed I went to check it... It \nwas locked. A few years later the teacher was renovating the house and she \nhad a wall knocked down to find a room she didn't know about. And inside \nthe room was the skeleton of a man. It turns out the man's wife had killed \nhim and hid him in the room. And the creepy occurrence was his soul \nreplaying what he did every day, going out to water the garden coming in \nand having a drink then going back out. \n\n2. A few years ago, when my friend had just gotten married they had moved \ninto an old house. A few months after the wedding the wife went away to \nvisit her sister and my friend invited me to stay the night. So I came over \nand we slept in the same bed (it was cold and winter) and at 2am the bed \nstarted moving, not because of us, but on its own! We were definitely \nfreaked out! So the next night we stayed up and watched the bed. It started \ndragging itself! We later found out that a youngish woman had died in that \nhouse! But we never got an explanation for the bed. \n\nThis final story is one my cousin told me about her grandmother on the \nother side of her family. I'll be telling it in the way my cousin did. \n\nWhen my grandma was young, she lived in a house with her parents and \nsiblings. But every now and then she would stay with her grandparents in an \nold house from the earlier days of Australia. Now every night she slept \nwith the door closed. And on the back of the door was a full length mirror. \nHowever one night my grandma forgot to close the door, and woke up in the \nmiddle of the night to see a ghostly figure of what looked like a male \nconvict at the end of the hall. As if sensing her, the ghost turned around \nand started heading for my grandma's room. My grandma, scared out of her \nwits, quickly got up and closed the door. She didn't see the ghost again \nthat night. However when she asked her grandmother about it, the \ngrandmother said \"it's an old house, but that's why there are mirrors on \nthe doors, the ghosts can't get through them if they're not on the \nreflective side.\" And my grandma never slept with the door open ever again.\n\n\nI'm not sure if the three that weren't my experience are true but I can \ntell you the first one is 1000000000% true.\ufeff",

I asked\n\"Santa, is that you?\"\nHe replied in a very annoyed voice\n\"Go back to sleep you fucking faggot.\" \nSo I went back to sleep, only to wake up to seeing Spiderman and Shrek \nhaving a fist fight in my room and then, Shrek punched Spiderman in the \ngenital area and then ripped spidermans pants down, and having a few \nspiders crawl out of spidermans butt, Shrek said \"It's all ogre now\" then \nhe stuck some green thing in Spidermans but and Spiderman screamed. That is \nwhen Deadpool came from my closet and started punching Shrek in the face. \nIt was so fucking cool that I filmed the entire thing. \n\nShrek was dead and spiderman was bleedng from his butt, deadpool broke my \nwindow and flew out on a giant dildo yelling \"FUCK YEAH!\" Then, I went \ndownstairs to see this kid I know named Kyle, tearing my presents.\n\nSo I pulled a rocket launcher out of fucking nowhere and shot him in the \nface and he died.\n\nThen my mom came down yelling yay and we all had presents and cake.\n\n\nThis is a completely true story, I swear.\ufeff",

                "text": "When I was a child of four or five, I guess I had an overactive imagination \nlike most children did at that age. Anyhow, I had most of the normal fears. \nI had to have my closet closed at night so that I wouldn't see the dark \nshapes of my clothing in the darkness, and I always jumped into bed so that \nnothing could grab me from underneath while the lights were out. However, I \nhad one fear that wasn't quite as standard for a child. I had a very \ndistinct fear of a man that would stand outside my door at night and wait \nfor me to go to sleep. When I closed my eyes, I could see him. A dark \nsilhouette of man just standing, still and waiting. It terrified me because \nI didn't know what he wanted to do. Because of my fears I started to lose a \nlot of sleep. I would be up half the night afraid of the man outside my \ndoor. I would sleep in very late, be exhausted during the day, and always \nbeg my parents to let me stay up later because I was afraid of going to \nbed. Eventually it got to the point where I knew that I needed to do \nsomething about it. My other fears were easily enough solved. I was already \nclosing the closet door and turning out the light next to my bed last so I \ndidn't have to worry, but the man was different. The monsters under my bed \nand in the closet were the typical kind of imaginary nighttime monsters \nthat wanted to jump out and grab you, so merely avoiding them through my \nregular methods was enough to put me at ease. The man was different though. \nHe didn't want me to see him. He wanted me to go to sleep without noticing \nhim, and that's what made him so terrifying to me.\n\n I told my parents about the man, and they told me that he wasn't real and \nthat I should stop worrying about him, but I couldn't. I kept losing sleep \nand I kept seeing the man when I closed my eyes. One night though, I came \nup with a solution. I left the door open before getting into bed. That may \nseem strange, but I thought it out for a long time before doing it. If I \nleft the door open, then I would be able to see out into the hallway to \nmake sure that the man wasn't there long enough to get to sleep. It would \nleave me vulnerable once I was asleep, but my parents had told me I was \njust imagining him, so it wouldn't do me any harm once I was asleep. On top \nof that, even if he was real, a closed door with no lock wasn't going to do \nmuch to stop him from getting to me. With all this in mind, I left the door \nopen at night and it worked. I didn't see the man outside my door when I \nclosed my eyes anymore, and I stared into the darkness until I fell to \nsleep. A couple of times I thought I saw some movement or shifting in the \nshadows, but as soon as I blinked it was gone, and I chalked it up to the \nsame imagination that had dreamed up the man in the first place.\n\nOver time, I forgot all of my fears, but my nighttime routine for dealing \nwith them remained the same out of habit. I would always leave my door open \nat night, and I told my parents not to close it because it bothered me. A \ncouple of years later, my sister said she saw the back of a dark figure \nlooming through hallway when she got up to go to the bathroom. Looking back \non it, I realize that the bathroom is between my room and hers, but at the \ntime I paid her childish ramblings no heed with the man that stood outside \nmy door almost entirely forgotten. A year or two after that, my dad said he \nsaw a tall dark figure dart into the toy room in the basement. He followed \nit and flicked on the lights to find that nobody was there. The toy room \nhas no windows, and only the one door, so there was nowhere for it to go, \nbut whoever it was had seemingly vanished into thin air. The story \ninterested me, since my dad was never one to tell even the smallest of \nlies, but again I made no connection between it and the man who stood \noutside my door so many years ago.\n\nOne day, I was heading off to school when I saw a pale white face watching \nme from the door of my house out of the corner of my eye. I looked back at \nit to see nothing. Dismissing it immediately, I went off to school without \nincident. When I came back home, I started to see the face watching me \nagain. Every once in a while I would spy it, but it would disappear \nimmediately. I thought that it was just my brain playing tricks on me, \nsince the image was already in my head. I payed so little mind to the \nhallucinations that I didn't even tell a single person about them. The only \nreal oddity was that I would only see the faces in my house... That was \nuntil I had one of my friends over. We were sitting in the basement in what \nused to be the toy room. I was looking something up on the computer that \nwas now positioned in the room, opposite to the closet. The closet was open \njust a foot or two, and my friend was spinning around on a chair next to \nme, waving his feet absently. This meant that he had a quick glimpse into \nthe closet every couple of seconds. After a short while, he jumped off of \nthe chair with a screech, and whirled to face the closet. I asked him what \nwas wrong and he pointed to the closet, swearing to me that he saw a pale \nwhite face smiling at him from the closet. At fist I was ready to laugh it \noff as him either playing a prank on me or getting wrapped up in my \nhallucinations, but then I remembered that I hadn't told him about them \nyet, nor anyone else for that matter. It was illogical. There was no way he \ncould have hallucinated the same thing as me without at least hearing a \ndescription of the hallucination first. For the first time in years, I was \nterrified. He went home and I went to bed that night, still trying to make \nsense of the ordeal. Before going to bed, I made a decision that seemed \nminor at the time. I decided, for the first time since I was a toddler, to \nsleep with my door closed. I don't know what it was, but I thought that \nmaybe it would offer me a little bit of protection if there really was \nsomething in my house. After a while, I started to doze off. It was then \nthat I heard a loud thump on my door, followed moments later by some \nscratching noises. I flicked on the light next to my bed, thoroughly \nspooked, when I remembered that my family had a dog that would scratch on \ndoors when she wanted to be let in to a room. I sighed in relief and was \ndeciding whether or not to bother getting up and letting her in when I \nheard another noise. There was a soft click of a door handle being grasped \nfirmly, followed by a loud violent rattling. The door handle turned back \nand forth sporadically, jerking and twisting violently for several seconds \nbefore suddenly stopping and leaving me in deadly silence. I sleep with my \ndoor closed now.\ufeff",

I believe that they're only powerful against \nus as long as we feared them. Until now, I occasionally encountered these \nmysterious incidents and I just ignored them. Honestly, they can't actually \nharm us if we just stop fearing them so much and man-up.",

Her \nhair was black, and she always wore this hospital gown with small blue dots \nall over it. She stared at me with a surprised look on her face. But, the \nodd thing was that she didn't have any eyes. Her eye sockets were \ncompletely black, like staring into an empty void. When we moved to \nFlorida, I've never seen the little girl ever since. I haven't told anyone \nabout these events ever since.\n\nI SWEAR TO MY LIFE that this happened!

                "text": "I have a creepy story. Once, I went to stay at a friend's place up in \nNewcastle, a bit north of Sydney in NSW, Australia. One night I was there, \nI awoke at about 2:30 in the morning to soft sounds of sobbing coming from \nwithin the room. Once my eyes were opened enough to see about the room, I \nsaw what appeared to be a young girl standing at the end of my bed in a \nwhite dress. Still in my half-asleep state, I ask \"Are you okay?\" \nImmediately after that, all sound seemed to vanish from the room. Not just \nher sobbing stopped, but the sound of wind and other ambient noise just \nended. Then I started to find it hard to breathe. Her head, which has been \nbowed the entire time, slowly lifts up to look at me. There were black pits \nwith tiny white specks where her eyes should have been. Her mouth stretches \nunnaturally wide, and she screams, moments before simply vanishing. The \nscream was so loud, it not only woke up my friend's family in the house, \nbut the neighbours who called the police, thinking something has gone very \nwrong.\n\nNeedless to say, I got out of that room right quick, and spent the rest of \nthe night on the couch. The next morning, we all went back into the room, \nand we saw small footprints imprinted in the carpet of the room that didn't \nmatch anyone in the house. Everybody's feet were too large to have made the \nfootprints. To add to that, they were right where the girl was standing.\ufeff",

                "text": "      When I was 12ish, I walked out of my room in the middle of the night \nto go upstairs to p, and saw the family dog doing what I can only describe \nas playing with an invisible person in the downstairs family room. \n Spinning circles, wagging her tail, sitting and pawing up at empty air, \nnever taking her eyes off the wall 10 feet in front of her.  She was \ncompletely silent, never growled, never barked, and I recall being more \nconfused than scared at the time.  I harsh whispered her name in the dark \nwith something like \"Scooter, WTF are you doing?!?\" and she immediately \nstopped and ran over to me, with that sheepish look dogs get when they are \nfeeling guilty about something bad they've done.  To this day I have no \nidea what was going on.  Doggy dementia, sleepwalking, stroking out?  Not a \nclue.  I can tell you it sure LOOKED like my dog was playing with a ghost, \nand vice versa.\n     Still raises the hair on the back of my neck to remember it, almost 30 \nyears later.\ufeff",

My mom would \nalways poke her head in our bedroom door to check on my brother and I \nbefore she went to bed, and i could always hear her walking down the \nhallway before she opened the door. After a few months of living there, I \nstarted to hear footsteps (after she'd gone to bed) coming down the hall \nand stopping at the bedroom door, but it wouldn't open. I asked her about \nit and she told me that she had already gone to sleep by that time. Then, \nit started to get spooky. There were nights that i would wake up around \n2-3am and i could hear the TV on in the living room. I'd go in there and \nthe TV would just be on, at high volume when i knew that i had turned it \noff. One day, my mom and I came home from the store, and we expected my \nbrother to be just getting home from his friend's house. I walked into our \nbedroom and noticed the closet door was open and just as I though it was \nstrange, a beach ball flew out of the closet and missed my face by a few \ninches. I thought it was my brother messing around so i opened the closet \nand there was nobody in there. My brother came home about ten minutes \nlater. About a week after that, i was walking down the same hallway when \nthe glass dome around a light fixture on the ceiling came loose and barely \nmissed me before shattering on the floor. Other weird stuff happened there, \nbut after we moved, it all stopped. I never did find out if anything bad \nhappened there or if anyone died in the apartment, but i still get chills \nthinking about that place.",

From \nwhat i remember he was as tall as me and was kind of like a shadow version \nof me, (from when I was one to about four). I remember him showing up when \nI was alone. The two most vivid memories of him are when my mom asked me to \nget something from the office, so I walked over to the office (which was \ndark) he showed up, he copied every movement I made, I yelled at him and \nstarted crying but he kept mimicking me and getting closer and when I ran \nto the kitchen he followed me. The second things I remember was some nights \nI was unable to leave my room after I fell asleep, the windows and door was \ngone and I was enclosed in pretty much a big box. One time when I was \nalone, under the table a saw a mutilated corpse of a blond woman. One of \nthe days I was able to get out of my room at night and I went to my parents \nroom, as I lay on the bed I looked outside the open door to see some \nfloating kitchen ware. The one thing I don't remember but my mom told me \nwas how I got the scar on my knee, I was playing with my Hot-wheels and he \nran it into me hard.\ufeff",

                "text": "By the way, There is this thing, I don't know what it's called in English. \nBut basicly it means your half asleep and half awake at the same time. So \nyou're still dreaming but you are also awake and able to see for example \nyou bedroom. This combined with nightmares can cause some heavy panic and \nanxiety attacks. I have suffered from this aswell (\"not\" the attacks) I was \njust lying in my bed and saw a sort of clown faced poltergeist bending over \nme grabbing my arm tight and bendig further down. Me being able to realise \nit is a dream and trying to convince myself I am stronger then him. Unable \nto move, hearing my own heavy breathing and shaking of fear I try to make \nmyself wake up. After a minute or so of intense mental battling I manage to \nwin and see the clownfaced thing dissappear vaguely, the grip on my arm is \nreleased and I can move to sit-up straight in my bed. I hope it is indeed \njust a dream, because if I'm really being haunted, believing in ghosts \nwould weaken my position in this fight since it happens occassionally. Just \nwanted to share this and hear others opinions on it. (sorry if my English \nisn't 100% correct lol)\ufeff",

So anyway, it started out with me just hearing a faint buzzing \nnoise then out of the blue a ton of weird bugs show up, like some of them \nwere like huge lightning bugs crawling on the ceiling, and a huge swarm of \ngnat like things flying around, there were also the lightning bug things \nfalling from underneath the desk and climbing onto my bed, with the swarm, \nit would fly all around my room, and lead right into my face, it was so \nlike, in detail, that I could feel the wind from their wings, and the sting \nof their bite. So I freaked out, and turned on the light. It all vanished. \nI'm not able to sleep with the light on, and when I'm really tired I \nhallucinate, so I got back into bed with the lights off. After like 10 \nseconds, the bugs were back. Think that's weird?? Here's the weirdest part: \nI was pretty much petrified after that, and when ALL the bugs went onto the \nbed, I seriously said NO GO BACK out loud, and it being my mind, it went to \nthe end of the bed and sat there. It came back after a bit, and I said NO \nand it disappeared. This is one of my creepiest experiences!!",

I'm not a physiologist or anything \nbut I have had friends that were super stressed from say collage or work or \nlife in general why sleeping would see or feel things on top of them.  One \nfriend of mine was half asleep and saw a shadow of someone on top of him \ntrying to choke him.  he fought the it off only to discover no one was \nactually there.  soo if you are currently over stressed about something you \nmight want to get some help.",

I got done with my business, washed my \nhands and started fixing my hair to waste time so I didn't have to go to \nclass for a while. When I looked back up in the mirror, I saw this figure \nbehind me. It was the outline of a man, few inches taller than me. It had \nno face, but purple and blue sort of swirling around, like a hole. It's \nhard to explain, but it looked terrifying. I stood, shocked and \nimmobilized, I swear my legs felt like lead. Whatever it was said \"Psst, \ncome here!\" And when I turned around, it was leaned over behind the corner \ngoing into the girls room and said \"Follow me!\" And when I stepped into the \nhalls, I couldn't see a thing. It was all silent, too, real creepy. It \ncouldn't have been anyone, i would have seen them running or ducking into \nthe boys bathroom, or into the only classroom near the bathrooms, which was \nthe one I was in at the period. I still have no idea what it was.\ufeff",

This means a generation \nthat existed BEFORE Adam and Eve. Genesis 1:1 says that IN THE BEGINNING \nGod created the heavens and the earth. But then in verse 2 its says that \neverything was in disorder and chaos. God does NOT create things in \ndisorder and chaos. He does things perfect. So, something else put it in \nthat state. Further verses in other books hint that of another civilization \nhere on earth, and when Lucifer was thrown out of heaven, he spread hate to \nthe first world and eventually they destroyed themselves. And I'm not \nreferring to the fallen angels. Fallen angels are different than demons. \nDemons are the wandering beings that lived on earth beforehand. Fallen \nangels were cast out of heaven. And I wouldn't take anything they say as \ntruth either. Just stay away.",

                "text": "I've been visited by the shadow too specially when I was younger around \n14-17 years old (I'm 22 now). I always thought I had experienced an \notherworldly visit, as I grew older those experiences slowed in frequency \nto a range of about twice per year from being more than 10 times per year. \nWhat I find strange is that my most recent experiences did not have any \nshadow of a man watching me sleep they were rather a sensation of fear. I \neventually started doing research and sharing my experience only to find \nout that it had a medical explanation which was the so called \"Sleep \nParalysis\" which described exactly my sensations of fear and vivid \nhallucinations. Sleep paralysis takes place when the brain wakes up but the \nbody remains asleep making you unable to move a finger or scream (this \nhappens when you are under constant strees or deprived of sleep). What \nintrigues me and which to this moment I have been unable to explain is why \ndo people who share my same experience describe seeing a big tall shadow \nstaring at them? is it a coincidence we all hallucinate with the same \nshadow? why does it have to be that shadow of a tall devilish man? why not \na tiger or a spider per say? and why does the tall devilish shadow of a man \nor demon  has dissappeared from my sleep paralysis scenarios since I \ndiscovered it's scientific explanation? those are the things I'm yet unable \nto explain and I doubt they have an explanation. \ufeff",

I was so scared but something told me to \nhelp her, so I tried too but when I stepped 1 foot near her, she turned her \nhead all the way around, got up with her body turning with her and walked \ntowards me, I tried running but I couldn't, so I just closed my eyes and \nwished her away, and when I opened them she was gone but she was still \nthere she was behind me so I turned around and passed out randomly. The \nnext morning I woke up on out kitchen floor. I had no clue what she was or \nif someone had died there, idk but thank goodness we moved out.

It only lasted for a short while. Then i stopped doing it. \nMaybe because I knew it was possible and got bored of it.

                "text": "When I was, we lived with my grandparents. My parents and grandparents \nslept downstairs and my sister and I slept upstairs in the nursery. We had \na \"nurse maid\" (we called her that later after hearing the term on tv). She \nwas a very pretty lady in her mid-twenties named Violet. She never spoke, \nbut we just knew that was her name somehow. She would sit in the rocking \nchair every night humming, never singing words, just humming. Sometimes she \nwould hug us and finger comb our hair until we fell asleep, some times she \nwould even rock us to sleep during a bad thunderstorm. I remember her just \nas real as any other adults in my life. I remember the feel and scent of \nher skin, the tone of her humming, tunes of her songs, and even the rhythm \nshe would comb my hair. My sister and I legitimately thought she was a \nmember of the family even though she never left the nursery, my parents \nassumed she was just an imaginary friend or a dream. Then after my grandpa \ndied she disappeared. \nWhen I was about 10 my grandma, my sister, and I were looking though old \nfamily photos and we saw a black and white picture of Violet from 1943. \nBoth me and my sister, pointed at it at the same time and said \"That's \nViolet!\" And my grandma, who wasn't even surprised, said \"Yes, do you \nrecognize her?\" \nMy sister said, \"Of course, she was our nanny, wasn't she?\"\nGrandma shook her head, apparently, my grandpa had a wife before my \ngrandma, she was a very kind woman who loved kids and always wanted one. \nShe had two miscarriages before her third pregnancy where she had finally \nmade it to her third trimester, she was so excited and had been preparing \nthe nursery for the baby when she went into pre-term labor and bled to \ndeath. But just because she couldn't have her own kids doesn't mean she \nwouldn't watch out for her husband's babies. My grandma would often see a \nmist hovering above my mom and uncle's cribs when they were babies, and \nthey used to always talk about \"Violet from the upstairs bedroom\" when they \nwere young as well. And even when my grandma was pregnant she would feel a \nwarm, comforting embrace protecting her. She's convinced that Violet had \nstuck around to keep the new children safe. But then when my grandpa died \nshe moved on to be with him.\ufeff",

Did cavemen become scientists and study human life? Was any \nhuman alive to actually see the creation of all this? No. We can't even \ntravel past the moon....And god.....how do we know this \"person\" or being \ncreated us? Religion is based off of what we make ourselves believe to \ncomfort ourselves. How can you know that an explosion or a person created \nus? That's right. You don't. If someone expirenced ghosts that is known to \nthem. They don't need anyone elses approval. And How the fuck do you know \nhe was autistic? You don't. And Naruto is the 3rd most popular Manga in \nhistory. Enjoyed by children, teenagers, and adults. wtf?? Your just a \nhater. Everything that we know & love is speculation. We will never KNOW \nhow we were created. People have debates like this all the time, \nstalemating each other. I am 17. OH NOOOOOO I REVELED MY AGE!!!!!! whats \ngonna happen to me? Nothing. Quit being a douche and trying to convince \neveryone that what you claim is real or fake. NOBODY will ever know.

Anyways, at around 4am I woke up \nto go to the bathroom, but before I got up I heard a something that sounded \nlike my mom's military pants rubbing together when she walked. I was used \nto my mom's weird ever changing schedule, so I thought nothing of it except \nfor the fact that it sounded like she was running. I was a little freaked \nout so I waited to go to the bathroom which was just across the hall. My \ndog was peacefully watching me on my bed not worried about a thing, this \nalways made me feel better. So I go to the bathroom and while I was in \nthere I heard the running sound again, I was freaking out so I waited in \nthere for a while longer. When I was back in my room my dog decided that \nshe was going to go sleep in the living room instead, not wanting to be \nalone I followed her to sleep on the couch with her. How I was positioned I \ncould see down the dark hall, when I looked into the dark I saw a bright \nwhite face floating about 8 feet high (we had 10 foot ceilings) looking at \nme with its long skeletal face. I was frozen in fear so I pretended not to \nsee it, although my dog didn't even react to it. When I woke in the morning \nmy mom asked why I slept on the couch, I told her I wanted to sleep with my \ndog (Black Labrador, big dog=safe). I asked her if she was up at all last \nnight for work or something, she replied that she had the entire weekend \noff and didn't even use the bathroom that night. \n\nI now sleep with my door shut...\ufeff",

At \nfirst Carl would just make lots of noise on the stairs at my house (which \nat the time frightened me), I told my friends about this a day that they \ncame over, so they were kind of teasing me until we were going to bed and \nCarl started playing and freaking them out as well (this is when we named \nhim). After that I wasn't afraid of him at all anymore, even though he was \nconstantly being a pest and knocking stuff over, opening my drawers, and \nthe like (he never did break anything, though).\n One time a few months later I had another friend over and we were home \nalone and she said that she wanted some pizza pockets. A few minutes later \nwe could hear the microwave running. Sure enough, when we went down there, \ninside the microwave was a plate of pizza pockets...\nNot to mention the countless times I would wake up with a wicked cough and \nfind a glass of water next to my bed...\n\nSadly, Carl disappeared about a year or so ago. I really miss him, his \nshenanigans were oddly... comforting...\n\nHowever, for a month or so,  there was another spirit, this time a girl, \nwho would sing to me when I was having a rough night. She would always sing \nAmazing Grace and had a very pretty voice. But she didn't stay for long.\ufeff",

So this \nday I wake up to them, except that this time my family was awake and on the \nground floor (I was in the second floor) and I decide to go downstairs and \ntell my parents, and they just respond with \"Oh, it must be the TV\" so I \nand check their room, except that their TV was off, and it was the only \ntelevision on the top floor other than my own, which I always turned off \nbefore sleeping. After moving out of that house a couple of years later, I \nnever knew what those voices were, and the strangest thing is that the \nhouse wasn't even old and had a story, we just bought an empty plot which \nwas available in a new area of the city and built the first house that had \never been on that plot.\ufeff",

I heard rustling to my right. My friend was sleeping \non the air mattress beside me so I thought none of it. Then I heard things \non my dresser moving (Which was to the right of my friend). I open my eyes \nto see my friend asleep on the mattress, and a black figure fiddling with \nthings on my dresser. I just stared at it, not scared at all, and started \nasking it questions. \n\nQuestions about demons and angels, heaven and hell. To which HE (which I \nfound out) was answering all of them, calmly, while still fiddling with \nthings on my dresser. Then I asked one question that got his attention. \n\"How do people sell their souls to the devil?\" It stopped. Dropped what it \nhad and just stood there without saying anything for about 10 seconds. Then \nit turned around, calmly still, stepped over my friend, and was now \nstanding right beside my bed, right by my shoulders. He said some things i \ndon't quite remember, but then he said \"Like this!\" He pushed down right \nacross my abdomen, by my belly button, and just kept pushing!\n\nHe pushed so hard that I could FEEL my skin & organs wrap around my spine. \nAt the same time, I was hearing an unbearable sound, like the whistling in \nyour ear mixed with a train speeding past you. I tried to push his hand off \nbut couldn't. I \"woke\" up and he wasn't there. I was in a cold sweat, \nstomach in pain and I couldn't really do anything. I just stayed awake for \na bit calming myself down then went back to sleep. The next morning, when I \nwent to shower, I looked in the mirror and saw a clearly visible red line \nRIGHT where the thing had pushed. All across my stomach.. My friend heard \nnothing and to this day, I believe these beings exists. \ufeff",

What concerns me is your phrases \"just a \ntheory\" and \"make it accepted fact\". Why are you trying to discuss science \ntopics? You're clearly not qualified, as evident by those comments.\nI'm trying to stay calm, but \"just a theory\" makes me see red. I mean, it \nreally pisses me off. The education system is partially to blame, but you \nhave some responsibility too. We've been explaining what a Theory is for \ndecades; every time you people misuse it. And still you just won't catch \non. \nA Theory is the acme, the apex, the pinnacle of science. They are the goal, \nthe target, the payoff for all the hard work. \"Just a theory\" is like \nsaying \"just everything\" or \"just the winner\". And a Theory does not become \na fact. No more than blue will ever become a flavor. These are introductory \nterms. Learn what they mean.\nAnd while you're at it, familiarize yourself with the logical fallacies. \nThey are the rules used to discern which evidence is valid, to determine \nwhat we know. The rules of the game. Start with the Argument from Ignorance \nfallacy.\nConvince me you understand these concepts and we might discuss some topics. \nTo be clear, I don't play chess with pigeons. I hunt them.\nThanks for the compliment, I appreciate it. I take pride in my writing. \nIt's nice when it gets noticed. Even if it was only the scene from \n*Tombstone*. ",

We'll never know until we meet them. \n\nSince you're clearly and Atheist, scientist say that there are multiple \nuniverses/multiple dimensions.

It's a theory that has been \n\"proven\" by multiple coinciding factors that make it accepted fact. When \nactually, it's still just a theory. The scientists own belief.

It only happened twice in my life, thank god, but it was \nterrifying. \n\nOne time I was awoken suddenly by the sensation that I wasn't alone. I \ncouldn't move at all and I could see what appeared to be a \nblack...something in the corner of my ceiling. Looked kinda like a blob. Or \na floating smudge. I was in sheer terror, not knowing what was happening to \nme, and started to feel like I couldn't breathe. All I could do was close \nmy eyes, tell myself it had to be a dream and focus on regaining my motor \nskills. It was kinda like in Kill Bill when she's in the truck trying to \nwiggle her big toe. I finally got movement back and turned the lights on \nand sat up for a few hours.\n\n\nAnother time, I was woken by something seemingly shoving me. I was sleeping \non my side and it felt like something rolled me over and said something in \nmy ear. I can't remember what it said, but it was something creepy. \n\n\nThis all happened within a short period of time, and I was also having some \npretty unsettling dreams, that were scary, but for no good reason. Like I \ndreamt I was in my room, and I was trying to turn the lights on but \ncouldn't. Nothing worked. And my bedroom door started to open and I threw \nmyself against it, holding it shut. All I knew was I couldn't let whatever \nit was in. \n\n\nFinally I had a dream where I walked into my grandfather's room and he was \nin his bed ( the bed he died in fyi) and he looked sick and he was sitting \nupright and we had a conversation, but again I can't recall what we spoke \nof. But it frightened me. \n\n\nI don't attribute these things to the paranormal tho.",

                    "text": "+Sho Nuff\nI know, and obviously so do other people. Alas, this shall be the last \ncomment, so for any other readers, here are why ghosts will never be real: \nGhosts defy the laws of physics. A pure energy being would not be cold like \nmany  suggest, it would hot and burn everything in it's path. Something \nthat hot would also ionize the gas around it, making it look like a \nconstant light ball brighter than the surface of the Sun. There are also \nobvious logical errors. If you died and were stuck on Earth due to \nunfinished business, you would want to convince people to help you so you \ncan move on, right? Instead they are always poking you, pulling off bed \nsheets, standing at the end of a hallway, it's like they are just trying to \nscare you. Oh wait, that's right- ghosts were made up to scare people. \nThat's why they are always doing \"scary\" things, rather than intelligent \nthings. Furthermore, how come ghosts only exist in certain places from \ncertain times? I just think it is convenient that almost every failing \nhotel or motel all of the sudden has ghosts, or places where battles \nhappened, or just big Victorian houses. Where are the cave-men ghosts? The \nmedieval ghosts? On top of all of that, there are clear explanations as to \nwhy people see them. Beyond mental illness, pictures and videos can easily \nbe faked, people can also lie. there is also the fact that if you go into a \nplace THINKING it's haunted, your mind will create shadowy figures moving \nabout, and you will think every little noise is a ghost. All that being \nsaid, there is not a shred of evidence proving in any way ghosts exist.",

Me and my cousin Ella were playing in the garden, my \nmother was out shopping and my father was watching tv. After half an hour \nwe heard someone rustling around. We ignored it, and decided to go inside. \nWe tried the door but it wouldn't open, so we started calling my father to \nhelp us get back in. We heard something really loud, like someone had fell \nover, but when we turned around we saw something called 'the rake' as I \nknow now after investigating further, and i can honestly say we shit \nourselves. We turned around and starting screaming and banging on the door. \nAfter 5 minutes of that i felt it grab my shoulder and pull me back. It did \nthe same to Ella but then something unexpected happened. After he pulled us \nback (very gently) about a meter he climbed through the open window. We \nboth panicked but had no idea what to do. After several minutes the door \nswung wide open and the thing clambered out. It crawled past us and turned \nround to face us and i SWEAR he was tring to smile. Then he lept over the \nback wall, and we never saw him again. He had done no harm at all to us or \nthe house, but when i saw the things he'd done, i nearly cried in anger. \nSure, he looked scary but he meant no harm at all. This memory will \nprobably stay with me forever.\ufeff",

She lived with her mum and dad in alaska. \nOne evening britney's mum and dad went to a night club. Britney stayed home \nwatching TV. Suddenly when she looked at the window she saw a man staring \nat her with a knife. Britney started screaming, she ran to the kitchen and \ntook the phone and called the police. Few minutes later the police came \ninside and asked \"What's wrong!?\" Britney told she saw a man staring at her \nwith a knife from the window. The police went to look at the window guns \nout. But then there was nobody there. The police told britney that there \nwas no footprints in the snow outside. So she has probabbly watched too \nmany horror movies. But britney screamed \"BUT I SAW HIM WITH MY OWN EYES!!\" \nThe police calmed her down and left. Then britney started thinking what if \nhe never was in the window what if it was a reflection what if he was \nactually behind m.... Then britney turns around slowly.. The man was there \nhe was staring britney this hole time. Then the man killed britney and left \nthe house. THE END\n\nOk so here is another one then tell me witch one was scarier\n\n\n\nOk so once upon a time i walked athome and BAM i step on a lego. THE END\n\nPersonally the second one gave me nightmares.\ufeff",

I never really realized it until earlier \nthis year, but I remember little things from when I was... 5-6, like seeing \na shadow at the window when no one was actually at the window, or hearing \nstrange noises at night, even seeing things through the corner of my eye, \neven if they were just something flashing by. Now tho, as I suffer from \nother personal problems, it got to the point where I saw a man, taller than \nme, standing in the corner of my room at night. It wasnt exactly a man, \nmore like a shadow, but even in the darkness of my room, I would see it. \nOnly I could, even if I sleep with other people in the room. Plus, only I \nwoke up. I could make out claws, but for some reason I never saw it's feet. \nI even named it. I called it Carl. Keep in mind that I'm 13, so I dont keep \nguns in my room. Anyway, carl didnt do much, but often pointed at me like \nhe's gonna do something. He just stood there and pointed, sometimes \nhovering, but I still felt extremely intimidated and afraid, so I have to \nsleep with SOME kind of light in the room. I'm afraid of absolute darkness \nnow, and I have to sleep with my face towards a wall, almost completely \ncovered in blankets in fear of seeing him. So I feel you .-.",

                "text": "Well here is my personal creepy story that goes back to 2002. I was about \n19 at that time.\n\nWe were a group  of a dozen friends and one night we decided to go in the \nwoods at 2AM. One of our friends was a big pussy, so we had the idea of \nhidding in the woods as we were walking without him noticing. Let him freak \nout for a minute and then jump scare him.\n\nI got out of the group as planned and kept myself in a nice hidding spot. \nit was a full moon night so visibility was \"ok\" even without flash lights.\n\nI waited for a good 5... maybe 10 minutes. I expected to hear our friend \nscream or call for us... But nothing.\n\nI finally decided to move out of my hidding spot and rejoin with the \ngroup... OR find someone else at least.\n\nI finally heard wood cracking sounds around me, like foot steps. I called \nout, but no one answered. Finally i kinda figured out that now i was the \none being victim of the prank. And someone was fucking with me. I kepts \nhearing something going in circles around me. I acted though to make the \npoint that the prank wasn't going to work on me. \"Alright, i know who this \nis... Stop fucking around\".\n\nFinally, i saw a shape appearing from behind a tree. It just stepped out of \nits hidding spot and i couldn't really see who that was. I could see it was \na guy, but it was too dark to see clearly. I said \"Kevin? Is that you?\" No \nanswers... \"David! David i know its you!\" Still no answer.\n\nThan i heard voices from far away,  \"JOHN! JOHN! WHERE ARE YOU MAN?\" It was \nmy friends, calling me from out of the forest. The pranked had failed. They \ngot out of the forest a long time ago and didn't realise i wasn't with them \nuntill much later.\n\nThe reality of the situation quickly ticked : \"All this time, i was talking \nto a complet stranger in the middle of the woods\".\n\nNeedless to say that I ran my ass off, not looking back and followed the \nvoices of my friends.\n\nI finally got back to them and the fact that all of them were there waiting \nfor me confirms that that \"man\" in the woods was not one of them fucking \nwith my head.\n\nI don't know what that thing was to this day. I might have been just some \nhomeless dude in the woods. But either way, that was the creepiest \nexperience i have ever had.\ufeff",

                "text": "I got one. When i was younger around 16. I use to go to the bathroom and \nget high and just soak my bones in the tub. On one of these occasions i \nheard my mom screaming,\" who the fuck are you,\"! I thought i was cause at \nthis i was smoking that synthetic shit because i had to tske piss test. \nUntil i heatd that familliar voice and i got so fucking scared i jumped out \nof the fucking tub and put on boxers, didnt put on anything else nor dried \nmyself of, and ran out of the bathroom. I saw my bro talking to this guy \nwhile my mom was running to her bedroom to get my father. The guy was all \ncalm for a while saying hey to my bro. My brother was so fucking it wasnt \nfunny. My father ran out of his telling him,\"who the fuck are ya get the \nfuck outta here,\". The guy started freaking out yelling in shit say,\" her \nface is gone, i had to throw her over the fence,\"! Then my father just \nabout shit his pants because he mentioned the name april, which is the name \nof my sis. He then started walking in a circle around our front door \nsaying,\" feathers, feathers, feather, feathers suit,\" in a very calm almost \nconfident way. WAY different then he sounded minutes before. My father got \nhis shit together and perduaded him to go out the front door. I was so \nastounded i thought this shit is really fucking weird and came outta \nnowhere. I went outside called 911. I was talking to the person on the \nother until i heard the most god awful crie ever heard. I handed the phone \nto my mom and looked on the otherside of the porched to see the guy just \nshaking in the truck bawling like a baby. Then all of a sudden the shaking \nstops and as well as the crying. My father walked toeard the truck minutes \nlater when we had the guts to go up hill. The guy had his seat all the way \ndown just stairing at the trucks odometer in a way that you would see god \nfor the first time. He starts saying his shit about the bird suit and the \nwoman with no face. My father mentions the name april and the guy says,\" \nyou know her?,\" like the most dumfounded way you can possibly imagine. He \nstarts saying he went to farmerville, a town outside ours, and says he met \nup with april and about 10 guys and help him dump the feathered suited \nwoman with no face over a fencr and had horrible guilt about. My father \nnotices he worked for sonic because he had the uniform across the passenger \nseat. He said he dropped the keys on tje groung beneath my dads feet. My \ndad bends over and grabs for the keys when he reaches for something in his \ncar i starr freaking. My dad gets startled runs and the guy just starts \nlaughing. The cops show up about 10 mins later. All officers(around 10) \ndraw their weapons at the guy. They persuade him out of his truck and \narrest him and leave. The next day i call my sis and tell her and she was \nso dumbfounded about the fact he mentioned her by name. My brother also \nmentioned that he saw the same guy the dock the same day just walking in a \ncircle pacing while shaking his head. Latrr that week someone left a note \non the hood the car in scribbles all across the paper saying ,\"sorry\" about \na 200 times in small and large print. The only is that i believe he was \nschizophenic, but when we get together once a year. One of us will atleast \nmention this once. It was the scariest ive ever witnessed.\ufeff",

                "text": "I see a few stories on here, so I feel like posting mine. \n\nI remember a few years ago, when I was around maybe 10-11 (I'm 15 now), me \nand two of my cousins were staying together one night, and I was getting \nready to sleep, and one of my cousins was already asleep. My other cousin \nwas reading a book by the window.\n  \nSo I'm laying on the bed looking out the front window (this was in the \nliving room) and I see this man walk up on to the porch. He walked very \nslowly too, and he was pretty tall as well. At this time, I was already \naware of many creepypastas and stories and just seeing this man almost made \nme piss my pants. He, for added scariness i guess, stops and looks straight \nat me. I didn't see his face, let alone anything of his body, as he looked \nlike a silhouette, plus the streetlight was shining behind him. For maybe 5 \nminutes I'm just staring at this guy, thinking to myself, \"Oh holy crap, \ncalm down, who is this?!\"\n\nI looked at my cousin who was reading by the window and whispered \"who the \nheck is that?!\" and she looked to her right, and right by her was this man, \nstaring at me. she whispered \"WOAH I see him too!\" Both of us were staring \nat him now, for maybe another 5 minutes until he did his slow walk off the \nother side of the porch. Fortunately, we didn't see him again. This was a \npretty terrifying moment that I had, and I'm usually not the one to get \nscared often. \n\nNow that I look back at this, I want to say that the man was probably \nhomeless, as recently my cousin and I went in the woods behind my \ngrandmother's house (where the event took place), and we found the remnants \nof an old shack, with a mattress, sheets, clothing, etc. (even a pair of \nJordan's), but the clothing looks nothing like what this man wore. Then \nagain, I didn't see any of his clothes so I don't know.\ufeff",

Not really scary, but I just thought it \nbelonged here since it seemed to be a bit creepy.\n\nBack when my dad was 15 (he's 53 now), he used to work at Wendy's. It was \nall good, but one day he was getting ready to leave. His boss just got a \nnew car and was offering to take my dad home, so my dad said yeah. His \nboss's new car was a brand new 1970-something Ford Mustang Mach 1, green \nwith white leather interior.\n\nThey stopped at this intersection near a flower shop, and there were these \nbig bushes by the road. A gang of several men in dark clothing holding \nbaseball bats came out and ran towards the car, and surrounded the car. \nUnfortunately the window was down on my dad's side, and a man ran up with \nthe bat and yelled \"MOTHERFUCKER!\" and whacked him right in the face. It \nwas a miracle to see he survived. All the white leather interior, now \ncoated red. My dad was quickly rushed to the hospital, and had a temp \noperation on his face, until getting a full operation. All of the teeth on \nthe bottom were flattened.\n\nStrange thing about this was, they were never able to track down who did \nit, but my dad wants to believe that it was a gang sent out by someone he \nknew prior to the event. Very strange IMO, even stranger knowing we still \nhave the shirt O_o. Original blue and white Wendy's shirt with the original \nname tag, now a dingy red from the blood.",

So evolution is a fact, at least, it's a microbial fact. However, \nthe theory of evolution is not fact. It is a scientific theory. A \nscientific theory holds a different meaning than the word \"theory\". \nWikipedia defines it:\n\n\"A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of \nthe natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and \nrepeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation. As \nwith most forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are inductive \nin nature and aim for predictive power and explanatory force.\"\n\nAlternatively, Bing defines it as:\n\n\"A concept that has been well tested, and is accepted as an explanation to \na wide range of observations.\"\n\nIt is not a fact; as Wikipedia defined it, a scientific theory is inductive \nin nature which means it isn't proving anything. It's explaining something, \nand is accepted as the *most* true explanation for said theory. \nAdditionally, if a different scientific theory rolls around and happens to \nhave better predictive power than it's predecessor, that theory will likely \nreplace it's predecessor. So you can still refute the theory of evolution.\n\n+TroutLord Insulting a person's intelligence does not make an argument \nagainst his points; it is an ad hominem, I word I bet you're familiar with. \nAdditionally, there are plenty of other explanations for evolution, and \nfossil fuel does not confirm the theory of evolution or even that anything \nevolved, it merely confirms that creatures from times long past once lived \non earth. It is tiring to hear you proclaim something as fact without \nlogical argument, and then proceed to insult people because they disagree.\n\nStating that evolution proves the theory of evolution is a logical fallacy \nbecause it is an infinite regress, in case that happens to be your \nargument. And in case you argue that it isn't an infinite regress, I'll \ngive the philosophical definition:\n\n\"Causal or logical relationship of terms in a series without the \npossibility of a term initiating the series.\"",

I didn't remember even owning any poptarts. Then I heard \nthe same noise, but no sounds of an intruder. No footsteps, no anything. \nI'm more of a sceptacle guy, so I went to where I heard the sound. I go \noutside my roof and peer down the hall, and see a wrapper sitting in front \nof the staircase. Not a second later I hear the wrapper sound again. This \nhappens quite a few times, leading me down the stairs and into the kitchen. \nI grabbed the broom as I was walking through my house incase I needed to \ndefend myself. My house is fairly big, so it took me a while for the trail \nof wrappers and noises to lead me to the kitchen. i jump out from behind \nthe corner, expecting to see some retard eating poptarts, or a burglar, but \nnothings there. The only thing out of place was the open pantry door. I \nwalk over to the pantry, my broom in hand. I look inside the pantry and see \na package of blueberry poptarts. I almost want to laugh, because this seems \nhilarious, but I was pretty freaked out. I reach in the box, and pull out 5 \nempty pop tart wrappers. By now I was like, \"We must be dealing with a \ndiabetic\" and started laughing. I guess that it's my little brother eating \nsome kind of secret poptart stash, so I call his name. No reply, but I do \nhear child-like laughter. But not in the living room, not downstairs, not \nin the kitchen, but coming from the poptart. I start killing myself \nlaughing, and open the wrapper. I reach inside to grab a pop tart, but it's \nempty. I could have sworn i had just held a full poptart package. I look \ninside, and to my horror I find the boogie man, in his full glory. I crap \nmy pants and start vibrating like a nexus 1. He looks up at me and says, \n\"NICE POP TARTS BABE.\" His face was covered in crumbs, radiating red heat, \nand bloated like a egg placed in a forty year old microwave. I quickly \nshove the wrapper in the garbage, pull out my staff and firebend the \ntesserac into the sinful binnage, and force jump out the window. Now I live \nwith the nymphs on 224 Baker Street.\ufeff",

Scientists verified the \nexistence of the black holes by studying the speed of the clouds of gas \norbiting those regions. In 1994, Hubble Space Telescope data measured the \nmass of an unseen object at the center of M87. Based on the motion of the \nmaterial whirling about the center, the object is estimated to be about 3 \nbillion times the mass of our Sun and appears to be concentrated into a \nspace smaller than our solar system.\nFor many years, X-ray emissions from the double-star system Cygnus X-1 \nconvinced many astronomers that the system contains a black hole. With more \nprecise measurements available recently, the evidence for a black hole in \nCygnus X-1 -- and about a dozen other systems -- is very strong.\"\n\nThey were saying ghosts don't exist in our world. Therefor the ghosts he \nspoke of would have to follow this gravitational pull. Being that they \nsupposedly don't, where as everything else in this world does, they most \nlikely don't exist. Ghosts are the spirits of the deceased, correct? That \nmeans they would be in this world if anything. Unless *you* can find me \nproof of life parallel to us on other planets.\n\n*We should have a proof war. That sounds really fun to me for some reason. \nIt would probably lead off into sadness but it would be fun while it \nlasted. :3 Pweeese?*",

                "text": "I have a story I'd like to share.\nI live in an eastern part of San Diego between city suburbs and \ncountryside. One night, summer of this year, I took my bike out for an \nexercise since doing so at day is way too hot. Normally, I ride through the \nsuburbs, but for once I decided to take a ride around the country-town \nroads.\nI rode up a hill near a canyon, reservoir, and horse ranch on my way to a \n7-Eleven and I was the only one riding on that street, but I passed by a \ntelephone pole where I saw a dark figure in a hoodie with his head down. I \nthought he was looking at his phone or was resting his eyes, but when I \npassed by, he said in a low (but loud enough to hear) voice the words \n\"DON'T LOOK AT ME\". I thought he was depressed and wanted to be alone. But \nwhen I kept riding up the hill, I looked back 5 seconds later and he was \nstanding up facing towards me. I felt kinda unsettled, so then I kept \nriding, then I looked back again and he was quickly walking up the hill \ntowards me. He walked past a street light but I only saw very little of his \nface. He had a big grin showing his teeth but I didn't see much of his \neyes, the figure reminded me of that kid from the Let's Get Rocked video by \nDef Leppard. What was also weird is that even though he walked quite fast, \nI heard very little movement, almost silent.\nI immediately peddled faster and didn't want to look back anymore and kept \nriding until I arrived in a suburban area and at the 7-Eleven. I bought \nmyself some ice cream to calm my nerves, but I still felt terror. When I \ncame home, I tried to sleep but had difficulty due to intense fear. It was \njust too chilling to forget.\ufeff",

One day he \ndecided to stay up, laying down in his bed in the dark, and when she would \ntry to scare him she would see he's asleep and then he would jump up and \nscare her. So he decided to do that. He lied down with his covers on, and \nheard his door open so he knew it was her. So he closed his eyes to pretend \nhe was asleep. Then heard whispers of his name, and felt subtle scratches \non his face. But he kept his eyes closed and waited till he knew he would \ndefinitely scare her. He heard the whispers get louder, turn into voice, \nthe scratches getting harder, then a final shout of his name. His eyes \njolted open, and he seen the mask right up in his face. It seemed more \nscarier and realistic than usual, and had facial flexing features, but he \ncouldnt scream, he tried, but emitted no sound. So he closed his eyes, and \ncried a bit till he heard his door open and seen his cousin walk in and \nturn on his light with some candy..\ufeff",

Well, I heard \nher calling for me from the attic, now just a few days ago I found out that \nthe light in the attic went out, not that it mattered but my sister had a \nhabit  back then of hiding in the room inside of it knowing I wouldn't go \nup. She was literally crying out, \"Help me, I can't see. The light's out \nand it's dark outside!\" It was around 10 at night. And I told her, just \nfollow my voice, not approaching the attic of course, but quickly realizing \nhow stupid that was I told her to stay where she was and called my brother \nto go get it. The screaming stopped once my brother approached and I told \nhim to get the light. I assumed it was because she had calmed down when she \nheard me call him. Long story short, she wasn't there. She was  already \ndownstairs sleeping in my baby brother's room. \ufeff",

                "text": "This is not a true story, but one I just made up XD.\nSo I was in school, did some work and shit. I ended school, Went outside \nand took the bus home. I ran all the way home as I was too lazy to walk \nnormally. I open my front door, get my shoes off, take my backpack off and \nunloads my computer and stuff in the kitchen. After a few hours my dad and \nmom have came home, so we cook some food and have dinner. After a while of \nplaying videogames and stuff my mom comes into the room to tell me I have \nto goto bed. I close my laptop and go to the bathroom, brush my teeth and \nall that stuff. I walk out of the bathroom and say goodnight to my parents. \nI walk into my room. But instantly when Walking in, I get this kinda dark \ncreepy chill. I look around, but see nothing. Just to be sure I walk into \nmy parents room and wake my dad up and tells him what happened. He follows \nme into my room, and tells me he gets the same chill. So he goes into a \nwardrobe and get a security camera that I've never seen Before. He puts it \nup in a corner in the roof of my room. So he says goodnight and goes out of \nthe room. Though this chill is still there. But I remember my dog is \nstanding besides my feet, I take him up and gets to bed. I lay him down \nbesides me, and falls asleep quickly. I Dream about nothing and continues \nby waking up at approximately 3-4 AM. I feel this chill but like 4x worse. \nI barely open the left Eye, which is the only one seeing anything. I don't \nsee anything, but I feel the coldness and chill. So I open it fully, just \nto find a black shadow looking down at me, I am first silent, so it looks \nat me as if I was weird. Then all suddenly I Barely looks behind the shadow \nand see my dad and mom standing outside the room, putting up a finger to be \nquiet. I am quiet and just Before the shadow is about to interfer with me, \nmy dad and mom comes rushing in with knives in their hands, yelling with \nall force they've got to the shadow. They honestly scare the living shit \nout of it, and it dissapears immediately. So they hug me and like \"Thank \ngod you're ok!\" kinda stuff. So I fall asleep again. Though I wake up not \nlong later, 1 and a half hour maybe, and I feel the chill again. I look up \nand see the black shadow, this time with a smile on it's face, whispering \n\"Now you're mine forever. :)\" With a creepy smile. I can't even Think or \nsee or hear that a Swat team rushes in, yelling \"GET OUT OR WE WILL OPEN \nFIRE!\" and it flies through the room out the wall, they start shooting, and \nI can hear kindof a scream from the wall, only revealing a bit of blood \nrunning down the wall. My whole family stands outside my room crying from \nhappiness and walks in only for me to find out that the shadow was a ghost \nof a serial killer that only murdered people from year 7 to 20.\ufeff",

When I was 9 my family went to six flags and me and my \nbrother who was 16 at the time went off on our own while my parents had my \nlittle sister. \n\nAnyways while we were going from ride to ride and stuff, this old guy \naround 60 years old started following us around and such. Like everywhere \nwe went he would follow and he did so for around an hour. \n\nEventually me and my brother went to one of the restaurant things for \nlunch, I sat down down at one of the outside tables while my brother went \nto get us our food. While my brother was away, the old guy came and sat \ndown next to me, asking me where my family was and such and then he told me \nif I came with him he'd buy me toys and whatnot. \n\nAnd then out of nowhere I hear \"What the fuck\" and then I saw my brother \ntackle the guy and started basically beating the shit out of him, security \ncame and took all 3 of us to the security office with police and such. My \nbrother told them what the guy said to me and then after they did a \nbackground check they found out that the old guy was a convicted pedophile \nand kidnapper O.o\ufeff",

Now it was a school night so I wanted to go back to \nsleep but I couldn't. At least like 10 seconds later I hear a basketball \nbouncing. I look out my window and make sure nobody is outside with a \nbasketball and there wasn't anyone outside. I open my door and the bouncing \nstops. I close my door and lay back down and there it goes again but it's \neven louder. It sounded like it was coming from the living room so I went \nto the living room and I didn't see anything, not even a basketball. Scared \nout of my mind I run to my brother's room and wake him up asking if he \nheard anything. He said that he was sleep the whole time and told me to go \nback to sleep. I made up a lie saying I didn't want to go back to sleep \nbecause I was scared of polkka dots ( my room was covered in pink and \npurple polka dots ). He told me that I could sleep with him so I did and \nthe noise happened again. It was driving me crazy so I just covered myself \nwith blankets and fell asleep. After that I never heard it again and I'm \nstill trying to figure out where the noise came from. My brother still \nthinks I'm crazy too\ufeff",

Our camper was near the forest I was setting up the s'mores all I \nneeded was graham crackers so I went back into the camper to get them. But \nwhen I looked out the window I saw this tall figure that look like a wolf, \nbut stood like a man I freaked out and started jumping up and down in \nterror. The figure saw me and I was so shocked that I dropped the graham \ncrackers and passed out. I woke up around 8:31 but my family still wasn't \nat our campsite I went out to see what had happened but all I could see of \nevidence was scratch marks on the walls where the window was huge paws on \nthe ground and the Hershey's and the marshmallows were gone but one which \nwas covered in slobber. I thought it was some stray dogs but there was a \nfence around the place so I thought I was going insane so I started bashing \nmy foot with a rock to see if I thought the pain felt nice, but no it felt \nlike a terrible idea but then I realized that it could of been the Michigan \nWolfman. I went to my neighbors who looked like they were drunk, I asked \nthem about the wolfman they did a mad look then growled. I felt uneasy, I \nsaid \"Um are you mad at me?\" They just nodded and shooed me away. I went \nback into my camper in confusion I called my parents but there was no \nsignal, I heard the neighbors in pain then loud growls I got so scared that \nI ran to the bunks and got to the top one. Then I felt the camper shake, \nthen the camper door lost its bolts and fell. I covered my head and mouth \nbut I couldn't help but breathing hard and the wolfman got me THE END \nScared much?",

I said to \nit, \"Hello who are you?\" and she answered back to me, \"I'm your dead older \nsister silly, just go back to sleep.\"  and she smiled.\nSo I did what she had asked me to do and I went back to sleep not making a \nbig deal about it. It was until I was 14 years old that I remembered that \nand I asked my mom about, \"Did you happen to have a miscarriage before I \nwas born mom?\" and my mom said that before she had me at 39, she had a \nmiscarriage when she was 28 years old and it was a girl.\n\nAfter her telling me that I remember that I felt sad over it, because it \nwas my would of been older sister.

Oh, the house is old, its probably the floor boards. I go \nback upstairs to watch my show. When I do, I hear, Joelle? Joelle, are you \nhere? Yes! I yelled. No one was there. I decided that I would type my \nessay. I go on the computer. 20 minutes I was typing, and hearing, \nJoeelle....Joeellleee.....come plaaayyyy..... I was flipping out. I just \nwent to watch tv. When I did, out of the corner of my eye, I see a shadow. \nIt looked like a man with a hat figure outside. I tried to turn on the \nlight just to find I couldn't.

                "text": "Danger dolan, what about the true story of what happened behind the scenes \nof the 1976 movie \"The Omen\"?\n\nTwo months before filming the movie begun, Gregory Peck, who starred in the \nmovie, his son committed suicide.\n\n\nThe director, Richard Donner's hotel was bombed by the IRA during filming.\n\nThe day after the film's safari park scene was filmed, an animal handler \nwas mauled by a lion while animal handlers involved in the cemetery scene \nwere attacked by dogs\n\n\nThere were several incidents with planes. When a few crewmembers were \nswitched to another plane at the last minute, the plane they were \noriginally meant to board crashed on take off, killing everyone on board.\n\nA stuntman who worked on \"The Omen\" suffered an accident whilst working on \nthe movie \"A Bridge Too Far\". He was standing on top of a roof, preparing \nto shoot a scene when he mysteriously fell off the roof. When waking up in \nhospital, he claimed that someone pushed him off from behind, even though \nthere was nobody else on the roof at the time.\n\nMonths after filming The omen had finished, John Richardson, a movie \ndesigner who worked on The Omen, and his assistant, Lizzie Moore were in a \ncar crash on a highway at night. Lizzie was cut in half and her body looked \nsimilar to David Warner's character when he was killed in The Omen.\n\nIn front of the crashed car, there was a road sign saying \" Ommen. 66.6km\"\n\nIf that's not a creepy true story, I don't know what is.\ufeff",

He doesnt have to \nprove otherwise to state a fact like that, the burden of proof isnt on him \nits on the one who makes the claim of ghosts in the first place, which ive \nlooked for years to find any and its all been fakes (some pretty good ones \nat that), lets say there is proof ghosts exist, still wouldnt mean he was \npushed off by one. Wheres the ghosts trial here? Maybe the ghost is being \nframed, no one has evidence for either side and this would not hold up in \ncourt lol.\n\nAs for Elcap\nDont just listen to one source, maybe look into facts before posting \nsomething you saw on tv, especially coming from a biased tv show obviously \nreleased to promote the remake of the omen, or is it just another \"spooky\" \ncoincidence that those 2 things were released months apart from each other? \nSometimes you have to ask yourself, is this show not being truthful to me?\nThere are no signs in the netherlands or even europe that go to the 1/10th \nof a km, let alone to a .6, that wouldnt make much sense would it. It \nliterally takes one minute to find this stuff out on google. At the very \nheight of coincidence it could have said 66km and they exaggerated the \nextra 6 for the tv show, but hey anything to get people to go to the remake \nor buy the dvd. Just makes me wonder what else they exaggerated, dont get \nsuckered into stuff like this, i know its fun but when you spread \nmisinformation without at least looking up some basics it turns hundreds of \npeople into idiots because most of them dont triple check let alone double \ncheck the facts and sources they hear, and then the cycle continues.",

                "text": "This one is a true story. One day I was strolling down the farm when \nsuddenly, a huge shadow came across with a giant bird-like lizard figure \nflew over my head. I was so shocked that I screamed so loud. Having my mind \nboggled with what I saw, twisted words started to come out of my mouth and \nnot knowing what was happening, the figure suddenly became crippled and was \nunable to fly. The figure then fell out of the sky and hit the ground so \nhard. After what has happened, the thing started decaying, releasing \ncolorful tints that mixes with the wind and for some godforsaken reason, \nthe colorful wind surrounded me and I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I \nhad. Townspeople witnessed what has happened and this was when I first met \nmy destiny. My destiny to save the world and all of humanity. My destiny as \ndragonborn.\ufeff",

Once, I was in the middle of an episode and I started having a \nseizure. I was screaming while seizing simultaneously. It apparently was so \nterrifying that my moms heart stopped and my dad had to try to resuscitate \nher to no avail. Ever since my night terrors stopped, I've been \nexperiencing sleep paralysis for 5-10 minutes every fortnight or so. Every \ntime this happens, I see my mom in the corner of my ceiling with her body \ncontorting and her face making an emotionless grin.\n\nPlease, someone help me. How do I fix this, I've even contemplated suicide \nbecause I can't handle this anymore!\ufeff",

I also a nightmare about a ghost haunting my house, and another \nnightmare which I cannot remember, all in the same night.\nThe next night my lil sis had 3 nightmares almost the same kind I had. \nThe next night me and her both had a nightmare at the same time.\nAbout two days later my BFF, told me she thinks a ghost is haunting her \nhouse, the ghost was a black person, with curly hair, clothes from about \n2009, and a gunshot wound. The ghost looks like her, and she lives in the \nbasement, my friend only noticed her when she moved her room to the \nbasement of the house. The girl rarely talks, but she told my friend, \n\"You're mom is really shitty.\" or something like that, I asked her if the \nghost was there now and she said yeah she's just staring at her. Then she \nwent into the kitchen, I asked her if the ghost was still there, and she \nsaid as soon as I said that the ghost rose out of the floor like some kind \nof zombie. My Bff also said the ghost isn't like 'evil' or something she \njust....calm I guess.\nSo far shes the only one that sees her, I believe her, so I'm terrified to \ngo to her house. \nBut I need a second opinion on this, do you think my BFF is telling the \ntruth?\ufeff",

We drove TO Disneyland there and went back \nhome taking this route. The night my mom was driving us home, I was \nsleeping. We stopped and my mom and grandma were awake and I asked why we \nstopped. My mom told me it's nothing (probably to not scare me) my grandma \ntold me why she stopped and she said as she was driving along the ridge, \nshe saw two guys pushing a car who looked like they needed help or someone \nto help them. They were pushing the car along the ridge and it looked \ndangerous.\nMy mom wanted to help so she stopped, as she stopped supposedly she \naccidently bumped into the two men but when she went outside the van, they \nwere gone and the car wasn't there. They all had disappeared. :/ Mu grandpa \nand mom saw it and I wish I was awake to have seen it for myself.\ufeff",

Some people \ncan get so scared after that they could have a seizure or a heart attack. \nYour some what lucky it wasn't a heart attack. When people have theese \nattacks they can feel the monster in they're dream so it explains the kiss \nand most of it but if someone saw you having the epileptic attack then \nthat's just freaky. Hope this helped you out you can look more into it on \nYouTube and stuff just don't get to freaked out.",

While \nin my dream I can see someone at my window. It felt so real. So I wake up \nout of fear and as soon as I open my eyes I see myself smiling looking at \nme in my eyes. I couldn't move, yell, talk. I can only move my eyes around \nand I look to my right where my gf is sleeping next to me and I see her \nstaring at herself almost like floating above her. They didn't say anything \nnor move they just hovered above us and smiled from ear to ear. I finally \nclose my eyes and I can slowly start to move. Finally I open my eyes again \nand nothing is there. I gain full mobility and I jump out of my bed wide \nawake. I didn't go to sleep again after that. True story man.

                "text": "Next story, I bet no one in these comments knows the horrors of chuckee \ncheese(is that how u spell it idk), I'm 11, so this is my point of view. \nThe place was about to close down in 5 minutes, and we were still in, it \nwas on our holiday. Then they started to close and I was in the bathroom, \nno one left cause they were waiting but then they took the mascots away. \nAnd shut down. We went down the back and saw a mascot, which seemed to move \nits head towards us(which petrified me) then the back door opened up and an \nemployee took out the trash, but walked right through the bin. I almost \npissed myself, but then something screamed in the building which was \nf***ing terrifying. But I had my 6 year old brother beside me... And my mum \nand dad. So he had pissed himself and our dad and mum were trying to get my \nbrother away, but me being me I went straight in the open door, where a \nmascot just stood and stared at me, I backed away and it moved its hand to \nthe door to close it so I ran out and to my mum (keep in mind I was 8) and \ntold her that the animatronic had tried to close the door on me. But what \nstill scares me to this day is the mouse, which had blood on its finger, I \nstill think it was a back up of one, but it had blood. Unlike freddy \nfazbears pizzeria (ive been there too, and yes it's real) chuckee cheese \nhad no records,of death or murder or even injury (other than once where a \nkid got trapped in an animatronics arm) in it. So blood?! I know it wasn't \noil or juice because this one was brand new, no other marks or stuff, plus \nit still had tags on. Should I be worried that the mascot was also in my \nschool randomly? It actually scared me to death when that happened since I \nlive 14 hours(via airplane) away from the chuckee cheese. Even the head \nteacher was confused and all the teachers were too. But the next time I \nwent to school it was gone. It was like FNAF, all I need now is a couple of \nshitty doors with lights and a tablet to check places in my house. XD\ufeff",

I was up late at \nnight playing video games like I normally do with my light on in my room \nbut my door closed.  My sister comes in my room freaked out and said that \nshe went downstairs to use the bathroom and saw what she thought was our \nmom in the bathroom, I assume the lights were off maybe a night light or \nsomething on.  She went into our parents room and saw our mom sleeping in \nbed and she ran upstairs to tell me about it.  I don't remember if I went \ndownstairs or not to check, I think she just stayed in my room for a while \nto calm down.\n\nThe other story happened to me.  My sister and I were downstairs in our \nliving room.  She was sitting/laying on the couch and she was watching that \nChuckie movie I believe.  This was late at night, and I was sitting on a \nchair in the corner of the room, to my left was a window that was open with \na screen in, but drapes covering the window.  The lights in the room were \non, and it wasn't too late, just dark outside.  The channel was switched to \na commercial at the time, and I hear breathing outside of the window.  I \nsimply froze in place scared to react in any way.  After a while of hearing \nthe breathing it eventually stopped.  I waited a little bit longer, and \njust stood up without any word and walked into my parents room.  I told \nthem what I heard, and they didn't really seem to care.  After that, I just \nwent upstairs into my room.\n\nI have no idea what it could have been, and like I said, the TV was on \ncommercials, so it's not like I could have heard the movie.  Besides, the \nmovie wasn't scary, I was just looking at my phone or something at the \ntime, I don't quite remember.\ufeff",

Sometimes you can actually zone out from the external \nstimuli enough that the only things you're paying attention to are what's \nin your mind; and sometimes your own breathing will interrupt that train of \nthought yet you were so gone that you didn't even notice it was your own \nbreathing. Any noises we make sound much louder to ourselves than to the \nworld around us since the noise reverberates in our own bodies.\n\nWho knows though; I've experienced the sound of breathing and various other \nsounds that I swore weren't me and nobody else was around. But then I try \nto recreate the sound and realize it was me, I just wasn't aware of my \nsurroundings enough due to listening to music or having earplugs/earbuds \nin, etc. As you said though the other explanation could've been that \nsomebody was actually outside your window which is creepy. It could've been \nan animal too though. Depending on where you live though... At my house it \nwould only likely be a raccoon, skunk or some other vermin. There have been \ncases of deer or other wildlife going through people's yards around here \nthough. At my old house that would happen at least once a year! And that \nwas in the city too. The outskirts, but still in far enough that it was \nquite surprising. \n\nI always try as hard as possible to rule out literally every single \npossibility before resorting to the paranormal theory though. However I \nalso realized you didn't necessarily say it was paranormal so sorry for \nassuming you thought it was a ghost.\n\nI really wish there wasn't such a massive amount of people who just want \nfame and fortune though and use paranormal hoaxes to do it... It's a study \nwhere I don't believe any of the videos, audio or anything anymore because \n99.99% of it is people either hoaxing people; or people who are so insanely \ngullible that they will post the absolute most ridiculous stuff claiming it \nto be 'paranormal' yet it's a fricken TV in the background... Since my Mom \ndied when I was 5 it's certainly a study I've always been interested in as \nthere have been at least a few times where I still can't explain what it \nwas that happened or how it happened. But most of the times the sounds and \nthings we see out of the corner of our eyes are just our minds playing \ntricks on us and it's unfortunate that people can't differentiate between \nthe two.\n\nWow... I typed WAYYYYY too much! Anyways, have a good day. ",

Take schizophrenia, for example, it is partially \ncaused by oversized ventricles, which created randomly firing neurons. \nOther causes can happen as well, like drugs causing randomly firing neurons.",

And who's to say that the \nlaws of physics we came up with to explain everything on earth or in our \nsolar system is correct for all things? That second part is a bit meh \nthough, sorry.\n2. Do you believe in Mental Disorders? There is alot of debate about the \nDSM books (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is \nactually mostly rubbish. It has been speculated that because we cannot \nbiologically give evidence for mental disorders, that alot of the \n\"disorders\" in the book are just there so that pharmacists and \npsychiatrists can diagnose people with a mental disorder because there are \nso many of them now, just so pharmacists can recommend them drugs that they \nwill buy. This is a major problem in the US, where healthcare isn't free \nand companies are fighting to make money off drugs and pills. You see what \ni mean? There is no biological evidence for mental disorders, but still the \nmajority of people (i'm guessing including you) including me believe they \nexist. I have experienced someone with a mental disorder first hand, but \nyou wont consider that as evidence, will you? Checkmate xD jk",

Ok so when I was 5 by the way I'm 14 now, I \nwould sleep with my door open because my parents would watch tv and there \nwould be light. I don't like to sleep I'm sure some of you might say the \nsame. Anyway they'd close the door because they would smoke \ncigarettes(thanks auto-correct) and they don't want that in my body. Well \nthis time they didn't close the door and they went upstairs to where \nthey're room. Lights off, I would always have scary thoughts in other words \nI was afraid of the dark. Still kinda am now but ye. I just stared into my \nhallway and I swear to god a fucking face just is there. Top of my tv \nthingy/shelf. So the face has just a big smile I didn't see the color of \n\"its\" face but in the dark it was gray. As well as when showed up it was a \nblank face then it just smiled. See it almost as Jeff the Killers smile but \nit was just a different face. I can't explain it. If you could see my \nthoughts in pictures then you'd know. So I was the face and I was scared as \nshit then it just disappeared and I was asleep. I think I was asleep, I \ndon't remember things like that but that person/it/face just scared my \nmind. Anyone else see what I'm talking about that isn't going to lie? \ufeff",

                "text": "I'm not one to believe in scary stories and voodoo magic/spells etc, but my \nnext door neighbour, an old italian lady that lives by herself, is really \nstrange. When I bought my old house 3 years ago, all the neighbours kept \ntelling me she was really mean and the 1st week I moved here I figured this \nout for myself when she called the cops because I was renovating my house \nwhich makes  lots of noise with the hammering and all that. Ever since then \nI've had problems with her and ever since this incident, I feel as though \nthings at my house were getting weird and my neighbour was acting really \nweird. One day I was sitting out on the patio with my dog in the yard. My \ndog started to bark and bark and when my neighbour came out of the house, \nthe dog immediately stopped barking, turned to her, tucked his tail between \nhis legs and slowly came to the door, while looking at my neighbour the \nentire time, almost as if my dog were scared of her. A couple of days \nlater, I noticed the same thing. My dog started to bark, she came outside, \nand the dog again stopped and slowly approached the house, tail between \nlegs only this time my neighbour had a camera and had taken a picture of my \ndog. I went outside to protest, as she had no right to take pictures like \nthat but she went inside before I could say anything. Over the next few \ndays my dog seemed really nervous, refusing to go into the back yard at \nall. I would wake up at 2 or 3am and hear him walking around the house, \nclawing at the front door, the bathroom door etc, something he had never \ndone before. About a week passed by and my dog was still exhibiting these \nsymptoms so I took him to the vet who said he was probably adapting to the \nchange since we recently moved there and the vet said that my neighbour had \nprobably yelled at my dog at some point so my dog was afraid of her. My dog \nstarted acting even stranger, growling when I approached him, refusing to \neat and I would hear him more and more frequently at night. 2 days later, I \nwoke up to find my dog dead in the living room. The vet said that the dog \nhad died of \"unknown causes\", no pathogens were found, no poisoning, \nnothing. I did not assume my neighbour had anything to do with it and I had \nno idea what happened, hell even the vet didn't know. My dog was 4 years \nold at the time. About a week later, I noticed there was an awful smell \nevery time I went outside, really awful like something was decaying. Even \nmy other neighbours said they could smell it and I noticed my neighbour had \nhung up a cage on her patio. Upon closer examination, I saw that there was \na dead crow inside the cage and the smell was probably coming from there, \nbut the crow was DECAPITATED with its feet tied together. Its head was \nliterally disconnected from its body. Over the next while, things got even \nweirder. My other neighbour, who had a 6 year old pet cat , said his cat \nhad died a few days before and he says that my neighbour that had taken a \npicture of my dog, had also taken a picture of my other neighbour's cat \ndays before it died. The cat acted weird, refused to eat, and the vet said \ncause of death was unknown. This shocked me as I began to wonder what the \nhell was happening. I didnt believe by taking a picture of something it \ncould die. I filed a police report, explaining the cat, dog and the crow I \nsaw on the patio in the cage. The police talked to her but there was no \nevidence to prove she had done anything. She must have suspected that I had \ncalled the police because every time I went outside I would see her on the \npatio, sitting in a lawn chair and staring at me, then quickly looking \naway. Literally EVERY time I looked up, I would catch her staring at me, \nthen looking away quickly. Every time I went to the car I would see her \nstaring at me from inside her house and eventually I got pissed and gave \nher the finger when I saw her staring at me like that( I know it was \nimmature but I was getting pissed off and creeped out). One time when my \ndad came to visit, he went outside on the patio for a smoke and I heard \nyelling outside. He was arguing with my neighbour because my neighbour had \nbeen apparently taking pictures of him. I immediately called the police and \nthey came and talked to her for about 30min and told me that they had \nconfiscated the camera and erased the photograph of my dad. I explained \nthat I felt unsafe and that I was being stalked but since she was an \nelderly lady (probably 70+ years), the police kind of just dismissed it and \nsaid they would talk to her about it and \"investigate further\". After that, \nthere was this one time I opened the blinds of a window that directly faced \na window in her house and jumped back as I saw her staring through her \nwindow into my house. I was not that scared at the time as much as I was \nangry that I was being stalked and the police were doing nothing about it. \nAbout a month or 2 later, I got a call from my dad who said he had been \ndiagnosed with terminal lung cancer. This was really a shock to me and I \nwas deeply depressed. I then remembered about how my neighbour had taken a \npicture of my dog, who died shortly after, my dad, who passed away shortly \nafter, and then the other neighbours cat, who died shortly after. I started \nto get a little scared as it seemed like more than just a coincidence. My \nfriend came over and I told him about the weird things that were happening \nbut he believed it was just a really really strange coincidence. That \nnight, as my friend was driving home, he crashed his car in a bad accident \nand was in critical condition. I visited him in the hospital and he was \nunconscious and had a breathing tube, they odds were terribly against him \nhowever, he did remarkably recover a few days later and I was beyond \ngrateful. He recalled that as he was pulling out of my driveway, he had \nseen my neighbour staring at him through her window with a scary stern look \non her face, possibly assuming it was me as it was dark and hard to tell \nwho was in the car. he also noted that as he drove off, he noticed a flash \nof light coming from the window. That was when it hit me, the flash was the \nflash of my neighbours camera. She had probably thought it was me behind \nthat wheel and she wanted me dead. I came back home and was beyond scared \nto go outside again. This was all too weird to be a simple coincidence. I \ndidnt know if I should call the police, because there was no evidence. They \nwould just talk to her again which would probably only further piss her off \nfurther and she would do more terrible things to me.I became really \ncautious when going outside and I soon discovered from other neighbours \nthat many years ago  she used to live with her husband but the husband \ndivorced her and a few months afterwards he died in what was disclosed as a \nsuicide. He had apparently gone insane and eventually was admitted to a \nmental facility where he killed himself. They also told me that the \nprevious family that lived in the house I was living in had problems with \nher too as they would constantly argue back and forth. The mother had a \nbaby which died a few days after the mother came back home from the \nhospital with the baby. The mother was so distressed, she went delusional \nand the family moved out of the city. The neighbours that were telling me \nthis were all suspicious that she had something to do with these weird \nhappenings. They also said that when kids go trick or treating, sometimes \nthey would come to her house and she would yell at them, chasing them out \nof her property, yelling and cursing at them. They also said that they just \nignore her and so they believe that's why she hasn't done anything to them. \nEventually I was too creeped out by all this and decided to sell my house \nand move as far away from there as I could. I had lived at the house for \njust under a year and I was out of there. It has been 3 years since I moved \nout, and since then I have never had any of these weird things happening \nanymore and thank GOD I moved out before shit got even crazier. Who knows \nwhat might have happened if I had stayed.        \ufeff",

So as I sat there I noticed that \nthe ceiling was getting slightly brighter, then back to pitch black, and \nrepeating that pattern. So I sat up to see over the bed and then I saw a \nvery bright figure. It was an angelic sort of white, and it was very large, \nand blurry. A good reference would be to say it was like seeing Baymax (Big \nHero 6) outside my door, but blurry and hard to see any defining features. \nAll you could tell is that it was humanoid. After seeing it I wasn't \nscared, just unsettled, so I went back to bed and just tried to ignore it. \nWhen I woke up a few hours later, it was gone.\ufeff",

At about 3:00, i woke up at about the part \nwhere Dorothy goes into the tornado. Instead of the witch flying around \nthere was a faint image of a skull in a hood. Then the screen faded to \nblack. It then changed to a surveillance-like feed from the attic to show a \ncloaked figure emerging from a brick wall and the screen followed it as it \nproceeded to WALK DOWN THE STAIRS AND LURK RIGHT TO THE CLOSED LIVING ROOM \nDOOR WHERE I WAS WATCHING IT ALL HAPPEN. It then stared at the closed door \nfor a few moments and then turned towards where the screen was watching it \nand stared at me through the tv. Suddenly, its eyes set themselves on fire \nand it screamed\"HE WILL ABANDON YOU! YOUR CREATOR WILL ABANDON YOU AS HE \nDID ME!!\" It vanished, i thought i was safe, then the door violently flew \nopen even though nothing was there. Then the wizard of oz returned to the \ntv. Except for one thing, it cut to when dorothy was wishing to go home. \nCreepy, right?\ufeff",

Once when I was 14 years old I was babysitting my \n3 younger brothers while mom was at choir practice at night I was watching \ntv while my brothers were playing basketball in the driveway I heard a very \ndistinct growl and my tv went static white. No more than 10 seconds later \nmy brothers came in scared almost to death and said they'd heard the same \nand had also seen a horned humanoid creature in our tree outside . We \ndecided to call mom and she didn't believe us but that night she said she \nhad heard the same unearthly growl. The creature never showed his face \nafter that night.\ufeff",

I don't now what you call it were you're from but I \nlive in a couldysack (a small street basically) but we have a tree growing \nfrom the elotments at the end of our strret but its about the same size of \nthe street lamp. There are 9 houses in the street and on the 17th of \nNovember 2013 (im 14) ( born 2000) we were having power cuts very \nfrequently (we never have power cuts) so we were all puzzled and one time \neverything shut of at like 7pm (during winter it gets dark early) so it was \npitch black. But me and my younger brother and sister my mum and dad went \nout and my next door neighbour Simon and tulisa and the people opposite \nhannah, elisa came out and we were like yours out? And everyone's was in \nthe area. But we seen movement in the tree where the generator is and we \nwere puzzled. Amediatly we thought either a squirrel or birds. And we put \nthe pieces together and it was obvious that they were the cause of the \npower cuts. But whatever the thing was it was moving alot. Like rapid \nshaking of the tree branch, so we started trying to get the things \nattention and it had none of it. My dad went to get a ladder to climb the \ntree. We all tried to stop him because we were scared. As you would be. So \nwe were throwing things and nothing happened the suddenly we heard a \ngrowl/screech and everything csme back on. Around about 30 minutes later we \nwere watching x factor and the tv went static like you said in your story \nand we heard the same noise so we ran outside and there was a thing ontop \nof the generator and my dad went over and it jumped at him and started to \nran towards us but dashed left (to the alotments) and that was it no more \npower cuts and didn't see that 'thing' again. It looked like a monkey \nwithout fur but slimey and slightly transparent and was what seemed to be \nfloating a bit. I don't expect you to believe me but I'm being deadly \nhonest but oh well I felt the need to share my experience.",

I toss and \nturn in my bed, trying to find a comfortable spot, but I feel uneasy. \nSomething about tonight just didn\u2019t feel right. I toss and turn until I \nfinally find a comfortable position.\nI close my eyes, but it doesn\u2019t make a difference, it\u2019s too dark in my room \nto see a thing anyways. I guess it takes time for my eyes to adjust to \ndarkness. I lay there, still and silent on a dark and dank night. My body \nis relaxed, my mind is blank, and I\u2019m ready for some much needed rest. \nInstantly, the silence is shattered and my mind fills with fearful thoughts \nas my startled eyes flash open.\nKnock. Knock.\nIt\u2019s almost undoubtedly the sound of a fist on glass. But no, it couldn\u2019t \nbe, what would someone\u2019s motivation be to wake someone alone in their home? \nThink logically. If someone wanted to break in, why would they warn me with \na knock? They would just break in, making a loud and obvious noise, or try \nto be as silent as possible. Why would they knock?\nMonsters don\u2019t exist. I could give myself some peace of mind and simply \nlook out the window, but I\u2019m facing the other way and I\u2019m too timid to turn \nmy head, afraid of finding my greatest fears standing outside my window. \nWhat could it be though? Maybe a couple of birds flew into my window. No, \nthat\u2019s too unrealistic. Could a group of kids be running around late at \nnight, knocking on windows to get a few laughs? It\u2019s a possibility. Come to \nthink of it, maybe it was my imagination. Maybe I heard the usual creak in \nthe house and my paranoid mind has mistaken it for a knock.\nKnock. Knock.\nNope, that definitely wasn\u2019t my imagination. Those damn kids are \npersistent. They don\u2019t want to quit until they get that reaction. Maybe \nsome sick twisted freak is standing outside waiting for me to look so he \ncan smash through and attack me. No, don\u2019t think that. Don\u2019t get paranoid. \nBesides, he\u2019s outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe. \nMonsters don\u2019t exist. Besides, I haven\u2019t moved yet, hopefully those kids \nwill think I\u2019m a heavy sleeper and leave me alone.\nKnock Knock.\nNo, it can\u2019t be kids. No kid would wait around this long just to get a \nreaction from one, lonely guy; they\u2019d just get bored and move along. But, \nwhat could it be? Why would a serial killer target me, of all people? Think \nlogically. Monsters don\u2019t exist. Don\u2019t get paranoid. They\u2019re outside, I\u2019m \ninside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe. But if it\u2019s not a monster \nor some sort of killer, what could it be? Just pretend to be asleep and \nmaybe they\u2019ll go away.\nKnock. Knock.\nOh God I can\u2019t think of a noise I hate more than that persistent knock! \nPlease go away! Just leave me alone and let me be! There\u2019s no hope. It\u2019s \ngoing to get in here and do sick and horrible things to me. Inhale. Take \ndeep breaths. I can feel my heart pound out of my chest just relax.\nMonsters don\u2019t exist. Remember, they\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a \nshatter I know I\u2019m safe. Repeat that. Don\u2019t let your fear get the best of \nyou. Just pretend to be asleep. Don\u2019t move a muscle.\nKnock. Knock.\nThey\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe. \nMonsters don\u2019t exist. Just pretend to be asleep and pray it\u2019ll go away.\nKnock. Knock.\nThey\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe. \nFrightful tears begin to drip down my face. Monsters don\u2019t exist. Monsters \ndo not exist. I begin to whisper to myself,\n\u201cThey\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe. \nThey\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe.\u201d\nKnock. Knock.\nI can't take it anymore! I\u2019m gonna go mad listening to these knocks! At \nleast if I see what it is I\u2019ll have peace of mind! Take a deep breath. I \nrepeat to myself, one more time,\n\u201cThey\u2019re outside, I\u2019m inside, until I hear a shatter, I know I\u2019m safe.\u201d\nI take a few more breaths, my heart pounding as hard as it\u2019s ever pounded \nat a mile a minute. I slowly turn my head to face the window.\nMy heart sinks into my chest and I\u2019m too afraid to scream or move. I turned \nmy head to find a pale figure with beady, black eyes staring through me and \ninto my soul as a horrid grin creeps across its face. It was standing \ninside the whole time, knocking on my window.\n\nyour move now",

One day when me and my mom \nwere in the kitchen (she was making me breckfast and i was sitting at the \ncounter.) she was at the toaster and our counter is right by the stove. One \nof the spoons used for making eggs fell off the stove. The spoon was NO \nWHERE near the edge when it fell. We thought nothing of it and went about \nthe day. Later that evening me my dad and my mom were all sitting down to \neat when we hear something fall, So I went back to the kitchen to check it \nout. When I got there the SAME spoon was lying in the same stop it had \nfallen in before (THAT SAME SPOON HAD ALSO BEEN IN THE DISHWASHER 15 \nminuets earlier!) At this point we were all scared, then our dog started \nbarking at the kitchen counter for no reason. Ever sence then strange thing \nhave happened in the house and every night while im in my room I hear \nnoises like someone is walking in my room...\ufeff",

Mainly because \nthey would either diagnose him as crazy or simply blow the issue off as a \nhallucination caused by hormones or paranoia.\n+Craig Haynes There are some explanations that can help bring to light to \nthe issue at hand.  One is that this \"ghost\" may be either an angel/ light \nentity, or it can be a dark/ evil entity.  If the presence of this ghost is \ncomforting or you feel peace when this figure is around, it quite possibly \nis a light entity/ angel.  If it is an angel or good spirit, it could be \naround for reasons unknown, but it will most definitely be there with good \nintentions; like protecting you and loved ones.\nHowever, if the presence makes you feel drained, horrible, degrading, or \nmakes the room fell cold, then the chances of it being evil are quite high. \n Here are a few of sites/ articles that can help both elaborate the \nsituations and can help inform you about the evil ones.  (Copy and paste \nthe web addresses to find out more.)\nhttp://tamron.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Deal-with-Evil-Spirits\nhttp://freefall3012.hubpages.com/hub/Do-you-know-the-difference-between-an-evil-spirit-and-a-demon\n(There are four parts of this next one.)  \nhttp://www.born-again-christian.info/demons.htm\n\nNow, they are a long read, but they are worth it.  I hate to sound \nreligious, but if you really feel threatened by the presence, you may have \nto pray to God for help and guidance.  Remember, it is entirely your \nchoice.  I do not have all of the answers and solutions, but I will still \nbe willing in sharing advice if you need it.",

That's not even the bad part. During this, you \noften have illusions.

Sometimes it is brief, sometimes it \ngoes on for minutes. I've had this a few times myself. Once, I awoke to see \na dark shadowy woman sitting on my bedside watching me. Another time, I saw \nscattered dots through the air like a hornets nest was in my room! Usually \nthough, I just saw random terrifying faces for just a second or so. It made \nme afraid to sleep! I don't get it so much now though, fortunately. ;-;\ufeff",

God \nis positive...demons, the devil negative.  It's all energy...the entire \nuniverse is made of forms of energy.  I've faced this stuff many times in \nmy dreams but through God and Jesus Christ I became bold as fuck...in \ndreams and in a few cases of sleep paralysis I've dealt with stuff that \ngives me chills thinking about it...but I trust in the power of God and He \nis my strength.  Don't be afraid...the bible is not a fairy tale.  Jesus \nChrist warns man about the spirit world that we are constantly assaulted \nby...trust in God...call on God for help.  Real talk, in sickness and in \nhealth...when you are awake and when you are asleep.  If it helps think of \nit like on a Star Wars level...the devil and his minions are Sith...God, \nhis angels, Jesus, his followers are Jedi.  Don't fear the darkside...know \nwhy it exists...they exist to seduce you to their side and then destroy \nyour soul.  Everyone who is seduced to the dark side is destroyed and \nultimately tormented in hell for the devil's amusement...broken and lost.  \nIn heaven you receive your eternal form...just like the Jedi's soul were in \nthe movie and as it says in the Bible.  There is truth to some of the \nfiction we see in our lives.  Reality is very complex but most people \nchoose not to believe and walk around asleep and lost in the fog, the \nmatrix...hoping that by keeping their heads in the sand they can ignore the \nreal stuff going on...but I warn you...THE OSTRICH MAY BURY IT'S HEAD IN \nTHE SAND BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THAT LEOPARD FROM DEVOURING IT'S BODY.",

It can be scary but your fear of God should be the only real \nfear you have, fear and reverence that God will not leave your \nside...because if He did...you would have to deal with \nthose entities...that is what Hell is...the absence of help from God...you \nare trapped in darkness and at the torment of those entities.  The spirit \nworld exists but trust in Jesus Christ...trust in God.

Energy is \ntransferred...we are energetic souls living in human bodies...when we die \nsome are transferred to different places...heaven, hell, limbo...I'm not \nentirely sure but that's what is happening.  I've had sleep paralysis where \nnothing happened and I've had rare moments where I've seen things.

But I know they're real, because I've had a number of ghost \nexperiences that could not be explained as a trick of the eye. So have many \nof my friends and relatives. I believe them and trust their judgment \nbecause I know them to be sane and they would never lie to me. So while I \ncan understand people not believing the stories of a stranger, when it's \nyour own spouse, or mom, or best friend that tells you, you do believe \nthem. And whether I believed anyone else's experience or not, I know that \nmy experiences were 100% real, so that's all I need to believe in ghosts. \n\nAs for NDE's, there are many examples of them that cannot be explained as \nimagination, lies, or tricks of the brain. For example, a common occurrence \nin NDE's is that the person is able to observe their body from a point \noutside the body. After being brought back to life, they are able to \nrecount, in perfect detail, what happened while they were dead. This was at \na time when their body had no heartbeat and no respiration, and this is \noften verified by medical equipment because many of them were in the \nhospital at the time. They not only recount the sounds, but the VISUALS. \nAnd their eyes were obviously closed at the time. No skeptic has been able \nto come up with a plausible explanation for that. The theories that they've \ncome up with don't explain that scenario. ",

I laid in bed for several minute just \ntrying to go to sleep and I was tossing and turning. I got a little annoyed \nso I went to go sit up and I saw a dark figure sitting across from me that \nlooked about my size. Naturally I pulled the covers over my head and curled \nup into a ball keeping my breathing to a minimum, hoping that if it was an \nintruder, they didn't notice me. I must have stayed under those covers for \nabout what felt like an hour. Then of course me being the stupid slightly \ncurious kid I was, I lifted the foot part of my sheet to see the person was \nstill there. They never moved. I called out my older brother's name, \nthinking it was him but no one response. I hid under my sheet again till I \nsome how fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, no one was there. I \nactually want to assume that it was my twin since I had an incident when I \nwas born called a Vanishing Twin. This is all completely 100% true even \nthough people are going to say this is bullshit.\ufeff",

One day while riding the third \nbus, I noticed this guy, who looked super high and was wearing baggy \nclothes, staring at me. Eventually he asked me if I was from this part of \ntown and I responded no. Then he went on talking to some other guy in the \nseat behind him. At one point he got up and went to the back of the bus and \nI heard the door open and thought he was leaving. I turned around to find \nhim still there, staring at me again. I tried to ignore him the best I \ncould until one point where he was in the seat behind me (I didn't notice \nhim move) He leaned in and started talking to me, his breathe was on my \nneck. He whispered, \"Don't jump I just want to talk to you. Riding the bus \nis bullshit. If you don't feel safe, I'll pay for you to get on a train \nwith me.\" I thought about hopping off the bus and running to the nearest \npolice station, but feared he would hurt me so I calmly (my voice was \nshaking a little) replied with a fake smile, \"That's not necessary, I feel \nsafe on this bus. But thanks for your concern.\" I think I pissed him off, \nbut after that he left the bus. I never saw that guy again.\ufeff",

He's a good guy who lives \nin my neighborhood who is just a few days younger than me and plays tennis. \nHe asks me and his sister to help him practice, so we take a walk to the \nlocal tennis courts. The courts are close to the neighborhood, just behind \nthe school and near the opening of the woods. (Yes our school is built \nclose to the woods.) We practice in the courts, serving and tossing to \nZach, and he hits one over the fence. I decide to go and get it, since I'm \noldest and a lot less scared of the woods. I open the gate and set off to \nfind the ball. After a minute, I see the tennis ball and bend over to pick \nit up, right after a grab it, I hear the hiss of a snake. I stand upright \nand look around, I thought it was normal since Zach's dad said there were \nsnakes there, so I decided to shake it off. I head back to the courts, but \nbefore I get back to the other two, I hear someone whisper, \"Watch for the \nanimals, you'll get hurt like the others.\" I pause and look around, just to \nbe sure I really heard it because I have a really overactive imagination, \nand out of the corner of my eye, I see someone. I didn't get a good look at \nhim, but I focused on what he was doing. He looked straight at me with he's \nfinger to his lips like he was telling me to be quiet. I start to panic and \nrush back to Zach and in the courts. He asks me what was wrong, and I told \nhim what I saw. He says that it's weird and I should be careful. I ask him \nwhere his sister is and he said she went into the woods too because he lost \nanother ball. I yell at him for letting her go by herself, but I hear her \nscreaming and it's getting louder. She rushes toward us an into the court \nand tells us what happened. She said she saw the exact thing I saw, a man \nwith his finger to his lips by a tree. I immediately tell them we should go \nhome, using the setting sun as an excuse. I never told either of them I saw \nhim too.\ufeff",

You need God and need \nhim bad. I'm going to pray for you. Why do you want to even be a troll? You \ncould be doing something counteractive with your life. But no, you would \nrather be a big piece of shit. Don't tell me I'm hypocritical about God and \ncalling you a piece of shit. I'll don't like you but I still hope the best \nfor you. I tell you off to show you how much an insult can hurt. Your going \nto probably tell me that it doesn't matter that I care for you but I still \ndon't care. I wont find out, because I'm going to be the bigger person and \nignore it. I hope you don't reply to this one, for the sake of yourself and \nyour family. That would only prove that your almost as evil as the KKK. \nThat's right I said the KKK. It isn't even that what you say is rude, it's \nthat it's so funny I don't think I can stop laugh at it. Go to church as I \nsaid while you still can. I was a bully as a kid like you are now, and than \nI found God and he changed my life for the better. He can for you too. But \nI'm not going to end it about God. You want to talk trash so I'll give you \nsome trash. I bet you're only a High School kid trying to be an adult. \nProbably no one would go out with you so you take your anger out on the \nworld. I bet you only came on this site looking for a story you didn't \nbelieve so you could be a troll about it.",

And I absolutely loved her.\nOne day, when I was six, I was over at their house, and straight away I \nwent to the living room to play with her. She came right up to me, but she \nlooked a little sad, giving a sort of half hearted bark and rubbing her \nhead against my leg like a cat, something she did when she was upset. So, \nnaturally, I decided she wanted food, and so I went to give her something \nto eat. I couldn't find her bowl, so I used a plate from the cupboard and \nfed her. No problem. I then played with her for a little but, until my \ngranny came in the room. She asked me what I was doing, and I said I was \nplaying with Cassie, but I don't think she was listening as she said that \nshe had something important to tell me. She then said that Cassie had died \nthe night before (from old age) I then looked at her, confused before \ntelling her \" No she's not, she's right there\" \nThen, I turned around to show her that Cassie was behind me, but she wasn't \nthere. I looked for ages and ages before granny told me to stop.\nI still remember that, and I'm not sure if you would count it as the same \nthing, but I thought I'd share this with you anyway.",

My mum came in to close the window so I wouldn't get wet (as she \nalways did when it's rain because I would sleep through it) and she started \nscreaming and I woke up and saw a woman who looked exactly like my mum \nsitting on the side of my bed stroking my hair and she turned and looked at \nmy mum and then vanished. \n\nWhen I was about 12 I was having a sleepover with my best friend and \nwatching scary movies. We went out into the kitchen to get more snacks and \nheard a woman who sounded exactly like my mum scream, \"Sophie, Don't do it. \nPlease.\" I ran up to my mums room and she was asleep. me and my best friend \nboth heard her and were really freaked out.\n\nAnd Lastly, every time I loose something my mum is the only person who can \nfind it. She was on vacation with my dad a few moths ago and I was home \nalone. I lost my favourite necklace, 18ct Gold with blue topaz pendant and \ndiamonds on a gold chain. I ALWAYS wear this necklace. I took it off to \ntake a bath and when I looked on the counter after it was gone. I started \nto panic and was looking for it everywhere. I looked on my desk and I saw \nsomething drop from the sky and land on my desk. It was my necklace. I \nheard a voice after that say, \"Here you are, sweetie.\" This is so creepy \nhas anyone heard of a ghost that can mimic a person before? This is only a \nfew of the times this has happened too.\ufeff",

It's a bad argument.  It's something you run into quite a bit when \ndealing with Fundamentalist Christians.  Then, in your second post, your \nfirst sentence states, \"I have seen and been apart [sic] of sum [sic] \nstrange things can I prove it of course not but it happend [sic] to me.\" \n By this statement... you are claiming that because you experience \nsomething personally... that is proof enough... and you shouldn't have to \nprovide evidence to back up your claim.

I to have had so much stuff happened to me over the span of my \nlife, things I have clearly heard, seen or experienced with my eyes, that I \nwill never be able to prove or logically explain. that's the way life is. I \ndon't try to make people believe in my experiences, plus I'm not religious, \nI'm spiritual so I'm open minded but I don't go claiming anything is real \nas I cannot explain these experience, so I cannot say just because I've \nseen ghosts that ghosts actually exist. You on the other hand say you can \nprove it, you cannot, sorry to tell you but you don't have any validity to \nanything you have witnessed, these things are only valid to you, just the \nsame with myself. Furthermore ghost adventures is a media show that makes \nthese shows for money, allow a few of there findings are strange and could \nvery well be real, there is lot of stuff that will be faked. What if you go \nto a supposed haunted locations, you maybe see something that night clearly \nbut you weren't filming and the rest of the night nothing happens, you are \na TV show after all and this is costing you money and gaining you no \nincome, so of course you are going to fake some stuff to make it more \ninteresting for the viewer and gather potential new viewers into your show. \nThat's how the media industry and any kind of entertainment works, the \nsooner you realise this and stop making ridiculous claims, the better for \nyourself.

Then later on she was with my younger \nsister and they were talking about her ex-boyfriend and the 8 ball gave \nrandom answers - so then she joked about it being haunted. So then she \nstarted asking questions and it replied with a reasonable answer, the \nreally creepy thing which got them to be scared was the fact that they \nasked \"Can you send us a sign that you're here?\" and then they heard \ntapping on the wall then here are some things we asked it\n\nAre you going to hurt us? - No\n\nAre you a nice ghost? - Yes\n\nDo you hate boys? - No\n\nHow did you die? - [BLANK] (Meaning the pyramid answer thing landed on a \ncorner)\n\nWere you murdered? - Yes\n\nDid a boy kill you? - No\n\nDid a family member kill you? - Yes\n\nAre you here in this room with us? - No\n\nAre you in the house? - Yes\n\nAre you in a room in the house? - Yes\n\nAre you in a boys room? - Yes\n\nAre you in the downstairs boys room? - No\n\nAre you in the upstairs boys room? - Yes (Which happens to be mine ;-;)\n\nWere you killed recently? - No\n\nWere you killed a long time ago? - Yes\n\nAre you old? - No\n\nAre you young? - Yes\n\nAre you a boy? - No\n\nAre you a girl? - Yes\n\nThen she started asking it questions and it gave responses like \"Ask me \nlater\" and \"I can't answer right now\" and then after she kept asking \nquestions the 8 ball didn't answer.

I closed my eyes and \nopened them and it was gone. I walked into my room seeing my sister asleep. \nI walked over to my bed then fell asleep. At 12:00 I heard something while \nI was sleeping so I tried to wake up but I couldn't it felt like I was \nstuck asleep and then I woke up seeing very blurry I couldn't see then I \nsaw a girl in the hall way at night the lights where on and it was just \nsitting in the light.

Earlier \nthat day I saw a strange out of place man in black robes, almost as if he \nwas a cardinal, fully dressed, shoes and all walking down the beach. Ok so \nthat night walking back to the camp sight a noticed a strange hooded \nfigure, with white face and hands, walking down the beach 50 yards from us. \nWhen we stopped, it stopped, always keeping the same distance, when ever we \nstopped it walked into the word, over the rocky shore quiclky and smoothly, \nthen back up to the sand. He just kept following us, no matter how fast we \nwent he kept the same distance... The strange thing was what we found out \nside our camp site the next day, a doll dressed the same as what ever we \nsaw that last night. A little girl dressed in a blue dress skipped over, \npicked up the doll, and simply said \"Oh I'm sorry to intrude, he just has \nan interest in you, may I have him back\". Ok so we were pretty freaked out \nright? So every day the same doll always showed up there, finally the last \nnight I and my girl friend stayed out and looked for teens who could have \nbeen pranking us, we only heard shuffling and then saw the doll in the same \nplace.\n\nTo this day I am still not sure what that thing was, or who that creepy \nlittle girls is, only that it was really wierd.\ufeff",

When I \nscreamed they opened the door but saw nothing since it disappeared. Next \ntime that I was put in there it climbed the stairs and tore a hole in a \nScooby-Doo shirt I was wearing before leaving. Another day I heard it \noutside so I hid under my table and all I saw when I peeked out from under \nthe table was it staring straight at me with an apathetic face. Finally the \nlast moment that I remember was when I was laying on my bed when I saw it \ncrawl across the floor and peek over at the bottom of my bed. In order to \nhelp me my mother said that it was her in a costume.. However she isn't \ntall, and she isn't skinny which as I recall was entirely her. Plus I was \nphysically hurt by it when it ripped my shirt, also I pushed it down the \nsteps by accident however it just walked away. However it is gone now, and \nI hope I never see it again. Also living in the same house.\ufeff",

At that point, you call the mother and ask if the girl is still asleep \nor not.\n13. \"When they call, you don't answer\" If I ever heard my child say that, I \nwould schedule a cleansing of my house.\n12. \"We are already dead\" That would scare the shit out of anyone.\n11. To keep people from dying, let them take the picture.\n10. Take a flashlight and a ball bat when investigating the back seat of \nyour car.\n9. That's a bad elevator.. it needs to be fixed. That picture looks more \nlike an asylum.. Thanks, I needed the chills.\n8. Screw threatening the intruder, stab the intruder in the hand or cut his \narm.. then yell.\n7. Put the house on sell or cleanse the house of all spirits.\n6. \"Are you in here\" Isn't that the same question you hear in all slasher \nflicks.. That intruder couldn't be more original.\n5. How about that, a knife can scare away a ghost. That's new..\n4. Pretty creepy room.. But how do you know you didn't let something out of \nthat room.\n3. That just made me feel dirty.\n2. Alien from Fire in the Sky is looking for a place to squat.\n1. The story wasn't bad, but that picture gave me so many chills.\nI'm now completely frightened, I haven't been this freaked out since I \nwatched Mama, and The Conjuring all in the same night.\ufeff",
