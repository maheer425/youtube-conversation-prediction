On \nJapanese channels 100y make up tutorials are pretty hilarious though, but \nsoaps, etc. contacting with skin could be irritating. Never buy scissors, \nnail clippers, etc. they'll all fall apart, towels aren't comfy either etc. \nA lot of stuff you can get from Muji with 100-200y more pricey, but winner \nquality. Wouldn't trust on bento boxes either. Instead: all wrapping, gift, \ncraft materials, daily necessities from q-tips to cleaning equipment, all \nseasonal and party products, all together everything you can't think of \ngetting quick and cheap anywhere else in the city. For Japanese learners, \nthere's lots of those empty notebooks for 50y where you can practise kanji \nwriting.\ufeff",
