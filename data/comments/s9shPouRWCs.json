When i think specific i think in \nEnglish due top the fact that English had more words specifying things \nmaking it easier to think fast and accurate.\nThis is reason why i end up using done English words even in my native \ntongue.\nThis is due to the fact i either remember the word in my language. Our the \nEnglish is more specific. As many words here are pronounced the same thus \nsometimes hard to get into context when trying to explain something.\n\nBut mainly my toughed wary.\n\nI usually think in English when I'm hanging out with English speaker like \non the internett or English speaking friends. And i think in my native \nlanguage when hanging out with family or work.\n\nYoy end up thinking in a foreign language when hanging out with foreigners. \nThis is so that you dont struggle speaking the other language fluent.\n\nThis is where i notice most people struggling speaking a new language is \nbecause they don't understand enough to stay having toughs in that \nlanguage. \nAnd thus they get strange vocabulary at times and struggles with \npronunciations. Also stuttering.\n\nThinking in that language helps you warm up before speaking it. This making \nyou're language more fluent\ufeff",

But I still retain the belief that language an important part of \ngrasping abstract concepts. \n\nDyslexic people (literally dyslexic means \"trouble with words\") are \nBRILLIANT people. But they often have disorganized thought patterns. This \ncan be an advantage but it also means that certain things are difficult for \nthem to grasp, especially when they are very young. Not only reading but \nunits of measurement and sometimes mathematics. Now without language at \nall.... We'd all be like that; no one would be able to figure out \narithmetic at all. And the cavemen, without words, were intelligent but \nthey lacked abstract thinking. \n\nSo perhaps language doesn't effect our intelligence but it certainly \neffects our ability to grasp abstract concepts and Helen, being without the \nmeans for any of that (and of course being frustrated and spoiled) become \nwild and uncouth.

Another would \nbe pidgin- where immigrants will have their own sort of version of the \narea's language, as in Mexican Spanish which is now completely offshoot \nfrom European Spanish. Another reason is globalisation, so for instance \ncamera in Japanese is 'Kamera' and escalator is 'eskurator' as these \ninventions are from the west the Japanese chose to keep their names and now \nuse a fair amount of Japanese-styled english (they also call bread 'pan' \nfrom the French  word 'pain'. ) Then there is modernisation, for example \n'gay' today often references homosexual men, and gay used to mean happy or \nhow today we say 'Go google it' when twenty odd years ago it was 'go look \nin a dictionary'.\n\nLanguage is a form of communication and it will constantly be mixed around \nand chopped and changed to what people need to express themselves. Go back \nor forward 2 centuries and even your own language would be \nbarely reckonisable (Chaucer's a pardoner's tale was like reading a \ndifferent language to me, as it was middle age English.)

Like I said though, you can reach a \ndecent conversational level in less than a year if you're learning the \nright way - and once you reach that point, your brain starts to process the \nlanguage in the same way as it processes native languages.  Thing is, \ngetting to that point takes regular practice, both listening and speaking, \nand for a large part of that time you kinda have to be willing to speak \nlike a child.  For example, I know a French guy who's lived in Britain for \ntwenty years and speaks English like a native.  His French, on the other \nhand, isn't nearly as good - when you stop practising a language, you start \nto lose your active vocabulary; even if it's the first language you learned.",

The two things many people get wrong are trying to learn how to read \nand write the language at the same time as learning to speak (you already \nhave a preconceived notion of how letters are supposed to sound, and if you \nstart reading too early, you adjust your pronunciation based on that), and \nwaiting for that mythical moment of \"fluency\" before they ever speak to \nanyone in that language.\n\nIf it takes longer than two years to become conversational in a language, \nit isn't that you're bad at languages (I would argue that nobody is, save \nfor those who can't talk at all), but instead you're going about it the \nwrong way (in the case of people learning in schools, this is probably \nbecause of the focus reading and writing, and the lack of conversational \npractice).\n\nOne good online Spanish course (they're better for Welsh, but their Spanish \ncourse is pretty good too) is at http://saysomethingin.com/spanish - it's \nrelatively inexpensive, and I guarantee that it'll improve your Spanish if \nyou're one of the many people who don't get the opportunity to practice \nspeaking (feel free to send me a private comment if you want a voucher for \nthe first ten lessons free).\n\nBeyond that, if you live somewhere where there are plenty of people who \nspeak Spanish, take the opportunity to practice.  If not, then next chance \nyou get to go on holiday, head to Spain or Mexico or the like (though not \nsomewhere touristy, because otherwise you'll probably run into people who \nonly speak Spanish...) and challenge yourself to only speak Spanish unless \nyou encounter someone who doesn't actually speak it.",

Prick!\"\n5. \"Looks Gangrenous\"\n6. \"Who cares, it never listens anyway.\"\n7. \"I can't remember it's name, seems awkward now, can you ask?\"\n\nAnd, my all time favourite:\n\nMe - \"How are your legs doing?\"\n\nDad - \"Which one?\"\n\nMe - \"Your bad one. Your right leg.\"\n\nDad - \"It's shit!\"\n\nMe - \"Err, That's not good, what's the problem? Does it hurt? Is it tired?\"\n\nDad - Hopping.\n\nMe - Err..\n\nDad - Hopping, does yours do it?\n\nMe - Umm, yeah, I suppose it does if I want it to...\n\nDad - See, mines fucked! Get me some tea while it's fixed!\n\nMe - \"...\" \n\n*Dad taps his leg, tilts his head and acts like he's listening for an echo*\n\nDad - \"You hear that? It's gunna take weeks to fix this!\"\n\nMe - \"Fine I'll get you some tea, you cheeky bald fucker! ;) \"\n\nDad -  \"Cheers Tim!
