I completely stopped eating, went from 172 pounds to 114 (I'm \n5'8'') and still struggle with my anorexia today and am still loosing \nweight.  I don't think i can list my insecurities because the list could go \non forever.  Thanks for the positive video Tyler, some day I wish to have \nyour views on insecurities.\ufeff",
