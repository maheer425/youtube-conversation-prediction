                "text": "The fundamental premise of this movie is false and demeaning. It is neither \nnecessary nor good for bi-nationals to be accepted in Japanese society as a \nJapanese person.\n    Such acceptance is instead a burden and the freedom from that burden is \none reason ``hafu,'' as a group, enjoy well-above-average success in and \nout of Japan.\n     Being half Japanese is an advantage within Japan over non-Japanese, \nwho almost always lack legal standing, family connections and complete \nfluency in the language. It is also an advantage over ``full'' Japanese \nbecause hafu are freed from many of the suffocating social obligations and \nexpectations imposed on \"full\" Japanese as the price of their full \nacceptance into Japan's closed and, in many ways, fettered, society.\n    How ironic that Nishikura's premise is itself drawn from the \nfundamentally conservative Japanese notion that an individual's identity is \ndefined by acceptance into the group.\n    If we reject the small-minded Japanese idea that anyone outside the \nin-group is lesser or unworthy in some way, Nishikura's complaint becomes \nabsurd.\n    Americans celebrate difference, so it seems a shame that Nishikura \ntakes such a traditionally Japanese view of the hafu experience.\n     This could have and should have been a celebration of the unique \nfreedom hafu experience and all the wonderful, broadening experiences hafu \nhave in and out of Japan.\n    The ethnic grievance template just doesn't work here.\ufeff",

One needn't approve of \nJapan's rigid social codes in order to recognise this.\n\nMy objection is simply that Nishikura and co seem too attached to the ideas \nof racial categorisation, of \"being seen as Japanese\" and of being absorbed \ninto the Japanese national identity. To me, the more fundamental question \nis why we still emphasise national identity and race so strongly in the \nfirst place.  ",

I'm not interested \nin dicing myself up and talking about what percentage of my blood or \nculture is from Japan or Spain or America (as though such a concept is even \nplausible). My problem is rather that I am sick of people defining one \nanother primarily by their 'racial heritage' in the first place, as though \nthis necessarily forms the centrepiece of our identity. Look at the extent \nto which two \"hafu\" people can differ on values, desires, and \nself-perception, and you will see that their shared 'half-Japanese \nheritage' is of comparatively trivial significance. So why make a \ndocumentary that singles us out solely on the basis of our 'race' of all \nthings? \n\nJapanese society is indeed unhealthily race-obsessed. But you do not \ndiscredit race-based thinking by promoting race-based labels like \"hafu\", \nby covering your website with half-faces of \"mixed-race\" people, and by \nmaking galleries with 'half-Japanese specimens' displayed on the walls (as \nthe backers of this documentary project have done). It seems a \ncounter-productive strategy if you seek not to be categorised and \nobjectified on account of your perceived racial background.\n\nWhen people ask me where I'm from, I just state my nationalities, not that \nthat really says who I am either.

Saying Hafu problems comes from the fact that they are mixed blood \nso not pure race is a sophism.\n\n\nFirst of all I would like to know who the f*ck came up with such \nscrewed-up, derived from another language (bringing up more racism as the \nword who defines you in Japan is a foreign word), racist terminology to \ndefine someone who's one parent is from japan and the other one from \nsomewhere else, like Hafu.\nDon't call yourself \"Hafu\", dont even let someone else call you \"Hafu\" find \na Japanese word than (a real one with a kanji in it) means \"mixed\" or \n\"combination\" to show that wherever your second half is from, you still \nfeel Japanese as you are using a real Japanese word.\nEveryone agrees on the fact that Hafu refers to the English word half \n(don't need to be Einstein), which means not complete, or means the other \nhalf is not important or a problem. That is why a new word need to be made, \nin Japanese to make mixed people, a whole.\nWords have symbolism, impact.\n\nDo african americans still let other folks call them niggers, or homeboy? \nNot so much, except those that look like they are from the same background.\nIt might sound a little too little or futile, but the first way to get \nacceptance is by not letting other define who you are. Make the effort \n(even if it shouldn't be an effort as you consider yourself to be Japanese \nin the first place) to define yourself in a way that it makes this \ndistinction between your Japanese part and your other part to disappear.\nAnd showing that you have the will to define yourself with another word \nthan the one decided by the bigot my show some ball and it is something \nthat (still) has some values\nin Japan.\nRemember that in Japan, be strong with the weak and weak with the strong, \ncompassion is not a Japanese trait. So complaining will just bring out more \nanger, resent, or hate.\n\n\nA little lower in your comment :\n\"Nishikura says this: \u201cBased on the way I look, where do you think I\u2019m \nfrom?\u201d She\u2019s saying that there is an unspoken agreement where you have to \n\u201clook\u201d Japanese in order to be seen as a normal human being in Japan. She \nis talking about the racial requirement.\"\n\n\nShe is exactly playing the game of the one who don't see her as Japanese as \nthey are.\nWhy would she even willingly say what her other part is from, it is \nanyone's concern but hers.\nAgreement, from who??? You need to be at least two with different views to \ncome up with an agreement. So you are telling me that the mixed population \nagreed to be seen based on racial requirement ... See again, I don't see \nsomeone (Nishikura) fighting for her identity, I see someone begging for \nothers to stop being mean to her ... this will never work, especially in \nJapan !\n\n\n\"we should not measure people\u2019s legitimacy as citizens by their race or \nancestry\"\nYou are so right and I will always agree to that.\nNow my question will be how do you identify and reduce bigotry?\n\n\nEvery time you are placing the Hafu problem through the race spectrum you \nwill never find a solution because race is not and never will be the issue \nas race does not have a definition that works.\nI mean, you live in Japan, were raised in Japan, went to school in Japan \n(by the way what kind of school, international or local school?) so you \nknow Japanese history, so you should know that as islanders, Japanese \npeople (or its elite) feared culture dilution more than anything else.\nAnd even if culture is not the issue (it can be more than that ... is you \nsolely try to look at your problems through the race spectrum, You Will \nNever Find A Solution.\n\n\nHave you ever try to ask those who don't see you as Japanese as them, what \nshould you do to be so?\n\n\nYou still didn't answer about your other half by the way?\n\n\nIt honestly pains me to see you suffering because of something you didn't \nchose and can't control (being mixed) as it can happn to my son too. But it \npains me more to see that the path you chose to explain it and solve it \nwill go nowhere, bringing you even more suffering and misunderstanding.\n\nAnd as I said early in my comment, parents of mixed kids should prepare \nthem for what problems they will encounter in Japan.\nThat is why if ever I go back to Japan and my kids will have to go to \nschool, he will go to a local school, not the international bullshit that \njust emphasis being outcast.\nI will need to prepare my kid, help him analyse and overcome the racism he \nmight experience in the future.",

It is probably pretty stupid but that is the way people \nare, always have been, and always will be.\n\n2/ I check the GPI, and I don't know what to say because it is difficult to \nknow what their ranking is based on (especially when there are some crime \nthat they don't take into account like violence against women and barbaric \npractices like excision or some sort of cultural mutilation).\nIt would appear if you check in the detail (check the choose your criteria \nbox on the GPI website) how the ranking is about is that Japan is less \npeaceful than other first because of its relation with neighbour countries \nand nuclear weapon pocession (Yeah Japan has some nuclear weapon, mainly \nheld in the American military bases on the Japanese territory, and Japan \nhaving a good relation ship with its neighbour like china and Korea than \nCanada has with the US and NZ with Australia) ... so the lower ranking is \nmore because of external affairs tha internal struggle ... always check the \ndetails\nAnd second, if there peace ranking is as inaccurate as their terrorism \ninfluence ranking, then it is nothing but a joke, how can you explain that \nthey rank Niger being the 4th country the most influenced by terrorisme \nwhen Chad is ranked 118 on 168 ... most problem in Niger is from Boko Aram, \nwhich training camps are in f*cking Chad and still claim that Chad is a lot \nless influenced by terrorisme ... it makes no sense. Same goes for Saoudy \nArabia and Quatar that are actively sponsoring terrorist groups in the \nmiddle east.\n\nAnd the way this ranking is made looks a lot like an anti BRICS propaganda, \nI won't fall for that.\n\n\n3/ \"Foreign Race\" (hate those terme as they refer to nothing) might not \ncommit less crime per capita ... give me official figures. You can't throw \nsomething like this without source to back it up and expect to be taken \nseriously.\n\n4/ ... where the f*uck did you get that I said that hafu are troublemaker? \nPlease quote where you find that in my comment !\n\n\nThe racial purity is something the Japanese are agreeing on for being a \nvery relevant element on being Japanese, i have nothing to do with that. \nEspecially blood (I still don't get where they base people relation based \non their blood type but hat is once again a cultural trait)\nAnd what, wait ... did you just say that 127 million of Japanese people \ndon't see you as Japanese ... Man, you must really do it wrong.\n\n\nFor the last part of your comment :\n\"So instead of singling out racially different strangers and ordering them \nto work for your trust, I say that it\u2019s more important to ask what right \nyou have to hold such an attitude in the first place. What say you?\"\nFirst you still use race when I use culture, but let say we are focusing on \nethnic origin more than culture to keep up with your view. Anywhere in the \nworld (not just in Japan), respect and trust are things that are not given \nbut earned, nothing is for granted. And the more you look from outside the \ncountry, the more it will be difficult to blend in.\nSo I'm not saying that I have any right to ask for it, I'm just stating out \nthe obvious of life in society.\nthe fact that you might agree with it or not does not change the outcome \n... this is how life is.\n\nBut for your own good, you need to realise that some person will love you \nbecause you are a bit or a lot different than the rest and you should \nembrace that instead od focusing on the other who don't like you ... F*ck \nthem.\nBeing who you are have consequences, trying to be someone else also have \nconsequences. Everything we make have consequences. There is no safe zone.\nBut the real question is : Which consequences are the easiest to live with?\n\n\nAnd by the way, what is your other side from? And how old are you?",

Nevertheless, I think we agree that \ntreating \u201chafu\u201d as outsiders is not going to make everyone more socially \nhesitant or better at kanji.\n\nAnd if you consider Japan to be more xenophobic than racist, I can live \nwith that. \n\nI was going to address your other point, but I find it a little patronising \nto be told that people like me must \u201cshow that they can be as Japanese as \neveryone else\u201d, and that \u201ctrust is something you fight to get, not \nsomething you beg for.\u201d I am not begging for people\u2019s trust or approval. I \nsimply resent being seen as a zoo animal in my own country, and I think \nthat if Japan can be made less racist - sorry, xenophobic - than it is now, \nthen it will be better than any kind of wistful romanticism about the good \nold days of so-called homogeneity. \n\nWhy is it worth supporting a fa\u00e7ade of homogeneity, anyway? You say that \nhomogeneity makes Japan safer, preventing the \u201cuncontrolled, unwanted and \nnon-assimilated immigration\u201d of other nations. But consider this:\n\n1. \u201cHafu\u201d are not an immigrant group; they are usually citizens by \nbirthright. \n \n2. Japan was ranked 8th in the 2014 Global Peace Index (out of 162), but \nAustralia was 15th, Ireland 13th, Canada 7th, and New Zealand 4th. Racial \npluralism isn\u2019t inherently dangerous; it depends on how it is managed. A \ngreat way to mismanage it is to alienate minorities by promoting the idea \nof a singular, homogenous racial group.\n\n3. \u201cForeign races\u201d commit *less* crime per capita in Japan than the \n\u201cracially Japanese\u201d. \n\n4. You\u2019ve just implied that \u201chafu\u201d Japanese are inherent troublemakers. Can \nyou demonstrate this?  \n\nAnyway, what more am I supposed to do to prove to my 127 million \ncompatriots that I am \"as Japanese as everyone else\" (particularly since \nyou say that racial purity is a key part of what makes Japan so wonderfully \nJapanese)? The \u201chafu\u201d who \u201csucceed\u201d are paraded as models and TV \npersonalities not necessarily because they \u201cembraced their Japanese culture \nand heritage\u201d as you suggested, but rather because that is how \u201chafu\u201d are \nseen in Japan: not as ordinary people, but as exotic creatures from \nelsewhere.  It is natural human behaviour to mimic and to fit in, so it is \nnot as though \u201chafu\u201d Japanese have never tried to be good citizens. They do \nnot start life thinking that they must act differently \u2013 they learn that \ntheir compatriots see them that way by default, no matter how \u201cJapanese\u201d \nthey are in their actions.\n\nSo instead of singling out racially different strangers and ordering them \nto work for your trust, I say that it\u2019s more important to ask what right \nyou have to hold such an attitude in the first place.

I don't get this one, what \"diversity\" do you see in \nthere.\nLanguage differences, the national language being Japanese and spoken by \n99% of the population, I don't see any differences.\nReligion ... again, what diversity is there when talking about religion in \nJapan (Christianity is rising up slowly, due to the American culture \ninvasion, but still a small margin of the population is concerned by it)?\n\nIf you place another ethnic population on top of yours it is therefore not \nRacism, it is xenophobia.\n\nSo in my opinion and by the definition of culture (when on a social area), \nJapanese culture is what bound Japanese people together or what they share \nas a nation or as fellow citizen, that includes, art, language, history, \ngeography, cuisine, icon, religion, manners, social behaviour, education, \nliterature, and everything else that bound you to your fellow Japanese \nneighbour.\nWhat I don't want Japan to change, is language first, Japanese is one of \nthe oldest spoken language in the world and even if it has evolved through \ntime, some structures and word construction are still the same as when it \nwas called Yamato Kotoba, but since the end of world war II, Japanese is \nshifting  to a more English base language (creating some F*cking aberration \nin the process) which result not only in making new word from English, but \nreplacing old words buy their English counterparts ... 60% of kids under 10 \ndon't f*cking know what \u5319 means same goes for \u8d08\u308a\u7269 that is not used anymore.\nIt pains me to say that but at least the Chinese and Koreans are keeping \ntheir native words and making their own new word ... and they did not get \ntwo A-bomb in their face and don't have to pay half of the foreign military \nbases in their country.\n\nThen, social behaviour, Japan is a very united country, with a feeling of \nselflessness that you can only find in asian countries as opposed to \nindividualistic western cultures.\nI'm not saying that it is ideal, because the \u5efa\u524d is a huge cause of stress \nfor some.

In Japan, it is still too often when \npeople are making fun of someone else demise, sometimes leading to murder.\nBut then again, I don't have any right to make Japan to change, Japan is \nstill the safest place on earth, and the population is homogeneous which \nprevent troubles like western countries are experiencing for the last 3 \ndecades, with an uncontrolled, unwanted, and non-assimilated immigration.",
