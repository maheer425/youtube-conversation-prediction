Or having a team mate ping a million times \nthat enemies are at Rosh when all their (enemies) Ults are on cooldown and \nthey have very strong aoe ults, blink daggers, and counter wards up and he \njust \"Doesn't see it\" so he can farm his fifty minute Radiance on Weaver.\n\nI don't have a problem with fountain camping. But I'm pretty sure the guy \nthat shits on anyone who buys Vlads, and then buys Vlads on like five \ndifferent characters is not the person you want to consider the person to \nwatch. He's not that interesting either, he just uploads a bunch.

                    "text": "Here's the math: Bristleback has 1195 base health at level 16 (probably no \nlower, considering the ease with which they killed Roshan is an indication \nthat the game's been going on a good while), which is increased to 1654 \nfrom items (1195 + 57 from magic wand + 152 from power treads + 250 from \nvanguard).\n\nNyx Assassin is presumably running the standard Nyx build with Urn, Dagon \nand Arcane Boots. Bristleback's armor and vanguard would block a lot of \nautoattack damage, so I will ignore the base damage from his Vendetta \nautoattack. The Vendetta bonus damage is reduced by 30% from Bristleback's \narmor, leaving it at 367 damage. The impale and dagon blast do 1060 base \ndamage together, but taking into account Bristleback's pipe and base magic \nresistance, it would do 530 (1060 * 3/4 * 2/3) damage, for a grand total of \n897 damage.\n\nSo, unless Spectre managed to do almost as much burst damage as Nyx \nAssassin with just her Haunt and Radiance (most likely in BB's back or \nside, I might add), Nyx Assassin wouldn't even come close to killing \nBristleback and would die like the rest of his team. And I know this is an \nanimated series, but it's a poor entertainer that can't take criticism and \nI liked doing the math.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to take into account Rubick's Null Field, which gives BB \nanother 20% magic damage reduction. That brings the magic damage down to \n424 (530 * 4/5) and brings the grand total amount of damage down to 791- \nless than half his health. And to those who say we don't know what happened \noff screen that would bring BB's health down, we also don't know if things \nhappened off screen that would bring it back up either. Rubick's Mekansm or \nFade Bolt, the Pipe's active ability, and the regen auras from both items \nare not calculated here.",

Seeing how he got pudge at the end of his life, one of the dire's \ncarries, and has good farm(and assist exp and gold for defending the last \ntwo episodes).
