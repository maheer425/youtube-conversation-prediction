Those with nothing going for them have to hate.  Block does not care \nabout those who hate on him, he laughs his way to the bank.  \nDismount Loeb's phallus and realize no one cares of your negative remarks \non Block.  They are drivers that entertain two different audiences.  \nNone of you idiots are rally drivers, all of you are poor, the only one \ntaht cares about your existence is your mommy, and your only fans are the \nporn sites you subscribe to.  Get off of YouTube with your attitudes, \nyou're stealing Block's oxygen...and mine.\ufeff",

If you have a versatile enough car, get into autocross, \nlocal rally events, drag strip events, travel to a decent track for an open \ntrack day, etc. Look into racing schools or seminars, regardless of type. \nIf your local oval track has sort of an entry level nascar class and it \nfits your budget, take it. Why not? I'm only 20 but the past 3 years I've \ntaken my STi in autocross at Giants Stadium, NASA rally events in upstate \nNY and PA, \"Evo vs STi\" days at Englishtown drag strip, a few SCCA open \ntrack days at NJMP, etc. Also, look into some sort of journalism for local \nevents. Not a lot of people cover the local rally events here so I meet a \nlot of connected people simply because I'm there taking pictures and \nbroadcasting the standings on my twitter, instagram, etc. The more people \nyou meet and the more involved you get, the further you'll get. It'll also \nhelp to look into an SCCA license and other racing licenses. Some events \nrequire it, so if you have it you can compete in bigger events.\n\n+Reinis Aizsilnieks in most parts of the US, race tracks are scarce. In the \nnortheast where I'm from and the northwest where he's from, either not a \nlot of people are into racing, the surrounding land isn't suitable to build \none, or the local economy can't support one. In the southern US where the \nland is flat and open and a lot of big local economies are, race tracks are \neverywhere. Florida, Texas and southern California have many race tracks. \nAnd most of the professional racing in America is done through connections. \nTravis Pastrana, Bucky Lasek and Ken Block all have big connections to Red \nBull and other sports organizations, so it was easy for them. I know for \nsure Mitchell Dejong got into the GRC Lites division because his father is \na mechanic for the Red Bull team. Tanner Faust is a host of Top Gear US, \nNelson Piquet Jr is the son of the F1 driver Nelson Piquet, the list goes \non. Which further emphasizes my point, you're gunna need a lot of \nconnections to get places in American racing lol",

                    "text": "+Reinis Aizsilnieks I live down by Roseburg, Oregon and we have 1 track, \nwhich is an oval track. DC Speedway, it was a 1/8 of a mile oval or \nsomething like that, and got upgraded to a 4/10 of a mile oval a few years \nback. The only other one I know of in Oregon is the Portland International \nSpeedway. Washington (where I used to live) has 21 race tracks according to \nhttp://racingin.com/track/washington.aspx most of which are about 1/4 mile \nand I saw one 1/2 mile and one at 2.3 miles.\nOregon has 19 according to the same website, though I didn't see any indoor \ncart places and I saw one down in Medford the other day. But I saw at least \n4 drag strips. \n\nSo I would venture other states have at least that, but really there isn't \na lot of promotion to professional racing... except toward Nascar. Over on \nthe west coast all I hear about is local kart, hornet, and street stock \nracing. Otherwise it's Nascar. The only reason I know what Le Mans is is \nbecause I ran across it on the Speed Channel when I was 15 or so (2006). I \nknow there's an offroad series also which is pretty cool. There is \nliterally no promoting of anything (that I'm aware of) in the states for \nanything but local 1/4 mile oval races, drag races, or Nascar.\n\nThe only reason I ran across WRC and McRae and Loeb is youtube. I had ear \nsurgery a month ago yesterday and ran across rally videos at random and \nhave fallen asleep to the sound of Loeb tearing up the stage literally \nevery night.\n\nBut, in reality, as a 23 year old American who loves to drive fast \neverywhere possible, and having been belittled by the \"American Muscle\" \ntypes because I want to drive fast in more than a straight line, and \nmothers because I have a 4 year old son, it is hard to achieve anything but \na local track career. The most majority of Americans aspire to is Nascar... \nvery few people I've met look overseas for anything but a vacation \ndestination. Americans like SideWays8Productions and myself that aspire to \nreach competition in a foreign country are a rarity (other than maybe \nsoccer/football). I look at the drivers in WRC, especially Loeb seeing as \nhe dominates WRC, and I admire their abilities and it brings out the \ncompetitive nature I have, and I want to reach them and when I do, I want \nto pit my skills against there's. This is a mentality that seems to have \ndied off in American culture.",

                    "text": "+Ace Night That's exactly my point to the T. American \"racing\" is so \nsheltered and close knitted, it takes decades to expand. People get \nimmersed in one form of it and settle for the rest of their lives. Drag \nracers build these awesome 6 second cars (I respect a well built machine, \nregardless of sport lol) but that's it. They get their strip times every \nweekend and they're happy. The JDM time attack kids with their whacky aero \nkits and rivets get so immersed in lap times, and that's it. Americans \nrarely expand to other forms of racing and that's why you rarely see \nAmericans in international racing series. My aspirations are to be a WRC \ndriver or a World Endurance driver in Le Mans, specifically for Aston \nMartin. I'd also love to be an F1 driver if ever faced with that \nopportunity, I'll even be a World Touring Car driver if I had that \nopportunity as well. Because the way I see it, the more experience you have \nunder your belt, the further you can go. F1 is gunna take a world champion \nrally, Le Mans and WTCC driver over a 16 year old kid who's father won a \nfew podiums back in the 80s (coughRosbergcough). And you rarely see that in \nAmerica because no one has that mentality. Everyone settles with one type \nof car or one type of racing and they get no where. They can be the best \ntime attack driver in Leguna Seca, but they'll ONLY be that. OP said \nAmericans aren't skilled enough to be in the WRC, and I tried to tell him \nit has more to do with opportunity than it does skill.\n\nAnd my comparison between America and Europe was in a demographic sense. \nEurope has twice our population, but only half of the countries have \ndeveloped infrastructure and government to compare to America (i.e., \nexcluding south/south-eastern Europe, etc). And among that population, a \nlot more people are associated with motorsports. Whether it be actively \ncompeting in a series, or just a car enthusiast in general. Not to mention \nthe driving skill of Europe in general is a lot better than Americas lol I \ncan't begin to count how many times a dumb broad in a Range Rover almost \nrammed me off the road when approaching a slight bend lol",

A 9 time World Rally champion, who has won rallies on every surface \n- tarmac, gravel, snow, mountain roads - you name it. He will easily adjust \nto any surface or race structure Ken Block is an expert in, and will \ncomfortably beat him there. For a comparison, Ken Block has entered the \nWorld Rally Championships, and finished 7th in the Mexico Rally, his best \nresult to date.\ufeff",
