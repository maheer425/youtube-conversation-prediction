My gf recently broke up with me \nand my work isn't paying me all my wages. And I know that there are others \nthat have it a LOT worse off than me, on the surface I actually have it \nvery easy. But I am fed up of constantly trying to impress others and get \nthrough each day. I want to attack the day and make it my own from now on. \nThats why I'm planning on going on the Xfactor this year, Ive never sang \ninfront of anyone apart from my ex, but I feel like I owe it to myself and \nto prove to me that I can do it if I have the belief. I hope I inspire \nsomeone else to do something that they've always feared doing and to \nrecapture there life, and remember it's not over until we win!\ufeff",

                "text": "I've begun to realize something, watching these motivational videos \nconnects with what you are feeling but, in some to most cases, doesn't \nhelp. You can work for hours after hours to support yourself, go sleepless \nstudying for exams to get good grades, or train until your body gives out \nto a point where you want to \"succeed as bad as you want to breathe.\" But, \nin the end, it won't help. No matter how hard you try the guy next to you \nmay only work part time, never study, and rarely train/workout but you'll \nnever be wealthier and economically stable as him. You'll never get better \ngrades or get even close to the grades he gets. And he'll ALWAYS be better \nthan you. For example, in my situation and I'm sure others watching the \nvideo as well, I put in 150% effort into EVERYTHING. I study countless \nhours for exams, I could train 5-6 hours a day but my level will always be \ndecreasing at a rate slower than the way the world is moving. I wouldn't \nstudy for an exam and fail it. If I study my a** off, I would get a C. For \nothers, they DON'T study and they'd get a C maybe B- and they study and \nwould easily get an A. In todays world with the competition, I am not \ncutting it. Hard work is not cutting it. Nothing is helping me achieve my \nmany goals. And life is rough, I understand that and I'm sure much of you \nhave it worse but I'm sick and tired of this constant effort for \nnothingness. I'm sick and tired of utilizing my many resources and putting \nin the effort but not living my life on MY terms. However, one thing I am \npracticing is getting back up and keeping a positive attitude, which I am \nadept at. However, these videos keep stating to \"get back up because I am \neventually bound to achieve.\" This has been going on for 2 years and is \ngetting worse, and I'm afraid I'm not going to have enough chances to get \nback up anymore. Sooner or later, college applications will come and I'll \nbe in the same or lower place and working even harder. Every day I have a \npositive attitude because I am embarrassed with my performance and create \nthis false reality to my peers that makes me believe I am successful, when \nI am not. The point is I will keep trying but, one of these days, I'll \nalready be too far in the abyss from failures to ever get back up...\ufeff",

                    "text": "+fuckyeah009 Fucking respect, man. I've been going through some pretty hard \ntimes the past year and a half, as well - Three Decembers ago, I was taking \nmy GSCEs. I failed. Didn't take life seriously. I've always wanted to join \nthe British Army, so, I decided to turn my life around; my A Levels (step \nabove GSCEs) was a two-year course (I was in Ireland, at the time, after \nmoving there from the UK a couple of years beforehand). I was set on \nstudying like mad and acing everything. The first year went past and I was \nstill a pot-smoking waster that I was a year back. Second year came, and I \nwas still the same. But, in the final few months before the last exams, I \ngrabbed all of my textbooks, got my head down and studied from 9am to 6pm \neveryday. I didn't leave the house until the exams came along. I came out \nafter the two weeks with some of the best results in my Year. And I got the \nqualifications needed for my dream of the BA's Intelligence Corps. I was \npiss-poor, and had been my whole life (I still am), but I managed to work \nevery Saturday so that I could move back to the UK to join. I scraped \nenough together and moved back last Sep. to live with my nan. She helped me \nget a 2nd-hand suit for my interview (that I had been running through in my \nhead for the past 2 years). I passed it. Had my pre-selection last month; \nsmashed that, too. Final two-day Selection is next month now, and then the \nfive-day INT Corps selection after that. It's 4am here and I've just gone \nfor a three-mile run (I'm gonna increase it). I've come so far in three \nyears, and like you basically said - it's all down to hard work and \ndedication, and the belief that you can do it. Nearly my whole family is \nagainst my choice; cousins, sisters, parents, uncles, even my \nbrother-in-law. Even my teachers in school were. They're all in that hippie \nmindset, or, I \"won't be able to do it\".\n\nTo anyone that read all of this, you can turn your life around and make \nyourself who you want to be. All you have to do is do what is needed to be \ndone to get to where you want to be.\n\nIf you don't do it; you won't get there.",
