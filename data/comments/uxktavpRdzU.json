I was watching a cop drama -- Lie \nto Me -- where a witness to a murder had 4 separate identities and they \ndidn't communicate with each other. They knew they existed but they shared \nnothing, and had to actively try to share memories so the \"main \npersonality\" could recount the murders and help law enforcement. Obviously, \nthat's a fictional account, but I would say it's definitely in the realm of \npossibility. A lot of it would depend on why the other personalities \ndeveloped and how the original personality, or main personality or whatever \nthe actual term for the starting personality of the person is, handles the \nrelationship with the other personalities I suspect. But that is definitely \na question I would love to see definitively answered.",

I can get mad at myself for real if I've done something \nstupid, or actually congratulate myself for being right about something. I \nknow everybody does that but I feel like there is something wrong about the \nway I do it. Like when I'm about to think about something I ask myself (out \nloud sometimes if I'm alone) \"What do you think ?\" and the crazy part is I \nwould answer sometimes \"I don't know man, this is hard...\" or whatever. I'm \ndoing this more and more lately and it's starting to worry me. I'm not \ncrazy or anything  (or at least I don't believe so) and I'm functional, I \ngo to college, I have friends and stuff but I would still understand if I \nwere to develop some mental issue (even a minor one) since I live alone, I \ndon't go out much, there's a lot a pressure on me, I'm a pretty shy guy, I \nwatch and experience a lot of fiction; I mean I feel like the ingredients \nare there for some shady stuff to happen inside my head...\nSo yeah I don't know I guess my main question is am I the only one ?\ufeff",

What was once \ncalled \"sexual identity disorder\" is now called transgenderism. \nTransgendered people simply feel that their likes, dislikes, and other \npreferences are more compatible with society's expectations of the opposite \nsex than their own. This is not a break from reality, as those expectations \nare only based in arbitrary societal views and not on anything real to \nbegin with. It's not perceptual issues, as they don't see or hear or sense \nanything that's not there. It's not disorganized thoughts or speech. It's \nnot a separate identity--there's only one, it's just not living up to \nsociety's rules of what they should enjoy. Not a SINGLE symptom of either \nschizophrenia nor dissociative identity disorder is present in \ntransgenderism.\n\nWhich leads me to believe that either you have no idea what transgenderism \nis, or you didn't understand this video, or you're trolling.

I been getting into them since \nI was in 9th grade because I needed to study for my Biology MCAS and \nwatching those videos helped me to pass. So thank you for that. I just \nstarted watching your Psychology videos because I am into Psychology and my \nfavorite topic is on DID. I have read Sybil and I loved her story although \nit was hard for me to read it since it was so graphic in what happen to her \nbut I understood that her mother had Schizophania and that what got her to \nsexually abuse her daughter Sybil. It was because of that, that Sybil never \nhad kids who wasn't even able to. I have seen the movie too and again I \ncouldn't believe that a mother would do that and I felt bad for Sybil. I \nnever read Sybil exposed because I do believe Sybil and that there is such \nthing as DID. DID is also in a textbook I bought on Amezon. Now you mention \nSybil which I love but you forgot to mention Eve from the three faces of \nEve. She was a woman name Eve white or has 2 other personalities name Eve \nBlack and Jane. Her cased was before Sybil's case although after Sybil \npeople started to learn about DID. Also I got Epilopsy so maybe you should \na video on that too because I have notice people don't understand much \nabout either. They only know off the bad kind where someone collapse and \nshaked. With me I just stare into space during either HW or in a middle of \na conversation and I need medication to control it.",

People with delusions were much more often \nseen as Oracles or felt that God (a god, etc) was talking through them.

Like ethan hunsaker I also have a mother \nwith severe schizophrenia, as well as bipolar disorder. Her particular \nhallucinations rather than being centred around anything which could be \nlinked to culture or religion are instead much more personal. They involve \nfamily and friends as well as things which she had personal interest \nin/experience with when not experiencing the illness. I would also like to \nadd, addressed to anyone experiencing hardship through having personal \nconnection to the condition, that it is by no means something you are \nsentenced to for life. I am personally extremely lucky to have a mum who, \ndespite the past which both her and those around her have been through; is \ncurrently a healthy and happy person, thanks to her use of life changing \nmedication.

Environmental \nfactors can induce or onset the genes already inherited for example they \nsay if you were born during winter, if your mother had certain virus when \nshe was pregnant, if you grew up in an urban environment those things can \ntrigger the gene and develop Schizophrenia. In this case, you cannot get it \nif you do not already have a malformation of some of the genes.\nEnvironmental factors can also be responsible for the cause of the \nmalformation in the first place during pregnancy but this is the only full \ncase where the environment can induce a full conformable change in the \nphysical structure of the brain and the genes meaning the environment \ndirectly caused the mutation of the brain and the genes during pregnancy \nthat was not due to inheritance and hence increased the vulnerability of \nobtaining Schizophrenia. \nIn all it's the gene and the environment that affect everything. But some \npeople have more malformations or recessive genes than others in fact many \npeople have the recessive genes, the more  you have the more the risk \nincreases and the type of environment you were born, grew up and with which \nyou surround yourself also increases the risk of the genes being triggered. \n ",

                    "text": "Hey Jared, I am currently in Medical School and I have recently finished my \nrounds with the Psychiatric ward in our teaching hospital. I had to learn \nabout Schizophrenia (Sz) to a very complex level. I'm sorry if this is too \nlong / too complicated to understand. If you need help with understanding \nthis, please reply and I can help\n\nThere are two factors that can cause Sz: genetics and environmental. I will \ngo into (some) detail in both.\n\n1. Genetics. Washington University in St. Louis has done a study recently \nthat has found 11 gene candidates for causing Sz. Currently, there are only \n2 groupings that 99% of the population of Sz's are classified in under the \nDSM-V. However, this study has found EIGHT groupings instead of just two \n(one grouping has a 100% chance of acquiring Sz!). These gene markers are \nfound on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 22. These genes all play a role \nin neural plasticity (how our brain can reform itself to experience and \ninjury) as well as GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and cortex development. \nIn short, these \"bad\" genes affects how the brain is formed. A good example \nof this is CT scans showing enlarged lateral ventricles, which shows brain \ndeterioration!\n\nWhen the video talks about twins, they don't involve the whole picture. \nTwins that share the same placenta have a 40-50% concordance rate (where \nboth twins will get Sz). However, if there is a split placenta, there is \nonly a 10% chance of concordance. This means that if twins don't share the \nplacenta, there's a 90% chance that the other twin WILL NOT be affected by \nthe first twin if he/she has Sz.\n\nSimple brain plan of getting Sz:\na. loss of brain stem arousal neurons (DA, NE, Glu, and GABA)\nb. negative symptoms in the prefrontal cortex\nc. loss of inhibitory feedback to limbic systems (amygdala and hippocampus)\nd. induction of positive symptoms\n\n2. Environmental causes. This one is easier to grasp. There are four points \nin one's life where he/she can get Sz: in utero, at birth, childhood, and \nadolescence. This means by your mid-twenties, you are in the clear for \ngetting Sz. In utero, there are several factors that can cause (or make the \nfetus more susceptible to) Sz. One is maternal malnutrition/drug use. The \nfetus is MOST susceptible at the end of the 2nd trimester to drugs and \nmalnutrition. The second is viral infections. Studies have shown that when \na viral epidemic occurs, there is a sharp spike in Sz cases in children \nborn during the epidemic because the mother caught the virus. A heavy viral \nload (very bad case of the cold, for example) increases the rate of Sz \nvulnerability/acquisition 10x! The last genetic component is paternal age. \nThe older the father is during conception, the higher the chance of \ndeveloping Sz (and other disorders as well.)\n\nDuring childhood and adolescence, there are several other factors. First, \nthere is severe abuse/neglect. Children that were born in a stressful and \nharmful environment have a much higher chance of getting Sz (please note \nthat not every child put in this kind of environment will get Sz.) Speaking \nof stress, a high stress load can put a child/adolescent in a position to \ngetting Sz. This is especially true if the child is going through a tough \neconomical position where the parents lose jobs, have to downgrade \nlifestyle, etc. Lastly, there are several studies of Cannaboid that links \nrisks of acquiring Sz-related psychosis. Cannabis glutamate and GABA \nreceptors and, if an adolescent abuses it, will change brain \nneuroplasticity that will cause Sz.\n\nI know this is a lot to read, but I hope you find this helpful. Sz is a \nvery complicated disease that needs a lot of studying to be done. Hope I \npainted a clearer picture for you!",
