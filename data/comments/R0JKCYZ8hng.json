Also, \nthere is this software, synthesia which is very usefull because you can \nlearn keyboard songs in the style of \"guitar hero\" so you don't need any \nsheet reading skills !

And, as in any other workout, \ndisciplined, structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain \nfunctions, allowing us to apply that strength to other activities\u2026 Playing \nmusic has been found to increase the volume and activity in the brain\u2019s \ncorpus callosum \u2014 the bridge between the two hemispheres \u2014 allowing \nmessages to get across the brain faster and through more diverse routes. \nThis may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively, \nin both academic and social settings.\n\nBecause making music also involves crafting and understanding its emotional \ncontent and message, musicians also have higher levels of executive \nfunction \u2014 a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, \nstrategizing, and attention to detail, and requires simultaneous analysis \nof both cognitive and emotional aspects.\n\nThis ability also has an impact on how our memory systems work. And, \nindeed, musicians exhibit enhanced memory functions \u2014 creating, storing, \nand retrieving memories more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found \nthat musicians appear to use their highly connected brains to give each \nmemory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag, an emotional tag, an audio \ntag, and a contextual tag \u2014 like a good internet search engine.\"\ufeff",

That is \nultimately a bad motive, and it may hold them for some months and it may \nhelp them with recreational music but in no way will be a permanent \nmotivation and will fade eventually because you must really love music to \nsucceed in it, you really do. I think you went into music with clear head - \nno prejudice or particular goal or motive and that opened the door for love \nto come in and for you to love it and grow close to it over time, you also \nhad no expectations as i can see. But if someone starts playing an \ninstrument because they want to be smarter or have more superior brain it \njust won't work out because music does not hold that kinda pressure and as \nsoon as a bigger barrier appears they will give up because they don't have \ngreat enough motive to keep them going. If this video is someone's motive \nthey will more likely end up hating the music than love it.",

Of course, there \nare just as many nuances to playing piano as any other instrument, which \ntake a life time to master, but it doesn't take much to begin learning \npiano.\n Moreover, piano is a great instrument for gatherings. Many people have \npianos in their houses, so once you become confident in your skills you can \npretty much play anywhere, for anyone, or with anyone. It is a very \nintimate instrument that lends itself well to more casual settings. With \nother instruments, however, unless you have an actual reason to play them \n(i.e. a concert or something), you won't have much chance to play them \nother than for your own enjoyment. People don't tend to have violins or \nclarinets laying around their house, at least, not as much as pianos; and \neven if they did, people generally don't like others playing these sorts of \ninstruments, as they are more personalized (for lack of a better word) than \npianos.
