Your experiences with the women in your life do not reflect my \nexperiences with the men in mine, or anyone else's. It's important that you \nbear that in mind when conversing with people.\n\nIn reference to my name; it seems that it *is* difficult to understand as \nyou keep referring to simply the \"sadist\" and \"amorality\" that is \nassociated with the name de Sade and the title \"Libertine\", yet there is \n*much* more to both. I'll say this and then I'm done with this entire \nthread:\n\nAs someone who has actually read what he has written, I have to say that I \nam a fan of his work and the philosophy associated with it. The reference \nthat I make to de Sade and the term \"libertine\" is one that only someone \nwho has read and understood his works will get. Not trying to sound uppity \nor like an elitist, no judgement here. I'm just making the point that very \nfew people get the context of the name I've chosen and the irony of it. It \nhas very little to do with sadism, only in that the connection is that he \nwrote on the subject and the word itself is derived from his name, nor does \nit totally have to be with *being* an amoral person. So I'll end my post \nwith a suggestion. If you're truly interested and want to actually be \ninformed for the next time you mention the Marquis de Sade and his works \nplease read what the man himself wrote, form your own opinion and then \nmaybe have a conversation. Personally I think it's worth it, but it's up to \nyou and your preferences. \n\nThat's all I have to say on this. Going back and forth is pointless. I'm \nmuting this thread.

It saddens \nme though that it's so easy to be better than all of someone's former \nlovers with so little effort. It's not just the first time that's awkward, \nIMO, and it takes significant repetition (not a bad thing) until the sex \nbecomes as \"challenging\" for me as it is for her.\nSex doesn't just come naturally. It's a skill that's worked on throughout \nthe course of one's life. That belief is the fundamental difference in the \nperspectives that forms both the numbers discussed in the video, and so \nmany people's dissatisfaction with sex, as well as the puritanical system \nbuilt around the denial of it. Running is natural too, but some people work \nto be better at it, and the lack of acceptable partners leads to poor \ntraining techniques.\n\nUnderstanding your name isn't difficult, so doesn't need bonus points. \nChoosing a name that doesn't fit is deliberately misleading.
