                "text": "It is refreshing that a country as small as Sweden recognizes that having a \nvital manufacturing sector is essential to the wellbeing of not only the \neconomy as measured by Gross National Product but the wellbeing of the \npopulation who can take pride in their manufacturing prowess; Volvo is \ncertainly leading the way with their truck manufacturing facilities. All \ntoo often North American manufacturers are selling off 'lock, stock & \nbarrel' the means of production. We are becoming a nation of warehouses and \nlogistics managers selling to a diminishing group of workers who can least \nafford the products being offered on our burgeoning store shelves. \nAbundance can't be measured at the cash register only.\ufeff",
