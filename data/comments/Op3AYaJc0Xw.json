If that was the case, one could argue that Hinduism is the \n'one true religion', since it's history precedes that of all other \nreligions to date. Or that practices like slavery or stoning are more \ncorrect as practices since they have been around for so long.\n\n>\"You are just blind sheep following the the unproven theory of science. \"\nIn a sense, everything is 'unproven', you cannot (reasonably) be 100% \ncertain of anything; you cannot be 100% certain that anything you \nexperience even truly exists. We all have to make assumptions about \nreality, but what is important is an assumption's predictive capability, or \nto what degree that assumption is conducive to objective reality. Some \nassumptions (like dropping a ball in a gravitational field) have such \nrigorously consistent results, that we operate >as if< it was 100% true, \nbut these actions say nothing about what >could ultimately< be true. Such \nare the issues with many religions: they draw absolutes, which, time and \ntime again, are unreasonable in the face of what we objectively observe \nabout reality. What you refer to as \"the unproven theory of science\" has \nvastly 'proven' itself to have more predictive capability and universal \nutility than the absurd claims of religion.\n\n>\"People shouldn't just blindly believe everything they are told. \"\nYou're correct in saying this, which is ironic given the nature of how most \npeople come to believe in religion (and given, how i suspect, you came to \naccept the teachings of your religion.) However, just because you can \nacknowledge that not everything you experience can be reasonably trusted, \ndoesn't mean you adhere to such a principle in practice. If i'm not \nmistaken, it is very popular among Christian practices to submit oneself to \nGod in an act of total faith. In fact, many christian apologists argue that \n\"atheists don't have access to the same information that Christians do, as \nthey have not accepted Jesus as their personal lord and savior. This is why \nthey can never reconcile the Christian perspective, and we can.\" Well isn't \nthat interesting. I would say that fits your description of 'blindly \nbelieving something they are told' more than anything.\n\nThe idea that \"you must first accept >that it's true<, to see >how< it's \ntrue\" is a dangerous prospect.\n\nI don't mean to accuse you specifically of adhering to such a practice. For \nall I know you could have very well accepted your religion on objective \nmerits which you have observed (in which case, I would entice you to \nrevisit such assumptions; really challenge them on the basis of evidence.)\n\nLastly, accusing the scientific process of being untrustworthy is just \nrelative ignorance in the face of all the combined benefits (which we reap \ndaily) that scientific reasoning has allowed us to experience, and I am \nmore than comfortable lending credit where credit is due to such a practice.\n\nI think it's reasonable to say that rational people don't \"praise\" or \n\"worship\" anything, (if your definitions of worship and praise means: \n\"assign more value than is deserved\" or \"assign value through faith alone\" \nor \"assign value despite strong evidence against\"), they assign credit \nwhere credit is due, and to the degree which it is deserved and no-more \nthan that.",
