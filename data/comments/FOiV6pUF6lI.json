Brown will always mask blue if it's present, thus your \nfather has brown eyes (He has one dominant brown allele, and one recessive \nblue allele). He passed the recessive allele to you and your sister, and he \npassed the dominant allele to your brother. Your mom (having blue eyes) can \nonly pass recessive genes. You and your sister received, in total, two \nrecessive blues, your brother received one recessive blue, and one dominant \nbrown.\n\nGenes always work the same way.",

(Remember that each person only \ncontributes one allele to their offspring, so, if that blue-eyed ancestor's \nCHILD didn't pass it on, it would never reappear further down the line)\n\nLike Jayne said, you'd have to get genetic testing done to see if you carry \nthe blue-eyed recessive trait. Genetic testing is how we can know for sure \nif you carry that trait. But what I mean is that you can't tell by looking \nat someone's appearance, or their family's appearance (i.e. their brown \neyes) if they carry the trait. If you DON'T carry that recessive allele, \nyou cannot have a blue-eyed child. But if you do carry that blue allele, \neven if you have brown eyes, there's the possibility of passing it on.\n\nI feel like we've been talking ad nauseum haha You seem really interested \nin this, so I'd suggest finding a local science teacher (middle school, \nhigh school, college, doesn't really matter) and ask them to explain basic \ngenetics to you -- specifically about genotypes, phenotypes and punnet \nsquares.\n It's much easier to give visual examples in person than just walls of text.",

But just because an entire family has brown eyes, even generations \nand generations back, that doesn't mean they aren't carriers of recessive \ntraits. Even if only one person in their family thousands of years ago had \na recessive allele, even if it's been completely masked all these years, it \nis absolutely possible that it has been passed through every generation. \nThere's no way for us to know for sure that every single person in a \nfamily's entire history has only had Dominant brown genes. In this person's \ncase, we KNOW the father possessed a recessive allele BECAUSE he had \nchildren with blue eyes.\n\nIn genetics, there are \"genotypes\" and \"phenotypes.\" Genotypes describe the \ngenes a person carries. Phenotypes describe the physical appearance of \nthose genes. All people who have brown eyes are either genotype Bb or BB, \nbut they all still have brown eyes. Blue-eyed people are only bb. Each \nparent passes one allele to the offspring. If an entire family is genotype \nBb, they still all have brown eyes, but they all carry a recessive blue \nallele. If the whole entire family has genotype BB, then there is no \npotential for them to have a blue-eyed child as they can only pass dominant \ngenes. However, if they married someone with recessive genes, their \nchildren, even if they are brown-eyed, WILL be carriers of recessive genes \nbecause the blue-eyed partner can only pass recessive alleles.\n\nSo this person who has a dad whose \"entire family\" has brown eyes, and yet \nTHEY have blue eyes is not an anomaly. Their father must've been genotype \nBb, meaning somewhere in his family, other people with brown eyes also \ncarried that recessive allele and passed it to him. Even if they only all \never married brown eyed people, any of them could've been carriers of \nrecessive alleles, thus making this entirely reasonable and plausible.",

To increase the percentage of blue eyes, including different eye \ncolors + bright hair colors like red and blond, white people just need to \nbreed or produce babies amongst each other a lot more like they used to and \nno, I am NOT talking about incest! Eww.\nAnother fun fact; Blue eyes and other recessive physical traits like light \nhair, cleft chin, attached earlobes, etcetera are not exclusive to white \npeople or those of European (from Russia to Portugal) descent. These can \nalso be found on East Asians all the way to Subsahara Africans. Yes, it is \nan exception, considering the latter two mentioned due to albinoism and not \nthe norm as it is with Caucasoids/Whites. The reason why those recessive \ntraits are predominantly found or has prevelant presence with white people \nis because genetic mutation that allows them to be visibly apparent, \noccured in Europeans when they lived in the most extreme northern polar \nregions during or after the Ice Age, thus their genes went through some \nstructural changes (fostering the foundational development of said physical \nrecessive traits) by adapting to the harsh climate which took several \nhundred years to a few millenia.\nMy point is that non-White/non-Caucasoid people (Asians and Blacks) who \ntypically don't have recessive features such as blue eyes, grey eyes, green \neyes, blond hair, red hair, auburn hair, cleft chin, so on and so forth at \nthe present moment, will always definitely and unmistakably have 100% \npotential to develop recessive features in a massive scale, similar to how \nit is for Whites/Caucasods, whether \"White Supremists\"/\"White Purists\" hate \nto admit that or not.",

It is even possible to approximately \ndate the matrilineal and patrilineal most recent common ancestors, meaning \nif you take everybody's mothers and then their mothers and then their \nmothers again and so forth, you finally and up with one woman from whom we \nall descend (sometimes called the mitochondrial Eve). Same goes for fathers \n(the Y-chromosomal Adam). However, both didn't live at the same time and \nweren't like a couple or anything. In fact, it's just a fluke of biology \nthat we can date these two lines while others are more difficult. We have \nmany more ancestors living at the same time as those most recent common \nancestors. But still, we're all related on a timescale of 120,000 to \n150,000 years as all blue-eyed people are on that 10,000 year timescale. \nHowever, if you look for the absolute most recent common ancestor, that \nperson probably lived a lot more recently actually, although this can only \nbe modelled statistically.\n\nIf you are with a person that has at least a different skin color than \nyourself, chances are that your mutual most recent common ancestor is much \nyounger than even those 10,000 years. If she's from the same reason you're \nmost certainly distant cousins; I'd say no more than a couple of centuries \napart ;) You can do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation by considering \nthat everyone has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 \ngreat-great-grandparents and so on, so 2^n ancestors in generation *n*. Now \nif you know what common area you and your partner are from and you know how \nmany people live there and used to live there, you can get to a number of \ngenerations in which the number of ancestors is larger than the population \nof that area. What does that mean? Overlap in your family tree: people take \nmultiple roles and the thing becomes a web. Of course, statistically this \nwould have happened much, much earlier than that theoretical maximum.",

This recognition priority is a separate trait that \noccurs in all populations, with only the proportion that varies.  Knowing \none does not in any way guarantee the other.\n\nSince architecture is a highly analytical profession, it may coincidentally \ncontain more blue-eyed people than the population at large in some \ncountries.  It would be more relevant in the USA or Britain than it would \nbe in China, obviously.  It would take a rigorous statistical study to see \nif your intuition is accurate for your country.\n\nThere is a particular blue/gold pattern of eye coloration that is, in my \nexperience, indicative of the pattern/analytic perception in the extreme, \nbut that is apparently unreported in public science.

With a scientific method \nthat can be demonstrated over and over, this is fine and good. But with \nnon-science topics like any single event that occurred in the past that \ncannot be repetitively tested... (bubble bursting time...) that's not \nscience.

Black hair is better \nin sunnier climes, you can handle the heat and UV better, and your children \nare more likely to grow up healthily and choose mates that did the same. \nAlso, never underestimate the power of sexual selection.

There is no blue pigment that makes them blue like there is the \nbrown pigment that makes brown eyes brown. I think they said it just the \nplay of light that make your mutated eyes appear blue, like the sky, which \nis not really blue and the ocean which is not really blue.\nSo, with that said, you need to look at Dr. Gregg Homer on the internet, He \ninvented a laser that burns off the brown melanin pigment of a brown \npersons eyes to reveal the blue iris underneath. Yes it is true, all brown \neyed people (including blacks) have blue iris' just like you, ain't that \nswell?!. It's just that it is covered by the normal amount of melanin \npigment. So there you go Ingrid, what do you think of those jelly beans?",

It's random. Each gene the parent gives is called an \nallele. Two alleles make a gene (thats not 100% correct but its simple) for \na trait. If your father had brown eyes and your mother had blue eyes then \nyou were guaranteed to get a least one allele that is blue. Your mother had \ntwo blue alleles if she had blue eyes because the brown eye gene is \ndominant so if she had one blue and one brown then her eyes would have been \nbrown. The dominant allele masks and takes over the recessive allele \nbecause the recessive allele is not the dominant one.\n  \nIf your father had brown eyes but one of his parents had blue eyes than he \nhas a blue allele. Because we know you have blue eyes we know that your \nfather carries the blue allele its just masked by the brown one he also \ncarries. \n\nWhen your parents made a baby, you, half of your alleles came from your \nfather, half from your mother. They were carried to you in the egg and the \nsperm. Because there are so many little sperms, and each one carried a \nrandom collection of alleles, you could have had blue or brown eyes \ndepending on which sperm got to the egg. The sperm that go to the egg had a \nblue eye allele combined with the blue eye allele from the egg means a blue \neyed baby!\n\nYou just got lucky enough that the blue eye allele your father was carrying \nwas the sperm that impregnated the egg.\n\nI don't know which of your parents has which color eyes, but if I got it \nwrong and your father has blue eyes and your mother has brown than yeah \njust reverse the roles, the egg happened to have the blue eyed gene your \nmother was a carrier of and you were certain to get a blue one form your \nfather's sperm.\n\nGenetics is complicated, any questions?",

It was definitely a mutation that caused blue eyes but you \nare not a mutant because of that you have blue eyes. If you are there isn't \na single thing alive that isn't a mutant.\nIts like having a byte of bits:\n00110011\nand then change 1 bit to make:\n10110011\nThat change is a mutation, and is really everything mutations are. Most \ndoesn't do anything however so you will most likely not even care about \nthem. A single mutation reallly only matters when it affect a trigger for \nsome other gene. Like if the first byte gave mice a yellow color on their \nfur, and changing the first bit resulted in making the gene malfuction \nand/or create a different color like black. Its something really anoying \nwhen you speak with for example creationists. They think a mutation is like \nsomething from a comic book when it actually is only a modification or a \nchange of some kind. It isn't a very exciting word but it isn't ment to be \nas well.",
