Much to the degree of say, arachnophobia, the irrational \nfear of spiders.\n\nYou may not fear them, and view them with indifference, while the person \nnext to you could see them as nightmare inducing beings straight from Hell. \nIt's a matter of how your mind perceives it.\n\nNow, I'm fully aware of next to every picture in the search results being \nphoto-shop mockups, but the phobia far outgoes logical thought, and sees \nonly what's there, a mass of clustered holes, and not only that, but a \ncluster of holes on a person, some put in hyperrealism. People with \nTrypophobia don't see it as fake, they see it as a trigger for the feelings \nof disgust and discomfort.\n\nLong story, short: What you see may not be the same thing as someone with a \nphobia of said sight sees.",
