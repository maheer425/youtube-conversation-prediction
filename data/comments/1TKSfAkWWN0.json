If they do exist it would actually explain a \nnumber of things, such as why electric charge is quantized as integer \nmultiples of some basic charge unit, as was shown by dirac in the 20s.\n\nYou can also prove that since electric monopoles obviously exist(electric \ncharge), magnetic monopoles must have strengths that are integer multiples \nof some minimal value, which turns out to be absolutely huge. So if there's \na stable magnetic monopole somewhere, extracting it with a magnet should be \nvery easy and detection should be straightforward... which is also why \nwe're so sure that there aren't any on earth or on any place we've visited.\n\nBut the theoretical consequences of magnetic monopoles existing are so \nimportant that scientists are still actively looking for them.

Special \nRelativity emerged from two experimental observations:\n\nThe speed of light (a.k.a.c) is independent from the speed of its source. \nWhen you wait for a train, the speed of the light arriving from a \nstationary street lamp equals the speed of the light arriving from the \nheadlight of an approaching train.\n\nAll inertial frames are equivalent. There is no such thing as absolute \nmotion or absolute rest.\n\nConstant c appears to violate conservation of energy because the train does \nwork on the light - in effect, giving it a shove - without effect. \nFortunately, the resulting blue shift balances the books. E = h/lambda and \nall that.\n\nNow let's build a clock from a 5 foot stick and two perfect, flat mirrors. \n(Gedanken laboratories have a awesome stockrooms.) Set the pole vertically \nand attach a mirror to each end. The result will resemble an extremely tall \n[. Now, bounce a light pulse vertically between the mirrors. As the pulse \nbounces up and down, it measures 5 nanoseconds each way, giving us a \ngreat-grandfather clock whose pendulum has a.10 ns period. \n\nNow let's don our running shoes and sprint past the clock. Instead of \ntraveling up and down, the light zigzags between the moving mirrors \n(inertial frames, remember?) So the clock appears to run slower. Bingo, \ntime dilation.\n\nShrinking distance is related, but we have to orient the clock horizontally \nand run past it. I need paper and pencil to explain further. Maybe I can \npost a picture.",

The EMF is the cause of the current and the acceleration. It is \nalso the cause of the equal spacing. You wrote about an equal acceleration \nbut never the cause of it.\n\nIf the electrons would bunch up somewhere the EMF would not be uniform \nacross the entire circuit. Hence no uniform current.\n\nF = ma so an equal force across the entire circuit relative to the at rest \nframe would keep an equal spacing for the electrons.

That's just not how special relativity works.\"\nHowever, they do contract because they are moving.\n\nSaying that the EMF is the uniform across the circuit is exactly the same \nas saying the acceleration of each electron is the same (on average). \n(which is true in a uniformly flowing current which we are using here).\n\nWhy? F = ma\n\nHowever, no one is going to understand why the acceleration is uniform \nunless they understand that the EMF is uniform.

They were talking about the electron's frame.\"\n\nThe electrons wouldn't be contracted in the electron's frame. No object \nwould be contracted in their own frame. The electrons were contracted \nrelative to the initial frame because they were moving in the initial \nframe. This is why they were expanded in the other reference frame. There \nwas no \"charge buildup\" because there was X number of electrons in the wire \nand X number of protons AND the uniform EMF. The sources of the EMF were at \nrest with respect to the \"rest\" frame that's why that frame was special.\n\nYou are STILL completely missing the point I was making that all the \nelectrons in the circuit are experiencing the same EMF hence the SAME \nacceleration (again EMF = Electromotive Force = ma). The electrons stay \nevenly spread because charge cannot build up in one spot and/or the EMF is \nthe same through the length of the wire. Really those two are stating the \nsame thing as a charge buildup would cause a non-uniform EMF. The electrons \ndo contract but AGAIN the uniform EMF across the whole circuit keeps the \nelectrons evenly spaced. The electrons want to stay equal distances apart \nand equally close to the positive charges. The uniform EMF would mean \nuniform acceleration. Again F=ma and EMF = a force. A uniform EMF is \nrequired for a uniform current.\n\n\"Rigid simply refers to solid objects with particles that are naturally \nseparated by some constant distance due to forces between them. Yes, \nthey're not actually perfectly rigid. But two unbound particles, and two \nbound particles, is a perfectly valid physical distinction. Bound particles \nwill attain their natural separation in their own rest frame due to the \nequivalence of frames. Unbound particles do not. Once again, go look up \nBell's paradox and don't reply until you've understood it.\"\n\nThe electrons ARE bound within the wire by the electric field in the wire \n(hence they effectively keep a set distance apart from each other). The \nsources of that electric field are at rest with respect to the \"rest \nframe.\" Electrons ARE kept a distance apart due to forces between them (and \nkept in the wire by attraction to the positive charges). Again your concept \nof rigid body makes no sense. I hate when anyone ever tries to talk about \n\"rigid bodies.\" It's not even an accurate distinction but I do know it is \nused. Again the special thing about the \"rest frame\" is that the leads \ncreating the EMF aren't moving. Are you ignoring that point? \n\nYou are confusing \"rigid body\" with particles experiencing forces \noriginating completely within their own reference frame (or close to it) \nand \"non-rigid bodies\" with particles experiencing forces originating \noutside their own reference frame or relative to another \"at rest\" \nreference frame. I can think of many examples where your idea simply does \nnot work. What has to be bound with what? The Earth keeps a fairly \nconsistent distance from the Sun are we bound? One galaxy orbits another \nand may keep a consistent distance does that mean everything in that galaxy \nis \"bound?\" Does that make these objects \"rigid?\"\n\nIn this case the force experienced by the electrons is centered on a \nanother reference frame. All the electrons are accelerating relative to \nthat reference frame and not their own. Did I ever state anything \ndifferent? If objects are accelerating the same way relative to another \nreference frame then their distances apart will remain the same relative to \nthat (and only that) reference frame.\n\n\"\"If I am in one of two spaceships one light year apart and I am moving \nwith the other at speed X the length of my spaceship AND the distance \nbetween the spaceship would contract relative to an at rest frame.

If there \nwas an acceleration occurring relative to the at rest reference frame it \nwould be wrong. You CANNOT tell which reference frame is moving and I never \nmentioned any acceleration. AGAIN the reason the video is correct is the \nuniform EMF = an acceleration. That uniform EMF is relative to the rest \nframe. That's why that ONE frame doesn't experience a magnetic force but \nall others do.\n\n\"No I'm not. I'm stating a consequence of what you said.

It's like you know you're wrong but continue to argue anyway. \nDon't write me back until you understand Bell's paradox and you can explain \nhow electrons are appearing out of nowhere.\"\n\nWhat consequences? If there is an acceleration caused by sources AT REST \nrelative to the \"rest\" frame then the electrons would experience the same \nacceleration to each other in that frame. They would STILL contract in \nlength but would keep the same distance from one another. I never said \nanything different.

What have I been pounding into the ground for awhile? There's a \nuniform EMF. Simply put your completely confusing what I have said.\n\nThe electrons DO contract as anything that moves contracts. The distance \nbetween them doesn't because the acceleration is relative to the \"at rest\" \nframe. \n\nFatter shorter guys evenly spaced can have the same density as skinnier \ntaller guys evenly spaced. The guys are evenly spaced BECAUSE of the \nuniform EMF. The EMF can only be uniform because of the interactions \nbetween the positive and negative charges.

Therefore the electrons ARE contracted in that \nframe. More precisely their fields are contracted (since no real surface of \nan electron has ever been found).\n\n2) Both the positive charges AND the negative charges are experiencing the \nsame EMF (or electric field AKA voltage within and parallel to the wire). \nThe positive and negative fields will therefore experience the same but \nopposite forces. \n\n3) Direct current in a wire is caused by BOTH the positive and the negative \nfields contorting and effectively drifting in opposite directions. Current \ncan be thought of as moving in either direction (just switching the sign of \nthe current) and only one charge needs to completely drift from one atom to \nanother (otherwise the current would not be continuous). This is because \nthey both experience the same EMF. This is why the positive and negative \ncharges are evenly spread out. The equal EMF experienced by the positive \nand negative charges demands it. If this wasn't true the positive charges \nwould pull on the electrons until it was true because of the imbalance.\n\nThe special thing about the \"stationary\" frame is that the positive and \nnegative leads are at rest with it. The net effect is neutral on BOTH \ncharges. Effectively there is an equal and opposite current of each charge. \nWHY? Because the EQUAL AND OPPOSITE EMF experienced by the charges (which \nis stationary in that frame) demands it.\n\n4) If the electrons were attached to a rigid beam a certain distance apart \nand they passed another beam with rigidly connected protons then there \nwould be an effect even when the cation was still.\n\nThe electrons DO experience a contraction when the cation isn't moving. \nSimply put there wouldn't be any magnetic field when the cation moved if \nthis wasn't true. This is always true: ANY moving object experiences \ncontraction relative to the stationary frame. Again it is the EQUAL EMF \nthat causes the effectively equal response by the charges.\n\nPLEASE explain how a moving object doesn't experience contraction?\n\nFurthermore please explain how if the positive charges weren't present and \nboth charge types weren't experiencing the same EMF how the electrons would \nautomatically spread themselves out again such that the charge was neutral \nin the \"stationary\" frame?\n\nIt is clearly the equal EMF on BOTH charges that keeps the stationary frame \nneutral and it has nothing to do with relativity. There is something \nspecial about that reference frame and special relativity by itself NEVER \nmakes any inertial reference frame special.  ",

That's simply not \ntrue.\n\n1) All current is caused by an EMF AKA an electromotive force AKA a voltage \ndifference AKA an electric field parallel to the conducting wire. In all \nthese cases what is simply meant is an electric field is in the wire and \nparallel to the current. Without an electric field parallel with the wire \nno current would flow. Charge never moves without a force acting on it. The \nonly force here is the electric field.\n\nThat is  \n\nPOSITIVE          current             current              current         \n      NEGATIVE \n\nA positively charged current will flow from the positively charged lead to \nthe negatively charged lead just like a negatively charged current will \nflow from the negatively charge lead to the positively charged lead (yes, I \nknow that it's actually setup opposite but this is for simplicity). Why? \nBecause the positively charged field will experience an equal and opposite \nEMF to that of the negative field. This equal and opposite force requires \nan equal and opposite reaction. That's one of Newton's laws.\n\nBut how is this possible if positive nuclei aren't actually moving? It is \npossible via psuedo-particles. This is the same reasoning as to how holes \nexist in semiconductors and they can move and electrically act like \npositrons even though no particle exists. The holes are just empty spots on \na positive background. Also how phonons can transfer sound energy in solids \nwithout the \"particle\" phonon truly existing in the typical sense. The \npsuedo-positrons will have length contraction just like electrons will \n(call it the pronon). In terms of the electric field at least the \"pronons\" \nare very real.\n\nUnder an Electromotive force from a positive lead to a negative lead there \nwill be as much push for positive charge to move as negative charge. The \nfield will shift such that the positive field is effectively moving say \nright while the negative is moving left. The shifts will be equal because \nBOTH charge types are experiencing the same EMF. As long as at least one \ncharge type can move it doesn't matter which charge \"actually\" moves. \nBesides the fields ARE moving and influenced by the EMF (even if the \nparticle producing the field is stationary as fields can contort, stretch, \nand squeeze around a source). This is why scientists could screw up the \ndirection of current for so long (is there a neg flowing right or a pos \nflowing left? The signs are still \"backwards\"). In many ways it simply does \nnot matter.\n\nIf the situation occurred where electrons were on a conveyor belt or a \nnegatively charge rod was flying past a stationary positively charged rod \nthen yes the \"cat-ion\" would be attracted to the rods. (therefore the \nreasoning that the total charge is \"neutral\" isn't valid). The reason the \ncharge densities are neutral in a wire is that the electrons and protons \nexperience the same EMF. ",

                    "text": "+Neil Fachon I had to think about this one for a while. You are correct in \nsaying that the electrons are contracted while the cat is stationary. This \ncontraction is extremely small. The electrons are moving at 0.0000000001 % \nthe speed of light. The lorentz transformation is an equation that relates \nrest length to contracted length relative to an observer. The \ntransformation (lets call it L) is (1-v^2/c^2)^1/2.  v is the velocity, c \nis the speed of light.  If you want the contracted length of an object, \njust take its rest length and multiple it by the lorentz transformation to \nget its contracted length... Length contracted=(Rest length)(lorentz \ntransformation). When v is small, the lorentz transformation is \n.99999999999. So its contracted length is hardly noticeable. \nThe electrons flowing in the current ARE contracted, but the contraction is \nso small that the cat doesn't feel it. \n\nFlowing electrons create a magnetic field. The magnetic field is almost \nentirely responsible for repelling the cat. I say almost, because the \nelectrons are contracted which creates a very tiny electric force. But this \nforce is unbelievably small that you wouldn't notice it. \n\n\nWhen the cat and observer are moving, the force repelling the cat is still \nalmost entirely magnetic. But since the cat and observer are moving, there \nis a tiny fraction (ever so slightly bigger than when it was stationary) \nthat is electric. This is because the cat is moving with the electric \ncharge. I'm sure you understand by know why the protons are contracted (at \nthese low speeds its hardly noticeable but still happens). But the \nelectrons seem to expand in this case because the cat is moving with the \nelectrons. This car analogy explains why the electrons are expanded:\n\nIgnore the opposite lane of traffic, just focus on the electrons and the \ncat moving relative to each other. You, the cat, are on the side of the \nroad parked and other cars are going passed you. Each car is equal distance \napart and travelling 70. The cars pass you at a certain frequency. Now say \nyou start traveling with the cars going half there speed. The amount of \ncars that pass you in a given time(t) is smaller than when you stopped. If \nyou go 60, over the same interval of time, even a smaller number of cars \npass you up. As you flow with the cars, the amount of cars you interact \nwith decreases.\nWhen the cat is flowing with the electrons, not as many electrons are \nflowing passed him as they were when he was stationary.  So when he flows \nwith the electrons, he interacts with a smaller number of electrons than \nwhen he was stationary. \n\nSince the cat is moving, he interacts with slightly more protons and \nslightly less electrons than when he was stationary. This does create a \ntiny electric force, slightly bigger than the electric force from when it \nwas stationary, that repels the cat.\n\nWhen the cat is moving, the forces responsible for repelling the cat depend \non the observer. The net force due to the wire on the moving cat is the \nsame for both observers, whether they are moving or stationary. The \nstationary observer would see a magnetic force repelling the cat. The \nobserver moving with the cat would see a slightly smaller magnetic force \ncompared to the stationary observer, and a slightly stronger electric force \nto compensate for this slight decrease in magnetic force. Both observers \nagree on the net force repelling the cat, but disagree on which forces \nrepel it. Because these speed are extremely low, you can assume its only \nmagnetic force and get a very accurate approximation.   ",

                    "text": "+Drake Thibodeaux Idk if that quite addresses my confusion. And Im not sure \nif that car analogy quite works because when stationary the cars in both \nlanes would be moving relative to you. If there always has to be a 1:1 \nratio between protons and electrons so you say, why is it there can appear \nto be more protons through length contraction but it is not possible for \ntheir to appear to be more electrons?\n\nTo put it another way, when the protons and electrons are both stationary \nwith no current, there is certainly a 1:1 ratio, but when the current is \npassed through the wire and the electrons begin to move, based on the \nprinciples of special relativity, they should be contracting. That fact \nthat they do not contract violates special relativity. When the cat starts \nto move in the direction of the electrons however, they begin to expand. \nHow can they expand in this situation but not contract? \n\nAlso, if the cat were to move in the opposite direction, the cat should be \nattracted towards the wire rather then being repelled. What would cause \nthis? The protons will be moving more in relativity to the cat and thus \nshould contract. But we know that when the protons contract the cat should \nbe forced away from the wire. Thus, the electrons must also be contracting, \nin this case they'd also have to be contracting more then the protons \notherwise there would still be a net repulsive force.",

They are \ncreatures who\u2014in their grudge against the traditional 'opium of the \npeople'\u2014cannot bear the music of the spheres.\" Although he did not believe \nin a personal God, he indicated that he would never seek to combat such \nbelief because \"such a belief seems to me preferable to the lack of any \ntranscendental outlook.\"\n\nIn another interview he also stated this: (Take note of his exact words - \n'I am not an atheist')\n\"Your question [about God] is the most difficult in the world. It is not a \nquestion I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not \nknow if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too \nvast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, \nno matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the \nposition of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered \nto the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that \nsomeone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does \nnot understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a \ndefinite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it \ndoes not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the \nattitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward \nGod. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we \nunderstand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the \nmysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by \nSpinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern \nthought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the \nfirst philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two \nseparate things.\" \n\nBut sure, keep being deluded enough to think that he must have had the same \nreligious views as you do.",

In electron frame \nprotons move to left so they are contracted and thus the cat is repelled. \nso if Cat moves with electrons it is repelled, if it moves with protons it \nis attracted; however, the video is correct if you assume the electrons \nmove such that there is one for every proton when moving (don't just all \nstart drifting). The issue lies in that electrons have to move such that \nthere is only one for every proton (if they weren't there would be a force \nforcing them to).

And \ny'all did a fantastic job, IMHO.\nThere WAS one logic fart, though: If you have a neutral wire and then start \npushing electrons through it, the positive cat would be attracted to it if \nit's not moving, because length contraction would affect the electron \ncurrent.\nThe way experimentalists deal with this problem is that they charge the \nwire very, very, very slightly positively after they start the current \nflowing. By testing to see how charges respond to the wire, they find the \nspot where the Lorentz force (total force due to electromagnetism) is zero.\nFantastic video. Explained it even better than my professors did.\ufeff",

                    "text": "This topic is really tricky to visualize. However, first think of how holes \nwork in a semiconductor. A missing electron or a \"hole\" in the electron sea \nof the semiconductor acts like a positron (at least electrically). Now \napply a current to that semiconductor and the holes will want to drift to \none side of the semiconductor (because the \"hole\" is positive) and the \nelectrons to the other. This is a case where the ONLY real thing moving is \nthe electrons but there is a current flowing in either direction. No need \nfor the positive nuclei to move at all.\n\nIn an electrical wire (with direct current) an electrical field is applied \nparallel to the wire. That is there is a positive lead to a battery and a \nnegative lead. One lead has a \"positive\" electric field and the other \n\"negative.\" Now the interesting fact about current is that if either the \npositive charges or the negative charges or both are free to move you will \nget a current in BOTH directions. That is you will get a negative charge \nflow in one direction and a positive charge flow in the other. (the thing \nto remember is that the more \"free\" charges are to move by one another the \nlower the resistance; super conductors turn electron into bosonic Cooper \npairs that can pass through one another). \n\nYou may ask \"how is there a current in the other direction if there aren't \nany positive charges moving?\" Well the negative charges moving by a \npositive background look like electrons going by in one direction and \npseudo positive particles going in the other. This is a similar pseudo \nparticle phenomena to that of electron holes or phonons which transfer \nsound energy in solids. \n\nElectrons may want to travel from 100 volts to zero because of the electric \nfield that exists because of the voltage difference but the positive \ncharges will then have the same force on them making them want to travel \nfrom the zero to the 100 volts (yes, for simplicity I switched the signs). \nThe negative fields will be shifting to the right while the positive fields \nto the left. Both fields will experience equal but opposite forces so they \nwill both move.  \n\nElectricity is all about the electric field. A current can be started just \nby pushing the electron's electrical field to the right a little and the \nproton's will then go to the left a little (you can do this over many \natoms). The ONLY reason electrons need to flow is that direct current \nrequires that the fields be pushed in one direction continuously. \nEventually the electrons will be pushed off one atom and travel onto the \nnext while a \"phantom\" positron charge will do the same in the opposite \ndirection. For this to work only ONE charge carrier needs to move. Both the \nphantom positron and the electron will have the same length contraction \nunder relativity. No one has ever found anything solid about the electron \nand the thing that \"contracts\" is the electrical field. The positive \nelectrical field is moving just as fast as the negative electrical field \nbut in the opposite direction since the positive and negative charges are \nexperiencing the same EMF (electromotive force AKA voltage or electrical \nfield down the wire).\n\n\nHere is a visual. If the background is positive and the electrons are \ncompelled to move right because of an EMF then:\n\nnegatively charge lead -   -   -   -   - ----   -  -  -  -  ----   -   -  - \n ----   + charged lead\n\nSo as shown above the electric field of each electron will bunch to the \nright and become less strong on the left. Those clumps will want to move to \nthe right. However the positive fields will do the following:\n\n  negative lead            ++++  +   +   +  ++++   +  +  +++++  +  +   +   \nPositive lead\n\nTo an observer only looking at the electrical field there is a positive \ncurrent moving to the left and a negative to the right. I personally \nderived the equation F = qE + qvXB using the Relativistic Doppler Shift \nEquation for all angles replacing F (frequency) with E (electric field) \n[there is a clear reason why I did and could do that but it would take time \nto explain] and the Relativistic velocity addition equation (V = (v1 + \nv2)/(1+v1v2/c^2). Much math later.... and F = qE + qvXB pops out.\n\nA full understanding of the Relativistic Doppler Shift Equation shows how \nelectric fields change with different velocities (and how the field \npropagates outward from the source at the speed of light). There's a \nrelativistic twisting effect, a relativistic velocity addition effect, a \nspace contraction effect, and a red-shifting effect in that equation. The \nfields moving are what matter not the fact that the electrons as a particle \nare moving or that the protons as a particle aren't moving. Fields carry \nforce!\n\n(In reality I used the Relativistic Doppler Shift Equation to derive the \nRelativistic velocity addition equation which creates a very simple picture \nof the process).",

                    "text": "+gozags65\nI thought about this for a while and originally came to the conclusion that \nif the current is constant, yes the magnetic fields would be stationary, \nbut this would only be true in the \"radial dimension\" or that it is to say \nthere would be no \"perpendicular to the wire\"-movement of the magnetic \nfield lines from each current element. That is to say the magnetic field \nwould neither expand nor contract.\n\nHowever, if we are to believe that the magnetic force is equivalent to the \nspecial relativistic effect described in the video, then it follows that \nfor equal numbers of positive and negative charge moving in equal, but \nopposite directions, the length contraction from both will compensate for \neach other, and the wire would remain neutral, and thus no magnetic force.\n\nHowever, I know that when opposite charges move in opposite velocities, \nco-linearly, both will generate the same direction of magnetic field on a \ntest charge, because the converse, where opposite charges move in the same \ndirection, the magnetic forces on the test charge should be cancelled if \nthe charges are equal and opposite and move together at the same velocity, \nor equivalently, a neutral charge moving through space.\n\nSo in the case where a test charge is in a frame of reference where there \nare opposite charges moving in opposite velocities, there should be a net \nmagnetic field, coming from both of them, which add together at the \nlocation of the test charge. Now, if the length contraction effect from the \npositive set of charges and the negative set of charges compensate for each \nother exactly, the corresponding magnetic forces onto the test charge from \nthe negative and the positive charges should cancel. But if there is no \nmagnetic force despite there being a magnetic field, then this can only \nmean that there is no passing of flux through that test charge. That is to \nsay that in the frame of reference of that test charge, the magnetic field \nlines are completely stationary. However, if magnetic fields are completely \nstationary in the frame of reference of that the test charge, then how can \nit be that the magnetic field lines are also stationary in the frame of \nreference of either the positive charges or negative charges?\n\nNow of course, let's say for a moment that this were true then, that the \nmagnetic field lines were stationary in the frame of reference of that test \ncharge I talked about. That charge does not experience any net magnetic \nforce and yet that charge is in motion relative to the wire, which we can \nsay consists of the positive metal ions. This implies that other charges \nwhich are stationary to the wire will experience a magnetic force. However, \nthe drift velocity of the negative charges in a wire is actually very \nsmall, except in some very extreme applications, so we should expect the \n\"parallel to the wire\"-movement of the field lines to be small as well. So \nit is easy to think that the magnetic field lines of a constant current do \nnot move in the frame of reference of the wire, even if it stands true that \nthey move at some velocity half the of the average electron flow velocity.\n\nBut what is parallel to the wire is also perpendicular to magnetic field \nlines from the current in that wire, which means that in the frame of \nreference of the positive metal ions (the frame of reference of the wire), \neach magnetic field loop around the wire moves in the direction normal to \narea it encloses. The result, from what it appears, is a magnetic force on \nthe charge that is conceptually interchangeable with an electric field from \neach charge that contracts due to relative velocity. *Provided that there \nno other charges in the system*, such an electric field will points towards \nor away from the wire in the radial direction. *However, if there is other \ncharge in the system, such as that embedded in dielectric materials*, this \nwill mean that the dielectric surrounding this wire will become polarized, \nthus countering the electric field around wire. But since the dielectric \nresponse cannot be instantaneous, an electric field can therefore exist for \na moment in time when the dielectric material has not completely canceled \nthis electric field. Interestingly, this then implies that if the \npolarizable medium is too tenuous to cover this electric field, such as \nwhat can occur in a vacuum consisting of very sparse plasma, then the \nelectric field can last for a much longer time.\n\nHowever, since I'm sure most measurements of the electric field from a wire \nof a constant current have been conducted when there is a polarizable \ndielectric medium, such as the electrical insulation, or the air in the \ntest room, it should be easy to see then why magnetic field lines around a \nconstant current are, as you say, observed to be stationary, and this will \nbe true not only for \"perpendicular to the wire\"-movement of the magnetic \nfield lines, but also \"parallel to the wire\"-movement of the magnetic field \nlines.",

What you \nstated as shown below proves this.\n\n \"because if we compress electrons they will just force themselves apart\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"but the protons still bound them from wandering off away from the wire.\"\n\nTrue BUT the protons AND the electrical leads are at rest relative to the \nrest frame. You just proved the point I made before. The electrons are \nspreading themselves out equally relative to the rest frame. \n\nIF an ENTIRE bound system flies off at a high speed THEN the distances \nbetween the particles will contract. However, in the case of a wire the \nforces bounding the electrons are at rest relative to the \"at rest\" frame. \nThe electrons will evenly spread themselves out over the length of the \nstring of the \"at rest\" protons comprising the wire. What do you not \nunderstand about this?\n\nThe above will ensure that the wire is neutral in the \"at rest\" frame. The \nunique thing about the \"at rest\" frame is that the string of protons AND \nthe electrical leads are at rest relative to it. Therefore this reference \nframe is unique (relative to the system) and has no magnetic forces.\n\n\nNow onto the next problem. These two should be a given by now:\n\nThe electrons are moving in the ground state.\n\nAlso the charges cancel in the ground state. \n\nI showed these already multiple times.\n\nThe reason the magnetic force arises is because of the velocity addition \nformula in relativity and length contraction due to relativity.\n\nClassically: v1 + v2 = Total V\n\nWalking 2MPH forward on a cruise ship going 20MPH means you are going 22MPH.\n\nRelativity: (v1+ v2)/(1+v1v1/c^2) = Total V\n\nThe above is due to relativity.\n\nI can't make this any more simple than the two equations above. IMPORTANT \nPART: they aren't the same. \n\nThis means that although the charges cancel in the \"rest frame\" in the \nmoving frame the electrons and protons will contract different amounts.\n\nFor example: if the \"cat-ion\" is moving with the electrons the contraction \nwill be a little different for the electrons than for the protons.\n\nElectrons: (ve + V)/(1+veV/c^2) = Total\n\nProtons: V = Total\n\nWhen moving with the electrons the electrons will spread out, the protons \nwill contract, and the cat-ion will repel.\n\nWhen moving opposite to the electrons the electrons will contract MORE than \nthe protons (both contract) because of the velocity addition equation and \nthe \"Cat-ion\" will attract.\n\nWhen \"at rest\" the electrons AND the protons will be equally spaced because \nthe string of protons AND the leads are at rest in that frame. The \nelectrons will therefore spread themselves evenly relative to that frame.",

They aren't pointing in the same direction \nand they aren't the same distance apart (AKA magnitude or strength).\n\nYes, a changing magnetic field does induce an electric current. A changing \nmagnetic field WILL cause a force. That is one of Maxwell's equations. That \nequation is:\n\nDel X E = \"rate of change of the B field with respect to time\"\n\nA changing B field will create a curling E field (a spinning current). \n\nIt will take force to pass a conductor (say a coil) through two magnets \nbecause the magnets will induce a current in the wire (which takes energy). \nThis is how an electric generator works. A magnet attracts a piece of metal \nwithout its own field by inducing currents in that metal. Those currents \nthen create their own magnetic field.\n\nIn a case such as two coils that have a current forming electromagnets \nthere's a loop of current. You can think of it this way: the charges in the \nother loop want to rotate around the first magnet's field lines BUT the \ncharges are moving and already continuously changing direction because they \nare traveling in a fixed LOOP (or spinning or have intrinsic spin like \natoms). That continuous circular motion constantly adjusts the charge's \ndirection of motion in both coils. This changing direction cancels out the \nrelativistic \"twisting\" effect. The magnetic fields of the two coils WILL \nattempt to induce a current in the other coil. If they cannot they will \nrepel. \n\nSo a uniform magnetic field will cause charges to spin around a field line. \nHowever, a magnetic pole which is caused by a loop of current (or many \nloops like a solenoid) has charges constantly adjusting their direction \nsuch that the force is ALWAYS towards or away (if lined up exactly with \nanother pole). \n\nInside a solenoid (or between to like poles) the charges definitely spin \naround the field lines because the field has a uniform strength.

Subatomic particles act like little \nelectromagnets with an intrinsic current caused by their intrinsic spin and \ncharge. There are tons of little current loops in a bar magnet formed by \natoms and there are fewer but larger current loops in most electromagnets. \nSpecial relativity and Maxwell's Laws work on all magnets. Special \nrelativity merged with quantum mechanics derives the equations governing \n\"intrinsic magnetic moments\" for particles.\n\n\"cat moved at the same speed but in the opposite direction?\"\n\nThe contraction would be equal but opposite. That is the electrons would do \nwhat the protons did in the video and the protons would do what the \nelectrons did. The Cation would move towards the wire.\n\n\"And why isn't the field drawn like an electric field, with the arrows \npointing outward instead of a circle around it?\"\n\nWell magnetic field lines aren't really a \"thing.\" They represent the \nrelativistic effects of an electric field. In reality a particle wants to \nspin around a magnetic field via the equation F = qvXB. There is an entire \nrelativistic effect not mentioned in the video at all which is a \nrelativistic twisting (expressed by the X which means \"cross product\"). \nObjects don't just contract as they move relative to another reference \nframe but they also twist.  \n\nSay the below is the wire doing the same thing as the video (where the \nelectrons are moving to the right but the charge density for a stationary \ncharge is neutral):\n\n++++++++++++++++\n--------------------------------\n\nA positive charge moving to the right would repel. One to the left would \nattract. That should make sense now. However, what about towards the wire \nand away from it? Well towards the wire via relativity and the \"right hand \nrule\" it would move to the right and away from it it would move to the \nleft. This is because of the twisting effect of relativity. If the magnetic \nfield is strong enough and the speed just right the charge will orbit \naround the magnetic field lines! This is why the field lines form circles \naround the wire. Regardless of the direction the charge is going when it \napproaches a wire at some speed v it will experience a force perpendicular \nto its direction of travel.\n\nIf mv^2/r = qvB you can orbit the magnetic field lines. Or mv/(qr) = B. *This \nis why the magnetic field is drawn as it is so this spinning around can be \neasily handled*.\n\nIn particle physics particles will make neat looking circular loops in \nmagnetic fields. The charge doesn't just repel as shown in the video \nbecause as soon as it starts moving away it changes direction which changes \nthe force the particle experiences (which then changes its direction). The \nEarth's and the Sun's magnetic fields do the same thing. Take the twisted \nfield lines usually found in/by sunspots and prominences. The plasma \n(charged particles) of the Sun will tightly spin around the field lines \ntightly outlining them. The Earth's magnetic field will get high speed \ncharged particles spinning around its field lines with many spinning \ntowards the north or south poles. If the field wasn't present they would \njust crash head on into the Earth. \n\nIn reality a constant B field does NOT increase the velocity of a charge \n(that is cause it to accelerate away only an E field [or a changing B field \nwhich creates an E field] does that) but rather it changes its direction! \nMinutephysics over simplified this topic.",

                    "text": "+Donald Timpson Here I will give you a visual.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect\n\nThe above is the relativistic Doppler Shift which deals with frequency \nwhile fields deal with force. However, the general effect is the same.\n\nWithout going into the more crazy quantum field theory and other advanced \ntheories you can think of the E field as the following:\n\nE = kq/r^2 = q/(4 PI Epsilion r^2)\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is 4 PI r^2\n\nA field of a point charge can be thought of as a series of spheres \nemanating from the central point (again without the more advanced \ntheories). This is why the Force drops off as r^2 because the spheres grow \nas 4PI r^2. The 4 PI is just merged with the constant k. The spheres have \nequal total flux but as their surface area grows the flux in a small region \ndrops off as 1/r^2\n \nThe Relativistic Doppler Effect is also caused by spheres emanating from a \npoint.\n\nThe third diagram helps visualize what happens to the field as it passes at \nhigh speed (even though that one is set to frequency while we are looking \nfor force). A particle moving at high speed will have a magnetic field \ncircling it in a ring perpendicular to its direction of travel. Charged \nparticles will want to curl around that magnetic field line. Do you see how \nthe sphere curled like a doughnut as it was passing the observer? That's a \nnearly perfect analogy to a magnetic field. This near perfect analogy isn't \nan accident as the electric and magnetic fields are mediated by photons. \nThe magnetic field is this curling of the electric field. The electric \nfield is VERY strong (with most of its force equalized out) so it doesn't \ntake that much curling of the field to create a decent sized electric field.\n\nNote the equation F = qvXB\n\nThis formula means that a charge will curl around field lines and actually \ntravel in circles.\n\nmv^2/r = qvB  means that the size of the circle is:\n\nr = mv/(q B) if B is constant.\n\nTo take the analogy further the electric field also Doppler Shifts (in a \nway). A charge going towards an electric field will drop r faster so the \nforce rapidly increases (like a blue shift). While flying away from a \ncharge r increases faster dropping the force fast (red shifting). The \ndifference is that the field strength cares about the total flux hitting \none spot while the Doppler Shift of light cares about frequency shifts. \n\nThe electric is just spheres of flux emanating from a point charge with the \nalterations to the sphere caused by special relativity. Those alterations \nare what we perceive as the magnetic field.\n\nAnother way to understand why the charge travels in circles is with the \nvideo clip. Yes the cat-ion will fly away from the wire for an.... instant. \nHowever, as soon as it starts moving away it changes direction. With that \nnew direction is a new force which is slightly less away. Now it will move \nin a new direction but this will change the force. The cat-ion will end up \nspinning around in a circle. With a constant B field a charge will not \nincrease velocity just change direction.\n\nBoth positive and negative charges cause curling of the electric field in \nthe same way just that they will cause charges to spin in opposite \ndirections.",

My physics book simply tells me that it creates a \nmagnetic field, and how to calculate the strength/direction. What it \ndoesn't do is give me an intuitive reason of why this is the case. The \nexplanation given by this video for how a magnetic field is generated by a \ncurrent in a wire makes perfect sense, but I'm trying to understand how an \nattractive magnetic field is generated between two protons, or as you put \nit, how an electric force is weaker between two protons when they're moving \nin the same direction vs opposite.",

The effect \nyou explained is important to understand why a charge in rest in a magnetic \nfield (so it won't feel any force), produced by a current in a neutral \nwire, , will also feel no net force in any other inertial frame of \nreference. When you change to a frame of reference in which the charge is \nmoving relative to you, it will feel a magnetic force, of course, but the \nincrease in the charge density produces just the right electric field so to \ncancel the magnetic force that appears.\nYou can understand how magnets work when you look at how wires respond to a \nmagnetic field. If their current run in the same direction, they attract, \notherwise they repel, this has nothing to do with what happens when you \nchange your frame of reference.\nNow permanent magnets have a relativistic explanation indeed, rel. quantum \nmechs introduces a term of coupling between spin and magnetic fields that \nis the origin of attraction of materials with a lot of alligned spins, like \niron.\nI'm sorry I got so technical, but it is important that people knowthat \nalthough this effect is real, it is not the explanation for magnets.\ufeff",

Suppose you happen to be in a \nframe of ref in which a wire is neutral, with a current passing on it (as \nyou've seen in the video, it won't be neutral in other frames of ref). \nRemember that a current in a wire produces a magnetic field. Now consider a \nparticle at rest, say a few centimeters from the wire. There is no electric \nfield there, and its speed is zero, so there is no force on the charge \n(remember F=qE+vxB). Alright, now let's look as the same situation from an \nobserver moving parallel to the wire.\nNaive assumption: Oh no! now the chage has a speed and there is a magnetic \nfield there, the charge will feel a net force, thus it will accelerate \ntowards the wire! How can it hit the wire in one frame of ref. and no in \nthe other? Well... it can't and it turns out that as you change from one \nframe to the other the wire is not neutral anymore, and as a consequence it \nproduces an electric field that will balance the magnetic force in the \nexact way so that everything is ok. The reason for this is because \neletromagnetism is a relativistic theory, therefore changing from one frame \nto the other should keep the physics the same.",

There is no special relativity occurring in \na solid magnet - i laughed because the show basically proves himself wrong \nby coming up with two explanations for magnetism. But, to be fair, he is a \ngood presenter and it did get my curiosity sparked to research this topic.\n\nStill though WishDragon, not sure what you have against black holes.  There \nare tons of experiments for you to look at.  Magnetism has very little to \ndo with black holes, just like general relativity has little to do with \nmagnetism. \n\nBlack holes naturally don't emit light, but we CAN detect the energy from \nsuns that are being compressed back into the blackhole: this releases a ton \nof very high particle waves.  We can also detect the gravitational shift on \nlight passing by - so we know how much mass the object has.  Basically, \nthere seems to be this massive amount of mass in the center of most \ngalaxies along with a peppering of smaller ones throughout it.  We can see \nthem gobble up matter and release an incredible amounts of energy and we \ncan see the way they distort light.  Light is affected by gravity.  massive \nobjects have gravity.  So much mass would crush any physical structure. \n This is well known - large suns collapse into black holes once they end up \nwith iron at their core and fusion power is terminated.  The 'energy' that \nwas keeping the sun from 'inploding' runs out (fusion ends at iron) and the \nsheer gravity of the sun crushes itself.  Pretty cool.\n\nBtw, the next 'big gravity thing' is a neutron star - which is also damn \ncool.  A ball some 10  to 20km in diameter composed of elements in the \nupper crust and dissociated atoms deeper within.  Basically showing that \ngravity trumps all - it can dissociate atoms = that's a LOT of energy. \n What makes you think gravity can't collapse the electromagnetic / nuclear \nforce into a single point?

                    "text": "Special Relativity? Really?... not so sure.\n\nForgive me if i oversimplify to show the concept:\n\nFirst Current : Batteries are nothing more than a two 'areas/cells' with \ndifferent charges.  The Negative side that chemically wants to Release \nElectrons, and the Positive side that chemically wants to Take Electrons. \n When the circuit is closed, the electrons in the negative side start to \nmove towards the positive side.  It's not quite like A goes to Z though - \nmore like en masse: one electron moves from A to C and another from B to D, \nC to M, more or less - they go from electronegative hole to electronegative \nhole always flowing towards the positive 'vacuum'.  Also they don't move \nlinearly like, say a bullet.  More like a wave - they phase in and out - \nbut overall they are statistically 'moving' towards the positive side.\n\nSo visualize this circuit as a magnet - it has a positive side and a \nnegative side - When the circuit is closed, the electrons in that circuit \nare perfectly lined up towards the positive side : that is to say : all the \nelectron spins are lined up - and because they are ALL doing it the \nmagnetic field from the spins gets amplified.  Electrons btw, have two \nspins - up and down.\n\nAny time something is able to line up the electron spins, it gets magnified \nand creates a magnetic field.  electrons lined up = magnetic field. \n\nPut a solid magnet next to the circuit, and viola, the positive side of the \nmagnet lines up with the net negative charge in the battery - The magnet \nhas a magnetic field because the electron spins inside of it are lined up \nin the same direction.  In a current the electrons are also lined up in the \nsame way as long as there is a power source with a net negative side and a \nnet positive side.  The 'field' appears when electrons line up.  The more \nenergy in the battery, the more electrons line up - thus a stronger \nmagnetic field.\n\ne- >------------------------> p+  (flow of current) (e-= negative / p+ = \npositive)\n            P <M> N                           (magnet)           \n(p=positive / N=negative)\n\nNeodymium is another cool example of electron spin creating a magnetic \nfield.   Neodymium forms a tetragonal crystal structure ((Nd2Fe14B)) where \nthe electron spins permanently line up.  The rather strong magnetic field \nof Neodymium is due to an unusually high number of electrons having the \nsame spin = the more electrons line up the stronger the magnet. \n\n\nReview:\n1) PERMANENT MAGNETS: Ok so now we know that permanent magnets have two \npoles because the electrons in the structure are lined up - UP (north) DOWN \n(south) and because so many electrons do it, the magnetic force amplifies. \n The stronger the magnet, the more electrons are lined up.  \n\n2) CURRENTS:  We also know that the reason currents become magnetic is \nbecause the electrons line up with the polarity of the power source as they \ngo from net negative to net positive.  The stronger the current, the more \nelectrons line up and the stronger magnetic field.\n\n3) MAGNETS AND CURRENTS:\nOk - if you drag a magnet through a coil of copper, you are magnetically \ndragging electrons in that direction; electrons being 'dragged' is the same \nas a current.  Yes it's essentially that simple.  As they move, they line \nup, creating a field.  That's all a generator does, it drags electrons \nthough a coil and creates a surge of electrons. The positive side of the \nmagnet attracts electrons and drags them through the coils - the more Coil \nSpins, the move the electrons have to travel to keep up with the positive \nside of the magnet, and thus the more current.\n\nCONVERSELY\n\n4) CURRENTS AND MAGNETS:\nIf you run a current through a coil around a ferric metal, the electrons \nline up in the coil - the direct reaction on the metal is that the \nelectrons IN the metal also line up their spins, thus creating a magnetic \nfield.\n\nCONCLUSION\nSo, the way i see it, special relativity seems like an odd way to explain \nelectricity - i don't think relativity has anything to do with \nelectromagnetism.  It's just ELECTRON SPINS AMPLIFIED and, that i know, \nspins are not affected by special relativity.  Electrons don't move the \nright way 1/2 the time for relativity to affect them.  Crazy little \nelectrons - one of the most bizarre things in the quantum realm.  They can \nbehave as a particle AND they can behave as a wave.  Look at it, and it \nbehaves like a particle.  Don't look at it, it behaves as a wave \ninteracting with every single possibility of itself AND the infinite \npossibilities of other electrons until it has to pick one option.  Highly \nrecommend you check out the double slit electron experiment along with \nFaraday's Law and understand Maxwell's equations (maybe not in the math \nterms, but at least in concept)\n\nMagnetism is cool :)",

                    "text": "+Sasha Anikevich First I'll say that if you start with the assumption of a \nneutral wire with a current flowing in it, then all of Veritasium's logic \nis consistent with Special Relativity (Feynman goes through a similar \nderivation here: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_13.html#Ch13-S6) \ni.e. space itself does contract, not just objects.  I'm still not sure \nwhy starting a current in an originally neutral wire with no current \ndoesn't lead to a charged wire though.  Maybe Bell's spaceship paradox does \nthe trick.\n\nTo your questions more specifically.  An arc of electricity going through \nvacuum would definitely have an associated magnetic field and we can still \nget a positively charged cat to be either attracted or repelled depending \non its motion.  Let's start by imagining our beam of electrons travelling \nto the right relative to our stationary cat and the cat is positioned below \nthe beam.  The cat would be attracted to the beam by the electric field and \neven though there is a magnetic field, it doesn't affect the cat. \n\nNow lets say the cat starts moving to the right at the same speed as the \nelectrons.  From the lab frame there should now be a magnetic force pushing \nit away from the beam of electrons (beam creates magnetic field directed \nout of page, force is down from v X B) in addition to the attractive \nelectric force, so the net force on the cat is reduced.  From the cat's \nperspective the electrons are not moving, so there is no magnetic force.  \nBut jumping from the lab frame of reference to the cat's frame of \nreference, the non-moving electrons have to be more spread out than they \nwere in the lab frame.  This means the charge density is less leading to a \nsmaller electric force.  Even though in the cat's frame there is no \nmagnetic force, the net force is reduced just like it was in the lab frame.\n\nThere is still a problem if the cat is moving so fast (in the lab frame) \nthat the magnetic force is greater than the electric force, and hence \nthere's a net repulsive force on the cat.  But I don't see how you can ever \nget a repulsive force in the cat's frame of reference.  Even though the \nelectrons would be travelling to the left from the cat's perspective and \nhence the magnetic field would have its direction reversed, the cat is \nstill stationary and not subject to magnetic forces.\n\nConcerning your last question, if the electrons are moving faster, more of \nthem will pass \"a given point in a set amount of time\" right?  The \nelectrons are charge carriers, so increasing electron speed does increase \nthe current and the magnetic field.",

Do you mean different time \ndilations?\nOur planet is broken into about 24 time zones because it is round. Time \nzones have nothing to do with relativity.\n\n\"Different mass\" is inaccurate. Objects of mass or energy attract. The \ntotal amount of \"energy-mass\" matters in how much they attract not the \n\"difference in mass.\"\n\nTime is running slower on a massive object than it is running in deep \nspace. This does create an attraction. All matter or objects or things are \nmade out of fields so when an object approaches a gravity well the bottom \nof the object will be running slight slower through time than the top. This \ncreates a \"difference\" in field pressures for all objects sucking them \ntowards the massive object. This is kind of like how an airplane's wing has \nhigher pressure on the bottom and lower on top giving it lift.\n\nThe energy making an object run faster through time gets converted into \nkinetic energy. Just a slight slow down in time creates a HUGE boost in \nspeed because the speed of light (space/time) is 300,000,000 m/s. Time is \nrunning just a tiny fraction of a bit slower at our feet than our head \ncausing us to feel gravity. Light emitted in space will also blue shift \nwhen it enters a gravity well for the same reason. \n\nThis slow down is true until an object hits the event horizon of a \nblackhole. To stay stationary inside of a blackhole an obejct would have to \nmove faster than the speed of light and the energy of the object becomes \nnegative if it's standing still. This is a bizarre realm and the \nsingularity is even more bizarre. However, in reality no one knows what \nhappens in a blackhole.",

I will maintain, though, that i feel you are using the \nmathematical DESCRIPTION and OBSERVATIONS of magnetism as the EXPLANATION \nfor it and its non-intuitive \"perpendicularness\". i think you started \ngetting at the answer in talking about velocity, and i also think that the \nreason why velocity affects magnetic force, especially with reference to \ntwo electrostatic charges moving by each other,  is the answer that im \nlooking for. After finishing E and M course in college and seeing that \nnobody even cares about the why but only about the how, i am burning for an \nanswer to what magnetism is in terms of it being the electrostatics of \nmoving charges.  Do u know where i could be taught this",
