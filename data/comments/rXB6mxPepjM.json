                    "text": "I read the whole conversation here through & would like to sound my ideas.\n\nSo, the first comment said floating colonies on Venus. This is actually a \npretty decent idea. But very risky.\nHow would you orbit the planet? You would soon aerobrake enough to decrease \nyour orbit so much, you would fall to the surface. Not a good thing. Or did \nI miss anything?\n\nAnother suggestion was Mars. \nThis is a good idea. But the most critical thing is, that, it has virtually \nno atmosphere nor does it have a magnetic field that would protect it from \nthe radiation from solar flares. Another bad thing is the surface \nradiation. The colonists would require constant protection from it, which \nwould require very thick layers of materials. It would be very difficult to \nlaunch such heavy things. \nBut Mars has this advantage over Venus that you could build the colony to \nthe surface. Still very risky but not as risky. Also it is relatively close \nto Earth, unlike some other candidates.\nLet's see some more ideas.\n\nGanymede was a suggestion. And its magnetic field.\nThe thing with this moon is that, despite its distance from Jupiter, it \nstill gets a dangerous amount of radiation.\nGanymede's own magnetic field is not that much of help. It is completely \novershadowed by Jupiter's. \nThis moon also does not have a substantial atmosphere. But I think it is \ncapable of holding it as it is bigger than Mercury. Not nearly as massive \nthough. So I don't know for sure.\nWe won't even talk about other moons of Jupiter, including Europa. Europa \nis even closer to Jupiter than Ganymede, so we will leave that out of the \nconversation right now. Yes, I know about the subsurface ocean! I'll try to \ncome back to that later if I don't forget.\n\nAnd then there's my favourite suggestion. Titan.\nAs some people already said, its atmosphere is mostly methane which is a \ndecent greenhouse gas. That advantage is great. Also, it has lakes of \nmethane. I do not know what could we do with it, but I'm pretty sure it can \nbe used for some sort of power generating and processing it into drinkable \nwater. You wouldn't need a pressure suit aswell as the atmosphere is \nthicker than Earth's, meaning even higher atmospheric pressure than Earth \nhas. You would still have to wear (presumably) a spacesuit, to protect you \nfrom cold, though. \nBut yes indeed there are downsides. \nIt is extremely far from the Sun, that means extremely cold temperatures. \nBut since we are talking about a colony and that has to include the \ntechnology that offers protection from hot & cold temperatures. So I think \nwe could handle that.\n\nThere is another moon that I suggest to consider personally. Enceladus.\nIt has water. Lots of it. And it does not get the radiation dose that \nEuropa does. I think Enceladus is a better candidate (in terms of water) \nthan Europa. The temperature problem can be handled. Water ice can be \nturned into liquid water easily. Radiation is a more difficult problem.\nAnd then there is Callisto, which is a dead rock without recent geological \nactivity that is the furthest of the Galilean satellites. You would get a \nlower radiation dose there than you do here on Earth. Also compared to \nSaturn's moons, it is much closer to Earth and thus easier to get to.\n\nI am sorry for derpy & flawed grammar! :)",

(although I may also be wrong \non this, and would be happy to read more on it)\n\nAfter a quick google, it seems a lot of these height measurements are made \nusing shadows of the features in question. For example, when the sun is on \nthe horizon (generally perpendicular) to a mountain, the length of the \nshadows it leaves on the surrounding landscape can be used to work out the \nmountain's height. This seems to be how Galileo and company did business in \nthe mid-1600s and although obviously our tech is more advanced nowadays, \nmeasuring apparent height by the length of cast shadows is still apparently \na solid method.\n\nAs always, the internet at large is way better at answering these questions \nthan I could ever be; I recommend just following links on google to sate \nyour curiosity.

And designating the sea level is \noften done by defining the radius that an object would have if were \nperfectly spherical, which is fine. However this requires knowledge of the \nmoon's mass and volume which can hardly be accurate to the 6th decimal.\n\nTo me that number sounds like having a number like 10 100 meters being \nconverted in the calculator and having the result mistakenly taken as \nperfectly accurate. It's like saying \"the radius of the Earth is 6000 \nkilometres, therefore it's circumference is 37 699.08 km. Doesn't quite add \nup, although the math is nominally correct. ",
