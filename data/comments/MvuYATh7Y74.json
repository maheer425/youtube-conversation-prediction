What it appears to be is that when loose there are LOT \nof proteins that act to keep things orderly. When time for mitosis \napproaches a lot of proteins get together to untangle and refold the DNA \ninto the chromosomal form (chromatids) that we picture as our genome.:) In \nfact, the true story is that your chromosome in between mitoses are not \nfully unfolded, something in between. Also, the \"untangling\" sometimes \n(actually very often! and also helped by other proteins) results in \ncrossing over of strands between similar sequences resulting in \nrecombination (a VERY important genetic process with evolutionary \nconsequences).",

It started with some amino acids, \nand they bonded in some form of way. I'm not sure what, because that's all \nI ever really learned about it. The things needed to create amino acids \nwere on Earth to begin with, and then energy (in the form of lightning, I \nthink) bonded them and made amino acids.\nYou could say an outside force created us, but what created that outside \nforce?

Most other excuses are also equally \nquestionable.\nTo be honest, I don't anyone can ever know. We can say we're pretty sure, \nbut creation is difficult to study. Telling how exactly your computer is \nmade is (mostly) impossible without outside information. Telling how babies \nare made is also pretty difficult without outside information.

It's not one copy but \nmillions of copies of the genome that is being sequenced and each full copy \nis broken up into the pieces. Because the pieces are randomly broken, there \nare a lot of overlaps between the pieces. The raw sequences are then \"read' \nand a computer is used to mix and match overlapping sequences to get a \ncontinuous sequence of the FULL genome. (Obviously lots of issues here, \nsuch as repeat sequences can throw off the system etc, but hey, its still a \ngreat system to get useful data). Without computers the whole mix n match \nsystem would be a nightmare! Hope this is a bit clearer?",
