This is the reason some dreams make \nsense, while others don't. Our level of understanding in that realm is only \nsparingly. For instance we have volumes of respected literature relating to \ndream meanings. In a dimension higher than our own home plane.

Yet your unwilling \nto accept your soul is apart of that energy and thus resonates with the \nmatter that creates your body. Our soul is essentially the magnet field in \nwhich the \"metal shavings\" of our cellular structure is aligned too. It is \nessentially the life force with which our bodies power themselves.

It takes practice to stop judging \nourselves and then stop judging others, in this manner we learn that we CAN \nlove one another freely and with as much compassion as there may need to be \ngiven. We do not need to set our needs aside. You cannot nourish people \nfrom an empty well. It is an obligation to yourself to nourish your soul's \nneeds and then to help others fulfill theirs. Spirituality is not like a \nreligion, it is a personal experience and 99% of the time, it involves \nraising the vibration of the planet to bring us back to our true divine \nselves. We can do this, be the change you want to see in the world said our \ndearest Mahatma Gandhi :) Blessings and love xxx",

Like \"this thing right here is mine, this money is \nmine\" or on the other end: \"it can't be mine because it is of someone else\".\n\nThe only thing we really control is ourselves and the rest should be used \nwhen Needed.

We have to lose this generalistic paranoia towards each other for \nwhatever reasons we came up with, whether it is because of race, religion, \nsex, age, social status, money income, or even what patch of land we live \non.

A murder is a murder, it's results are suffering. \nThere is not a single argument to say any kind of murder is a positive \nthing (unless perhaps to end someone's  suffering).\n\nWe should not make any compromise and always do our best to be positive.
