Why would you need \nsomething as silly as that to acquire things? Can't you just have them, or \nget it on your own? Woman: I don't know. But they kept making the coins \nuntil there was so much of it that it wasn't worth anything anymore.\nThe point; money can't buy happiness, it really isn't worth anything.

But I am still finding \npeople who are only just discovering it. I was shocked that my 21 year-old \nniece (I'm 48) hadn't heard of it, when I asked her if she liked it! But \njust because many people have found & dumped it, doesn't mean everyone \nelse, or even most has/have. It's still hugely popular, in some circles. \nWhy, I have NO IDEA. But for those that enjoy it, I say go for it. Just \ndon't expect me to return to it. I'm perfectly happy with YouTube (unless \nthey go through with their threat of blocking indies who don't sign their \ncontract), although I'm always open for trying newer alternatives. Peace",

I know it's not all pure instrumental like past \nalbums, but they still have plenty of songs like that in recent albums. \nEver heard of \"O\" or \"Oceans\" from this new album? No? Then you're not a \ntrue Coldplay fan cuz those songs have the \"old Coldplay\" style. Coldplay \nhas adopted multiple styles to appeal to different kinds of music tastes. \nAnd to do it at the scale they do is why they have so many top hits. \nColdplay is and always will be one of the greatest bands of all time.\ufeff",

My wife fired a .44 magnum handgun about 6 \ninches from my right ear accidentally & there was an Instant high pitched \nhum. It lasted for weeks & I had to wear ear plugs with the band because \nanything loud was painful.  But suddenly , one night while playing with the \nband, it just Stopped hurting after I hit a really high, loud note in a \nsolo, & it was FINE!!!  Strange!  Its been OK since that time.
