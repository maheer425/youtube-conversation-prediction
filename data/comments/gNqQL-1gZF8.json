Well, I had better have a think about how I'd put my \nlife in storage back here for some time... but I sure do wanna see Europe \nagain, and it looks like that's a window. Good stuff, bro!\n\nRight this moment, I actually have to hit the road (or more accurately the \ntrain) to head to Sydney. I'm taking part in the \"Reclaim Australia\" Rally \nagainst creeping Islamisation there in a few hours. It's happening in \ncities and towns all over the country, but since Sydney had the terrorist \nattack at the Lindt Cafe I reckon that'll be the biggest.\n\nWe'll continue this from there!",
