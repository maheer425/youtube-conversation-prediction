Later on in history, the kids went door to door to \nget treats like food, water, clothes, and other stuff. If they didn't get \nit they would play a nasty trick on the person who didn't give them stuff. \nThat's where the phrase, 'trick-or-treat' came from. Now it just evolved to \ndressing up and begging for candy. I'm saying this because there was a \ncomment that I was trying to reply to but I couldn't find it. And it is \nprobably the most dangerous holiday in the world because people can poison \ncandy, and also people can dress up and then jump you. So yeah. Reply if \nyou want, but I probably won't see it for a while.\ufeff",

What the hell's the point? I like scary stuff as much as the next guy, \nbut I don't see why we should have a holiday every year that's just a day \nwhere it's acceptable to walk around dressed as serial killer holding a \nknife, yet if you did it on any other day, you'd get arrested in a \nheart-beat.\nPlus for that matter, trick or treating makes no sense as a concept: Going \nto people's houses and accepting candy? Don't we tell our kids every other \nday of the year \"DON'T TAKE CANDY FROM STRANGERS\" but for one day, just \nbecause it's some holiday that has no actual meaning to it, but somehow \nbecame a thing, we tell our kids \"TAKE CANDY FROM THE STRANGER. IT'S FINE\"?\n\nYeah I just find the entire thing pointless. It's for fun, I get that, but \nother holidays are fun YET ALSO make sense, and have a an actual warm feel \nto them.\nHalloween is just plain fucking annoying if you dislike the concept, which \na lot of people naturally would. Most other holidays at least have some \nsort of warm feeling that enwraps most people, even if they dislike the \ngeneral holiday itself.\ufeff",
