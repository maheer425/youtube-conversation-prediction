It also works with Banana \npuree [or pudding] and Graham Crackers with a drizzle of chocolate sauce \nand as you said make the whipped cream yourself, store bought is crap! \n\nA suggestion if I may regarding plastic ware, if you invest in the 'good \nstuff' and hand wash it when the event of over, NEVER put it in the \ndishwasher, it will last for many gatherings in the future. It's a little \nmore work and a lot less stuff in a landfill.\n\nLOVE your channel, I just found you a week or so ago, and congrats on your \nGREAT pre Christmas live show!!!",
