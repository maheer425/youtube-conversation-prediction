Have \nyou squirmed as its rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your \njaw, to your throat, in a slithering search that's seeking your artery? \nHave you felt its hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it \nprobes your pulse\u2014the flow that leads to your brain? Has its tongue rested \nthere, throbbing slightly as if savoring the moment? Have you then \nexperienced a sinking, sucking blackness as you discover that not all \nvampires feed on blood\u2014some feed on memories?\n\nWell, have you?\n\nMaybe not.

                "text": "Very insightful video. If you are smart and think, you might just be able \nto understand that humans are only a product of our own minds. Here is my \nopinion. God is not real. We only exist because we have to. I belove that \nwe live in something along the lines of a simulation, not the matrix \nsimulation, but that we are all god. We might be dead, or really be alive. \nIf you have ever had a NDE(near death experience) and your mind skipped a \nsecond, you might have died, but your mind couldn't grasp that you died, so \nit harnessed enough power to continue living microscopically, in your sub \nconsciousness as a last resort. We don't know what happens when we die, \nbecause your brain cannot cope. We all might be dead. We all might be in \nanother dimension of your mind, while your real body is in a grave. Do you \nreally want to know what happens when you die. I suggest you don't.\ufeff",
