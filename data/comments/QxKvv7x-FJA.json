                "text": "My theory or hope for this new film universe batman:\nBruce wayne is old, grizzled, and is already closely thinking about hanging \nup his cape but only stays because of the emergence of the justice league \nand superman and realizes that the world really needs batman now more than \never. Hes already had dick grayson as robin and now nightwing while carrie \nkelly is the second or third robin. Dick's relationship with bruce is \nstrained but deep down he thinks of him as a father figure. In the newest \nbatman solo film it will emphasize the fact that bruce is just getting too \nold to keep going even with help from carrie and dick. He starts to prepare \nfor retirement or even death. \nIn the second JL film, he'll sacrifice himself to save the world and in the \nsecond solo batman film or NIGHTWING film, dick grayson will take up the \nmantle of batman (reluctantly) and will go on to join the justice league \nand be a younger batman for the team. If the movies go in this direction, \nit can deal with the sort of predicament theyve put themselves in through \nmaking batman a little older. We'll get a new batman and see the first \nlegacy character in the DCMU or any love action adaptation.\ufeff",

Most people know nightwing by the \nname anyway and wouldnt need to wonder \"howd he come up with the name?\"\nOR, they could just make dick grayson the robin who died, and the new \nbatman will be terry mcginnis, creating a sort of batman beyond thing.
