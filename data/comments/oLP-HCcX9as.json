Don't be fooled by the videos, go for a test drive with Quirt \nand you'll see disposable power is not a bad thing, especially with the \namazing traction control systems on these BRZ/FRS!\n\nThank you Quirt for all the time you've spent running countless dyno runs \nto perfect this FRS/BRZ!! \n\ufeff",
