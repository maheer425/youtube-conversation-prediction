Se estan tomando \nmucha molestia de fijarse en lo que hacen los demas sin saber la realidad. \nSi se fijan bien, la mayoria de la gente solo juzga a hillsong y&f. Nunca \nescuche de alguien que juzgara de los videos de hillsong para adultos. \u00bfPor \nque sera?. ESTO ES HILLSONG, ES MUSICA CRISTIANA DESDE HACE MAS DE 10 A\u00d1OS, \nNO PUEDO LLEGAR A ENTENDER COMO PUEDEN PENSAR QUE PONEN ILUMINATIS O \nMENSAJES SUBLIMINALES EN SUS CANCIONES. ESTO SE LLAMA JUVENTUD. SOMOS \nLIBRES. SOMOS LIBRES EN CRISTO. Si no les gusta el video no se tomen la \nmolestia de juzgar, siempre esta bien dar opiniones, pero sin juzgar seria \nun poco mas pacifico c: .

Sure, I totally get where all you Christian \nfolks that are more traditional are coming from... It's not easy to get \nused to this kind of music in terms of worship. I came from a traditional \nChristian background - no drums, and no electric guitar. Just choir and \npiano. The thing is... You can't put Christianity in a box (more so, \nJesus). There is a verse in the bible that says, \"generation after \ngeneration will be in awe of Your works.\" I forgot where that is from, but \nto me it basically means that PEOPLE are gonna be constantly changing, but \nGOD does not. He is the same forever and always. Guys, we cant be critical \nat everything. Who are we to say that this is not of God. There definitely \nmore ways to connect with people who are lost instead of just handing out \ntracts, right? God Bless, to anyone who got my point and are still reading \nthis.\ufeff",

I \nmean, who where the religious ones in the bible? The Pharisees and the ones \nwho wanted to hang Jesus. We are not called to be religious. Religion is \nnot for Gods people. Religion is something that man has made up, not God. \nWatch \"Why I love Jesus but hate religion\", you will get more out of it. So \nto all you religious people, stop criticizing everything and everyone and \nknow who God is. Praise God with everything you are and everything you \nhave. This music praises God and nothing else, so why are you being so \ndramatic? Just sing and dance to God and lift his name higher. It doesn't \nmatter in what way, as long as it is not i a sexual manner. Which it is not \nin this video. Remember, Paul said, we are not from this world, but we are \nin it. So we should not isolate our selves from this world, but praise God \nfaithfully in every single way we can. This is why its no wrong that there \nare Catholics, Orthodox churches and so on. We are one church in Christ and \nwe are his feet and his hands. God bless ",

Religion is something that man has made up, not God. Watch \"Why I \nlove Jesus but hate religion\", you will get more out of it. So to all you \nreligious people, stop criticizing everything and everyone and know who God \nis. Praise God with everything you are and everything you have. This music \npraises God and nothing else, so why are you being so dramatic? Just sing \nand dance to God and lift his name higher. It doesn't matter in what way, \nas long as it is not i a sexual manner. Which it is not in this video. \nRemember, Paul said, we are not from this world, but we are in it. So we \nshould not isolate our selves from this world, but praise God faithfully in \nevery single way we can. This is why its no wrong that there are Catholics, \nOrthodox churches and so on. We are one church in Christ and we are his \nfeet and his hands. God bless",

                    "text": "+prsgirl Let us understand that Symbols means to define something, \ncharacterize, suggest or represent something else, whereas Symbolism is the \nact of using symbols. The Bible uses symbolism a lot, like the Lamb, that \nsymbolizes Lord our Savior. And also, the fact that they refer Jesus as to \nhaving a sharp double-edged sword coming out of His mouth with Seven Stars \nin His right hand, the 7 Lampstands, with feet as bronze metal glowing in a \nfurnace, (and more to refer), isn't that symbolism? If symbolism IS wrong, \nthen why is the Holy Living Word of God, using symbolism to His children, \nwhen he could just be direct and use easier context for us to understand? \nIf symbolism is wrong in the Bible, then are we worshiping a stupid god \nthat is senseless to his mind that uses symbolism throughout almost the \nentire Bible most of the time? NO. And I am pretty sure what you meant by \nin the context of the Bible where symbolism is wrong, is that it is wrong \nto worship symbols or images. The Illuminati used the All Seeing Eye (AND \nNOT A PLAIN TRIANGULAR SHAPED SHAPE) to shove it down to us that they're \neverywhere, sees everything, is in control, and are powerful, as this world \nis 'ruled' by evil. (There are various other religions which worships \nimages, but I can't name any).\n\nYou can't lust over something that's glorifying God, or focusing on God, or \neven related to God. The thing about glorifying themselves though, is a \ndifferent matter that God and Hillsong should resolve among themselves, but \nultimately, this song is pointing out to God. You can't lust music over God \nthat when God is in the music itself, that's quite weird of a context to \nput out. It might be the case, but we shouldn't really care now, should we? \nThis music is just a matter of genre, and it's still music used to glorify \nGod. It's like praying to God in Chinese and English, both different \nlanguages, different ways of speaking to God, but still praising the same \nGod in different ways. They worshiped God in different genres of music, but \nthat doesn't make them NOT worshiping God. I personally like this type of \nGenre in Christian music, but that don't mean I'm worshiping the music, \nright? I personally dislike the type of worship in the 09's and older \nbecause I don't like it based on my taste in music as a youth, but that \ndon't mean I hate God, right? \n\nThe Bible tells us to be kind to one another,I don't really recommend you \nspreading out weird beliefs like the \"Olympic torch that's co-related to \nthis flare waved around the air by some kid that has nothing to do in his \nspare time* (emphasis added). Different sides of people's opinions based on \ntheir knowledge where they gained from are different, some are contradicts \nwith each other, but since this is a Christian music video, I as a \nChristian will use a Christian point of view based on Christian analysis to \ndescribe this symbolic event of holding the torch/flare.\n\nThe flare held up by the young lad represents the burning passion or fire \nfor God and of God, and that it is shinning brightness pierces trough \ndarkness (night) and light (morning, both in the music video). It also \nmeans the glory of God which is (and should be) implemented in this lad \n(all of us, children of God), and that everyone else follows that glory. As \nyou can see, some of them held up their hands to the Light, which is Jesus. \nThe young lad with the flare was leading them, meaning the Way. All of \nthis, concludes that it's the True God that's working in this music video. \nThe light really just represents God and our burning passion for Him, the \nglory of God, and the Shining Morning Star, Jesus Christ Himself. \n\nI Hope this cleared up some of your understandings! Shalom and have a \nwonderful and blessed day!!!! :D\n\nLove,\nJohnson\n(Brother-In-Christ)",

What I says is that they use a lot of \nilluminati signs in their video.\nYou need to be careful to what you purposely decide to listen or watch \nbecause these things will influence you in a conscious or in an unconscious \nway. For instance, if you enjoy watching dirty video, then your mind will \nget use to it  and that you will often have dirty thoughts. examples: if \nyou spend some time every day reading your bible or talking to God, your \nmind will get use to it and you will naturally feel the need to do so even \non the days when you are busy and don't find the time to do so. If you sped \nyour time watching rihanna ideo, then your mind will get use to it and will \nporject it to you conscious quite often.  ",

However, I hope that the video \nproducers and the band will mindful of these things next time as to not \ncause confusion.... and it probably would have been better to proclaim the \nname of Jesus in the song, rather a verse for us to read in the beginning. \nGREAT SONG THOUGH!\ufeff",

A person's capacity to make music was created \nby God and man has distorted it for their own purposes. Why not recreate it \nand use it to glorify God? Why not meet young people where they are at and \nallow them to understand God by using music they identify with? It doesn't \nhave to be either or. It can be both/and. We need all types of music in the \nchurch because there are so many people groups to be reached. What works \nfor you might not work for someone else. We need to constantly be creative \nand work on music that reaches multiple people groups. These songs have the \ncapacity to break the ice so that someone can feel completely comfortable \nentering in. It's great that you can enter in straight from the beginning. \nSome people need a few awesome, dance around praise songs to feel \ncomfortable before getting vulnerable with God. #justsomethoughts",

I think it was saint Augustine who said \"If you think that you \nunderstand, then what you understand is not God\" (sorry for my translation \nfrom my mother tongue). Basically what I mean - in this case you cannot \ntell exactly how we should worship. In the Bible what we can find is that \nGod is looking for our hear, not if he likes guitar or piano and not if the \nvideo should show cross or celebration of life... I think this corresponds \na bit with Daniel Nguyen's last paragraph.\n\nAnother point I really want to elaborate on: \"And my question to you is \nsince when do We need to change things to accomodate to other people to \nchrist? People accomodate to christianity. God is not intersted in yur \ncomfort or your prefrence. He is interested in your worship and if you know \nat least one thing aout God it is that He is a very specific God.\" \nI can't understand what's your point of view on evangelism... I look at \nJesus and I see that He came to people where they were, in their \ncircumstances, always talking with examples from their life... I look at \nPaul, how he preached in Athens (look around Acts 17 v23)... From this I \nlearn that we should do everything to reach people in secular world! And \nTHEN proclaim TRUE/FULL Gospel as opposed to \"selling\" it, i.e., offering \njust the nice parts: like eternal life, love, happiness, comfort, security, \netc...\nAnd finally, of course God is interested in my comfort and my wellbeing! He \nis MY FATHER! And because of that my praise goes to Him! And I know few \nthings about God already... He loved first, He died for me, He knows my \nneeds. I feel concerned about you if you think of God as of some demanding \nfigure who doesn't care about you... but if you truly seek for truth, you \nwill find it :)\nAnd yes, God is very specific about some things, e.g., \"Jesus said to him, \nI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father \nexcept through me.\" Different means of worship or evangelism.",

God is not \nintersted in yur comfort or your prefrence. He is interested in your \nworship and if you know at least one thing aout God it is that He is a very \nspecific God. He does not mess around. Even if they have good intentions, \nIt is still not worsip.I like the words and am getting used to this \nelectronic movement in christian songs.

Christianity is probably the \nworst thing you could ever turn to as far as comfot goes. you die every day \nand You sacrifice everthing you once were.

We should not be there to \nbegin with but when It comes to music it makes sense but that analogy was \nway off. We are supposed to be set apart when it comes to things like that. \nWhat did Joseph do when He was being tempted by the  Pharoes wife? The \nBible does not say that he stayed and tried to love her and tried to \ninfluence her instead of the other way around. He fled!
