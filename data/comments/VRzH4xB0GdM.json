For \ninstance, let's say you want to get the wattage taken of an electric load. \nFirst, measure voltage and current, perform an log10 of both voltages using \nlog amp, you then antilog the sum of the two voltages, and you get wattage \n! Logarithmic operation is cool in electronic! \n\njust like Numberphile!\nThank you!",

If such precision is not needed, however, an approximation might be \nfaster (I remember Brady posted one video about it, such as 38284 x 4489 is \nroughly 40000 x 4000 if I'm not mistaken, or I'll do 38000 x 4500 which is \nquite easy to do and has better precision). On the other hand, if I'm given \nonly a piece of paper and pen, I have no choice other than doing the \"hard \nway\" :)\n\nPS: I'm pretty sure back in 1969 they were equipped with small calculators \n(or something like that) when collecting data on the moon, but I get what \nyou're trying to picture. Flipping over pages of log/antilog tables would \nbe quite hard to do with those astronaut gloves though...",

And, two by two, they complied happily.  When, \nhowever, it came to a type of Viper called an Adder the snakes complained \nto Noah that they could not possibly do it!  After all they said, we are \nonly Adders and we don't know how to multiply! Noah told them sternly that \nthey must, or he wouldn't let them go and he promptly locked them in the \nwood shed.\n\nSome time later Noah returned and opened the shed.  He found the two snakes \nlooking contentedly into each other's eyes. He asked them how they were \ndoing and they said that everything was now fine and that Noah should let \nthem go.  Noah said \"I thought you told me that there was no way you could \never multiply!\" The Adders replied coyly \"When you locked us in the wood \nshed - we discovered logs!\"\n\n\n*John Napier*: http://goo.gl/oIejW9\ufeff",
