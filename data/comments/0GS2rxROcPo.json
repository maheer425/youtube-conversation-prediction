The fact is, this nest *is* a genetic phenotype.

What \npart do you think isn't?\n\nDo you disagree that DMT combines with certain receptors in the brain, \ngiving an altered state of consciousness and make you trip?  I would say \nthis is very well established.\n\nGive someone DMT, and they will trip for a predictable amount of time. Give \nthem water, they will not.\n\nMany people, upon sobering up from DMT, will claim they had \"Astral \nProjections\", Near Death experiences\", Psychedelic trips with significant \nmessages\"  Yada Yada Yada...\n\nThis shows us that these experiences are dependent on the DMT, at the very \nleast.\n\nFurthermore, we can get other chemicals which produce similar experiences, \nbut are different somewhat due to drugs producing different effects and \ndifferent trips...  we can then compare the two or more different \nsubstances and see brain activity.\n\nWhat we find is that brain activity in both are rather similar. Certain \nparts of the brain will experience significant decreased activity compared \nwith being sober, and others with significant increased activity. This \nshows that it seems that brain activity in certain regions produced from \nparticular chemicals produce these altered states of consciousness.\n\nWe can then use this information, to predict which parts of the brain are \nresponsible for the reactions people call \"astral projections\" etc...\n\nThrough other countless experiments and information collected unrelated to \ndrug trips, we have established what general function these parts of the \nbrain seem to have, and they seem to correlate strongly with the effects \nthey would produce if increased or decreased activity were to happen from \nsome chemical. In other words, the theory has predictive capabilities, \nwhich is essential in establishing its validity. Coincidence?  I think \nnot...\n\nThis is well established Neuroscience / Psychology, i'm sorry to say. And \nthe further we study this, the further we seem to understand this process \nand how drugs can trick people into having profound experiences which they \nmay claim is \"beyond this world\".\n\nThere is definitely more to learn, but this is the best explanations we \nhave and it is based on countless experiments and our modern understanding \nof the brain.\n\nSome random dude on the internet saying he thinks there actually is more to \nthis material life is just frivolous testimonial and doesn't compare with \nactual modern understanding of the brain through science.",

In the downside, the human brain doesn't seem \nto have as much storage space as a computer. So whenever it comes to \nacquiring stored information, we humans are forced to access information \nexternally rather than from inside our own brain.\n\nOn the goodside, our human brain has about the same memory as a computer \nwith 2.5 Petabytes (2.500000 GB) of RAM. So we don't need to store as much \ninformation either. It's stored in memory in bits and pieces and combined \nto produce the information we need.\n\nNeurons are also far better than transistors at communicating with \neachother. So when you're saying that a computer can run \"hundreds of \nprocesses\" simultaneously, I'm not particularly impressed.\n\nAlso process is not the same as a physical action done with a physical \nbody. It doesn't matter what you're programmed to do, if you don't have a \nbody that can obey that program.\n\nFurthermore, it's been stated several times that the work that the Mars \nRovers do in weeks on mars for instance, can be done in minutes or hours by \nhumans. The reason why we don't send humans (yet) is strictly because of \nmaintenance costs. Food and protection.\n\nNot to mention the ludicrously bad AI that exists today, that at best \nbehaves like a brain-damaged toddler, unless we're talking about game mobs \nwho's been programmed to fake a higher intelligence than they actually have.\n\nAlso, my original point wasn't even about what is true right now. It was \nasking about what's true across a given timeline.\n\nFinally, I think half the women on this planet (and the men who's learned \nit) would be very disappointed in you, if you told them that we humans have \nalmost no multitasking capability.",

See, these examples are all kinds of things that these animals \ndo instinctively (hunting) and they do it all the time. It's what they live \nfor, survival and breeding. We, humans, we don't live for certain things. \nOne can do whatever he/she wishes to do. So when we decide to go for a swim \nor we want to be able to drive a car, we plan to go out and buy swimming \nshorts because we know we will need those if we go to the pool and we will \ntake driving lessons because we know we will need those to be able to drive \non public roads. If I would tell the average 14 year old that I like red \ncars and show the girl/boy 3 different cars which of one is red and ask \nwhich car I like, she/he will most likely answer that I like the red one. \nThis seems very simple but is at the very core of prediction and \nintelligence. A more relative example would be that when you wake up on \nyour day-off (from school or work or anything) you will ask yourself what \nyou want to do that day or what you have to do and your brain will rapidly \nstart making schedules or plans in order to do those things. These kinds of \npredictions are different from hunting, in the Lion example or following \nthe garbage truck, in the crows example, because those animals HAVE to do \nthose things in order to survive. They'll HAVE to learn where their preys \ngo and where the garbage truck drives around in order to survive and that's \nwhen instinct and basic learning takes over. They just learn from previous \nexperiences instead of CREATING new situations and experiences in their own \nminds, like I noted above.",

If we accept natural selection as \nthe means that determines reproduction, the act of finding a mate and \nreproducing is all about determining dominance as a more 'primitive' form \nof a hierarchy. Android, on the other hand, seems to be referring to an \nauthority structure of a hierarchy, which would be similar to government \n(and organized communities, maybe?). But if we do look at it from an \nanimalistic perspective, there's a social hierarchy throughout many species \nthat defines us as social animals, or needing others to help survive and \nthrive. This seems to bring up an interesting situation of whether we are \nsocial by nature or whether we became social as we became more intelligent. \nI don't know. Any thoughts?",

If what Michio is saying is correct then if you took a \nblack bear from the wild, kept it in a zoo indoors where the climate never \nchanges then the bear would never begin preparing for hibernation.\n\nWe do know that bears in captivity do not hibernate like bears in the wild \ndo, this presents evidence that bears don't plan to hibernate and they just \nreact to the environment.\n\nhttp://animals.pawnation.com/bears-hibernate-captivity-1791.html",

                    "text": "+DunnsDayDash .\nHow is qualification an illusion?  It's the essence of having the authority \nto say something is or is not a certain way, AGAIN, as a medical doctor is \nauthoritatively QUALIFIED to say what is ailing someone, rather than any \nrandom person off the street.  Without said medical degree, you have no \nauthority or right to diagnose, much less prescribe, anything for any \nreason.  The same follows with this:  unless you have an advanced \nmathematics or physics degree, you have no authority.  Period.  The only \nillusion here is the one you have in your mind about credentials and \nauthority.\n \nAlso again, not all opinions are equal.  I refer you back to the first \nparagraph regarding authority.\n \nPhilosophy and math may have similar origins in time and place, but they \nare absolutely NOT the same.  Logic and math can very well be said to be \nused to find truth, but the means by which they do so are not really the \nsame, and the problems that they apply to are entirely different.\n \nIf you think your logic is unmatched, then I pity you, because I've \nsuccessfully reduced all of your arguments to nothing, so I don't know who \nyou've debated, but they were apparently not qualified enough to do so.  \nI'm sorry, but you've fundamentally shown a lack of understanding of \nphysics, sociology, reasoning, and critical analysis.\n \nAnd please, don't demean yourself.  Please explain which theories you're \nreferring to.  Are they physics theories, which require specialized \ntraining?  Chemistry?  Biology?  Or are they some other kind of theories, \nlike something in the soft sciences, such as psychology?  I hope not, \nbecause with such a profound misunderstanding of basic sociology, that \ncouldn't be a sound theory.\n \nBy the way, we should clarify something here:  \"theory\" does not equal \n\"hypothesis.\"  A theory, in science, is a well-tested, peer-reviewed idea.  \nA true theory in science is not \"solved in a matter of hours.\"  So please, \nby all means, substantiate this claim that you can or have solved theories \nin hours.  Which theories?  I want sources, and verification of who you \nare, and that your name has been attached to said peer-reviewed theory.  \nIt's time to put your money where your mouth is.\n \nBecause by the sound of it, you have a \"hypothesis.\"  And since we're \ntalking science here, do not misuse the term \"theory\" to mean something \nthat it doesn't, which you clearly don't have.  Germ Theory is a recognized \ntheory.  Perturbation Theory is a recognized theory.  In fact, here's a \nshort list of other recognized, well-tested, peer-reviewed theories:\n-Evolutionary Theory\n-Big Bang Theory\n-Cosmic Expansion\n-Thermodynamics\n-General Relativity\n \nHow about some from the soft sciences, which are also well-tested and \npeer-reviewed:\n-Classical Conditioning\n-Psychosocial Development\n-Behaviorism\n-Social Learning\n-Functionalism\n-Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development\n-Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development\n \nNeed I go on?\n \nNeedless to say, I'm not sure why you think your reasoning capabilities \nmake you superior to science.  What has science given us?  Well, let's \nsee:  the computer you're using, your phone, your car, planes, trains, \ndesks, chairs, tools, beds, television, cameras, water heaters, air \nconditioners, running water, electricity, food preservation, antibiotics, \nartificial hearts, respirators, defibrillators, CDs/DVDs, playing cards, \nvacuum cleaners, glasses (spectacles), glasses (drinking), refrigerators, \nbatteries, wiring, radios, ways to preserve food... again, do I really need \nto go on?\n \nSo forgive me if I fail to see how your reasoning is superior to science, \nmuch less what you might accomplish with it.  Not to completely bash you; \nperhaps you DO have a good hypothesis.  I haven't read it, but I consider \nmyself a philosopher, and preliminarily I have to say that you're not on \nthe right track.\n \nBut hey, what do I know.\n \nYou may be right that your thoughts are not affected by the ignorance of \nothers, but you unfortunately have closed yourself to understanding how the \nworld actually works, which is always saddening.  You are also \nunfortunately delusional if you think reasoning alone gives you credibility \nof any kind in regard to physics.  Based on your line of reasoning, you can \nsubscribe to any idea you please, regardless of evidence.  Worse, you enter \ninto a debate without even understanding the argument of your opposition!  \nThat's utter failure at the fundamentals of critical analysis, which the \ncrux and backbone of philosophy!  Do I even need to list all that you \ndidn't understand?\n \nAt this point, it seems a waste of time to point out that you don't \nunderstand human nature, either, but you don't.  Nor evolution, or its \ncorrelation to gravity.  And I mean... not to be incredibly nit-picky, but \nyou don't even have the rate of acceleration correct.  Not sure if you \nlegitimately didn't know, or were just too lazy to put the whole thing.\n \nAs Socrates might say, \"A philosopher seeks truth, and that truth is based \nin reality.  Truth shapes belief, not the other way around.\"  You refuse to \nsee the world for what it is, and instead only see what you want.  I wish \nyou luck, but unfortunately this has ceased being a debate, and is instead \na lecture.  You've obviously taken nothing from this, but hopefully someone \nelse has.\n \nPeace.",

                    "text": "+Matthew L.\n\nAs I explained, I am just as qualified as Kaku because qualification is all \nan illusion that we created. \n\nIf a person exists, they can reason and they have credibility when they \nreason. \nSomeones reasoning can be way off, but it doesn't mean that everything they \nsay isn't credible. \n\nI am very heavy into Philosophy, which is the founding of all mathematics \nand logic. I'm not an established physicist like Kaku by any means, but my \nphilosophical and logical way of thinking is undeniable and unmatched. \nThere's people who spend years as a physicist and struggle to solve a \ntheory, then there's people like me who only need a matter of hours to \nsolve a theory without needing to spend years struggling. \nIt's all about how you reason and think. Anyone is capable. \nI'm very enlightened through self discovery, and my thoughts are not \naffected by the ignorance of others. \n\nYou need to find balance when you reason. You have to consider both ends, \nnot just one. I think that my higher reasoning gives me enough credibility \ncompared to any physicist. Because it's something they lack, and it shows. \nI laugh at Steven hawking when he tries to disprove Einstein, or when he \nsuggests that time travel is possible, or when he mentions multiple \nuniverses, or when he brings up Anti-matter. Those are all wrong. \nIf they thought better, they would see that. It's okay to be open minded, \nbut it doesn't mean that we should all waste time chasing a ghost. \n\n\n\nAnd again, gravity is the answer. \nYou cannot compare human nature to nature itself because the will power is \ndifferent. \n\nWe can overcome gravity because we evolved to withstand it. Our bodies \nevolved to make gravity neutral. It keeps just down, but our structures and \nmuscle power clearly out match the pathetic gravitational velocity of 9 \nmeters per second. The average human arm uses 70 pounds of force, \n\nGravity affects nature itself more effectively, and it's entirely different \nto humans. \n\nMy theory explains it all. I believe I'm the first person to unlock the \nuniverse. I'm really exited to get my theory out there when it's done. \nTrue or not, I believe it will create a 2nd dent in the universe. ",

                    "text": "+DunnsDayDash .\n\"The answer is gravity. There are no strings.\"\n \nNo, that's incorrect.  Again:\n1.  Scientists didn't know what held mass together at first.  It was \npostulated that a particle yet to be discovered was responsible.  Years \nlater, using the Large Hadron Collider, this particle was discovered:  the \nHiggs boson.  This is the particle that holds other particles together and \nultimately gives mass its mass.  Without it, particles would not bond \ntogether.  It has nothing to do with gravity, and as Matthew L. said, \ngravity is the weakest of the four known forces.\n2.  You're approaching the idea of \"strings\" from a narrow mindset.  Simply \nbecause we cannot see something yet does not mean that it's illogical to \nthink it exists, much as with the Higgs boson, and similarly with Dark \nMatter and Dark Energy.  Both of these are not found, at all, period.  Yet \nwe can measure their effects on the universe.\n3.  You are deeply confusing the ideas of relativity and quantum \nmechanics.  They exist rather independently, though they exist at the same \ntime and in the same space.  Normal laws of motion and gravity do not work \non the quantum scale, and similarly quantum mechanics does not work on the \nmacro scale, such as what holds galaxies together.\n \nGravity is actually explained to be a \"sheet\" that matter sits in.  No, it \ndoesn't have positive and negative quantities.  Rather, if two objects of \nlarger mass are pulling on a much smaller planet from opposite directions, \nthen the planet isn't experiencing negative gravity from one and positive \nfrom the other, but is rather being pulled by both simultaneously.  Our \nmoon doesn't collide because our gravity keeps it close to us.  I'm not \nqualified to explain the specifics of how it got to be where it is, but if \nyou're genuinely curious, a quick Google search can find you an answer.\n \nI want to preface the next part by saying that I don't believe time travel \nin the SciFi sense to be possible.  That said, ideas of relativity and \ntraveling close to the speed of light are sometimes referred to in the same \nsense as \"time traveling,\" because if you traveled near the speed of light \nfor X amount of time, everyone else would age a long time while you do not.\n \nYou seem to have a rather warped idea of what time is, though.  Mass cannot \nhave a negative value, either.  Time most certainly IS measurable.  How do \nyou think GPS works?  You should look that up.  Simply put, it's done by \nmeasuring the vibrations of atoms.  Aspects of mass are ALSO relative.  \nYour mass changes depending on whether you're in water or not.  And time IS \nuniversally absolute, in that it is always moving forward.  It may differ \nbetween you and I, but the very factors that alter our times are the exact \nsame for each of us, and it's THIS that matters:  that the FACTORS are the \nsame.  Even if you traveled at the speed of light, the same laws of \nrelativity apply to us both, just at different extremes.\n \nHere, read this:  \nhttp://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-is-the-fourth-dimension  \nNow if you're going to bring up a deity of any kind, you're fighting a \nlosing battle, because now you have to substantiate and prove the existence \nof said deity.  I mean physically, quantifiably prove it exists, so you can \nshow that it affects the world.  No, I cannot disprove a god, but that's \nnot my responsibility.  More importantly, it's completely irrelevant.  From \nyour seat, regardless of whether you choose to think a god did it, your \nchoice is to either accept that everything started with a singularity, or \nit didn't.  If you choose to believe it did, then you're on the right \ntrack, even if you want to harbor notions of divine causality.\n \nAdditionally, equating a god with the Big Bang is kind of silly, because \n\"Big Bang\" is merely the name we give the reaction, the singularity.  It's \nfar more complex than this simple appellation.  And no line of reasoning \nwhatsoever deems that the two are the same or equal each other.  I say \nagain that you're being arrogant in saying that we absolutely cannot \nunderstand it, because this is the same hubris that many held for thousands \nand thousands of years regarding many aspects of advancement.  Simply \nbecause it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean that it won't.  Granted, it \nmay never happen.  But that doesn't mean it's reasonable to say we can't or \nwon't.  I will gladly refer you to articles of things we're doing with \ntechnology now that we never dreamed we could do even a hundred years ago.\n \nSince I apparently wasn't clear on one particular point, I'll elaborate:  \nIf you want to believe that someone is wrong about something, that's your \nright.  However, you make a grave mistake if you think you have any amount \nof credibility simply because you have an opinion.  You want to talk about \n\"society;\" society has created this idea that all opinions are equal, but \nthey're not.  Celestial Mechanics, Gravitational Theory, and Perturbation \nTheory are FAR, FAR from simple.  The math required to understand what \nNewton alone figured out is not simple; it's advanced calculus.  I don't \nrecall saying quantum mechanics has anything to do with how the planets \norbit, but if I did, I apologize (though I really doubt I did).\n \nIf you have some beef with String Theory, then you're better off getting a \nhighly advanced math and physics degree, so you can mathematically show why \nit's BS.  Until that point, you have nothing more than an opinion, and \nsorry to say, not even a good one.  I don't claim to be a big supporter or \nanything, but I at least recognize that it's a widely-supported theory by \nexperts in the field, who know WAY more than I do.  I simply try to \nunderstand as much as I can about it, and await the day that it may be \ncompleted so we can see what can be done with it.\n \nAnd no, you have no credibility in regard to physics compared to Kaku, and \nnot to be insulting, but you're delusional if you think you do.  That's \nakin to saying you have the same credibility as a doctor, but no medical \ndegree, or as a lawyer, but no law degree.  He's been to school for the \nstuff in his field, which GIVES him the credibility to talk about physics \nand string theory.\n \nAt no point did I say that credentials determine what type of person you \nare.  Not once did I say such a thing.  So I'll say again:  they give \ncredence to you have credibility as a professional in your chosen field, \nagain like a doctor, lawyer, what-have-you.\n \nAnd if you reeeeally think that there's not an inequality, then you really \nneed to take a good Sociology course.  I'm not even going to elaborate on \nthis one, and will only say that social class COMPLETELY affects a child's \nability to be \"whatever they want.\"  It is absolutely NOT equal.\n \nTo be completely blunt, I'm not the one who is apparently feeding off of \nsocietal notions:  you are, since you think all opinions are equal, and \neveryone has the same chance at life and education.  These are \ncategorically\u2014thoroughly and completely--incorrect.\n \nAnd I COMPLETELY encourage you to prove him wrong.  Not in the \"I have an \nopinion\" sort of way, but the \"I've gone through advanced math and physics \ncourses and have disproven the theory with mathematics\" way.  In fact, if \nyou do, you'll likely get a Nobel Prize for it.  Seriously, you probably \nwould.  Go for it.  It's not impossible.  It IS impossible if you don't \nhave the schooling first, but not after.\n \nObviously you don't understand black holes, or you wouldn't have said, \n\"nothing is destroyed.\"  Look up what happens to stuff that's eaten by a \nblack hole.\n \nBy the way, Newton started working on his theories in the late 1600s.  \nThose ideas weren't finished until roughly the early 1800s.  So it took \nabout 150 years\u2014count that again, just in case\u2014until we (man in general) \nhad a much better understanding of celestial mechanics.  If you're \nreeeeally going to use the age of the theory as an argument, then you \nshould probably know in advance that it's a poor argument.  Just saying.\n \nSo yes, by all means, go ahead writing your own theory.  If it isn't based \nin science, though, then you're going to have a really, REALLY difficult \ntime with that.  I wish you luck, though!  It'll take more than luck, of \ncourse, but whatever.  You obviously know more than I!  Unless, of \ncourse... wait a second... yep, I think I've consistently exposed flaws in \nyour arguments.  That doesn't necessarily prove who is more intelligent, \nbecause I certainly won't claim to be (since I cannot know or prove that), \nbut I CAN claim that I have a far, far better understanding of science, \nbased on how this discussion has gone.\n \nAnd quite honestly of grammar as well.  Just saying.\n \nSo I'll tell you the same thing I've told others:  resorting to \nname-calling will not, in any way, help validate your arguments, and will \nonly succeed in making you look silly.  It certainly doesn't hurt my \nfeelings, but if it makes you feel better to think so, then go right ahead \ndeluding yourself.\n \nTo +Matthew L., I'm not sure if you were referring to me about being \"as \nqualified as Kaku.\"  If you meant me, then absolutely not!  I never said \nsuch a thing, nor would I.  The things I'm discussing are basic premises \nand ideas that anyone who is curious can research.  They are what the \nlayman can understand, as I am merely a layman.  I know nothing of the math \nbehind String Theory, or multi-verse theories, or physics.  I'm simply \nenthusiastic about science.  That said, I was challenging Dunns, who bashed \nKaku, as if he knew more about physics, which is, quite frankly, obviously \nnot the case.  I thank you, though, for the compliments.",

There are no strings. If there were, we would sense \nthem. They cant just exist on small scale because that is illogical and \nbiased. If strings affect the smallest particles, then they would affect \nthe biggest.\n\nWhy doesn't our moon collide into our earth or break free from it? \nInvisible giant String?

Its wrong to say someone isnt right as much as its wrong \nto say someone is wrong.\nYoure not taking into account that Society causes us to make less \nintelligent theories. During Einsteins and Newtons time, they were less \naffected by the dumbasses in society because nothing was established back \nthen. Newton and Einstein used Classical mechanics, Not Quantum. It shows \nthat Classical or Basic are the most accurate theories. Quantum mechanics \nare complex, Classical is basic. Logically, complexity derives from \nsimplicity, not the other way around.\nThats why String theory is bullshit, its affected by our ignorant current \nday society who has no regard for basic foundation, so they try to make one \nthrough their own bullshit.\n\nI have just as much credibility as Kaku. Kaku started out as a regular \nhuman being just like me and focused his life they way he wanted it to.\nIf you think having Credentials determines what kind of person you are, \nyoure a dumbass blinded by society.

                    "text": "+DunnsDayDash .\nThe first thing you were talking about--that which keeps particles \ntogether, was finally uncovered in Geneva using the LHC:  the Higgs Boson.\n\nIt is, in essence, what gives matter its mass.  When looking at everything \nthat has matter on the smallest scale, there is more distance between each \nparticle that there is of the particles themselves.  Here's a kind of \ngraphic example:\n\no    o    o    o\no    o    o    o\n\nThe space between particles causes physicists to wonder what held us, and \neverything else, together.  They postulated a particle, which they \ndiscovered in the recent years (within the last two, I believe).\n\nAs far as dimensions, there are four, the fourth being time/space-time.  \nAnd +Brian Rush is correct, that the dimensions are not outside of ours, \nbut are layered on top/inside and are very much a part of our universe.\n\nThe easiest way to explain multiple dimensions is in this example (not \nmine):\n\nImagine an ant on a flat piece of paper.  You've drawn a square around it, \nand the ant cannot move outside of the square, and is relegated to this 2-D \nplane.  You tell the ant, \"Leave your square,\" but the ant says, \"I can't.\"\n\nYou tell him, \"Sure you can, just hope off the paper into the third \ndimension!\"\n\n\"What third dimension,\" he asks?  \"I'm stuck on this paper!\"\n\n\"The third dimension!  Just leave the paper--step into the third dimension, \nand land back outside the square!\"\n\nThis is similar to how its explained regarding other dimensions.  You're \nnow in a 3-D box, and some being talks to you, saying, \"Just step into the \nfifth/eighth/etc dimension!\"\n\nAs far as the big bang, you can call it what you like, but evidence gives \nus great reason to think that everything started at one point.  No deity or \nreligion is even remotely close to the big bang, as those are all myth with \nno foundation at all in reality (no tangible, verifiable evidence), while \nthe big bang is a well-tested theory.  By the way, in science, a \"theory\" \nis the highest appellation an idea can attain.  You can try to use that \nterm against it, but then you'd be forgetting that we call the spread of \ndisease Germ Theory, or the force that pulls us down and keeps the planets \nin orbit Gravitational Theory (and also Perturbation Theory).  So just \nbecause any god is unprovable, does not mean that the big bang is also.  If \nthe big bang is ultimately unprovable, then it's because it's unprovable \n(though there's no reason to yet believe it is).  It's still undeniable, if \nyou understand the evidence, to think that such an event likely occurred.\n\nAlso, if you start understanding quantum mechanics, then String Theory \nseems less like bullshit.  It's not finished yet by any means, but many \nwould've said the same to Newton or Einstein before those ideas could be \ntested.  In fact, it's quite common, and also quite arrogant, so say we \ncannot or will not discover or learn those things.  Just because you \ncannot, does not mean that others cannot either.  After all, Newton was \nonly one of the founders that explained our solar system, but ultimately \ndidn't explain all of it.  Newton reached a limit.  It was Huygens who \nexpanded on them, and then Laplace after that.\n\nAnd it might just be me who feels this way, but you really have no \ncredibility to say that Kaku is wrong, unless you're also a physicist, in \nwhich case I encourage you to submit your credentials.  Simply saying \"he's \nwrong\" does you no justice.  There's actually a good reason why he's \nregarded as one of the greatest theoretical physicists of our time, and \nit's not because people simply like him.\n\nAnyway, I hope this all makes sense!

And since God is beyond our understanding, so is \nthe Big Bang. \n\nThus, string theory or any theory that attempts to touch that subject is \nalready bullshit.

For one, if \nyou're brain was capable enough to think abstractly you would kno that \nliterally everything known to man is just a theory. Nothing can absolutely \nbe proven. Not math, no law, or anything. Who's to say 1+ 1 =2? Galileo? \nWhy does our universe stay intact and not fly apart? Dark Matter? \nEverything is theory my friend. The 'advances' in science is merely what \nhumans agree upon to be real. Us, imperfect knowing humans that achieve to \nfind the purpose in life to help us sleep better at night. The only thing \nthat is real is what you believe is to be real. A prime example of this is \npeople born into certain cultures and realities believe that what they were \nraised in was right and through what they saw in their surroundings. Your \nemotions are real, feeling happiness and sadness and realizing all \nspectrums of emotions is real. Who's to say that this reality is real and \ndreaming is not? What do you think imagination is? How is it that a human \nbeing is able to create or invent certain objects. Before the computer was \ninvented, there was no thought of the computer, but somehow someone was \nable to gather a collection of idea through their imagination to create \nthis intimate object. You my friend are brainwashed into society and \nthinking just one way or another. You were born into your society believe \nthat you think is right, instead of holding true to all aspects of life and \nall cultures. Your believe has a powerful hold on you, the only thing that \nis real about yourself is what you believe is to be real. How is what I \nproclaimed to you new age? This has been practiced and studied for \nthousands of years. Zeus, Jahova, God, all these religious 'kings' if you \nwill is no more real than any other god.",

It is the one \ntrue guarantee that nearly every animal (save for a certain type of \njellyfish), no matter how well it is taken care of, will eventually die. \nTherefore, the removal thereof is immortality. It means transcending the \nlimits of age.\n\nHowever, as noted, the removal of the Hayflick limit results in the \nproduction of cancer cells. This is the primary reason why application of \ntelomerase in humans is not recommended. While it can reverse aging, like a \nfountain of youth of sorts, it would also almost inevitably cause the \nformation of cancer cells in the process.\n\nThe statement you quoted me saying is correct. There are cells that do not \nsuffer from aging-related deterioration, that is, they are not subject to \nthe Hayflick limit. They are cancer cells. And scientists have already \ndiscovered a way to engineer them within humans using telomerase. So, which \npart of my statement, exactly, was wrong?\n(Let alone \"silly\", as you tend to call Nobel-prize winning scientific \ndiscoveries)\n\nIt's nice that you're reading up on the Hayflick limit enough to post \nquotes. Too bad you're not paying enough attention to consider what it \nactually means.\n\nOne last thing: \"a complete neglect for common sense\"\n\"Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.\" - \nAlbert Einstein\n\nStop assuming anything you think is true, actually is.

Prior to Leonard \nHayflick's theory, Alexis Carrel hypothesized that all normal somatic cells \nwere immortal.[3]\"\n\nA few scientists arguing over semantics, culminating in a book titled *The \nImmortal Cell* is not anything to run wild with in terms of human \nimmortality. \n\nIf I was interested in biological immortality, I would take up more \ninterest in the lobster or jellyfish than in cancer.

For instance, relative to its size, \na mouse would have better land speed traversing through a maze, compared to \na human traveling a scaled-up version of the same maze. A human using \nwritten or verbal clues in human language would have a clear unfair \nadvantage over a mouse which doesn't use the same language (and, possibly, \nno language at all). On a less obvious level, any information a human has \nlearned during his life time could pose an unfair advantage, just as \nallowing a mouse to pre-memorize a maze would equally be unfair. Also, \nvisual clues may be received differently by humans and mice, due to \ndifferent eye configuration. A mouse could also rely more on scent than a \nhuman would tend to do.

Of course one is more intelligent with \nregards to their preferred method, but outside of that, can you \nconclusively say that one is more intelligent than the other, based upon \nthe definition of intelligence I have stated?",

Your attempt to redefine death as \nanything other than \"the cessation of biological activities\" is, quite \nfrankly, pathetic. Life and death has little to do with energy states.\n\nEven if a person is placed in a sterile environment, regularly fed, and \nnever receives any external harm, that person would STILL DIE. Even if \nthere was a miracle cure for all ailments, and a perfect treatment for \ncancer, this would not change. The person's cells would simply reach their \ntelomer end-life, and then the person would suffer from organ failure. Even \nif the person was somehow kept artificially alive, the person would simply \nreach the point in which every original cell had died.\n\nCancer, however, WOULD NOT. If you keep it regularly fed, and don't subject \nit to any external trauma or lethal radiation, it would live forever. It \nwould remain active and feeding and replicating, forever. Obviously, if you \ntoss it into a black hole, it would die. But if you don't intentionally \ncause it harm (and please don't make this debate any more philosophical by \ngoing \"And what if I accidentally cause it harm?\"), or starve it, it would \nnot. THAT is immortality.",

All energetic configurations naturally decay over time, but the \nenergy is never destroyed. When we say something \"dies\", we really mean \nthat its specific energetic or chemical configuration falls apart and \nenergy dissipates into other configurations. Of course if you remove the \npossibility of \"physical damage\" (or, physical interactions which result in \nthe whole or partial destruction of the configuration), then the \nconfiguration will be preserved, but that can also be achieved with other \nmeans like freezing a biological cell at absolute zero -- it doesn't mean \nthat biological cells are \"immortal\", it just means that they're incredibly \nstable in certain environments, and slightly unstable in others, such that \nthey naturally decay over time. \n\nA cancer cell can die due to failure of an organelle caused by radioactive \nexposure, causing the cell's processes to corrupt or otherwise fail.  \n\nA human being can die due to failure of an organ caused by cancer \nproliferation, causing the organ's processes to corrupt or otherwise fail. \n\nSo, neither are \"immortal\" in the sense that they transcend mortality and \nresult in an eternal configuration or process.

And you seem to dislike the use of the period as well) \nsaying the exact opposite of everything I said.\n\nI'll give a tangible example, so it doesn't sound like I'm just throwing \nstuff in the air. You've said \"if a man was to be freed from all boundaries \nof society, he would ultimately find his genius one way or another\". But \nI've clearly explained that most tangible accomplishments, or even mundane \ntasks, done by humans were the result of humans living in a society made of \nand by humans. My claim was clearly that if you take a human away from the \ncompany of other humans, he would become hapless and incompetent, the polar \nopposite of \"genius\". Rather, it would allow his inner moron to thrive.\nI have no illusion about lasting more than a few minutes away from the \ncomfort of my home, built by other people, and the technology within it, \nalso made by other people.

The person would look for the instructions, ask other people, \ncheck on Google, etc. In a sterile room, with no other humans, no methods \nof communication, and no prior training or experience in how to operate \nsaid doohickey or similar such, a human would have issues simply \"figuring \nit out\" alone.\nNow switch the human up with a mouse, and place some cheese inside the \ndoohickey instead of cash. Even if other mice are present, mice don't have \na concept of language at a level that allows them to pool together their \nbrain power. A mouse certainly can't read instructions, and most definitely \ncan't search for a solution on Google. The mouse would have \"figuring it \nout alone\" as the go-to solution. However, having no other tools to turn \nto, allows mice to be specialists in \"figuring it out alone\". The mouse \nwould poke, and prod, and experiment, and eventually figure it out. And it \nwould accomplish this in less time than a human would.",

He \nclaims a thermostat has a \"unit of consciousness,\" which he conveniently \ndoes not clearly define further than extremely vague language.  He says \nthat a thermostat \"senses\" the temperature around it.  What does he mean by \n\"senses?\" A thermostat responds to thermodynamic properties of the air \nsurrounding it through the transmission of electrical forces between \ncolliding atoms, and those changes create a cascade of physical and \nchemical transmissions in a linear fashion. There is no structure in this \nsystem which builds a model of the stimuli. The thermostat does not \"sense\" \nanything, unless you want to change the definition of what \"sense\" means.\n\nA flower does not \"understand\" the temperature or gravity of its \nsurroundings, it only behaves according to reflexes inherent to its \nneurochemical structure, but again there is no neurological structure which \nbuilds a predictive model to understand the outside world.  \n\nTo understand something, that indicates a predictive learning algorithm \nwhich can predict the outcomes of a system based on the networked structure \nof the algorithm. It is still a cascade of chemical and electrical signals, \nbut the important element here is the *structure* of the signals. \n Consciousness does not comprise mere physical interactions between \nmolecules, but an overall meaningful arrangement of those molecules who's \nfinal states are determined by an algorithm built (learned) by prior \nsensory input.

Isn't their more \nimportant things to spend money on in the EU? Like helping people get jobs \nand educations. The old version of it was in my State. What would be the \npoint of finding a piece of \"the other side\". What would they intended to \ndo with their findings? Make another weapon more chaotic then the discovery \nof the Atom Bomb?

That is true. Well, if their was a God just like \nthe Bible claims, wouldn't God do whatever it took ... time after time \nafter time again?\n\n This is soo deep. I could write a book about it. I wouldn't make a claim \nunless science has or could(with-in the realm of possibility) back it up. I \nthink their is a move in Hinduism like this as well.
