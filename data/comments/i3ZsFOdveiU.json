(which is the reason if fixing these \nwindows, one must start from the top, it might spring on you and fall if \nstarting from the bottom and sides like with float generally)\n\nmouthblown glass is still used in some museum buildings etc, but its blown \nmuch thicker than they used to so it doesn\u00b4t have the curving issue \nanymore.

If i \nremember right, old methods of making flat(ish) glass was using a \ncentrifuge which actually made the glass slightly thicker at the outer \npoints, which is why you find old pieces of glass appear slightly wavy or \nthat vary in thickness from one edge to the other. some glass is still made \nlike that for specific purposes (focusing mirrors for large mirror \ntelescopes)",

Basically, the less surface area a conducting \nobject has (or better yet, the smaller the radius), the smaller the amount \nof energy it can store before breaking down and produce a \"spark\". This is \nwhy a Van de Graaff (yes I had to look up how to spell that) electrostatic \ngenerator is a giant metal sphere whit no sharp edges. This optimizes the \ncharge in can hold (or the amount of energy) without \"sparking\" (I believe \nthe scientific term for the spark is 'corona'). Another fantastic example \nof this idea is a capacitor. These are battery like objects composed of two \nthin metal foil sheets rolled up with a sheet of a non conducting material \nin between them, and stuck in a small cylinder The size of the sheets and \nthe efficiency of the non conducting material between them are directly \nrelated to the amount of energy these capacitors can hold. The best proof \nthough is to look at the equations for voltage, energy fields, potential \nenergy, potential energy of a field, and notice that all of them have 'r' \nin the denominator standing for 'radius'. This is my best guess; I'll admit \nI'm not positive. ",

But let me explain some of the things you may be \nfeeling.\n\nThe microwave has a fan, so you might actually be experiencing wind. Also \nthe plastic front can generate static electricity. It either shocks you or \nit doesn't. Static is not bad for health persay. As I explained above, the \nwavelength of microwaves (a few inches)  is too big to pass through the \nsmall little holes. So whatever you are feeling, it's not microwaves. It \ncan be a number of other things. Light, X-Ray, Gamma rays. Lucky for you, \nthe generator and wave guides used in a microwave is unable to generate \nsuch frequencies.\n\nWhile you may stay away from wifi and cellphones, you are still being \nbombarded by radio waves, cosmic radiation, satellite radiation and natural \nbackground radiation from things like bananas and concrete. So no escape \nfor you unfortunately. You are bathed in radiation like the rest of us.\n\nAs a species, we understand the principles and manipulation of EM radiation \nbetter then we understand the flu. So don't fret, you'll survive.\n\n\nIf it really bothers you, pick up a second hand oscilloscope and probe \naround the house for sources of EMF.",
