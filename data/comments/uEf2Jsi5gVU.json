She should be bald like her \nfather since they're both scummy parasites and have no concern for the \nConstitution or the people of the United States (except for Israel, of \ncourse).  What a terrible Vice President Cheney made and how evil was the \nlegislation he helped put into action as a consequence of 9/11.  And this \nis to say nothing of the many murders Cheney committed.  We're still \nsuffering from all his evil actions fourteen years later, and his evil \nspawn, a man-hating Lesbian, wants to be in the Senate?  I guess the Senate \nis also the terrain for other succubi and demons, other than Hilary, \nFeinstein, Boxer, Pelosi.  How can Elizabeth Warren stand their company?\ufeff",
