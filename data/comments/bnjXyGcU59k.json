The \ngame deliberately is ambiguous about who started shooting nukes first.. the \nimplication, after China lost their invasion of Alaska.. they did so in a \ncataclysmic act of defiance..\n.\nBut if you read most of the materials, logs.. it becomes clear they want \neveryone to find their own conclusion.. as there are hints that just about \neveryone in any position of power was either corrupt, or stone cold evil..\n.\n1. The US government is shown becoming extremely authoritarian\n2. The Chinese, just as evil as we have known communist China to be.\n3. Every corporation is run by psychotics experimenting on other human \nbeings.\n4. religious groups are displayed as cults, dangerous... except for the \nMormon survivors who still remember their Christian past.\n5. Mothership Zeta.. one prisoner log explicitly tells the aliens were \ntorturing an American officer for the nuclear strike codes..\n.\nNo. 5 is the compelling one in my view... The US won in Alaska.. China was \nbeaten, retreating, but secure in their own country.. the Corporations,.. \nmight, might have had the ability.. but no clear motive.. the religious \ncults lacked the ability.. but.. aliens who had been observing man for \ncenturies.. suddenly wanted the launch codes?..\n.\nFull disclosure, I'm a USAF vet, assigned as a security forces SP nuclear \nweapons security at a SAC missile base, FE Warren AFB during the last years \nof the cold war.. I read everything, and know quite a bit about the history \nof it.. the game is fun.. and touches the occasional nerve... but I enjoyed \nit a lot.. I just don't see the US and China being so crazy as to start WW \nIII in a fit of anger.. not rational.. and I know that the president before \na launch order is obeyed, must have verbal confirmation from two cabinet \nlevel officials that he/she is unimpaired, rational.. not under duress.. a \ndrunken president couldn't launch a strike.. the system is designed to \nblock that.. true this is just a fictional game.. but seriously.. it just \nmakes more sense that the grey aliens caused the war to devastate humanity \nso they could claim the Earth..\n.\nso no.. I don't believe humans caused the war.... they did everything to \nmake it possible.. but didn't strike the match..\ufeff",

I am \nstill wondering where the good creative times are. I have been playing \nnes/snes games for a couple of years and it seems like a pattern to me. \nSure there are a few nice interesting games and even the clones are really \nnice even if the plot is really the only difference. or if there is a \nslight change in gameplay. but i don't find the games super ultra creative. \nIt's just a part of the twisted way that publishers work.

If you think about it, any progress that the \nwasteland makes is from working with the broken down (and in some cases \nirreparable) technology of the past.

I'll admit that if the Enclave had done that, their \nactions would've been less reckless than if they had not. There's nothing \nin the lore that suggests they did this though. Interesting fact: Turns out \nthat the Enlcave's FEV was actually more indiscriminate than we thought. It \nkilled pure humans too. It just took longer.

It may very well \nhave been perfectly stable when they released it into the jet stream or \nthrough project purity.\n\nFunny thing about viruses though; they have a tendency to evolve. Just \nbecause the virus is only targeting those exposed to radiation now, doesn't \nmean it won't be doing something else 20 or even 10 years down the line, \nespecially when you consider that they are releasing it into the radiation \nsoaked wasteland, which is a breeding ground for random mutation.\n\nWhat's more, they weren't even administering it in small doses to specific \npopulations. They were going to release it into the air. It would've fallen \neverywhere; the water, the soil, any mutated animals that may have been \nused for livestock... Nowhere would be safe. If the virus changed and began \nattacking indiscriminately or perhaps reverted to it's original purpose and \nbegan mutating those infected into super mutants, what would the Enclave do \nthen? Was that even taken consideration before they approved this act of \nmass genocide?\n\nOf course not, because again, they are warped at their very core. They \nweren't worried about the ramifications of releasing a deadly toxin into \nthe air. They only cared about eliminating the \"muties\". (And taking power, \nwhich, despite all their anti-mutant talk, is what I believe is their true \nmotivation) That's the only way such a thing could be approved. Because \nanyone with half a rational mind and any knowledge of science would've seen \nthe litany of problems that could come as a result of their actions. That \nalone proves them to be short-sighted and reckless.\n\nAgain, you're giving the Enclave and their \"struggle\" more credit than \nthey're worth. While the FEV was a virus at its core, the Enclave culling \nstrain was far more comparable to a dose of cyanide than a plague. It was \nso toxic that a 0.001% aerosol solution of the stuff could kill someone \nwith minimal radiation exposure in under an hour. (And that's a nukepedia \nstat taken from Fallout 2. I'm not making that up.) This was not going to \nbe \"hundreds of years\". They would've wiped out the populace in a matter of \ndays, if even that long. And while it is true that the Enclave held off \nbefore showing themselves, it was only so they could ensure their \ntechnological superiority to other groups in the wasteland.\n\nThis goes back to my former point, which was that the Enclave didn't need \nto resort to this method. If anyone could handled the challenges of the new \nworld, it was them, making it all the more outrageous that they would make \na move to wipe out the populace (in such a reckless manner no less) without \neven trying other methods.\n\nLong story short, even if you subscribe to the Enclave's twisted vision and \nmorality, their chosen method of attaining this \"New America\" can not in \nany way, shape or form be considered rational.

Remember, when the Enclave was talking about wiping out the \n\"muties\" they weren't talking about marching into the wasteland and killing \nthem. They planned to release a modified FEV into the jet stream over the \nwasteland and wait for the toxin to kill everyone off. I don't see how that \ncould even come close to being as difficult as uniting the wasteland via \ndiplomacy/force. The only challenging part would be the development of the \nFEV strain, and given the Enclave's technology, creating a toxin seems like \nsquandered potential. They could focus their efforts into finding a way to \nreverse the effects of radiation and cure the \"muties\" or find ways to \nprevent any mutations from being passed on to the next generation. (Both \nmore benevolent goals)\n\nAnd no, I don't think there would be. The FEV would've wiped out most of \nthe populace. That means the NCR, the BoS, the Legion... poof! Gone. Or if \nnot gone, then at least reduced to a state where any resistance would be \npointless. The only people who could've potentially challenged them \nafterward would be the remaining vault dwellers, and frankly, with the \nmilitary might of the Enclave, I feel that would be more of a slaughter \nthan a war.\n\nPerhaps that is what characterizes the Enclave, but that doesn't justify \ntheir position. If anything, it undermines it, seeing as compromise and \ninclusion of various groups were some of the primary principles upon which \nthe nation they claim to be representing was founded. Also, diplomatic \nbehavior is hardly as risky as releasing an experimental virus into the \nair. That could've backfired in so many ways, both immediately and in the \nlong run. It was downright reckless, which again, shows just how warped the \nEnclave is if they felt it was the \"best solution\".\n\nAgain, even if they felt that their organization were the most fit to rule, \ntheir endorsement of wiping out the entire wasteland without consideration \nfor the consequences of such an action or looking into less extreme options \nproves that they aren't, especially since out of all the groups in the \nwasteland, they were the best equipped to pursue these alternative options. \n(Hopefully this is a bit shorter.

The Enclave is, at best, a \ndisjointed band of high-tech raiders with a military structure, at worst? \nThey're just individuals fighting a losing battle. The Outcasts may be in a \nbetter position, but indications from Veronica seem to give the idea that \nthe war with the Outcasts in the Capitol Wasteland ended sometime in the 4 \nyears between 3 and New Vegas.\n\nI honestly think the Enclave needs a break. Really, it does. If they bring \nback the Enclave they should wait a game or two, make it remotely plausible \nthat they could regroup and recuperate or just have them be wiped out \nentirely. They've had multiple organization-breaking defeats. The Oil Rig, \nthe loss of Raven Rock, the loss of the Purifier, and the destruction of \nthe Base Crawler. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they were wiped \noff the face of the map in the grand scheme of things. They've had their \ntime.

Fallout is a time skip with an \nalternation in human history, as for TES it is a completely fictional world \nwith tons of stuff from human mythology and medieval/Anglo Saxon/Norse \nconcepts. Fallout is a game where WWIII broke out in 2077, people lived in \nvaults for 75-100+ years give or take and started to rebuild with many road \nblocks of progress with factions of people contesting power to gain control \nfor better or for worse.

A builder puts a lot of effort into building a house based off a \nblue print. But in this case, the builder didn't contribute anything to \nthat blueprint.

This stuff is so scattered, so \nit is cool that someone put it together in a video's. Believe me. I'm a \nhuge fan of Fallout since first part i got in 90,s. I was using a english \ndictionary to go through it. Back then i could barely understand 10% of it, \nmy english sucked so much. It forced me to learn english to the point i \nknow it now (i know it still sucks, but it is way better now). 1st part i \nfinished at least 20 times, second even more, 3rd only once and i'm still \nplaying New Vegas, played it today btw. Even tried online version made by \nrussians (fonline2238). I'm a sort of Fallout junkie and things like that \nalways make me happy, after big disappointment with van Buren. When i found \nout about Interplay pumping money in Bravehearth instead of F3, i wanted to \nsuicide bomb those fuckers ;). So forgive me blindness but i'm really \nhappy, when i see someone even more crazy about it, to contribute to it. \nAnd i'm not waiting for Fallout 4 made by those jerks from Bethesda.

I will refer back to Junktown in Fallout 1 with Killian \nDarkwater and Gizmo the crime lord. It is stated at the end of the game in \nthe slide show that Killian Darkwater enforces a style of brutal frontier \njustice. The game makes it seem like Gizmo though not a good person would \nbe more relaxed. While Killian would be strict. That is the point Fallout \nis trying to make. This carries on into Fallout 2 with the NCR. Not many \npeople like the NCR. The NCR would be a big government nanny state type of \ngovernment and it wouldn't sit well with people who are used to the anarchy \nand lawlessness of the wasteland.",

                "text": "I'll always stay loyal to the Enclave. I served as what I like to call \n\"Eden's Apostle\" in Fallout 3. Here is my story. Sit back and enjoy reading \nthis. It'll take a while, but it was the best run I've had in my six years \nof playing. I wiped out all Brotherhood of Steel Soldiers, Ghouls both \nFeral and Domestic, and Mutants. The aforementioned groups include Star \nPaladin Cross, Charon, and Fawkes. All with Dogmeat by my side. I helped \nthe people of Megaton, seeing them as hard-working Americans who were \ndeserving of life. I let the Ghouls take over Tenpenny Tower to destroy the \nSupremacists who inhabited it. Before killing off the Ghouls themselves and \nconfiscating all worth while inventory inside to take with me. Leaving \nTenpenny Tower to rot. I then moved on to Rivet City. I killed Zimmerman \nand his Guard after receiving A3-21's Plasma Rifle. I later disposed of all \nRivet City Security members including Harkness and Commander Danvers. I \nkilled them so that Rivet City could be easily controlled by the Enclave. \nBesides, Rivet City residents were worthy of life as they conducted \nresearch and Abraham Washington had a Collection of Historic Documents that \nshould be preserved and appreciated as such. I then traversed the wastes \nuntil arriving at the Republic of Dave. I aided in the Election of Rosy to \nend Dave's Hierarchy. I followed Dave to a secure location before offing \nhim. Leaving his body to fester in the harsh sun of the wastes. Arriving \nlater at Galaxy News Radio, I aided those pathetic BoS Soldiers in \ndefeating the Mutants in the battle to the Radio Station. Of course I \nallowed the Behemoth to kill all Brotherhood of Steel Soldiers possible \nbefore killing the monstrosity with the Plasma Rifle. Confiscating the Fat \nMan and all it's Mini Nukes for a future collection so that no further \nRadiation could be spread. I went on a quest for Three Dog to retrieve a \nSatellite Dish for his station. Thinking that he was worthy of the life he \nhad been given, I complied. Then, I arrived in the Mall Plaza. Avoiding \ncertain Destruction by the Muties outside, I ducked into the Museum of \nTechnology to retrieve the Dish as well as complete the puzzle for the \nXuanlong Assault Rifle for later. I would later cleanse the Area after \nbeing better equipped for the War that lay there. Returning to the open \nWastes after placing the Dish for Three Dog. I found the Areas known as \nParadise Falls and Temple of the Union. I quickly earned the trust of the \nSlavers after gaining entry via enslaving three Individuals. I quickly \ndisposed of the fools and set all the Slaves free except the Ghoul. Whom I \nkilled. After working for the Leader of the Temple of the Union. I \nrecovered all the Lincoln items at the Museum of History. Killing all Feral \nGhouls that stood in my way. I then disposed of all the Slavers at the \nLincoln Memorial and disarmed all the mines surrounding it. Letting the \npeople know that I had retrieved the Reference Picture and that the Slavers \nwere no longer a threat. I allowed them to live as they swore to rebuild \nthe Memorial. Which they did. Returning to the Museum of History. I \ndiscovered the cesspool known as Underworld. I met a Doctor who had a human \ngirl in his care. Her name was Riley. She informed me that her Team, the \nRiley's Rangers, were trapped and needed help. I got Riley out of there and \naided her team before accepting a quest from a ghoul named Mister \nCrowley. This led me to kill off or in some cases bargain for some keys \nfrom Ghoul Haters. I saved only one because he was a citizen of Rivet City \nand he was young. The key holders gave me clues that led me to a hidden \nbunker and warhead warehouse where I retrieved some Advanced Power \nArmor and Confiscated all Weapons and Ammo from the two Armories nearby. I \nreturned to Underworld, working for another ghoul named Ahzrukhal to off a \nghoul named Greta. After that, I received the Contract of a Ghoul Servant \nnamed Charon. Charon killed his former boss and I led him outside. Directly \noutside the Museum, I killed Charon. As well as the Ghoul who wandered \naround the Metro station in front of the Museum. I returned to Underworld \nfor the Final Time to cleanse the Area. I.E. Murder every single Inhabitant \nin Underworld with the exception of Cerberus(A Military Robot) who secretly \nhated the Ghouls. Leaving him to guard the place from future undesirables \ninhabiting the Area. Along the way, I had discovered a place known as Fort \nIndependence. Inhabited by Brotherhood Outcasts. Originally, I let them \nlive. But refused to bring them any supplies. Later, Eden said that they \nwere no better. So I killed them all and raided their Armory. Taking \neverything worth while. Including Alien Power Cells, Missiles, Mini-Nukes, \nand a Special Missile Launcher. This led me to the Town of Andale, a \nCannibalistic Town which I quickly cleansed of its criminally insane \npeople. Leaving the local Elder, who didn't eat other people, to raise the \nChildren the correct way. I eventually met with a child named Bryan Wilkes, \nhe'd lost his Father. So I chose to help him out in solving what had killed \nhis Father and I made it a personal obligation to kill whoever caused it. \nDiscovering it was Genetically modified Giant Ants, I found notes on a \nComputer owned by a Doctor Lesko. The Ants had been given the ability to \nbreathe Fire. I ducked into the Metro Station, where Lesko had been hiding. \nAfter killing the Fire Ant Nest Guardians. I disposed of the Queen. Then \nturned my gun on the Robot inhabiting the same room. I then looked at \nLesko's Terminal and destroyed the serum that had caused this terrible \nevent. I returned to Lesko and he offered me a Genetic Enhancement after \ngiving me an extra incentive in his old Lab Coat. I refused the \nEnhancement. I was not letting some Doctor inject me with some Mutagen. I \nwas not becoming a Mutant. I shot Lesko and then found a home for \nBryan with his Aunt Vera in Rivet City. Finally satisfied with the \nsituation in the General Wastes. I set out to gain entry to the Citadel and \ncause an Implosion of the Brotherhood of Steel. Ending their foolish game \nonce and for all. I began working for Doctor Li, the chief Scientist at \nRivet City. Her clues about my Father led me to the hidden Vault beneath \nSmith Casey's Garage. After receiving a Vault suit, I entered a simulation \nthat I quickly terminated with the failsafe. Reunited with my Father. We \nran to the Jefferson Memorial which I had cleansed of Mutants earlier. \nAlong with the Scientists of Rivet City. We began quick reconstruction of \nthe Project known as Project Purity. As I completed the preparations. \nVertibirds began landing at the Memorial. My brothers in arms had arrived. \n Avoiding all Enclave Soldiers so that I would not kill these obviously \ntrusted Soldiers. I went to the Purifier Room. Where my Father had a \nconfrontation with the Colonel of the Enclave. Ultimately deciding to fight \nthe Enclave at the cost of his own life. As he fell to the ground. I looked \ndown upon him and said \"You picked the wrong side Dad...\" I escaped the \nFacility with Rivet City Scientists. Leading me to the Citadel where we \ngained entry and I met the Elder of the BoS. He allowed me to learn how to \nproperly use Power Armor and I quickly rose in the Ranks until it reached a \nhead at the siege on Project Purity. Prior to this, I had met a Super \nMutant named Fawkes. Whom I used to take the blows as I tailed behind to \neliminate all other mutants. I confiscated his Special Super Sledge and \nretrieved a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Or G.E.C.K. for short. As I left, \nI was sedated by Colonel Autumn and Two Enclave Elites. Awakening in the \nRaven Rock Bunker. I had no choice but to refuse to comply with the Colonel \nas the President seemed adamant toward him. Traveling through the base, I \nmet with Nathan. A Megaton Citizen whom I had treated well as he reveled in \nsupport of the Enclave. With his uttering of \"They aren't who they say they \nare!\" I turned my trusted Plasma Rifle upon him and yelled \"Traitor\" as I \nended his life swiftly. The Colonel soon turned the Enclave against me \ndespite the Presidents wishes to speak with me in peace. I fought through \nthese Soldiers who seemed to serve the Colonel more then my Leader, \nPresident Eden. We eventually met face to face. I accepted his presence as \nan Artificial Intelligence and complied with his order to take the F.E.V. \nVirus and pocketing it. I spoke as long as I could with my Leader before \nbidding him farewell for the first and final time. I kept in mind that he \nhad a growing dispute with Colonel Autumn. Confident to dispose of the \nTraitor named Autumn, I set out to the Citadel. We now arrive at the siege \non Project Purity where I aided those Brotherhood of Steel idiots. I met \nColonel Autumn and then shot him in the interest of preserving the further \ninfection of his poisonous tongue that had corrupted the Enclave in \nWashington D.C. before inserting the F.E.V. Virus into the Purifier \nand Sacrificing myself in the name of the Enclave. Waking up two weeks \nlater. I was disappointed to see that the Brotherhood had survived. I \nagreed to aid them further in the interest of not raising suspicion and \nimmediately returned to Raven Rock for further orders from my Leader, John \nHenry Eden. When I arrived, it had been sealed up beneath collapsed rocks \nand rubble. Convinced it was the work of the BoS. I worked with increased \nvigor. A Lone Wolf fueled by Vengeance only accompanied by my furry friend \nnamed Dogmeat. I worked for the BoS. Destroying the remnants of the Enclave \nwho continued the work of Colonel Autumn as contact with the President was \nimpossible. I was forced to destroy what I had loved, so that I may rebuild \nit as Eden had wanted it. My quest led me to Old Olney, a Deathclaw \ninfested cesspool that held a secret bunker beneath it that led to a Store. \nI would make this Bunker my home. Ensuring that the Relics of American \nHistory I had collected along the way would be safe from harm. Guarded on \nthe surface by the Deathclaws, and beneath by Mines and myself when I was \nhome. At the end of our story, I was led to Adam's Air force Base. Where I \nwas forced to combat tons of Enclave Traitors. Killing them all, far and \nwide across the base. Not a single Traitor lived. I walked up and down the \nArea at least three times. I then boarded the Enclave Air Craft Carrier I \nhad been sent to destroy. I fought and killed every single Traitor before \nreaching a Missile Launch Sequence Computer. I was sent here to launch it \nat the Enclave Air Craft Carrier that I was inside and then flee before \nthey were able to strike. However, I had another option. The Citadel. A \nsmile came across my face. I chose the Citadel before boarding a stolen \nVertibird with the BoS Elder's Daughter and others. When we arrived, much \nto my delight and their dismay. The Citadel had been destroyed. With my \nfurry friend by my side. We finished what I had dreamt of all along. We \nannihilated the last members of the BoS in Washington D.C. including the \nElder's Daughter, Sentinel Lyons. Upon entering the gate to the Citadel. \nThe building was completely gone. Leaving a mysterious Door at the bottom. \nInstantly, I remembered Eden's story about the BoS having access to some \nMilitary Grade Tech. I entered the Door to discover the Pentagon's Armory. \nA place long forgotten, buried beneath the Citadel. I retrieved Callahan's \nMagnum from a Safe as well as taking every piece of Weaponry there so that \nno lowly raiders could take this beautiful technology. Returning to my \nbunker beneath the city of Old Olney. I placed all my American Artifacts in \nsecure locations. Placed all of my Medical Supplies in the Office \nDownstairs. I kept my Radaway with me, as I had never gotten Radiation \nPoisoning once and never intended to. I was never going to be a mutant. I \nstay there, keeping my Unique Items and Weapons with me at all times. \nColonel Autumns Coat serves as my Clothing at my Home in the Bunker and \nthe Winterized Combat Armor salvaged from a Simulation of the Operation in \nAnchorage Alaska. The Combat Armor never breaks and serves as my \nexploration outfit. This ends my story as President John Henry Eden's \nApostle.\ufeff",

Im \nmaking a social comment based on the general hostility a lot of old school \nfans have about the newer games. A reality you could probably see if you \nlooked through various youtube videos/comment sections. Sure, there are \npeople like you who like them all. I didn't account for that in my comment, \nbut I didn't really feel like it because the comment was more or less \nsupposed to be more of a generalized thing based off my own experiences. \nSorry I didn't include your minority group that happened to like all four \nof the games mentioned. But fact is, most people don't like change. That's \nwhy Fallout new vegas was met with lower ratings then fallout 3. That's \nalso why a lot of old school fans disliked the newer games. Because it \n\"lost the feel\" of the older games. That hardcore minimalist feel. Which I \nbelieve was better emulated in FNV. But anyway im tired and ranting now. \nSorry for the offense if offense was taken.",
