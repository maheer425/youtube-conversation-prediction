For example INTERFET, a \nUN force that was mostly made up out of forces from the Australian Defence \nForce and the New Zealand Defence Force who were deployed at the request of \na fledgling nation freed from violent oppression after decades who faced \nstate sponsored militia groups spreading terror and destroying \ninfrastructure along with withdrawing military forces who were forcibly \nrelocating Timorese residents back into Indonesian controlled territory. \nWhilst East Timor has faced many challenges since, and admittedly \nAustralian military intervention has become necessary on a number of \noccasions to supplement their police force after the initial effort, the \nwork of INTERFET and UNATET forces stabilising the region at least for the \ntime being stopped quite alot of innocent blood being spilled and was able \nto help the nation find its feet. Military forces were also used to \ncomplete major reconstruction efforts and Special Forces were even used to \nmove into the highlands to deliver medical aid to remote communities on \noccasion. I understand that in certain situations the application of \nmilitary force can fuck things up even worse (*cough* Iraq *cough*)  but \nthere are times when it is needed in order to defend a people that do not \nhave the means to effectively defend themselves, so long as those people do \ninfact desire the assistance.  I remember someone once said, 'Violence can \nbe necessary at times, but only as a last resort,  its the solution to an \nissue that you are just aren't smart enough to solve any other way'. War is \nhorrible, but sometimes mounting a defence is necessary and sometimes that \nmeans defending allies, or at least that is the way I view it. ",

And as important and powerful as the Empathetic Circle is, it is \nvery easy to lose membership.

Last time I check, USA forbidden any religious teaching in public \nschool. Want to compare it to my birth country (Thailand)? They still have \nschool prayer and religion class is mandatory regardless of your faith. As \nbeing irreligious myself, I'm really happy to be in US school because if I \nsaid I don't believe in any religion back in my birth country, people would \nreact negatively, atheists are almost non-existent back there, where in US \nlike 1/4 to half of the people I met is atheist, agnostic, or \nnon-religious. \n\nJust because American is ignorance doesn't give an excuse for foreigners to \nbe ignorant of USA either, you know that you can't fight ignorance with \nignorance, they're a lot of things people don't know about USA, it's a very \ndiverse place. The problem is that people think they know enough about USA \nfrom the news, which just like any other case, it's not sufficient.

I have never \ndone something I didn't want to do at the time, except while under the \ninfluence of drugs. But even then, most of the stuff I did I would have \ndone sober.\n\nSome people just know hurting an animal is wrong, but why? - It gives them \npleasure. When I was a little kid I killed ants with fire and water, and \nimagined it was a huge war or whatever story I came up with at the moment. \nWhen my dad caught me, he scolded me and explained it was wrong. But I \ndidn't know or cared before that. Today I do martial arts and inflict a lot \nof pain on some people, but it's ok since it's agreed and I also take pain \nin return. Again, nothing special or higher force here. That's just natural \nselection working. From world history you can see that countries which can \nendure pain and inflict damage win wars, and secure their long-term \nexistance. Same happened to individuals in ages long past.\n\nor who is in this body that is conscious of it self being conscious? -I am \nme. And the bacteria inside my belly might be concious of their existance \neven if they are unaware of mine and I'm unaware of theirs. Same could be \nwith God.

You can't have a person without \na soul, nor can you have a soul without being a person. Since they are \ninseparanble during this plane of existance (I'll leave death open for all \nthe believers out there), there is no soul while you live. It is just \nanother name for living human being.

I cant prove which lies beyond world of form tho with \ntime if you will choose so you can understand or at list for now just keep \nit in mind as a reference for future, might come handy one day. Well the \nquestion is who is in control of your mind? You or some other force? And \nhence even seemingly good people do bad things out of the blue. By mind of \ncause I'm not talking about the brain, for brain is just taking care of the \nbody - in a way. When people heavily drunk hey are loosing control of their \nmind and some other force taking over that also through mind taking control \nover the body. I never lost my touch with \"right and wrong\" for I have \nnever lost touch with reality of life and I know directly as experience \nthat every part of life is par of the same life that I am and simply by \nhurting others I'm hurting my self. And I'm not physomanic sadistic Being \nwho enjoin hurting my self throw others at all. I have at most respect for \nother parts of lives even if they are exercising their free will and \ncreative power to torcher and kill other parts of life. However you can \nindeed loos connection to this inner moral compass by simply falling very \nlow in self awareness and accepting certain believes and thinking about \nlife that will block your natural connection to this part of your Being \nwhich some what of a spiritual nature I might say. The good thing is that \nyou can always reconnect to this part of yours but that will take a lot of \ncontemplation and questioning your inner thinking. Some times alcohol and \ndrugs making brain so distorted that you kind of loosing touch with 5 \ncences of your body and you starting to experience world beyond your normal \nperception - in a way it is freedom however you can reach such freedom \nwithout messing around with your body in the way that damages it, you can \ndo it by naturally growing in consciousness and undoing all toxic thinking \nwithin you that prevents you be naturally in a state of bliss and freedom. \nconsciousness does grow by evaluating its actions, by questioning its inner \nworld, by questioning its perception on self on life on other people, you \ncan grow however its a free will choice and I cant explain it in words - \nits imposable. You see, in general there is no wrong and right in human \nterms - there is only choices however you can clearly see that some choices \nare wrong in terms that they create suffer and not prosperity. You are a \ncreative Being and you have two natural choices of how you may exercise \nyour creative abilities - you either going to use them in a distraction \nmanner or in positive way. Having sex under drugs is just a choice however \nclearly this act will not produce any pure or positive experience or \nenergies. Likewise drinking is just a choice but we all know that in \ngeneral its not a healthy activity and often produces negative outcomes. \nKilling is wrong in a sense that it will produce suffer and negativity on \nall levels and it will only reinforce suffer in general for everything is \nenergies. After you snapping out of influence of drugs or low energies that \nmight have entered your mind you experience a more pure state of mind where \nYOU clearly can SEE that what you have done produces impure outcome and was \ndone based on impure thinking and hence led to poor choice making. Do you \nsee what Im trying to say here? Many people believe one thing today and \nanother tomorrow but realize that some things are universal. Some people \njust know hurting an animal is wrong, but why? If you will ask them they \nwont have any explanation at all they will tell you that they just know \nfrom within it is wrong choice to torture the creature. However later on \nyou can actually have wisdom based on this moral compass that will have \nprofound explanation why it is a wrong choice and why it will not benefit \nto any one or anything later on you can even reach the ultimate \nunderstanding and experience that all life is one in reality that expresses \nit self in different forms. To conclude, its true that consciousness is in \nterms are referring to self - for who is in this body that is conscious of \nit self being conscious? :) you are, you are that consciousness. However \nwords just words and you are beyond words, even tho you do have control \nover body, tho note that you don't have ultimate control of the body for \nits not you who is pumping the blood in the veins, but that's another \nmystery to solve :) the point is that life is much more then what science \ntells to people and what religion explains, it sooo much more. Questioning \nis the begging of all things, if you do that honestly you will progress far \nbeyond those who denies that there is something beyond theirs \"todays \nthinking about life\". People believed earth is flat, who says it was the \nonly delusion about life? Mind and self is the great mystery that can be \nknown throw growth and this I wish you sincerely :)",

                    "text": "+Ulrich Meintjes You're correct. Definitions do not create Scientific \nfacts, but Scientific facts fall under definitions. You have virtually no \nconcept on what the definition of Evolution is which is why you're so \nrepugnant in your Scientific views and ideology (I'm also positive that you \nprobably fall on some type of Creationism which has no proof other than the \nbook it belongs in saying so; which faith do you belong to? Keep in mind \ndust/mud is still dust/mud no matter how much \"magic\" your God applies to \nit). Finches may still be finches, but *the new species of Finch changed in \nDNA so much that they could no longer interbreed with the parent species* \n(a fact you've been trying ever so hard to ignore) which means they are no \nlonger the same species, which alone proves one species can become another \ndue to the fact Evolution does not teach an elephant becoming a horse \n(Despite what your retard parents slapped you into believing) but rather \nsmall changes along side Natural Selection, Sexual Selection, etc. leads to \ndrastic changes until eventually a new species is made (Micro Evolution -> \nMacro Evolution).\nYour comment also involves the idea that the changes in finches was because \nof recessive genes (\"inbreeding\"), however explain to me how there were \nmore than 4 (maximum number of alleles for beak sizes for 2 birds) all with \ndifferent beak sizes whilst retaining such similar characteristics with \nbirds of the same species? Answer: There must have been small changes but a \nfinch is still a finch >:(\nAnswer to answer: True, but if micro Evolution has been proven and you \nconsider the Earth is 4.54+-0.05 billion years old, why can't this be \nenough time for a massive change in species if only a few generations \nproduces new species?\nAnswer: STFU, GOD SAID SO.\nAs for sickle cell anaemia, the only reason the genes for this are so \nwidespread is because still retaining the recessive gene for the disease \ngives resistance to malaria so the original carrier for the gene had better \nsurvival chances and managed to fuck with people to make more people with \nthe gene. The anaemia is just a by-product of 2 recessive genes. Fool.\n(In case you forgot, I asked earlier which faith you belong to).",

Furthermore, I do \nnot dispute the definitions, they are merely a description of man-made \nconcepts that are necessary for communication. However, a definition does \nnot equal scientific fact. The problem I have is that you don't have any \nevidence that an animal from one species can slowly become a animal from \nanother. Finches are still finches, fish are still fish, roses are still \nroses. Bacteria divides every few hours, but they remain bacteria even \nafter google divisions. Changes, like antibiotic resistance, are due to \nloss of genetic coding for a specific enzyme. We also see changes in \nspecies as a result of inbreeding, or subspeciation through a process \ncalled adaptation. However, the offspring has only a subset of the parent \ncoding, they are now less adaptable to new changes. They can never regain \nthe information without breeding back to the parent line. Any farmer can \ntell you that.  However, when you breed across species, for example a horse \nand a donkey the offspring is sterile...no more babies, no chance for \nevolution. Mutation is a result of damage to DNA or error in the complex \ndivision process, depending on which codon was damaged, the result can be \nmild or devastating. Yes, the mutation that causes sickle cell anemia may \nmake a person 'resistant' to malaria, but they are still sick individuals, \nwith compromised blood cells. Evolution can not explain the gain of \nspecific complex information and life, any more than shaking a bag of \nletters together can explain a blue print for a submarine.",

It's bad and I think everyone with a common sense know \nthat war would destroy both sides in war. I don't care if you're more alive \nor something, but I think people have something called \"self-control, \nself-restriction\" from doing any bad deeds. It's something that differs us \nfrom other animal. Of course, you should be ashamed of letting your \nprimitive instinct of going to war without holding it back. I mean, look, \nif for instance, the US would press their need to be in war with other \ncountries and use their money for other stuff like education, healthcare, \nand better public infrastructure, those would be greater. However, they \njust like to be a 'world police' when they themselves had tons of unsolved \nproblem and facing an endless crisis. Why would they bother and try to get \ninvolved in other countries business? No other countries want to fall under \nUS pressure to do something. ",

This is important but a \nCULT isn't defined by number of followers. A sect is a religious group wich \nagrees with another in some respects( for my example that Jesus was Holy \nand son God) but disagrees on other aspects ( the worship\\reverence due to \nSaints in Catholic Christianity and Protestant Christianity) . There are \nCristhian Sects, Islamic Sects, Bhuddhist Sects and Jewish Sects.\n\nA cult is smaller, closely knit and worships something, usually an object \nor a person but it can be an Ideal. The object of worship demands obedience \nand rigid observance of ritual. It also doesn't need to be religious, for \nexample the sovietic cult of personality of Josef Stalin.\n\nScientology is a religious Cult because it takes what Hubbard told as \nabsolute and final religious truth. It doesn't agree in any religious \ndogma, to my knowledge, with any other 'religion' . It also shuns and ruins \nthe life of apostates (people who get away and speak against Scientology). \nIt is also secretive about its inner works and Dogmas. I can think of only \none Christian Religious Cult, the mormons, who treat Joseph Smith as a \nProphet of the same apparent stature of Jesus.\nI hope my answer is clear and useful to you. :-)",

                    "text": "+baby zai \"Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that all the \ninnumerable forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are \nsubject to a fundamental law \u2013 one may call it an iron law of Nature \u2013 \nwhich compels the various species to keep within the definite limits of \ntheir own life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind. Each \nanimal mates only with one of its own species. The titmouse cohabits only \nwith the titmouse, the finch with the finch, the stork with the stork, the \nfield-mouse with the field-mouse, the house-mouse with the house-mouse, the \nwolf with the she-wolf, etc.\n\nDeviations from this law take place only in exceptional circumstances. This \nhappens especially under the compulsion of captivity, or when some other \nobstacle makes procreative intercourse impossible between individuals of \nthe same species. But then Nature abhors such intercourse with all her \nmight; and her protest is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the \nhybrid is either sterile or the fecundity of its descendants is limited. In \nmost cases hybrids and their progeny are denied the ordinary powers of \nresistance to disease or the natural means of defence against outer attack.\n\nSuch a dispensation of Nature is quite logical. Every crossing between two \nbreeds which are not quite equal results in a product which holds an \nintermediate place between the levels of the two parents. This means that \nthe offspring will indeed be superior to the parent which stands in the \nbiologically lower order of being, but not so high as the higher parent. \nFor this reason it must eventually succumb in any struggle against the \nhigher species. Such mating contradicts the will of Nature towards the \nselective improvements of life in general. The favourable preliminary to \nthis improvement is not to mate individuals of higher and lower orders of \nbeing but rather to allow the complete triumph of the higher order. The \nstronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify \nthe sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the born weakling can look \nupon this principle as cruel, and if he does so it is merely because he is \nof a feebler nature and narrower mind; for if such a law did not direct the \nprocess of evolution then the higher development of organic life would not \nbe conceivable at all.\n\nThis urge for the maintenance of the unmixed breed, which is a phenomenon \nthat prevails throughout the whole of the natural world, results not only \nin the sharply defined outward distinction between one species and another \nbut also in the internal similarity of characteristic qualities which are \npeculiar to each breed or species. The fox remains always a fox, the goose \nremains a goose, and the tiger will retain the character of a tiger. The \nonly difference that can exist within the species must be in the various \ndegrees of structural strength and active power, in the intelligence, \nefficiency, endurance, etc., with which the individual specimens are \nendowed. It would be impossible to find a fox which has a kindly and \nprotective disposition towards geese, just as no cat exists which has a \nfriendly disposition towards mice.\" - Chapter XI Volume one of Mein Kampf. \n\nhere Hitler rejects Darwinism, claiming that there is only micro evolution \n(something creationists often do)",

On the outcome \nside, we have coodinated emotions, a common sense of morality, and last but \nnot least symbols (like banners). So, is warfare itself a ritual? Or is it \njust, like all social activities, peppered with rituals?\n\nBy the way, on a global scale, earthlings slaughtering each other doesn't \nreally make sense.

The Second Gulf War was fought to \nprotect the petrodollar. In the year 2000, Saddam Hussein announced that \nIraq would be transitioning from the dollar to the euro in the \ninternational oil trade. By 2002, he fully converted Iraq to the petroeuro. \nThe war also gave multinational corporations direct access to Iraq's oil. \nThere was also a personal vendetta involved, but that was secondary.\n\nThe current conflict with the \"Islamic State\" is about protecting the \nUnited States' geopolitical interests in the Persian Gulf, specifically the \noil trade.",
