                    "text": "+teacherspet79 Kittens are supposed to be weaned between 6 and 8 weeks. (8 \nis optimum from my experience). Giving a cat or kitten KMR (kitten milk \nreplacer) after that time can actually be harmful to their digestive track. \nAlso, @ Elaine Swanson :  Absolutely do NOT feed your cats anything dairy. \nThis means no cheese, no cream, no milk, etc. Dairy is actually toxic to \ncats. A minor effect is runny feces, which seems harmless if you don't know \nwhat's going on. Diarrhea in any animal is usually a sign that their body \ncannot handle or process whatever caused the problem. Dairy can actually \nbreak down the digestive track slowly over time, causing more serious \nhealth risks further down the road.  Keep in mind that something not \nkilling or making your cat seriously ill is not the same thing as that item \nbeing ok for your cat's health long-term. As for other \"people food,\" I \nwould suggest avoiding anything with preservatives, spices, artificial \ncolors/flavors, and so on. Stick with clean proteins in the form of \nplain-cooked meats/fish. Some fruits and vegetables might be ok, but cats \ndo not need these things in their diets. If you are ever unsure, there are \na lot of resources online about what is and what is not safe for \nconsumption by cats.",

My question has to do with what to \nfeed my cat: you recommend a raw diet, but what about taurine? My Trina \nthrows up commercial foods, so I feed her baby food--chicken variety, but a \nwhole jar (which she gets in the day) is only 80 calories, and she's very \npetite at 8.5 pounds. I would give her a raw diet if I could rest assured \nthat she is getting all the nutrients she needs, but is there any \ntrustworthy direction on raw diets?\ufeff",

She usually settles down when she considers the alternative, but she \nsure would love to roam outside.  I agreed when I adopted her I would not \nlet her outside or declaw her (as if I ever would do that!).  Trina was \nturned in twice in quick succession by owners who decided they did not want \nher, and she is slowly developing trust that this is her forever home and \nshe is loved, but she doesn't want to be handled--no way is she a lap cat.  \nShe talks to me all day long but she doesn't want to be stroked. She'll sit \nnear me no matter where I am but just don't put your hands on me! I'm just \nconcerned because she only weighs 8.5 pounds and I can feel her hips when I \ndo stroke her--I think she's too skinny, so the right food is imperative! \nShe's picky about what she will eat.  I tried chicken livers but she threw \nthem up and I was counseled by a raw meat provider that organ meats were a \nlittle challenging right now.  I've been giving her kosher ground chicken \nwith her baby food, but she really wants the roast chicken I eat so I share \nit with her (no spices, just plain meat). This little girl doesn't seem to \nwant raw food.",

I would \ntry chicken livers specifically because they're easy to find at the grocery \nand lots of cats love them! Is your cat indoor only?\nAlso I know it is probably not appealing, but feeder mice would work well \nif you're desperate. Many cats find food much more appealing live and you \ncan rest assured they will have a full diet.\nGood luck!",

I was very surprised when \nmy vet told me to limit my girl to 1/2 cup of kibble a day (granted this \nwas a high-protein high-fat kibble). The instructions on the bag \nrecommended feeding much more. You should also feed her a grain-free brand \nthat is very low in carbohydrates (there is a brand comparison chart of \ncarbs levels floating around the internet so search for it). Once you know \nhow much to feed, measure the food you put in her dish for free feeding. \nThis will allow you to see how much she is eating. You also should weigh \nhim so you can to monitor any weight loss or gain. Like you I tried to put \nmy kibble eater on meal times. I put down a third of her daily allowance \nand let her eat that as she wanted but she wasn't allowed to eat any more \nuntil the next meal time. She could eat less than what I put out but not \nmore. This imposed some scheduling to her meal times. The next step was \ngoing to be to take away what was left of the second meal after one hour. \nAfter a trial of this I was going to remove what was left of another meal \nafter an hour and so on. But then she got sick, her mouth became sore and \nshe switched over to canned food for me. Hope things work out for you!",
