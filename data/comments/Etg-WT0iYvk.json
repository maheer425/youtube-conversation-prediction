There are a couple ways \nto modify the genetics of a plant, one is to use an agrobacterium to insert \ngenes into a plant flower that is passed onto its seeds, another is to \nshoot a gene gun (much lower yield and not that regulated) where you shoot \nnanoparticles of the genetics at the cell's nucleus and just hope you get \nit.\n\nDo any of you believe in intelligent design as how humans got here?",
