                "text": "*Squaring the circle*\n\nOne of the ancient problems proposed by ancient geometers.\nThe challenge is to construct a square with the same area as a given circle \nusing a compass and a straightedge with a finite number of steps.\n\nIn 1882, it was proven that this challenge can't be done, it is impossible, \nin fact, this is why we use the expression \"squaring the circle\" to express \nthe impossibility.\n\nThe proof consist of the magic of Pi that it turned out to be a \ntranscendental number.\n\nthanks to +Jon Percepto \nvia +Numberphile \n\n#mathematics   #Pi\ufeff",

Now we draw a semicircle so that AC is a diameter of this circle, \nand draw a line from B perpendicular to AC so that it touches the \nsemicircle at point D. This is the drawing he made in the video, with the \npoints labelled.\nThe important fact here is that the angle ADC is a right angle. This tells \nus that the angles BCD and BDA are the same, and that the angles CDB and \nDAB are the same, so the triangles ABD and DBC are similar.\nSo the ratio of the length of AB to the length of BD must be the same as \nthe ratio of the length of BD to the length of BC, by similarity. I.e.\n|AB|/|BD| = |BD|/|BC|\nor, multiplying both sides by |BD|*|BC|,\n|AB|*|BC| = |BD|^2\nNow |AB| = a, and |BC| = 1, so |BD|^2 = a and hence |BD| has length sqrt(a)",

But in \nfact I am pretty sure that greeks had strings and were able to use them \n(How else should they be able to draw a circle if not by using a string \nwith a piece of chalk at one and a pointy stick at the other one). I \nthought about the same idea as well, except that when you start drawing the \ncircle you measure the beginning. Use the ruler to draw the radius from \nthat point to the middle (marked by pointy stick). Use the ruler again to \ndraw the diameter. Cut the string in such away that each end of the string \n(which is lying on the circumfrence) touches the points where the diameter \ncrosses the circle: string of length pi (times radius but thats \nirrelevant). Now simply get the square root of the length of the string as \nexplained in the video. Measure it with a string. Use a thales-circle for \n90\u00b0 and use the sting for the second side. Add the other 2 sides either by \nconnecting, measuring parallel lines or thales-circle. And ta-da your \nsquare has the same area as the circle you began with.\nEven if it is not included in the rules, in can easily done using \n\"technology\" the greeks had (no computer, calculator or whatever needed). \nSo if the greek really didnt manage to get a square and circle of the same \narea, they were stupid.",
