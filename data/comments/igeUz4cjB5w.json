Like jelly, for example, do you eat it on crackers, plain \nbread, toast? Are their any typical recipes that actually uses Vegemite as \na seasoning or part of the dish? Like for example there is a West African \ndish that you use peanut butter as the main ingredient of the sauce, its \npretty good, although I don't eat peanut butter in bread or fruits, I do \nlike that dish. So for the Australians, how do you like your Vegemite?",

For reference, Vegemite should be \nfirst tried on toast with butter/margarine and spread so thin that it looks \nalmost patchy and looks less black, more brown in colour. Also putting \nVegemite with cheese will help calm the intensity of it. But if you're a \npro like me you can spread it thick like peanut butter or eat it straight \nfrom the spoon. ;)",

I don't remember the exact statistic but something like 50% of \ntheir economic income is from criminal activities. Russia is still a big \npower in the world to be absolutely certain and it does have some serious \nnuclear capabilities but aside from all that, it's just a big hunk of land \nmost of which they can't even use. They're infamous for not thinking \nthrough any of their actions such as in WW1 where they jumped into a war \nwith so few guns that they had to go out in pairs so that once one of them \ndied, the other one could run out and remove the gun from their partners \ncold dead body and keep fighting. In general, whatever they do tends to \nfail pretty horribly at any long term projects they attempt which \ndefinitely makes them seem less like a world power. Still though, I know \nthe UK is still a powerful country in the world but it's mostly lost its \nonce expansive empire and been reduced back down to the island it always \nhas been. Now to be certain, they're still a world power but they aren't \nvery scary compared to most world powers today. Either way though it \ndoesn't really matter anyway so I see no need to push the point.\n\nAnd back to your other comment, yes there would be a US of some sort or \nanother without the UK as it's not like the rest of the world wasn't \nalready planning on settling the area. Americans were absolutely infamous \nfor loving the freedom provided in a still new and fresh unconquered world \nduring colonial times no matter where they came from and if it had come \ndown to it, I would bet you that regardless of who was in charge on the \neast coast, and whoever was settling america, we probably would have \nrebelled against them eventually anyway just because we didn't like be held \ndown by the same powers that we tried so hard to escape from by coming all \nthe way over here in the first place. ANYWAY you get the point. It probably \nwouldn't have happened the same without Britain however it probably still \nwould've happened.\n\nMy other comment was an ironic joke because I was trying to make a point \nthat I'm sure we all think our nation is the best (unless your from some \nbackwater african country or something) so there's really no point in \ntrying to say yours is better because everyone already seems to think that \nanyway.",
