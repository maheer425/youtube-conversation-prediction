And also fact that Russia was \npart of Allies. And even if WW2 wouldn't happen, there would be another \nwar, because 72 million people that died in WW2 would mean bigger request \nfor living environment. And sooner or later, there will be another war, \nbecause people are just stupid animals. Like two dogs fighting over piece \nof meat.

Vader starts \nstrong but tends to lose intensity and flow with things like \"suck these \nrobot balls\" and \"these what sir, these robot nuts\".\n\nAlthough the best rhyme in the first battle was vaders \"who even knows if I \nam your father\", he is more inconsistent and his rhymes tend to not hit as \nhard. Lines like \"I'm the original dark lord\" or \"my stormtroopers make \nyours look like someone took a piece of shit and cloned it\" fall flat \nbecause Darth Vader isn't the original dark lord, and his stormtroopers are \nregarded as a joke. \nLines like \"you need a vacation, come step in my shower\" hit hard however \nbecause how freaking dark they are, and lines like \"what's wrong ani? Can't \ntake anymore? nor suprising coming from the emperors whore\" are accurate \nand hilarious.\n\nThen there are other factors.\nVader has to resort to violence in all his battles, this is basically \nadmitting you couldn't win the battle of wits. It's a pathetic last resort.\nVader calls in help from people like stormtroopers, while Hitler fights \nalone.\nHitler was frozen in carbonite the second battle and Vader had all the time \nto prepare and choose a time to attack, and still Hitler was immediatly on \nthe offensive, Hitler is more on the offensive in almost all battles even \nthough everything is working against him.\n\nTo me, Vader seemed beaten beyond a comback when Hitler finishes so strong \nduring battle 2.",
