But this \nis nothing new, since most of the supercar manufacturers send a support \nteam with the car to top gear (McLaren and Lamborghini being the latest, \nwith the P1 and Veveno roadster) \nyeah, there was supposed to be a 1 in front of that 2 to make it the \ncorrect 12 minutes, but my 1 key sticks and i type fast (i blame brazzers \nfor that sticky key). lol\nthe VR part of the what im going to call from now on VRW16, refers to the \nangle of the cylinders. most variants of the VR have a very narrow (between \n10 to 15 degress) angle, and uses one cylinder head for both sets. it's \neasy to see why bugatti went with this engine design, 1, because it's a \nproprietary owned by VW, and 2, its very space saving, which allowed them \nto mount the engine(s) side by side, which opened the door for the VRW16. \notherwise i have no trouble believing the veyron would have been 10 ft wide \nin the back if it had used a standard angled V8s to make the W16. and \nthough its called a \"double-u sixteen\" it's actually closer to a \\X/16 in \ncylinder shape, with a crossover between the two cam sets; which leaves you \nwith 2 headers, each providing for one set of cylinders on each engine. and \nyes, they said that theoretically it can produce 2000 hp, but the car would \nbe mainly engine and radiators, and very little car, so they \"spread the \nload over 16 cylinders, which increases reliability\".",

Where did you hear \nthat Bugatti could have tuned the veyron up to 2000hp? That doesn't sound \nright considering the supersports were 200 added horsepower and it seems \nlike extra things had to be done to achieve that. All I'm saying is \nBuggatti needed 16 cylinders to produce that power and koenigsegg only \nneeded half of that and half the turbos and a lot less other shit. You \ndon't think the agera's motor could be tuned up too? They didn't for the \nsame reason as bugatti. Also it's not like both cars are running near top \nspeeds at all times so wear is different at lower speeds like you said. \nThe koenigsegg is a much more significant car to automotive technology and \nfuture tech than the Veyron which is over the top in every way.
