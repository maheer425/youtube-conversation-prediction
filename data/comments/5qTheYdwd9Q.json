A change in the nucleotide sequence of a \ngenome of an organism. As far as the RNA is concerned, mutated DNA is in \nfact new information which will \"code\" for new or changed proteins. \n\n\"Remember the fruit fly experiment? They tried to mutate it and get it to \nevolve, it sure did mutate but guess what my comic book friends!!! It \nremained a fruit fly.\"\n\nDid my previous comment just go straight over your head? I'll quote it: \n\"Evolution is gradual. I don't know why this is such a hard concept to \ngrasp. It takes many, many generations for substantial changes to occur.\" \nOne single mutation is not going to make an organism into a different \nspecies. Thousands upon thousands of mutations from parent to offspring \nover many generations *will* do that. \n\n\"Natural selection doesn't create anything it selects, that's it.\"\n\nWhy are you using this as a counter-argument? It's exactly correct. Natural \nselection is the process by which \"heritable biological traits become \neither more or less common in a population as a function of the effect of \ninherited traits on the differential reproductive success of organisms \ninteracting with their environment\". Basically, it's the genetic version of \nprocess of elimination. Traits that are detrimental will become less \ncommon, because those organisms will have a disadvantage, die off, and not \nbe able to pass on those traits. Traits that are beneficial will become \n*more* common, because those organisms will have an advantage over the rest \nand will have more chance of passing those traits on, because they survived.\n\n\"Reproduction? Really?\" \n\nYes, really. How are heritable traits supposed to be passed on to offspring \nif organisms don't reproduce? \n\n\"So how did the natural selection know it needed male and female to \nsurvive? It's a blind process but how that happened?\"\n\nNatural selection needs reproduction to continue to work, because by \ndefinition that's how it works.",

It is always \nthe idea that evolution is instantaneous with you people. You don't seem to \nunderstand that this takes place over MILLIONS of years only after \nsuccessful generation after successful generation breeds, implying the \ninherent need for a particular trait to survive.\n\nFor instance, if your dog on its own discovered that it could live easily \noff the plants in its habitat; (unfortunately this removes you from the \nequation because external influence can really muck it all up) that dog, in \ntheory could mate to produce offspring that were to be taught to eat \nplants, like their parents. If this continues for hundreds of generations, \ndue to their being a concrete reason why being carnivorous is not \nbeneficial to the species you now have a situation where the dogs with the \ntrait that determined that they were better off being carnivores have died \noff (say due to a lack of prey). Once the carnivorous dogs have finally \ndied of, this new plant-eating breed will continue to prosper and produce \nyouth that are herbivores and thus over time those dogs would develop blunt \nteeth and different digestive make ups.\n\nBasically a species evolves when a trait that is BENEFICIAL is discovered \nby a member of the species that allows that species to thrive and \nreproduce. That member is more likely to reproduce and its genes are passed \non ensuring that the offspring will follow suit until this goes on for \nhundreds of generations and it slowly becomes a trait that all of the \nspecies is born with.",
