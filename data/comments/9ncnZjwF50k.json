But Lizzie and Darcy met much more recently, and their \nrelationship has been full of awkwardness and some conflict. They're \nsupposed to be uncomfortable around each other for a while -- the story \nwouldn't work if they weren't. I think Lizzie and Darcy showed a lot more \nchemistry in the last couple of videos at Pemberley Digital and in the \nbonus videos. They do click really well, it just took longer and was harder \nfor them to realize it than for Alex and Emma. Sorry for the essay there \nlol ",
