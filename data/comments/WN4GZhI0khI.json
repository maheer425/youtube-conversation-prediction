In other countries, most slaves \nwere war prisoners, and when you had a child, the child was not born a \nslave.

Of course there's that whole thing of a slave owner being able to \nrape, torture and mutilate you freely and legally. Slaves had no right, \nwere sold as mere objects (some were even kidnapped and beaten into \nsubmission in order to be slaves) and treated as such. You weren't allowed \nto vote, learn or keep your own children if your owner didn't want them, \nyou had to work ungodly hours without complaint lest you get a whipping, \nyou couldn't say no, you couldn't demand any changes to workplace health \nand safety, if you died during the job, well too damned bad etc.\nWhereas nowadays you can take your employer to task if they even speak to \nyou inappropriately (even if it's not inappropriate and you just happen to \ntake it as such.) You can even quit, or demand more rights, negotiate \ncontracts, speak out against perceived injustices (without you know being \nHANGED for it) or even just go get a better education and get a job you \nlike better. The workforce before the Unions/strikes are FAR more like \nslavery than today's system. And even then removed somewhat because you \nknow, available education to lead a better life  (if not for the worker, \nthen at least for their kids.)\nSlavery was horrid and inhumane to the extreme that is why it's illegal. To \neven suggest that you're a slave because you CHOOSE  to go into a job in \nexchange for monetary compensation to live in our economy out of necessity \n(unless you're Amish, I suppose) is an insult to those who lived through \nsuch horrendous acts.

And no you mean the Catholic \nChurch not Christian Church. Personally the Catholic Church in my opinion \nwas hijacked by the devil long ago. Not saying all of it is bad though. \nFurthermore, people who believed the earth was flat, feared that they would \ngo off the edge of the earth. They only believed they lived on one side. \nBut the bible doesn't say that you will fall off the earth or anything like \nthat if you go to far. In fact, in Job 26:10 it says, \"He has inscribed a \ncircle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness\". \nSee how it says that there is a boundary between light and dark. Well that \nmeans you can cross over to the dark and not go off the edge of the planet. \nYou can go anywhere on the planet whether it is dark or not and it would be \na smooth crossover, not at risk of flying off the edge. And if the earth \nwas flat like these people believed, then these people would only ever be \nliving on one side of the planet because if they tried to cross to over to \nthe other side like you suggest then they would fall off. If the earth was \nflat, what if they dug down? Are you saying there is a bible verse saying \nyou would fall through the earth and in to space or something crazy? The \nanswer is no. Furthermore, the Hebrew word describing the earth is \ninterchangeable with spherical, round, circular, circle, etc.",

If it now moves in a \ncircel around the Table it will be 50 % above the Table and 50 % below \ngiving it a light and Dark Cycle. But that wouldnt make sense since the \nEarth moves around the sun i hear you thinking. Yeah until  ca. 1900 the \nChristian Church did not believe in a Heliocentric Galaxy but in a \nGeocentric Universe.

                    "text": "+Coyote W I'm a Christian, and I agree with your statement. Why can't \neveryone just get along, and let cartoons be, oh, I don't know... cartoons?\n\nThe main point of a cartoon is to NOT be taken seriously most of the time. \nThat's why the cartoons are mostly just there for enjoyment. Yes, some \naren't meant to be that way, but I doubt if the Pope Show would've been \nmade to be taken seriously, anyways.\n\nI guess the major lesson in this is simple... people are just natural, \nwar-hungry, blood-thirsty creatures who crave power over others, and will \ndo whatever it takes to put down anything that they deem a threat, and feed \noff of the torment of other people, regardless of who they are.\n\nYes, this is off-topic, but this is kinda like the war between the Bronies, \nNon-Bronies, and Anti-Bronies. We have the guys who like a show originally \nintended for little girls, we have the guys who don't want to watch the \nshow/don't like the show, but don't see anything wrong with people who DO \nlike it, and then we have the guys who hate the show, and the people who \nlike the show, just because they think it's wrong, and that those who DO \nlike it should be ashamed.\n\nWhen put on the spotlight, the Anti-Bronies never truly have a good reason \nwhy they even CARE about Bronies liking the show, because naturally, we're \nall hypocrites by nature.\n\nProof? A little girl watches football, or some other famous sport, and \npeople get a good laugh out of it, because they think it's cute... but oh, \nwhen a man watches My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, EVERYONE loses \ntheir shit!\n\nYes, it may seem odd that a guy likes a show for little girls... but no, it \nisn't odd for a little girl to like a show for guys. It's just... \"cute\".\n\nBack on subject, now. There's lots of controversies that were also skipped \nas well. Like \"The Powerpuff Girls\", for example! If not for the innuendos \nof \"Little Girls Beating Big Bad Guys\", then there's that one line when \nthey met that girl, Lauren.\n\nBubbles: \"This is Professor Utonium. He made us by accident inside his lab!\"\nUtonium: \"Well, I don't know what to say.\"\nLauren: \"That's okay, Professor. I was an accident, too!\"\nUtonium: O_O'\n\nYeah... good times. Still, though, there's the few people out there like us \nwho don't really want anything to DO with the Cartoon War. The bottom line \nis that, unfortunately, the world is run by corruption. Eventually, we \nwon't even be able to speak freely, without some \"superior\" interfering, \nand talking down to us, just because what we believe are different from \nwhat THEY believe.\n\nMy suggestion? Just enjoy what you've currently got, and be on guard for \nany haters out there. They're always out there... watching... waiting to \nstrike... then shouting out random hateful comments just to get a rise out \nof those of us who actually DO think with our minds, rather than our asses.",

But if you do not forgive men their \nsins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\nLeviticus 19:18: You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the \nsons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n1John 3:15: Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that \nno murderer has eternal life abiding in him.\n\nWhy can't you forgive people for doing the same thing you do?

August 6, 1945\n\nTO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE:\nAmerica asks that you take immediate heed of what we say on this leaflet.\n\nWe are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man. \nA single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent \nin explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s can carry on a single \nmission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure \nyou it is grimly accurate.\n\nWe have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still \nhave any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one \natomic bomb fell on that city.\n\nBefore using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which \nthey are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition the \nEmperor to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen \nconsequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these \nconsequences and begin the work of building a new, better and peace-loving \nJapan.\n\nYou should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall \nresolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly \nand forcefully end the war.\n\nEVACUATE YOUR CITIES.\n\nATTENTION JAPANESE PEOPLE. EVACUATE YOUR CITIES.\nBecause your military leaders have rejected the thirteen part surrender \ndeclaration, two momentous events have occurred in the last few days.\n\nThe Soviet Union, because of this rejection on the part of the military has \nnotified your Ambassador Sato that it has declared war on your nation. \nThus, all powerful countries of the world are now at war with you.\n\nAlso, because of your leaders' refusal to accept the surrender declaration \nthat would enable Japan to honorably end this useless war, we have employed \nour atomic bomb.\n\nA single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent \nin explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s could have carried on a \nsingle mission. Radio Tokyo has told you that with the first use of this \nweapon of total destruction, Hiroshima was virtually destroyed.\n\nBefore we use this bomb again and again to destroy every resource of the \nmilitary by which they are prolonging this useless war, petition the \nemperor now to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen \nconsequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these \nconsequences and begin the work of building a new, better, and peace-loving \nJapan.\n\nAct at once or we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other \nsuperior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war.\n\nEVACUATE YOUR CITIES.\n\nSource: Harry S. Truman Library, Miscellaneous historical document file, \nno. 258.\n\n\nThe war was nowhere near over before that.",

You \ndidn't even hit a military target, you dropped nukes in the middle of \ncities where the amount of innocent civilians was nearly 4 to 5 times \ngreater than the amount of soldiers, the soldiers weren't in the city yet \nwhen the bomb was dropped, many were still stationed outside of Japan, the \nnukes caused more Japanese casualties than American casualties by the end \nof the war.

Well, when Squidward first breaks into the \nKrusty Krab at night, he opens the door and a bucket of liquid gets dumped \nall over him. He laughs at the poor security system, claiming it's just a \nbucket of water, but soon after a few sniffs he realizes it's gasoline. A \nrobotic arm then extends and drops a match, and I believe the whole place \nblew up. I think this gag happened once more when he entered another room. \nAnyways, I remember watching that episode, but those scenes were pulled \nbecause a child imitated the acts and (I'm not sure, but I believe) he set \nhimself on fire and may have died.\ufeff",
