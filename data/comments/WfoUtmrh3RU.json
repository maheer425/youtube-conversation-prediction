Exactly how peaceful is this \nprotest? Also, a lot of the times .... We only see how the police are using \nexcessive force towards protesters etc... Have you seen the side where \nhundreds and hundred of protesters are pushing their way towards a small \ngroup of maybe 10 police? \nA lot of protesters know that of the police say anything back to their \ninsults etc they can complain about them and even get them sacked... So \nthey give tem insults such as \"the black cops\", \"traitors\", \"Dogs of the \nChinese\" ..... Even insulting their families and professions! And that's ok \napparently?! But as soon as the police use what I personally think is \ndefinitely NECESSARY force... They kick shit up! So that's the democracy \nthey are fighting for! Slowly ruining Hong Kong's economy, other citizens \neveryday life .... Stopping the most innocent ones from attending school \nand affecting their education is all ok? I personally think that both Hong \nKong and honest government are very patient and have a very high tolerance! \nThough I will add.... Hong Kong government needs to have a more decisive \nand effective response.... As we are still not seeing a lot results from \ntheir solutions still. \n\n\ufeff",

The government itself is \nhighly influenced by corporatism and lobbyism, especially so due to the \nfact that the government owes their souls to the federal reserve, who have \nthe exclusive rights to print money, loaning it to the government for \ninterest(aka the government has to repay MORE money than was printed in the \nfirst place), meaning that the federal reserve has immense economic \ndominance over the government. Not to speak of the massive amounts of \nlobbyism(basically corruption) going on to change the laws to fit the \ndesires of the big companies. Even the distribution of newly printed money \nis designed so the top banks and companies get their hands on it first, \nthen sprinkle what they care for further down, meaning that the \"inflation\" \ncauses the prices to rise unproportionally to the amount of new money that \nactually reaches the public. Prices rise, salaries don't, and the rich get \nricher from two different sides at once.\n\nYou don't have a democracy, you have a semi-democratic corporatism. It's \njust subtler in America than in Hong Kong, and you have rights that can't \nbe directly broken(not that they can't be bypassed, like with the three \nstrike system designed for private prisons to get more inmates, so they \nhave a larger free workforce and get more money from the government. \nStealing three loafs of bread for your family can get you life in prison. \nThey have lobbied a way to pull poor and desperate minorities into a \ntechnically-not-slavery. Disgusting).\n\nThere's no way to have a completely free market without somebody winning \nthe competition. And there's no way an uneven distribution of money in a \nfree market does not lead to an uneven distribution of power.\nNot to say the government doesn't have their own exclusive rights, and they \ncan act against the will of the big corporations if they have to, but they \ncan't expect to get a campaign or support next time if they don't please \ntheir investors.

And we are doing very well over \nhere ;-) It is not that simple to blame the designe of a system. Yes, the \nsystem of the weimar republic (official name of germany back then) had some \nprety severe designe flaws, but it was also the people living in the system \nand economical circumstances that provoked the events that have followed.\n\nI am not exactly an expert on this but here are my thoughts about it: A \nstable system always develops out of its people. Like it has here in \nswitzlerand, or england, or the US etc. If you just throw a completly new \nsystem at a society it wont end well. Thats why bringing democracy to \nforeign countries does, and will never work. Democracy is about the people \nin the system. It depends more or less on the fact of people participating \nin the democratic process. If a society is not accostumed to that and has \nnot developed it's very own flavoure of democracy it will go teribbly \nwrong. I think thats the reason why the system in weimar republic failed \nand why system in various other countries that were \"liberated\" or \n\"domocratised\" in the past 20 years failed or are failing.",

                "text": "Honestly, I feel as though its not that big of a deal. The West always \nidealises democracy as a requirement for a government to be considered \nlegitimate, but in many countries (especially in Asia and Africa), they \nsimply aren't culturally ready to be a democracy. A successful country \nunder a democracy requires its citizens to make the right decisions. In a \ndeveloping country (such as China), political stability is needed in order \nfor further economical development. Bringing democracy into the country too \nsuddenly will only cause political chaos and cause the country's economy to \ncrumble. Right now, yes, the Chinese government wants to hold on to it's \npower, but it does so in order to maintain stability. Hong Kong's current \ncalls for democracy is a threat to the stability Beijing has been trying to \nmaintain, because of all the other Chinese territories that want freedom as \nwell. But, I don't think Hong Kong has much to worry about, because I \nbelieve that China won't do too much meddling in Hong Kong--they want Hong \nKong to exist the way it is, because they do want its economic prosperity \nto continue. \n\nWell, this is just my opinion anyway. Feel free to totally disagree with \nme. I guess I am a little biased since I've been living in China for the \npast 8 years, but I do hail from another small, cleanliness-obsessed \nrepublic--Singapore :)\ufeff",

                "text": "Thank you Hank, for this video. You have no idea how thankful I am for it: \nI live in Hong Kong, I turned 18 yesterday - October 3rd, the day in which \nanti-Occupants (background: the protest is generally called Occupy Central; \nsome people refer to the protestors/people taking part in it as Occupants) \nsuddenly walked into the protest grounds and started messing up Occupant \nsupplies and getting into fights with Occupants.  These anti-Occupants are \nsuspected to be triad members (so like, just bad people) and also suspected \nto have been sent in by the government or something like that. The police, \nmasses of police who stood in formations around the Occupants, did nothing \nto quell the chaos. The government also withdrew their planned negotiation \ntalks with student associations (because a large part of this Occupy \nCentral movement are students, namely in late high school and in \nuniversity).\n\nYou can imagine how distressing it was for me, and for many people, when \nthis happened. Not just distressing because on a personal note, it had \nhappened on my birthday, but distressing because all the Occupants had been \nholding their breath before this happened, maintaining peace and order in \ntheir proceedings, staying within the barricaded zones, clearing out trash \nand passing out food supplies, making sure not to set things on fire or \ndestroy anything. Sure, at the beginning things had gotten out of hand - \nlots of running and pushing and jostling at the police; a couple of the \nstudent leaders got arrested, even (they were released later, but it's very \ncomplicated). But the Occupants (which also grew in number after what \nhappened the first few days) had fought to stay calm and peaceful, and hope \nfor the best. Like you said, Hank, we wanted stability as much as China/the \ngovernment does, it's just we want some form of control over the future and \ndestiny of Hong Kong.\n\n::a brief note - I know about as much as the next person does, from news \nand updates of other people who keep a close eye on situations, so take the \nthings I say with a grain of salt if you wish, but do bear in mind that \nyes, I live in Hong Kong, and everything that has happened has been \nincredibly personal and hard-to-take-in::\n\nI was very upset this morning, I even had to write a poem (an \"open \nletter\") but that just seemed to upset me more. So I ate lunch and watched \nyour video about HK -- and it has calmed me down a lot. You stuck to facts \nand the basic...basic-ness of everything, and a bit of a background check \ntoo on the situation, and boiled everything down. I am very glad for that, \nbecause my Facebook newsfeed has been blowing nothing but hot air \n(understandable hot air!), and all I see on the news are footage of last \nnight, of youths having panic attacks, being beaten bloody -- and get this, \na girl got sexually harassed by these anti-Occupants (cough triad members \ncough?????) and in response they said she should've expected it would \nhappen when she came out to protest. My blood boiled, I was distressed and \nupset.\n\nNow granted, the protests happening in Hong Kong are very small compared to \nwhat has happened in many other countries - it's not even very much close \nto the Tiananmen Square Massacre (or people call \"Incident\"), although as a \nwhole there are some similar comparisons that can be drawn. To which I ask \nthat people don't start a form of debate under my comment - I'm not trying \nto say HK's incidents are THE WORST THINGS IN THE WORLD EVER, that we HAVE \nIT WORST OF ALL, etc etc. It's a very complicated and complex situation \nwhich involves the background and history of the country and city, so it's \nbad in its own way, but it's also not a situation where we should compare a \nprotest/riot/movement/etc from another country/city to this one (Occupy \nCentral, The Umbrella Movement, Class Boycott; there are many names for \nthis mark in our history); I trust the community of Nerdfighteria very \nmuch, however, and I know we all can approach the situation sensibly and \ncomplexly.\n\nHank, You're right, Hong Kongers have never felt connected to being Chinese \nwhile actually being Chinese; I got it lucky, I spent my childhood in \nSingapore, so I have a bit of Singapore to put as my National Identity. But \nmany HKers I know would rather call themselves Hong Kongers than Chinese, \nto which I understand. We dislike Mainland Chinese people, we really do. \nMainlanders come into Hong Kong with little respect for manners and \netiquette, buy masses of Yakult and baby powder and other brands, charge \nthrough our trains and pack the things they bought right there on the floor \nof the train that heads towards the border (I live along that train line; \nit's a sight have seen everyday of my life post-Singapore). I can't go on \ntrains without my blood boiling because of these Mainlanders, and I know \nit's wrong to dislike people like that, and that there ARE reasons why they \ndo these things, but you can sort of get an idea about HK vs Mainlanders.\n\nBut I digress. Thank you for this video -- truly. I have a yellow ribbon \n(it's a symbol of the Occupants!) on my bag, I'm an English major at the \nChinese University of Hong Kong - one of the largest universities in HK and \nits campus had been used as a Class Boycott location for a day - I am a \npart of the generation of people who are fighting for the future of Hong \nKong, and I have been truly, truly distressed and heartbroken by all that \nhas happened.\n\n(Please, fellow viewers and Nerdfighters, if you intend to respond to this \ncomment in any way, let it be a discussion on Hong Kong and Hong Kong \nalone, and let it not be a debate on the rights and wrongs of the \nsituation; just as Hank had simply talked about Hong Kong and the basic \nfacts. The news today has been upsetting enough, and if you asked me about \nwhat I want: all I want is for people out there to be safe. Politics is a \ndouble-edged sword, and I'm not here to talk about that.)\ufeff",

The only way I can defend is saying that \nlocal minimum wage earners are not in a much better environment.\n\nI take the stairs and rarely take the lift.\n\nI don't take free newspapers. Such actions are loathsome IMO. And I've \nnever done this before.  \n\nI've not met any Pakistani or any other minorities in HK. And I am unaware \nof unfair treatment. I do not consider myself to be racist in anyway.\n\nRacism I've never encountered, but if minorities are in dire position, with \nHK people in full knowledge yet in utter apathy and indifference, HK people \nare detestable.\n\nFor I'm not fond of HK people and does not take pride in being one, I have \nno reason to be oblivious of our own fault.

And this is exactly what i \nmean....all you HKers think about is....which method makes more money? \nOKAY! this one is good! its all money money money with you guys. you will \nNEEEEEVERRRR understand why having helpers is soooooo fucked up and wrong. \nIn the west....people like Bill Gates have maids. not average people.\n\nBecause HK people want to show off their little bit of wealth and are lazy, \nthey hire a maid. You people have only recently SEEN a bit of money coming \nin....this is why you behave like this. you think im wrong? I dont care \nwhat you think cuz i have seen the world and your opinion is childish to \nme. I feel like im talking to a kid. You people are just too stubborn to \naccept your faults. If you cant take care of your kid by yourself.....dont \nhave one. simple as that. If you are going to have one.....give the child \neverything including yourself and your time and attention (no this doesnt \nmean spoiling them and turning them into little bastards like your people \noften do). I HATE HK KIDS....they are the worst kids I have seen in the \nworld. and its all the parents fault who are too stupid to know how to \nraise them properly.\n\nRaise your kids like REAL mothers and fathers should, otherwise....like \nmany of your families.....you kids will just leave you once they grow up \nbecause they did not feel enough bonding to even feel like they WANT to \nhelp you (this happens a lot in HK. there have been adverts on TV trying to \nencourage kids to stay in contact with their parents. but its the parents \nto blame). like i said.....you guys are totally backwards in everything you \ndo. It may seem trivial to you about the football thing....but its proof of \nhow backwards your thinking is. So yes, its little things here and there.\n\nI'm not going to reply any more....because once again....you are one of the \nsheep who is too stubborn to realise the rest of the world functions in a \ndifferent way. And yes mate....having political knowledge IS a prerequisite \nbefore you start disrupting the public with bullshit slogans like \n\"democracy\" (which is just an illusion for donkeys like your people to \nbelieve and sell themselves like whores to the west). If you dont know your \ninfo, dont comment because it makes you look stupid and you lose shame and \nrespect. but oh.....HKers dont know what shame is. thats why they refuse to \ntalk some heavy politics and can only shout out stupid immature slogans. \nyou people are years behind my friend.\n\nWestern propaganda and its bullshit misguided a lot of people. and i find \nit so funny that you donkeys havent learnt from these mistakes and after \nOUR failure to implement democracy, due to OUR corrupt politicians and \nsystems, NOW you guys have only just arrived and are being fooled so \neasily. believe what you want. I dont care. its easy to teach open minded \npeople. but your people are the least open minded in the entire universe. \nits like trying to shape a piece of rock. thats how stubborn your people \nare.

Just \nlike what mainland Chinese are doing to the States. Most of those illegal \nimmigrants don't even pay their taxes! The only difference is that US is \nbig, but HK is a tiny, compacted city. Most of the hospitals are crowded, \nif not over-flowing with pregnant mainlanders who are wealthier than the \nlocals, snatching the beds from the locals, forcing most poorer HKers to \ngive birth at home on their own. Mainlanders constantly complain about how \nHKers discriminate and think lowly of them, but honestly, if they would \ntake a look at the impact they are making on HK, maybe they would \nunderstand our frustration.

Of course, I know that SOME (again not all), but most \nlikely that kids might do something like that. In addition, especial in the \nrural areas of China that people tend to pee or poop in public due to the \nlack of regulations nor public restrooms, on the other hand, Urbanized city \nare increasingly more strict on this rule. I understand have your \nperspective, but please do not use your prejudice nor ignorance to \ngeneralize. Generally, west tends to have a negatively selective focus on \nChina.\n\nI definitely understood that mainlanders due have some (irrational) grudges \nagainst people of Hong Kong, especially on the subject of Hong Kongers \nthink they are superior and different from the mainland, etc. I'm not going \nto go deep on this subject of matter. Rule and social norm are an important \nmatter that it is harder for outsider to immediately to adapt to their \nbehavior accordingly to a new environment because it's obviously a \ndifferent. I have observed many (not all) foreigners from different \ncountries coming to LA and do not understand the LA manners, which it can \nbe very frustrating in my opinion. My argument is that I don't think they \ndid it intentionally just to cause a fight because I do know a lot of \nChinese friend from China living in LA, which I believe they are well \nmannered, of course, you can find some Chinese people that are very rude in \nways, which it's not intentional. \n\nMoreover, it's not just the Hong Kongers that's feeling heat; furthermore, \nmany loco cities in China, for example, Beijing and Shanghai (etc...) have \nalso felt the introversion of outsiders (from different cities or different \ncountries) and skysocketing its real estate. There are, of course, good \namount of rich Hong Kongers coming into mainland cities to buy houses to \ncontribute to the rise of real estate too. That's how the market works, and \nyes, it's kind of scary to see a house that cost so much. On the other \nhand, the mainlanders have also contribute to the growth of Hong Kong \nbusinesses by buying and shopping, there are good and bad.\n\nBy saying that \"China's just too well known for heartbreaking scams\" is \njust completely preposterous and prejudice thing to say because no \ncountries in the world have never ever been perfect. Moving on, we have \nobserved China's immense changes over 3 decades, which it can be seen as \nabnormal.

I \nam a Chinese person who grew up in Singapore where we have about an equal \nproportion of different dialect groups (Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka, \nHainanese) so we are quite well exposed to them all, we cannot speak all of \nthem except the one that we are exposed to either at home or through \nfriends, but overall we get a good mix and hear them, just don't \nunderstand, and they are all mutually unintelligible and all also mutually \nunintelligible from Mandarin. You have a Chinese family name and you don't \nknow this? How can it be? Unless you are a fake and using a fake profile. \n\nIn fact the government here launched a campaign to clamp down the Chinese \ndialects in the 1980s and made the school curriculum switched to Mandarin \ninstead and switching all the media on TV and radio from dialects to \nMandarin because the dictator Lee Kuan Yew who won the first election after \nthe Brits left couldn't hack it in Hokkien and almost lost to opponents who \ncould rally the crowds in fluent Hokkien. So he used the excuse that \ndifferent dialect groups all conversing in different languages wasn't good \nfor the economy. It has cost us great cultural heritage loss and also \naffected family bonding because the third generation now (people under 25) \ncan't converse with those above 60, their grandparents. And luckily I can \nconverse in Teochew.\n\nThere is no way a Chinese person would even question that the Chinese \ndialects are mutually unintelligible because even in the ignorant west, \nwhere the only dialect that the dumb pink monsters know (Cantonese) is \nunintelligible with Mandarin. You are a fake. \n\nBy the way to the other ignoramuses, Mandarin is ALSO a dialect. It was \njust chosen by the government in Beijing to be the unifying dialect because \nits the simplest and it's a northern dialect. That's why most Southern \nChinese refuse to use it since its not our culture, its a northern \nlanguage, nothing to do with us, and the Cantonese are especially vocal in \npreserving their local language. After Mandarin was chosen, suddenly the \nrest became \"local languages\" when previously, Mandarin was just one of the \nover 50 local languages of that vast country. It is a vast vast vast \ncountry, big land (the size of US only if INCLUDING Alaska), big population \n(1.3 billion), longest civilization, 7 big cuisines all different, over 50 \nlanguages, 34 ethnic minorities, a contingent of 50 million Overseas Born \nethnic Chinese in US, Canada, Malaysia, Southeast Asia, established \nmajority Chinese economic powers in Singapore, Taiwan. Dumb ass white \nAmericunts love to think that they are so diverse (thats the biggest reason \nthey give all the time for not being well traveled and not bothering to \never leave the US for vacations or work abroad).

If someone is \nactually writing in the spoken Cantonese style, it's seriously different \nfrom if they were writing in the standardized written form they use on \nother occasions. Lots of words from Cantonese, including core grammar \nfunctions, are completely different than those used in modern Mandarin. \nHave one person write Mandarin and one person write HK Cantonese...the \nMandarin speaker will probably have a difficult time understanding what is \nwritten. It's even more difficult in the spoken way.",

                    "text": "+Amanda L\nYou're definitely spot-on! Although we use 'Chinese' characters in writing, \nhowever, our grammars, words, pronunciations are totally different from one \nanother... some similar cases can also be observed in european languages, \nwhere people from French, Spain, Portugal and Italy could understand at \nleast a bit of one another since many words just look or sound very similar \nin writing and also in speaking. However, they all speak different \nlanguages but of the same origin, so is the case between Cantonese and \nMandarin. So the main reason why Cantonese, my first language, is called a \nChinese dialect is simply that Hong Kong was and is considered part of \nChina... even during the colonial era of the UK. I think if Hong Kong had \nbeen forever ceded to Britain, it would definitely have been be the case \nthat Hong Kong Cantonese would be deemed as a separate language, but of the \nsame origin as Mandarin, or any other 'dialects'. So all in all, the whole \nissue is far too political. :)",

Seriously. Don't. Like, if you \ndo, you're literally making a death wish, or you're making a wish to get \nannoyed out of your mind. Just a friendly piece of advice.\n\nAlso, this kind of doesn't have much to do with this topic, but I've \nnoticed that whilst educated Asians (people with enough money to live in an \napartment, eat go to school etc) know much about American culture, history, \nlife and important figures, I've met plenty of American's who know not a \nsingle thing about us.\n\n\"Confucius is Korean.\" - Someone on the internet\ufeff",
