I mean: I know that YouTube is \nnot really a job. You get money, I think, but not very much at the \nbeginning. *I* think: *if he is able* to do that kind of hobby (just say it \nagain: you get money), he is able to live with that. At first it's too less \nfor an own house or big things like that, but you can buy what you need! \n(f.i. something to eat and that stuff). After a time you may be able to buy \nan own house or something like that. Just want to say: he's 21 or 20, \nalready grown up!\nAgain: I do NOT want to insult you or your \"strategy\" of raise your kids.\nThanks.",

                    "text": "+G00Dlord  Sure. He overreacts. He shouldn't have burned the Christmas \ntree. But let's look at it from his point of view. He asks for only one \nthing. One. He simply wants a WiiU (I believe that's what he said. After \nall, that's what he got). He buys a $100+ grill for his dad (When he points \nthis out to his dad, he says \"I already have a grill!\" That's not \nungrateful?)\nAnd what does he get?\nAntlers.\nCheap ass, low-quality antlers worth $50.\nWhat did his brother get?\n$500 worth of gifts.\nYou'd be pretty upset too if your dad was so ungrateful and got you next to \nnothing.\nLuckily for Jesse, his mom pulled through. Not his dad. His mom.\nWhat else does Jesse do?\nLet's see, he did smash a TV screen... But, wait... No, the dad deserved \nthat... I mean, once you've had everything you owned destroyed then you \nwere told to pay for your friend's GBA which your dad broke simply because \nyou were looking at the screen (There's no evidence he was doing more than \nlooking at the screen), you'll be pissed. Sure, he shouldn't have gone to \nthe dad's level, but the dad still deserved it\nThe chainsaw prank? He was only doing it to get back at his dad for doing \nthe exact same thing. And what does the dad do? He becomes a hypocrite and \nsays normal people don't do that stuff (When he himself did it before \n(Notice that neither the dad nor the brother denied it happened)) and began \nto sledgehammer and chainsaw Jesse's XBOX One.\nThen other time the dad heard Jesse got some money from his mom (Though, \nthe dad forced Jesse to say that. He was giving him no other options. \n\"Birthday and Christmas money don't count\". Yeah right.) and used it to fix \nthe XBOX that his dad destroyed. The dad, after hearing that, threw the \nXBOX into the car Jesse was going to use to get to a job interview and then \nwent on to destroy the car, after Jesse told his dad that was his car to \nget around in so he couldn't get to the interview (Wait. Didn't the dad \nWANT Jesse to get a new job before? You can't win with this guy!)\nThen, to avoid his dad's crazy antics, instead of playing in the house, he \ndecided to secretly play in the garage. Of course, the dad found out and \nthrew the XBOX into the pool... Because... reasons...\nThen the dad shredded Jesse's games with a lawn mower, telling Jesse to get \na job even after Jesse said he already had a job (Yes, livestreaming is a \njob and I'm willing to back this point up if necessary.)\nI won't defend the Thanksgiving thing. Both sides were totally in the wrong \nthere (Though, Jesse did apologize and he admitted he was wrong.)\nAnd finally, the livestream raid. After Jesse was making some side comments \nabout his dad (Which, sure, he shouldn't have been doing and he again \nadmitted he was wrong in the update video), his dad rushed in and destroyed \nthe monitor.\n\n\nHm. In that giant wall of text, I hear more of the dad acting out than \nJesse. (The screaming and yelling don't count, as that's part of the \nduration and the aftermath of the destruction, so it's justifiable. You'd \nbe upset too.)\nSo, even if Jesse IS the cause, the dad is still far more in the wrong than \nJesse.",

That $1000 or so TV, the laptop, the \nXBOX, the camera, and all those games, all that money, shit on and flushed. \nAnd that family is probably doomed, right when the TV was hit. If it was \nall faked, these guys need to go to fucking Hollywood, because if that \nreally is the case, that would be the best acting I've seen in a while. I \nhave no fucking idea why this was shown to millions of people in the first \nplace, but, while there is entertainment in this, we all need to sympathize \nfor these guys. The guy's life is probably destroyed since his games got \nthe mower treatment, and now he is, as far as I know, permanently kicked \nout of the house. The dad must feel bad, looking back since Christmas, \n2012, at what has happened and what millions of people saw. Yes, he \ndisobeyed his father, and was punished. In an extreme way. Ever since, he \nmust not have been the same. He did get revenge, but now this happens. \nThese guys seem to be in real trouble now. We need to sympathize, not keep \nsaying, \"this is all fake, we r smurt! Heheheheheheheheheheeeeeeeeeeeeee\". \nNo. And anyone who thinks my way of thinking is wrong, and wishes to \ndiscredit me, come at me. I accept. I will tear your petty arguments apart. \nSaying this is all fake is likely slowly, but surely, tearing these guys \nfarther and farther apart. Show support, don't be a dick. That is all.\ufeff",

                    "text": "I'm pretty sure this is fake but I will humour you and act as if it is real.\n\nAs someone who grew up with an abusive father (more abusive than this one, \nbut it was a similar principal toward the end) I will tell you straight up \nthat this approach does not work. It actually drives you to be the \nopposite. I wasted several years of my early adult life avoiding getting a \njob at all costs, even when I was homeless. It creates a me vs them \nmentality and the idea of getting a job meant my father had won. It may \nseem silly to you but when you are brought up this way you don't think \nstraight. Your hatred for your abuser overrides all logical thought. The \nonly thing you ever want is to not be like your farther, and more often \nthan not in such cases the father is trying to mould his son in his own \nimage. These sort of fathers are often narcissistic and the problem more \noften than not lies deeper than the actual want for the son to get a job. \nMy father was never happy with me. I could do everything he said and there \nwould just be another issue after that. Not every father is automatically \nright and such an attitude is dangerous.\n\nThis approach will leave your kids severely depressed, full of social \nanxiety and a whole ton of trust issues. Sure they might get a job, but \nthey likely wont live a happy life because you will have fucked them up \nmentally. In the end there are more important things in life than having a \njob. If you put having a job over the mental stability and happiness of \nyour child then you need to re-evaluate your priorities in life. You work \nso you can live a life, you do not live a life just so you can work. This \nmethod of parenting will leave you with an empty shell of a son/daughter, a \ndrone that will eventually have a job but no other redeeming qualities. No \nneed for most of the money they make because nothing makes them happy any \nmore.\n\nIf you want your kid to get a job use positive incentive. \"If you get a job \nyou can buy this and that\" as they get older buy them less things to drive \nthat incentive. This sets up a job as a positive rather than a negative. \nThe chores for an allowance method sets up the idea of a job well. If they \nwant something tell them that they can save up their allowance to buy it. \nThen \"if you get a real job you can earn a lot more money than that and get \nthings much quicker\".\n\nBuilding on the illogic of negative reinforcement is only going to hurt \nyour cause. How do you expect your child to have the confidence to get a \njob, when you spend all your time telling him he is a lazy and good for \nnothing in the most impressionable time of their life? If the person who \npretty much has to love you has no confidence in you, then you likely \naren't going to have confidence in yourself. With me it got to the point \nwhere I was close to having an anxiety attack just from handing a C.V in. \nIn interviews I was a nervous wreck and couldn't sell myself as I had been \ntold for years that I had no redeeming qualities.\n\nI'm all for discipline, but there is a difference between discipline and \nabuse. This is abuse. Discipline is taking his game/console away, abuse is \ndestroying them in a very violent manner to the point were the kid feels \nthreatened for his safety. In the end if the kid is 20+ and is immature \nthen the father's method of parenting obviously hasn't worked has it.\n\nSorry for the essay but wanted to give you the point of view of someone who \nactually went through this.",
