                "text": "This is too difficult a question for me to answer, honestly. I get what \nturns people off about anime, but I think its hypocritical. Because there \nis SO MUCH PDA, there is so much violence and nudity (and it seems that \nJapanese don't curse the same way we do since there are few anime which \nhave a lot of shitbombs and f-bombs unless in English) and there are so \nmany taboos which Hollywood and the current TV industry in America \ncovers...that it doesn't make sense to me how anime isn't becoming more \nwidely known and acknowledged or fanservice/explicit sexual content and \nnudity is still an issue. And its not all men's fetish either, I have \nfriends who are girls who LOVE that stuff and they aren't 100% lesbian \neither. And a lot of people have stopped watching cable and moved over to \nNetflix/Hulu, which now have original programming and HUGE selections of \nanime. But we are a country that elected Bush twice so...\n\nAnd unfortunately, I want to like Toonami, but since I never grew up with \nit and hate a majority of the shows on there now like the Big 3, I know \nthat it's just clouded up with so much damn nostalgia and people who won't \nlet go of their childhood love for shonen even when they're already adults \nwatching it at the most godforsaken hours of the night. None of that stuff \ninterests me. I mean yeah, putting on Black Lagoon, Deadman Wonderland and \nSpace Dandy (well maybe...) were good moves and showing Rebuild of \nEvangelion, Akira and the Trigun movie were also good moves...yet I don't \nknow if I can expect them to put on the new Sailor Moon anime (or even the \nuncut classic which finally got relicensed), Gurren Lagann (even though \nthey've had FLCL on for YEARS and Panty and Stocking/Kill la Kill are \nPERFECT for Adult Swim) and Madoka Magica (it's like Rebuild, FMA:B and \nSailor Moon in a way, seriously think about it). No matter what people in \nthe biz might actually think of them (Sailor Moon, Madoka and TTGL are so \nfucking big with casual anime fans, especially people who live near and \naround Hollywood).\n\nI don't watch mainstream TV anymore, I haven't invested any time in Game of \nThrones or Walking Dead or anything like that. All my dad watches is Castle \nand NCIS. I mean...truly, there are plenty of anime that Americans could \nlike, but this Animation Age Ghetto bullshit is probably the exact same \nreason that the Oscars completely glossed over and didn't even watch Madoka \nMagica Rebellion and the Wind Rises.\n\nNow does that mean I want live action adaptations of all the major shonen? \nNo. But its going to happen no matter what. And if those doing well means \nthat I MIGHT one day see stuff like Pacific Rim which is MUCH more mature \nthan the stuff that comes before it...okay, sure.\n\nHmm...Del Toro is really stepping up to the plate here with a Monster live \naction special for HBO and (lol it won't happen or maybe it will) a live \naction Madoka Magica movie...well not really but...you know how it goes. I \nmight be able to trust directors like him, he's apparently got a good track \nrecord.\n\nAnd then there's the live action Eva movie which has been in the can \nforever which we don't know whether that's still even being made or not.\n\nThis is a very interesting question, Gigguk. I don't really have an answer \nfor it. But I'm really grateful you bought it up since I had been talking \nabout this with my dad for some time now. Thanks! :)\ufeff",

There are alot of like minded people out there \nthat I sure you can get along with. If anime was popular, it would be \neasier to meet them. \n\nRedline didn't have a budget that registers on any scale, and that movie is \nbadass\n\nI love Redline, but it's an exception because they had 7 whole years to \nprepare for it. Other anime barely make the deadline because they don't \nhave that luxury. \n\n They are still going to take home the same wages, and work the same hours, \nprobably even more because boss man is more inclined to push them harder.\n\nI already argue against this and I don't want to type all that again. :( \n You can look at my other comments if you willing to read all that. \n\nAs far as writing, those shareholders are going to make decisions that will \naffect the writing. \n\nYou do know it's like that right now. It not like the creator gets to \ndecide everything back then and they still don't. It just happen with the \nOreimo anime with it ending on a cop out. (Turns out you can have a show \nbase on incest but you can't actually end it with incest.  Who knew? )\n\n Eva would not be near as popular as it is today if people understood that \nwas making fun of their precious little anime tropes.\n\nI pretty sure most people figure it out and they still like it. Some people \nlike it because of it. If they don't know, you could tell him or her.\n\nThe new fans come in and latch onto one thing, and that is all they can \nsee, because they didn't read the manga, they don't know anything past the \nanime, and that is a crime against alot of those series. The Death Note \nmanga, just one example, was thousands times better than the anime, but \nthose vapid people who can't even bring themselves to read a comic don't \nfucking know this.\n\nI read the manga and watch the anime for Death Note. Was it really that \ndifferent?  Did they really change it that much? I know the ending was \naltered but nothing that was too drastic that affect the plot too much. \n The same people still die and the winner is still the same. \n\nIf it doesn't involve pretty colours that move then they can't pay \nattention long enough.\ufeff\n\nWell, Attack on Titan got pretty popular and there was so much brown.

No \ngood artistic decision comes from shareholders, for the most part, they \nwill make decisions that will make them money.\n\nYea, most anime fans suck, so why would we want more. /a/ is a horrible \nplace that is infested with moe blob loving vapid idiots. The thing is, \nthey could shovel shit down their throats, and as long as it has a kawaii \ndesu face taped over it, they are fine with whatever. That shit sells, so \nstudios will continue to make these safe shows to make profit. Feeding us \nthese two bit feels is a viable money making strategy, because people eat \nit up. Same goes for the harem shit, they are catering to our more baser \ninstincts and need for self validation. Which is why the whole mainstream \nthing is wanted.\n\nBigger budgets don't mean a damn thing compared to artistic integrity. \nRedline didn't have a budget that registers on any scale, and that movie is \nbadass. Money helps yes, but where does that money actually go? Not to the \nanimators, I can tell you that, meaning they don't give a fuck about how \nbig a budget a project has. They are still going to take home the same \nwages, and work the same hours, probably even more because boss man is more \ninclined to push them harder.\n\nAs far as writing, those shareholders are going to make decisions that will \naffect the writing. They don't give a damn about artistic integrity, \neverything is dollar signs to them. As of now, its hit and miss, you got \nthe moeblob fans eating up whatever is shoveled into their fat little waifu \npraising mouths, and then you got the safe series. Everynow and then \nsomething new will come along and change what \"safe\" means.\n\nAlso, I do realize the whole reason for liking something part is a bit \nunfair, but do you realize how much people don't get? Eva would not be near \nas popular as it is today if people understood that was making fun of their \nprecious little anime tropes. The new fans come in and latch onto one \nthing, and that is all they can see, because they didn't read the manga, \nthey don't know anything past the anime, and that is a crime against alot \nof those series. The Death Note manga, just one example, was thousands \ntimes better than the anime, but those vapid people who can't even bring \nthemselves to read a comic don't fucking know this. If it doesn't involve \npretty colours that move then they can't pay attention long enough.",

                "text": "As a gamer, trust me. You do not want anime to go mainstream. Oh sure, we \nget the occasional innovative game, but most of them involve zombie \napocalypses, dystopian futures, or present day cities molded to fit the \nsandbox game genre. If it's not first person and gritty, it's 3rd person \nand gritty. Usually, a game will also feature a white, gritty, gruff \nstubbly man protagonist who is so full of grim determination that I think \nall antidepressant factories and psychedelic drugs have been eliminated in \nservice of more god damn brooding.\n\nImagine if %90 of anime protagonists were grown up versions of shinji \nikari. Hell, then imagine giant robots and superpowers being removed for \nthe sake of arbitrary realism and instead we get scenes of people getting \ngas for their car or doing yoga.\n\nGaming, with the exception of the indie scene and POSSIBLY the JRPG genre, \nhas grown stale. Most racing games aim to be realistic, with any arcade \nexceptions being long gone or subjected to lower budgets. Hell, even JRPGS \nhave become more \"Select move, watch cutscene\" than anything interactive.\n\nHell, if anything, I wish more games would take cues from anime and stop \ntaking themselves so seriously. I mean, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon and Saints \nRow IV decided very wisely to follow the footsteps of Gurren Lagann in \nterms of throwing out logic and doing the impossible, but the sad thing is \nthose are exceptions now. And people complained about SR's new direction, \ndemanding instead that the series goes back to it's gangster roots for \nseemingly no other reason besides realism and being a GTA knockoff rather \nthan a GTA contender.\n\nTrust me, unless you want most of anime to rip off breaking bad or the \nwalking dead but worse, you don't want this.\ufeff",

While there is a shitload of \ncorporation producer evilness and less innovation, it doesn't necessarily \nmean games are bad. I don't know about some, but I LOVE the \"epic\" type of \nfeel that Skyrim or good CoD titles try to emulate more than damn near \nanything else because comedy and ridiculousness can just be insanely hard \nto pull off right. Hell, the main games I have in mind for that are GTA IV \nand RDR and those are both gritty and depressing as you say. I don't know. \nMaybe I'm just a hardcore AAA gamer but any other type of mood games try to \nmake just suck IMO. I know that Amnesia is AMAZEBALLS but I would never \nplay it because it's horror, and I really can't think of any titles at all \nthat attempt at either horror, \"epicness\", pointless gore, good comedy, \ngrit, or balls-to-the-walls. Indie games have always just fallen through \nfor me except for MC, Terraria, and TellTale if that counts, and they just \nseem like pointless fetch quests or puzzle games.\n\n\nAnyhow, my real point that I should've gotten to was that anime is \ndifferent from games because there is interacting vs. not and so trying to \ncompare the two, as pretentious as this sounds (sorry), is pointless.",

                "text": "The problem I have with anime is that the characters talk WAY too much. My \nfather has been in the same room as I was whenever I'm watching anime, and \nhe couldn't get himself into it. Granted, he knows that there are anime out \nthere that aren't geared towards kids, but I find anime to be dialogue \nheavy as well, so there isn't a steady, constant flow to it which has an \nestablished balance between dialogue and action, you know what I mean?\n\nI know that saying the characters \"talk too much\" sounds like a minor \ngripe, but I had to seriously think about it for a second at the time. \nThere have been moments in anime where certain characters get philosophical \nfor over five minutes or so, and there hasn't been any progress in terms of \nthe plot. I sometimes feel like that many anime out there is a chore to \nwatch because of these moments. It has heavily affected anime within the \nAction genre negatively as a result. I myself can't get into a lot of anime \nmade fairly recently anymore in addition to the industry being mostly \nsaturated (and you've made some great points about its image today). I end \nup having to watch anime made from the 70's, 80's, or 90's because of that.\n\nThat said however, I would be more than happy to share my love for whatever \nanime I'm watching if they are interested in it or if they watch it as \nwell. If they aren't interested, you just have to respect their decision \nnot to watch, but also be objective towards how they see anime in any shape \nor form. I also used to feel a sense of shame whenever someone walks in the \nroom and sees me watch anime, but really, it's not as bad as you think. I \nwatch Toonami every Saturday and yeah, my parents catch me watching it, but \nthey don't question it.\n\nWhat can I say, times have changed. Don't be afraid to express your \ninterest in anime. You may never know when these people come waltzing into \nthe same room as you are when you're watching an anime that will TOTALLY \nchange the way they look at it. And lucky for me, it happened with Attack \nOn Titan. My father was actually interested in it and the show itself \nwasn't as dialogue heavy. There's a reason why that show is such a big \nthing right now.\ufeff",

This is \nperfectly fine and feels natural if being read, but when made into dialogue \nin a TV show can take viewers out of the moment. Also, since a lot of anime \nis fairly low-budget, it's a lot cheaper to draw people talking about the \nplot than to show it actually happening.",

                "text": "If anime becomes mainstream, it becomes the victim of stakeholders. Yes, \nanime companies are still companies so of course they have things like \nstakeholders, fancy business men, etc. It already does go through changes \nbecause of people wanting money, but when something goes mainstream in \nAmerica, you might as well say all hope is lost. In modern America \nentertainment (Televised) this is how things are saw: The cartoons are for \nthe kiddies and the shows on AMC, HBO, etc., are for our teenagers and \nadults. This is why anime isn't really mainstream (except product wise but \noh well to that) because most of the viewers of the popular content in \nAmerica instantly classify it as a cartoon, so they figured it'd be left \nfor the kiddies. That said, no company would really want to produce any \nsorta anime in hopes of it being mainstream. This is why most of it, if not \nall, anime comes from Japan: where it grew. Many of us 'different' people \nwho are different because a lot of us aren't 100% washed up in the damn \n'mainstream,' like anime because it's unique style. Anime was beginning \nwhen animation as a whole was taken flight in Japan around the 40's. Japan \nwas looking toward Russia and America for ideas on how to style their \ncartoons, and eventually the young innovators of the time, such as Hayao \nMiyazaki, were creating things with a different style that became so \npopular in Japan during a bad time for animation. That's why anime stuck \nthere, and so that's why \"geeks\" \"nerds\" and \"weeaboos\" love the anime \nstyle, and that's why it's not mainstream, and I don't think it ever will \nbe. Because most \"geeks\" and \"nerds\" (excluding weeaboos this time) are \npeople that have larger horizons in their cultural interest, therefor it's \nour type of interest that makes anime not mainstream because it is \nsupported, loved, and driven by people who aren't washed in the mainstream. \nIf this paragraph isn't convincing enough, then just look at America's \ntrends: All girls of any age are wanting to shake their ass for \"fun\", all \nguys want to dress up in fisherman vest and wear caps of teams that come \nfrom sports they didn't know existed, and the favorite type of music is \nabout sex, drugs, being better than you, and sluttiness. So I don't think \nanime could stand a chance of being mainstream in America, and if it ever \ndoes it will be short lived.\ufeff",

The reason shows that are \"less mature\" towards an \naudience like North America, where our mainstream media is pervaded by \nserious and often violent shows, is due to this partiality the Japanese \nhave towards being young. The notion of the attraction to \"cute\" things and \nthe desire to look young is quite pervasive in Japan (I've lived there for \naround 8 months, and I'm not trying to sound like an asshole here, I'm just \ntrying to provide a bit of meaningful backing.) and hence their media often \nexudes this feel.\ufeff",

However, I don't believe \nwith shounen you have to pick a side between \"love it and watch it or avoid \nit\".\n\nI might be an anime fan, but I don't have the time to watch all of the \nlong-running series as anime. Generally speaking, I read the manga for \nthose longer ones (One Piece, Fairy Tail, Naruto, Bleach) because you avoid \nall the filler, it's far less of a time investment than the anime, and it's \nstill the same content with all the same characters, and all the same \nplots, etc. I miss out on the animated fight scenes, but, meh, I don't find \nit to be that big of an issue when that's just an added bonus, rather than \nthe main reason you should be judging or watching a show for in the first \nplace (and I can always just watch the fights somewhere online anyway, once \nthey come out in the anime, so it's not really a disadvantage either). What \nI'm getting at is that there needn't be a divide that strict when there are \nmultiple mediums you can use to enjoy the same thing. Perhaps the anime \nisn't for you, but the manga is. Many anime fans forget that their favorite \nseries are often (and overwhelmingly) adaptations of manga, so going back \nto the original content IS a legitimate option... (Some people don't like \nreading...and that's fine, but it does have it's advantages, and should be \nat least considered on that merit.)\n\nYes, Bebop and FMA accomplished more things in less time, but I wouldn't \nsay they accomplished the same things in less time. Naruto's story is about \nthe estrangement of people and how people can overcome that estrangement. \nIt's one of the best I've seen when it comes to that specific topic alone. \nBebop (to my memory, it's been a LONG time) wasn't particularly about that, \nand neither was FMA which delved into the value of a human life/soul more \nthan anything. I may have seen about half as many series as you have (more \nthan 100 more than the other guy), but I can still see the individual value \nin a series, rather than their relative value. Every series is unique \nenough that it offers something others don't. You just have to find out \nwhat that is.",

The plot revolves \naround two siblings who harbor a typical amount of disdain for eachother. \nWho are forced to work out their differences once the brother finds out \nthat his sister is a gigantic otaku (pervy nerdy Japanese anime/hentai fan \nof, and everything else to do with the genre) specifically she's obsessed \nwith animated novels and interactive games, all of which revolving around \nthe theme of brother sister incest. Yup. Right off the bat the brother \nfears for the worst as most of them have an older brother younger sister \ntheme ( he's the older bro). The sister however quickly assures him \notherwise. At first they don't let on anything for eachother. But you can \ntell it's there throughout the series. Their bond eventually grows stronger \nas they learn to live with eachother. Eventually they seriously start \nliking eachother. And you can kind of guess where it goes from there. It's \navailable all over the internet if you're interested in watching it. The \nfirst season isn't actually too bad. And isn't graphic if I remember \ncorrectly. I haven't watched the second season yet though.. I hope that \nanswered your question. And I hope after this you don't look at your \nbrother through a different lense lol.",

                "text": "Here's what I think Gigguk. Anime is just not destined to be main stream. \nBefore I go into why, I'll give you a little history lesson.\n\nIn the U.K. during the mid to late 1990s, mainstream media started taking \nan interest in anime, mostly likely due to Manga Entertainment (Manga Video \nthen). Channel 4 even screened anime late at night, namely Legend of the \nFour Kings and Cyber City OEDO. Newspapers published articles on the \nsubject and Jonathan Clements became editor of a magazine called Manga Max.\nIn fact, BBC2 once screed the film Wings of the Honneamise, which my mum \ntaped for me.\nAfter a while the media just stopped giving a shit about anime. Manga Max \nfolded and newspapers just didn't even bother with it anymore. Although \nafter the \"Anime Boom\" it seemed like Anime would be returning the public \nattention. Jonathan Ross presented a Japanese culture series called \nJapanorama and in 2005, Neo Magazine was launched and it still running to \nthis day. Even manga was in high demand as bookstores started stocking \nloads of titles. Sci-Fi Channel U.K. started screening anime late at night \nalso.\n\nBut in the end, the media and general public just didn't care. Anime and \nmanga just faded into that niche part of geek culture and that's where it's \ngonna stay.\nAnime is just not destined to be mainstream. And no Attack on Titan or even \nNeo magazine is going to change that.\ufeff",

They include more fan-service and their \nnumbers grow.  Unfortunately, this is just the corporate capitalistic \napproach.\n2) There are some good high quality anime that has used fan-service or are \necchi.  Gurren Lagann, Bakemonogatari, Golden Boy, and perhaps Redline \n(mostly for one scene).\n3) 99% seems a bit high, so I'll take that as a hyperbolic statistic.   \n Ping Pong: the animation has been my favorite anime of 2014, and does not \nhave any fan-service/ecchi.\n4) You've gotten older, and things that were more passable when you were \nyounger are less likely to get passed your brain.",

So to make it \nsimple I don't want anime become mainstream. \n\nBut i will guess it that in any years to come anime will become some \nmainstream thing so i think we just have to wait the time.\n\nP.S to my country: \"SUCK YOUR MOTHERFAHKING CENSORSHIP ASSHOLE\" \n\nOwh if anyone read this until the end. U sir/miss are increadble :). Leave \na reply? \n\n\ufeff",

Then anime will lose it's \nuniqueness and all creativity will be lost!\" but that's not necessarily \ntrue.\n\nSure, there will be the typical *Shonen* anime (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, \netc) that are already heavily pushed on the general audience, but that \ndoesn't mean that creativity or the niche culture will suddenly vanish.\n\nMuch like any medium, there will always be a small group of people \ndedicated to a certain interest or genre. In music, while pop music tops \nthe charts, lesser known artists are still selling tickets for venues. \nThere are even \"sub genres\" of other genre's sub genres, that have devoted \nfollowers and still push out CD's. Anime isn't any different.\n\nThe animation studios that target larger audiences are like the studios \nthat produce Hollywood blockbusters for the masses. If anime becomes \nmainstream, the animated blockbusters will be fairly generic and will make \nmillions of dollars at the box office. Animated series will have massive \nfollowings that will either tune in every week to catch the latest episodes \nor will buy the whole series.\n\nThe smaller animation studios that target niche audiences will still have \nthe freedom to deal with dark and controversial material, and explore \ndifferent animation and storytelling techniques.\n\nIt'd be nice to be able to walk down the street and hear people talking \nabout the latest Attack on Titan episode, or which anime they are most \nexcited for next season, and be able to discuss the same thing with other \npeople without needing to explain *WHY* you watch anime.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on anime becoming mainstream?\ufeff",

In my \nopinion, the entire concept of something being appealing to Westerners \n*because* of instead of in spite of its cultural quirkiness is an idea that \nwill just not fit into the head of a Western media executive. The more \npeople like that get there paws on these things, the more damage is done. \nThe appalling and disastrous attempt to localize *Cardcaptor Sakura* is a \ngood, if somewhat extreme, example of this actually happening.

There \nreally isn't this singular concept of \"anime\" that can be identified \n*except* by those looking in from the outside.  Their view is so myopic, \nthat they think things aren't mainstream simply because it's not popular \namongst their peers.\n\nBroadcasting and distribution do help, but they still wont make things \nacceptable.  Not everyone talks about Breaking Bad, True Blood, Lost, \nSopranos.  There are always niches and fads come and go, whether in \n\"normal\" TV or within anime.  Perhaps there will indeed be another wave \nthat brings Anime to the forefront of TV, perhaps there wont be.  At the \nmoment, that's controlled by the broadcasters, and until those broadcasters \nfigure out that it can be profitable, they really wont be inclined to \npopularize it (hint: they dont think it's worth the trouble or trying to \ncross localization and cultural barriers and to gain advertiser dollars and \nsubscriber money).\n\nSo, perhaps, the next wave that anime can ride in on will be, as +Jack \nBringloe implied in the shared post, when the current broadcast models die \noff, something like kickstarted kicks in, and people who want to watch \nsomething interesting have access to a legitimate source that wants to feed \nit to them instead of the current mainstream sources that dont want to \nbother.\n\nSubbers have tried, even crunchroll is making *some* headway, but that's \nmainly to replace the subbers.  The method of deliver is still niche and \nthe TV and the broadcasters controlling the contents that appear on there \nare still king.  Until that changes, it wont matter if you want Anime to go \nmainstream or not, it simply *wont* happen.\n\nThough I guess there's still the movie route, and albeit a singular \ninstance, something like Ghibli and Disney's partnerships can help.

I imagine overseas fans of anime are those who are attracted \nto eastern/Japanese aesthetics & storytelling at some conscious or \nunconscious level, separating them from the proverbial Joe Sixpack who will \nnever venture beyond domestic film/television.\n\nThat cultural core, centered in Akihabara, Japan, will always be there, \ncreating insular, referential genre hits like *Evangelion* and *Madoka \nMagica* and gobs of moe/bishoujo anime. But I also want there to be a space \nfor creators that do not speak to that particular core, like Masaaki Yuasa \n(Kaiba, Kick-Heart) and Shinichirou Watanabe (whose Cowboy Bebop & SamCham \nwere popular in the west).\n\nAnd the past titles that have found mainstream critical acclaim overseas \naren't culturally generic, necessarily. *Princess Mononoke* & *Spirited \nAway* are pastiches of Japanese folklore. *Akira's* urban apocalyptic \nvision is distinctly Japanese. *Millennium Actress* and *Perfect Blue* \ndepict Japanese celebrities. *Ghost in the Shell* (the 1995 film by Mamoru \nOshii) brought eastern spirituality and heavily symbolic, Japanese \nstorytelling to cyberpunk, inspiring further sci-fi cinema in the west. I \nthink that sort of un-core anime needs help (Ghibli aside) from fans \noverseas. That's where some degree of international \"mainstreaming\" can \nhelp diversify the output of the industry.",

So as \nit stands, anime as a whole wont make it to non Japanese shores in the same \nway as it is being produced in Japan.\n\nThat being said, I do think something like Little Witch Academia via \nKickstarter starts to prove an interesting point that there can be a paying \nmarket for something that can be funded for overseas export, even if it \napparently didnt do to well domestically.\n\nThis may not be so much about content production as it is about finding \nways to get select pieces distributed to audiences outside of Japan.

When creators \ncan find revenue from a spectrum of mainstream audiences (as with \"daytime\" \nanime), niche crowds (\"late night\" anime), domestic (e.g. moe/bishoujo \nstuff), and global *(Kick-Heart, LWA, Space Dandy, Ghost in the Shell),* \nthen we'll have a vibrant and diverse industry. I don't really care about \nliving in a world where I can casually talk to my relatives about the \nlatest anime. I only want the industry to be artistically vibrant.\n\nArguably something like that is starting to happen in the video game \nindustry, which for the past decade has been driven by stale blockbusters. \nNow there's the beginnings of a renaissance in the industry with new \nbusiness models (Steam, Kickstarter), paradigm-shifting technologies \n(\"cloud\" services, mobile devices with cellular data, Oculus Rift & the \nreturn of VR), and a complex upheaval in the gaming culture itself.\n\nI think the video game industry is going to get to that ideal place where \ngames of all types, at all levels of production, from studios and \nindividuals all over the world, are being made for diverse audiences.

A huge influence to what appears \nin entertainment is what sort of things help us collectively vent desire, \nfrustration, and everything else pent up during our daily take of societal, \nreligious, and other demands. Japan has almost no significant influence of \nChristianity, so that's going to affect the acceptability of sexuality in \nvarious contexts, but, showing affection (even hugging really) is far more \nan informal thing in the US than it is historically in Japan. Directly \nexpressing one's feelings, questioning authority, going off-script during \nspecific circumstances, what employment can expect from you, what your \nunderstood duties are to family, even attitudes to intervening for the \nbenefit of others is majorly different between the East and West. Shows \nhere in the US can have things like sex or comedy or nudity or violence, as \ndo some anime, but the lines they can/can't cross, what's taboo, what's \n\"normal\", what's \"allowed\", and most importantly, what's going to meet the \ndesires of the viewer are incredibly different. In other words, you can't \nkeep yourself 100% in the dark about Japanese culture and make any sense \nout of not only the content of anime, but also *why* that's the case.\n\nIt's really a complicated kind of thing.",

The mainstream have \nalways accepted specific anime but not the medium itself.
