Ontario is awesome to you can also cross the border to the U.S.A \nbut who would want to do that? Canada is awesome! Anyways Ontario has the \nCN tower that used to be the tallest tower in the world, many attractions \nand lots of neat shops and stores\nAnd also Canada's Wonderland (Amusement Park) is totally wicked! Go to \nQuebec during winter and maybe catch Carnival, A French festival that only \nCanada celebrates, have a treat of cold Maple Syrup (It's delicious!) see \nall the snow and ice sculptures,slide down an ice slide and play lots of \nfun activities,\nAnd maybe even see Bonhomme! Canada is amazing I didn't even tell you \neverything about Canada, there is many more about Canada to explore, and \nI'll leave it up to you to see what else Canada has for you........",
