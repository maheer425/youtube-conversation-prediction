He had a strong desire to get big in the \nmusic business. So do I. Him and I both have been writing music for a very \nlong time. The last one I can think of off the top of my head is that we \nboth have a penchant for cussing. And sorry if that was too personal.",

You \neither take it or leave it (my opinion).\n\nSecond. FACT. Not all his songs are positive...some are very negative. \nThis, of course, can be easily acknowledged by sitting down and listening \nto his songs. Or will you argue against this?\n\nLastly, I did not say he was a negative rapper. Read more carefully. I said \nsome of his material was very hateful and negative, and that I did not care \nfor them.\n\n*phew* Hope that cleared things up for ya.

Don't come on here and tell people to \nfocus on the lyrics when they know more than you. And as food for thought, \nthink about these lyrics:\n\"You hypocrites, who think the same sh*t, but don't say sh*t\"\n\"Acting like I'm the first rapper to smack a b*tch or say f*ggot\"\n\"The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all\"\n\"Give every kid who got played that pumped up feeling, and sh*t to say back \nto the kids who played 'em\"\n\"God gave you those shoes to fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em, be \nyourself man, be proud of who you are. And even if it sounds corny, don't \nnever let no one tell you that you ain't beautiful \" \nAnd trust me there is plenty more. So get your ignorant mind state out of \nhere, open it up, LOOK DEEPER, and \"come back, like nut on your spine\" \n(that was joke).",

Now 90% is a far fetch, but I was exaggerating to make a \npoint. Being accustomed to something is also tantamount to a rejection of \nchange, because as you said it is the fear of trying something new that \nmakes them cling to what they know. Fear is a driving factor in global \nsociological decisions, from great to small, and that will always be the \ncase because all life strives to live on, \"Fight or Flight\" and all that \njazz. Being part of the wave is comforting and safe because it gives a \nsense of ownership and belonging, as well as a shield when in need of \ndefense. Being part of that same group of people is often a good thing as \nwell, for example, Hitler used fear in the form of the Jews bringing change \nto inspire his people to hate, where as \"90%\" of the rest of the world was \nstrictly against such a ridiculous mindset, but then again you could also \nsay it was the fear of change that inspired them to fight back against \ntyranny. All life exists in a constant form of change every day, just by \nreading my messages you are accepting a change in your way of thought, and \nif you can accept that change, analyze it and still find yourself true \nwhile respecting the points made against you while not disregarding them as \nif they are meaningless, then that is truly an unclouded mind.",

We don't go to our boss at work because \nwe don't want to get fired from our job and be without things we need. And \neither our boss would be to stubborn to listen, or actually listen an \nadvance the company that you/he works for. The reason that people fight in \nThe Holy Lands is because they were brought up on that religion and find \nthat it should be their religion's and not some other religion. Them being \nafraid of change is irrelevant in that regard and I don't see a way that it \nbacks up your argument.

So when the rapper is in the \nstudio and if they don't have instruments then its not music, but if the \nrapper performs live and has instruments then its considered music? Also if \nrap is not music then what is it? Please don't say \"its rap.\"",

But on the \nsurface, his songs are fast, swear spewing, rage filled rhymes that aim to \ntake down artists, or to complain about some aspect of social life whether \nthat be parenting, or censorship of music. However, there is something that \ni've discovered in his songs that are way deeper than all that. Although \nhe's doing all the things I said above, I find that most of the deeper \nmeanings are about him struggling to get by with being famous, and being a \nfather, and a whole lot of the songs are about telling his listeners to not \nbe like him, and to live your life to the fullest. It's strange to hear it \nfrom someone if you can't find the meanings yourself I know. I've got a \nsoft spot for Eminems music, although I don't listen to it much anymore. \nWhen I was in highschool, believe it or not, listening to Eminems music \nbrought me out of depression, helped me turn away friends who tried to get \nme to do all kinds of drugs with them, and generally really actually molded \nmy personality into what it is today. I know people are going to call me a \ndick rider and shit, but I don't care, it's the truth. I would argue that \nEminems music has had one of, if not the biggest impact on me of anything \nin my life.",

I think \nit was creating a cozy space where they could watch movies and eat cookies \nin bed. As I said. I'm not here to defend MJ, i agree with you that some \nthings he admitted doing wasn't something I would choose to do. But hey.. \nthere might also be a lot of things you would do and I wouldn't and the \nother way around. You know the only evidence they had was the story of a \nfew little kids wich we know the parents had a history of fraud, the kids \ndidn't show up in court. We have tapped phonecalls of a father who admits \nhe just wanted the money and wanted to destroy MJ even though he knew his \nkid wasn't molested. So is there in fact ANY evidence. Nope........ \ntherefore.. he was acquitted. And correct so! It's so sad people still want \nto believe the things he was accused of. If someone accused me of a murder \nand I never did it, there was no evidence and I was acquitted and the whole \nworld still believes I commited the crime.. thats wrong.. why would that be \nany difference with Michael Jackson. Because he's famous and was somewhat \neccentric? Wow.. great analysis than.. You can't just accuse someone \nbecause he was different? We made him different.. He was different, and I \nloved it. Everybody loved it, untill those crazy stories just added up.. \n'Just because you read it in the magazine or seen it on the tvscreen don't \nmake it factual'",

He wanted to join \nthem so bad but he couldn't. He bought classmates candy just to be with \nhim.
