For example, \nknife should be pronounced \"kuh-nife\" but we use the more common, pheasant \nenglish \"nife\". Pretty much every mispronunciation between american english \nand UK english is born out of the division between how the nobility and \npeasantry spoke. Making things even worse is not only did they pronounce \nthings differently, but they often had completely different sets of \nvocabulary rooted in completely different languages. For example, pork is \ntaken from old french rooted in latin, a language the nobility took \ninspiration from extensively, while pig is taken from early germatic \nlanguages and anglish, the earliest form of english; you can see this with \nother cuts of meat such as cow(germatic) and beef (french) or chicken an \npoultry. English essentially has multiple personality disorder, and with so \nmany different root languages and histories mixed it becomes difficult to \nreally standardize spelling and pronunciation. Honestly, pronouncing the \nsyllables \"borough\" \"bOR-oh\" is just as correct as \"bru\", the same way \n\"nife\" for knife is just as correct as \"kuh-nife\"",
