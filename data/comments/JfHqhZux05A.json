Also the cop wearing \nthe sunglasses was fiddling with his little blue notebook, showing signs of \nanxiety (probably because of the camera) which is a natural reaction for \nmost people who are being filmed. The way he was unsure about the legality \nof the prank was also a sign that he was not confident about the law, \ntherefore giving in and letting the pranksters continue. An experienced cop \nwould tell the pranksters that they are disrupting a lot of people and at \nfirst politely ask them to stop but then will resort to threatening arrest \neven after knowing that the prank is harmless. But since they were called \nout to check it out, they wouldn't want their \"authoritative\" pride to get \ntarnished by these pranksters by walking away empty handed so they'll \narrest first, ask questions later.\ufeff",

Another time I was at a party and the police \nshowed up with 4 officers and broke into the apartment with no warrent. \nThat's how it is here.
