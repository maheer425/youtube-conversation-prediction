Yes, but that happens even in Western countries. \nAmerican women still aren't paid the same amount as the men. There are \nstill statistics on this. As far as respect goes, that is arguable. I know \nthat in Korea, men are expected to act more conservatively. You rarely see \nmen catcalling women. That is considered low behavior. In some places in \nAmerica, that is considered normal. There are special parking spaces for \nwomen in some areas of Korea that make it more convenient for them. In \nAmerica, some people don't respect stay-at-home moms because they really \nthink they are unfeminist or lazy. Is that respect? I don't think so.\n\nStudies have shown that parents do best with a primary caregiver that is \nable to devote their time to raising them. Of course, a parent has to work. \nUsually, it is better for the man to do so because women are more natural \ncaregivers. If your mom was able to work, it was probably after you went to \nsleep or was sent to someone else or you were a child that could occupy \nyour own time for hours and hours. This may be possible for older kids, but \nnot very young children. A woman who works cannot provide as much time with \nthe child as a woman who is a devoted stay-at-home mom. That is a fact. \nUnless she does the work when the child is sleeping or at school, the child \nis going to miss out. Children deserve to have someone that is always going \nto be there.

No culture can be defined as such. No culture fits \ninto black and white categories like this. Noticing differences in culture \nis fine, as there is no denying that there are indeed differences in \nculture all over the world, but exoticizing other cultures as being so \ndifferent from your own is setting a group of people apart based on \ncriteria that you are observing, making your own culture seem like the \n\u201cnormal\u201d culture and the other culture seem like the \u201cother.\u201d While the two \npeople who made this channel may have had good intentions, they try so hard \nto seem unprejudiced that it makes them seem even more prejudiced than they \nprobably are.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+James\nFeminism works towards equality, and is a portion of Egalitarianism. I \nthink that you have been watching too much Fox News, and have this awful \nidea in your head that feminism somehow isn't about equality. Feminism \ndeals with problems about gender, specifically dealing with issues that \nwomen run into. That doesn't make it sexist, no more so than black rights \ngroups are somehow racist for trying to tackle issues that specifically \naffect black communities. Feminism is just apart of the equality pie, and \nit doesn't deal with men vs. women no matter how offended MRA groups try to \nget. 1st and 2nd wave feminism deals specifically with women's issues that \ncannot be properly addressed by generalized groups because they are not \nissues that other groups have to deal with on a regular bases. Like how I \nwouldn't really understand the difficulties of discrimination against black \npeople, general groups can't really tackle reproductive rights, women being \ndenied access to proper health care, or birth control \"unless they're \nmarried\".\n\nModern Feminism specifically deals with the demonetization of traits that \nare deemed arbitrarily feminine in society, and how that attitude affects \nboth men and women negatively. Like how a perfectly natural desire for a \nman to be a good father and take care of his kids is seen as \"feminine\" \nbecause somehow \"parenting\" has fallen into the realm of the \"feminine\". \nJust really think about that for a moment, because it's mentioned in this \nvideo. How is a father taking care of his children somehow not seen as a \n\"male\" role? These are purely social constructs that never existed in \nnature.\n\nModern feminism deals with issues where men get beaten to death in the \nstreets for wearing pink, because it's feminine, and seen as lesser, and \nunacceptable for a man to wear (despite the fact that pink used to be seen \nas the male colour, and blue was the female one). It has to do with the \nfact that our society has put out two boxes, labeled one male, one female \nand started throwing random traits that have nothing to do with gender into \neach one, labeled \"male traits\" as good, \"female traits\" as inferior and \npunish anyone who does not comply with that. Whether it's a female \nelectrician (because fine motor skills, and wire placement is \nevolutionarily manly), or a male baker (which used to be a completely male \ndominated trait, but hey, man in the kitchen making something other than \nbacon!?). Modern feminism deals with how arbitrary gender roles prescribed \nto social dynamics do nothing but hinder our society, male or female.\n\nIn this video they're talking about the same issue that Japan is facing. \nThe idea that a guy is expected to be the sole bread winner, and never be \nable to be the father his kids need. The idea that a woman has to stay in \nthe house and stop working to raise a family. These are the main issues as \nto why the Japanese fertility rates are falling. With the population size, \nthings are expensive, and guys just don't want to work themselves to death \nto pay for a family they'll never see anyways. Women don't want to work \nthemselves through school, get a job, then drop everything to look after \nthe kids of a man she'll never see. Else, she can keep her job, and \nbasically end up working two full time jobs, her normal one, and then full \ntime as a domestic house keeper for a partner that's unwilling to share the \nwork and responsibilities of their house hold. So people just aren't \ngetting married, all in all, they're not even having sex! Japan has started \nhaving all female, and all male apartment buildings due to this insanity.\n\nDo you know what would fix that? Doing away with those ridiculous gender \nroles. Doing away with the male and female trait boxes, and stop saying \nthat anything \"male\" is \"good\", and anything \"female\" is \"bad\" even if both \ngroups share those traits. Like both men and women being able to be strong, \nsmart, confident, weak, shy, naive, ect. These systems make it so that guys \ndon't feel like they can ask for help because \"MAN UP\" will be his answer, \nand his wife will just generally be assumed to be incompetent out of the \ngate because she's a woman. The cost of living is too high in our society, \nin theirs, and globally as a general rule. It just makes sense that both \nPARTNERS share the economic and domestic burdens, and have a sense of \nshared responsibility in the house.\n\nUnless they start adopting feminist ideology (not the femi-nazi strawman \narguments that Fox News likes to go on about) they're going to end up like \nJapan. I don't know about you, but I think it's unfair to expect my \nboyfriend to support me. I'm an adult, and I'm more than capable of getting \na job, and not burdening him with all that responsibility. He feels the \nsame with the domestics, and we're pretty darn happy about it. But they \nhave an obsession with infantizing women in the working environment, and \nmen in the home fast, so we'll see how that goes. I'm all for things being \nas 50/50 as they can be, and treating people like people.",

But this is one of my least favorite arguements.\nOne in three women has experienced domestic violence in their life. That's \n30%. The point is, so many men do not care if they are hitting a woman or \nnot. It doesn't even matter if this woman is his girlfriend, wife, mother, \nwhatever. My own uncle has tried hitting my grandma like two years ago. \nLuckily, shes an ex gang member so she knows how to hold her own.\nAnyway. The worst thing about domestic violence is, these men do not see \nwomen as human or equals. That's why I am a feminist. Feminism is about \nequality and getting these men to STOP hitting women. And tbh some men need \nto stop hitting other men too, violence is almost never ever ever the \nanswer. and yes if some women are picking random fights with dudes that \nneeds to stop as well.",

It seems that we are wise enough to agree that we should not \nassume things about people nor should we put people into camps.  As a \nfriendly suggestion, try not to put too much credence on what is said on \nthe internet by internet trolls.  The people who spew their garbage out on \nthe internet do not even have the guts to say these things in person.  It \nis only through treating everyone with respect and not making assumptions \nthat we can try to change people's mis-impressions and behavior.  Peace and \ngood luck to you James.      ",

I just don't see the logic in anyone \"hating\" upon any \ngender (be it man, woman, transsexual, or whatever).  We are all people \nwith feelings, etc. and we should all be treated as people.  I think when \npeople try to carve out distinctions like gender, etc. and put people into \ncamps or classifications, it automatically creates conflict and \nmisunderstanding.  I know that it will not necessarily change someone, but \nif someone is bitter towards you, try to \"kill them with kindness.\"  It \nlikely won't change them, but you never know.  It sometimes works for me \nand people who have a mis-impression suddenly change because there are all \ntypes - men who hate women (misogynists) and much worse, there are women \nwho hate on other women (those are particularly vicious).  So, James, I am \nreally sorry that you feel that some women in your life have disrespected \nyou.  As I said, everyone should have their feelings and dignity respected \nas a human being.  But, what I am trying to say is don't assume that people \nhate you and put them into camps or classifications. It's much better when \neveryone remembers not do that and tries to change their attitude by \nshowing that respect and kindness can come from a man or a woman. Good luck \nJames we will have a better world if we don't put people in camps and we \neach strive to get people with mis-impressions to change.  Sometimes, the \nbest way to get others to change is for us to project respect and kindness. \n We all are a member of the same race -- the human race.            ",

Both of \nus have mental issues, but our issues are ego-dystonic (meaning we can \nrecognize them as issues, because they're not personality based). I agree \nthat mental health is definitely important. For us, it's the only thing \nthat we remotely have issues with. We've never faught, but it's pretty \nshitty to be depressed or cry or feel angry because of your issues that are \nso difficult to fix, as well as of course personal RL stuff that can \nhappen. Both of us were ... well, fairly content being on our own. When we \nmet, we were not looking for anyone and hadn't been for a while. Not to say \nthat looking for someone is a bad thing, but you need to be at least \nrelatively ok with your life and not expect your partner to fix it. A \npartner is like really awesome food. You need to be ok surviving on the \nbasics, but once you have the really awesome food, you don't want to let it \ngo. Kinda hard to explain, so I hope that made sense.Give and take, you \nboth need to bring something to the relationship. And communication, that's \npretty much the most important thing. If you're upset tell them, directly \nand talk it through. And they should show the same courtesy.My parents \n(I've actually disowned both of them) were the opposite of a good \nrelationship, abuse, both have severe personality disorders, had a kid when \nthey couldn't afford it ... aaaaand, married in 3 weeks of knowing each \nother .... yeah.",

My brother is the sole \nbread winner in his home, and he helps around the house and cooks \nsometimes, and is all about my niece. She's the apple of his eye, and he is \nnot afraid to change her diapers. My brother loves to cook, and has always \nbeen a really amazing cook.\n\nI'm not sure how he's less of a man because he doesn't want to treat his \nwife like a servant, and wants to share his amazing cooking skills \nsometimes. In any event, egalitarian marriages do exist, and they are \nhappier. It's easy to go to work for 8 - 9 hours and then come back home. \nRaising children, being a home maker, not to mention maintaining yourself \nas a wife, is a full time job. My brother transformed as a person when he \nbecame a husband. He went from being a solemn guy to smiling all the time. \nStop being a neanderthal and you'll get a wife who is truly happy to be \nwith you and has butterflies in her stomach any time she talks about you,",

Nobody is sitting here saying, \"Gee, I wish women weren't allowed \nto vote. I wish women weren't allowed to work.\" Saying, \"Well... just \nbecause those people are a bad representation of feminism doesn't mean \nfeminism is bad!!\" Yes, we know. Lol. That's why we're criticizing THEM. \nThey are the majority of western feminists, because women are basically \nequal in the western world. When one calls herself a feminist, it is \nimplied that she still believes women are below men, which is not the case, \nand women who believe that are self-victimizing spoiled children. That's \nwhy we are against modern, western feminism. Because the term feminism is \nhardly needed in the western world, and people who proclaim it is generally \nARE the whiny spoiled ones. We don't attack the true genuine concept of \nfeminism. Don't twist people's words to fit your emotion-driven agenda. \nNice try though.",

I believe \neveryone deserves the same rights. In SK they have the same RIGHTS, just \ndifferent opinions and there is nothing wrong with that. Modern feminism, \nall I've ever seen from it, is whining and complaining. Women have their \nrights, they CAN do whatever they want. There's nothing wrong with having \nopinions on what they SHOULD do however, as long as they're not FORCED onto \nanyone. Is anyone forcing the women in South Korea to act a certain way \nunder law? No. So hop off your quick-to-judge high horse. Most of the \nmodern feminists I've seen are just prideful and any type of criticism to \nthem causes them to throw a tantrum. You're pretty much proof of that. You \ntook something I said, and twisted it because you're only out to try to \nmake yourself appear smart. I have nothing against people fighting for \nRIGHTS. I SUPPORT that. I would never say women are not allowed to vote or \nanything of the sort. Men and women are both of equal value and both \nequally have the right to choose what they do with their life. But having \nequal value doesn't automatically mean having the same roles. Like I said, \nI prefer the traditional roles. Does that mean I would force it on other \npeople? Nope. I never said women shouldn't vote or anything. You give \nfeminists a bad name because your emotionally driven response just makes \nwomen in general appear illogical. Nice going. When you attack other \npeople's opinions that do not affect you, that's when you have a problem. \nYou do what YOU want, and others can do what THEY want. Get over it.",

There really isn't a lot more acceptance.  It's just less \nsocially acceptable to voice those opinions publicly.  If I finish my \nstudies and go into my chosen field, which is made up mostly of men, and \nthen I decided to have children and spend time with them - I'd be a typical \nwoman.  If I waited or chose not to have kids, I'd be selfish (as my good \nfriends who never ever want kids will tell you, they get this on a daily \nbasis).  My husband, who is a cartoonist/illustrator, works from home.  \nI'll be retuning to work when I have to, he'll stay at home.  Every man I \nknow who has done this has been criticised for being lazy or not \"wearing \nthe pants\".  I know it's more common now and I have read articles about \nthese dads, praising them, and I think that's great.  But a lot of people \nstill aren't on board.  Get a grown man to cry in public and see how that \ngoes.\n\nNo one has perfect equality, but it's silly to think North America is \nnumber one, because they aren't.  Not in anything.

                "text": "I live in one of the poorest counties in West Virginia, in the U.S. When it \ncame to the part where you mentioned that it was okay if women worked, so \nlong as they took care of the kids and cooked and kept house, I thought to \nmyself: \"Oh my gosh! Korea is like home!\" Seriously: Around here, women are \nexpected to first be keepers at home and *then* career women. If women go \nto college in West Virginia, that's a side-project: The lives of their \nchildren and husbands come first. It's ingrained into the minds of the \nyoung women that they can either be mothers or career women, not both. As a \nresult of this, not many women pursue higher education.\n\nUnlike in Korea, I think, most women here tend to get married a little on \nthe young side: One of my best friends from high school was married at \nsixteen; another is getting married this year (at eighteen); a cousin of \nmine was married to a man over ten years older than herself at only \nsixteen. At only seventeen, I feel like an old maid, and my grandma already \ngoes on about every man I date (or even my best friend!) as if she expects \nme to marry any one of them any time now.\n\nYet despite getting married young, many women end up getting divorced later \nin life, and without an education or means of supporting themselves or \ntheir children, most of them are impoverished for life. Personally I think \nit's miserable. \n\nAnyway, er, I dunno if that's at all similar to South Korean culture \n(having never been to South Korea), but that one sentence you guys said \ncompletely spawned a bunch of thoughts in my head, and I kind of got a \nlittle carried away talking. Y'know how it is, lol. I love you guys' \nvideos, by the way. I think I've watched nearly all of them in two days. \nO.o\ufeff",

I'm actually contemplating going overseas to teach English \nafter university (specifically in Korea), so that's something very \ncomforting to hear.\n\nAs for your surprise at my comparison: Here, it goes far beyond the women's \neducation and choice to pursue a career. In West Virginia, it also  which \nsays that women are to be \"keepers at home,\" and which many of my \ngeneration continue to take literally.\n\nAs for my personal experiences with the male thoughts on women within West \nVirginia: I've dated three boys which were either my age or a year younger \nthan myself. Only one of the three of them viewed me as an equal. The other \ntwo mentioned marriage less than a month after I'd begun to date them, and \nlargely ignored me when other males were around - as if my opinions were \nless noteworthy than their own. On that same note, at holiday dinners I've \nnoticed that the men here will eat in one part of the house and the women \nwill eat in another. The father of my third boyfriend refused to allow his \ndaughter to cut her hair, as long hair was \"a mark of being a woman\". It \nwasn't uncommon for him to say that certain negative behaviors were \"just \nlike a woman,\" or to make blonde jokes, or to overrule his wife in any \ndecision.   \n\nIt's only with the revelation of the Internet that some have managed to \nbreak free of the mentality that women are mentally and spiritually less \nthan men. Still, my ambition of traveling the world - not only to Korea - \nand eventually working my way into politics has caused some amount of alarm \namong the members of my family. My grandmother has expressed the view that \nwomen are incapable of leading nations or holding government positions, as \nhave several of my former schoolteachers. Unfortunately, this and the other \naforementioned views on women are shared sentiments among many people in \nWest Virginia, and unlike in Korea, I believe the situation of the women \nhere to be improving at a very slow pace.",

                    "text": "Wow. Never would I have imagined that somebody from WV would compare her \nsituation to Korea! This is really new to me and I had to write a reply to \nyou comment.\nAs for your question, yes and no. WV and Korea are similar in a way that \n(a) the moms are being the \u2018supermoms\u2019 who keep themselves busy doing both \ntheir work and house chores, and (b) this is due to the traditional and \nconservative view on gender roles, that the house chores are more \nappropriate for women. However, there are clearly differences between them; \n(a) women get equal amount/level of education as men in Korea and (b) the \nfamily does not come first for all women; their career is important to them \nas much as it is to men, that is, both men and women value their career.\nNow that I put it this way, it may be a bit confusing to you, but if you \nunderstand that Korea has quite a low birth rate, and that the children are \nvery precious to the parents, its situation might be a little bit more \ncomprehensible. In the past, the Korean government worried about the \nrapidly increasing population and therefore launched a campaign to reduce \nthe birth rate. The campaign lasted during the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, and it \nactually took effect. The couples started having only one or two children, \nand since there were less children to look after, they started to invest \nmore in their education, whether it was a girl or a boy. Before then, when \nthere were a lot of children in a family, parents did favor boys because \nKorea, just like a lot of countries over the world, had been a \nmale-dominant society for a long time. However, when they started having \nonly one or two children, girls were just as dear to them as the boys; the \nparents did not discriminate between them anymore, but gave both of them \nequal love and support. Since then, the girls proved to be just as \nsuccessful as \u2013 and oftentimes excelling \u2013 the boys at school, and \ntherefore could get decent jobs and better careers.\nNowadays, about 80% of Korean people go to universities each year \u2013 if you \ninclude 2-year colleges then it would be over 90% \u2013 and last year, 74.3% of \nthe girls went to the university while 68.6% of the boys went to the \nuniversity. This would tell you that girls receive no less education than \nboys and that they do pursue a life as a career woman. They don\u2019t go to \nuniversities to meet nice guys and settle down; they have their own dreams \nand ambitions, and they are not willing to sacrifice them for their future \nhusbands and children. The thing is, people\u2019s perception cannot catch up \nwith the changing social behaviors, so there are still a lot of people who \nthink that it is woman\u2019s job to look after the family and children. Because \nof that, a lot of women turn into \u2018supermoms\u2019; it\u2019s hard to fight back the \nsocial pressure on them, but they still can\u2019t give up their dream job.\nHowever, even though the perception is slow to change, it does change \novertime. Personally, I think it had changed a lot these days, because when \nI talk about this gender issue with my friends, every single one of them \nhas told me that parenting and house chores should be done equally, and it \nwould be unfair if either wife or husband has to take on more \nresponsibilities than the other. I am pretty sure this is what is on the \nminds of the young people in general. I am 23 year-old girl who is about to \ngraduate from one of the SKY universities mentioned in the clip, and trust \nme, the guys in my university are not willing to become breadwinners for \ntheir ideal hot girls; they, too, believe in gender equality, discuss \nfeminism with me, and know that they should respect the careers of their \nloved ones just as they want their careers to be respected. I love Simon \nand Martina and I am often surprised at their precise descriptions of the \nKorean society, but sometimes they can be a little inaccurate because there \nare some deeper things that are just too hard for the foreigners to \ndiscover. And I\u2019m sorry, but I find this one particular clip quite \nmisleading.",

It's fine if you want to have your husband lead but \nthat is not his birthright just like it's not your ONLY place to be quiet \nand follow him. If there really was equality you like say, why is it that \nif I have the same skill as a man and if I were to work as the same \nposition as him he is paid more than I am? I guess that is \"equality\" in \nstatus then. Please, numerous successful companies have more than one CEO \nand if there is one CEO there is a board to regulate things. Governments \ndon't have two presidents because presidents are elected, but even then \nthere is a secretary and vice-president and a congress that reviews the \ndecisions of the president and it made unanimously. In the past of America, \nif the other candidate lost they would be vice-president and eventually \nafter the term of the predecessor is over they would be president. That's \nhow a government works. If the government or company was run by the run of \none man and only one man that is called either tyranny, communism, or \nmonarchy. (FYI the president/government is paid by companies to do things \nhow do you think these candidates get money to run for office and why the \n\"law/bills\" really benefit the 1% of the world that is rich?) An \"ideal\" \nfamily dynamic is equality between two partners to work together if we \ndidn't need the equality then there is no point in the marriage. If \"women \nSHOULD NEVER be superior to men\" why were there civilizations with superior \nwomen? I'm not fighting for superiority I'm fighting for equality for \neveryone. Women don't have to be homemakers and men don't have to be \nbreadwinners if they don't want to; people should be able to do what they \nfeel is right for them and what makes them happy without the scrutinizing \ngaze and ridiculing of others.The new age is upon us and things are \nchanging either you become a progressive or you don't.

I will just give you a quote from my mom: \"You are \nall old ENOUGH to do cleaning around the house. I come home after working \nsixteen hours and I have not done anything in the house. You guys are the \nones making the mess,  so you should clean your mess. If you need something \nto eat make it and CLEAN UP after yourself. I can't clean after all FIVE of \nyou.\" (The plus one includes my dad) This quote basically says everything. \nRight when I turned five or from the moment I walked my mom taught me, and \nmy siblings, to clean. I understand that you are a kid and you should play, \nbut that does not mean that you should not teach kids good habits at a \nyoung age. Especially with cooking. My mom is getting onto all of us who \nare female to learn to cook. I am working on it!! My mama should be able to \ncome to a clean home where there is some good food being cooked. SHE \nDESERVES IT!!\n \ufeff",

And whatever it is, its keeping families \ntogether, and not ruining their kid's lives. \ufeff\n\nThat is debatable, i do think very highly of how much effort goes into \nmaking the marriage work and not easily giving up on it. But saying that a \nlow divorce rate keeps families together (maybe in name yes, but in many \ncases not the way it matters) and doesn't ruin kids lives is a fallacy.\nYes in many cases it is true, but in equal or more cases still, it is very \nfalse. A happy, healthy couple is what makes healthy (mentally at least) \nkids and families.\nSo in those cases where the family is \"together\" merelly by societal \nimperatives, your phrase couldn't be more far from the truth. In fact, \nsometimes a non-traditional family where the couple is divorced may be \nbetter to the kids than seeing daily their sires fighting or ignoring each \nother.\nI'm just saying, let's not get hot headed and generalize, not to one side, \nnot to the other, what works and doesn't works is very particular to each \nperson and couple. There isn't a perfect way, or a perfect culture, people \nor nation, everyone does the best they can with what they have.",

                    "text": "+Coco Pops The stigma that comes with divorcing someone is natural. Much \nlike how theres stereotypes for a person. You can't get rid of it. Why? \nbecause stigma is something that is observed and individually judged to \nmake it generalized to be bad (in this case). I never said, kids will turn \nout to be bad if you divorce someone. Please read again. You cant be \nselfish and pretend your kids didnt happen, or neglect your parenthood \nduties to YOLO your own life. thats why most (if not all) parents from east \nasia (not sure about other countries) do not go through separation, \nregardless of what happens to them. Parenthood isnt something that is taken \nlikely. Once you have children, your life, your desires, your dreams are \nall gone. Being raped of course,... is a different matter that isn't \ninvolved in this argument. Once you have children through marriage, you \nlive for your kids. This is why the topic of marriage is an extremely \nimportant subject in asia moreso than the west and how people don't marry \nuntil their 30s compared to their worldly counterparts. There is even a \ncurrent problem atm because of this. Most younger generations (under 40) \nare not having kids because of the heavy responsibility and sacrifice that \ncomes attached to it, this is leading to a overpopulation of older \npeople:younger people. This mentality is not just mine. This is how most of \nasians from the mainland think. And if you don't accept this, then you're \nbetter off living in the west. Of course there are extreme cases of abuse, \nwhich part of the worlddoesnt have this trait? but should it define \nmarriage as a whole in asia? no. There are more abuse cases in asia than in \ntheir western counterpart because asia along with the middle-east are \nsocieties dominated by men. I'm not trying to be sexist or anything, but \nits a cultural thing that no one can change until the society gets more \ndiverse (which is highly unlikely).",

The backwards \nmindset where you should stay with someone for the kids. What if you are \nabused? Raped? You are fighting all the time? The people I meet who have \ndivorced parents are perfectly FINE. They are happy they didn't end up like \nthe kids whos parents didn't. Those kids aren't stupid. They know what \nhappens in the parents lives and then start to become sad and it affects \nbehaviour! \nMany in the east would divorce if it wasn't for the stigma still associated \nwith it. They would report rape. A divorcee or single parent can provide \nmore love separately than two people might.\nPeople should not break up for small things like they do today however. I \ndo know people who have mini arguments and then BOOM they are divorced. \nTHAT is stupid. It is happening more often. Other than that cheating is a \nmain cause. Should a person stay with a cheater? Even if they provide lots \nof money? Or will the person being cheated on have to be called a DOORMAT \nand GOLD DIGGER. Society has so many issues.
