                "text": "*NEW VIDEO: Top 100 Things Not to Say to a Police Officer*\n\nThis was one of the more fun Top 100 videos that I've ever made. This video \nwas made in conjunction with http://youtube.com/thehomelessheroes who I met \nat http://playlist-live.com last year. The group is comprised of an artist \n(he's the one who makes all the paintings you see in my videos) and a \nrapper. They have some really innovative videos on their +YouTube channel \nso definitely check them out!\n\nSince the Homeless Heroes are based in Tampa, Florida and I am based in \nOrlando, Florida, it was only a matter of time before we hooked up to make \na video! You can definitely expect future collaborations! \n\nThrow me the alley,\nScooter Magruder\n\nTags: #Police   #Cops   #Comedy  \ufeff",
