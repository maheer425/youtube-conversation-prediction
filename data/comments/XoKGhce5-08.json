As you hint, both are \ntypes of Japanese super hero.\n\nPendleton Ward made AT and Bravest Warriors. The thing I see in common for \nall of these is heroes, weird powers, and a semi-cuddley personality I'd \nattribute to the studio's tastes, but that's a comparatively general \ncategory compared to the Simpsons/Family Guy/King of the Hill/South Park \nera of North American animation.\n\nI respect your desire for variety; for something different from heroes and \nmagic, try anime series like Kino's Journey or Azumanga Daioh. :)",
