Child Protective Services taking away a kid because \nhis name was Adolf Hitler is fucked up the parents were not abusing their \nchild so what if the parents are Nazis they live in America in America you \nhave the right to believe in what you wanna believe in you can name your \nchildren names out of the Bible your name in your kids after what you \nbelieve in Nazis believe that Hitler was correct in what he did they are \nanti Jew they named their son after somebody they saw as a good leader that \nis there a personal beliefs they have a right to have children and call \nthem whatever they want. America is supposed to be a free country freedom \nof speech and freedom of religion by taking away their kid because of his \nname they were pretty much taking away their freedom of speech they were \nalso taking away their freedom to believe what they want to believe and \nhonestly I think that is awful they were not abusing the child what if they \nwere good parents? So what if they are teaching their kid the Nazi ways \nthat is what they believe and that is their own prerogative. I find that \ndisgusting on so many levels that they are in foster care simply because \ntheir parents are Nazis and the children's names were controversial there \nare couples out there who beat the shit out of their kid but end up getting \ntheir kids back there are people who molest children and end up getting \ntheir kids back but they will not give a kid back to Nazis over a \ncontroversial name that is wrong and so fucked up. Nazis discriminate well \nthe government taking away their kids because of their beliefs and a \ncontroversial name was discrimination as well. \n\nI know people probably are going to hate me for this and say that I'm \nfucking awful and yada yada yada but I don't care it's the overall fact \nit's a double standard the government is discriminating against them \nbecause they discriminate and the name is controversial that is wrong.\ufeff",

                    "text": "Well, IQ is a composite measure of a bunch of things, but although IQ is a \ngauge of intelligence, it's not an absolute scale. What it really aims to \ndescribe is a person's intelligence, or more generally their mental \ndevelopment, in relation to his/her peers. For example, a 5 year old with \nan IQ of 100 is right on par which is why values near 100 are most common. \nA 5 year old with an IQ of 150, however, is considered as mentally \ndeveloped as a 7.5 year old. Conversely, a 5 year old with an IQ of 50 has \nthe mental development of a 2.5 year old. So a 5 year old with an IQ of 150 \nis not smarter than an adult with an average IQ. IQ tests take into account \nnot only math, science, language and critical thinking skills, but also \nthings such as cultural awareness, understanding of relationships, \nmaturity, self control, and morality. This is why you should never trust \nonline free IQ tests that only present puzzles like anagrams or overly \nwordy math problems, because they aren't testing the complete spectrum of \nmental development that IQ tests seek to describe. So in relation to your \nquestion, yes, learning new things such as this does increase your IQ, \nalbeit very little, but it does. And before you ask, yes, it is possible to \nmanually increase your IQ through education, but don't expect to get even a \nsingle IQ point out of watching vsauce's videos: it takes a large amount of \nwork to get even one IQ point.

US naming freedom just sucks.\nMind you, you can name your baby a proper name without approval with any of \nthe (gender fitting) names already established in a list of previously \napproved names, or in case of a foreign parent, his/her country. Otherwise \nname proposals are screened and they would be only approved by the relevant \ncouncil if said name is used in another language, if it wouldn't cause harm \nto the child later (bullying, puns etc.), and if it fits the phonology of \nHungarian. Oh and unisex names aren't allowed this way either.\n\nSo for example Kevin or L\u00e9a would probably be accepted upon request, since \nthey aren't shameful and are pronounceable by any Hungarian without prior \nexposure to them.\ufeff",

But yes, in a lot \nof more homogenous countries naming laws aren't seen as that bad, and so \nfar, there weren't any upheaval, probably because even Chinese here name \nthere children here with Hungarian names (or they get a foreign name \naccepted, I don't know the exact law regarding second-generation children).\n\nAs I see, people who are proponents of naming laws (including me) think \nthat stupid names are somewhat of a shame to the nation of the beholder. As \nI'm living in a country with (pretty lax, imho) naming laws good for our \n99.9% majority, I'm fine, but I get horrified by some names in the US when \nthey pop up on the Internet.\n\nInteresting fact that we have a racial minority (I wont say which) who \noften decide they want American (Jessica) or Italian (Armando) sounding \nnames.\n\nAlso Mercedes, or rather, Merc\u00e9desz is a perfectly okay name here, though \nit might be perceived as a little bit fancy if used with a plain family \nname, eg. Smith. I happen to know two Mercedes, and neither of them belong \nto wealthy families. Not among the most common names here, but relatively \ncommon. I can imagine it though that people in the States think more of the \ncar brand, but Mercedeses and other foreign cars are so common here that we \ndon't really think of the car when hearing the name. Though it was a name \nfirst, car brand second, because of the founder's daughter. So it doesn't \nreally connect with wealth, for whatever reason.\n\n(To show you some of the less common, but perfectly applicable female \nnames, we have Lea, Korn\u00e9lia, X\u00e9nia, Rox\u00e1na, Lili\u00e1na, Petra, Olga, Kitti, \nFranciska and Lujza. I really think we have plenty of nice names to choose \nfrom even with the naming law.)",

If you guys had as big of an \nimmigrant influx of, say, Arabs as the UK or France has had, there'd be \nsome pretty significant outcry from that community to change the law so \nthey can give their children born in Hungary Arab names.\n\nAlso, bizarre names are waaaaay less prevalent in the US than you'd think. \nYeah, you scratch your head when it happens, but usually people with odd \nnames here in the US usually fall under 1 of 2 categories:\n\n1. Children of wealthy parents (named Mercedes, etc.) who are well off \nenough that their name doesn't really impact their well being.\n\n2.

On a \nside note, the US has a lots of ethnicities and immigrants, but we don't \nreally, so it's natural that 99,9% of people here doesn't even want foreign \nor previously non-existent names for their babies, but happily choose from \nthe already used few hundred names without lamenting about the fact they \ntechnically don't have a free choice. Those who want to give something \ndifferent are most likely allowed to do so because of their citizenship. Or \nthey just wait for the approval if it sounds sane and if it's pronounciable \nby the first look. (I saw some silly ones already allowed, so it's not like \nyou can't name your baby girl a pretty sounding foreign name if you want \nto...)\n\nI presume we cannot compare the naming practices of certain countries, \nespecially not if one of them is the US. We probably need that \n\"nationalism\" or \"patriotism\" or whatever you might call it, which is \nimplied by using Hungarian names for Hungarian kids. (That's a long story, \nbut we as a nation imho really need more self-confidence after the \ncommunist rule. Which would be funny with folks with French or Dutch or \nAmerican names running around.)\n\nI see your point of the totalitarian aspect, but it's not unusual, if you \nlook at Japan, even naturalized foreigners have to adopt a Japanese name \n(written with those moon runes) as a legal name. Naturally, all Japanese \nare given Japanese names, and afaik this is the law there. And they neither \nlet embarrassing names or names with bad implications pass.",
