                "text": "This is madness.\nI'm 28 and have been married to my husband for 2 years (been together for 6 \nyears). I told him from the moment that our relationship became serious \nthat children would be a deal breaker but happily we are on the same page. \nNo plans for kids now or ever. :)\nI decided around high school in my mid-late teens that I didn't want to \nhave children. It's difficult to proclaim you decision let alone stand \nbehind it when everyone is undermining your choice not to have them with \nsuch phrases as, \"Oh you'll change your mind\", \"Oh you're young, you have \nplenty of time\", \"Wait til you get older, you will regret it\". It makes you \nwonder, will I regret not having kids? Am I really missing out?\nMuch of society expects a person to go to school, get a job, get married, \nhave kids. I wrestled with this because of society's (and my small town's) \nview being the expectation to have kids and if you don't then that must \nmean: you are a selfish person who will be lonely with no one to take care \nof you.\nIt drives me crazy when people say such awful things that are actually much \nmore selfish. People are proclaiming you are selfish when you do not want \nto reproduce. That never made sense to me. Isn't it more selfish to have \nchildren for retirement or to combat loneliness?  If they're afraid of \nbeing lonely or that they need someone to take care of them when they're \nold then maybe they should be producing better retirement plans vs possible \nretirement child. There's never a guarantee that your needs will be met by \nyour children (nor should that be asked of them) and if those are your \nreasons for having children (having a care taker and to have company) then \nyou shouldn't be having any.\nIf you do want to have a child then you give them everything you can and \nthe best of everything. It's about them now, many parts about you are put \naside. You're doing this to have someone to share your love, watch them \ngrow, share traditions and want the best for them. It's not right to expect \nanything in return. That is not the reason you brought this child into this \nworld and this is a burden that shouldn't be expected of your child.\nI for one, do not like children. I find them annoying, time consuming, \ndirty, loud, expensive, rude, greedy, exhausting, and sure, they're kids! \nThat's normal! What do you expect? I don't want the responsibility or the \ncommitment because I just know the pros do not outweigh the cons when it \ncomes to me having a child. I don't want my body destroyed just so I can \nbring a mini-me into the world. I have enough anxiety issues as it is. I \nlove my friends kids because I know them but only for short periods and I \ncan decide when to come and go. I like my life. I like to spend my money, \nuse my time and make plans based on myself and my husband. Not a kid. \nIt's frustrating when people seem shocked or judge or ask why? First, how \nrude of you to ask! What if I can't have children? Thanks a lot for \npointing that out. Secondly, what's it matter to you? Are you going to \nraise it? The annoyance and ignorance just continues. Children give your \nlife meaning! No, children give YOUR life meaning. Why don't you want \nchildren? Um, why DO you want children? You don't know love til you have a \nchild! I'm fine with that. I have the love of my husband, my friends, my \nparents, my furbabies and many others in my life to make me feel love and \nbe loved. You'll want kids when you find the right man! Excuse me? My \nhusband makes me plenty happy and vice versa, I don't need children to \nvalidate this. You're being selfish and you will regret it one day! Not \nlikely. Women are meant to be mothers, the world depends on it! There are 7 \nbillion people on the planet, estimated 9 billion by the end of my \ngeneration. Mine won't be noticed, let alone missed. This day and age sure \nseems pretty scary to bring someone you love into the midst of it.\nWhen asked \"when or if\" my husband and I are having children we simply say \nno. The backlash and the shock was hard to deal with but I'm working in a \nmuch bigger city where the majority of my coworkers seem to be more on my \nwave of thinking. I have the added benefit of having a husband who shares \nmy ideals and my parents are not the type to be hounding for grandchildren. \nThey think it is a marvelous decision and they agree that not having \nchildren can lead to a life that can be just as rewarding.\nI lead a very happy and fulfilled life with my furbabies and my husband (we \nhave 6 kitties and a greyhound), I am much more comfortable and confident \nin proclaiming my decision than I did in my early 20's. It is really no \none's business and they should not question how I wish to lead my life. I \nchoose to be child-free and I relish it.\ufeff",

All \nof the things that people have said to you about having or not having \nchildren, I have heard a million times. As a child, I didn't play with baby \ndolls, I liked barbies. I loved playing as an independent, carefree woman \nwith her own house, own car, and own life. I had no interest in pretending \nto be a mother. Obviously at 7, I didn't know what any of that meant, but \nin hindsight, I realize it was natural to me from the start. I don't want \nchildren. I never have. I never will. I get almost physically sick when \npeople tell me \"I'll change my mind\" and \"hurry before it's too late.\". I \nthink a lot of people with children have a secret resentment of people who \ndon't have them. They envy your freedom, and try to guilt trip you by \ntelling you you're selfish. I love that I can plan a spontaneous getaway \nwithout worrying about who will take the kids or worrying about them while \nI'm supposed to be relaxing on vacation. I love having a quiet house, with \ndelicate glass, candles, and art. I love my huge perfume collection. I love \nmaking love anywhere in the house, any time of the day, without having to \nbe quiet or have a \"sex schedule\". When I'm sick, I can stay in bed all day \nand *rest*. Those are just a few among so many other pros. I have lost out \non some seriously nice guys because I don't want children. However, I have \nstood by my decision, and refused to give in. Yes, it has lead to some \nheartbreak, but I know what I want. Sometimes I do wonder if I will ever \nfind a man who would be on the same page as me about this issue. I'm 30, \nand finding a guy who isn't a manwhore or ready to start a family is a \nchallenge. I hope I can find someone who thinks as I do, and I'm really \nhappy for you!",
