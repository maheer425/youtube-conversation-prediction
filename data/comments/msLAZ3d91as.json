Throughout his life, he was shunned by his community for not \nlooking like the typical  Asian. When the Communist party won control in \nChina, he moved to Vietnam where the same thing happened. Nobody in \nVietnam, except one family, would give my grandfather an opportunity to \nwork or buy things from them. When the communist invaded Vietnam, my \ngrandfather and my father moved to South Korea for a better life. Although \nthey weren't as shunned or looked down upon, they were still picked on for \ntheir tall nose, green eyes, slim face, double eyelid, and other things \nthat made them an anomaly. My father looks like a paler, taller, and more \nEuropean version of Lee Min Ho, but always got beaten/picked on by the home \nroom teacher for petty things back in the 80s. It wasn't until they moved \nto America while my dad was still in High School that these notions started \nto change. The features which my family was looked down upon for are now \nconsidered beautiful. I'm just amazed how drastic things have become in \njust a couple of decades. \n\nAs for what EYK said, I can see how some people have plastic surgery in \nKorea to increase their chances of getting jobs. Getting jobs in Korea is \nvery competitive. If you're looking for a midrange to high tier job, most \ncompanies look at appearances too. My dad was able to pay through college \nby modeling for Calvin Klein before becoming an accountant. He would \nprobably get a job over an average looking person in South Korea even if \nthey are a little bit more qualified. I don't mean any harm from that \nstatement. That's just how it works. I will never know how they feel \nbecause I was blessed with the features that Koreans will consider \nbeautiful, but I understand where they're coming from. If getting Plastic \nSurgery allows Koreans to stay competitive in the work place and be happy \nwith themselves, then why not?\ufeff",

They said they lost weight or some such nonsense. And it happens \nso often and so many people do it that they justify it they way you just \ndid. I'll never forget one particular conversation with a korean girl I had \nabout eye surgery where she and her friends were dead set against calling \ngetting double eyelids and making her eyes bigger PS. I was like huh? And \nshe said to me, in beautiful english, well in korea that's not really \nsurgery it's just a little tuck. I was like okayyyyyyyyyyy. That wasn't the \nfirst time I'd heard something similar but no one ever said it quite like \nthat to me before. And it wouldn't be the last time I assure you. Even in \nKpop, ms go hara said very much the same thing, about tucking and nipping \nher face and then said it wasn't really PS. Again she wasn't the first idol \nto say such a thing. Many idols have said how their companies gave them \n\"presents\" before they debut. And some had their presents after debut. When \npeople argue about obvious and then say oh well you're wrong because so and \nso....One fan the other day, argued until I gave up about park bom's face. \nAnd I was like honey, sweetheart, I don't know what to do with that level \nof delusion. But 500 clinics in JUST one strip of street(forgetting the \nmany others in the city) doesn't stay open on foreigners they stay open \nbecause of their main korean base. I understand a lot of people go to korea \nfor surgery but they don't even make up half the people that korean \nsurgeons see a year. That still makes for a massive amount of koreans based \non their population who have surgery. And with that in mind, I can't for \nthe life of me judge people who think what they do about koreans and \nsurgery.Because I understand why they've come to such conclusions. It's not \nthat far a leap but it is a leap. I just think they shouldn't generalize it \nby saying all korean's have had surgery. A korean woman/man can be pretty \nand not have had surgery.  ",

I see many Chinese, Japanese and SE \nAsian people coming to Korea for surgery as well.  And the attitude is that \nit's a very much hush.

                "text": "Hi :)\nI'm 13, Korean ,born in america and raised in the U.K.\nI live a happy life in the U.K with my four brothers but my parents live in \nKorea. I need help. Next year I need to make one of the biggest decision in \nmy life. I don't want to leave the U.K but I have to. I have two choices. I \ncan move to Korea or America. \nKorea\nI go to Korea every summer I love it.My family live there they have such \ncute stuff and i just love the whole country ....but i love education. i \ndon't like the way Korean schools run. they don't teach the  important \nthings. No  one knows what to do when they see bulling. no one knows were \nto go to when they have a problem (I'm not saying this for all schools ) \nthey don't except homosexuality. And to be excepted in society you must fit \na certain mold. People do it the extreme to  fit this mold. There not ugly \nsociety is. I'm only 13 i think you should be excepted as who you are. Have \na self confidence boost and realize that everyone is beautiful <3. But i \nhave a fear that at this young age if I move to Korea. i could be \nbrainwashed into thinking we have to be stick thin, have to have \nunnecessary surgery , starve myself ....i love food. .  I try my best in \neverything i do. even though i can speak and understand Korean well. i wont \nbe able to meet the high standards Korea  expects from someone my age. If i \ndo my best that's all i care about. But in Korea that's in the bin. It all \nabout the test results.\nU.S.A\nEven though i was only born in the U.S.A I have never lived there. But I \nknow I would love it. I would do better at school and make new friends \nquicker.The schools are great.  I told my friends  I want to move to the \nUSA. but my friends were shocked. Telling my that the USA is dangerous. but \nAmerica is beautiful. I just want to know if american schools are like the \nfilms. and if Korean schools are like that. I really am open to any \nsuggestions . I'm so stuck. Thank you if you actually read all of this , \nand have a nice day  <3 :)\ufeff",

The \"nose job\" or reshaping/reducing size of her \nnose is plastic surgery. The surgery on the INSIDE of her nose was done for \nmedical reasons. So yes, you could say that she only got the nose job \nbecause she was already going under the knife to fix the internal problems, \nbut the nose job itself was completely voluntary and not necessary for \nmedical purposes.\n\nMy brother had to have sinus surgery this past year because of the same \nreasons as Minzy (although possibly more. he had a deviated septum, and \npolyps in his sinuses) -- but he didn't elect to have a nose job. Just the \nnecessary medical work. Sure, they had to reconstruct the entire inside of \nhis nose, but in the end, his nose bridge merely looks a bit straighter -- \nit's still his nose. Minzy had plastic surgery done ON TOP OF the sinus \nsurgery. That's why her nose looks completely different -- size, shape, \neverything. Sinus surgery only affects the septum up -- it does not include \nthe bottom portion of the nose or the skin.\n\nPerhaps it's an issue of semantics, but Minzy did not have plastic surgery \nfor medical reasons. She had medical surgery for medical reasons. She had \nplastic surgery for cosmetic reasons.",

The only time surgery is performed for rhinitis is when polyps \nare formed during a very severe case. The polyps may obstruct breathing. \nEven if polyps are present, they can be reduced and possibly even disappear \ncompletely with the help of a specific nasal spray (aka no surgery needed). \nIf the polyps are huge, then surgery is performed. During surgery, the \npolyps are removed and the goal is to preserve the tissue and functions of \nthe nose. The shape of a person's nose really has nothing to do with it \nfrom what I understand.  It is possible that her doctor said that to get a \nlittle extra money. These kinds of things aren't unheard of, but knowing a \nlittle about rhinitis is what makes me think its an excuse for \nreconstructive surgery and not the reason. I don't think the caption was \nharsh. Before Minzy owned up to it, her fans were defending and denying \nthat she had plastic surgery by saying she lost weight or that she just got \nprettier since she turned a year older. S & M were just mimicking what the \nnetizens were saying. Minzy said \"Then my mother suggested that while I'm \nfixing my crooked nose, I should receive cosmetic surgery as well. That's \nwhy it took even longer for me to decide.\" ",

Koreans all having plastic surgery. \nTaiwanese and Japanese, and also Chinese are making huge rumors which is \nsimply offensive for ordinary Koreans to bear. About the plastic sugery, \nyou have to look at the facts. Most of celebrities, of course they often \noften undergoes the surgery, that's common knowledge.Here is the real 2009 \nstatistics \nhttp://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=wlsud300&logNo=10040831209 The \nnumber of plastic sugery, 1st USA, 4th Japan, 14th Taiwan(population is \neven smaller than Korea), 15th S. Korea. Now since every country has \ndifferent population, rates per capital, 6th Hong Kong, 13th Taiwan, 18th \nJapan, South Korea, it is 27th. Which means every 100 people, Hong Kong, \nTaiwan, Japan has more people who have plastic surgery than S. Korea.\ufeff",

My first possible explanation \nis that Korea is essentially a very conformist culture and individualism \nisn't necessarily celebrated as it is in places like North America. Korea \nhas a very one-dimensional view of what features are considered beautiful, \nfor instance, a thin & high bridged nose, a small face, a chiseled jaw and \npointy chin, pale skin, etc. Whereas in North America, the mentality is \nvery different, like Martina pointed out. So because of this \none-dimensional view of beauty, everyone strives to basically have the same \nfeatures because those features are considered more beautiful. Which is \nprobably another reason why plastic surgery is so popular, since not \neveryone could possibly have the same features.. AH I could go on and \non.... i should make a video about this as well lol. \ufeff",

But I dislike the girls who get it then change who they are. \nInstead of confidence it's cockyness ect.\n\nPS can make you comfortable in your own skin and make you feel confident. I \nmean it's alot like make up in a way just more permanent. However I just \ndon't care for girls who get the same things done.

Correct me on this if I'm wrong but I \ncan't think of any other country that is as specific as Korea when it comes \nto what is beautiful. In korea you must have big eyes, double eyelids, fair \nskin, V-line jaw, small face, tall nose, small lips, long legs, very skinny \nbody with S lines and X lines (which in my opinion don't look like curves \nat all) and a youthful complexion.
