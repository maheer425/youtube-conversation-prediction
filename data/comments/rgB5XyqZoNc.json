Because \ngoddamn, you're an idiot.\n\nFirst off, YOU were the one screaming weird shit at me just because you \ndidn't agree with my way of thinking. You started off with ''abortion is \nmurder!!!!!'' which isn't true, and because you couldn't deal with my \non-facts-based response you thought it was a good idea to act like some \nradical 'feminist'. And somehow you actually believe you made some kind of \npoint? Hahahaha for crying out loud.\n\nWhat you said about ''everyone is 'bisexual' in college'' is just \ncompletely wrong and patronizing. 'Bisexuality' as in it isn't real, was \nthat what you're trying to say? Is my sexuality not real because, hearing \nyou, it's just a silly college thing? Dear lord what's next?! You're gonna \ntell me gay people don't exist either? I should probably call my girlfriend \nup and hope she didn't suddenly disappear\n\nAnd I don't know HOW the actual fuck you turned this into a discussion \nabout feminism, but yes, it's still legitimate. Since you're too stupid to \nunderstand, I'll give you some simple reasons:\n- 12-year-old girls get raped and then BLAMED for it because they were \nwearing something that showed skin.\n- Because in America a fetus is more important than an actual human being. \n- In schools girls get send home because they are wearing shorts, while \nboys walk around with their pants hanging from their asses. Apparently \ntheir education is more important.\n- Rape itself is a reason why feminism is still legitimate. Whether I'm \nwearing a hoodie or a croptop, if you force me into having sex THAT IS NOT \nMY FAULT IN ANY WAY.\n- Because men get raped too, and then get told by other men that they \n''should have enjoyed it''.\n- Because feminism is also for men. It's for equality.\n- Because women get catcalled daily on the streets, stuff like ''nice \nasssss'' by men we don't know, which makes us scared for our life if \nthere's no one else around. And then we get told to see it as a compliment.\n- Because boys can't play with dolls and girls can't play with cars.\n- Because women get killed for saying ''no'' to a man. Google it. I dare \nyou, fucking google that. Women get killed because they don't want to go on \ndates, or have sex, with disgusting pricks. \n- BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING THIS DISCUSSION..\n\nThat's it, I'm done, and I slammed every bullshitted argument of yours to \nthe ground. So please, suck it up and go complain about feminism somewhere \nelse. I don't want your useless ass anywhere near my comments.",

                "text": "These are amazing people, I'm mortified that more of you don't think so, \nalthough I shouldn't be surprised with the lack of compassion and open \nmindedness I see here. SHE IS NOT A SELFISH MOTHER, SHE DID NOTHING WRONG. \nAnyone who says different is the one who is very wrong, how dare you judge \nthe decisions between her and her husband, it is their life and they are \nnot harming anyone or causing any trouble, they are probably contributing \nto society a lot more than most of these trolls on youtube. Some say people \nwith disabilities take our taxes, well I'd happily give my money to help \nsomeone who was born less fortunate, but this family is taking no one's \nmoney, she is working as a teacher, she is earning her living just like \neveryone else. Yes she knew that her child could possibly be born with her \ncondition but the doctor didn't say for sure, they could have had a \nperfectly \"normal\" baby, I hate to use that term because in my opinion \nthere is no normal, everyone is different and unique and beautiful, but \nanyways they could have had a baby with arms or without, they didn't know, \nthat does not mean they shouldn't have children. There is always the chance \nthat two people without disabilities could have a child with disabilities, \nso if they logic is that if their is a chance that the baby could be \ndisabled the couple should not reproduce, than no one should reproduce. \nTheir are more people carelessly having sex with anyone and getting \npregnant then being ignorant during their pregnancy and causing the baby to \nhave issues like fetal alcohol syndrome or to be born with AIDS, these are \nthe people who shouldn't have sex. That is why even if eugenics takes over \nand everyone currently alive with disabilities is hindered from \nreproducing, it will not stop because of all the idiots out there. I \ncommend her for keeping her child, and giving him a chance at life, he is \nhappy and doing well, for those feeling sorry for them and hoping for \n\"peace\" and \"joy\" stop! Those things are great but it seemed to me that \nthey are very peaceful and joyful, they're like any other family. Also we \nwill NEVER HAVE A PERFECT SOCIETY, even if all diseases and disabilities \nare wiped out there still will be greed, pride, slander, crime, cold \nheartedness, rudeness, ignorance and so many qualities that are diseases of \nthe heart, and with these we will never be all we could be. Above I said I \nthink everyone's beautiful, they only thing that makes a person not \nbeautiful is their personality, being a evil, mean, person is the worst \ndefect of all and that is what we need less of, we need more people like \nthis family in the video. Lastly all eugenics does is kill, destroy and \nbreed a false sense of superiority, we are no better than anyone who was \nborn less fortunate they deserve to live, maybe the people who want to wipe \nthem out don't. For once put yourself in someone else's shoes. I know this \nis insanely long but I make no apologies, even if no one reads this, which \nis what is most probable, I'm just glad I got this off my chest.\ufeff",

There's \nnothing wrong with my opinion, whatsoever, and at the moment, the amount of \ncomments are only exceeded by the amount of likes, in agreement to my \n'opinion' . There's only going to be 2 ways to look at this.. Either you \nbelieve this lady put 'her' personal desires to have a child, even if it's \ntrue that she's states that without her husband, \"she doesn't know what she \nwould do\".. and can surely be classified as someone who just barely is able \nto support herself outside of the home, and if she considered the life this \nchild is going to endure, which she 'knows' all to well I'm sure, I think \nthe 'responsible less selfish thing to do would be to forgo having children \nin light of the fact, that in the end, she also states that \"she hopes, \nthat 'he' is as fortunate as 'she' was, in finding someone as supportive \nand self sacrificing as her husband.. Yeah, he's somethin, alright! lol. \nBut, having only 'hopes' to ride on, is not very responsible decision \nmaking at all.. especially here! I'm thinking of the child, is that not \ngood enough?",

Plus how can be people be like \"Oh you \npoor thing you have no arms but you are a bitch for having a child\" they \nare basically saying that because she doesn't have arms she has no right to \nhave her own child. Maybe she wanted the feeling of giving life to a new \nhuman so what she can't have that feeling because she has no arms? There \nalready a lot of things she can't possibly do but giving birth is not one \nof them. That is a      big problem because people think \"oh that poor \nthing doesn't have arms (or something else) that means you will never have \na normal life, no wife( or husband) and no children\" and other people not \nviewing people with disabilities as a potential partner. And here people \nare even worse because they are saying that she is a whore (which I don't \nget because I don't think she is a prostitute) for having a family like \neveryone else. It is unfortunate that her child doesn't have arms but she \ndidn't mean for that to happen",

The human body has a default specification. \nAnything which fails to meet that specification due to mutated or damaged \ngenes, is by definition defective. The issue is not the word \"defective\" \nbut whether you associate a negative connotation to it for the purposes of \ndiscrimination or ridicule. This young man looks like a delightful child, \nbut the fact is, his mother's selfishness has created a needless burden \nthat society will have to pick up.\n \nAny society has to perform resource triage on a daily basis. Wilfully \nbringing a child into this world who will demand a significantly \ndisproportionate share of already stretched resources is selfish. Had it \nbeen my choice, I would have prevented her from that opportunity.",
