Again I feel like its just really dry to watch \nnow, and I will bet that most people will be able to find fun in those \nsituations like movies such as Zombieland. I understand loss and dire \nsituations make people depressed and serious but humour and light hearted \nconversations are usually a persons go to nature in order to cope with \nthings like death or danger. The whole group is lucky to be alive and \nrather than appreciate it and try to live everyday like their last  they \nall bitch and moan ho hum,, ho hah, blah blah . I used to love the walking \ndead and I also loved its mature tone and take on the zombie apocalypse.. \nTheir is still evidently major holes in character depth, and also the plot \nseems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for DIRE situations.\" A \n disease killing off and infecting randoms in the jail turns the show on \nits head\" Another problem with the show is it clearly is only adding new \ncharacters now just to kill them off 3 episodes later. Seriously when I \nstarted it I thought the show would be a lot better than what it has \nbecome. I introduced it to all my friends and family and they still watch \nthe shit out of it. Me I just cant any more.for these reasons and a couple \nmore.",

They are trying to survive the apocalypse, while \nfighting human beings. In real life it wouldn't be like Zombieland. By this \ntime in the show, everyone has lost someone dear to them, so they won't be \nthe same people before the apocalypse started. Plus they are always killing \nzombies.

ALL the \ncharacters are dry and seem like depressed robots. No one is even likeable \nany more not even Glenn and Maggie and  I get its an apocalypse and shit is \ndire, but fuck sakes joke around a bit, make memories, do some fun shit \n try to crack a smile, or else what's the point of even being alive in that \nsituation TO SURVIVE? That may be the primal definition of survival but its \na proven fact that people cant live that way. One movie to take a page from \nis Zombieland it may be an extreme but that's how I truly see most people \nacting in a world of the infected \"enjoy the little things\"",

With films they have the \nluxury of the actual actor, who will say their lines over again in a sound \nrecording studio, almost exactly the same way they said it when they were \non set filming. They have the luxury of going back and watching the footage \nto make sure an actor says it the exact same way. And they have the luxury \nof getting an actor to give multiple takes if they need to. In the case of \nthe Bad Lip Reading videos, some of the techniques used are the same when \nit comes to the editing, but the process in which it gets done, is still \nvery different and a lot more tedious. It's probably why there is \nincredibly long periods of time before they upload a new video. I'm sure \nthey go through hundreds of hours worth of footage, trying to find the \nperfect clips. There's lots of L cutting to mask certain parts of the \nvideo. And then there is the actual syncing process which I can imagine \ntakes another hundred hours or so of tweaking and fine tuning. Lets not \nforget the fact that they have to come up with clever stuff to say for all \nof these clips. ADR with films is reciting lines that are scripted and \nfilmed already.",

Not saying it's bad just that the plot hit a loop at \nsome point in season 3 making it kinda boring. I prefer a smart plot like \nSupernatural, in my opinion Walking Dead should have got better writers \nlike the ones that do Supernatural. Don't even know if TWD even with better \nwriters could have keep't me watching.\ufeff",
