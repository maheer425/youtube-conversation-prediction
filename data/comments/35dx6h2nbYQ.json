                    "text": "+arber beqa Yea man im from 99' and it was my first year playing football \nin an academy (still is) when they spotted me and got me in the team.\nThe whole concept of CIF is to build players for the big teams to buy since \nwe have no professional team in the Liga 1 (first portuguese league) but we \nare known as one of the best teams in the U-17 bracket.\nScouts really like players that are strong and fast, simply because if you \nare fit it means you care about your good shape, and technique is something \nthat can be tought.\nIf you are healthy and are sure that your dream is to become a professional \nfootball player, go for it! If you are sure you could be spotted by scouts, \nI would recommend starting on an academy where u have to pay (it's usually \nnot a lot) and you will get spotted quickly. If you are not very confident \nabout your strenght and agility with the ball, maybe you should start by \ntraining by yourself in the street somewhere where u can practice to master \nthe ball (there are a lot of guides on youtube of exercises to help you \nwith ball control). \nI hope I helped somehow, and it's never too late to start!",
