You will have to watch the nitrates and make sure to keep them \naround 10 or less if you want them to grow quickly.  Anemones really don't \nlike nitrates past 15-20.  If you have macro algae incorporated into the \nsystem it can help reduce the frequency for water changes.  I personally \nwould rather plan adequate filtration and run a sump than fork out the \nextra in the long term on salt mix.  With a good balance you could easily \nget away with monthly water changes just to freshen up the elements.  Some \npeople can go longer as long as that balance is achieved.  I do weekly \nwater changes on my zeovit reef tank; however my 30 gallon tank loaded with \nmacro algae and no corals I rarely need to do a water change (every 3-4 \nmonths) because of the plants ability to keep the water clean.  In that \ncase I drip kalk top off and maintain iodine and iron levels through other \nproducts.",
