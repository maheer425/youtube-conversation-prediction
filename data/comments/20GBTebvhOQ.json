Why don't you produce a track with a catchy riff, a \nclear mix, a good master and make it all fit together perfectly.\n\nMy point is that electronic music DOES require talent, saying something is \nelectronically made DOES NOT void it of talent nor does making it \nelectronically inherently make it trashy.\n\nMy challenge for you is to make a good track with a good arrange, clear \nmix, running time 5+ mins without getting stale along with being in the \nright key (you can decide that) and a tempo applicable to the genres you \njust mentioned (EDM Dubstep and electro)\n\nSince you claim it's so talentless it shouldn't be a problem.",

This genocide of the Jewish \npeople was the Third Reich's \"Final Solution to the Jewish question\". The \nNazi attempts at Jewish genocide are now collectively known as the \nHolocaust.\n\nAlthough not responsible for an extermination camp death count of millions \nlike that the Nazis perpetrated, the fascist Usta\u0161e forces of the \nIndependent State of Croatia operated extermination camps culminating in a \nsix figure death toll.\n\nbasically, jews were told they were gonna take a shower, put into chambers \nwhere the chambers would be filled with a poisonous gas and kill anyone \ninside. In turn, by the end of the halocaust, about 12,000,000 people were \nkilled\n Thanks hitler\n(obvious sarcasm is obvious)",

This didn't always happen- some prisoners were \nkilled during scientific research doctors in the camp were conducting. For \nexample, finding out how long a human could go without food? Owe that to \nthem. They starved several prisoners and compiled the average times it took \nfor them to slowly die off. Others were just tortured to death for no \nreason, and others tortured because they'd rebelled in some way, shape or \nform.Basically, when Adolf asked Vader to step into his showers, he meant \ninto the secret gas chambers so that Vader would die.Also bonus, sorry if I \noffended someone with the above information, or if I triggered bad memories \nor reactions or whatever.
