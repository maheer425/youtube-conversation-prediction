                    "text": "+Stan Marsh +Derek Hale +Connor Nay  Electivire would most likely kill you. \nRaichu is less likely to kill you, but still could. However, they would \neach only be able to make one fatal attack per day. This is based on \nrealistic assumptions... I know that pokemon aren't really supposed to be \ngrounded in reality or they would be no fun. Anyway, explanations and \ncalculations are still included below:\n\nI'm going to assume that they both produce DC current like an electric eel. \nFor DC current, 500mA is needed for 3 seconds to cause heart failure. Refer \nto this chart: http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_3/4.html \n\nNow let's consider the power reserves that these pokemon would likely have. \nThe average human consumes 2000 calories a day. Since both pokemon are \npretty large, let us assume that their bodies also need ~2000 calories a \nday for basic functions. Now, let's also assume that they consume an extra \n8000 calories a day simply for the purpose of blowing shit up. This would \nmean they would need to eat as much as an Olympic swimmer per day, but \nwould have 33,494.4 Joules of energy that they could draw on for the big \nattack.\n\nNow according to our death chart, 500mA DC is needed for about 3 seconds to \nfinish off a human. Thanks to Georg Ohm, we know that Power = \nVoltage*Current. Before making this calculation, consider that the power in \nwatts will be Joules divided by 3 seconds, or 11,164.8 W (since power = \nenergy/time). This means that Raichu could hold 111mA for 3 seconds \nand Electivire could maintain 558mA for 3 seconds (if they used all their \ndaily energy at once). So the answer is probably for Electivire and maybe \nfor Raichu.\n\nYou may notice that Electivire, who produces less voltage ends up being \nmore deadly. This is because his lower voltage uses less power and allows \nfor a higher current than Raichu based on the power constraint. However, at \nthe very least, Raichu's 100,000 volts would hurt like a bitch and make \nyour muscles seize up.... it would probably be like a really horrible Tazer \n(Tazers work by delivering high voltages with low current). \n\nWhile 100,000 volts sounds impressive, these two animals would be more \ndangerous with lower voltages. Electric eels, for example, produce hundreds \nof volts (not hundreds of thousands) and could therefore produce currents \nwell over 1 Amp if they were in the air. The reason high voltage machines \non the power grid can so easily kill is that they do not have the same \npower restraints. Things hooked up the the power grid take as much current \nas they need to satisfy the equation Voltage = Current * Resistance (unless \na fuse or circuit breaker stops them to prevent wires from getting too \nhot). Since the resistance of the human body is 1,000 ohm, a 10,000 volt \nelectric fence would put 10 amps straight through your heart.\n\nHowever, these pokemon aren't wasting all that energy for nothing by having \nreally high voltages. High voltages are generally needed to allow \nelectricity to arc through the air. That gives these pokemon the cool long \nrange lightning strike capabilities. But if they worked as short range \nfighters and punched people right in the hearts with a low voltage/ high \ncurrent strike, they could probably kill hundreds of humans per day. \nEspecially if they could generate a high frequency AC current instead of \nDC, which some electric fish can do.\n\nAnyway, feel free to check my calculations and stuff.\n\nLove, an electrical engineering student.

If Magikarp somehow Bounced on someone's \nhead I bet it would be hard enough to knock them out or break someone's \nskull. Any pokemon that can learn hydro pump can break your bones, which \ninclude psyduck, froakie, and frogadier. Wooper can use earthquake, thus \nwell pretty much kill any human naturally if the drop was big enough, or \nuse muddy water to drown someone, also Im pretty sure it's purple branches \nare poisonous. Any pokemon that can learn solar beam can incinerate a human \nbeing, since well solar beam is a laser that is over 6739 degrees \nfahrenheit, so cottonee and petillil can kill you. Carbink well can smash \nyour head in with it's rock body or use stone edge or rock slide to crush \nit. Fenekin, well that one is obvious, I mean all fire types are walking \nflamethrowers regardless if it's the 1st form.
