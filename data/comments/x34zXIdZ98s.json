                    "text": "Islam teaches its followers to be merciful to all creatures, and all form \nof animal cruelty is forbidden. Why then, do many Muslims seems to have \nsuch a problem with dogs?\n\nUnclean\n\nMost Muslim scholars agree that the saliva of a dog is ritually impure, and \nthat contact with a dog's saliva requires one to wash seven times. This \nruling comes from the hadith:\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"If a dog licks the vessel of any one \nof you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times.\" \n(Reported by Muslim)\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that one of the major Islamic schools of \nthought (Maliki) indicates that its not a matter of ritual cleanliness, but \nsimply a common-sense method way to prevent the spread of disease.\nThere are several other hadith, however, which warn of consequences for \ndog-owners:\n\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds \nwill decrease every day by one qeeraat (a unit of measurement), unless it \nis a dog for farming or herding.\" In another report, it is said: \"... \nunless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting.\" (Reported by \nal-Bukhaari)\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Angels do not enter a house wherein \nthere is a dog or an animate picture.\" (Reported by Bukhari)\nMany Muslims base the prohibition against keeping a dog in one's home, \nexcept for the case of working or service dogs, on these traditions.\n\n\nCompanion Animals\n\nOther Muslims argue that dogs are loyal creatures that are deserving of our \ncare and companionship. They cite the story in the Quran (Surah 18) about a \ngroup of believers who sought shelter in a cave and were protected by their \ncanine companion who was \"outstretched in their midst.\"\n\nAlso in the Quran, it is specifically mentioned that any prey caught by \nhunting dogs may be eaten -- without any need for further purification. \nNaturally, the prey of a hunting dog comes into contact with the saliva of \nthe dog; however this does not render the meat \"impure.\"\n\n\"They consult you concerning what is lawful for them; say, Lawful for you \nare all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you. \nYou train them according God's teachings. You may eat what they catch for \nyou, and mention God's name thereupon. You shall observe God. God is most \nefficient in reckoning.\" -Quran 5:4\nThere are also stories in Islamic tradition that tell of people who were \nforgiven their past sins through the mercy they showed towards a dog.\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, \nbecause, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was \nabout to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her \nhead-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of \nthat.\"\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"A man felt very thirsty while he was \non the way, there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched \nhis thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud \nbecause of excessive thirst. He said to himself, \"This dog is suffering \nfrom thirst as I did.\" So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe \nwith water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. \n(Reported by Bukhari)\nIn another point of Islamic history, the Muslim army came across a female \ndog and her puppies while on a march. The Prophet, peace be upon him, \nposted a soldier nearby her with the orders that the mother and puppies \nmust not be disturbed.\nBased on these teachings, many people find that it is a matter of faith to \nbe kind towards dogs, and that dogs can even be beneficial in the lives of \nhuman beings. Service animals, such as guide dogs or epilepsy dogs, are \nimportant companions to Muslims with disabilities. Working animals, such as \nguard dogs, hunting or herding dogs are useful and hard-working animals who \nhave earned their place at their owner's side.\n\n:)",

                    "text": "Hi6867, I have read a translation of your Quran by Abdullah Yusuf Ali and \nam currently on my 3rd attempt.  Doesn't the Quran say that Allah guides \nAND MISGUIDES?  Doesn't the Quran say that Allah intentionally seals the \nhearts, minds, eyes, and ears of those who disbelieve?  I don't think I've \nmisread anything, to be honest.  The Quran is an unorganized, repetitive, \nfear-mongering, ambiguous, and context-free book that INCITES hostility and \nhatred of non-Muslims.  Isn't it a doctrine of Islam to hate and love what \nAllah both loves and hates?  \n\nI've known quite a few Muslims growing up and through college, and every \nsingle one of them were people that behaved as if you can never be \ntrusted.  Doesn't Allah say to not befriend or be allies with Jews and \nChristians or that anyone that imitates them is one of them?  Islam doesn't \npromote the co-existence of people, which is exactly why I call it a \nsupremacist religion.  Muslims are constantly told they are the best of \npeople, while Allah insults and degrades non-Muslims.  What kind of \nattitude do you think Muslims are expected to have towards non-Muslims with \nthe constant verbal abuse against them?  I do not believe for a second that \na Muslim is taught that he is equal to a non-Muslim.  Non-Muslims aren't \neven considered humans in some cases.  What do you think \"beneath creation\" \nimplies?\n\nIs it okay for a Muslim woman to marry a Jew or Christian?  It's so clear \nfrom the context of the Quran that the provision for males to marry Jews \nand Christians is because it's one way to guarantee their offspring are \nMuslim as the child will carry the father's name and because the Muslims \nwere in constant battles with Jewish and Christian groups where women were \nwidowed, taken as sex slaves, or wives.  Muhammad married many women from \nenemy tribes with some accounts making it seem like these women flung \nthemselves towards him (yeah right) after he murdered their husbands or had \nthem killed.\n\nNow I am subscribed to many youtube channels hosted by Muslims and the \nfacebook pages of them; the most popular ones.  I wanted to get a feel for \nwhat Muslims were being taught.  Just looking at the postings and the \nvideos is enough for me to confirm everything I said above.  Islamic da'wah \nis so sinister, misleading, and insulting.  It's so abundantly clear that \nda'wah is not about Islamic truth, but the \"falsehood\" of other religions.  \nMuslims REALLY have a problem with Christianity and Christians.  Another \nperson here said that da'wah means to invite.  Well you don't invite a \nguest only to insult him.  This is exactly what da'wah has become.  In one \nvideo produced by the London Da'wah Movement, one of the da'ees was talking \nabout aid to Africa and how Christians have dominated that.  His number one \nconcern wasn't that fact that there were poor, sick, or hungry people in \nAfrica, but that they would die praticing shirk like the Christians.  Are \nyou kidding me?  Is this a competition to you guys?  Are you this insecure \nwith your religion?  Do you all suffer this inferiority complex?\n\nI've seen and heard enough to finally understand what Islam is.  I can no \nlonger trust Muslims. ",

                    "text": "+jay shawn This is an absolutely ridiculous assessment of Muslims and \nIslam. You clearly do not know anyone Muslim, and are taking phrases \ncompletely out of context. If you have actually read the Quran in it's \nentirety, which I doubt you have, you should know that coercion is strictly \nprohibited in Islam. The Quran says to read, reflect and think and to make \nup your own mind about what you believe.\n\nIf we are so \"against\" Christians & Jews, why is allowed under Muslim law, \nand the Quran for a man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman,\"people of the \nbook\". We are not taught to hate anyone or think anyone is beneath us. We \nare taught that all people are equal, and all people should be respected \nand treated kindly despite whatever they believe. This is why at Hajj \npeople from all walks or life, and ethnic and social backgrounds gather; \nwhere a Queen stands next to someone with next to nothing. \n\nAnd God does not call himself the greatest deceivers EVER, in the Quran you \nare completely misquoting it. He calls himself the greatest planners ONLY. \nThis is especially pertinent when  things are going wrong and you don't \nunderstand why. The Islamic teaching is that if you are patient you will \nlearn why; that God's plan and will for you is better for you, then \nanything you could ever imagine for yourself. In my case, I was born with \nan illness - and didn't understand why throughout my youth. As an adult, I \nsee the fruits of what going through all that difficulty bore, and all the \ngood that has come out of it, and it makes sense to me now. This is an \nexample, of what he means by being the greatest planner. And to re-iterate \nthat Quran never says he is the greatest deceiver, that is straight from \nsome propaganda website/or made up. No Quranic translation says that. \n\nAnd lastly, these videos were made for Muslims to understand the life of \nthe prophet better, and were filmed and started during Ramadan not for \npropoganda purposes???......Do other religions not have \"professional\" \nvideos? and ask to donate to the cause? I'm pretty sue Mitt Romney gave a \nsignificant chunk of his income to the Mormon church, as do people of other \nfaiths....",
