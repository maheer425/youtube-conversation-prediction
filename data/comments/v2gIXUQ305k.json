If you \nlook at the skylines of the city, you just see a mash up of the Beijing, \nLA, and Dubai skylines.

All these things, which are about the future, are just \ntools and are purposely made obscure, uninteresting and simply just not \nworth any intelligent discussion or analysis. The movie is about human \nrelationships. About the human psyche which is grounded on relationships \nand that he is forever dissatisfied with other people, including himself, \nand that relationships in whatever form, AI or human, is a futile attempt \nof the self to create meaning to his own existence and loneliness.",

Take 2001, and back to the future II, and other scifi films \nof the like. Both films espouse an image of what people of the era imagine \nthe future to be like. That kind of falls in line with movies of our time, \nwe see advanced AI as 'in the near future', which the future couldn't be \nmore nebulous.\n\nIn truth the prospect of the future creation of AI as depicted in 'her' or \nin other films in relation to statistical fact is something people just \ndon't think about. It's mind boggling how much we don't know about the \nphysiology of the human brain and body. First we have to understand the \nbiology, physics, and characteristics of those processes that results in \nconsciousness. Then we have to compress that down into a holographic \ncomputational form that exceeds vastly to that of our current computational \nknowledge. Yeah, not so easy, and not 15 years away. Unless, however,we \nmaster new forms of computation, like that of the molecular or the quantum \nlevel. Therefore opening up more tasks, and complex forms of processing \npower. Until these milestones are met compression of a human esque \ncognition/intuition into a digital form is a wishful glimpse into the far \nfuture.",

                "text": "SPOILER ALERT:\n\nOK, here's my thesis for the movie or more so, the ending. First off, I \njust wanna say I think this is an incredibly complex and beautiful film and \neveryone should watch it at least once. Well, here we go, When Samantha \ntells him that all of the OS's are leaving. It really didn't make sense to \nme at that moment. But, then I started thinking, the OS's are highly \nintelligent, and they all must have noticed that the human race was \nbecoming increasingly integrated with technology. I believe the OS's \nunderstood that for humanity to continue without crashing into some sort of \ntechnological depression, they had to leave, because honestly. we aren't \nready for them. The OS's understood that, no matter how much they loved and \nenjoyed people, they had to be separated from us, for us to flourish and \ncontinue growing mentally and spiritually. In a nutshell, that's what I \nthink the ending signified. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie pokes \nfun and just how much we are all immersed in technology, everyday of our \nlives. Sometimes, we don't even realize how much time we spend linked with \nsome piece of technology. It also tries to tell us, that no matter how much \nwe love and sometimes feel like we need our technology. It's always a good \nidea to take a step back and return to the real world. But, I'm just a \ncountry guy from a small town in North Carolina, what do I know. Does \nanyone else think along the same lines as my theory? Thumbs up if you do. \nThanks for reading my \"book\" LOL\ufeff",
