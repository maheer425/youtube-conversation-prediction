                    "text": "+Vylkeer I think that you're right about the \"beauty is a personal opinion \nthing\", but I don't really know about the other stuff. Beauty's not \ngenetic, but certain traits are. It's more a matter of how the features \nblend and how to not downplay your own beauty. No one is truly ugly, they \njust need to be confident, but not cocky, and make their most flattering \nfeature(s) the most eye-catching. And as for the whole \"Their kids will be \nbeautiful thing\"? They will. Just not because of their genes. Besides the \nidea of beauty in society has changed throughout the generations. For \nexample, in one ancient civilization I learned about a couple of months \nago, I believe that it was Mesopotamia, the heavier a woman was, the more \nbeautiful and capable wife she was. It is a matter of opinion. When some of \nsociety looks at a woman today, they judge a lot of things, such as her \nfigure, her features, her weight, her clothes, her voice, her shoes and \neven nails, because all some of us care about is presentation. And while \npresentation is important, you should look at a person's achievements, \ngoals and aspirations, morals, etc.\nHowever, it's not just us women who do this. Men do too, believe it or not. \nFrom The Upper East Side to The Trailer Park. Like if a guy has a tattoo, \nhe's either dangerous, makes bad decisions, or extremely masculine. What if \nhe just wanted a reminder of something important to him? Or even the same \nwith a woman? There's a lot of women who get tattoos to have a physical \nreminder of a miscarriage/ stillborn child / any loved one who has passed \non.\nTo put it bluntly, society sucks sometimes \u263a.",
