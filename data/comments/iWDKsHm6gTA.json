                "text": "I think the Babel story is given a bit too much credence here. At the \nsupposed time of the biblical story, people already lived all over the \nworld and had languages that where different.\n\nIf all languages had a sudden (magical) split as the story tells, it would \nclearly be evident in the historical record. Even if all language had a \ncommon ground, it would have to be way earlier. The biblical account have \nno evidence to support it and quite a bit of evidence against it. So it \nshould not be insinuated that it \"might be true\". TED stop sneaking in \nmyths when you talk about science.\ufeff",

The point of the video is \nthat, while it is possible to understand which languages share a common \nancestor, it is not currently possible to trace them all back to a single \norigin. I would add that they probably do all have a common origin in \nAfrica, but there have been so many changes that their relationships have \nbecome blurred over time.\n\nMuch of evolutionary biology comes from linguistics. Biologists keep track \nof organisms' similarities and differences in morphology, behavior, \nproteins, and DNA, in much the same way that linguists keep track of \nsimilarities and differences in languages' vocabularies, grammar, \ninflections, and spellings.\n\nCool video, fascinating topic.

On the other hand, in Fredrikstad, just \n100 km away, they say \"j\u00e6i\". There are over a dozen variants of this, \nincluding \"\u00e6\", \"e\", \"i\", and \"eg\". Norwegian probably has some of the most \ndistinguishable dialectal differences (excluding Chinese) because of the \nway the country is shaped: mountains all over the place, originally with \ntiny settlements with their own dialect in every valley.\n\nDifferent traits can immediately give you a rough idea of what part of the \ncountry someone is from. For instance, people in the south of Norway use \n\"bl\u00f8de konsonanter\" (soft consonants), which is borrowed from Danish. In \nthe south and most of the west, the \"skarre-r\" (uvular 'r') is common, \nwhereas it's not very widely used in the rest of the country (a possible \nreason being the retroflex, which is used in the east and north of the \ncountry). Also, in the east and north, we use \"tykk l\" (thick 'l') which \nmeans that there are two different 'l's (and that's a lower case 'L', by \nthe way) in the words \"Ola\" and \"Ellen\".\n\nTo make this even more confusing, Norwegian has two written forms: Bokm\u00e5l \n(literally \"book language\"), which is derived from Danish, and Nynorsk (new \nNorwegian) which was constructed in the 1800s. Right now, only about 27% of \nmunicipalities (12% of the population) use Nynorsk as their primary written \nlanguage, and there is a movement which is especially strong among the \nyouth parties to get rid of teaching the other written form in schools \n(because we can understand each other almost completely fluently, and more \nand more schoolchildren in Nynorsk municipalities are using Bokm\u00e5l in any \ncase).",

People actually sit down to learn it in books and classrooms and \nthat way they learn to not mix things. \nI don't know, that's how I see this. \nAnd it's also a political thing, like, no country would want to give up \ntheir language for a foreign one. No nation would want their schools to \nstop teaching the home language in favor of English. That would show a lot \nof weakness, politically speaking.\nThe only scenario where I think the unification of languages would be \npossible is a technological revolution regarding the way we communicate, \nlike, if the means with which we communicate on the internet were somehow \nthe same with which we communicate on real life, thus spreading the English \nlanguage to our real lives instead of keeping it only on the internet. But \nthis is just a very crazy and confusing science fiction plot on my mind \nhahaha.",
