                    "text": "+Telecastvids \nWell, proof is not really what religion is about, is it? So asking where \nhis proof is is kind of reduntant.\nThere's another reply I left on another comment thread here underneath this \nvideo where I go more into this but what I basically mean is that science, \nespecially when it comes to these things that we can probably never turn \ninto facts (but even IF we can prove these theories - which we probably \ncan't - it doesn't change my point all that much), is not too far off from \nwhat religion is; or at least what it used to be.\n\nScience is all about facts and proof and stuff for most, but in reality, \nonce you get into the deeper things, it really is more about faith.\nPeople theorize about things, explain matters they cannot simply observe, \nfill in the blanks with made-up stories that seem logical; what makes sense \nto them. They BELIEVE in these theories (some fully, some just think \"well \nit MIGHT be true.. it's a possibility\") and then the go on to test it, \ntrying to mostly disprove their own theories. And if they can't, the theory \nstands for now. Then they will probably continue to believe in (the \npossibility of) them.\n\nSo believing in - or even just philosophizing about - any possible \n('scientific' or not) theory about these deeper things, really isn't too \nfar off from religious territory.\nAnd when you start talking about what we're \"supposed to know\" or anything \nlike that, as if you were talking about fate, or some other kind of \nthing/power/entity deciding what we are to know and what not, you have \nfully entered it.",

And their parents. \nWe go back further and further to times when our ancestors were nothing but \nsingle-celled organisms. Where did they come from? Where did the Earth come \nfrom? \nThen you get to the big bang and you ask \"well, where did the stuff come \nfrom that made up this tightly packed matter?\" and even if you could answer \nthat, you'd still answer where that thing that makes up the answer comes \nfrom.\nYou will never be done. You can never answer anything fully. Not even IF we \nwere somehow able to go back in time to observe what happened (which we \naren't, so it's not unlikely that all our theories and all we think we have \nfigured out is complete and utter bullshit). There's always gonna be more \nquestions.\n\nWhich is actually why, to me, science really isn't too far off from \nreligion when it comes to these things; and why I actually kind of have a \nproblem with schools and educational TV programming teaching some of these \ntheories as if they were fact, and hardcore-atheists defending these, often \nin uncivil ways, as such as well against those who refuse to believe in \nthese theories or choose to believe in whatever religion they are part of \nclaims.\nIt's really not that different. Both come up with, to the people writing \nthese down, logical explanations and theories that make sense of the things \nwe just cannot possibly know; because it isn't something we can look at \nwith our eyes or in many ways not even something we can really calculate or \ngrasp with our limited understanding of our surroundings.\n\nSure, to many people these days (and to me as well) it sounds absolutely \nridiculous to say that there's some kind of god who created all this, but \nso do a lot of the theories discussed in science today. And so will \nprobably a lot of the stuff that most people, including the smartest people \nin the world, seem to agree on has likely happened or is likely the \nexplanation for a few things. Especially if you go into quantum physics \nterritory. \nWho's really to say any of these things are even remotely true and will not \nbe laughed at in like 500, 200 or even just 100 years?\n\nPeople will possibly look at these books we wrote, these films we made, \nwith a smile and think to themselves how stupid and naive we must've been \nto even remotely believe any of this.\nJust like many do today with religious scriptures; both current and ancient.",

One can actually see the waves of  image projection flashing and \ncoming out from the projector.  The flashing images inside those waves are \nmade of tiny pixels (= particles.)  That is the dual nature our reality: \nwaves and particles, (i.e., quantum physics.)  We are inside those waves.  \nWe are part of those waves.  But we are also made of tiny pixels or \nparticles.  The images inside the projection waves are made of \npixels/particles.  Does that make sense now?\n\nWhat happens when you magnify the pixels that made up those images?  The \npixels become blurry.  So.  Scientists are now trying to find out if \nparticles - the building blocks of our reality - become blurry if we \nmagnify into them a trillion trillion time.  (Actually, a few years ago a \nscience lab accidentally discovered blurry electrons when it is doing an \nexperiment for something else, now scientists are just trying to confirm \nthe result again with certainty.)  If particles become blurry at a \ntrillion-trillion-time magnification, then it is a good indicator that our \nreality is a huge projection.  A holographic projection.  (A real, solid \nobject does not become blurry when you magnify it.)\n\nWhich would also mean that we are not really here.  We do not actually \nexist in this reality.  Our true existence is somewhere else.  We are \nreally somewhere else.  Where?  Inside the roll of film or the disc inside \nthe film projector.  Or some equivalence of that. \n\n(That's just a simplified explanation; we are a 3D projection, which means \nwe are coming from more than one projectors.  It takes multiple projectors \nto create complex 3D projections.  The current hypothesis is we are being \nprojected from black holes.)",

The important thing \nis that in four dimensional space you can hold 3-D spaces that are infinite \nin size. In my limited knowledge I think you might ONLY be able to have \ninfinite 3-D space in these pockets. Now the whole mind blowing thing is \nthat these universe can actually hold infinite energy. The inflationary \nfield does not follow normal rules, and really it is correct to say it \nholds infinite potential energy. This infinite 4-D dimensional space with \ninfinite potential energy is creating infinite spaces with infinite \nenergies. Kind of like what the f right? So when you say there should be a \nmeasurement. It is not correct to say that really. You are really messing \nwith one infinity larger than another infinity.
