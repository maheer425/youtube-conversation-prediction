                "text": "Personally, the milgram experiment alone is enough to change my opinion on \nhow well people actually act.\n\nThe argument that I'm going to get is \"Well, back then there were no \ncampaigns against killing people!\" Recently, a television network recreated \nthe experiment and got roughly the same results. How could we not have \nlearned anything from all of the television and advertisement about how \ndoing good things is generally good for you and others?\n\nSome people, when told about the Milgram experiment, instantly think that \nthey could never do that - people like me. Thinking about it more, I \nrealized that I couldn't get a definitive answer unless I was put in the \nsituation myself, after which point I thought that I would never be put in \na situation like that. Leading me to my next point - the fact that people \ntypically toss the idea that they'd every be put in that sort of situation. \nInstead of thinking about what they would do or say, past experiences kick \nin and nobody ever realizes that something like that could indeed happen to \nthem.\ufeff",

How do you create peace \nwhen you have a system that literally is backed up by threats of force and \ncontrols whoever failed to win enough elections? I don't see collectivism \nas peaceful at all. Rational self interest is the way to peace; do not \ncontrol others. \n\nIf you help others, you are being selfish, yes, but not in the way that \nmost people mean it in everyday speech. You are being 'selfish' because \nhelping someone else is in YOUR SELF INTEREST. It doesn't take away ANY \nmoral points however. Helping others should be in your self interest and \ntherefore SELFISH, without the derogatory or stigma behind the word.\n\nThis confusion is where Ayn Rand gets gang raped by millions of liberals.\ufeff",

If their government can't lift \nthe people out of poverty they have a bad government, but again, i don't \nblame the system i blame the people running it.\n\nAmericans in general have a problem with that as i understand, the poor may \nsometimes fat because they eat junk, and junk is cheap, i should know, by \namerican standards i'd probably be considered poor, we usually call poor \nthose living in sheet iron houses.

You started to challenge it . . . \"you can \nindeed be forced to buy an overpriced product, not because they put a gun \nat your head, but because of availability.\" Can you finish that? Why would \nfreedom not correct the availability problem? Lack of availability such as \nof plywood in a storm raises the price of plywood which causes retailers \nnormally not in that market to convert over. Contrast that with the \ngovernment reaction which is to forbid the price from going up. No one \nwould voluntarily fill that need so government would have to force them or \nsubsidize them, or be obligated to borrow from future tax payers to go into \nthat business. That was my example. Could you come up with examples of \nbeing forced to buy an overpriced product in a free market? How about \nsomething so wonderful as a smart phone. Before it was invented it didn't \nseem like we had to have it, but now that we are accustomed to its wonder, \nis the provider obligated to make only a modest profit? Notice the good of \nsuch greed. He raises the threshold which inspires others to enter that \nmarket. The constraint upon you in coming up with a free market failure is \nthe word \"free\" in free market. You can't use an example where government \nrestrictions allow only one company to serve a market.\n         You said you didn't get my point about Cuba's success with \neducation and health care as an example of doing what politics dictates and \nstill failing to lift its people out of poverty. You felt that Cuba was not \na fair comparison. Why doesn't it count? If you line up those countries \nthat are least free like North Korea at the top and Singapore, most free, \nat the bottom, you will find that, that is exactly the order of countries \npeople most want to move away from.  That is if they were allowed to. You \nimplied you don't live in America. Are you aware of our most important long \nterm problems? For people at the poverty level, its obesity. Think of it. \nOur poor suffer from eating too much. The other problem is the overwhelming \ndesire people have to immigrate here. We have huge fences to keep people \nout.",

I hope I'm supporting \nyour view here John... To say that some social norm such as capitalism \nneeds a ying to its yang is natural but no more correct than to say that \nfreedom of press needs an offsetting view that it is good for authorities \nto judge and then punish hurtful speech. Alas, how do you control the \ncontrollers. One day a Conservative might be in charge of speech.\n       The problem with intervention by a central authority which has the \nsanction of force is that it is done in an environment where the actors are \nin other area still somewhat free. The minimum wage law for example -for it \nto work- requires employers not to fire anyone whose skill is insufficient \nfor that wage. There must be created an agency to monitor that. The same or \nsimilar agency is necessary to make sure no employer who might have hired \nmore at the lower wage, instead works harder those left behind because \nthere are now more people competing for the same (now better paid) job. An \nagency must be able to regulate employer's decisions to invest in labor \nsaving measures in case they choose the wrong reason: the cost of labor. \nAnd finally, to keep companies from going out of business, there must be an \nagency that subsidizes (and helps manage) those who just can't operate \nunder those conditions.\n     Mr. De Armas is quite on point, however, in his last words and it is \nworth repeating here John: \"if you are an ass and you don't help your \nteammates, you are left aside obviously, of course, in society you are \nprobably too insignificant for anyone to care most of the time, you \nresponsibility towards society melts among all other people, the fact is \nthat you cannot live without society, society are other, so you do indeed \nowe them.\" I'm not being facetious when I say that is good philosophy. But \naltruism like freewill cannot be compelled. It is something of a oxymoron \nto say \"society requires you to be altruist.\" Notice in contrast the good \nfeelings involved when strangers approach each other to trade. If society \nis free, the transaction happens by itself, both walk away better off. \nThere's no better way to create a society of truck-trade-and-specialize. No \nmatter how big General Motors gets, they cannot force you to buy their car \nor work for them. A government, no matter how small, however, can indeed \nforce you to buy or work for whatever the political decision makers have \ndeemed necessary at the moment. The free market will not make utopia. There \nwill be suffering in the freest of countries, but it will be natural, the \nkind that motivates improvement, rather than the suffering imposed by a \nsociety like Cuba where health care and education is indeed universal, but \nfor some detail that cannot be explained, all of those equal people are \nprofoundly poor.",

Previously, evolutionary biologists \nsaw genes simply as a means of self interested individual organisms to be \nfit, with genes that make the individual fitter being the ones most likely \nto persist. However Richard Dawkins proposes that genes don't necessarily \npersist because they help make the species fitter. Genes persist because \nthey are simply good at persisting even at the expense of the fitness of \nthe species. They are like parasites or freeloaders living off the altruism \nof other genes.\n\nIndividual organisms are still seen as self interested as always but now \nthat selfishness is seen as a conglomerate of the selfishness of individual \ngenes. The genetic \"self\" is a multitude in the same way a self interested \nsocial group of animals is made up of many self interested individuals. \nThis obviously applies to human animals forming groups and acting like self \ninterested wholes such as tribes, city-states, and nations.\n\nRichard Dawkins explains this similarity between genetics and human society \nwith the concept of memes. In the same way genes are units of information \nstored in DNA, memories/ideas, i.e. memes, are information stored in human \nminds. We are each of us a multitude, both genetically and \npsychologically/memetically. Humans are willing to jump on a grenade for \nthe persistence of an idea for the same reason they are willing to jump on \na grenade to save their own children.\n\nIn this way, altruism can be seen as selfish.",

I don't mean or desire to come \noff as judgmental, but what often disgusts me is when someone brings up the \nwhole \"altruism is insincere,\" \"no one can act without self-interest\" (and \nmind that, being in quite a haste right now, I did not read this discussion \nthoroughly so I apologize if I missed some things) because at the end of \nthe day, how can you tell *ME* why I choose to be compassionate and help \nothers. How can you tell my friends or my loved ones, or yes that soldier \nthat threw himself on top of a grenade, or that activist that risked \nassassination or execution by standing in front of a row of tanks or \nrallying the people to rise up against oppression, that the deepest roots \nof these actions are still selfish? Just because *you* *might* not be able \nto ever do an altruistic deed without it benefiting you in some way, even \nemotionally, doesn't mean that there aren't others out there, whose \npsychology you can never truly understand without being them, that are \nprofoundly different from you, that feel things different from you. In \nother words, in my honest opinion, I can *presume* that those that believe \nthat altruists are insincere or that no one can be compassionate without \nbeing self-serving to even the slightest degree, *probably* believe that \nbecause they themselves *lack empathy or compassion* and thus cannot \nunderstand that people certainly can do things for others at their own \nexpense. They are applying their subjectivity universally, and that is \nirrational. It is *generalization* of all humanity.\nAnd while you may argue that ultimately, the fulfillment of a desire (i.e. \nto help others) and the happiness or relief stemming from it supports this \nnotion that no altruistic deed is without self-interest, I would argue that \neven if that can be said to be \"self-interest,\" it is negligible or \nirrelevant when the overall consequences of an altruistic act is at the \n*expense* of the altruist. e.g. dying, or long-term suffering & sacrifice, \nwhere the altruist would be in far less pain, physically and \npsychologically, had (s)he chosen not to lend the aid (s)he did.",

My classmate donated a \nquarter just to get his name on there, and I was disgusted. I then donated \n$40 to the cause and refused to put my name on the banner. My homeroom \nteacher happened to be walking by as I handed the cash to the office, and \nafterwards she asked, \"Is she your friend?\" I said no, that I had never met \nher and didn't know anything about her except that she needed the \ntransplant. I had the money to help, so I wanted to. \"But you didn't even \nput your name on the banner?\" I said no again. She couldn't believe I had \ndone that. When I got home and told my mom, she was actually angry that I \nhad donated that much money. I told her, \"I worked for it. I earned it. And \nI don't need it. She literally needs the money to live.\" She was still \nangry. I never regretted that decision, even 7 (maybe 8?) years later.\n\nSo, yeah. That's my most altruistic story. I would have many more, because \nI always try to help, but I haven't had much to offer people in a long \ntime.

I liked my \nballoon, but I knew that my balloon would mean a lot more to this little \ngirl, so I gave it to her. I didn't do it to feel good about myself, I \ndidn't do it because someone would see me being kind, I did it because this \ngirl was really upset about not having a balloon and I knew that she would \nenjoy it much more than I would. As soon as I gave it to her, some lady \ncame up to me and told me that God had seen my act of kindness, and I \nremember being a little weirded out, but that's beside the point.\nAlthough our altruistic actions often do have benefits for us, (feeling \ngood about ourselves, recognition, etc.) I don't think it can be assumed \nthat all good deeds are motivated by self interest and personal gain.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Belle La Victorie\n\"therefore do not carry the homosexual gene.\"\n\nThe current state of knowledge in behavioural genetics is that \nhomosexuality arises, like many things, as an interconnected result of \ngenes and environment.\n\nIf one of two monozygotic twins is homosexual, there is a higher than \naverage chance of the other one being homosexual as well, even if they are \nseparated at birth and grow up in completely different environments, hence \nthere is a genetical component.\n\nThere are certain environmental factors as well, which push the chance up \nor down, which I can lay out if you like, but I don't want to write novel.\n\nYou can inherit the genetical combination that, given the right enviroment, \ntrigger homosexuality from your parents. Note please that there is no \nsingle \"homosexual gene\", as far as we currently know.\n\nSo, in very short, it goes something like this. Your parents meet and have \nthree kids. Both supply the genetical combinations which allow \nhomosexuality to trigger, which are now present in all three kids. In two \nof them, it is phenotypical recessive and is not triggered, in one of them \nit is.\n\nThe two heterosexual ones go on and have babies. Since they have a sibling \nwho is able to help them with their offspring, they tend to have more kids \n(the effect I already spoke about). Given the right partner, they pass on \nthe genetical combination that allows for homosexuality.\n\nThat is why there is actually natural selection in favor of having a \ncertain portion of the population being homosexual. 5 to 20%, as it turns \nout. \n\nMy summary is very short and not very strictly defined, but this is \nfactually the current state of knowledge in behavioural genetics. If you \nlike to read about it in length, I can point you towards the relevant \nliterature.\n\nNow, back to altruism.\n\n\"The fact that people sacrifice their lives to protect others when there is \na net loss to both the person and society factually exists.\"\n\nOk, first of all, sacrificing your life for anything is certainly no \ntypical human behaviour. If it were, organ doner lists for example would \nbecome much shorter, as you could walk in a hospital right now and save \nprobably around 4 people by giving up your organs. Are you willing to do \nthat? I doubt it.\n\nIn many cases you only know a posteriori that the person actually just \nsacrificed its life, compared to just taking a big risk. A fireman for \nexample can walk in a building and die trying to save an old woman, but did \nhe sacrifice himself? Kinda, but not really, since he certainly expected to \nwalk out again.\n\nThe \"net loss\" you'd experience when a young person \"sacrifices\" itself for \nan old person is also genetically irrelevant, because the broader \nbehavioural construct that is partially selected for would be something \nlike \"x is willing to take big risks to save [others]\"; there is certainly \nno \"saving old ladies\" gene.\n\nSo, to conclude, for the extreme rare cases of what you consider \nnon-net-beneficial altruism, you can point towards behavioural patterns \nbeing applied which would normally be beneficial, but just in this case \nhappen to be not. \"Altruism\" as such however still remains beneficial to \nthe acting person, due to gratitude and effects on social standing, as long \nas the altruistic person isn't knowingly dying in the process, which would \nbe a very very very rare case indeed.\n\nYou can see real altruism only when you squint your eyes. On close \nexamination of ANY specific case, other mechanisms quickly explain away \nwhat seemed like altruism from a distance. \n\nThe next question would be why I care that much about people being wrong on \nthe internet.",
