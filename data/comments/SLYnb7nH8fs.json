Then finally someone let me out, and then pushed me \ninto a different room, and locked the door, and said \"Enjoy\" and then, I \nsaw a speaker, then suddenly, it started playing people screaming really \nloud, it was horrible, I was still screaming and crying and begging. Until \nafter about an hour I think, they let me out, and a women came up to me, \nand escorted me out, because I had started scratching the door, and my \nfingernails were down to stub, and when I got out, the last thing I \nremember saying, is \"Are they still in the maze?! They're going to kill me\"",

So they do have waivers, they do a \nscreening of the people, and they have people on hand that are watching the \npeople as the go throw the tour....so is it \"legal\"? I mean probably...they \nare still in business. Is it okay?? I am conflicted I guess that's up the \nthe individual. I would never do it I think it's insane but if there is \nthat many people signing up for it then I guess enough people want to live \nout the \"horror film\" experience and they are still in business....",

If someone got sexually assaulted or severely injured the owner of \nthe attraction could be facing a serious lawsuit and the actor quite \npossibly criminal charges. Waivers only work should you get injured in the \ncapacity of what is expected.

Plenty \nof 8 year olds have been through \"fucked up shit\" and would never be so \nhostile to strangers.

Some of the \ntoughest fuckers you'll meet who go through a torture like training \nexperience so they are mentally strong enough to deal with it for as long \nas they can. Yet in one video it shows a military personal, who has went \nthrough real or simulated torture I cant remember, tied up and blindfolded \non his knees weeping. Its not good place, they are legally \"torturing\" the \nvisitors. Whilst streaming it to an unknown audience in Vegas who bet on \nit. McKaney charges no entrance fee and invested 500k in his house so he \nclearly like the idea of tormenting his victims; he doesnt let them leave \nwhen they want. They could be mentally broken and if he says \"they are \nfine\" then they are forced to carry on, they have no choice but to remain \ngetting water boarded, beat up, thrown around etc. Even though they sign a \nwaiver so allow him to do this, they do not know exactly what they are \nallowing him to do as in 2014 he has stopped people knowing what goes on \ninside, no REAL videos, no statements, no comments. He explains nothing, \nthe unknown vegas group get the \"workers\" to force the victims to announce \ntheir greatest fears then they adapt the tour to physically and emotionally \ntorture you. No form of torture is legal, no matter how much paper work you \nsign.",

If they are physically beating the life out of your \nlungs, file a lawsuit and get out at the next exit. You have the option to \ndo that. That is if you read the waver. People AGREE to do these things \nwith the rule that there must be no retaliation. Even the owner advises \npeople not to do it because him and his employees are being controlled by \nother people from Vegas. People's experiences are live-streamed and people \nmake bets on how long they'll last before they crack. That's how they make \ntheir money since the dog food and proceeds go to a charitable \norganisation. Those people running the live-stream relay directions to the \nemployees on what they want done to these people. Have you ever seen the \n\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin movie The Condemned? That's practically what this \nis minus the murdering. So if you go in and get charged with aggravated \nassault, are you really a better more mature person because something \ndidn't go your way? You'll have violated the waver. When you kids grow up \nyou'll learn violence doesn't solve everything. Maybe little disputes on \nthe playground with fatties, but that shit doesn't fly in the adult world. \nThe point is though, this guy is full of bullshit. If this story was true \nthen he would of had charges pressed against him. Plus people who go in are \nusually blindfolded. If you sign up after all the bad publicity this has \ngotten, it is your fault. Simply do NOT got in. What next, are you going to \nbelieve he's really the 7000th Zombie Slayer?",

It should be illegal for this type of thing to \nexist but I suppose with legal loopholes and what not, they do have their \n'victims' sign a waver so it's probably somewhat their fault too. Then \nagain they don't exactly tell you what you're getting into.\n\nOh well, all I know is I had to run out shaking like a leaf, after the \nfirst house at Farmageddon so I think I would actually mentally and \nphysically die in the Manor and probably have to use the safe words in all \nof the other haunts. \ufeff",
