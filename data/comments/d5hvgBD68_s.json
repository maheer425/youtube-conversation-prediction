Over time you need to use more and more to get a high \nand it doesn't have the same effect on you that it did. Kurt regularly \npushed the boat out on how much he would take so it's not that hard to \nimagine with his tolerance levels he was capable of using a shotgun with a \nlot of Heroin in his system.\n\nThe money motive on Courtney too it's just not really enough of a motive to \nwant to kill somebody and pay off enough people to get away with it. She \nwas already becoming famous before she met Kurt and would have made money \nregardless of marrying him so this idea that she killed him to avoid losing \neverything in a divorce is silly.

Either way you'll \nbe incapacitated before you can even get the needle out of your arm, leave \nalone taking the tourniquet off, roll down the sleeve, button it up, put \nall your drug paraphernalia neatly into a cigar box and THEN take the \nshotgun and shoot yourself in the head. Also, why bring the shotgun in the \nfirst place when you know perfectly well that the amount of junk you're \nabout to shoot yourself up with will kill you right off the bat anyway? On \ntop of that, the \"suicide\" letter was written in 2 different handwritings \nand it's only the last 4 lines that \"make\" it a suicide letter and they \nweren't written by Kurt. And finally, how come there were no fingerprints \non the gun or the shells although they belonged to Kurt and he supposedly \nshot himself with it? There weren't even partial prints, that means someone \nmust have wiped it off. If you put everything together it's pretty obvious \nthat someone else must have been there, and it's also pretty clear that \nKurt couldn't have shot himself. Don't take my word for it, though, in \nregards to how long it takes someone to die from a triple lethal overdose. \nGo to a hospital and ask a doctor. The autopsy report stated that Kurt must \nhave injected himself between 225 to 245 milligrams of heroin per liter \nblood.",

You shall not make for yourself an idol.\nHave you made a god with your hands or your mind to suit yourself?\n \n3.     You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.\nHave you used God\u2019s name lightly or to show disgust?\n \n4.     Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.\nThe days He gives to us are a gift, yet we fail to give thanks for them.\n \n5.     Honor your father and mother.\nHave you always done what is pleasing for your parents?\n \n6.     You shall not kill.\nJesus said that if you hate your brother without cause you will be in \ndanger of the judgment; have you ever been unjustly angry with someone?\n(Matthew 5:21,22) Whoever hates his brother is a murderer\u2026 (1 John 3:15)\n \n7.     You shall not commit adultery.\nJesus said that if you look at someone to lust after them that you have \ncommitted adultery already in your heart; have you ever looked with lust?\n(Matthew 5:27,28)\n \n8.     You shall not steal.\nHave you ever stolen anything, value is irrelevant?\n \n9.     You shall not lie.\nHow many lies have you told in your life?\n \n10.   You shall not covet.\nHave you ever desired something that did not belong to you?\n \n1 John 3:4\n\u2026for sin is transgression of the Law.\nJames 2:10\nFor whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is \nguilty of all.\nEcclesiastes 12:14\nFor God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, \nwhether good or evil.\n \nThere is a day coming in which God will judge you according to His \nrighteousness. The Bible says that God is a just judge, and he will judge \nyour every thought, word, and deed. How many times have you violated His \nLaw? The punishment for these crimes is a prison called Hell, and it is a \nlife sentence (eternity).\nIf you\u2019re honest with yourself, you know that you have broken God\u2019s Law a \nmultitude of times. You will have to answer to God for every sin you ever \ncommitted against Him. God is so good that He must punish all people who \nwillingly violate His moral Law. No one will escape from justice in God\u2019s \ncourtroom.\n                There is only one way to avoid this prison from which there \nwill be no escape, if a sinless person takes your punishment then God can \nlet you go free.  Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, suffered capital \npunishment (death) on a cross. Jesus paid the fine you owe in His life\u2019s \nblood. John 3:16,17 says, \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only \nbegotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have \neverlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn \nworld, but that the world through Him might be saved.\u201d\n                The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus. The only \nway to receive His gift is to repent (turn from your sins) and put your \ntrust in Jesus!  Please do so today. We are not promised to live tomorrow. \nOur lives may be taken at any moment, and we will then stand before God in \njudgment. \u201cIs sin so luscious that you will burn in Hell forever for it?\u201d \u2013 \nCharles Spurgeon\ufeff",

I asked \nGod to show me what He needed me for and He showed me a dark spirit, and I \ncalled on Christ, and that spirit was gone. I wasn't alone I was with \nfamily during this prayer in the name of Christ, but it was a test to show \nme that He was real because I think He knew that I gave up on Him, and I \ndid because He wasn't there when I asked for Him. So, He is real and I know \nthis through the acts that he's put me through. Even in illness I believe, \nand a few days ago the Chaplain told me that I wasn't supposed to carry the \nburden and the weight just because God asked me to do something. What He \nasked of me was much bigger than I so it was hurting me inside because I \ndidn't want to let Him down. I was shown that we are really in our last \ndays FOR REAL, and I needed to tell as many people as I could so that they \ncould too rest in the Kingdom of Heaven because Satan is among us or \nLucifer meaning light. Anytime you hear someone tell you to wake up and \nbecome enlightened, they are calling you to Lucifer, when these \nentertainers or politicians or anyone who has the ability to use the tele \nto communicate with the masses, they are worshiping Lucifer because they \nare using his symbolism's, and it's everywhere and they aren't even hiding \nit nowadays. They used to but not now because he is right here and taking \nnumbers. Once God showed me this stuff, I was in complete shock, and He \nwanted me to tell people this! I didn't want to look like a fool, or coo \ncoo. This was just too much. So the Chaplain told me to testify to people \nbut that's all and hope that they hear me and know that this was a \nrevelation directly from the Lord, and it's going to be hard because this \nis not the me that they know. I am so afraid for us all, not satan, but God \nis very angry right now because this isn't what he wanted for us and what \nHe created for us was ruined by us...again. I won't let Him down. I will do \nwhat He wants as best as I can. Do you believe me at all? I am so sorry if \ni am rambling because I had to take my meds, and because of the pain, it \nmakes me goofy, LMBO!",

First of all, there were no fingerprints on the gun, which btw \nwas standing in his torso, while his arms were along side. If you shoot \nyourself in the head, that's just not how it looks. Plus, the gun was too \nbig for him to hold that way, his arms weren't \"long\" enough. And there was \nso much heroin in his body he wouldn't have had the strength to roll down \nhis sleeve, clean all the drug material and put it back on the box to, \nthen, shoot himself. Plus, people (especially his friends and family) never \nthought he was sucidial... Courtney started saying that AFTER he died. \nYou should really just read. justiceforkurt.*com\ufeff",

                    "text": "+xxes11xx Your a bit confused xD He never had SURGERY to correct his \nVitiligo. At first he covered it up to match his skin tone through the \nthriller years and by Bad it had covered so much of his body that he was \nliterally going onstage with almost full-body makeup. He tried loads of \ntreatments to get the skin pigmentation back, but none were successful. So, \nin order to even out his skin and avoid the \"patchy\" look, he ended up \nhaving most of the pigment removed from his skin to match the vitiligo \npatches. Thats why the end result he looked very pale, as he had \npractically no pigmentation. The nose surgery is a completely different \nthing. He originally got minor changes to his nose for completely cosmetic \nreasons, as many celebrities do. Unfortunately this is before he was \ndiagnosed with the autoimmune disease Lupus, which inhibited his ability to \nheal. Which meant the surgery didn't heal up properly and he kept having to \ngo under the knife to fix the previous surgery. It progressively got worse \nand worse and there was less and less the plastic surgeons could do. His \nnose at one point actually started collapsing. ON TOP of all this, the \nconstant corrective surgeries started to restrict his breathing which in \nturn affected his singing. And thus even more surgeries. It kinda just \nsnowballed. Then after the Pepsi burn, he was put on loads of pain \nmedications which he eventually became addicted to. Part of that addiction \nis the illusion that you are still in pain even though there is nothing \nphysically wrong. This led to his drug battle, he lost loads of weight AND \naround the same time became a vegetarian (more weight loss)  which is why \nhe looked so thin and unhealthy in his later years.  Plus he started having \nloads of mental problems like depression after the child molestation cases \nand all the media attention that followed. Basically, he was dealt a really \nbad hand in life. A real shame for someone so talented :/ ",

The evidence \npoints to Cobain killing himself, and not Love. So if you say otherwise \nthen you have to provide evidence that outweighs that assertion. Which you \nwill not be able to, because then it would not be called a myth.",

It's also why Dave and Courtney won't speak to eachother, \nbecause they both know what they did and went their separate ways with the \nsame deed done.  How Dave's been able to live with it without cracking, is \ndue to participating in a \"cremation of care\" ceremony (where you sacrifice \nyour own conscience so you don't feel bad for the choices you have or will \nmake).  And I also believe it's why Courtney's drug abuse became so \nevident, as she has cracked under the circumstances of how and why she \nachieved fame.

Not only are you completely oblivious \nto what is going on, but you got completely schooled by +Drannon Moore on \nyour grammar as well. You should sit down and study this one. The myth \nwas/is, that Ozzy bit the head off of a rubber bat. The reason you were so \neasily confused is probably because they explained why it is NOT a myth \nfirst, before actually stating what the myth was. Maybe it was their \"super \nawesome\" way of presenting the number 1 myth, by \"mixing it up\" a little. \nHahaha, nonetheless I appreciate you making an ass out of yourself dude, \nvery entertaining.

And that whole \"slinging his infant off a balcony\" thing \nwas a mistake, sure, but he was holding onto the child very tightly, he \nwould never actually drop his own kid. Just the whole thing was completely \nblown out of proportion. The fans wanted to see the baby, so he showed \nthem. And the whole incident lasted for maybe 2 seconds, and he wasn't \nexactly careless in doing it. I don't get why people still talk about these \nthings like it's such a huge deal.",

As a young man he was a very \nattractive young man. next time I saw him he had changed into Diana Ross \nthen he turned into a paste colored white old lady. he looked a Disney \nVillain. He could have been in a batman movie as a nemesis in his street \nclothes. but hey I would be a bit of a tard if Joe Jackson had went upside \nmy head my entire childhood. .That does not give him license to sling his \ninfant off a balcony or make his little white children go out in public in \nklu klux klan hoods. Ya'll know that shit ain't right.I believe in innocent \nuntil proven guilty so all that other mess was just made up because he \nlooked a bit, no a LOT fey.They did try really really hard. I knew better I \nsaw him as a young man in tight hip huggers dancing with his brothers. All \n I have to say Is \"if it could never fit you must acquit\"It would take a \nnasty ho to slang all that up in.Michael could have chose to use stage \nquality body makeup  that sprays on and lasts until you wash it off. He \nchose instead to become a white lady. NONE of this takes away , in my mind \nfrom a very generous charitable human being who truly was a unique and \nbeautiful light in this world. Making him into something he wasn't is a \nwrong done to our beautiful wonderful weird Michael.NOW be offended \n.Michael is somewhere giggling at you.",

If you \nget yourself checked out and tested you WILL be cured most defiantly. And \nconsidering to get rabies you need to be bite by a bat or other wild, warm \nblooded animal rabies check is *routine* at any hospital or clinic.\nHowever, if you have allowed rabies to travel within you for months (Due to \nnot getting checked out) then the symptoms will start to show at the end of \nsaid period and it's near impossible for you to survive at that point as \nyou'll die *within a few days.*",

The Paul is dead thing was so ridiculous the Beatles \nintentionally made fun of it (a lot of the supposed evidence was because \nthe Beatles were so amused by the rumor they intentionally placed false \nevidence of it all over the place).

The first humans went into the trap of \nSatan as well as some angels, and to show them salvation their creator \nwould have to take the sins of humankind, and since God himself is life, He \ncouldn't die, but Jesus, who also created the universe, could, and so He \ndid.

What's your excuse?\nWe all know humanity is inherently selfish, but people love to fake \naltruism by hiding behind bogus ridiculousness like \"love each other as i \nhave loved you\" and \"jesus says to love our fellow man\" smh take jesus out \nof the equation and watch how quickly you idiots show that you don't really \ngive a damn about each other, never have, never will.\nYou're all so sad and pathetic for pushing aside life looking for some sort \nof eternal reward.

Her dad is likely worse than \nshe is, people as messed up as Courtney rarely come from happy homes.
