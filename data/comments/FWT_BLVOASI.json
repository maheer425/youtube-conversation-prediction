                "text": "I personally find this fascinating because I have Asperger's Syndrome.  For \nme, straight milk gives me trouble.  I'm not lactose intolerant, because I \ndon't have trouble in my gut.  The issue is that it causes a lot of \n'static' in my head.  I can't concentrate and I become much more sensitive \nto things.  When I switched to lactose-free milk, my symptoms cleared up.\n\nI had already heard elsewhere that microbes in the gut could get one of the \ncauses of autistic symptoms.  So hearing that it really is possible to \nremove the worst of it and allow people like me to function on a higher \nlevel is promising.\n\nI can already pass as a person with full capabilities, but people tend to \nforget that I don't function quite as good as they might need me to.  I \nhope that more is discovered in the near future for myself and many others \nwho can benefit.\ufeff",
