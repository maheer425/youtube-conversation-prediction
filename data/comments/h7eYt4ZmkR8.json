I constantly walk around doing reality checks to \nsee if I am awake or dreaming. It's pretty scary because what happens if I \nthink that I'm only dreaming when I'm actually awake? I could jump off a \ncliff or kill someone and believe that everything will go back to normal \nagain when I wake up... =/ And yes I do see a therapist... lol\ufeff",

The whole point of it being a lucid dreaming is that you \nclearly know you are dreaming trough gaining conscious during a dream.",

It's where our \nhigher order thinking happens. It's shut down when dreaming. In fact, the \nreason why teenagers do dumb things is because their prefrontal cortex \nisn't fully developed and \"online\" during the teen years. People with ADHD \nhave problems with dopamine reception in the prefrontal cortex, which is \nwhy stimulants flood the synaptic centers with dopamine. Our bodies are \nparalyzed in REM sleep, which is the state of sleep dreaming happens in. \nREM sleep is most like being awake. It's the lightest sleep. When we wake \nfrom REM, we are less groggy than if we wake from stage 3/4 sleep. The \nFreudian view of dreams is not considered scientific because it can't be \nreproduced experimentally. At best, the Freudian view of dreams can be \nconsidered philosophy. Now tell me where I'm wrong. And if you want to \nconsider yourself a good scientist, you wouldn't complain about having to \nput things in lay terms. I know you think you're a scientist, but you're \nnot yet.

                "text": "+Big Think I have an interesting story to share with you about my lucid \ndreaming (small wall of text below)...\n\nAround the time I was 20 years old (about 4.5 years ago), I conducted an \nexperiment to see if I could use my lucid dreaming to view into my past \nmemories and possibly re-live them instead of just having a dream, then \ncontrolling it halfway in. Most of my normal dreams seemed to be centered \naround my emotions and how I truly felt about things going on in my current \nlife, so I had a good feeling my memories were connected to strong \nemotions. Anyway, it took about 3 nights to pull off, but I did it. \nHowever, there was a catch...\n\nIn the dream, I put myself in a long, white hallway with a door at the end, \nmuch like the 2nd Matrix movie in the Keymaker scene, but I understood \nthere were memories behind this door. So I walked to the door, grabbed the \ndoorknob, and only cracked the door open wide enough to peak in...and...I \nrelived EVERY single thing I've ever regretted since I was 3 years \nold...even the smallest things like forgetting to vacuum the living room \nbefore my parents got home or something. I can't exactly recall the \nmemories I saw anymore. I assume it's stored away in my subconscious mind. \nBut the memories went backwards in time in chronological order and they \nstopped when I was 3 years old, and then repeated. You can only imagine \njust how much I witnessed if a 3 year old had something to regret lol.\n\nThe memories were so intense that it woke me up from my sleep, and I could \nstill see these memories flashing before my eyes one after another in the \ndarkness of my room for about 10-15 seconds, as they slowly faded away. The \nwhole ordeal seemed to only last 20 seconds including when I woke up from \nthe dream. That means I was seeing multiple memories every second, but I \ncould see them all as clear as a night sky in Texas.\n\nSo, I haven't tried to do it again since then. Not only did I have a \n\"laundry list\" of factors I had to overcome the first time but if I can't \ncontrol which \"door\" I'm going to be peaking into next time, then I'm \nafraid to even try it again. \n\nAnd I can't stress enough how intense this dream was though. I wish I \npossessed the proper literary skills to describe just how intense it was \nbut I'll try to sum it up: It's similar to how I feel on roller coasters \nand I'm afraid of heights. That dream really messed up my mood for a full \n24 hours and it left me with a pretty good headache....and I only opened my \n\"door of regrets\". Just imagine if it were my \"door of sorrows\".\ufeff",

What I am trying to say is, if you do go to see a \npsychologist, which may be necessary or not, it should be one who also \nknows about regressions and perhaps who is also a psychic, for lack of a \nbetter word for those manifestations of the mind which are not totally \ndiscovered or accepted by science.  What I am trying to say is, and I am \nsorry to say it, not all psychologist are able to help in some matters and \nif we are not careful choosing one, they can even mix up the situation or \neven the mind.  On the other side, experiences like the one you had are \nnot totally uncommon and they may happen once in life and that's all.  If \nyou feel you have a need to go more deeply into these kind of experiences, \nwith help, I wish you could find a very good person who could help you \nsuccessfully, otherwise better to wait till the appropriate time comes to \ndo it.

What you did, for what I understand, was a regression, something \nto be done under experienced professionals. \nI did have once a similar dream, in one sense.  I went to a hospital \nlooking for my record, but the record keeper was away.  I insisted to see \nhim and they told me he was inside a column next to where I was standing, \noutside from the record archives.  I went straight to the column and opened \na small door.  He was a bat, hanging next to the small door.  When he saw \nthe light he sent me a striking look, he was so angry and disturbed!\nI asked a few persons and a psicologist and the answer was that I was not \nready yet to know what was written in my record, meaning I was not ready \nyet to know all about certain aspects of my life.  When the moment comes, \nthen we should do it through meditation guided by an expert.  This is what \nI learned.  I hope it is useful.",

This walks in line with physics, if you \nconsider the body an individual atomic structure (an atom or \"Adam\"), we \nhave the more positive aspect, a more negative aspect and a true aspect, \nwhich is generally clouded by the more negative aspects (fear, hatred, \njealousy). A life which reflects a more positive environment will improve \nthe overall structure of the \"atom\" (Adam) and at a certain point of \ndevelopment (free from \"Sin\" or negativity) can evolve, solidifying the \nhigher aspect into a solid form. This is known as alchemy, the science of \nturning the negative aspects of lead into the more positive aspects of \ngold. Once free of this negativity, this atom becomes a free radical (see \n\"Free radical theory of aging\" -Denham Harman) and will no longer be bound \nto it's primary source (aka the Earth) and you will be a free to roam the \nentire Universe as an individual, retaining full consciousness.

You could even change the \nterm \"electric\" over to digital and say a digital form of yourSELF has \nfreed itself from the physical body (aka The Matrix). When Neo took the \npill ,he basically killed himself in OUR dimension and had a digital self \nbuilt and waiting for him, where they simply transferred his consciousness \nto, in the other dimension they ended up in. It's your soul. Pythagoras \nwrote about this exact same thing it just had different terminology.

A cool fact about motion or action is moving your hand, seeing \nsomeone else's hand move or imaging your hand move will all produce similar \n\"activation\" in the brain, under the scanner. Dreaming is no different. So \nyes, maybe in the participants dream he did as he was instructed. But maybe \nhe was simply walking or doing some other type of motion involving the \nhand. This would also cause these same brain areas to light up. The Sam \nHarris talk, is about one's own experience in conjunction with with \nobjective measures.  & How the two are inseparable. I agree with this. I \nmean, look at most social sciences,  subjective coherence often leads to \nsome objective conclusion. The key thing here is that such coherence leads \nto narrowing  down the reason behind a given phenomenon.  Now, going back \nto our original brain activation experiment & this lucid dreaming talk, the \nproblem isn't necessarily with anecdotal evidence or subjective experience. \nThe problem is in placing value on such a thing while lacking the objective \nmeasure to back it.

Lucid dreaming is being aware that you are dreaming which has \nhappened to me & that isn't what I'm arguing. Now, what Mr. Kaku states in \nthis talk is they gave someone instructions to do a task before this person \nwent to sleep. Said person fell asleep and bam you see brain activation \nthat shows the motor cortex areas associated with hand movement. THIS IN NO \nWAY proves that the individual while asleep, while dreaming carried out the \ninstructions given. NOW, that, if it WERE the case would be scientifically \nconfirming lucid dreaming.

I can \nremember this particular dream because it was one of the most terrifying \nexperiences of my childhood. I was in my room sleeping and all of a sudden \nfor whatever reason, I had woken up but i was paralyze at the same time, I \nwas so terrified about not being able to open my eyes or arms that I had no \nidea what was going on, all i could think of was \"I need some help but i \ncan't scream or move, so maybe if I breathe harder my mom would somehow \nnotice\". She didn't. While in that state, my hearing had become super \nsensitive, I was able to listen to things that would normally go unnoticed, \nlike the static white noise my stereo would emit. But because of my \nheighten sensitivity of hearing and not knowing what the hell I was \nexperiencing, it had induced one the most vivid nightmares I've ever had. A \ncouple of years ago I found out that what I had experience was a thing, \nthat there is an actual term for it\"lucid dreaming\", and that it's not only \npossible to have a lucid dream but to control it. The last one I had was \nalmost a year ago, but unlike my first, I was ready and in control.\ufeff",
