So, there. \nBesides, I never understood why [America] football is called football if \nyou barely even use your foot nor is it a ball, as it is not spherical.\n\nAnd side note here, despite how much people say that Americans \"created\" \nthe word soccer, it was actually the British, specifically Oxford, as they \nenjoyed adding -er in the end of words, they called the Football \nAssociation as \"soccer\" from the word Association, with the letter \nasSOCCiation. So there.\n\nEither way, I still want an explanation why American football has to be \ncalled football.",

EVen if \nyou actually are a shy/quiet and clumsy person, those new people don't know \nit so you don't need to show it. Some people might call it being a fake but \nin every person there is their confident side that has been taken down by \nsome past experiences, new people don't know your past, so you can always \nshow your new side to them. If you screw up though, you need to come up \nwith something to change it and it can be really tough. So it's easier to \nmake first good impressions rather than trying to fix them later.\nHoweever, people who really are able to change from no name to someone \nelse, those people are always looked up apon. But as i said earlier, it's \ntough.",
