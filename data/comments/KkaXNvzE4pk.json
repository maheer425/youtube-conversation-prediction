                    "text": "+MarcoMars I think I know why you think that.\n\nLet's say there was a man with incredible debilitating pain across his \nentire body. A doctor suggests a solution that would remove the pain, but \nalso all of his senses (like touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing).\nThere is a scale by which one can judge whether this \"solution\" is the \nbetter choice to make. It measures \"quality of life\".\n\nWhen you consider the two possible states of being, in one your experience \nof life is neutral, softened or non-existent, and in the other it is very \nnegative. It would seem obvious which choice should be made: Remove the \npain & senses.\n\nThere is another scale that can be used here. It measures \"value of \nliving\". This scale isn't based on your experience of life, but what you're \ncapable of doing with it by will. If the pain was continuous or \ndebilitating to the extent that the man cannot move/communicate, both \noptions would have the same value on this scale, but in any other case the \nbetter choice would clearly be: Keep the pain & senses.\n\nPeople tend to use both of these scales in the judgments they make about \nthemselves, with a heavy emphasis on \"value of living\", but when it comes \nto making judgement about others, the primary scale used is \"quality of \nlife\".\n\nSo did MD make the right decision to allow for this change in his brain? I \nthink you'd need both scales to answer that question, but that's not \npossible. With our limited knowledge of MD's life, we may not know what the \nvalues might have been.",

In those cases;\nA. Nobody gave consent\nB. The experimentation was known to be harmful (often deadly)\nC. The procedures were needlessly cruel and not intended in anyway to cure \nanything. \n\nFor example, the Japanese systematically submerged people in ice baths and \ntimed how long it took them to die of hypothermia. They also performed live \nvivisections and had people raped purposefully to observe the affects of \nSTDs. (Seriously the list of things done at Unit 731 reads like a horror \nnovel).\n\nHaving said all that, some of the data the Japanese and Nazi's gathered is \nstill of medical relevance today, mainly because it couldn't be gathered \nany other way. That's not a statement of support, just an unsettling fact. \n\nAnyway, I don't object to what was done to HM. Risky medical procedures \nalways have a chance of going seriously wrong. As long as they exhausted \nother options and he was made fully aware of the danger, the ultimate \ndecision was his to make. \n\nGathering data after the experiment was done was also vital for other \npeople in future that might be in HM's situation, or have other \nneurological conditions.",

Only once in awhile do we learn something \ninteresting, like a elegant story in english, or a mighty sparta vs athen \nwar in history, or hands on expirence with learning how to make different \npathways with circuits in science, or actually a useful lesson in math. But \nthose are only a couple of lessons out the year. Mainly, it is teach to the \ntest.\n\nWe learn a quick lesson, notes, homework, pre test, test, repeat with new \nlesson. How long do we do that? For TWELVE YEAAARRSSS.\n\nMost of us dont realise that this \"\"\"education\"\"\" system is not.... \nEducation. Its called schooling because it is schooling. What is public \nschooling? I think we forget that, US adopted this technique from prussia, \nwhich is now germany. They created this schooling system to have better \ncitizens at then end, to assert conformity. They wanted the soldiers to \nlisten and obey all orders; because in the war zones the soldier's would \nkind of fight for themselves, which is a natraul survival program we have, \nespecially when adrenaline is kicking.\n\nThey created the schooling system, with the. Chopped up schedual, and the \nbells, and the authority, and all these damn rules. Its not really for \nteaching in a honest way, its more of creating the same standerd citizen \nthat can do the job, but can't think for himself or question anything.\n\nYou know, every year is a hard year in school. Im glad... SOOOO FUCKING \nGLAD, that i only have 2 years left till im 'free' of the prison.... But \nthats just direct prison, once you are released into the \"real world\" its \njust another massive prison on a bigger scale. But we have the illusion \nthat we are free buuuutttt, not really.\nI dont wanna make this to long but last point.\n\nI JUST turned 16, and if i said this to most students, or teachers, or even \nadults; i would be called crazy. Im so thankful and humble for the \noppratunity to 'awaken' has come my way. The interent is such a great place \nand you learn so much. I dont think i would know reality if i did not have \ninternet. Tell me, if germans during the nazi created jewish concentration \ncamps, had internet like today; would they support what was happening? You \nthink they honestly KNEW what was happening? Internet holds so much \ninformation from others; im honestly humble to live in this generation.\n\nLet me close this out, wayyy too long.\n\nIm sure i dont know everything yet, but im sure as hell awake. In the \nclassroom, you cant even fucking talk about something unless its what the \nteacher WANTS you to talk about. How crazy is that? I need a bathroom \npass..... To excuse my bodily functions? Are you kidding me? You should be \nable to just tell your teacher that you need to use the bathroom, then sign \nout. And thats just being generous, you should be able to just say bye and \ngo. I know if everyone did that it would be chaos, but who cares.\n\nI could ramble all day but i think you get the point... Not really a rant \non you, just felt like typing and typing and typing, haha.\n\nI know there are good teachers, because i also had some good teachers that \nactually want you to learn and are caring.... But within the system, you \nare still the authority figure, and since when in history do you have to \nlisten to an authority figure unless its your parents? Question. Why do we \nobey anyways? Because what? Maybe because public school has taught us to \nobey since we were 3-4 untill 18.\n\nOKAY OKAY im done......)::$:)/!:&:$:&:$ hejshdksdshs jeez so hard to \nstop.... Have a good day bye..",
