You are correct about the unemployment which \nthey declined and fought to keep me from getting.  When I went to the state \nthough they decided that since I had never been disciplined in 7 years, \nshowed no pattern of insubordination, and they were asking me to work past \nmy scheduled shift they shouldn't have fired me and i got my unemployment. \nThey threaten people with firing because they know it scares people.  They \nknow their employees are living week to week and the prospect of being \nfired is terrifying.  I knew other people over the years who had gotten \nfired for nonsense and unfortunately just accepted it when their \nunemployment was denied, not realizing they could or not wanting to deal \nwith fighting for it. \n\nAlso don't think that when they were asking people to work over their shift \nit meant we were getting over time.  we weren't.  As soon as you hit 40 \nhours they would come and tell you to go home.  Which lead to work not \ngetting done, which lead to other people having to stay past their shifts. \n Nothing like going to work everyday (or night I was 3rd shift) and not \nknowing when you were going to get to go home and being strong-armed with \nthreats if you had to go home when your shift was actually supposed to end. \n It just created an entire shift of people who would pretty much rather die \nthan come to work. You could cut the negative vibe in that place with a \nknife every night.\n\nOh I almost forgot the whole story.  They added to my exit form after I \nsigned it.  They made up a story that I yelled and cursed and even tried to \nstart a physical fight with management.  Which was totally false and I \nobviously wouldn't have signed the exit had their little fiction been \nthere. During the hearing I was able to prove it was a lie because the \nmanagement who testified to this couldn't keep their story straight when I \nwas able to question them about it.  It was pretty comical the adjudicator \nwas pretty sicked by them.\n\nNow this is just anecdotal evidence.  Im just one person who worked with a \ngroup of people at one store.  I cant speak for every walmart employee, but \nthis was my experience.\n\nIn the end though if the driver was on walmarts clock they are liable. ",
