The whole point is that the screen can form \nbecause there's a certain distance between your eyes and the glasses. \nLenses are in direct contact with your eyes, and there would be \ndifficulties with the sound. Also I'd imagine there would be some health \nproblems with using them. Like computerscreens today, you are focusing your \neyes on one spot in space for a longer period of time, which is very \nstraining. Also, do we need all of this stuff? I'll admit that this is \npretty remarkable, but aren't there other problems that require innovative \ntechnical solutions? Call me someone who idealises the past, but I don't \nsee how certain developments are that beneficial to humankind at all.",
