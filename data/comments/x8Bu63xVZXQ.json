Who can say unless you are in the groups. No one has \nthe right to say they are gone or died or what ever. Do you know for a fact \n(Like 100%) that all Assassins and Templars are dead? Like I said no one \nknows unless you are in the groups. And seeing the news and searching up \nfor facts I really bet there is a group out there hiding and controlling \neveryone. I know I don't have 100% fact yet but think the USA and China and \nmany others come up as a group to make world wide laws. Some may disagree \nbut we all have our right as humans to pick our own paths. That brings me \nto the comments about god. No one knows anything about god unless you died \nand seen him. So no one has right to say he does or does does not exist. I \nam trully in pain to see everyone fighting over \"gods\" How do you all know \nthat there is one or not? How do you know there not a high form of humans \nteleporting us to a new planet? Have you thought of that? What I am trying \nto say don't make fun of people if they don't think \"God\" is real hear what \nthey have to say other then jumping the gun and starting a fight over \nsomething that no one knows about other then the one who have past.\ufeff",

Odd to find something so insightful in the \ncomments of YT. Portugal was indeed important, enough so that had things \nturned out a little differently, they'd still be a major super power today. \nThey sure gave it a good run. The history for the region at the time is \nactually an interesting story if you take the time to learn about it.The \nrole it had in the world is often understated because it is overshadowed by \nthe spanish inquisition.\n\nIt's a shame really, because AC is not the only game that could have done \nthis justice. One could argue that portugal was the lifeblood of spain and \nthat this era in it's history is worthy of just as much romanticism as our \nown american history, if not more so. They did indeed pioneer many great \ndiscoveries and were a very active part of the world as whole at the time. \nWhile the spainsh get the credit for having a sense of flare, it was \nportugal that more or less made spain the powerhouse it became.\n\nWhile portugal is by no means gone, Rodrigo Rodrigues is right to call the \nera a golden age for them. It is my humble opinion that we do not hear of \ngreatness from them as much now because they were so invested as a nation \nat that time. Much like the french revolution, the aftermath of the age of \ndiscoveries left protugal a changed place. Power struggles were extremely \ncommon at the time and it had a cost.\n\nAs for the knights templar claim, I feel this is legitimate.. though with a \ncaveat. As is the case with any order of idealists in hiding, the templars \nwere no longer the force they had been and the transfer to portugal was \nmuch like a sister group taking command. Perhaps they hoped to regain their \nold glory in a new home; perhaps not. What can be said is that the original \ngroup has been crushed. In any war/take over, there are always some people \nthat remain, but as long as you can destroy a basis of power well enough, \nyou tend to interrupt direction.\n\nAdditionally, any group that becomes a large enough force to be a threat or \ngain such fame is going to have off shoots. The emergence of templar \nsub-groups is completely likely, but this does not mean the templars are \ntemplars in the same fashion as we think of them now. Many templar \nsub-groups were in a state of disunity in the aftermath of their fall. Even \nif they found a new home, it would have been unwise to act too openly. \nFunding ships and having agendas makes sense, but they could not flaunt \ntheir power as they had before.",

For example, I believe the concept of \nJihaad is an evil and unnecessary act, but Alqueda, and other muslim \nextremists don't necessarily view it that way, they view their cause as \nrighteous and holy. Though America tried to avoid being involved in World \nWar 2, when we were finally dragged into it we committed some pretty fucked \nup stuff, in the name of bringing down a tyrant. We nuked two major \nJapanese cities, without giving them a chance to evacuate, killing an \nuntold number of civillians, through the eyes of history we were justified, \nbecause it helped end a long bloody war, but in the immediate event the \nJapanese probably thought of us as monsters, we put hundred of thousands of \nAsian-Americans in internment camps because we were afraid they would \nsympathize with their \"Home Country\" but again through the biased eyes of \nhistory, we were justified. Let's go back even further to the Japanese Edo \nperiod, a period of civil war in which eventually the Ashikaga Shogunate \nwas overthrown. Oda Nobunaga wished to do away with the Feudal system, and \nunite Japan under a single banner. He believed, that due to Japan's \nXenophobic nature, his nation had closed itself off to great and \nunimaginable wonders, through the eyes of history, he's viewed as a \nheartless monster, but in his eyes he was truly justified in his actions. \nSo again, no one is truly good or evil, the actions of humans are based \nentirely upon their own convictions. So, it's clear you're either too \nstupid to understand this, or are just a troll.",

Anyway \nfuck yeah i will respond that is what i do! from the very start well i do \nbelieve the assassin's did use the hidden blade since they where called \nhidden blade making the witness don't notice on how they kill there target \nwhen there close that they kill there target sometime in public and not a \nlot of people would know the secret tricks they use to kill there target \nreason why i believe they do use the hidden blade even any other witness \ncan't explain on how they kill there target when there close. And daggers \nand poison yeah!! i think i am seen them using such a weapon to kill there \ntarget but in killing there target in public some time is got to be a \nhidden blade to kill it faster right! i just believe they did use such a \nhidden weapon even thought witness can't see it that why they call it \nhidden blade. I guess a hidden blade in your belt and other things you say \nis a good way of killing your target faster in public after all! so it \nwould take very long to make the hidden blade in your hands well i do \nbelieve that!",

Wherever Knights Templars built or funded the \nbuilding of great buildings, Freemasons were heavily involved; from the \nMiddle East, through France, Italy Portugal, Spain, England, Scotland \nFrance and other European countries.\n\nThe Illuminati aren't even related to either one in anyway shape or form. \nThe Illuminati came way after the Templar's and Freemason's and had a much \ndifferent agenda on their minds.",

The building also has a flag-pole with a white flag \nand a BIG RED TEMPLAR CROSS on it. There is also some side-doors with a \nTEMPLAR CROSS on it.

Look, if it really were a secret we wouldn't know \nabout it now would we?\n\nI love how this +Prehistorik Kryptonian guy thinks we don't know there are \nthings we can't explain, the difference is we actually try while he sits on \nhis ass and bows his head. I hate pious, ignorant assholes who think \nthey're better than everyone else and seem to have some sort of knowledge \nwe 'lesser beings' can't comprehend. Well, I'd like to see a complete moron \nlike him try to explain string theory or write an in-depth analysis of the \nlaws of inertia and gravity, instead, he says 'I don't care, things fall \nand things fly.'\n\nPoint is, unless you're gonna ask why instead of say 'I dun care becuz \nGawd.' then honestly you have no right to even speak about how we don't \nknow anything. Because firstly if we don't know anything, then what does \nthat mean about you who knows less than us? And secondly without us, you \nknow, the people who supposedly claim to know everything but know nothing \nyou wouldn't have a computer or internet, you wouldn't have cars, \nairplanes, trains, TV, cable, electricity, etc...\n\nOh, and you wouldn't be able make yourself look like a complete tool and a \nblatantly arrogant moron on YouTube.\n\nAnd lastly, we're not acting like we know everything, no, that would be you \nfor assuming that we DO know everything, and when we say we that we don't \nknow, you simple (as simple minds may do) say 'God! I'm right and I always \nam!'. We never claimed that we understand everything, in fact I claim the \nopposite, that what we know on the grand scale of things is next to \nnothing, that we're still learning. But you know, you claim to know \neverything and anything because 'dah buyrble tell muh so'. And the you're \nnot Christian thing? Yeah sure, so what does it say in your Qur'an? Yeah... \nAnd if you were 'agnostic' or atheist, you wouldn't be acting like a child.\n\nWhen you go on to insult us you need to take into account that atheists \nhave done nothing but make your life as an ignorant shit easier.\nMedicine, technology and industrialization are all byproducts of inquiring \nminds such as Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Bill Nye, Thomas Edison, Henry \nFord and even Katherine Hepburn all have two things in common: They're all \nbrilliant people who know that while they're smart, there's also so much \nmore to learn, and they're all atheists.\n\nAnd calling me a faggot? Well, I don't take offense to it personally seeing \nas to how I'm not gay and it only makes you look like a homophobe, so \nactually... Keep calling me a faggot, it only degrades your image further.\nAnd sorry about the 'late response' there's this thing called 'College'. \nAnd I previously didn't have time to respond to complete and utter \nnonsense, there were others more deserving of my time.",

The \nHashashin order that you are talking about was real, but their actual name \nwas \"al-da\u2019wa al-jadida\" (Arabic for \"New Doctrine\"). Their enemies called \nthe Hashashins because it was Arabic meaning \"Grass User\". Hashish was a \ntype of drug that the al-da\u2019wa al-jadida would use before Assassinations to \nreduce the feelings of pain. So they were called Grass User's. Assassin is \nliterally the modernized word of pot head haha. The modern term of \n\"Assassin\" Comes from the 19th century where stories based off of the real \nHashashins were made and through translation errors it lead to the name \nAssassin. \ufeff",

So of course it would be seen as insulting. Plus, I am \nfamiliar with the Arabic language (Being of Arabic decent myself), \nHashashin does mean Grass User (Well, not the exact translation but \ntranslation is difficult sometimes. Especially with a language like Arabic).\n\nRemember though, the al-da\u2019wa al-jadida did not call themselves Hashashin, \neven though Hashish was not the primary drug they consumed it was the most \nfamous according to their enemies and so they were named Hashashin (Grass \nUser, Hashish itself means Grass) by their enemies.

As a result, some believe that the word \n\"assassin\" originated from the name of this sect, a connection that's not \ndifficult to make in light of their legendary brutality. The order was \nheadquartered in Alamut, located in the Alborz Mountains of Persian Iran, \nand from this strategic center, they spread their operations out over \nvarious regions in Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Syria.\n\nToward the end of the 11th century, Ismaili leader Hassan al-Sabah formed \nhis assassin's group, primarily as a counter-movement to al-Musta'li, the \nnew caliph of the Egyptian Fatimid Empire. The empire had undergone a \npolitical coup, through which the ailing Caliph's younger son, al-Musta'li, \nwas appointed the new ruler. The rightful heir apparent, al-Musta'li's \nolder brother Niz\u0101r, was subsequently killed in an attempt to wrest back \ncontrol of the empire. Hassan had been a supporter of Niz\u0101r, and this \nepisode is the reason why the Hashashin have also been called the Nizari.",

Persians in the Sassanian \nEmpire and Greeks in the Byzantine Empire were already making great leaps \nin science, mathematics and art. It wasn't until the Arab invasion that the \nUmayyad Caliphate instituted racially suppressive laws against Iranian and \nGreek people(something the Persians never accepted other cultures and races \nof people to cooperate) that halted all progression in educational \ndiscoveries called the Two Centuries of Silence. The Abbasid Caliphate only \ncame to power because of Iranians who were promised freedom and \nself-governance by the Abbasids. Thus without Iranian rebels the Umayyads \nwould of still hung onto their throne. \nOh and Lastly, The mountainous parts of Iraq are in the north which are \nclaimed by Kurds which are also ethnic Iranian people.

The means by which cannabis \naccomplishes this amazing feat is by producing a thick, sticky resin that \ncoats its leaves and flowers. This protective canopy prevents \nlife-sustaining moisture from disappearing into the dry air.\nBut this thick stocky resin is not an ordinary goo.

It is a god to \nsome and a devil to others. It is all of these things and more. This resin, \nthis shield against the sun, this sticky goo... hashish. The Persian \nfounder of a religious order of Sufis, discovered hashish in A.D. \n1155. Opium in Persia is widely available, and the country has the highest \nper capita number of opiate addicts in the world.
