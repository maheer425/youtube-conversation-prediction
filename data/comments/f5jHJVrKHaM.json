If you are, this is a weird \ndefinition of brainwashing, and frankly is one which I am simply unwilling \nto grant.\n\nFrom Merriam-Webster:\n\nBrainwash:\n\n1:  a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, \nsocial, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting \nregimented ideas\n2:  persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship\n\nI will accept either of these two definitions (though I vastly prefer the \nfirst, as that is the most common usage, it seems). However, to state that \nanything humans do as a result of peer pressure is brainwashing is \nridiculous. If this were the case, then everything anyone does *at all* \nwould be brainwashed behavior. If you can name me one thing that anyone \ndoes that is not influenced by what their peers do, please enlighten me.",

Months. Years. And all of the sudden, you wonder.. where \ndid my life go? What did I spend it on?\n\nHow do i know my life was well spent? meaningful?\n\nWell its funny. Because I didnt start out passionate about this stuff. I \nthink i told you before, I was agonostic. Still kinda don't believe the \nvirgin birth stuff. But recognize that it is irrelevant for me to believe. \n\nMeanings. come from Words. Vice versa. Without words...we are monkeys. We \nwould not be able to do ANY of the complex things we do. I come from a \nfamily of linguists who've always had an appreciation for language...and \nscholars like Noam Chomsky. (atleast in terms of philosophy) i \nthink Atheists can learn a lot from him. Instead of people like Richard \nDawkins. \n\nAnd if you understand the power that MEANING and WORDS... then u can \nunderstand why beliefs are so important.\n\nSo.. i knew believing in God was important....always..but i always wondered \n(as any agnostic atheist would...) for WHO??? who is it important for?? is \nit a grand mind control scheme? thus important for ppl in power? or...is it \nREAL? and its important for me?...hmmmm,,,\n\nThen I realized...it could very well be both. And this was made very clear, \nafter i finally decided to read the bible...\n\nSo ..Certain? No. passionate? maybe. Believing. Yes. :)",

No one with a \nbrain would try to take guns away from a country with such a strong \ndisgusting gun culture because we'd have a (failed) rebellion on our hands  \n\nThere's a difference between gun prohibition and drug prohibition.  If I \nsmoke a joint or drink alcohol the only one at any risk if I'm not driving \nis myself, and that is certainly not the purpose. A gun is a weapon, that's \nall it's for, its only point is damage. There need to be standards for \nthat.  You should need a license to own a gun,  you should need to undergo \nsome sort of psychiatric evaluation and a criminal background check.  That \nis the most extreme position I have ever heard out of anyone.  And it \nlikely wouldn't even really be unconstitutional \"A WELL REGULATED militia \nbeing necessary to the security of a free state,\" is how the second \namendment starts off, I say if your goal is to create a militia, and you're \nregulating it, you should probably regulate the mentally unstable and \nviolent criminals out of said militia, and it wouldn't be that unreasonable \nto make sure they know how to use the weapon they'd apparently use as a \nmilitia soldier.\n\nThere is also a prohibition on driving without a license.  Does anyone \nconsider that a failed prohibition? I mean I' sure some people drive \nwithout a license, but in general people don't. And there's an actual \npractical reason to own a car, a gun for self defense is often just \ndecreasing your safety from yourself to sate your paranoia of others \ninvading your home. ",

The Eternal Leader was absorbing the hateful anti-revolution \nbullets with his stomach, and converting them to the eternal light of \nJuche! Eventually, the soldier reached the americans.and heroically \nslaughtered all of them. As he turned around, he noticed the Eternal Leader \nwas gone !!! save for a shining little spot in the grass. As he watched, \nthat spot transformed into a field of beautiful and glorious revolutionary \nroses, to mark the spot where the Eternal Leader had appeared. That soldier \nnever forgot the shining love and care the Eternal Leader showed for him \nthat day, as we must never forget the eternal love and care our Supreme \nCommander shows for us !!!",

Besides the idolation of the Great Leader it \nlearns me that Juche is nationalistic and xenophobic in intend (*I already \nknew that*) and that it has strong racial tendicies too, due to it partly \nbased on Japanese fascist imperial thinking (*I did not know that yet*). It \neven goes so far as too force abortions of babies from mixed N-Korean and \nethnic Chinese origin.\n\nI am not clear on the reasoning behind the latter though, besides a rasicm \nreason. I have often wondered why the Chinese consider N-Korea as \nfriend-nation. It is clear from events in the last decade they do not \nalways see eye to eye. The only reason I can think of, is that this may be \nbecause of the state-of-war that still exists and the presence of the USA \nin S-Korea.\n\n*As this for the discussion...*\nI think that most discussion between theists and Atheist often overlook the \ninherit human need to incooperate cultural thinking in ideology/theology. A \ndiscussion purely based on ideology/theology may often go bust as culture \nis overlooked, by both sides. Theologians do not realise much of the \naspects of their religious thinking has cultural origins and Atheists tend \nto overlook to even mention the difference of the factualy religion and the \nover-time changes made on this due to cultural influences.\n\nThe latter would go so little far on silly things as for christians the \nadoption of christmas in the religious-experience, which is based on \nancient European heathen celibration around the mid-winter tree,... and \ntotally so far in such things as to see Jesus as a god where in early \nchristianity this was not always seen to be the case.\n\nIt would seem to be clear to me it is more often the case that culture \nforms the religion more so than religion shapes the culture.\n\nWhich would ofcourse be an odd thing if you see claims now that the \nbiblical scriptures are key to the religious experience.\n\nIt is incoherent with the thruth of reality.",

So where did the rocks and water come from? \nEventually you get to stellar material being flung out into the cosmos. And \nwhere did this stellar material come from? It takes a lot more faith to \nbelieve in the Quantum Mechanics idea that matter can spontaneously form \nout of nothing than it does to believe in God. Who, by the way, isn't an \n\"invisible sky person\", but rather the causation of existence. God is \nexistence. God is in you, God is in the cloud, God is in everything and \nbeyond. Since the universe doesn't benefit God in any way, it's logical to \nassume that the motive for creation is love--a beneficence which must \nexpress itself beyond oneself. Hell, by the way, is simply \"heaven\" for \nthose who reject God's love. God doesn't send anyone to hell. People send \nthemselves to hell. People gravitate towards that which they venerate. If \nyou only venerate yourself or the pleasure this world gives you at the \nexpense of others, then you reject the reality of why you exist.",

Every country has skeletons in their closet \nno matter how peaceful they try to make themselves out to be.  Every \ncountry in the world is guilty of slavery in one form or another, and it \nwasn't just the africans either it was every nationality and race.  Nations \nare built on conquest, do you think the Anglos and Saxons regret nearly \nwiping out the Britons?  As for the Natives loosing there land fault lies \non both sides as a lot of the deals the Natives stuck with the settlers was \nto screw over other tribes they had rivalries with most of the time, I am \nnot saying it was right I am just saying we were both playing the same game \nand it didn't turn out very well for one of the parties.  As for \nwars...well every nation does them sometimes for dumber reasons than we \ngave.  Prime example would be a war that was fought in Africa between \nBritain and a group belonging to a exiled king over a gold stool that cost \nover 2,000 lives.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unfortunate but necessary \nevils, the mentality of Japan at the time was that they would fight to the \nlast and only surrendered when they said we were using \"Cruel Bombs\", other \nthan that they had no intention of surrender and it would cost a hell of a \nlot more lives if we dragged on the war any longer.  Does any of this \nexcuse our actions, no but it should offer some perspective of the world. \n It is a messy place full of deceptions, brainwashing, and decisions of a \nquestionable nature. ",

North Korea will \nstill try to retain as much power for as long as possible, though North \nKorea has significantly improved since Kim Jong Il's demise. Kim Jong Il \nironically never wanted to be the leader in the first place and was never \ntrained for it. His half-brother was originally thought to be the \nsuccessor, since Kim Jong Il himself studied film in university rather than \nsomething more politically oriented. Kim Jong Un is more like a mixture of \nhis Grand Father and Father.

They \npurposely allow certain people to belive in a God of some sort and a devil, \nthen they use that as proof that they are bullshit!! Evidence, there is \nnone for people who live in brainwash! Here's an example: The demons (they \nwant everyone suffering in hell like them, seperated from God, as they are) \nthey allow a person to believe in god who payed for our sins and themsleves \nand thier master Satan, this person goes out and tells many people about \nthis stuff, and the people believe it, but eventually the demons tell him a \nlie (it comes as a thought in his mind, but as the accuall truth) that the \nworld will end in 2004. The demons make it convincing through the daily \nevents happening, and so the man goes out to the same people who believed \neverything he told them that the world will also end on that date. The \npeople believe that too! But when 2004 comes the world deosn't end now deos \nit! So the people tell themselves well if he was worng about the world \nending then all that stuff about a god and devil must be bullshit.

We all live in sin. Even fear is a great sin, so \nis lust for money (we all need that one) Eating junkfood is a sin, loving \nthings outside of God's word s sin, sex outside of marrige sin, smoking \nweed especially if you get the full high and trips like me, is sorcery or \nwitchcraft opens doors to demons, cigarettes getting drunk, beatin up \npeople hating people, being jealous, interested in the occult, acting like \nsomeone else, stealing, being fooled by the lie, worshipping things that \nare not god, those are all sins that I love to do! I don't want to repent \nof my sins, (which is the rod leading to heaven) the demons have given me \nan entire life of reasons to not do it! You want more evidence!? Then just \nlook around you look at the world. How many people who follow the lord \nchrist, are acually loved by others and given on the media. Many of them \nare ignored, framed, you name it. The demons and Satan have always \nbranwashed people. When people thought the earth was flat, and that all \nsicknesses have no logic, that killing witches or people who dabble with \ndemons will get them to heaven, they have all been brainwashed by demons. \nMany people who think they are doing what god wants are accually doing what \nSatan and his demons want. We live a life where we cannot hear god or see \nhim. We all live in sin, and through our sins demons are invited. If a \ndemon or demons are cast out of a persos life through the power of christ, \nthey are temporarily kicked out of the person and back to hell (the center \nof this planet) where Satan tortures them more for failing to bring a \nperson to hell and lost the person in the hands of god. Hell is the worst \nplace ever, heven is the very opposite, they are on the farthest ends ever. \nAnd in this earth there is both God as the holy spirit that's still him and \nchrist, that's him again, and there's demons and Satan, and sin. When we \nlive in sin which we obviously have since sin entered mankind, e live with \ndemons who choose what we will believe in. A person's genious idea's always \nhave a boost of help from demons. Demons only want every person in hell, \nand not learning about christand repenting, or most importantly not doing \nit. If getting a person rich (allowing himt o become rich) get's hm and \nmany others to hell, then rich they will make him be. Whatever gets people \nto hell with more sins to pay, that's what they want. Not so much how it's \ndone. So if you accually think that the demons will allow me to give you \nevidence so you people accually believe is like asking the victum's father \nto hug and love the person who tortured his son for weeks in the most \nhorrible tragic ways, and killed him. And even more to ask him to give all \nhis money to him. So you're asking me to give you evidence when I'm a \nperson who lives in sin, and with demons. How the fuck am I suppose to give \nyou evidence. The only evidence is the world around you. I had phases in my \nlife hwere I barley had OCD, and I had phases where I had too much OCD. I'm \none of those people who lives life on the far ends!",

                    "text": "+Logan F. You don't shit about that stuff. We live in a sinful world with \ndemons, who decide what we will believe in! Because they were thrown out of \nheaven for sinning, and into their torments in hell. They are restricted \nfrom all that is of god. And sin and god are two seperate things! Satan \nfirst sinned by not obeying God's word. Not bowing down to man. he got \nthrown out of th beautiful paradise fooling his angels to go with him, and \nthus they were thrown into the pit. They ever so hated God, missed heaven, \nand were very jealous of humans who got a good life and one with God. They \nwanted all people in hell at the very least. But when god had to allow the \nfirst two male and woman to make a choice because of freewill, there was \nSatan's opportunity to lead man into sin. By telling them half lies half \ntruths. They did not listen to god, and ate from the forbidden fruit, the \nknowledge between good and evil. The whole world filled with sin after \nthat. And mankind was plagued with sin. God though payed for our sins in \nthe human form so people won't go to hell. Sin cannot be with god. And sin \nseperates people from god. Satan and his demons they want want God's \nchildren to be taken away from him. And when you die unrepented of your \nsins you go to hell. And once a person goes to hell he is no longer God's \nchild just like Satan and the demons. And demons cannot be taken back to \nheaven, they can only live in sin. When we sin they can enter through our \nsins, ias an invitation. Christ died for our sins only when a person \ncompletely turns away from his entire sinfull life, and choosing Jesus \nChrist and willing want to do that, do they have the power over demons. And \nthose people do not hate anyone. God also deosn't sent people to hell \nbecause he wants to punicsh them, no he suffers for every person that goes \nto hell, he wants even the worst person to be taken to heaven. It's Satan \nwho wants God's people no longer God's people and taken into hell. I could \nhave explained this better. When a person who hallucinates (demons who \ncontrol the mind because of many reasons) if that person thinks he is \nhearing God and God is telling him what to do, in most cases that is a \ndemon pretending to be God. Demons are too clever for you to even get your \nhead around. They have known about molecules, DNA, atoms, and even that the \nearth is round, since before people rode horses. They fool people into \nthinking that people back in the day were stupid, and were wrong about \nother stuff, so if therefore people nowadays are figuring out all this \nknowledge then that must mean that there is no God or Satan. Yeah people \nare fooled now and so were they fooled in the old days. Satan has alot to \ndo with this futuristic modern time. Do you know how long and cleverly the \ndemons have been manipulating people. And all their time spent esspecially \nSatan's to get all people into hell, and not let them be saved. Have you \never noticed how different religions are causing many problems or people \nare arguing about. Satan wants the real truth entering in people's minds. \nObviously havng many different religions just makes the deception worse. \nAnd trust me demons can operate in logic. Like OCD demonic torment, which \nthe demons manipulate the biochemistry in the brain, and torment people \nwith thoughts, and crazy compulsions. If you add something to the brain \nthat highers dopamine or cerotonin, then yes science works, but that deos \nnot mean that there are no demons and no God. Science it seems is a great \ntool for Satan. It may be good at times and helpful. But the outcome is \nthat you are fooled into lies because of the truths. And all ghosts in \nthose paranormal reserches they're all demons maskerating as ghosts. One \nperson may think he has contacted his dead relative! But accually that is a \ndemon or the demons who knew the person all too well who watched over him \nhis entire life. Accually this is just a simple example, a real one, but \nthey are much more clever than that. Of coarse the convincing reasons for \nyou to not believe are probebly good, they can be much more intense than \nthat. It's not like god will accually tell you what is true and what isn't \nbecause we''re all living in sin and with demons, who suffer so much being \ndemons and want us all in hell. Sin is enough to get people there, \nseperated form god. If you had my OCD you would learn that these demons are \njust unbelievable with their cleverness and talent! It definetly deosn't \nseem so hard to get a person rejecting that stuff. Oh and demons do give us \nthoughts or tamper with them in the most unnoticable ways. Especially like \nme with OCD! See ya!",

Sure, it might threaten, possibly to \nre-assure its more extreme allies (as is the case with Russia), but if it \nactually came down to it, this isn't the 1950s, China and the US are \nintermingled, and it would hurt China for multiple reasons to fight US \nforces not interfering with China:\n1) It could lead to a US/China war, in which China has a very real \npossibility of losing, or at least losing face.\n2) If economic ties were broken off, it would hurt China considerably more \nthan the US, which suddenly doesn't have to pay multiple trillions of \ndollars.",

His logic has two objectives:\n- 1. Manipulate, scare and control his own people. North Koreans believe \nthat the DPRK is the richest, most powerful and best nation in the world. \nKim Jong Un's threats against other nations are a way of reinforcing that \nbelief to their people and also scaring them (\"North Korea is the most \npowerful nation in the world. How could I ever stand up to it\")\n- 2. Warning America to back off. It is also a way of telling America to \nback off and not mess with North Korean affairs.\n\n- North Korea does not intend to achieve world domination, they know it is \nimpossible and if they try to achieve it it would be suicidal.\n- As I said before Kim Jong Un does not wish for a large scale war, he \nwants to stay in power and therefore does not want to get into a war he \ncould lose (if there is a war with America the DPRK will lose, right after \nkilling hundreds of millions of people). He does want South Korea, but he \nis not going to get into a war over it unless he can win (which is not now, \nperhaps when America is busy fighting another war with a large power).\n\nYou cannot just neutralise North Korea's military, their people are so \nbrainwashed that they will fight to the death, all 25 million of them. \nRemember that the DPRK is a nuclear state, they will use their nukes \nagainst South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and any other nation \nfriendly towards America which is in range. If America fires ballistic \nmissiles towards North Korea it could be seen by both China and Russia as \nan attack on themselves.

Now if only we had about \nanother 150 million intelligent people like you in society, we might not \nhave the problems we have these days.\n\nOh and by the way, spanking shouldn't be illegal per se', but restricted to \nopen palm across butt. That way, as a parent, when administering \ndiscipline, you have more control over how hard you swat the child's \nbottom. Using a belt or anything else and it is impossible to tell if \nyou're disciplining the child, or just plain hurting them. Dr. Spock's \nmethods do not work. I've seen this first hand. My mother tested my butt as \nthe \"Seat of Knowledge\" plenty of times and I am a better person for it. \nHowever my father believed in beating a child senseless, as he did with me \non many occasions. So yes I do know the \"Difference\" between proper \ndiscipline, and improper discipline. To many parents these days let their \nchildren get away with way too much and we have a great deal of \"Wild ones\" \namongst our collective youth these days. Open palm across butt at least \nallows a parent to feel how hard they're hitting their child. If you are \nhurting your own hand, you are hitting them way too hard. Discipline,.. but \nin moderation. No discipline at all has its vices as well,... obvious \nvices. Too much discipline results in bullying as the child can easily feel \nthat they are being bullied. I know this first hand. Plus a young man I \nonce knew was quite the nasty bully in school. One day I followed him home \nin secret with my friend. We planned on \"teaching\" him a lesson for picking \non us. That's when we got to see how his father treated him. Needless to \nsay, we told our parents. The Department of Children and Families was \ncalled as a result. Three months later we saw him at school again. What \nshocked me the most was he thanked us for getting him out of that hell. I \nguess it was a nice surprise.\n\nI believe in moderate discipline, not flat out beating a child. No child \nshould have to go through that. But the worst sort of abuse isn't spanking. \nNo, verbal abuse can be far worse. Words can cut like steel. Example, I \ndon't remember every instance when my father beat me, but I do recall damn \nnear every nasty thing he ever said to me. And trust me, it was a lot. Sad \nto say, but if he died tomorrow, it wouldn't matter to me. My mother on the \nother hand, that would affect me real bad. I have many many memories of the \nsupportive and caring things she ever said to me. She spanked me when I \nstepped out of line. She disciplined me when I screwed up, but with her, I \nunderstood \"why\". And that is the key word here. If the child doesn't \nunderstand why, spanking, beating, or grounding, etc. makes little \ndifference. ",

They keep on \nscreaming about North Korea just like the mainstream American politicians \nwho use North Korea or Cuba as scapegoat to hide America's own predatory \nform of capitalism and the horror that lies beneath it. We keep on hearing \nthe same propaganda about starvation in North Korea while 16 million \nAmerican children go to bed hungry every night. We have millions of \nhomeless people in america while North Korea doesn't have a single \nhomeless. Our seniors are taxed on their retirement money and they are \nstill working in their 70s. North Korean seniors are not working and their \nworkers have rights which we don't. North Korea or Cuba don't have \ndiscriminatory education system something that American ruling class uses \nas a weapon to deny the workers a living wage. Rich people's children have \nthe privilege and the opportunities because the vast majority of the \nworking poor are just trapped into doing hard work and being paid less so \nthey can never stop working or be themselves and free to make a choice \nabout doing something they like. How is america has any opportunities for \nthe poor what so ever? How can they afford to have the time and resources \nto earn a decent education and be on a level playing field with the more \nprivileged class who send their children to private schools all their lives \nwhile public education system set poor people up for failure by design. \nSomeone can get a college education for free in a so called third world \ncountry and find jobs in a multinational corporation while we who live in \nthis fake land of opportunities remain stuck into poverty and never get a \nchance to grow. If we bring this up the mainstream white americans would so \nsmartly respond by saying \"oh he or she worked so hard to earn that \nposition\" . Really? Workers are working harder and twice the amount? Is it \nreally about hard work or is it privilege and luck? Where do we have time, \nopportunities and resources to earn the so called skill as rich people say \nto deny the workers their rights? We frequently hear about North Korea \nbeing a prison camp while American prison industrial complex is the largest \nfor profit prison system in the world. It's also a giant labor camp for \nmany industries. America tortures people, uses drones to kill women and \nchildren, spy on its own citizens etc. and commit countless other horrible \ncrimes. I don't see North Korea doing any of that. America has that \nfictitious self appointed enemies(Islamists) to go to wars with countries \nso the tax revenues taken from poor people can go into the pockets of rich \nwar profiteers. America murdered an entire ethnic group( native Indians ) \nso brutally and posses one of the biggest land mass in the world today and \nyet we can't have a decent place to live. We workers are at the mercy of \nthe wealthy slumlords who squeeze us over and over and push us the workers \ninto the brink of extinction. If this is the American dream and the so \ncalled freedom than I'd rather want to die. \ufeff",

The nukes North Korea has \ntested have not been as strong as the ones we dropped on japan during WW2, \nthat's how behind they are.  In detail, the nukes North Korea has tested \nare only 6-7 kiltons in power.  The bombs we dropped in WW2 were 19-22 \nkiltons.  So the US nukes in WW2 were about 3 times more powerful than the \nones North Korea is testing today.  Guess how strong the modern nuke is? \n 50,000 kiltons!

Nothing. Do you know why they get \nnothing? Because they pray to nothing. Every night when you are on your \nbedside you aren't talking to a higher, all-knowing, omnipotent being. You \nare simply talking to yourself. And you think that when something bad \nhappens, it is justifiable by saying it was \"god's will\". The rest of us \npray to no god. How do you think those with great authority got to where \nthey are now? They got off their asses and did shit themselves. They didn't \nask someone to do it for them because they were smart enough to know \nbetter. That is why you will never amount to anything, Duane.

Here is a \nreligion that is NOT driven for the love of any god - NO, do not be fooled! \n They represent a people driven by their own maniacally self centered, \nselfish desires and set up a doctrine based on fear, dogma, and \ndestruction.  The Jews - yes, the Jews - set up this despicable hatred for \nmankind through the primitive, tribal notion that they are the \"chosen\" \nones - they are special above all and therefore \"justified\" to look down \nupon, judge, and destroy anything that is not the same,  \n\nThese ideas grew from a deep inferiority complex that developed into \njealousy and hatred and nothing else.  The Jews even made their god a \njealous, destructive god to justify their behavior.  Why?  Because their \ntribalist mentality couldn't handle the increasingly civilized world.  They \ncould not effectively compete for the power and recognition they wanted and \nthought they deserved to end their suffering.  They instead became \nenslaved, subjugated, dependent, and pressured into inferiority.  \n\nSo, rather than look at themselves and think, \"hmm...maybe we're stuck in \nsome stupid tribal mentality and should grow up to think intelligently \nabout how to end our suffering and work with humanity to achieve ends good \nfor all,\" the Jews, like the true uncivilized tribesmen they were, turned \nagainst mankind and said, \"Oh, no, it must be THEM\" and setup a doctrine of \n\"us vs. them; god vs. wicked mankind\" that inspires hate of the wicked man \n(non-Jews, sinners - in short, everyone else) disguised as love for God. \n The very foundation of Judaism is hatred for all others who are not like \nthemselves.  This is pure tribalism at it's core.      \n\nChristian Jews tried to be more inclusive in their doctrine by inviting all \ngentiles (non-Jews) to share in their salvation primarily in order to \nachieve ends good for all humanity.  This was an enlightened step out of \nthe archaic tribal mentality of their orthodox Jewish roots.  However, the \nignorant tribal Jewish foundation remained: 1) God exists; 2) God is an \nangry jealous god to be feared and worshiped alone; 3) Mankind is sinful \nand unworthy; degraded; 4) The saved are \"chosen\" for heaven vs. heathens \nwho are not; good vs. evil; us vs. them.  Hate disguised as love.  All the \nsame senseless tribal bullshit.",

Majority of Sikh followers deviate from \ndebating about the creation part of religion. In my religion we're taught \nto see the whole human race as one and not to discriminate and have \nprejudices toward anyone. Although that is hard I try as much as possible \nto abide by that rule. I'm proud of my culture and my people because we \ncome from a warrior race and throughout time we have helped and protected \nothers, some who were not even of the same religion to us. An example is \nthe preventing the attempted killing off of the Hindu religion by various \nMuslim Leaders many years ago. I'm really in touch with the history and \nmoral code of my religion. Although I have to admit my knowledge on the \nactual \"factual\" portions of my religion is lacking, other than the 5 \nevils: Lust, Greed, Envy, Attachment and Rage and the belief in One God (Ek \nOnkar). Of course at a young age I was made to be religious by my family. \nBut I was never brainwashed into being a huge prick about my beliefs. I was \ntaught the moral code and the lifestyle that came with the teachings of the \n10 gurus in my religion, such as treating everyone equally, fighting to \nprotect others even if it results in death, donating and giving money to \nthose unfortunate, having strong family values, etc. I invite you to do \nmore research on Sikhism if you'd like. I could care less if my religion is \nwrong on how the world created because I'd rather live by the morals of my \nreligion than be consumed about \"proving\" the faith elements to it. Also I \nlive in Canada, a really culturally diverse nation. Maybe that could have \nan influence on my ways of thinking as well :P",

                    "text": "+mbank2 PART 2 - Sola scriptura is bad.\n\nOne Reason why I am Roman Catholic is because I acknowledged that the bible \nwas initially formed well after Jesus by Catholic (then with no \ndenominations like Rome/Orthodox) Priests and historians.\n\nThey looked at every written document presented to them, which there were \nhundreds if not a few thousand, and selected based on what they believed \nwas divinely inspired (either through revelation or through accuracy to \nJesus' teachings), what was passages that were accurate enough to consider \nJesus as fulfilling the Old Testament prophesies, as well as his own \n(because they believed Jesus did that), and passages that were \nnon-contradictory with what was already decided as accurate as well as \nanything that didn't conflict with Jesus' teachings.\n\nFor example, recently a small ruined script of old paper was found claiming \nJesus had a wife. This was most likely also copied and brought to the \nPriests in Councils (there wasn't just one they met any time multiple other \nwritings were found) and rejected back then due to it not being believed \nthat Jesus was married. As such it should be rejected now for the same \nreasons. \n\nAll that was simply to say there should be no contradictions in the bible \naccording to the men who put it together. What this means is that they way \nthey interpreted the writing made the book absolutely flawless. Therefore \nrather than arguing that there is a contradiction in the bible, people \nshould argue what could those verses or chapters mean such that there isn't \na contradiction as that is most likely how they were depicted back then.\n\nThe issue with this is that anybody can interpret anything they want and \ncall it the \"word of God\". This is why there are so many denominations of \nChristianity (which started during the Protestant reformation). This alone \nis proof that you cannot go sola scriptura, that is \"bible only\" in regards \nto what it means and what you should do. Heck you could even argue that \ngoing bible only to prove God doesn't exist is also discredited since it is \nonly based on your interpretation.\n\nThis is why tradition, a 2000 year old Church, a uniform interpretation, \nand councils and people of Authority are required to make sure that \neverybody is on the same page doing the same thing to avoid confusion. This \nalso includes any moral teachings of the bible which is why we have stopped \nstoning people and things like that. Even if we are wrong on an issue if \nthe Church is presented with sufficient evidence (they are just as stubborn \nas scientists if not more so) they will change their ways (such as the \nevolution link in my part 1) and using the Authoritative ruling and \ngovernment-ish system educate its people of the change such that once again \neverybody is on the same page. \n\nThe Roman Catholic Church is, when it comes down to it, on a permanent \nquest to interpret the bible exactly as the original councilmen did \nincluding any other interpretations that do not contradict with science. \nRemember, we believe that there is a God, and on that assumption this \nperfect interpretation can be achieved as the word of God cannot be \ncorrupted. \n\nShorter Part 3 - It does all come down to faith.\n\nThe reason why many say it all comes down to faith is simply because you \nrequire one assumption to allow everything to fit into place. The \nassumption is, that there is a God. Once that is established, Roman \nCatholicism, in my opinion, has sufficient evidence and a never ending \n\"quest\" (bible interpretation) to prove that Jesus is our God and our \nbeliefs/facts discovered by scientists contradict nothing in the world God \nCreated. So far it has stood the test of countless challenges as well as \nthe test of time and has probably evolved to withstand many arguments with \nadequate replies.\n\n If Dawkins for example walked into the Vatican in the year 1000, he most \nlikely would have absolutely crushed any argument they had and probably be \nexecuted for it. This is why the evolution (haha) of the church has made it \nmore refined, more correct, and to me, less of a reason not to believe. \nRemember, Atheists have existed for just as long as theists.\n\nMatthew 16:18\n\"\"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My \nchurch; and the gates of Hell will not overpower it.\"\n\nThere will never be proof God exists or that he doesn't. But based on not \nevidence but more so what I consider indicators allow me to make the \nassumption that he does exist and hope that I am not mistaken. \n\nHebrews 11:1\n\"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things \nnot seen.\"\n\nIm sorry, there's just so much to say and I need to say it or else there \nare gaps. In fact there still might be so do you have any questions?",

Long Long 2-3 post story incoming.\n\nPart 1 - Everybody makes BS claims to prove the other wrong.\n\nFirst off, this has to be said. The \"evidence\" or lack thereof on both \nsides of the argument are generally worded to sound perfect but in some \ncases are completely missing the point or reasons why the other side \nbelieves in what they believe. Both parties often misunderstand each other \nand that leads to people never believing the other side.\n\nFor example, on the religious side it has been decided among HISTORIANS \nthat Jesus existed, had a following, was killed by Romans, and who's body \nwent missing (resurrection to surreal to be proven with history). Period. \nWas he a magic man who did miracles? No idea but naturally one would think \nno. Many atheists have been bred by Dawkins/Hitchens or people like them to \nbelieve that Jesus was made up using incorrect reasoning like \"oh the bible \nwas written 30-60 years after Jesus so he is a fake\" or \"Taticus is a hoax \ndon't listen\" (even though he was a pagan Roman historian so there \nshouldn't be a bias) . Those allegations simply misunderstand history and \nhow historians track the lives of people in the past. For example, \nConfucius (a Chinese Religious figure) has no writings during his lifetime \nas well but is also considered by historians to be legitimate due to the \nwritings afterwards and other proofs.\n\nOn the Atheist side evolution has literally NOTHING to do with religion and \nany arguments saying it is false is stupid. In fact they never cross paths \never and a lack of belief in God does not correlate to an automatic worship \nof Darwin. Yet Christians still throw this \"its just a theory\" in some sad \nattempt to make Atheists look bad. I for one think this is stupid simply \nbecause if even the Catholic Church accepts evolution as fact, nobody \nshould be allowed to argue. Though naturally, God is involved but don't \ntake what they say the wrong way they basically say it doesn't interfere \nwith religion.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_evolution\n\nIn fact, science in almost all aspects has no correlation with religion and \nyet both sides of the argument try to use science as \"proof\". Really, it \nall comes down to whether you believe in the bible or not, in terms of \nChrist of course.\n\nFinally, if there is 0 proof god exists and also 0 proof he doesn't, that \ndoesn't say anything at all for either side. The score is 0-0. Atheists \nlike to spin that saying then there's no point in believing since there's \nnot even a chance.

As \nI said, it's easy to judge a country harshly when you ignore the wrongs \nyour own country has done. That's called ethnocentrism and is literally a \nbias to judge north Korea from an American perspective. \n\nAlso you demonstrate an ignorance of what pragmatism is. Pragmatism is in \nessence dealing with things in a practical way. The harm that north Korea \nhas done to its people, however bad it may be, does not affect the rest of \nthe world. The harm America has done does affect the rest of the world, and \nthat's seen in many of the problems in the middle East today, or in parts \nof Asia, and even in parts of America. Sure you can argue that morally, \nNorth Korea is a more \"evil\" or brutish place, but pragmatically they have \ndone less harm to the world. Practically speaking I am not, and most other \npeople have not been directly or indirectly impacted by North Korea in a \nnegative way, while we have been by America. \ufeffAmerica was used not because \nof any personal bias of mine, but because reminiscible brought it up.
