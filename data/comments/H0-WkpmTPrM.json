It's all about frame of reference. \n _Most_ good psychologists know this, however.

They will say \"To the best of my knowledge...\" or pad their \nstatements with things like \"This *tends to* be the case that...\"\n\nPeople using lingustic analysis will often believe someone with OCPD is \nlying and dodging the direct question - when, in fact, the person with OCPD \nis doing everything they can to be 100% truthful and consistent (because \nthat's part of their compulsion to rules and order)  \n\nI find it especially difficult when *compelled* to tell the truth.  I would \nbe a nervous wreck if I'm testifying in court because I don't know if what \nI experienced is actually what happened but I can only speak to my \nexperiences!  Example:  Identifying a suspect - \"The man that I saw looked \nlike the defendant.\"  I cannot say he was the defendant - he may have an \nidentical twin brother for all I know.  Or he could have been a \ndoppelg\u00e4nger - all I know is that it looked like him.\n\nI might be inclined to say \"Beyond reasonable doubt - I saw the defendant\" \nbecause that excludes things like doppelg\u00e4ngers - but you see where the \nphrasing starts getting convoluted.",

Dark Matter, UV light \nimbalances, Gravitational waves ( did we ever do follow up on those? It's \nbeen a few months I think....), to name a few, but the point is not \neverything is as \"hard\" as we make it seem. Even physicists admit that \nthings work in mathematics beautifully but in reality they look \"screwy\" to \nquote one. But we do know a TON and that's good. In psychology there are \ndefinitely hard facts. I have a text book full of them. Now if we're \ntalking about being able to accurately predict systems with hundreds and \nthousands and even millions or billions of variables like a human mind, or \neven like societies? We have some insight into those as well, and often \nthose predictions are ACCURATE. Because these things don't let you stop \nthem, you have to observe in real time. You often can't halt \"light\" or \n\"anti-matter\" per se. If you tamper with social circumstances in the \nslightest ways you can skew your results, this happens a lot. There is \ncontroversy about \"basic emotion\" which Ekman established almost fifty \nyears ago as something concrete and universal to all human beings. \nSomething I would consider a science if it tests hypotheses, gathers data, \nis reproducible, is self-correcting, and makes predictions about the \nuniverse. No need for the hard and soft labels. Is it true that physics is \nmore objective in general than psychology? There are sections of psychology \nthat are basically just as solid as mathematical fact I think.

A more \ndirect look at the video reveals contradicting claims. How can a supposedly \nliar speak in \"simple terms\" like \"I did not have sexual relations with \nthay woman\" while also speaking in \"convoluted\" terms? The producer is \nbasically making a claim that \"liars\" speak; he described the only two \ncomplexity at which a person can speak.\nI am not, however, rejecting the validity of linguistic text analysis for \nan analysis in speech in explicit context can reveal one's truthfulness. I \nam merely suggesting that viewers should not use the extremely generic \ncases explained in the video as a guideline in determining another's \ntruthfulness in very specific context.\ufeff",
