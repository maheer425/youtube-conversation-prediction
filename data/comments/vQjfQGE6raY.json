But a crap-ton of them are murdering lunatic fanatics who will do \nanything in their self-righteous pursuit of reclamation of lands that never \neven belonged to them in the first place (remember that the ancient Nords \nwere in the Reach long before the Reachmen themselves) and clinging to \ntheir ancient outmoded traditions. The Forsworn completely ruin the \nreputation of the peaceful Reachmen in the eyes of the Nords, and they've \ndemonstrated that being a peaceful Reachman/Breton kin/prison inmate can be \nan open door to becoming a Forsworn. Not to mention the Forsworn are racist \ncreeps: no better than what they claim the Nords to be. And of course I \ndon't need to remind anyone that these guys like terrorism as a hobby. :P \nThe parallel between the Reachmen (good ones and bad ones) and islam is \nuncanny, if you think about it.    \ufeff",

Her mother was \nkilled, but not before killing thirty invading Bretons/Redguards.\n\nThe Seventh and the Fifteenth Imperial Legions arrived & prevented the \nutter destruction of Orsinium at the hands of the Bretons and Redguards, \nleading the Orc survivors to Skyrim.\n\nMazgar's quote from the book, remembering the trek from the sacked Orsinium \nto the mountains in Skyrim as: \"...terror, the chaos, the walk that went on \nfor weeks through bitter cold\u2014and never having enough to eat.\"\n\n*Loading Screen Dialogue in Skyrim:* \n\n\"Orcs, also known as Orsimer, are natives of Orsinium, a small mountain \nkingdom between Hammerfell and Skyrim. It has been sacked and rebuilt many \ntimes.\"\n\nPresumably, some Orc NPCs also talk about this as the reason for there \nbeing Orc Strongholds in Skyrim.\n\n(EDIT):\n\n+WubDub88 +Motoko Hammond\n\nOther than all that, there is no real mention of Orsinium being rebuilt in \nthe 4th Era.",

The \nImperials, concerned with maintaining peace & order, had no choice but to \ngive Ulfric what he wanted.\n\nIt is even mentioned that the Imperials attempted to peacefully recognize \nthe Reach as an independent kingdom before Ulfric's \"quelling\" of them.\n\nAs of 4E201, Ulfric's Stormcloak-supporters (the Silver-Bloods) in Markarth \nhave subjugated & imprisoned a certain number of Reachmen in Cidhna \nMine...not even allowing these Reachmen \"savages\" to worship their own gods.\n\n(Edit): Long story short...Ulfric's actions (as well as those of his \nfollowers) may have cost Skyrim any chances of peaceful reconciliation \nbetween Nords & Reachmen.",

The damage caused by the pointless & unnecessary Civil War.\n\n2. Continued Forsworn hostilities in the Reach.\n\n3. Lack of support from other Provinces.  Morrowind, High Rock, & \nHammerfell would undoubtedly all refuse to aid Skyrim (for very different \nreasons).\n\n4.

Why \ndidn't they give the player the ability to join the Forsworn and rid the \nReach of the nords, revive Red Eagle, become champion of the Forsworn, and \npossibly even get Red Eagle as a follower. Instead we get hundreds of \nextremely boring and badly written miscellaneous quest. I really don't get \nmany of Skyrim's quests, and feel, that even removing them would have made \nthe game better. \ufeff",
