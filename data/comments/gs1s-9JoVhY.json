Almost every aquarium stand you buy at a store is made of \nlaminated particle board but some are much higher quality then others. \n Your typical stand is poorly sealed (some edges may even be entirely \nexposed) and will swell when they get wet.  Others like the Vertex stands \nuse a much denser, stronger, and better sealed panels (not to mention the \npanels aren't actually supporting the weight of the tank). ",

But if you don't go with a sump get a good brand hang on \nback skimmer like a aquaC remora. T5, LED, or Halide lights will work \ndepending on what you prefer/can afford.
