Last winter i \nwas driving my wrx thru colorado in december and there was a huge snow \nstorm almost 0 viability.   I was on summer dunlops that came stock on the \nwrx.   the car was useless i could not travel over 30 mph and stopping was \ndone with engine braking only cause if i braked the abs would start \nmalfunctioning.   That was the worst 250 miles of driving in my entire \nlife.   It took me 7 hours to travel 250 miles.   If you live in snowy \nclimate just buy an extra set of tires and rims!.      This is not a sales \ngimmick you need winter tires!  \ufeff",

As the temperature drops, tires begin to \nharden and lose grip. Winter tires are made from compounds specifically \ndeveloped to remain soft even in properly cold temps. By 5c (not very cold) \nthey outperform all other tire types, including so-called four seasons and \nrain tires, in every road condition including dry pavement. The downside is \nthat they wear more quickly when the temperature starts rising.",
