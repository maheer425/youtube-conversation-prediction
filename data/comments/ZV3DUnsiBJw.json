Ellen let her \ntalk through anything.. like the driving part, it was evident that ellen \nwanted to say something but she let her WIFE continue. Maybe there was a \nfight, maybe there wasn't. Look it up, send me a VIDEO of them actually \nscreaming at each other. I know they fight, they argue, they disagree, they \nwouldn't be human if they didn't do these things.\n\nLook at Portia's twitter for a second. She constantly posts pics of them \ntogether. The \"saturday selfies\" that she does, most of the time with \nEllen, some cases with their animals. Look at portia's tweet today, they \nwere relaxing together with manicures and pedicures. Just look it up. If I \nwant to divorce someone that would be the last thing I would do. Ellen \nisn't a girly girl. She's her own self. If you call that, acting like a \nboy, then so be it. But it would take her like, second thoughts to go to a \nnail salon. But instead of telling her wife \"No, you're not going because I \ndon't want to go\" she instead went with her. \n\nIf a person is controlling in a relationship, you'd see it in one look. \n\"Ellen has an image she's protecting\" blah blah blah. She does. She \npractices what she preaches. At the end of every show she ends it with \"be \nkind to one another\" she'd be a huge hypocrite if she's locking her wife \ninto their house.\n\nPlease stop quoting the media.\n*EVERYTHING THEY'VE SAID TO BE \"RUMORED\" HAS BEEN PROVEN TO NOT BE TRUE*\n\nTimes were different with Anne. Ellen has grown more as a person. Like the \ninterview she had with oprah, they were both being interviewed and I \nremember this particular statement said be ellen herself about her wife\n\"She makes me want to be a better person\" Things have changed. Portia knows \nabout being constricted. She knows it damn well.

We have no idea what's going on behind closed doors, but as \nwe've seen during the past few years, they're both very supportive of the \nother in their relationship. Ellen made E.D. on air (Ed cause of Portia's \nnickname for her), she hosted the oscars and is about to release a new show \nand book about art and design and portia has been behind her all the way, \neven going to photoshoots. There's a pic of them together, posing during a \n'break' on one of ellen's photoshoots. As for portia, she got a role on \nscandal, has been seen in various places without ellen by her side and with \nher friends. C'mon, if a partner of yours is so controlling, she wouldn't \nlet you go with your friends without her... she wouldn't even let you out \nof the house if she's that crazy. \n\nI've read her book. Portia's recovered. But she's not insecure anymore, \nmaybe a little bit but she's more confident about herself than she was back \nin the 90's. If portia was desperate to get out of a relationship where \nshe's held by the neck, she can go and find another woman for herself. \nPortia's beautiful, she knows that. She knows that a lot of people would be \ninterested in her. So leaving Ellen would be very easy for her.\n\nNo, if they 'supposedly' get a divorce, I wouldn't hate portia. If she's \nnot happy anymore, who am I to judge, my view of one of the best couples in \nhollywood would certainly change but the way I look at them as individuals \nwill not change one bit. I mean it. Honestly.\n\nCan I ask where you get these \"Reports\" I want to know. I really do. If \nit's from the media, don't count on it. I've said it before. 95% of the \ntime the things that are rumored are always fake. As for the 5%, those are \nthe ones that ellen or portia spoke from their own mouths. It's what they \nspeak of.

It's a known \nfact that ever since she broke up with Ellen, they haven't spoken to each \nother. And, reported? by whom? If it's the media, don't count on it to be \ntrue. Don't you see the pattern? Everything they've reported about the \ncouple to be \"rumored\" is never true. The \"Portia is pregnant\" rumor? FAKE. \n\"They're having a divorce\" rumor? FAKE. The \"They cancelled going to an \nevent cause they had a fight in the car\" rumor? FAKE. All of these are \nfake. Ellen's not controlling. She calls her staff her 'Family' Anyone that \nwas interviewed about working for her, that actually worked for her, said \nthat she was the best boss they've had. You wouldn't say that about someone \nthat had been holding you by the neck.\n\nPortia's a smart girl, she went to law school, she taught herself to adapt \nan accent she had trouble with, she constantly reads. She's an intelligent \nhuman being, if Ellen was controlling her, she would've left years ago. But \nshe didn't. They just celebrated their *10th* anniversary this December 1st.\nAnd please don't speak to me about \"Portia is only after Ellen's money\" \nshe's not. She's a successful actress and model. She earns the money that \nwould sustain her for years to come. if she's only after the money, she \nwouldn't be working. She wouldn't be on Scandal. She'd be in their house \nlazying all day. But she's not. She's doing her part in the relationship \njust like her wife does.",

I don't believe that Ellen is controlling, she's a \nkind-hearted person that treats everyone with equality. She's fighting for \nequal rights for all people. She treats her staff as friends and \ncolleagues, not just someone that works for her, If she's like that with \nher staff, (the people she has the right to control) why would she treat \nher own *wife* differently?

Till Ellen came to her life and \nhelped her through! So, please people don't think the fact that she's girly \nand sexy means she's certainly straight, this has nothing to do with your \nsexuality!
