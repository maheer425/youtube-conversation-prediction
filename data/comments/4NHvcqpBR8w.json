However I completely rejected that \noption & this is why. The VA for decades has held to the idea that GWS is \nof psychological nature and not a physiological aspect. However last March \nthey were finally proven wrong & that there is physical proof that the \nbrain structure of vets suffering from GWI have been altered. One thing I \nnow tell people going in & currently in service MAKE SURE YOU GET COPIES OF \nALL PERSONNEL & MEDICAL RECORDS!!! Because without those records, if you \nhave a problem later you will go through hell trying to prove your case. I \nwas sneaky. Before getting out I made copies of all my medical records \nbefore getting out & they are all backed up to t a thumb drive & Google \ndrive. As for PTSD I am not very knowledgeable in that area & do not want \nto give you false information. However, if you go to the \"About\" tab on my \npage I have a lot of resource links there. there. \nhttps://plus.google.com/110321549524619427432/posts\nThere is also a group on Facebook where several members are well educated \nwhen it comes to PTSD - https://www.facebook.com/groups/125208941896/",
