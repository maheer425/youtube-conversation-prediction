We \nonly see that our present solar system is devoid of life (other than one \nblue planet). And even that isn't quite sure. Because maybe 5 millions of \nyears ago there was life on Mars. Or Venus. Or Europa (Jupiter's moon). \nMaybe our solar system is empty, so that we have space for expansion, once \nwe start establishing colonies.\n\nHow do you know that Proxima Centauri doesn't have a planet inhabited with \nsome kind of primitive life? We can't even send a probe there, let alone \nthe scientists.\n\nSo, concluding that universe is devoid of life..... is wishful thinking. \nLife is a parasitic process that will sooner or later infect entire \nuniverse.

Because that's the only \nhypothesis that kicks creationism out of equation. No other idea can \nexplain fine-tuning of universe, except dumb luck, which isn't acceptable \nto most of physicists.\n\nWhile I'm an atheist and don't mind kicking religious ass, I think \nmultiverse theory is equally fighting science as it is religions. It's \ntotally illogical, would require enormous energy, would violate a phyisical \nlaw (or five) and not a single indicator has been found supporting it. So, \nwhile it's relatively good at combating religions, it's not very scientific.\n\nHowever, if we accept that our universe could have been created (as \noutrageous as it sounds) then there are other ways of explaining it. As \nopposed to what popular media is teaching us, accepting intelligent design \nis not the same as believing in almighty superbeing. We must not allow \nreligions to take away a logical scientific theory and privatize it. I \nresent that to media a lot. I'm atheist. And I also believe in a special \nversion of creationism. How is that possible? Because there's a way to \nexplain intelligent desing in a 100% scientific way, that removes any \nsupernatural beings.",

If the gravitational constant was a \nbit larger, the universe would collapse really quickly, too soon for any \nlife to form. And when I say \"a bit\" I mean if the constant was only \n0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\n...bigger or smaller, our universe would never form and produce life.\n\nPretty damn precise, right? Was really just a coincidence that we got the \nconstant right down to the 120th decimal?\n\nBut that's not all (you also get a set of knives). There are many other \nconstants that are fine tuned, without which our universe wouldn't form, or \nwould last too shortly. So even the biggest skeptics started to suspect \nthat it can't be just a coincidece. Could it be there was some kind of... \noh, no... \"intelligent design\"??? In order to avoid that possibility, after \nlots of thinking they accepted an alternative explanation: What if there's \ninfinite number of universes constantly appearing, so that sooner or later, \none of them will be pretty good?\n\nStill, how much energy and matter do you need to produce infinite number of \nuniverses? It would seem to break the laws of conservation matter and \nenergy. But some physicists theoretize that universe is a place of zero \nenergy. That is: all the matter and energy of the universe is offset by the \nnegative energy of gravity. So it's a zero-energy system. Which seems false \nto me, because our universe is expanding at an increasing rate. Meaning \nthat energy of the universe is beating gravity big time. So our universe \ndefinitely isn't a zero-energy system.\n\nAll in all, maybe we should find a better explanation than multiple \nparallel universe, which not only don't make sense and haven't been \nmeasured so far, but it also breaks the law of conservation of energy.

You \nguys know that time is faster than the speed of light and it's the fastest \nthing out there.Time, doesn't come to an end. It goes on forever, and ever, \nand ever. Unless something strange happens. So time is repeating itself \nover and over again. Here's an example of time repeating. Get out two \nmirrors, and have them face each other. What do you see, you see yourself \nrepeating back and forth in the same room. Notice that if you make the \nmirrors straight, you will see darkness, which means that beyond that \ndarkness time is still moving faster than the speed of light in between \nthose mirrors. That is one proof of multiple universes. People still say \nit's just your reflection, but if you look at the whole scenario, doesn't \nit mean anything. Like pick out a spot in between those the mirrors where \nyou see yourself repeating. Imagine all of a sudden you popped in that \nplace of time. The world would look the same, but would there be a delay. \nYes. There is a delay that you can't notice because it travels the speed of \nlight. There is a delay between those reflections in the mirrors. The delay \nis soooooo quick. So if there is a delay, doesn't that mean. Think, if you \ncan see yourself in every single mirror, which you can't because objects \nget in the way and block the image out. But if you can see all those \nmirrors circling around and since there is a delay, wouldn't you see \nyourself in the future. If so, then you look on the other mirror behind you \nand would you see the past. That's what I think.\ufeff",

Magnetism is a stronger force in our universe than gravity is. It is \nbecause gravity is actually one of the weakest forces, and it has been \ntheorized that the conditions of our universe are such because of the \n\"membranes\" of the universes in the multiverse interacting with one another",

Their is no \nreasioning behind the idea that i make a choice then the different choice \noptions get transfered to another universe, but rather due to the infinite \nnumber of universes meaning everything has happened and will happen an \ninfinite number of times. So lets say i take a test in our universe and \nchose the answer b, an infinite number of universes excatly like ourse \nchose b, an infinite number of universes similar to ours have already taken \nthe test, an infinite number of universes are nothing like ours and the \nmilkyway doesnt even exist.

Now you may call philosophy \"mental masturbation\", but then you have \nto call math the same thing, since math is not based on observation.\n\nAnother major difference between philosophy and science is that science is \nabout describing the world, whereas philosophy looks for meaning or science \nfinds the how while philosophy finds the why. For instance, science can \ntell us how thoughts and moral choices effect human behavior, but it \ndoesn't tell us why humans make choices and thoughts that they do, and that \nis where the latter comes in.\n\nOther things science has its limitations in is morality. Which takes us to \nthe is/ought gap, and what this law entails is that you cannot derive \nmorals from facts about the world and vice-versa, since the former is \nunobservable, and once again, it is up to philosophy to define what is \nmorally permissible and morally impermissible.
