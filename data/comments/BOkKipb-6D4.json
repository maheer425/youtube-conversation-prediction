We took out a little over half of the water and filled it back \nup. We just got the pump running again today and the pump almost seems like \nit is pumping water into the take to hard. After a few minutes of the sump \nrunning again the water started to get very cloudy, even though it was \nalready ready cloudy it got worse. So I just wanted to ask if the pump may \nbe pumping to hard? Also how long would it take for the water to clear up \nbecause in some tanks ive seen the water has cleared up very quickly?\ufeff",
