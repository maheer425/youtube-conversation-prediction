But there are \nother chemicals within a plant that may also have been created, which might \nhave undocumented or dangerous side effects, especially if administered in \na new or novel way to the medical community. Take, for example, tobacco - \nwhile certain chemicals in the tobacco plant itself might not be dangerous \nalone, when burnt and inhaled they may become more damaging than they were \nwhen simply eaten. Nicotine isn't the only chemical in the tobacco plant, \nand, while the main addictive drug in cigarettes, it isn't the most \ndangerous chemical in them - that's why you can have e-cigs, which give \npeople (lab-processed) nicotine to help control addiction, or even just as \na regular stimulant.\n\nMost people pushing for this kind of thing only really want to take \nmarijuana to get high, which is bad enough with the drugs they use in \nhospitals already. If scientists can find away to isolate this mysterious, \n(and likely fictional) cancer-curing miracle drug in marijuana, they won't \njust hand you a joint and hope for the best, because there could be other \nunknown drugs within marijuana that are actively carcinogens, especially \nwhen burnt. They would take the chemical, and in the lack of an effective \nway to manufacture it in a laboratory, they would carefully cultivate the \nplant, extract the specific chemical from it, and then destroy the rest.\n\nAnd that's assuming that there *is* a cancer-curing drug within marijuana, \nwhich is about as likely as people finding out cigarettes increase your \nlongevity.",

These claims are \nlargely unsupportable. Relying on marijuana alone as treatment while \navoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer may have serious \nhealth consequences.\"\n\nI'm fine with you mining an article for quotes, but it's clear that they \ndon't endorse relying on Marijuana without consulting a trained medical \nproffesional. And, like I said earlier, *not all cannabinoids are helpful, \nand not all of them are harmful*. Just like tobbaco, marijuana (the plant) \nhas an assortment of chemicals, some of which can get you high when acting \nin tandem. Some *might* reduce the side effects or even completely \neliminate certain types of cancer, but if they did, then it's prudent to \nreplicate them in a lab, test them, and then distribute synthetic versions \nout to the public because while some specific compounds might fight cancer, \nwithin the marijuana itself lies other, more harmful, adulterants, which \nthemselves might be carcinogens. Add to that, the traditional method of \ningesting Marijuana is assuredly harmful and innefficient, in a case where \nprecise dosage is key.\n\nEverybody's cancer is different. Cannabinoids might help some certain types \nof cancer for certain people, but in other people the exact same compounds \nmight make it worse. *If you need cancer treatment, consult a medical \nproffesional.* If a cannabinoid actually fights cancer, there's a chance \nthey might already use it.",

Just because you appeared to be cured of a type of \ncancer by your method, that does not mean somebody else will be cured, or \nanother type of cancer will be. What I think it is? The placebo affect. \nIt's proven science; with enough willpower, the body will fix itself and \nget better. It's why faith healing is so popular and appears to be \neffective amongst religious groups. It's why many people with \nchronic/terminal diseases don't get better even with treatment - they lose \nall will and hope by the end. That causes depression, which can have a \nserious effect on the immune system. Proven.\n\nAlso, I'd like to know the science behind the vegan treatment to cancer? \nHow does the many beneficial chemicals in a plant help the body and kill \ncancer? With that, isn't it a poison then? Or did you just mean that it \nboosts the immune system? I've never heard of this before, so maybe it's \nbest you get some advice and tell us how it works.",

The bacteria would \nbe put through a trial during which about 99% would perish. The remaining \n1% would be allowed to reproduce until the original population was restored \n(which takes one day). Then the process was repeated.\n\nAfter about 35 years and 50,000 generations, the final offspring were still \nE. coli bacteria. No macro-evolution had taken place. The only thing that \nthe experiment could boast was the formation of a pseudo-beneficial \nmutation that allowed the bacteria to live on citrate instead of glucose, \nbut damaged their ability to live on glucose! The scientists who headed the \nexperiment admitted that it is really just a neutral mutation, but it was \nthe closest thing that they got to a beneficial one.\n\nThe first hominids (apes with human-like features) supposedly appeared 5 \nmillion years ago and evolved into humans since that time. The experiment \nabove would tell us to expect no significant evolutionary change after \n50,000 generations. Considering that the early hominid's expected \ngeneration length was 20 years, 50K generations is a time scale of one \nmillion years or 20% of the allotted time for early hominids to evolve into \nhumans.\n\nIn other words, the observed rate of evolution (or in this case, the lack \nthereof) is significantly slower that what is required to fit the \ntheoretical timeline created by evolutionary scientists.\n\nOf course, it could be argued that as this was a study on bacteria and not \nhominids, the numbers might have no correlation to the evolutionary rate of \nhominids or humans. There are two main issues with this argument.\n\n1)The first is that the whole reason bacteria were used is because they are \nsupposed to evolve faster, not just in a real time scale, but in a \ngenerational timescale as well. Bacteria such as E. coli get more mutations \nper generation than mammals do and should evolve faster even on a \nper-generation timescale.\n\n2)The whole purpose of this experiment was to accelerate the evolutionary \nprocess so that we could see (as the title of the article put it) \n\u201cevolution in action\u201d.\n\nSo, to anyone who says that this rate of evolution is incongruent to that \nof early hominids and humans, I say that I wholeheartedly agree. The \n\u201cevolution\u201d shown in this experiment is significantly faster than what we \nwould expect in humans and our supposed ancestors, even on a per-generation \nbasis. I was actually being generous when I used the rate of evolution in \nthis experiment as the rate of evolution for early hominids!",

It starts with the \nmassive count of eye-witnesses who have experienced the spiritual world in \none way or another. After that you have scientific law.\n\nEnergy/matter cannot be created or destroyed (first law of thermodynamics). \nErgo, the universe (or simultaneous presence of time, space and \nmatter/energy) has also been around forever (though not necessarily in its \ncurrent form).\n\nHowever, the SECOND law of thermodynamics says that over time, mater/energy \nwill decay into a less usable form. Put these together and the universe \nshould be worn out by now (or at any point really, as you can go on forever \nin either direction of time).\n\nThe only way to get around this is for the universe to be an \"open system\" \n(where new energy is added in) but this creates a new problem. For the \nuniverse to be an open system there would need to be a source of infinite \nenergy somewhere, otherwise this outside source would've run out by now as \nwell.\n\nUnfortunately, left to itself, an source of infinite energy would cause the \nuniverse to be in an energized state too chaotic for solid matter to exist, \nlet alone life. In order to get around this you need the energy to be \nguided. It's like cleaning a room, you need to add energy, but it must be \ncontrolled otherwise you'll get a bigger mess than the one you started with.\n\nOf course, like the energy source and the universe, the guide would have to \nhave been around forever. This being (or beings) must exist for the \nuniverse to continue to be around.

So...\n2) No, you simply assume that the seemingly excessive coding is a tracing \nof evolutionary heritage. You can claim that this is not an assumption, but \nthere is not a creature on this planet whose entire genetic code has been \nrecorded and thoroughly observed by humans.\n\"Also, in laboratory we are able to modify creatures and we observe what is \nhappening at a molecular level, so it is not speculative.\"\nAs true as this is, what we observe through our manipulations only proves \nmy point. That point being that mutations are harmful and do not help \nevolution.\n\"For the last time EARTH IS NOT AN ISOLATED SYSTEM.\"\nFor the last time, IT DOESN'T MATTER. Like I said before, adding energy to \nthe mix only makes the system reach entropy faster. The ONLY way around it \nis to have an intelligent life form purposely use time and energy to \ncounteract the force of entropy. Adding energy without intelligent control \nwill not help. This is not my claim, it was in my physics book!\n\"At the end I realized that speaking to you is useless cause you keep \nbringing up points that have been rejected a million times.\"\n1) I have been using new points in every one of my replies.\n2) You rejecting my points does not make them any less valid. When \nAristotle started saying that the earth was round people thought he was \ncrazy and most people, including scientists, rejected his claims. He was \nstill right though.\n\"Also, getting 62 amino acids in the correct order in more than 1 billion \nyear when the water is full of amino acids is not so rare.\"\n1) Show me your math, what are the odds you calculated?\n2) Most amino acids in the water today probably came from living creatures. \nThere is only one know method of creating amino acids that could possibly \nhappen naturally and it requires a lightning bolt of a specific energy \nrange to hit a combination of gasses in water, preferably at night time. \nEven then though, the product is only 1% right-handed amino acids, which \nare covered in tar and carboxylic acid. If that sounds like conditions \nwhere life is likely to form to you then you are just hopeless.\n3) Let's assume that you are right though, and amino acids were so \nplentiful that you could try to get this SMALLEST protein 1000 times every \nsecond in every square meter of ocean surface (it needs to be near the \nsurface to be properly struck by lightning and that is where the gasses and \nacids are going to hang out anyways). So we got odds of 1 in 1.7x10^83, \ntimes 1000 attempts per second, times 360,000,000,000 square meters of \nocean surface and you get 2.12x10^-69 or 1 in 4.72x10^68. See? It doesn't \nmatter how much you try it, how much ocean space you say it can happen in \nor any of that, the odds are simply too low. It just won't happen.\n\"The mutations you are talking about on mice etc... are not always \nnegative, if you read the published papers (a thing that you clearly don't \ndo because you think it is all speculation) you will see what type of \nmutation they do and, above all, that is exactly what they did to know what \nproteins are described in which chromosome\"\nActually, I got this information from reading different papers published on \nthe subject. I find this kind of thing very interesting and researched it \navidly for about a year. That was how I learned of the examples that I gave \nyou (except the four-winged fly one, which was in a biology textbook). If \nyou know of a beneficial mutation observed in a lab, please tell me about \nit. Because thus far, all you just said boils down to \"There are good \nmutations, the scientists who do these tests know what the observed \nmutations do and this is how they learn about proteins and chromosomes.\" \nYou never actually mentioned a beneficial mutation.\n\"Ans don't answer with the \"common designer\" thing because one of our \nsteroid producing genes is a modification of 2 separate genes in older \njawless fish which is exactly predicted by evolution.\"\nDid you know that modern rockets used by NASA use an engine system that was \nmodified from the designs of two older rocket engine systems? This does not \nmean that the new rocket evolved from the old ones, it means that the \ndesigners took two designs and put them together to make something better. \nIf people can do that then why couldn't a god?\n\"the \"design\" of the human eye which has the same structure as all the \nanimals in that evolutionary line (until fish) but different from all the \nother animals in the other evolutionary lines (as predicted and as shown by \nthe phylogeny tree which is automatically built by an objective algorithm).\"\nActually, squid and octopus have an eye extremely similar to those of \nhumans, even though evolutionists say that humans did not evolve from \neither squid or octopi. This and other cases of \"convergent evolution\" are \na big problem for evolutionists to get over because they cannot use the \n\"common descent\" argument to explain common design. None of these cases can \nbe understood through the \"evolutionary tree\" and sometimes present a \ncomplete enigma to evolutionists. Creatures like the platypus, Tasmanian \nwolf and even bats (which supposedly came around, fully formed and able to \nfly about 50 million years ago) pose a big problem to evolution because you \nhave no idea how they evolved or what they even evolved from. Please tell \nme how rodent-like creatures could evolve into bats so quickly, fully \nequipped with wings and echolocation, that the process wasn\u2019t able to be \ncaptured, even in part, in the fossil record. The amount of time estimated \nto cause a step in evolution to not be found in the fossil record is 1 \nmillion years or less, that simply isn\u2019t enough time for all of those \nchanges to have happened. And after that, why have bats changed so little. \nWhy would they go through massive changes so rapidly and then just stop and \nnot do anything for 50 million years?\nChecked out the channel, it has some interesting stuff and I will be \nwatching it for a while before I can get to it all. Right now, I am working \non the \u201cevolution is a blind watchmaker\u201d video and it has a few problems. \nYou can check out my comments over there if you like, though I doubt you \nwill since you haven\u2019t seriously considered a single claim I have made, \nlistened to any of my rebuttal to your claims or support for my own or \ngiven any rebuttal far outside of \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong\u201d and \u201cThere \nare people who don\u2019t agree with what you say\u201d.

                    "text": "+Hexus Serpent Some things I would like to hopefully clear up for you: \n\n1. Vaccines don't use mercury anymore, it was phased out in 2001. Even when \nit was used, thiomersal (An organic mercury-containing compound) was put \ninto the vaccines as a preservative in controlled environments to keep \nvaccines fresh and usable over long periods of time (I think the influenza \nvaccine still uses it thiomersal today). Even then it isn't pure mercury, \nit uses 25 micrograms (0.000025), there is no way that that will ever harm \nyou in any significant way. The only side effect from actually using this \nmuch is a slight redness at the injection site.\n\n2. Vaccines do not cause autism, there was a study in 1998 that published a \nvery shady relation between them. But it turned out it was fake, the doctor \nwas using unethical and invasive methods on the children \"volunteers,\" to \nwhich he was promptly banned from practicing medicine (Not sure what \nhappened to him though afterwards). Autism also has no serious and fatal \naffects such as the diseases that can be cured with vaccines, sure you \nmight be socially awkward, but it's better than suffering from a fatal \ndisease that could actually kill you. Even then, most cases of autism \nnowadays aren't even on the extreme level where the person cannot function \nby themselves. There are more and more types of autism being classified as \nwe progress and get better at detecting it. Vaccines do not rewrite your \ngenetic coding to make abnormalities and give you autism.\n\n3. The immune system cannot do this alone. The immune system is made up of \ntwo parts, innate and adaptive, you need both to live. The adaptive only \nworks on diseases you've already experienced. Without a vaccine or any \noutside help, it would take you roughly two weeks to fully be able to \ncombat a new disease you have never experienced. But by that time, you \nwould probably be suffering so much your immune system has already been \ndestroyed so much it can't do anything (Or you'd be dead). Memory cells \nrecall previous events of the disease (from your vaccine) and can almost \ndestroy the disease before you even sneeze. Vaccines manipulate your to \ncreate a natural body response that it can use over and over again. \nVaccines use attenuated nonvirulent forms of the disease so it doesn't \nseriously hurt you or accidentally give you the disease it's trying to \nprevent.\n\n4. There is no government conspiracy surrounding the cure for cancer.\n\n5. People who do not receive vaccines can cause previously deadly viruses \nand diseases to mutate. Because someone hasn't already been injected with \nthe vaccine or experienced that disease yet, it gives the disease a toehold \nin humanity so it can overcome the current vaccines. It can take a disease \nless than five years to fully mutate into something that could cause an \nepidemic. If you were being treated for a disease but didn't take all or \nany of your meds, selective pressure would take over and cause harm to you. \nSelective pressure happens when you don't get enough of what you need to \nfully combat your sickness and the disease can come back right again more \npowerful. So if you were to only take a weeks worth of antibiotics but need \nthree and you were feeling better already, it could come back and \npotentially kill you or make you seriously sick based on what the virus is. \nThe same goes for vaccines, if you didn't get enough or any vaccines, the \ndisease can come back fully functionally to cause an epidemic based on what \nit is.\n\n6. Eating healthy is not enough to save you from cancer, nor is it enough \nto stop diseases and bacteria from killing you. Eating a banana will not \nsave you from cancer if you don't have it or if you already have it. And \nbeing vaccinated against certain infectious diseases could, in fact, \nprevent cancer in many ways.\n\nMuch of the evidence and stories you have presented with the people you \nhave responded with of surviving/dying of cancer/diseases with/without \ntreatment can either be attributed to luck, or you are fabricating them. \nNearly all of the tales you have claimed to be real seem very fairy \ntail-like and cliche in the sense it is the same story many people use over \nand over again to say that their methods work. It is true that chemotherapy \nmay not work sometimes, but it does also work a lot of the time. Your \nignorance is almost borderline arrogance at this point with all the replies \nyou have gotten from your original comment, while they have been providing \nevidence, you've been pulling stories out of your ass. And being mean to \npeople such as telling them to \"get cancer, take chemo, and then DIE\" is \nnot the approach you want to be taking when you wish to \"educate\" people on \nthe subject at hands. You are extremely biased towards your own opinion and \nreferences to the point where you think the other side of the treatment \ndoes nothing at all. Also your absence of sources and references is \nconcerning seeing as you supposedly know so much about the topic. Your \narguments are forfeit without actual facts opposed to you using \nfear-mongering and rabid insults. I suggest you do some actual proper \nresearch instead of spouting nonsense on the internet. The people who \ncreate vaccines and treat patients with chemo know a lot more than you do, \nso you should do some actual proper research on the topic at hand before \ngoing around saying something this irrational.",

                    "text": "+Hexus Serpent I can tell you the reason why you didn't catch a disease \nwhen you lived in the wild: Diseases are species-specific. Meaning you \ncan't catch a disease from an animal, only from other humans. Diseases \nspread from human to human so if you live in isolation of course nobody can \ncontract a disease. Also I'm quite sure you were enjoying many of the \ncomforts of civilization anyway, knives, tools, clothing etc and also \nhumans don't have many animals we have to fear, bears and wolves being some \nof the few exceptions. But that's nothing like what the vast majority of \nanimals are going through, being in fear of being eaten 24/7. If life in \nthe wilderness was so great why did you return anyway?\n\nBut we went off topic. I'm sorry you have autism and I understand that you \nare looking for theories to explain it but there's definite scientific \nproof that autism is not in any way linked to Thimerosal. I got all shots \nthere are and I'm not autistic. Barely anyone is autistic anyway. How would \nyou explain that? Vaccination rates have been dropping over the last decade \ndue to the paranoia caused by aforementioned forged study, yet there is no \ndrop in autism diagnoses in infants. Kids are still getting autism even \nthough people stopped vaccinating them? How come? I tell you how. You had \nautism when you where born because it's caused by a genetic mutation, it's \na \"birth defect\" for the lack of a better word. No offense, I'm not saying \nyou are \"defective\" because of your autism, I'm sure you'll manage to live \na good life anyway, but please don't blame it on \"mercury\", it's simply a \nlie and a lie that you really don't have to convince yourself of.\n\nAnd concerning the formaldehyde thing, there is no such thing as \"taking \nthe badness\" out of a chemical. Formaldehyde is formaldehyde, there is no \ndifference between formaldehyde in a shot or in a fruit. I can look up \nwhere I got the number of 160 times to make sure it's correct, but even if \nit was only 8 times you should still be able to realize that the trace \namounts of formaldehyde in a vaccine are so tiny compared to fruit we eat \nevery day that it's really ridiculous to claim that it harms you. Those \ndoses are ridiculously minute and not harmful to humans whatsoever.",

The industry makes \nroughly $100billion annually (out of about $850 billion in profit/year) off \nof the disease and, despite the rigorous research being done to find a cure \nor 'golden treatment', the World Health Organization has predicted that the \nnumber of people who get cancer will almost DOUBLE by 2030, from a current \n13 million new cancer patients/year to 22 million new cancer patients/year. \nDespite numerous carcinogens being well-known by respective Medical \nInstitutions and Governmental Departments, little to no work is being done \nto prohibit this (such as GMOs or Pesticides, what is covered over the food \nyou eat). Companies already earn, on average, over $100k per patient per \nyear. One reason why the price is so high is because new cancer drugs have \nno competitors, which means the price can be gauged to what the industry \nwants. Center's for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) establishes prices \nfor all drugs that are paid for under Medi(care/aid), health insurances set \nprices to coincide with this, BUT CMS does not establish fees for cancer \ndrugs, allowing prices to skyrocket.\n\nThere's far too much to talk about regarding this issue, but just note that \nthings such as cancer research, however it may be perceived by the general \npublic, is not seen in the same way to those who make a buck off of it. It \nturns out that the best way to fend off cancer is to live a lifestyle with \nas little exposure to carcinogens as possible. Why do you think cancer \nrates were severely low in the early 1900s?",

Think of \nit like this:\n\nNon-natural frequency is akin to trying to run into a brick wall with just \nyour body. The wall would not move, or if it did move, it would move only \nslightly. Either way, it doesn't break the wall.\n\nNow, natural frequency is like ramming a car into a brick wall. The brick \nwall would \"shatter\" all over the place and bricks would be sent flying.\n\nIn a sense, when you vibrate glass at its natural frequency, you induce a \nlot of kinetic energy into the glass structure that, at the right note, you \ninduce so much kinetic energy that the glass shatters because of extreme \nmolecular movement.",

It's used \nmainly by herbivores whom find that there are no edible plants during \nwinter months in snowy regions; carnivores can still find prey roaming \naround.\n\nHumans are omnivores, again, so they have a choice on what to eat. If a \nhuman wants to eat meat, they still have to kill the animal, same as in \nnature. Humans have no natural habitat, as we are located on every \ncontinent naturally (barring Antartica), and have been for tens of \nthousands of years.\n\nWhat are you on about? Food ONLY arrives at the brain as glucose, ATP and \namino acids - no matter the source - , and also psychoactive substances and \nother dangerous chemicals (which are only found in plants), which can kill, \nmake you hallucinate, make you vomit, suppress/enhance the immune and \ncentral nervous system, and many other effects. How good are plants for you \nnow? The eggplant contains nicotine, you wouldn't think twice before eating \nthat, almonds contain cyanide and bananas are the food with the highest \nradioactivity, containing K-90.\n\nWhat are you on about, tying food with the real world? I'm not even going \nto answer, but for the last part - you don't know what a hormone is. Here \nis the definition: A hormone (from Greek \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03ae, \"impetus\") is a class of \nsignaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are \ntransported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate \nphysiology and behaviour.\n\nWhat is the correct food then? Do you study the human diet? Human \npsychology? If not, I suggest you stop trying to persuade others with your \nquack pseudoscience. You're not an expert, you're not a scientist or a \nresearcher, you have no right to spread misinformation.

Read this extract on the digestive system of Humans:\n\nHuman Digestive Tract\n\nThe human digestive tract bears NO resemblance to that of herbivores.\n\nIn fact, it should be very obvious how very similar the human and carnivore \ndigestive systems are. Here\u2019s counting the ways...\n\nDogs and humans have canine teeth.\nDogs and humans eat a meal, and then may not eat again for a few hours, or \ndays. (Herbivores graze all day long, nearly every waking moment looking \nfor forage.)\nThey use an up and down chewing motion of the jaws\nLength, digestive enzymes and function of the stomach are nearly identical \nin human and carnivore digestive systems. No digestion occurs in the \nrabbit's stomach; in a cow, digestion does not occur until stomach number 4.\nSmall intestine, appendix (cecum) and colon have identical functions in \nhuman and carnivore digestive systems, though there are a couple physical \ndifferences. \n\nHumans don't have a cecum, per se. Instead, the beginning of the large \nintestine is called the 'cecum.' It is nothing more than a segment of the \ncolon. The appendix which has no known use, is attached to the large \nintestine at the junction of small and large intestines. \n\nDogs have no appendix, but at the spot where the small intestine joins the \nlarge intestine, dogs have a small, S-shaped appendage named the cecum \nwhich serves the dog about like the human appendix does humans - its use is \nminor or undetermined.\nNeither carnivores or humans have digestive systems that break down or \nutilize the cellulose in plant cell walls. (Herbivores use an army of \nbacteria and an extended transit time to break down cellulose to a usable \nform.)\nHuman and carnivore digestive systems are designed for and equipped to eat \nmeat. Both humans and carnivores eat and break down animal proteins, lipids \nand vitamins directly from animal sources. (Herbivores by definition do not \neat animals, but they still need 'animal protein,' and they obtain it from \nthe many pounds of bacteria which they continually digest.)\nHuman Digestive Tract Sketch\nHuman digestion does not break down plant materials efficiently.\n\nHumans CAN extract and utilize the carbohydrates in plants (not cellulose), \nwhich is where humans and pure carnivores differ:\n\nDogs cannot break down carbohydrates at all. But human saliva contains \namylase, which can digest carbohydrates (but not cellulose, which is too \ncomplex for amylase).\n\nThis is why humans are categorized as omnivores, while also having a \ncarnivore digestive system.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nHumans should be eating a LOT MORE MEAT and animal fat, and a lot less \ncarbohydrates, especially refined carbs and grains (including whole grains).\n\nI know this flies in the face of quite a bit of current accepted dietary \ntheory.\n\nBut, let's think this through for half a minute:\n\nCurrent dietary recommendations have been around for 50+ years.  If these \ndietary guidelines were even half effective, Americans would be getting \nhealthier. As it is, on the current low fat, high carb guidelines, every \nknown chronic degenerative disease has reached epidemic proportions, and \n66.7% of Americans are not just overweight, but obese.\n\nSomething's wrong with THAT picture.\n\nLow fat, high carb is NOT working! If what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working, don\u2019t \nyou think we should be trying something different already??\n\n- See more at: \nhttp://www.raising-rabbits.com/carnivore-digestive-system.html#sthash.QSuJpIOJ.dpuf",

The \nreason raw meat is unappealing (to vegetarians at least) is due to culture, \nnot because of Human natural diet. We haven't ever a need to cook fruits in \nthe whole of Human evolution - because we've got the teeth to break down \ncell walls (Oh yeah, why do we have canines and incisors if meat isn't \nsupposed to be a part of our diet), the enzymes to digest all components \nand a digestive system to throw out the fibre and excess roughage, so \nthat's why they're appealing in their raw state. I'm sure if someone is \nhungry enough, they'd munch down on raw meat - I mean it happened in Russia \nwhen Germany was invading; rats, dogs, other humans, you name it. Your \nargument doesn't explain why insects are not appealing to Western cultures, \nbut African and some Asian cultures count insects as part of their daily \nmeals. For example, I doubt you'd eat many of the foods I'm going to list \nat the end, but Asian cultures absolutely love them like the West loves its \nfast food. Also, predatory animals sometimes eat their prey alive, does \nthat mean that we view them as horrible and violent creatures? No. We view \nit as natural.\n\nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/mattortile/23-unexpected-cultural-delicacies-from-asia#.rpRN2628K",

Such as \na vulture or crows. Humans may have been at one point but we have since \nevolved to be hunter/gathers. Our stomachs are no longer designed to digest \nhalf rotten meat that are crawling with all sorts of diseases and \nparasites. Which is why a week old deer carcass isn't that appealing. Its a \ndifferent story when the kill is fresh though. I know a few people who will \ntake a deer they just hit to the butcher. Oh, and we do often use the bones \nand organs of animals. Casings of sausages are usually made out of \nintestines. Tongues of various animals are often consider a delicacy along \nwith the brains and heart. Its also not uncommon for the liver of an animal \nto be cooked and eaten. Hell, even blood is often used. Bones can be boiled \ndown into a broth along with the hooves or feet of the animal. We actually \nuse just about every part of an animal we butcher. The bits we don't we \ngrind into food for our pets.\n\n\"If meet is healthy then explain why china or other Asian countries that \neat mainly diet high in carbohidrate foods have the lowest % of heart and \ncancer  illness.\"\n\nMeat contains carbohydrates. Albeit not as much as fruits, veggies, or \ngrains but they are also high in protein and fats which the body needs to \noperate effectively. You also make it out as if most Asians enjoy a \nprimarily vegan diet which is just not the case. Most Asian dishes \nincorporate a meat of some kind. Its actually kind of rare to eat a meal \nthat doesn't include meat in most places throughout Asia. They do also eat \na lot of fresh vegetables with that meat though which is probably the \nprimary reason why they have lower risk of heart disease and cancer \ncompared to westerners who consume a more processed food heavy diet. Which \njust goes back to what I was saying earlier about a balanced diet being \nimportant.",

As far as I am \nconcerned , I do believe you need to follow the rules if you want to fully \nbenefit from it.\nFirst of all , fasting demands a great spiritual power ( especially if you \nare active during the summer time )\nThough , I see some people who are sleeping the whole day , and when the \nfasting breaking time comes they jump out of the bed , and they start \neating sugary and fatty things , then,  they spend the whole night watching \nTV , smoking and talking .( I think these people have missed it )\nThe way I deem it correct and appropriate , it to fast and be active in the \nsame time ,I eat very healthy when I break my fast , I start by eating \nfruits ( so that my stomach starts working correctly ) and then some \nvegetables , soup , fish...Afterwards ,  I go to do my prayer ( physical \nexercise ),  help the family  in cleaning  and then go to sleep for another \nfasting day.\nPersonally , I noticed some good changes : Acne disappears completely from \nmy skin , I have a brighter skin.I feel lighter and more energetic.\nI have heard that this helps the liver to get out long time stocked things \nand to start over again.\n:) ",

I have seen studies \nthat says once cup (not a grande..lol) pulls out up to 8 glasses of water \nfrom the body.  Caffeine also destroys the adrenal glands which helps \nbalance the 4 main hormones of the body: adrenaline, norepenephrine, \ncortisol and DHEA.\nFinally... coffee isn't the only toxic thing you consume.  Everything we \neat, breath and drink is filled with chemicals... our bodies are toxic and \nnot meant to handle these loads.  It's one reason why we have a obesity \nproblem.. the body stores more body fat the more toxins are in the body.  \nThis is why dieting fails.. it doesn't address toxicity.  I recommend a \nquality full body nutritional cleanse to address these issues.",

There's been a cure for \ncancer found in a Canada, they posted their evidence on the internet also \nto show people what they had found, they tested it and it worked. But \npharmaceutical company's didn't want it, didn't want anything to do with \nit. They also found a cure in the United States. Yet again the \npharmaceutical company's didn't want anything to do with it. Now of course \nthis could be for just a couple types of cancer, but still. Pharmaceutical \ncompany's are after money, that's why a tube of glue doctors use to put on \ngashes is 700$ and the doctor then tells you to just use regular super \nglue, that their the same, and have the same ingredients. Now picture how \nmuch money all this cancer bullshit makes these people, picture the \nbillions and billions of dollars these people are making for foundations \nand having actual people go threw the treatment. Do you really think our \ngovernment or the owners of these company's care about our life's? No! \nEverything is done in our country especially, out of greed. Most \nfoundations take most of the profit from people who Dante to them also. So \nyou could donate 1 dollar, and only maybe 5-10cents will go to the actual \nhelp for the cancer or any other problem to be researched or to help.

While I do believe that it's important \nto know what goes into your body, not many people are willing to take the \nextra step to study up on the science behind how the body works and how \ncertain substances affect the body. That's where the difference lies \nbetween \"traditional\" medicine and \"alternative\" medicine. One is based on \npeer-reviewed research that has been proven scientifically to work. The \nother is based on sensationalism and lack of knowledge of biology and \nchemistry. I honestly don't know why these cancer conspiracies haven't been \nremoved from YouTube. This is literally a difference between life and \ndeath. Let's face it: if someone chooses to go the \"alternative\" route, you \nhave a much, MUCH higher chance of dying from cancer than you would if you \nhad conventional treatment. I've seen so many of these so-called \nalternative medicine quacks make all of these sensationalist claims about \nhow they cured this person's cancer or how \"Big Pharma\" is \"trying to hide \nthe cure because all they want is money\", etc. How these people haven't \nbeen arrested for endangering lives, I don't know.

You \nare right, the body does regenerate cells and DNA but everytime a cell \nmakes a newly grown cell a tiny bit of DNA is not passed down.That means \nthat every time a new cell is grown, it is just a tiny bit different. After \nthis happening repeatedly overtime, it will cause brittle bones, wrinkly \nskin, and white hair. In other words you turn old. Thats why not staying in \nthe sun too long will prevent early wrinkles because you will have to make \nnew cells but yeah anyway back to the point. When after a long per of time \nthe cells will have developed cells not strong enough or dont have all the \ncomponents to a cell because of this inability. And then overtime you will \nnot be able to live longer after you are made of not strong enough cells to \ncarry out needs, so yeah thats an explanation on why we die of age. lawl im \nfricken in middle school, whyd i have to explain it could you have not just \nwiki'd it like everyone does...lawl i hoped this explanation helped you \nunderstand, if it didnt help at all and made you more confused then sorry \nlawl ;)",

                    "text": "+Unsolved Paradox Hello Random cosmic accident that nothingness spewed \nwithout free will or purpose, lets destroy your philosophy, you said\n\n*God isn't a theory. Barely even a hypothesis*\n\nThat we are here by chance is stupid and lucks scientific support, we are \nhere due to intention or no intention, since the Universe began to exist \n(matter space time) then the cause of the Universe is by definition \ntranscendent or supernatural if you like.\nThe only thing that we know it can precede Materialism is consciousness and \nGod is a Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nFour intersecting lines of experimental evidence from quantum mechanics \nthat shows that consciousness precedes material reality (Wigner\u2019s \nQuantum Symmetries, Wheeler\u2019s Delayed Choice, Leggett\u2019s Inequalities, \nQuantum Zeno effect):\n\n@1\n\nWas there intention behind our existence? Of course there was and now we \ncan prove it, its called the Fine Tuning argument.\n\n*The fine-tuning argument*\n\nThe argument goes like this:\n\nThe fine-tuning of the universe to support life is either due to law, \nchance or design\nIt is not due to law or chance\n\nTherefore, the fine-tuning is due to design\n\nWhat does it meaning to be fine-tuned for life?\n\nHere are the facts on the fine-tuning:\n\nLife has certain minimal requirements;\n\nlong-term stable source of energy, a large number of different chemical \nelements, an element that can serve as a hub for joining together other \nelements into compounds, etc.\nIn order to meet these minimal requirements, the physical constants, (such \nas the gravitational constant), and the ratios between physical constants, \nneed to be withing a narrow range of values in order to support the minimal \nrequirements for life of any kind.\nSlight changes to any of the physical constants, or to the rations between \nthe constants, will result in a universe inhospitable to life.\n\nThe range of possible ranges over 70 orders of magnitude.\n\nThe constants are selected by whoever creates the universe. They are not \ndetermined by physical laws. And the extreme probabilities involved \nrequired put the fine-tuning beyond the reach of chance.\n\nAlthough each individual selection of constants and ratios is as unlikely \nas any other selection, the vast majority of these possibilities do not \nsupport the minimal requirements of life of any kind. (In the same way as \nany hand of 5 cards that is dealt is as likely as any other, but you are \noverwhelmingly likely NOT to get a royal flush. In our case, a royal flush \nis a life-permitting universe).\n\n*Examples of finely-tuned constants*\n\nHere are a couple of examples of the fine-tuning. Craig only gave one \nexample in the debate and didn\u2019t explain how changes to the constant would \naffect the minimal requirements for life. But Bradley does explain it, and \nhe is a professional research scientist, so he is speaking about things he \nworked in his polymer research lab. (He was the director)\n\na) The strong force: (the force that binds nucleons (= protons and \nneutrons) together in nucleus, by means of meson exchange)\nif the strong force constant were 2% stronger, there would be no stable \nhydrogen, no long-lived stars, no hydrogen containing compounds. This is \nbecause the single proton in hydrogen would want to stick to something else \nso badly that there would be no hydrogen left!\nif the strong force constant were 5% weaker, there would be no stable \nstars, few (if any) elements besides hydrogen. This is because you would be \nable to build up the nuclei of the heavier elements, which contain more \nthan 1 proton.\nSo, whether you adjust the strong force up or down, you lose stars than can \nserve as long-term sources of stable energy, or you lose chemical \ndiversity, which is necessary to make beings that can perform the minimal \nrequirements of living beings. (see below)\n\nb) The conversion of beryllium to carbon, and carbon to oxygen\nLife requires carbon in order to serve as the hub for complex molecules, \nbut it also requires oxygen in order to create water.\nCarbon is like the hub wheel in a tinker toy set: you can bind other \nelements together to more complicated molecules (e.g. \u2013 \u201ccarbon-based \nlife), but the bonds are not so tight that they can\u2019t be broken down again \nlater to make something else.\nThe carbon resonance level is determined by two constants: the strong force \nand electromagnetic force.\nIf you mess with these forces even slightly, you either lose the carbon or \nthe oxygen.\nEither way, you\u2019ve got no life of any conceivable kind.\n\n*Is the fine-tuning real?*\n\nYes, it\u2019s real and it is conceded by the top-rank of atheist physicists. \nLet me give you a citation from the best one of all, Martin Rees. Martin \nRees is an atheist and a qualified astronomer. He wrote a book called \u201cJust \nSix Numbers:\n\nThe Deep Forces That Shape The Universe\u201d, (Basic Books: 2001). In it, he \ndiscusses 6 numbers that need to be fine-tuned in order to have a \nlife-permitting universe.\n\nRees writes here:\n\nThese six numbers constitute a \u2018recipe\u2019 for a universe. Moreover, the \noutcome is sensitive to their values: if any one of them were to be \n\u2018untuned\u2019, there would be no stars and no life. Is this tuning just a brute \nfact, a coincidence?\n\nOr is it the providence of a benign Creator?\n\nThere are some atheists who deny the fine-tuning, but these atheists are in \nfirm opposition to the progress of science. The more science has \nprogressed, the more constants, ratios and quantities we have discovered \nthat need to be fine-tuned. Science is going in a theistic direction. Next, \nlet\u2019s see how atheists try to account for the fine-tuning, on atheism.\n\n*Atheistic responses to the fine-tuning argument*\n\nThere are two common responses among atheists to this argument.\n\nThe first is to speculate that there are actually an infinite number of \nother universes that are not fine-tuned, (i.e. \u2013 the gambler\u2019s fallacy). \nAll these other universes don\u2019t support life. We just happen to be in the \none universe is fine-tuned for life. The problem is that there is no way of \ndirectly observing these other universes and no independent evidence that \nthey exist.\n\nHere is an excerpt from an article in Discover magazine, (which is hostile \nto theism and Christianity).\n\nhttp://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/10-sciences-alternative-to-an-intelligent-creator\n\nThe second response by atheists is that the human observers that exist \ntoday, 14 billion years after the universe was created out of nothing, \nactually caused the fine-tuning. This solution would mean that although \nhumans did not exist at the time the of the big bang, they are going to be \nable to reach back in time at some point in the future and manually \nfine-tune the universe.\nHere is an excerpt from and article in the New Scientist, (which is hostile \nto theism and Christianity).\n\nwww.newscientist.com/article/mg20026852.500-why-its-not-as-simple-as-god-vs-the-multiverse.html\n\nSo, there are two choices for atheists. Either an infinite number of \nunobservable universes that are not fine-tuned, or humans go back in time \nat some future point and fine-tune the beginning of the universe, billions \nof years in the past.\n\nThat we are here by chance is meaningful. We are either here by intention \nor not, if not then by definition we are here by chance.\nWhat we have is evidence for fine-tuning. You don\u2019t dispute that. What you \ndispute is what the evidence means. There are only two possibilities: \nchance or not chance, if not chance then we are here by intention. You have \nto ask yourself which of the two, given the evidence we have, is more \nplausible. Intention is clearly more plausible due to analogous reasoning. \nThere is no reason to believe that fine-tuning is the result of chance. The \nonly reason why people believe that it\u2019s just a coincidence is because they \nwish to believe it.\n\n1. like causes like effects\n2. the effect of fine-tuning is caused by intelligence\n3. Therefore, I think there is not enough evidence to choose between chance \nor intelligence.\n\nTheism Compared To Atheistic Materialism, which one should be rejected as a \nvalid scientific hypothesis?\n\n1. Naturalism/Materialism predicted time-space energy-matter always \nexisted. Whereas Theism predicted time-space energy-matter were created. \nBig Bang cosmology now strongly indicates that time-space energy-matter had \na sudden creation event approximately 14 billion years ago.\n\n2. Naturalism/Materialism predicted that the universe is a self sustaining \nsystem that is not dependent on anything else for its continued existence. \nTheism predicted that God upholds this universe in its continued existence. \nBreakthroughs in quantum mechanics reveal that this universe is dependent \non a \u2018non-local\u2019, beyond space and time, cause for its continued existence.\n\n3. Naturalism/Materialism predicted that consciousness is a \u2018emergent \nproperty\u2019 of material reality and thus should have no particularly special \nposition within material reality. Theism predicts consciousness precedes \nmaterial reality and therefore, on that presupposition, consciousness \nshould have a \u2018special\u2019 position within material reality. Quantum Mechanics \nreveals that consciousness has a special, even a central, position within \nmaterial reality. -\n\n4. Naturalism/Materialism predicted the rate at which time passed was \nconstant everywhere in the universe. Theism predicted God is eternal and is \noutside of time. \u2013 Special Relativity has shown that time, as we understand \nit, is relative and comes to a complete stop at the speed of light. (Psalm \n90:4 \u2013 2 Timothy 1:9) -\n\n5. Naturalism/Materialism predicted the universe did not have life in mind \nand that life was ultimately an accident of time and chance. Theism \npredicted this universe was purposely created by God with man in mind. \nScientists find the universe is exquisitely fine-tuned for carbon-based \nlife to exist in this universe. Moreover it is found, when scrutinizing the \ndetails of chemistry, that not only is the universe fine-tuned for carbon \nbased life, but is specifically fine-tuned for life like human life (M. \nDenton).-\n\n6. Naturalism/Materialism predicted complex life in this universe should be \nfairly common. Theism predicted the earth is extremely unique in this \nuniverse. Statistical analysis of the hundreds of required parameters which \nenable complex organic life to be possible on earth gives strong indication \nthe earth is extremely unique in this universe (Gonzalez). -\n\n7. Naturalism/Materialism predicted it took a very long time for life to \ndevelop on earth. Theism predicted life to appear abruptly on earth after \nwater appeared on earth (Genesis 1:10-11). Geo-chemical evidence from the \noldest sedimentary rocks ever found on earth indicates that complex \nphoto-synthetic life has existed on earth as long as water has been on the \nface of earth. -\n\n8. Naturalism/Materialism predicted the first life to be relatively simple. \nTheism predicted that God is the source for all life on earth. The simplest \nlife ever found on Earth is far more complex than any machine man has made \nthrough concerted effort. (Michael Denton PhD) -\n\n9. Naturalism/Materialism predicted the gradual unfolding of life would \n(someday) be self-evident in the fossil record. Theism predicted complex \nand diverse animal life to appear abruptly in the seas in God\u2019s fifth day \nof creation. The Cambrian Explosion shows a sudden appearance of many \ndifferent and completely unique fossils within a very short \u201cgeologic \nresolution time\u201d in the Cambrian seas. -\n\n10. Naturalism/Materialism predicted there should be numerous transitional \nfossils found in the fossil record, Theism predicted sudden appearance and \nrapid diversity within different kinds found in the fossil record. Fossils \nare consistently characterized by sudden appearance of a group/kind in the \nfossil record(disparity), then rapid diversity within that group/kind, and \nthen long term stability and even deterioration of variety within the \noverall group/kind, and within the specific species of the kind, over long \nperiods of time. Of the few dozen or so fossils claimed as transitional, \nnot one is uncontested as a true example of transition between major animal \nforms out of millions of collected fossils. -\n\n11. Naturalism/Materialism predicted animal speciation should happen on a \nsomewhat constant basis on earth. Theism predicted man was the last species \ncreated on earth \u2013 Man (our genus \u2018modern homo\u2019 as distinct from the highly \ncontroversial \u2018early homo\u2019) is the last generally accepted major fossil \nform to have suddenly appeared in the fossil record. (Tattersall; Luskin)\u2013\n\n12. Naturalism/Materialism predicted much of the DNA code was junk. Theism \npredicted we are fearfully and wonderfully made \u2013 ENCODE research into the \nDNA has revealed a \u201cbiological jungle deeper, denser, and more difficult to \npenetrate than anyone imagined.\u201d. -\n\n13. Naturalism/Materialism predicted a extremely beneficial and flexible \nmutation rate for DNA which was ultimately responsible for all the \ndiversity and complexity of life we see on earth. Theism predicted only God \ncreated life on earth \u2013 The mutation rate to DNA is overwhelmingly \ndetrimental. Detrimental to such a point that it is seriously questioned \nwhether there are any truly beneficial, information building, mutations \nwhatsoever. (M. Behe; JC Sanford) -\n\n14. Naturalism/Materialism predicted morality is subjective and illusory. \nTheism predicted morality is objective and real. Morality is found to be \ndeeply embedded in the genetic responses of humans. As well, morality is \nfound to be deeply embedded in the structure of the universe. Embedded to \nthe point of eliciting physiological responses in humans before humans \nbecome aware of the morally troubling situation and even prior to the event \neven happening.\n\n15. Naturalism/Materialism predicted that we are merely our material bodies \nwith no transcendent component to our being, and that we die when our \nmaterial bodies die. Theism predicted that we have minds/souls that are \ntranscendent of our bodies that live past the death of our material bodies. \nTranscendent, and \u2018conserved\u2019, (cannot be created or destroyed), \n\u2018non-local\u2019, (beyond space-time matter-energy), quantum \nentanglement/information, which is not reducible to matter-energy \nspace-time, is now found in our material bodies on a massive scale.",

Once the knife hits the butter, it \nwill move through it at 2mph. So say the stick of butter was moving towards \nthe knife at 3mph and the knife is still moving at 2mph, the knife is still \ngoing to cut through the butter. But this time its going to cut through the \nbutter at 5mph. So a 9mm bullet is moving at 820 miles per hour at a person \nwho is moving at 830 miles per hour toward the bullet. The end result would \nbe the same as the same bullet being fired at 1,650mph a still person . \nWoah :)",

A few times a year my dentist's office calls me to \nmake sure I make my appointments which is great because they not only clean \nand scale and coat my teeth but my flossing frequency totally follows a \nbell curve that peaks around the week my my appointment during which they \nsupply me with all kids of implements that make it hard to find excuses not \nto floss for at least the next month...\nI wish I had someone to call me from a dermatologists office for example to \nmap out some of those suspicious looking moles to see if any malignancy is \nforming... and I bet just like after a dentists visit you would come out \nwith a goody bag of sunscreens and and the like.\nThe thing with cancer is early detection ups your chances more than \nanything else so I agree that frequent visits while you are healthy to \nactual health professionals not to people that tell you to stop eating \ngluten is probably your best bet.",

I don't see any big \nnews networks talking about a cancer cure. This is just a small experiment, \nlike all the other 30030303947390478 small experiments against cancer\n\nget over yourself you dumbass. \n\nalso from your own article since you like to pinpoint one's reading \ncomprehension\n\n\"The other two had inoperable tumors left over after the primaries were \nremoved. In both cases, the cancers were not growing 8-9 months after the \nprocess. However, in neither case is it possible to definitively credit the \nvaccine since other treatments were also used.\" \n\nsee that last part that starts with HOWEVER?\n\nyeah, that's why this is SMALL news.\n\nanyway stop trying to prove something that you can't prove.\n\nGo take your vaccine shots and chemotherapy, I would rather DIE than take \nchemotherapy and part of the reason is not  conspiracies, but rather my own \naunt who DIED from cancer after she took chemo. She was only 34 years old \nand looked like she was going to make it, and the stupid doctor gave her \nchemo and after her chemo, I could tell by the look on her face that she \nwill die and she did soon after. I can't say cancer killed her, because \ntruthfully chemo killed her. She would have been living many years if she \ndidn't take chemo. Too bad back then I didn't know about cannabis oil and \nsuch. But now I do. But anyways, fuck off, you are a waste of my time. I am \nhealthy disease free, haven't had a cold or flue in over 10 years and I am \nonly 27 years old. Coincidentally , I also haven't been taking any \nvaccine shots in the last 10 years.\n\nBut of course I must be lying right. Anyway no point arguing with me, \nbecause you are wrong and no matter how many bullshit articles you show me, \nyou won't prove nothing since you are just a sheep. The Govt is very proud \nof your kind and their work for brainwashing your kind. Believe me, I am \nnot the only one who thinks like this, especially internationally. Most of \nyour kind are westerners, and most of my kind are not.",

And by you suggesting nature isn't good \nenough and we can improve nature, are you really so arrogant that you \nbelieve humans could have created a better universe than what we already \nhave? You say we are 'striving for improvement' well in my opinion, humans \nmay be attempting that but really look at our race, all we seem to have \ndone is turn lovely countries full of trees, grasslands, thousands of \nspecies of animals all co-existing into masses of concrete and buildings ( \nand the oceans we shouldn't even be able to be on since we are land \nmammals, into a massive pool of our unwanted rubbish. it is disgusting) \nwith only humans and a few select animals we decide we like enough to have \nas pets, who pose no threat, and any dogs or other animals that are \nconsidered dangerous are killed.

I am not suggesting killing of every human, that is despicable \nand the fact any person has ever attempted that is one of the reasons i \ndespise humans.

We believe humans are superior to every other animal, why \nbecause we have morals? is knowingly harming, torturing, killing masses of \nanimals incapable of protecting themselves just to benefit the human race a \ngood thing? I am not saying i am right, who knows you may be right, if \nthere even is a right or wrong in this case. All I am saying is; I believe \nhumans have made this world worse than it was before us.

Had we not always wanted to \nlive longer and tried our best to stay alive, you probably wouldn't have \nbeen born, or your best friend wouldn't have, or your lover, or \nany/everyone you care about...\n\nAnd please stop with all the \"overpopulation\" crap. Anyone arguing for that \nis either a hypocrite or terribly selfish, because, if you really think \nmore deaths is a good thing, why don't you just kill yourself? Or would you \nrather have your mother die, or again, your brother, best friend, \nboy/girlfriend, or anyone you care about? You do realize anyone we're \nletting die has family and people who care about them, right? Why is death \nso cheap as long as you're not involved?\n\nPlease think for a moment before proposing what is, to me, equivalent to \ngenocide.",

When the malignancy is \nremoved, there might already be circulating cancer cells, ready to find a \nnew tissue to grow in. These are also very few, and thus hard to see (you'd \nhave to collect a lot of blood). They are also very different, so if you \nfind one, you might miss another.\nI think we are as healthy as we need to be for survival and reproduction, \nevolutionarily speaking (in the population). Then, with health care, we can \nmaintain an even higher (more comfortable) life. Old people that are \nhealthy are really amazing. Healthy living and some sort of purpose (work, \nreligion, family etc.) can take you far. But then again, a lot of people \nwho don't \"deserve\" it, dies too early.",

Some atoms are unstable, \nthey need to share electrons with others to be stable. When they do such, \nthey are molecules(or ionic compounds/ metals, but, for the sake of \nsimplicity, the info in parenthesys is unneeded). Molecules can have an \nunstable atom at their edge, that will let molecules combine with \neachother. Lots of molecules make up macromolecular stuff. If said stuff is \nnot water or a salt(ionic compound), then it is biologic. Biologic matter, \nif combined in a specific way, may create cells. Bigger cells may get \nsmaller cells to help them (mythocondriae are used by animal cells to \nprocess oxygen and sugar/fat), and then they can then be called \neucarionthys cells. These are the ones that make up animals, plants and \nfungi. The brain is made out of those. These cells make tissues, \ncollections of cells with same behaviour: bone tissue, blood tissue, \nnervous tissue, muscle, etc. \n\nThe brain is composed of nervous tissue. Nervous tissue stimulates other \ntissues to do their job, through electrical impulses released due to atomic \nflow inside of nervous cells. Therefore, without a brain, other human \ntissue wouldn't be able to do their job and deteriorate (that is, their \ncells will stop absorbing energy and the smaller cells inside them will \nconsume their hosts. While blood tissue dies quickly, bone tissue takes a \nlong time). Life, however, is a term with different interpretations. I'll \nuse this one \"You're alive as long as you're not dead.\". So, each cell has \na different life. The death of all the cells in a tissue makes the tissue \ndead. The death of all the tissues make the organ dead. With all the organs \ndead, you are dead. Final veredict: you can live without a brain, but for a \nshort time. When your brain dies, the medula still makes your heart beat \nfor some time, then dies right after (so in 10 minutes you'd be considered \ndead, unless you can keep the medula alive. What would define your life \ntime then would be the blood tissue, when it dies everything is done.). \nWhen your heart dies first, tho, hte brain stays alive for 6-72 hours.\n\nSo, in short, atoms - molecules - macromolecules - compounds - biological \ncompounds - small cells - big cells - tissues - organs - organism (which \nrefers to you). In crescent order. Hope I helped.",

The money goes in to all sorts of studies, but that doesn't mean \nthey are going to find a solution to stage 3 or stage 4 cancer. Many people \ndon't even know they have cancer until its too late. If everyone found out \nthey had cancer in the early stages, I bet the death rate would be much \nmuch lower.\n\nBut people ignore symptoms. Part of that is because if you have an issue \nand you look online, just about everything is a symptom of cancer.  You \naren't going to go to the doctors unless you discover a lump or are so \ndebilitated that you have no other choice. Otherwise people would be at the \ndoctors office all the time.\n\nIm sure a lot of the money that goes in to cancer research just ends up in \nsomeone's pocket, but that isn't the main reason we haven't had that much \nsuccess saving people. Its because cancer is your own body attacking \nitself. How do you fight that? The only ways we currently know include \neither literally destroying our bodies with radiation and chemo, and \ncutting out large chunks to remove the cancer. The treatments are almost as \nbad as the disease. There isn't a way to tell a specific part of the body \nto stop replicating cells.",

There is a unifying nature of being \nBritish of course, but that doesn't make it the same country. There isn't a \noverarching nationality, there has been an overarching monarchy and the two \nare not the same.\n\nIf you argue that a unified monarchy constitutes as a country in it's own \nright you would be incorrect. The union of kingdoms did not represent the \nunification of peoples. It was power over multiple countries. It would be \nlike saying the Angevin Empire was all one country. It of course stretched \nfrom England and across the west of France, however it wasn't one country. \nThe peoples within the empire were separate but unified under the crown or \nthe influence of the crown.\n\nNow if you want to argue that it is a country you are incorrect. The term \nused to describe the UK is a sovereign state which you should know if you \nstudy history. It is made up of constituent countries. So indeed the \nstatement that the UK is a country is incorrect. The statement would be \ncorrect if you said it was a sovereign state.\n\nI am also proud to be known as british. However it should be recognised \nthat England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not the same. I \nidentify as Scottish because I am, you identify as English because you are. \nWe both may identify as British.\n\nI however prefer to be known as my national identity and country which is \nScotland because I feel it is in many ways separate. Just as you would \nprefer to be known as English because is many ways it is separate.\n\nThe historical and cultural difference for being Scottish, English, Welsh \nor Northern Irish is strong enough to warrant them as separate national \nidentities.\n\nI however am not against identifying as British (although there may be an \nincorrect stigma attached to it). Also a lot of the national identity of \nbeing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish is wiped out by the term British \nwhen used abroad (mostly the United States) because the attachment of \ncertain very English centric ideas to the word. I am perfectly okay to \nidentify as British to non ignorant people, but you never know whom might \nbe.\n\nAlso being Scottish there is a certain feeling of separation from England. \nNot a spiteful one but the mentality of a Scottish person I find is very \ndifferent from an English person.",
