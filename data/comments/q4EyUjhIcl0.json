So this high-tech fusion reactor will still be \nrelying on basically 19th century technology. Of course, current turbines \nare way more efficient than they used to be, but that's still wanting. I'd \nlike to see scientists come up with a more effective way to generate \nelectricity from the energy released by H fusion.\ufeff",

So I misspoke, it was california not russia, I got \nconfused from the OP talking about russia.   But it is interesting that \nthey received the same results in russia, still no ignition though it \nsounds like.  Also upon re-reading it they weren't going for a critical \nmass, they used a very small amount of fuel only.  But both of those terms \nrelate to a self sustaining process and there is indeed a chain reaction in \nnuclear fusion... its kind of the definition of 'ignition'.

Damage done : a few hundred million USD, maybe even up to 1 \nbillion. Thats it. Not a single human harmed - its physically impossible \nfor the plasma to do more damage - and unlike atom splitting this disaster \nwont contaminate anything - because there is nothing to radiate with, \natomic fusion FUSES particles - thats the complete opposite of atomic \nsplitting.

They fly away from the plasma because the are \nelectrically neutral the magnetic confinement does not affect them. The \nneutrons heat up the wall of the tokamak which in turn heats water spinning \na turbine. Needless to say there is no way to stop radioactivity only a way \nto contain it. The problem with tokamaks is not the obvious radioactivity \nit is making any amount of usable energy. There is no immense gravity field \nsquashing everything together. To counteract the lack of gravity you need A \nLOT more heat; so much heat that there is no net gain in energy making the \nfusion reaction a neat science experiment, but nothing more. The one that \nfigures out how to achieve net fusion is the worlds first trillionaire. ",

                    "text": "So, gonna say things here.\n\nHave you ever heard of micro evolution? It's something that's been proven \nin labs countless times. They take animals with very short breeding cycles, \nsuch as flies, and find genetic traits that are expressed visually. Things \nlike different wing colors and such. (The exact example I use may not be \naccurate, but the general idea is still the same, for those of you who may \nwish to nitpick me.)\n\nThey then take the flies, or whatever they're using, that express these \ngenetic traits, and isolate them. Then, they let them breed. Continue this \nprocess, removing any organisms that contain undesired traits, and \neventually the isolated population produces only the trait that was \nisolated without any contamination of other traits that may change the wing \ncolor, or whatever else is being isolated.\n\nThis is micro evolution, the whole 'natural selection' thing, where \nundesireble traits which hinder the survival of the species are, gradually, \nremoved.\n\nNow, another thing. You've probably heard of genetic mutations, yes? Things \nlike autism, down syndrome, all these things that happen at birth? Well, \nthose are caused by the same broad event that allows us to have so many \nhair colors, eye colors, and even different species. Genetic mutations.\n\nMany genetic mutations are bad. However, there are also many that are \neither harmless or even beneficial. It could be compared to throwing bouncy \nballs at a wall with a cup behind you. Throw enough - might be hundreds, \nthousands, millions - and one will eventually land in the cup. The ones \nthat miss are the mutations that either do nothing, or mess things up. The \nones that land in the cup are the beneficial ones that help the carriers of \nthe trait survive more effectively, even in a minute manner.\n\nNow, I've told you about micro evolution, and genetic mutations, and how \ngenetic mutations can, effectively, cause micro evolution. The evolutionary \ntheory, however, as my miniscule understanding of it can tell, deals mainly \nin macro evolution.\n\nMacro evolution is these two things, plus a whole fuck-load of time. We're \ntalking, not hundreds, not thousands, but hundreds of thousand, if not \nmillions, of years. Small trait changes happen via genetic mutation. Many, \nmany, many, MAAAANY, instances of micro evolution and natural selection \nspread them around. This is what causes macro evolution.\n\nThe evidence of this can be found in the fossil record and the view into \nmany transitional species, in the way DNA is replicated, in the way that \nthe flies function in the lab, even in the exchange of DNA between \nbacteria. Literally, the evidence for the evolutionary theory is all around \nyou. It plays a part in your day-to-day life.\n\nProvided you read all that, can you really say that \"they is a complete \nretard\" anymore?",

A very similar martial is used in your computer hard \ndrive, and allows it to 'save' information (positive charge/negative charge \nie 1's and 0's) even after the power is gone.  Which is why running a \nmagnet over your computer hard drive can damage the data...it changes the \nmagnetic state of the bits.\n\nIt's not so much about creating a magnet or a magnetic material, it's about \ngenerating a magnetic field with varying power in a way that you can \ncontrol.\n\nIn the video, Hank mentioned that the steel will be shaped into loops to \nmake massive magnetic coils.  The shape is what's important here.  He's \ndescribing an electromagnetic coil, where a conductor (steel) is wound \naround a core or form to create an inductor or electromagnet.  When \nelectricity is passed threw the coil, it generates a magnetic field.  The \nadvantage is, you can have a magnet that varies in power based on how much \nelectricity you feed it.  A natural magnet cannot produce anything close to \nthe power an electromagnet can, and we can't change a natural magnets state \n(well we can..it's a pain) to suit our needs.\n\nAnd in order to have a good and efficient electromagnet, it's best if you \nstart with a material that doesn't generate it's own magnetic field, but \ncan hold one very well.",
