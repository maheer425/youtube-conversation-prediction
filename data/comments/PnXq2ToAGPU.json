Plus the \nimport tax that they charge for imported goods.I wasn't aware how backwards \nBrazil was.And it's supposed to be the economic leader in South & Latin \nAmerica.\nI'm not saying Brazil is a awful country but the corruption is absolutely \nhorrendous as is the poverty and income disparity. And the citizens feel so \npowerless to stop it. But I will give Brazil this...they have the most \nconsiderate, caring, loving, and feminine women on the planet.

But i mean \ncome on, this is America we are talking about. The Dem's and Reps wont let \nthe system go away, even if the American people want it to. The US is run \nby the Elite (Rich) and cater to the supports of the Elite (Big \nCorporations). Nothing will get done until they go.\n\nI do not think that we should get rid of the Parties, i think we should \nimplement various ways in order to establish a Government that is actually \nFOR the people, instead of FOR profit and the Wealthiest. I mean seriously, \nwe are at a deficit, and we have been at a deficit for a long time. When \nare we gonna fix our nation before we try to fix another? That's one of our \nGovernments main problems, however an even bigger on is that they just \ndon't give a fuck. War = Money. One day i think America will be greater \nthan its ever been, but i don't see that happening anytime soon. If \nanything, I see this Government destroying America with Wars, Recessions, \nDebt, all the meanwhile the Lower and Middle Class's will be blamed, while \nthe Rich horde all their money.",
