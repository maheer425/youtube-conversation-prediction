                "text": "A question: When you say 'good seed and good fertilizer', what does that \nmean? If I remember my history correctly, there was a huge increase in \nagricultural output in the West in the 20th century due to mechanization \nand the advent of artificial fertilizer. Now, most artificial fertilizer is \nmade using lots of fossil fuels, releasing green house gasses into our dear \natmosphere. Basically, I'm wondering if 'good fertilizer' is the kind that \ncontributes directly to global warming, or something else. I think using \nartificial fertilizer could make sense in the short run to bring up \nproduction, but seeing as we all, globally, should have stopped using \nfossil fuels a couple of decades ago, having even more people being even \nmore dependent upon them makes me sad.\ufeff",

Fertilizer and 'new' seeds are great inputs for increasing yield in the \nshort-term, and especially when the goal is reducing malnutrition (probably \nthe most important of all), but in the long term, these strategies decrease \nbiodiversity and overall land fertility, so they're a good quick fix for \nthe goal at hand, but aren't sustainable in the long run. \n\n2. Are we increasing all yields and stores, or just for maize? If maize \nbegins to displace other parts of the diet because of its \nreliability/affordability, it could possibly lead to pellagra, in extreme \nconditions. \n\n3. We want these women to have more money because they have a tendency to \n'reinvest' it back into their families, which increases life expectancy for \nkids. Men in the developing world, however, sometimes have the tendency to \nspend all that money on things like alcohol and prostitution. How the heck \ndo we fix that, or do we just accept that it may happen?\n\nAll things considered, I definitely believe food security will be one of \nthe biggest challenges of this century.

(And have fun :D) 4) If you are selected, you are invited to \nattend the World Food Prize Symposium for free! There, you meet TONS of \nwonderful, knowledgeable people who want to help you help the world. :) 5) \nYou have the opportunity to apply to all-expenses-paid summer international \ninternships and paid local research internships. \n\nIt's a challenging experience, but it could completely change your scope on \nthe world.

The ''terminator gene'' that people worried about \nwas never even put into commercial use, and even if it did, how can \nsomething sterile propagate sterility? That hardly makes sense. I suggest \nyou try to actually show me actual products for sale out there in the \nmarket that contain this trait.\n\nSecondly, like I said before, the biggest issue is not the bloody GMOs \nthemselves, it's the agricultural system as a whole.\n\nThirdly, the whole Percy Schmeisser scandal is interesting because this guy \nfound out he had GM seeds in his land, was notified by the vendor that he \nhad them, and decided to grow them anywhow, despite warnings. While I think \nthat the idea of patenting seeds may be unethical in certain cases, you \nhave to realise that the guy straight up broke the law knowingly and thus \nwas taken to court.",

His \noverexcited, overwhelming display of uncertainty, helplessness before what \nhe described as \"immensely complex\" task. Listen closely at what he is \nsaying. His key fraise is \"....the truth about [how to contribute to \nsolving agricultural problems] is complicated and messy, and *any easy \nnarratives* you may hear are 'TOO SIMPLISTIC' in my opinion\".\n\nWhat I think he meant by \" easy narratives \" are principles. If someone \nwould attempt to show him a set of principles by which you can simplify \nsolving this particular problem he would immediately dismiss it as being \n\"too simplistic\". This is the symptom of pragmatism which is, \nunfortunately, the main method of solving issues today. \n\nNo wonder he looked stressed. Pragmatism leads you to believe that there \nare no principles or real solutions. There is only random, helpless, range \nof the moment reactions or attempts to randomly plug holes in a leaking \ndam. Pragmatism is the rejection of principled solutions in favor of short \nterm, range of the moment, knee jerk, fighting small fires as they occur \nand dismissing the *cause* of fires as \"too simplistic \". *Pragmatism is \nthe fetish of complexity*.\n\nThis video is a prime example.\nNote that his goal is not to show you how to simplify the problem and \nattack it more effectively. His goal is to show you how complex the problem \nis and how terribly difficult or even hopeless it is to even begin solving \nit. And if someone attempts to show you a general pattern or a principle \nyou must immediately dismiss it as being \"not complex enough\" or, in other \nwords, \"*too simplistic*\". This nonsense is a typical result of today's \ndisastrously wrong approach to most problems. \nThe right approach is the principled approach. We must look at what is the \ncause of fires before fighting them. In this case, as he mentioned, we must \neliminate the irrational laws propped up by corrupted Ethiopian politicians \nwhich ban the export of corn to give people the incentive to have excess \nproduction of corn. Also, the lack of the basic principles of human rights, \nsuccessful women farmers are *forced* by the tribe (collective) to \nsurrender all profit to the husband. This tradition is old and very \ndestructive.\nAnother thing, because the US/EU was supplying corn for free anyway, there \nwere less incentives to produce it. \nCharity and relief should be very short term help to any country that \ndeserves it, so we must make it clear that mooching is not a sustainable \nstrategy. Decades long UN/US/EU \"relief\" programs are a big part of the \nproblem and not a solution. Showering them with aid is wrong and it needs \nto stop gradually within a a few years. Only when Ethiopian government \nunderstands that they cannot hide behind foreign aid and need to liberate \nthe economy to allow market forces to operate unobstructed, only then \nEthiopia will begin to rise from the ashes of tribal primitivism.\n\nThe cause of the agricultural problems in Ethiopia is not lack of our help, \nbut lack of appreciation of the importance of principles. \n\n\n\n",
