In a capitalist system there are natural barriers to smaller \nentities and the patent system is an antiquated form of addressing this. \nThe problem is that large entities are exploiting the same system that \nprotects these entities and are threatening economic growth (particularly \nin the IT industry). When a system becomes counterproductive it needs to be \nreplaced, that's only logical. \n\nI never did understand the notion that being an inventor somehow entitles \nyou to millions of dollars. You are entitled to the credit and if someone \ndeems your product profitable, monetary compensation from a larger entity.\n\nPS: If suggesting a bad economic system should be removed constitutes a \nUtopian fantasy, slavery would still be the norm.",

In the previous crisises \nof capitalism, government placed limits on what capitalist corporations \ncould do. And what happened afterwards? Those corporations slowly undid \nthose regulations. The same thing will happen again and again, if we don't \nlearn from history. Only this time, the corporations will undo regulations \nin a much shorter time span, since they have become quite experienced in \nmanipulating the government and placed their cronies and yes-men \nstrategically in both the democratic and republican party.\n\nYou don't need top down capitalism or wealthy entrepeneurs to build an \neconomy. Worker cooperatives are a viable alternative.\nA succesful example would be the Mandrag\u00f3n Cooperative Corporation in the \nBasque region of Spain. Founded in 1943 by a catholic priest and six \nworkers; it now employs over 90,000 workers, includes more than 250 \ncompanies, and generates a annual revenue of roughly $25 billion. The only \ndifference with a capitalist corporation is that the cooperative is \ncollectively owned by its employees, and that the highest paid worker is \npaid less than six times that of the lowest paid worker. Smaller \ncooperatives in the US, like the Union Cab Company, Arizmendi Bakery, and \nthe Cheese Board Collective also had their successes. The only downside for \nright-wingers is that they don't let CEOs rake in millions while their \nworkers suffer.",

They sneak it in so nobody really notices, then they jack it up \nlittle by little so it weans people off solar.\nBiodiesel for your cars can be made in your garage from kitchen scraps and \nold grease, but who wants to have a chemistry set and a production plant in \ntheir yard when there'll be biofuel stations selling at gasoline prices or \nhigher?\nWind is ok if you're in the right area, but aside from massive corporate \nowned windfarms, its not a practical source countrywide, maybe as a backup \nor secondary source locally.\nHydroelectric we've had for a long time, and it goes without saying that's \nnot something you can do personally.\nGeothermal, I don't know, if that ever becomes practical for home use, \nit'll be an innovation out of Iceland because they use that a lot.\nBut solar.... solar, I don't know.  it's come a long way, and it's only \ngoing to get better and cheaper as the tech improves, the key is \ndistribution.  If everyone had like a bit of their roof dedicated to solar, \nthat'd kill Oil as we know it, or at least diminish it.  But they're going \nto do everything in their power to keep it expensive.  Though I've been \nreading good things about that shingle or paint like solar panel that still \nworks pretty good for pennies on the dollar that doesn't even look like \ntraditional panels.  If they can get that down, it seems inevitable it's \ngoing to get widely distributed, no matter what.\nThe key to killing stuff like this is to stop it while its still in its \ninfancy, so it can't advance to the point where it becomes a no brainer in \nthe marketplace.\nI mean, the early car was no competition for horse drawn carriages until it \ngot refined over the years to where it could outcompete carriages in the \nmarketplace, and I'm sure there were naysayers back then that said the car \nwould never replace the carriage.\nThe longer solar remains viable economically, the more likely it is to \nbecome the next core energy source.\nKoch just isn't smart for not getting into this, scumbag tactics \nnotwithstanding.",
