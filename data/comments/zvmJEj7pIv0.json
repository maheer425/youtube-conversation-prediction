(so you might \nunwittingly be doing more harm than good with the switch)\n\nmore often than not they contain their own slew of chemicals that are not \nso safe for humans. usually they are simple hormone disruptors that mimic \ncertain already occurring hormonal chems in our body, which might sound \nharmless but it can actually REALLY throw your bodies natural \nsynchronization systems out of whack as hormones need to stay in specific \n(usually very low quantities) in order to work properly.\n\nbut in some cases the fillers used are known cancer causing agents\n\n\na good place to look up what certain chemicals do for your body is the \nenvironmental workers group data base that has a collection that you can \ncheck all of the chemicals found in nearly any cosmetic and the rating on \nwhat each chemical can do to you body. its a really great place to check if \nyou are really interested in what chemicals are actually doing to your body \nfrom scientific perspective as all of there conclusions are rated based on \nactual peer reviewed studies and not careless assumption\n\nhttp://www.ewg.org/skindeep/\n\nhope i cleared up some confusion.",
