I hate the \nSarma because the vine leaves taste sour and oily and the cabbage leaves... \nWell I just like raw cabbage.\nThe others are really great like the meat combo and their yogurt drink is \ngood. Just don't drink it much since yogurt can leave people constipated \nafter a while.\ufeff",

You're right about \nsarma, there are only few dishes that can beat the taste of good ol' sarma. \nAnd the best one is the mix of pork and beef. Still, if Gola245 doesn't \nlike it, he or she (don't know the gender) can try that recipe I \nrecomended. Mix beef with some lamb (more beef than lamb) and put some nice \nspices into the fillings. Try to wrap fillings with some fermented cabbage \nleaves if you can find it in UAE.",

Also, we use pork meat, but you can try to mix \nlamb and calf meat or lamb with beef and ad some spices in fillings like \ngarlic and onion and dried/dehydrated parsley and of course salt and \npepper. The filling is also better if you braise it first with onion and \ngarlic and pepper (the vegetable, not the spice; if you can find \ndried/dehydrated powdered red pepper, sweet or hot, use it, but be careful \nwith the hot pepper). Put some dried/dehydrated laurel leaves by the end of \ncooking on top of the wrapped sarmas (not in the fillings) and it'll taste \nbetter, 2 or 3 leaves, don't overdo it. Also, if you have some smoked meat, \nput it at the begging of cooking, side by side, with the wrapped sarmas. \nIt'll be more delicious. \n\nThere is also the sarma made of walnut and dried/dehydrated and smoked \nplums or apricots (we put it in the fillings with rice; we also put rice in \nthe fillings of the meat-sarma). We make it when we fast. I don't know the \nrecipe for it, I think my friend does, because we eat it when we celebrate \nhis slava (a sort of family holiday, religious type of holiday), because \nit's on the day when the christian fast. It's very, very delicious, you \nwouldn't believe it. ",

Alison Phillips, who wrote the history of the Greek revolution, noted \nin 1897:\n\nEverywhere, as though at a preconcerted signal, the peasantry rose, and \nmassacred all the Turks\u2014men, women and children\u2014on whom they could lay \nhands. In the Morea shall no Turk be left. Nor in the whole wide world. \nThus rang the song which, from mouth to mouth, announced the beginning of a \nwar of extermination... Within three weeks of the outbreak of the revolt, \nnot a Muslim was left, save those who had succeeded in escaping into the \ntowns.\n\nWilliam St Claire wrote: \n\n\nThe Turks of Greece left few traces. They disappeared suddenly and finally \nin the spring of 1821 unmourned and unnoticed by the rest of the \nworld....It was hard to believe then that Greece once contained a large \npopulation of Turkish descent, living in small communities all over the \ncountry, prosperous farmers, merchants, and officials, whose families had \nknown no other home for hundreds of years...They were killed deliberately, \nwithout qualm or scruple, and there was no regrets either then or later\n\nW. Alison Phillips, The War of Greek Independence,\n\nFor three days the miserable inhabitants were given over to lust and \ncruelty of a mob of savages. Neither sex nor age was spared. Women and \nchildren were tortured before being put to death. So great was the \nslaughter that Kolokotronis himself says that, from the gate to the citadel \nhis horse\u2019s hoofs never touched the ground. His path of triumph was \ncarpeted with corpses. At the end of two days, the wretched remnant of the \nMussulmans were deliberately collected, to the number of some two thousand \nsouls, of every age and sex, but principally women and children, were led \nout to a ravine in the neighboring mountains and there butchered like cattle",

On the Armenian Genocide, I am skeptical \non both sides since there was a war going on in those areas where the \nRussians were invading and there were Armenian rebel groups that were \npro-Russian fighting the Turks as well as Kurdish ones during that messy \ntime period. The diaspora caused by these events have led to more Armenians \nliving outside of modern Armenia (or East Armenia) than in it.

It's not .. and 50% of the population *WASN'T KILLED* unless you're \ntalking about the Turks and Muslims the Greeks massacred. The fact that 50% \nof the population was Muslim doesn't mean that the Ottomans had to kill 50% \nof Greece to replace them with Muslims, are you this dumb?  \n\n2. The Reason Greece isn't Muslim hasn't got anything to do with \n\"resistance to Islam\" it's because we allowed you to practice your \nreligion. A courtesy you did not extend to the Muslims after your \nindependence. If we were so horrible we would have forced you to convert or \nwiped you out. \n\n\n3. It doesn't matter how long ago it was, it doesn't make it better. *THE \nFALLACY* DURING THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, The Ottoman empire was literally one of \nthe if not the MOST tolerant empire in the world compared to others. So if \nyou're going to make the argument that it's ok because it was normal at the \ntime. *you could make the SAME Argument for the Ottomans* but this fact \nseems to fly over your head. What Ottomans did was completely in line with \nwhat happened back then. Every empire did the same the difference is that \nwhile the Spanish were massacring Jews and non Christians/non Catholics \netc. The Ottomans were saving hundreds of thousands of Jews and allowing \neveryone to practice their own religion. \n\n4. Funny because Greece doesn't call them Turks in fact made it illegal to \ndo so .. Greece prefers \"Greek Muslims\" haha. The Turks in Thrace live near \nTurkey are safe .. if Greeks try to massacre them Turkey will simply do the \nsame as they did with Cyprus. \n\nSo what if Cyprus was Greek first? You think those Greeks fell from the \nsky, you're so damn dumb .. Turks settled there hundreds of years ago, no \none cares when the Greeks settled there, that doesn't mean you can just \nwipe out the Turks on the Island and be surprised when Turkey steps in to \nprotect the Turks. \n\nSame goes for Turkey. Turkey has been TURKISH for a thousand years now .. I \ncouldn't care less if greeks were there first. They weren't indigenous and \nwere invaders them selves. \n\n5. Anatolia NEVER had a Greek majority, not during or after Alexander. The \nlingua franca was Greek and some of the monarchies were. But They were \nNEVER greek majority. Also Byzantine empire as in NO WAY greek. Again \nlingua franca was greek. But Byzantines NEVER called them selves greek or \neven byzantine. They called them selves ROMAN, it was a multi cultural \nempire, ruled by a roman monarchy. \n\n\n6. *GREEKS DO NOT ORIGINATE FROM ANATOLIA NEITHER* how ignorant are you? \nAlso we dd not come from \"Turkmenistan\" .. We came from Altai, Tarim Basin, \nTurkestan and central Asia in general. Nor did we invade Anatolia in the \ndark ages *Greeks INVADED and later settled Anatolia .. they did not \noriginate here) ",

When Bosnians saw what was coming, they \nwere crying like babies and asked NATO for help. Of course, they gladly \nhelped them with killing more Serbs. And for Albanians on Kosovo, Kosovo \nwas Serbian territory. Serbs lived there. Now, when Tito was ruling he gave \nAlbanians permission to inhabit Kosovo. They were getting social help and \nhalf of a country was working just so the Kosovo and Albanians in it could \nhave better life. They got what they wanted, when they overpopulated \nKosovo, and Tito died, they saw a chance that they might create their own \ncountry and unite with Albania. So, thats what they did, they started \nburning Serbian villages, killing people in them. But they couldn't do all \nthat and not be war criminals, right? So, NATO saw another chance, they \nhelped Albanians by promising them that they will have their own country \nand that they will spread lies about how Serbs did genocide. They agreed \nwith that and the consequences of it we can see today. I think, that in \nthis century, everything is going to stabilaze and hate between Balkan \nnations will disappear.

For example Sarma made in Serbia, and Sarma made in Turkey are \nvastly different in taste and texture. And also have some different \ningredients (Exclusively soured cabbage is used as well as bacon/smoked \nham/ smoked sausage and its cooked in a special kind of dish and at the end \na special pan fried combination of minced paprika/peppers/flour/garlic is \nadded). Thus, it is a regional dish. It is true that it originated in the \nOttoman Empire, but it is not a part of the Turkish cuisine. So it would be \ncorrect to say that Serbian Sarma originated from the Ottoman Empire, but \nit would not be correct to say that it is a part of the Turkish Cuisine.",

Now because they are lost (the so-called macedonians) \nand they do not have facts do prove their desired identity and to oppose \nBullgarians and Greeks, they have no better thing to do but to hate and to \ninsult Albanians who are very respected, brave and honorable people with \nsuch declarations like these above, by spreading lies and propaganda, but \nfortunately as time is passing by the world is learning the truth, little \nby little ;)\n\nAdio.. :)",

Kefir is a mix of Airan(Milk let out for 2 days outside then turn into \nYoghurt then mixed with more milk,salt then becomes Airan) some milk plus \nmore things that I don't know D: +shlqrsh And erm..

Yes, its very \ncommon in areas of former Yugoslavia historically influenced by the Ottoman \nEmpire, but its not indigenous \"Balkan\" food. The best term overall would \nprobably be \"Ottoman cuisine\", as in the cuisine of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n*Kefir* - a drink originating from the Caucasus region.\n\n*Burek* and *baklava* - Greek dishes of course, originating well away from \nthe Balkans peninsula: on the island of Cyprus.\n\n*Sarma* - from the Turkish word \"sarmak\", \"to roll up\", a Turkish dish.\n\n*Cevapi* - a Balkans evolution of the kebab, an Iranian dish adopted \nheavily by the Turks and brought with them into the Balkans. The word \nactually derives from the Iranian (Farsi) word \"kabap\" (\"kabap\" -> \n\"cevap\"), meaning \"to fry\".\n\n*Tufahije* - an Iranian (Persian) dish historically common in the entire \nOttoman Empire.\n\n*Shopska salad* - a Bulgarian side-dish. So yeah, its from the Balkans, \namazingly, but its not a former Yugoslav dish for the record.\n\n\n4:29 He's right. The Balkans don't really have their own cuisine. Maybe a \nrogue meal or two, but its all basically Turkish or Italian (in Dalmatia \nand Istria) or Hungarian/German (in the north). But I admit that point is \ndebateable.. who knows what it takes to have your own proper \"cuisine\".\n\nI'm from \"the Balkans\", btw... Split, Croatia.\ufeff",

There may be some \ndifferent versions but their origins are Turkish. And even the names of the \nfood in Turkish like burek (originally \"b\u00f6rek\") and sarma (litterally \n\"wrapping\" or \"rolling\" the verb for\"sar-\" \"to wrap\"). Please, try visiting \na Turkish restaurant despite of all Turkish hatred in the comments. There \nare many Turkish restaurants with good Turkish chefs in the U.S. And if you \ncan, please visit Turkey as you will have the finest cuisine in the world. \nOr, maybe have a Turkey branch of Buzzfeed, how about that :)\nWarm regards\nA friend :)\ufeff",

You think that nationalism (on the \nstadiums and in general) is exclusive for your two nations? Grow up and \ngrow up fast my dear because what you are saying later (up to a certain \npoint) makes me believe you are no different then the hooligans them self! \nWhy? That will bring us to a second part... (I am not going to comment the \nbooing and shouting of murderous paroles and nationalistic ambitions - \nthat's what FIFA should do...) What second half? The game was interrupted \nsomewhere around the 40th minute of the first half if I am not mistaking \nand was never continued??? So let us pause here and see how this \ninterruption (all hell broke loose) occurred... A drone carrying an \nautochthonous flag flew into the stadium... I have to ask you this because \nyou skipped an important part... Who controlled the drone and for what \npurpose? The implications of such act regardless of country, religion and \ncreed are obvious and preposterous by it self!  The flag... Now imagine the \nsame situation in a game between my country (Germany) and let say Israel, \nwhere Israel is the host... And the flag is carrying a swastika, or \"Arbeit \nmacht frei\", or \"Mein Kampf\"??? What do you thing would happen? Shalom \naleichem perhaps? But let's get back to the \"autochthonous\" flag as you \nsay... I have asked numerous Albanians about the symbolism of that \nparticular flag and all of them here in Berlin told me (proudly) that it \nrepresents basically your national(istic) craving to unite all land where \nAlbanians live! If my memory serves me well, NATO bombed the shit out of \nSerbia for having exactly the same intentions!?? So in general, your \nfootball players protected a national(istic) craving - they didn't protect \na flag of Albania (just to recap, the game was between Serbia and Albania, \nright?) or Kosovo what could be understood as \"kind\" of normal (if you \nconsider \"normal\" hoisting your flag on a drone) but an idea that caused so \nmuch human suffering in the beginning! No shit Sherlock, your players were \nafraid of entering the second half??? And you say that you understand this \nall was a provocation??? What is wrong with you...? The resulting beating \nof your players comes as no wonder to be honest but that goes entirely on \nthe hands of Serbian authorities as their security fuckup! But the thing \nthat shocked me most is the behavior of your people just after the game all \naround your  \"autochthonous\" regions... They were celebrating in the \nstreets like they actually won the game... Flags all around, people on the \nstreets shouting... I wonder who was the bigger \"hooligan\" that night - \nthose in the stadium in Serbia, or your entire nation... Which game did \nthey won?\n\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\"/ I couldn't care less for you, your \npeople or Serbia as a matter of fact but if you want to comment something \nthat was broadcasted live to so many people, I would consider getting your \nshit straight!",

Don't get all possessive, \nthey share similar cuisine because of that. They didn't really choose it. \nIt's their history influenced by the Ottoman Empire. I'm happy it happened, \nI'm half kosovan-Albanian and I love the food whenever I go there\nJust appreciate the good food, don't fight over it.\n\n\"Much of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from \na shared Ottoman cuisine, especially Turkish cuisine, and including Greek \ncuisine, Balkan cuisine, Armenian cuisine, and Middle Eastern cuisine\"",

As for Northern Europe, I hardly know that part of \nEurope but I'd love to visit Denmark, Sweden and Norway as well as Germany \n(even though I've been to Germany at least 3 times now)...",
