Queen Esther was married to Persian King, Xerxes (yes the same one in \n300, stupid Hollywood bullshit)\n3. Prophet Daniel, Prophet Haggai and Prophet Zechariah were all Persian \nJews.\nDid you know 20% of residents on Beverly Hills are Persian Jews? \nDid you know the top 10 Iranian billionaires are mainly Persian Jews?\nAround the world there are roughly 500 000 Persian Jews.\nThe most prominent female pop star in Israel is a Persian Jew.\nA former President of Israel was a Persian Jew.\nYet those sons of bitches clapped against Iran.\ufeff",
