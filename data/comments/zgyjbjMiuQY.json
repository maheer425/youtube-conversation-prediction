Graham is not a fighter, he is a survivalist and a \ntactician, not a seasoned warrior like Lanius. And while graham fought of \nsmall bands of tribal white legs with very little assistance, Lanius once \ntook on 15 legion centurions (basically caeser's version of the NCR ranger) \nPLUS every single warrior in his own tribe, including his chief, and, \naccording to graham, the hidebark chief never grew soft like the rest of \nhis tribe. And while graham was thrown into the grand canyon on fire and \nnearly died, Lanius was stabbed 22 times, suffered 4 concussions, was shot \n147 times and nearly decapitated twice, and he was fine. Finally while \ngraham may be a weapons expert on guns, but Lanius's armor and brute force \nwould just absorb it until graham ran out of ammo, they would be forced to \ngo into a melee battle at which point Lanius would kill graham because \nmelee and hand-to-hand is where Lanius is stronger.
