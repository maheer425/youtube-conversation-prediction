All that ails \nthe world is based in sin. With an attitude of love towards one another we \nwill counter contention and we can only truly do this in Jesus.\ufeff",

What a great actor!\nClearly, pleasure does not result in real happiness. \nLike a soother can satisfy an infant's hunger for only so long before \nanother distraction is needed, if the real source of the pain is not \nsatisfied, the \"real\" happiness can never be achieved.\nToo often, pleasure and instant-gratification are sold to us as the answer \nto happiness. It clearly is not. Even wealth, fame, power and many other \ndefinitions of success hardly satisfy our true nature for happiness.\n+Karen Schumacher said it first. Contentment is key. Focus on the good \nthings in life you already have and either ignore the rest or plan \npractical steps to move away from those negative things.\nPersonally, spirituality has brought me real happiness. Deny your own \nspiritual hunger and miss out on some really satisfying contentment in \nlife. \nIf you have ever had any interest in the bible, but felt it was too \ndifficult to read or understand, jw.org is a great learning resource for \none of the oldest collection of books ever written. Visit and you will \ndiscover that the bible is still incredibly practical.",

His style was thus \ncalled Paripatetic . And of course pedestrians are walkers.  But I wouldn't \nhave expected you to get the joke  because while you throw out the name \nAristotle, as if you know what you are talking about, you were probably \nlucky to spell the name correctly. And besides Aristotle also once said \"It \nis clear, then, that some men are by nature free, and others slaves, and \nthat for these latter slavery is both expedient and right.\"\n\nThis is among the many other stupid things a lazy non worker would say so \nthrowing his name out doesn't exactly give anything else you say much \ncredence. He is highly over rated as are many revered people  who did \nphilosophy in the vacuum of ignorance of their day.\n\nKind of like you.",
