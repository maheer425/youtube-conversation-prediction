Now as to why I don't like half life2? In short, it feels \nlike the bastard child of half life and generic. Apparently they spent so \nmuch time programming the physics they forgot about like half the guns of \nthe first game that encompass all of the fun ones. In its stead is the \ngravity gun which is fun in its own right but pales in comparison to the \ncreativity of the first half life's weapons. The AI half life is known for \nare now dumbed down to such an extreme level. Even the aliens which are \nmeant to be stupid have better ai than the security in half life 2. Even on \nhard they all clump up in large groups and go down the same path. Only \nreasonable explanation for this is that Valve was trying to make the \ngravity gun look more badass since its way less useful if enemies are \nanywhere other than straight ahead of you. Adding the driving filler \nsegments, overcomplicated story (can forgive a little bit because half life \n1 was pretty simple), and characters that are just there to suck Gordon's \ndick makes me want to play the original.
