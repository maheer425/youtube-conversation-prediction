                "text": "I went to high school in Matsuyama for a little while and on the very first \nday when I was sitting in my classroom, fifty or sixty kids from the other \nclasses came up to the hall windows and just sat there for a good ten or \nfifteen minutes tittering and pointing and gasping whenever I looked at \nthem. They were practically trampling each other to get a look at me, I \nfelt like an exotic zoo animal. I was also followed home by men in their \ncars who would shout stuff at me. Everywhere I went people would giggle and \ngasp and approach me to try speaking English, and I had people ask me to \nsing songs from the movie Frozen because I apparently look just like Elsa. \nOh well, I guess the tall foreigner with big blue eyes, dirty blonde hair \nand freckles will stick out like a sore thumb wherever I go in Asia.\ufeff",

                    "text": "Omg! This comment made me laughed so hard! But at the same time it made me \nfeel absolutely guilty. I used to be like those japanese people except I'm \nnot Japanese. I was born and raised in the Philippines, in a small town \nwhere everyone and I mean everyone is purely filipino. On top of that, it's \na really really small town or a village whatever you call it, where \neverybody knows everybody, so anyone who's foreign can literally be noticed \nfrom miles away. Lol! Anyway, I'm gonna try to explain why they act the way \nthey do based from my experience when I used to be like them. I hope you \nwon't get offended because I tell this to any of my white friends who's \nplanning to go to Asia to give them a heads up on what to expect and maybe \nsomehow understand the people's side. So back then, I used to think white \npeople aren't really people who feels and knows what \"filipinos\" feel. Like \nI view them as not human beings but more like those actors that I see on \nTV. Because physically you guys are different, so in my head before I \nthought, they're so different, they aren't capable of feeling emotions that \nI feel. I know it sounds ridiculous and even I think it's ridiculous now \nand I'm always so embarass to say this to anyone lol! So yeah, since they \ndon't view you as one of their kind, they think it's okay to do things on \nyou without your permission because in their minds, you won't be offended \nor you won't noticed, simple because they don't you can. Trust me, I \nlearned a lot about the white culture when I moved here in Canada. And the \nfirst thing I realized was that, we're all humans regarding the racial \ndifference and everyone feels the same. This is the time where it really \ngot to me and I felt extremely bad for the white people I harrassed back \nthen?? LOL! Sorry if this is too long. Hope I shed some light on you. :)",

Comparing US to UK television, you will get the impression that \nAmerican TV is happier, when actually the spectrum of emotions displayed \nare biased towards the positive, (Perhaps culturally, as Americans in \ngeneral don't like to show any flaws or have any errors, a lot they act \nlike nothing is wrong) in UK media, the range of emotions are mid-tone \nbiased, and then depending on the plot, the actor will display negative or \npositive ranges. \n\nHowever, it could be as simple as: America has a lot more sunshine than \nEngland - most scenes shot in England will have a grey overtone, because \nthe producers can't stop the English skies being overcast, and so they \nnaturally feel more depressing. A lot of American TV and films are produced \nin Hollywood/Calif areas, and so have much warmer, and saturated tones. \nThat has a lot of impact on the tone of a media. \n\nBut if you're saying \"England and Wales kind of hate each other\" then that \ncompletely explains why you don't understand British media - you simply \ndon't understand the English language - as in, the language of English \npeople.

The same way, a short girl may be mistaken for a \n12 year old - because people only notice the height, stop there and make a \nretarded assumption. I think it's kinda their problem, not yours.

The \nnight started fine, with me playing with the new puppies that they had. The \nrest of the family would either be coming over the next day or I would be \ngoing with them to the other home to meet that family.\n\nWell...plans were cancelled as they stopped to realize that the extended \nfamily...didn't take too kindly to us of the African-American persuasion, \nlol (I was living in Louisiana...one of the southernmost states in the \nU.S.). So, after already having spent quite some time on the road just to \nget there, I politely accepted the puppy that they had reserved for me and \nwhile my friend stayed behind to visit her family, the girl's mother took \nme back home. At that age, I was more concerned with ensuring the puppy in \nthe back of the truck didn't accidentally climb over the side (I would \nlater find her tucked into a spare wheel on the back of the truck, \ncompletely safe and quite adorable :)\n\nIn hindsight though...it's kinda hurtful.

The youngest age I was mistaken for was 9 or 10. O_O I kid you not. \nWhen I was 28 years old, I was working at a school as an art therapist and \na teacher yelled at me to go back to room 23, which was a fourth grade \nclass at that time. O_O Of course, she apologized once I told her I was \nworking there. LOL Even now in my 30s I get the unicorn stares, especially \nafter people know my age. My grandma and grand-aunt has this effect too. It \nis very common in my mother side of the family. I'm surprised University of \nMiami hasn't called me to conduct anti-aging experiments on me to find out \nwhat exactly causes the aging process to hinder/slow down so dramatically \nwithin me. I properly have the secret to stop the aging process, who knows. \nI can understand being 5, 8 or even 10 years younger, but over 18 and even \n20 years younger... that's ridiculous!",

My parents (when I was nearly 2 years old), went to Australia \nwith me on holiday and we stopped over in Thailand.

It went on for a few \nminutes and my dad gave me over to her to have a cuddle.\n\nShe then promptly runs off with me without any warning out of the room, \nleaving my dad chasing after her in alarm and when he catches up with her, \nshe has run to another group of people who are all touching and stroking my \nhair! All because it was curly and they hadn't seen something like that \nbefore.\ufeff",

                "text": "I lived in central China for 3 years. Most of the time I lived in a big \ncity, which was fine. I travelled to visit friend's family in incredibly \nrural areas, and that was fine. However, when I'd go to a place that was \nneither developed city nor a village, so a sort of big town area, people \nwould stare at me. Loads of people had the habit of saying \"laowai\" (like \n\"gaijin\") even when I had demonstrated that I understood, and could speak, \nChinese. One time I had just disembarked from a bus and there was only one \nman on the street. He passed me and said, \"laowai\". It was a swelteringly \nhot evening, I had just finished a long day at work with no \nair-conditioning, I had taken the wrong bus and was facing a 30-minute walk \nhome on a dusty road with no shade... so I snapped. I shouted at him in \nChinese: \"Yes! I know! I know I am a foreigner! Who are you talking to?!\". \nHis reaction? *sound of surprise* \"Ah, she speaks Chinese?\" ... =_= I just \nmade an exasperated sound, threw up my hands and then stomped away :P \nSoooo, yeah.

                    "text": "+Pan Zheng Thanks for the comment, and the clarification. I understand the \nmeaning of laowai. I know it does not carry the equivalent meaning of \ngaijin. However, because of a guy called \"Da Shan\" (a Canadian t.v. \npersonality who was really popular in China a few years ago) a lot of \npeople on the street said \"laowai\" in a sing song, high pitched way. \nApparently it's a reference to a skit where Da Shan said lao wai in the way \nthat mimics how Chinese people think English sounds. A lot of my Chinese \nfriends would get annoyed when people (almost always guys) would shout it \nat me like that in the street, so I know that it is mocking. That's how the \nguy in my first comment sounded. The majority of the time I ignored it, but \nlike I said, I'd had a rough day. I can of course differentiate that \nsituation from when someone says laowai to make an observation or to get my \nattention. In those circumstances I would say hello, or introduce myself \nand then chat for as long as time or my vocabulary allow. Many people I met \non a regular basis came to call me Danni \u4e39\u59ae, jie jie/mei mei (older/younger \nsister), or wai guo pengyou (foreign friend). One man even called me \n\"comrade\" haha!

I don't want you to feel pressured to answer \nthough. I don't expect it and I really won't be disappointed if you don't \nanswer or take it personally in any way...! But... aww! Thank you for \ntaking the time. \n\nActually many Thais are like the Japanese to an extent - maybe not that \nextreme though as to giving out compliments (though that's probably because \nit's me \u0669(\u25d5\u0e31 \u02d1 \u25d5\u0e31\u0e51). Most just curiously look. \n\nOnce I was in a clothing store with my German friend and the female sellers \nstarted talking about our feet. Nothing negative, only how they were \ndifferent from Thai feet. But I felt weird like I was listening in on a \nprivate conversation... so I quickly asked them something in Thai (I think \nit's may be different in Japan, but most people here think that foreigners \ncan't speak Thai and they are really surprised and amazed if you do). \n\nMen don't exactly cat call, but some try to get my attention, \nsaying/calling hello, which I usually ignore. Or just look. But it's rather \nuncomfortable if it's a group of motorcycle taxi drivers sitting at the \nside of the street. I don't feel threatened or anything, but I don't \nexactly feel confident either.\n\nI guess I just don't like much attention, being shy. But I still like cute \ndresses. (*T\u25bdT*) the dillemmas of Life.\n\nI get what you say about being under pressure seeming nice and polite! I \nfeel the pressure too.

I don't \never wear dresses or skirts in America anymore because I feel really \nuncomfortable by the stares there, and I'll get cat-called and whistled at. \nHere in Japan people are usually much politer about it, as in they stare, \nyes, but no one has ever made me feel uncomfortable here or cat-called me \nyet. They actually make you feel good about yourself because they say such \nnice things, like \"She's pretty!\" or \"She's so skinny!\" or things like \nthat. And it's not just men, but the women, too. So I actually feel \nencouraged to dress nicely here, whereas in America I feel kind of shamed \nor uncomfortable. :/ I think it really depends on the person, though, \nbecause I have friends here who have had bad experiences with guys being \ncreepy toward them, or even touching them. But I just haven't had any \nuncomfortable experiences here yet so I FEEL safe and confident. \n\nEven then, though, yeah sometimes I just don't want to be stared at. On \nthose days I'll try not to go out, or I'll tone down what I'm wearing or \neven put on a hat or something. Like you, I always feel more comfortable \nwhen I'm with Jun. But part of that is also because I put a lot of pressure \non myself to act \"correctly\" so that I don't give Japanese people a bad \nimage of foreigners, so when I'm by myself I'm always freaking out that I'm \ngoing to do something wrong and make people think, \"Ugh, foreigners are so \nrude\" or something. >_<",

When we got to the school though even \nI was midly uncomfortable, and I always have to deal with my friends \nsticking out for being loud and huge anime/marvel comic nerds everywhere. I \nlove anime, but I know the boundary between cartoon and reality. In anime \nyou always see the students gathering in large groups to see whatever \ncommotion has happened or the transfer student blah blah- but I didn`t \nthink they actually did that. Me and one other America stopped in the hall \nto visit several old friends, we chat for a bit and took pictures and in \nthose ten minutes the entire floor of the school had surrounded us giving \nthe unicorn stare. Like all exits were blocked. They dispersed finally when \nthe bell rang but then lunch came around, we would just be walking in the \nhall and students would run out of their classrooms, stop in the middle of \ntheir jog, stop in the middle of their lunch, and stare.\nHonestly I felt like the animal in the zoo. They`d whisper amongst \nthemselves because none of the other Americans knew much Japanese, but then \nI`d open my mouth and it was like they saw a zebra do a backflip. \"Omg shes \nspeaking Japanese\", my attempt to stop the unicorn effect backfired and \njust gathered more onlookers as they attacked me with questions-getting \nexcited every time I spoke. I was very excited when I first showed up and \neveryone was very friendly with me because I understood them, but I was \nquite bothered by the enormous crowds that formed just because we'd stopped \nto talk or get some juice.

She said that she thinks that people in generally are more polite to \npeople from other races here. (Or maybe, because in Bulgaria it's well \nknown that Japanese people are very polite, that's the biggest stereotype \nabout Japan after sushi and sumo ofc, Japan is one of the most respected \nforeign countries in general here and people probably want to present their \nbest to Japanese people, because when we see an Asian person here, we \nassume that it's a Japanese)\n\nAnd of course the usual portion of stares. My \"black friend\" told me that \nit took her some years to get used of it, but now she feels OK with it and \nkinda likes it. \n\nAnd thanks for the correction, I will remember that.

                    "text": "+moumann1\nOkay, I understand your point! I think the rate of Japanese people is a \nvery good reason. When I see someone in Japan, there is a 98.5% chance they \nare Japanese. Those are odds almost anyone would bet on. And they were \nstudents in rural Japan so chances of them not being Japanese are even \nlower. Even if these two girls specifically weren't Japanese, the point of \nthe video was the story so it doesn't make a big difference. People stare \nat me like that all the time in Japan, and many other people have written \ncomments here with similar stories in Japan, so I don't think anyone can \nargue this is unusual behavior for Japanese people.\n\nAdditionally, I have had other experiences with young girls in Japan where \nthey have pointed at me, laughed, and shouted \"GAIJIN!!\" Jun has told me a \nton of stories about young Japanese girls who have been rude, and I've been \nin plenty of situations where young girls in Japan have been shrieking in \npublic and causing a nuisance, so I don't think this story is out of the \nordinary.\n\nAmerica isn't a very good comparison because we have a very high mixture of \ncultures and races here. But even with that, I consider everyone I meet in \nAmerica to be American until they tell me otherwise. Even if they don't \nhave American citizenship, if you want to be American then typically we \nwill consider you American. Anyone can be American, regardless of their \nrace, nationality, the language they speak, etc.\n\nAnyway, Japanese people are still extremely polite and overall I've only \nhad very positive experiences in Japan. This was just an anecdote.",
