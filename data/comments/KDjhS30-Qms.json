You think that games that \ncater too much to newcomers and alienate existing fan bases are bad games. \nI can absolutely agree with that, being a victim of both mass effect 3 and \nace combat assault horizon (thankfully I avoided beyond earth).\n\nSo this is perhaps the fundamental difference between you and me: you're \nconcerned with the trajectory of the series (in terms of quality) and I can \nonly view the quality of the game relative to other stealth games I've \nplayed. My only thought when playing the game was \"well shit, this is \nbetter than ass-creed.\" While I hate arguing against my own position, I \nwill concede that your view may be more relevant. So...you win. Fuck it, \nI'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong.\n\nIn regards to Ubisoft, you could argue that they will actually lose money \nin the long-term because as COD:ghosts proved, even stupid people can tell \nwhen they're being served the same thing every year, and eventually it will \nbackfire.

It's \na shitty game and you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nMy first Ghost Recon game was Future Soldier. New people loved it, fans \nhated it. I liked it at first and thought it was better. I still do, BUT! I \nam not a longtime fan of the series. I really shouldn't be able to just \nbarge into the fanbase and say what goes. I eventually got bored because \nit's just not my type of game and I never touched it again leaving me(THE \nNEWBIE) and the fans alienated. NOBODY was happy. I then said, \"Huh, the \nfans hate this game a lot, and I can definitely see why. It doesn't even \nfeel like the same game anymore\" (THIS IS ME WITH SPLINTER CELL) The point \nis for devs to quit catering to the newbies who will never touch the game \nagain within two weeks and listen to what the loyal fans want.\nGhost Recon is not my type of game. I can say to Ubisoft, the new style is \nmuch better than the old one, but it's still not my type of game and I'll \nonly play it for two weeks and I'll never play it again. The fans will play \nit for a few minutes and never touch it again, leaving the whole game \ncommunity completely barren. See my point?\nEVERYONE loses except Ubisoft, because they already got their money. They \ndon't care about you.\n\nRegarding \"Butthurt\" I don't care as to what any of us are saying it means \nanymore as it really doesn't have anything to do with the topic of the \ndiscussion.",

I \ndon't hold it to the same standards I hold games geared towards hardcore \ngamers (I'd provide a list, but I imagine that you'd disagree with every \none I named just on principle. I don't know, Civ 5? Surely we can agree \nthat's a different caliber of game). \n\nFurther, I'm not a casual gamer. I like hardcore games that let you build \nyour own character, use intricate dialogue, contains complex moral choices, \nsome element of strategy or thought, interesting worlds and stories, etc. \nBUT (and this is the important part) I also enjoy games that I know going \nin have none of the aforementioned traits but are still a good bit of fun \nfor a few hours (games like splintercell, skyrim (sort of in-between), just \ncause 2, gta, BF3, and so on). Does that mean I'm ok with game developers \n annually shitting out continual mediocrity like COD, ass-creed, or those \nnfl games (can't be bothered to look up exact name), or zelda? No. But to \nbring this back to my original point, I have no idea if blacklist was just \na bad copy-and-paste of a previous entry because I haven't played any of \nthem. Who knows, maybe if I played all of the other ones I would agree with \nyou, but having no history with the series affects how I see it.\n\nLast, if I was the cargo-shorts wearing, IGN-loving, budweiser drinking, \nfrat-monkey I have to assume you think I am, why the fuck would I be able \nto write in full sentences or be subscribed to rageaholic? The fact that \nI'm here probably means that I have high standards for games. The \ndifference between you and me is that I'm more selective in applying those \nhigh standards.

They just wanted to make the \noriginal fans shut up about no more ghosting. If they really cared, they \nwould actually let you fucking ghost in it instead of having scripted \nevents to make ghosting completely pointless. EXAMPLE: Let's ghost past \nevery one single guard and then OH CUTSCENE! \"Wait... why is Fisher beating \nthis guy into a desk? Well why the fuck am I trying to sneak past \neverything if the game automatically makes Fisher make a loud ruckus and \nleave a body on the ground?\" The devs reply \"Oh well that's not in \ngameplay, so you're still ghosting\" Me: \"NO IT'S NOT. THE WHOLE POINT OF \nGHOSTING IS TO MAKE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE OF YOUR VERY EXISTENCE IN \nTHE AREA\" Dev replies \"...\" in other words \"Don't care enough to fix it\" \nThe developers did not put any effort into stealth. It's quite clear.\n4) Gun diversity really shouldn't even be a big deal since it was never \nasked for in the first place. 5'7, SC20K, and you're good to go.\n5)[Or 4 in your case] Health regeneration doesn't belong in any difficulty. \nThey need to bring back the med kits.\n\nYour postive) The only difference perfectionist has than all the other \ndifficulties is no mark and execute and Wallhack goggles. Nothing else. \nEasy as fuck.\n\nThat's quite a joke. The game hasn't accomplished fuck. The only thing \nthat's really worth mentioning to me is that they added a way to KO from a \nguardrail. I can't think of anything else this game added that's actually a \ngood thing. The only enjoyment I've gotten out of this is when I laugh \nabout what Ubisoft COULD'VE done with something but chose to do something \nstupid with.\n\nThe game's total garbage and is just another milked cow.

I actually like your style and reviews.\n\nI have to disagree with the OP that this is a terrible review, but I \ndefinitely disagree with you that the game is a step backwards. For all of \nit's faults (and there's a lot more than you mentioned, some far less \ntrivial), the core gameplay is still really fantastic. \n\nActual problems with the game that you didn't bring up:\n1) plateauing of difficulty. Perfectionist is an ass-pain for the intro \nlevel and the level after that. Then it's mildly challenging, then it's \ntrivial for the rest of the game. The dev's could have done a lot better \njob of keeping the challenge up to speed as the game progressed.\n2) ass-backwards controls. In a stealth game, movement is key (crazy, \nright?). It's incredibly frustrating when sam fisher, the best spy in the \nworld, decides to open a door instead of vaulting through a window. You \nhave to have incredible luck or incredible skill to get the right button at \nthe right time.\n3) the dev's clearly want you to ghost. I get that it's a spy game, but in \nnearly every level playing assault is as hard (if not harder) than playing \nas a ghost, at least on perfectionist.\n4) lack of gun diversity. Weapons go from bad to good. beginner pistol is \nshit, last pistol is great. No variety, just good to bad. Seems lazy.\n4) health regen in perfectionist. Would have been so much better if health \ndidn't regenerate. Then there would be an actual challenge.\n\n\npositives: on perfectionist, there is a sense of accomplishment, especially \non side missions. Some of them (due to bad design perhaps) are nigh \nimpossible to beat (charlie's 4E mission: Swiss embassy), and getting it \nright feels great. \n\nI really think despite it's flaws, the game accomplished what it sets out \nto do and provides the gamer with an enjoyable experience.",

From the let's play I'm watching, \nthis game gives quite a bit of choice, so that's nothing like Splinter \nCell: Conviction at all. And you can perfectly ghost many levels too.\n\nBesides, honestly the stealth in this game looks very solid, and the AI is \npretty good, especially for a stealth game. What did the older Splinter \nCell games have that this doesn't? Of course they should have employed \nMichael Ironside, and having some readables and engaging minigames for \nlockpicking and hacking wouldn't hurt, but besides that, the stealth seems \nto be improved a lot, albiet Sam Fisher is a bit too fast now. And I'm sure \nSplinter Cell always had some contextual controls, and the levels in that \nlet's play don't look too bad either, especially when you consider how the \noriginal Splinter Cell games were very linear and had the tendency to not \ncommunicate well to the player how to proceed ahead.\n\nPlease give some solid arguments Razorfist.\ufeff",
