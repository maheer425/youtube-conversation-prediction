Since most people on the \nright are not as materialistic/money obsessed as people on the left the \nlabel I prefer is voluntarist, or just plain anarchist if you like. The \nredundant phrase \"free market\" flows naturally from a free society for me. \nIf you leave people free they trade with each other, they don't enslave \nthemselves.\n\nSo yeah, you want to label me fine. We're all different, we all have our \nown views, what's wrong with labels?\n\nAnd for me private enterprise does not \"work\", it is good. It is moral. \nPeople on the left have managed to get people to follow them to this day \nwhile swimming in a sea of human blood, misery and poverty. How do they do \nit? By labeling themselves as the good side; or more often their opponents \nthe bad side. After all what good person wants to be on the bad side?\n\nAnd the most moral principle for me is the principle of non-aggression. \nGovernment breaks that principle and is therefore evil. People can trade \nwith each other without being aggressive. If you want me to concede that \nthe modern day corporation is little more than a bribe - you \"pay\" your \ncorporate tax and we'll often look the other way to what others wouldn't \nget away with, then fine. But once again I blame the game, not the players.",

Who \nlobbies massively to keep proposals from becoming law that would constrain \nthe laws of the big money?\nWho owns the media outlets?\n\nAnd well, concerning presidents...............remember Nuremberg?\nPut him on trial, and while we're at it do that to his predecessor too!\nThere is an international criminal court, who would give them a fair \nunbiased trial.\nIf we finally put government heads on trial for their misdeeds and crimes \nin office, including war crimes, we're a big step further.\n\nI think you misunderstood what I say about corporations using \nforce......what I said is not that they are constrained by it being illegal \nor moral constraints, but rather that they deem breaking that final \nbarrier, of challenging the state monopoly on force, to big a risk.\nWhat holds them back is not their morality or character, but rather the \nrisk involved.\n\nImagine it for a second, a corporation would choose to do violence to force \nit's claims, it would be declared an enemy of all nations, and it would \nvery easy to get the people in on that.\n\nThe only question would be who gets there first, the armies or the angry \nmob....in the latter case there will be a lot of dead people but the \ncompanie will be in shambles either way.\n\nOh and they would loose their convenient scapegoat for everything that goes \nwrong.....the state and the government.\n\nAnd just look at several big scandals in our present and past, quite a few \nof the big companies aren't afraid of doing something illegal if it \npromises profit.\nAs are some of the smaller companies, like when it came to the case of the \nBread in Victorian england, and how they dilluted flour with things like \nplaster.\nFor the more modern problems, take a look at Halliburton, Apple, Foxconn, \nTrafigura, Walmart, Monsanto, Chevron, two big scandals in germany, where \ncompanies sold meat past it's date of expiry or falsely labeling horse-meat \nas cattle, or lipobay, or Wells Fargo/JPMorgan Genuine Title, Dyncorp, etc. \npp.\n\nThere are people who will either bend the rules until they scream for \nmercy, or outright break them if it promises them profit.\nAnd of those we need to get rid off, as for governments, it needs to have \nas little power as necessary, and the main power should go to the people.\nWhich will be tough until we have educated the people enough, a goverment \nof the masses only works when the masses are informed without bias and are \neducated enough to understand the problems at hand.\nThe representative system right now doesn't work, as quite a few \npoliticians are actively working against the wishes of their voters.\nSwitzerland has shown that a partially direct democracy works, even though \nwe foreigners might not like all that they decide.....\nAnd more importantly it creates a culture of openess and honesty, most of \ntheir big projects for example are not plagued by constant cost overruns \nand allegations of corruption.",
