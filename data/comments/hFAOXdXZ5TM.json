Now instead of attempting to find \nphysical presence of a superior ask yourself the following questions..\n- Where did life come from? Did a lightning strike really just form random \ndead atoms into an incredibly complex body that bares life?\n- How did the first ever Hydrogen atom come to existence considering the \nlaw of conservation?\n- and lastly What Makes nature's laws? Who says there is gravity, \nmagnetism, calculated movement?",

However, just having a field does \nnot make a magnet a source of *perpetual* energy; it makes it more a source \nof *potential* energy, particularly when you have an ion or some other \ncharged particle inserted into the magnet's field. The fields of the \ncharged particle (and the particle being charged is very important) and the \nmagnet may interact to produce forces and subsequently energy, but the \nfields on their own really just sort of sit there if they have nothing to \nact on.\n\nI think a good analogy would be a gravitational field. On its own, a \ngravitational field doesn't really do anything. It sits there, but it \ndoesn't have an object to act upon. But if you put an object some distance \nfrom the center of this field, the object will be affected (in this case \nattracted!) and fall towards the center, producing kinetic energy. The \nmagnetic field, like a gravitational field, may affect an object placed \nsome distance from the center of its field. These fields are *potential* \nfields. Potential fields basically just create the opportunity for anything \nin them to change energy state. In the case of gravity, the field creates \npotential for anything that has mass. A magnetic field , however, creates a \npotential for particles or objects that have charge. With either of them, \nthe object placed in the field has the potential to change, and this is its *potential \nenergy*.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the really long explanation, but I hope this clears up \nany problems you were having. Have a nice day/evening/whatever! :)",

Consequently, \na gravitational lens has no single focal point, but a focal line instead. \nIf the (light) source, the massive lensing object, and the observer lie in \na straight line, the original light source will appear as a ring around the \nmassive lensing object. If there is any misalignment the observer will see \nan arc segment instead. >>*\n . . . \n*<< Gravitational lenses act equally on all kinds of electromagnetic \nradiation, not just visible light. Weak lensing effects are being studied \nfor the cosmic microwave background as well as galaxy surveys. Strong \nlenses have been observed in radio and x-ray regimes as well.

Then, according to \nEinstein's equation, each will cause a certain amount of curvature in \nspace-time. Further, according to Einstein's equation, each body will be \nforced to move in a certain way in response to the curvature caused by the \nother. The net result, then, is that each body influences the other. It is \njust this influence that we call gravitation. The idea is that the \ncurvature of the space-time geometry acts as a sort of intermediary between \ntwo bodies. It is essentially the gravitational field. >>*\n\n1.

We remarked in the Introduction that in a \nlocal inertial frame (a freely falling nonrotating reference system \noccupying a small region of space-time) the laws of physics are those of \nspecial relativity, an in particular free particles (those moving under \ngravity alone) follow straight-line paths with constant speed, so for these \nframes there is no acceleration and consequently no \"force.\" When \ndiscussing gravity in Newtonian terms, it is customary to insist that the \nframe used is nonrotating (so there are no centrifugal or Coriolis \n\"forces\"), but one does not normally use a frame that is freely falling, \nand it is this use of nonfreely falling frames that gives rise to \ngravitational forces. Just as the fictitious forces associated with \nrotation (the centrifugal and the Coriolis forces) can be transformed away \n(locally) by changing to a nonrotating frame, so can **the fictitious force \nof gravity** be transformed away by changing to a freely falling frame. >>*\n\n3.

The magnetic field \nthat is produced by the moving particles in a material and radiates out in \nevery direction doesn't share much in common with a photon at any \nfrequency. I don't believe microwave energy heats water due to a different \n\"mechanic\"  than other photons, it is just at a frequency that interacts \nvery strongly with water. ",

Microwaves can interact using a whole different \"mechanic\" that has \nto do with the arrangement of water molecules.\n\nA magnet on the other hand has to do with charges/moving charges. Your body \ndoesn't really have many of moving charges and generally it's charges are \nin equilibrium.\nWhich is why a magnetic field doesn't affect you in everyday life. However \nget a strong enough magnetic field and it starts to have an effect, search \n\"frog in a magnetic field\" and you can read articles/see videos on how \nputting a frog in a very strong magnetic field can make it levitate.",

You were friendly and \ndiscussing kindly, but now there's ignorance in your post all of the sudden.\n\nFirst, you said that *most* physicists don't know philosophy. Then you said *literally \nno one* knows physics and philosophy. Then you said *in general*, \nphysicists don't know philosophy. Now you are saying in capital letters: *NONE \nof them* explain physics and philosophy. Now you are also saying \n*university* physicists don't know philosophy. I can't keep up with this. I \ncan't tell which physicists you're talking about.\n\nSecond, when I said *\"And this does make sense because physics is the study \nof HOW the Universe works, and not the WHY,\"* this is not my 'thought' as \nyou said above. This is the definition of physics. Taken from dictionary.com: \nphysics: *\"the **science** that deals with matter, energy, motion, and \nforce.\"* So when you told me *\"If you think this is so\"*, I can't reply to \nthat because it's not an opinion. I'm talking about physics... not my own \ninterpretation of physics.\n\nThird, you then asked me why I was concerned with \"it just is\" being a lazy \ncop out. This doesn't have to do with my definition of physicists. I'm not \narguing that physicists are at fault. This is a misrepresentation of me \nagain. I'm saying the video is wrong with the statement \"it just is.\" \nWhether the people in the video were physicists or philosophers, the answer \nis still wrong. I didn't say 'physicists need to solve it!' I said the \nstatement is wrong and that is all I said.\n\nThen you said that the physicists I researched who were knowledgeable in \nphilosophy were only the greatest in their field who contributed greatly. \nChris... you don't know who I've researched and who I didn't research. You \nknow each physicists I've researched. So you can't say this my friend. You \ncan't tell me about the physicists I've researched and if they contributed \nin my field. I can tell you, however. But you can not tell me my physicists \nbecause you don't know who they are.\n\nAlso, even if this is true (that the physicists I've researched are only \nthe ones who contributed greatly and were the top physicists), then this \nshows that there do exists physicists that know philosophy, because you \nsaid earlier that *NONE* of the physicists explain the WHY (aka philosophy).\n\nAlso, many of your statements begin with the phrase: \"According to me.\" \nThis doesn't benefit me because, according to them, physicists don't need \nphilosophy (if your statement about them is true). If you have evidence, \nthen that should be posted here. Opinions have little-to-no argument value.\n\nWhether physicists should be required to take philosophy or not is a \ndifferent discussion.

And believe me, you will continue \nexperiencing it.\n\nAlso, I should not have stated \"literally\", but it is true that there are \nvery few people on this entire Earth who are actually trying to EXPLAIN the \nmechanisms of the universe. What the physicists do nowadays is description \n(primarily in the form of mathematics). Unfortunately, most of them do not \nunderstand the difference between a description and an explanation. Solving \nalgebra and calculus equations is fine and necessary but does not actually \nEXPLAIN the mechanisms. Mathematics merely restates observations in its own \nlanguage.\n\nI also agree that saying \"it just is\" is running away from the problem. I \nthought I made that clear in my previous post. However, it does seem as \nthough I looked too far into your post and assumed you were looking for the \nanswer -- you may or may not be, but I get your point now.",

By saying both can happen, \nsuch a person is now shutting off their logic and is now willing to accept \nanything ever. If we accept that something can be moving and not moving at \nthe same time, than what is stopping us from illogical claims, such as one \nclaiming they drew a 4-sided triangle? This is not logical and we reject \nsuch a claim.\n\nEven if this results in the multiverse mentioned above, there's still \nproblems here:\n\n2. Saying a multiverse is the solution is running away as this is never \nprovable. It's not the only solution to the problem in the video... so why \ndo we jump to that conclusion and not any other answer, such as saying \nthere was a reason for its existence? We should use common sense and say \nthat contradictions do not exist in the Universe, and such a case cannot \nexist. Something cannot be dead and alive at the same time. Saying a \nmultiverse is something not provable, so the one making the claim is not \ncertain of his answer and should be questioned as to why they chose that \nanswer over any other answer.\n\n3. Even if the solution is a multiverse, this still gives us more questions \nthan answers. Like, if a cat was alive and dead at the same time, and you \nsaw the dead cat in this Universe we are in right now, then this brings the \nquestion again... why do you see a dead cat in this Universe and not the \nlive one? In the current Universe, if you opened the box, you only see 1 \noutcome. Not both. Both outcomes cannot happen in 1 Universe. You will only \nsee one outcome.",

                    "text": "+Corey Carnes \"So which is a more accurate description of an atom. \"Frozen\" \nenergy or super energy saturated spacetime?\"\n\nWell. sort of both and sort of neither... (possibly). Let me take a few \nparagraphs to explain.\n\nMass is now defined as the \"rest\" energy of a particle (a particle in the \nsame inertial reference frame as us). So in a sense from someone on the \noutside of a particle the energy can be somewhat thought of as \"frozen.\" \nHowever, all particles have a ground state and all are therefore moving. \nALL particles are like kids with ADHD (can never sit still...) so being \n\"frozen\" doesn't make sense. Even if they're not moving from point A to B \nthey are still oscillating/randomly moving within a small distance. \nParticles tend to return to their ground state because excited states are \nunstable but it is never a \"frozen state\" as dictated by the uncertainty \nprinciple. Solids which appear to be frozen to macroscopic objects like us \nare actually teaming with a large number of particles all moving to and \nfro. Many particles actually receive much of their mass from the energy \ncontained within the kinetic energy of its constituent parts. A lot of mass \nis actually caused by \"unfrozen\" energy (kinetic energy) if you look close \nenough.\n\nHowever, there is something called the Higgs field that theoretically \nexists that's supposed to couple with matter to give it mass. There's an \nexperiment where they have used a Bose-Einstein condensate to slow light \ndown to almost zero speed within the condensate. The particles in the \ncondensate couple with (interact with) the photon slowing it down almost \nlike it's stuck in mud (but the real way it's doing it is much \ndifferent...). To fully explain the idea I would have to explain the idea \nbehind wavepackets, quantum tunneling, and refraction but that would take \nawhile (It's a quantum effect). LASERs, phased array radars (found on US \ndestroyers/cruisers), and LRADs (long range acoustic devices for crowd \ncontrol) use the wavepacket idea to turn a bunch of waves into beam that \npropagates like a particle/beam. In all three cases a bunch of waves almost \nnearly line up with very close frequencies/wavelengths to form a wave \npacket that disperses slower (AKA more particle like). The math is pretty \ncool and identical to that found in Quantum Mechanics. Whenever a whole \nbunch of waves that are almost identical almost perfectly line up they \ncreate a central blob that's particle like. On naval vessels 3,000 little \nradar antennas shoot off in each array (the arrays look like gray stop \nsigns on the ships) at slightly different times (if they were identical it \nwould be perfectly coherent) in a way to make one beam that points in one \ndirection out of the 3,000 waves (so you don't have to mechanically point \nthe radar). A LASER creates gazillions of photons that are almost perfectly \ncoherent (because Bosons tend to do that under stimulated emission) \ncreating a beam like effect. The condensate is a whole bunch of particles \nin basically the exact same quantum state so their interactions with the \nphoton creates a reverse EMF effect making an effect where the photon looks \nlike its moving really slow (the photon is still moving at C but the \ncoupling is causing a localized wavepacket carrying the net energy of the \nphoton. The slow moving photon then has a \"rest\" energy AKA a \"mass.\" The \nSchrodinger wave equation itself creates an infinite number of wavelets \n(spread out over say space and/or momentum for example) that creates a \nwavepacket for all solutions. Therefore this idea is pretty important.\n\nThe Higgs field is supposed to do something similar. This would mean that \nmatter is energy bogged down by the Higgs field. By the way scientists \nthink they have found the Higgs Boson that creates the Higgs field. The \nHiggs Field would interact with matter to create a wavepacket like effect \ncausing matter to be localized in one small area and giving it a \"mass.\" \n\n\"or super energy saturated spacetime\"\n\nTo tackle this one I will start with Quantum Field Theory. Quantum Field \nTheory sums up an infinite amount of wavelets with slightly different \nfrequencies. The problem with the theory is that the equations blow up to \ninfinite energy because the really really short wavelengths don't converge \n(that is the energy approaches infinity). To combat this QFT did something \ncalled \"renormalization.\" This basically means that the theory only works \nif at some really tiny distance (smallest wavelength) the equation crops \noff. This is one of the reasons for the development of sting theory. Many \nof our theories seem to suggest there exists some minimum distance \npossible. This \"smallest\" object wouldn't be a point then but rather a \n\"string,\" \"a loop,\" \"a surface,\" \"a membrane,\" or something like that. \nMatter may very well not be \"point\" like.\n\nNext there is the problem that gravity is always attractive so what stops \nindividual particles from collapsing under their own gravity? Well perhaps \nnothing does. Perhaps matter is made up of tiny black holes that are the \nsmallest bits that could possibly exist. Maybe particles are the stable \nground states allowed for black holes. Because quantum field theory \nsuggests that objects must not have zero size and they must have ground \nenergy the quantum effects of really really tiny black holes could possibly \nexplain the matter/particles we see. These super tiny black holes would be \nin eigenstates (stable states) so they wouldn't give off Hawking radiation. \nIf they exist in any unstable state they would quickly collapse. This \nbehavior is seen in elementary particles.\n\nParticles might be tiny black holes governed by quantum mechanical behavior.\n\nThe first part I wrote on wavepackets and the Higgs field is fairly well \nunderstood (the particle was found and there have been experiments showing \na similar effect happening).\n\nThe second part is unknown. No one really knows how much mass can fit in \none spot. No one knows what happens at the singularity of a blackhole (or \neven if a true singularity exists; there is no evidence that they do except \nin the math of a man made theory). No one has had any experiment probing \neven remotely close to the Plank length (and definitely not to zero \nlength). Some kind of quantum gravity is necessary to explain matter \nhowever.\n\nParticles may very well be tiny chunks of maximally curved space (most \ncurvature allowed) governed by the strange effects of quantum mechanics.
