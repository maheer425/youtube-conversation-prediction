Milk, and all other animal \nproducts, are for worst-case scenarios like a famine, but not for daily \nconsumption. Milk does not have any nutrients we can't find in plants, and \npersonally, I find it highly unnatural to drink the milk that was meant for \nanother baby (and the baby cows, if they don't get slaughtered, get what \nthen? some crappy substitute? GMO altered corn? yum..). Also, milk has tons \nof hormones, because it is meant to make a baby cow BIG and strong. Way \nbigger and stronger than humans could ever be. Lastly, milk makes the body \nacidic (which makes it easier for cancer to spread and is also bad for the \nheart) and is a combination of fat and sugar, which is bad for diabetics. \nOk, enough said... just my opinion :D\ufeff",

By \nthat i mean plants do not have advertisements and promotions, Aswell as the \nappealing nature Milk has to people. Back 10,000 years ago, starvation \nwasn't a rare thing. \n\nInfact you'd be lucky to not be starving without being the top of the food \nchain, this is apparent in poorer nations where they eat spiders as protein \nfor ageing teens, but then eat vegetables and Vegan food as a main dietary \nrequirement. Mostly these are Asian Oriented nations.\n\nHonestly i don't get why people care what others do. If i want to drink \nmilk from another animal, i should be allowed to do it without harassment \nfrom someone who has to be extremely sceptical. Just so you know, if people \nwere to base their dietary priorities to Crops and Such, the population of \nearth would have some serious epidemics, aside from the obvious issues with \nmass producing and farming crops (Toads, Seasons) we'd see for example a \nhuge de-crease in sport intensity, Look at what Usain bolt, Michael Phelps \nand Ian Thorpe eat.\n\nAnd aside from the fact that Seasons and Crop eating animals effect on the \nproduction, who would mass produce our \"Back-up\" resource of Animal food \nfor the world, considering everyone \"Should\" be vegans. There would be no \nmoney in those industries.\n\nHonestly nothing is as straight forward as it seems. You should let people \nchoose their own path in life. (I am biased because a hippie knocked me out \nwith a bat on a wharf for fishing, i nearly drowned) I have probably gotten \nsome things wrong, but not everyone has the patients to care what you or \nother Vegans have to say, especially when we only live for a short time.\n\nAlthough i do hate watching animals harmed.",

In \nfact I don't give half a shit about you, because I don't know you. For all \nI care, you can drink a liter of milk and jump off a cliff.\nBy the way, check your facts on lactose digestion by the adults digestive \nsystem, because roughly 80% of the adult world population loses the ability \nto *completely* digest lactose. This means that there are many people on \nthis world, who tolerate certain amounts of lactose in dairy products, \nthough whose organisms can't fully convert the lactose, so there is a \nreminder(!) of this undigested chemical, which probably poses a danger to \ntheir organisms. And the gas which some lactose intolerant friends have \nproduced totally proves, there is a threat to their health. You just don't \nsee/smell such a flagrant evidence by the majority of people, whose \ndigestive systems just partially tolerate it.\n\nDo not feel obliged to reply, because I don't really want to argue for the \nsake of argument(I strongly feel that is your only intention)!

You don't know.  Conflating correlation with causation is a \ncommon logical fallacy and is generally symptomatic of wishful thinking.  \nThere is absolutely no definitive evidence to demonstrate that milk \nconsumption shortens lifespan.  None.  It's one of the vegan/vegetarian \nfallacies, along with the idea that milk is terribly acidic, etc., etc.  \nHave the lifestyle that you want, but don't try to frighten others into it \nusing fearful lies.  That's contemptible, and it's one of the reasons that \nI detest fundamentalists of any stripe - religious, political, or dietary, \nbecause it's one of their primary approaches.  \"Milk shortens your \nlifespan\" is right up there with \"weapons of mass destruction\" or \"You are \nhell bound unless you believe as I do\" in terms of the Big Lie that so many \npeople use to push their viewpoints.  Just because you like the smell of \nyour bullshit doesn't mean it's not still bullshit.\n\nSome populations evolved the ability to digest lactose into adulthood, and \nnorthern Europe is far from the only example.  One of the traditional \nstaples of Maasai diet (southern Kenya) is a mix of blood and milk.  There \nare many other examples, and it is accurate to state that the ability to \ndigest lactose into adulthood is a part of normal human genetic variation - \nas natural as blonde hair, epicanthic folds in the eyelids, etc.  \nSuggesting otherwise is dishonest.
