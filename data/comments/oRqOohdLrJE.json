There are two theories, one \nthat they assume a source of light is the moon, and another that they \nassume a visible light source is likely to be in a wide open space. But \nnobody knows if either theory is true or if they are both wrong and the \nreal answer is something else.\ufeff",

If I thought it was \ndangerous, I might stay away.  If not, I'd go to investigate.  If I then \nfound a whole group of non-threatening people at the light as well, I'd \nhave reason to stay and come back again if I saw the same occurrence the \nnext night, or somewhere else.  \n\nSo my first question is what are the studies on how these insects interact \nwith each other.  Are they drawn to each other socially in other \nenvironments, or is it in their nature to avoid large gatherings of their \nspecies and similar species? \n\nAlso, how much do we know of their brain capacities?  I find the clinical \nnature of studies tends to inadvertently paint a picture of a biological \nmachine since it is only discussing functional how and why.  So I think its \neasy to forget that other life forms probably have psychological \nexperiences of the world too.  Is it possible for a moth to be curious? \nWhat kind of data is there on this?",

Throughout a day, sunflowers continue pointed towards the sun, \nthus positively phototaxic, also, most flowers opening in the sunlight are \npositively phototaxic.\nIf you live around redwoods in California, a plant called redwood sorrel \nlives there. These are used to living in the shade, but when they are \nexposed to sunlight their petals or leaves (not sure which) fold down, \nreducing the amount of surface area exposed to sunlight, to prevent over \nheating! Thus they are negatively phototaxic.\n\nPhototropism occurs when a plant is reaching towards light. The cells \nelongate on the dark side of the stalk, elongating that part, causing the \nstalk to bend towards the light!",
