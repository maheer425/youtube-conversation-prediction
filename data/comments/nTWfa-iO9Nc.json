The regulations clearly create \nthe drastic business cycles that we have. Go take a look at recessions \npre-1913. They happened occasionally and only lasted a year or so. Now we \njust print the money when we don't have it and the recession goes on for a \ndecade. Then on top of that, the government guarantees loans to banks and \nallows the banks to put young people in huge debt. But who is truly at \nfault here? Is it the banks for wanting to make more money without having \nto do anything illegal? Or is it the government for giving them the ability \nto do it illegitimately?\nGovernment is the issue here. We have too many regulations. The government \nis bought out by the corporations and the corporations are the ones writing \nthe laws. That's what people who scream for more regulations don't \nunderstand. Regulations are to shut down competition. Not to make the \neconomy prosper or to make it a level playing field. The government LOVES \nwhen the people cry or more regulations because they know that means more $ \nfor them from corporations.\nJust get the government out of the economy and let these corporations learn \nhow to run a real business instead of relying on the government to feed \nthem.\n\nWhy do you people try to sound so compassionate, but you want to use \ngovernment guns to stop people from acting peacefully?",

We're not perfect obviously but we aren't \nstupid either, and neither are you so stop being racist asshole.  \n\nBassically this American senator who wants to attempt to protect Americans \nfrom banks, politicians, and corporations, went to law school, told the \nadmissions board that even though she's white with blonde hair she's part \nnative and the school admissions board accepted it, but you won't why?\n\nShe claimed to be native and the school admissions board accepted it, so \nshe substantiated her claim enough to satisfy the school admissions board, \nergo if believe otherwise prove it but remember.  Just like your first and \nonly Black president with his birth certificate, she substantiated her \nclaim enough for the school admissions board and she'll be able to do the \nsame in a court of law, so be prepared to be embarrassed in court and sued \nfor slander.  That is if you aren't actually just a racist asshole douche \nbag as you claim not to be.\n\nAnother question, Ted Cruz is an asshole, a cheat, and liar, but you guys \nseem to like that in your politicians so that doesn't mean shite right.  \nBut if you doubt Warren's claim that she is native even though she's \nalready proven it for the school admissions board.  And you doubt Obama's \nclaim even though he's already proven it, Ted Cruz's mother was born in \nIreland, his father was born in Cuba and he was born in Canada, so why do \nyou hate Obama who's mother was American which mean's he's one no matter \nwhere he was born even though he was born in Hawaii, will you prove that \nyou're a racist and vote for a non-American because he's white?",

This is about American politics and the fact that \nyour political party is opposite of the American political party that this \nwoman this video is in isn't it, so that's why it's okay for you to be so \ndisgustingly racist right?\n\nFirst off I'm Canadian and just like the rest of the world I don't give a \nshit about American politics, all you do is play G.I. Joe, invade third \nworld countries and steal their resources just like Russia.  And just like \nRussian you both have horrible education systems, horrible health care \nsystems, your corporations, banks and politicians rob you blind and that's \nhow you like it.\n\nWe had hope for you guys when Obama came along but it turned out that he's \njust another war criminal committing crimes against humanity invading \ncountries and allowing your corporations and banks to rob you blind, poison \nyour land, water, food, and air just like Bush and every other American \npresident since Carter.\n\nUp here in Canada we have regulations so that our banks can't rob us \nblind.  You know like sane people who don't like getting robbed and \nespecially don't like paying their robbers even more money after they \nrobbed us, stole our homes and our jobs.  So we didn't get fucked up the \nass by our banks then turn around and say  'Thank you sir may I have \nanother.'  like you guys did.\n\nI would ask why you like being robbed but to tell you the truth I'm \nthinking about opening a bank in the States so that I can rob you blind as \nwell eh, I mean think about how great that would be. \n\nIf you win the lottery and deposit like 20 million into my bank then walk \naway signing a happy tune thinking about quitting your shitty job, I can \nlegally take all your money, gamble it, keep all the profits, and if I lose \nit all I can call your up and say,  'Hello Mr. American dumbass sucker you \nknow that 20 million you deposited, well I lost all of it and I don't have \nto give you one red penny back. ha, ha, ha...'   'Now, now don't get angry \nand do anything rash just because I lost all your money or I'll have the \ncops come to bust your head wide the fuck open, and unless you have good \nhealthcare at work I'll take your home to.  ha, ha, ha...'\n\nThat's funny as hell you guys are so pathetic it's hilarious, god I can't \nwait to open a bank in the states and rob you blind personally, and \nlegally.  ha, ha, ha, ha...\n\nNow back to why you're so racist and why you refuse to answer my question \nof whether you believe a blonde haired white girl or guy can be part native \nor part black.\n\nYou showed me this article where some American political party asshole \nrefuses to believe that a white girl with blonde hair can be part native.  \nHe stated:\n\n'In a new book released today, Massachusetts Democratic senator and \npotential presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite \nhistory regarding the controversy surrounding her \u201cNative American\u201d \nancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What\u2019s remarkable is \nthat, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to \nget away with it. In fact, it\u2019s virtually ignored that to this day Warren \nstill refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this \ncontroversy.'\n\nSo bassically she went to Law school told the admissions board that even \nthough she's white with blonde hairs she's part native and the school \nadmissions board accepted it, but this asshole won't and neither will you \nbecause she's white with blond hair is that about the gist of it?\n\nThe article continues:\n\n'To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her \nclaims of Native American heritage, which is true.'\n\nWhat does this racist American asshole mean when he stated the above?  She \nclaimed to be native and the school admissions board accepted it, so she \nsubstantiated her claim enough to satisfy the school admissions board.  \nErgo this racist American asshole is lying and committing slander, and if I \nwas her I would sue him for every single penny he's got for slander, and \nmake sure the world knew he was a racist American asshole just like you.",

They \ncould afford to buy a home, a car, take a vacation every year and save for \ntheir kids college and their daughter's wedding as well as retirement.\n\nBut how was it possible? Because of socialism. Yes that is factually \naccurate! That was a period with the largest amount of wealth distribution \nin our country's history. The rich were taxed up to 90%  and it was \nredistributed through the GI bill to pay for college and housing and job \ncreation.

American workers \ndidn't do so well in the 50's because there was some magic in the air, much \nless because of socialism. You are putting the cart before the horse. The \nreason they did so well was because so much of the manufacturing capacity \nof the West had been blown all to hell in this little skirmish called WWII. \nThe reason the U. S. was doing so well was because we had the only game in \ntown. Capital goes where it is treated best, and that was here. The only \nlarge, stable, functioning manufacturing base left was ours, so we could \nafford to pay our people most - there was no competition, and moving \noverseas at the time was foolish. And our relative economic strength \ndeclined, not because of the Koch brothers or the evils of capitalism, or \nbecause we dropped the tax rates from 90%, but because the rest of the \nworld developed quickly and was able to compete again. Tax revenues \nactually increased when the rates were dropped from 90%. And not because of \nsome trickle down foolishness, but because what rational person is going to \nincrease their workload to only get 10% of their pay? If you worked for a \nrate of $100/hour at a tax 35% rate, but when you hit 40 hours a week that \ntax rate went to 90%, would you work extra? For a take home of $10? Hell \nno! \nWhat did result from that wealthy time was corporate complacency, which has \nhurt us. The reason companies like Toyota and Honda were able to suddenly \ncompete with and at times surpass U. S. car companies was because many \ncompanies here never stopped to notice that the world had changed, and they \nweren't changing with it. Japanese companies developed many new operation \nand management ideas that allowed them to blow past us. Heard of \"just in \ntime\" manufacturing, or \"kiazen,\" or lean manufacturing? Japanese ideas \nafter WWII, much of it pioneered at Toyota.  \nFinally, did you know that we now manufacture more in the U. S. than we \never have before? Despite all the companies going overseas, all the \nsupposed tax breaks they get for going, despite the higher wages that our \nworkers demand, we make more stuff here than ever. Do you know why that \nhasn't translated into more jobs? Automation. Unless you plan on smashing \nup machines like some neo-Luddite, those jobs are just gone. Machines do \nthem better, cheaper, and faster. \nYou can't put that egg back together again. Unless you are expecting a \nlarge portion of the world's manufacturing capacity to be blown to bits, \nand yet again we come out unscathed, it's a pipe dream. The 50's and 60's \nare long gone, and dreamy socialism isn't going to bring it back. \nRead some history, take some business, tax, and econ classes. ",

WAY more money than all the \nsenators got combined. so when you have republicans and democrats voting \nthe same way, not because they both agree a bill is bad, but because \nthey're both getting paid by a bill's enemy, we've got serious problems. \nwhy do they agree the bill is bad? because they're getting paid by the same \npeople. campaign contributions are an insurance policy for elites. it costs \nthem small money, to save them big money in the long run. the kochs will \ngive $880 million to save $5 billion in the long run, and so will the \npeople donating to the democrat party. it's all the same. parties mean \nnothing, except on the small issues like religion, same-sex marriage, \nabortion, and gun rights. the leftists will raise taxes... but not on the \nelites! the republicans will lower taxes... but especially for the elites! \nthat's how it always goes. it's not because of their ideology. it's because \nthey are buddying around with the same people, but they have to pretend to \nbe different, otherwise the american public will realize that they're not \ngetting any choice in who to vote for. as long as they seem different in \nsmall ways, the average voter will assume that voting for one party is \ndifferent from voting for another party. that way, they feel like they have \na choice, and they don't revolt. but do they really have a choice? the only \nthing you can choose for is whether you want gay people to get married, or \nguns to not be confiscated. vote red, and you can have your guns. vote \nblue, and gay people can get married. it's really the only difference. your \nwallet is gonna be in the same condition either way: empty. personally i'm \nnot gay, and i think marriage is a really stupid decision for anyone, so \ni'd rather vote republican. i think they're catering to a bunch of \nreligious fucktards, but who cares? they're not going to sell out my guns \nto the elites, so that we couldn't even start a revolution if we wanted to. \nand i can't see why anyone would want to get married when divorce is at \n60%, and will cost you your house, car, and money... including gay \npeople... so i don't see why it matters to me. i don't feel bad denying \nmarriage to other people, even though i feel that they should have equal \nrights. it's like giving gay people the \"right\" to be robbed blind by a \nbunch of criminals. yes they should have the \"right\" to be fucked over, but \nwho cares? i don't even want the right to get married myself! i'd much \nrather gay people have the right to own a gun than have the right to get \nmarried, since getting married *sucks*, and owning a gun will save your \nfucking life and possibly this country.\n\nkeep it in mind for 2016...",

Since they were rated AAA by reputable agencies the \nunsuspecting investors were blissfully unaware that they'd purchased junk. \nTHEN, when the home owners were close to defaulting on their mortgages and \napproached their banks and lending institutions to renegotiate the terms of \nthe mortgage, the mortgages were MIA. Lost in some giant investment \nportfolio. AND, since they were insured by the government, there was no \nimpetus for the lender to refinance because if the home owner defaulted, \nTHEY GOT PAID from the insurance. The predatory real estate agents got \npaid. The predatory lender got paid (for negotiating the mortgage and then \npaid in full when the buyer defaulted).

In \nCanada we had some sub-prime mortgage products but for the most part they \nwere heavily regulated. In the States that wasn't the case. There were many \ndocumented cases in America where predatory agents and lenders would \nknowingly defraud people, making them believe they could qualify for \nmortgages that they should not have been approved for. Oftentimes they were \nimmigrants who weren't very comfortable with English and couldn't \nunderstand the paperwork. Have you ever seen and agreement of purchase and \nsale for a home? They're wordy and full of legalese that, if not familiar \nwith them, can be very difficult to understand. What the predatory lenders \ndid is set the interest rate artificially low, making the initial first few \nmonths of payments affordable, but buried in the document was a \"balloon \nrate.\" After a few months the interest rate would \"balloon\" up to the \nactual rate, which would mean that the home buyer now couldn't afford \nhis/her mortgage payments. Thus, they would go into default. These \nmortgages were insured by the government so it was a WIN WIN for everyone \nexcept the person who bought the home.",

                    "text": "+Chris Stonehouse That closing remark is emblematic of the problem I've \nbeen trying to address. Indeed, it's quite telling that people who \nessentially make a case against discrimination and for more equality are \ncategorically being pushed on the defensive whenever this issue is \ndiscussed.\n\nPeople with blond hair & blue eyes are put up by far-right, racist and \nxenophobic political movements as an \"ideal\", a mentality which traces back \ndirectly to the very real Nazi concept of the \"Aryan master race\"). To this \nday, the Western media continues to play into such notions by putting \npeople of those appearances on a pedestal -- at the direct expense of \ncolored & minority people, who are systematically marginalized. Black \npeople in America refer to this phenomonen as \"the black tax\", but I'll \nhazard a guess you are not familiar with the term. Suffice it to say that \nthis mentality in the Western media and its politics amounts to \ndiscrimination based on ethnicity, outright.\n\nThe reason why this is relevant here is because we find ourselves looking \nat two ostensibly progressive presidential candidates for the American \npresidency of 2016, who not only in no way challenge that paradigm being \npromoted by the right-wing, but who in fact re-affirm it. Are you genuinely \nsurprised, then, that in response to this actual progressives will start to \nmake mention of the credibility issues that are at play here?\n\nThis would be a non-issue if American politics acurately reflected the \ndemographic diversity of the electorate. Instead, in the year 2015, white \napparently is still right. If you see no social issues or a contradiction \nthere, then I have no words for you. And more importantly, America's left \nmore than likely has a very bleak future to look forward to. The country's \nmost recent mid-term elections certainly already point in that direction.",

There's a lot of hope in progressive America over \nWarren. \n\nBut yes, I totally get it. Americans see Warren politely asking govt \nwatchdogs officials basic questions about why they let off proven \nbillionaire crooks without even a slap on the wrist - heads explode. \n\nThe other thing about Warren, as she says herself, is that she's a natural \nconservative. She only stopped being a conservative when she found that \nnone of those conservatives walked the walk. They were all in the hands of \ntheir billionaire bosses. As a principled person, she was then forced to \nswitch sides.So it is ironic that most of America see her as a radical \nleftie. \n\nImagine what would happen if there was such a thing as a real leftwing \npolitician in the US, like George Galloway. What happens in the US whenever \nyou get even marginally leftwing politicians is that the billionaire elites \ndestroy their careers. Howard Dean and Elliot Spitzer are good examples of \nthis. \n\nSo yeah, that's why you don't have a leftwing in the US. A few \nintellectuals like Chomsky, a few comedians like Stewart and Oliver.

Until that happens, NOTHING will \nchange.  Once they get there and see the amount of power they get, then \nthey don't want to leave.  So what they begin doing is in their own \ninterests and not ours.  We as voters can actually do the term limit thing \nourselves.  All we have to do is decide NOT to vote for them any longer \nafter a second term in office and vote a challenger into office.  This \nwould stop their bullshit antics and actually start making them do what \nthey are sent there to do.  I would love to see a movement begin of a vast \nnumber of voters pledging to not vote for the same candidate more than \ntwice.
