One late night, he was returning home \nafter a party. Just as he was 200 yards he heard a voice. It was a whisper. \n\"......EEn taaa...eeen taaah..nheeeyyt......es..poha..\". He quickened his \npace. He started to sweat. He was now about 10 meters away from his house \nwhen suddenly he saw a shadow in the corner of his eye. He didn't dare turn \nhis gaze towards it. He bolted to his door, and opened it with his sweaty \npalms and got into the house and locked the door. His parents were shocked \nat his appearance, he looked as though he had just seen a ghost. He avoided \nhis parents' startled stare and made his way up to his room. He had to get \nthat incident off his mind. He booted up his PC. To his shock, it booted \nout of hibernation. He remembered shutting it down that morning and not \nhibernating it.\nHe palms were sweaty, his knees weak, He looked down at himself, there was \nvomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. \n No one in his family knew how to operate a computer. It booted up. His \ndesktop appeared. What he saw could not be described enough with words. \nThe Internet Explorer window was open and loading.\n\nLegend has it that it's still open and dialing up to the internet.\ufeff",

It's not a normal haunting, as if you keep the front door closed the \nnext night she's stuck outside again. Also, I heard it was Japanese, not \nScottish but whatever lol",

                    "text": "+slipely That's called \"free will\" and it was satan who deceived Adam and \nEve to take chunk out of the forbidden fruit of knowledge. You need to \nrealize something. You can't blame God for the unfortunates of people. When \nit's time for them to be in heaven with their ancestors then let it be. The \nonly thing you can do is pray, have faith, and to focus on your life and \nthe people who need your help by spreading his word. It's not Gods fault \nthat animals kill each other nor is it his fault that we kill each other as \nwell. It's like saying this. \"To ask why we fight and kill is to ask why \nleaves fall. It is in their nature\". We are no different than animals and \nanimals are no different than us. It's just the will and the destiny of one \nbeings life. I could be murdered tomorrow without even knowing of it or you \ncould die of cancer and having only two weeks to live. God made humanity \nlike this for us to realize that there are cruel and greedy people in this \nworld. He expects his disciples to follow his commands and his word in \norder to survive and to be saved. Life is great and it is also terrible. \nWhen we fall in to hard times all we can do is do our best to make it \nbetter. But you must realize that having hard times and great times is just \npart of life. It's how the whole cycle works. Life comes to death \neventually, all you can do is smile back at it. When you trust in God you \nwill fear no death nor will you fear mere mortals like us, for only God can \njudge you. Not them. So there is no point of having the slightest fear of a \nmere mortal except to have the fear in Gods righteous name. Again. Life \neventually comes to death and all you can really do is except it and move \non from there. If you are righteous and you are worthy you will be welcomed \nto his kingdom which is filled with nothing but happiness and joy. Or you \ncould be a foul pagan like lots and be thrown into the debts of hell. It's \nreally your choice. No one said it was easy nor did Jesus and that's really \nthe only way on proving yourself. The thing is is that he will forgive you \nfor your sins. But the only way for him to forgive you is to love him and \nhis word and you must forgive others. Otherwise what is the point of him to \nforgive you if you won't forgive someone else for the sins they did to you. \nWhy would he bring in such hatred and foul pain to his realm? I sure \nwouldn't.",
