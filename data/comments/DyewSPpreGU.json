I won't say that intelligence and theism are mutually exclusive.  \nThat has nothing to do with the kind of people who believe the likes of \nKent Hovind, Ken Ham, Ray Comfort, etc.. Those people are mostly average or \nbelow average in intelligence, but mainly they're woefully uneducated and, \nmore importantly, so invested in their puerile beliefs that anyone who \nreinforces them, no matter how much the clown, is instantly granted \nauthority and credibility. \n\nA reasonably intelligent theist will find more seemingly, plausible ways to \nreconcile his faith with reality.  It's apparently not difficult and \nmillions of people do it.  A complete moron will cling to a literal \ntranslation of the Bible and indulge in a hyper state of confirmation bias, \nabsorbing anything he can find to assure him that his myths aren't as \nridiculous as they sound.  The stupid thing is not indulging in \nconfirmation bias.  To them, that's spiritual self-defense, so it's \nperfectly reasonable.  The stupid thing is that they've conflated their \nsalvation and the literal accuracy of what would be considered a very \nshabby document by the standards of serious historians. They've painted \nthemselves into a corner. ",

In fact, \nthe highest IQ score ever recorded belonged to a Theist, Darwin was an \nAgnostic Theologian who never studied biology, and the top 10 chemists in a \nconference admitted they were Theists.
