The fan being attached to the end of the crank, \nlike a Type II Volks, kept the cooling constant without belt problems and \nthe engine mounted between the front suspension onto a regular inline \ntransmission, with drive to the rear.\n\nAfter the rebuild, it was still underpowered by our standards, but still a \nvery interesting view of what had helped build the Toyota brand in Japan.

The honda has much less torque down low until \nyou wind it up just like a period 4 cyl Honda MC. It sounds great too! The \ntorque curve on the boxer Toyota is much flatter with good HP over a wider \nrange. It sounds growly like a BMW MC. The Toyota won the first ever 24 \nhour Fuji endurance race and many more after that besting the Hondas whose \naerodynamic design could not reach the top speed or get the fuel mileage at \nclose to 100mph as needed. Weighed less too. Both great period cars. I will \ntell you that the Toyota engine is much much simpler and easier to keep \nrunning right and to rebuild it. It was a lesson in a flat engine sitting \nlow under a low hood making it slippery in the wind. Scott",

Like the rear wheel drive Mark X which is a BMW 3 series \nbeater. Not the mention the Toyota Crown when is like the most luxurious \ncar I`ve ever sat in. The amount of tech in there is just amazing. Even in \nthe old days when they made a sedan called an Aristo. Which is the Lexus GS \nin the US but in Japan it came with a Supra twin turbo 2JZ engine. The \njapanese Legends like the Mark 2, chaser jxz series and the Ae86 were \nfantastic cars. I currently drives a JDM Toyota Celsior which is called the \nLexus LS400 here. On the outside they both look pretty much the same but \nunderneath and the suspension set up is completely different from the USDM \nLexus, plus it`s got the 1UZ FE V8 engine which is pretty much the best V8 \nof all time. (I`ll take no arguments) The only problem is that they were \nonly sold in japan and not a lot of people in north america knows about \nthem. Here we only get shitty camrys and corollas that were designed for \nthe North American Market. I guess the japanese just don`t think that the \nrest of the world deserves their best products.   \ufeff",
