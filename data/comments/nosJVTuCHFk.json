But you \nare wrong about Paris. Many Latin American cities, while being built, where \nin many ways modeled after European ones because of the enormous European \ninfluence among the ruling elite, and French influence was huge among them \nduring the XIX century. Also, Rio and Manaus are terrible examples, and, \nbecause of geographical and climatic reasons, not very representative of \nLatin American cities at all. Latin America isn't reduced to tropical \nclimates, it is extremely diverse. Think Santiago, Montevideo or Lima, and \ncompare them to cities like Madrid, Lisboa, Paris and many more. There are \nalso cities, such as Blumenau in Brazil or Frutillar in Chile that look \nextremely German, apart from other countless examples. But, still, this is \na terrible argument: if I was standing in the middle of Prague I could \nnever imagine myself to be in New York, as you implied, because both cities \nare extremely different. Cuzco, for example, would be more appropriate, \nbecause of all the buildings the Spanish built, in the same Baroque style \nthat is so prevalent in Prague.\n\nAlso, no, they aren't very different culturally, and that is even without \nglobalization mixing everything up. They are predominantly European, just \nas much as the USA or Canada are, and have been that way since the Spanish \n(and Portuguese) conquered the continent and imposed their culture. Yes, \nnative elements are stronger in Latin America, because the Spanish, in \ngeneral, didn't choose to murder the natives in the way the English and the \nAmericans after them did, but these native influences aren't very \nprevalent, especially in comparison to the European heritage and influence \nin Latin American culture and society. The heritage from Ancient Green and \nRome, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the influence of the Catholic \nChurch, the massive use of romance languages... Latin America is, \ndefinitely, Western.",

This could have been done by other rival \ncivilizations: why not the Indians, why not the Moslems or the Chinese, who \ninvented gunpowder? This is because they remained stagnant, whereas the \nnever-ending wars of Europe put pressure into innovation.\n\nYou say that Native Americans had inferior immune systems? This is true. \nThen again, they were intrinsically inferior in this regard compared to \nliterally everyone else be it Asian or African or European as there was \nvery little disease in their lands, and even before Europeans had come, \nthey were dying in great numbers by the pox.\n\nAnd was it also luck that Europeans came to be there? Just pure luck?

The Germanic (Folkright Law, Witenagemot, \nIcelandic \u00feing etc.)  and Celtic legal system (Brehon etc) placed all \npeople of a state, including the ruler, under the same legal rules and \nregulations. The average person could take the king to court and had land \nrights. This formed the basis of the English kingship and made many of \nthese systems distinct from other systems of kingly authority. These \nsystems were eventually replaced with the Christian system.

Why have you \nguys failed to do in centuries what Japan managed to do in years? \nThat is to build a liberal democracy mostly free of corruption where the \nrule of law is respected and hard work is always rewarded. Why can't you \nguys do this? I'm not mocking you...I want to know what you think that can \nbe done to turn around some of the appalling statistics that mire Latin \nAmerican countries, and have done so for pretty much the entire time since \nEuropeans colonised it.\"\n\n\n\nYou don't know enough about Latin America to affirm that we don't have \n\"many of the institutions or values of the west\"\nThat you would compare us to such a radically different society as Japan \nis, to say the least, crazy.\n\n\"build a liberal democracy mostly free of corruption where the rule of law \nis respected and hard work is always rewarded\" \n\nThat blanket statement doesn't apply to any \"western\" country, lets take \nthe flagship of the \"west\", the US for instance, where there is so much \nrepression and racism against minorities (like the african-americans) both \nhistorically with actually slavery or draconian laws against blacks or the \nmassive imprisonment.\n\nThen you have a puppet president who only serves the rich and the powerful, \n2 parties who are actually the same and more and more liberties and rights \nbeing taken away from the people with the blessing of the people.\n\n\nYou are turning a blind eye to facts, Latin American countries have always \nbeen rich and prosperous countries, if you were part of the Criollo class, \nless so if you were indigenous or mixed, exactly the same as in the US, NZ, \nCanada or Australia.\n\nPoint being that the indigenous and mixed people were the majority of the \npopulation in LATAM, and denied education or wealth creation with a Criollo \n\"white\" class trying its best to keep them down, poor and uneducated so \nthey are cheap labor for them, in Peru things started to change 40 years \nago, but only picked up real strength about 20 years ago and our economy \nand democracy is growing non-stop since that time.\n\n\nIt is only on the second half of the XXth century that massive population \nexplosion (for instance, Peru went from 5 million in 1940 to 31 million \ntoday) and the integration of the native american and former african slaves \ninto mainstream society that the stereotype of what \"Latin America\" is has \nbeen seared into your mind, and that is the stereotype that is peddled in \nAnglo news agencies and by Hollywood which is far from reality.\n \n\nNow, my final point is that you equate the \"west\" to the anglosphere and \nthat is a very limited viewpoint specially since it tries to deny the \nmassive contributions from the other actors:\n\nIt was the Greeks who invented Democracy and western Philosophy, the \nItalians who perfected the scientific method (with massive input from Arab \nand Indian math plus byzantine scholars), the French who invented human \nrights and then the British contributed with the Industrial Revolution.\n\nI would personally say that Latin America's unique contribution to the mix \nis Multiculturalism, we are a successful example that the globalization of \npeoples and cultures can work and are a sneak peek of how the society of \nthe Earth will look like once globalization worldwide reaches Latin \nAmerican levels of integration.

He frames his entire revision around this. \n\nIf you want an example, simply look at his explanation of the american \nrevolution, or at the other end of the time line at his explanation  the \n9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent war on terror.\n\nIn the former he simply says the sole motive behind the american revolution \nwas some nefarious plot by the colonial elite to distract everyone from \ntheir problems. I can not accept such a simplistic explanation for the \nrevolution, because history is rarely that simple, and any explanation that \nclaims otherwise should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe founders did not and never had one mind about how the country should be \nstructured and this is shown by how much debate took place before & after \nthe revolution, especially leading up to the ratification of the \nconstitution following the failure of the articles of confederation.\n\nThe idea that the main motive was the distract the masses via war with a \nsuperpower is just silly to me. \n\nIn the latter he completely ignores religious influences on the motives of \nthe terrorists(al qaeda's ideology and goals, that of global caliphate and \nthe spread of Sharia law, is explicitly religious in nature), and \nessentially says it is due solely because of western influence in Saudi \nArabia(which would only offend because of the presence of Mecca and Medina) \nor sanctions against the secular regime of Saddam(which doesn't really make \nsense, Saddam wasn't really a friend of Al Qaeda) and the on going Israeli/ \nPalestine conflict, or at least the US support for Israel(which itself an \nincredibly complex issue which he assumes one side on) are the reasons that \nIslamic terrorism exists. \n\nIt ignores the fact that many other regions and peoples that suffered even \nmore under imperialism have not formed global terrorist organizations, and \nthe fact that western values(like freedom of religion and liberation of \nfemales) are the most cited problem that organizations like Al Qaeda, or \nBoko Harram or [insert jihadist group here] have with the west.\n\nPlus it also fails to explain why western peoples are willing to be \nradicalized(as shown the recent ISIS issue). Why those born and raised in \nwestern prosperity are willing to flock and die for some theocratic army.\n\nHis best moments are when he covers both the Vietnam war and the occupation \nof the Philippines by the US(the latter deserves more coverage), but his \nattempts to explain the entire history of the US as that of simple class \nconflict just doesn't work as the blanket answer he seems to want it to be.

So I wouldn't say it's worsened \nhere at all, however maybe on the mainland like Greece or Croatia it has. \nThough I hear Germany's gun regulations are tighter than Britain's.",

You cannot shift the burden of proof onto me in this case,as you \nhaven't proved your point. You pretended to accept that you made a logical \nfallacy, then shifted the burden of proof to me, or at least tried to shift \nit. That's another logical fallacy.\n\nIt is certainly not \"always disproven.\" If criminals wanted to get their \nhands on firearms in any of those countries, they would. So, why don't they \nwant to? Because of cultural differences and, perhaps even more \nimportantly, because of greater racial homogeneity.\n\nThis last point is a very sensitive one, I know, but hear me out. While no \nrace of people is intrinsically more prone to violence, centuries of \ndiscrimination started by Europeans in America have led to minorities being \nleft in inner-cities. Not just poor, but isolated and distrustful of \nauthority, these groups are often cut off from what might be called \nmainstream American society, effectively living in their own \"ganglands\" in \nbad neighborhoods, enforcing their rule with guns, fighting each other with \nguns, and generally using violence as a way of life. It is in these \ninner-cities that most gun violence occurs. In short, is a problem of urban \ndecay, not the second amendment.\n\nEurope is headed down this path as well, given their treatment of minority \nimmigrants. They are still far from the worst US inner-cities, but they are \nrapidly getting there.",

If you know why that is \nplease tell me.\n\nWell as I pretty much implied above, there was no second amendment \nequivalent in the UK, Australia or Germany and they all have a gun death \nper 100,000 of 1 person or less. In comparison the US has gun death per \n100,000 of 10.3. I would say that's a pretty convincing argument that the \nsecond amendment doesn't help to quell gun crime. And whilst the casual \nchain may not be clear I've no idea what else might lead us to the cause of \nsuch high gun death, other than the policies on said guns\n\nOn your last point, that is something I always hear when debating this \ntopic but it is always disproven.

                "text": "Not to mention, John Green doesn't mention WHY the West rose, only that it \ndid... somehow. I'll explain what Green failed to:\n\n1. Starting in the Middle Ages (about the year 1000), Western Europe began \nto stabilize, forming increasingly ordered societies. Although Viking \nattacks were still a problem in the north, they were really just a nuisance \nto most societies at this point. The Magyars and Muslims had been defeated \nat Lechfeld and Ostia, and Christian missionaries had converted the Poles \nand would soon convert the Scandinavians. Much of this order and relative \npolitical stability was accomplished through use of castles, knights, and \nthe feudal system. This wouldn't last as long as some people thought, but \nit had its purpose.\n\n2. Once order was restored, long-distance trade was safer. With the rise of \na single super-national cultural regime (Catholicism), norms between \nnations were established, and trade between and within said nations rose \ngreatly. This rise in trade led to the growth of towns, and with them, a \nrise in the money economy. This, in turn, gave more power to monarchs who \ncould more easily tap into trade-based taxes than nobles who derived most \nof their income from feudal dues from farmers on their estates.\n\n3. Although it served to help stabilize Europe, the feudal system would \nironically be undone by the very stability it helped to create. With the \nrise of money economies, nobles became slowly but increasingly defunct as a \nclass. The new wealth increasingly belonged to a new class of merchants and \nbankers as the Middle Ages came to an end and the Renaissance began.\n\n4. Several contributing factors gave this positive change a huge push \nforward. First was the black death. While devastating, it led to a labor \nshortage which had the effect of increasing the wages paid to the laborers. \nCatholic Europe's social system gave enough power to the workers that they \nwere able to take advantage of their situation, and were empowered enough \nto inherit wealth from their relatives who died from the plague. This was \nnot the case in most places outside of Europe, where similar (or more!) \ndeaths from the bubonic plague did not lead to a windfall for the peasantry.\n\n5. Another factor was the rise of gunpowder weapons which helped make \nknights and castles obsolete, thus weakening the nobles who depended on the \nstrength of their castles and loyalty of their knights. The expense of \nmaintaining a gunpowder-equipped army meant that only kings and the very \nrichest of nobles could afford one. It helped that unlike China, Europe \nactually had real guns. The Chinese invention of gunpowder is no more \nsimilar to guns than gasoline is to inventing a car. A hand cannon \n(impractical and hard to aim) is not the same as a gun (super useful, easy \nto aim, deadly if it hits, despite a long reloading time), after all.\n\n6. But perhaps the largest long-term factor in the rise of the West was the \nestablishment of the University system. Much as the rise of philosophy and \nacademies fueled the rise of the Classical world, so did the Western, \nCatholic, European, Italian invention of the University. Before you say \nanything, no, Classical, Byzantine and Islamic schools don't count as \nuniversities. A university is a specific kind of degree-granting \ninstitution which teaches a wide variety of subjects and possesses academic \nand intellectual indpendence. Only an institution with ALL of these factors \nis a university, and the very first one started in Bologna in the year 1088 \nAD. And that's AD, not CE.\n\n7. With a larger economy, freer intellectual climate, and with increasingly \ncentralized states, the West had caught up with the rest of the world \nabsolutely no later than the 1200s AD, and pulled ahead in the next century \nor so. While it is true that a few individual states (like the Mongol \nprotection racket that was called an empire) were larger than any one \nWestern state, the West as a whole was still richer and more powerful than \nany other culture.\n\n8. This would be made clear for all to see in 1492, when the Moors were \nbeaten and Columbus went off to the Americas. A few decades later, the \nlargest empire in the world was Spain's, the first time a Western state had \nbeen the largest by land area in 1000 years or more. Other empires followed \nsuit, such as Portugal, the Netherlands, France, and of course, Britain. \nRussia, while Western in my book, took a different course, building a \nlarge, Orthodox, land-based state which conquered Central and Northern \nAsia, leaving the rest to Western Europe.\n\n9. A few major turning points (in no order of importance or dates) are:\n\n- *Battle of Lepanto*: The Ottomans lost to a massive Christian fleet, \ncoming not too long after an earlier defeat at Malta. While the Ottomans \nheld onto Cyprus and rebuilt their fleet, their navy had too few sailor and \nnot enough money, so it was left to rot anyway. The West gained permanent \nand decisive naval superiority over Islam, plagued by pirates on occasion, \nbut never threatened in any serious way.\n\n- *Battle of Diu*: There was more than one of these, but the effect was \nthat Portugal gained control of the Indian Ocean trade. This trade would \npass to Dutch and British control later on. The point is, Islam and the \nIndians lost control of this trade and never got it back.\n\n- *Conquest of the Aztecs and Incas*: Cortes and Pizarro conquered the only \nmajor empires which existed in the Americas at the time, ensuring the \ncolonization of those areas and a massive shift of silver and gold to Spain \nand Europe. While this had some negative consequences (such as inflation!), \nthe conquest left a permanent mark on the world.\n\n- *The Scientific Revolution*: While the West had been ahead of the East in \nscience and technology for some time by the 1600s, the scientific \nrevolution put the West so far ahead as to make any comparison a joke. So \nmany discoveries, inventions, and innovations were made, it is hard to \ndescribe. Here are a few:\n    \n     - Heliocentrism and the telescope\n     - Theory of Gravity\n     - Laws of Motion\n     - Calculus\n     - Latitude and Longitude\n     - The Modern Steam Engine\n     - The Railroad\n     - The Bessemer Process and modern steelmaking\n     - Germ theory and the microscope\n     - Laws of Conservation and Thermodynamics\n     - The Scientific Method itself\n\nSome big names which the East could never match were: Newton, Galileo, \nKepler, Copernicus, Gauss, Leibniz, Priestly, Boyle, Jenner, Benjamin \nFranklin, Cassini, and Lavoisier. And all of them lived before figures such \nas Edison, Einstein, Planck, Hubble, Lemaitre, and dozens of others. I \ndidn't even mention Darwin or superior Western understanding of biology, \napart from germ theory.\n\n10. The development of capitalism. Business practices had changed little in \nthe East, where customary rules dating back many centuries still ran \nthings. This is why China, a vast country, had a smaller economy than tiny \nBritain. By rationalizing their economies, the West was able to channel \nmoney towards to best business practices, eliminate wasteful and \ninefficient firms, promote innovation, and encourage entrepreneurship. And \nwhile all this was happening, the East was still mostly stuck with serfs \nand private merchants. While a handful of Eastern figures were rich, the \nWest was clearly ahead.\n\nThe main reason the gap between the West and the rest has closed somewhat \nis due to Easterners adopting *Western ways*. Just look at Japan. That \ncapitalist economy and open political system is *not* native to their \nculture.\ufeff",

Also Greece is an Eastern Orthodox country, but \nprobably not one we want to exclude from Western status.\n\"Freedom\" free markets and democracy are very much modern phenomena, even \nfor Britain and America, and which most of Europe didn't see until well \ninto the 20th century. This would be fine if we were talking about current \naffairs and using \"Western\" to basically mean \"developed states supportive \nof the US/EU agenda\", but we are talking here about history, going back at \nleast to the Late Middle Ages.

Ancient Greece and Rome both colonized Egypt and the Levant. \nIslam was founded in the aftermath of the fall of Rome and rapidly expanded \ninto formally Roman and Parthican territory, Greco-Roman knowledge became \nthe foundation of the \"Islamic Golden Age\", thousands of Greco-Roman books \nwere translated into Arabic and eventually exported to Western Europe, \nforeshadowing the Renaissance. The Byzantine Empire (a direct successor \nstate to the Eastern Roman Empire) was eventually conquered by Muslim \nTurks, thus founding the Ottoman empire.

I know i already listed this, but it's important. lots \nof people get test anxiety, almost zero actually benefit from it. learn to \nmeditate if you have to, just don't walk into that test-room freaking out. \nit's called state-dependent memory. if you weren't freaking out when you \nlearned the info, it'll be a lot easier to recall if you aren't freaking \nout when you test on it\n\n... whew, okay, sorry again for the text wall, but it was a lot to cover \n... to put it in context, i took 4 AP tests and got between 3 and 5 on all \nof them (granted, i worked my arse off in the classes themselves and \nstudied overtime, but i did better on the tests than in most of the classes \nsomehow) ... we won't talk about how bad i bombed my language test, lol. \nthat's an old shame i don't like to discuss, lol ;p ... but for the most \npart, it's just about being well-rounded and having the ability to reason \nyour way to the answers. and, again, you can do it! :)",

The nineteenth century is no \nlonger as focused on as it used to be so you won't have to worry about it.\n\nInstead of reading straight from the book you have, I would recommend \nbuying the American Pageant book and studying that. That in itself is a \nbunch more work but, to put it into perspective, when I took US History as \na Junior I got a 2 (I didn't use American Pageant). As a senior I bought \nthe American Pageant book and solely relied on it; I wound up with a 5.\n\nHope this helps!",

You have provided a variety of perspectives but you \nhave missed an obvious and vital part of the \"equation\" (considering we're \nusing numbers to quantify history now): the West only became a hegemonic \npower in the last three or four centuries. This video talks about the West \nas though it was destined to be hegemonic from the beginning - an archaic \nand ignorant understanding that many modern historians would dismiss in a \nheartbeat. Every assessment presented here takes that same stance, as \nthough history is some kind of linear narrative. All of the examples in \nthis video have a subtle prejudiced undertone, suggesting that the West is \n\"the best\" because it has something that second and third world countries \ndon't have. Weber's idea of Western hegemony being caused by the protestant \nvalues of hard work and rational thinking seem to have made a comeback. \nMost of these attitudes are a hangover of colonialism. Most importantly, \nCrash Course is reinforcing these ideas to a largely teenage demographic - \ndon't we have enough Eurocentric world views already? I'm super \ndisappointed in whoever wrote the script for this video. I would be happy \nto send you some articles and book titles that will help to expand your \nworldview.\ufeff",

You take India( world \nlargest western democracy) vs China(world largest non western democracy) \nit's pretty clear that China has a lot more human rights development than \nIndia.  \n\nYou take Europe,Japan, United States in the 19th and early 20th century and \nSouth korea, Taiwan in the mid to late 20th century you will find out that \nthey were in the exact same place as China is today; workers get shit pay, \nhuge income inequality,widespread Police brutality, widespread corruption, \ncensorships, human rights violation, environmental pollution etc. United \nStates been through this process as well,a very famous American writer Mark \nTwain called this the Gilded Age.

Anyway, what has China invented \nsince industrialization... The Great Leap? (Actually that was copied from \nthe USSR...).\n\nThe West doesn't need China to produce its goods, it needs China to buy \nthem. While Chinese production of Western goods is beginning to wane, the \nability of Chinese to buy what they produce has never materialized for the \nmajority of Chinese. \n\nChinese do not cooperate very well. In fact, \"cooperation\" is greatly \nsacrificed for the Chinese self-centered nature. HongKongers are not \nChinese. Mainlanders are, and HKers hate those damn locusts just as \neveryone in the free-world should...\n\nAnyway, my point is more about how the West, who invented modernity, has a \ndifferent philosophical background that allowed it to do, invent the modern \nworld, that Chinese could never do. Even without China's ancient \ninventions, the West still would have had the industrial revolution. It's \nnot like the Chinese were travelling abroad and teaching others their \nscience.

I agree that the harnessing of energy (in a very broad sense of the \nterm) is a defining feature in the success of human societies, but this is \nhardly a surprising or innovative conclusion. Historians have always been \naware of this. The real question is: how do some societies become more \nsuccessful at harnessing energy than others? Diamond's book has at best a \nmixed record when answering these questions.\n\n\"You wrongly differentiate pastoral nomads from agrarians: herding is still \nagriculture\"\nThen your problem is with Diamond, who defines agrarian societies as \nsettled farming communities, and places pastoralists in a separate \ncategory. How we're defining the term \"agrarian,\" however, is really beside \nthe point. What matters is that Diamond claims that settled farming \ncommunities are better at harnessing energy than pastoralist ones, and thus \ntend to be more successful, yet he fails to account for the many examples \nin history where pastoralists have conquered farmers.\n\n\"exploitation of such a vast swathe of land as the Americas (not comparable \nin size or wealth to Manchuria or Mongolia)\"\nSo what? It's not at all clear that the size of the territory controlled \ncorrelates with the economic or agricultural success of the country that \ncontrols it. Spain was still the largest Western empire during the \neighteenth century, yet Britain, which at that time controlled a relatively \nsmall amount of land and people, was by far wealthier and more innovative. \nIncreases in an empire's land area do tend to bring economic advantages, \nbut not axiomatically-- like, every time an empire adds a square kilometer, \nit doesn't automatically become wealthier and more powerful. Thus you still \nhaven't explained why conquering Mongolia, Manchuria, and Tibet wouldn't \nhave given China the same advantage as, say, conquering the Eastern \nSeaboard gave to Britain.\n\nMoreover, as historians like BD Wong, Kenneth Pomeranz, and Jonathan K. \nThornton have demonstrated, the same kinds of economic and technological \nrevolutions that Europe experienced during the 16th and 17th centuries were \nalso happening in China, the Middle East, India, and parts of sub-Saharan \nAfrica. Europe doesn't appear to have diverged from the rest in terms of \nthe pace of economic growth and innovation until the late eighteenth \ncentury. If conquering the Americas allowed Europe to develop at a faster \npace than Asia or Africa, why did it take two hundred years for this effect \nto kick in?\n\n\"give him a break and revel in his genius\"\nAbsolutely not! That would encourage bad scholarship. I'll give Diamond \ncredit for what he does right, but I insist on criticizing him for what he \ndoes wrong; otherwise, future scholars would have no incentive to try to \nimprove on it.",

Through agriculture mankind harnessed \nmore of the sun's energy than ever before, allowing us to develop new \ntechnologies, which in turn made the harnessing of energy more productive. \nYou can easily see that this is a positive feedback loop.\nAgrarian societies therefor take an immediate lead over non-agrarians. (You \nwrongly differentiate pastoral nomads from agrarians: herding is still \nagriculture.) \nDiamond in my eyes irrefutably argues why Eurasian agrarians became \ndominant over others (and most importantly Americans).\nEurope being the one to be able to use this advantage to actually conquer \nthe Americas basically explains its advantage over the rest of Eurasia. The \nexploitation of such a vast swathe of land as the Americas (not comparable \nin size or wealth to Manchuria or Mongolia!) greatly improved the West's \nenergy production: through new crops European populations grew, furthermore \ncolonization allowed excess population a place to go, which of course \ncontinuously increased production. Besides, as was explained in a recent CC \nWorld History video a larger base of people generates more innovators: \nanother positive feedback loop. A combination of positive feedback loops \nmeant that while ca. 1500 Europe was at best the equal of the rest of the \nOld World and at worst a backwater, it grew to dominate even the mighty \nstates of the Orient by the 19th century. \nAs said, for all its problems Diamonds theory is essential in understanding \nthe Rise of the West, precisely because it as you said so commendably \nexplains the conquest of the Americas. In the end he is not a historian, \nbut a biologist, a fact from which most of your issues stem, but his work \nis nevertheless of great historiographical importance so give him a break \nand revel in his genius!",

I'd still argue, \nthough, that pastoral nomads are a problem for Diamond's argument, because \nso much of his book concerns the development of agriculture. According to \nhim, the civilizations that develop agriculture earliest are able to \nproduce more food, which allows them to devote more time and labor to \ndeveloping technology, amassing military force, and creating more complex \nsocial structures. This doesn't square well with the success of \nnon-agricultural nomadic peoples.\n\nOnce again, it doesn't matter whether China *needed* to develop \neconomically productive institutions and innovations; the fact is that it \n*did* develop them. As historians like Wong and Pomeranz have documented, \nChina and Europe underwent a similar economic transformation during the \nEarly Modern Period, characterized by the expansion of commerce, a rising \nstandard of living, and an increasing pace of technological development. In \nsome ways, China's institutions were closer to the ideal than Europe, as \nthere were no guilds and fewer state monopolies to restrain economic \nactivity. It is true China's transformation never grew into an industrial \nrevolution, but this likely had more to do with the abundance of coal in \nEurope than with institutional differences.\n\n\"India is no big mystery. It was largely governed by powerful Muslim \nkingdoms\"\nSo what about non-Muslim powers in contemporary India, such as the Maratha \nEmpire and the Sikh Empire?",

But musket armed soldiery were deployed in much larger numbers. \nThe Ottoman empire, Manchu Empire, Mughal Empire all relied on technologies \nand skills developed by nomadic warriors.\n\nMy point is, I suppose, that its wrong to argue that the Eurasian nomads \nconstituted a  *seperate* inferior civilization to that of their sedentary \nneighbors. That isn't really true. The nomads were just people with a \ndifferent lifestyle.\n\nOf course the Chinese had developed various institutions, but because the \nmonarchy was so powerful, they had no need to embrace innovations and \ninstitutions that could create potential power rivals like economically \nautonomous corporations.\n\nIndia is no big mystery. It was largely governed by powerful Muslim \nkingdoms that governed by sharia law, which never embraced innovations like \ncorporations. Not that sharia had no alternative: they promoted the use of \nWaqfs, or Islamic charitable foundations that provided virtually all \nmunicipal services and so forth. They had one major problem though: they \nwere not economically autonomous but entirely restricted by their \nfoundational documents. So if a waqf wanted to invest in a new technology \nor provide a new service, they had to apply for permission from a judge. \nThey also developed no book-keeping or sharing holding, etc, obviously.\n\nWaqfs were ubiquitous in Muslim governed and influenced parts of the world, \nand they were very inflexible. Restricted institutions like this were also \nvery appealing to rulers, because they couldn't invest in dissenting \npolitical causes.\n\nThe emerging industrial technologies were very capital intensive. You could \nimport a steam engine from England, but if all your private companies were \ntiny fragmented partnerships between camel merchants, that was unlikely to \nhappen. Industrialization required quite developed economic institutions.\n\nBad institutions also lead to huge corruption, which is still a pervasive \nproblem in these parts of the world. If every economic change needed \napproval from authorities, bribery became the normal way to make things \nmove forward.",

I'm disputing Diamond's \nclaim that competition, driven by Europe's balkanized geography, was the \nprimary reason for this development. It's not at all clear that societies \nthat face competition tend to be more technologically or economically \ninnovative than those that do-- if that were the case, India, a highly \nfragmented and competitive subcontinent for most of its history, should \nhave become just as advanced as Europe during the eighteenth century.\n\n\"the Ming didn't need to develop policies to enhance economic institutions\"\nBut the point is that regardless of whether they had to develop such \npolicies (and I would argue that they did just as much as Europe, \nregardless of their geography), they *did* develop them.

The pastoral nomads were not technologically \nbackwards. They lived on the harsh periphery of human civilization, but \nthey constantly traded and interacted with agricultural empires adjacent to \nthe steppes. The pastoral nomads were extremely innovative in areas of \nwarfare and because of their harsh livestyle, they often proved much better \nfighters than farming people. Most empires in the Middle east and China \nwere either established by nomadic conquerors or made extensive use of \nnomadic mercenaries. It wasn't until the emergence of capital intensive new \ntechnologies like sophisticated guns and eventually barbed wire, among \nothers, that nomads conclusively fell behind in military terms.\n\nThe same emergence of capital intensive technology proved to be the \ndownfall of Indian, Ottoman and Chinese empires. European societies were \nmuch better prepared to adopt these technologies on a consistent and large \nscale due to institutional developments that were initially difficult for \nmost monarchies to endorse (without the rivalry of other polities). In this \nregard, Diamond is correct. \n\nMonarchies that predominated without competition, like the Ottomans and the \nMing, didn't need to develop policies to enhance economic institutions. \nUsually, they did the opposite and weakened local institutions in favor of \ncentralized power. \n\nThe weaker European monarchies had to be more conciliatory and innovative. \nThe English, Nordics, Swiss etc, for example, enforced the harsh \ninheritance policy of primogeniture which prevented the fragmentation of \nproperty and capital, which prevented uncertainty, preserved \ncompanies,which preserved skills and productive capital (i.e. tools). In \ncontrast, in the Middle East and in India, where Muslim law mainly \npredominated, inheritance was much more egalitarian. If a successful \nmerchant built up a large enterprise, he would have to bequeath it to \nnumerous heirs (families were usually large in the middle ages, especially \nfor rich men due to polygamy and concubinage) instead of appointing a \nsingle primogenitor as was the custom in parts of Europe. The successors \ncould choose to continue the profitable business, but this usually proved \nimpossible as everyone wanted a piece of the pie and productive capital was \nstripped, workers fired and properties sold. \n\nEurope's advantage in capital grew with the widespread adoption of joint \nstock companies that could draw upon the resources of thousands of \nshareholders. These companies could utterly crush local competition in the \nOttoman empire and India.",

                    "text": "Wall of text alert!\n\nGuns, Germs, and Steel should have been a fifty-page essay about how the \nSpanish conquered the Aztecs and the Incas. His discussion of that topic is \ninteresting, well argued, and reasonably well researched, particularly when \nhe talks about why Europeans carried deadlier diseases than Native \nAmericans. Diamond wasn't necessarily the first person to make such an \nargument, of course, but he probably made it more comprehensively than any \nof his predecessors. For this effort he deserves respect and commendation.\n\nThe problems start to crop up when Diamond begins to apply his thesis of \nenvironmental determinism to the rest of the world. Diamond believes that \nthe same geographical influences that explain the European conquest of \nAmerica also explain \"the fate of human societies\" generally. By all \naccounts they do not, but that doesn't stop Diamond from attempting extreme \nfeats of mental contortionist to prove that they do. The following are some \nof the more egregious fallacies that appear in Diamond's work.\n\n1. Shameless cherry-picking\nThe central thesis of Guns, Germs, and Steel is that civilizations living \nin regions that are geographically suited for agriculture tend to become \ndominant. Earlier development of agriculture, combined with the ability to \ncultivate more and better crops and domesticate more and larger animals, \ngives a civilization a surplus of food, leaving many of its inhabitants \nfree to develop better technologies. Domestication of animals also exposes \na people to a wider range of diseases, building immunities. By virtue of \ntheir superior technologies and higher levels of immunities, these \ncivilizations are able to conquer their less-advanced pastoralist and \nhunter-gatherer neighbors.\n\nDiamond cites a number of examples from human history to prove his theory. \nThe European conquest of America is a prime example. Thanks to Eurasia's \nabundant domesticable animals, Europeans carried and were immune to a wide \nrange of diseases which nearly exterminated the Native Americans. Europeans \nalso had more advanced technology than Native Americans, thanks in part to \nthe wider range of crops available in Eurasia. Similarly, the Bantu were \nable to conquer most of Africa, and the Maori the Moriori, because of early \nleads in food production.\n\nMissing from this discussion is any serious treatment of \ntechnologically-backward pastoral societies that conquered their more \nadvanced agricultural neighbors. The examples are numerous: the Turkic \nconquest of the Middle East, the Manchu conquest of China, the Celtic \nconquests in Europe, and the Mongol conquest of most of Asia, to name just \na few. It seems that good tactics and equestrian skill can often more than \noutweigh the advantages of agriculture. What Diamond sees as an iron law of \nhistory turns out to be a pattern that sometimes occurs and sometimes does \nnot, depending on other factors.\n\nNone of this is to say that Diamond's findings on these subjects aren't \nvaluable. There's no question that agriculture, and technology in general, \nplays an important role in conflict between societies, and Diamond is \nprobably right to link it to the Bantu expansion, the conquest of the \nAmericas, and other such events. It is not, however, a universal law of \nhistory, and Diamond's presenting it as such is irresponsible and \ndishonest. Had he truly taken all the evidence into account, he would have \nidentified these trends as \"things that sometimes play a decisive role in \nhistory.\" But that would hardly have been as sonorous, or as provocative, \nas \"The Fate of Human Societies!\"\n\n2. Acceptance of questionable historical claims\nThere are a number of instances in this book when Diamond attempts to \nexplain historical trends that may not have actually happened. Essentially, \nDiamond takes a questionable or even discredited historical theory, accepts \nit as true, and then explains how environmental factors were ultimately \nresponsible. This represents a lazy and self-serving approach to \nhistoriography; Diamond would rather parrot theories that confirm his \nthesis than actually try to get to the bottom of the events he's studying.\n\nTake Diamond's treatment of Africa. He accepts without question that the \ncivilizations of sub-Saharan Africa have always been less wealthy and less \ntechnologically advanced than those of Eurasia. This is a popular belief \namong lay Westerners, and it has some support in scholarly circles, but \nmany historians have argued against it. John K. Thornton, for example, \nargues that Africa's underdevelopment is a relatively recent phenomenon in \nhuman history; before the eighteenth century, sub-Saharan Africa had many \neconomic and technological developments over Europe (c.f.- Thornton, Africa \nand Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World). Even scholars who \ngenerally accept that Africa was always underdeveloped make exceptions for \ncertain parts of Africa and time periods. Acemoglu and Robinson, for \nexample, argue that civilizations of the Sahel region were \"as developed as \ntheir contemporaries anywhere in the world\" during the medieval period, \neven if Africa as a whole was relatively poor and backward (c.f.-- Acemoglu \nand Robinson, Why is Africa Poor?). Suffice to say that Diamond's theory \ndoesn't work if the thing it explains didn't actually happen! Diamond, \nhowever, is either unaware of or unconcerned with the debate over Africa's \ndevelopment. This demonstrates either laziness or ignorance.\n\nAnother questionable claim that Diamond accepts is the idea that European \ncolonization of the Americas gave Europe a definitive economic advantage \nover the rest of the world, leading eventually to the Industrial Revolution \nand the Great Divergence. As with the claim about Africa, this idea has \nsome support in scholarly circles, but it is by no means universally \naccepted. Many historians argue that Europe gained no advantage from the \nAmericas that, say, China did not gain from Manchuria and Mongolia, and \nthus that colonization cannot by itself explain the Great Divergence. \nAgain, Diamond is either unaware of or unconcerned with the debate on this \ntopic. He simply accepts it as true and proceeds to build a \nenvironmentalist argument around it.\n\nDiamond's claims about Africa and colonization may be questionable, but at \nleast they might be true; the same cannot be said about his argument about \nChina. Diamond accepts a popular but now discredited myth about the Middle \nKingdom: that during the Early Modern period, it became reactionary, \ninward-looking, and stagnant. This is demonstrably untrue. China continued \nto develop economically, technologically, culturally, and militarily \nthroughout the period Diamond covers (c.f.- Pomeranz, The Great Divergence: \nChina, Europe, and the making of the Modern World Economy). It was on the \nlosing side of the Great Divergence not because it stopped developing, but \nrather because Europe began developing much faster. Diamond could have \ndisabused himself of this myth by reading peer-reviewed historical research \non the subject, or even just by comparing a map of China in 1600 to one of \nChina in 1800, but he didn't do this. His scholarship is appallingly lazy.\n\n3. Asserting convenient but unsubstantiated theories\nDiamond is not entirely unaware of the weaknesses in his theory. At several \npoints, he attempts to pre-empt his detractors by anticipating their \nobjections and showing how they still fit his theory. These defenses \ngenerally come across as desperate attempts to stuff as many events as \npossible into his thesis. They are marked by his characteristic laziness \nand dishonesty, and ultimately fare no better under scrutiny than his other \narguments.\n\nTake Diamond's treatment of the Middle East. If Diamond is right that \ncivilizations with early advantages in food production tend to become \ndominant, the Middle East presents a problem: it was the first region in \nthe world to develop agriculture, yet it is by no means militarily, \neconomically, or culturally dominant in the modern world. To explain this \napparent contradiction, Diamond points to an ecological disaster that \noccurred in the region around the time of Alexander the Great's conquests. \nThe area's fragile ecology, combined with poor water use and over farming, \nrendered Middle Eastern civilizations poor and backwards. This explains \nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, as well as \nall subsequent European advances over the region.\n\nThis would be convenient for Diamond if not for one problem: the Middle \nEast didn't stop being dominant at that time. For nearly two thousand years \nafter Alexander's conquests, the region remained a world leader in terms of \neconomic, technological, and cultural developments. The Parthian and \nSassanid Empires, the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman \nEmpire were all at least as advanced as European civilizations at their \nheights; it isn't clear that Europe definitively surpassed the Middle East \nuntil the eighteenth century. Unless Diamond can explain how an ecological \ncatastrophe took two thousand years to affect the region, this defense is \nmerely a pathetic attempt to bandage a hemorrhaging thesis.\n\nAnother such bandage is placed on India, which provides a powerful \ncounter-example to one of Diamond's arguments about China. As previously \nmentioned, Diamond parrots the discredited claim that China became a \nstagnant society and offers the following environmental explanation: \nChina's geography predisposed it to political unification. Unification \nmeant no competition, which meant China had no incentive to continue \ndeveloping as a civilization. Even if we exclude the fact that China did \nnot stagnate, it's not clear that political unification was the problem. \nIndia, after all, was politically fragmented for most of its history, yet \nit was no more successful than China after the eighteenth century.\n\nTo address this counter-example, Diamond suggests that just as too little \nfragmentation is a problem, so is too much. Indian states were so \nfragmented and so small, he asserts, that they were unable to develop \neffectively. There is, then, an ideal level of political fragmentation, \nwhich Europe possessed. China and India represent the two harmful extremes.\n\nDiamond, of course, does not give detailed explanations of how political \nfragmentation affected India, let alone develop a theory for how we can \nassess the effects of fragmentation based on its degree. But there's a more \nbasic problem with this argument: it's not clear that India was more \nfragmented than Europe during the period he's describing. Before the \nBritish conquest, the dominant power in India was the Maratha Confederacy, \na state that was roughly five times the size of contemporary France. Even \nsmaller Indian states, such as Mysore, still compared favorably in size \nwith smaller European states like the Dutch Republic. It's not at all \nclear, then, that India's states were too small or too fragmented to \nfunction; they appear to have been quite similar to European states in this \nrespect. Once again, Diamond proves that he's more interested in bolstering \nhis thesis than in gathering and assessing facts.",

The increase in wealth experienced by Spain coincided \nwith a major inflationary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as \nprice revolution. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver \nfrom the New World.\n\nThe increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fueled the \ngrowth of the commercial middle class in Europe, the bourgeoisie, which \ncame to influence the politics and culture of many countries.\n\nIn the Age of Exploration navigators discovered new routes to the Americas \nand Asia. Commerce expanded, together with innovations such as joint stock \ncompanies and various financial institutions.\n\nA variety of theories posit Europe's unique relationship with the New World \nas a major cause of the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the \ncolonies and the slave trade constituted 7 percent a year, a relatively \nhigh rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on \npre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and \ncapital accumulation.\n\nEarly European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New \nWorld goods to Asia, especially silver to China. According to Pomeranz, the \nmost important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, \nuncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large \nquantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth \nand allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization.\n\nNew World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved \nEngland the need for 23 to 25 million acres (100,000 square km) of \ncultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in \nEngland was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of \nresources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.\n\nand then everything we know happened.",

                "text": "Wall-O-Text alert!\n\nFor what it's worth, here's the theory I'm currently enamoured of (which I \ngot from Tory MEP and journalist Daniel Hannan).  Be warned: it's something \nof a narrative, and is thus simplified (which the truth, as we all know, \nresists).  The success of \"the West\", and I'm going to treat that as a \npurely economic success because economic dominance is the source of \nmilitary dominance which in turn is the usual source of political \ndominance, is as a result of what we commonly call \"Western values\" but \nwhich it would be more historically accurate to call \"Anglosphere values\".  \nI'm not making some kind of claim to ethnic exceptionalism here; one of the \ngreat things about these values is their universal applicability and the \nease with which they can be exported.  But the core values of freedom under \nthe law, constitutional government and equality before the law, which along \nwith secure property rights are the foundation of modern Western capitalism \nand the resulting wealth, can all be traced back, through both the US and \nEnglish Bills of Rights, through the English Civil War, through even beyond \nMagna Carta, to the Anglo-Saxon folkright of the common law; a law that is \nthe property of the people, a law that binds the head of state as surely as \nthe meanest peasant (and something which, Francis Fukuyama notwithstanding, \ncannot be found in classical antiquity, nor in the hierarchical, \nZoroastrian power structures of Catholicism).  Moreover, these values, and \nthe things they imply (like regular elections, a free press, or indeed the \nequality of the sexes), though successfully exported to many parts of the \nworld through history's least bad empire\u2122, are by no means something which \nevery nation discovers for itself as soon as it becomes wealthy and modern \nenough.  Indeed, their very survival was gravely threatened by the three \ngreat conflicts of the 20th Century - the two World Wars and the Cold War.  \nConsider the world from the perspective of, say, 1941; almost the whole of \nthe Eurasian landmass was under one form or another of totalitarianism, \nsystems that elevated the state over the individual, emphasised sacrifice \nto the collective, martial glory and so on.  To the leaders of those \nsystems it seemed that the liberal Anglo-Saxon model was on the way out; \nthey called it \"decadent Anglo-Saxon capitalism\" or \"rotten English \nliberalism\", and they felt it surely could not stand against their \nnationalistic fascisms and collective communisms, where everyone was \nworking towards a single great Purpose.  But they were defeated, by a \ncombination of factors that all go back to the effects of the common law.  \nIt is through the common law that the Englishman, the American or the \nAustralian is stubborn, bloody-minded - thus a determined soldier.  He is \ninventive, and will venture a new idea despite the disinterest of \nofficialdom, because free markets have taught him to avoid groupthink - \nthus producing such innovative weapons as centimetric radar or the Mosquito \nbomber.  The economic productivity of the Anglosphere nation is greater \nfor, though less work is extracted from its people than from the enslaved \ninhabitants of a totalitarianism, that work is better directed by the \nmarket system (see also Hayek & the Calculation Problem).  But perhaps most \nimportant of all, the blood-and-soil nationalism of the Continental \nEuropean autocracy is contrasted with the civic nationalism of the \nAnglosphere.  Americans will often tell you with pride that theirs is a \npropositional nation - but that conception of nationhood was not invented \nex nihilo in the Old Courthouse in Philadelphia; it was inherent in the \nnature of the Anglosphere, which anyone could join by signing up to a set \nof values and principles.  It was this binding idea of freedom under law \nthat led so many Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, Indians to travel \nup to halfway around the world to take up arms for a country that, until \nthen, most had never even set eyes.  The entire Commonwealth joined in \nBritain's fight because it was their fight too; the fight between systems \nthat elevate the individual over the State and systems that do the \nreverse.  And when the war was won, we taught, not only the Germans, but \nthe whole of Western Europe, how to emulate and replicate our system of \nfreedom and liberty, and it was only *then* that the values of the \ncommunity of free English-speaking democracies became Western values.\n\ntl;dr: the West is really the Anglosphere and the cause of its rise boils \ndown to Magna Carta, symbol of freedom under law.\ufeff",

The book \nespecially might explain a lot of my confusion.\nIll end with a final few comments though.\n\nI still think your focusing far too much on the UK/\"Anglosphere\" as an \nexplanation for Western successes.\n\nAs you admitted early on in your response, the success of Europe in the \n16th century wasn't the result of a single centralized government which i \nentirely agree with. As you mentioned, it was the result of a variety of \nfactors across different countries in Europe at the time. To me, this \ndoesn't support the \"Anglosphere\" explanation.\n\nOn Spain and Portugal, they are quite an interesting case, but in reference \nto again the \"Anglosphere\" their successes really cant be explained by that \nnarrative. (You yourself talked quite a bit about their mercantile \npractices as a major influence). There were a variety of other more \nimportant factors involved than the \"Anglosphere\".\n\nIn my opinion, this \"reality on the ground\" that we are discussing in the \n16th and 17th centuries, that ive again reinforced in the last two \nparagraphs, contradicts the \"Anglosphere\" narrative as a means to explain \nWestern dominance.

                    "text": "+Arakash Europe's strength in (your example) the 16th century was that it \nwas a plurality of small and competing nation-states, which forced each to \nbe freer than the great empires of Asia.  Unlike those empires, Europe was \nnever centralised; no one prelate or prince could arrogate the whole \nsurplus production of a vast polity to satisfy the vanities of his court; \nby avoiding remote and arbitrary government, efficiency and freedom were \npromoted.  It is Europe's tragedy that just as Asia has discovered the \nbenefits of market capitalism and dispersed powers, the EU has taken us in \nthe opposite direction, towards the creation of a single European state.  \nFortunately, we seem to be on course to prevent that :)\n\nSpain and Portugal strangled themselves by the mercantilist system.  Their \nskill at navigation, grown through a geographical situation that encouraged \nsea trade, gave them a great advantage in colonising the New World.  But so \npreoccupied were they with obtaining precious metals - mistaking, as they \ndid, money for wealth - that their entire colonial enterprise was directed \ntowards the importation of those metals, and the taxation of that \nimportation to provide a revenue to the sovereign, the intention being to \nprevent re-exportation of those metals.  The full story can be found in \nBook IV of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, which chiefly consists of a \ncriticism of the mercantilist system.\n\nWhy the Anglosphere?  Simply because, until comparatively recently, it was \nonly in the Anglosphere that the law was held to be above the government, \nand it is only there that the law is the property of the people, grown case \nby case like a coral rather than written down in the abstract and then \napplied to specific cases.  It was this primacy of law that produced the \nsecure property rights required for market capitalism and the Industrial \nRevolution.  You can see prefigurings of this in Adam Smith; wherever he \ncompares commercial regulation between the UK and Europe, while the \nrestrictions at home are denounced as illiberal and counterproductive they \nare always observed to be far more liberal in character than those on the \nContinent; and this can only be attributed to the way in which the \ngovernment is seen as the servant of the people rather than their master.\n\nAnother factor is geographical; England's great rise to prosperity came \nafter its Act of Union with Scotland, and most of the other Anglosphere \nnations have been islands (Australia; New Zealand; to an extent, North \nAmerica considered as a unit).  An island nation has no need for a large \nstanding army in peacetime, and thus the government (at least prior to the \nmechanisation of war that began around the turn of the 20th century) has no \nmeans of repression and control of its people.  Perhaps that is part of the \nreason why, while so much of Europe remained under rigid autocratic \nsystems, the Anglosphere maintained its stubborn and ornery individualism.  \nMoreover, Americans and Australians were both further from Europe's wars \nand inclined to produce a more liberal and individualistic society even \nthan England; the same differences that European travellers in England \nobserved as compared to their own peoples, were observed by English \ntravellers in both those regions.  As de Tocqueville puts it: \"The American \nis the Englishman left to himself.\"\n\nI already covered, in the gp, a list of non-economic, Anglosphere reasons \nfor Western military success.\n\nIf you want the full detail on this argument, by the way, it can be found \nin Hannan's book, \"Inventing Freedom: How the English-Speaking Peoples Made \nthe Modern World\".  Alternatively, there are several talks he has given on \nthe book that can be found on YouTube.",

If anything I blame the fact that they want all \nkids to be on the same level \"no kid left behind\".. well the fact of the \nmatter is all kids aren't on the same level! If you evaluate that and work \nwith that instead of against that most kids would do much better in school.\nMy sister just started the 9th grade and since I graduated they've come up \nwith this stupid plan to make kids that aren't in Algebra 1 as of the 9th \ngrade have to take both Algebra 1 and Geometry in the same year so that \nthey can be on the same page as the other kids umm.. ok if kids are \nstruggling with JUST Algebra how do you expect them to be able to handle \ntaking both Algebra and Geometry together? These kids don't need to be \nrushed they need to be sat down with and worked with 101.\n\nI only had 1 great teacher while I was in high school and everybody hated \nhim because he made us do a ton of work and never gave study guides, but he \nis the one and *only* teacher that actually prepared me for college the \nrest of them would just say \"I'm preparing you for college\" as they handed \nout crap that I have never used in college before.\nI'm sorry, but taking a vocabulary test does not prepare kids for college \nif you give them words Monday and a test Friday I guarantee they'll forget \nthose words by the next Tuesday, but if you make them *learn* what those \nwords mean and maybe give them an assignment to write an essay \nincorporating all of those words together and correct that essay when they \nturn it in giving constructive feedback (not that bullshit \"you got an \n80\"... doesn't explain why you made the grade you did) they'll actually \nlearn how to apply those words vs memorizing them for 5 days.\n\nMy hate for the American public school system is so strong though they just \nwasted so much of my time and wanted to hold me back (so they could keep \nall the kids in the grade on the same level) this is why I'm homeschooling \nmy kids. I feel the average student has the ability to be doing college \nwork by the age of 16 (no I'm not talking about smart kids.. I'm talking \nabout the average joe), but unfortunately they just don't get challenged \nearly enough and end up getting sick of school.",

Europeans (Spanish specifically) were the first to find the \nAmericas and also have a large enough military force (and motivation) to \nfind a profit in engaging the ocean-side people. Gold was valued much more \nin Europe than in the Americas and the native people had a lot of it. \nFrancis Drake raids the American coasts from somewhere around Central \nAmerica down to the southernmost tip of South America and back up the west \ncoast, taking all the gold he could. This encouraged Spain to send more \nships to accomplish the same thing. England's Virgin Queen (who was a \ntease) led on Spain's King, while funding a ton of \"privateers\" (pirates) \nto raid Spanish ships and bring home the American gold that was on them. \nOnly once England had stolen most of Spain's (the Americas') wealth did the \nSpanish king realize that not only would he (edit: not) get to have sex \nwith England's Queen; but, she was not even a virgin to begin with.
