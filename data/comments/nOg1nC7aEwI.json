Like when I was rank #6 I \nthought I was bad because 5 people where better than me. Emotionally I \nthink I am bad at math even though I'm well above average. The reason is I \ncompare myself to the best not the average person. If you look at the \npeople above you, you'll be motivated to get on their level. If you look at \nthe people below you, you'll be satisfied with your position and wont \nimprove yourself. Pessimism isn't always a bad thing you know.\n\nNothing is fixed everything is acquired through practice. Newton and \nEinstein weren't born smart, they became gods at what they did through \nspending 1000s of hours crafting their talent. How much you value something \ndictates how good you are at it. Since I value philosophy and having sharp \narguments, if an opponent makes a good point and I cannot think of a \nresponse on the spot, every now and then through out the day I will think \nabout a counter argument while most people just wont respond, like peter \npan for example. Even if I don't have an answer after a week I will still \nthink about it until I do have an answer. To you it might sound obsessive, \nthat's because it is. obsession is necessary to become the best at \nanything, singing, basketball, theoretical physics, whatever.

And if i'm not \nmistaken that ice wall only runs straight along one side. It just ceases to \nexist for the other 3 directions.\n\nI have no qualms with your theory though. It seems very likely. I think \nAnnie might have disagreed with her father's plans though. Hence the scene \nwhere he's begging her forgiveness. Would explain why she didn't help X and \nY attack on that day, even if she wasn't needed. And also why she seemed so \ndesperate to take Eren unharmed. Perhaps an order was put in for him to be \nkilled since his father didn't want to help. Or perhaps just captured, and \nAnnie remains loyal to X and Y and their plan.\n\nAnd i'm not sure it'd be as simple as just wreathing himself in fire, i'm \npretty sure it was as a result of his regeneration which we know for a fact \nto be a heap ton faster than normal titans and even Annies. So he'd need to \nbe in a desperate situation to utilize it. Which of course is bad news, cos \nwe don't want him to be near death. xD",

If I \nwatch something and notice that the subs aren't accurate to what I know is \nbeing said it frustrates me.\n\nAnyways. Crystal. The only reason Annie is not being forced out her crystal \nis because there's a fear if it shatters she'd die too. So what they're \nplanning to do is A) as you say and wait it out. She won't have the power \nto keep it going forever. And D) is something Eren might do over-time but \nhe needs time to train. I'm more interested in the rapid regeneration and \nflames as a side effect of that he seems like he might be able to control, \nbut he was enranged and lost himself for a while, so again he'd need to \ntrain.\n\nAs for annoying. A, B and D are all true. I don't mind B though personally, \nI think it makes for interesting videos since you really want them to win \nand do well. Which is why AOT is so good since there's never that guarantee \nof \"He's the main character, he won't die\". Hell, I swear to God believed \nhe had died. Hadn't seen him for 9 episodes or so, it must've been hell for \nthose in Japan to wait that amount in weeks. As for C) I just think Eren is \nin too much of a dilemma with the vast amount of responsibility forced on \nhim. He can't seem to accept the fact that there's others like him out \nthere but that they want to destroy humanity, not help it. I wouldn't \nreally say it's annoying moreso than it's temporary personality until he \ngrasps the situation more maturely.\n\nThe ice wall? In Game of thrones though that 200+ metre wall is only one \nside of four. Not really good when the entire world is run over with \nTitans, they would be weak like any other to an attack elsewhere. And then \nthere's the fact it'd have the same problems such as lack of manpower and \nresources. They wouldn't have an empire to back them up, they'd need to \nrely on themselves and they can't exactly go out and farm if there's very \nlittle defences. My GOT knowledge isn't the best though so feel free to \ncorrect me. As for B) season two! :D\nThey could very easily kill humanity, yes. At anytime, anyplace. But why? \nWhy now? Why start there? Why didn't they just skip the little bait city \nand go straight in for the wall breach somewhere less defended instead of \nhaving to break two walls for the same result? This is something Eren can't \nunderstand and why there are humans killing humanity. We'll need to wait \nand find out!",

                    "text": "+Eren Jaeger Thanks for actually answering my lengthy reply. As far as dubs \ngo, there are only two anime that really stand up, Cowboy Bebop an Death \nNote (FMA and FMAB are okay but Ed's voice is painful to listen to, I \nmostly just watch the bits with Wrath(brotherhood)). What I'd like is for \nthe west to start taking the medium seriously and start contributing (give \nthose talented voice actors some work guys). Right now the closest thing \nI've seen in the west that compares is A:TLA and A:TLoK, and they're \nfreaking Y7 nickelodeon cartoons. There's so much back and forth between \nour cultures it should be inevitable. My main gripes are with the dialogue, \neverything else is just nitpicking, you can tell that the monologues were \nlikely pulled off the pages of the manga given their structure. This is \nhowever, a common trope in anime. It'd be nice to learn Japanese but I \ndon't have that much time on my hands lol. \n\nAs far as the crystal goes,\n\nA. She would eventually starve or asphyxiate even in stasis.\n\nB. Diamond is exceptionally hard but it is very fragile, a massive blunt \nobject applied to the right point with the right point would shatter it.\n\nC. All they need to do is bring her somewhere far underground, she won't \nescape.\n\nD. If Eren could learn the same trick he could break it down.\n\nAnnoying,\n\nA. the dub, nuff said.\n\nB. I'm tired of the reckless, headstrong, and slightly thick character type \nthat is inevitable in most shounen and western entertainment. It is done \nwell here though.\n\nC. He demands respect and understanding of others when he himself finds \nthis difficult.\n\nD. I'll say it again, the dub.\n\nThe Wall\n\nA. Have you read game of thrones?\n\nB. The colossal and armored Titan's are human's with a gift like Eren, If \nthey were determined they could breach the walls. They could breach them at \nany point, also maintenance/killing of Titan's around the outer wall would \nbe important.  ",

                    "text": "+Nathan C.\nI'm not surprised you're so confused, the English dub is shit. All dubs are \nto be honest minus a few. Anyways, since i'm bored and I love AOT, to \nanswer your questions:\n\n1) We do have effective artillery, we can break though their incredibly \ntough skin and bones to decapitate them but due to the fact they regerenate \nand the precision of said artillery is not reliable enough for destroying \nthat small area on the back of the neck it's not commonly used. And given \nthe recent attack ending the 100 years peace, we did indeed improve our \nfixed cannons. And said cannons were used over a cours of a week to empty a \ncity filled with cannons, but that's a week of cannon fire. It takes some \ntime.\n\n2) Scouting at night is stupid. Sure, the titans are *slower* and more \nsluggish (not sleeping or knocked out)  but we rely on vision to \neffectively scout. Without it, we can't communicate to others. Flares would \nbe easier to notice, granted, but what's the point if you can't spot the \nTitans you're trying to avoid? In an encounter, we also can't see where \nwe're aiming or in the heat of the fight who is attacking which titan, etc. \nLeading to possible mid-air crashes.\n\n3) Not sure what the Dub says, but people have already tried to survive in \nthe mountains. Something tells me though that 30m monsters can climb the \nmountains easier than us though. Also, we're talking about 100 years or \nso+. Getting resources from a mountain or up and down a mountain would be \nvery hard, and it'd offer no defence other than the height. Which again, \nhave to stress, wouldn't kill the titans. A fall means nothing to them.\n\n4) Because....we've had sooo many decades of peace that it's never been \nthought necessary. Ignoring that though, there's a lot of people forced to \ntake the tests. Those who fail the extreme tests to use the 3DMG aren't \neven fit to be Titan bait, that's how hard this war is. And as such are \nthrown into the fields to feed humanity which alone is a massive problem. \n(Hence the tens of thousands unarmed \"soldiers\" sent to reclaim the wall)\n\n5) There's no alternative weapons, that's why. Guns are useless and serve \nonly as deterrent to crimes and a distraction to small (<10m) titans. We \nneed to kill them from behind. Once they see us, we need to out-maneuver \nthem. These blades are the only material we know of capable of cutting hard \nand deep into them. Why fix what isn't broken? It's the best we have.\n\n6) Swords aren't designed to break, it's just the best we have as said in \nthe previous question. You seriously underestimate the toughness of the \nTitan's skin, after a while it gets dull and require swapping. In the manga \nthese blades are often reclaimed after battles to be reforged and \nsharpened, if not entirely melted down and made anew.\n\n7) Look out for season 2, perhaps that'll be explained then. Otherwise \nmanga stuff, don't want spoilers.\n\n8) Look at 3 again, kinda same point. A few 30m titans will probably be \nable to waddle over to it, ignoring the water. If not, well it'll destroy \nany bridges or supports to the city/bridge in the process of trying to get \nback to the surface. Once that's done in a city like that they'll struggle \nto get resources. They'd be starved out within a decade. And we've not even \nconsider the Colossal Titan appearing for any of these yet, as it did for \nthe show's city, so i'm being generous, really.\n\n9) What weapons? A building? Another titan? Sorry, but pretty sure Eren \ndoesn't want to destroy buildings deliberately, he's already being closely \nwatched as it is. And he has used titans against titans, quite effectively \ntoo. Perhaps designing a titan-sized blade for Eren would be a nice idea, \neh? Costly though, very, very costly. And probably impossible given the \nscale. That's that out the window.\n\n10) It's really not. Entrances are, with several key points of the outer \nrings that are designed to attract attention. No reason for inner walls to \nbe manned, is there? And there's no titan agression against the wall \nbecause it's physically impossible even for a 30m big one to damage it, so \nthey've evolved and learnt entrances are the only way in and something they \nknow they'll be able to find humans at.\n\n11) Again with the dub? We really didn't forget how to deal with them, \nwe've continually over those 100 years had expeditions outside the wall and \nlearnt literally loads of very valuable information about our enemy. We've \ncontinually had newer and newer recruits trained to maintain the wall with \nbasic fighting experience if one or two were to get through the entrance \nand we've continually had the \"elite\" go off and protect the important and \nthe rich mostly from other humans. As the sub says though, those who have \nno contact with the titans or training to deal with them, yes, these \ncommoners may have forgotten about the threat they posed. That's why \n\"Humanity remembered\" it's one of the hard-hitting storyline points.\n\n11.5) As for the builders of the wall, well, it's unknown, ain't it? That's \nwhy so many of the surviving humans believe they've had divine help. We'll \nprobably find out more in season 2, but at this point it's not really as \nimportant as why there's titans in the wall and how they got there. Perhaps \nthat's how they started the first walls off, with titan walls?\n\n12) You saw the underground pasages near the end of the anime? They were an \nold sewage system they had going on, suggests they've since replaced it \nwith something better or more efficient.\n\n13) Doctors, we've not lost all technology. The closer to the middle you \nget, the more \"normal\" life is. In a far away town like Eren and Mikasa's \nthough, yes, Plague can be a problem. Not sure what the dub says, but \nEren's dad saved the entire town from a plague once already. And he often \nwent inland so we can assume easily he might have had a hand in offering \nvacinations elsewhere too to prevent outbreaks.\n\n14) Subjective. Bad-ass, yes. Annoying, don't see how. As Mikasa puts it, \nhe is indecisive. He trusts his fellow humans too much, hence his massively \ndelayed reaction to fighting Annie and his inability to believe she's the \nenemy. He still can't believe it either once he actually captures her. \nRemember, he's still human. He ain't even killed a Titan yet in the anime \nor manga at this point as a human, he's still learning.\n\n15) Metal spikes? Stronger than the strongest metal we have available which \nis our steel swords? Well good luck finding some. Jean tried to use his \nsword to break into the crystal, but it's incredibly hard. Harder than \nanything ever seen before. Going titan wouldn't help either, to be honest. \nYou're just giving Annie a means to escape.\n\n16) Cos dubs. Dubs are cancer in the Anime world, i'd advise against them \n100%.\n\n17) Because of all the above.\nLike, literally the best fanbase i've ever seen. And in general it's just \nsuch a fucking amazing show.\n\nHOW'S THAT FOR ANSWERS? MWAHAHAHAHA.\n\nTL:DR\nSUBS, MANGA (OPTIONAL) AND SEASON 2\nI've watched the subs 5 times now, read the manga and are aware of a season \ntwo announcement early next year to be expected.\nIf just one season explains everything, we'd have no reason to watch season \ntwo. :(",

Writers are producing works of art, and if they actually \ncare about what they are writing, they will make sure it's at least \nsensical. Animation quality isn't crucial, but I consider good animation to \nbe both detailed and consistent, not have characters look oddly \ndisproportionate at times and sometimes be too lazy to even give them a \nface. I also expect there to be a theme. The writer should have some sort \nof meaningful purpose behind his story. Simply writing nonsensical story \nlines to appease an audience is hardly even art. Art's about expressing \nsomething about you. If the only motivation you have behind your piece is \nto pander to an audience and don't actually put anything of substance in \nit, then it's about as much as art as the toaster. It's just a convenience. \nThe only thing I *didn't* think was crap about SAO was the music. The story \nline was so meaningless, nonsensical and boring, the only reason I got some \nenjoyment out of it was because the compositions were decently captivating. \nBut that couldn't even keep me interested to how stupid the second part \nwas.
