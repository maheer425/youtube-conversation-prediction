Always check the weather before going \nout, even though its the summer here, the weather never makes up its mind. \nYou don't need to tip the waiter if he/she didn't provide good service. Do \nnot stop suddenly when your walking on the pavement or just stand still in \nthe middle, its the most annoying thing that tourists do. Good manners is \nalways appreciated. If you going to party then check the time of the last \ntrain so that your not stranded and have to take the dreaded night bus. If \nyou want to save money on travelling on the tube, try planning your trips \nat the off peak hours, this will definitely save you some money. If you see \npeople looking sad and miserable on the tube, don't worry its normal and DO \nNOT stare at a person for more than 2-3 seconds, it becomes VERY awkward. I \nthink that's a bout it.",
