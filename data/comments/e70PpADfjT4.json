And I also wish that people \nwouldn't attack people who like one animal just because they happen to like \nthe other. I see it in the comments on every video about pets on YouTube.\nI love both cats and dogs. I have both at home. They are two totally \ndifferent animals, and are great in their own ways. I don't think one \ndeserves help more than the other.\nBoth cats and dogs have their unfair disadvantages. And I don't know how \nmany times a I hear about a dog(or cat) getting beaten or shot or starved \nand I hear someone say well cats(or dogs) get treated like \"THIS\"  It \nbreaks my heart because they are blinded to the suffering of that animal \nbecause they only have sight for another. \nIts almost bothers me as much as news of children getting abused and then \nsomeone saying \"well other children get beaten worse\". You know what, maybe \nthey do, but It does NOT make what happened to that child okay , and does \nnothing to help children suffering from abuse.\n \nI'm just saying other dogs, who were more vicious than the one on the video \nhave been worked with and rehabilitated, dogs that went directly for the \nthroat instead of the leg. I just feel bad that the dog was put down \nbecause his owner was neglectful. Maybe in the area where they lived they \ndon't have the resources to work with him, but its just saddening to me \nthat an animal had to die. I don't agree with the original poster, the \ntricycle was at a standstill so it couldn't have drawn the dogs attention. \nAnd if he were afraid he would be backing away and barking at the tricycle \nand his ears would be back. He bit the boy intentionally. In my opinion it \nwas a territorial thing. Because a lot of dog who are locked up in their \nback yards or wherever and are never socialized end up like that. And the \nowners admitted to keeping him locked up and training him as a guard dog.",

                    "text": "+Night b0t Lol, My point wasn't where I lived, I used it as an example to \nrefute your statement about only cats being mistreated, I like to back my \nresponses instead of just vomiting random bullshit statements with nothing \nto back it up.\n My point, which you continuously keep missing, is that just because you \nthink cats have it bad doesn't mean all animals should be looked over.\n I don't care what you give two fucks about and honestly there is not cat \nor dog side when it comes to animal rights. That, you idiot is what I've \nbeen saying.\n I'm on the side of all animals and I don't think ANY animal should suffer \ncat or dog. But you seem to have tunnel vision for cats and in your narrow \nminded ignorance are missing my point all together.\nThe reason I am telling you this \"shit\" is to back up why I disagreed with \nyou, that not only cats suffer like you seem to think they do. ALL ANIMALS \nneed our help. And when you throw off on a dog being mistreated saying that \ncats are worse off you aren't helping at all. Honestly my entire point went \nway over your head.\n I discussed where I lived because I used it as an example that dogs get \nmistreated too, and to tell you why you were wrong in saying that cats get \nput down all the time and no one does it to dogs. People put their dogs \ndown all the time just because they don't want them anymore.\n I can't believe I have to go that far to explain that to you.\n\nCats being put down because they scratch you soft lol.....\nI know people who have SCARS from their cats and still keep them. \n\nAnd you know what, horses get put down when they can't race anymore, and \ndogs get put down just for excessive barking.\nNot only cats are in danger.\n\nAlso, I don't care about you either, I honestly didn't want to sink down to \nthis level, but I think you are ignorant, and you have no depth or you \nwould have gotten my reasoning the first time I said it instead of going \noff about where I lived.\nI also hope that you are still in school because you use too many chat \nabbreviations, have poor grammar, and basically come off sounding like an \nilliterate moron.\n\nDamn..I went there, and am ashamed I went there, but I'm done with you and \nwill have no further dialogue with you because you missed my point entirely \nand have nothing intelligent to bring into a debate.",

And I \nknow of cat people who hate dogs that will swerve on the road to hit dogs \nwhen they are driving. So it goes both ways. And cats CAN hurt you when \nthey bite. My grandma had to get stitches after her cat attacked her. And \nthere are certain breeds of dog that no one will defend and just assume \nthey are bad and kill them for what they are. A woman's dog was shot 11 \ntimes by police just because it was a pitbull, they were even caught \npremeditating it before they arrived to the house. Her father was watching \nthe dog and it got loose and someone called the police and reported it. The \ndog was a still a pup and wasn't showing any aggression at all and was \nrunning away from the police when it was shot. How many cats get shot by \nthe police for no reason? Another policeman shot a dog in someones backyard \nwhen he went to check for a suspect and went to the wrong house. Yeah cats \nget treated like shit, but so do dogs. There should be more and stricter \nlaws protecting animals but there aren't and it doesn't help when people \nsay \"oh well cats are treated like this\" when a dog is treated poorly. It \nthe same when someone reports a cat being beaten and someone says \"well \ndogs get beat all the time.\" no matter what is done to a cat or what is \ndone to a dog it is still WRONG when ONE of them is mistreated. And \ndownplaying it by saying that one or the other gets worse treatment, does \nnothing to help out all animals in general.\n\nDo you know that in the south where I used to be from, there are packs of \nwild dogs where people just dump them on the side of the road when they no \nlonger want them, and cars swerve to hit them? And in the south most don't \nreally believe in taking dogs OR cats (but mostly dogs) to shelters and \njust take them out and shoot them when they dont want them anymore because \n\"they're just dogs\" I used to live in KY and although its gotten better, it \nis still a problem.

If \nTara had not intervened I could have been a tragically worse mauling. \nStating that the dog acted aggressively is not a slight on the dog or dogs \nin general.

First, that dog should \nnot have been available to run loose, unattended on the streets.

                    "text": "+Night b0t So just because according to you no one cares about cats being \nput down, it's okay to kill other species of animals? Cats bite people all \nthe time and they still keep them as pets and most of them say, \"oh cat's \nare just temperamental\". If I had a quarter for every time I heard that \none. My grandmas cat put her into the hospital, and she still kept it. She \nwas diabetic and the bites and scratches messed her up bad.\n\nBut usually when a dog bites (other than small dogs) it is immediately \ngone. I guess it has to do with smaller animals not causing as much damage. \nMy in-law's German Shepard was put down after it bit his hand, but my \nin-law decided that beating the shit out of his dog was a proper form of \ndog training. The poor dog would get scared and piss himself when he was \nyelled at. He did NOT deserve to be put down, no matter how many cats you \nthink were wrongfully euthanized.  Every animal deserves the chance to live.\n\n There are organizations out there that work on saving cats from \"death \nrow\" I know this because I adopted a cat through one of those \norganizations, she was 20 years old and was going to be put down because of \nher age and aggression toward strangers. Her owner was an elderly woman who \njust passed away. I agree that there is an epidemic of feral cats, no one \nspays or neuters them and lets them run wild and become over populated, and \nsome animal shelters will put them down regardless of their temperament \nbecause they are overrun and most people go there to adopt puppies. There \nshould be more organizations for cats, especially for feral cats. ",

I \nunderstand why the dog was put down and no I would not have given it back \nto the previous owners for rehabilitation and in a perfect would he would \nhave been taken to a place where dogs are retaught and become useful \nmembers of society, but you are correct, this isn't a perfect world and \nthere ARE thousands of non aggressive dogs that are put down every week \nsimply because irresponsible people breed with out thinking, or owners \ndon't want the responsibility. (not that its always so cut and dry, but \nmore than anything its those two reasons) Truth is, its done and there is \nnot a damn thing I can do about it. I just think that dog ownership should \nbe far more regulated.\n\nAlso cats can and do kill, but most of the time its an accident. They have \nbeen known to suffocate infants by either sleeping on them, or licking \ntheir mouths so they can't breathe. But more likely, cats can give disease \nthrough bites and scratches that left untreated can become life threatening.\n\nI guess I'm more angry at the owners because they just failed that dog one \ntime after another.

I have cats, and I'd not dream of putting them to \nsleep if they turn aggressive, but cats are different from dogs: they can't \nkill you, they don't hunt people, and they usually have a reason for their \naggression one can deal with. I don't know much about dog behavior though. \nIt's impossible to imagine a cat going after a child outside, and indoors \nthey can be easily supervised. My cousin has an aggressive biter cat, and \nshe retrained him.\n\nI did however read more about this particular case. Interestingly, the \nmother of the child didn't want to kill the dog and hoped it could be \nretrained. Incidentally, what we don't see on the video is that the reason \nthe mother went away is that the dog came around the car and wanted to \nattack again. The mother chased it away, and it bit the mother. In the \nshelter where it was for observation for two weeks, it bit everyone there. \nCould it have been retrained - maybe, but if the owner doesn't fight for \nthe dog, do you think anybody would? Can the dog be trusted not to attack \nagain? I suppose it could have been muzzled outside, but at any rate, the \nowner didn't want to fight. It's obvious that the owner should have trained \nthe dog and should've kept the dog in the yard. None of these things \nhappened. Now, would anybody trust this particular owner? What if next time \nthe dog kills someone? At any rate, with so many sweet friendly animals \nkilled in shelters, would anybody else take this dog? Keep in mind, that \nknowingly keeping an aggressive dog is a huge liability risk if the dog \nbites someone. If the dog seriously injures and kills someone the owner can \nend up in jail. Of course, a responsible owner could've muzzled the dog \noutside, and kept it leashed inside.\n\nThese are some of the things to consider.\n ",

Dogs have less intelligence than a four year \nold, and the bite of a killer, thus they are very much akin to a person \nwith mental retardation. I used to work with mentally deficient individuals \nand they were capable of hurting me with out blinking an eye and on several \noccasions I walked away with massive bruises, lacerations, and various \nother personal injuries. Now are you telling me that a being that has less \nreasoning capability than a moderately mentally retarded person is anything \nlike a mass murderer? And by your logic should we be putting those with \nmental disabilities to death before we allow them a chance to learn and \ngrow? One particular individual I worked with was born with fetal alchohol \nsyndrome and had very bad reasoning skills and would spend her time \n\"hunting out\" the weak staff and she would attack them mercilessly. I was \nplaced in the house and when I stood up to her she attacked me and on more \nthan one occasion. That was two years ago. When I left the company I was \nworking for we had her calm, she was happy, on a schedule and productive in \nher work place. Had we simply thrown her in a padded cell and left her to \nrot she wouldn't be the person she is today. She would have lost her \napartment, and lost her dear roommate and friend. She would have wilted. No \nits not always nurture over nature but I think to throw away a life simply \nbecause a dog isn't an easy fix is cruel and unusual punishment.",

I'm not \nworried about the other dogs there that \"place\" it is going to take because \npeople will most likely take the dog that isn't going to be a lot of \ntrouble. It takes a RARE person to want to work with a troubled dog. My \naunts dog used to be aggressive. She was beaten by her owners so badly she \nhad broken teeth.
