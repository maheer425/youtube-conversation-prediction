This is \ndoubly so in the case of HIV (a virus, or complex protein, not a bacterium) \nas it affects the immune system; the drug would have to get to the small \nintestine (again, it still has to get through the destructive stomach \nfirst) before it's even close the lymphatic system, let alone the \ncirculatory system. If you're instead referring to a pill, you'd have to be \nusing a relatively simple (relative to a protein, that is) chemical to keep \nfrom losing effectiveness in a solid, pill form. This works when we're \ndealing with combating microorganisms (like bacteria) because said chemical \nwould only have to affect one of many necessary functions (such as the \nbreakdown of nutrients, the separation of the cell, etc.) wherein a virus, \nbeing nothing but a complex chemical, requires none of that for its one \naction: \"reproduction\" (it's in this way that our complexity becomes our \ndownfall). Proteins can really only be taken down in one way: denaturation, \nor the alteration of one (or more) of their structure levels (how the \nprotein is shaped and ultimately, how it acts {remember the mantra, \"form \nfits function\"}). There are, however, chemicals capable of carrying out \ndenaturation, though these chemicals (examples of which include sulfuric \nacid) have a way of denaturing any protein they come in contact with \n(including the one that you need to survive). This is than amplified by the \nfact that pills are \"dumb\"; there is not way of effectively controlling \nwhat they interact with. The solution comes back to proteins which can be \ndesigned to attack certain chemical bonds (such as those in a virus). These \nproteins are, of course, called antibodies and produced by the immune \nsystem. With HIV (along with any virus that leads to immunodeficiency), \nhowever, your immune system becomes too damaged before you're able to \ndevelop an antibody to fit HIV's ever-changing form. This, of course, is \nwhat makes HIV so complicating and hard to fight and why the cure will \nlikely have to be man made. My  point in all of this is: the cure for HIV \nwould have to be in the form of a protein-based injection (hopefully, you \ngleamed some other facts from this as well). Cheers!",

However, a decision \nwhich involves riskiness is only glorified after the good outcome is \nachieved. Due to a principle of uncertainty regarding this matter (not to \nbe confused with that of quantum mechanics), risky decisions may actually \nresult in undesired consequences. People evoke sympathy for the suffering \nof others, so when a decision which leads to the debilitation or mortality \nof others, people may commonly reject all of what that decision maker \nstands for. A good example of this would be president Carter's decision in \n1980 to attempt to rescue hostages during the Iran Hostage Crisis. As many \npeople know, the mission was a complete failure because not only were any \nhostages rescued, but also eight American service men were killed. Carter \nlater lost the reelection. In the event of small pox, not only might Jenner \nhave killed a young boy but also may have spread the disease even more than \nit already has, potentially causing a chain reaction of human deaths. Even \nthough the disease has been almost been completely thrust out of existence \nbecause of his efforts, his risking of human lives must not be glorified \nbut rather we should simply be relieved that he had not killed anyone \nindirectly. I am also not just attacking Edward Jenner. I want all of you \nwho read this comment to consider the value of every person's life when you \nhear about an option with results as insecure as such. Yes, there exist \nsome circumstances where the rejection of this kind of sacrifice may lead \nto more overall suffering than in the event of utilized sacrifice. However, \nI want to point out that it can often be unnecessary and utterly useless \namong the grand scheme of things.",

The series pairs professional \neducators with top-notch animators to create short video lessons on a huge \nvariety of topics in science, medicine and history. This episode features \nseveral of the early attempts to fight smallpox, a disease caused by a \nhighly infectious, often fatal virus that plagued humanity for at least \n10,000 years and wasn\u2019t fully eradicated until 1979. Physician Edward \nJenner (1749\u20131823) is credited with developing the first vaccine against \nsmallpox, but as the video points out, he probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten far \nwithout a young boy named James Phipps, a cow and milkmaid Sarah Nelmes.\n\nBut more importantly, viewing a bigger picture, I post this as a reminder \nthat we are all connected. That the deceases that arise from lack of \nresources to meet basic human needs affect everyone at the end. A little \nfood for thought on our insurance/health care system and on distribution of \nresources.\n\nNow, beware of all the toxic preservatives and other additions the new \nbiotechs/pharmaceutical companies add to vaccines so they last longer, \ntherefore, they can make more money. Ask your doctor for the purest \nalternatives with less or without preservatives (and read the articles I'm \nposting in the comments)... \ufeff",
