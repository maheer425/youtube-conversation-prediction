There are literally \nhundreds of untold stories that would make great movies, as well, but \nstudios are afraid to market for fear of it being seen as a \"minority \nmovie\". Look no further than Sony's leaked emails about the Equalizer. \n\nI'll see Costner in Black and White coming out, b/c he shares the spotlight \nwith his minority castmates and the message appears positive without being \npatronizing or cliche.
