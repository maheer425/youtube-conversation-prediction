Are we really going to go that far...? I'll dumb it down for \nyou. Da MIlitureh DOZent MAke R TechNawlUgy. And yes, those things do make \nyou lazy. But if you're watching TV at all, then you're being lazy. And I \nnever, EVER, said being lazy was a bad thing. If you remember what items \nare in the video, you know what items make you extra lazy. Remotes and such \nwere built so that things wouldn't be a hassle when you're going through \nchannels. I know of no human being who wants to manually press buttons to \nget from channel 146, to channel 1. Look at it this way. Some items make \nthings EASIER, other items are just unnecessary, and provide an alternative \nfor something that you're likely capable of doing, and were built for \npeople who are NOT capable for doing them. Let me provide a little \nsituation that will make it easier to understand. You could play a game \nthrough, and pass all the obstacles, and prove that you can beat the game, \nor, you can be a complete ass, and hack your way to victory, without doing \na god damn thing to prove that you're actually worth challenging. Did that \nmake it easier? And no, that wasn't sarcasm. It's just like this situation, \nonly instead of a game, it's simple tasks, and instead of playing it \nthrough, it's doing something for yourself, and lastly, instead of hacking, \nit's using a motherfucking mess of bars to put a sock on your foot, and \nmany, many more. My point is, humans need to stop making silly little \ninventions to do things they are far too lazy to do. And obviously, you do \nnot see my point of view. I'm okay if *you* can't put a sock on your foot \nand need some bars to do so, you go ahead and do that. It's a miracle that \nwhenever people see me comment my opinion on a YouTube video, nearly 90% of \nthe people who read it feel they need to go against that, instead of using \nlogic to figure out my point of view.",

Also, saying that \neven the army uses technology is a kick to your own balls because most of \nthe technology we use today was created by and for the military. And again, \nas you seem not to listen, just because something is \"normal\" does not mean \nthose using it are not \"lazy\". I assume you use a TV remote because you are \ntoo lazy to turn the channel manually on the TV. I assume you are lazy \nbecause you drive or ride public transport instead of walking. LAZY! Oh \nwait, no. You don't consider people who use remotes or use vehicles as \nbeing lazy because it has become normal. That doesn't change the fact that, \nby definition, using them makes you lazy. Why don't you get that through \nyour thick skull? And what is wrong with being lazy? Being lazy advances \ncivilization.

If you can honestly go your \nwhole life without using technology, you sure are a trooper. Oh, wait, \nthat's right, even the army uses technology. And for the 100th time(Let's \nhave a party!)

Then it magically becomes normal and not \nlazy? Not to mention the simple fact that most of the items in the video \nare made FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES and people who are able to complete \nthe action without help do not buy these things. Sure, there are a few \nthings that would be cool to have, like the tipping teapot (if I drank tea \nor coffee). For me, I wouldn't want it because it makes pouring easier, I \nwould want it just because it is cool. But think about people with weak \narms or joint issues. It would be a great thing for them to have.",

Most products that \nare being used in the world are not actually needed. Still, it is used by \nmost of the people in the world. I also do not need to see your house in \norder to figure out that you probably have about 98% of things that you do \nnot need. Your comment said that if you seen someone using these products, \nyou will \"beat the fucking hell outta them.\" No matter if they are \nhandicapped or not, it was still ignorant of you to say such a thing. I \nused the comment about the internet because it is a way for you to look up \nthings easier when you could read a book to do research instead. (or i \ncould even say for you to do the research yourself without reading what \nsomeone else figured out.) If you want entertainment, go out and see the \nworld. Look out the window and enjoy nature as entrainment. Draw what you \nsee. Sing, dance. Instead, you are being LAZY and are messing around \nonline. You trying to switch the roles out on me by mentioning that i am on \nthe internet as well would not actually help you in anyway. I was simply \nstating that who cares if people buy any of these products in the video. \nWhy should anyone get a beating from someone like you? You should receive a \nbeating as well since you are not actually handicapped enough to look \nthrough a book and do research. You do not need the internet. Which means \nyou are extremely lazy and have no right to talk about how lazy people are \nif they get any of the products in the video. People say that i am hard to \nunderstand. Sorry if my words are taken the wrong way. The bottom line is, \nyou are lazy and should not act as if you should beat someone up because \nthey dont feel like spinning a stupid bottle. My comments are only based \noff of one your lines that stated you would beat someone up for \"being \nlazy\". I just think you should have more respect for people since you \nyourself are not exactly working hard get what you want in life.",

Can \nsay that i wish i had a portable microwave to heat my lunch when im dozens \nof miles out of town.\nTwirling Spaghetti Fork- Another gimmick for kids.\nUrinal Robot- Obviously a joke.\nSock Buddy- People that have arthritis, are over weight, have flexibility \nproblems. There are tons of NON lazy people that could make great use out \nof this.\nABhancer- Ill give that one to you. Either a gag gift. Or just pure lazy.\nAutomatic Teapot- So... People with one arm are lazy now?\nSelf-Making Bed- Older people, people missing an arm, people in a \nwheelchair.\nSelf-Scooping Litter Box- I wish i had one of these for my cat when i go \nout of town for days at a time.\nPooTrap- Yeah ill give that one to you.\nLazy Reading Glasses- Less lazy, more \"I dont want to hold up a book for \nthree hours.\" That would make anyone, lazy or not, have sore arms.\nSnowball Scooper- This is less lazy, more efficient. I \"can\" screw in a \nPhillips head screw with my fingers. But i think i would rather use a \nscrewdriver.\nCordless Scissors- I can say that yes. Scissors are just as easy... If you \ndont have a job that requires you to use them for 8+ hours a day. This goes \nback to when i was a construction worker. When putting metal sheets on a \nhouse, i \"Could\" use a screwdriver. But it was MUCH faster with a power \ndrill with a screwdriver head.\nHands-Free Whopper Holder- A \"Promotion\".... Let me say that again \nPROMOTION. Toys in mcdonalds happy meals are promotions. This thing is \nimpractical and stupid. There is NO one that actually uses it daily.\nAnd last but not least...\nToilet Paper Extender- Not lazy. Like you said. If you have bad arthritis \nthen this would be handy if the paper roll is further away. Or if you are \ntoo overweight. Or if your bathroom was just plain designed wrong.\n\nThats my input. Like me, hate me. Up to you. Im just giving my opinion.\ufeff",

Sorry but if your are just sneezing from \nchanging the litter you might actually be allergic to the litter and not \nthe cat. Try a different type. A true allergy will be there all the time.",

Well, the good news is that you can make a buck in America \nselling gizmo's. Viva Capitalism! Second, where are those good ol' days \nwhen rugs were dragged out to a tree trunk or line and beaten until dust \nfree by hand? And what about hand washing all your clothes (scrub boards \nare wonderful). They'll come out cleaner than machines (ask the Chinese \nlaunderers). Lots of fun time bonding with the family when you have enough \nlaundry to choke a horse. Look how lazy people have become since they have \ndishwashers and no longer spend an hour cleaning up the kitchen after \ndinner? Frankly, I hate cooking with electricity or gas. I get my ax out, \nchop some wood, start a fire the old fashioned labor intensive way (rubbing \nthe stick with the wood), then getting out the cast iron. I don't eat what \nI didn't grow or shoot myself, cleaning and dressing, butchering and drying \nit out or cold room. I like making my own wax candles for light at night. \nAnd them infernal automobiles?! Got feet? Start peddling, or better, start \nwalking.  Let's face it, we have been making life easier since the \ninvention of fire and the wheel. Laziness goes back thousands of years. For \nall those truly opposed to our lazy lifestyles (if you think about all the \ngadgets you rely on everyday, then we all need to try to live the \"carbon \nfootprint free\" life and we'll all be in shape in less than a year \nguaranteed.",
