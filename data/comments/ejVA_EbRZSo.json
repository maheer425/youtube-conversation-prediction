A good Loki builds cooldown and penetration, and he can \ninstakill you if you don't use aegis as soon as he ults you. If you can \ntime his ultimate, you can mitigate 75% of his damage straight away. The \nproblem is afterwards. With maximum cooldown reduction he can go back and \nfight you after 5 seconds, but don't let him. As soon as he engages, engage \ntoo. Use your cc to block his movement and damage, and just burst him down. \nA good Loki will won't try and kil you if he's not sure he's survive (the \nsacred stacks tho').",

                "text": "I play anhur myself, and I assure you that doing the pillar/impale combo is \ninsanely difficult, because your opponent will normally have enough sense \nto move to the side if you do somehow manage to get the pillar behind him, \nand doing that with a moving target is nigh impossible, and you have to put \nyourself well into range of your opponent's abilities in order to get the \npillar behind them. Aka, your opponent can hit you with his abilities right \nbefore you get into range to put a pillar BEHIND them. Also, desert fury \nisnt all that great when chasing since it DOES apply the speed debuff you \nget from attacking or using any ability. Though now that I think about it, \nsprint would probably fix this. Also, the impale is great for \nchain-stunning, since if your opponent is immobilized already you can \neasily pin them to a wall to keep them stunned longer. I do this alot, and \nits not that hard. Oh, and you can use the impale to defend yourself too \nsince it pushes the opponent back a pretty good distance, even if it \ndoesn't stun them it will put plenty of distance between you and him.\ufeff",

If you catch her with no abilities: she's screwed. If you can root \nor stun her, she's screwed. Scylla relies on the abilities more than most \nto do damage and it really hurts her when she's on cooldown.\nThe best way I've found to deal with her ult is to literally go up and hug \nher and run around her, like with anubis, she has a hard time aiming it on \ntight turns so you can burn her out with that. This idea of running towards \nan enemy can also work for things like Janus' 2 to try and catch you as you \nretreat and stops the 2 1 combo which drains your health like a truck!\nScylla also gets nasty with her passive of quick learner where her \nabilities gain additional effects at max rank. Her 1 alone can root up to 3 \n(I think don't quote on this) gods at once. Couple in her slow, a few basic \nattqcks and her ult and bang: one triple kill.\nIf fighting her, expect her ability rotation to start mostly with her 2 as \nthis can group up minions and if it catches a player in it, she can \ndetonate it instantly for a sizable chunk of damage. If Scylla is chasing \nyou, she'll aim to get very close with her 3 then root you with her 1. \nRemember this 3 can go through walls and will act as a temporary ward so \nshe will know where you are hiding!\nAgain, if you see Zoey appear in front of you, it can be worth trying to \nrun the other way when she beings to 'dash' animation.\nAs for ways of dealing with the slows and root, Winged Blade is fantastic \nas this gi es you a 20% INCREASE to speed when slowed and health and \ncooldown reductions and movement speed (it's a dang good item!) so grabbing \nthis can help you more than you think! Scylla is THE definition of glass \ncannon in this game. Expect to see her in mid lane with a tiny trinket and \nVampiric Shroud 8/10 times during the opening with her 2 as her 1st \nability. With that, try to stay to the side of the lane so that she either \nfocuses you or the minions. Going side by side with the minions just means \nshe gets the most value out of her 2 and you don't want that! \nHope this helps!\ufeff",
