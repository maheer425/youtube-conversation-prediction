With interviews and also \nthe way he approaches fights now (also losses & injuries maybe). Props to \nthe man, as I hear he does loads of free coaching and pays for other \nfighters in some of the smaller gyms he goes to that struggle.\nTop man!!!\nHow can you not be cool though with a Dutch coach...premium greenery all \nyear round!!!\nI'm surprised the Diaz brothers aren't on that train!?!?!?
