Because if you say that a \nwave is an entity, and you can draw how a wave looks, that means that a \nwave is made up of particles since the wave itself can't be a particle. \nIt's strange how people compare light as a Particle and a Wave, since the \nwhole universe is made out of particles that are visualized as balls. So \nhow can you compare a Particle and a Wave ( which is possible either a \nmetaphore that people choose to believe, or is a set of particles that form \na wave in space).\ufeff",

This light is now known as the Cosmic Microwave Background \nRadiation, or CMBR for short. The CMBR is all of the light from the very \nearly universe stretched into the microwave wavelength, and I assume the \nsame would happen to the last wave of light in the universe. It would be \nstretched beyond the visible spectrum, and there would just be a sea of \ninvisible wave lengths scattered across the universe, sort of like a CMBR, \nbut in the far far future. Asking how many colours there are seems a bit \nredundant. Its like asking how many lengths of waves can you have between 1 \nand 2 meters apart. There are an infinite number between those two points \nwe know as the visible spectrum. The light is organised from blue being the \nshortest wavelength to red being the longest. And colour doesn't repeat \nlike a colour wheel. Beyond red, there is infra red, and microwave and so \nforth, and beyond blue is ultraviolet and gamma rays. The visible spectrum \nis organized from Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red, and \neverything in-between. A Google search of \"light spectrum\" in images will \nprobably demonstrate this better than words can. Hope this helps!",
