It \nis not sadness.\n\nNow, as to why people cut themselves, and I did too, is simple...sort of. \nYou see, pleasure nerves are very closely linked with pain nerves, and \nseeing as depressed people feel like they \"can't feel\" things anymore, they \njust want to regain that part of themselves, to feel. All of us feel pain, \neven while depressed, even when pleasure is harder to achieve, so cutting \nourselves is an \"easy\" way to feel \"alive\". It may also be an unconscious \ncry for help. If you know someone who does this, they need help. \nImmediately. And if you mock them you may be partially responsible for \ntheir possible death.\n\nThere's much more to it but I'll stop where my research stopped.",

We are desensitised. \nDepressed people tend to, as was said in an earlier comment, LACK emotion, \nnot, as many believe, have bad emotions. Those only come later.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: depression is characterised by a loss of \nmental faculties that LEADS to a feeling of worthlessness and sadness, not \nthe other way around. This cycle often last months or even years. No one is \ndepressed for a few days, it is a long-lasting mental condition.",

I am in my \nearly twenties, by the way.\n\nYou are 100% right when you say that depression is a mental problem, not \njust emotional, and that associating depression with just sadness is \ncompletely missing the point. From my personal experience of 7 years of \nintermittent depression, and the research I have done, I can tell you how \nit works, at least how it worked for me:\n\n1) At first you start to feel a bit more tired than usual. Everyone gets \ntired sometimes so you disregard this as anything serious and carry on.\n2) You don't want to work as much anymore. Things that you were able to do \npreviously in whatever line of work you're in become more tiring, even \nthough there should be no reason for the change.\n3) Because of this, you start to work less, simply because you just can't \ndo it. I took refuge in masturbation and video games for a great part of my \nlate teen years, and many other males do as well. If not that, then some \nother activity that deprives you of real human contact in favor of lonely \npleasures.\n4) You're getting worse now, and now view social outgoings as chores, as \nexhausting routines you drag yourself to. This is even more blatant if \nyou're an introvert.\n5) Now you may begin to suspect something's wrong. But you never tell \nanyone you're depressed, only that you're tired. Particularly if you're a \nmale.\n6) You're always tired, and you sleep for 10, 12, sometimes even 16 hours a \nday. You can't get any work done. The moment you start to work, or read, \nyou become exhausted beyond hope, and go to sleep. The times you actually \nstick to it you end up procrastinating or, in extreme cases (like it \nhappened to me), passing out from exhaustion.\n7) You begin to feel worthless. Why? Several reasons: you can't work, so \nyou can't contribute - you're worthless to society. All you do is sleep, \nbecause the dream world is better than this, and you don't have to work. \nYou take refuge in lonely activities and disregard your friends - you \nbecome worthless to your loved ones, or so you firmly believe by this \npoint. The world is moving at regular speed while you are operating on a \nnumbed brain, so everything and everyone seems to be doing better than you. \nYou feel worthless.\n\nThis cycle starts very subtly and lasts months, sometimes even years.",

The term \"depression\" has \nbeen greatly generalized by society to mean some great sadness, when it is \nactually much more than that. Sadness is an emotion, and depression is a \none in a group of mental disorders. The mind is very complicated and \ncertain parts of the brain differ greatly across individuals. As depression \nis a general term for many kinds of disorders and because of the above \nstatements, depression cannot simply be generalized. It varies *GREATLY* \nacross individuals to the point that a definition so simple as \"sadness\" \njust doesn't apply. Many depressed people feel sad, I'm not denying that. \nBut other people who are depressed do not necessarily feel sad. It affects \na broad range of emotions, including loss of interest/enthusiasm/feeling, \nsuicidal thoughts/actions, stress, and of course sadness. It could affect \nany of those emotions but not necessarily all of them, depending on how the \nindividual's mind functions/is structured.\n\nI mean this whole argument on the large scale is really at a stalemate \nanyways, because the mind is so complex that we don't fully understand how \ndepressions work. We're all kind of trying to grasp at straws and make \nassumptions that we're right when, collectively, we humans do not fully \nunderstand the disorder. It's hard to make reasonable conclusions about \nwhat's right when we don't fully understand it.",

It is not \nobviously blatantly misguided from what I can tell... it just generalizes a \nbit too much by giving definite reasons for (some) people cutting when it's \nall about the individual's reasons. I think that he was still right in \nsaying that depression isn't all about sadness (although I guess it still \nvaries by individual).\n\nAlthough Wikipedia is quite a bad source, Dictionaries aren't very good \nsources either. They tend to reflect the ideas and possible \nmisunderstandings of society, sometimes including \"half-baked\" definitions \nthat don't quite capture the full meaning of the word. Take the word \n\"depression\" even, it's first (and thus the \"best\"/most relevant definition \nfor most people) is \"a state of feeling sad\" when depression is clearly \nmore than that. Another example of society's heavy influence on \ndictionaries is \"twerk\" and other pseudo-words added to some dictionaries.\n\nWikipedia is even worse, I know. Even though both sources are probably \ninspected by very many people to the point that most errors quite quickly, \nthey are still not very good sources\n\nI gotta admit though, you outmatched me in this argument :P Also, sorry for \nmisunderstanding you :/",

But why are they not \neasily bored? i propose a suggestion that, as said in the video, the child \nhad a schema of pleasure.\n\nThe kid knows playing the 1st stage of angry birds makes him happy, now 1st \nstage of angry birds equals happiness. The other may not be happiness, \nincluding different stages.\n\nOf course, until the kid learns to accommodate new experiences related to \nwhat makes him happy. At this point angry birds will be boring for the \nchild.\n\nPlease do decently argue with this comment, this topic interests me.\n\nPS : The premise i had made makes me wonder, how happy a man could be he \ndidn't have psychological accommodation.
