OCD is repeated behavior that disrupts the average life of the \nsufferer, such as a need to wash their hands exactly 29 times (Which can \ncause them to be late to events, or even begin bleeding as they scrub their \nhands harshly).",

OCD is the mental illness with the most \nmisconceptions about it. \n\nLearn more about OCD In Rhett and Lincs video on good mythical morning \nabout OCD, and another one I recommend is on crash course psychology about \nOCD and generalized anxiety disorders.\n\nI have been prescribed OCD by a trained phycologist and attend therapy, \nhave studied the disorder, and can say positively I know I good deal about \nthe illness\n\nBy what you have described, you do not sound like you have the disorder. \nOCD is characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts. This may mean \nchecking things over and over again due to extreme anxiety. Here's how it \nworks out. \n\nThe O stands for obsessive. You have unwanted thoughts generally fears or \nphobias about something. For me, it is I am afraid of me and my family \nbeing brutally murdered as the worst obsession. Others fear becoming so \nsick they die, leaving on their house burner and the house burning down, \netc. these fears lead to the C\n\nC stands for compulsions. Compulsions are rituals that temporarily help \nextreme anxiety brought on by phobias. For me, I check the doors \nrepeatedly, sometimes hours at a time checking so that they are locked. I \nalways fear the worst, and eve though I know the doors are locked, I get so \nafraid I check again. The same is with washing hands, laundry, surfaces, \nchecking burners, etc to remove anxiety. \n\nThe D means disorders. As you can see, this is a very complex mental \ndisorder that effects millions of people, and the illness never goes away. \n\nThank you whoever read this, I wish to inform the people who don't \nunderstand sufferers and that this is much more than being orderly. I used \nto think OCD was just being orderly before I was prescribed. I know some \ndon't know better, but it still pains me to think people take this issue so \nlightly. \n\n\nThank you :)",

It very often has little to do with reason, such as organising \nshelves because they aren't in order. Almost all human beings show \nbehaviour like that to a degree, some more than others and it's this \ndifference along with social environments that has produced such \nself-diagnosis in this generation",

I also know this because I have studied psychology for over a \ndecade and understand that though they both involve a certain need and \ndemand of rigid expectations and there is disruption when that isn't met, \nthe reason for the need and demand is different. Also, the expected \nconsequences [from the individual with the need/demand] and the reality of \nthe consequences [both what actually happens as a result and the feelings \nand behaviors of the individual] tend to be very different. \n\nIt can be extremely frustration when people put forth misinformation- its \nnot only just frustrating because psychology is my 'thing' [see: special \ninterest and brains, neurology, abnormal psych, psychiatry, biology] but \nalso it can down the line be harmful.

Yeah, about this: \" If you actually had OCD, you \nprobably wouldn't be on the internet because there are so many idiots here \nthat spell things wrong and nothing is just-so.\"  About that idiots on the \ninternet thing... let's start with that. I have OCD. I have some pretty \nfucking nasty OCD. I am actually pretty vocal about it- you demonstrate a \nreally great reason why. Actually the majority of the comments in this \ncomment section do.\n\nPeople tend to be ignorant as hell about OCD. I'm not supposed to be on the \ninternet because typos will send me into a mental breakdown of epic \nproportions, and that is the assumption of all these morons WrITiNG liKe \nthIS, but then it doesn't occur to them that if I am someone with OCD who \nis triggered so easily maybe I actually control what I expose myself to. \nBecause I don't want to be driven crazy by idiots who are cruel and \nignorant about the true detrimental effect that kind of thing can have.\n\nSo all of you who are bitching and moaning about having OCD and how those \nstupidly typed comments are \"torture\", maybe think about how questionable \nyour complaints of agony are at this point. Either that, or if that's \nreally the case, consider taking more control of your life: you probably \nencounter typos galore on the internet- maybe be more discerning about \nwhere you spend your time so you can maintain some stability for yourself.\n\nBack to \"People with OCD aren't going to go around and tell everyone that \nthey have OCD, because they aren't proud of it.\"  I have to ask: do you \nhave OCD, +SaySay Lona ?  I talk about my OCD. People are not proud of \ntheir OCD symptoms, true. But when they find out it's OCD, and not some \npersonal horrible fault in themselves, the idea is to figure out how to \ndeal with it. Not be ashamed and hide. Some people don't talk about it. \n Kind of like some people with OCD are truly triggered by grammar errors \n[and maybe we should all understand what an actually trigger is, as opposed \nto \"annoyance\"]. Some people talk about it freely, some people are \nself-advocates. Some people don't buy into the whole \"I should be ashamed\" \nthing. Some people don't give two shits about grammar beyond the \"you seem \nlike a moron when you use text speak as though it is a legitimate dialect\" \nissue. \n\nI mean, in short: don't speak for me.",

                "text": "All of you fucking shitlords that think you have OCD because you might not \nlike un-even things and letters and stuff is so wrong. Sure, some people \nthat actually has OCD has it like that, but if you really need so much \nattention that you go on about having a disorder which is completely not \ntrue, go to a fucking whore house or something. So many of you do not see \nthe D in OCD, it stands for Disorder. And all of you other people that \nthink like \"Omg don't write that, people that actually has OCD will freak \nout\" just shut the hell up, you don't know shit. I've been dealing with \nthis shit for a long time now and it irritates me so fucking much when \npeople think they do have a disorder when they dislike un-even numbers, \nIt's probably in our nature! OCD isn't just with numbers, it's a lot more \nto it than that, a lot unexplainable stuff. I had/have to go in and out of \nmy door and it can take up to some hours because I have to have specific \nthoughts when I do it and all that stuff. Also, the worst part in which I \nwas hospitalized for was because of my extreme fear of germs. I wouldn't \neven swallow my own spit if I heard/saw people talking like 60 meters away. \nI would ONLY eat food from fabrics and no hand made stuff. I am 15, my \nweight is 35-36kg and I am around 1.60cm tall. Tkae a look at this:\n\nObsession \u2013 your mind is overwhelmed by a constant obsessive fear or \nconcern, such as the fear your house will be burgled.\n\nAnxiety \u2013 this obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety and distress.\n\nCompulsion \u2013 you adopt a pattern of compulsive behaviour to reduce your \nanxiety and distress, such as checking all your windows and doors are \nlocked at least three times\nbefore leaving the house.\n\nTemporary relief \u2013 the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief from \nanxiety but the obsession and anxiety soon return, causing the cycle to \nbegin again.\n\nThe hospital couldn't keep me in because they didn't know what to do with \nme, I was too \"bad\" for them to even try. I got sent home after 1 or 2 \ndays, I can't remember.\n\nI could go on for hours talking about all my compulsions and obsessions and \nall that shit, which probably takes up like 85/100 of my day. But I'd \nrather not as people will see that as \"bragging\" about my disorder.\n\nSo, please, think before you comment.\ufeff",

For example, if the floor is black and white, if I \nstep my whole right foot on the black part, I'll have to step my whole left \nfoot on a black part too otherwise one foot seems lighter (as in weight) \nand uneven. If I step half my right foot on black and the other half on \nwhite, I have to do the same exact thing with my left foot. It's like I \nkeep count how many steps I have had on each color in my head.",

You have no \ncontrol over any of these things and trying to hold them in just makes \nmatters worse. Thinking about it makes it happen more often too. It means i \ncant go to cinimas or anywhear that involves quite because i could just \nshout out a random word or scream all of a sudden. Not to mention walking \ndown stairs... Legs can swing back at any time! As you can imagine this \ncauses alot of people to laugh and judge you. I have known people who have \nswore at police officers (not on purpose as their tourrettes like i said \nmade them do a random word or movement, yes thats right tourrettes can make \nu give people the finger against your will) Anyway the police officers \narrest them force them down hancuff them ect even if they show them ID \nproving they have the disorder. The point is its not very well known and if \nyou want to learn more i sudgest you do some research, there are normaly \nalot of doccumenteries on tv about it, altough you will find that on those \ndoccumentries almost all of them will swear involentry, This leads people \nto thinking tourrettes just makes you swear.  And altough it does that to \nsome, it bugs me how people think thats all it is. Anyway even though i \nhave tourrettes i dont let it drag me down :) yea sure it stops me going to \nsome places and doing some things but people have it alot worse than me and \nif starving children, cancer victims, homless people ect can put up with \nthere things i can put up with mine.

Its not trying to be neat and tidy... its not acting like you \nalways need to correct someones bad internet grammar (most of you don't \neven correct any other type of grammar besides fucking contractions). Its \nthings like feeling so dirty all the time you need to clean your hands or \nsanitize them every moment you feel like something contaminated may have \ncome in contact with your hands. Another common behavior is having the need \nto count things to a common number or color, usually driven by \nsuperstitions regarding that number or color.

You're not proving anything by saying that you \nare OCD because you 'twitched' throughout the whole video. Don't say you're \nOCD unless you have been legitimately diagnosed by a doctor.\n\nFor God's sake, why does everyone want to have OCD, anyway? Do you feel \nsmarter when you say that you have it, because stereotypically OCD people \nare clean and neat? If so, it only accentuates your ignorance and your low \nself-esteem when you post these comments.\n\nPlease. Stop commenting lies for attention, unless you're looking for \nnegative attention from people who actually have OCD. My apologies if this \nsounded harsh, but these comments are getting on my nerves.\ufeff",

You \ndon't need to be insulted, because I trust you that you have something \ndestroying your life, and never said that you didnt, but the key word is \nsomething. I am starting to lose my faith in humanity because we are \narguing, believing that we are both correct, cause wanna know something \nbuddy, if you truly searched what OCPD is you would realize that it is a \ntype of OCD, and the most common kind. You need to stop acting like this \nillness of cleanliness is rare, because the type you have is not. Yes it \nraises your anxiety and you need to wash your hands, but when something \nlike being scared of food and not being able to eat, I guess I am \ncommitting suicide right now. I could pass out any minute and die of \nstarvation. I never said that you don't have something destroying your \nlife, and I'm not the one acting like a smartass around here, check \nyourself out. I was trying to end the argument, but obviously your like \nevery human on the internet, trying to argue to make others feel bad. I \nkinda thought you had some sort of heart, but I guess I was wrong. V_V \nthanks",

And my \nsmall understanding of OCD is basically a much more extreme version of \nthis, to the point where your motives are almost no longer voluntary. I see \na lot of the time on places, such as twitch or youtube, that there are \npeople that make comments such as \"you're driving my OCD crazy.\" As well as \nI see people that state from their own POV  and how real OCD effects their \nlife. I could honestly careless about the first group, that is pure \nignorance of the definition of OCD or just a attention magnet gig. What \ngets me is seeing people that critique the people that state they have been \ndiagnosed. In my opinion it is better to say 'I'm sorry for you' (which by \nthe way I am Paul) to someone that is faking rather than try to disprove \nsomeone who could potentially be in reality ruined by OCD. In all I \nhonestly wish for a lot of the fighting about whether or not they actually \nhave it to stop. I however am not approving people to jump around saying \nthey have been diagnosed when they haven't, as well as I think it is fine \nto critique if you are giving medical/mental advice or help to said person. \nAgain I don't have OCD and I don't plan on getting checked for one either. \nBut I will say this, those that don't have it be nice don't post hurtful \nbreakdowns of someone else's POV or attempt to fake it (for the huge amount \nof good things that absently rewards) and those who do shouldn't need to \nargue their position. The internet might be a huge place with a lot of mean \npeople but it doesn't hurt to make it slightly more friendly. :D",

OCD isn't just checking an unreasonable amount to make sure \neverything looks right, it can appear in many different ways, fear of \ngetting sick being one of them. OCD consists of an obsessive thought that \nwill recur and persist despite efforts to ignore them (the \"O\"). The \nobsessions require a compulsion to give relief and feeling of safety (The \n\"C\"). His obsession is germs, he cannot stop thinking about them even \nthough at many times it is probably very unreasonable. The compulsion that \nfollows is sanitizing, or avoiding things that aren't really contaminated \nalthough the brain makes it out to seem that way. From personal experience, \nI missed out on birthday parties, amusement parks, going out with friends, \nthere was even a point where I was so overwhelmed with thoughts of \ncontamination everywhere, that I locked myself in my room, and only got out \nto eat, and use the bathroom for 3 days at a time. And just because \nmedication doesn't work doesn't mean anything. Sometimes medication doesn't \nwork on some people, that doesn't mean he doesn't have it. Look at some \npeople like Howie Mandell (if I that's the right spelling of his name), he \nhas OCD surrounded around germs as well.

There are no laws against it, and you can even just buy a ton of \nb12 tablets from walmart.). Instead of getting an unnecessary prodding from \na stranger, I was just prescribed with anxiety medication because anxiety \nis really a large part behind OCD.

So the font thing may or may not bother someone with OCD but \nif it does you could literally be making them feel ill.\n\nIf you don't think it is a serious disorder then you haven't seen a person \nwith OCD before because it is both sad and disturbing.  Compulsive behavior \ncan lead to some really nasty injuries and even death (in the case of \nhoarding particularly).\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Dermatophagia.jpg\n\nThe causes are pretty interesting (numerous) but there is a link between \nOCD and traumatic brain injuries- like car crashes and strokes.\nhttp://www.ocduk.org/what-causes-ocd\nIn short it's a very REAL thing.  It's physical.\n\nIf you don't understand it do some reading instead of laughing.\nMental illnesses make your life SUCK.\ufeff",

I can tell none of you have ever had or known someone whose had \na mental disorder. It's terrible. It can ruin your life. I've had numerous \nmental disorders, and it's not one of those things that make you feel \nspecial and happy, it makes you feel alone and hated. Therapy isn't some \nwalk in the park either. It's 1-2 hours of intense mental pain while trying \nto face your worst fear. When people have phobias or disorders, the thing \nthat they're afraid of goes through the same part of your emotional, or \n\"animal\" brain that processes fatal encounters. Seeing things like what you \nguys are posting feels the *exact* same way to them as having a lion jump \nout of the bushes, and that feeling of pure fear you get because you know \nyou're going to die feels to you, if not worse. You *will* give them a \npanic attack. And for those of you who've never had a panic attack (which \nclearly none of you have) you feel all of these VERY intensely:\n-Shortness of breath or hyperventilation\n-Heart palpitations or a racing heart\n-Chest pain or discomfort\n-Trembling or shaking\n-Choking feeling or lack of oxygen\n-Feeling unreal or detached from your surroundings\n-Sweating\n-Claustrophobia or feeling of being trapped\n-Nausea or upset stomach\n-Feeling dizzy, light-headed, or faint\n-Numbness or tingling sensations\n-Hot or cold flashes\n-Feeling of dying, losing control, or going crazy from fear alone\nAnd it's terrible. I've never felt any physical pain that amounts to it. \nAnd I've been stung by a sting ray, jellyfish, and broken bones. And by \ndoing what you're doing, you're giving someone a panic attack. And it lasts \n10-30 minutes. And it's all your fault. So congratulations, I hope you all \nfeel proud of yourself. I hope that knowing that by ruining someone else \nday you've in some sick way made yours better. It's because of people like \nyou that we have to be ashamed of our disorders. People like you made me \nswitch schools because of how many people exploited my phobia. People like \nyou drive people like me to suicide. But none of you will even give your \ncomment a second though, let alone delete it. In fact, I bet none of you \neven had the decency to read this, but if you have, and you delete your \ncomment and never post one like that again, I totally and completely \nforgive you. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to do something about all \nthe people in these comments. And if I get just one person to delete their \ncomment, all the time I spent typing this will be 100% worth it. Thank you \nfor reading this.",

It basically means that somewhere in our \nbrains, a filter is missing, causing actions or events not to be processed \nas complete. This leads to an OBSESSION (that is actually strong enough to \nwarrant all-caps) with the action or event. In order to cope with the \nobsession, we have compulsions, which can range from organizing to \nhand-washing to any number of things. The reason so many people with OCD \nact like it's a serious problem is because it is, at least in many cases, \nuncontrollable and far more severe. We hate OCD because it forces us into a \nlifestyle without choice. We are basically being held hostage by our own \nminds.",

Because if you touch something or someone that's \ncontaminated, the part that touched it is contaminated. Depending on how \n'badly' you think it's contaminated would measure your reaction. Along with \na panic attack, of course, you might want to do something as far as \namputate that body part or wash it for two hours straight with water so hot \nthat you wouldn't be able to feel your hand for days.\n\nI know this seems odd and foreign to you \u2013 and people with OCD know it, but \nthe thoughts don't go away. The thoughts can be so powerful that they \ncompletely override your pain threshold or even your survival instincts.\n\nThis was only an example of one form of OCD, and of course there are many \nmore, but this is probably one of my most personal",

OCD is having \nnagging thoughts or feelings or fixations (obsessions), which drive a \nbehavior (compulsions) to satisfy the conditions of or relieve anxiety \nregarding these obsessions. Namely, cleaning your hands or your personal \nbelongings dozens to HUNDREDS of times a day to make sure you aren't \ncontaminated. Or people who hoard things in obscene quantities. Or people \nwho quite literally operate on patterns. \n\nOCPD is a strict adherence to rules, need for perfectionism, cleanliness, \norganization, etc. But to the point where it essentially dominates your \nlife, not just a little quirk like people describe.

If \nI ever go to a store or to class or any other place where I know things I \nwill be touching have been touched by other people, I just wear a pair of \nthin gloves. Once you learn how to put on/take off gloves without having to \ntouch the surface of the gloves, your anxiety about contamination will \ndecrease--at least, mine did. The only problem I have now is the issue of \nwashing gloves since eventually dirt and dead germs/skin cells will \naccumulate on the surface of the gloves and on the interior. I found that \nspraying anti-germ liquids that have a lemon or bleach smell allows me to \nfeel better about my gloves being sanitary.",
