It \nwas mostly reconstructed by a guy named \"Ben Yahud\" (I think that's how \nit's spelled) and as was explained to me by a few Israelis, there are no \ncurse words in Hebrew. When Israelis want to curse they do so in \npredominately Arabic or Yiddish, or in the case of immigrants, their native \nlanguage (a LOT of Russians).

                    "text": "+MageSutek What I meant was that Elvish as the language it was supposed to \nbe has a limited and countable amount of (known) words, as it is not a \nlanguage used by absolutely existing people. Words created by a single mind \ncan be counted. There was at first only one word, after a year perhaps a \nthousand. I am developing an artificial language Dhelenoth, and I can count \nevery word there is precisely.\n\nA couple of years ago it was proven that languages do not develop in a \nsocial vacuum. I read an article about people found after having lived all \nor at least most their lives without contacts with other people. None of \nthem had the thing what is called language.\n\nSocial intercourse means using a language. What animals do when in contact \nwith one another, is also usage of language.\n\nThe reason I pointed out how your original comment couldn't be applied to \nElvish languages is that those Elvish languages are not spoken. Their \nvocabulary has come from exactly one head. What fans have created \nafterwards is not a part of the Elven languages. After all, the legendarium \nwas created by Mr Tolkien, not by his fans.\n\nThe number of words in a language is not countable. However, then we must \nsay that Elven languages are not languages. Because the number of words in \nElven languages can be precisely counted. Why? Because all the words there \nare exist on paper. New words cannot be found, because no person, who \nspeaks these languages, lives. Elves are imaginary, in the same way their \nusage of the language is. \n\nYes, I remember how you pointed out that 'dog' can be more than just one \nword. Well, when it comes to artificial languages, this number is clearly \nstated. If a certain word has more than one meaning, then it is mentioned, \nor otherwise no one can assume it has more than one meaning. For an \nexample, in Dhelenoth, the word 'narlan' is both the noun 'love' and the \ninfinitive 'to love'. Or to be more precise, Dhelenoth doesn't even have \ninfinitives, as all verbs are, without exception, either conjugated or \nreplaced with nouns, adjectives or adverbials. So I can say, quite clearly, \nthat 'narlan' is at most 2 words, and if I go on with this on every single \nword there is in Dhelenoth, I can tell the exact maximum of words in \nDhelenoth.\n\nOf course, it depends on our theory of the language, whether or not we \nagree that Dhelenoth has I infinitives, but the only correct way to \ninterpret the language is to say that there is none. Again, as Dhelenoth is \nan artificial language, whose existence is forced, the number of the words \ncan be counted.\n\nLike I said, I read from rather trustworthy source that the number of words \nin either Quenya or Sindarin is close to 600. No matter how these languages \nare studied, thousands is a lot bigger number than 600.\n\nPretty much in the same way I can say (truthfully) that the number of words \nin Dhelenoth is close to x. But if someone else says the number is 2-20 \ntimes bigger than it really is, then of course that someone is wrong.\n\nWe don't even need to go into linguistics to be able to say that thousands \nis a bit exaggerating, when the real number is close to 600. It's simply \npure mathematics, and you, nor I, can speak our way out of this apparent \nproblem. Because Elven languages were born in one head, and the number of \nwords that head invented can be counted rather easily.",

I \nwas only talking about English and how it relates to our understanding of \nword quantity in English, and by extension, every other language spoken on \nEarth. I would disagree to a large extent about languages being \"born\" of \nsocial intercourse. Human beings were using language long before they began \ninteracting with one another socially. You are basing your supposition on a \nstandard of thinking in linguistics called the \"discontinuity theory.\" I am \na \"continuity theorist,\" and always have been. I often use the example of \nanimals \"speaking\" to one another as a means of bolstering my claims. There \nis no right or wrong answer, but the two schools of thought are quite \nseparate. As far as you mentioning \"artificial languages,\" I cannot say I \nunderstand what you mean. Something is either a language or is not a \nlanguage. \"Structure,\" or what I assume you are referring to as morphology \nis not necessary for a language to be a language.\n\nI would disagree with your assertion that the number of words in a language \nis quantifiable. You may want to reread my post. I think my thesis was \nfairly clear. We can, at best, guess at how many words there are in any \ngiven language. This is something that humanity has been struggling with \nsince the first lexicographers attempted to quantify the body of language. \nIt is an ever-expanding phenomenon, and therefore, it is really quite \nimpossible to determine how many words count at the end when everything has \nbeen said and done. Language is in a constant state of flux. With respect \nto Elvish, as I mentioned in my first post, I cannot speak to the nuances \nof the language itself, but I will say that as long as there are people \nadding words to the language, it continues to expand, and is therefore not \nquantifiable. I would count the words being developed by \"fans.\" Certainly \nthe Tolkien family has. Who are we to impose? As long as people are \ncontinuing the evolution of Tolkien's work, his languages will continue to \nevolve and change.\n\nJust because Tolkien is dead does not mean his languages died with him. If \nwe were to dismiss evolutionary linguistics on account of someone dying, we \nwould not have a modern English to speak of; Shakespeare, Chaucer, \nBeowulf's writer, and the Earth's most primitive cavemen all have legacies: \ntheir contribution to language as we know it today. If we stuck with the \npremise that since Shakespeare and Chaucer are no longer writing, and \neverything subsequent is null because it not in their hand, we would never \nhave evolved out of Old English.",

Artificial \nlanguages are born, well, artificially, and thus also the structure is very \ndifferent.\n\nI must say that Tolkien did great work as a linguist, since he actually \nmanaged to create different dialects and versions of languages. But the \nnumber of words is still something that can be counted very precisely. \nWell, the number of known words. If my memory serves me right, it was \nChristopher Tolkien who mentioned the number 600 in some text (I am not \ncompletely sure, but the source seemed rather trustworthy, and it is a fact \nthat the Elvish languages do not have enough words to be used in real \nsocial intercourse)\n\nIf 600 is a rather precise number of know words in either Quenya or \nSindarin (don't really remember which one had more words, they were the two \nmost developed languages), then thousands of words in a single Elvish \nlanguage, be it Quenya, Sindarin or the dialect used by teleri who lived on \nthe shores of Aman.\n\nI agree that you can't tell the number of words in English. But you can \ntell the number of words in a language that is not born but forced into \nbeing.\n\nOf course, we can go a bit pseudo and start to think about the words added \nby fans...

Latin words \nused in law, French words used in cooking, German words used in academic \nwriting, Japanese words used in martial arts? Do you count Scots dialect? \nTeenage slang?

To \nthis may be added around 9,500 derivative words included as sub-entries. \nOver half of these words are nouns, about a quarter adjectives, and about a \nseventh verbs; the rest is made up of exclamations, conjunctions, \nprepositions, suffixes, et cetera. And these figures do not take into \naccount entries with senses for different word classes (such as nouns and \nadjectives).\n\nThis suggests that there are, at the very least, a quarter of a million \ndistinct English words, excluding inflections, and words from technical and \nregional vocabulary not covered by the OED, or words not yet added to the \npublished dictionary, of which perhaps 20 per cent are no longer in current \nuse.

One argument that I found myself \nagreeing with is that English, While not being Indian, provides a basic and \nequally advantageous link language for all Indian People while they can \nmaintain their own local languages rather than one gaining dominance as \nHindi may be doing. That's what many constructed languages are made for, \nbut they are also made as a form of artistic expression or merely to test \nhypotheses about how languages and the human mind works. It is useful in \nproviding factors that don't  occur naturally in living languages or even \nto help resurrect dead ones. I wasn't propping up Constructed \nlanguages before but I am now. It is a useful and perfectly human pursuit I \ndon't think they should come at the expense of other languages but I don't \nthink they do. ",

But in the game, the language is practically \ndead, no one outside of the Greybeards speaks it, so the Dovakhiin would \nhave no reason to learn it unless he were to spend the rest of his days as \na Greybeard. That's why they never created a structure for the language, \nbecause you never use it outside of a Shout.\nSo in my opinion, it is a language, there is just no structure that allows \nyou to use it in everyday communication.\nBut I'll be damned if I can't use it (as a language) in a normal \nconversation!\n\nAlthough it would be cool if they had created a structure for it and that \nyou could actually learn it.",
