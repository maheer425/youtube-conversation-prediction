Sir, God is not mocked.\n\nPsalm 137, if you read it from the beginning deals with God\u00b4s retribution \nto those that through out history have consistently persecuted and murdered \nGod\u00b4s people, so i believe that it deals with the end times described in \nthe Book of Revelation.\n\nThe LORD of the Scripture has wiped out the whole world with the flood, \nthat includes men, women, elders and children, but read the whole chapter \nof Genesis chpt 6.\nGod is the author of life, the Creator. What you forget is that the LORD of \nthe Scripture is not a teddy bear in the sky, he is a Righterous, Holy and \nPerfect God, God is merciful and graceful as well but do never reduce the \nHoliness of God to nothing.\n\nNow, do you hate the satanic murder of millions of innocent babies in the \nwombs of selfish progenitors called abortion? I hope you do.\n\nYou say \"judging is wrong\" but the Word of God describes two kinds of \njudging; 1) Hypocrite, based on personal \"standards\" and on appearance, \nthat\u00b4s sin 2) Righterous judgment not based on self but on the Word of God \nwith the best interest of the other in mind.\n\nNow, according to your own standard, are you judging the LORD? The Bible? \nMe? Hypocrisy perhaprs?\n\nWhy don\u00b4t you repent of your sins, believe on the Gospel and be saved? Why \ndoesn\u00b4t Ellen do the same? Christ died for all men that men should not \nreceive what they deserve, Hell, and then the Lake of Fire, Christ offers \nmercy and grace, and imputes his righterousness on all that believe on him.\nMost will sadly reject him.\nIf someone ends up in Hell that person has only himself/ herself to blame.\n\nHave a nice day sir.",

As above, do you feel it is RIGHT to murder \nchildren? No? Well, then why does the Bible tell you so? I think I can \nsafely assume, that you do not go around murdering children. Nor do you \nwish for others to be mauled by bears because they're making fun of you.\nTaking anything like these citations serious is outdated, ridiculous and \nshows a surprising lack of individual thought. If you had an ounce of \ncommon sense you would realize that whatever judgement you pass on others \ndoes not further your cause in \"the eyes of God\" (since it is also stated \nin the Bible, that you shall suffer in silence and wait for God to \nsmite/whatever those who do not abide by the laws of God).\nPlease grow a brain and find a proper forum to spread your biases, they are \nunwanted in the civilized world.

I liked it (of course: is it even \nlegal to dislike a movie with THAT cast?!) but I do not think it is the \nsame character that Leto plays in DBC, I'll tell you why. Hoffman's \ncharacter was played as a drag queen, even if he repeats all of the time he \nwants to become a woman; but he doesn't act and think as a woman. The way \nhe is dressed up is wrong. It is the way straight people think gay: \nexcessive. But a transexual is not gay nor a transvestite. Instead, Rayon \nis a woman. The detail of her outfits are moving. She wears short pink \nsocks when she wears a pink sweater. She has a pois scarf to go with her \nbag. This kind of things... A woman trapped in a male body, that's the \nthing I have heard less discussed about DBC and that, to me, was the most \nsignificant. For the entire time they speak to Rayon in male gender: he, \nhim. It's never \"she\". Today, it would be really gross to do that.  I \nseriously studied the entire process a transgender goes through - I thought \nI knew everything, but I didn't. Rayon is the first character I ever saw on \nscreen that really portrays a male to female transgender. All the rest are \nstereotyped (of course, I refer to the movie I saw, not saying there  are \nno other, and again of course, Boys don't cry is a magnificent example of \nthe opposite transition). I really loved that part of his performance, it \nrequires a great intelligence.\nMaybe, 15 years ago it was to early to tell the people, \"hey, look, a \ntransgender is not a queer strange bizarre thing, it can be a beautiful \nwoman/man and you could never guess they were born different\". Hollywood \nnever really provokes, it only gives the public what they are yet ready to \nhear. \nSaid that, I can't sleep at night thinking that Di Caprio never won an \nOscar. ",

Swim \nacross the fucking ocean? They are trying to minimize the use of fuels but \nthey have to travel using planes because it's their work. + When 30 Seconds \nTo Mars tours across the U.S, they are using fry power (economical diesel \nfuel). Another thing is, Jared him self was one of the first people from \nthe music industry to warn people about global warming. All the money \nbought of the single/music video went to a enviromental charity and it was \nfilmed in an entirely environmentally friendly character, so they did not \nuse much pollution.The video it self was showing what the pollution is \ndoing to the world in places like where they filmed (Arctic circle) and \nthey also shown their emotions towards that topic. There are far more \nthings that the boys did, but before you start saying that the artists are \nfull of crap, do your self a favour, research some facts and then share \nyour opinion. ",

Don't get me \nwrong, is a good movie and there are definitely some unsettling, scary \nmoments, but it didn't hit me the way Requiem did. Requiem was just \nso...horribly depressing. The acting from the cast made the characters so \nreal, and seeing them spiral farther and farther down was so much harder \nfor me to watch. Especially Ellen Burstyn's performance. She was so \nheartbreaking, and Jared too, of course. I think both films are the best, \nregarding all the others depicting drug addiction. (Same with Basketball \nDiaries...which reminds me: WHEN WILL LEO WIN THAT OSCAR, GODDAMMIT!)\n\nI'm digressing. Anyways, Trainspotting made me uncomfortable, Requiem made \nme sob my eyes out. Any movie that can evoke such a reaction in me (and \nothers) is great in my book, shows that the message came across. It's \npretty useful, too. If parents don't want their kids to do drugs, just show \nthem this movie. Shit, it freaked me out enough to never want do anything \nworse than pot or alcohol. ",

It definitely scared me out of \never doing heroine. Regardless on my feeling towards the film, Jared Leto \nwas spectacular in Requiem. ",
