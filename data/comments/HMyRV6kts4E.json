His younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg, was the \nbusiness manager. The hospital stressed healthful living and kept its \npatients on a diet that eliminated caffeine, meat, alcohol, and tobacco. \nThe brothers invented many foods that were made from grains, including a \ncoffee substitute and a type of granola, which they forced through rollers \nand rolled into long sheets of dough. One day, after cooking some wheat, \nthe men were called away. When they finally returned, the wheat had become \nstale. They decided to force the tempered grain through the rollers anyway.\n\nSurprisingly, the grain did not come out in long sheets of dough. Instead \neach wheat berry was flattened and came out as a thin flake. The brothers \nbaked the flakes and were delighted with their new invention. They realized \nthey had discovered a new and delicious cereal, but they had no way of \nknowing they had accidentally invented a whole new industry. Will Keith \nKellogg eventually opened his own cereal business, and its most famous \nproduct is still sold today:\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1906 that Kellogg\u2019s\u00ae Corn Flakes were made available to the \ngeneral public. In 1909, the very first cereal premium was offered: The \nFunny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet available with the purchase of 2 \npackages. The offer was available for twenty-three years!\nT",

Yes, a pizza will not be crisp like one \nmade in an oven because the air around the pizza is not hot and the process \ntakes less time, so less water evaporates. However, a microwave oven \ndoesn't destroy nutrients or something like that, the wavelength is not \nnearly short enough to be ionizing.

A college \nlecturer was taking a class in toffee making when the temperature of the \nconcoction was not taken high enough. The end product was called \u2018fudge', \nwhich is why the term \u2018fudge\u2019 is used to indicate a mistake or error.\"",

                    "text": "+ZyrtorkDragon Although this is a common myth, Coca-Cola was invented quite \ndeliberately. The myth states that Coca-Cola syrup was originally intended \nto be mixed with tap water or flat water, but it was accidentally mixed \nwith carbonated water, instead. The inventors of Coca-Cola knew exactly \nwhat they were doing every step of the way, and other carbonated beverages \nwere already being sold years before, including Hires Root Beer and Dr. \nPepper. Coca-Cola was invented by Dr. John Pemberton. In 1886, he began \nworking on the formula for his beverage. He would then conduct taste tests \nat a nearby soda fountain a few blocks from the workshop in his basement. \nThe soda fountain was owned by Willis Venable. The legend states that \nduring the final taste test, Venable accidentally mixed the syrup with \ncarbonated water instead of flat water, and Coke was born. The fact of the \nmatter is that Pemberton had always planned to use carbonated water. The \ndrink was made with a measured pump of syrup in the bottom of a glass over \nwhich cold carbonated water was spritzed. A very specific reason also \nexisted as to why Pemberton was inventing a new drink. You see, he was \nalready in the beverage business, selling his French Wine Coca, a wine \ntinctured with coca compounds. Coca is a raw plant product from South \nAmerica. It is best known as the source of cocaine. In 1885, Fulton County, \nincluding Atlanta, passed a law that alcoholic beverages could no longer be \nsold. This meant Pemberton had to create a new formula for his drink that \ndidn\u2019t use wine. The taste of his coca preparation and the taste of one of \nthe primary ingredients, kola, were not well suited on their own. Various \nother ingredients and lots of sugar were added to make it more palatable. \nCarbonated water was added because other carbonated drinks were becoming \nvery popular at the time. Despite documented proof that Coca-Cola was \ndeliberately carbonated, the myth continues to live. It doesn\u2019t help that \nmany prominent publications have fallen victim to believing this falsity, \nincluding Consumer Reports, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the World \nAlmanac of Inventions.
