I thought they were great! \nSure, they weren't exactly the same as the books but that's a good thing! \nIf you want to see a 12-year-old kid do all the kick-ass stuff that Logan \nLerman did in the movies, go ahead, but I wouldn't find it at all \nbelievable. It's realistic in the books because we can't see Percy and \ntherefore forget he's so young. And also, they can't possibly fit \neverything that happens in the books into the movies. So cool it. :)",

Yes it's about cancer but the whole story is \nabout how life can still be good and have meaning and beautiful and worth \nit, even if it's not a long life. It's about love and friendship in \ndifficult times. And it's a positive view on life, even with a disease. I \nlost a good friend of mine when we were 17 because of cancer and untill the \nvery end, she was positive and didn't let the disease stop her from living \nher live, even though it was a different and shorter one. In my opinion, \nthis movie has that same message. So I would encourage you to watch it, if \nyou want to.",

Even though the dialogues are unusual the story seems \nreal and you might even think John Green has cancer. And I think nobody \nwill like a book about cancer with characters saying words  like \"Hey\", \n\"sup\", \"im gonna die\", \"ily\" and \"OMFG\".  But I think your idea is really \ninteresting.

Gus lost his leg because of cancer. \nReally everything is based around them having cancer, not just their love; \nwhich it also is. The events that occurred in the end were because of \ncancer.

People \ntell me that I'm not supporting cancer patients --- I do.  If anything, \nmost of my dislike towards this book is because of how poorly it represents \npeople with cancer.  Maybe not even poor representation so much as cancer \nwas shoved in the backseat for poorly-chemistrated romance to take the \nfront stage.\n\nAnd before anyone starts telling me that I've never had cancer and have no \nright to judge, let me just say that I've had a close aunt have cancer and \nit's just as bad, watching someone in pain 24 hours a day and feeling \nabsolutely useless that you can't do anything.  \n\nI wasn't there to hold her hand when she died.\n\nAnyway, back to TFIOS.  Like I said, cancer took a backseat and was \nbasically just used as fuel for the romance.  The characters were \ninconsistent --- I couldn't really get a hold of Hazel's personality enough \nto get the vibe of cancer sympathy that I honestly did want to get.\n\nAugustus, or Gus, is one of the most unrealistic characters I've read in a \nmodern-setting novel thus far.  The things he says is completely \nunrealistic --- for example, on page 153, word for word: \"I'm in love with \nyou, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of \nsaying true things.  I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a \nshout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all \ndoomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned \nto dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, \nand I'm in love with you.\"\n\nSeriously?  No.  Sometimes they act like hormonal teenagers and sometimes \nlike million-year-old sages, and it's too much for me to read a book when I \ndon't know who the character actually is.  \n\nI didn't get the plot much either nor most of the characters.  Some, I \nfelt, were thrown in just because they had to.  What was the point of the \nbook in the first place?  I picked it up, read it, and gained practically \nnothing.",

I ended bursting out laughing because this one girl shouted 'That's so \nsad!\". Afterwards, the girls apparently decided to team up on me with their \nmoms and kept saying to me ,\"You have no heart\", \"You suck\", \"You're a \njerk!\" YADDA YADDA YADDA.

I can give you reasons.\n\nThe romance was poorly chemist rated, as if the characters were in love \nsimply because the author decided on it.\n\nThe characters' personalities weren't very consistent either, in my \nopinion.  Maybe it was just me, but I thought that there were too many \nchanges and shifts in how they acted.\n\nAnd maybe it's just me, but I don't like novels in which it's centered \npurely around romance.  There are exceptions, of course, which I thought \nThe Fault In Our Stars would be, but it didn't turn out to be.\n\nPerhaps it actually is a good book --- maybe I'm just too picky.  \n\nAh, the final sentences was to provide the basis in case a fan actually \nwanted to find out my reasons.  In that case, I would've given them reasons \nlike I gave you.  My reasons might be invalid, but they're reasons, at the \nvery least.\n\nSure, I want attention.  I'm not going to deny that.  It's in my nature --- \nI'm a very despicable person, if that wasn't already obvious.

I \nmean I know that it can't be 100% realistic because nothing is, and people \nwrite and read books to sometimes escape from reality you know? even if \nthere is a bit of reality in their. I personally love this book because \nit's just such a lovely story and a lot of people can relate to it. I don't \nmean a lot of people can relate to it because they may have had an illness \nor known people that have, even though these people could relate, \nobviously. People can also relate even if they're going through hard times \npersonally or have struggles in their life but may not be as drastic as a \nphysical terminal illness but still find the struggles just as hard. We do \nnot live in a perfect world and people will judge you and be mean an and \nthings won't go right and people who have illnesses and things like that \nobviously it's very hard for them. But the beauty about this book is that \nlife is life. No matter what you're going through you're still here. Even \nif it isn't for long, life is for everyone and it can be beautiful.",

Hell no! It's a book rather \nthan a biography. The way he strings together characters and adds those \nsuck punch lines that obviously would never happen realistically is his \nartwork. He's a fairly unique writer when it comes to his characters and \nimpeccable dialogue. You either embrace it, respect it or avoid wasting \nyour time with his books all together!",
