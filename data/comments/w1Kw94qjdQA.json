You'll learn about Igboland, a region in modern day Nigeria, \nprior to the arrival of the British Empire. Achebe tells the story of \nOkonkwo, an Igbo villager who has worked his way up from life as a \nsharecropped and become a respected leader in his community. Okonkwo has a \ntragic fall, and is exiled. And then the trouble starts. British \nmissionaries arrive, and change everything. Things Fall Apart has a lot to \nsay about colonization, and even something to say about decolonization.\n\nIf One Finger Brought Oil - Things Fall Apart part I: Crash Course \nLiterature 208\ufeff",

Sadly these days you don't get to be rich \nand powerful through your own hard work, you get it by making other people \nwork hard and taking the rewards. These days we have rich people getting \nprobation due to \"alfluenza\" or because \"prison would be hard on him\" while \nthe rest of us can get decades in jail for providing medicine to cancer \npatients.\n\nGetting ahead and having a successful life are two separate things. You can \nhave one without the other. Sometimes I think they're mutually exclusive \nbut I know there are exceptions. I'd rather have the latter than the former.",

I think you're right that people subscribing to half-truths or lies \nin fiction causes people to view humans in unrealistic ways.

Maybe to you personally, but not to \nseveral people such as myself. I still see fiction as being one of the most \nreliable ways to get people to think about and understand things that they \nwould never experience in their own lives because this goal in itself is \nvery unreachable. So, once we find a way of doing so without using fiction, \nmaybe we can steer away from such an unreliable source.",

You \nare still on the other side. You are still bringing your own experiences \nand internal thoughts to the table and are able to see if a character is \nbelievable as a human even if his/her world is unfamiliar.\n\nAll of it can be seen as very subjective but that is part of why people \nanalyze characters in fiction. It helps us to see how those around us \nbelieve humans act and think. And that, in turn, helps us to see how humans \nactually do act and think especially if the world and point-of-view is \nunfamiliar to us.\n\nThe claim that fictional books do not influence peoples' lives can be \ndisputed simply by the fact that people read fictional books. Also, stories \nand fiction have been one of the main ways that humans communicate abstract \nideas for as long as humans have been around. Stories can also be \nattributed to many influences in social life simply because it's one of the \nonly ways people gain ideas about areas of life that they are unable to \nexperience or see.

Each quarter \nretained its own Ogboni council of civilian leaders, along with an \nOlorogun, or council of military leaders, and in some cases its own elected \nObas or Baales. These independent councils elected their most capable \nmembers to join a federal civilian and military council that represented \nthe city as a whole. Commander Frederick Forbes, a representative of the \nBritish Crown writing an account of his visit to the city in the Church \nMilitary Intelligencer (1853),described Ab\u1eb9okuta as having \"four \npresidents\", and the system of government as having \"840 principal rulers \nor 'House of Lords,' 2800 secondary chiefs or 'House of Commons,' 140 \nprincipal military ones and 280 secondary ones.\" He described Ab\u1eb9okuta and \nits system of government as \"the most extraordinary republic in the \nworld.\"\" And that's just another part of Nigeria!",

I \nassume the reflexive narrative in this is to look at the Colonialism as \ndisruptive and destructive, but destructive of what, exactly? A system \nwhere our protagonist is only punished for beating his week because this \nwas the one week of 52 where you couldn't? Where child sacrifice is a thing \nthat occurs for appeasement between tribes and to celebrate Gods, where \nexpression of rebellion against the patriarch is met with tyranny and \naction, a drunk violent man swinging a club and burning things down, \nkilling messengers for not being like him. Meanwhile, the colonists build \nroads, and hospitals and courthouses with systems of law and establishment. \nAnd the Church that is burned down when he returns (spoilers, but you know, \nyou should have read the book, guys) is without provocation and simply for \nthe tribal leaders to reclaim their hold on the people. A hold that \nexpresses itself through tyranny, tribalism, and nepotism.\n\nIn this, Things Fall Apart doesn't really abandon the savage dark continent \nas it finds its source in a structure of power that has no place in a \nshaping world. It reacts in panic and hate that the world is bigger than \nthe system of power in place there, and instead of unifying for some cause, \nit just incites wanton mob violence. There is a sense of the Colonialist \nEra in the modern day as wrong, and our image of the structure of the world \nout there as savage. But, given what stands for Government does in the \nbook, it isn't hard to imagine how Colonists in the real world came to this.\n\nThe Thuggees of India terrorized the Subcontinent for thousands of years \nwith ritual serial killings and no one would stop them for fear of divine \nretribution. The Aztecs practiced well documented human sacrifice and \ncannibalism as a means to do much of everything. Where our darkest chapter \nof exploration of the slave trade eventually was responded with the \nAbolitionist Movement and the emancipation of men, the sisterly Arabian \nSlave Trade practiced genital mutilation to cull potential populations and \nexisted well into the 1960s. If these are the standards of the world, as \neurocentric as people may cry it to be, then the standards of the world are \nuncivilized, and their eventual demises can be attributed to interaction \nwith the Colonial and post-Colonial Systems.\n\nThis is not to excuse the brutality of some of these systems in \nestablishing order from abroad, or to downplay the social impact they had. \nBut colonial presence can be said to have taken subjectivity away from many \natrocities of the world abroad, and even now the ripples of creating more \nuniversal codes of conduct have make the subject of genocide an \ninternational concern, even if it is mostly in theory than practice. Things \nFall Apart, but did they deserve to stay standing?\ufeff",

The people in Nigeria didn't \neven see themselves as part of it, it's borders were arbitrarily drawn, and \nunited ethnic groups that had only previously been separate states. Britain \ndidn't absorb them, racism was still strong, and while the Romans sought to \nhelp, the British Empire came to \"civilise\" people who had been civilised \nwhile the British were still painting their faces blue.\nEven of the Roman Empire, the criticism had been made, \"they make a desert \nand call it peace\" and Britain's refusal to acknowledge the people that it \nconquered, only to entirely destroy their systems of government, meant that \nthe people resisted them. And why would they like them? What was superior \nabout western civilisation? Wife-beating was as common in Britain as it was \nin Igboland, if not more so. Yes the Thuggees terrorised India, but the \ngovernment that was in place there certainly managed the rest of India than \nEngland managed it's empire, the Irish starving, and England staunch \nrefusal to help evidence of that, and sure enough, while Britain ruled, \nmillions died in India of starvation.\nSlavery was only ended when it ceased to be profitable in the UK, and it \nwas far from the worst thing that western civilisation did, for that, ask \nthe native Americans, ask the Irish, ask the Mau mau. Western Civilisation \nclaimed to be superior, claimed to be better than the systems that it \novertook, and it claimed to civilise. But the systems that the natives had \nin place, when they weren't more democratic than western civilisations, \nwhen they weren't more socially accepting, when they weren't better than \nthe soul crushing poverty that was to be found in much of the west. They \nwere their systems. And the model of civilisation that replaced them was \nnot inertly better. The standards of the Earth are universal, and the goal \nof civilisation is non existent. What stood before the British was not \nperfect, but it worked, and had stood for thousands of years beforehand. It \ndeserved at least to be built upon, as the Romans had done to Britain, not \nburned to the ground. *rant over, excuse spelling mistakes*",

Nigeria was formerly \ndivided into regions with the Industrial Ibos in the south East, \nThe Yoruba's in the west and the mainly Islamic Hausa's (some from this \ngroup are responsible for the Religious bombings in Nigeria at present) in \nthe north. Nigerian prior to independence was the economic hub in Africa. A \nnaira (currency in Nigeria) was much more stronger than an America dollar. \nThe British gave independence in 1960, however it was on a silver platter. \nWith all Nigeria's abundant resources - coal, oil, limestone, gold etc ( \nyou get the picture :)), it seemed to good to be true for Britain to \nrelinquish Nigeria back to its original owners. However, there was a plan \nbehind the plan.\n\nThe British set up Hausa's in office to control affairs with a cunning \nreason. The Ibo's in the South didn't get along well with the British, \nmainly due to our system of doing things. Anyway, the leaders were corrupt \nto say the least. Eventually, and Ibo guy by the name of Nzeogwu led a coup \nagainst the leaders and killed many of them. This from then on was known as \nan Igbo Coup against the Hausa, which was not the case. Among the list to \nbe assassinated were even Ibo men as well so its couldn't be an Ibo coup \nafter all? However this false impression was carried on and instigated a \nrevolt among the Hausa and Yoruba (they teamed up with them) which led to \nthe Pogrom that claimed 300 000 Ibo lives.\n\nOf course the Ibo were angry and decided secession in 1966 by General \nOjukwu and Ibo region was known as Biafra after the Bight of Biafra. \nNigeria claimed war on us in 1967, stating that there must be 'One Nigeria' \nbut of course they were after the oil. The war went of the 3 years and left \nthe Ibo devastated and hopeless. There was no support from Britain, all \nthey did was supply five fold artillery for Nigeria. Another tactic against \nthe Ibos was to stop food supplies which led to the starvation of Ibo women \nand children.\n\nThe missionaries had nothing to do with it.",

(I say this because my surname includes this \nhard to pronounce diphthong and it sounds grating hearing the g \npronounced). Just me nitpicking an amazing talk. It's beautiful to see \ngreatness from what I once thought as a secondary school literature \ntextbook (seriously the West African Examination Council has it as one of \nthe preferred reading materials... it's like our Dickens). If you have room \nfor a Literature 3 you could include Efua T. Sutherland's \"Marriage of \nAnansewa\" which takes from Akan story telling traditions in a \npost-colonial setting, or the Nigerian adaptation of \"Everyman\". Heck or \nyou could do \"Journey to the West\".\n\n*Sigh* It just goes to show, Literature is not merely the text read; It's \nthe exploration of gains. What is gained in reading and having read?. Is it \na new found  knowledge of culture, opinion or fact? Or is it a new found \nexperience or an emotional response you weren't expecting? Good literature \nprovides all these. A multi-verse of new experiences each with it's own \noutcome and journey to explore.\ufeff",
