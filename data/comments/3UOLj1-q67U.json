That's how \nI've learned a majority of the English words I know. Classes taught me \nirregular verbs and grammar, but my vocabulary mostly comes from listening \nand reading.\n\nI watch anime with subtitles on but I still compare what I hear with what I \nread, and every now and then I learn a new word.\nYou definetily won't learn to read or write Japanese without a guide of \nsome sort, good thing internet has many good sites and tools for learning \nit.",
