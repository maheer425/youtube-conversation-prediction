You can \nlike Cumberbatch, his performance and still be disappointed that he was \nKahn rather say an American even British actor of Indian descent.\n\nI wonder what a modern reboot of Star Trek looks like where action for the \nnon-Trekkie audiences is not the focus but maybe the social commentary the \noriginal series is known for.\n\nIs it possible for a movie that doesn't focus on just three of the \ncharacters? Why hire actors who are just attractive but can act if most of \nthem never get the chance for more than 5 mins.\ufeff",
