                    "text": "+Alex Mondschein I'm sure he has some sense of a mission, but conservative \nsocial policies are not really appealing to non-conservatives. There is a \ndifference between downplaying your opposition to same sex marriage, to \nsimply stating it a few times (like Romney), and then to making it one of \nyour core issues. I mean, does Santorum really expect to get votes with his \nincredibly vocal opposition to homosexuality and same sex marriage? \n\n I too think that Romney will run again in 2016. It sounds like a joke to \nmany a liberal and even conservative now, but he's simply the most \nqualified to fix the economy. I'm a big Romney fan boy. \n\nJeb may be able to do a good job, but his last name just has too much \nbaggage on it. Even if he were to be great, he won't win in a general \nelection. Also, the fact that he's pretty much in favor of illegal \nimmigration will turn off many conservatives. \n\nI'm not particularly fond of Bill, but I've gotta hand it to him for what \nhe's done right. Unlike Obama, he was actually willing to compromise with \nRepublicans. He may be a sexual predator and a liar, but at least he knew \nhow to do the whole \"president thing\". \n\nI liked Ted Cruz before he went... kinda crazy. He's like the tea partier \nwho gives no credit to conservatives. \n\nRubio is certainly a possible prospect in the future. He could win many \nHispanic votes for the GOP.\n\nI was a kid during the Bush years, but I've read about it. He made a lot of \ndecisions I don't like, such as Common Core. And I would like to know where \nhe got his information that there were WMD's in the Middle East. I think he \ndid the best he could, but his best, combined with some things he couldn't \ncontrol, just amounted to a lackluster presidency. ",

                    "text": "He's a meglomaniac. He, literally, has *delusions* of grandeur. Not quite \nschizoid delusions, but still delusions. Even if the major donors don't \nfund him, the polls don't favor him, the networks don't support him, and \nthe big guys won't endorse him... He truly and full-heartedly believes he \ncan win. It's the God-complex (ironically, because God's supposed to be his \nhomeboy.) he sees all things as possible, and he won't quit until he loses \nhis marbles completely.\nHe's almost like Mitt Romney, I'm actually expecting Romney to run for the \nthird time in 3 elections, and if that doesn't happen, he's young enough \nthat I'm sure he plans on being president at *some* point in his life. But \nat least that's not a total pipe dream, Romney's gotten relatively close \ntwice... And he does (unlike Santorum) have a solid backing of donors, \nendorsements, and support from the party. He fits the \"2016 and beyond\" \nmold for the Republicans.. Social \"moderate\", extreme fiscal conservative, \nfrom a blue state. Actually I think he's (despite being a 2 time loser) \ntheir best bet since Giuliani quit, Christie (who was by all means going to \nbe handed the nomination) is immersed in scandal, and I just can not see \nthem putting up another fucking Bush... Even if Jeb is \"the better Bush\", \nthat name is so tainted... I think that would be a *huge* mistake. If it \ncame down to Jeb vs. Hillary, it's going to automatically be comparing \nBill's presidency to Bush's presidency.. If I'm Hillary, I'd rather \nindependents look at Bill's presidency than Obama's... And if I'm a \nRepublican I want to pretend Bush's presidency never happened. I mean party \npolitics aside, I think even Republicans can admit 2004-2012 was a \n*trainwreck*. Terrorist attacks, two failed wars, the worst recession in \nthe history of recessions, Bill left a record surplus, Bush turned it into \na record shortage, the Patriot Act, No Child Left Behind... I mean, dude, \neverything he did failed. That's unheard of, other presidents, from both \nparties did some good/some bad.. Nobody's ever done no good, all bad. He'll \ngo down in History as the single worst president quite posdibly ever. I \nknow that's a hefty statement, but you have to way, way, way back to find \nanyone even close to that level. Sorry for rambling, I got carried away, \nbut yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney give it another go. The \nchoices to take on Hillary are all losers... It's Bush, Christie (too much \ndirt), Rubio (Right now I see him as the front runner, but his party \ndoesn't see him as a contendor.. I don't think he'll get the backing Bush, \nChristie or Romney would), Cruz (joke), Santorum (joke), Paul (polarizing, \nreal Republicans don't trust him) and Carson (joke)... Somebody's gotta \nstep in, and Romney will jump at the chance.",
