                "text": "Editor\u2019s note: This comment first posted on 12/19/13, which has nothing to \ndo with QB Russell Wilson (b. 11/29/88) in this video moving through the \ncafeteria at the NFL Seattle Seahawks training facility with 12:19 PM shown \non a digital clock with a red LED display. Also unrelated is Wilson \neclipsing 2007 HEisMAN Trophy winning QB Timothy Richard Tebow (b. 8/14/87 \nin the Philippines) in NFL starts during the 2013 season despite Tebow\u2019s \n1st start coming on 12/19/10\u2014exactly three years before this comment was \ncomposed. In his first start, Tebow and his Denver Broncos suffered a 23-39 \nloss at Al Davis' OAKland Raiders. Tebow is unrelated to actor Kenneth \nFranklin, who played Newell College Knights football star (with NFL \nprospects) Tim Pardo in the \u201cOffense\u201d ep. of Dick Wolf\u2019s NBC drama \u201cLaw & \nOrder: Criminal Intent\u201d, which aired 11/29/07\u2014Russell Wilson\u2019s 19th \nbirthday and nine days before Tebow won the HEisMAN. In the football/sexual \nassault-themed ep., a teammate calls the Tim Pardo character \u201cTimbo\u201d \noutside Tim\u2019s parents\u2019 Grand View Hall apartment building. Pardo is a \nsuspect in the murder of TRACi kWON (Yin Chang) who lived in another \nbuilding where the lady in  #309 answered the intercom's buzz \nindiscriminately, allowing just about anyone in the building\u2014something DA \nInvestigator Gates (Cortez Nance Jr.)notes as he slips both hands in his \npants pockets. Franklin played Johnny Kerns in the \u201cDreams Deferred\u201d ep. \n(12/5/12) of Wolf\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d.Jay Berwanger won \nthe first HEisMAN in 1935, finishing ahead of finalists Monk Meyer (Army, \nJr.); William Shakespeare (Notre Dame, Sr.); Pepper Constable (Princeton, \nSr.). \n\nRussell Wilson\u2014then the Wisconsin Badgers QB\u2014placed 9th in voting for the \n77th HEisMAN in 2011, which Baylor QB Robert Griffith III won. Oregon RB \nLaMichael James placed 10th for the 77th HEisMAN and faced Wilson's Badgers \nin the 98th Rose Bowl the following month; Wilson's older brother, Harrison \nWilson IV, turned six on 7/12/89\u2014the day the 8th place finisher for the \n77th HEisMAN, Boise State QB Kellen Moore, was born. For the 77th HEisMAN, \nAndrew Luck finished 2nd; Trent Richardson 3rd; Montee Ball, 4th; tyRANN \nMAtTHieu 5th. James got a big break in the 2010 season when he replaced \nOregon Ducks teammate LeGarrette Blount (b. 12/5/86 in Madison,FL) in the \nlineup after Blount punched Boise State DE BYron hOUT (b. 8/15/90 in Coeur \nd' Alene, ID) immediately after a 19-8 season opening loss to hOUT's Boise \nState Broncos. Blount then hit teammate Garrett Embry, who was attempting \nto restrain him.\n\nFranklin played Adrian Scott in the charity football game themed \u201cBut \nThere\u2019s a Catch\u201d ep. of USA Network drama \u201cRoyal Pains\u201d; it aired 7/6/11 on \nGeorge Walker Bush\u2019s 65th b\u2019day. Both Wilson and Tebow are \u201cfaith on their \nsleeves\u201d, self-professed Christians. Wilson attended the private, $17,000 \nper year K-12 Collegiate School in Richmond,VA, while Tebow was home \nschooled in the Jacksonville, FL area, but allowed to play football for the \nPanthers of public Allen D. Nease High (10550 RAY Road, Ponte Vedra, FL). \nThe school is named for Florida conservation and reforestation advocate, \nAllen Dowling Nease (d. 1983), who like Russell Wilson, attended North \nCarolina State Univ. \n\nMore NC State Univ. links: Adriel Johnson (b. 6/22/57; 423-80-8086) earned \na PhD in animal science/nutritional physiology from the school in 1989. \nJohnson died with fellow faculty member Maria Ragland Davis in the 2/12/10 \nUniv. of Alabama-Huntsville shooting. The shooter, biology professor Amy \nBishop, was reportedly disgruntled because she felt \"quota hires\" were \ndenying her tenure; she used a 9mm handgun in the attack. Davis earned a \nmasters in chemical engineering from NC State. Sports teams at the Univ. of \nAlabama-Huntsville are nicknamed Chargers and school colors are royal blue \nand white.\ufeff",
