The whole world building idea is kind of propped up \nway too high among writers these days anyway, probably due to the \npopularity of *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Hunger Games*, *A \nSong of Fire and Ice*, *Twilight*, *Percy Jackson & the Olympians*, *The \nHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, etc. It's definitely a trend. Not saying \nit's bad, or that \"worlds\" are negligible, but that this TED-Ed definitely \nreflects the current book market and its ethos more so than any \ntrans-generational template for all kinds of writers.",

Jesus made up stuff so \nhe could teach lessons. So by your logic, you're talking shit about him \njust as much as everyone else here. I'm a musician too. I play drums in a \nchurch, lead and mentor a youth band in said church, I teach drum lessons, \nI write my own music and record it at home, and people love my music. Most \nof my music is based on fantasy and fiction because talking about real \nproblems, in my opinion, is stupid. \"My girlfriend left me and my dog \ndieeedddd\" Great, so why do I want to listen to your shitty problems when I \nhave my own? Don't fork your problems onto other people through music. \nuplift them, take them to a faraway beautiful place and make them happy. \nThat's my take on it. But hey, you're a creator too, you write music and \nunderstand the process. But as a creator of music, you have to understand \nthat you just completely bulldozed yourself here. Musicians are not real \ncraftsmen. They make things to entertain and to draw people away from the \nworld for a few minutes. Musicianship is not a real trade, it's not \nimportant to the world, it doesn't build houses, farm food, purify water, \ncreate energy, research the universe, or find new forms of life. It simply \nMAKES THINGS UP to make people happy. So if you really stand behind what \nyou believe, you should quit the business and work in a fucking factory. \"I \nsense youth and ignorance.\" I sense a dry old man that thinks he \nunderstands the world by his age alone, and is pissed that a 24 year old is \ntelling him how it is.

Some people use modulars, but for me nothing beats the feel of a well \nhand crafted world.\nNot only does it help create the world, but it also fleshes it out. As \nplayers start to explore, question, and even break aspects of your world it \nforces you to think of aspects that you may not have even bothered with. \nIt makes the world feel as though it is living, and that you and your \nplayers have an actual stake in it.\n\nHell one of my favorite shows is Adventure Time. The Land of Ooo feels like \nthis living breathing world that you could live in, because it is so well \ndetailed. A lot of the writers have remarked that sometimes when they are \nwriting an episode they play it out like a pen and paper RPG. Not only to \nget a good idea of how the characters would react, but what part of the \nworld they are reacting too.\ufeff",

Lord of the Rings, Narnia, A Game of Thrones, \nRedwall, Avatar last air bender, Skyrim, Star Wars, Pokemon, and most \nimportantly History all gave me inspiration on different types of conflict, \ncharacter development, and structure. Last bit of advice is, if you can, to \nhave someone who is also writing to help you edit, brainstorm, or give \nfeedback. Tolkien and C. S.

I \nrecommend you take notes on what you observe about the writings of authors \nwhom you think do a good job of making their fictional world seem real to \nyou.  For instance, what did J.R.R. Tolkien do to make Middle Earth seem \ninteresting?  I have noticed that he wrote pages and pages of descriptive, \nalmost whimsical fancy about seemingly unimportant things, such as his \ndescription of the unassuming ways, habits and history of Hobbits.  That's \na good observation.  He treated it as though it were real, at least for the \npurposes of writing about it.  He gave it feeling, beauty and history and \nthen he mused about those things.  Each author handles problems like this \none differently, but I'm sure you get my drift.  Endless observation of \ngenius goes a long way toward displaying some for yourself.\nAnyway, you sound as though you really want to succeed.  If you put in the \nlong hours and the hard work, maybe you will.  Good luck!",

                    "text": "Wow. Amazing the turns conversations take. Definition of \"literally\" to \nSouth Park to Christianity to morality and round and round. Phew... Anyway, \nIt seems there's a lot of misconceptions on this chain (correct me if I \nhave my own.)\nFirst, I wish dictionary writers would stop accommodating incorrect usage \nof words by changing their meanings. it confuses things even more than \nbefore. Second, existence can be true for material things as well as ideas. \nI think the ability to be concious of something is the definition for its \nexistence. If we are conscious of it, but it is immaterial (ignoring, for \nthe moment, any materialist ideas (see what I did there? \n(Parenthesesception! (sorry))) of ideas being only electrical impulses) \nthen, it is an idea. But that is still a literal existence. Literally can \nbe used as a emphatic for a real (unexaggerated) event. Thus, the idea \nliterally exists! And was literally created. A fictional world is a complex \nsystem that exists (literally) in the world of ideas. What you got confused \non (I think) is that the word \"build\" can already mean both a material or \nmental construction. (Just like \"fight\" has physical and mental \ndefinitions.) But yes, the word \"literally\" was kind of awkwardly thrown in \n(It's not literally wrong though (see what I did again))(incidentally, the \nworld \"rhetorically\" doesn't work too well either. (It can, but not well) \nThe word I think you're looking for is \"imaginatively\", \"literarily\" (if \nthat's a word), or otherwise \"Writers build literary worlds.\")\nThird, for you Christians, you're drawing too much attention to atheist \nhostility, which wasn't hostility as you seem to be defining. Sure, \natheists oppose the Christian worldview, which means they're hostile. But \nthat doesn't mean they're being aggressive. Also, if you really want to \nspread the Word, don't focus on their hostility and continue to observe \nthat, but try to address their problems with Christianity. Or, if you're \ndealing with particularly sarcastic ones, say you'll ignore them and then \ndo it. Otherwise you go in circles as with now.\nFinally, for you atheists. I haven't got time for a full treatise on \nreligion, but I'd like to answer one of your ideas, that heaven is made up \nbecause it's a scapegoat for a fear of dying. However, just because heaven \nis a way out of death doesn't make it untrue. There's a difference between \nan excuse and a justification. Both are scapegoats, but the latter is a \ntrue one. The question is not whether something whether something is a \nconvenient idea (the word again!), but whether something is true. (Your \nargument however, does seem to apply to Christians who think Hell doesn't \nexist)\nWhew, sorry if I got too scholarly up there. Plus, sorry if I sound \nhateful. I'm just trying to clear people up when they're misled, and I'm \njust as happy when someone points out my faults. (Unless they're acting \nlike a dick when they do it)\nOn a marginally related note, that was a nice video with amusing animation, \nbut a little too vague for my tastes. I'd have preferred if you'd been more \ndefinite with at least one aspect of worldbuilding instead of the \neducation-by-examples you gave.\n\ntl;dr go back and read my argument dude. It's too complex for a couple of \nsentences. Oh, and I liked the video but thought it rather unspecific.",

Now, as \nfar as your question goes, I would not have brought religion into this \nconversation, but since it was done by someone else in a mocking way, I \nchose to address that.  Faith, (not the same thing as religion, mind you), \ncould fit very well into this conversation, depending on how one \nunderstands the meaning of the term, but I think I'll just leave it at \nthat.

The Eddas filled his head \nwith ideas and inspiration, obviously he's going to use some of that \ninspiration in his works. If you look at for example the Lion King \nside-by-side to Hamlet you'll notice that they're basically the same story. \nDisney took inspiration from Shakespeare and made it into something new, \nsomething that was their own.\n\nThere is a line though.

For example Flappy Bird using old \nMario assets in it's level design or (as much as i hate the movie) \nSundayschool musical ripping of Highschool musical. That is just wrong.",

This is simply how culture works, we take \nin stories and expressions that other people have created from a life of \nexperiences and use them to help shape who we are. We then proceed to \ncreate stories and expressions using our own experiences in life and what \nmade us who we are today.

Maybe asking \"what if that \ndidn't exist?\" or \"what if that always happened?\" or \"what if that was the \nother way around?\" Misinterpret as much as you can, as that will develop \nideas and improve your understanding of language and your use of it in a \nway that isn't broad or confusing (unfortunately this also has the side \neffect of making other people really confusing, because they use language \nvery broadly).",

It's much, much easier to start out with a good story, \nthen create the world around it (in my opinion). If only because a universe \nhas an infinite amount of possible stories to highlight, very easy to get \nsidetracked that way.\n\nStory = conflict, the more intense and relatable the conflict, the more \nimmersive the story. That's so much more important than the world... Get \nsome characters, define their fears, put them in a situation they cannot \nchange where they're forced to overcome their fears. Starting out with the \nmain character, then expanding it to accommodate other individuals that \nneed to be introduced in order to tell his/her story.\n\nThe world, the setting, ideally is all designed to support the telling of a \nvery specific story. An incredible world will not save a mediocre story... \nwhereas a good story is timeless, in the sense that setting does not matter \nat all. It's just flavor. (Walking Dead and Toy Story 3 are essentially the \nsame story, for instance) The sense of wonder and horror of a zombie \napocalypse experienced by a sheriff is mirrored in the sense of wonder and \nhorror a toy sheriff experiences when he leaves home. Both are stories \nabout self-discovery and responsibility by being forced to adapt to an \nunknown world (as are Harry Potter, LOTR, The Matrix, etc.). But it's the \nmain character and his/her personal past and goals that define the world \nneeded to tell the story. Everything grows from there.
