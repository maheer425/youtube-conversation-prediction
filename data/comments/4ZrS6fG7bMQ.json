None of which involve any dramatic \ntreatments .Lots af people have ocd. You will just have a diagnosis, which \nmeans you will get a lot better. It won't get worse. It cant .

That was about a year ago. It has gotten so bad that I have \nspecific places on a wall to tap, the colour of the wall, I tap very hard \nand use force, I tap MYSELF, I have  certain sequences (tap a specific wall \n5 times then tap myself 5 times and then repeat that 5 times) and the worst \nthing is that is now triggered by the slightest things like hearing a name \nI do not like or a food I don't like. It sucks and when I'm in my room, the \nspecific wall I have is quite thin and my parents room is on the other side \nso they can always hear the tapping. I do it when I am trying to sleep, \nwhen I'm at school, when I'm outside, everywhere. It takes me hours to get \nto sleep because I always have to interrupt it to tap that thin wall. It is \nhorrible to have and I am too embarrassed to tell my parents to get me seen \nto...In short - It is slowlyyyy taking over my life :/",
