She kept \nswearing she had bought one, but we thought maybe with 9 small children she \nhad gotten distracted and just thought she did. It took a few hours, but we \nfinally realized the cat had come in while we were busy putting groceries \naway and dragged the 22lb turkey off into a corner, but off the plastic \nwrapper and had eaten at least a quarter of the turkey!! We were all so \nincredibly grossed out-my poor mother cried!! Even with a fresh, new \nturkey-we all pretty much lost our appetite for it that year!",

Not only \ncan the ground beef you just bought from the store be months old, but when \nit was butchered, it was cut up along with several other animals and \npossibly glued together with other meat from a different cow/animal which \nleads to cross contamination.\n\nI can go on and on about the way us Humans process their meat which is bad \nfor dogs if eaten raw, but that would take too long.
