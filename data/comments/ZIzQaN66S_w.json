TP is a large game no doubt but I just think it \nneeded to be on a bigger scale with ridiculously tougher enemies, a darker \nworld and a Hero mode. The twilight realm, while it intended to be dark, \nreally wasn't because of the pink sky it had, and the landscape remained \npretty much the same. Nintendo really should have looked at their Link to \nthe Past version of it. Also get rid of Midna, even if it means renaming \nthe game.
