Of all weak or strong drugs known, marijuana is unique \nby having lethal doses beyond humans capacity to reach them physically. \nBesides, marijuana is already used in wide array of medication treatment \nfor vast list of different diseases, including cancer, it can be stimulant, \nsedative or non-psychoactive depending on a given strain. Numerous people \nworking in medicine has called marijuana the most beneficial naturally \nproduced drug in human history.\n\nIt's also a universal industrial resource for concrete, chipboard, plastic, \nropes, cloth, paper, biofuel, homestead chemistry like soap and food \nproducts like butter, that can grow pretty much anywhere given the proper \ntemperature and humidity levels is provided. Cannabis plants can be grown \nannualy outdoor or regularly indoor, requiring little to no expertice in \nfarming procedures, leaving lumber production virtually pointless, which \nwould allow forests to freely propagate and regulate CO2 levels to fix the \nglobal warming process naturally, while providing a majority of modern \nresource and power needs with no waste product.\n\nThe only reason it's still illegal in many places is because way too many \nmoney is involved in it's prohibition and numerous industries, which \ncannabis would replace otherwise. And racist stuff is really irrevelant \nhere. It's just a method of getting votes by hitting right buttons in \nmiddle-class consciousness at a time.",

If you are married, or have a girlfriend, could you \ngive up sex? you won't go through withdrawals however as i said, it is very \nvery addictive and thus you can't. weed is similar in that sense because it \nmakes you feel good. Have you seen people suffering from Opium addiction? \nare you serious bro? its bad.\n\nThe reason why marijuana is becoming legalized is due to the same issues \nwith prohibition, the huge level of petty crime, robbery, gang activity \nthat revolves around marijuana is becoming worse than the hit on the \nworking economy, and driving deaths that would happen after legalization. \nWhen there is enough demand, the government cannot resist the people. \nHowever just cuz all your kids want cake, doesn't mean you should give them \ncake, they will get fat and may become diabetic.",

Cannabinoid delivery was safe and was \nachieved with zero psychoactive effects. THC was found to decrease tumour \ncells in two out of the nine patients.\n 2. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience examined the \nbiochemical events in both acute neuronal damage and in slowly progressive, \nneurodegenerative diseases. They conducted a magnetic resonance imaging \nstudy that looked at THC (the main active compound in marijuana) and found \nthat it reduced neuronal injury in rats. The results of this study provide \nevidence that the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against \nneurodegeneration.\n 3. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental \nTherapeutics already acknowledged the fact that cannabinoids have been \nshown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of \ncannabidiol (CBD, non psychoactive cannabinoid compound) on human glioma \ncell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the \nviability of glioma cells. Glioma is the word used to describe brain \ntumour. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a \nsignificant antitumor activity.\n 4. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics outlines \nhow brain tumours are highly resistant to current anticancer treatments, \nwhich makes it crucial to find new therapeutic strategies aimed at \nimproving the poor prognosis of patients suffering from this disease. This \nstudy also demonstrated the reversal of tumour activity in Glioblastoma \nmultiforme.\n 5. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine, conducted by \nthe California Pacific Medical Centre determined that cannabidiol (CBD) \ninhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. They also \ndemonstrated that CBD significantly reduces tumour mass.\n 6. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental \nTherapeutics determined that THC as well as cannabidiol dramatically \nreduced breast cancer cell growth. They confirmed the potency and \neffectiveness of these compounds.\n 7. A study published in the Journal Molecular Cancer showed that THC \nreduced tumour growth and tumour numbers. They determined that cannabinoids \ninhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cancer cell apoptosis and impair \ntumour angiogenesis (all good things). This study provides strong evidence \nfor the use of cannabinoid based therapies for the management of breast \ncancer.\n 8. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of \nSciences of the United States of America (PNAS) determined that \ncannabinoids inhibit human breast cancer cell proliferation.\n 9. A study published in the journal Oncogene, by Harvard Medical Schools \nExperimental Medicine Department determined that THC inhibits epithelial \ngrowth factor induced lung cancer cell migration and more. They go on to \nstate that THC should be explored as novel therapeutic molecules in \ncontrolling the growth and metastasis of certain lung cancers.\n 10. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine by the \nInstitute of Toxicology and Pharmacology, from the Department of General \nSurgery in Germany determined that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell \ninvasion. Effects were confirmed in primary tumour cells from a lung cancer \npatient. Overall, data indicated that cannabinoids decrease cancer cell \ninvasiveness.\n  11. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine, conducted \nby Harvard Medical School investigated the role of cannabinoid receptors in \nlung cancer cells. They determined its effectiveness and suggested that it \nshould be used for treatment against lung cancer cells.\n 12. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine illustrates a \ndecrease in prostatic cancer cells by acting through cannabinoid receptors.\n 13. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine outlined \nmultiple studies proving the effectiveness of cannabis on prostate cancer.\n14. Another study published by the US National Library of Medicine \ndetermined that clinical testing of CBD against prostate carcinoma is a \nmust. That cannabinoid receptor activation induces prostate carcinoma cell \napoptosis. They determined that cannabidiol significantly inhibited cell \nviability.\n 15. A study published in the journal Molecular Pharmacology recently \nshowed that cannabinoids induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in matle \ncell lymphoma. The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer \nSociety, The Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm.\n 16. A study published in the International Journal of Cancer also \ndetermined and illustrated that cannabinoids exert antiproliferative and \nproapoptotic effects in various types of cancer and in mantle cell lymphoma.\n 17. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine conducted by \nthe Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology by Virginia Commonwealth \nUniversity determined that cannabinoids induce apoptosis in leukemia cells.\n 18. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine results show \ncannabinoids are potent inhibitors of cellular respiration and are toxic to \nhighly malignant oral Tumours. -\n 19. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine determined \nthat that THC reduces the viability of human HCC cell lines (Human \nhepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line) and reduced the growth.\n 20. A study published in The American Journal of Cancer determined that \ncannabinoid receptors are expressed in human pancreatic tumor cell lines \nand tumour biopsies at much higher levels than in normal pancreatic tissue. \nResults showed that cannabinoid administration induced apoptosis. They also \nreduced the growth of tumour cells, and inhibited the spreading of \npancreatic tumour cells.",

No cultures abused marijuana the way people do now, smoking it on \na daily or every other day basis, the human evolutionary body was not meant \nto do this, and if you think otherwise just because the plant grows in a \nlot of places shows your lack of both historical and medical knowledge. as \nan anthropologist, ask your medical doctor, ask your phd historian whatever \nyou want but the truth remains that the way of ingestion that is used in \ncontemporary discourse for marijuana has been seen as detrimental to \nsociety for at least several hundred years of recorded human history. \n\nlegalizing, illegalizing, doesn't matter. as previously mentioned in other \nposts, we are not comparing present social phenomenon to that of \nprohibition, the fact remains that marijuana is unhealthy.\n\nyou obviously have not studied even undergraduate level physiology 1A as \nphagocytes in the lungs remain dormant after processing foreign particulate \nmatter... unless of course you are to suggest marijuana magically \ndisappears once in the lungs. \n\nMany traditional medicines chose to strike certain medicines from the \nrecords as it would cause more harm to society to be worth the FEW and far \nbetween health benefits. Marijuana to keep food down is better than dying \nfrom malnutrition via chemo, bet you did not know chemo kills through \nmalnutrition, because you have no background in oncology. Opium was used as \nan anesthetic over 2 thousand years ago in north east China. yet these uses \nwere kept secret because they did not want people to abuse that type of \nmedication. surgery was also used at this type (which is why there was \nanesthesia) however it was not repeated because during this time the \ntechnology was not good enough to keep things sterilized for surgery to be \nworth the risks. \n\non a different note, coffee is bad for you especially in the mornings and \nchronic use shortens life. alcohol is worse than marijuana, but that \ndoesn't change marijuana is unhealthy. If you want to do it, accept you are \ndamaging yourself. I smoke cigarettes, i grew up in a culture where people \nsmoke cigarettes, i've accepted its not neccessarily good for me, i'm not \nliving in denial like many of the pro-marijuana advocates are. Stop trying \nto prove marijuana is healthy, there are studies that show people who don't \ninhale cigarettes have lower blood pressure and live on average \nstatistically significant longer lives. but you dont see people trying to \nsay cigarettes are healthy, although they are more healthy unit per unit \ncompared to marijuana (unadulterated cigarettes to unadulterated \nmarijuana). \n\nno one is forcing you to do anything, im just stating the truth. if you \nfeel more productive when high, it is just because your endocrine system is \nso out of wack you need marijuana to put it back to balance, which is a \nserious health issue in itself. and if you are not the chronic smoker, you \nare less productive. this is a point of logic based on BASIC human \nphysiology... go ask your doctor about it",

We are hard wired for this plant \nwhich exists on 6 continents.... You lost me when you said the \nMayo doesn't know what it's talking about but YOU seem to think YOU are an \nexpert. Also, everybody on this planet is not here to live up to YOUR \nstandards of \"productivity\". Cannabis is a Plant. A food. A nearly perfect \nfood at that. It has all the amino acids needed for life including the 9 \nour bodies are unable to produce on it's own. The US Federal Government \npatented cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants in US Patent \n#6630507; it mentions Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, \nneurological trauma, HIV dementia, and autoimmune disorders as conditions \nfor which cannabinoids may be indicated, and though more research is needed \nto determine the profiles of active compounds (e.g. terpenes (like pinene, \nlimonene, and myrcene), flavonoids(like apigenin), and cannabinoids (like \nCBD, THCV, CBN, and THC), Cannabis may be indicated as a way to treat, \nprevent, and/or cure numerous other conditions, including cancers, organ \ndamage as well as nausea (induced by chemotherapy and radiation), \nchemotherapy resistance, diabetes and its complications, osteoporosis, \nexostosis, atherosclerosis, sepsis, reperfusion injury, obesity, microbial \ninfections (including MRSA, brain-eating amoebae, and herpes), anxiety \ndisorders (e.g. GAD, PTSD, and OCD), stroke damage, bipolar disorder, \nschizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, autism, depression, insomnia, \nspasticity, dystonia, dyskinesia, acne, psoriasis, allergic contact \ndermatitis, pruritis, asthma, fibromyalgia, lupus, migraine, vascular \ndementia, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases, chronic pancreatitis, \nCrohn's disease, colitis, IBS, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, \narthritis, MS, ALS, pain, GVHD, organ transplant rejection, sleep apnea, \nincontinence, and metabolic syndrome. Smoking Cannabis was found by UCLA \nresearchers to NOT be linked with either lung cancer or COPD, but \nbronchitis was mentioned. Nearly all of the claims that cannabis lowers IQ \nin heavy users who start young are based on just one study, Meier et al. \n2012. This study found an IQ drop in 19 cannabis users who started in \nadolescence, continued usage into adulthood, and had 3 or more \"dependency\" \ndiagnoses. There are a large number of concerns regarding this study \nthough, and the results have been brought into question in the same \njournal. The conflicting factors that make the study questionable are so \nlong I will not even attempt to list them here. Needless to say the \nresearchers themselves determined the study was seriously flawed.  Strains \nof Cannabis with low psych activity exist (e.g. CBD-rich) but Drug \nProhibition hinders access to them too. Cannabis has astounding medical \npotential beyond its psych activity (the THC) which is the component \nthat helps to relieve pain.. Even the worst effects of Cannabis are not as \ndangerous as the laws that ban it.  Give up this moralist battle. You are \nnot some super-hero saving the world from the \"evil\" cannabis plant..",

Yes alcohol was banned but it was only unbanned because enough \npeople wanted it so much that the law was ignored and and it created \nunnecessary crime, not because we changed our opinion of its ability to \ncause societal harm.  The only people who can't function with marijuana are \npeople who abuse it. The same goes with alcohol. \n\nAlso no one is claiming that the government wanted to \"have its way.\" He \nsaid that a racist nation will tend to create racist laws. In other words \nif blacks preferred alcohol and whites preferred marijuana, marijuana would \nbe legal and alcohol would not. And exactly what \"way\" does the government \nhave that keeps tobacco legal. Heart disease being more deadly than tobacco \ndoesn't somehow make tobacco better. The logic here is no where to be found.\n\nNow its technically possible that they were trying to help the minorities \nby making those drugs illegal except the justice system has consistently \nsearched, arrested, harassed, imprisoned and imprisoned for longer people \nwho are not white. Official law enforcement statistics support this \nheavily. \n\nAnd finally correlation is not causation. Many successful people use drugs. \nAlcohol, cigarettes, and the pharmaceutical equivalents of heroin and \ncocaine are rather popular among successful whites.

                    "text": "what is ignorant about it? social discourse in America in regards to racism \nis what exactly? what do at least 70% of Americans picture if not a lot \nmore? White man discriminating Black man. Is it ignorant to say this? \nformal education in this field states it is accurate to say this. just like \nhow in sociology if society thinks you are a certain race, that is what you \nare. To say Blacks do not have the privilage of affermative action is a \nblatant lie... and last to my knowledge, the truth did not equate to \nignorance. To say that Whites should pay for what some white people did 150 \nyears ago is grouping White people together via their race. and to say that \nthis is not racist, is ignorant. \n\nThere is racism, however racism is not like water in a measuring cup where \nyou can measure who has it better or worse, as we all live together in \nsociety, and thus racism always affects other races. For example Asians \ndon't \"just have it hard when it comes to college\" we have it hard because \nby % Asians are far more educated and have higher test scores than other \nraces, so to give other races a chance only the best of the best Asians get \ninto school, while others who are still far above average in the US loose \ntheir opportunity to get an education. Racism is interlinking like this by \nnature.\n\nIf Black people are allowed to make racist remarks towards Whites Asians \nand Mexicans and it be ok in social discourse, The balance of power is \nshifted due to correlation of vocal racial offenses being tollorated. The \nrace that is least allowed to say racist remarks suddenly is seen as the \nhigher power that takes those remarks because they cannot hurt them, and \nthey are not bitter because they are simply \"the bigger men\" and this is a \nperpetuation of self-destruction. I'm sure if you do a simple search on a \ndata base or even google scholar, u will find plenty of peer reviewed \njournals about the dynamics of racism and the interlinking of racial \ncommunities through racism. Put a few different liquids that cannot mix \ninto a pot of different colors, some colors will congregate in one section \n(education) or another (sports) or another (media) etc. (different fields \nof being in a society, including jobs). Just because a community is lacking \nin 1 section, they are advantagous in another, there is always balance, and \nimbalance never lasts very long. \n\nSo to be blunt. If Asian people want to get into media, we should stop \ndoing so well in fields like law, medicine, engineering.\n\nIf Black people want to get more representation in universities, Stop \nfocusing so much on sports, stop producing great athletes and comedians and \nmedia icons\n\nIf White people want to be able to make racial slurs, stop reproducing for \na while so that you won't be the vast majority of the population. \n\nAs you can see there are advantages in all situations, and there are \nstruggles in them as well. to focus on 1's struggle and ignore their \nprivilages leads to people becoming upset, people get angry, they feel as \nif u are lying, manipulating them to villify others, and thus promotes \nhate.

The only racism that has any focus in \nthe US is White Americans using Black slaves. This is both ethnocentric and \nvictimizes other minorities and other countries to erasure in US History \nwhich is taught to poorly educate the US people. Asian people were not even \nallowed families, and were the LAST to be allowed to vote, not to mention \nthey were also used as slaves on the railroads. However in the very short \ntime that Asians were given relative equality, some 30 or so years after \nAfrican Americans, they have become the highest average in terms of wealth, \neven trumping the White American. This is not to mention how the Jews, \nIrish, Italian, etc. etc. were treated in the US just less than a century \nbefore Black slavery happened.\n\nRacism is not a focused thing, it happens to everyone, there is no single \nvictim because everyone is a victim, When a minority pulls focus to only \nthemselves, they victimize their race, place blame on others who also \nsuffer from racism.\n\nYou hear black people making millions from making fun of Whites on TV and \nComedy, if a White person made 10% of the jokes towards Blacks, that the \naverage Black person makes towards Whites, they would probably be arrested. \nJeremy Lin was not even given a chance until he came back to his home town \nand beat the team that didn't give him a chance.\n\nDouble standards = prejudice. You would never hear an Asian person whining \nand crying about how the White man took away our opium. You also rarely if \never hear about the fact that an Asian person needs to have 10 times the \ncredentials of Other minorities and twice that of Whites in order to get \ninto college and get an education. \n\nWhite people have no voice, I once spoke honestly to a White man who said \nto me that he was scared shitless to talk freely at the risk of being \naccused of being a racist, the fear destroys the free expression of ideas, \neven when ideals are free of malice and simply thoughts that come to mind \nfrom observation of facts in one's personal life.\n\nwhat kind of society do we live in when we cannot say what we see in our \nlife around us? We might as well be Nazi Germany, you know, except a whole \nlot less racist. \n\nSpeaking of institutionalized racism, Koreans who were kidnapped and \nbrought to Japan 60 years ago, and their children and grandchildren are not \nallowed to work in government or be a teacher etc. This is why the vast \nmajority of Yakuza in japan are Korean. THAT my friend, is \ninstitutionalized racism. Taking away opium so Asians can focus on their \ncareer, Taking away crack so blacks can have some kind of chance of staying \noff the streets, etc. this is not racism. This is a government protecting \nit's people. Does racism exist? yes. but to throw the racism card at every \nlittle thing cheapens the reality of racism and how horrible it is.\n\nThinking back 150 years and saying that 1 race owes another race something \nis the dumbest thing ever, I've never experienced working on the rail \nroads, You never experienced working on the cotton fields, and You have \nnever experienced whipping someone doing one of these things. Why would I \nhate Whites because some DIFFERENT whites did something to some different \nAsians? Blaming a race because of what others in their race have done... Do \nyou know what is called? RACISM! so stop pulling the race card all the \ntime, that makes you a dirty racist. Respect the people who actually \nexperience real racism, who would otherwise have been a great success. ",

For about three hundred years, slavery was \nlegal and the institution that enabled cotton to be produced economically.  \nPeople were treated as things that the owner could do whatever he wanted.   \nWe fought a war over slavery; a terrible, tragic, war which saw the first \ndraft laws, the destruction of cities, mutilations and other results of \npoor medical practice, prisons in which soldiers were tortured and died.  \nRight here in the U.S.  It was not only over slavery  but what constituted \na human being. The very definition allowed a whole range of inhuman crime \nto be justified and the Civil War, that lasted four long years, was about \nthat too.  Very fundamental concepts.  And the war, as all wars, did not \nsolve the problem.  There was a surrender and a victory,  the economic \nlynchpin was pulled out and the South went south economically when they \ncouldn't afford to produce the only product that they had of value.  \nWorse.  Cotton leaches the nutrients in the soil, destroys its ability to \ngrow things, and that was what they ended up with. \nWe still had the problem: there was segregation to prove it.  In the early \n1960's soldiers protected a little girl who walked to school under a hail \nof curses from students. She held her head high.  But black folk suffered \nyet.  If you think Ethan is not correct, check the statistics.  Read the \nnews of the times.  They are available, and they will show you that his \nconclusions are based on solid facts.  Are there other factors?  Of \ncourse.  But he is dealing legitimately with an aspect of the criminalizing \nof marijuana and heroin and other drugs of intoxication and in which way \nrace is involved.

Not only that, \nbut there's likely to be much less shame, guilt, or self-awareness \nassociated with the racism you encounter; it's just an accepted, \nunquestioned part of life in many cultures. With very few exceptions, the \nonly places that don't have institutionalized racism are countries that \nhave virtually no diversity in the first place, so nobody has to \"deal\" \nwith people of other races, and even most of those cultures have figured \nout how to be racist against someone (caste systems, tribal hatreds, etc). \nGive a culture the chance to be racist and classist, and they'll do it \npretty much every time. Fear and/or domination of \"the other\" evolved into \nour DNA, but that doesn't mean it can't be mitigated: we're in a very \nunique time in history when a small percentage of humans have actually \nrealized that it doesn't have to be that way... and a pretty decent chunk \nof those humans are scattered throughout the U.S., among various other \ncountries. But relative to most, the U.S. is one of the more diverse \ncountries in terms of relatively large groups of vastly differing \nracial/ethnic background (as opposed to countries like Papua New Guinea or \nsome in Africa which have more ethnic diversity due to relatively small \nvariations between groups that evolved side-by-side without mixing, but who \nshare far more surface culture in common than, say, white European, black \nAfrican, and Asian groups in America).",

The government is making an on-going choice for if these negative \nimpacts to society are outweighed by the negative impacts of marijuana \nbeing illegal, such as drug dealers on street corners bothering people and \ngang violence and death due to marijuana. \n\nThe reason why marijuana is hugely different to aclohol is that WAY more \npeople wanted to drink alcohol during prohibition and \"normal people\" where \nbreaking the law to get it. today most middle class - upper middle class \npeople who work at least 5 days a week at least 40 hours with a decent \ncommute do not have time or desire to smoke weed, or if they do, not enough \nto make it worth commercializing. \n\nTherefore the people who are being hurt by marijuana is poor communities of \nall races. and even there, a minority regularly or even socially smokes \nmarijuana. \n\ntobacco originally did not have nearly as much detriment to health, but \nregulations put on cigarette companies, such as having them burn out \nwithout causing wild fires etc, lead to chemicals in them. Korea and Japan, \none of the longest living populations back in the 80's (and even now) and \nalso the highest % of cigarette smokers (over 50%) but this is pure \ntobacco. which may help explain the huge success of tobacco, it was not \nnearly as bad for your health, did not impair judgement, and the affects \nwere only 2 fold, 1. stimulant, similar to caffine except caffine is more \ntoxic. 2. particles left in lungs after phagocyte consumption of said \nparticle (any particles do this including cooking smoke, bbq, camp fires, \netc.) the filter also plays a huge role in minimizing particulate matter.\n\ni guess if you just HAVE to smoke weed. use a filter to minimize lung \ndamage, it does WAY more damage to lungs than cigarettes do. also do not \nhold in smoke, most of it will stay there... forever.

Junk food has zero chance to make a \nbad parent (just a fat one).  Alcohol has low chance to make a bad parent.  \nCigarettes have zero chance to make a bad parent (just an unhealthy one).  \nCars are essential for society, and still have extremely low chance to harm \nkids.  Knives have a small chance to cause injury, but zero chance to make \na bad parent.  The harder drugs have a VERY HIGH percent chance of \nimpairing parental guidance, so it is justified to make them illegal.  \nBanning them from having kids would violate a much more fundamental right \nthan banning a substance.  Coming from a low income household does not \nseverely stunt child success like a parent who has completely lost their \nmind to drugs.  People do not have the right to do whatever they want with \ntheir bodies.  The saying \"the individual always knows best\" is a lie.  \nSometimes society DOES know best and has a right to prevent people from \nhurting themselves when they are not of sound mind, especially when that \nperson is responsible for the upbringing of children.  A hardcore drug \naddict needs to be treated like a mental patient.  They are not of sound \nmind and you are committing a crime against them by allowing them to keep \nup with their behavior.  Would you shove a child out of the way of an \noncoming bus?  You also need to shove adults out of their drug addiction.  \nWhat will you tell a child who grows up in a crack-house?  \"Sorry, we \nhave to protect your mom's right to destroy herself.  Tough luck kid.\"   ",

It's like Dirty Harry \ntelling the commissioner He knew the guy he stopped was a rapist because he \nwas chasing the woman naked, a hard on and with a butcher knife(true, he \nhad not yet stabbed or raped the woman, but do you really want to wait for \nrapists to rape your mother/sister/daughter etc) and then for them to do \nsomething about it afterwards?\n\nIt's partly a INSANE world out there, And one people cannot afford to be \nplaying stupid with while you are in it.\n\nSmoke all the reefer ya want, but there are stacks of bodies a mile high \nfrom the sad people addicted to the hard stuff.(and if it was just \nthemselves they were hurting I would be all for that freedom of choice) But \nthe hard stuff isn't taken because it leaves you in a normal state of mind. \n\nOne day they will create a drug that makes you feel good and have a \nheightened(but normal) brain wave patterns.
