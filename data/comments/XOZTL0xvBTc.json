Hell, even jesus says \ngovernment and church should be apart. It is in the bible itself.\"Render \nunto Caesar what is Caesar's and render unto God what is God's\" Matthew \n22:21 It is the christian's own gospels that they are separate spheres of \ninfluence. Not to mention the who wording of the first amendment and all \nthat to. What people fail to realize is that anything other than the \ngospels (and honestly at the council of Nicaea John was almost deemed to be \nheretic gospel because it did not have any real connection with the other \nsynoptic gospels and actually preached against jesus' meaning. Look it up, \nit is history) are the only books that are supposed to have been done in \njesus' time. romans, corinthians, and all those other book were done by \nPaul (Saul) of Tarsus who by all accounts was vicious and cruel person who \nchanged his ways when he had a vision. He never met Jesus directly at all. \nPeople say that god is ineffable and the book of his word is perfect or \ndivine, and that can mean it can be an analogy to help people. But you have \nto remember humans in power will always try twist things to try keep their \npower. They don't even realize they are being ruled by fear, that they \ncan't even practice what their own savior preaches... I pity these lesser \ncreatures.",

People fixate on the founders and their \nintentions and what they would do about X issue, I say it doesn't help one \nbit to discuss what they would or wouldn't have thought about Automatic \nRifles, Piracy on the internet, or Gay marriage/etc, they set a framework \nby which the government runs and we the current people of the nation work \nwithin that framework via voting, political appointees, and all else to put \nthe things we want into effect.\n\nOn topic, It is clear by the language of the 1st amendment that the \ngovernment doesn't sponsor one religious belief over another, but if there \nis a group that doesn't like this idea they are free, within the framework, \nto suggest a new amendment reversing that clause of the 1st and if they can \npush that amendment through the rigorous trials to getting an amendment \npassed then so be it at that point we'll be under different rules. Until \nsuch a time though, they have no leg to stand on with these arguments.",

There books were so different from each other they could've put \ntogether 1,000 Bibles and no two would've been alike.\n\nThe book of Genesis is a dead giveaway on this, for they put two versions \ntogether in the same book. First creating the universe took six days, then \npresto it starts all over again and it takes only three. Which one is it? \n\nOf course, if anyone does claim to take the Bible literally tell them to do \nas Jesus commands: sell all your possessions and give the money to the \npoor.\ufeff",

A law that all thought would only \nbe symbolic. But the ACLU wanted teachers to have the sole right to set the \ncurriculum, so they advertised for someone to challenge the law. It was \nmeant to be a case about academic freedom.\n\nThe citizens of Dayton saw it as a good opportunity to bring money into the \ntown, & they asked Scopes if he'd agree to be the defendant. It was all \nmeant to be a friendly affair.\n\nThe ACLU would get their test case, lose, & be able to appeal to higher \ncourts. The town of Dayton would get a boost to its economy. Scopes would \nface a fine in theory, but it was understood that he wouldn't actually have \nto pay it.\n\nNobody really cared about creationism v evolution. But Creationists had \nalways been fighting against the teaching of Evolution. The decision in the \nScopes trial was overturned on appeal, but only on a technicality. The \nTennessee Supreme Court ruled that banning to teaching of the theory of \nevolution was not in breach of the Establishment Clause.\n\nIt wasn't until 1967 that the SC of the USA took a different view. \nEvolution began be taught again in Tennessee schools. But Creationists are \nnothing if not determined.\n\nThey may have lost the 2005 Dover Trial, but the US populace still has the \nhighest percentage scientifically illiterate people in the developed world. \nWhich is such a shame. Because the best US scientists are the equal of any \non Earth.\n\nAmerica produces so many extraordinary people. From that truly wonderful \nperson & genius that was Richard Feynman, to Ted Nugent.\n\nMy mum taught me that if I couldn't say anything good about a person, I \nshould say nothing. I have nothing to say about Ted.\n\nBut to give you an idea about how I feel about him. I can find good things \nto say about Sarah Palin.",
