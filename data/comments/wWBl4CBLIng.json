To get an idea you could compare \nthem to your fingernails or better, the nails on a dog or cat. The place at \nwhich Dr. Card chose to trim was well away from the gum line, so it was \njust extra tooth growth and he didn't feel any pain. We try to balance the \ntrim between giving him enough tooth length to chew with and also short \nenough that we can wait a full 3 months before having to do it again.\n\nWhen he wakes up he starts vocalizing because he's most likely disoriented. \nMany animals (including humans) do the same thing even when they are not in \npain). And if you watch other videos with him in it, you'll see the \nvocalizing is just what Kemosabe does. Once fully awake he does spend some \ntime exploring his new shortened teeth and relearning how he's going to \nconsume his food. He gets more used to it each time we go through the \nprocedure and it's less stressful for him every time. I'm really glad we've \nbeen able to find a way to keep him healthy that works so well for him.",
