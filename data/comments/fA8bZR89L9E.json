P.S. the \nTaliban's order that no poppies be grown in 1992 was only issued to reduce \nthe stockpiles of opium which were threatening to ruin the market.

To say that Jesus was God and to worship him as such is to commit \nidolatry. The Muslim is to love Jesus as a prophet of God, but not to \ncommit idolatry by worshiping him.\n\nHeresy is not saying one thing and doing the opposite. That's hypocrisy. \nHeresy is \"any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with \nestablished beliefs\". Since declaring Jesus to be God is heretical to \nIslam, when you come to a Muslim video and claim that Jesus was God then \nyou are a heretic by definition. In a Christian setting you would not be a \nheretic, but a Muslim or a Mormon would be.\n\nI'm not aware of any claim by Islam that its followers will be able to heal \nthe sick. That's a belief of some Christian sects.\n\nIf you can heal the sick by the power of Jesus, and since a Christian \nbelief includes the power of intercessory prayer, please begin praying that \nmy acquaintance regenerates his limbs and digits. If this does not happen \nI'll know your deity is not real and that your religion is false. If you \nchoose not to pray for this then I'll know that you don't actually believe \nwhat you claim to believe and therefore you are a false believer.",
