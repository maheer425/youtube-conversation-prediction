I'm sure the concept is pretty self-explanatory. You'd maybe \nstart with the easy ones like Tobuscus, SourceFed, Ray Wiliam Johnson, \nSmosh. If you're feeling especially suicidal, you could do Everything Wrong \nWith Vlogbrothers. Ohh, you'd get so much hate from that one, it would \nprobably take down the entire internet.\ufeff",
