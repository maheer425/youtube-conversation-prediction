I did lol\n\nI enjoyed the film for what it is, and if I can see optimus prime fighting \ngod in the next movie, that will be sweet too.\n\nTranformers Dark of the Moon was vastly superior to Revenge of the Fallen \nand shows that Bay listens to feedback... not a single humping \ndecepticon(no humping dogs either) or transformer scrotum to be seen.\n\nBut hey, its an easy thing to just say \"explosions\" for an insult, as if \nthere arent a multitude of other films with big effects....\n\nWell, interesting convo, I still think Edge of Tomorrow is dirt, but nice \nchat, good to see you involved in the community",
