The actual process takes much less \ntime: 30s checking if you are eligible to vote, 30s to give you all \nrequired paperwork, 30s to make your cross at the desired party/parties \n(you have two votes) and 30 seconds to put the form in the box. Why does it \ntake 6 hours to cast a vote in the US? Don't you have to do other things on \nthat day?\ufeff",

How the hell republicans doing this is not criticized \nby their party members is beyond me. I am NOT talking about voter ID, I \nhave no issue with the ID requirement. The issue is the closing of numerous \nplaces to go vote, fewer or elimination of Same-Day Registration, decrease \nearly voting days. Which means voters are being screwed out of their time \nbecause up to twice as many people could show up thus increasing voters in \nline. This is one of the reasons why our country is screwed up. Politicians \nshould not be doing this crap, its suppose to be fair & equal access to \nvoting facilities.\n\nGreat example is Ohio\u2019s Secretary of State Republican Jon Husted for the \n2012 election. This guy went around extending hours for voting republican \ncounties, while blocking democrat counties from doing the same. Along with \na lot of other things that are disgraceful. But here is the kicker.  It \ntook a FEDERAL JUDGE to order him to extend voting hours because Jon Husted \nis so unethical, immoral & un-American that he could not see what he was \ndoing was WRONG!",
