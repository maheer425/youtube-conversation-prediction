                "text": "BABYSITTING TIPS: \n1. Be fun! : if you are fun and cheerful with the child than they will beg \ntheir parents to hire you again! \n2. Know where everything is. : if an emergency happens you need to know \nwhere all the supplies are.\n3. MEAN IT. : if a child is being bad you CAN'T say something like \"if you \ndo that one more time I'm going to take away ALL your toys\" because the \nchild knows you don't really mean what you're saying. You SHOULD say \nsomething like \" stop acting like that right now or I will put you in time \nout.\"\n4. Get to know the kids. : if you know the kid(s) it will make them feel \nmore welcome and closer to you. You can ask them things like \"do you have \nany hobbies?\" \"What's your favorite T.V show?\" This way you will know the \nchild(ren) better. \n\nI hope that helped!\ufeff",

I babysat a 1 year old \nlittle boy and he'd cry for a little while and I just held and hugged him \nand he was fine after a minute or two. Distraction is key though (: \nDistract and console is what I do and it works. They don't stay upset for \nlong. In a daycare I worked at, one of the other workers had a 3 year old \nand he'd cry FOREVER. It was so bad that she put him in timeout and \nwouldn't let him out of timeout until he stopped crying. It sounds really \nharsh but it actually worked! Pretty soon, he stopped crying when his \nmother dropped him off. I don't know that I would do that...only if it was \nreally bad like this little boy. He would seriously cry for a good hour or \nmore at first.",

Plus, if you \nbabysit early in the morning, the child can remain sleeping and when it's \nbedtime/naptime, they have their own bed to sleep in. I have to turn down \nbabysitting jobs where the parents insist I babysit in my own home (I live \nwith my grandma and its too stressful for her) but its also super annoying \nbecause my house isn't child-proof and it sucks worrying about my things \ngetting broken. At least the parents have their house kid-proof, lol",
