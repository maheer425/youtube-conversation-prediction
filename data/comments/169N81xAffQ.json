Sexual excess leading to homosexuality and drug use to its \nown addiction but from personal experience I have seen an overlap in \nindividuals.\n The dramatic power of dopamine to interfere with free will and create \nsexual (and other) compulsions became clear when patients took drugs that \nimitate dopamine.For example,a Frenchman who took such a drug to control \nParkinson\u2019s symptoms recovered a large settlement from a pharmaceutical \ncompany after the medication temporarily gave him compul- sive homosexual \nurges. (He was straight when not on the meds.)192 Another Park- inson\u2019s \npatient suddenly found himself cross-dressing after seventy years of un- \neventful heterosexuality. When doctors decreased his dosage of the \ndopamine-like drug,the urge to put on his deceased wife\u2019s clothing \nevaporated.\n\nMaybe men like U.S.Senator Larry Craig,who insist that they aren\u2019t gay, yet \nengage in homosexual sex, are simply hooked on risky, high- dopamine \nencounters.(For the ultimate thrill,maybe Craig should try it while \nskydiving!) As one man explained,bathroom sex isn\u2019t really about gender \norientation.\n\n Homosexuality is an excess of dopamine CAUSED by a lifestyle choice. \nwww.reuniting.info/download/pdf/Cupid-Ch6.pdf",

Or thin, or big or small \nchested or of a certain race. Your personal visual cues for attraction are \nnot necessarily things that are considered \"beautiful\" by today's beauty \nstandards. Neither does it claim that one particular scent or voice \nresonates with you. You'll be attracted to someone that fills in the blanks \nthat you are missing genetically. Like to a certain ratio to their body \n(like broad shoulders, strong bone structure/limbs when you yourself are a \nstring bean), or to someone with a leptine deficiency who easilly stores \nfat if for instance your body tends to be better suited for ketonic \nmetabolism. It's just nature's way of telling you that this person's \ngenetic make-up and immune system would give your offspring the best \nchances on survival when combined. That's why a \"healthy\" smell for one is \nan unhealthy smell for another because our genetic make-up is different, \nand the way our body works often changes based on health issues and needs. \nOur health and body changes all the time. You may lack nutrients. You may \nhave a dissease. Your body is just telling you that \"this mate right now\" \nwould be a perfect match - right now -. That's why it can change overtime. \nBut only if you follow up on those unconscious cues. Voice for instance \ngives cues about amounts of testosterone. If you have lots you may need a \nmate that doesn't. And the sound of voice is a subconsious cue to that.\nMany people tend to focus on aestethical \"beauty\". And then they wonder why \nthey are not as attracted to a \"beautiful\" person as they thought they \nwould be, but got this unexplainable need for someone who might be \nconsidered \"ugly\" by others. :P\nThat's real attraction that is :)\n ",

I was knackered last night I don't think I \ntook in what you said properly :P \n\nThe point you didn't respond to was that we can't be sure if it's strictly \ntrue to say symmetry is attractive or whether there \nare subtleties/complexities because we don't know the exact mechanism in \nthe brain or if it's the same for everyone etc. Studies done trying to find \nwhat is attractive can't be much more thorough than surveys where people \npick the faces they are most attracted to. Which isn't all that accurate, \nIt's rough and inconclusive. Those studies can be useful of course, being \nsuggestive, leading to more studies, etc, but in terms of drawing \nconclusions they don't tell you 100% what constitutes attraction.\n\nOwen Wilson hasn't had a nose correction that was just a computer generated \nnose + jaw correction.\n\nThe page you linked.. i don't find Keira Knightley attractive at all, which \nI imagine is because she is anorexic (not in good health, not ideal for \nreproduction, nor survival, etc). Yet the men chose her as attractive. The \nmen who chose her likely did so for ingrained cultural reasons (weight \nloss/fitness/fashion industries idealizing overly thin body shapes and \nfaces). Which shows me that their attraction to her was subjective more \nthan anything. That is what I mean by the flaws in these studies.\n\nHere's an empirical angle on beauty: \nhttp://www.joomag.com/magazine/mag/0916630001387119885?feature=archive",

But it is one of few things you notice right away when you \nmeet someone for the first time.\n\nhttp://realdoctorstu.com/2011/03/16/the-science-of-attraction-what-makes-a-beautiful-face/\n\nIf you want to research more about the correlation of attractive faces, and \npaintings, look up nuroaesthetics.\n\nBTW proportion and balance are all aspects of symmetrical shape, lol....

Maybe it's \nabout facial muscles not being matched with the nose after the correction.\n\nHow can we know exactly what constitutes the attraction?
