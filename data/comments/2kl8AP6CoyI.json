I love cars, but I can't afford \nthe Porsches and Ferraris of the world. All my friends have WRX's and I \ndidn't want to go down that road. My first car was a 97 GTI and I Loved it! \nI have owned the Mustang Bullitt and a Boxster but both sucked in the snow. \nSo I got this 2015 GTI and love every second behind the wheel.\ufeff",

The car is a lot faster than the 220HP \nwould suggest, in fact, the car is actually underrated and has been dyno-ed \nwith 235 at the crank / 210 WHP, if there is traffic on the highway its \nhard to find places to fully utilize all the power. I wish there was more \ntraction in first gear as my car came with Pirelli Cinturato P7 tires. A \nswitch to summer tires should do it.\n\nTurn in and line holding is phenomenal. I had a few other cars before, \nLexus IS300, Acura RSX Type S (Integra), Honda Prelude, and this car has \nmuch better turn in and corner exit. I did not wait for the performance \npack but once you hit the apex you can just put on the power and it holds \nthe line.\n\nShifter a bitter notchy compared to Honda, but once I broke in the car it \nfelt much better. Pedals are excellent, interior quality is also excellent, \nI got the leather package and really it's nicer than the IS300 I bought \nbrand new back in the day.

Drag. All four wheels powering off of as launch \nare much better than two rear wheels.\n\nAround a track, RWD is king. Cars in the same class, lets say the M3 and \nRS4/5 as an example. Around the track, the M3 beats it. Formula one cars \nare rwd for a reason. Same with boring ass NASCAR, CART, and every other \ntrack car.\n\nThe steering is just superior in RWD. What happens when you exit a turn in \na RWD car? Well, when you know how to brake going into the turn and \naccelerate out, the car speeds away from the corner. You know what happens \ngoing into a corner in an AWD car? You have to start slowing down a second \nor two sooner to keep from wearing the brakes down or getting brake fade.  \nThe time made up exiting a corner in an AWD car doesn't make up for the \nseconds lost slowing into the turn.\n\nIt's funny though. The stuff I pull from my ass still makes more sense than \nthings you've put some thought into.\n\nBut I'd love to hear where you think it's a known fact awd cars are better \nin turns? There are exceptions, like say the GTR. But every review of \nalmost every AWD sports car has the same complaint. Cornering.",
