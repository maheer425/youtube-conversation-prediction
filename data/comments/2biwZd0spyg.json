                "text": "I fed my cat Alvin the cheap stuff from the grocery store and he was puking \nit up afterwards some nights. So I tried some better foods and did a lot of \nresearch and realized the food I was feeding him was like McDonald's and \nRamen noodles everyday. After I switch him to Hound and Gatos, which is a \npaleolithic food (no carbs, just meat), his fur got so soft and shiny! He \nhad more energy and he stopped puking up his dinner :-) (and his poop \nsmelled so much less stinky) I have tried to switch my kitties to a raw \ndiet but they didn't want to eat it unless I mixed in a good amount of a \nwet food they liked. I tried to gradually introduce it into their diet but \nthey were being picky and I ended up have to throw away a lot of food. \ufeff",

                "text": "It would be really nice but the problem is that dry food is much much \ncheaper than raw meat diets to the casual owner. Not everyone has a nice \nbutcher to go to and get personal meats. Many just have to go to a local \nWalmart, which arent accustomed to custom orders, because they dont get \nmany to begin with. Then theres the nutritional needs of the cat that seem \ncomplex to the casual owner. Taurine, crude fats, crude protien, etc get \nthrown around and not everyone knows exactly what those are, whats the \ndifference, whats better, and how much. Defaulting to the \"raw food\" \navailable in stores packaged specifically for cats.. well... right now they \nare reaping the benefits of a small market, and prices are very high. Not \nonly that, they still add certain items in there that cats dont need to \nhelp fill the space, reaping an even greater monetary income versus the \ncost of mass producing. \n\nWhat people also really misunderstand about dry food... is the hydration. \nRaw meats (and bones if you think about bone marrow) have a certain amount \nof liquid, water, or general fluids within. Cats get so dehydrated off \nwater and dry food because their normal partial-liquid-intake (meat) is \ndenied. If you could choose between eating a bowl of soup, or drinking 4 \ncups of water, chances are youd choose the soup. Its smaller, easier to get \ndown in one sitting, and tastes better. Makes sense for cats too. \n\nThat being said, I cant afford a totally raw-meat diet personally, myself, \nbut I do the best I can. They have dry food if theyre hungry as a backup, \nthey get at least a can of wet food a day (to share, because, I dont \nunderstand how they think 1 cat can eat a whole can in 1 setting. Mine cant \neven eat the whole can split between them, and I have some BIG cats!), and \ntheyll get meat cuttings whenever I prepare meat. The cuttings are probably \nabout 50-70% fat and the other 30-50% actual meat that was trimmed as well. \nSome like it, some dont. Just like some will also eat leaves off \nsalad-ingredients I buy and grass. Even with this half and half.. their \npoop still stinks to high heaven LOL. \ufeff",

                    "text": "Ive just combed through their site on cat nutrition and the recipes \ninvolved. \"Ideally, you want to get meat that is antibiotic and hormone \nfree, and free-range if possible. Get organic meats if you can\" these are \nvery expensive compared to other items that we (humans) would even consume. \n\"You definitely want to get liver\"-\"Preferably from a free-range animal, \nwith no hormones or antibiotics used.\" - again, \"expensive\" compared to the \nnorm used, and Ive only ever seen 1 package/brand of liver in my local \nstores that I shop at, which leads me to believe it would be hard to find. \n\"chicken hearts, which can be difficult to source\" - the site says they can \nbe found most often at \"ethnic food stores\" or \"Korean supermarkets\". I \nhave no Korean supermarkets near me, and ethnic food stores are rare here. \nPlus, if the point is to get mostly antibiotic/hormone free, and free range \nmeats, then why skimp on this ingredient and \"not care\" about the specifity \nof it simply because its hard to find, which it is. \"Buy free-range eggs, \npreferably organic\". At this point, the recipe for \"raw meat diet\" for cats \neats/costs easily three times as much. o.o\n\nThen theres all the nutrients needed. Taurine, salmon oil (which I know is \nexpensive. I just bought this bottle about 1/3 the size of a coke can, and \nit cost me 10$ - imagine having to buy enough for the recipe! This was a \ntiny bottle - cheaper than the capsules as well, to which the recipe calls \nfor all capsules), Vitamin B complex, E, Lite Salt with Iodine, and \nPsyllium Husk Powder. \n\nI understand the broken down cost per-meal is \"cheaper\" for each resulting \npound, but the point is that you cant just buy \"half a capsule\" of salmon \noil for the recipe. No, you have to buy the bottle of capsules. For \neverything. Buying 1 chicken thigh is far more expensive per thigh than \nbuying 10, but buying 10 you pay 7 or 8 times the price. \n\nSo actually looking at the recipe and ingredients, I can verily argue that \nit can quite possibly be far too \"expensive\" for the casual pet owner to \nget started. Were talking maybe 20$ a month for the \"best\" dry food, \nversus.. well lets say all vitamins cost the same as the salmon oil so.. 6 \nvitamins (60$). The chicken for the recipe might cost 15$ for a set of 6-8 \ndepending on the size, each recipe set requires chicken hearts at 3$ a \npound (I didnt look at the \"set\" prices for those), Liver (again, I dont \nbuy this regularly so I didnt look at the costs, but it says nearly 3$ a \npound), and eggs, which are cheap 4$ total. The site says for a 10 lb cat, \nabout 4 oz of this food is the right amount, but the bare minimum recipe \nitself only makes 17 oz. Theres no way to tell how many chicken hearts or \nlivers the recipe uses, because it all goes by oz. So, I will assume it \ntakes at least 1 chicken heart. The recipe only makes about 4 days of \nfood.. for one cat. So on top of the 60$ in vitamins, and all the meat \ncosts, the initial recipe only makes a few days of food for one cat (to \nwhich I will note a lot of owners dont just have one cat, they usually have \ntwo or three - which makes this a 2 day meal recipe). Lets not forget this \nwhole process requires that the owner have a MEAT GRINDER capable of also \ngrinding bones. This can easily cost 150$ for a decent quality machine that \nwont break down after a few months of constant cat-food use. To which I \nwould say, you would want to get the higher quality one, simply because \nthis cat diet requires constant use of the grinder. \n\nMaybe this helps explain why it would be hard for the \"casual\" owner to \nBEGIN this process. Im sure once the process is started, those initial \ncosts disappear, as the rest of it is using items you mostly already have, \nand maintaining your stockpile of them - but hopefully this kind of \nexplains it. \n\nAgain this is coming from an owner of several cats, who wishes she could \nafford a 100% raw meat diet, but has actually looked at the costs, and \nunderstands right now, it is not feasible.\n\nTL;DR Version: Initial costs of items/ingredients/machines (vitamins at 10$ \neach, meat grinder at 150$, and \"hard to find\" meat items such as chicken \nhearts, rabbit, and liver) to begin a raw meat diet are far more expensive \nthan maintaining a dry/canned food diet - which is most likely the reason \nso many people feed their cats dry/canned instead of converting to this \nhealthier \"raw meat diet\".",

Im sure if you \nhad one cat, this would be manageable to an extent, but I personally have \nmore than one, and buying enough for each one to feel full and not hungry \nwould take quite a bit. Thats not even mentioning some like bacon, or red \nmeat, or pork, and not chicken. Some like fish and dry food and nothing \nelse. I also do buy sale meats on the rare occasion I see the min the \nsupermarkets, but I think the difference is areas. If your areas has a \nbutchery or place where you can get custom meats and orders, and the spare \nbits, then its great, but not every place has them. Thats all I mean to \nexplain. \n\nBut I think the important thing here is that we are well-aware of the \"raw \nmeat diet\" for cats, and we know how important it is, and are trying to get \nas close to it as we can. Its better than not knowing at all and not trying \nat all. ",

It smells SOOOo delicious to \ncats, which is why they may seem to love dry foods (especially things like \nParty Mix, or the other snack-y ones). So you never can truly know, with \ndry food at least, if your cat really likes it, or if they just super \ncoated it with this tasty substance.. :/\n\nThat being said, I do now buy my cats... I think its Purina Naturals? Idk, \nthe food is very tiny (looks like kitten food), and is a green color. At \nfirst I did it because its green (Im tired of red puke stains on my tan \ncarpets, and green seems to not stain it) and tiny, so it makes me feel \nbetter when they dont sit there and wince as they crunch big pieces apart, \nbut they seem to really love it. We call it \"Kitty Cookies\". But I even use \nthis as \"snack\" food. I put out a decent amount (maybe a cup, maybe cup and \nhalf) when they get that 1 can they share that i described.
