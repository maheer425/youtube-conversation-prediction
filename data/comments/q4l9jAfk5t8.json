The moon is white and does not have an atmosphere, the astronauts \nhave to wear special screens on their helmets that work like sunglasses \nbecause it is so incredibly bright on the moon due to a lack of atmosphere \nand the moon being white. A similar thing can happen on earth using snow \ncalled snow blindness because the white snow reflects light and makes the \narea abnormally bright. tl;dr You cant see stars from the moon because its \nreally bright on the moon's surface.

If they however took the picture on the dark side \nthey would show up, or they could have changed the camera settings so you \ncould see the stars, but that would make the moons surface look flat, pale \nand white.

Now, the hollow \nearth theory can't possibly true, and there are a host of reasons why. \n\nOne of the most central ones, is that we've sent electromagnetic waves \nthrough the earth, from one side to the other. Now, we can detect the wave \nfrom the other side of the world, but it's frequency and wavelength will be \naltered, aswell as other qualities. As a result, we can use this to deduct \nthe composition of the earth and the varying densities of the earths \ninterior. \n\nAnd our results do not point to an empty interior, they point to a solid \nearth filled with molten rock, and extremely dense rock at the core.\n\nThat in itself is all that is required to denounce \"hollow earth\" theories \nas complete BS, there is absolutely no evidence for hollow earth, and we've \nliterally checked the earth's composition and densities, so yeah.\n\nYou may ask me to cite my evidence, but this is something you can literally \nfind in a GCSE textbook, and you have google at your finger tips.\n\nAnd if you're still not convinced, there are a whole host of other reasons \nto why the earth couldn't possibly be hollow, aside from the fact it's a \nrather silly idea in itself. Another example is the earth would not have \nalmost no gravitational pull whatsoever if it were hollow, and most of the \nearth's mass is in the core. Hence if we were just a crust, then we'd have \nnegligible gravitational attraction. ",

We can take more and more accurate values of length, but we never \nget to the ultimate length of said string.

They're trying to go back there by 2020 \nand they're building the Aries series of Rockets to do that job. \n\nAnyways, prove to me that I'm not right.  Put forth to the table the one \npiece of evidence that 100% says that we didn't land on the moon and we \nfaked it? I can give you a list about the length of my forearm of why it's \nNOT faked and, on the very top of that list, it's the Soviet Union's \nsilence on the landings that leads the most convincing evidence that it was \nreal. If it wasn't real, then the Soviet Union would have called bullshit \nand threw out the evidence to prove their point, but they didn't. \n\nThen, if you account for the fact that we spent BILLIONS of Dollars in \norder to develop the rockets powerful enough and the equipment necessary to \nactually land on the moon, then why fake it? It would have been a colossal \nwaste of  money if it was simply faked. \n\nThen, most of the things that people use as a counter can be discounted by \nbasic understandings of the Lunar atmosphere, gravity, and light \nphenomenon. \n\nFinally, the most damning evidence to prove the landing theory is the fact \nthat we can detect where we had  landed on the moon because we left a \nreflector on the moon that, when fired at by a laser from Earth, we can \ndetect a slightly higher spike, which is noticeable compared to the \nbackground light received, in light received back. This is undeniable \nevidence to support that we had landed on the moon. ",
