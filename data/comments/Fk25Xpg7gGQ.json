Seriously?\n\nYou can do all the chest beating you want, but the fact that the US is the \ncurrent military and economic leader (although as an economic area the EU \nalready outperforms the US but as the EU is not a country you can keep that \ntittle) does not mean all of your policies are sensible.

You have power and relevance \nfor sure, but that doesn't make you guys infallible on issues of policy.\n\nSo yeah, I'll take my irrelevant country with its better functioning \nsystems and at large more sensible policies over the clusterfuck that is \ncurrent day US any day of the week, and I'll outsource the \"your country is \nirrelevant\" -dickwaving to people like you.",

If \nthey aren't going to push to relax the drinking age for the states it's \nprobably not going to happen for military personnel on base. Allowing \nunderaged drinking on bases really didn't work out so well and surrounding \ncommunities complained because the service members didn't always stay on \nthe bases after drinking. \n\nPersonally, I think that if you are in the military you should have the \nright to drink alcohol regardless of your age. (In the past it was possible \nto get in at 17 with signed parental permission. I'm not sure that is still \ntrue now that they attempting to draw down the military a bit). If there \nare problems because of that there are other ways of dealing with them \nbesides just banning it for everyone. ",
