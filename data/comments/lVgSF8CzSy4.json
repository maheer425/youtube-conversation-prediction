                "text": "The guy discussing flash trading in this video is making shit up to sell a \nbook.  I worked as a proprietary trader for many years, and hearing him \ntalk about this stuff in such a misleading way, and using your average \nviewers ignorance of day-trading, *to make it seem like some big scam is \ngoing on*, is painful.  It's sad that Cenk takes it at face-value with no \nreal understanding of what day-trading entails.  Is there corruption in the \nfinancial market?  You bet your ass there is, but it's not from flash \ntrading, credit trading, and chop-shop daytraders.  Market trading, ECN's, \nand such are regulated to the extreme, and in a good way, so they \nconstantly have regulatory changes to help keep things balanced and working \nproper.\nThe majority of this flash trading is bot programs running, they're not \npersonally going \"ahead\" of you and buying your order and selling it back.  \nIt's a fucking stock exchange, you CHOOSE where you want to buy.  You can \npunch in and pay the price of buying NOW, or you can try and get a better \nprice by putting an order out at a better price, and waiting to get \nfilled.  You can put an order to buy at the $1 mark of a $30 stock.  And it \nprobably will never get filled.  This doesn't mean people buying at the \nlevel 2 price are cheating you.  To anyone who has any basic knowledge \nabout day-trading or investing, what he says in that short video clip is \nlaughably stupid.  Does having a good internet connection and being \ngeographically closer to the exchange give you an infinitesimally small \nadvantage ?  Yes it does, but your average joe isn't punching in with \nhundreds of thousands in worth of stock, in and out, at the blink of an \neye.  So he doesn't care.  All he cares about is that that volume is there, \nto make his much smaller trades, safe to actually make.\nAgain, the reason why day-trading can be profitable for a regular joe, is \nspecifically because the amount of extra size and volume this type of \ntrading brings in.  Remember, more volume is good for your average joe, it \nmakes a stock safer to trade on.  If you're trading on a stock without a \nlot of day-traders and bots holding at prices, the stock wildly fluctuates, \nand you lose money and get pushed out scarily fast.   And what he says \nabout \"front-running\" is atrociously stupid.  Anyone can subscribe to a \nlevel 2 quotes service, and pay money to have access to a few ECN's to \ntrade with, and see where all the orders are sitting at.  *THAT IS WHAT \nDAY-TRADING IS*.  So yes, even you can pay for said services, and see this \nexact same thing on your home computer. (Which he's inferring is a way of \n\"cheating\" lol)\nWhen you invest through your bank, the people at the bank have some level \nof this quote service as well.  Except the bank covers the cost of using \nECN's, and whatever else they're subscribing to, by charging YOU an \nexorbitant amounts per-trade, and having ridiculous spreads you have to \nfill just to start making money.  The only real scam with investing in the \nstock market, is when you have middle-men like banks come in, and try to \nmanage your money for you, and make money off your gains with stupidly big \nspreads.\n\n*Short version*:  Google a \"level 2 quote system \" and look at pictures of \nthem.  This is not a cheat or some scam.  That's how day trading is done.  \nYou can use it and do it from home yourself if you have a few hundred \nthousand dollars you don't mind risking. \ufeff",

What is the equivalent of \n\"operating costs\" for individual human beings? The expenses you have to pay \nto stay alive, healthy, functioning. You don't get to deduct these. In \nfact, what you pay as an individual human being for your 'operating \nexpenses' constitutes the private profit of corporations.\n\nNicely balanced world. Imagine now how this system of social relations \npermeates the value set, the political and economic system, and forms the \nsubstrate everything in civilization. You must create profit for \ncorporations to stay alive, and this is not only the fact, but is \ndetermined by the ruling class to be right and correct.\n\nAll this will remain true until we change it.\ufeff",

While depressions did \noccur, the free market ended them quickly. The (forgotten) Great Depression \n1920 started out much worse when compared to the Great Depression of 1930 - \nwhich was caused by the Federal Reserve (Helicopter Ben says exactly this). \nThe Forgotten Depression was over in 18 months, that was when the Fed did \nnothing, the 1930 Depression was extended by the federal reserve and ended \nin a World War. Not to mention ALL (and then some) of our productive gains \nare stolen by the State via their ability to sell bonds and print money.\n\nThe Central Banks allow the middle class to indulge it's base desires by \nvoting for politicians who steal from tomorrow to buy votes today. The \nGovernment was LIMITED for a reason. \n\nAs an example, an NFL stadium built in 1960s at a cost of 20 million and \ndemolished in 1990, still cost the children born in 1980 (who never even \nused it) $40 million in 2010.\n\nYou can think whatever you want I honestly do not care and know I won't \nchange anyone's mind. To do that we'd need to discuss logic vs rationalism \nand that isn't possible. So, go down to the magic polling booth and vote \nO-blah-blah again, or Hitlary or whomever you're told who to vote for. It \nisn't going to matter one bit. Politicians do not create wealth - free \npeople do. And thanks to Progressivism, we are no longer a free people. So, \nit's just a slow decline of our standard of living. Being a doctor, I'm not \ntoo worried at all. I am the people who will tell you what you can and can \nnot do. I'm the so-called Progressive you think you need to be your Master. \n\nOh, well, 6 years down, about 25 years of slow agonizing painful decrease \nin standard of living to go. \n\nProgressives have good intentions.

Let's \nsay you want to sell 100 shares of Microsoft, and people around the world \ncombined want to sell 10,000 shares of Microsoft. Then, if someone wants to \nbuy 100 shares of Microsoft, they buy it from the big pot, and the amount \nof stock you sell is proportional to the total being sold. So in this case, \nyou'd sell 1 share to this buyer, because your shares represent 1% of the \n10,000 shares available. You can also put in the highest/lowest price you \nwant to buy/sell for, that way you can just put however much money or \nhowever many shares you want into the system, tell it to buy/sell at the \nprice you want, and let it be. If nobody buys within your range, you won't \nbe included in the pool, so you wont lose stock or get money. If nobody \nsells within your range, the computer will wait with your money until it \nfinds the stock at the price you want, or you tell it to do something else \nwith your money. If your demands are unreasonable, the stock price will \nnever get to where you want it, and you'll either be waiting forever, or \nyou'll have to come back and change the price you set. If you want to buy \nor sell immediately, you can set it to trade at the market price, which \nwould be determined by computer algorithms based on the prices at which the \nstock is trading.\nThis system would be set up and run by the government, and it would be \nhighly regulated to make sure nobody hacks the system. Backups and security \nfeatures would protect against a system crash. It could even be run by an \nintergovernmental organization, such as the UN, EU, or G7. Since it's \ngovernment, it would either be maintained with tax dollars, or a small \nmembership fee, or a small transaction fee (like 1%.) \ufeff",

We already \nhave some, of course, but almost any new infrastructure that is being built \nis probably being built for the rich. \nYou can cut out almost all of what you said and just keep a transaction \nfee.  That alone would change *everything*.  But, amusingly, 1% would be \nconsidered much too high for a transaction fee.  There are a number of \ncountries that already have a transaction tax, but for the vast majority of \nthem, they are less than 0.5%, and yet that is actually more than enough.  \nMost of the money made on Wall Street is done through \"leveraging\", which \nis when you take out a loan so that you can put more money on a bet.  \nTypically Wall Street functions on 1/10 of one-percentage point with they \nrefer to as \"points\".  So 0.5% with regard to anything is \"5 points\". \nMuch of their trading is based on how confident they are that there will be \nsome change in value of a few points.  If you bet $1,000 on a 1-point bet, \nthen you'd only make a dollar.  But if you borrow $10,000,000 and put all \nof that on the same bet, then you'd get $10,000, and you can just give back \nthe $10,000,000 that you borrowed.  That's pretty much what they are doing \nthere when they are not busy rigging the market or trying to trick people \ninto given them money.  When you hear about all the money they are betting, \nthat's what it is referring to.  And what happens if instead of a +1-point \nchange, there is a negative 100-point change?  Well, they end up losing a \nmillion bucks that is usually due, immediately. \nPeople get burned there all the time, but what usually happens is that if \nyou have an underling, then you would have already placed the blame on him \nor somehow left him holding the hot potato.  So even if you make it, on \nyour own, to Wall Street and start trying to make it big, you usually end \nup having to start off as someone's bitch who works you 100 hours a week, \nand is constantly trying to trick you into doing things (while showing you \nhow they are so smart at tricking other people). \nThe 2008 crash is what happens when that hot potato gets so big that only \nthe really big boys can hold it, and so they end up getting stuck with it.
