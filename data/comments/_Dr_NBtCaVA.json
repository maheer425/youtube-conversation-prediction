                    "text": "+Walter White \nBelieve me i used to be one of those people who use to defend Islam , i \nheard a lot of opinions about what the Quran teaches but Then one day i \nwanted to learn the truth and find out myself what it really says .So then \ni started researching the Quran and to be honest ,The more i read the Quran \nthe less i liked Islam .But hey you don`t have to believe me you can \nresearch this stuff your self .Here are just some of the verses you \nrequested to see .If you want you can go to a website call Skeptic's \nAnnotated Quran on that site you can see all the good things and the bad \nthings that are written in the Quran .  \n\n\n\nQuran (2:244) - \"Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah \nHeareth and knoweth all things.\"\n \nQuran (2:216) - \"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it \nis possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love \na thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.\"  Not \nonly does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also \ncontradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since \nthe audience was obviously not under attack at the time.  From the Hadith, \nwe know that this verse was narrated at a time that Muhammad was actually \ntrying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot.\n \nQuran (3:56) - \"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with \nterrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have \nanyone to help.\"\n \nQuran (3:151) - \"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the \nUnbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had \nsent no authority\".  This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also \nincludes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad \nincorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').\n \nQuran (4:74) - \"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of \nthis world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain \nor be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.\"  The martyrs of \nIslam are unlike the early Christians, led meekly to the slaughter.  These \nMuslims are killed in battle, as they attempt to inflict death and \ndestruction for the cause of Allah.  Here is the theological basis for \ntoday's suicide bombers.\n \nQuran (4:76) - \"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah\u2026\"\n \nQuran (4:89) - \"They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and \nthus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their \nranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if \nthey turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and \n(in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.\"\n \nQuran (4:95) - \"Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive \nno hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their \ngoods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who \nstrive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at \nhome). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive \nand fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special \nreward,-\"  This passage criticizes \"peaceful\" Muslims who do not join in \nthe violence, letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah's eyes. \n It also demolishes the modern myth that \"Jihad\" doesn't mean holy war in \nthe Quran, but rather a spiritual struggle.  Not only is the Arabic word \nused in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything \nspiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption.  (The Hadith \nreveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man's \nprotest that he is unable to engage in Jihad and this is reflected in other \ntranslations of the verse).\n \nQuran (4:104) - \"And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you \nsuffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain...\"  Is \npursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense?",

Your argument is I'm \npicking on halal and kosher for slaughters animals in a torturous way while \nconscious - originally, you deny evidence of people doing it, now you deny \nit occurs at all. Here is the wikipedia entry on halal and kosher. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Islamic_and_Jewish_dietary_laws#Similarities. \nHere's a news article on the fact it occurs, and with growing and not \nshrinking frequency \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/growth-in-slaughter-of-nonstunned-animals-is-unacceptable-7715790.html. \nHere's halal advocates, a website supporting halal meats. \nhttp://halaladvocates.net/site/our-issues/stunning-animals/ They state \nlittle halal meat exists in north america (which MAY be true as there are \nfar less muslims here then overseas, and I do only notice about 5% of the \nmarket near my location as selling meats labeled halal and kosher - but \nthey back no facts or statistics and everything else I found was court \ncases striking down bannings on non-stunned animal slaughters as being a \nform of religious discrimination). Notice however at the end, where they \nSPECIFICALLY advocate that all muslims try to get all meats killed without \nstunning.\n\nThis is the issue here. You basically closed your eyes and yelled \"No no no \nyou're wrong they do stun animals!\" when it is extremely evident that they \ndo not. The reason I said go see the video is because it shows you how \nhorrible a non-stunned slaughter is (Again, I'm personally against all \nforms of meat eating, but I believe that the worst forms should be banned \nwhile others should be only discouraged). Now. For yet another time. They \nDO keep animals unstunned. What the hell weird defence are you going to \ncome up with next.\n\n2) \"if I can't explain to you why your logic is false then there's no point \nus talking.\"\n\nPlease. Please tell me how my logic that killing an animals while it's \nawake by bleeding it to death isn't a horrible way to kill the animal when \nwe can knock it unconscious right away. Your entire disagreement with me \nwas founded on your uneducated belief that halal meats are stunned - which \nby everything I see from all the laws specifically saying you don't need to \nstun halal meats and the fact that halal certification in most countries is \nonly handed out if the animal is not stunned, makes no sense.\n\n3) \"Just try to lay off the discrimination by repeatedly mentioning halal \nand kosher over other kinds of slaughter,\"\n\nI'm being discriminatory in the same way saying \"Murderers have killed \npeople\" is being discriminatory. Sure, I'm saying everyone who killed \nsomeone has killed someone, lumping everyone who's killed someone with \neveryone else who's killed someone. . . But yeah, it's a factual matter and \nnot a discriminatory matter. I'd be opposed to none-religious people who \nslit their animals' throats while conscious too, as that's my objection to \nhalal and kosher - not the praying over it (which is just insult to injury \nin my opinion). And since matter of fact statements aren't discriminatory, \nI'm therefor not being discriminatory.\n\n4) \"I shouldn't have to repeat myself but they now knock the animals \nunconscious before carrying out the slaughter,\"\n\nActually, you should say it again. Reality needs to beat some sense into \nyou a bit more, because you're obviously delusional on this subject matter.\n\nNow watch you not read anything I said and scream about how I'm the idiot \nagain.",

What statistics? The process of halal and \nkosher slaughters are exactly what the videos show. Every halal and kosher \nshop follows this because that IS halal and kosher.\n\nThis is an emotional appeal you idiot. You're counter argument doesn't make \nsense. This is like you arguing that waterboarding isn't torture even \nthought it's describe as torture, the US has admitted to doing it, and the \nvideos show you how bad it is, because you argue the video doesn't prove \namerica does it - you're missing the point.\n\nWhat's your argument then? That halal ISN'T defined as slicing an animal's \nthroat and letting it slowly die over 5 minutes? That's the definition of \nwhat it is - go see the video to see how disgusting it is and WHY you \nshould be against it.\n\n3) \"STOP USING EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.

Halal's process \nis horrible on paper, you just see how much WORST it is when you see a \nvideo of it. That's the difference here. You're, again, basically arguing \nthat cigs cartons shouldn't have pictures of people who got sick from cigs \non them because that's emotional blackmail. It is. It tells you exactly how \nhard cigs will hurt you - that part isn't made up, it's just you never see \nit.

I wouldn't \nchange my opinion just because a (rightfully) hated person has that opinion.\n\nExplain to me how criticizing something that no-one can really deny is \ntorture (picture for two seconds if someone did this to a human and explain \nto me how that's then not torture) is causing people damage.",

'While people laugh at it and/or hoist it up by a leg [while] in pain \nand/or kick blood in it's face' These are cases of sadism that is totally \nunlinked to halal. There is no need for it in halal and hence it 'can' be \nthe case with all slaughters. That being said (bearing in mind I have never \nworked in a slaughterhouse, and probably have the same amount of background \nknowledge as you on the matter) I highly doubt that is regularly the case, \ncertainly not enough to label all slaughterers as sadists. Ultimately it \nseems that you are trying to argue your point through emotional blackmail \nand misinformation, and the ends never justify the means which ever side of \nthe fence you stand on.",
