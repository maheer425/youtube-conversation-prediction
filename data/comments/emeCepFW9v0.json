Instead they are just extras for a scene or two.\n\nThat was ridiculously disappointing.\n\nBesides, Kenny's arc is almost the same from season 1, but watered down. He \nappears with a new girlfriend, she dies, he grieves and loses his temper, \npeople get scared of him, he sacrifices himself for redemption. The only \nnew element here is that his actions are really harsher and grittier than \nseason 1. But couldn't they just use a new character? Couldn't they, I \ndon't know, use Omid, instead of killing him off? Or Christa? Couldn't \nChrista be the one who appears after being considered dead? Couldn't she be \nthe one grieving the lost of her loved ones? Couldn't she grew harsher and \nmore cynical as the games goes by? It would develop her WITHOUT spoiling \nKenny or repeating his character arc.\n\nI really want to love Season 2, or at least like it. But the more I \nremember season 2, the more I see wasted potential, The more I see how it \ncould easily be great, but instead became \"meh\".\n\nSeason 1 ending was incredible because it left us with a little hope \nknowing that, even if humans could become horrible monsters, at least there \nwould be those who would never allow themselves to sacrifice their humanity.\n\nSeason 2 ending left me with the bitter realization that basically everyone \nthere were disgusting assholes, even those who I actually liked and \nsympathized.",

And they \nexecute to near-perfection in season 1. \nThe player feels the weight of every choice and is immersed so heavily in \nthe relationship of Lee and Clementine, as well as the relationships of the \ngroup, that the player doesn't see past that illusion.\nIn season 2, the writing and execution was so piss poor that it wasn't an \n\"either / or\" choice it was \"How do you want us to kill this character \nright now?\" and it was painfully obvious.  This was also paired with the \nteasing of choice that didn't exist. \nThe illusion was so thin, and so lackluster that the player never invested \nin the experience. It was just a filler episode of \"meh, let's see where \nthis goes\" at best. \nThis is proven by the overwhelming majority of people I've seen commenting \non the game, whether they liked it or not, all saying basically the same \nthing, something to the effect of  \"the writing was not as good and \neverything felt incredibly scripted\".\n\n\nYou kill off characters to provide immersion, and show that choice matters \nin a gritty realistic setting that makes a point of killing off characters \nfor that reason, and reality doesn't magically alter the rules because \npeople identify with those characters.  As with most of the other deaths in \nthe game, it's supposed to make you feel the weight of those decisions and \nhow you can fuck up.\n\nAn 11 year old, on her own, with a 1-2 month old baby, and no formula, is \nnot going to be able to care for that infant, in the setting provided. \nAt the very least, AJ starves to death and Clem succeeds on her own -- at \nthe very worst AJ cries because he is hungry and both of them die.\nThe consequences of going it alone.\n\nIn Kenny's ending, they have sucking / openly bleeding wounds, have no food \nor other supplies, insufficient weather gear (a light jacket will not \nprotect you from hypothermia in the area of the U.S. they were at), had a \nlimited idea of where they were going, were traveling through moderately \ndeep snow and were something like 200-300 miles away from their destination.\nPeople die of hypothermia in those conditions after 1-3 days, let alone the \nminimum 2 weeks it would take to get to their destination.\nA consequence of trusting Kenny, who was a toxic presence (even if somewhat \nrelateable at times) for the entirety of season 2, and following a terrible \nplan,  without proper planning and preparation, hoping that everything \nworks out in the end.\n\nInstead we get endings that break the game's own rules, setting, and most \nimportantly, theme.",

The Walking Dead uses its status as a video \ngame and ability to have the player interact with the story to draw the \nplayer into the world itself, allowing one to have an emotional response to \nthe game that they wouldn't otherwise. In The Walking Dead, gameplay and \nstory are intertwined completely and totally, so much that one would not \nexist without the other, and both sides are enhanced for it. \n\nPeople who say that things like The Walking Dead and Heavy Rain \"aren't \nactually video games\" are narrow-minded to the extreme.
