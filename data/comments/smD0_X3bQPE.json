If you \ncame and you were poor that's honestly your own fault unless you were the \nvictim of a scam, refugee, orphan, illegal or unforeseeable bankruptcy via \na startup business.\n I've never been turned down for any job i've applied to. My mom was an \nimmigrant who worked her ass off to get her papers and both of my parents \nare paying for 2 years of my University. It's pretty easy to get a few \nschool based scholarships if you take the time to write the essays and or \nvolunteer.\nWe take at least one vacation a year in or outside of the country. My \nfamily's healthcare is great, my mom had breast cancer and the insurance \ncovered nearly all of it. We're not wealthy sooo i'm not sure what you're \non about...\n\n I think the fact that they do not care how employees represent their \nestablishment is kind of undisciplined. As far as corruption, even Denmark \nhas some not so much in the same sense as America, but in bribery.\n\n Have you ever been to America? I like our massive melting pot, I think all \nthe cultures and foods are great and they're readily available everywhere. \nAlso ahah Denmark is really freakin tiny.. It's smaller than my state lol.. \n Somehow I doubt the set-ups these tiny european countries have will work \nwhen most of them are smaller than even half the 50 states combined. \nhttp://goeurope.about.com/od/europeanmaps/l/bl-country-size-comparison-map.htm\n\nhttp://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/US/DK",

America is incredibly poor country regarding  health \ncare and free colleges etc. In my country college is free, we get Money for \ntaking an education (I am literally paying my Apartment on these Money and \nmy food clothes etc.), we get free health care, we're allowed to say and do \nwhatever without our jobs having allowance to fire us for it, our police \nisnt corrupt either etc. etc. etc...\n\nI actually did make the point of our school system and general system in \nour country before.\n\nThe thing about being able to see boobs and hear cursewords in my daily day \nto day is not that it is boobs and curse Words...
