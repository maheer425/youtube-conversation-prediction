What my point is, this homeless man made an effort to better himself, \nhe worked hard to make it. I don't consider what this man got, laptop, \nbooks, and training, handouts. To him they are the tools to change his \nsituation. Plus, he didn't go \"asking\" for it, it was given to him. Which \nis different. Also, it isn't so much the homeless that are asking for \nhandouts, otherwise they probably wouldn't be homeless. \n\nYou are correct, Patrick's humanity is also an example we should all \nfollow. If everyone would follow the example of both the men and the woman \nfrom Google the world would be a better place.\n\nThanks for pointing out the part that I did not focus on.",

It's not entirely \nabout how to overcome poverty; it's about how an act of kindness and \ngoodwill payed off, as well as being good to your fellow man. The homeless \nguy is a person and Patrick treated him as a person who needed help. If \nanything HE is the example to follow. Look how the woman from google \nfollowed his example and gave the homeless man her laptop. Patrick's \nhumanity spread. Try to learn from his example and not be so quick to judge \npeople who might be \"asking for a handout\". That image of homeless people \nis starting to get tired!",

In this day and age, children can program apps that are \nworth millions of dollars to tech companies, the fact that he can barely \ncode an app for a smart phone shows that he lacks any true talent and \nwouldn't even be noticed if not for the novelty of a homeless guy knowing a \nbit of code.  The reason I suggest that he should pick up a hard life skill \nis because while he's simply a novelty at programming, he might be able to \nbreak his back as a construction worker or other labor-intensive job for \nyears to come and earn the American dream.  It's incredibly doubtful that \nhe'll ever be able to earn any money from coding, since there's a surplus \nof talent in the market now, once the novelty wears off he's going to find \nhis skills not only outdated, but primitive in comparison to today's \ncurrent engineers.  \n\nWhile I can understand defending your craft, you people definitely fit the \nstereotype of the angry, virginal computer nerds I've heard so much about \nin the US.  It's amazing how many of your commented on a single post, \nalbeit poorly worded, of mine.  Sad really...\n\n+AG Entertainment Your comment was so stupid I felt the need to reply \nspecifically to you.  To answer your question, the reason I don't do \nconstruction is because I have mastered my talents to such a degree that I \nearn money and public recognition from them.  I don't do something as a \nnovelty that will never be up to par.  To highlight my point, my name has \nbeen in the #1 selling record in the US...what have you done with your \nlife?  Even if, by some miracle you've had kids, in 1000 lifetimes they'd \nnever equal, or be remembered half-as-well as, what I've done in a half a \nlife.  ",
