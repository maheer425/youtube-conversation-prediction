If not for the \nmaddening MCT (as per reviews) I would have bought it already.\n- new 2015 C63 AMG is not coming very soon, and probably it will come with \nthe same MCT.\n- M3 - should be very good, but IMO the bumpers are too busy and it looks \ntoo purposely (flashy?) sporty, at the expense of style. 435i looks so much \ncleaner and thus better. Am I alone here?\n- 435i - looks great, but a sedan would be better for me, and I would not \nmind 4.5sec acceleration. Would not mind the manual. Though the 8-speed ZF \nshifts without lagging.\n- m235i - ditto.\n- 335i - kinda bland and not that fast.\nSo, should I grab the current C63? Which is a better car? Thoughts? Better \nmake a decision before they take me to a mental house :D\ufeff",
