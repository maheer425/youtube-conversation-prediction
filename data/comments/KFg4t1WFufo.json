                "text": "Hey.\nYou know... since I was a little girl, I always envied black girls hair. It \nwas a kind of obsession of mine. Because my hair is curly... really \ncurly... and because I got some racist remarks about it from my own family \n(and Im white, but my hair dosent behave like a good white girl's hair) I \nalways thought I was entitled to ask black women about their hair and ask \nto touch it... Im brazilian, but I lived in vancouver for some months and I \nwas always the only curled haired person in the room and a lot of people \nasked me to touch my hair. At the beginning it was finny, but that \nobsession in touching me builded up a bit and I didnt like all that \nattention to it. You know, my hair has its own life, believes and \nparticularities... al those people touching it was making my hair sad and \nlosing my curls... Anyways, I watched a video by you about the issue of \nblack woman's hair and two things happened: 1. I identified a bit (because \nof vancouver) and I stopped asking to touch people's hair. I am sorry if I \nwas stupid. No, I still a stupid person, but doing at least one last stupid \nthing. One last thing: sorry for my bad english.\ufeff",
