He thought it was absolutely \n*hilarious* and it's obvious to anyone who watches him that *that* is the \nkind of comedy he wishes to make with his sketch comedy videos with \nCyndago.

I remember the \nfirst one that I ever read that was yaoi was from a fan-mde dojinshi (or \nsomething like that) for the show Hetalia.  I'm glad that, despite you not \nbeing a fan, that you're still polite to the fans of it! :)\n\n+Zoe Wee Junjou Romantica was my first yaoi anime and I was terrified after \nthe first ten minutes. Not because of the gay couples, rather because I \ndidn't expect it to progress like that! However, its one of my favorites, \nin fact I even read the manga!  ",

Truthfully I also didn't like the idea of them \nbeing exposed to the yaoi genre because I was worried that my fujoshi \nfriends would get their heart broken for seeing some reactors doing their \nover-exaggerrative disagreeing to animated BL.\nRandom Confession: I used to think Yaoi was gross, but recently I thought I \nshould understand why some of my close friends are so into it, so I made an \neffort to read up some mangas on my own. Weirdly, the first BL material I \nread was a NaruSasu doujin. Felt a bit weird looking at the lovey-dovey \nscenes, BUT DAMN THE PLOT WAS GOOD. Still not a fan of the genre, but I do \nacknowledge it. ",

I merely want \nyoutubers to react to that and discuss the impact it may have on our music \nindustry in the future. The main reason I mentioned Pentatonix was because \nthey are an up and coming A Capella group with sold out concerts and \nincreasing popularity. Thus, they are the perfect \nfigureheads/representatives for the A Capella community. It may be common \nto you but honestly, besides a small handful, when has A Capella ever \ngained so much attention? Perhaps this is a change in the music era and it \nis not as common as you think it to be. And finebros makes videos of a \nvariety of things; some you may also think to be \"common\" and yet in the \neyes of others it is extraordinary. I respect your opinion but at the same \ntime I hope you will broaden your perspective of what is common and \nuncommon :)",
