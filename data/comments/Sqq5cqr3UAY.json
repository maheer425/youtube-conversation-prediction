Manga is all comics \nmade in Japan, and only in Japan, regardless of style.  The styles found in \nJapanese comics and animation are very broad, there's all kinds.\n\nThere's not just one English person who refers to Japanese animation as \n\"manga\".  The guys in this video did it.  Haonesle did it just a couple of \ncomments up.  And I started this thread because I had never NOT heard an \nEnglish person call Japanese animation \"manga\" before, in all of the dozens \nof times I've heard them talk about Japanese animation before I saw this \nvideo.",
