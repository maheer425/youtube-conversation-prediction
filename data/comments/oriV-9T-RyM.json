With Jaina basically going crazy with all thats been \nhappening (some with good reason) Do you think that Jaina could be a \npossible boss in a future expansion? Like perhaps she had it with \neverything of both the horde and the alliance and decides to betray the \nalliance and there would be a raid similar to SoO. Where instead of raiding \nOrgrimmar, you would raid in Dalaran or somewhere similar to it where the \nKorin Tor would be staying.\n\nPersonally I would love to see a raid like this turn out with Jaina being \nthe last boss of course... Even though she is a major character in the lore \nbut I cant be the only one thinking she could be a future boss along with \npeople of the Korin Tor.\ufeff",

It was a strategic point he saw that could result in a \nstronger overall army against the Legion. He has no personal beef with the \nhorde in particular. It was just that under Garrosh the horde was already \nfalling apart from the inside because people hated Garrosh so much, so the \nhorde was weakened and in prime position to be taken over. But now that \nthis is no longer the case with the horde, Wrathion has no reason to expect \nit should be easy to take the horde apart necessarily, not moreso than \ntaking apart the alliance would be. Also, when you said wrathion 'wants to \ndestroy the horde' it sounded to me like you meant \"kill everyone who is a \nmember of the horde\" as opposed to \"make it so the group known as the horde \nis no longer a group.\"  Regardless, even if Jaina becomes the big boss, \nWrathion wouldn't team up with her against the horde because he has no \nreason to want to do that now. He was never \"anti-horde, pro-alliance\" in \nbeliefs or principles, it was just a strategic point at the time, and it \nisn't anymore. ",

Wrathion's \nintent in supporting the alliance was not destruction of the horde (in the \nsense of \"killing everyone who was a member of the horde\"), but for the \nalliance to conquer the horde and force them into submission as part of the \nalliance.Wrathion wanted to do these things in order to cause the alliance \nand horde to become one group, so that as one big group they'd be strong \nenough against the Legion, instead of two smaller groups that kept \ndestroying each other. If it meant killing people along the way or forcing \nthem into submission, so be it. He felt the end justifies the means, but \nhis ultimate goal was protecting azeroth from the Legion, not destroying \neither faction.\n\nEither way, his plan didn't work out in the end, and now he has no reason \nto try for the horde's dismantlement: when garrosh was warchief, the horde \nwas falling apart from the inside because so many people were opposed to \nhim, so it was primed for the alliance to have a go and dismantle it. But \nnow under vol'jin the horde will be solidified again so wrathion has no \nreason to expect it should be readily dismantled.

A little known fact is brontosaurus' are really high in \ncholesterol so He was feeling a bit lethargic at this point and didn't have \nthe energy to throw the bones away so He just swept them underneath the \nearth.

So while it's possible \nten specifically African children died in the five seconds it takes to read \nyour comment, it is extremely unlikely due to the (roughly) seven billion \nand one hundred twenty-five million or so people living in the world though \nAfrica does have a population of (again roughly) one billion and one \nhundred million so it is possible. If we're going by race it would be more \nlikely that ten Asian children died during this time. This is because of \nAsia's population being roughly four billion four hundred twenty-seven \nwhich is more than four times as much as Africa.\n\nIt is also harder to remember something that you've never heard of, though \nthere could be ten African children who died, you've never met them, seen \nthem, or even heard of them. It's hard to miss things that you didn't know \nabout and have never affected you directly. \n\nMy question is what makes African children more special than any other \nchildren who died or could have died? What makes them more special than any \nother children who died before they could reach their full potential? \nShould it really matter what ethnicity or where the child is located, isn't \nit enough that a child died? In this scenario you're better off just saying \n'ten children died while you were reading this.' That way you're not as \nlimited as much by statistics, and people probably won't ask as many \nquestions.",
