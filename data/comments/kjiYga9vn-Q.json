A \nbelief in an Abrahamic religion is a harmful delusion -- to (1) the \nindividual, (2) society, and (3) the world in general. This delusional \nbelief is forced upon others, by those who believe \u2013 especially innocent \nchildren.\n\nChildren are indoctrinated into this belief by their religious parents, the \nclergy and most are never given a choice. They are brainwashed before they \nhave the capability to think for themselves. They are often presented with \na \"straw-man\" of various scientific theories and told they are invalid. \nThey are often instructed not to trust science. They are essentially \ninoculated against science / logic / critical thinking and their minds are \ncrippled as a result (for many, the rest of their lives). \nThey also start to believe that a celestial dictator is judging them 24/7 \nand will send them to eternal torture if they do/don't live in a certain \nmanner. Most will carry this fear around with them for the rest of their \nlives. This is mental imprisonment, and it is wrong to inflict this on \nothers \u2013 especially defenseless children.\n\nPrayer, if relied upon, promotes inaction and prolongs / perpetuates \nproblems faced by humans.\n\nHumans have become cancerous, in nature, to the world. The Abrahamic \nreligions are one of the main aggravating factors of this (besides human \nnature) \u2013 this religion brainwashes people to believe in their (delusional) \ndivine superiority, and that the earth & life only exists to serve human \nneeds - which is complete b/s. This in turn, leads to animal abuse, and the \naccelerated destruction of earth's natural environment.\n\nLastly, certain groups like gays, atheists/agnostics, etc. are treated like \nsh*t, in general, by Christians. They have (and frequently attempt to) \ncreated laws, which force others to live according to their Christian \nbeliefs/lifestyle. Christians are frequently attempting to introduce \nreligion back into schools (I shouldn\u2019t have to explain how inappropriate / \ndangerous this is). Being a Christian is now also an unofficial requirement \nto be electable for a high political position.\n\nAll Abrahamic religions operate in the same manner and whichever one holds \npower (by majority) persecutes others.. Islam (currently) uses a more \nviolent/explicit approach than Christianity, which is more effective at \nconcealing its malevolent nature / negative effects. Jews (a group \npreviously subjected to genocide) are now actively committing genocide \nthemselves, against the Palestinians because they think \"god\" gave them a \ndivine right to that land.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions are an insidious disease and history has \ndemonstrated that they are a threat to liberty. Hundreds of years ago, they \nused to serve a useful purpose \u2013 now, in the 21st century, they\u2019re a ball \nand chain to humanity's progression.\n\nThese religions are also simply a crutch for the weak-minded, and suit \nthose who lack courage / intellect to deal with death, life's struggles, \nand the unanswered questions about life/the universe.",

Often times I meet well educated people who didn't know \nthings I thought to be common sense, and the same for myself. I believe \nhomosexuality is also a nature vs nurture thing, where it can be genes, \ninfluence, or both. Definitely not a choice, though. If people do believe \nit is a choice, one guess is that they could be bisexual. But the only \nthing we can do is to educate people.",
