Stir continuously for about 2 minutes \nor until the sugar caramelizes or turns amber. Immediately pour the \ncaramelized sugar into prepared individual flan molds. Swirl the flan molds \nto evenly spread the caramel. Set the molds aside.\nPrepare the steamer. Place a steamer in a large saucepan or a wok. Pour in \nwater to just below the steamer; bring to boil.\nIn a bowl, combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, sugar and vanilla. \nGently pass the beaten eggs through a strainer into the bowl. Stir to \ncombine and mix thoroughly. Pour the mixture into the prepared flan molds \ncontaining the caramel.\n\nCover the molds with aluminum foil, arrange into the steamer (water should \nalready boiling before placing the molds inside); steam for 30 minutes or \nuntil firm. Set aside to cool and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nTo serve: Run a knife along the edges of the flan molds to loosen. For \nindividual flans, turn the molds over onto a platter or individual plates. \nFor a larger flans, place a platter on top of the mold; holding the platter \ntightly to the mold, quickly turn upside down. The flan should come out \neasily with the caramel on top.\nServes 6 to 8. \n\nTHIS IS A FILIPINO DESSERT!!!\ufeff",
