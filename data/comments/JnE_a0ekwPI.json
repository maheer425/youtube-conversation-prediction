That's a REALLY silly thing to say.\n\nA non-domesticated ('wild') animal can be tamed, if they are raised from \nbirth, but the species and individual temperament really do make a big \ndifference. \n\nHave you ever heard of Christian the lion? He never hurt a human after \nbeing raised by humans. He was a pet in the city for years and was very dog \nlike. He could have killed people at any time if he had wanted to. But he \ndidn't.

Remember that experiment with the foxes? The critters still \nbury raw meat in your furniture, but they have been bred to depend on \nhumans and are relatively safe to own.\n\nHowever, domestication doesn't take long to undo. Pigs, which were only \nrecently domesticated (in the grand scheme of things, anyway) will become \nferal and revert to a completely wild state within the escapees lifetime; \nthat's one of the main reasons the Americas have such a horrible wild pig \nproblem: a couple pigs get free, aren't recovered, and proceed to make a \nwhole new population, with all of the members being completely wild animals.\nEven dogs and cats will become wild after a enough generations, but they've \nbeen domesticated long enough that the offspring of a feral cat or dog \n(even a couple of generations along) can still be raised to live \ncomfortably with humans (I know this because my cat was feral born).",

Both cats and dogs we have today are \nthe result of human selection, they started out though as wild animals who \ndeveloped a dependency to humans first.\n\nEDIT:  Back on topic of my original message: It's this dependency, or \nreally it's more of a mutualistic relationship, that made \ndomestication successful for animals like dogs, cats, and most livestock. \nThere is no such relationship between humans and sloths. Most of these \npeople who keep exotic animals don't seem to think about the mental health \nof the animals.

They were wolves, who were bred to be un-aggressive so that \nhumans could use them to increase their hunting abilities. Wolves \nthemselves are not too terribly far from domestication themselves, they are \nnaturally social animals and as long as you fall into their social rank, \nthey do not discriminate between species. Humans used that to their \nadvantage to domesticate them. Now, dogs being scavengers at first \ndefinitely led to their flight distance being drastically lower than \nnormal, which led to them being domesticated easier. However, they didn't \nbreed themselves. Cats domesticated themselves.
