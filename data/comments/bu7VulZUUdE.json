If we somehow manage to get spacecraft speeds to go 100 times \nas fast, then it will still take 2800 years to get to that planet.

However, in our everyday lives, we enjoy \nour lemons and oranges because we've learned to appreciate their sour \nflavor, while also learning that they're not dangerous.

However, saying that taking advantage of \nsomething that could have been dangerous to humans in the wild that is no \nlonger so hazardous doesn't, in any way, suggest that the use of it makes \nus more intelligent.\nHere's a little bonus info, for anyone who cares: marijuana, while being a \n\"natural drug\" is far less potent in the wild; it was artificial selection \nby human farmers that made it into the more powerful drug that many people \nenjoy today, so I'm not sure that calling it a \"natural drug\" really makes \nsense anymore, either.

The earliest prediction I've heard him say \nis we will have penny chips by 2020, which is still 5 years away and I \nwon't get upset if it really takes until 2025.  \n\nPS,  I take that back.  I just watched a video  from 7 years ago and he \nsaid AI will probably not be achievable for 50 years or more.  So again, I \nhave no idea what you are talking about with his prediction of AI being \n\"\"Totally off-base\"\".  What are you talking about?",

I said, that he can not make this claim, being \na physicist and not having read the relevant literature. I just wondered, \nwhy he thinks that he knows so much about evolution, to go public on \nYoutube ?\n1. He didn't define intelligence in the beginning and claims that there \nhasn't been and there are no intelligent creatures on the planet at the \nmoment.\n-> Since he didn't define it it's hard to agree on that since there are \nanimals that are self aware (I admit thats a discussed topic) and seem to \ninteract with there environment (ever seen a dolphin on puff-fish poison ? \nHilarious !)\n2. Saying that we are no animals is wrong !\n3. He claims, that an opposable thumb and the repositioning of the eyes \nwere necessary to become intelligent.\n-> First ... There are other animals with opposable thumbs, and some \nanimals without them (e.g. corvus corone), that manipulate there \nenvironment and seem to be able to perform well in cognitive tests. Second, \nthere are many theory's around, that try to explain the evolution of Brain, \nbut claiming that the position of the eyes  defines predators and  prey is \njust dumb ... I am sorry, but that's how it is ! The position of the eyes \nis a feature, that evolved because there was an advantage of being able to \nhave a 3d vision, which is only possible with both eyes to the front.\nMoreover this to features, where just some adaptations, that lead to \nevolving a bigger brain with components like the opposable thumb to be \nimportant, but there are animals that show intelligence, so it's our own \nstory! There can be ways to intelligence, that are different from our way \n(that's actually my claim, cause I couldn't find something on pubmed within \n5 min)\n4. The story of the fox and the bunny ... More bullshit right there !\n-> Foxes may have better visual information processing than bunnys, but \nthis is it ! There are many examples of herbivores being smarter than \ncarnivora, although it is practically proven, that the change of our diet \n to meat, a few times a week was necessary to provide us with enough \nprotein, to develop our brain. So saying dumb bunny and smart fox is just \nwrong in that way... And explaining that with the positioning of the eyes ??\n5. Parents do not communicate knowledge to their offspring -> No culture !\n-> That's also wrong. There are many examples of other primates, showing \nthere offspring how to use basic tools ! Just have a look on youtube, you \nshould be enough material for you to see the effects. I can recommend David \nAttenborough documentaries, that are highly informative !\nMoreover Orcas show similar cultures, since they teach their offspring how \nto hunt.\n6. Predators seem to be smarter than prey!\n-> Most of our closest relatives are no predators ! And we are no real \npredators either, we hunt , yes ! But we lack the features of a carnivore. \nAnd we can not eat raw meat (at least not a lot of it)\n7. Can we make chimpanzee's intelligent ?\n-> The question he is trying to answer with this approach : Can we make \nthem human ?\n8.The brain case is important for the size of the brain and intelligence!\n-> Thats an oversimplification, since our intelligence is not to the size \nof our brains, but the number of neurons. You can have a bigger brain, but \nstill be less intelligent then other animals. First of all, because you \nhave a bigger brain, as soon as you are a bigger animal and second of all \nbecause brain cells are more important than size (dolphins have a bigger \nbrain than humans and thats already normalized).\n9. Found genes that allow us to make tools.\n-> I would like to see that publication! Chimpanzee's are able to use tools \nalready, so it's false to say, that we can implement this gene (better \ngenes(pl.)) .\n10. A spine that supports a larger brain case.\n-> Hmm what he means is the bipedal walk ? I don't know, but how he said \nit, it's wrong either way.\n\nMy point is simple, if you are not a biologist and you haven't read the \nliterature about it ( and not the popular science literature, but the \n\"real\" publications), stay at least in your field of expertise and don't \nstart to make claims, that are untrue and make you look kind of \nunintelligent.\n\n-> I won't look up all the publications, but you can definitely find \nlectures on brain evolution from biologists in the Internet.

                    "text": "Perhaps the definition of the word \"intelligence\" needs to be discussed.  I \nassume that when some people distinguish human intelligence from any other \nanimal intelligence, they emphasize the fact that humans are actually AWARE \nof everything that is going on.  \n\nEXAMPLE:   A tiger hunting its prey can be argued to have the intelligence \nto not only hunt, but to hunt successfully; skill and awareness are needed \nto hunt. However, the key difference here is that the tiger doesn't \nactually know that it is \"hunting.\" It is simply following its body's \ndemands.    \n\nThis is why language is important. The word \"hunt\" is a label that we use \nto identify the act of what we call hunting. Whenever someone who \nunderstands the word \"hunting\" hears it or sees it, some general idea of \nthe same act will be thought of.  Tigers don't use labels because they \ndon't know language.  They may use primitive signals between each other for \ncertain understandings when hunting or mating, but their ability to \nunderstand the world beyond doesn't go much further.  \n\nThey can't know that they are tigers because they lack the ability to think \nthat far ahead.  They are mostly limited to their hunting/survival modes of \nthinking.  This is both due to their genetics and lack of intellectual \nstimulation in their environment.  \nWith language, humans have been able to not only increase the stimulation \ntheir brains get, but they have also been able to pass on that information, \ncreating a compound effect.  This is what has taken us from \nhunter-gatherers to engineers in less than a million years.  ",

I take issue with religion because they all state that \nthey hold God above all, but they all seem like circles of human worship \nbecause of the important implications rested on us the human race. To \nexplain, I mean that believing this world was made just so that we could \nlive on it, that we are God's prime creation, etc. sounds incredibly \nself-absorbed. I believe that religion is a (feeble) attempt at explaining \nthe unknown and an organized way to get people on the same page in a \ncertain area to quell turbulent activities (if everyone believes in the \nsame thing, chances are there will be less violence). But what bothers me \nmost about religion is the assumption that humans MUST have a purpose. To \nme, that ideology comes from a fear of the unknown, probably death in this \ninstance, and to help them cope with the realities of a harsh, lonely, and \npurposeless world. In my opinion, there is nothing indicating humans have a \npurpose, or that they are special in any way from the other animals of the \nEarth, and THAT is where the fear comes from. The fear that maybe humans \nare just animals that developed more intelligence than the rest of animal \nkingdom, the fear that there is not anything waiting for us after we die, \nthe fear that something as \"special\" as the human race really has nothing \nspecial about it. So, we invented that thing that makes us special; \nreligion.",

Anyone who is intellectually honest, sincere, humble, and \nseeking the truth will consider the Qur'an and see the truth, insha'Allah.\n\nI ask questions so they may think for themselves.  I've already asked those \nquestions for my own sake.\n\nSeek forgiveness from your Lord and prostrate to God alone.  He is \nFully-Aware, the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  Those who acknowledge and \ndo good work will have forgiveness and a generous reward.  If you reject \nthen I warn you of a painful retribution.  I am but a clear warner.",

After a while \nit became clear that religion could used to control the masses. New \nreligions were invented to not only explain natural phenomenon but to \nfrighten the masses into submission. It's a powerful tool that is still \nworking today unfortunately. Religious people would rather believe in faith \nthan look for real answers.. Religion is the lazy way to explain the \nunknown.. \"God did it\".. So simple and lazy..  Free your mind from religion \nand look for real answers to explain the unknown.. It's okay to admit that \nsome things cannot be explained. Not yet anyway but some day we will find \nexplanations for the unknown. Everyone needs to come to terms with the fact \nthat they have been brainwashed from childhood and there really is no such \nthing as God.. There is no Easter Bunny, there are no Unicorns and there is \nno God.\n\nLook at your response to every comment.. Who, why, who, why, who, why.... \nYou should be looking for those answers yourself instead of expecting \nsomeone else to educate you. You give God credit for everything but there \nis no proof of god.. NONE.. Just a book, written by men.. There have been a \nlot of books written by men. Should we believe all of those stories to be \ntrue because it was written in a book?\n\nYou won't change your mind based on my comment but you should think about \nit a little.. You believe in a man made fictional story. Absolutely no \nproof whatsoever.",

On a further \nnote about the evolution of humans and ice ages, if we didn't have the \nintelligence to kill animals not only for nourishment, but also for warmth, \nwe would surely have gone extinct.\nI would also like to applaud you for your devotion to your religion, while \nI may not be religious myself, I encourage others to be so if it makes them \na better, more peaceful and loving of a person.",
