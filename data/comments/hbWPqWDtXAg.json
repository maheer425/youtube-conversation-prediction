I've actually had a bit of the opposite problem as you \nbecause i am American, and therefore my ideals have not always been \nunderstood very well by my peers. Like people who get mad over things that \ncannot be helped and loose there temper i have always found them to be \nincredibly childish... a child looses his temper in public, being an adult, \nto me, has always meant being able to control that aspect of yourself. and \neven though that has always bothered me, i still end up with the mind set \nthat that is just how things are and it cannot be helped. Its sort of like \nque sera sera.\ufeff",

I think this \nthought process is probably more pronounced in Japan, too. Japanese people \nare typically VERY well in control of themselves, and that was another \nthing that was surprising to me when I first visited. :) That they don't \noften get upset and yell or become moody when something unfair or stupid \nhappens, and when foreigners *do* we can end up isolating ourselves and \nbeing pushed away. This was one of the main points I wanted to make in my \nWhat not to do in Japan video when I tried to talk about not getting \nemotional. I wish I had been able to explain it this clearly!! Thank you! \nm(_ _)m",

There's this attitude of not just, \"I need to punish someone for \njustice,\" but also, \"If I show compassion and understanding at all, and try \nto solve the conflict instead of digging my heels in and escalating it, \nthen I'm weak and I'm giving in,\" and that attitude really isn't good for \nanyone.

If it's about other people though, I just can't watch \nthem suffer.

When people act like that I always want to help and push them to \nstand up for themselves. Even if it's not about me personally I would feel \nso helpless and not being able to actively help because I'm still trapped \non the other side of the planet just makes it all worse... \ufeff",

To \nItalians being lazy means taking your time and not getting stressed out. In \nfact, it is a compliment in Italy to be called lazy or \"pigro\" in Italian.\n\nItalians don't lack work ethic, they are hard working people. They just \ndon't let themselves get stressed out and get things done when they are \nable to instead of getting things done under a certain deadline. At least \nthat's how I've come to understand it.\ufeff",

It's too much to \ndeal with. When crap is just falling down all around you, \"shouganai\" is \njust not applicable. That's how I see it.

The game was simple. \n\nThere would be two subjects, both strangers, Person A and Person B. A would \nbe given a hundred dollars and would have to decide how to split the money \nbetween A and B. If B agreed to the offer, they would split the money, but \nif B said no then neither party would get any money. \n\nWhen both subjects were American, Person A would always suggest a 50/50 \nsplit. In instances where Person A was a confederate working for the \nresearchers and would suggest an uneven split, say 70/30, Subject B would \nalmost always say no.\n\nAlthough other tested nationalities also said refused, no group had a \nhigher rate of refusal than the Americans. They seemed to possess an innate \nsense of fairness and justice in their culture which seemed to compel them \nto punish what they perceived as unfairness.\n\nThere's a reason Americans have been the most ardent supporters of \ncapitalism in the 20th and 21st century. There's a reason American \nliterature invented the Superhero. There's a reason the crime shows like \nLaw & Order and CSI are so phenomenally popular in the US.\n\nYes, sometimes Americans act entitled.

Sometimes bad things happen and there's nothing you can do \nabout it.So why worry?\" - Simba. \n\nThis is something I learned early on in life, thanks to The Lion King. \nAha.(Although his use of it in that situation wasn't entirely good, but I \nunderstood that it wasn't always a bad thing to go by). But yeah, a lot of \ntimes I find it's better to just let things go when you can't do anything \nto change them. Although sometimes I think that something should be done, \nfor example if someone was careless and broke something expensive or \ninjured you (ex: DRUNK DRIVER injuring you) then you should sue. However, \nif it was truly an accident then I feel it should be let go... I think I \nalso got this attitude from my mom. My little brother ran into traffic when \nhe was young and this poor little old lady hit him. He got hurt, of \ncourse... but he suffered nothing in lasting damage. The old lady seemed \nsincerely upset and worried about him and it really wasn't her fault. I \nthink a lot of Americans would have sued her because they could but my mom \nsaid, \"It wasn't your fault, don't worry about it.\" and let it go. \n\nAnyway, I think \"Shouganai\" is healthy in some situations but people need \nto have an understanding of when it is okay to be upset about something and \nwhen it's okay to stand up for yourself if there's a possibility of a \nfavorable outcome. (If there's no chance of getting 'justice' then there's \nno point in worrying over it. Just let it go!) \n\nThat's my two cents. Great video, Rachel. ^^\ufeff",

                "text": "Great video! Being someone who has studied Japanese in university and by \nmyself, I have experienced the concept of \"shouganai,\" although I've never \nactually heard anyone say it. My Japanese professors are all native \nJapanese who grew up with the Japanese system and came here for grad school \nor whatever and then just decided to stay, so I'm surprised they never say \nit. Maybe the American mindset has infiltrated their thinking and, like you \nwith sort of realizing it and accepting it, they see that here in America, \nwe don't just say \"shouganai\" and let things go. (I dunno. Maybe I'll ask \nmy professor when I go to school on Monday what he thinks about this.) And \nsince I have yet to actually go to Japan (although it looks very likely \nthat I'll be going there for a few weeks this summer as part of a school \nproject), I have yet to hear a Japanese person say to me, \"Shouganai.\"\nI don't know if you watch her videos or whatever, but Mary (kawaiijutsu) \ntalked about this in a video of hers called \"Japanese Bureaucracy\" about \nthe Japanese saying \"shouganai\" even when it could be helped. What she does \nis if she hears a Japanese person say \"shouganai,\" not when something \nhappens and you can't do anything about it, but when something happens that \ncan be helped, she replies with, \"Iie, shou ga aru.\" which I think is a \nvery clever thing to do.\nI think that when I go to Japan, if I hear someone say \"shouganai\" and yet \nthere can be something done to help the situation, I might just start \ngiggling uncontrollably in response. I realize that there are some things \nthat, as foreigners, we have to accept if we want to live in Japan (such as \npeople staring at us because we're gaijin and asking us random things, like \n\"you can use chopsticks even though you're a gaijin?\" in which case we do \nhave to say \"shouganai\" because the Japanese people might not realize that \ngaijin can use chopsticks, etc.) But \"shouganai\" is definitely something \nthat I refuse to accept in the case of \"It can be helped, but we're just \nnot going to do anything about it because that would cause trouble for \nothers.\"\nReading all the comments on this video, people seem to be making \ncomparisons to things like \"Que sera sera\" and \"hakuna matata,\" and I do \nagree that it can be unhealthy to stress out about everything. I do have a \n\"shouganai\" type attitude if something unexpected happens and there can't \nbe anything done to change it, but if there's something I can do to change \nthe current situation for the better, then I'll do it rather than just sit \naround and say \"it can't be helped.\"\ufeff",
