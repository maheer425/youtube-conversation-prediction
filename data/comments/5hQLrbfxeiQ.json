If you need to \nlearn something, you'll learn it very quick. The problem is that Malian \nofficers are absolutely incompetant. They should be able to control their \nsubordinates, and failing that, they should be able to punish their \nsubordinates correctly too. That's why the officer gets shot in the middle \nof the street. He did not have the ability and expected officership to \nsimply say: \"shut the fuck up and do what I tell you to, or I'll have you \ncleaning shit with your own toothbrush for a month.\" Instead he decided it \nwas the perfect moment for an intellectual debate with the equivalent of a \nfancy Private First Class.\n\nIt's exactly why the French, British and Irish are out there training them \nand, in the French case, doing the war for them. The Malians do not know \nanything about war. The Tuareg's do. The Jihadi's do. The French do. The \nMalian's do not.\n\nAs for using what you described in order to attack the building; a heavy \nassault is both really dangerous and really ineffective against a compound. \nHE rounds, in particular, are essentially worthless. You do not know how \nmany enemies are inside, you do not know if they have hostages including \nwomen and children, you do not know if the RPG rounds will set off further \nexplosions, for example on suicide vests etc, and kill everything within a \nhalf mile radius, you do not have enough RPG rounds to effectively combat a \nbuilding, you do not know if you will need more RPG rounds, for example if \nthe Jihadi's decide to use a VBIED, you will not be able to capture any \nJihadi's, you will not be able to identify civilians from Jihadi's, you \nwill risk covering up more explosive devices in rubble, you will risk \ndestroying crucial evidence such as attack orders and combat maps... Fact \nis that if you are attacking a building, you need to get into it fast and \nhard. You need to take the enemy out before they are either reinforced or \nmake an escape, just like the recent attack in Kenya. And you definitely \ncannot just level the building. That would be a serious amount of economic \ndamage, and political too.\n\nOf course, these are all decisions that the Officer needs to make. Not \nmaking those decisions cost time and almost cost extra lives. That officer \nneeds to be relieved of his command before he gets his soldiers killed or \nthey mutiny. He almost had them Blue-on-Blue aswell. That's why they need \nbetter equipment such as radios, body armour and helmets.\n\nThe French performed as perfect an assault as was possible. I can only \nimagine the fireteams moving through the building swiftly and clearing \nmethodically, wiping out Jihadi's before they could even fire their weapons \nback. I doubt they even fired 60 bullets.",

Then they should have cleared the \nbuildings with frags. The Malian troops clearly did not have the capacity \nfor it. And as for arguing in the middle of the street with your commander? \nThe Corporal was correct in what he was saying, but you never question the \nCommanding Officer's decisions unless they are unreasonable. And by \nunreasonable I mean something like \"keep going into their sectors of fire, \nthey'll run out of ammo eventually!\"\n\nLike, you can see that when the French got there, they were supporting \ntheir vehicles, they were well-equipped, they had better weaponry, they \nflanked through the market place instead of attacking the building head on. \nThey maintained composure and were not rolling around the ground and doing \nduck-walks like a bunch of clowns, they were not arguing in the middle of \nthe street only for one of them to get shot.

For the most part, \nWestern involvement in Africa is either Western business, or Western aid. \nYou can view both as colonial capitalism, and people will tend to draw \nnegative conclusions about Western/ European nations if businesses linked \nto those nations act irresponsibly. That kinda explains why the West is \ndamned if it does, and damned if it doesnt. Its also the reason why Europe \nshould and does (sort of) take active interest in maintaining the stability \nof Africa. Buuuut successful intervention has happened before. Check \nBritish intervention in Sierra Leone.",

However, I find that even for an unprofessional military, \ntheir display in this documentary is probably one of the worst military \nforms of \"discipline\" which I have ever witnessed.\n\n*Ever*.\n\nI completely pity the French troops which have to deal with them.\n\nPart two is *extremely* graphic, and I do not suggest watching it unless \nyou are ready to see the real and full horrors of war in front of your \nface. The results of suicide bombing and dead bodies left overnight, half \nburned, are graphically filmed. But if you can stomach it, it's worth \nbearing witness.\n\nAnd before anyone shrieks about killing kids: It isn't the French who put \nthe kids into battle with guns to shoot at them. If you want to yell at \nanyone for killing kids, yell at morons who support Islamist causes.\n\nPart Two on Vice's site: http://www.vice.com/ground-zero/mali-part-2\n\nAnd again: I caution you not to watch this on a weak stomach, or if you \nsimply cannot bear horrific videos of the real consequences of war.\ufeff",
