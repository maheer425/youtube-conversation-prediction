Plus if it was \ntravelling at a lower orbit there would more dramatic effects to see in \nsimulation like much higher tides twice a day...which sucks if you live in \nFlorida. Also the simulation would be more interesting to me if the moon \nwas reflective but smooth, not panelled. The secondary effect of the sun's \nrays hitting the earth after refraction from a smooth mirror ball would be \nvisually stunning.",

Conversely, large objects \nsuch as ships, airplanes are well -- large -- BUT it's still something we \ncan control via a steering wheel.  GIANT objects such as planets, moons, \nand that space mirror is something we cannot control as in move, carry, \nlift, push, pull, etc... or at least not YET anyway.

YOu can not achieve orbital velocity with an unpowered object \nperiod, unless you are already most of the way there.  For example, if you \nhad sudamn husseins fancy gun, and you took it to orbital height and shot \nit 7.8km/s you would achieve an orbit with that bullet, but the problem \nwith shooting it from earth is that you would get drag, and even if you \ndidn't have drag for the first 24 hours the bullet would inevitably return \nto earth atmosphere on the other side of the planet, I would have to draw a \npicture to show you clearly what I am talking about, but basically, if you \nshot it too close to the horizon, it would just be in earth atmosphere \nuntil earth dragged it to the ground, if you shot it too high, it might \nleave space, but when it came back down it would just have performed a \ntrans-orbital hop from where you are to another part of the world, in order \nto achieve an orbit, you have to make adjustments while you are in space, \nwithout them, an unpowered object would either crash back into the earth, \nor go zipping off into space, and how wonderful it is that we can't so \neasily create moons, because if it were as easy for us to have moons then \nwe would have dozens of the asteroids that pass us either crash into the \nearth or the go zipping past us.

The answer is that unless the moon there \nhad an atmosphere, that would not happen. Sand is created from rocks and \nstone that is weathered away, so you would need to have wind, water, or \neven more sand. For that, you would need an atmosphere. But if that \natmosphere was there, and the planet did get covered in sand, and the sun \ndestroyed the atmosphere (which would mean the sun had to lose power, then \ngain power to destroy the atmosphere and heat the sand) life could not \nlive, since the sun's heat would be so strong, and the glass moon would be \nreflecting light so strongly, that planet would either burn, or the life \nthere, whatever it may be, would be blind all the time from the light being \nreflected on it. They would need many bunkers, and they couldn't have the \ntime do build those, so, no, life couldn't survive that.\n\nThat took me 10 minutes to type. ",

There's the answer. If we were on the surface of the ball as \nit ujst passed above the earth's surface, we'd see earth as we now see it \nfrom outer space. Hence, conversely, from earth, the reflection we'd see on \nthe ball is as if a picture taken from outer space. Hope my reasoning is \ncorrect.",

Sure, since the \nuniverse is infinite ademine could combine with guanine, but biology wont \nlet it be. Likewise the microscopic chance that atoms combine to make the \nmaterials in a disco ball (glass and plastic, in other words, compounds and \nnot elements) will make it so that it will most likely not happen. and that \nis ONLY taking into account the fact that atoms can combine to make glass \nand plastic. most likely the reason why a discoball moon doesnt exist is \nprobably the same or similar to for the reason of why adenine doesnt \ncombine with guanine in your dna\n\nalso even if you create a disco ball moon means nothing since it was \ncreated artifically and not naturally.",
