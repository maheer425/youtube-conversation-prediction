Entire religions \nhave been created to worship the sun and its life giving qualities. How is \ndeveloping white skin evolutionary? That's hogwash. The polar bear has \nblack skin under the white fur, the arctic fox has black skin under it's \nwhite fur. The Native Alaskan and Native Canadian and Native American \ntribes were/are all darker than white Europeans. What race of people is \n\"turning\" another color today or has \"turned\" anther color in the last 500 \nyears, or 1,000 years or so? I think it would have been documented. No such \ndrivel. Only way to \"turn\" skin is through admixture with another race or \nsome kind of unique, odd ball type of situation.\n\nBlacks have stronger bones and more vitamin D bioavailable to us than white \npeople. White supermarkets are chock full of calcium fortified and vitamin \nD fortified foods, so having light skin has done ZILCH for whites. Whites \nand Asians (the lightest people on earth) have the highest incidents of \nosteoporosis (brittle bones).  My parents grew up in a Caribbean country \nwith no fortified foods and have super strong bones and good health. The \nbulk of the country folks in my country are super strong, hardy, wiry folks \nwho can eat four plantains, three fried eggs with onions and a whole milk \nshake with sugar for breakfast and still be thin as rails and strong as \noxen.
