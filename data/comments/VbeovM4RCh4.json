                    "text": "+MinkYtak At the end of the day, everyone's perceptions and interpretations \nof his talk will vary and truthfully, so does our opinions on what dictates \npeoples sexuality. We are all influenced by our environment. Whether or not \nit dictates our sexuality I can not say that I agree or disagree with it. \nCause who the hell knows and honestly, why does it matter?\n\nI think what's interesting about Eric's talk is not that it was a coming \nout story, but rather an attempt to close the societal gap of us vs. them. \nWe live in a world where we're all very different people, who live \ndifferent lives, have different opinions, like/love different things, etc. \nThroughout my life, I remember being told how amazing it was to live in a \nworld of such difference and was encouraged to embrace my uniqueness and \ncelebrate it. But I was ostracized and severely bullied for what other \npeople considered odd and unusual. We preach the wonder and beauty of how \namazing it is for us to each have our own identities and yet we have \nvarious prejudices towards one another. What seems to be a common thread \namong us all is that we are a part of a greater community. It's easy to \nfall into a predetermined box of gender/personality/etc. characteristics. \n\nInstead of thinking of his message as one about being gay, why not consider \nthe idea that a \"closet\" can be universal, regardless of sexuality? We all \nhave something that we are insecure about. The most vulnerable thing a \nperson can do is to accept it, embrace, love it, and in the face of \nadversity, never change it.",

Your post clearly insinuates that his sexuality may \nhave been influenced by his mother.\nAnyway, you are making a mistake of cause vs. correlation. Did you ever \nconsider that gay men brought up with greater female influence are more \nlikely to be openly gay because they do not have to fear their fathers? \nPeople are more likely express themselves freely when they do not have \ngender expectations forced on them.",
