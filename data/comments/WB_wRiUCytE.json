Only moment was \nwhen Japan forced korea sign treaties to assimilate into its empire in 1910 \nbut it all turned out to be invalid and Korea suffered a few decades of \nillegal colonial state. The rest of modern history on Russia vs US on Korea \nis quite spot on by BillboardtopMV. Koreans are one of rare nations who has \nremained as a homogeneous ethnic group for thousands years and proud of it. \nTheir culture reflects that.

There is no fix to this unless we change the way our economies and \ndistribution rules work.\nI'm sure they'd send the food to Africa or to starving people if they \ncould.

Certainly, the Korean one \ntastes different. But the looking and pronunciation are very similar. \nAnother example is Ramen (\u62c9\u9762 which is in Chinese) which is a kind of \npopular noodles in Japan. The looking and pronunciation  are also very \nsimilar with that in China. Of course, the Japanese one has its own styles. \nEven in different provinces in China, there are many different flavors. \nForget about the Canadian Chinese Food!  Most of the Chinese restaurants \noverseas are originally from the Southeastern China. Their main basic food \nis rice not noodles which is eaten mostly in Northern China, let along all \nthe abroad Chinese food has changed its flavor according to the local \neating habits.       \ufeff",

It is said[by whom?] that it \ntastes better with hand pulled noodles.\n\nIn Beijing cuisine, yellow soybean paste (\u9ec3\u91ac) is used, while in Tianjin and \nother parts of China tianmianjiang (\u751c\u9eb5\u91ac), hoisin sauce (\u6d77\u9bae\u91ac), or broad \n(fava) bean sauce (\u8373\u74e3\u91ac) may be used in place of the yellow soybean paste. \nSoy sauce can also be used instead of the soybean paste. Simplified \nChinese:(\u70b8\u9171) also means fried sauce, as the sauce itself is fried, although \nthis homonym does not carry over into the Traditional Chinese term which \ndescribes the actual bean paste.\ufeff",
