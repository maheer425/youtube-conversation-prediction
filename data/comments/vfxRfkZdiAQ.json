It makes books, \nnotes, paper prints out party invites, job applications, resumes, paper \ngives us pamphlets, dictionaries, atlases, sketch pads, sticker books, \ncolouring books, paper doesn't require power, it's cheaper to make, it \ndoesn't waste metal or glass. Paper is fucking incredible. If all those \nthing I mentioned evolved into bright eye hurting screens, or infuriating \ntouch pad technology I would be greatly disappointed in the world. Paper is \na amazingly useful, wanna know why people don't think it's depressing that \npeople don't use stone tablets anymore? It's because stone tablets were \nheavy, hard to write on, and mistakes couldn't be removed by using an \neraser.  ",

Even so, \nthe behavior +Kane Gray has been exhibiting is unacceptable anyway, and \neven if they were, I doubt they would allow him on.\n\n3) Spelling usually means someone isn't very smart.\nSimilar to younger children.\nSee my point?\n\n4) I highly disconsider the possibility that Kane Gray is an undercover cop \nlooking for pedophiles in a comment section. Your logic is highly flawed, \nand I see no reason to continue this argument any more.
