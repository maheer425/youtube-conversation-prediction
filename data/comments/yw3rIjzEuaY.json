You're \nlooking at the Scottish and the Welsh dialects as their own categories \nentirely. (Or, in your words, more specifically.) But we still refer to \nthose dialects as subcategories of \"British English.\" Why? Because it's \nstill Britain. It's still the British Isle and it's still the United \nKingdom. Therefore, it's still British English as far as we're concerned. \nAnd it's a dialect because of what we refer to as \"received pronunciation\" \nwhich is the closest thing to a \"standard accent\" that the U.K. has ever \nseen.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is that I disagree with your assertion \nthat one \"has to be specific.\" No, one doesn't. If what I'm talking about \nis the English spoken in the United Kingdom, inclusive of all sub-dialects \nand regionalisms, emphasizing received pronunciation, which I am, then I'm \ngoing to refer to it as \"British English.\"\n\nBut if you want to stick to your guns, and you truly believe in being \nconsistent, then let's do the same with the English spoken in the U.S. From \nnow on, there's no such thing as \"American English.\" There will be New \nEngland English, New York English, Old Country Southern English... etc. We \ncan come up with dozens and dozens of more specific categories.\n\nOr... you know... we can just refer to it as American English and British \nEnglish when we're not being specific. And that's what we do.\n\nAt any rate, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. Thanks for \nkeeping the conversation civil though. This was really good. You gave me a \nlot to think about. Cheers! (Yeah we say that here too lol)\ufeff\n\nEDIT: This page has a little tree diagram that makes it clear. It all falls \nunder \"British English.\" And then just look up \"received pronunciation\" and \nit should make sense to you as to why we refer to it as a dialect.\n\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_Kingdom",

Not your fault. \n\nThere are no British English dialect, same thing that there is no such \nthing as a European dialect. Yet people say that too. Doesn't make it \ncorrect though. \n\nThere are English, Scottish, and Welsh dialects spoken in Britain. (English \npeople, Scottish people, and Welsh people) But there are *no* British \naccent spoken in Britain.\n\nAgain, you have to be specific as I mentioned in my previous post. Are you \nreferring to English, Scottish or Welsh accents? if it's RP it would be an \nEnglish accent, sure as heck not Scottish or Welsh one. In fact, you even \nhave RP in Australia. \n\nHere you go.\n\nEngland > English people > English language > English accents and dialects \n> insert regional accent / dialect spoken. \n\nSweden > Swedish people > Swedish language > Swedish accents and dialects > \ninsert regional accent / dialect spoken.\n\nFrance > French people > French language > French accents and dialects > \ninsert regional accent / dialect spoken.\n\netc etc etc.",

I'm not really sure where to go from here because -- and again, \nI'm really honestly not trying to be condescending or rude -- but any \nlinguist will tell you that yes, it's a dialect and yes, it's \"British \nEnglish.\"\n\nThere are 3 main dialects of English: the English of Great Britain/the \nU.K., the English of North America, and the English of Australasia. They're \nconsidered dialects because they differ not only in pronunciation, but \ngrammar and spelling.\n\nSo I'm not really sure what else to say. If you don't want to believe me, \nthen that's OK. But the entirety of the field of linguistics would \nabsolutely and unequivocally agree with me upon those two points. And of \nthat I'm absolutely certain.\n\nYou have to remember that it's not just pronunciation. So while one's \naccent might differ in one part of Great Britain or what have you, or even \nin different parts of England itself, it's still considered a dialect of \nEnglish that we refer to as \"British English.\"\n\nLike I said, you don't have to agree, and you can continue referring to it \nas \"English English\" if you'd like, but just know that it's not what it is \nand not because I say so but because it's what essentially the whole body \nof linguistic scholarship says... so, there you go.

I prefer \nSouthern American accents because they sound warm and polite, I also like \nthe sentence structure they use. \n\nI was a bit harsh about Yank accents, the Bostonian accent is kind of nice, \nand there are a couple of other ones (can't recall now) but generally \nspeaking it sounds so...flat. \n\nToo you it's different I guess, over here in Europe there are sooo many \ndifferent accents and dialects.

If \nwe were referring to the English written and spoken only in England, then \nyes, it would be \"English English\" I guess, but we're not; we're talking \nabout the English spoken throughout the entirety of Britain. I'm not being \ncondescending here, and I'm not trying to insult you, but do you understand \nhow England relates to Great Britain and how Great Britain relates to the \nUnited Kingdom? It's British English we're talking about here, not English \nEnglish. I've never heard anyone, any learned person (we actually say that \nhere too), ever speak of \"English English.\"\n\nBut as for us sounding like robots, no offense taken. I don't really know \nwhat we sound like because it's always been what I've heard most often. \nBritish English can sound either incredibly silly or incredibly smart and \nsophisticated depending upon the regional dialect.

Yes I know most use it but it's not really accurate. But I \ndigress.\n\nAs for the difference between American English and English English it \nresembles that of French and Canadian French. Which is more proper can be \ndebated, however, I would argue that American English is poorer than \nEnglish English when it comes to expression. Then again, English as a \nlanguage is much poorer than other European languages, it lacks nuances \netc. \n\nPerhaps that makes sense since it is a much younger language than say \nSwedish, German and French. \n\nIf you look at the word \"learned\" that is also a term that the English use \n(which doesn't exist in American English) example: learned man.  \n\nLastly, when it comes to spelling as I touched upon that is the handy work \nof Noah Webster, most of it, he wanted to simply the language, and at the \nsame time distance the Americans from the English. If not you would have \nspelled like the English, Canadians, Australians and Kiwis do. \n\nI'm not putting any value on it, to be honest, the most beautiful English \nspoken is a well spoken Southern dialect/accent. Nothing comes close to \nthat, imo. \n\nYanks all sound like monotone robots, un-alive, there is no anima there, no \nnuances.. That is not to offend them but it's true.
