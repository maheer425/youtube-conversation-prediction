If you wear contact lenses at a younger age \nlike 8-9, it would be better. But you need to responsible about your \nlenses. You need to clean them everyday when you take it off. Also, another \ntip, please DO NOT put on your contacts above the sink. My classmate,who \nalso wears contacts and introduced contact lenses to me, dropped her \ncontact lens in the sink. ANd luckily found it, but it was very dirty. She \nhad the wash the contact lenses around 5 times carefully. When I first \nstarted wearing contact lenses, I was very clumsy and dropped one of my \ncontact lenses on the floor. So, I skipped one day of contact lenses. But \nremember, if you didn't put on contact lenses one night, the things you see \nthe next day will be blurry. ( I wear contact lenses at night and take them \noff in the morning) Also,contact lenses can make your eyesight better. My \neyesight was 400 and now it is only 0.25!\nHope the information will help you. Hope your mom will allow you to wear \ncontacts",

I personally prefer them because I \nfind glasses uncomfortable, as well as I don't want to wear them with \nbraces, or at all in public, because I dislike the way I look in them. \nContacts are very comfortable, unless they tear, fold, are put in inside \nout, or even the tiniest speak of hair or dust can really hurt. Of course, \nif you take care of your lenses, this shouldn't happen often. Contacts are \ndifficult to put in at first, but just practice and you'll be able to do it \nreally quick. Same with taking them out. Everything looks different \ncompared to glasses, at first. Much better in my opinion. If you aren't \ncomfortable putting something in, and taking it out of your eye just yet, \nwait a little bit before trying contacts!",

I wear contacts too, when you first start \nwearing them they feel a little weird but once you get used to them, you \nwon't even feel them! Also for all of those who don't like to use the \nartifical or Kirkland contact solution , I really would recommend clear \ncare. It's just this contraption that cleans all the bad stuff that's in \nthe lense and make a them feel new. It's a lot better for your eyes too. \nBut all contact solution is really good ! That is just what i recomand. \ud83d\ude00",

I am an optometry \nstudent and optical dispenser for 5 years. \n\nthe reason why you have different colours for the right and left case is if \nyou have different prescriptions for both eyes, it ensures you don't mix up \nthe contact lenses. different astigmatism prescription in the eyes may \nrequire you to do that. (astigmatism is when your eye isn't perfectly round \nbut more like a rugby ball shape). people who don't have astigmatism may \nstill have different prescriptions in both eyes. so it is good to get in \nthe habit to put the right contact lens in the appropriate side of the case.\n\nyou SHOULD NOT sleep in your contact lenses unless you are wearing the ones \nthat have been approved for such use eg. Airoptix Night and Day. However \nmost popular brands do not fall in this category. \n\nafter you put in your contact lenses, you should discard the used solution \nand rinse it with new solution and then allow to air dry rather than doing \nthat at the end of the day when you want to take them off.  \n\nI'm also quite surprised your optometrist didn't teach you how to put them \non and take them off. Here in Australia if you are a first time contact \nlenses wearer it is a must to be taught how to wear and care for your \ncontact lens to prevent any infection. \n\nall that being said, I think it is great that you are doing these videos \n:) \ufeff",

NOW \nwhen I went to take them out the right one took like 8 minutes to get out, \nthe left one was an absolute nightmare. Seriously This video made it look \nSO easy. I currently have my contacts out since it is night time. I am kind \nof dreading the morning to put them in in the morning but I am going to use \nthe method you used to put them in, use the 2nd method you use to take them \nout. Again thank you for the video it was very helpful, I am going to put \nthese methods to the test!\ufeff",
