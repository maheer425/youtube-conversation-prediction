                    "text": "+111q222p333m444z Okay genius, then why did this rape epidemic suddenly \noccur within the past decade. Laws were the same. Also, rape in marriage is \nconsidered rape in every god damn country! (Europe or North America). What \nyou are trying to get at is that Sweden has many different categories for \nrape from less aggravated to more aggravated, etc. In other countries, \nit'll just be considered rape. This doesn't make the rape number higher or \nlower though, it just stays the same. For example, in Sweden if a man rapes \na women against her will by his genitals just touching the woman, its a \nless aggravated rape. If he penetrates her though, its normally aggravated \nrape. So there legal system is different and completely terrible. Because \nRapists usually can walk off scot free by finding a small loophole and they \nusually end up with probation or community service (lol). So these Muslim \nimmigrants come and take advantage the gullable Swedish population. Norway \ntoo. That's why that mass murderer, Anders Brevik, got fed up and shot all \nthose 80 something left-wingers to death because of PC liberal policies. \nI'll give you examples where there laws don't work.\n\nAn illegal Somali immigrant raped a Swedish girl to death (Nov 2013). The \ncops found him in a hotel parking lot fucking the dead corpse. It was found \nthe women was under the influence of drugs and alcohol but she was helpless \non the ground. This monstrosity held her down and raped her while she was \nhelpless and incapitated all night long and she died during the rape \nsomewhere in between. The man had a history of drug and sexual assault \ncharges. Anyways, he didn't get deported and he only got charged with \nmutilating a corpse, not murder or even rape as he told the court it was \nconsensual and the jury said they couldn't prove him otherwise. So he's \nfreely walking around probably raping other women in Sweden. If this was \nthe U.S. or Canada, this fucker would've been in jail for life.\n\nAnother time, a man wasn't charged with rape because he told the court that \n\"her no was part of the sex game.\" The woman said she screamed and screamed \nuntil she lost her voice. The dude tells the court, he was convinced the \nwoman was into rough sex and received signals for it. After, under the \npretense of taking a shower, she fled the apartment and called cops. She \nhad bruises, clothes torn, etc. Anyways, the court then says it was clear \nthat the man had used violence to force the woman to have sex. But they \ncouldn't prove he \"intentionally\" forced her to have sex with him. So he \nmight have \"accidently\" have forced her to do it. That guy is walking \naround freely too.\n\nAnyways, the whole point is... don't trust Muslims, ever. Every single one \nof them sympatize with Jihadist attacks on the west as their religion \ndictates them to kill non-muslims. Also, if they had their way wherever \nthey immigrate to, they'll rape all non-muslim women and kill the men. \nTheir religion tells them to do so.",

They BECOME fanatical as they grow older and/or as \ncircumstances arise that compel them to radical action. They are malleable \nto the whims of their religion, to being co-opted as a 'soldier-of-god' and \nto can be pushed into terrorism or just open bigotry, misogyny, \nsectarianism and persecution. Kids are usually harmless, but it's later in \nlife the shit can hit the fan. The only people I know who are not \nvulnerable to being co-opted this way are those who never become religious \nin the first place. The 'nice' religious folks you know today, can become \nthe hot-headed fundies of tomorrow.  You'd do well to read Darrel Ray's \nfascinating book 'The God Virus', and get yourself and your loved \nones inoculated.",

People are now able to \nget coverage.  Businesses who could not provide coverage now have employees \nwho can remain healthy and have coverage.   \n\nPresident Obama knew that he needed to get it passed and then make \nadjustments along with war to improve it.  I know people who are dropping \ntheir coverage and getting coverage on an exchange which is cheaper. I know \nmany of the independent contractors I hire who now have insurance when in \nthe past they never could afford it so this is a small business godsend. \n\nIts interesting that the many polls of business people I have looked at, \nbeing a business person, show that they are positive about the future of \nour country and see business growing.  Some have stated issues with \nObamacare but it seems more about misinformation that is being pushed in \nthese circles with many of them being Republican.  \n\nIt is truly an Affordable Care act to make insurance affordable to people. \n Funny how car insurance is mandatory and young people are the most risky \ncoverage so have the highest premiums.  Health insurance is almost the \nopposite with the young being less in need of coverage.  Now that many I \nknow can afford it because it is the many times lower than cable or cell \nphone they are confident that they do not have to fear the broken leg or \nillness.\ufeff",
