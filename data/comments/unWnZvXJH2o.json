That means it takes \ninformation from both your left and right eye, but only the information \nthat comes from the right half of the world (and is projected onto the left \nhalf of each retina).\nUnilateral neglect, however, is a perception issue; that is, the patient \ncan see, but does not attend to the information. The prevailing theory for \nlateralization of attention is that the left parietal lobe attends to right \nhemispace while the right parietal lobe attends to all of space. That way \nboth 1) someone with damage to their right parietal lobe still has a \nfunctioning left parietal lobe, preserving the ability to attend to the \nright side of space and 2) someone with damage to their left parietal lobe \nhas a functioning right parietal lobe, allowing them to attend to the whole \nenvironment--exactly what you see in the grand majority of case studies \n(though brain lateralization does vary for some individuals).\nSources: college courses in brain damage and mental function, sensation and \nperception, and clinical neuropsychology",

Also, memory fades unless you keep studying the topic. So if you \nplan to keep researching on this, good for you!\nMy policy is that if I can look it up very quickly, there is no reason to \nmemorize. Also, if you use this info on a daily basis, you will eventually \nmemorize it. Which is why a lot of math teachers give formulas on the \nexams: you don't need to know the formulas, just how to apply them. I find \nthat after a bit of practice, I know them; yet it is still good to have \nthem there to check (humans are not perfect, our memory is certainly not \nalways reliable.)\nI think also that you are underestimating the world. If only a few people \nwould be interested in learning, Crash Course would not exist. Also, even \nif there are a lot of bad things in the world, there are also a lot of good \nones. Besides, this type of learning is not the only kind. The best guitar \nplayer may not have much \"book\" knowledge, but they do have a lot of \nknowledge on how to play their instrument. Learning how to dance, sing, \nclean a house, talk in public, draw, cook, listen, fix a toilet, etc. may \nnot seem like it, but they are still forms of learning, and important to \nour lives. So while someone may not be interested in learning about \nanthropology, but still try to learn to be the best at something/have more \nknowledge on their topic of interest, I would give them credit.

If I had face blindness, I shouldn't be able to do that. \nHowever, it does look a tad off when I see my shaven face in the mirror, \nlike it's missing something that's supposed to be there. At the same time \nthough, I don't feel that seeing myself with all scraggly facial hair isn't \na good reflection of how I see myself. I only feel optimal with trimmed, \nbut not shaven facial hair. Overly long hair diminishes the image as well. \nI kind of wish it's just grow to a certain point and then stop. ",

We have a reflex to pull away \nwhen we get a painful stimulus - like touching something hot. The neural \nwiring goes from the heat sensors in your fingers to the spinal cord and \nback to the muscles. Without taking the long route all the way up to the \nbrain, it can save time so you don't hurt yourself too much. However, for \nmost reflexes (/polysynaptic/ reflexes), the brain can interfere along the \nway and block the reflex.\nSo I guess what happened is this: You are aware that you don't want to \nspill the hot soup - this is something that happens in the brain, with your \nhigher cognitive functions. So your brain sends signals down the spinal \ncord to inhibit any rapid movement.\nNow you burn your hand, the pain signal reaches your spinal cord, where it \nwould usually trigger the motor neurons that tell your muscles to drop the \ncontainer. But since the brain sends inhibitory signals somewhere along the \nway, the signal gets blocked, and you hold on to the cup. Hooray! Hope \nnothing bad happened, and it heals away quickly.! ;)",
