When \nyou say something like Futbol players are weak because they get injured and \nrugby players dont get injured cause they have more muscle and they are \nbuilt to not get injured makes me laugh because no matter how big you are \nyou always get injured. ACL is a very common injury that is the Anterior \nCruciate Ligament a lot of futbol and rugby players get this injury. \nhttp://physioworks.com.au/Injuries-Conditions/Activities/rugby-league-injuries \n& http://physioworks.com.au/Injuries-Conditions/Activities/soccer-injuries \nSo when you say Rubgy is better because they dont get injured most of the \ntime due to the size of them think again kid.

Take Pique and Iniesta for \nexample: their club (Barcelona) is sponsored by Nike but the Spanish \nNationalteam is sponsored by Adidas, that's why they don't wear Spain \ntrikots. And then we have people like G\u00f6tze, who are individually \nsponsored, while neither club nor country kit is from Nike, G\u00f6tze still \nmakes advertisement for Nike shoes. This is why he doesn't wear a specific \nkit but simply black and white. Hope that helped.",

Stop using \nthe superior teamates excuse to rationalize why Messi scores so much, \nbecause you could say the same exact thing about Ronaldo, even if he is \nmore selfish, he still gets assists to score in the first place from world \nclass players. Even back in Ronaldo's Man U days, he had Rooney to help him \nand make him look like a stud by supplying him with assists. Messi, even \nwith good teammates like Iniesta and Xavi, creates his own chances to score \nwith his left foot. The man dribbles full grown man defenders and makes \nthem look like amateur bitches all the fucking time and he doesn't use \nstepovers or athleticism like Ronaldo to beat them, he does it with his \npure ball control which is just too nice. Football is a success driven \ncompetition, if you succeed and produce and win trophies and honors and \naccolades, you are technically considered the best. That's how it works in \nevery sport. That is the one type of standard you can use to judge a player \nagainst others in an objective manner.",

Ronaldo takes a back seat to Messi because Messi is \npretty much considered a legend of this time, and Ronaldo is the guy \"in \nhis shadow\", but not all the time. Sometimes Ronaldo is better, like the \ntime when he won the Balloon d'Or, but then again maybe it's just because \nhe was more popular than Messi was that year. I think once either Ronaldo \nor Messi wins a WC, the argument will be settled because who ever wins it \nfirst or just wins it in general can be called the better player, seeing as \nthey would both carry their national teams. Football is a \"success\" driven \ncompetition nowadays: who ever wins the most/produces the most is \nconsidered the best :/ ",

From my limited knowledge of American football, players just run \ninto each other at full speed.\nThose are the two main differences.\n\nI do agree with you on calling football soccer. Here in Ireland, we call it \nsoccer too, I don't know where Callum Donaghy gets the impression that it's \ncalled football. We call it soccer for a good reason, we have our own sport \ncalled football (Aka Gaelic Football). And, you Americans call it soccer \nfor a similar reason,  you have a sport you guys call football. Same \napplies to Australians, I think. Aussie rules is referred to as Football as \nfar as I know (according to my cousin living there),  So there are plenty \nof reasons for calling soccer soccer.\n\nBy the way, for all these people who say \"its football! not soccer\" \nSoccer is \"footballs\" nickname, mainly because there was no way to \ndistinguish between rugby football and football.\nPretty much the whole world call soccer soccer, excluding European \ncountries. \n\nThat is my rant for the day ~",

Anyone in the marketing \ncommunications or advertising world understands that this ad is pure gold \nbecause of the exposure it gets Nike by association to the top 15-20 \nfootballers in the world. If every advertisement played out as \"this is our \nproduct, here are its features, it costs this much money,\" every \nadvertisement would be in the style of a late-night-only infomercial.\n\nNike doesn't care as much about selling individual products as it does \nbuilding brand loyalists. Every piece of apparel in the film is made by \nNike - boots, socks, jackets, shirts, gloves - all of it. By giving the \nviewer a direct link between their broad range of products and the best of \nthe best in the most popular sport ever devised by man, they are creating \nan image. \"If it's good enough for Eden/Ibra/CR7, it's good enough for \nme...\" Some people buy into the image, some don't.",
