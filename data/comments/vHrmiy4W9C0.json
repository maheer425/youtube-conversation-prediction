I understand what you mean by our \nperceptions cannot match up with the workings of the universe, which is why \nquantum and nuclear physics have only come into light in the past 100 \nyears. However, when looking at these phenomena often what is found is that \nthe fundamentals of physics are unchanged. Even in special relativity when \ntime dilates close to the speed of light, length is contracted and \nsimultaneity ceases to exist hence keeping everything in proportion with \neverything else. The issue is, if I could see someone actually trying to \nsupport their theory that time is a concept I would begin to accept it or \nat least indulge the notion.\nThat's not to say I don't think philosophy doesn't play a massive role in \nphysics, because I do! I agree that without freedom of thought the expanse \nof physics and philosophy would be much less than it is today. I originally \napplied for a degree in Theoretical Physics with Philosophy before changing \nto straight Physics so there's no offence taken :)\nI just think much deeper concepts are proposed by philosophy and just \nrepeating what someone else has proposed doesn't make a person in the \nremotest part introspective. If one thinks deeply whether time is a \nconcept, they'll find the proposition disproves itself in its entirety.\nI could propose that perhaps the energy created through a neuron firing \ncreates a fluctuation in spacetime and in turn is allowing us to create a \nnew dimension with every decision. Now, I understand that as a by-product \nof both multiverse, general relativity and string theory it could be \nconsidered to be a possibilty. That still doesn't make it worth thinking \nabout unless I try to determine the factual basis of the hypothesis because \notherwise I'd just be, \"kicking the philosophers can down the road\".",

It is very \nnatural for them to work together, because it heightens the chance of the \nchildren (and therefore the genepool) to live on. \nAs we discovered farming the small groups stayed in one place and started \ngrowing. If we would still be hunter gatherers the groups would split, but \nif you are a farmer this is much harder. Because there is so much food the \nsmall family groups would grow, and to with such bigs groups a more \nadvanced society than familygroups is necesarry, which lead to tribes. This \nlater developed into states.\n\nAll the traits that you describe are very useful in whatever context with \nsocial interaction, so also in the small hunter-gatherer groups. We can see \nprimitive forms of this in for instance chimps, who still live in small \ngroups. Because intelligence and cooperation helps with for instance \nhunting and war this evolved to the intelligence and positive \ncharactertraits we have now. \n\nFor primates being selfish, violent, and apathetic would mean being kicked \nout of the group, and would therefore be bad for their chance of survival. \nAll in all, this is a very incoherent ramble, but my point is that even \nfrom the beginning of humans (and even before the organisms could be \nconsidered modern humans_we lived together in small groups and this \nselflessness and charity were beneficial to us.

Just as some animals care for their \nyoung and travel in groups so did humans. One human couldn't hunt beasts or \nreproduce all alone. They worked together for the sake of survival. Over \ntime, realizing that caring for others (or the group) is more beneficial \nthen to be selfish probably influenced the evolution of our social behavior \nof generosity or even empathy.

The \nprevailing theory is that memories are formed by changing the connections \nbetween neurons (ie some neurons become more or less likely to fire due to \nexperience via the effects of different genes and proteins) and that they \nare distributed across different ensembles or populations of neurons. For \nexample, researchers have done experiments where they placed a mouse into a \nchamber and administered a brief, mild footshock and looked at what neurons \nwere activated. When the mouse is placed back into that same chamber he \nexhibits a freezing response, indicating that there is a memory of the \nexperience of something 'bad' happening there. When the mouse is placed \ninto a completely different environment, they don't freeze. However, using \noptogenetics, if the researchers stimulate those same neurons that were \nactive previously when the animal is now in the diff environment, they will \nsuddenly start to freeze, suggesting that those neurons are the ones \nresponsible for that memory.

You can say that the memory is stored in a Gestalt manner and \nbrought to the fore by stimulation of this area. Or that it is stored in \nthe neurological connections in this area. Or in this group of neurons. Or \nthis cluster is responsible for the retrieval of data from the higher \ndimensional plane on which our memories reside. In each of those theories, \nstimulating that portion of the brain could still summon forth a single \nmemory, even if the method by which it does so differs.\n\nI don't know if stimulation CAN retrieve a single memory or not, just that \nthe theories you present didn't inform on his statement one way or the \nother.",

The best way to understand people is to be \ncurious, ask open-ended questions (i.e., questions that can't be answered \nyes or no; e.g., how, what, why), and empathize.  I'm a psychologist, and \nwhile in school I did learn some broad theories about why people are the \nway they are, but these are, at best, only ideas about how some factors \ntend to affect other factors within a cultural context. The most important \nthing to know is that you cannot generalize one person's experience to \nanother's. Each has their own blend of past experiences, environments, \nrelationships, and biology. If you want to understand a person, you have to \nspend some time finding out by listening to what they have to say about \ntheir experiences, thoughts, and feelings. One really useful communication \ntool is to, after someone has shared something with you, explain to them \nwhat it is that you think they're saying. Then they can correct you if \nyou're off the mark, or elaborate. Hope this helps.",

You've created this completely fictional idea that \npsychology is the study of the human mind. It isn't. Psychology is the \nstudy of behavior and cognition. This is a domain of observable events.

Psychology fits within the \nlarger field of biology. Any study that analyzes behavior and/or cognition \nfits under the field of psychology. That includes many studies that overlap \nwith other fields, since psychology is so closely tied to neuroanatomy, \nneurochemistry, etc. I said leading into the list that many of the fields \nwere a fusion of psychology with other domains. News flash! Neurology is a \nsubfield of MEDICINE that is based on both psychology and anatomy. Why? \nBecause it concerns both anatomy and BEHAVIOR.\n\nAs for your assertion that autism requires an individualized approach, \nyou're completely right.

This control is used \nto drive secretion of hormones and allows regulation of heartbeat, \nbreathing rate, blood pressure, muscle tone, etc. They are also responsible \nfor forming snap judgments, which are forwarded up to the prefrontal \ncortices. This is a critical function; without it, the conscious mind would \nhave no notion of the emotional significance of anything. There's an \narticle on Wikipedia that explains a lot of this: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack\n\nThe amygdalas are the heart and soul of our personalities. Without them, we \nlose most of who we are. People with bilateral loss of the amygdalas prefer \nbeing alone and engaging in infantile activities over socializing, and have \nno idea of how to behave appropriately. They explore objects with their \nmouths, as though they were still infants. They tend to overeat, and \nattempt to copulate with random objects. To characterize them as the \"fear \ncenter\" or whatever is to *grossly* misunderstand them. It's also slightly \nannoying to hear people say \"the amygdala,\" as though we have only one.

Emotional \nmemories are tagged and responded to by the left amygdala in females, and \nthe right in males. Men have larger amygdalas with bigger, more insulated \nneurons, and they respond differently to stress as well. Women have smaller \namygdalas with smaller and more densely packed neurons, which are somewhat \nmore likely to trigger their neighbors at random than those in men. This \nhas been implicated in phenomena such as womens' abilities to more easily \nread faces and have multiple orgasms, and in mens' abilities to respond to \nfear with outward action rather than turning inward. However, different \npeople have different layouts according to their individual biology. Some \nmen are exceedingly good at reading faces, and some women are more prone to \nrespond to fear physically than not. So, it's important to understand that \nthese distinctions have a lot of individual variability.\n\nThe situation of the \"dominant\" amygdala in opposite hemispheres has \nfurther implications for behavior. The left hemisphere specializes in \nthought and maintaining status quo. The right hemisphere is less \ncognitively able, but can more easily see \"the big picture,\" is aware of \nthe entire scene rather than its specifically interesting parts, and must \noverride the left hemisphere when it's necessary to try something new; it's \nmore associated with action than with thought.\n\nIf you lose the non-dominant amygdala, your life may be mostly unchanged. \nIf you lose the dominant one, you lose most of yourself. It's best that \npeople understand these structures, what they do and how they work. They \nare central to everything we do.",

We know that by electrically simulating \nparts of the brain we can change how you behave and think. So is there a \nsoul? Like the existence of God, science has a hard time proving a negative \nso it can't really say either way. However science does seem to indicate \nthat a lot if not all of who you are lies in the brain. \n\nHowever to be devils advocate here. There is one interesting theory, that \nthe brain does not house consciousness but is simply the instrument of it's \nmanifestation. Think of a television. The TV program (the TV signal) does \nnot occur in the television itself, it is simply manifested on the \ntelevision. If the television is damaged the manifestation of the \ntelevision signal is altered (say the colors get jumbled up) but the signal \nitself is not affected by the TV. So using a logic like that one could \nargue that the soul exists outside the body, that the brain is the \nmanifestation-mechanism of the soul and that damage to the brain would thus \nnot impact the soul but the ability of the soul to manifest. Or something \nlike that. However this is a purely philosophical argument for which there \ncannot be proof or dis-proof.",

                    "text": "+Harrumphalumph \u201cResearches have confirmed that the heart has its own \nspecial nervous system, the heart has a complex intrinsic nervous system \nthat is sufficiently sophisticated to qualify as a \"little brain\" in its \nown right. The heart\u2019s brain is an intricate network of several types of \nneurons, neurotransmitters, proteins and support cells like those found in \nthe brain proper. Its elaborate circuitry enables it to act independently \nof the cranial brain \u2013 to learn, remember, and even feel and sense\u201d. When \nwe feel love it can take on a life of its own leading us by our senses and \nwhat we feel rather than what we think.\n\n\u201cThe heart has its own nervous system that is composed of approximately \n40,000 neurons. These neurons are connected differently and more \nelaborately than elsewhere in the body and while they\u2019re capable of \ndetecting circulating chemicals sent from the brain and other organs, they \noperate independently in their own right. Having it\u2019s own \u201cmini-brain\u201d is \nthe reason why heart transplants work, given the fact that severed nerve \nconnections do not reconnect in a different body. Furthermore, this \nelaborate nervous centre in the heart has more functions than simply \nregulating the electrical activities of the heart to keep it pumping\u201d.\n\nThe neurons in the heart\u2019s nervous system, called sensory neuritis, \u201cdetect \ncirculating hormones, neuro-chemicals and sense heart rate and pressure \ninformation. Neurons are responsible for storing information and loading it \ninto the blood cells to be distributed through out the body, it acts as the \nmemory of the computer which couldn\u2019t function without it. Hormonal, \nchemical, rate and pressure information is translated into neurological \nimpulses by the heart\u2019s nervous system and sent from the heart to the brain \nthrough several afferent (flowing to the brain) pathways. It is also \nthrough these nerve pathways that pain signals and other feeling sensations \nare sent to the brain. Researchers describe the brain and nervous system as \na distributed parallel processing system (it can compute multiple things at \nthe same time and act on each simultaneously) consisting of separate but \ninteracting groups of neuronal processing center\u2019s distributed throughout \nthe entire body.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe heart communicates with the brain and the rest of the body in three \nways documented by scientific evidence: neurologically (through \ntransmissions of nerve impulses), biochemically (through hormones and \nneurotransmitters), and biophysically (through pressure waves). In \naddition, growing scientific evidence is showing that the heart may \ncommunicate with the brain and body in a fourth way through electromagnetic \nfield interactions. Through these biological communication systems, the \nheart has a significant influence on the function of our brains and all our \nSystems. Scientists are discovering that our hearts may actually be the \n\"intelligent force\" behind the intuitive thoughts and feelings we all \nexperience\u201d.",

Back in 1935, a man by the name of Antonio Egas \nMoniz performed the first lobotomy. He also won the Noble piece prize \n(1949). The U.S. adopted this technique before psychiatric medication was \ninvented. They basically wiped out the frontal lobe from the pre-frontal \ncortex. Anywho, some of the results showed patients were more relaxed after \na damaged frontal lobe while other patients emotions changed \nuncontrollably. From this and research done on participants when \nexperiencing a type of emotion and measuring brain activity with  Magnetic \nReasoning Imaging scans, we can conclude that the frontal lobe has a \ntremendous control of emotional brain activity. Phineas Gage frontal lobe \nwas damaged, therefore he was not able to control his emotions chemical \n(neuroscience) wise. ",

If you truly plan to major \nin Psychology, you have to get either a Masters or a Phd in whatever field \n(Neuroscience, Industrial Organization, Clinical, Behavioral, Cognitive, \nEducational, etc..) of psychology you plan to study. You cannot, and I \nrepeat, you cannot do much if anything psychology related with a Bachelors. \nIf you want to become any type of Psychologist, you need a minimum of a Phd \nor a Masters in some cases. So if you still are interested, you have to \nreally consider if you are willing to be in school for an additional 5+ \nyears after you get your Bachelors in Psychology. Iv'e seen many people get \na Bachelors in Psychology, but never attend Graduate school to pursue a \nPhd. Without that Phd, you cannot become a Psychologist. So basically many \npeople do not finish. Iv'e also noticed many people are not aware of the \nlength of the career. You guys can do it, but you have to be realistically \naware of what you are getting yourself into. This is a rewarding field with \na lot of potential once you graduate. You either go all the way or don't do \nit at all. Wish you both the best of luck. ",
