But still, yeah the \nFocus RS was that price when it was new in 2009/2010 but it's half that \nprice now.\nAnd performance car enthusiasts care a great deal about comfort. Every \nPorsche, Ferrari, McLaren or similar brand produces cars that are very \nexciting when driven (very) fast but civilized and comfortable when driven \nnormally. Except for the hardcore track versions of course.\nAlso, taking out the backseats, carpets and trim doesn't change a cars ride \ncomfort. It changes handling and increases road noise.\n\nSo no, I would not love to have GT3 RS as a daily driver.

On \nanything but a smooth track surface the ride comfort will not be good.\n\nAnd paying more just to get something back that is in the standard version? \nWhy not safe lots of money, get a standard 265 RS or Focus ST and spent \njust a few k on the missing horses, cup tyres, racier suspension and big \nbrakes.

Just under 4 mm of tread left \non the front. \n\nI ended up putting new tyres on around 15000 miles, after swapping fronts \nand back when I got the car... I think I munch through them fast ;) the \nfronts were borderline illegal!\n\nI know this ST has a single ratio rack but can't remember what it is. It's \nnot a fabulous turning circle, but it's got plenty of movement lock-to-lock \nthanks to arch clearance.\n\nIt's electric assist steering so very light, but still pinpoint accurate. \nChris Harris really tells the truth.",

It corners so well, it's hard to believe something corners \nbetter, but I guess torque vectoring must. Does the new ST have a different \nsteering rack than the base models? mine does to give high speed accuracy \nbut it makes the turning circle pretty average. Torque steer seem fine on \nmine though it has less power, it certainly does like to wander at high \nspeeds at full throttle.\n\nYou are on second set of tyres already?\n\nmines just going on it's third set (bought 2 khumo ku22's to do highway \nmiles on) seems a waste to wear out pirelli's or re002's on the highway.

A colleague at work has that, I've \nhad a ride in it (no drive yet) and it's a much 'rawer' car, very \nmechanical - I liked it a lot.\n\nI also have the problem where it cuts power if I'm too aggressive letting \nthe clutch out. It's really embarrassing because it looks like you almost \nstalled ;-) You have to modulate throttle carefully above 3000 rpm - if you \nkeep it pinned, the turbo torque just spins the wheels! Short shifting \nthrough third gear is best for damp days.\n\nTorque steer is present a small amount on very uneven roads, but only if \nyou're really giving it some off the line. I'm very surprised how little \ntorque steer there is with this car.\n\nTramlining with the factory tyres is way more noticeable, the Bridgestone \nsidewalls are so stiff! I currently run Hankook Ventus Evo 2 K120s all \nround and it's a much more supple ride (still jiggly at low speeds, but \nnowhere near as twitchy, still loads of dry and wet grip).\n\nTorque vectoring is AMAZING and has saved me more than once. It doesn't \nfeel artificial - the car just pivots really happily around its centre \npoint and you quickly go from gentle understeer to nailing the corner in a \nlovely arc.\n\nYou can take sharp corners unbelievably quickly, and I'm sure it helps on \nfaster corners (e.g. tightly curved exit and entry ramps onto motorways), I \ncan do them at least 20 mph faster than I think I should be able to with my \nfoot on the gas.\n\nIf I know I need to disappear quick off the line, I always hit the Sport \nbutton. Anything more than 'moderate' departure results in it cutting \nthrottle.\n\nIt's also easy to make the TC light flash just with an 'enthusiastic' shift \nthrough first and second gear, you can get a brief bit of wheel chirp even \nin the dry. To be honest I've begun turning Sport on at every set of \ntraffic lights just to avoid the engine thinking I'm about to spin the \nwheels, it's way too conservative.",

Problem being if It spins while cornering it harshly cuts \npower to the engine.\n\nSo if you are pulling into a busy road and have to floor it while right \nturning into traffic, it will cut engine power for a second infront of \noncomming vehicles. So after having the stability control nearly kill me \nseveral times I turn it off in city driving.Does the new ST's still have \nany of these issues?\n\nQuite curious about the vectoring also, My ST doesn't have it, does the new \nST have no torque steer because of it?",
