DLCs being \noptional allows them to be more niche and with that, it means that DLCs can \ntake more chances to appeal to a smaller demographic. Some didn't like \nAnchorage's GoldenEye-esque gameplay and thought it not fit for the purism \nof Fallout's RPG nature whereas others like myself did. The solution isn't \nto make DLCs more accessible at the expense of experimentalness so that a \nDLC will more likely appeal to a wider base because that's boring and \nactually leads to less sales since people are less likely to buy a DLC \nwhich doesn't offer a notably different experience than what they're \nalready getting with the main game, essentially \"What's the point\" kinda \nattitude. Instead, the consumer should more readily consider whether or not \nthey'd enjoy a particular DLC before buying it while allowing the nature of \nDLCs to remain creative.\n\nIn summary, more niche means more excitement for a particular demographic \nat the expense of others being less likely to enjoy it but by concentrating \nthe overall excitement to a narrower portion of gamers, the DLC is more \nlikely to seem \"worth it\" for what the buyer is getting. Companies have \nrealized this which is why it's reflected in most DLCs nowadays. If someone \ndoesn't like a DLC, well then don't play it. It's not as if it's forced \nupon them in the main story. Just do a bit of research beforehand. This is \nonly really a problem for some OCD purists who have to beat everything even \nif they don't enjoy what they're playing. I'll admit though that I can even \nsometimes be like that.",

The hijacking or missile systems \ncould be solely for the gain of information and have nothing to do with \nsetting off the end of the Great War, or it could be an experiment to see \nwhat would happen if they did. It's a bit of a cop out to have to write off \ntheir motivations and unknowable, but it's suggested that Aliens are the \nones who fired the nukes. While the country is obscured from time, that \ninformation is rendered irrelevant. Aliens may be responsible for the \ndestruction of Earth; though Humans certainly aren't innocent given they \ncreated the weapons used in the first place.\n\nWhile I can understand how some people are irritated at this revelation, I \ndon't see how it conflicts with the theme, 'humans needlessly warring,' or \ndamages the series as a whole. Mothership Zeta was a fun ride and while it \nretconned/expanded on previously obscure bits of lore, I still think it's a \nnice addition to the universe. Alien technology, as stated in the video, \nhas always been integral to the technological advances we see in the game. \nI enjoy that aspect very much, and while I would've preferred the existence \nof aliens remain ambiguous, I can't say I'm angered at the existence of \nthis DLC.

Caught in the middle, the ruling \nElders made the only decision they could; they would still recognize Elder \nLyons as a leader of the Brotherhood of Steel, and the Citadel as their \nD.C. headquarters. But all support from the West Coast was thereby cut off. \nIf Lyons wanted to pursue his own agenda on the East Coast, he would have \nto do it alone.\"\n\nAnd this:\n\"They believed that by abandoning the Brotherhood of Steel\u2019s primary \nmission of acquiring new technologies, Elder Lyons had abandoned the very \nvalues that defined the order itself. One night, the dissenters departed \nfrom the Citadel, absconding with weapons, power armor, and other pieces of \ntechnology and equipment. This was, without question, Owyn Lyons\u2019 darkest \nhour. He had become a man of compassion and understanding, and couldn\u2019t \nhelp but sympathize with those who had left: he had abandoned the \nBrotherhood\u2019s primary mission. He recognized that, and took full \nresponsibility for it.\"\n\nP.S. Thank you for clearing that \"canon\" thing up, and thank you for this \ncivilized conversation!",
