St.Augustine discussed this quite heavily, and although me \nand him disagree on what constitutes a just war, I do wholeheartedly \nbelieve the concept is true (as true as true gets lol).\n\nAlso, the point is to turn the majority side to the ethical, so that way in \ndictating war, public policy, social spending etc., we are able to do so \nefficiently and also with respect to the lives that will be affected by \nsuch decisions. I also understand very well that the Israeli army isn't \ncomprised completely of murderous lunatics (I have seen videos of them fire \non civilians though, but one bad apple is not the entire case), but I don't \nbelieve the government there to be very just, at the top levels.\n\nDamn near no government is. I would just as easily shit on the governments \nof Iran, the US, China, France and any other nation for doing similar \nthings and I have repeatedly. Mostly the US because I live here, and news \non the government is easily obtained. Do I think China did the right shit \nin Hong Kong regarding how they handled the protests? Fuck no.\n\nI would murder thousands of 100% DNA evidenced, murder weapon known, \nwitness etc. of mass murderers, and I would just as easily get rid of those \nwho are fucking 13 year olds and younger regularly. There is people that \n*NEED* to go, but sadly enough they are everywhere and for some reason they \nseem to coagulate on the top levels of governments. Not to say there hasn't \nbeen legitimately trying hard, good honest leaders... just they seem to get \nkilled pretty young often times, and even those that were maybe half-assed \ndecent people still get murked :( . What these people need to do is fight \nback. Wage your own war against the bigots, extremists, and intolerant \nfucks. A jihad against all around disrespect to what it means to be alive.\n\nThat would be the spiritual war I would be down to join... but that's why \nyou spread the word and speak to as many people as you can. So slowly the \nlevel of critical thinking goes up... it's a change we *need* to make if \nwe're to make it as a species with the ability to annihilate damn near all \nthe planets in the solar system (We have thousands upon thousands of \nnuclear warheads on the planet), and soon be able to build super power \nlasers powered by fusion reactors. I'm not down for thoughtless violence, \nbut if comes to violence I will stand tall and take whatever's coming \nhopefully and Dish out the best that I can if I am to die for something I \nbelieve in. I hope it never comes to that, hence why I speak first. Fuck \nall that needless bullshit filling up the little smidgen of time I have in \nthis universe. I got shit to do :)",

I'm not trying to be \nargumentative btw, I would hope that you feel the same way.\n\nAnyways, I understand all the cultures I listed quite well. I also \nunderstand no culture is perfect, it's more a journey towards perfection \n(like life itself). But in this journey we can take what was right and \nleave the rest, and grow from knowing the histories of the people whom came \nbefore us; and not disregard their wisdom along with their faults.\n\nAlso, yes; I would rather have people joining the army knowing they may end \nup cannon fodder and doing so honorably, as opposed to coming to the \nconclusion that killing is the only thing that matters and as long as \nyou're alive; fuck the rest. This would serve as a barrier to war as well, \nbecause the human costs would be much higher, and I think we could do well \nwith a reminder of what war is really costing us as a people. Namely \npeople...\n\nThe only way we change reality is to change the way we think about reality. \nDMX \"It doesn't have to be the way it is, just because the past twenty \nyears everyday it is\". There's a huge lesson to be learned in these lyrics. \nThat is not the attitude of a defeatist, which is what I'm sensing coming \nfrom you when you talk about ethics and moral philosophy. The more people \ntalk about it and implement it in their everyday personal lives, the closer \nwe come to the reality of which you call a fiction. I would gladly die to \nspread this word, and I would be willing to fight tooth and nail for this \nas well; if it ever came to that. I understand violence well, I also \nunderstand it's price; that's what living in a violent environment will do \nto you... hence the code of honor I have set among myself regarding it.\n\nI hope one day people like you will preach the message of ethics and \nbeneficial change as quickly as you have been to denounce it as a fairy \ntale, because honestly... \"we\" could use every damned on of you in the \nfight to make this world a forward thinking and more equitable place for \nall. None of the societal changes you hold so dear would've became a \nreality with a defeatist attitude. I understand that my goal may not be met \nin my lifetime... but that's not the purpose. The purpose is to make it \nbetter for the ones coming long after us, this shit is a lot bigger than \nyou or me ya know?",

We can place a blue cup on our desk \nand get hundreds of people to tell us what is on the desk.  I can't imagine \na scenario where someone would not validate that it is indeed a cup, but a \nfew may be unable to validate the color.  The reason that it has such deep \nimplications is this.  If what I perceive is inaccurate, then how can I \nfind truth?  Is the pursuit of truth impossible if I cannot trust my senses?",

                    "text": "Scientific American has a \u201cAsk the Expert\u201d series, and someone asked why it \nwas impossible to tickle yourself.\n\n*The answer lies at the back of the brain in an area called the cerebellum, \nwhich is involved in monitoring movements. Our studies at University \nCollege London have shown that the cerebellum can predict sensations when \nyour own movement causes them but not when someone else does. When you try \nto tickle yourself, the cerebellum predicts the sensation and this \nprediction is used to cancel the response of other brain areas to the \ntickle.*\n\n*Two brain regions are involved in processing how tickling feels. The \nsomatosensory cortex processes touch and the anterior cingulate cortex \nprocesses pleasant information. We found that both these regions are less \nactive during self-tickling than they are during tickling performed by \nsomeone else, which helps to explains why it doesn\u2019t feel tickly and \npleasant when you tickle yourself. Further studies using robots showed that \nthe presence of a small delay between your own movement and the resulting \ntickle can make the sensation feel tickly. Indeed, the longer the delay, \nthe more tickly it feels. So it might be possible to tickle yourself, if \nyou are willing to invest in a couple of robots!*\n\nHmm, so the key here seems to be the inability to predict *what* movement \nsomeone is going to do to try to tickle you. Only novel sensations tickle, \nand they aren\u2019t novel if you made them. I want to know what study used \nrobots to tickle people. Cause thats just crazy.\n\n*Unashamedly copied and pasted from scienceblog website*",
