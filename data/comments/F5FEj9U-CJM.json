Humans have \n3 colour receptive cones whereas the mantis shrimp has 12. We can obviously \nsee more than 3 distinct colours, there are just 3 base colours from which \nall colours we see are made: blue, green and red. The amount of light \nabsorbed and reflected ultimately determines the colour.  A dog has two \ncolour receptive cones (detects green and blue), and butterfly has five \n(detects green, blue, red, ? and ?. It just means they can see 9 different \nBASE colours we can't see (green, blue, red, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and ?. \nWhich means that it is able to see thousands of times more colours than we \ncan. So a rainbow for the mantis shrimp would be like a thermonuclear \nexplosion of colours.

Of course, the design of the mantis shrimp visual system \nis so alien and our understanding of it is so rudimentary, the tests might \nbe asking the wrong question in the wrong way to accurately measure their \ntrue abilities. \n\nWhile all those photoreceptor types do imply a tradeoff loss of spatial \nresolution, in theory some of the spatial resolution can be recovered by \nthe way the eye is constructed, such that that 3 different eye regions all \nview the same region of space (trinocular vision in each eye). \n\nI think we have little clue yet how their target recognition may work!\n\nA couple links for more info:\n\nhttp://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/23/the-mantis-shrimp-sees-like-a-satellite/\n\nThoen, How, Choiu & Marshall. 2013.
