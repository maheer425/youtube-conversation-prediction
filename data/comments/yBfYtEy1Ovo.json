No one \nhas to worry about whether or not it counts as killing a person, and \neveryone gets to imagine a happy scenario where a previously barren couple \ngets to experience the feel good movie of raising a kid.

Unfortunately, sometimes those upbringings lead to less \nopen minds (not that I am implying this in your case. That's actually a \nstatement on my own upbringing). My main goal, which I'm glad I was able to \nachieve, is to broaden horizons. I'm not telling you to change your entire \nview on everything (because that is a very difficult thing to do that comes \nwith a lot of internal growth), but merely to look from perspectives \noutside your own, as well as your own, in order to form a more informed \nopinion.\n\nAs I said before, I was raised in a Christian family in the south \n(originally). Many members of my family still view homosexuality as a sin \nand sex as something to only be done between married couples. I used to \nshare that closed-minded approach to people. But then I broadened my \nhorizons and came to understand that making harsh judgements on people I \ndon't know will get me nothing but negativity in my life. So I let go of \nthe majority of those things that make me judge rashly, and I'm much \nhappier for it. I see people for who they are, and not what they do (or who \nthey do). I'm still in the process of that internal growth, and by no means \nan expert, and there are still some things that I struggle with. It's an \nongoing process.\n\nWow I really got derailed from the topic there. lol\n\nBut anyway. I commend you for wanting to initiate some growth within \nyourself by learning from others. I don't think a youtube comment was the \nbest way to go about it, simply because there are a lot of people who would \nrather argue than teach. I don't think it's pathetic of you to want to \nlearn to broaden your views from other people, only that you may want to \nfind a more opinion-safe place to do so.\n\nI'm glad I could help in some of your growth, and best of luck to you in \ncollege.",

                    "text": "I know you won't respond to this, but I would like to enlighten you.\n\nFirst, you are in no position to judge anybody for having (or not having) \nsex. Now, the age of consent in most US states is 16, but people will \nexperiment. Most bodies aren't ready for sex or babies until they are past \nmiddle school anyway, so your thing about 12-year-olds holds no place.\n\nSecond, you're right. Sex isn't everything. But having sex doesn't \nautomatically mean you're going to have a baby. Especially if you take \nproper precautions (condoms and birth control come to mind). If given the \noption (and the proper information), people are more likely to choose to \nuse protection so as to avoid unwanted pregnancies and STDs. Also, don't \nsay \"or worse abortion\". Because abortion is not a fun decision to make, \nbut you don't get to decide if someone is better or worse for having (or \nnot having) one.\n\nNowhere in the video did it say that the Bible is fake. I was raised a \nChristian myself. My boyfriend was raised Catholic. We both had sex before \nwe were twenty. We are both getting ready to graduate college; I'm \ngraduating next year with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in \nMathematics. Sex doesn't ruin your life, especially if you have it out of \nwedlock. That's just a ridiculous standard set up by a religious \norganization that really doesn't get to have any say in what people do with \ntheir bodies.\n\nAnd on the homosexuality thing. Again, comes from a ridiculous standard set \nup by a religious organization that really doesn't get to have any say in \nwhat people do with their bodies. If I had sex with a lady (as I am \nfemale), it would not affect you or your family in any way, shape, or form. \nIt is not \"immoral\" and it certainly not something people \"choose\". \nSexuality is part of a person's makeup and cannot be altered by other \npeople.\n\nSo, if you please, get off your high horse and stop judging people. And as \na final note, I would like to direct you to Luke 6:37 \"Judge not, and you \nwill not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, \nand you will be forgiven.\"\n\nHave a nice day.",

An induced (or \"therapeutic\") abortion is caused \ndeliberately in order to end the pregnancy. Abortions are (most safely) \ndone in the first trimester (before the 12th week of pregnancy).\". \nAbortions are usually not performed in the Second (13th Week) or Third \n(24th Week) trimester, unless the fetus is severely deformed, or the \nMother's life is in danger. It's not just \"15 year old girls\", either. \nThat's a huge stereotype. Abortions are performed on almost all ages. From \nstatisticbrain.com, \"Younger than 15; 0.4%. Age 15-17; 6%. Age 18-19; 11%. \nAge 20-24; 33%. Age 25-29; 24%.\". Sex is NOT just for procreation, it is \nUSED for procreation, but not just for it. Sex is to make people feel good, \nand it's fun. Seriously, I respect you are anti-Abortion, but at least do \nsome research.",

If a 12 year old has sex with another 12 year old, what is most \npotentially damaging; the sex it self, or the strain of going through court \n(in some countries) or the moral outrage to come?\n\nAnd do you really think that teens who send nudes to eachother justifies \nconvictions of production and/or obtaining or keeping child pornography? In \nmy mind, this is simply disasterous... Children, and especially teens, are \nsexual being as much as we are but in a different way. By moralizing over \nit, we might end up causing harm when our intent is to shield.\n\nSomething to keep in mind, that's all.\ufeff",

However, their feelings do play a part in their \ndevelopment and thus my concern.\n\nI'm just saying that we should be careful about moral judgements like this.\n\nAnd arresting and prosecuting a 16 year old for having nudes of his or her \nsweetheart on their phone?

I usually don't believe them, but I walked in on people \nfucking after a house party where I played with my band (I play bass btw). \nSince then, I've been hearing a lot of stories (some false, but a lot of \nthem true). It drives me insane, because I've never gotten any interest \nfrom the opposite sex and I don't understand how people can do it this \nearly. I mean, we're still underage for fucks sake!

                    "text": "+FlamRoyalBaer I think sex is such a big deal is because the kind of \nmaipulation you just mentioned. Everybody is trying to have sex with \neverybody else, while at the same time making sure that they are not \nmaipulated. And once you have kids and know \"how the game is played\" you \nwant to prepare them to not be maipulated, even it means that they have to \nfocus on their own sexuality more then their partners. The result of that \nideology would be \"sex is the most important thing\".\n\nOn the other hand, I do think that your sexuality is a big part of your \npersonality. Think of it like this: The entire day you meet people of \ndifferent nations, different sexes and different opinion and it is your \n\"mission\" to get a long  with these people at work/school, etc... So \neventually your will adapt and showing different aspects of your \npersonality to different people or tell different people different thing \nabout your life. Sex means that there is a person who you trust (or at \nleast that's how it should be), so you open your self up for the most \nintimate part of yourself: Your sexual desires. Of all the people that you \nknow, only a small fraction wll ever see you in such a way. So sexuality is \nimportant. But finding out what really satisfies you is a difficult \nmission, because your sex partners also have different desires. So you have \nto lear about your desires and how to fullfill them while at time \nfullfilling the desires of your partner. That is tricky when you don't have \nthe right partner.\n\nAt the end sexually is in important part of your life. whatever sexuallity \nmeans for you is a different question, but having a partner that has a \ncompletely different sexuality is very difficult. because you will never be \nsatisfied. It is like never being able to eat your favorite foods, sure you \nwill survive, but there will always be a hunger. The person you are with \nmust be worth going on this \"diet\"/different sexuality and many people are \nnot.\n\nWe will always be in this quest to find out what we need, while trying to \nnot be manipulated into doing things",

Mhmmm... the thing is, it \nis ever about manipulation, that this whole first time is such a big thing \nfor most people is because everywhere everything tells them it would be. So \nif the first time isn't good or somehow they think they where manipulated \nit is horrible for them, if you manipulate right it can be great, or they \njust don't give a fuck. Live is a manipulation. But somewhere you must be \nmanipulated or your character would taste like glaze!. Exactly like \nnuthing. So we know in which way we are manipulated, so the first time \nshould be at least with someone more or less special, not some sucker, and \nI talk about both sides.\n\nAlso you can manipulate your own opinion on that, but that is kinda hard to \ndo. But let us say you manipulate yourself to think random sex is evil, and \nthan you have sex because someone finaly manipulates you to do so, but \nwithout real whole manipulation, which you also could say as learning or \nwhatever you want to call it, psychological damage will be gigantic.\n\nIf you say it is no big deal for you, than damn the world manipulates you \neverywhere to think otherwise. And it has a practical reason, having sex \nwith alot of people and don't care about it, or just see it like a friendly \nhandshake, sexual diseases would spread like weed.\n\nThe only thing I hate about it is that so many people make it to such a \nhuge thing that it controls their life, like they would be some primitiv \nsavage, yes, expecially in relationship. Man the sex shouldn't be the most \nimportant, it should be one of the less important things you see in a mate. \nAnd if you can't have directly sex with each other, I mean for medical \nreasons, this shouldn't break up the whole thing. And yes there are some \nstupid tv shows from America shown here that say \"Oh if you can't have sex \nI recomand you break up, no relationship works without sex, IT IS THE MOST \nIMPORTANT THING!\".\nEven this is a bit offtopic, I just wanted to mention it. And btw. in even \nin such a case, you canhave somekind of sexual activity. So yea, where is \nthe problem? Even if your mate would have HIV well he or she could do a \nlittle handjob, I mean come on!.",

Of course \nthere is something. But let me ask you this, how the fuck do your parrents \nknow that you have sex? Huh? That is the whole joke on this law. You only \nwill get use of it if we talk about rape, but if both sides agree none of \nthem will tell if it's illegal, would you?",

I \nthink that an animal that is dependant on you for food and shelter will \nmost likely not fight yu off like a women would do. Whether an animal is \nsexually attracted to you or is just doing it because the provider/alpha \nmale wants to cannot really be answered and in that case we should consider \nit rape/animal abuse. Clear consent is the verbal and continuous \nagreement(, that's why women keep shouting \"oh yes\" ;) )\n\nAs for teenie love, If I remember correctly, the law is as follows: Sex is \nillegal if the kids are under 14 in any way. So both partners must be at \nleast 14. If one partner is older than 18 the other cannot be under 16. \nHowever, German law will consider the relationship between the two. So \nlet's say your 16 and your dating a 13 year old. By the time you have sex \nfor the first time you and your parnter are 15 and 18. When the parents sue \nyou the fact that you were in a relationship for 2 years before even \nattempting to have sex would likely not make you a pedophile or sexual \npredator.",

                    "text": "+damnedspike Well I think if that count, you also can do with most animals, \nbecause they all have a kind of language. Unless you show me evidence that \ngorillas can speak a complex language. But also they are very close to \nhumans, so kinda not that big deal, technical of course.\n\nQuestion is, how many people have a deep reason to do it with animals, like \nnone. Only like 1 or 2 person out of a million. And they would know to hide \nit. So you can assume most people who do it don't have a deep reason, just \na sucky one. So they could also let it be. Than the question what does it \nto the animal, I gues msot animals would be cool as long as they are not \nforced. But since you can force some so easily.\n\nSo actually I think best idea to keep it illegal, so no senseless abuse of \nanimals. Of course if you get cought but proof you never forced the animal \nyou can get excused. But only than.\n\nBtw. rules and reality, you know the legal age to have sex? As far I know \nmany people over here have their first tie between 13 and 15. Is that good \nor bad? Depends on how the kiddies did it. And if you find that your child \nowns a condom, don't rage like \"you have sex already?\" more like \"well good \nthing you know how to protect you! Very Responsible!\" if it happens it \nhappens better if they are protected.^^",

So, coinciding this with the natural age \npuberty hits, it makes sense then that a child at the age of 11 who has \nstarted feeling horny, should be more than capable of understanding the \ndangers and complication of sex. \n\n2. whore by definition is a prostitute. I understand that tomska was using \nthis word because others use it as an insult, but this is very important. a \nSLUT is not the same as a WHORE. a Whore is someone who has sex for money, \nthat's why the expressing \"Whoring someone/yourself out\" is used when you \ndo something shameful or undesired because you need compensation in some \nway. a slut is someone who has sex with multiple partners without care. a \nNymph/Nympho/Nymphomaniac is someone who has to have sexual pleasure and \nhas either a compulsion, addiction, or both. It is both not wrong, nor \nshameful. Some people are addicted to coffee. other people have to catch \ntheir favorite re-run of a soap-opera every day. We are all different and \nyou should be glad your problem at least gives you pleasure, though that \nmight be one of the reasons its hard for you personally to break that \ncompulsion if you try to be better. \ufeff",

It's actually \naround 15 that a child's mind is comparable to an adult's and even then it \nisn't fully developed until their 20's. The reason the age of consent \nusually sits around 16 to 18 is because by the time a child reaches this \nage, you can be reasonably sure that they have reached maturity, regardless \nof differences in development time. \n\nAlso to be considered is that sex isn't a purely biological event, there \nare issues such as pregnancy, emotional manipulation, social consequences, \nSTIs and legal issues that a child isn't fully equipped to understand. Keep \nin mind that they have only begun to develop out of an egocentric mindset. \nAs for adults, when you are able to interact with people who are comparable \nin maturity to yourself, why should you go for someone who is somewhere \nbetween child and adult? Given that life expectancy is trending upwards, \nand reproduction isn't as urgent, we should be trending away from \nfetishizing youth.

That explains a lot of it then I \nguess. You're lack of understanding on this subject and the morals of it...\n\nFirstly, most children do NOT properly understand the consequences of child \nbirth at below 13. And nor is that the only point of sexual intercourse. \n(Which you failed to mention). And no adult can properly know that, without \nhanding them a test and questionning them thoroughly. Which is even more \nfucking messed up.\n\nAnd besides that, who's to judge if they have the proper desire for sex? \nAre you? No ahahaha. And nor are they because they're UNEXPERIENCED and \nYOUNG. You, and your attempts at justifying all this makes you completely \noblivious to basic flaws and wrongs in your argument. It's part of a \npedophiles psychology too, trying to justify their sick believes in an \nattempt to preserve any self-respect they still have for themselves before \nthey found out.\n\nAnd yes. The human brain is capable of reason and logic at 11. But to what \nlevel? They are not as experienced, emotionally, mentally or physically as \nadults. They are not as well educated as most adults and they have not \ndeveloped as much as adults. And whatever you say, or attempt to justify; \nstill doesn't wrong the point of their pre-frontal cortex being \nundeveloped. \n\nYou may say \"oh, but it might be!\" Or \"it might have started!\" But how the \nfuck are you going to know that? Are you going to conduct a test? You're \ndelusional as fuck. And almost definitely a pedophile at this point.\ufeff\n\nThe law is there for many reasons. One is that 13 year olds are easily \nmanipulated, and are not mature enough to make proper decisions. Oh, and \nalso. Due to the fact you have Aspergers, you are NOT generilisable to the \nmajority in anyway, so please don't even bother with that argument.",
