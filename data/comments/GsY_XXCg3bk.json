Which in turn leads to the first thing.\nIt's very hard not to place the blame on white America when blacks even \ntoday are stopped for DWB, or hassled in dept stores for the color of their \nskin.\nThere are huge cultural problems in underclass black America, but telling \nthem to clean up their own act when white America helped cause and foster \nthem is just being mean.",

It's not \ngiving them the choice.  God doesn't want people to love Him because He \nforces them to love Him.  Imagine if the only reason your friends wanted to \nbe with you, respect you, and interact with you is because you forced them \nto do so.  That wouldn't be love, it'd be the only option.  \n\nRegarding God preventing a lot of unnecessary suffering;  who are you to \nsay what is unnecessary?  Some people would say that the suffering endured \nby the soldiers in world war II was unnecessary, but without it, we'd \nprobably be having this conversation in German right now.  The necessity of \nsuffering is relative.  Obviously, in a perfect world everyone would get \nalong and there would be no suffering.  And that is the world we would \nbelong to if mankind hadn't disobeyed God.  But because they did, then \nentered the first dose of suffering, that is, the consequence of the \ndisobedience.  Can you think of any kind of hate act or evil a person can \ndo that is not prohibited in the Bible?  No?  That's because God's design \nis for us to love one another and love Him.

One, for us to \nacknowledge our sins and that we fall short of perfection, and therefore \ncannot be in the presence of a holy God.  Two, for us to believe that God, \nthe one true God, sent His son to die for us so that we could be forgiven \nof our sins.  And three, to make Jesus the Lord of our lives by casting out \nour sin (to the best of our human ability) and starting a relationship with \nHim.  The reason Jesus had to die was because someone had to take the \npunishment meant for the world's sins.  So instead of having the Flood \nhappen again where God destroys everyone because of their wickedness, He \ndecides to instead die for us and be punished for something He didn't even \ndo.  God says that Jesus' blood saves us.  If we don't believe and then \nmake God our focus, we don't deserve that kind of beautiful, unconditional \nselflessness.  And God does make Himself known.  The Bible says that \nmankind is without excuse for rejecting God because of the world around us. \n Even many Atheists say that their entire being cries out for a God or \nCreator.  But because they can't see Him, he isn't there.  I would read the \nCase for Christ if you are truly interested in the proof for God and \nChristianity, because it's simply something that is too long and complex to \nrelay to you on YouTube",

There are thousands of \ncases of young white children (not 17 year old thugs) being killed by \nblacks that never make the national news.\n2)  Many black children struggle in school, yes.  But it's not because some \ninvisible group of evil white people are holding them down...it's because \nthose children's parents have no interest in being involved in their \neducation.\n3)  My original objection was to this asshole's comparison of Trayvon \nMartin and Sandy Hook.  Innocent little preteen children were randomly shot \nto death at an elementary school.  That is nothing like the Trayvon \nincident...he was beating the shit out of someone who decided to defend \nthemselves with a gun.  Trayvon wasn't even in school because he was \nsuspended 3 times that year for fighting.  Comparing the two situations and \nAmerica's reaction to them is just silly and downright offensive.

It is not necessary to prove that the person making the \nthreat had the intent to actually carry out the threat.

Because our alley was free for the most part of bags \nof garbage. The building on next street had alley FULL of trash bags and \ngarbage? Why? Because the predominantly black tenants had a habit of \nthrowing the trash out the window rather than carrying it down to dumpster. \nAgain, my mother would have screamed if I DARED throw garbage out my \nwindow..

And why don't \nyou  define \"Black Culture and \"White Culture\" for me? Because I'm a bit \nconfused. My family is of Caribbean decent. My family is also mixed with \nBlack, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Native American. My husband is Caucasian \nand Latino--and after being with him all these years, I don't know what you \nmean by \"White Culture\". There is nothing that he does as a White \nperson \"culturally\". See, what you don't seem to understand is that there \nis no monolithic or pan-American black culture. My cultural customs are \nquiet different than other American Blacks because I am Caribbean. So I \ncan't speak on what \"Black Culture\" is, because all blacks do not share the \nsame culture.  If you refer to Black Culture as what you see on TV, then \nno. \n\nAnd also, where in this did I blame whites? I blamed socio-economic and \neducational, and mental health issues for the increase in crime--not \nwhites.  You are projecting a strawman argument on me. I never once said \nwhites are to blame. I just used your logic--basing violent and criminal \ntendencies on race, rather than socio-economic and educational \ndisparities--and asked you to explain why a neighborhood that is \npredominately Black has less crime than a neighborhood that was not \npredominately Black. I used your own logic to ask if it was then (again \nunder your logic) okay to blame the 5 fold increase of whites as a reason \nfor the crime rate. That's your logic, Kiddo. Not mine. \n\nAnd BTW--MOST DEATHS ARE CAUSED BY FIREARMS across the board--of all races. \nAnd when you speak of Victims vs. Criminals, do you factor in that many \nviolent crimes remain unsolved? We don't know the data. We don't know who \ncommitted those crimes. How can you automatically assign blame when you \nlack to data to empirically prove your case. \n\nYou are attacking arguments I am not making simply because I proved your \nlogic wrong. I think it's time you remove your bias and look further into \nthe reasoning behind your crusade. Don't change the argument and attack me \nfor opinions I do not hold. The issue is you think you know what I am \nthinking and what beliefs I hold. You are assuming and know nothing about \nme or what I think. ",

What I did was to point \nout a disparity between arrest and conviction rates, as well as how \nprofiling has a lot to do with those arrest and conviction rates. The \nnotion of \"White on White\" or \"Black on Black\" crime is a farce--as I \nexplained that MOST crimes are committed against people of their own race. \nCrime is crime and murder is murder. Labeling it as a racial issue, rather \nthan a socio-economic and mental health issue is wrong. It's as much of a \nfarce as it is when people say there are no black serial killers. That is \nfalse too. There are black AND white serial killers, although the most \nnotorious ones happen to be white, giving serial killing a white face. In \nreality, it's about the same when it comes to serial killers. \n\nLet's look at the FACTS that I presented:\n\nBaldwin Hills--\n\nProfile: 71% Black, 17.3% Latino, 3.3% White, 4.7% Asian, and 3.4% other. \n$37,948 median household income, 24.1% of residents 25 and older have a \nfour-year degree.\n\nCrime Rate summary for the last 6 months: 177 VIOLENT CRIMES -- 739 \nPROPERTY CRIMES--285.1 CRIMES PER 10,000 PEOPLE (Most of these crimes are \nTheft and burglary, BTW, not violent crimes)\n\nDowntown LA -- \n\nProfile: 36.7% Latino, 22.3% Black, 16.1% White, 21.3% Asian, 3.5% other-- \n$15,003 median household income (2008 dollars), 17.9% of residents 25 and \nolder have a four-year degree--An overwhelming majority have \"less than \nhigh school\" educations. \n\nCrime Rate summary for the last 6 months:  500 VIOLENT CRIMES -- 1,938 \nPROPERTY CRIMES  -- 117.5 CRIMES PER 10,000 PEOPLE (Most of these crimes \nare property crimes, with the violent crime more than doubled of that of \nBaldwin Hills). \n\n*____________________________________*\n\nConclusion: The fact that Baldwin Hills is predominately black does NOT \nshow and increase in Violent crimes. What seems to differ is the income \ndisparity as well as the education levels of these people. Race is not as \nmuch of a factor. Baldwin Hills has 50% more black people than the Downtown \narea. \n\nUnder your logic, Baldwin Hills would automatically have a higher crime \nrate than that of Downtown, seeing that over 70% of the population is \nblack. The white population of Downtown Los Angeles is more than 5x's \nhigher than in Baldwin Hills. \n\nSo again, tell me how this plays into the logic that Blacks automatically \ncommit more crimes? Can we blame the increase of crime in Downtown LA \nbecause there are approximately 4.8 times more White people there? Blacks \nonly make up 22% of the population Downtown. \n\nI think I've made my point PERFECTLY clear. ",

That means they are getting convicted \nat a higher rate. In truth, blacks and whites commit crimes at the same \nrate--but arrest and conviction rates differ. You are confusing \nsocio-economic issues with race. Crimes like selling drugs and petty theft \nare most certainly a product of being in a poorer environment, not because \nof the race or innate criminality of a group of people. I'm sure if you \nlook at the crime statistics of Baldwin Hills (The Black Beverly Hills), \nyou would find less crime than an area like East LA or Downtown LA. Those \nare just the facts. Also, let's not forget that the people most likely to \nshop-lifting studies have also showed that there is very little disparity \nbetween blacks and whites. However, if blacks are being followed in stores \nbased upon race--those who are stealing will be caught at a higher rate. \nWhat you are arguing is that blacks are genetically inferior to whites and \nthat our criminality is a result of us being Black. That just isn't true. \nThis has a lot to do with overlapping systems of oppression. Remember: Not \nall blacks are poor, uneducated, or criminals. Much of this has to do with \nthe environment that one comes from--and no, not every black person was \nraised in the \"ghetto\". I surely wasn't. ",

My hopes are that, ideally, people like you would stop buying \nwholesale into ignorant beliefs and values and traditions, that some races \nare innately unintelligent or evil, which is known to be ridiculous by all \nbut a few scientists who are known by the others to be extremists and \nillogical. You say, my points are pointless, but they've \nlogically countered most, if not, all of your points, so maybe they are \nmeaningless to you, but they are logically relevant by any definitions of \nlogic or argument any logician has contrived.   Here I'll make a couple of \nother counterpoints. \n\nYour notion of IQ tests is wrong, because most educators know it is \nvirtually impossible to create a test both well rounded AND devoid of \ncultural bias.  Even a math test full of equations, which is as close \nto free from cultural bias as you may get, is not testing all of the \nintelligence complex.  In other words, intelligence is a vast phenomenon, \nand even if you can get a test to test a few mental processes, it would \nleave out others, and to test all of them would be difficult to do without \nlanguage, which opens the door to much cultural bias.  \n\nAs well, your conception of \"inference\" is wrong (look up \"inference\" and \n\"implication\"); I made very little inferences in my previous post. But \nthat's beside the point.  What makes a person truly wise is when he knows \nhe is wrong and to be open to the fact that he is plentiful wrong.  Again, \nI am not a scientist, but I know enough to know that most of my science \ncolleagues would scoff at your notions.  Human beings are complex, and no \nstats in the world can explain the various and vast behavioral patterns \nthroughout history.  And even if we can use them to help us understand our \ncurrent Black communities in American society, we cannot use them to make \nsweeping generalizations about crime, evil, and intelligence like you and \nothers have done here.

Even your idea \nabout intelligence, however, is so warped and outdated (Nazi outdated), \nthat you fail to understand (1) that all humans share 99% (I think 99.9%) \nof DNA, and that (2) intelligence, according to cognitive scientists, \nlargely figures environmental interaction with the sensory and electrical \nand chemical make up of the brain. I could quote you University study after \nstudy that would squash whatever outdated data you have.  You're pulling \nstuff from 1911, when the last 2 decades have cracked the DNA code and have \nseen cognitive and neuro scientists make tons of steps into understanding \nmore about an organ that still poses as a mystery.  \n\nFinally, in response to your words, \"so I gave him stats\": Really? That's \nyour response.  So you give him stats that you appear not to understand \nfully.  If I don't understand something fully, I (1) try to be more humble, \nor (2) try to understand it the best I can, or (3) put a disclaimer, or (4) \nkeep my mouth shut until I can better understand the context of what \nI'm talking about.  Look, my disclaimer is this: science isn't my \nspecialty, but I know enough to know that intelligence doesn't vary from \nrace to race, that all humans possess a potential for thinking beyond all \nother species (as far as we know), and that yes, environmental factors (not \nalone, though) significantly impact human intelligence and its capacity \nto develop.  The moment you realize that no race is innately bad or dumb, \nthe wiser you will be, my friend.  But if you really want to learn more \nabout your arguments, research Nazi science.      ",

As someone who teaches college students how to use and research \nstats, the only one who comes close to understanding the fragile nature of \nstats is Drue (see above).\n\nCould I give you a bunch of stats and historical cases and expert names who \nlink Black crimes to economics? Sure, most of the experts in Criminal \nJustice and Sociology.  Could I give you stats and historical names which \nwill link many of the more sick, non-economically motivated crimes to \nwhites?  Again, sure I could; I mean you can probably name many of them on \nyour own.  But would that make a difference?  You sound like you've already \nmade up your mind, and your stats are NOT necessarily wrong.  You're just \nnot analyzing them and their contexts correctly and you're not seeing how \nthey beg a number of questions, how they lead to more questions than \nanswers.  The fact that you cannot analyze them with a little more scrutiny \nand that you are seeing them the way you are leads me to believe that you \nare the one with a racist lens.\n\nAnyway, my point is that race itself figures very little into crime.  \nHumans are just f-ed up. No baby is born evil, man. Chemical make-up can \nscrew up people, but mostly history and environment and economics and \nemotions, etc., cause people to do f-ed up things.  Even those white serial \nkillers weren't born evil.  If you're religious, you can attribute it to \nsin, but there is a reason why the old clich\u00e9 \"money is the root of all \nevil\" has lasted so long. It's not about White, Black, Hispanic, etc., and \nmost of my colleagues in Criminal Justice, Sociology,  and Psychology know \nthis.  Most people who rely on FOX and CNN for their primary research do \nnot.  I should also add that most people who just go get a bunch of random \nstats off a website don't either.",

But all that needs time and we had a century to improve and \noptimize our social systems and still nobody would say that they are \nperfect. \n\nI have no clue about your \"races\". To classify humans into \"races\" is \nconsidered as racism here in Europe, so I think I know what you mean as \nmuch as I know you somehow distingiush between \"Whites\", African American, \nLatinos (whatever the difference is between Latinos and \"Whites\") and \nEastern Asians which you just call \"Asians\". I already chatted with a lot \nof US people over YT (probably like 400) and of course a lot of came up \nlike you with the racist argument and this is always a little bit strange \nfor me, because you are probably also an adult and for you randomly \nselected cosmetic attributes of one person are a valid explanation for his \nor her behavior. \n\nIn Europe we just distingiush between nationality or national heritage. \nGermany for example got today 20% of its population with a non-european \nbackground (including me), but if you are born here or just got the German \npassport you are a German (also statistically). \n\nYou know, around 20-30 years ago we had this discussion which was really \nbig in German media and politics, which was about especially the turkish \ncommunity in Germany and the partly foundation of \"ghettos\" and \"parallel \nsocieties\" and \"how can it be that some of them cant even speak German!!\" \nand many German politicians said \"this cant be, these 'evil' people living \nby our social systems, not contributing to our society, dont care about us, \nblablablabla\" and then we had experts who examined and explored this \nphenomena and in the end they came to the conclusion that the moment the \nfirst big wave of immigrants arrived here in Germany they were \ndiscriminated and the Germans avoided them, didnt want to talk to them, \ndidnt want to help them, having thousands of prejudices (and some still \ngot) and so these people sticked together and founded their own societies \nand so we simply found out that \"we\" are the problem not them and since \nthen a lot has changed. What I just told you is something you already learn \nin 7th grade in Germany, we have thousand of programs for better \nintegration and we abolished tuitions to give everyone equal chances, \nbecause our ethos is \"work hard and you can make it!\" (but even here in \nEurope it is not a secret that the system isnt perfect either and that \nwealthier kids still got way higher chances to become successful).. \n\nSo you have to ask yourself how your \"black\" community got there in the \nfirst place, which obstacles they have to meet probably everyday in their \nlife and then if it isnt understandable that after all these decades or \neven centuries they are just tired and just know \"becoming a pimp or a drug \ndealer is the only way to become something in this country, because all the \nother doors are closed for a person like me\" (principles of evolution and \nnatural selection: Every life form searches his space where he can survive).\n\nIntegration and Discrimination are selffullfilling prophecies. You point at \nsomeone and tell the others \"look! He is bad, lazy and a criminal!\" and \nthis person will encounter a lot of obstacles in his life which will make \nit harder for him to be successful, maybe one of him will become president, \nthe other a rapper, the other one an athlete and one a CEO, but the vast \nmajority wont make it because of these sick obstacles and they will fail \nand in the end they will have to live by the welfare system and/or becoming \ncriminal and you will stand there again, pointing at them saying \"told'ya!\".\n\nIn Germany the most racist people are the ones living in the poorest parts. \nThe \"native\" Germans blame the other nationalities for their misery and the \nGermans with another national background blame the \"natives\" and through \nthis hatred towards each other this shit goes on and on and on.

Europeans I meet abroad are usually unaware of this, and tend to \nmake arrogant and ignorant remarks not dissimilar to yours. \n\nSecondly, it's usually only white people who never lived in multiracial \ncommunities that blame crime on poverty.

I agree with some of his \ncriticisms (some), but he doesn't verbalize them in a way that helps the \nsituation. At least not in the videos I've seen. I don't know you, but in \ntalking to you on  here you seem like an honest guy so I'll give you the \ntruth about the amount of blacks in the prison system. These are all facts \nyou can double check for yourself. It has alot to do with the war on drugs, \nbut the war was on before that. \nBefore 1964 the prison population was more equal to the countrys makeup. \nWhat happened in 1964? Before 1964 you had the Civil Rights Act \"Jim Crow\" \nlaws which prevented blacks from \"getting out of line\". A black man would \ngo fight for \"his country\", and come home with no legs to a \"Colored\" water \nfountain. Blacks were already kept in check by the laws, no need for heavy \npolice presence. Once they abolished those laws police presence in the \ncommunity skyrocketed, so did the beatings and attacks on black men. And \nthe incarceration rate went up right along with that. Imagine for a second \nyour outrage if some black cops beat some white kid to death in your \nMinnesota town and got off? And an all black judge and jury acquitted them. \nWould you call this \"justice\"? This is what blacks have faced in America \nsince she was born. Still do today. How many times you walked into a job \nand had to worry about whether or not you'd get a job because of your race? \n(Affirmative Action helps more white women than blacks by the way). lol, \nblacks aren't getting jobs above equally qualified whites because they're \nblack anywhere in America. You ever heard of that happening? I haven't. I \nhave honest white friends who can admit these things. There's no shame in \nadmitting that America has a race problem and that blacks have been treated \nunfairly .This was the black mans reality. This is not \"playing the race \ncard\". These are the facts. The attacks on black people sparked the birth \nof the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. (1966) (See the timeline of \nevents unfolding?) They had armed patrols, etc to stop the racist cops from \ncoming into our communities assaulting our people. Wouldn't whites do the \nsame if blacks were coming into their neighborhoods in police uniforms \nletting loose dogs on their mothers and children? I know countless older \nblacks with tales like these. The Panthers get a bad rap from people who \nknow nothing of them besides propaganda. This is already too long. I'm \nactually writing a book on race relations so I could go on all day. A \nbeautiful black woman named Michelle Alexander wrote a piece called \n\"Incarceration Nation\", its the hard truth about the \"War on Drugs\" and \ncrime in America.

Meaning, blacks are 12% \nof the population, they also used to be 12% of the prison population. At \nthe end of Jim Crow segregation that number jumped up into the 50's or 60's \nin 1-2 years. How did that happen? Did blacks all of a sudden become overly \ncriminal?  (Next post I'll give you all the sources and reading material \nyou need) I'll give it to you from white people too, so that you don't \nthink it's only blacks that say this. I want you to see these are facts, \nnot the opinion of some random black guy. As far as cities like Detroit, \netc. I have no doubt that the crime rate among blacks in those places is \nhigher than where you're at in Southern Minnesota. It's simple math. Less \nmoney in the neighborhood=more crime. This is why whites in Ireland and \nRussia in the \"ghettoes\" are tearing each other up and getting locked up at \na faster rate than whites from better communities in those countries. More \nmoney, more opportunity in your community=less crime. Blacks don't commit \ncrimes because they are genetically criminal or violent. There isn't a \nblack man living that hasn't had some door slammed in his face because of \nhis skin color. Watch ABC's show \"What would you do?\" about a black man and \na white man going to the same place for a job, with the same background. \nThen let me know if you think race isn't an issue.

I am only using information relate-able to a gun-controlled \npopulation. \n\nFrom what I understand, Australia has been increasing their status on \nGun-Control since 1997. The recent events of Sandy Hook Elementary School \nseem to have prompted even more strict gun-control, according to Rebecca \nPeters, Journalist of The Guardian. I will use the date you have provided, \n1996. Australia has seen a situation similar to that of Britain in the \nsense that, heavy regulation/ban on the majority of firearms and the \nconfiscation of said firearms have resulted in an ever diminishing \ngun-death toll. Though this is true, the homicide rate has risen. The \namount of Citizens being killed with knives has risen as the gun-death toll \nhas fallen. I am less familiar with the situation in Australia, but \nBritain's overall violent crime rate has tripled since their gun ban. And \nlike I said previously, their gun-death toll has also been decreasing. \nRemoving the guns does not make a Criminal less threatening. I know this is \nnot your case, I am simply stating.\n\nOn the same date as the shooting at Sandy Hook, a madman stabbed 23 \nelementary students in China. They do not need guns to commit mass-murder \nand guns are certainly not easier to commit mass-murder than improvised \nexplosive devices.\n\nAs far as gun-ownership in America, there are over 100 million Americans \nowning hundreds of millions of firearms. If the average gun-owning American \nowns 5 firearms.. I know of no one personally who owns only 1 firearm and \nthe majority of those I know easily own 5+. I own 3 myself and I am only \n23, recently discharged from the Marine Corps. I find it very unfortunate \nthat we find ourselves with thousands of miles of physical contact with \nMexico, and even Canada as the Criminals will import from there if ever \nnecessary. We are subject to hundreds of miles of underground tunnels \nleading into our Country because of our close-physical state. The guns \ncannot be removed from my Country. Where the Criminals demand them, the \nsupply will come from outside of the Country.\n\nOur entire Nation will be run like the city of Chicago in which firearms \nare imported as often as The Criminals need them, despite the strict laws \nmaking them illegal in Chicago.\n\nI know the case you are making is one against my misinformation. I do not \nintend to mislead.",

But by toda's standards Charles Manson would be considered  a \nrun of the mill criminal. It is violence and disregard for life that is \nexploding in the world and violence will use any tool handy. To believe \nthat reducing access to a particular tool will make it all better is short \nsighted. The whole picture is not being viewed. Reduce violence and the \ntools being used won't matter. We humans are very adaptive. violence will \nfind a way no matter the limitation of choice. ",

The guy try to cite the UCRs which of course \nare national averages.  When you get down to local stats of course you find \nthat that the number don't support policy.  I'm talking about drug use here \nbut the idea is that UCR's are a mile high view of things and the FBI know \nthat which is why they caution people about how UCR's should be used. \n People like O'Reilly and others need to believe the headline to keep their \nprejudices' justified so don't have to deal with reality.\n\nAlso, the point about Trayvon being armed is another great one many people \nhad made.  He was a kid so he would not have be able to be armed but simple \nput what if the fought back an won- grabbed the gun and shot and killed \nZimmerman.  Maybe just even pistol whipped him.  I'm pretty sure he would \nhave gotten convicted of something.  I know people that that has happened \ntoo.\n\nBack to the original point though, we have laws that allow citizens to \nprotect themselves and if stats came out that more Blacks and Latinos were \nlegally carrying then in area's that have more systemic ethnic \ndiscrimination there would be a hesitation by prejudiced people to commit \ncrimes against people who would fight back.",

It is perfectly legal to walk in your neighborhood, be nosey, \nor even follow someone. It may make you uncomfortable, if in your mind you \nthink they are a creepy ass cracker, but it is still not illegal. Walking \nup on Zimmerman to talk or ask questions is also not illegal. When Trayvon \nphysically attacked, it then became illegal. Zimmerman at that point could \nfight back. When Trayvon then started banging his head on the concrete and \nthreatened to kill him, That became deadly force which gave Zimmerman the \nright to defend himself with deadly force. It really doesn't matter what \neither one was thinking until it became physical. I think this has been \nmostly supported by the courts in this case.\n\nI actually feel sorry for Trayvon and his family. I feel sorry that Trayvon \nhad learned that violence is the best first option. I feel sorry that he \nescalated it to that point. If only he had kept on his path and went home. \nIf only Zimmerman had not been so suspicious. But that's the world we live \nin now and situations come up like this all too often.\n\nPeople should know the laws especially if they are carrying concealed. \nStart them out young. Kids need to be informed of their rights with others \nand LE. All people need to know what constitutes legal and illegal \nbehavior. Knowledge is power. Too many people today think power is power. \nWhen a situation like this comes up, it is often up to the courts to sort \nit out.
