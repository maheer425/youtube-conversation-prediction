                "text": "Gaps between primes. The Numberphile guys (Ed Copeland and Tony Padilla \nfrom the University of Nottingham) chat about the recent proof that there's \nan infinite number of pairs of primes separated by 70 million. They seem \nsurprised that the man who discovered the proof was from the University of \nNew Hampshire and not an \"elite\" university like Princeton or Harvard. No, \nthey don't explain how the proof works (it's 56 pages), instead they talk \nabout how difficult it would be for large prime numbers to date. That will \nstick in your head. Anyway, he didn't make the breakthrough by inventing \nany phenomenally new math -- rather he basically just plugged and chugged \nusing established techniques longer than anyone else. It might lead to a \nproof of the hundreds of years old twin primes conjecture.\ufeff",

For instance, for n = 7: 5042, \n5043, 5044, 5045, 5046, and 5047 are not prime. This is because 7! = 7 * 6 \n* 5 * 4 * 3 * 2, so 7! + 2 = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 + 1) * 2, 7! + 3 = (7 * 6 * \n5 * 4 * 2 + 1) * 3, and so on.\n\nHence, for n = 10,000,000, there must be a sequence of consecutive \nnon-primes that is 9,999,999 numbers long (specifically, from 10,000,000! + \n2 to 10,000,000! + 10,000,000).
