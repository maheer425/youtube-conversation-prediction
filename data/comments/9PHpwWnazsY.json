Allah is His \nname in the same way that God is.  I like how Allah sounds but I refer to \nHim as God since I live in the west and intend to clarify for those who \nmisuse it.  Such as the Christians who claim to submit to God alone while \nthey secretly refer to Isa and the trinity.\n\nBe careful claiming that Allah has 99 attributes when the Quran doesn't \nlist 99, nor does it refer to them as attributes.  The Most Merciful, Most \nForgiving are names of God just like Allah, Lord of the Worlds.",

God \ncan be changed to many things- backwards it can be read as 'dog' and you \ncan even add a -dess to it to make it a feminine God. Whereas the name \n\"Allah\" has so much respect and cannot be changed to infer a different \nmeaning. In fact, it is so amazing that it carries all His 99 attributes \n(ie. All Merciful, Most Forgiving) and more in this one name alone. That's \nhow amazing it is! There's nothing wrong with saying 'God' though, but \n'Allah' is much better :)",

Your *Woman as well are not as well known* \nparagraph is stereotyping, not giving respect. Respect is giving people \nopportunity to reach beyond assumed roles.\n\nAlso, I find it frustrating that when I ask you questions you find it \nnecessary to tell me what the Qur'an says or that Muhammad was illiterate, \nsomething common knowledge to Muslims.

And it never \nchanged. \n\nAs far as i know when u are talking about an unknown person they are always \nmentioned as he until their gender is specified. God has no gender, but \ncalling Him as it like u mention a thing would be disrespect and respect is \none of the most important things Islam teaches us because with respect \ncivilizations are built. With respect people work with each other best. \nWith respect knowledge has been taught at that is why schools in which \nteachers are forced to respect tge students and the teachers are not \nallowed to insult or beat up the students u find the students are more \nlikely to enjoy the subject. Even if a teacher does not insult or beat the \nstudents but he doesnt treat them as students who are ready to learn you \nwill find the students hating the subject.\n\nIts true what u say about the women. And that is how her respect was \nbasically earned in the past and that is what we tell a person who sees a \nwoman as second class. A very famous incident that happened in the prophet \ntime was that a friend of his came AKA companion asked him \"who is the \nperson worth my company?\" The prophet told him ur mother. And then he asked \nagain after her and the prophet replied him again with ur mother. And the \ncomanion asked again who next and he got the same reply as his mother and \nwhen he asked the 4th time he was told his father.\n\nWoman as well are not well known to being tough leaders apart from a few \neasily counted. A woman is just not built that way. Usually when marriage \noccurs and 2 people fall in love it is because the lady will provide \ncomfort and happiness to the man and the man will provide comfort happiness \nand protection to his wif and the family. Because that is just how the \nwoman is built doeant mean she is any less than a man.

Why then would calling \nAllah an \"it\" be considered a strike against your religion?

                "text": "Oggi Festa della Madonna di Lourdes\n\nIn questa giornata carica di significato per i devoti di Maria, vorrei fare \nuna riflessione sul male pi\u00f9 grande che affligge l'uomo, che \u00e8 l'odio e \nnell'odio includo anche l'indifferenza per la sofferenza altrui.\nL'odio che fa morire l'uomo creato ad immagine e somiglianza di Dio e ne fa \nuna belva senza piet\u00e0 per il suo simile.\n\nVoglio condividere con voi un commento ad una mia risposta di un amico \nmusulmano su un post molto forte sulla guerra che sta distruggendo il suo \npopolo, ho provato a fare la traduzione in italiano sotto.\n\n\"Spreading awareness is important,  your children feeling loved by you \nwould be the best thing they ever had even while feeling hard times as \nhaving no job at all, Peace is possible if someone can speak a word of \ntruth against injustice at any situation no matter what it is whether it \nwould in a conversation, or in a action! Peace would be when someone can \nfeel completely at ease with their loved ones it could be at any situation \nas well, Peace is a reality of a word,  you either bring it to life, or \nbury it where the sun doesn't shine.\nAwareness is important helping a child with at least a word of good in \nanother country would make them grateful, bring a smile to their faces \nknowing they haven't been forgotten and the children would be praying for \nthat person which they didn't met but know there is still someone out there \nwho cares.\nCan you imagine the smile on a child face while his parentless, homeless, \nfrozen, and scared of the war his in? its Priceless.\n\"Help the people in need, for you will be doubled on the reward\"\nAwareness is what the world needs, my friend.....\nit will then follow with peace, a word brought to life!\ufeff\n(Deaem Bolle)\n\nDiffondere la consapevolezza \u00e8 importante , quando i tuoi figli si sentono \namati da te \u00e8 la cosa migliore che possano avere , anche  se il momento \u00e8 \nduro per la mancanza di lavoro; la pace \u00e8 possibile ogni volta che qualcuno \npu\u00f2 dire una parola di verit\u00e0 contro l'ingiustizia in qualsiasi situazione, \nnon importa se in una conversazione, o con un'azione ! La pace \u00e8 possibile \nogni volta che qualcuno pu\u00f2 sentirsi completamente a proprio agio con i \npropri cari in qualsiasi situazione; la pace \u00e8 la realt\u00e0 di una parola, sia \nche tu la faccia vivere, o che tu la  seppellisca dove il sole non splende .\nLa consapevolezza \u00e8 importante, aiutare i bambini con almeno una parola di \nbene in un altro paese li rende grati, porta un sorriso sui loro volti \nsapendo che non sono stati dimenticati e i bambini pregheranno per quella \npersona che non hanno mai incontrato ma \u00e8 importante per loro sapere che \nc'\u00e8 ancora qualcuno l\u00e0 fuori che si preoccupa per loro.\nPotete immaginare il valore di un sorriso sul volto di un bambino senza \ngenitori, senza casa, congelato, e spaventanto dalla guerrache sta vivendo? \n\u00e8 inestimabile!\n\" Quando aiuti le persone bisognose , il tuo premio sar\u00e0 raddoppiato \"\nLa consapevolezza \u00e8 ci\u00f2 di cui il mondo ha bisogno , cara amica.....\npoi seguir\u00e0  la pace, una parola portata nella vita !\n\nScusate per la traduzione veloce e liberamente tratta, spero si comprenda \nil contenuto, che sostanzialmente \u00e8 che per costruire la pace prima bisogna \ndiffondere la consapevolezza che ci\u00f2 che accade nel mondo ci riguarda tutti \nin prima persona, non si pu\u00f2 pensare di chiedere e lottare solo per il \nbenessere personale quando il mondo attorno a noi sta crollando, solo con \nla solidariet\u00e0 anche di una parola di conforto si pu\u00f2 costruire un mondo \nmigliore.\n\nho allegato un video molto forte nei contenuti, so che non \u00e8 piacevole \nguardarlo perch\u00e8 spezza dentro, ne abbiamo visti tanti, ne continueremo a \nvedere, per\u00f2 almeno un pensiero di bene per tutte le persone che soffrono a \ncausa della guerra cerchiamo di farlo, non costa niente. Ricordiamoci che \nla pace e la giustizia sociale sono un bene che va costruito giorno per \ngiorno e per il quale bisogna lottare senza stancarsi, e se lasciamo che \nl'indifferenza prenda il sopravvento i risultati sono quelli che si vedono \nnel video, nessuno \u00e8 esonerato dal pensare che la guerra sia una realt\u00e0 che \nnon ci tocca, ogni uomo vittima di un'ingiustizia sociale vive la sua \nguerra personale ogni giorno anche in tempo di pace...\ufeff",

With money, our time, raising awareness and the \nlike. Or simply a bid to those fighting to stop. I see comments calling for \n\"jihad\" and I question why are you proposing more war? Not only that but \ngiving a false meaning to the word Jihad which quite literally means \nstruggle. The people in Syria are merely an example of the chaos our world \nhas fallen into. There are children in all parts of the world suffering and \nit is our duty as human beings to help them in any way be it money, time, \nor simple prayer/kind words and messages.

Dr. Dan Brukbaker, Rice \nUniversity doctoral candidate, examined all 10 early copies: *This \ndissertation examines intentional changes in ten early Qur'ans and a group \nof early Qur'an fragments. With some exceptions, scholars of the Qur'an\u2019s \nhistory have given priority to Muslim traditional accounts of its early \ntransmission and establishment. These sources acknowledge a certain degree \nof flexibility in the text. Manuscripts have been accepted as proof of \nearly origin but generally treated as a secondary witness to that origin. \nDivergence from today\u2019s standard has been variously credited to flexibility \nof readings, developing orthography of the Arabic language, downplayed as \nowing to inferior copies, or considered unimportant because secondary to a \nuniversally acknowledged and known oral tradition preserved in the hearts \nof the believers. However, the earliest Muslim historical traditions \nconcerning Islam and Qur'anic origins were not first written until the \nsecond half of the 8th century AD. I therefore methodologically assert \npriority of the manuscripts, the earliest extant dating to the latter years \nof the 7th century AD, as witness to the written Qur'an\u2019s early history. \nThe manuscripts, I find, indicate that the text of the Qur'an was not \nimmediately established in every detail, nor was oral tradition strong \nenough or unanimous enough to prevent written variants in the form of \nalternate spellings, alternate words or phrases, omissions, or inclusions \nthat precipitated later revisions or standardization of the pages \nthemselves but that in some cases remain.*",

You have too many poetic videos bro and some of the examples \nare TOO horrific for some sensitive people. What I'm trying to say is \nyou're mainstream Islam, if you dig deeper you'll know. But that's only if \nyou dig deeper...\ufeff basically have to try to practice the Quran not just \ntalk about it. Because here you're rapping and in ALL honesty rap is haram. \nSo we need to find balance, to become the better Muslim, especially if we \nmake ourself a preacher to public eye.\ufeff what I'm saying this video isn't \nenough, if we want to touch the community, the true example would be from \nQuran, that's here to guide us.\ufeff\n\n\"Do not be discouraged.\" -The Holy Quran, from Allah's eyes he wants us to \nleave music, this is hard for me as I'm new to Islam basically, but I just \nwant people to be more aware that being melodramatic, hypocrite, or arguing \ncan be wrong. It is wrong in fact.\ufeff",

It's funny \nto say that because last time i checked all the porn goes on in America. \nLike what you're basically saying is that everyone follows the US \nconstitution not because they acknowledge that its rules are correct and \nshould be followed for the better for ALL of society but because it'll \n\"control\" them from being some kind of insane rebellious anarchists because \n\"all\" Americans are anarchists inside... Like i shouldn't explain this to \nyou, you should already see how stupid you sound here. And please, for \ncrying out loud, don't give me that \"oh how about becoming a doctor\" cuz \nfirst of all, you Americans start 90% of the wars for imperial and economic \ninterests and target one of our leaders for scapegoats and then wonder why \nthere are terrorists and not doctors in the Middle East. Well what else can \nthey be if they grow up having drones being thrown on them 24/7. And even \nwhen you do become doctors, do you actually do it to help people or is it \nfor the money, cuz you make the insurance so damn high that people who \nactually need medical aid including the millions in 3rd world countries \ncan't even afford it, and then you drive home in your nice benz and \nporsches claiming you've \"helped\" someone, give me a break. Like you just \nso like assuming that your culture is the best because you've invested in \nscience, when you don't even realize that you all only get the \"privilege\" \nto advance in science because all your resources come from pretty much \n\"using\" and \"backstabbing\" every other country, that's why those countries \nare in a shithole. Not because we practice our religion but because you \nguys have to butt in whenever we have something you don't and then you \nsugarcoat it by saying \"oh they're terrorists, oh we're spreading democracy \nor oh we're containing communism\". There were no terrorists before those \n\"supposedly war on terrors\" in the Middle East nor any \"oppression\" and the \ncountries were still Islamic. In fact Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma don't \nhave any of that turmoil and they're majority Muslims so where's the \nnegative religious factor? Like enough with the mockery of Islam, instead \nwhy don't you actually go out of your spoonfed and breastfed internet \ncomfort zone and actually travel to another country and first-hand witness \nwhat America REALLY does instead of mocking a religion which you know \nnothing about just because you're so uptight about freedom. And we don't \nEVER give up on life, needing freedom for stupid things like sexual \nliberation just because you guys think its healthy to be \"hormonal\" and \ntreat each other like sex toys is called giving up, we don't give a damn \nabout our sexual needs or desires, all we care about is living this life \nthe right way, probably more than you ever will, by things like living \nsmall, being modest, looking up for each other and etc. However some of us \ngive up in a sense of resorting to violence because they have no choice but \nto since they're just so pushed down to such a hell state. And yes you \nmight have some self-control but there are several others who don't, that's \nwhy we follow rules. I might not need rules but if i don't follow them it \ngives an excuse for weak people who DO need to follow them to not comply \neither and then all hell breaks loose and then that's when you have the \nnorm gradually changing for the worst. In the 50s women were modest, in 80s \nless and even less in 90s and now its to a point where we have almost half \nthe girls breaking their virginity in freshman year, where do you think its \nheaded? And this all happened because somewhere down the line someone had \nthe genius brain to give \"some\" freedom during those feminist movements. We \ndon't have rules so it can burden the strong but so it can prevent the weak \nfrom breaking loose, influencing others and then throughout time, \neventually spreading into the majority like you see today. That's why Islam \nhas a strict dress code. Do i have to dumb this down for you any further or \nare you going to continue to assume that all Muslims are pornstars like an \nignorant reject? And lastly, don't EVER mistake freedom for education. \nYou're mistaking the freedom to be able to expose yourself in anyway with \nfreedom of being able to educate yourself, both are different. Our women \nwear a veil but that sure of a hell doesn't mean they don't go to college. \nAnd speaking of education, let me educate you. Not more than 5 centuries \nback, the Islamic (mostly Ottoman and Mogul) empire was the leading \nauthority in education, everyone came to us to learn, while you guys were \nbusy shitting all over the streets in your \"dark ages\" (this is fact, you \ncan find this any history book) How do you think the renaissance started? \nYou guys came to us during the crusades and saw all the Greek and Roman \nhistory and artifacts we've preserved and then brought it back with you. \nYou only think you were ALWAYS on top because you grew up learning \ndemocracy this and democracy that and nothing else, well guess what, the \nworld doesn't revolve around Europe or the west. Now its only the exact \nopposite through years of colonization, dividing and conquering and etc. to \na point where the Muslim empire is cracked up into several confused \ndeveloping nations that have no real direction or say in this world anymore \nbut to quarrel with themselves because of their puppet governments that you \nguys control. There's more to education than what you're told to learn \nbuddy. It's not just learning about democracy, the renaissance or \nevolution, please realize that and stop this Western ignorance of \"oh we're \nbetter because we're more technologically advanced\". You can map all the \ngalaxies and discover all the species in the ocean, but if you do it by \nleaving millions to starve and die in another country while the youth waste \ntheir time getting drunk and partying every week along with shunning their \nparents in your own country, then all those scientific achievements mean \nabsolutely nothing.",
