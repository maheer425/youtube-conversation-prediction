If someone self identifies as a psychopath I do \nquestion the validity of this claim as it is likely self diagnosed.  \n\nSo far as I've studied the main reason the term is generally used in \neducation (not clinical use) is to highlight the distinction in concepts \nbetween \"born that way\" (psycopathy) and \"conditioned that way\" \n(sociopathy).",

And to \ncorrect Crossark (no offense), but not all sadists are serial killers, nor \nare plenty of people on the ASPD spectrum with sadistic tendencies or \nsadistic sexuality (I'm stating these as separate things because they often \nare) non-consensual and/or serial killers or even abusers. That would be \nlabeling people with ASPD with sadistic tendencies to be incapable of the \nability to thrive/cope in generalized society in the sense of respecting \nboundaries due to inevitable repercussions, which is a rude assumption. \nSadly it's assumption a lot of people make because of a greater portion of \nthose studied with ASPD, because a large part of the populace with ASPD \nchoose to not step forward and speak up about it due to stigma/etc.\n\nLike I said, not attempting to rub anyone the wrong way, nor am i looking \nfor internet drama (which is annoying). But talking about ASPD (or any \nother term any other region or social structure may use for it) like it is \nblack and white is ignorant of the fact that it's a) a spectrum disorder \nand b) plenty of people with it learn to live quite comfortably without \nhaving to go to grandiose extremes.\n\nNot responding back past this point.

No. People with certain personalities disorders \n(those exhibiting psychotic symptoms aside) know exactly what they're \ndoing, even if they know it's wrong and \"wish they could stop\". That's why \nthey can be incarcerated for their actions and are legally fit to stand \ntrial.\n\nI dated a guy with BPD, who knew he had a problem (and had self-diagnosed), \nbut hadn't sought treatment. He mostly certainly would fit the diagnosis. \nObsessed with achieving success, with being perfect, was incredibly jealous \nthat I had dated people before him and that I had been in love before, made \nme feel so awful about it, twisted everything to make it seem like it was \nmy fault... would flip his shit if he felt like he was being slighted in \nany way... it was absolutely awful and truly abusive. I think he hated \nhimself for it, though. After an outburst, he would talk to me about it and \nsay that he KNOWS that he's overreacting, but can't help that those are the \nemotions he feels in those circumstances.

Do I have sympathy for the fact that he \nfinds it so hard to relate normally to people and that he had an awful \nupbringing that likely lead to his personality disorder? Of course. But at \nthe end of the day, he is the one who was emotionally abusive, and is \nresponsible for his actions. I hope he gets the help that he needs.

I felt no anger or hostility toward the driver for \nnearly killing a relative nor for killing my dog. & I didn't feel sadness \nor distress for the death of my dog. What I did feel was annoyance at the \nidea of having to clean up the mess, as I didn't feel like spending the \nafternoon scraping up roadkill & digging a hole to bury it.\n\nHowever, the rest of the family was predictably emotional, so when I \nfeigned being very distressed at the whole affair they naturally believed \nme; & the task was passed to another, leaving me free to enjoy the \nafternoon as I saw fit. I didn't give my dog a second thought.\n\n I used duplicity & manipulation of people's emotional state to achieve a \ndesired end result, & I am fully responsible for those actions, as I knew \nexactly what I was doing when I was doing it.\n\nHowever, I am not responsible for not feeling the emotions that a *\"normal \nperson\"* feels under those circumstances. Asking someone like me to feel \nthose things, is like asking a blind person to sort your crayons according \nto color. Simply put, it is an absurdly stupid action.\n\nAs to the whole *\"mental illness is awful\"* number, I would say it depends \nupon the person. Personally I rather like being the way I am, I am \nunencumbered by a great many things that seem to bother most of the people \naround me. The most taxing thing for me is when I need to *\"play normal\"* \nfor the sake of certain interpersonal interactions.       ",

                    "text": "I believe my mother has BPD. She always thinks she's the victim, and \neveryone else is either bad, evil, and cruel, or the best person in the \nworld (black and white thinking), and she truly believes everything bad and \nterrible in her life is somehow someone else's fault and never hers. She \nalso never apologises, and the times when she has to, she *never* means it; \nshe makes one feel as though she's placating you and one is forcing her to \napologise against her will and proving true her thoughts about one being a \ncruel, unforgiving, and ungrateful person.\n\nEveryone she knows (she hardly has any friends and she isn't very close to \nher family) believes she's the best and most loving and caring mother there \nis, and so many people, from family members to school teachers have told me \nthat I am very lucky to have her and that I should take care of her (she \nusually remembers only that part).\n\nShe can be quite charming, and one of her biggest obsessions is her image \nand what others know of her. She always makes sure that others think she is \nnothing but happy and that she has not a problem in her life, even though \nthat's far from reality, because she believes being honest about her \nshortcomings will make her seem weak and vulnerable and give others who \nhate her a reason to be happy - no one hates her, though; she's the one \nhating people she doesn't like for no reason and any reason, and she's the \none who takes such joy at the misfortune of her 'enemies'. She always \ndenies that, but you can tell that's not true when she's suddenly happy, \nactive, and in such a good mood.\n\nShe also lies quite a lot effortlessly. Even when she's aware that you've \nfound out that she's been lying and making up stories and excuses to get \nwhat she wanted at the time, whether it's perpetual passive quiet and peace \nor your own money, you can't outright say to her that she lied or even \nimply it, because she'll play the victim again whom no one believes or \nwants to trust, and she'll make sure to let you know exactly how bad and \ndisappointing a person and a child you are and have always been to her all \nalong, and that it's typical of you.\n\nShe becomes absolutely crazy and hysterical when you try to explain \nsomething wasn't your fault or inadvertently make her feel sort of \nincompetent or at fault.\n\nShe always thinks she is an incompetent person and mother and a failure, \nand she will tell you that she is that for no reason and at no provocation \nwhatsoever as though she's trying to guilt you into doing something she \nwants (many times she won't tell you what that is, because she simply hates \nyour very existence in her life) and tell you she knows that you think of \nher as an incompetent person, and she'll probably go on for another hour \nfeigning weakness and apologising as if she's capitulating and agreeing \nwith your imagined cruel and inconsiderate remarks about her, even when \nnone of that is remotely true or justifiable and there's no reason for her \nto believe that - it's like she's constantly looking to set you off and \nhave a never-ending argument with you so she can blame you for *everything* \nand anything and ask whoever else is around to save her from the evil \nperson that you are who's always fighting with her.\n\nShe's also very insecure, and the thought of others abandoning her can make \nher turn into a very obnoxious, bitter, defensive, and unsupportive person \n(even and especially to me, her only son).\n\nShe also believes she always knows best and knows what's best for her \nchildren, which makes her very controlling, patronising, and dismissive in \nsuch an obnoxious way, and makes her think she has the right to make \ndecisions for you and to make sure you're not always available to other \npeople or in very close relationships\u2014intimate or otherwise\u2014with anyone, \nwhich I think only shows how insecure and immature she is and that she \nreally has no respect for anyone and isn't comfortable with those close to \nher becoming independent and not making her always feel important and \nneeded, as she likes; she considers every step one takes into autonomy and \nself-dependence to be a solid statement about how she's incompetent and \nthat you don't want her in your life, which is ridiculous and makes \nmaintaining the relationship while going about one's life and other \nimportant things like work and studies even more difficult and absolutely \ntiresome.\n\nShe can be extremely abusive and hurtful verbally and carelessly say the \nworst and most hurtful things a mother could possibly utter, and the things \nthey say are usually well-thought-out and too relevant and germane to be \nrandom, and they often offer explanations for how she had been treating \nyou. She usually says these stuff with a strange, sort of evil smile on her \nface, which makes her seem like nothing short of a sadistic narcissist. Try \nto imagine how distressing and confusing having one's mother pray before \none's eyes for one's death and curse the day that you were born at an age \nas young as 9, like she's purely and utterly evil and never was your mother \nfor a day. There were times when I seriously doubted I was her son, even \nthough many people said I look like her. When you bring up what she said to \nyou and told you the night before, first, she will act all upset and \ndisappointed as though you're trying to spoil her good mood and fight with \nher on that fine morning, then, she will blame it all on you and claim you \nwere the one who made her angry, which, in her mind, somehow justifies the \ncruel things she said to you and wished upon you and will most likely say \nto you again at anothe time. One thing you can be sure she won't do is to \nsincerely apologise to you and show you any remorse. No, she'll either try \nsuch stupid and immature things as tickling you with a playful smile on so \nas to try to make you laugh and prove that you're not really mad or \nanything, or she will act like a victim, say sorry, and look to you as if \nyou are cruel and forcing her to do things against her will.\n\nShe also threatens to kill herself quite often, sometimes with using \nwhatever inflammable liquid close by and a light, and a few times she's \ntorn off her shirts in her tantrums when she was under pressure and being \nconfronted into an uncomfortable situation where she is, indeed, the one at \nfault and she couldn't escape or come up with an excuse and had to admit \nshe, indeed, was mistaken or that she had been lying and that it wasn't my \nfault. That's her last resort. She may also get dressed in hours and leave \nhome for an hour and return claiming she'd nearly been run over by a car or \na bus or that she fell over on her face in the middle of the street and \npeople helped her up. Only her clothes never looked dirty or creased when \nshe returned any of those times and there were no bruises on her face.\n\nShe believes no one understands her, loves her, or cares genuinely about \nher. She also feels very entitled to your time and attention and entitled \nto have money and everything \"other people have and enjoy,\" even though \nshe's unemployed and has never worked for more than a year in her life and \nhas of her own will given up two jobs, both very respectable and at \ngovernment institutions. Both times she felt her older and more experienced \nco-workers were jealous of her (she was dandy and stylish at the time) and \ncould somehow harm her in a way or turn others against her, but I suspect \nthat's her being paranoid.\nBeing jobless while other women she sees (and envies and detests) are \nconfident, independent, and successful in their lives is another reason \nshe's convinced she's incompetent and that people, even her family and \nchildren, hate her and don't respect her.\nShe whines and complains all the time, and she's an expert at feigning \nweakness of any and all sorts. She's quite a burden.\n\nOne of my sisters has OCD and bipolar and dependent personality disorders \nand the other\u2014the eldest one\u2014is narcissistic. The eldest has always been \nher favourite child, the Good Child or the Hero. My eldest sister has \nalways acted as her hand, brain, and tongue. She has been physically and \nverbally abusive to her only brother and I've always found her quite \nintimidating, unpredictable, and sometimes utterly cruel and sadistic, and \nmy mother, being a naturally timid person, found in her aggressive and \nassertive daughter her missing half which she was right to feel made her \ninvincible and complete.\n\nUnfortunately, I've seen my sister do the same unapologetically to my \n4-year-old nephew and 10-months-old niece, her children. She thinks her \nlittle children, especially my sweet and amazing nephew, should know right \nfrom wrong and should only do as she orders them and not embarrass her in \nfront of her family or strangers.\n\nShe also believes that good children never do what \"they know\" will upset \ntheir mother, such as jumping and running around in the apartment where \nthey're forced to live (this and the following is especially true for my \nnephew), crying (weeping), shouting, interrupting while the adults are \ntalking, demanding that they get that expensive toy while at the store, \nasking for food and then leaving it intact, and even farting. She believes \nif children behave \"badly,\" it isn't the mother's fault but their own, and \nbeating and screaming at them, taking away their toys, and leaving them all \nalone at home will teach them a lesson that they need to learn.\n\nI've been through everything my nephew has faced so far and the things he \nwill certainly face when I leave the country. I've told my mother about \nthis, and that I think this is her fault because she encouraged that \nbehaviour in her daughter from the very beginning when she didn't have the \npatience or ability to get hold of me as a kid, and I've had to fight with \nmy sister when she came to visit a couple months ago and be the one to \nspeak about it while my other sister and mother scream at me in anger \nrather than help me, and that was only out of my concern for the future of \nmy young nephew and niece.\n\nI can't depend on my mother or my sister because they fear her, and I \nbelieve my sister was shocked and felt almost too intimidated to find that \nI was no longer afraid of her and was willing and able to stand up to her, \nafter so many years of crying as a helpless little child and of being \nslapped, beaten, dragged, burned with matches, and forcibly fed chilli \npepper all before my mother.\n\nWhen I let her know for the first time that I remember exactly what she did \nand how she treated me as a child, she simply said I deserved it because I \nwould cry and ask for toys that were too expensive and embarrass them at \nstores, or run and play around in the apartment with a soccer ball, disturb \nour neighbour, and cause them trouble\u2014but we were talking about a type-1 \ndiabetic child who has been to amusement parks only three times in his life \nand has never played any sports, joined any sports clubs like all of his \nfriends, or been able/good enough to play soccer or learn to swim or play a \nmusical instrument at his schools in Cairo. She said my trying to play in \nthe apartment was wrong and unjustified, and that I was not entitled to *any \none* of those things which I said is the least a child like my nephew \ndeserves.\n\nI believe my borderline mother is also somewhat passive-aggressive. My \nabsentee father is passive-aggressive. She hasn't been diagnosed or been to \na psychiatrist, unlike my bipolar sister with OCD. When I tell her that she \nhas BPD (and after I explain what that is), she takes it as an insult. I've \nfound that there's no point in discussing this with her (or with my bipolar \nsister), anyway.\n\nI have a life of my own to start and live, and I want it to be as normal \nand healthy as possible, and it's going to be away from my mother and, \nregrettably, from my dear nephew and niece, whom I'm going to miss. I'm a \nnon-believing Muslim-born Egyptian who's renounced the one and only \nreligion of peace, and I'm going to Australia (by plane, not by boat) to \nseek asylum there by the end of this year. Won't be able to return even if \nI wanted to, and I will be going to college in the US and I will be busy \nworking and saving so that I may take the LSAT and go to law school after \ngraduation. I will pay my father every penny he's worked to give me since \nI've turned 18, and I'm very thankful to him for his help.\n\nWhen I get harassed, intimidated, and threatened on the phone by the police \nand the government monitors my Facebook and Twitter accounts and stores \neverything I've written despite my having deleted it, I do have no option \nbut to flee, and the least thing I should expect from my mother is to \nsupport me morally and not hold me back, make me feel guilty and pressure \nme into staying with her. She knows it is serious and I could end up in \nprison at this point and find myself alongside terrorists and murderers and \ngetting raped for no crime. She says it's only out of concern for what may \nhappen to me, but I think there's more to it and that she's more selfish \nand more unwilling to 'sacrifice' anything than I am.",

What you seem to emphasize is a consequentialist morality. \n Regardless of whether you had legitimate evil intentions to kill someone, \nyou still killed them, and should be punished accordingly.  I find some \nissue with this, for, often times, consequences are driven by external \nfactors--not purely human choice.  Take this example: imagine two identical \nsituations in which a person goes to the bar, gets drunk, and decides to \ndrive home.  In the first situation, they get home without harming \nthemselves or anybody else.  However, in the second scenario, a child just \nhappens to be crossing the road as the person speeds past.  They end up \nkilling the child.  Both drunk drivers made the same choice(with similarly \nblurred judgement).  The circumstances of their environment determined the \nconsequences of those choices.  Should the second driver be punished *more* \nfor something they couldn't control?\n\nDrawing a connection to the question at hand, should a person with a fully \nclear mind who decides to murder someone and a person with a delusion \nconvincing them that they need to kill someone who kills someone be treated \nand punished the same?  It might not absolve the person with a mental \ndisability of *all* of their responsibility/agency, but it seems like those \nare two very different situations.",

It is possible for some people \nto get misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all for a personality disorder. \nPeople who have BPD are actually one of those groups who are under \ndiagnosed. When someone who has BPD acts as the \"victim\" as you so phrased \nit there are many times they are not even aware of their behavior and how \nit can be ineffective. I'm studying DBT and physcology right now hoping to \nwork specifically with BPD patients. There is still a lot of research that \nhas to happen on the disorder. There is also a lot of stigma surrounding it \nand misinformation. Marsha Linehan is actually one of the leading people \nmaking break throughs with BPD. She developed DBT which is the therapy most \nproven to help BPD patients. There are also studies they have done on \nbrains of people who suffer from BPD they are learning that their brains \nare not functioning like a healthy brain. There are some parts that can be \nover active or under. They are also finding out that they may not have the \n\"brakes\" so to speak in the pre frontal cortex that stops the negative or \nimpulsive thoughts which could attribute to impulsive behavior and angry \noutburst. They still have a mental illness and it is just as serious as a \nphysical illness such as cancer. Marsha Linehan describes their emotional \nsensitivity as if they have no emotional skin. If you touch a burn patient \nwith no skin they will jump at the lightest of touches compared to someone \nwho has skin. It's a hard illness to see people struggle through. The \nmajority of people I have gotten to work with who have BPD were aware there \nwas something wrong or not quite right with them. Receiving the diagnosis \nof BPD came as a great relief to them. There is the other side to that as \nwell because of the stigma that surrounds it still there were some who were \nin denial about it because of the inaccurate information or hate sites you \nfind online. People who suffer from BPD tend to be more empathetic. There \nare expectations to every rule and the vast majority feel regret if they \nhurt someone and with the right treatment they become very skillful living \nnormal lives and are able to manage their intense feelings. Men are very \nunder diagnosed and women go undiagnosed as well not to the same extent but \nthey do. There is still not enough awareness and knowledge out there to \nhelp people who suffer from BPD get the treatment they need. If you ever \ncare to see what it's like living with BPD Marsha Linehan helped with a \ndocumentary it's on YouTube it's called \"Back from the Edge.\" It is very \nsad because those who suffer from BPD are at a greater risk of committing \nsuicide.

The way a woman with BPD acts is well known and usually \nrecognized after some time for observation. The pattern a male uses is a \nbit different and in some ways more subtle, and thus it often gets \nmisdiagnosed as something else down the line, often ASPD but sometimes \nother cluster B personality disorders (both Narcissistic and Histrionic). \n\nAs for why women get diagnosed with ASPD less, this actually may have a \ngenetic root to it--a long, complex discussion to have, but I'll summarize \nit up with just saying that men are more genetically predisposed to this \ndisorder than women, though women can show this trait as well. As with BPD, \nwomen sometimes show different traits than men, which makes it harder to \ndiagnose and recognize. Men tend to be more aggressive and thus more likely \nto act out with violence, and violent history is often a contributing \nfactor to diagnosis. People with ASPD however, are not necessarily violent, \nas is the case with a lot of women with ASPD--they may have no empathy or \nregard for others and little ability to follow social norms, but they don't \ngo out of their way to hurt people. Also, someone with ASPD get incorrectly \ndiagnosed with BPD.\n\nPersonality disorders are both fascinating and frustrating in learning \nabout them and trying to understand them--there is definitely still a great \ndeal of work to be done in getting better at recognizing and diagnosing \nthem, as well as understanding causes and origins, which helps contribute \nto treatment development.

Also, \nhere, if medication in general doesn't agree with you, you simply come off \nit, go on a pension, and then have a trusted friend or family member act as \nyour \"carer\" and restructure your life for you in a way that you can deal \nwith, using advice from your doctor. It's a lot better than how it is \nthere. That said, however, there are some practitioners here who do it more \nthe American way, especially when it comes to sticking whatever the latest \n\"trendy\" label is on as many people as they can as quickly as they \ncan...which is pretty disgraceful.\nBPD is a legit disorder but obnoxious bitches are obnoxious bitches and \nshould simply be recognised as such so you're totally right about that. \nSame goes for pompous fuckwits being told they have NPD or inconsiderate \nmongrels being told they have APD. Some people just need a few swift kicks \nto the head to take them down a few notches. [lol] Yeah, we avoidants \naren't always \"sweet\" either. (-_^)",

You don't owe the world perfection.\n\nAs long as you are honest about your condition when starting into a \nrelationship, it is very possible for you to have a long term stable \nrelationship. Your BPD will act up once in while and the occasional \nexplosion will happen, but as long you and your partner can put those \nexplosions into context, that is something that can be handled. \n\nEnough guys even enjoy a little bit of drama, especially when it comes to \nlong term relationships. They, long term relationships that is, suffer more \noften from too little excitement than too much of it. \n\nIt really boils down to whether or not you meet someone you fall in love \nwith, or for whome you have romantic feelings, or whatever you want to call \nit. If that is to happen, throw out of the window what Disney constructed \nas the relationship prototype and go for it.  \n\nIt also doesn't *have* to be long term. If a relationship for you means to \ngo on a rollercoaster for a month and then to close this ride behind you, \nthat is fine as well. \n\nMissing out on love and sex because you fear you ought to be a more stable \nperson to enjoy those things would a dire sacrifice to make. \n\nYour degree of self-reflection alone and the intelligence radiating from \nthat already show that some episodes of crazy are a worthy prize to pay to \nbe with you.

With today's knowledge base of psychology we can hold \nmental health professionals to new and great standards yet people do not do \nthis. The sheer number of misdiagnosis present on this video's comment \nsection is absolutely staggering. Also, prioritizing health care \nprofessionals who practice self knowledge over the instant gratification \nand side effect ridden treatment of drug use is insanely rare. Stressing \nthat one should find a quality therapist whose prime skill set includes \nlistening is absolutely not well known either. Maybe these ideas are well \nknown to YOU because you practice in the field but to most it's clearly \njust not internalized.

Furthermore, what you did say with the \nothers, while intelligent, was things these people already knew(that being \nseeing a therapist etc.) and so there was no point in being aggressive in \nthe first place. I'd like to state that I don't find aggressive behavior \nparticularly provoking but rather condescension tends to be my biggest \ntrigger when it comes to anger. If someone is doing something you see or \nassume is unreasonable and ineffective then aggressiveness is probably the \nworst thing you could do because it makes the person defensive about what \nthey are doing. See Rain's first response: \"Think before you speak. I know \nyou're trying to help, but you don't have to get your point across \naggressively.\" You made an assumption and basically insulted them for \nnothing. You could at least ask before you yell at them if what you think \nwhat their doing is whats actually happening. The reason I was aggressive \nto you was for two reasons: 1)The condescension really sets me off and 2)I \nfigured that there was no point in being nice to a person who believes \naggressiveness is the only way to get your point across. Finally, you'll \nnotice that again, the second you stop being an asshole is the second you \nget a somewhat more coherent argument out of people.",

So it is used for pleasure, a feeling of control, and \nas a maladaptive coping mechanism.\n\nThe first one is none of your business. If you don't like it and think it's \nstupid, then don't be a sub. Or better yet, stay clear of the BDSM \ncommunity.\n\nThe second one is someone who is extremely depressed. For whatever reason, \nwhether it is because of a genetic predisposition and/or traumatic events \nthat caused them to be depressed, this person feels as if the only things \nthey have any control over are whether they hurt themselves in someway and \nwhether they live or die. By calling them stupid, you are kicking them when \nthey are down\u2014down almost as far as someone can go. It is hard to think of \nthings more arrogant than kicking someone who is that far down. They need \nhelp, not to be told they are stupid, not to be shamed.\n\nLastly, the third one is someone who surely has problems. They could have \nanxiety, depression, paranoia, and/or problems dissociating. The cutting is \njust a maladaptive coping mechanism. They need help. They don't need to be \nshamed by people. They need help so they can learn coping mechanisms that \naren't maladaptive. If someone has a habit of using a maladaptive coping \nmechanism when they have a problem and they do this for years, then it can \nbe very hard to break said habit, but adding shame will only make it worse. \nThese people need help, not hostility. They need love, not hate. They need \nsupport, not shame.",

                    "text": "+TheUnBeheadedSlayer It's interesting that you mention AvPD and BPD as \nbeing similar because I've noticed that too and in fact a lot of mental \nhealth practitioners also noticed it which is why there was a time many \nyears ago when they were considering putting something called \n\"Avoidant-Borderline Mixed Personality Disorder\" in the DSM. But for some \nreason they decided against it, even though over 40% of avoidants also have \nBPD. That said, even if you do show signs of both, they will generally \ndefault to only diagnosing you with whichever one you suffer from more \nseverely, and leave the other one out of the equation. So with me, for \nexample: although I have a history of mild self-harm and some issues with \nswitching from loving people to hating their guts and back again over the \nslightest things and in a way that they can find quite unnerving, I've \nnever actually been given a BPD diagnosis. It's kind of just how it works. \n:3",

I remember \nreading about it somewhere as being along the lines that the difference \nbetween the two is: firstly, social anxiety is just one symptom among \nseveral with AvPD; secondly, a person with social anxiety is always looking \nat how others react to him/her and getting insecure about it, whereas a \nperson with AvPD is also looking at how he/she himself/herself reacts to \nothers' reactions to him/her and *also* at how others react to his/her \nreactions to himself/herself.... So it creates a kind of feedback loop \nwhich can get out of hand. Also, a social phobic, while insecure about how \nthey appear to others, may still believe themselves to be likeable people \nworthy of friendship and love, whereas avoidants really have serious \nself-esteem issues and have to struggle to convince themselves that they're \n\"good enough\" to do something as simple as, well, this act of typing a \ncomment here for example: we're hard-wired to expect people to hate us or \nto get angry at us. So...a lot of the time we just bottle everything up, or \nwe go to the opposite extreme and go out of our way to piss others off so \nthat at least we're in control of their rejection of us. It's pretty messed \nup and not a nice way to live.\n\"IN FACT social anxiety and avoidant have about a 60% co-morbidity \nrate!\"Very, very true \u2014 and I'm glad you brought it up: as I said, a \ncertain degree of social anxiety is like a symptom of AvPD anyway, and if \nit really gets out of hand then it can become a disorder in its own \nright in someone who has AvPD, which is how it is for me.Incidentally, did \nyou know that a lot of AvPD sufferers (including myself) are also \nagoraphobic? It makes sense: we're highly-strung individuals at the best of \ntimes, somewhat hypersensitive, and that ties in with the fact that many of \nus are easily overloaded by sensory stimulation; there's even a theory I've \nread about along the lines that it's linked to issues with things like \nbalance and proprioception and spatial awareness and so forth so that the \nworld \"out there\" appears more overwhelming for us than for most people. \nEspecially in crowds or in public places with lots of people walking about. \nThat makes sense to me since as a child I was pretty uncoordinated and \nclumsy and even now I carry a lifelong self-perception of being physically \nawkward (even though in reality I'm not *that* bad). So in my mind I equate \nsuch environment with the idea of being an accident waiting to happen and \nthat kind of reinforces my fears in other ways too.",
