When that war was \ngoing on they were on the brink of total annihilation, so, they sent \ncolonists to other galaxies to survive the war. Earth was picked to be \nterra-formed or it was already to be the savior of their kind. Why they \npicked earth? Well for starters its in another galaxy, we have an ort cloud \naround our entire solar system protecting us and 2 planets that could be \ncolonized. I'm guessing they colonized Mars first and their body structure \nstarted to change making them look more human like. It is to believe a \nnuclear war killed all life on mars due to past high radiation that has \ndied off in the atmosphere. This is how Mars magnetosphere broke. So as a \nlast resort they went to earth and barely made it crash landing their, \nlosing all the equipment they came with. So they had to start from scratch \nand earths environment overtime made them into the humans they are \ntoday(This is after the dinosaurs disappeared). They didn't share their \ninformation about Mars or anything that happened previously to protect \ntheir last chance of hope. Why didn't they share their information? The \nenemy aliens might find technology that matches our ancestor aliens and \nthink this is a colony and destroy it. I believe that if we colonize Mars \nonce again we might find some remnants of an early intelligent civilization \nof a pre-meta human being. This is my theory. Enjoy!",

Also, I never denied the food-chain. It exists for the balance. \nI believe I stated we eat too much protein than what nature intended \n(again, nature not being our mommy).\n\n  As far as the bacteria argument... really? Maybe I am saying we are equal \nto the bacteria that thrive on our skin, maybe I'm not. But cleaning (as \nyou'll find in nature) is natural.\n\n  And yes, of course WE'VE flourished as a species since the technological \nrevolution. I feel like you may have proven my point with that one. We make \nthis a WALL-E world, then we're relegated to an alien place.\n\n  And lastly, misquoting someone, ie: \"why can't we all just love each \nother, and all life, and treat the earth right\", is rude.

Human life is superior.\n     Since the industrial age, we have FLOURISHED! Life expectancy has \nincreased drastically, and both population and technology are increasing \nexponentially! Technology will continue to make the earth more inhabitable \nfor us, and help us continue to flourish here, and eventually, on other \nplanets as well. You can speculate about the effects our lifestyle will \nhave on the planet 200 years from now, but thanks to technology and humans, \nme and you can probably talk about that 200 years from now.\n     Now let's pretend that evolution could care; we are still it's \ngreatest accomplishment. It would be proud. It has finally created a \nspecies that no longer needs to evolve, can comprehend it's own existence, \nand lives drastically better than it did 2000 years ago. In fact, it \ncreated a species that not only overcame the challengers of the earth's \nenvironment, but that can also consider living on other planets. This is \nincredible!\n     Don't pretend your deep by saying stuff like \"why can't we all just \nlove each other, and all life, and treat the earth right\".
