The danger in this tendency is that \nyou leave yourself with no room for gradients of praise, and thus the \npraise becomes less reliable and loses its effectiveness if everything a \nperson takes a fancy to (from things you think are just okay to your \nfavorite things) is lumped together in a one-size-fits-all description \n(e.g., \"the best.\").

As an aside, I \nenjoy mentioning \"ice cream\" in the text of my responses, as it serves \nlargely to please the audience (as many other scrumptious food-related \nreferences do) by stimulating the audience's appetite, in a very literal \nsense.  Regarding what you might think as a disconnect between my \nabbreviation of YouTube and my full spelling of commentator \"Joe R's\" YT \nhandle, my modus operandi is to offer greater respect to human individuals \n(e.g., recognizing their names) than to the more abstract and less personal \n\"corporate persons\" (as the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United vs. \nF.E.C. like to think of them) (e.g., YouTube).  P.S.,  I still love you, \nYT!  P.P.S., I believe Joe R's qualifier \"easily\" was meant to do nothing \nmore than reinforce the unassailability of his not-to-be-contested personal \nopinion.  He might as well have typed, \"This is my favorite YT channel, and \nno one can convince me otherwise.\"  Basically, a conversation-ender.",

Floren I have never implied nor am I ever planning to critizise \nevery commenter on Youtube, nor do I feel the need to express my \nstand-point on Joe R's opinions or your constant insistence of shortening \nYoutube while still taking the time to capitilize it, and spell out Joe R's \nentire name; capitlization, spelling, and all. The reason I do not have to \nindulge in an argument over personal opinion, is that both your and my \ncomments already disputed the first word in his expression. Joe R said \n\"Easily\". If it was in fact 'easily' the best channel on Youtube, then \nevery youtuber (including myself) would simply sit in their collective \nchairs and agree. However; the fact that there is an argument over this \ncomment, already negates the supposed 'easiness' of this channel's position \non the top of the hypothetical list of \"Best Channels on Youtube.\"\nThis is why this comment is unjustifiable. It is also unreasonable because \nJoe R has not seen every channel on Youtube and has therefore no authority \nregarding this channel's quality in contrast to the entirety of Youtube. \nNot to mention that Vanilla ice cream is far superior to chocolate.",

Do you have \nany idea how long Joe R's YT comment would have to be to just introduce the \nmost basic justifications and foundations for what appears for all \npractical purposes to be a very simple expression of a personal opinion? \n Maybe we should simply interpret Joe R's comment as what it no doubt is \n(i.e., a simple expression of his favoritism towards this particular YT \nchannel), and leave it be.
