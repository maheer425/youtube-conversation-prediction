The brain is of course \ncompletely functional and if any part of it would be missing, then parts of \nthe body wouldn't work. But the mind is just not involved with 90% these \nprocesses in the brain and they work subconsciously to maintain everything \nin the body. So accessing the other parts of the brain with your mind would \nactually translate to being able to control things in your body that the \nbody would usually take care of by him or her self. So, you could take \ncontrol of sneezing maybe, or you could sleep at will, or you could control \nwhen you produce stomach acid, or you could barf when ever you wanted to \nxD. Those are just simple examples.\nThere's Indian Swamis that can control their pain and can stick needles \nthrough their arms without hurting themselves. There's people that can \ncontrol their adrenalin to keep calm or tell their heart to slow down, or \neven stand still.\nThat is what I always understood under this idea, and by no means do I \nthink it a myth.",

If \nanimals evolved then why does fossil evidence indicate otherwise in many \ncircumstances? If animals evolved then why is there a beetle that's capable \nof spraying flaming liquid at enemies without burning itself by using an \nexplosive, a catalyst, and an anti-catalyst? To add to the beetle topic, if \nthis beetle were to evolve gradually over time as many scientists suggest \nanimals did, then it would first have to develop the explosive type liquid \nover millions of years, which would leave it completely defenseless until \nthen. After that happened, every time it would use the explosive, the \nbeetle would die, so it would have to spend millions of years developing \nthe catalyst for the explosive. After that, the explosive would fail to \nwork thus leaving it defenseless again for millions of years. When it \nfinally developed the anti-catalyst then it would have to spend potentially \nmillions of years hardwiring the way to effectively use the weapon into \ntheir genetics. Point being, I don't support evolution. You can support it \nif you want, I honestly don't care (there's a first amendment for that \nreason). Just please don't broadcast it as if it's a flawless theory. \nAnother thing, it is just a theory and there's a number of scientists who \nsay it's extremely unlikely that something like that would happen. Have a \nblessed day, love ya brother!\ufeff",

                "text": "I TOTALLY dissagree on the fact that a cold doesn't occur because of low \ntemperatures. You should be more responsible about your videos. It's a \ncommon medical fact that a SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE makes you more \nvulnerable to any virus. The same goes for doing any physical activity \nafter eating. You state \"you can eat whatever you want and then go swim\". \nWtf??? Any person with a bit of common sense that has actually practiced \nsports on a constant basis knows that doing any intense activity with your \nstomach full is uncomfortable and inefficient. Even trying to work on \nsomething intellectual. It's not only the food, it's the blood necessary to \nachieve digestion, so it's concentrated in the stomach in great quantities, \nso that the rest of your bodies has a lower concentration of blood and \ntherefore any activity becomes harder.\ufeff",

However, you \nseemed to have missed the point of what he was saying. \n\nFirst, he didn't say that temperature changes don't affect the body and \nmake it easier for the virus to afflict someone. What he said was that the \ncold virus occurs more often during the winter because you spend more time \ninside with other people that might have it. In fact, your point only helps \nto emphasize this even more; it's the sudden change from cold to warm when \nyou go inside that helps you contract the virus more easily. You also have \na chance of getting it if you hang around a lot of people when you go \noutside, but it's generally easier for a virus to get you inside because of \nthe amount of things people physically handle in their homes.\n\nSecond, he might have exaggerated a bit by mentioning the gold medal, but \nhe did cover the fact that you shouldn't go for a long or intense session \nof swimming after a meal. While it's fair to criticize him for not being a \nbit more clear about this, it should also be easy to follow his train of \nthought and assume that it's not going to cause you much physical \ndiscomfort to get in a pool and just chill after a big meal. Because it \nwon't. As a lazy guy who likes to just sit in his pool after a good \nbarbecue on a nice summer day, I can attest to this fact.",

I now you don't get a \"cold\" from \nbeing cold, but I think it's because your immune system isn't as effective \nor something. And also, you're probably right about the food, but swimming \nisn't really an intense activity.",

Well, one night it was late and my \nsister had been asleep for well over two hours. I was sitting at my desk in \nmy room which is literally three feet from the door. I had the door cracked \na bit and I thought I heard something moving out in the hallway like \nsomeone was walking. I thought it was just my cats and went on with my \nbusiness. Then I hear it again and look over to see my sister peering at me \nthrough the crack in the door whispering something I couldn't understand. \nShe was staring right at me and I just about pissed my pants. I sat there \nand watched her to see if this was a prank or not, but she eventually \nwalked back to her room and back to sleep like nothing had happened. The \nnext morning I told her about it and she didn't recall anything, said she \nhadn't even dreamt about doing something like that.\nLong story short, I'm closing my door after 10 pm.\ufeff",

Your eyes are simply \nunable to adjust.

The world is known as Elementia and it has magic that \nlives in lots of the worlds living creatures in 16 different forms called \nthe Elementals of magic or Elementals for short. Sometimes humans are born \nwith powers from the elements of magic. They are called elementors. For \nhundreds of years elementors lived in peace with the normal humans but then \na group of elementors called the elementerrors rose who believed that \nhumanity was inferior and should be destroyed. For 20 years humanity fought \nthe elementerrors and eventually it became human belief that all elementors \nwere bad and should be eradicated. 15 years after the war a group of \norpahned teens discover that they are elementors and desperately try to \nreach a supposed safe place where elementors still live before the humans \ncan reach them. The teens soon fine themselves stuck in a fight for \nfreedom, equality and life in the middle of a three way war between the \nelementors, humans and the elementerrors who have reemerged. I am 15 and \nhave for a year now been working on the book and a few days ago began \nactually typing it. If interested please send me a message or go to my \nfacebook page Elementia book. Sorry for advertising myself just trying to \nsee what people think of my ideas.\ufeff",

Worth considering before you \ndeny your (future?) children the joy of all joys in childhood - sweets!! \n Kids who are fed sugar regularly are not affected by it (you have to clean \ntheir teeth though!).  Its the ones who are denied it that go nuts when \nthey get it, but kids will do this with ANYTHING that they are overtly \ndenied. Check out an interesting study that was done in kindergartens using \ndried mango and sultanas. One they were allowed as much as they wanted, one \nthey were only allowed rarely...

                    "text": "While I don't have any candy around right now to analyze, let's take a look \nat a bottle of Coca-Cola Life, Coke being a common drink that parents \nbelieve gets their kids hyped.\n\nIt contains: Carbonated water, sugar, caramel color E150d, natural \nflavoring, caffeine, acidity regulator E338 and finally sweetener.\n\nLet's take an individual look at each component. Carbonated water is a \nsimple one, it's just regular water that has carbon dioxide in it, you \nexhale carbon dioxide, so nothing strange there. Sugar is a \nself-explanatory one, it's usually harvested from a type of plant. The \ncaramel coloring used here, E150d, comes from a process called \n\"caramelization\" where you heat carbohydrates, this may sound suspicious, \nbut carbohydrates comes from sugar. Try heating a few spoons of loose sugar \nin a pot and sure enough, it'll turn into a thick brown sauce. As for the \nnatural flavorings, I can unfortunately not find any information on this, \nmoving on. Caffeine comes from kola nuts and coffee beans, the former which \nis used in Coke. The acidity regulator used, E338, is phosphoric acid, and \nlike with the \"natural flavorings\" used in Coke, I can't find any \ninformation on where this comes from. It's corrosive, however, so you may \nhave a point about unnatural chemicals here. Finally, the sweetener. In the \nbottle of Coke I have, they used steviol glycosides, which, like sugar and \ncaffeine, comes from a type of plant. However, most bottles (or cans) of \nCoke has no other sweetener other than sugar.\n\nSo there you go, my completely pointless comment and analysis of what a \nbottle of Coke contains. As you can see all of the ingredients except for a \ncouple are all natural. However, phosphoric acid is a bit concerning and \nit's strange that the formula for their \"natural flavorings\" is secret. \nThat being said, have a good day!",
