He bought a hat \nand wears it to keep warm. What is it that gives the hat meaning beyond a \nway to keep warm? Why is his hat any different from his jacket? Why isn't \nthere any deep meaning in his smoking or drinking?\n\nShould I look for something hidden in his propensity to check luggage? Is \nhis habit of checking his luggage everywhere he goes some commentary on the \nchildhood that he's leaving behind, but he doesn't really want to part with \ncompletely. So he checks in his luggage into some place safe. That way he \ncan go back and pull out his childhood - I mean his luggage - and look at \nit again later.\n\nIs there meaning in the way he treats money? When his parents give him \nmoney (I assume that's where he got his spending money since it doesn't \nappear he has a job), he spends it freely on cabs and booze and hotels and \na hooker and whatever whim he has at the moment. But as soon as his sister \ngives him money, he watches it carefully. He doesn't want to spend it on \njust anything.\n\nWhy does one thing have some deep meaning and other things don't?\ufeff",

It's hard for \nmost people to picture the way I think about things but never the less I do \nnot believe in facts or definitives, and I know that may be hypocriticaly \nworded but the intention is that of q different meaning that's hard to \nunderstand and therefor harder to understand when not explained in \nconversation. My point is that you shouldn't really count out options, like \nthe of there nit being a \u201cwrong\" or \u201cright\" without at least explaining \nyour reasoning for doing so. I respect your respect for the author's \nintentions of his reason and his meaning behind things but what if he wants \nyou to think of it for yourself? The way the book is written it could \neasily be assumed he was going against the normal status qua in terms of \ninterpretation, and either way does it matter? I realise most people, \nincluding myself, are curious at heart but will it actually be helpful, \nproductive, or important to \u201cknow\" what somone thinks about their own piece \nof art? I most likely don't want to start talking outside of our current \npicture so I will stop with this...

However unless the author provides a road map explaining \nexactly what they meant, everything will be up to interpretation to some \ndegree. My point is simply this, If we're able to find meaning in a symbol \nthat enriches our lives and expands our understanding of human nature, than \nwho cares if the author intended that symbol to convey that specific \nmessage? We'll never be able to call Salinger up and ask him if he intended \nto put meaning behind the red hunting cap or the way Holden treats money. \nSo, in my opinion, the best we can do is read critically, have discussions \nlike this one, and do our best to grow in understanding.

That's all great. \nLiterature (and any of the arts for that matter) speak to each of us \ndifferently. Our feelings are intensely personal and are going to vary from \nperson to person.\n\nBut as soon as we start putting our own meanings on everything, that means \nthere is no right and no wrong interpretation of anything. Holden's red hat \ncan be an \"enchanted object if ever there was one\" or it can be a \nmeaningless detail. Luggage can be the baggage we literally carry or the \nbaggage we figuratively carry or a device to get our belongings from one \nplace to another. \n\nBy eliminating the author we disrespect what the author is trying to tell \nus through the story.

Harding \nalso wrote a book called \"On Having No Head.\" I should also have mentioned \nHarding's wonderful video \"You Are Not What You Look Like.\" I think that \none conveys the central idea better than any other. It has to do with the \nfact that we have learned to regard ourselves as objects of our own vision \nand our own cognition. But that \"object,\" namely myself, simply does not \nexist. It's an illusion. In reality I'm always \"subject,\" never object, and \n(this is a leap, I know) therefore never disconnected from the either the \nworld \"outside\" me or the infinite eternal love, the source of all that is, \nwithin me. If this sounds like new age crap, I understand. But it's not \nthat.",
