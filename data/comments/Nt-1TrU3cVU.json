Your parents \ndon't need to tell you to break your toys to see how they work because you \nknow that if you break a toy, you can't play with it anymore (at least you \ncan't play with it as much as you can when it's fixed). And regarding the \nbaby boat one: You don't leave your child in a place where it could cause \nharm to itself unattended! No matter what safety wear it may have, you just \ndon't do that.\ufeff",

It was used in such \napplications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building \ninsulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the \nfibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats.\n\nThe prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious illnesses \nincluding malignant lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of \npneumoconiosis). The trade and use of asbestos have been restricted or \nbanned in many jurisdictions.",

Cloud chambers are quite \nenthralling to watch, plus it teaches some proper science, instead of the \nusual fake microscope kids get.\nYeah, the radioactivity isn't much of a concern. However, just because \nU-238 (Depleted Uranium, known for its use as armour-defeating munitions) \nhas very low emissions doesn't mean its just as safe the potassium in \nbananas. Potassium is relatively harmless, but Uranium is an extremely \ntoxic heavy metal that accumulates in the liver and kidneys. It can stay in \nthe body for an extremely long time (slowly ionizing the surrounding tissue \nwith alpha emissions). When inhaled it can cause lung lesions, so small \nfragments are particularly concerning. It's also highly teratogenic, so \nkeeping it away from children and pregnant women is generally a good idea. \nRadiation isn't really the main problem, think of it like handing a sample \nof cadmium or mercury to a child.

The fact that you \ntake issue with it only indicates that you are not as fluent in the \nlanguage as the native speakers are (no surprise). To a native speaker, you \nlook like a raving lunatic.\n\nThere is nothing 'more logical' about using 'damage' only for inanimate \nobjects. The purpose of language is to communicate information.

The half-lives of both U-238 and U-235 are so long \nthat you'd need a big lump of the stuff to get some meaningful Becquerels \nout of it.\n\nOn the other hand, since both isotopes are alpha-active, the main risk \nwould be ingestion of the samples. The decay products also include things \nlike radium and radon, but the amount of these would almost certainly be \nmeaningless in a very small sample.\n\nEven then, radiation would be the least of the problems, since uranium \nhappens to be toxic (the term \"heavy metal\" should be familiar). Not as \ntoxic as plutonium, of course, but I'm pretty sure it's more hazardous \nthan, say, lead.\n\nHowever: It would be exceedingly foolish to buy such a toy to a child young \nenough to eat the samples. It would be just fine to get that kind of set \nfor someone in their teens who was interested in physics, as they (likely) \nwouldn't eat the samples. Their younger siblings could of course do that, \nbut that would fall into the responsibility of the older siblings and \nparents to watch that doesn't happen, right?\n\nAnd considering the amount of lead used in Chinese toy industry, I'd say \nhaving a small sample of uranium in a science kit was probably one of the \nless hazardous things that other contemporary toys included.",

It's really no big deal. This is \nbecause It's under the legal limit of the amount you can sell at a time.\n\n2. The mathematical chance of an ionizing particle of radiation actually \nhitting one your body's atoms, much less a very specific DNA molecule that \nmight end up screwing up and giving you cancer, is EXTREMELY small. (watch \nVsauce's video \"You can't touch anything\"\n\n3. People act like just because it's Uranium it must be soooo extremely \ndeadly because you could just pop that right into a reactor and bam! the \nwhole thing goes into meltdown. Or you could put it into a bomb and now you \nhave a nuclear weapon! .... No. Uranium has to be prepped ALOT before it's \nsent to reactors to be used. It needs to be about 2% refined into U235 for \nreactor use. and about 90%-100% for nuclear weapons.\n\nHopefully now you are less scared about being irradiated or disintegrated \nby nuclear bombs built from Uranium that your sketchy neighbor's child \nmight get for Christmas. :)\ufeff",

He did \nbuild a small reactor with them though. \n\nAs for everyone else, Uranium is not as dangerous as people think and the \nradiation it emits will never do anything to you unless you were to swallow \nit, even then it would be minimal since Uranium does not linger in your \nsystem for very long. I do believe that you can get a minuscule polonium \nsource with those cloud chambers. Just look up information on alpha \nparticle radiation.\n\nI find it very silly that people freak out in such a hardcore way when any \nform of the words Nuclear, or Radiation are mentioned. It is this \nirrational fear that warranted the name change of the MRI. It used to be \ncalled the NMRI, the \"N\" standing for Nuclear. People were so afraid of the \nword that they wouldn't allow doctors to use the device on them.\n\nIf you fear something, RESEARCH IT. It is so stupid to live in the dark and \nfear something so benign as a small speck of Uranium ore... ",

Since humans have \nlarger brains we take longer to grow we also need to acquire the \nintelligence to survive and thrive, parents teach the child how to do it \nsince we are born dumber then other animals as a consequence for the larger \nbrain we lost the natural born instinct.

I opened it, and inside was glued a \nsliver of a metal disk that had ground up Uranium peppered onto it.  You \ncouldn't even see the Uranium it was so little!  BUT... still a little dry \nice in the system to make a vapor, and turn off the lights and here and \nthere a small spark could be seen popping through the cloud.  Later kits by \nother manufactures used Polonium 210, the material used in de-static \nbrushes sold even today, they worked better.  And again to be clear, the \nUranium in the Gilbert kit was U-238, and not fissile!  If they had given \nus smart kids a chunk of even U-238 as shown, the progress of nuclear power \nin America would today be far in advance of where it is.  Better yet, if \nthey had given us even mildly fissile Thorium... everything we count on \ntoday for power generation would be evolved.  You see, kids... are the \nfuture!  As it is, its hard for kids to even get specialized pyrex lab \nware.\ufeff",

Did they actually like to think that in a pretend game, the sky \ndancer will gently land on their nose?\n\nI used to have one of those squishy ball yo yo things and yeah, it was long \nenough to spin around my finger and/or wrist tightly and I can feel my \nblood circulation being cut off. Can you guess how I survived that and \nstill have every finger to type this all out effectively?\n\nSome of these on the list however, are totally justified in being banned. \nWhat's so fun about that ball clacker thing? Why put diesel in a squishy \nrubber plastic thing that you damn well know over time (especially how \nlittle time it takes cuz kids break everything) it gets worn out and pops \nopen? Why put sharp deadly nails in a penguin ball thing?! Oh yeah, don't \nforget about that good ol' uranium!\ufeff",

Of course, nobody told seven year olds that \njet pilot masks have oxygen tubes that go into them.  Also, they make cool \nvoice distorters.  So your kid isn't being a moron, he just isn't aware of \nthe dangers.  As for the sky dancers, go to any toy store before you buy a \npresent.  I used to watch little boys chase each other up and down the \naisles 'shooting' sky dancers at each other like they were missiles. \nClearly the makers of \"Sky Dancers\" missed their target audience.  As for \nClackers...well, they were around in the United States in the early to mid \nseventies.  My aunts both had them.  Its a matter of skill, trying to make \nthe two balls strike each other faster and faster until POW! they explode!\nAnd the noise, the noise, the noise, noise, noise, noise!  Of course you \ngot hit by them a lot, nobody would be impressed by the trick if you didn't \noccasionally get hurt.  \"Wow, you learned to use a clacker.

And the kids who's \nfinger's got caught were clearly being dumb and could've easily opened the \noven and get their finger out and maybe have a small burn, plus, their \nparents should've taught them about being careful and the safety hazards \nwith getting the oven.. I also I believe my parents wouldn't leave the oven \nout for us to use at will, they'd leave it in their closest then get it out \nwhen we asked for it.\ufeff",

Some people may \nget a kick of watching an animal slowly dying being tortured, stabbed and \ntaunted by a man, but I don't think most people do. When Barbie wears that \ncostume, she endorses that practise, she's making it more popular. That is \nwhy it is controversial. If I had children I would definitely not give them \nthis doll purely based on my ideas. I wouldn't like my children to think \nthat it is ok to kill animals for fun. Other than that very few women have \nbecome bullfighters, it's a men thing. The other Spain's doll they released \nis dressed as a Flamenco singer, much better.",

Wow, now that's really \nignorant.\n\n     First of all, your issues with having to relate to others as an adult \nis based on immaturity, if your parents had prepared you as mine did me, \nthat wouldn't even be a problem.\n\n     Studying hard throughout youth gives people an ADVANTAGE, which is \nessential as you continue to get older.  I had lots of fun times, did all \nthe things my friends did... just a lot less of those frivolities and a lot \nmore studying and experimenting.  \n\n     As an example, the work I accomplished in plasma physics by the time I \nwas 10, was the basis of my university entrance process, and the start of a \nthread of work I accomplished till I was 14. That work got me a 'fully \npaid' college career at 17... that's over 7 years of ivy league, top notch \neducation, with NO MONEY OWED!  \n\nSo for any of you reading this who are kids, or have kids...

I feel bad \nfor that girl and her parents.\n\nI mean I've seen a lot of pregnant girls in high school, understand that \nthey probably did use protection and it just failed, but to see a freaking \nfifth grader pregnant that's just not right. I hate that I'm freaking 19 \nyears old, and I already have to start saying things like, \"you know, when \nI was your age...\" it makes me feel a lot older than I really am. It also \nmakes me worried. I have a little sister, she's 1 1/2, and with the way I \nsee kids today, I'm worried about what she'll grow into.

Let me just put it this way. When \nthere's a drunk driving accident, we blame the driver. When there's a \nbombing, we blame the bomber. But when there's a shooting, we blame the \ngun. (Preaching the the quire again I'm sure.) Anyway, I wish there were \nmore movies about people acting responsibly with guns. Though that would be \na pretty boring movie. People always see criminals affiliated with guns, \nbut never the people who lawfully carry them, (usually because the \npreferred method is concealed, to avoid alarming anyone who may think \nthey're a \"bad guy\" because of movies they've watched.) The best way to \nconvince people that not all guns are with the bad guys (or even most, for \nthat matter) is to show people that people who own guns are normal everyday \npeople. (And no, that doesn't mean walking around starbucks, target, or \nwherever with a rifle slung on your back, that just scares people who can't \ntell the difference between everyday joe and a \"bad guy.\") That would \nprobably take people having friends over and showing them that you have a \ngun, and obviously they know you aren't a \"bad guy\" if they're your friends \nand just telling them why you have it and whats up with gun control if they \nseem interested in getting one themselves. Maybe even take them to the \nrange if they get interested with the idea of owning a gun. Anyway, don't \nthink you were expecting the response you got from me, huh? :D XD Have a \nnice day sir!",

I remember a time at a mcdonalds once where I heard a \nlittle girl crying in the play area, where was her parents?! no where! \nfortunately I was able to get up in the slide where she was to help her, \nshe was upside down and scared because she couldn't get back up, nothing \nserious, but it could have been! and sir I would like to add one thing if I \nmay about what we wouldn't have, or have as much of, if we took more \nresponsibility: violence involving guns.",
