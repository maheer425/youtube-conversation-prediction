No, members of the religious community \nshouldn't be targeted, and there are genuine religious people out there. \nMr. Rogers is a great example of that, but when you stop calling undue \naccusations 'slander' and start calling it 'blasphemy,' it starts to stifle \ndeserved criticism of, say, Pat Robertson, or Oral Roberts. Is it insulting \nto the U.S. government to call out a local mayor for dishonest behavior, \neven when such accusations aren't true? Now, I'm not religious, but I'd be \nfairly confident that most Christians would agree that accusing a preacher \nof something he didn't do, while it is a nasty thing to do, is not \nblasphemy.",

I \nhope that you know today that you are created in the image of God and that \nmakes you special. No matter how poorly you think of yourself, God sees \nyour goodness, and Fred Rogers spent his life intentionally looking for it \nas well. Try looking for the good in the world today. \n\n*\u201cWhen I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows \nthat life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That \ndeep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which \nhumankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises \ntriumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed.\u201d*\n~Fred Rogers\n\n35 Facts About Mr. Fred Rogers - mental_floss on YouTube (Ep.2)\ufeff",

He shook all of our hands and gave us a packet with \nbooks and a doctor's mask.

One of my classmates lived in the condo building where he lived \nlater in life. One day, she met his widow on the elevator, and told her \nthat she was such a huge fan. His widow, Sarah, invited my friend to come \nand see their apartment, which had a perfect replication of the \"Land of \nMake Believe\" in it. I was just struck on how she was just as gracious and \nlovely as he.\ufeff",

The point of contention here is that \n1. because you are a fan of Fred Rogers you want him to believe in what you \nbelieve in and think as you think, and so you 2. instinctively (and \nwrongfully) imbued your own views unto him\u2026 so much so that you even began \nto explain his train of thought. IF pressed, I will concede that I do not \nknow enough about the specifics of Mr. Roger's views on homosexuality to \nspeak expertly on the matter, but NEITHER DO YOU. And based on the small \namount of documentation that does exist on the topic, an unbiased person \nwould probably draw the conclusion that Mr. Rogers was very welcoming and \naccepting of all people (regardless of sexual orientation).

I \ngrew up in Baptist church (NOT Southern Baptist).  There never was any \ncampaign against homosexuality and we had prominent members of the church \nwho were gay. As juju suggested, in rational Christian churches, \nhomosexuality is no more sinful than being a liar or a tax cheat. If we \npointed out everything that the bible speaks out against in each other, \n church service would just be a 4 hour judge fest.  Our stance was and \nalways is \"just as you are\" God loves you.  \n\nI believe that juju is totally correct in how and why he handled it that \nway (he WAS an individual with is own thoughts and not a representative for \nthe Presb. Church).  It WAS a PRESCHOOL kids show.  It WAS the 60s and 70s \nand he had done more to make ALL kids feel good about themselves than any \nother children's entertainer.  He told skinny, fat, homeless, poor, gay, \nstraight, jewish, muslim, asian, autistic and ALL other kids that he liked \nthem just for being themselves.  That is powerful, friend.
