For example, I challenge any \nEnglish speaking person (native) to pronounce \"Kvikk Lunsj Kjekssjokolade\" \nwhich is the name of a common brand of chocolate in Norway (it's kind of \nlike kit-kat.)

                "text": "Michael, today my little cousin used one of the most common phrases in the \nenglish language. He used the phrase, \"a ton of money\" and it got me to \nthinking. How much is a \"ton\" of money. I suppose it depends on whether we \nuse coins or bills and depending on those two things we would have to take \ninto consideration the denomination as well. Just thought it was an \ninteresting idea, maybe you could explore it for us. Thanks, or should i \nsay Cheers! :)\ufeff",

They just evolved from \nmineral's in the ground.\n\nSomething most people need to be reminded is Evolution is proven only to a \ncertain extent, and that is certain animals (such as birds) ability to \nadapt (beak changing shape) when in different environments.\n\nTHAT'S IT.\n\nEverything is a speculation, oh we have similar DNA to apes... maybe we \nwere once apes ourselves! and then oh.. If we were once like monkeys, then \nthe religions of God are wrong! and IF they are wrong God doesn't exist!\n\n\nThat's your argument, and it's all based on speculation. There is nothing \nWHATSOEVER proving Humans are in anyway an evolved species that have \npsychically and mentally changed since the times of the first Humans (Adam \nand Eve)\n\nNor is there any evidence whatsoever that contradicts how humans are said \nto be created in the Qur'an (from clay, meaning dirt and water, which \nscience says we are most certainly made out of) nor is there any evidence \ncontradicting how the universe and Earth is said to have been created in \nthe Qur'an (Universe expanding, earth being created over certain periods, \nIron having come from meteorites in space etc All of this is in the Qur'an)\n\nThe most famous, and respected, and HONEST scientists all bear witness to \nthe perfection of the book of God, how it perfectly goes hand in hand with \nwhat science tells us of the universe around us and how it explains \neverything.\n\nFrom why we are here, to how we got here, to which direction we are going \nand why we do what we do.\n\n\nAllah has left nothing to be questioned that needs to be.\n\nWe have everything we need in the Qur'an and Hadith. Answers to all are \nquestions about life and the universe. and where we are heading and above \nall WHY.\n\n\nThe only thing stopping you is your own greed, own evil, own devil of which \nmisguides you from the truth.\n\n\nHumans see what they want, we are a impatient species who want everything \n(Heaven, Pleasure, Goodness) Now and even when an eternity of all that we \ndesire is before us our impatience comes back to bite us.\n\n\nResearch, the evidence is there. the only thing stopping you is yourself. \nand your own impatience.",

Ants use \npheromones and bees dance, but they can't recombine these to make new words \n(or pieces of information). Birds have different calls that mean different \nthings, but still have the same problem. The first time we taught language \nto primates, they found it difficult to pronounce things correctly. Ape and \nmonkey mouths are not shaped in a way that allows for the full range of \nhuman speech. This is also true for babies. Even if a baby magically knew \nhow to speak fluent English (or any other language) at birth, their mouths \nare not yet shaped in a way that would allow them to speak correctly.\n\nThat leads us to primates and sign language. Attempts to teach sign \nlanguage or written symbols on a giant keyboard have led to the primates \nlearning a few hundred words. That's quite highly functional. One team of \nresearchers was even able to teach a gorilla that she would someday die. \nThis spun her into a bout of depression. *However*, for all the times \nhumans have taught language to animals, not once (not ONCE) has any of them \never asked a question. The fact that we, as humans, can see others as a way \nto gather information for ourselves and to recognize the agency of others \nis called \"Theory of Mind,\" or ToM. This theory of mind truly sets us apart \nfrom other animals. Humans are not born with it; you can look up a fun game \nto play with kids that will let you know if they have developed a ToM or \nnot. The transition usually happens around the age of 4, or later for \nautistic spectrum individuals. But the fact that our species can develop a \ntheory of mind is the biggest cognitive difference that makes humans \nunique. And as always, thanks for reading.",

So they seemed different and more interesting than other \npeople in Eroupe with the normal brown and black hairs/eyes. However today \nthe colour of your hair or eyes does not mean that those people are more \nattractive than others because today we have make up, clothes, perfume ETC.\nAfricans (similar to Asians) did not necessarily evolve different hair or \neye colours because they did not have to, they lived in bigger groups and \non one massive continent rather than the small reigon of Europe and \nneighboring small islands. Also having no or limited other people to \ncompete with sexually so the dominant gene of black hair was superior.\nSorry got carried away with biological anthropology.\ufeff",

If you watched the \nvideo, you should have noticed that the narrator mentioned nothing about \nsweat glands.  I respect that explanation.  However, I will say that there \nis an obvious level of arrogance that humans have when explaining this \nstuff.  I'll explain via analogy...\nImagine you are the state's best 1500 meter runner.  You are enjoying a \nnice meal in your pajamas at home right before you are about to go to \nsleep.  Unbeknownst to you, just outside your house is one of your track \ncompetitors, but he has never placed in any meet.  At the moment, he's in \nhis running shoes, warmed-up, and ready to compete.  You are are ready to \ngo to sleep.  He busts open the door with a knife and starts chasing you.  \nYou make it outside and start running down the street.  You were completely \nunprepared to run for your life while you're barefoot and in your pajamas.  \nHe catches you easily, and the consequences are not pretty.\nNow, does that mean he's a better runner than you?  No, absolutely not.  \nThe playing field was not level.  He was prepared to race, you weren't.  By \nanalogy, you were like a gazelle who didn't know you had to race until a \nsplit second before, and your competitor was like a human.\nMy point is that if a gazelle is prepared and trained to run long-distance \nagainst a human, I believe the gazelle would win.  The same goes with a \nhorse.  They can take water breaks in-between being way ahead during the \nrace.  Thus, the statements in the video about humans being better long \ndistance runners than a horse and other animals are misleading.",

A mammal almost universally \nhas to take one breath per locomotive cycle. This means even at a slow \ngallop a mammal has to breath hard, whereas the normal number of steps per \nbreath for humans while staying aerobic is 2-4 steps per breath.\nWhen discussing the Gluteus Maximus's importance in running it is vitally \nimportant to note that it is not active when walking but only helpful in \npropulsion while running (indeed the Glut also stored fat that was useful \nin long sustained efforts). Other parts of the body including the nuchal \nligament that stabilizes the head were evolutionary adaptations that only \nmake sense in the context of a running man. Plain and simple we all are \nborn to run wether you choose an active lifestyle or not.\nFossil evidence suggest our ancestors were very capable of running a little \nmore than two million years ago. About the same time the Savannah's were \nemerging and forests where becoming pocketed in the Great Rift Valley. This \nnew upright running man, known as the Homo Erectus had a particular \ndifference in the size of its brain. To scientist this meant one thing, a \nnew supply of food that replaced low calorie roots and bulbs with high \ncalorie meat. But weapons such as spears or arrows were not made for \nanother 1.8 million years. So how did we get the supply of meet for 1.8 \nmillion years? We used our one advantage against all other animals, our \nendurance.\nAlso I'd like to add animals can just desire certain traits into existence \nif they are in desperate situation, such as sweat glands to improve their \nability to cool off.

The reason the animal cant rest long enough is because they \nare not humans! woot. Humans are insane endurance animals. We can sweat. \nalot! over 1000 times more then a horse. This is amazing at reducing heat. \nwe are also smaller. and less dense. remember that density insulates heat. \nwe have less muscle, muscle uses energy and relases heat. Alot of the time \nin endurance hunting humans find the animal dead or dying simply from heat \nexhaustion. Another advantage is our levels of mitochondria. These bad boys \nare orgnaisms that live in every cell of animals but are not of that \nanimal. They have seperate dna... THEY LIVE INSIDE OF US!!!! but they also \nturn oxygen into energy. Pretty important for life. We have heaps of it. \nlike... a fuck load. Making our areobic perfomance amazing. infact in \nendurance exercise like bike rancing and long distance running, scientist \nmearuses mitochondria and the person with the most usually wins. Further \nmore being bipedal is awesome. think of a deer running. It throws its legs \nout, and then in. watch how its chest extends and then contracts and think \nof its lungs. These animals can only do one breath per stride. while humans \nstanding upright can breath many times per stride. So while we may run slow \nwe win in the long run. To put it into perspective man vs horse races are \ncommen in many counties, alot of the time it depends on temperature who \nwins. Hot days humans take the cake. cold days not so much. remember that \nhorses are geneticall engineered freaks of nature nowadays and humans like \npizza. so maybe we were better once. after all.... we had to catch them to \ntame them. lol",

Look for your own \nanswers. A priest tells you god forgives all, well that's all fine and good \nbut I'm still going to encourage that you go soul searching and find the \nanswer yourself. \nBecause at the end of it all I believe that the only person you have to \nanswer to for your actions in life; is you.

You will see that the sea seems to almost \nend at a point, that is because there is a slight curve (because of earth \nbeing round) and so the ocean curves out of view. If the earth were flat \nyou could look through a high-powered telescope at the ocean and see the \ncountry on the other side, but of course that doesn't work. Also it would \nbe very disorienting",
