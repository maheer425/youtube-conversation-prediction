Since the map tiles *are* the action cards, the very \nact of picking a card is a strategic decision.  You never quite play the \nsame map twice.",

The fact that \nRhode Island and Wyoming get the same representation as New York or \nCalifornia is important. And, if it were based on appointment of the state \nlegislator, it would be more accountable to the delegates/state senate, \nwhich are accountable to their communities, making it a much more fair \nsystem than currently exists.\n\nThe people get representation in the house, the states get representation \nin the Senate and the law gets arbitrated in the Supreme Court. The \nPresident carries out the laws, not changes them to his whim. At least, \nthat is how it is meant to work.\n\nSo, it doesn't over represent any state to have equal voice in the \ngovernment.

I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Ellen Page, still only 22, is the real thing. To see her in this, 'Juno' \nand 'Hard Candy' (2005) is to realize she's fearless, completely in command \nof her gifts and will be around for a long time.\"\n\nHere's what Yahtzee had to say:\n\n\"From birth to childhood to teens to more teens to ... she actually never \nreally moves past the teens. It is quite funny at one point where she's \nsupposed to be a rogue CIA agent but she looks more like a 15 year old boy \nput on camo gear and dribbled all over his face with a black felt-tip pen \nlike mommy's little insurgent. [...] The ungrateful tard spends half the \ngame sounding like she's about to start crying and the other half crying. \n[...] Ellen page, the snotty handkerchief crammed into the body of a human \nbeing.\" \n\nIt's not so much that they have different opinions. It's how they express \nthem. I've never seen Roger Ebert grab for cheap laughs at the expense of \nthe actors. I have never seen him spending more time making fun of a movie \nhe didn't like than actually saying what exactly it was that made him not \nliking it.\n\nI'm actually not even saying that one thing is better than the other (I do \nhave an opinion on that but that's not the point I'm trying to make).

I get it \nthat he wanted to *replace* it with a different form of representation \n(namely proportional) but like I said in my comment before, you can do that \nwithout fundamentally abolishing that sort of chamber; australia and india \ndidn't abolish their upper chambers, they just reformed them to have PR - \nif they were going to \"abolish\" them, surely they'd serve fundamentally \ndifferent roles which would imply a detraction from state representation? \nall I'm saying is that his choice of words would be interpreted by a \nreasonable person to mean exactly what they'd mean in a dictionary; \n\"abolish\" meaning to remove, so why would he remove that chamber of the \ncongress if he merely wants electoral reform? election types are only one \npart of the senate, so \"abolishing\" it to simply reform that is extremely \ntrivial when you think about that properly because it suggests a removal of \n*everything* it does completely\n\nand for your information I edited out a mistake on the end based on the \nfact that I was going to write more, but then I forgot about it and \naccidentally posted the comment with an unfinished sentence left on the end \n- but I'm delighted that you think I edited because of something you said \nbecause it means that you're relying on lies to try and look better. and by \nthe way, what I'm saying is perfectly valid - the first argument I raised \nyou didn't even try to dispute so thanks a lot for that",

Even though England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern \nIreland forms one official nation, each of those different parts of the UK \nconsider themselves to be a nationality.\n\nIn the US, \"Scottish\" is considered a \"nationality.\" \"English\" is a \nnationality. Irish is a nationality. Welsh is a nationality. French, \nGerman, and Italian are all nationalities. See how that works? Italy has \none nationality. France has one nationality. Germany has one nationality. \nThe UK has four.\n\nThe reason why I used the US, is because the US, like the rest of the New \nWorld, is unique. The only native \"nationality\" in the New World are Native \nAmericans. The rest of us are descendants from Europe, Asia, and Africa. So \nit is rather customary, when discussing bloodlines, to refer to an Old \nWorld nationality. For instance: I am German, Italian, Scottish, and \nFrench. A typical American mutt I am.\n\nIn the UK, it is even stronger than that. Each section of the UK so \nstrongly identifies themselves by their heritage, and they actually call it \ntheir \"national heritage.\n\nHere in the USA, we are \"Americans,\" and in Canada, they are Canadians. \nMexico has Mexicans. And etc. There is no \"United Kingdomian.\" They are \neither Scottish, English, Welsh, or Irish. Each nationality is so proud and \nso strongly self-identified, that the governing body of the UK soccer \nfederation gives each section of the UK its own national team.
