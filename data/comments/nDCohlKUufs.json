I don't call him out for male \nprivilege. I called him out for white privilege and pointed out that he's \nonly done black and white lit, and of the black lit, it's mostly misery \nlit... but I blame the American school system and publishers for that. \nSince his values match the diversity movement, I thought he might want to \nbe aware of the gap in his own lectures.",

That white \npeople come first? That Marquez isn't taught in American Lit classes and is \none of the most banned? You said he was covering American Lit... ummm... \nthen what was that about Nigeria?\n\nI gave a clear cut solution: I noticed a weakness and then suggested books.\n\nCouldn't you HELP rather than going on defending someone who might not want \nto be defended? Calling someone out on their white privilege isn't a bad \nthing.\n\nInstead of defending white privilege, why not add to the list... say \nsomething like \"Good point\"... here are some other suggestions. Or are you \nuncomfortable that someone is being called out on their white privilege and \nsuggesting books to cover because of that weakness? And why exactly did you \nthink that Marquez wasn't part of American Lit? I'm challenging you to \nthink deeper.\n\nDo you even know a list of books outside of what I suggested that are \nCentral and South American Lit? That are Asian lit? (Hey, Amy Tan is taught \nin schools...) Or is this symptomatic of how poor the education system is \nthat you feel more comfortable defending someone for the lack of these \nthings because you never got it in school yourself, which just goes to \nshow, the problem I'm highlighting. Don't defend your own ignorance. And \ndon't defend white privilege especially to someone PoC complaining about a \nproblem. Don't justify it by saying he needs to cover white people first \nand ignore others... He could have mixed it from the start, but he didn't. \nThat's problematic and I thought he would want to know and maybe also get a \nlist of books to look at... because I know that he knows them. So maybe \nmoving forward, that could be addressed.\n\nSo maybe you should instead of challenging me come up with books that could \nbe suggested to fit these categories rather than defending him? Can you \neven?

I know that he knows that and thinks that--that the way that Lit \nclasses in the US are run are for white males, but I know he doesn't \n*believe* that, which is why teaching *outside* of straight white (mostly \nabled) males is important. This is why writers are so intimidated when it \ncomes to writing diversity. It's because they are never taught anything but \nthe majority unless they get special classes. Which is just sick. If he can \ncover the Mongols and the Kushan Empire in the History section, he can also \ncover something that's more diverse in the Lit classes. Because, I'm \npersonally sick of running into writers who say, \"What is African American \nLit?\" \"Why can't I write automatically about slavery with black people with \nwhite people saving them?\" It's because our education system sucks and John \nGreen could recognize this and purposefully choose books that fit his \nvalues. Some of my teachers did.  People challenged him on the mostly white \nEuropean World history class and he fixed it. So I'm pointing it out again \nwith a list of books/authors. Besides, this isn't titled, \"US Lit class\" He \ncan do whatever he likes. (Besides, not only the US uses English as its \nofficial language).\n\n\nBTW, Marquez is usually covered in American Lit classes... though I wish \nsome of the non-magic realism was also taught as well. But then I'm getting \ninto stereotypes people teach in Lit classes... If you don't know Marquez, \nthere is a problem. That was also an option in my own lit classes to read. \nI voted for it, but I was out-voted. It's also one of the most banned books \nin US lit... (Hundred Years of Solitude). The fact that you don't think \nSpanish authors are covered in typical US lit classes says a lot. John \nGreen mentioned him, but didn't cover him. (The other names are also common \nin US lit classes...).\n\n\nGertrude Stein? She's actually very critical for the history of Modern Lit \nand how books are viewed today. Also a Queer author. A little hard to \nstudy, but still, a lit class shouldn't skip her, since how many ways \npeople think about literature today is due to her and those in her group. \n(People usually skip her in favor of the straight white males in her group, \nbut she was at the center.)",

No male, until the modern \nage has ever been spared from work, and even now it is looked down upon. \nPeople seem to think that ruling and such isn't work, but I dare you to \ntell all the politicians in the world they will not be paid any more and \nsee how quickly they stop working.",

I'd put it down to how vulgar (as in common) the work is. \nVulgar things tend to be more popular where as deeper thing things tend to \nbe rarely widely hailed. And those things that are more brilliant are often \nhailed as more brilliant, not because the common person understands, or \nknows, having not read it, but because people who they think are brilliant \ngave declared them such or it is just common knowledge. That'd be my \nguess...\n\n+mollified5 The feminist world view is not discussing the women in the play \nor anything like that. That's not what I'm referring to. The problem comes \nfrom the assumption that you put forth that these women are atypical \nbecause they are strong or that these characters are more atypical than the \nothers. What's happening is that you're drawing up this curtain between \nmale and female and giving special recognition as if something else were \nhappening based on sex.\n\nI haven't read or scene the plays of Shakespeare. I've been meaning to, but \nI'm listening to this and I notice that more than half the video play time \nis dedicated to Ophelia and Gertrude and then 4 minutes largely focusing on \nHamlet, but going between Hamlet, Gertrude, and bringing in other \ncharacters. I then look at this and what was said and I say...wow, this is \nwhat happens when you're gynocentrically presenting stuff. You leave out \nimportant information like the other 3 male characters I picked up barely \nthat are important to the story to focus on a character, Ophelia, who from \nthe way described means not much to the story's overall plot, and failing \nto discuss the main relationship between Mother/Son/Step-Father which is \napparent in the set up, but in the video is unanalyzed. Instead you and \nJohn say \"this character is so atypical that it needs to be adressed\" when \nanyone with a passing knowledge of the subject knows that the flower giving \nbehavior thing wasn't atypical. Of course the mentioning of Ophelia death \nis made worse by the whole description which ignores that it is portraying \nit as both something that she did on purpose AND something that happened to \nher ignoring that the set up described lends to pointing out she must be \nfairly stupid to think that climbing on a branch over a lake in the type of \ndress she would have been wearing is some how safe or intelligent. So he \npainted that it was both an accident where the world acted on her, but \ntries to empower at the same time by saying it was her choice. This failure \nto see this is another problem within looking at thing from a feminist \nworld view, because it demands that women be perfect and unable to be \nstupid or make bade mistakes, while simultaneously saying that they are \nperpetual victims and it is not their fault for putting themself in bad \nsituations. When have this view point, again, you're going to get nothing \nbut nonsense.\n\nAnd then again, my mind slips back to why do you think it is important to \ntake up 2 or 3 minutes largely focusing on this character that seems is \nlargely just a background character meant to act as a type of juxtaposition \nin an 9 minute presentation which is supposed to be largely about \nmother/son/step-father interactions and the rights of ascension and, \nsupposedly, what it means to be a hero? What's more why are you trying to \npush her into saying that she is somehow worthy of that title. From what \nwas presented she, nor anyone in that play even remotely brings that \nquestion up, but her I'd say least of all. Why not bring it up in relation \nto Gertrude drinking the poison? Or perhaps all of Gertrude's actions as \nsome of the comments in the video and out seem to indicate she could have \ndone all of her actions for the greater good of Hamlet and perhaps the \nKingdom. That'd make more sense and it would be objective rather than \nwasting our time with what seems to be a background character. It seems the \nonly reason to not do that is because then it allows John to feel better by \npresenting female characters and emphasizing them, rather than presenting \nthe material well and unbiased as possible, you know, the mark of someone \npurportedly trying to inform and educate.",
