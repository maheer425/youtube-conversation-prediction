                "text": "So, for those of you that played Revengance (stay with me on this one, I \nhave a valid point), you'd know that the main rival of Raiden is a cyborg \nnamed Sam. All throughout the game, he had Raiden on the back foot, and \neveryone assumed that he had a better cyborg body. But then Raiden finally \nkills Sam, and it turns out he wasn't even a cyborg, he just pretended to \nbe. All that time everyone thought his skill came from his cyborg implants, \nbut he was just an godlike fighter. That's what I like to think happened \nwith Tarkus. He went to this land human, with all of his knights, \npretending to be undead so that he could get a challenge worthy of him. \nWhen he finally perished, he died as a man, not a hollow. Of course this \nhas holes in it, it's just what I like to think.\ufeff",

Because only the undead return to life. Just like u. How when u die \nu return to a bonfire. Tarkus didnt. He just died. So i think that was it \nfor him. N i think he literally wanted to do it for his nation. Or even for \nhumanity. I think after he scraped thru sens fortress n most likely \nslaughtered all the giants he got to that top platform n saw the iron golem \nn said ok imma take a quick break then smite this guy with every ounce of \nblind rage i have in me. I think he scratched his summon sign on the ground \nso that the next hero who got that far would get thru FOR SURE. I think he \nblazed through the iron golem rippd his core out n had the demon gargoyles \ntake him to anor londo. I think what u summon is the ghost of tarkus. N i \nthink thats why u never hear him talk. Same with beatrice i think. Just \nfriendly ghosts aiding a fellow hero. Savage assed ghosts at that. ",

The Balder and Berenike \nknights sought out Anor Londo looking for a cure to the undead curse that \nhad begun ravishing their lands. Tarkus could have easily been human, \nvolunteering to travel with the undead knights to give them his aid, I \ndon't think any of them would have protested having help from Black Iron \nTarkus. He could have done this for honor or glory, to find a worthy \nchallenge, or simply because he wanted to help the people of his nation. A \nlot of people claim that Petrus may have been human, but I think if anyone \nin the game was not undead, it's much more likely to be Tarkus. ",

I think, perhaps, he and at least \none of his fellow heavy knights of Berenike made it passed Sen's and the \nIron Golem, and all the way into the painted world. I can imagine Tarkus \nand his heavy companion fought their way through the painting guardians, \nand through Ariamis. Upon their arrival at Priscilla's fog gate, Tarkus \npossibly ordered the heavy knight to guard the entrance, not knowing what \nmay happen. Tarkus, possibly out of nobility, decided not to cause harm to \nPriscilla, and without the ability to pass back though the fog gate, did as \nPriscilla asks. He left the painted world. His death was most likely at the \nhands of the waiting guardians, perhaps they were too numerous for him to \ntake alone. In the end it's all speculation. It was the only explanation I \ncould find as to why there was a heavy knight in Ariamis. I feel it's not \ntoo far fetched.\ufeff",

So if you \nreally want to, maybe it is Tarkus was made into a scorpion fella and then \nsuch a long time passed that he forgot his name or someshit xD ",

You \ndie, then you come back, except not all the way.  You are living, but your \nbody is corroding and you have to \"reinforce\" yourself, your weapons, \neverything around you with souls gained from others.  \n\nEverything around you will corrode if you don't reinforce it.  Every death \nyou undergo lessens your ability to reinforce, and further strips what you \nhave.  It's a case of literally *becoming hollow*, of having all your \nsubstance torn away.  The shambling hollows you encounter early on have no \nmore clothes or hair, their swords are broken nubs, and they have no mind \nto do anything except for sensing your reinforced souls and attacking you.  \n\nFinally, when hollows truly give up, you see them huddled in corners or \ncrying and praying (such as in New Londo).  Eventually they stop moving, \nand their bodies just rot.  As a result, the only thing left of them is \ntheir \"lost\" soul, which never dies, but becomes part of the bonfire \nreinforcement that you use to keep yourself from hollowing.\n\nI think it's interesting to see where these rotting bodies end up, because \nthey each tell a story.  Even the one who gives you your pyro flame or \ncatalyst at the beginning is a little tale of some undead soul who had only \none goal, and when that failed, they just sat down to die, clutching the \none last thing that mattered to them.
