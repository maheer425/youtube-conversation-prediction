                    "text": "+Zane Kuro\n\nOh, no, Russia has nothing of the sort like the Great Firewall. It is a far \nmore subtle censorship. As part of the infamous legislation from a few \nyears back that requires all blogs and similar internet postings with over \n3000 readers to be \"truth-checked\" by the government to combat \"foreign \ninfluences and propaganda\", no blogs with over 3000 readers or \nRussian-registered websites with over 100.000 visitors per month are \nallowed to link to non-Russian news sites without permission.\nAt the same time, the government funds \"native\" social media websites like \nVKontakte that are hardly used outside Russia, both because they can easily \noutcompete Western alternatives like Facebook in a still Western-sceptical \ncountry like Russia, and because they don't need to pay to spy on you if \nthe site is Russian, like they would have with foreign social media.\nOf the major foreign sites that are established within Russia, they usually \nhave to abide by restrictions to what content they can show to Russian IPs, \ne.g. Google have to put anti-Kreml articles further back in google search \nresults. This can create somewhat odd situations in cities near the \nborders, for example in Murmansk, where the closeness to Norway means that \non different times of day you can open relatively pro-American sites like \nYahoo News and see \"Modern fascism: the dangers of Ukraine\" at one point \nand \"Pro-Russian Donbass separatists execute 56, arrest 400 over \n'encouragement of Ukrainian culture and similar traitorous acts'\" later.\nHardware-wise the Russian government endeavors to have as many servers \nbased in Russia as possible, to give the FSB free access to the information \nof the users. It is also an added security if Russia cuts itself off from \nthe internet, like Putin has threatened several times over the last two \ndecades. By having as much information as possible stored on local servers \nthe RuNet would keep functioning without the rest of the body of the \nInternet, although sites like Google and Youtube would be non-functional, \nof course.\n\nThe latest addition to the internet restrictions is the requirement to give \npersonal information when logging on to a public network, which ostensibly \nis an anti info-theft measure. In reality it exists to monitor those \naccessing the Deep Web to bypass FSB and Ministry of Information \nmonitoring, for example the more anti-Putin, potentially-revolutionary \nparts of the Communist Party and hacker groups like Anonymous, which \nrecently humiliated Kreml by hacking and releasing the real results of the \nreferendum in Krim to join Russia (Russia still won the referendum, mind \nyou, but only by a slight majority roughly equal to the amount of Russians \nliving there, and less than half a million voted as opposed to the official \nnumber of 1.8 million, which caused huge embarrassment because the Kreml \nhad publicly declared the rather ridiculous 97% vote to be true nine months \nago, if you remember).\n\nAll of this makes sense, of course. By allying with the LDPR, Yedinaya \nRossiya has enough votes in the Duma to pass what laws they want, so moves \nto make Russia more cut off from Western influences are natural given \nPutin's dwindling support in recent years. With Gorbachev and the other \nsocial democrats hating him for refusing to cooperate or even join the \nWest, with the Communists hating him because of his oligarch friends \n(although nowadays they fear him rather than love him after he arrested \nseveral of them for trying to replace him with Mikhail Khodorkovski), and \nwith the tsarists (there's oddly many of those around the last few years, I \nthink their support might have increased after the Baltics went West) \nhating him for being a former KGB torturer (or at least, that's what they \nsay he was; more realistically he was in charge of exposing Western agents, \nthey just connect him with torture because he was always around when they \nwere dragged off for counterrevolutionary activities), Putin's support has \nbeen dwindling the last few years. He only barely won the last election, \ndespite it being rigged in several republics. Operation Terrakota (the \nswift military occupation of Krim followed by a replacing of the local \nParty of Regions government with one loyal to Russia and a snap referendum \nof joining the Federation), too, was as much an attempt to boost Putin's \npopularity as for the oil most Westerners think he was after.",

Native Americans were treated horribly by \nEuropean settlers and some fought back. There are environmental problems, \nhence Ariel; the problem between the U.S. And the mid. East was pretty \nserious, and so on. This version is a bit more offensive, sure. But it's \naccurate, to a point. Mulan- transsexuality is a normal thing. Cinderella- \nThere weren't medical advances, nor proper sciences, in her time period so \nkilling her for being insane is quite true. Tiana- Katrina was a wreck. The \nentire situation. And unfortunately, many peoples' lives were destroyed \nand/or taken. The Elsa one is a bit of a stretch, and isn't anything \nhistorical, but if she became evil, this could happen. It's an alternative \nWWII universe, you know?\n\nI mean, what I'm getting at is, if people are insulted by this, they'll be \ninsulted by most other things in day to day life.

Nowhere does he say anything \nnegative against all of the Jewish people and others who were considered \n'imperfect,' he just mentions concentration camps, which were in use long \nbefore WW2 and are still afterwards, depending on your interpretation of \nplaces like Guantonimo Bay. Plus, America had concentration camps for the \nJapanese Americans, or just about any Asian American during WW2 too. If \nanything, when people make comments or allusions to the holocaust in media \nforms like this, they just raise awareness of it and remind people it \nhappened. As a whole though, people need to stop being so touchy about the \nsubject, yes it happened and yes it was absolutely horrible, but just \nbecause someone makes a joke or play-on words about it doesn't mean they're \ndisrespecting the deceased in anyway.",

And I would do so with a smile on my \nface and have good dreams from them on. That said I still laugh at the Elsa \nclip. By making fun of the horrible things that happen we lighten the load. \nAny person who says they have never in their life once laughed at something \nwrong or bad is lying.

I know why he wrote the \nbook and what its purpose was but that was not my point. I am glad you \npoint it out though, because I was hasty with my writing and made it sound \nthat way. Also, If you are really interested in this history, I suggest you \nread the book Hitler's War by Henry Turtledove. He writes fantastic \nhistorical fiction. I also disagree with you a tad on the military part. he \nlet his generals do a lot of the work yes, and he was EXTREMELY good at \nmanipulation as you said. But, if he wasn't at the head of his party and \nhadn't made some crucial decisions the war would have gone differently. as \nis, the continuous bombing of London and the blitzkrieg on France were two \nfantastic strategies (planned or not). Also, one of the main reasons that \nHitler lost so badly in Russia was because he WASN'T leading his soldiers \nand being tactful. Stalin made it clear that deserters would be shot \nimmediately after they turned to run and his men were ordered to charge \nuntil they broke German ranks. That is what I learned at least. If it \nweren't for his EPIC failure in Russia, Hitler could have very well taken \nover half the world, which is all he would need to get control over the \nrest, seeing as how the half he conquered led the world anyways. So, this \nis what I learned, but I bow before your knowledge source and intelligence. \nAgain, Check out Turtledove, He has written many great books, but I loved \nHitler's War.",

It was a propaganda \nbook there are many lies in there. For example a big part of book is about \nhis time in WW1 (without which ww2 would have never happened). He wrote \nabout him being a soldier and how he fought for his fatherland (not sure \nwhether this is the right translation) but in reality he only ran around \nsavely behind the front and delivered messages. Also I agree with you \nHitler was a genius in a way but the most horrible one ever. But a lot of \nhis (military) success either wasn't actually his or was pure luck but the \npropaganda made or all look like Hitler did everything. for example the \nfamous blitzkrieg Viktory in France actually was mainly caused by soldiers \nnot listening to orders . His true genius isn't strategy it is \nmanipulation. If he would had went out to the evaluations and said well i \nam going to kill democracy, kill all non master race (I know it sounds \nweird but that is the 1 to 1 translation) people and I am going to start a \nsecond world war. There would have been now way he succeed not even with \nall his money. Of course the money was a important factor but still he \nmanipulated on a scale like nothing has ever been before and (hopefully) \nwill ever be. Also he really had a few psychological problems. He killed \nhis family before he killed himself. Nobody would have ever put his family \nup on trial. Also he ordered to destroy all personal information about him \nso we (sadly) know very few. \nNow two things \nA: I knew I did quite a few mistakes but I am typing this on my phone at \nmidnight and I generally do a lot of mistakes (I just overlook them)\nAnd B I am quite good informed about this topic because I am from Germany \n(so I know all the original phrases and with the translations) and let me \ntell you here you learn so much about WW2 (especially if you are interested \non history).For example these horrifying movies of the kzt were shown to me \nwhen Is nine years old in history class (half of my class left the room and \nwent home that day and some even stayed home for two days) and I had dreams \nabout it for months. I really think it is important to learn about these \nthings but can't they show the kids the movies when they are like twelve \nand until then just inform the kids without pictures.. \nWell I am getting off topic. Sry about that and the long comment but this \nis important to me personally",

The story, the Snow queen, is about a queen who \nkidnaps a small child whom then has to be rescued by his close friend. The \nstory has been made into a movie before Frozen, a cartoon movie from Soviet \nin 1957, a tip for anyone of a darker mood. Frozen was then created as a \nmore friendly way of doing it, since the original had no team sister force \nand was also sort of gritty. The architecture in the movie is mainly based \non old northern European/Scandinavian models. For instance, the stave \nchurch, which is held up by a series of carrying beams, which in turn gives \nthe structure is characteristic appearance. The rest of the houses follows \na standard european architecture, not enclosed to any country.\n\n\n+Craig Zombar +Clara Lim +Theblackburnstwo page +Claystead ",

I still think it went too far with \nthis part but it will make people think more about the message behind the \nsong.\nIt's important to remember the horror but after 60 years of moaning and \nremembering, people want to move on. I'm sick on hearing what happened, i \nwas 16 when my history teacher showed me a holocaust movie and i almost \nbarf in class cause it was too much to handle. I remember because i was \nforced to and because hitory class was around 2nd world war all the time. \nLike it was essential for us to know. I want to forget now, but i will \nnever forget, you can't forget such things .... Nowadays, there's still \nthousands of people who are hating Germany and Germans because of their \ncountry history. I think it's essential for our society to heal from this \nwar and joking around pretty sad nasty topic is the only way to make it \ntolerable. The Elsa part didn't make me laugh but in the end, it's \nimportant to focus on our worl's real problems than what happened in \n1939-45\ufeff",

That's like saying everything \nsarcastic anyone ever said, or any song that came on and you sang along \nwith, is true about you. Everything you ever said was true because, \napparently, someone on YouTube thinks that way. Well, I disagree. He didn't \nsay he believes that the holocaust is to be made fun of. Everyone know it's \nserious, but that's /why/ people make jokes about it. The jokes mean we're \nover it, I think. If you aren't over it, then the joke isn't for you. Find \nsome jokes that are, don't complain when something isn't targeted to you \nand your interests/opinions/values. Seriously. Not everything is to benefit \nyou and your needs. I found it funny, that's not saying I would kill Jews. \nIt's like being offended about what the other princesses are saying, just \nbecause you're personally related to the topic, except everyone knows about \nthe holocaust... not everyone is into bestiality, not everyone is in an \ninsane asylum, and not everyone deals with gender transformation. It's \ntargeted to anyone who finds it funny, not to you, who doesn't. Ya'll can \ndeal with it and watch it for the other parts, or you can leave it be. OR \nyou could complain about it, but that's a waste of time, you usually get \nchewed out, and you could be watching something that appealed to you \nalready if you weren't in these comments to complain about something that \nisn't appealing to you. :/",

Along with \nthat neat little comparison, though, is a much bigger struggle throughout \nthe movie; namely, Elsa finding out exactly where she's supposed to draw \nthe line between how much she cares about herself versus how much she cares \nabout others. Else had spent her whole life basically trying to become \nsomething she wasn't (or, perhaps more accurately, suppress what she really \nwas) for the sake of other people, which, while probably admirable in its \nown right for a person in a position of authority, also had huge negative \neffects on her psyche and caused her to feel, among other things, worthless \nand self-dejecting. \"Let It Go\" could be considered negative, like you \nsaid, where she's putting herself above everybody else, but I also see it \nas a positive in some ways; she's basically making a necessary emotional \ndevelopment all in one leap that is normally made throughout one's entire \nlife up to becoming an adult, which does involve overshooting the mark and \nhaving to dial it back until you find a balance. The key struggle in Frozen \nisn't exactly geared around learning love and compassion for others, but in \na significant way it's also about the struggle between a person's \nresponsibilities and their need to stay human. And if you think about it, \nElsa is certainly going to be a significantly better and more confident \nruler after the events of the movie than she would have been if they hadn't \nhappened.\n\nJust food for thought.",

As inspiring as it was, \"Let it go\" is all \nabout no longer paying attention to the needs and rules of society: she's \nputting her needs and wishes above those of everybody else.

He could have also maybe used a matte, like a garbage matte, \nand then he could have gone into the settings and set the lines in between \nthe videos to be black.
