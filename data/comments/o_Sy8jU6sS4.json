Sweden and Norway and closing \nprisons down, not because of lack of funding but because of lack of \nprisoners.  In the U.S., on the other hand, private corporations get to use \nprisoners as slave labor, get money from the governments to house and keep \nand prisoners (most of the money, of course, going into their pockets \nrather than into appropriate resources from the prisoners), and as a \nresult, we can't seem to find enough money to fund the prisons that we \nhave, which are just packed to the brim with people.  Not every state has \nprivate prisons -- thankfully, mine doesn't -- but we still treat them \nbasically like animals, and it's not fair.

It's never \ndeterred anyone from committing any of those types of crimes, and it \ndoesn't make any sense morally.  \"You killed someone, so to show everyone \nhow wrong killing is, we're gonna kill you.  That'll learn ya!\"  But, no, \nit has nothing to do with any coherent sense of justice and everything to \ndo with the satisfaction of seeing someone punished.  Karen Wynn, a \nresearcher at Yale, has been doing studies on babies and their inherent \nsense of morality, and she's determined that babies are born with a \nrudimentary sense of morality, but not all of it \"good.\"  Basically, their \nmorality touches on the entire spectrum of human morality but in very \nsimplistic, very direct ways.  And one of the things almost all babies and \nyoung toddlers have in common is the sense of wanting to see someone \npunished for doing something that they see as wrong.  My point in all of \nthis is that the death penalty strikes me as reflecting the fact that a lot \nof people never really mature beyond that stage of development -- \"You do \nbad stuff, we do bad stuff to you!\" -- but, yes, in more \"adult\" minds, \nthere's added sense of \"superiority,\" the need to distinguish oneself from \nothers (\"us\" vs. \"them\") as much as possible -- and what's a clearer way of \ndemonstrating that someone else is so much more evil than you are than \n\"executing\" them?\n\nAnd, yes, I'd agree that there are a lot of people who are perfectly \nwilling to hand over everything to the police state in order for a \nguarantee of \"safety\" and \"justice,\" both of which fall by the wayside once \nthe police state has you.  I mean, look at the dichotomous reactions to Ed \nSnowden's revelations: some, like me, view him as a hero; others view him \nas a traitor for \"betraying his oath\" (even though his oath was to the \nConstitution, not the government -- but a lot of people consider one's \nloyalties to the \"brotherhood,\" so to speak, as being more important than \nloyalty to the very ideals that that brotherhood is supposed to represent \nand defend).\n\nA lot of the rest of us, I'm sorry to say, feel powerless to do anything \nshort of violence, and unless everyone rose up at once, the armed forces \nwould quash any rebellion very quickly....

Do I \npersonally think he should have been allowed to live (setting aside the \nfact that his death sentence no doubt cost this country more monetarily \nthan a life sentence would have) -- or, to phrase it more generally, do I \nwant people who do the sorts of things that he did to continue living?  My \ngut response is to say no, but again I find that I keep asking myself, What \nis gained by killing him?  And by killing him, are we losing some potential \ngood later on (such as, for instance, if he turned himself around in prison \nand began helping other prisoners who *weren't* condemned to life in prison \nto become better people)?\n\nAgain, in case my answer is unclear, my gut reaction is to say no, someone \nwho's committed such terrible crimes has no real right to continue living; \nand if I were a lover, friend, or relative of one of the people he'd \nmurdered, I'd very likely be on the front line screaming for his head or \napplying for the job of executioner just so I could flip the switch.\n\nHowever, that's not the point of this at all.  The point is, I do not \nbelieve that it is the role of the government to avenge people; rather, it \nis the role of the government to administer justice.  Then the question is, \nis death a just response to one or more acts of cold blooded murder? \n Provided that the person isn't mentally ill or debilitated (and thus not \nresponsible for his or her actions), in an ideal world, perhaps it would be \n-- but this isn't an ideal world, not even close.  With all of the doubt \nthat exists in our justice system, with all of its corruption and its \nmulti-tiered nature, a civilized society cannot justly inflict death as a \npunishment for a crime unless the government can be 100% sure with \nincontrovertible evidence that the defendant is guilty (not simply beyond a \nreasonable doubt but beyond any possible doubt whatsoever).  If one \ninnocent person is murdered by the state, then it nullifies the legitimacy \nof all the state-sanctioned murders of guilty people, because then we're \njust murdering people because the law says we can.\n\nAnd there is yet another question: What does execution get us as a society, \nother than the warm and fuzzy feeling anyone gets after a blood sacrifice \nto cleanse ourselves?  Is it a deterrent?  It doesn't appear to be.  So, \nwhat really is gained by the society as a whole from execution that we \ncould otherwise get with life imprisonment without the possibility of \nparole, other than less money spent on the latter?",

And that is the injustice of the death penalty that I \nmeant to illustrate.\n\nThat's all that I was getting at, but if my wording was confusing, I \napologize.  I'm glad we can agree that executions fail to achieve their \nstated goals.  I would say that it is for several reasons, not the least of \nwhich is the fallibility of our system.  However, even then, I don't see \nhow murdering someone in response to a terrible act truly benefits a \nsociety.  I will be fair and say that I've never had the horrific \nexperience of having someone I love murdered by someone, and I can expect \nthat I would wish death on the person who murdered that loved one if I had \nsuch an experience.  However, I think that a society should reflect the \nbest of humanity rather than its basest urges and desires, of which revenge \nis one.  It's perfectly reasonable for a person to want another person dead \nwhen the latter has murdered someone dear to the former; I'm just not sure \nthat society at large should be in the business of making such things \nhappen.  Furthermore, the death penalty has never served as a deterrent; \npeople have murdered and done other terrible things for as long as \nsocieties have existed, and I don't think it's fair to suggest that the \nonly thing that's kept the majority of people from killing each other is \nfear of death specifically -- perhaps fear of punishment factors in, but \nnot death specifically.  I rather think that most people don't kill other \npeople because they have senses of morality/ethics that tell them it's \nwrong to murder another person.  All the death penalty does is add more \nmurder to the mix than would otherwise be there -- but that's just my \nopinion.\n\nHow it's applied -- that is to say, to crimes that poorer people are more \nlikely to commit, especially given that even when rich people commit \nmurder, they're often spared the sentence of death -- is also an issue well \nworth considering in regard to its effectiveness, but I'd say that the \ntwo-tiered justice system proves my earlier point about its ineffectiveness \nrather than suggesting that there'd be a more perfect way of utilizing the \npractice.",
