Now when \nthey grow older they can be defiant about the rebuke and \"back talk\" to the \nchuff/sneeze like they don't want to freeze and look around. They know \neverything (just like a teenager). Doing a quick loud sniff is often a way \nto imitate the momma cat chuff. Try it next time your cat is naughty and \nsee if they stop for a second, then use that second to redirect with a toy \nto doing good behavior. Use the sniff sparingly or they will no longer heed \nyour warning. :)",

Some need lots of time to grieve, others \nneed a rebound or brand new kitty right away (humans do this with \nrelationships too, in fact having a rebound date or relationship is \nextremely effective with loss) some even do taxidermy as a tribute. I don't \njudge either way. All ways of grieving are right. The only thing I'm \nagainst is \"replacement\" naming the animal Penny jr or Penny 2.0 that looks \nexactly like the cat is to me not right. It's not dealing with the loss and \ntrying to pretend it never happened. It isn't good for the human mind and \nit isn't good for the cat, because cats can have different personalities \nand ways of doing things. No cat can or will ever replace Penny and I'm \nsure Penny would want you to be happy and is probably very happy about the \nlife he had with you. No need to worry about the way you've dealt with your \npersonal grieving of the loss of your friend. :)",

She has a full spectrum \nof words, sounds and actions just like a human child and is prone to being \ngrumpy like a grumpy toddler too. At first, I had no idea what this bizarre \ntail quivering meant as my other two don't do it but upon meeting my \ngirlfriend's cat for the first time, it dawned on me that it's a cat's way \nof showing complete vulnerability. You see, my girlfriend's cat Thor wasn't \nsupposed to like strangers, let alone let them near him the way he allowed \nme to. He quivered his tail near me too and I immediately sensed that he \nwas dropping his guard for me but that it wasn't something that I should \ntake lightly. I was being given a very small delicate chance to earn my \nplace inside his circle of trust. Which I did and which stunned my friend. \nThankfully my gorgeous pure white EXTREMELY loving part burmese boy, Romeo, \ntaught me the 'slow blink' years ago as well as the gracious head nod. I \ncan't say that I knew exactly what these actions meant but I did notice \nthat a cat will only blink or close their eyes if they trust you. But more \nthan that, Romeo has taught me about the energy that's relayed during each \naction so just like any other language, there must be feeling as well.\nOops, off point there. Sorry. Anyway it seems to me that the tail quiver is \na sign of rare vulnerability mixed with a touch of nervousness where they \nreally seem to be offering themselves to you. My rescue cat does it as a \nsign of greeting too when she hasn't seen me for a few hours or so after \nshe's been outside. Not all the time so I can't say with absolute certainty \nwhat this action REALLY means.",

I think that getting groomed (licked) by your cat it is \none of the biggest compliments that you can get from a cat.  Followed up by \nthe \u201chead-butt\u201d/nuzzle.  They are telling you that you are part of their \nfamily, and marking you appropriately.  It is also nice to see my cats \ndoing it to my dogs, even though my dogs are utterly and completely \nconfused by the gesture.  ",

What was her body posture? Was her fur puffed up and \ntail thrashing? Did she also swallow alot, like lick her lips while looking \nat you? This would be a defense thing, she feels threatened and is unsure \nof your intentions.\nIf she was crouched down, ears back, fur laying close to her skin, she's \nfrightened. If you made a move towards her while doing that she'd probably \nbolt.\n\nAs the other person said though, this isn't nice to do to a cat and she may \nbegin to dislike you greatly. It's like staring at a human. We all feel \npretty aprehensive is someone gives us strong eyes too. It usually \nconstrues as \"murderous\" or \"I'm going to get you\" intent in our minds. \nPredators stare when they'e going for the kill. It's also a sign of no \ntrust. You do not blink or take your eyes away from something you are wary \nof. She's seeing that you don't trust her and that she can't trust you by \nyou staring at her.",

I get that.  My problem is why doesn't my cat let \nme hold him?  I got him when he was a couple of months old from the local \nHumane shelter.  He let me hold him all the time when he was little but \nsince he's gotten older he won't.  He comes around me purring and vibrating \nhis tail and crying at me to pet him and scratch his face but as soon as I \ntry to pick him up he immediately jumps away from me.  He will  come right \nback to me but I can't pick him up.  I don't understand it.  I live with \nChronic pain and sometimes it just feels good to hold a soft warm cat.  I \nhave another cat that will let me hold her for a little while but the male \ncat just refuses.  Any suggestions for me?  Thanks so much.  I watched a \nmarathon of My Cat From Hell.

The cats we had when I \nwas younger or even the other 4 now don't share the same level with anyone \nlike Tilly does for me.

What you \nexperienced is totally normal, when you raise a cat from birth/early age, \nthey always end up being amazing with people. I hand raised a group of six \nkittens from when they were about 2 weeks old, and they would sleep on my \nbed at night, EVERY night, and be totally comfortable with new people. They \nsee you as their mother, as you're the one who is feeding them milk, and so \nanother human who looks like you is not scary to them. They get used to the \nsounds and scent of humans from such an early age that new people/kids \ndon't scare them at all.  So while I'm sure you have an amazing cat, hand \nraising her is a huge factor that allows cats to see humans as themselves. \nAlso, good job raising a kitten from 2 weeks old, I know from experience \nhow difficult it is! Waking up at night to feed them every 4 hours is not \nalways fun haha, I'm glad it worked out well for you. ",

Best thing to do when a cat won't leave you \nalone is check all of the following Their food bowl, that they have fresh \nclean water, a clean litterbox and check if they're hyper by grabbing a toy \nand playing with them for a minute. If everything checks out and she's not \nhyper, it could be that she's feeling insecure or hasn't had enough \nattention. give her a good petting or scratching whatever she likes for \nabout 5 minutes (which isn't too much time to take out from going to bed) \nshe'll feel like you've acknowledged her request and should settle down or \ngo find something else to do.

I read \nsomewhere that we generate electricity, so when we pet them too much, it \nshocks them, so I don't pet her too much, rather I talk sweet to her at a \ndistance, I tell she likes it, because she wags her tail lazily.

                "text": "I love this! We rescued 85 cats and 7 dogs (not all at once) and found \nhomes for all of them except the ones who were most damaged by people. We \nkept them till they grew old and passed away. I can speak 37 dialects of \nfelinese and though I have no clue what I said to them (hopefully nothing \nobscene) but they all responded. Frankly, I think the cats enjoyed me \nmaking an idiot out of myself more that they liked me \"talking\" to them! It \nworked every time and the feral cats we rehabed responded like magic \nbecoming very loving in an amazingly short time. Yes, to get close to them \nwe did have to do the whole blink things and stuff but it all worked! \nThat's over 20 years of experience in cat rescue. All our fur kids were \ntested, vaccinated, treated for what ever and altered before they were \nreleased to a new home. We charged a small adoption fee; not to make money \nbecause you never re-coup the $ you spend on them. You do it for the best \nof the cat and the fee is to discourage people from collecting animals for \nresearch (evil) facilities. We had a contract for them to sign and made 3 \nhome visits. We only had to reclaim one cat who then stayed with us \npermanently. We offered a 2nd chance for adoption if a cat was reclaimed \nbut that cat had separation anxiety so we kept him. It was so hard to let \ngo of any of them go but to know they had a loving furever home was worth \nit all! We often got pictures over the years of the cats which was very \nrewarding. A lot of the holiday cards we get are signed with paw prints and \nthe name translation next to them. Helping an animal from an utter \ndestitute life and terrible fear, hunger, lack of shelter and suffering of \nall kinds, is one of the best feelings in the world!\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\ude38\ufeff",
