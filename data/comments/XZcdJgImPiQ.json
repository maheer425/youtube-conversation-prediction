And do you expect people to always get things right? Are you never \nwrong about anything? There's a difference between being wrong on one \nBreivik's story and being wrong most of times on a wide variety of \nsubjects. There is also a difference between an honest mistake leading to a \nflawed anaysis and deliberately spreading wrong information in order to \nfurther an agenda. And there's also a difference between doing that once \nand doing it systematically.\n\nAlso people don't just form opinions by looking at the facts. Most people \nhave already made up their mind before the facts are even presented to \nthem. Others are influenced by other people's opinion, and that's not being \nweak minded, it's insightful to hear people's points of view and \nperspectives on the world and to use their analysis to shape own's view of \nthe world.\n\nFinally, you naively seem to think that there is such think as \"the facts\". \nThere is no such thing. What you have is perception of the facts. By \ndefinition, no one can see facts from an objective viewpoint, it's \nimpossible, you see them through your own eyes, your own educational bias, \nyour own environment, your own political leanings. When something complex \nhappens, different people will see different things. That's why objectively \nspeaking, in a complex world, there is no such thing as the facts, only \nopinion about what the facts are.",

The social democratic system is a decent compromise \nand works best for now. In the long-term, we will need to develop an \nentirely new economic system - one in which all manual labor from \nagriculture to manufacturing to services is entirely automated, so the \nquaternary sector can flourish. Space colonization will also be necessary \nto provide infinite land and resources, thus eradicating poverty and most \nconflict. Trans-humanism can also empower mankind further by drastically \nincreasing longevity and living standards.\n\nIn this world we won't need money - everything will simply be made for us. \nWe will focus on doing what we enjoy rather than what we're forced to do to \npay the bills - we can study, do scientific research, invent new machines \nand achieve other feats of engineering, write books, music and poetry, \ncreate films and games, focus on politics, teaching, history, law, media, \nmedicine or just raising a family, recreating and exploring nature in a \ncare-free world. Obviously this world is still far off, by we're in the \nearly stages as we've seen from industry becoming increasingly automated, \nspace colonization being more frequently talked about and technology being \nincreasingly integrated with our bodies. Once the groundwork is laid there \nwill be exponential growth.\n\nCurrently a significant proportion of the populations of developed \ncountries study at university, while jobs in manufacturing are lost to \nmachines. A new economic system is needed to address this, and it seems the \nquaternary sector is all we'll have left to do in an automated world. We \nwill work with our brains rather than our hands. But this is a good thing - \nfinally work will be about what we enjoy rather than what we're forced to \ndo by our circumstances, and we'll be unleashing our true potential. The \nbrain is what makes a human such a special creature and it's an incredibly \npowerful organ. That is what we should be dedicating our time and energy to \n- not menial tasks that machines can do for us.",

Russia is \ncorrupt, the UK is corrupt, America is corrupt... but at least Putin can \nsay he brought prosperity, law, and order to Russia in his nation's darkest \nhour.\n\nPre-Putin... Boris \"drunk at the wheel\" Yeltsin can barely even make a \nspeech while his beloved Oligarchs funneled all of the natural wealth out \nof Russia.

The \n1990's were an absolute nightmare for the Russian people.\n\nNot enough people truly understand how bad things were in the 90's Russian \n\"Mafia State\".  If they did, they'd have a better understanding why Putin \nis still rather popular and well-respected among the ordinary Russian \ncitizen.\n\nEnter Putin... the Oligarchs actually helped him into power (nobody could \nget political power without the help of the billionaire Oligarchs), \nparticularly Boris Berezhovsky.  They liked his strong-man image and he was \ntheir pick to succeed an ailing Yeltsin.\n\nThey were gravely mistaken in thinking that he could be easily bribed or \nthat Putin's Russia would be run by the same Oligarchs that bought up all \nof Russia's major industry for pennies on the dollar.  Within a couple \nyears, it was clear that Putin was going to betray the same king-makers \nthat put him into power.  Rarely can betrayal be seen as a positive thing, \nbut it can in this instance.\n\nMost of the Oligarchs either fled the country or were imprisoned for their \ncrimes.\n\nRussia under Putin has seen an economic revival the likes of which no \nRussian citizen living today can even compare to.  He has made Russia \nrelevant again... not just a broke-ass country with no geopolitical power.\n\nYes, Russia has gradually begun to have problems with corruption.

Just ask James Trafficant how \nquickly they can get rid of anyone who doesn't \"tow the Republicrat line\".\n\nYou also underestimate the extent to which living standards have improved \nunder Putin.  He has the Russian birth-rate now moving in a positive \ndirection (they are around normal replacement levels of fertility whereas \nRussians were systematically dying off like the Japanese are today), he \nmodernized the Russian military, and implemented economic reforms that \nworked very well.  And it did not take very long for these noticeable \nimprovements to transpire.\n\n*He had some luck (like Ergodan, as you mention)... but he also played his \ncards right.  It's hard to deny that the man is a strong, natural leader.  \nAnd if Russians prefer nostalgic celebrations of their shared culture and a \nmore autocratic version of \"democracy\", so what??  That is THEIR \nprerogative. Who on Earth has the right to dictate to the Russian people \nwhat leaders they can or cannot approve of??*\n\nRegarding Russia ALWAYS being powerful... that is untrue.  Sure they always \nhad nuclear warheads since the late 1940's... but the army as in a decrepit \nstate during the late 80's through the 90's and into the new millennium \nbefore Putin made a concerted effort at modernization.\n\nDo you really think Yeltsin's Russia had the power or geopolitical clout to \nalmost single-handedly prevent and block the planned deployment of US \nsoldiers to fight alongside Al-Qaida/Al-Nusra, as Washington again tried to \nplay king-maker getting involved in the Syrian Civil War??\n\nYeltsin was a drunken lackey.  He licked Clinton's boots and did whatever \nthe US told him to... part of the reason Russia was in such a sorry state \nof affairs in the 1990's.  Yeltsin was a weak leader who let the Oligarchs \nrule the broken nation with virtual impunity... the Oligarchs had more \npower than Yeltsin himself during Boris' second term.\n\nThere is no way in hell the US takes a Russian veto on the UN security \ncouncil seriously under Yeltsin's Russia. America would simply ignore UN \nobjections and do whatever they feel like; just as they did in Serbia. \nPutin's Russia is a Russia that emphatically rejects the prior shame of \nbeing the world's largest doormat.\n\n*Of course, the US would prefer Russia be ruled by a Boris Yeltsin type.  \nPutin's biggest crime was providing the geopolitical counter-balance that \nceased to exist with the fall of the Soviet Union.  Putin is the main world \nfigure forcing US foreign policy-makers to keep things honest (at least to \nsome degree).*\n\nIt's worth repeating, the level of corruption in the EU/UK/US is far higher \nthan you think.  The 1% control almost everything... and any improvements \nin the economy (they are few and far between) mostly benefit that 1%.\n\n*Oh, and in Russia there is not a multi-billiion dollar gravy train of \nendless war profits -- dependent on an extremely lucrative war machine \n(military-industrial complex) -- and a constant state of aggression and \noccupation.*\n\n*Russia is not exporting violence and war, and is not profiting from such \nan unethical foreign policy, the way the US has been for the past decade.  \nWhen Putin starts acting like somebody gave him a \"World Police Badge\"... i \nwill criticize him for it.*\n\nBut as of now... Putin is not involving Russia in conflicts thousands and \nthousands of miles away from the nation's borders.  The same cannot be said \nfor some Western powers; who are forcefully trying to shape the world as \nthey see fit.\n\nI'll leave it at that.  Putin is no saint, and he definitely has autocratic \ntendencies, but since Russians haven't forgotten how terrible their \nnational leadership was before Putin -- and how much worse off the entire \npopulation was before the Putin era -- they still generally regard him \nhighly, or at least tolerate him.\n\nIf Russians do not want US-style \"democracy\", why should anybody force it \non them??  It is up to Russians to decide their own fate, not the leaders \nof any foreign nation.",

Russia was always great and probably \nalways will be by the very nature of what it is. It is not difficult to \nmake a country one of the most powerful in the world when it is Russia. But \nwith the rising trend of emerging economies and $100/barrel oil, Russia \nought to be doing a lot better. And Putin arrived just at the time when \nlarge emerging economies were taking off (the 2000s). The same can be \napplied to Erdogan in Turkey, he's not solely responsible for the relative \ngood health of the Turkish economy. The last decade almost completely \nbelonged to economies of that type, namely BRICs and MINTs (China, Brazil, \nIndia, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey).\n\nCorruption exists in every country? Are you seriously saying the level of \ncorruption in Russia is similar to that of the US or western Europe? If \nthat's the case, you should get your head examined.\n\nComparing approval ratings across the world is a ridiculous exercise \nbecause the political culture and reality is different from one country to \nthe next. And attitudes towards government couldn't be different in Russia \nand in the US: Russians love strong autocratic leaders, they bring order \nand flatter the populace with romantic nationalism. In the US, approval \nratings are generally determined by the state of the economy. I heard that \npopularity ratings comparison nonesense in a debate just yesterday: This \nmoron claimed that Yanukovitch had approval ratings that were nearly double \nthat of Francois Hollande, President of France (19%). Yeah that's because \nYanukovitch was a very polarising figure who had a large core of die hard \nsupporters while half of his country hated him to the point that they were \nwilling to die to get rid of him.

Putin inherited a lawless mafia state with \nBoris \"drunk at the wheel\" Yeltsin letting transnational oligarchs funnel \nthe natural wealth out of Russia.  Ask any Russian... the 1990's were an \nabsolute nightmare.\n\nThe entire reason the oligarchs groomed Putin as their next doormat (big \nmistake, as Putin was just biding his time to rid Russia of these \nscoundrels) is because he won over their trust, and he projected a strong \nimage.  Especially compared to Yeltsin, who was completely blacked out for \nmost of his second term.  Putin was young, active, has a black-belt in \njudo, etc. etc.\n\nPutin was the face they needed because things had gotten so bad in Russia \nthat the Communist Part was actually beginning to make headway in the late \n90's.  Even after former Soviet states repudiated Communism just several \nyears prior. They helped Putin become a household name... but Putin later \nturned on them because he was aware that his country was being raped of its \nnatural wealth.\n\nKeep in mind, the \"kingmaker\" oligarchs i speak of bought entire \nformer-Soviet industries for *pennies on the dollar* and made enormous \nfortunes.  The price they paid was far, far less than the actual worth of \nthe Russian industries that were privatized in the early 90's.\n\n*Putin inherited an absolute MESS!!!*. Russians have not forgotten the \nmisery of the Yeltsin years, and so they cut Putin some slack with some of \nhis autocratic tendencies... they'll take that.  Russian living standards \nare much, much higher than they ever were during the Communist Stagnancy \nand the chaotic Yeltsin \"shock treatment\" years.\n\nOF COURSE there is corruption in Russia.  *There is corruption in every \nnation on Earth;* but Putin brought the level of corruption from \nout-of-control to just regular corruption.\n\nAnd that is, in part, the reason why he enjoys relatively high approval \nratings... higher than Obama or Bush enjoyed in the US.  Putin is more \npopular internationally too, because he is not seen as the root cause of \nall the wars that the US \"World Police Task Force\" has undertaken.",
