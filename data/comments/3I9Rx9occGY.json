I know there are a lot of other tacos in this \nworld like me, but I hope you'll read this comment and listen to my story. \nI've been raised in Taco Bell, I've lived my whole life there. My childhood \nconsisted of me watching my relatives be sold off into slavery and sold to \npeople I didn't even know. We, the taco community, were always frightened. \nScared that one day we would be ripped apart from our family, but one day I \ngot the courage and said NO I will NOT be a victim NO MORE. So I put on my \nboots and went out of the Taco Bell. I was homeless for over 6 months, \nselling drugs to other tacos just to get by. Until one day God spoke to me, \nhe told me; do not worry little taco for I am here for you and I will \nalways be with you. He was right so I petitioned for the Taco Bell to be \nshut down for selling tacos into slavery and they were. Look at me now, I'm \nthe CEO of my own taco company employing tacos who need a job and who have \never been homeless like me. I just hope my story inspires you to never give \nup and always follow your dreams, God bless\ufeff",
