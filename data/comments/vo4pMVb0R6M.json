It's \nlike deriving a word from the word 'dyke' (in the literal sense, that is) \n(even though I don't know what kind of word that would be) and then saying \nit comes from the English word, even though that's an 'Englishation', or \nsomething along those lines, of the Dutch word 'dijk'. It's still derived \nfrom Dutch then, not from English. \nThat was a really odd way to put it, but I hope you understand my point :P",

But, If you do not mind I would \nlike to put a plea on behalf of the people of my kind, many people like me \ndo not use English as their mother-tongue rather they use it only in their \nacademics and they have almost no direct exposure to native english \nspeakers like you, as a result they find it hard to understand their accent \nand understand them. I feel bit hard to understand you completely. Would \nyou please be considerate by adding the subtitles to the psychology videos \nstarting with this. Please be considerate to us.

After the student obtains this 'degree' he can pray, cry and \ntry to access to the specialization (Psychiatry in this case). In the first \n5-6 years of Medicine there is almost no training in psychological \ndisciplines (naturally). However, when there is psychological training It \nconcerns \"only\" about therapy/clinical psychology (or Psychodinamics, more \noften) and Psychoneuroendocrinology. Certainly a physician/ a psychiatrist \nwould not be formed in the wide range of psychological fields. However, my \npoint was that alot of psychiatrics here are only superficially formed even \nin that 'unique' psychology field, and they often prefer to use only drugs \neven if they have been theorically trained to practice psychotherapy \n(however notice that Psychotherapy is only an application of psychological \nknowledge and sciences, there's a big difference - what I'm saying is that \nwho is trained in psychotherapy does not have necessarly a 'psychological \nknowledge' speaking in the \"western meaning\" of the term).\nI do not know, certainly, what is the situation elsewhere.\nOf course It is a 'delicate' matter. If it was up to me I would totally \nchange the \"Educational Offerings\"/ training necessary for clinical \npsychologists and psychiatrists in order to 'unify' both of them (I'm \nreferring to the Italian training). The students would fatigue like asses, \nbut It could be useful for everyone and It would be harder and more \nselective (as any training should be).

Actually, It could be really helpful if the practitioner \nhad a very good education both in psychology and in medicine, and It could \nbe helpful even If it is not 'perfect' (after all, clinicians and \ntherapists need to acquire both qualitative and quantitative data, this \nbook/manual should be considered only as a reference) but men, as always, \neasily ruin the thing. However Psychology is not a Mental Health field. Or \nbetter: It is when we talk about, lets say, Clinical Psy, \nSchool/Educational Psy, Military Psy, and in a sort of way Organizational \nPsy.\nBut all Psychology fields are born as research and application fields from \nPhilosophy (like every science), from Medicine, Biology, Neuroscience, \nEngineering. Historically speaking, the 'health' aspect of Psychology was \nborn later respect to the Psychophisics. I'm saying this because Its \npourpose is to study cognition, behavior, emotions et ecetera\nnot necessarly to promote 'health' treatment and promotion in private \noffices.\nOf course I understand that human and oter species' mind are really complex \nin a lot of the 'dimensions' we could consider It. But that's what it makes \nit fascinating and that leads us to improve techniques, tools, methodology \nintroducing/using other fields such as (as you are saying) computation (in \nfact here we talk about cognitive psychology).\n\nCertainly I'm all in too for scientific approach when and where is needed. \nAnd, yes, you are probably right: robotics, AI, compitational simulations \net cetera even if they are still very young fields, can be easily \nconsidered as some of the most important and promising fields, today, \nnecessary for the development of psychology and cognitive sciences (and, \nluckily, it seems to me that many psychologists worldwide are interested in \nthese fields [not in Italy, here almost all of the students are interested \nin Clinical Psy - nothing bad about It, but the number of Clinical students \nis outstanding, especially compared to the number of Neuropsychologists, \nErgonomists, Cognitive Neuroscientists, and people involved in Robotics, AI \nand similar fields]). Despite that, I think and it seems to me that the \n'scientifical' fields of Psychology are grasping and reaching an important \nquantity and quality of knoweldge experimentally substantial and \n'efficient'. \nMy desire too is to study and work firstly in the fields of Psychobiology \nand in/with Neural Networks too (we could call It, i think, computational \nneuroscience). But here in Italy my chances after taking my degree are \nquite low cause here there aren't many opportuinites for wannabe \nresearchers. Que sera sera.\nHowever, don't be upset: Psychoanalisis can be fascinating, if it stayis \nwhere it belongs, but today I think there is no serious psychologist who \ngives credit to psychoanalisis (maybe some students, or therapists, and \npsychiatrists). But I'm afraid that Transpersonal psychologists (even if I \nwould prefer to not call them this way) will forever exists. It can be \nreally fascinating as long as it is seen as some kind of 'art' and, in a \ncertain way, as a dimension of 'investigation' of spirituality (in these \nterms, I could say that I like the ancient alchemy, for example[as a \nprofane], but only when humans let It stay where It belongs, turning It \ninto trash).\n\nHowever i can see what you are saying, I think. There are alot of buffoons \n(is this the word?) who try to get benefit by the confusing field of \nPsychology. And this is Psychologists fault: there is not a very large and \nstrict control about pop-psychology.

In fact a lot of \npsychiatrics are formed around psychodinamics principles. Moreover we could \ntalk about Psychodinamics and Humanistic Psychology, but as I said they are \n'acquaintances'. I didn't say that they do not belong to the field of \nPsychology: in a simple way they are not born from experimental psychology, \npsychophisics, biological psychology, social psychology et cetera but they \nare born from the field of Psychoanalisis. So we could say that they are a \nsort of a 'strange' approach to the field of Psychology, but I think that's \nnot correct (more or less technically speaking) including them in a total \nway.\nLast but not least (what a shitty statement) as I said transpersonal \npsychology cannot be considered as a branch of Modern Psychology and \nExperimental Psychology in the Western World. In fact, if we want to speak \nin a very general way, we could say that Psychology exists by a long, long \ntime, expecially in the Eastern Culture: but It did only in philosophical \nand introspective terms. This kind of 'doctrine' has nothing to do with \nwhat we call Scientific Psychology. Of course, it studies the 'mind', the \naltered states of consciousness and so on, but It doesn't use any of the \nscientific 'tools' or requirements and methods (speaking in rigorous \nterms). Moreover, as I said, it's probably 'just' a therapeutic practice, \nand therapy hasn't got much to do with Modern Psychology (we have to \nrecognize that it depends on 'her', but not always and not necessarly in \nrigorous terms).",

The text in brackets is not \nactually from the book, but speculations from me.\n\nIt says there that Wundt tried to find the smallest elements of the human \nconciousness. [Since he tried to conduct psychology as a natural science, \nhe probably thought that complex mental processes can be broken down to \nmany tiny, undevidable processes similar to how in physics and chemistry we \ncan break down everything to an atomic and molecular level.] Thitchener \nthen went on to found structuralism, but Wundt wasn't part of that \nmovement. So Wundt's and Thitchener's motivation was the same (they both \ntried to break down human thought into smaller elements), but the methods \nthey used were vastly different. [Wundt, as far as I know, only used \nobjective measures such as reaction time.]\n\nIf I remember correctly, Wundt was strongly opposed to introspection. So \nmuch so that he started a scientific debate either with one of his former \nstudents or Freud on that very same topic.",

I can't remember \nwhat that means.\n\nIt's true that he proposed an introspective psychology and was interested \nin consciousness and mental activity but he also acknowledged that \nintrospection was unreliable, which led to him using objective measures \nlike galvanic skin response and reaction times.

I see that it won't be convenient to say it comes from \nthe Latin that borrowed the Greek blah blah. But if you are speaking about \nthe origin of a word, then speak about the origin. :-)\n\nAgain I am not saying this as a Greek Language fanboy here... The mistake \njust jumps out to me because I know the language. I always find it \ninteresting to know where things come from.\n\nLogos in Greek can mean a few things actually. Speach is the primary \nmeaning. In this case, if you say \"This person is a psychologist\" it means \nthis person speaks about the psyche, as in he researches the psyche, he \nstudies it and is well able to speak about it. Logos also means reason, and \ncongnitive thought. Psychologia is the science,research of the things of \nthe soul. A \"Logios\", for example, is a person who has great experience \nwith the written word.\n\nThanks for the chat.",

It \nis just that when you go to the trouble of refering to the origins of a \nword I suppose it is best to give the truest deffinition. See for me, being \nGreek it is obvious where it's origin is, and it isn't Latin. Latinised \nGreek? Ok sure. This is why in my initial post I say \"I hate doing this\" \nbecause I am not obssesed with all things Greek (and hate it when people \nare that way) but rather fond of getting as close to the truth as I can.\nI think of it like this: It's like describing a load carrying collumn in a \nskyscrapper and you say: This collumn starts on the second floor (latin) \nwhen it is actually planted on the foundation (greek). It passes through \nthe second floor but it doesn't come from it.\nSo you would say that the english word miserable comes from the french word \nmiserable or the latin miserabilis? I would go straight to the Latin for \nexample.",

As \nit's been latinised, the form is to say it is 'from the latin' -same as \nfrench words which have the form in latin are called 'from the french word \n*_*' Another way of thinking of it, is that Greek as a language evolved \nfrom another language (I honestly don't know what, but surely someone does) \n-but no one credits that language as the root of greek words...",

The questions asked at \n1:36 can easily be answered by somebody who knows the basic workings of the \nmind... For example humans commit genocide for a number of (specific) \nreasons but it these boil down to the mind (due its lack of wisdom) giving \nrise to the unwholesome qualities of greed, hatred, and delusion. These \nthings arise due to the mind's ignorance of the truth of reality: all \nthings are changing, suffering arises when we attach to things, and \neverything is empty of self or inherent existence (because everything is \nconditioned by causes). Ignorance also translates to us not seeing the harm \nwhich is inherent in unwholesome actions. If we want to stop behaving \nbadly, we should start reflecting on our actions and contemplating the \npleasant and unpleasant results of engaging in them \u2014 that's wisdom, the \npure awareness which lies in the heart of all of us and (for the ignorant) \nis obscured like the moon behind clouds. Unconscious mental phenomena are \nsimply that: unconscious. In layman's terms, we're just unaware of these \nmental phenomena. But the Buddha and all of his disciples were able to \ntrain the mind to be mindful of mental phenomena \u2014 which is proof that \nthese phenomena are totally observable in the here and now, which means \nthat anybody can do it if they just start dedicating themselves to knowing \nthings as they are.\ufeff",

That\u2019s why I felt the need to check, I\u2019m \nnot one for out-and-out offensive contention as there is nothing to be \ngained from it but I do like to be clear on what is being discussed. \n\nAnyway, I agree that analysis of cognitive processes and how we react to \nenvironmental stimuli is a healthy practice for those wanting to make \nchanges to their deterministic tendencies. It is the kind of introspection \nthat inevitably accrues wisdom if the data acquired is put to good use. \nAnalysis of how we react in flux with our past experiences and current \nenvironment does shine a light on certain methods that we can practice that \ncould help us to make the changes that we need. Then if it doesn\u2019t work \nthen we ask why, look at the variables and try something more appropriate \nas suggested by the information that we obtain from that analysis. \nFalsifiable testing. Psychology.\n\nNow obviously I am philosophically biased in some respects being a \nmaterialist and do not agree with all of it's principles, but Buddhism has \nalways been different to me. I don\u2019t know a great deal about Buddhism, but \nI think that it is more of an ancient science decorated with stories as \nopposed to what is commonly regarded as a religion or faith system. As I \nunderstand it does not demand faith from followers or an acceptance of \ncreationist theories, it merely encourages the practice of the \nintrospective methods that encourage consideration, empathy and wisdom. \n\nWhat is understood as causal determinism and social behaviour coupled with \nprobability and a few other bits and pieces is definitively similar to the \nfocus of karma.\n\nSo yeah, why not the Buddha? I agree that there are some very valuable, \nbeneficial points that can be extracted from the teachings. I can only \nassume that certain schools of thought are over-looked due to their \nreligious connotations. ",

When it comes to rebirth, that's something which, \nwithout a good understanding of Buddhist ideas, is difficult to understand. \nBut look at it this way: what keeps you going in life? There's a desire to \nbecome something, an attachment to experience (whether you notice it or \nnot; it's subtle), and mental intentions (karma). When the body dies and \nthese things are still present (due to ignorance and attachment), the \nconsciousness just keeps going. Is that really true? I don't know for sure, \nbut right now I'm just taking it on faith. (2) The 5 precepts are used as \nrestraints to prevent the practitioner from indulging in explicitly \nunwholesome actions. The 6th-10th precepts are more ascetic in nature. For \nthe precept about luxurious beds and seats, that has to do with not \nindulging or developing a sense of pride over where you sit or sleep. For \nthe precept on money, that has to do with preventing attachment to wealth.\n\nMadame, you can find many resources on accesstoinsight.org.

The \nquestion is which do you believe: God or Man.\"\n\nI will have to, for the most part, disagree with your assertions. I know it \nmeans a literal 24 hours, still doesn't mean the days came consecutively. \nNothing in the Bible says this, it never says \"and the day right after the \nfirst\" or anything like that, but merely Day Two or so, indicating some \nimportant day. I can just as easily say a day of a week thats somehow \nchronologically important, call it day [insert number here], and it does \nnot mean that it came in a chronological, week-long order. They could have \nbeen separated by wide gaps and, if they are 24 hours consecutive for every \nday, then its impossible to see the Earth being shaped into formation. \nNothing in the Bible suggests a Young Earth, merely people's \ninterpretations of various things in it. Even a part of Psalm's calls \nEarth's foundation old.\n\n\"Charles Darwin actually was trying to find a way to explain the complexity \nof life without God.\"\n\nWrong. Charles Darwin was a very devout Christian who was actually \nsurprised by his findings, worried that they challenged thousand-year-old \ntraditions that were held as fact. He merely felt like his discoveries had \npointed to the \"how\" God created all life, not the why.\n\n\"Variation is fine. There are numerous variations of dogs cats, humans, etc.\nEvolution just tries to take that a step further and say that each of these \nkinds are related. They are not. God created all life according to its \nkind. No two kinds of life evolved from any other kind.\n\nDarwin's finches are a great example.\nThere are many variations of finches, but that proves nothing regarding \nfinches changing into something new or coming from something else.\"\n\nEvolution doesn't try to say that \"something new\" is created, it tries to \nsay that variations are created over long periods of time due to \nadaptations to new environments, new genes, etc. It is stated that over a \nton of time, a species of two animals can be separated so far beyond their \nancestors that they can no longer mate together, thus making them \neffectively entirely different species. This is exactly what happened with \nthe horse and donkey, I believe, to which they can only mate to produce an \noffspring that can't even produce its own offspring due to the genetic \ndeficiencies between its two parents having mated in the first place.\n\n\"God gave life some capacity to vary\nBut, nothing new can come out of that variation. A dog can change as much \nas you like, but it can never change into a dog with wings, simple because \nthe genes for wings aren't there.\"\n\nAny animal can change so much to the point of not being able to produce \noffspring with its ancestors. Evolution hasn't tried to say that gorillas \njust magically poofed into humans, which I think is what you're thinking.\n\n\"Millions of years- There is plenty of evidence against millions of years.\nA large portion of the \"evidence\" for an old Earth is radiometric dating \ntechniques.\nThese rely of three assumptions that either can't be truly verified or are \nproven false.

Of course, the Evolutionists \ndon't like that because that alone makes Evolution impossible. There are \nmany other reasons why Evolution is wrong, but that's one of them.\"\n\nAnd radiometric dating methods are actually the only dating methods able to \nproduce systematically similar results without much flaw in them. Other \ndating method results are either total failures or can only be used on \ncertain things, like living organisms. Also, even so, the Earth is \ndefinitely much older than 6,000 years old. Why? Cause literally every \nancient empire that we have records of go back to just about before 6,000 \nyears old in date, including, for example, the Chinese and Aztecs.\n\n\"Mutations are almost always fatal to an organism.
