Who/where was it ever said otherwise? I haven't \nseen anyone ever claim the entirety of the atheist community was free from \nall negative human elements. We're not saints, that much should be obvious. \nAnyone saying otherwise should be ignored, not argued with. Such inane and \ntrivial arguments only serve to distract from the real topics of discussion.",
