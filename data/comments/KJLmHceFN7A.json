                "text": "So many people on here are addict kids who don't understand what the dad is \ndoing. It's called punishment. The one kid who keeps getting his games \ndestroyed is getting his games destroyed because he's spending his money on \ngames and not car payments or insurance and in one video the dad mentions \nthe kid has been graduated for months and doesn't even have a job and isn't \ntrying to get a job. The brother is exploiting his family for entertainment \nand views which is both morally and ethically wrong. They both live under \ntheir dad's roof, it's the parents' rules of the house, and they keep \nbreaking the house rules. It's punishment. Get over it, it's a fucking \nlaptop and Xbox and video games. Those are replaceable. The man who gave \nyou life, raised you(not always the case), and paid for your stuff as a \nchild(not always the case) has a bit of a say as to what goes and doesn't \nwhen you're still under his roof. Considering both kids are still with \ntheir dad, I'd say he raised them to love him and if he gets angry that his \nsons are not doing anything good or productive with their ADULT lives, then \nhe's very well entitled to that anger. Obviously those two sons have the \nmoney to buy new stuff, so why should he care. He's given them more than \nthey've given him. He has a right.\ufeff",
