                "text": "I have a sister who is 13 years older than me. She has never been a good \npet owner... Some of the last pets she had lately were two female cats. One \ndied due to disease and the other stayed as a single cat.\n\nMy sister then shacked up with a horrible man, and only one of this man's \nmany flaws is the fact that he doesn't like cats. My sisters cat, Teka, was \nthen confined to the kitchen area, on top of the cabinets or on her bed \nunder the table. The family members weren't allowed to touch her because of \nher shedding fur, and she wasn't allowed to even meow at my mom when she \nwent to visit. One thing you should know about Teka: she is the sweetest \ncat EVER. I have never seen her growl, hiss, bite or take a swat at ANYONE, \nno matter how annoyed or threatened she feels.\n\nAround this time of the year, two years ago, my sister wanted to take her \nwhole family away on vacation for a week and asked me to go over and feed \nthe cat. You should know that I have two cats who have been raised in the \ncompany of other cats, so they are fairly social. So I told my sister \"no\". \nI would not go over everyday, on purpose, spending my precious gas, to her \nhouse to feed the cat. Instead, why couldn't the cat have a vacation of her \nown and come here? I was sure there wouldn't be any problems, because I \nknow my cats and I know Teka, and they would get past the weirdness of a \nnew acquaintance in a matter of days. And so it was.\n\nI was home alone for three weeks as my whole family went on vacation, and \nit was up to me to watch the cats (it's my favorite time of the year!!). \nFor the first two or three days there were a few hisses here and there \n(from my cats - Teka didn't hiss or growl, not even once), but then Teka \nand Zita, my youngest, started getting closer. They'd run together \nthroughout the house every morning and play joyfully. I told my mom Teka \nwas having such a good time that she suggested to my sister that Teka could \nstay the rest of the month as an extended vacation - my sister agreed.\n\nTwo weeks passed, and Teka had become inseparable both from me and from \nZita. Teka would sleep with me and follow me everywhere I went, and she and \nZita would run together and play fight everyday, even laying down for a nap \ntogether and grooming each other. She was so much happier now... I told my \nmom this... and she agreed we couldn't send her back to her miserable life \nwith my sister and her companion. So my mom suggested we could take her in \npermanently... and of course my sister didn't put up a fight. She wasn't \nthat attached to Teka, and she and the kids could always come and visit her.\n\nTeka was 6 years old at the time, she is now 8, and she is my baby. She is \nmy shadow, follows me everywhere (even to the bathroom... I can not poop \nunescorted, and I know many of you can relate), sleeps with me, kneads and \ndrools on me. She doesn't do it with my mom... just me. I'm her person. She \nhas a happier expression, a happier and healthier life, and even my other \ncat Zuka, who is much more independent, plays with her sometimes. We have \nnever seen a sweeter cat, and to this day I still have yet to see her \ngrowl, hiss, bite or swat her paw at us for any reason.\ufeff",

We used allot of advice from this channel and from \n\"My cat from hell\" and she has grown from a very shy cat who would hide \nfrom almost everyone to a confident and very cheeky cat who has a lot of \nlove to give. Thank you for your tips Jackson, and I totally recommend \nconsidering adopting an older cat! :D <3\ufeff",

For example, There was this one cat who \nwas adopted as a kitten, and there was a four year old in the home. The \nparents didn't stop the four year old from pulling her tail, ears, and \nwhiskers. When I got there, she hid from me... it was a cramped space \nshared with two other cats. She was barely a year old... I used slow blink \nand she came right to me, started purring, and even playing! She was barely \na year and a half old when I met her. I wish I could have taken Snowball \nhome, but people like you and your family give me hope that she will find a \ngreat home. <3 \n\nPlease do me a favor? After you read my comment, please give Minnie a bit \nof love for me, and have a beautiful, blessed day!",
