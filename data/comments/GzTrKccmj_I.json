Dante wrote about how he wished \nthe emperor could free the peninsula and take back italy to the imperial \ngrllory. France and england and spain were nations since the middle ages, \nGermany had a long history of emperors that tried to unite it.

                    "text": "+RonPaulHatesBlacks Maybe it wasn't the majority, my apologies. I found a \nfew things that might help.\n\nThe view that America's apparently intractable racial problem should be \nsolved by removing blacks from this country and resettling them elsewhere \n-- \"colonization\" or \"repatriation\" -- was not a new one. As early as 1714 \na New Jersey man proposed sending blacks to Africa. In 1777 a Virginia \nlegislature committee, headed by future President Thomas Jefferson (himself \na major slave owner), proposed a plan of gradual emancipation and \nresettlement of the state's slaves. In 1815, an enterprising free black \nfrom Massachusetts named Paul Cuffe transported, at his own expense, 38 \nfree blacks to West Africa. His undertaking showed that at least some free \nblacks were eager to resettle in a country of their own, and suggested what \nmight be possible with public and even government support.7\nIn December 1816, a group of distinguished Americans met in Washington, DC, \nto establish an organization to promote the cause of black resettlement. \nThe \"American Colonization Society\" soon won backing from some of the young \nnation's most prominent citizens. Henry Clay, Francis Scott Key, John \nRandolph, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Bushrod \nWashington, Charles Carroll, Millard Fillmore, John Marshall, Roger B. \nTaney, Andrew Jackson, Daniel Webster, Stephen A. Douglas, and Abraham \nLincoln were members. Clay presided at the group's first meeting.8\nMeasures to resettle blacks in Africa were soon undertaken. Society member \nCharles Fenton Mercer played an important role in getting Congress to pass \nthe Anti-Slave Trading Act of March 1819, which appropriated $100,000 to \ntransport blacks to Africa. In enforcing the Act, Mercer suggested to \nPresident James Monroe that if blacks were simply returned to the coast of \nAfrica and released, they would probably be re-enslaved, and possibly some \nreturned to the United States. Accordingly, and in cooperation with the \nSociety, Monroe sent agents to acquire territory on Africa's West coast -- \na step that led to the founding of the country now known as Liberia. Its \ncapital city was named Monrovia in honor of the American President.9\nWith crucial Society backing, black settlers began arriving from the United \nStates in 1822. While only free blacks were at first brought over, after \n1827, slaves were freed expressly for the purpose of transporting them to \nLiberia. In 1847, black settlers declared Liberia an independent republic, \nwith an American-style flag and constitution.10\nBy 1832 the legislatures of more than a dozen states (at that time there \nwere only 24), had given official approval to the Society, including at \nleast three slave-holding states.11 Indiana's legislature, for example, \npassed the following joint resolution on January 16, 1850:12\nBe it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana: That our \nSenators and Representatives in Congress be, and they are hereby requested, \nin the name of the State of Indiana, to call for a change of national \npolicy on the subject of the African Slave Trade, and that they require a \nsettlement of the coast of Africa with colored men from the United States, \nand procure such changes in our relations with England as will permit us to \ntransport colored men from this country to Africa, with whom to effect said \nsettlement.\nIn January 1858, Missouri Congressman Francis P. Blair, Jr., introduced a \nresolution in the House of Representatives to set up a committee\nto inquire into the expediency of providing for the acquisition of \nterritory either in the Central or South American states, to be colonized \nwith colored persons from the United States who are now free, or who may \nhereafter become free, and who may be willing to settle in such territory \nas a dependency of the United States, with ample guarantees of their \npersonal and political rights.\nBlair, quoting Thomas Jefferson, stated that blacks could never be accepted \nas the equals of whites, and, consequently, urged support for a dual policy \nof emancipation and deportation, similar to Spain's expulsion of the Moors. \nBlair went on to argue that the territory acquired for the purpose would \nalso serve as a bulwark against any further encroachment by England in the \nCentral and South American regions.\n\nhttp://www.ihr.org/jhr/v13/v13n5p-4_Morgan.html\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam002.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society",

Expanding that was \nessential to their preservation. That the Federal Government might - and I \nstress MIGHT - not allow that was abhorrent and terrifying to the Southern \npoliticians and landowners. It was the reason they initiated secession and \neventual hostilities.\n\nAnd I've read quite enough on the subject. As a Carolinian, I am well aware \nthat slavery was NOT dying but in fact surging due to the cotton gin. I \ndon't know why you people think it was in decline and I honestly don't care \nfor that denial but it was booming due to the cotton gin because it created \na huge demand for cotton.\n\nIndustrialization only made PROCESSING cotton faster and more efficient. \nWhat it HADN'T solved was production. Production remained a physical labor \nuntil the 1930s when the first mechanical cotton pickers started to appear. \nWould you like to do the math? 1865, the end of the civil war, to 1930. How \nmany years is that?\n\nAnd to say it wasn't all about slavery, the civil war, is just nonsense. \nIt's denial of the worst kind. It's like saying the Japanese Internment \ncamps were only for the greater good or that we moved the Native Americans \nonto reservations for their betterment. If we don't face the reality that \nbad choices were made, the sins of our past cannot be resolved.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, slavery wasn't just a racial thing; it was as \nmuch about race as it was about economics and politics.\n\nWhile a minority owned the majority of slaves in the south, you have to \nremember these were the rich elite. These are the \"state governments\" that \nyou champion. They were either plantation owners or connected to plantation \nowners. And because a slave was 3/5th a person in terms of \n\"representation\", the south wielded a considerable amount of control in the \nFederal government. Control that it did not rightly deserve due to, you \nknow, slaves not being able to speak up for themselves or vote yet still \ncounting toward congressional seats.\n\nAs for non slave owners, while they may not have owned slaves in the south. \n. they certainly weren't in opposition to the practice. Like I said, being \npassive about it is comparable to supporting it. And there were plenty who \ndid want slaves but couldn't afford it. The idea that a majority didn't \nsupport slavery in the south or wanted no part of it is a myth.",

Slavery really wasn't a huge part of \nSouthern Culture. It was dying out anyway, the only reason that Slaves \nbecame useful again was from the invention of the cotton jin, meaning that \ninferior American Cotton could make a profit again. This would not have \nsurvived for long, India produced superior cotton and Britain was rapidly \nincreasing the amount it produced so the Southern states would have had to \nindustrialize and thus make slaves useless. The idea of a rich country like \nthe CS not industrializing by the year 1900 is laughable.\n\nNow, expanding west is possible  but conquering the North? no.

They would use it \nto their heart's content. They didn't care about State's rights, either, \nthe classic example being the fugitive slave laws which were imposed on the \nNorth THROUGH the centralized government under pressure by the slave states \nand plantation owners. When a few Northern States threatened to nullify, \nsomething that in later years the South claimed they had rights to, the \nSouth threatened a variety of actions including secession and armed \nintervention.\n\nBut, I'll give you that they eventually embraced their hatred of a strong \ncentral government. So much so that it cost them the war. The CSA's \ngovernment was so weak and decentralized that it was difficult to work with \nthe governors and organized any kind of resistance. Their small government \nsimply couldn't oppose a larger, more powerful central government.\n\nAs for putting pressure on the south to abolish slavery? They didn't \nbefore. Why would they after the Civil War? They certainly took their time \nin pressuring countries throughout the world. Like I said, there were \ncountries with legalized slavery up to 2007. Or where slavery wasn't a \ncrime. There's no guarantee that Europe would've abruptly strode in to \napply that pressure. The only pressure that came was simply not to \nrecognize the CSA in favor of the North. And while that was partly \nmotivated by the issue of slavery, it was also because the North had \nsomething Europe wanted and the South didn't (anymore). England found \nalternate sources of cotton but what it didn't find were supplies of food \nstuffs which the North could readily provide.\n\nAs for Jeff Davis, I disagree wholeheartedly. He simply wasn't up to the \njob of that position. He was a good Secretary of War but as a president he \nwas a failure and a strategic flop. He also ignored one important group - \nthe common people. Yes, he spoke to soldiers and politicians but that \nwasn't enough and they did not take well to his apparent favoritism of the \nrich and powerful elite. Confederate nationalism was there, true, but he \ndid a poor job of harnessing it.\n\nAnd one of the biggest ironies yet is that of the confederate efforts to \nintervene economically. To regulate and to control manpower through the \nstate. They did everything they basically said they were opposing. \nUltimately the Confederacy was more intrusive than the Union. Hell, they \neven had the draft first.\n\nSo there's no telling what would've happened if the CSA won. The US \ncould've probably broken up into smaller nations which were ultimately weak \nby themselves and left weak or absorbed by other powers.\n\nLet me give you an example. There's a fringe group, relatively small, who \nwant Texas to secede. And they know if Texas did, that it could thrive \nsince it has the population and the resources and the economy, The problem \ncomes from the belief that Texas would somehow secede intact and not, say, \nend up like the Virginias. Remember that 41% of the voters went for Obama \nin 2012. Over 3 million. Texas could very well be broken up at which point \nit wouldn't have that unified infrastructure, strong economy, and large \npopulation it needed to survive on its own. But that will never happen \nbecause the idea that Texas can secede is a myth. There is nothing in the \nconstitution that gives it that exceptional power.",

All the \"States' Rights\" stuff didn't \ncome from nowhere.\n\nAlso, I would argue that Jefferson Davis, as would anyone in his position \ncould really do much to unify the Southern States so quickly.\nThe Nation was founded upon the sense that a strong American Nation would \ncome from the co-operation of the free and equally powerful States. He \nobviously needed to win the war, which called for a lot of centralized \npower obviously when the birth of your nation and the entirety of its life \nwas in the fires of war. So this is why he wasn't really trusted by the \nbureaucrats of the Southern states, who thought they had declared this war \nto fight a large centralized government. The people of the C.S.A were \nfighting for their independence and I believe that was a powerful unifying \nforce that Jefferson Davis did encourage.\n\nAlso to say what would have happened if the South won the war, you must \nspecify how. Now I'm sure you'll agree that foreign intervention would have \nbeen required, the UK, France and Mexico being the most likely. All of whom \nI believe would have put significant pressure on the victorious C.S.A to \nabolish slavery. That combined with the certain rapid Industrialization of \nthe South, (to compensate for the loss of the Northern Industry) would have \nmeant slavery ended closer to 1900.\n\nAs far as the U.S goes I think they still would have been a superpower. \nTheir entry into the First World War would still have turned the U.S into a \nforeign power and international force. They would just be a bit less so \nthan in our timeline. As opposed to the C.S who would most likely have \nremained isolationist, despite being dragged into the wars due to \nestablished alliances from their war for independence.\n\nAlso it's impossible to guess what domestic technological progress would \nhave been changed. So I won't bother arguing that suilly point with you. \nSince it's just as likely that we would be more technologically advanced. \nTheir is no basis for an argument either way, unfortunately.",

                "text": "Here's another one.  The war indirectly led to our acquisition of Alaska.  \nDuring the war, the Union navy was occupied with blockading the Southern \nports, which left the Eastern coast open to potential attack by Britain.  \nSo the Union sought aid from an unlikely source: Tsar Alexander II (who was \nan admirer of Lincoln, by the way).  So Alexander sent the imperial Russian \nnavy to safeguard the U.S. coast.  But when the war was over, the Tsar \nwanted to be reimbursed for the cost.  But it would not have gone over well \nwith the public to learn that the Union, presumably fighting for such \nthings as freedom and democracy, was being assisted by the supreme \nautocrat, \"Tsar of All the Russias.\"  So a deal was worked out.  Russia \npossessed Alaska.  It was a financial drain, and they wanted to get rid of \nit.  So we bought it, in 1867.  The deal was named \"Seward's Folly,\" after \nthe Secretary of State.  Of course, 25 years later, gold was discovered in \nAlaska, and I'm sure the Russians were kicking themselves for having given \nit up.  This comes from, \"The Unseen Hand,\" by Ralph Epperson.\ufeff",
