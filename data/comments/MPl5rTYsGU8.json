I totally bawled my little \nhead off, way scared of the big scary monster maybe gonna eat me or \nsomething horrible.  But one or more of my family members (can't remember \nall that exactly now, sadly) told me in some way that I didn't really need \nto be frightened, telling me all about the difference between TV & movies \nand real life, that real life is one thing but TV & movies are \nmake-believe--they're not real, ya know, even if they look and sound real, \nit's not really happening and can't really hurt me or anything even if I'm \nwatching.\n\nFrom that moment on, I've totally understood the difference between like \nHollywood, etc. and Reality very, very well.  It's a lesson we all learn \n(heh, well most of us do! **shakes head**) usually when we are very young.\n\nSo hence, aside from whatever family members that told me, I have Godzilla \nto thank for that important early life lesson.\n\nOf course right after that, I sure instead enjoyed *Godzilla* movies a \nwhole lot more then LOL excellent!  GO, GO GODZILLA!  He rules LOL hehehe",

But it's only \"boring\" if you're an adrenaline-junkie with the \nattention-span of a gnat and think that you really need explosive Michael \nBay-like stimulation from a movie like every damn second.\n\nWhile I don't disagree that more screentime for the King of the Monsters \nhimself, at least, probably wouldn't have hurt the film, in *any* case, \nwhatever problem is alleged to be, it's not because of the \"boring\" dialog \nof grown-ups, not in the case of this film it's not, not anymore than it's \na problem when you watch the 1954 original.
