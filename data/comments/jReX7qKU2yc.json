I have made few analogies that fit so \nperfectly for a claim so difficult to support.\n\n\"can you not imagine that science is rediscovering and renaming these \nphenomenon that ancient Israelites labelled as gods and elohim (think of \nthe fundamental forces)\" When Theists do not understand a particular \nphenomenon they say God did it, when Atheists do not understand it they say \nit is fundamental. This does not mean God does not exist just as it does \nnot mean there is nothing fundamental. It is also the composition fallacy \nto think that since there are things that were first thought to be miracles \nthat are now known not to be, that therefore all things are not miracles. I \ndo not think the discovery of laws rules out God, rather that it suggests \ningenious order. When I was fourteen I asked myself \"Why did God create the \nuniverse over seven days? Surely he could have done it instantaneously\" At \nthat time I played a game called minecraft where you can go mining and then \nusing that stone to build stuff. On it, I built a castle that required \n50,000 stone and took two weeks to build (I spent all day on it) and once I \nhad finished it was very rewarding. A few months later they released \ncreative mode, a mode that gave you an infinite amount of stone and other \nresources. However when I created buildings on it, It was not rewarding as \nit became too easy and I chose to use the other mode instead. From this I \nrealized that this was why God didn't create the universe instantaneously, \nhe chose to do it the long way, following the laws he had created. For \nexample when he created Adam and Eve he did not create them from nothing, \nhe used dust, converting every atom to carbon and rearranging the atoms to \ncreate every complex structure of the body. He decided to create these \nthings in an orderly fashion. Then when I was seventeen I thought back to \nthat idea and asked \"If God chose to create the universe in an orderly way, \ndid he also choose to create the laws in a orderly way?\" From this I \npostulated that the laws are based on intuitive principles that are most \nlikely simple. When learning about the four fundamental forces I assumed \nthey were different manifests of the same thing before I even heard of \nunified field theory. I think almost all laws are related and the \nrelationships between them will be so ingenious that it will be what \nmathematicians think of whilst masturbating. I also think this ingenious \norder will be true with the designs of organisms. From an evolutionary \nperspective we would expect life to be simpler than first thought, from a \ncreation perspective we would expect life to be more complex than first \nthought, so complex that you would think such design would require the \nengineering of - quite literally - a god. This one theological argument is \nthe butterfly effect of my life, my interest in philosophy has now extended \nto theoretical physics. I now spend an abnormal amount of hours each day \nthinking of hypotheses (Admittedly, this also includes morality and \ntheology) and aim to become a Theoretical Physicist.\n\n\"Look at all ancient cultures, they had a similar narrative\" From a \nbiblical world view these cultures have these gods because the original \nstory got mythologized after the tower of babel (that is, after the \nconfusion of languages and God's command for people to migrate the earth \nwhich I will talk about when I create the next message) a bit like a game \nof telephone. However, there is also a possibility that its origin is from \npeople deciding to worship other gods. We cannot know so its pure \nspeculation.\n\n\"Yet these archetypical stories are so universal that one can't possibly, \nlogically say that any scripture has the authentic \"written from the hand\" \nprint of the word of the one.\" The difference between Abraham's trio and \nother religions is that they were created through visions. In those cases \neach testimony is equally valid. However the bible can be \nvalidated/invalidate through its recording of historical events and people. \nAs mentioned before there are legends of a global flood all over the world. \nThere are also a few legends that are similar to Adam and Eve and the tower \nof babel (I will give specific examples when I get to those points of the \ntimeline). There have been many times archaeologists will accuse the bible \nof mentioning a city that doesn't exist and then that city is later \ndiscovered (this also happens with people mentioned in the bible). Also \neven if Christianity was based on visions I could still believe it to be \ntrue because I have been healed before. One night I woke up extremely sick, \nI called out to my mum but I was so worried I would vomit that it was \nmerely a whisper. My dad came instead and prayed for me. As he prayed he \nspoke in tongues and as soon as he spoke tongues the sickness vanished. It \nwasn't just kind of gone either, it was completely gone. Most Atheists I \ntalk to who aren't retarded (the ones that are retarded say it went away \ncoincidentally the moment my dad spoke in tongues) argue that it was the \nplacebo effect that made it go away. I think this is a fair argument, \nhowever the placebo effect has not been shown to work instantaneously and I \ndid not think I would be healed either and the placebo effect requires you \nto believe the claimed outcome.\n\n\"Science is trying its best to find the unmolested truth, evolution is a \nproduct of that effort.\" *Evolution is an interpretation of the science. \nDubstep quoted Neil Degrasse Tyson \"The good thing about science is that \nit's true whether or not you believe in it.\" (referring to people who do \nnot believe in evolution) It just goes to show how scientists can't even \ndistinguish fact from interpretation. Even Richard Feynman, a great mind, \ndid this with quantum mechanics. He was doing a lecture on how the \nprobability of light reflecting off glass from a 90 degree angle is just \nfundamental and has no reason for it and he said \"Its too bad if you don't \nlike it, it is how the universe works!\" (just in case you do not see the \nproblem with this, saying it is fundamental is an interpretation and he \nstated it as if it were fact) What is worse is he just finished explaining \nhow it is pointless to ask philosophical explanations about what we observe \nand to just accept it. He then does a bait and switch and says accept this \ninterpretation.\n\n\"for it is a bit of a truism to tell people that the universe began\" You \nasked for a narrative, what did you expect? You even said start from the \nvery beginning lol.\n\n\"its a bit arrogant to tell people you know what began it.\" As mentioned \nbefore, I do not claim to know truth, I only think what I know is true. I \neven said \"This is of course metaphysics, so the explanation is purely \nphilosophical.\"",

In this one I will \nstart from the very beginning - or more accurately before that (Even before \nisn't exactly accurate)\n\nBefore 'the all': \n\n In this message I will explain the nature of God as that was all that was \nthere before the all. This is of course metaphysics, so the explanation is \npurely philosophical. The bible begins with \"In the beginning God created \nthe heavens and the earth\" The reason it says beginning is because this is \nthe beginning of time. As incomprehensible as this is, God is timeless, \nhaving no past nor future. There was no before the universe. For God there \nis just the present. Think of God like a photon. Relative to us, the photon \nhits our retina, relative to the photon that just hit the retina, all \nthings have happened, even if time is infinite. In a way all things remain \npresent to the photon too, as the time it hit the retina happened just as \nlong ago as any other point in time. Why? because there is no time to the \nphoton. As a ten year old kid I remember trying to imagine what it was like \nbefore everything. I imagined God as a spiritual human floating in space, \nhaving a language for no reason, a body for no reason and floating in space \nfor no reason. This is not the case, God only chose to take the form of a \nhuman in heaven. He is not restricted by that form. This reminds me of the \ntrinity and how many people have a problem with how God could be multiple \nentities at once. I would explain it myself but this video does it \nelegantly, using logic (not the layman 'logic') making the argument almost \nirrefutable.\n\nwww(dot)youtube(dot)com/watch?v=bUy-H5MmeGU\n\nGod has created absolutely everything, matter, space, time and possibly \neven mathematics (there is disagreement about the latter, mathematics could \nbe absolute or we  maybe unable to comprehend how mathematics may not be \ntrue for all things since we live in a universe that is ruled by \nmathematics). \n\nA common question asked about God is why does he exist? We do not know. \nHowever this question could be broken down further to why does anything \nexist? This is the golden question of metaphysics and there are two \nresponses to this. The first is 'why does there have to be a reason?' and \nthe second is that the answer is probably beyond our comprehension. When we \nask questions they usually lead to more questions, this suggests we know \nnothing. If we struggle to understand the nature of our own universe, how \ncan we expect to understand what is beyond it?",

(think \nguilty until proven innocent)\" That doesn't stop people from believing it \nto be true. Why else do you think Physicists talk so dogmatically about the \nmultiverse? There is a common saying that it is either God or a multiverse. \nThe conclusion is made through reason, not observation.\n\n\"The multiverse hypothesis is generally based off the ideas of M-brane \ntheory\" M-brane theory has no tangible evidence to support it. It does not \ndeserve to be called a theory. It is like many worlds 'theory'.\n\n\"Creationism is a hypothesis, based usually on several ideas\n-the inherent order in the universe is the result of intelligent design\n-nothing has effect without cause\n-humans are too rare to be the result of a random process of evolution\" \nThere are far more 'ideas' to it than that and the ones you listed aren't \naccurate. I will address each point respectively:\n\n-Fine tuned laws suggest design (I know of two counter arguments to this \nand I have counter arguments to those counter arguments)\n\n-Everything that begins to exist has a cause\n\n-Certain systems of organisms cannot be any simpler aka irreducible \ncomplexity \n\nNow those are philosophical ideas we have there is also evidence against \nevolution such as genetic entropy, finding blood vessels, bone matrix and \nelastic tissue in dinosaurs, lack of transitional fossils (with just a \nhandful of disputable once), the ridiculous amount of modern birds in \ndinosaur strata etc\n\n\"Bacteria have been shown to become resistant to anti-biotics over the \ncourse of (their) generations due to mutations and natural selection. This \nmatches the hypothesis of evolution and thus is considered proof of it as a \ntheory.\" Creationists do not argue with natural selection and speciaton (In \nfact rapid speciation is more important to the creation model than it is to \nthe evolutionary model) This just shows how ignorant you are of creationist \nliterature. For an organism to be able to evolve from single celled \norganism it requires beneficial mutations that increase the information of \nthe genome and create a new feature. Bacteria becoming more resistant is \ndue to losing control of an enzyme's production. There is no new feature \nadded. \n\n\"This matches the hypothesis of evolution and thus is considered proof of \nit as a theory.\" If we observed a new feature added to an organism that \nwould only prove that evolution is possible (if we ignore genetic entropy \nand abiogenesis). To prove it occurred requires finding a series of \ntransitional fossils showing the development of a new feature. \n\n\"There is no similar proof for the hypothesis of creationism.\" Creationists \naccept that we cannot use science to prove the past as it is beyond what \ncan be observed, it also requires assumptions of the past and the \ninterpretation of evidence can become philosophical. However we like to \ncreate dilemmas for evolutionists who believe science can do so. ICR has \nfound an excessive amounts of C14 in diamonds, dating them under one \nmillion years (that's as low as it could record). The problem is diamonds \nare said to have formed one billion to three billion years ago. If this was \nthe case there should be no C14 left. You cannot say it has been \ncontaminated either like you do with dinosaurs fossils (they are frequently \ndated under 50,000 years) because diamonds are the densest naturally \noccurring mineral on earth making it the least likely to get contaminated. \nThere is a saying that a diamond is a creationists best friend. Also \ncivilizations around the world have legends that are very similar to Adam \nand Eve, the great flood and the tower of babel. This may be considered \nproof that these events occurred.",

The gospel is \nfoolishness to the lost. But most often people just reject the gospel \nwithout real genuine consideration. ",

One part of the system can look at itself and yet see it as \nseparate from itself, but only if it has the ability to *detect objects*. \nThere is no \"third party watcher\" at all, but I can definitely see what you \nmean by using these words. I think it's one system with literally billions \nof components that has resolved a way to detect objects, and think of them \nas separate from everything else. \n\nObject detection is what allows for language to develop. If you can look at \na table in a room and think of it as a self-contained, free-standing object \nthat is separate from the ground it's on, and separate from the background \nbehind it (because those things too are different mental objects), then you \ncan say that the object \"exists\" and you can come up with a *symbol* for \nit. That symbol in our language is \"table\". So things in the world are more \naccurately \"units of thought\", rather than units of matter -- which is much \nmore porous and/or plasmic in reality when you take the information created \nby our sense instruments out of the picture. \n\nThe first time you ever looked at a table and realized that it was a table \n(probably as a baby seeing an adult point at it and saying \"table!\"), your \nbrain released magnesium, pulling certain clusters of neurons closer \ntogether (those which were involved with identifying the table), and then \nit used calcium in your body to harden that area of the network to keep the \nnew neural correlate in place, so that in the future, those neurons will \nfire faster when a table is detected. These features of the brain are \ncalled areas of \"synaptic plasticity\", and it's what physically happens \nwhen you create a new symbol in your mind. \n\nThere is something like 100 billion neurons in each brain. I think the \nrelationships between certain neurons in a given cluster of neurons can \nrepresent a symbol, because I think that we detect objects by way of \ndetecting features, and we feature detect by way of electro-chemical \ncomputation. Chemicals are altered by electric signals incoming from sense \norgans which inform us of the features of a specific experience. The \nfeatures quickly compound and when they become \"noisy\" enough (when so many \nsignals are going to and from different cortices -- by way of energetic \nstimulation -- all at once causing vivid hallucinations to reverberate) is \nwhen the prefrontal cortex mediates those inputs and uses logic to deduce \nwhat something is. The lower cortices create vibrant reproductions of \nreality, and then the PFC reduces them down to symbols. \n\nThe stage where the hallucinations are louder than the signals coming from \nthe PFC is called \"imagination\" or \"ideation\" because the PFC is allowing \nthe brain to \"respond freely\" to stimuli, and is not mediating as hard as \nit would during a math test for example when symbolic features must be \nspecifically resolved or the object will \"be false\" (math is so stupid). \nWhen you're dreaming, the PFC is not mediating hardly at all, which is why \nyou can have a dream of someone licking your face and you wake up to find \nit's your dog, or have a dream of hearing a weird repetitive flute being \nplayed in your ear, only to wake to find that the noise was your alarm \nclock and you're late for work. The idea that an annoying noise can sound \nbeautiful when sleeping is really interesting to me. \n\nWe are very lazy and slow with object detection when we sleep, and we are \nalso not very good at \"knowing who/where/what we are\" when we are asleep, \nat least not to a certain degree of accuracy. There might be a functional \ncorrelation between object detection and \"self\" detection in the brain, and \n\"self\" probably emerges in the pre-frontal cortex where all other objects \nemerge, if this is indeed the case (I personally think it is). \n\nYou can tell when the prefrontal cortex intervenes when awake too, in \nsituations like when you're having some random experience, and then a \nmoment later you \"realize\" you're having the experience. That's \nconsciousness showing up to the party, but really it just means those \nclusters of neurons started paying closer attention and sharing information \nabout some sudden increase in stimuli. Awareness of reality can suddenly \nbecome heightened, if the animal is in danger especially. \n\nI believe that the \"self\" is just another object in your model of the \nworld, albeit the \"main object\" who associates in an intelligent, dualistic \nway with the animal that produces it for protection of the animal (some \npeople mistakenly attribute the ego to \"god\" and believe they are \ncommunicating with something external; others like me are happy mistakenly \nbelieving we are communicating with something internal).\n\nOur brains use the function of object detection to detect other people in \nthe environment. If you can have a symbolic representation of another \nperson in your brain, then you can certainly have a symbolic representation \nof YOUR person, in your brain. We probably started seeing other people \nfirst, and then wondered, \"am I one of those too?\", and the construction of \nego began. \n\n*An analogy for how I believe the illusion of identity actually happens:*\nImagine you were trapped in an empty room for eternity with a person who \nwas identical to you in every way. Not just looked identical to you, but he \nalso did all the same movements as you did when you did them. When you put \nyour arm up, he put his up, when you said something, he said that thing -- \nall at the exact same time like an exact replica of you that's doing all \nthe things you're doing (creepy right?). Except when you're not doing \nanything, he's allowed to move and talk again at his own free will. \nHowever, every time he moves or says something, your body then does it too \n-- the two of you are bound to each others' actions. So you are both \nallowed to freely say and do whatever you want, as long as the other person \nisn't saying or doing something; because whatever one person does, the \nother person does simultaneously. Well, eventually, the two of you would \ntry to coordinate your actions and movements such that you each take turns \ngiving each other enough \"autonomous free time\", and even when it's not one \nperson's free time, you would probably coordinate yourselves in a way that \nyou could live in a more unified way with each other. In other words, you \nboth would allow a more useful, collective identity to emerge. In effect, \nyou would both become the *same person*, but you'd be in two different \nanimals. \n\nIf there were 100 billion people in the same [but larger] room, in the same \nsituation. Those 100 billion people would all eventually merge into one \ncollective identity too. But when you get to that high of a number of \nparticipants, you would then need a smaller panel of people who represent \nthe collective -- a representative identity. An ego. Any time the actions \nin the room got out of sync or one group tried to override another \n(somehow), then the collective would quickly elect a new panel of \nrepresentatives to control the room and represent the motives of the \ncollective. This is like the infinite \"third party\" you were talking about. \nI think the ego has this authoritative ability, as a way to quiet the \nmadness that can go on between different areas of the brain. There's an old \nzen saying that says that inside every mind, there lives a master and his \nstudents. \n\nThere are billions of neurons at any given moment which are engaged in \nmodeling your current state of the world. I think that each neuron belongs \nto a different cluster which virtualizes different objects and processes \ndifferent logic, but also, each neuron in the consciousness centers of the \nPFC are constantly sharing with each other the *exact* same information \nabout the world, creating an illusion that they all have the same \ninformation, and thus sharing the illusion that they are all the same thing \n-- that \"you\" are \"one\" personality. \n\nSo the ego has the ability to associate with any number of perspectives at \nany time -- the watcher can watch the watcher can watch the watcher \ninfinitely -- but only because the ego has the ability to associate with \nany perspective at any time, based on the system of coordination that it \ninvented during its brain's infancy. Some people have invented poorer \nsystems of intellectual coordination amongst their consciousness centers \nand we call those people \"scatter brained\", or \"all over the place\" etc. \nThe way we have constructed our individual egos, and all the unique systems \nwe've each come up with is what makes some of our personalities so \ninteresting to each other, I think.

For example, I can shut my eyes \nand watch all my ego's thoughts... the nitpicking, the worries, the fears, \nthe excitements, the random other thoughts, you name it. Anything that I \ncan attach \"myself\" to as my identity and \"who\" I am, I can also examine \nfrom a 3rd person perspective.\n\nI can watch as I judge myself either positively or negatively, I can \nexamine myself become upset, in a very unattached way. I can watch how my \nbody wants to tense up when it's in pain... almost like watching a movie.\n\nWhy can I do this? Wouldn't it be safe to assume that if I were JUST ego, \nthen examining my ego separate from itself would be impossible?\n\nI'm talking beyond emotions, beyond sensation, beyond visual or auditory \nstimuli, beyond any \"feature\" we as humans identify ourselves as having.\n\nWhy can I (and likely many other people) \"watch\" my ego?

                    "text": "+mrTeeMorg I believe that who you refer to when you say \"I\" is the ego -- \nan intellectual feature of a human being's mind that allows it to be aware \nof itself in its environment, and thus create a model of the world around \nitself in which it is the main character, so that it can more successfully \nsurvive by way of intellectually valuing its existence. \n\nAs far as *how* it happens, I believe that consciousness is the result of \nan electrochemical attempt by the organism (\"you\") at timing, integrating, \nand thus unifying multiple streams of sensory data from various channels at \nonce in the brain to create a cohesive model of the world. \n\nEach passing moment, the brain shares information (sights, sounds, smells, \netc. but also much lower-level information that we do not experience \nconsciously) with other parts of the brain and body by way of \nhallucinations (e.g. constant auditory and visual hallucinations happen in \nthe mind, but also other hallucinations which attempt to model other \nsensory inputs which reverberate around and create the conscious \nexperience) in order to resolve the current state of the ego -- where you \ncurrently are, what you're doing, where others are in relation to you, etc.\n\nThere's a biological need to maintain static routines and permanence as \nmuch as possible in an ever-changing organism that ages and lives in a \ndynamic environment. So there's also a biological need for a mechanism to \nmaintain a permanent state of \"identity\" about the organism, so that it can \nboth understand what and where (and thus \"who\") it is in relation to other \npeople, events, and objects; as well as highly value its own identity so \nthat it will do whatever it can to overcome obstacles in its environment. \nNobody [healthy] wants to die. \n\nI think that ego is a survival mechanism of an organism that uses \nhallucinations recorded by original sensory experiences to communicate with \nitself about itself and its environment -- that is why \"you\" are you. So \nyou are a result of consciousness, and consciousness is the combined \nhallucinatory experience being produced by and shared within the brain as a \nresult of ego functionality. \n\nWe experience consciousness without ego when we dream, when the prefrontal \ncortex is far less active than normal, but some of the other cortices (e.g. \nthe visual cortex) are just as active as normal, and so the \"visual\" \nexperience can begin to actually override the \"me\" experience. Sometimes \nthe \"me\" experience is completely gone and it feels as though raw \nexperience can happen in the dream world without my identity being attached \nto it (e.g. it's possible to have a dream in which I am not me). \n\nIn fact, I am only truly me -- or, to be more accurate -- I am only *wholly* \nme when I am awake, because that's when my prefrontal cortex is very active \nin controlling the communications (hallucinations) among my other brain \norgans by muting some channels, illuminating others, and directing the flow \nof my conscious attention onto one subject matter rather than another -- \nsending signals to my eyes to focus, or to my hands to reach for things, \nwhen necessary, etc. -- in order to serve the goals of my projected (and \nillusory) identity.

                    "text": "+John Mills Yes! Exactly... Like that... I was thinking about this some \nmore after having forgotten about this post and I came to the following \nconclusion:\n\nEverything is One. Even down to a fundamental level in physics... \neverything is the same 'stuff' (energy). We don't know EVERYTHING there is \nto know about energy. Though, I think we'd like to believe that we do. We \nonly know how energy behaves relative to the human experience. That is all. \nNow... I don't have evidence, so what I'm about to say is a theory...\n\nThat the universe is a facet or... \"feature\" (much like the liver is a \nfeature of the human body) of a much more complex conscious, infinite \nentity. And that we are that entity (since all things are one), \nexperiencing all the possible variations of experience, ever.. which, in my \nopinion, are also infinite, thus an infinite universe. That doesn't mean \n\"we\" (flesh and blood) are the entity (not in its entirety), but rather, \nthis flesh and blood is simply a 'housing' made by the entity, for the \nentity. Okay so with that said, now to the sperm and eggs...\n\nMy conclusion was: No matter which sperm or egg came together, it would \nstill be \"You\" experiencing life. Because the body is a facilitator for the \nconscious experience in this 4-dimensional form of existence. \n\n\"You\" are not your body. Rather, \"You\" are the essence of what your body \n\"carries.\" If you lose your arm, did you lose a piece of yourself? If you \nreplace every part of your body with other cells, do you become someone \nelse? No.\n\nYou are not your eyes, but you are what sees. You're not your ears, but you \nare what hears. You're not your mouth, but you are what speaks... see what \nI'm saying? You're not your nervous system, but you are what feels.\n\nSo, why sperm and egg, if the only goal is to \"house\" a \"slice\" of this \ninfinite consciousness? Well, that's where I go into this infinite \nconsciousness wanting to experience variation, in all its infinite forms... \nthis infinite consciousness/entity has mechanisms to provide the best \npossible environment for automatic growth and progress (in this specific \ninstance of reality - 4 dimensions, physical, ever-changing)... To have \nthis, there needs to be duality, competition, difficulty, trial. Without \nthese things, there is no growth and potentially, no change. And therefore, \nno new experiences.\n\nThere exists Good and Evil, high and low, hot and cold, slow and fast, easy \nand difficult... and apart from any of these, the other would not exist. \nBecause they are relative. If something can be beautiful, other things \nbecome ugly.\n\nGranted, these are human-made concepts and do not exist in objective \nreality. But the ability to measure their seeming existence, at least on an \nagreeable subjective level, does suggest it is real. At least for humans.\n\nWe live in a world of duality. This existence, or rather, this current form \nof a finite experience we get to have, is literally made of opposites. \n\nI have a lot more, but I'm having a hard time articulating and I don't want \nto talk your eyes off. So I'll cut it off here.\n\nRemember, the above is theory. I'm just trying to figure out what the heck \nall this is. lol",

While we tend to ignore the automatic processes, you can make \nyourself conscious of them by simply directing your attention to them. Your \nheart is beating right now, air is passing through your trachea, you blink \nvery frequently. Automatic processes that you are now conscious of.

Because there are so many people \nwith those degrees, which have no practical application to the world, the \nvalue of that education is very, very low.  Seriously, if I wanted to hire \na psychology major (which I wouldn't) then I'd have so many options that I \ncould low-ball you to poverty because, 1) You won't have many options (so \nyou'll take whatever you can get) and 2) I could get someone else in your \nposition for cheaper (because they don't have many options and they'll also \ntake what they can get)!\n\nI'm not being purposefully condescending, either.  From the sound of your \ninitial post it sounds like I have many, many years of wisdom over you.  \nConsider this genuine advice and remember it going forward.  I'd hate when \npeople spend $100,000 on an education that wouldn't earn them a career that \ncan afford their  college debt.  (This happens all the time; look at the \nangst from the Occupy movement!)\n\nIf you do decide on psychology in college then find a minor that is worth a \ndamn and develop a skill set that has more demand than your major!  That'll \nbe your only saving grace in the job market  Of course, you could major in \nmath, English (technical writing and editing), sciences (physics, biology, \ngeology or meteorology), information technology (software engineering or \ndevelopment, networking engineering or administration, or project \nmanagement), finance (economics, accounting or investing) or medicine and \nhave an abundance of options and an endless supply of high-paying growth \npotential for the entirety of your life.\n\nGood luck.  ;)",
