Nonetheless, here is my attempt. Just observe animal \nbehavior. Hell, just truly analyze all animals (us included), you can see \nthere are tons of similarities still lingering between us. Dolphins can \ncommunicate and have sex for fun. Dogs may sacrifice themselves for the \nlives of other species. Our hearts are really similar to pig hearts. Our \nDNA is 60% the same as a banana tree. The list can go on and on. What does \nthis point to? A common ancestor. Now, be vary careful of what YOU THINK \nabout evolution, and what the theory of evolution really entails. There is \na difference between saying \"different kind of animals evolved into \ndifferent ones\", and saying there was a common ancestor, and due to \ndifferent living conditions, different species required different changes \nto continue the lineage. Simply look at how we different people around the \nworld are, each with distinct characteristics that we can recognize right \naway. Now, imagine that these group of people were segregated from each \nother, meaning Europeans cannot travel to America, or Asians can't travel \nto Africa. Set the timer and let it sit for a few thousand or even million \nyears, and guess what? We would have different human species! Just like we \nhave with animals. This is one of the hardest concepts to make others \nunderstand, because it is so easy to overlook phenomena that happens beyond \nour time span (thousands or millions of years).\n\nAlso, don't you think it is really convenient that the Vatican is keeping \nthose kind of secrets? I mean, come on! It is like the 5 year old that says \n\"I know the answer, but I won't tell you, lol!\". \n\nHuman beings are noted for recording spectacular events (aka. comets, \nearthquakes, and stuff). If miracles did indeed happen, they would be \nthousands and thousands of them recorded, and that would give scientists an \nopportunity to try to study them. Miracles are really just really nice \ncoincidences, and just because you decide to attribute it or not to God, \ndoesn't mean that God actually had anything to do with it.",

Spiro seems to believe. There you have an example of \nsomeone who believes in things i haven't even said once, only contradicting \nwhat she said which you also can clearly read.\n\ni'm not talking about my beliefs, i'm not trying to convince anyone to \nanything, i don't have to show any credibility for anything.\n\nif you know about science, you should know that \"everything\" is possible, \nthat there are more answers than alot of people think and of course there \nare also illusions over illusions. which ones do you trust more, the \ngovernments organized truths trough organized religion, controlled science \nfacts, controlled media, with them trying to poison you as much as they can \nso you have to depend on their meds. don't you read any news from these \ndays? don't you see what's happening around you? how you are lied to and \neverything. people are investigating and they have an infinity of facts for \nthe most different things. make your bigger picture or not, it's your \ndecision and i don't really care. i'm just chit chatting a little, you \nwon't be able to look away from alot of truths much longer. it doesn't \nmatter what you believe or not. maybe you'll think a short moment back on \nthis conversation and you start to think \"maybe there was something behind \nthese words but i just wasn't able to see it at that time\". that's typical, \njust don't make assumptions about me and state these as facts, but do as \nyou wish if it helps you. it's not like anyone of us is changing the \nhighest truth right?\n\njust try to not be deceived by anyone, be more aware and be aware of \nyourself. believe in the good if you think it's a good thing to believe in. \nops sorry this line was religion talk. i suggested some things in which you \ncould look in if you are interested. very interesting topics and \"facts\". \nif you think that 2 and 2 doesn't equal 4, then okay. as i said, i'm not \ntrying to convince anyone and i don't why you are thinking that way. why \nshould i possibly do that? as if i wouldn''t have anything better to do \nwith my time.\n\nthe only thing i want to do is to open your eyes and use your brain on your \nown, that's why you have to educate yourself. but i don't care if you \ndon't, i don't even care if you do but that also doesn't mean that i \nwouldn't talk to you about anything you'd like to if there is something.\n\njust stop taking me wrong, i understand your problems but no one is able to \nhelp you out if you look away. you won't be able to look away for long \nanymore. have a good day and good luck soldiers",

The only way for an individual to know if \ngod exist is when you die. That's the only real way to know if he exist or \nnot. If you are religious you believe without seeing debating against \natheists who have to see to believe it exists. \n\nOne little flaw in your thought processes atheists, our sense whether its \nsight, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling are always deceiving. \nDescartes explains that all out senses can deceive so seeing is believing \nis pretty much throw out the window since we cant always rely on our sense \nof sight. Fear can easily torment your sense into telling you whats there \nwhen its nothing. \n\nWhere as faith, you believe or have complete trust in something or someone, \nwhich can and also cannot be deceived. I have been thinking about posting \nthis comment for a long time, because its about time we as human beings end \nthis stupid, pathetic debate where no one wins or is right. No one side is \nright. I am a religious person because i choose to be, but i also listen to \nreason and logic. I do not favor any side in this pointless debate since \nall its doing is creating more and more conflict, leads to dividing us as a \nspecie when we should be joined together and finally be a united. \nAtheist come on we all know what pisses you off, and really you are the \nreason this conflict continues because your all hell bent on proofing your \nego to be right since you do not want to submit to authority. How about for \nstarts to stop treating people of religious beliefs like there poor insane \nhobos. People of faith stop treating people who are atheist as workers of \nthe devil or speakers. Treat them with love like jesus would do. Jesus hung \naround whores, criminals and other kinds of people who have committed sin. \nBy doing so he shared his love to everyone. Its about time we follow that \nexample and start loving everyone, and do not start a conflicts with \natheists as well. (this part of my post really is more directed to \nChristians, but Jews as well can take this under consideration.)\n\nAnother to remember is that time and space had to start somewhere, if not \nby a divine being, then what could have created time and space?\n\n\ufeff",

Fear of death \nis like the body clinging on to itself and 'not wanting' to return to the \nEarth, as if it were somehow something separate and NOT a part of that \nwhich created it? But the body arises OUT OF the Earth, death is not a \nseparate process that happens to \"me\" as a separate creature that exists \noutside and separate from all the processes of life? To fear death is to \ncling to the tension known to the mind as 'fear,' but the tension is simply \none of the body. So the body holds a tension out of a misunderstanding of \nits relationship to life proper. because the ego believes itself to be \nsomething wholly separate from all that there is, and therefore resists the \n'idea' of death, and manifests the resistance as a physical tension in the \nbody. Be nice to your body, embrace life and death. Nothing is separate. \nYou are not a fluke.",

Doesn't mean ANOTHER \"You\" doesn't \narise at some indeterminate point of time in the form of a different \nconscious vessel (this is what I think is meant by reincarnation). Like \nasking, what was it like to wake up without ever having gone to sleep \n(being born), or what is it like to go to sleep without ever waking up \n(death)?
