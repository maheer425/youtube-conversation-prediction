In fact they have a \nhandful of players that are a step or two away from world class. Plus the \n93' class has massive potential as well does the next era of English \nplayers.\n\nAlmost any team in the world would kill to have that kind of setup.\n\nThe team overall are solid defensively and are tough to score on. They \nforce the opposition to beat them instead of beating themselves. We saw \nthat in Euro 2012 with France, Ukraine, and Italy (They beat themselves \nagainst Sweden, but still won). Also they only conceded 4 goals in \nqualifying which was 3rd best in Europe.\n\nYou seem to judge England on results. They beat Brazil a year ago 2-1 and \nthen tied them in Rio 2-2. They also have just about every team they play \nagainst relishing to beat them. Chile beat England 2-0, who brought over a \nfull squad and not taking it lightly at all. Plus England were \nexperimenting and didn't have their normal setup. That is when they didn't \nhave a full squad, yet they even had the lead near the end. When England \nhave a full squad (almost or everybody available), which is rare, they are \nnot only tough to beat, but dangerous. Montenegro and Poland found that \nout. They had a killer instinct type approach.\n\nEngland are not as bad you rate them to be at. I have made that error a lot \non other teams too.",
