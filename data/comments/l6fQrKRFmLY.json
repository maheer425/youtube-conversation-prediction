There was a documentary about kids who were \nborn on 9/11 and one of the boys in it technically saved his uncle by being \nborn on that day because his uncle was going to go to work in the twin \ntowers cause that's where he worked but when he found out his nephew was \nbeing born he stayed at home meaning he avoided the attack",
