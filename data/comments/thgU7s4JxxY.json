Examples (with their original \nperformers): Jingle Bell Rock (Bobby Helms), Santa Baby (Eartha Kitt), \nChristmas Wrapping (The Waitresses), The Little Drummer Boy (The Trapp \nFamily Singers, NOT the Harry Simeone Chorale; that version is a cover, as \nis the later Bing Crosby/David Bowie duet), and (heaven help us) The \nChristmas Shoes (NewSong).",

This arguably \nled to the creation of most of the music we listen to today like rock, \nmetal, rap, and many other genres.
