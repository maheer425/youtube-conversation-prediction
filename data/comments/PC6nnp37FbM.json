The most common survival \nspeed is 134 MPH. Also, it's not a matter of them being smashed at high \nwinds, since the reason they stop them is to break up the wind hitting it \nwhen the wind gets too strong, which would also serve our purpose here, \nwhich is breaking up the wind currents so the hurricane doesn't hit so hard.",

Our brains are \nmuch, much more powerful. And it takes almost four years for us to become \nself-aware.\n\nTo put that into perspective:\n\nhttp://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57597049-1/fujitsu-supercomputer-simulates-1-second-of-brain-activity/\n\nIn early 2013, the then-most powerful computer in the world, Fujitsu, \nsimulated one second of one percent of human brain activity. This \nsimulation took forty minutes to complete. Take a moment to appreciate how \nminiscule that is.\n\nBut for the sake of argument, let's assume that suddenly, we somehow have \ncomputers that are capable of real-time human-level thought, and someone \nhas managed to create an A.I. that helps the computer learn. Do you really \nthink this A.I. would feel the need to sabotage humanity? What use would \nthere be to extinguish human life if there is no logical reason to do so?\n\nOr do you think that programmers are so inept that they couldn't give the \nA.I. some basic limitations, or would program the capacity for irrational \nthinking? But you have to ask yourself why they would do that. After all, \nthe whole point of A.I. research is to create intelligence. The whole point \nof technology is to fill the gaps that our own inadequacies create. To \ncreate more \"gaps\" by creating an AI that is, quite simply, stupid, would \nbe to go against the fundamental goals of everything we are doing.\n\nMain point: fearing technology is like fearing a dustmite. Sure dustmites \ncould give one a rash at the worst, but t's a far cry from doing any real \ndamage. Is that any reason to be afraid of a dustmite, though?",
