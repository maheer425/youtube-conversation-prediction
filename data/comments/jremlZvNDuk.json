The same test did \nin 1996 from the American Men of Science showed that 39.3% believe God \nexists (A statistical tie).\n\nA survey conducted between 2005 and 2007 by Elaine Howard Ecklund of \nUniversity at Buffalo, The State University of New York on 1,646 natural \nand social science professors at 21 elite US research universities found \nthat, in terms of belief in God or a higher power showed that 30% believe \nin God.\n\nFarr Curlin, a University of Chicago Instructor in Medicine and a member of \nthe MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics, noted in a study that \ndoctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a \nstudy that \"found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent \nbelieve in some sort of afterlife.\" and \"90 percent of doctors in the \nUnited States attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to \n81 percent of all adults.\" He reasoned, \"The responsibility to care for \nthose who are suffering and the rewards of helping those in need resonate \nthroughout most religious traditions.\"\n\nPhysicians in the United States, by contrast, are much more religious than \nscientists, with 76% stating a belief in God.\n\nReligious beliefs of US professors were recently examined using a \nnationally representative sample of more than 1,400 professors, showing \nthat 42.5% believed in God. \n\nDid you know that the Big Bang Theory was firs proposed by George Lemaitre, \na Bulgarian priest?\n\nDid you know that the founder of the Human Genome Project and the current \nhead of the National Institute of Health (Francis Collins) is a Christian? \n\n(For all the following information, refer to \"PEW Research Center \"Religion \nand Science: a Timeline\").\n\nDid you know that the practice of modern science was started by Thomas \nAqiunas, an Italian Monk who combined Greek Philosophy and Christian \nTheology to create the modern practice of science.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution in Europe in the 1700s and 1800s was started \nbecause of Islamic Scientists and University students.\n\nNicholas Copernicus, a Polish Catholic Priest discovered that the Earth \nrevolved around the sun.\n\nMax Planck, who founded the Quantum Theory of Physics was a man of faith.\n\nGregor Mendel, a Augustinian Friar (A Friar is kind of like a low ranking \nmonk) discovered genetics and became the \"Father of Genetics\". \n\nArno Penzias, in 1964 helped discovered Cosmic Background Radiation and was \nJewish.\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God, being originally Jewish his views changed \nto be more Pantheist but that is still the belief in God. \n\nStephen Jay Gould, an Evolutionary Biologist was more or less in the same \nshoes as Einstein. \n\nShould I go on? Also, did you ever study Theology in College? Did you at \nleast get your associated degree in Theology? I doubt it, considering you \nclearly show a lacking in the knowledge of the Bible. \n\nFact is, Religious men and Religion as a whole has done a lot of \ncontributions to science in the past....... Actually, since the first human \ncivilizations. From ancient Sumeria to today Religion has been a major \nadvancement in the realm of science. \n\n(Look up PEW Research Center \"An Overview of Religion in the United States\" \nHeading \"Religion and Science as Allies\").\n\nMost scientists, inventors and great thinkers in the last 1,000 years were \neither Religious or believed in God. Copernicus, Mendel, Aquinas, Augustine \nof Hippo, etc were men of the Cloth. Newton, Galileo, Kepler etc. were all \nvery Religious. \n\nIs that enough evidence or do you want more?

The personal God is \nwhat religious people believe in, the God that will answer your prayers, \nthe God who knows you and everyone in the world, the God that loves \neveryone, yet punishes you if you are evil. very paradoxical, very \nconfusing. Personally, like Kaku, I believe in the God of simplicity. Not \nnecessarily a God that we can observe with our own eyes, but perhaps a God \nthat governs the several dimensions above us, the God that is beyond the \nmultiverse. I believe God is math. He's got this universe, and all other \npossible universes, down to a science. And though we'd like to believe that \none day we'll have a single equation that can \"read the mind of God,\" I \nthink those are high aspirations. No matter how far we develop mathematics \nand physics, I don't think we can ever fully understand God, coincidences, \ninter-dimensional time, the afterlife, and separate universes from our own.\ufeff",

I think the word space is the incorrect word to use. \nWhy? because the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment seems to contradict with the \nword space in this context(or maybe i dont know what the definition of \nspace lol). But within the context of the video its saying the \ngravitational field does neither push nor pull on the object. It allows \nspace to push the object towards the center of the source of gravity. The \nvideo never specifically said gravity pushes. If i had to lean one way or \nthe other i would gravity acts closer to pulling an object rather than \npushing.",

You can read it in \n\"The Externalization of the Hierarchy\" by Alice Bailey, which was written \nmore than half a century ago, after Antonio Gramsci, while in Mussolini's \nprison for communism wrote \"The Prison Notebooks\" describing how the \nsatanic elite should use the media, the educational institutions, cultural \ninstitutions & liberal arts to perpetuate propaganda for economic Marxism \ntranslated into cultural terms, leaving us with mass satanic brainwash, \nwhich is why your favorite Holly wood celebrity idol of worship is so evil \n& demonic. Also, Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati Order \n(Jesuitism) wrote about how they would use all means, from books to music \nto direct the minds of men into the Luciferian ideology. \n\n\n\"Extraordinary claims\" is relative. What you consider an extra-ordinary \nclaim is could be quite ordinary to a person like me who's been educated on \nthe most esoteric sciences of reality for many years. \"Ordinary\" has to do \nwith a consensus, but I am not an idealist when it comes to the macro \nworld, I am a realist so it's difficult for me to care what the majority of \npeople believe, especially when there is a satanic oligarchy at the highest \ncorporate-political levels who hold a monopoly on knowledge, and most \npeople can't even distinguish reality from the Hollywood cartoon fantasy \nworld.

Any atheist who had a transcendent experience when realizing \nthe ignorance of humanity, will tell you that you can be a prisoner of your \nmind forged by doctrination of obedience from your elders, or be partners \nwith it and try to understand the best you can the true nature of reality \naround you, by being cynical and alwayts admitting when you don't know, and \nbecause someone else says they know, they better have extraordinary \nevidence for their extraordinary claims before you are ready to accept a \nnew thought into your mind as a fact.",

                "text": "Michio Kaku says that God could be a mathematician: \"The mind of God we \nbelieve is cosmic music, the music of strings resonating through 11 \ndimensional hyperspace. That is the mind of God.\"\n\nVideo Transcript:\nSome people ask the question \"Of what good is math?\" What is the \nrelationship between math and physics? Well, sometimes math leads. \nSometimes physics leads. Sometimes they come together because, of course, \nthere's a use for the mathematics. For example, in the 1600s Isaac Newton \nasked a simple question: if an apple falls then does the moon also fall? \nThat is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by a member of \nHomo sapiens since the six million years since we parted ways with the \napes. If an apple falls, does the moon also fall? \n\nIsaac Newton said yes, the moon falls because of the Inverse Square Law. So \ndoes an apple. He had a unified theory of the heavens, but he didn't have \nthe mathematics to solve the falling moon problem. So what did he do? He \ninvented calculus. So calculus is a direct consequence of solving the \nfalling moon problem. In fact, when you learn calculus for the first time, \nwhat is the first thing you do? The first thing you do with calculus is you \ncalculate the motion of falling bodies, which is exactly how Newton \ncalculated the falling moon, which opened up celestial mechanics.\n\nSo here is a situation where math and physics were almost conjoined like \nSiamese twins, born together for a very practical question, how do you \ncalculate the motion of celestial bodies? Then here comes Einstein asking a \ndifferent question and that is, what is the nature and origin of gravity? \nEinstein said that gravity is nothing but the byproduct of curved space. So \nwhy am I sitting in this chair? A normal person would say I'm sitting in \nthis chair because gravity pulls me to the ground, but Einstein said no, \nno, no, there is no such thing as gravitational pull; the earth has curved \nthe space over my head and around my body, so space is pushing me into my \nchair. So to summarize Einstein's theory, gravity does not pull; space \npushes. But, you see, the pushing of the fabric of space and time requires \ndifferential calculus. That is the language of curved surfaces, \ndifferential calculus, which you learn in fourth year calculus.\n\nSo again, here is a situation where math and physics were very closely \ncombined, but this time math came first. The theory of curved surfaces came \nfirst. Einstein took that theory of curved surfaces and then imported it \ninto physics.\n\nNow we have string theory. It turns out that 100 years ago math and physics \nparted ways. In fact, when Einstein proposed special relativity in 1905, \nthat was also around the time of the birth of topology, the topology of \nhyper-dimensional objects, spheres in 10, 11, 12, 26, whatever dimension \nyou want, so physics and mathematics parted ways. Math went into hyperspace \nand mathematicians said to themselves, aha, finally we have found an area \nof mathematics that has no physical application whatsoever. Mathematicians \npride themselves on being useless. They love being useless. It's a badge of \ncourage being useless, and they said the most useless thing of all is a \ntheory of differential topology and higher dimensions.\n\nWell, physics plotted along for many decades. We worked out atomic bombs. \nWe worked out stars. We worked out laser beams, but recently we discovered \nstring theory, and string theory exists in 10 and 11 dimensional \nhyperspace. Not only that, but these dimensions are super. They're super \nsymmetric. A new kind of numbers that mathematicians never talked about \nevolved within string theory. That's how we call it \"super string theory.\" \nWell, the mathematicians were floored. They were shocked because all of a \nsudden out of physics came new mathematics, super numbers, super topology, \nsuper differential geometry. \n\nAll of a sudden we had super symmetric theories coming out of physics that \nthen revolutionized mathematics, and so the goal of physics we believe is \nto find an equation perhaps no more than one inch long which will allow us \nto unify all the forces of nature and allow us to read the mind of God. And \nwhat is the key to that one inch equation? Super symmetry, a symmetry that \ncomes out of physics, not mathematics, and has shocked the world of \nmathematics. But you see, all this is pure mathematics and so the final \nresolution could be that God is a mathematician. And when you read the mind \nof God, we actually have a candidate for the mind of God. The mind of God \nwe believe is cosmic music, the music of strings resonating through 11 \ndimensional hyperspace. That is the mind of God.\ufeff",

It makes for the perfect metaphor. When He says the mind of God, he \nmeans a complete working knowledge of the universe. Just like when someone \nsaid \"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God\". They probably didn't mean \nthat literally. In western culture the big religions are Christianity, \nJudaism and Islam. All three operate under \"ethical monotheism\", acting \njustly under a just god. In these religions God is the standard by which \nmorality is judged. So in the quote God becomes a metaphor for what is \nright. \"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to what is right. Dr. Kaku \ndoesn't believe in God but does use God as a metaphor from time to time.",

                "text": "What will atheist say when there is proof of God?\n\nWe all need to wake up from this delusion we are feeding our mind. \n\nString Theory is the only theory that can explain all phenomenons.\n\nA Theory of Everything?\n\nOne of the crowning achievements of 20th century science is that all the \nlaws of physics, at a fundamental level, can be summarized by just two \nformalisms: (1) Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, which gives us a cosmic \ndescription of the very large, i.e. galaxies, black holes and the Big Bang, \nand (2) the quantum theory, which gives us a microscopic description of the \nvery small, i.e. the microcosm of sub-atomic particles and radiation. But \nthe supreme irony, and surely one of Nature\u2019s cosmic jokes, is that they \nlook bewilderingly different; even the world\u2019s greatest physicists, \nincluding Einstein and Heisenberg, have failed to unify these into one. The \ntwo theories use different mathematics and different physical principles to \ndescribe the universe in their respective domains, the cosmic and the \nmicroscopic. Fortunately, we now have a candidate for this theory. (In \nfact, it is the only candidate. Scores of rival proposals have all been \nshown to be inconsistent.) It\u2019s called \u201csuperstring theory,\u201d and almost \neffortlessly unites gravity with a theory of radiation, which is required \nto solve the problem of quantum wormholes. The superstring theory can \nexplain the mysterious quantum laws of sub-atomic physics by postulating \nthat sub-atomic particles are really just resonances or vibrations of a \ntiny string. The vibrations of a violin string correspond to musical notes; \nlikewise the vibrations of a superstring correspond to the particles found \nin nature. The universe is then a symphony of vibrating strings. An added \nbonus is that, as a string moves in time, it warps the fabric of space \naround it, producing black holes, wormholes, and other exotic solutions of \nEinstein\u2019s equations. Thus, in one stroke, the superstring theory unites \nboth the theory of Einstein and quantum physics into one coherent, \ncompelling picture.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Clementine Kirkpatrick-Tamba I want to make sure that I'm understanding \nyou correctly. God is pure spirit, and responds to any divine name and to \nany theological definition of his nature. We connect with this Spirit v\u00eda \nour own human spirit. Man is a physical creature endowed with a quality \nthat is something more than just intellect, and which we call spirit, or \nsoul. The only way that we could prove God's actual existence is if God had \na physical form. If then we discovered God's existence scientifically, it \nwould indicate that God is an anthropic person, like us, with a body and a \nspirit. This would put an end to the concept of God as we currently define \nit. Is this how you see it? My own view, or, rather, what I'm inclined to \nbelieve, is that our creator is not, or need not necessarily be, in this \ncreation. What is here is an on-going creative effect that is a \nmanifestation of the creator's wisdom. In other words, I think \"God\" is an \nanthropic creature, probably immortal, who is indigenous to, and actually \nexists in, a universe other than ours. This makes us \"in his image,\" and \nimplies that anthropism is the highest self-expression of Reality and that \nthe meaning of our existence is to create on a universal scale.",

God, Allah, Vishnu, etc) represents a spiritual connection to Spirit. \nHow can you possibly prove the existence of spirit? By its own definition \nspirit is non-tangible. You can't touch it, you can't see it and so you \ncan't prove it's existence. To believe in the existence of God one has to \nfirst acknowledge he has a spirit residing within, not just mind or \nconsciousness. I believe the spirit within man is that part of man utilized \nto make contact with the spirit world. When I say spirit world I mean God, \nprayer, meditation, etc. Can I see my spirit? No. Can I touch it? No. God, \nwho is spirit and ineffable, cannot be seen or touched in a concrete, \ntangible way. So how do we make connection with God? Certainly not by \nseeking physical evidence, God is spirit. We make connection with God \nthrough our spirit; therefore, communication is spirit to Spirit. \nMan is physical, we can prove that in a concrete, tangible way, if we \ncouldn't, man would cease to be man. The existence of God is spirit, once \nwe can prove that in a concrete, tangible way, God is no longer God. ",

                    "text": "+Ami Blackwelder You guys are fucking stupid if you think the universe and \nlife don't have a cause and just popped into existence. \n\nAtheists used to hide on the thought that the universe was forever eternal \ntherefore didn't need a cause to exist so Causality didn't apply to the \nuniverse. Sadly, it was in 1929 the Edwin Hubble discover that the galaxies \nwere expanding and that led to one of the most solid theories out there. \nThe Big Bang. The universe DID have a beginning, therefore it requires a \ncause, what caused the Big bang?  and it wasn't just a normal expansion. It \nwas an insanely fine-tuned expansion.If expansion rate of the universe was \nslower by 1 part in a million million, the universe would have collapsed \nvery early. If the expansion rate was greater by 1 part in a million, \ngalaxies stars and planets never would have formed.\n. If the charge of the Proton and Electron not been Exactly Equal hydrogen \natoms would repel one another and there would be no galaxies.\n\n2. If the Relative Strength of the Four Fundamental Forces-gravity, \nelectromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces-were slightly \ndifferent, no life would be possible. If the strong force (the force that \nbinds protons and neutrons in the nucleus) was just two per cent less, it \nwould have destroyed all nuclei essential to life. If it was two per cent \nmore, it would have prevented the formation of protons and, therefore, \nmatter.\n\n3. If the Proton/Electron Mass Ratio of 1836 to 1 had been slightly \ndifferent, there would be no chemistry.\n\n4. If the Balance Between the Gravitational Force and the Electromagnetic \nForce in Stars had been altered by a mere 1 in 1040, it would have produced \na universe composed entirely of blue giants and red dwarfs-stars that don\u2019t \nsupport life.\n\n5. Given the second law of thermodynamics, a big bang should have produced \na universe with zero order (maximum entropy), and yet our universe came out \nvery orderly (Low Entropy).\n\n\n6. If the Centrifugal Force did not Perfectly Balances the Gravitational \nForce, every galaxy and solar system would come crashing in upon itself.\n\n7. If the Resonance (energy) Level of the Carbon 12 Nucleus was slightly \nlower, carbon would not form. A slightly higher level would instantly \ndestroy it. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and the other heavy elements required \nfor life all depend upon this.\n\nIf the Big Bang was merely a chance happening it is virtually impossible \nthat all the values of all of these forces would have been exactly right to \nensure the survival of the universe and to allow life. Given the \npotentially infinite number of other values these forces could have taken, \nit is much more likely that they would have fallen outside the very narrow \nrange that is conducive to life. As John Leslie, the philosopher of science \nhas put it, \u201cLife prohibiting universes are much more probable than life \npermitting universes.\u201d This is evidence of an intelligent designer behind \nthe Big Bang who ensured that it happened in such a way that the universe \ncould support life.\nThere's no way around it. The universe and more importantly life can't just \npop into existence. \nProofs exist only in mathematics and logic, not in science.  Mathematics \nand logic are both closed, self-contained systems of propositions, whereas \nscience is empirical and deals with nature as it exists.  The primary \ncriterion and standard of evaluation of scientific theory is evidence, not \nproof.  All else equal (such as internal logical consistency and \nparsimony), scientists prefer theories for which there is more and better \nevidence to theories for which there is less and worse evidence.  Proofs \nare not the currency of science. We cannot prove dark matter exists but we \ncan its effects. Same for the Creator. Let me quote one of the greatest \nminds of science How did life originate? Evolutionist Professor Paul Davies \nadmitted, \u201cNobody knows how a mixture of lifeless chemicals spontaneously \norganized themselves into the first living cell.\u201d1 Andrew Knoll, professor \nof biology, Harvard, said, \u201cwe don\u2019t really know how life originated on \nthis planet\u201d.2 A minimal cell needs several hundred proteins. Even if every \natom in the universe were an experiment with all the correct amino acids \npresent for every possible molecular vibration in the supposed evolutionary \nage of the universe, not even one average-sized functional protein would \nform. So how did life with hundreds of proteins originate just by chemistry \nwithout intelligent design? .\n Now, the golden ratio is the  number approximately equal to \n1.618033989...It is exactly equal to (1+\u221a5)/2\nIf you divide a line into two parts so that:\nthe longer part divided by the smaller part\nis also equal to the whole length divided by the longer part then you will \nhave the Golden Ratio. It is found EVERYWHERE IN NATURE. EVERYWHERE, \nGALAXIES, PLANETS, THE HUMAN BODY, PLANTS, SEASHELL, FRUITS, VEGETABLES, \nTHE DOUBLE HELIX IN THE DNA. EVERYWHERE. I mean if we are in fact product \nof chance, why is there a pattern? and more importantly why is there order \nand symmetry in nature? Why do the laws of physics exist?I love you're \nstupidity , we don't know therefore it had to be an accident. Classical \nargument from ignorance. Organism don't evolve \"bit by bit\" you idiot, \ntheir genetic code have to be 100% functional from the start to be able to \nwork. \n\"The DNA is like a computer software but far, far more advanced than any \never created\". We know from experience if you have a computer program you \nneed a computer programmer. Law of Causation also states that the effect \ncan't be greater than the cause therefore if we have conciosness than \nwhatever or whoever our cause was has be conscious as well. It is \nmathematically impossible for a protein cell to come by chance let alone \nthe human body with TRILLION OF LIVING CELLS. You have to be literally \nretarded if you think there isn't a Creator out there. I don't have enough \nfaith to believe billions and billions of accidents mysteriously took place \nat the exactly right time. BTW if you do have enough faith though, I \nsuggest next time you run out of gas, you wait for a quantum fluctuation to \noccur. Pathetic.",

I mean it is only understandment because we create the language \nof the world and without these words to make sense, God would be \nuntouchable unnoticed. Was thinking how in the Bible, the Lord can be with \neveryone and everything; all things of the world? The animals, the sun, the \nearth, everyone and everything watching over us all consistently? Trying to \nunderstand how God can be with us at all times, always? Well we create \nthought, so how can that thought be with us at all times? I came to believe \nGod, the Lord of all powers is merely \"The thought of overcoming today for \na better tomorrow\". That is how he can be with everyone and everything at \nall times. Think of the simplest things. Before we existed, bacteria. Even \nbacteria had the Lord with them at all times, accumulating the best \npossibility to grow for a better tomorrow to today of where we are now. So \nin the Bible, we have heard about in the future we will be lifted to the \nstars and the sun to imaginable lengths. How? By the anti-Christ will take \ncare of us and we will fall to our knees. Believing as I do, I tried to \nfigured how in the past, they tried to predict through the Bible; of how it \nwill become of the future. In the past they had weapons and of coin that \neveryone of the world greed. They came to believe that this object would \nonce rule the world the land of metal. It is coming to today as you can \nsee, metal though our desire is programed our written thinking rot. \nThinking it would have our overcomes to a better tomorrow \"God\". It would \nbe of everything we are except one thing, it is not made up of flesh and \nbones. Once believing as we do it would look around at the world to see \nwhat it is made up as. Metal accumulates most of the land thinking it \nbelongs a part if the earth more than we do. I don't think the Bible was \ntrying to feed us lies, because no one is right or wrong, we merely created \nunderstandment; but simply slow down this process of the beast it knew of \nto become. With this information maybe you could become a believer of \nChrist now that you have answers. Jesus the man \"Son of God\" being murdered \nfor his belief in that he \"was\" truly the son of God. Only just being the \nthought of that we all have the beliefs of overcoming's and how we all are \nthe children of God. Maybe you could change your input and beliefs now that \nyou have logic and understandment, how I know it is hard to believe \nsomething you can not prove; but here you go. Now that you do have an \nanswer through some thinking, may you help me and just believe with me \nrather than being an unbeliever. Thank you, we really should all help stop \nthe process of the new species of the world; referring to metal. Once we \ncreate the spawn of a species we will no longer be on top of the food \nchain. I mean look at movie titles we create. Once machine rules it will \nlook at what we have thought up and think irony how we knew our comings but \ndid nothing about it. I want to know how can we please this from happening? \nThrow all our computers away? To save how we are of collect in the future, \nwould really like your input. How do you think? \ufeff",

                "text": "Before people laugh at religious people, bare in mind that some of the \ncleverest people to ever life on Earth where Christian and had the highest \nIQ's of all...\n\n1) Andrew Magdy Kamal. Highest IQ ever recorded at 231.734. He scored this \nlast year just before turning 17. He is founder of the Coptic Orthodox \nMessiancan Group. Andrew hopes to use his talents and intelligence to \nspread the news of Yeshua (Christ). And that Yeshua is his hero.\n\nA Christian with the \"highest IQ score ever recorded, imagine that.\n\n2) Abdessellam Jelloul, Highest IQ score as an adult 198. He believes God \nis the Supreme being of the universe.\n\n3) Christopher Michael Langan. Has an IQ of 195. Langan has indicated in \nhis writings that he believes in God, for example, in William Dembski's \nbook \"Uncommon Dissent\", he wrote: \"...since Biblical accounts of the \ngenesis of our world and species are true but metaphorical, our task is to \ncorrectly decipher the metaphor in light of scientific evidence also given \nto us by God\".\n\n4) Christopher Hirata. Has an IQ of 225 which he was tested while a \nteenager. Was working for NASA at age 16. Hirata posted the following to \nhis Facebook on October 31, 2013: \"Today's experience: saying the Lord's \nprayer with a homeless couple on Colorado Boulevard. It may not feed or \nshelter them, but I hope that it made a difference in their lives.\" So he \nis clearly both a Theist and a Christian.\n\n5) Evangelos Katsioulis, IQ of 198 when tested as an adult. He is \napparently a follower of a strand of Christianity influenced by Teilhard de \nChardin.\n\n6) Rick Rosner. IQ of 192 tested as an adult. He believes that there maybe \nan infinity of gods.\n\n7) Mislav Predavec. IQ of 192 tested an an adult. He's a Christian and had \nthis response to a friend who had just accepted Christ\ufeff",

After that all other Wisdom comes.\n\n2Ko 5:15  and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to \nthemselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.\n\n2Ko 5:16  So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if \neven we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no \nlonger.\n2Ko 5:17  So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old \nthings have passed away; behold all things have become new:\n2Ko 5:18  and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by \nJesus Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation:\n2Ko 5:19  how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not \nreckoning to them their offences; and putting in us the word of that \nreconciliation.\ufeff",

And \nwhat is the key to that one inch equation? Super symmetry, a symmetry that \ncomes out of physics, not mathematics, and has shocked the world of \nmathematics. But you see, all this is pure mathematics and so the final \nresolution could be that God is a mathematician. And when you read the mind \nof God, we actually have a candidate for the mind of God. The mind of God \nwe believe is cosmic music, the music of strings resonating through 11 \ndimensional hyperspace. That is the mind of God",

Rather, the pencil is what \nthe stick-man does observe. Through it's graphite tip and rubber end, you \nshape and define his reality according to your handiwork.\n\nThrough this pencil the stick-man's entire reality is both created and \ndestroyed; when you draw with it, the stick-man perceives new life and \nmatter being formed before him. When you erase, he witnesses the cataclysm \nand obliteration that ensues. To the stick-man, you are not real; but the \npower of the pencil... it is the single inexplicable phenomenon. The \npencil has the power to give, and take away. It is a 'god'.\n\nWhether the stick-man believes in this pencil, or whether you have designed \nhim with it, remains a mystery. He may try to better understand this \npencil's power with the sciences of his 2D realm; we can not tell, nor do \nwe care. For as the illustrator, we are the beginning. And the end.\n\nAnd so it is, with God.\ufeff",

The God is not affected by the time \nand space since He created both creations. The God has no beginning and end \nwhich human mind is not capable of processing such logic and condition. God \nis not created and won't dead. The logic of human always needs \"something \nmust has the beginning\". Yes, that's not wrong since the universe itself \n(as a one of the creation by the God) has its own beginning. The nature of \nGod is beyond any of our comprehension. To think further about it would not \nsee an endgame. Better think what He wants us to do on this world. Begin \nand end are also the law of nature He sets on this world and with reason. \nIt is a indication that this world won't last.",
