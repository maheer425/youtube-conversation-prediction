Not even if you are the most awesome Cpt Puglsy.\n\nWhy do I even bring up a nit-pick like this? Because Tom is a genius and I \nexpect (almost) perfection from him. And it is because I like his videos so \nmuch that I dare criticize them.\n\nEDIT: Above I wrote that \"I really hate the lack of detail...\" which is \nsomething I can't understand. I must have been tired ur just in a bad mood. \nI am so sorry for that.\n\nWhat I really meant is that I would love to see such a minor detail as \nsniper physics and SFX to be as authentic as possible. At least the SFX, as \nBarrett .50 cals have quite a distinguishable sound; I am no expert by any \nmeans, but you easily understand if you look up a few videos here on \nyoutube. Assault rifels and submachine guns are easier to fake, albeit some \ngun-nuts are sure to note the errors there. =)\n\nSo in the end, I think this video is bloody brilliant in terms of story and \nexecution. It was just that I, as I said, thought it was interesting that \neverything else was so well thought-out except for that minor detail.\ufeff",

However, I must admit it is just now that I realize I used \nthe word \"hate\" in the first comment, and honestly, I have no idea WHY I \nused such a word. I must have been tired or something.I apologize to \neveryone for that especially to Tom! I shall edit that comment tomorrow \n (Youtube on a galaxy tab won't let me edit comments).

AND I admitted \nit was a nit-picking.\n\nRest asured, that if this video would have been done by someone less \nsuccessful than Tom, I would not have had an issue with that detail. My \nmotto is to give tougher criticism to those who can need and can perhaps \nutilize it. Tom does not need a rookie-classed criticism. He is way too god \nfor that. Thus he should get harder criticism. On his level, and in this \nparticular video, the only apparent area he can improve is the small \ndetails (e.g. like the one I pointed out). Yeah.. One could also say that \nsome CGI could have been done better, but that is something I belive will \nimprove anyways as time goes by.\n\nDo I make sense to you guys at all, or are you gonna be the usual \"haters \ngonna hate\"-dudes?\n\np.s.

I definitely get the parody they are creating, but at \nthis point I've got the message loud and clear... so that parody is a bit \ndried up.\n\nAnyways, yes, sorry for making an inane comment.

I'm glad to see you didn't make it an actual part of the video and I \nreally do think your videos are improving, but every time I see the hairy \nguy in the floppy horse mask, I go from laughing to sighing. Thanks for \ntaking the time to read this comment, and I hope you take this as \nconstructive criticism as that is how it was intended. \n\nLooking forward to the next video,\nHarry.",
