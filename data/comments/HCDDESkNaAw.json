In my city, people who are having troubles paying their \nmortgage can't all move into apartments because we have such a low vacancy \nrate. I think about a year ago there are only about 1.5% of apartments \navailable to rent, and very long waiting lists for affordable housing. This \nproblem started in my province in 2008 after many people started just \nflocking my city. By 2010 housing prices doubled and rent went up about \n$150-300. Before our city had a pretty comfortable housing situation, but \nnow if we ever get a huge crash like in the states, my province is going to \nbe between a rock and a hard place; high housing costs and nowhere to \nbuy/rent. People who are getting min-wage, or students right out of \nuniversity are going to be forced to live out on the streets if this \nhappens.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+LTrotsky 21st Century Prior to the collapse, the Canadian banking industry \nhad been pushing for less regulations, but not full de-regulation. They \nused the same arguments that had been used successfully in the US but the \nfederal government wouldn't budge. Then things fell apart. The impact was a \nfraction of what it was elsewhere, namely the US, and the Canadian banking \nindustry changed its tune. While they argued that the regulations in place \nprevented them from making even more money, these same regulations kept \nthem alive and making money throughout the crisis. So yes, they know the \nregs and the fed's opposition to changing them saved their asses. With that \nbeing said, one can't help but wonder when they'll try again. As a citizen \nwho has stock in 2 different banks, I hope the regulations stay put. The \nissue isn't the banks making money (they make several billion dollars each \nyear) it's the issue of making more. Many American banks don't care if \ntheir business practices lead to economic disasters as long as they make \nmore and more money. I'm glad that our federal government over the last few \ndecades has been aware of the potential for abuse (which is exactly what \nhappened with American banks) and had steadily changed regulations to \nmitigate such risk. I'm not saying we've got it all figured out, but in \nthis one particular area we seem to have gotten our collective shit pretty \nmuch together.\n\nAs for Harper, he has supported the continued regulatory model. Some \ndislike him because he's not flashy or charismatic, rather grey, but that's \nalso why the majority of Canadians like him. He just does his job. He is a \nConservative, but acts more like a progressive. He sees that for Canada to \nthrive and grow, some of the old ideas have to be thrown out and bring in \nsome new ones that reflect the changing global economy, like he did just \nrecently by signing a free trade agreement with South Korea. S.Korea has \nthe 13th (pretty sure) largest economy in the world so trade with them \nwould be huge for both nations. Sure, the big 3 American automakers make \nnot like it, but protecting them by all means possible is one of those old \nideas that has to go.",

I don't know how much of the toxic \nCDOs were sold or bought by Canadians or Canadian financial concerns, but \nabsent the bailout those instruments would have wiped out a great deal of \nsavings.\n\nBanking regulations *used* to be more strict in the US.

And, as I suggested, this is one of but not the only source of \nchaos in the capitalist economy - the other is called by bourgeois \neconomists \"overproduction\" but which communists call appropriation.\n\nThere are various reasons why fictitious capital creation is inherent to \ncapitalism, and why it therefore cannot be eliminated - if you read Marx \nyou can discover this. But, in more practical terms, among the main reasons \nit can't be eliminated is because of the control exerted by capitalists - \nby the entire dynamic of capitalist social relations - on the political \nsystem. Why was Glass-Steagall, a law put into effect during the FDR regime \nto prevent banks speculating with deposits, repealed by the Clinton regime? \nFor the reason I just mentioned. The GSA was not a full prophylactic on \n\"speculation\" or fictitious capital creation, only a partial one in one \nsegment of the financial \"industry\". Even this small preventative could not \nbe maintained politically.\n\nYour statement regarding the \"failed\" economic systems of communist states \nis utterly wrong, and unfortunately simply displays your ignorance of \nhistorical economic data. Or, perhaps more accurately, your statement is \nmerely an uncritical reflection of bourgeois ideology, a reflection which, \nadditionally, is a further demonstration of why you cannot get rid of \nfictitious capital creation in capitalism : the conceptions necessary to do \nso do not arise in the minds of people wedded to the capitalist mindset. \nHow many times have you heard capitalists say \"speculation is necessary\" \nand \"provides insurance to the markets\" - when of course this is the exact \nopposite of the truth (assuming the terms could be defined).",

The \nsubprimes did not inflate the bubble, it just extended how large the bubble \ncould get.\n\n*The new bubble*\n\nCenk, it is YOU who don't understand what a bubble even is.  A \"bubble\" is \nan overinflation of the value of something.  Since you do not own anything \nwhen you are renting a property, there aren't things like equity and other \ncomparisons that will drive people to foreclose.  The foreclosures mostly \ndidn't happen because people couldn't afford to pay their rent.  Indeed, \nmost people actually continued to pay and I would venture to say that over \nhalf are paying that rent today.\n\nThe issue with foreclosures happened when equity plumitted.  People would \nbe paying the banks $350K for a house that dropped to under $100K.  THAT'S \nwhat drove people to abandon their bank agreements.  People understood that \nit simply wasn't worth it.  \n\n*Half of all income to rentals*\n\nlol, Cenk.  Many poorer people will spend over half their money on rent \nalone, that's just the way it is.  To ignore this means to just not \nunderstand what the poor go through.  It's not a bubble, it's just the \ndifference between paying rent and paying a mortgage.  They aren't the same \nthing.  \n\nWhen someone abandons a rental, the bank just looks for a new person to \nrent the property.  The bank does not have to look for another buyer and \nthey don't have to measure against equity.  Rental value is determined by \nthe value of taxes and/or mortgages, the values of other homes within the \ncity, and the quality of the home (including the area).  Bubbles don't \nexist in rentals because, when you rent out your property, you are \nproviding a service, and services do not have bubbles.\n\nBubbles get attached to things with tangible value such as the actual sale \nof property.  \n\nSo, in a nutshell, you don't even know what the hell you're talking about.\ufeff",

As a simplistic example, it \ntypically involves something like buying stock in a commodity on the \nassumption that the price will go up after you buy it, and then \nsimultaneously, short-selling stock in that same commodity on the \nassumption that the price will go down.  Sometimes it is not quite the same \ncommodity or stock or whatever, but is still equivalent to putting money on \nthe assumption that things will go the other way. \n\nAs for exactly how they bet \"against\" something, like with \"short-selling\", \nis a little complicated.  Ultimately, it comes down to not just \nbuying/investing in something, but also *promising* to buy something in the \nfuture, if that thing is expected to lose value.  In short-selling, I \n\"borrow\" stock from you at the current price, on the assumption that the \nprice will go down, which means I \"take\" the stock and sell it to the \nmarket-at-large, while giving you a \"lender's fee\" and the promise that you \nwill get that stock back later.  When the price of that stock goes down, I \nthen buy the same amount of that stock from the market-at-large, but now at \na lower price.  Because the price is now lower, I did not have to use as \nmuch money to buy it, thus the difference is new revenue, and if that \nrevenue is greater than the lending fee I paid you, then the remainder is \nprofit. \nYou also profit by way of the lender's fee, but doing so means that you did \nnot want to otherwise act on the possibility that the stock price would go \ndown.

Their futures would be considerably impaired, even beyond \nthe usual 7year sanctions levied by the Banks and other employment sectors.\n\nIf you are fortunate to find employment, most employers have flatlined \nsalaries and/or reduced benefits, while the costs of living have soared. It \nis a very difficult future for so many.\n\nSo, if you have credit cards, pay them off as soon as possible. If you \nsurvived the last one and hold a mortgage lock it in, save money. \nCurrencies could collapse, especially the \u20ac, the US $, and the Chinese \u00a5 \nare all under extreme pressures, so I would suggest India's \u20b9.\n\nThe next period will be difficult, Energy prices will soar, but we must \ncontinue to stress education, especially financial stabilisation and \nlanguage.
