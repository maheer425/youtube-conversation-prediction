Consumer CPUs have been hovering \naround 4 (maybe 5) GHz for a few years now. (That's most of the reason for \nthe multicore boom.)\n\nEdit: Looked up some stuff. Graphene transistors can theoretically run at \nover 400 GHz. It looks to be a good decade or two away, but we're making \nprogress.

(Please do not suggest clean room or vacuum room for graphene \nsynthesis because the machinery involved would be so large that it has to \nbe massive and massive clean room or vacuum room. Also making either of \nthem would require so much money to build and maintain that which ever \nmoronic company wants it can go swim in a pool full of mails from debt \ncollectors.\n\nAlso your method of using conveyor belt... And tape... Yeah not gonna work.\n\nWhat you are suggesting is slightly less impractical than using particle \naccelerator to convert energy into matter for industrial use, which is \nimpossible due to energy consumption from the process and creating over a \ngram of anything in particle accelerator take ridiculous time.\n\nYour solution seems obvious, but there is a reason why genius in south \nkorea proposed copper/carbon sheet sandwich method using rollers and \nhydrocarbon coatings. Which can make large sheet of graphene. \n\nAnother method involves silicon/germanium and hydrogen method which uses \nacid dipped germanium coated wafer and chemical vapor deposition method to \ncreate thin layer of graphene. It shows extremely little imperfection as \nwell.\n\nAlso, no future has not been so underwhelming, it looks like it because \nmorons around the world wants to make something that kills something more \nthan anything and are putting relatively little funding to other \nresearches. Moreover there has been many more discoveries but people does \nnot look for them such as most people who have access to internet didn't \nknow we found a boson particle in 2012 because no body cared to look into \nit.",

                    "text": "The answer is kind of complicated, and it's hard for me to explain easily \nwithout writing like 3 or 4 paragraphs. Basically, when you grow, your \ncells divide, and because your cells are dividing, DNA has to be replicated \nor copied. When the DNA is copied, mistakes can be made, and some genetic \ncodes will be missing in each copy. Eventually, you might be missing the \ngenetic code of making your skin smooth, causing wrinkles in the skin. \nAfter a while, some of the most important information will be lost, like \nhow to even reproduce the cell. So, cells die, and your body can't create \nmore to replace them, and then your body shuts down. First, you stop \nbreathing, your heart stops beating. For the next 4-6, you are still able \nto be revived, but after those 4-6 minutes, your brain starts shutting down \nand you are dead. You can't be revived. The people that die at a really old \nage, like 85-100 something years old have these \"fake\" pieces of genetic \ncode at the end of their DNA (like the plastic on your shoelaces) called \ntelomeres, and when the genetic code is lost, the telomeres are lost \ninstead of the important stuff, letting the person live longer. There is a \nsubstance called telomerase which lets us create more telomeres, making us \n\"immortals\", but the problem with telomerase is that there's a huge chance \nthat it will cause diseases like cancer. So instead of dying of old age, we \ndie of a disease. This is how I learned it, so other people might have a \ndifferent answer. Sorry for the long answer, it's a pretty complicated \nsubject.",

Eventually this starts effecting the nervous, circulatory, and \ncardiovascular systems in your body which also explains why seniors aren't \nas flexible, fast, and tend to be more prone to diseases and memory loss. \nSo if you are talking about death by age, it's most likely because your \nnervous system stops functioning.",
