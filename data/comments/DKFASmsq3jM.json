So I'll correct the errors you made.\n\n1. The proper spelling for the word Insensative is 'Insensitive'. There is \nno 'a' in that word.\n\n2. While still technically correct, the use of the word 'sapient' where it \nwas used seems out of place. I can tell you were consciously trying to add \nmore obscure words to your sentence, ironically and presumably to push your \nown sapience :p\n\n2. Sentience, just like 'Insensitive' has no 'a' in it.\n\n3.Furthermore, I am even more aware that you are literally just throwing \nrandom words into a pot, because the remainder of that entire sentence is \nabsolutely inconsequential. For future reference, don't try to push the \nillusion of intelligence. I'm not saying you aren't intelligent, but as it \nstands you are being what I'd deem a 'tryhard'.",

I do want to explain \nmyself though. I live on the boarder between North & south... Where I live \nwe call them 'the north' & 'the south' rather than always saying 'Northern \nIreland' & 'The Republic of Ireland'. I choose to label myself as being \nIrish as is the right for anyone in Northern Ireland; one can be Irish, \nBritish, both or Northern Irish. So that shouldn't be an issue for anyone. \nAlso when I refer to this place being Ireland I do that for many reasons; \n1. Ireland as a while island 2. Many other people not in Ireland or the UK \nare not aware that Northern Ireland is a thing so rather than confusing \nthem & by appealing to most other people that's why I decided to use \n'Ireland'. I have lots of friends who I met in the university I was talking \nabout, they call themselves British &/or Northern Irish. From talking with \nthem they see Northern Ireland as it's own country rather than being part \nof the UK or Ireland but would be more comfortable with saying it's part of \nthe UK. I agree Northern Ireland is a different country to the Republic, \nbut we aren't part of Britain at all, yes the UK but also we are part of \nthe island of Ireland. I am open to what other people think but I never \nwant to offend anyone. Also the myths & legends attached to Giants Causeway \nare Irish ones, created when Ireland was all one country; featuring Irish \ncharacters & some Scottish ones. I hope I have made myself clear about \nwhere I stand & that I am accepting of what other people think :D I hope \nyou 2 have a great day :D",

The truth is what is actually incredibly \nentertaining, but unfortunately  fear based mentalities like yours would be \ntoo pussy to watch the film END GAME. \n\nAnd I write as fast as I can think so if you're amazed by the number of \nlines in my comments, that is pretty funny.

I insulted a game that you play (minecraft) and said only 12 year \nolds play it. I then got absolutely blasted with a paragraph of how it's \ndefinitely not my opinion that it's a bad game, I'm just \"here to \ncompensate for my denied yet obvious false sense of confidence\" or it's a \n\"painfully obvious attempt to hide my insecurities\". It literally sounds \nlike you're trying to quote the teacher that taught you bullying is bad. \n\"They probably have problems at home\". Please, red this multiple times so \nit finally hits home, Minecraft is a bad game, it is infested with tons of \nlittle kids playing it now. Yes, you seem to have figured out that the \ndefinition for that statement is an \"opinion\" but since that is the general \nconsensus now, I'm speaking on behalf of a majority of people my own age, \nas soon as youtubers started broadcasting it, the average Minecraft \nplayer's age decreased drastically. It's a fact, my brother and I now \ndislike it, but my youngest brother (9) and all his friends adore it. This \nis a fact, it is not me \"projecting my insecurities\" or whatever shit you \nthink sounds like it makes sense. Stop fanboying a fucking bad game that \neveryone else your age got bored of years ago. Then again, you refused to \nanswer my question when I inquired as to whether you're over 12, so I'm not \nactually sure. Please stop fucking replying with your bitchy fanboyism. \n\"Bashing me over the internet\". God, that line literally makes me picture \nyou as the \"leave Britney alone!\" kid, your replies are all so bitchy with \nthis \"don't tell me what to do!\" attitude. If you really believe that your \nbeliefs are your own, and not affected by anyone around you or on the \ninternet, don't reply. Just don't. But since I know I'm right, you will. :)",
