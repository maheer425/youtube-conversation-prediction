Maybe not, but then it isn't fair that this kid probably grew up \nin a mansion, & you or I did not, that is just how money works\n3)Much has been made about how the black kid was treated more harshly for a \nlower body count,, well that's not how the law works, the records are \nsealed, and you know nothing of the details of the other case, perhaps the \nother kid had a long history of violence, or the attack was particularly \npremeditated or violent, or perhaps the kid was completely unrepentant at \ntrial,many factors could have affected the outcome of that trial\n4)Again the laws does not necessarily look at consequences, but at \nintention, that's why attempted murder is a crime, and killing in self \ndefence is not, similarly drunk driving, while grossly negligent is not a \nmalicious act, beating someone up is, \n5)Again, the affluenza argument was unfortunate, but then again, he was a \n16 year old kid, just because his parents were wealthy, doesn't mean that \nhis parents were good parents, the responsibility argument may have been a \nvaild defence, completely separate from the \"affluenza\"\n6)The most perfunctory of arguments, Jailing this kid won't bring the other \n4 people back\ufeff",

It was not intended to be used this way.\nNow no doubt you are not interested in what it actually was intended to be \nused for and will keep replying as if how it was used in this case bears a \nresemblance to how it was used by the person that invented the term, and \nsomehow thinking you are more left wing and liberal than the guy who made \nit up because you are so incredibly stubborn that you did not wish to \nunderstand that a way of claiming our society is to consumerist and needs \nto change has been misused by someone that doesn't want to take \nresponsibility.\nI have explained what it meant, you carried on using it as the kid in this \ncase did, and implying the psychologist Oliver James who is left wing is \nsomehow into the idea rich kids are not responsible for their actrions \nwhich he never said. So there is no need fo the term for poor kids because \nit was being used out of context and had nothing to do with rich people in \nparticular but western consumerist society as a whole, not the rich but \neverybody, and basically it applies to the less well off in this society as \nwell.",
