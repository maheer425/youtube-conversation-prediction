I am a heterosexual male.  \nBut for about 6 years of my life, I was raped repeatedly.

So I tend to agree \nwith Lilith's point of view in that some people are really mentally ill.  \nGranted you also have quite a few very valid points.  Many people are just \nspoiled and want what they want, when they want it.\n\nThe most important thing I wish to convey is this though.  After being in \nthose situations for so many years, where it also became 'normal' to me, I \nobviously needed to get hep.  Lilith is right about the brainwashing people \nhave about victim blaming, instead of being responsible for the situations \nI put myself in.  In all my therapy, I was given one gem, that is \ndeep-seated in me now.  I can control everything I do, but I cannot control \nothers. And if I don't want something bad to happen to me, don't put myself \nin risky situations.  By no means does this alleviate guilt by the \nperpetrator, but I have to take responsibility for my part as well.  I \ncan't die because my parachute doesn't open if I never skydive in the first \nplace.  Risk taking behaviour is like gambling, You might get away with it \nfor a while, but one day you'll lose.  And there is no behaviour analytics \nagency or government board that I have ever heard of that doesn't \ncategorize drinking as risk taking behaviour. \n\nYou say her blood alcohol is .13 so people were pouring drinks down her \nthroat because she was too drunk to stop herself?  how did she get too \ndrunk to say no to more drinks in the first place?\n\nYou say she was too young to know better?  Then why the heck did she know \nabout the drinking party beforehand?  Why did she plan on going to it, \nbetray the trust of her parents, sneak out, consume booze with boys she \nfelt were popular and cute, then expect those boys to carry the burden of \nresponsibility for her well-being instead of her being responsible for \nherself?  If she's a minor, doesn't that put the burden of responsibility \non the parents to keep her out of dangerous situations?\n\nThose guys need to pay for what they did.  But by the same token, she needs \nto have a LOT of priviledges removed from her for a while until she learns \nto act responsibly.  The tax payers shouldn't be footing the bill for \npeople acting like idiots, getting hammered, then getting into trouble.  \nThe boys were drunk too obviously, and obviously minors.  So obviously they \nweren't making good decisions themselves.\n\nOne last point, sorry for the length of this post...\n\nWhen I was raped so many times anally, and forced to perform fellatio, it \ncaused medical damage, pain, and humiliation...thus trauma, because I WAS \nAWAKE AND TOTALLY COGNISANT.  If I was passed out, the trauma is MUCH \nsmaller.  If I had open heart surgery while awake, it would be \nsignificantly different, than under anesthesia, and yes, these are \ncomparable allegorical statements.  The boys were idiots, and did something \nvery wrong, she was an idiot and got herself into a very bad situation.  \nEveryone f*d up in this situation.  Not victim blaming, but asserting \neveryone is responsible for their own actions and it's absurd to think \nothers are responsible for my well-being, and I am under no onus to take \ncare of myself.\n\nSo asserting that Lilith should get some help because she experiences her \nsituation differently than you is very condescending, derogatory, and \nchildish.  She may not have worded her arguments very well much of the \ntime, but after your traumatic experience you seem not to have grasped the \nconcept of personal culpability.  People should be allowed to do whatever \nthey want and if something goes wrong it's someone else's fault.  You \nprobably think you should be allowed to put your baby in a bear pen at the \nzoo, then if something bad happens, the bear should be put down and \npunished.  Sexual congress is part of human nature, heck it's in every \nliving thing's nature, and booze lowers our inhibitions and ability to \nreason, SO DON'T DRINK IF YOU AREN'T IN A SAFE PLACE TO DO SO.  And if you \ndo, in a dangerous environment, as this was, don't flutter your eyes and \nsay how innocent you were and how traumatized you are...One, she was \nsupposedly asleep, and couldn't feel anything, or recall the event, thank \ngoodness, or that coould have been really traumatic...Two, having noting to \ndo with rape, did the prosecutor charge her or fine her for underage \ndrinking?  Sounds like both got away with a lot.  Or do we forget about her \nillegal drinking because she had potentially non-consentual sex, I wasn't \nthere, so I don't know what the real situation was.  Would her drinking \nhave been considered more serious if she hadnt been raped?  Would anyone \nhave done anything about it then.  It happened before the purported rape, \nnot after, so she put herself in a situation when she couldn't make \nrational decisions.  She was not surruptitiously drugged.  She drugged \nherself.  He took advantage of that.  punish them both, or neither at \nall....\n\nI strongly believe that the prosecutor didn't drop the case so he could get \na free buffet at Sizzler from the kids family....\n\nMy two cents, I'm sure many disagree, but it's only my opinion, I chose to \nshare it as you were being very condescending towards Lilith, and I found \nit very important that she is aware that there are rational thinking people \nthat also support her view of being responsible for your own actions \ninstead of expecting everyone else to act on a higher level than we do \nourselves, and expecting others to protect and care for us because we \nshouldn't have to be careful for our own actions.\n\nI can't wait to get pulled over drunk driving and when the cop asks me \nwhat's going on I'll just say I wasn't going to drive I most certainly \ndidn't want to, but the bartender kept giving me drinks after I was too \ndrunk to stop, and then my blood alchohol was so high I couldn't make good \ndecisions, so he took advantage of me and coerced me into spending all the \nmoney I had for a taxi, instead spending it on his booze because I didn't \nknow better at that point.  It was too cold outside to sleep in the park \nbecause I had no money left, and far too far to walk.  So it's not my fault \nI'm trying to drive. \n\nLogically, it is not different.  No offense is meant toward anyone \nsuffering from events like these, as I have too so I understand.  But that \ndoesn't give us the right to charge people.  if she doesn't remember \nanything, how does she know who actually raped her?  The video?  Before \nthat, how did she know that the guy wasn't drunk too and that she didn't \ntry and mount him?  Her blood alchohol was .13 so she was unconscious you \nsay?  So at a blood alchohol of .13 how did she walk into the hospital \ncognisant and awake?  How did she coherently explain to her mother that her \ngenitalia hurt?  Drunk driving charges sometimes have that BAC (lood \nAlchohol Level) or higher and they ar functional, just clumsy.  The boy \nwasn't tested, was he sober or any less impaired?  There are a lot of \nquestions, no one should judge that wasn't there until all of the \ninformation is present.",

Just because a person doesn't address all victims when \nrelating to a story doesn't mean they are not appalled by male rape. We \nhave come a long way in society, but it hurts me to see how far we have to \ngo. Many men who have been sexually abused or raped have talked to me. We \nhave yet to foster an environment in our society and its constructs that is \nsupportive of survivors, regardless of gender. In fact, I acknowledge men \nhave it the worst. When including prison rape, and one must, I know its \nprojected that it's highly possible that MORE men than women have been \nraped. Also, of ALL the people I have talked to who have experienced CSA or \nrape, only two people reported; I was one of them. The other was a young \ntwelve-year-old boy. When he told me, we were twelve and fourteen. His dad \nwas an attorney. He told his family immediately, and his assailant was \nserving time, though not nearly enough. I also know of a man who was \nfalsely accused, so to speak. She lied about her age. Feeling so sickened \nhe had been with a fifteen-year-old, he was full of self-recrimination and \nself-blame that he pled guilty and will remain on the sex offender \nregistry. All that said, if you are a survivor, it must be horrible to see \nand experience the societal differences when speaking to male sexual \nassault. It is surely never funny. The prevalence of jokes is despicable. \nAlso, I am not personally aware of another survivor, male or female, who \ntakes male sexual assault less seriously. Just know, please, that usually \nthose impassioned about the rape of a girl/woman would feel just as \nimpassioned about the rape of a boy/man in the same circumstances.\nFighting for all people to be equal and free of violence.",
