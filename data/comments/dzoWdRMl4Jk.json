Francis is just harkening back to that and saying that, \"hey, \nunfettered capitalism is no good; it runs off of vicious greed, and it \nincentivizes violence and oppression.\" He's only doing as much as any other \nPope has done in the past. And further more; religion is hardly a \npowerfully moving thing if it DOESN'T affect your politics and economics, \nright? I mean, the reason many Catholics try so hard against abortion is \nbecause we BELIEVE it to be wrong. If we didn't believe it to be wrong, we \nwouldn't ACT against it. Thus, religion affects political practice. In the \nsame vain, the Pope is saying that a capitalism that feeds itself by \nharming human dignity is morally corrupt, and ought not be practiced. When \nVulture Capitalists can literally extort and hold hostage the entire nation \nof Argentina, we can be well assured that this form of unfettered \nCapitalism has gone too far, and become a beast straight out of revelation. \nIt seems to me, that the Pope is just doing what Popes do: pointing out \ngrievances and atrocities against humanity and human dignity wherever it \nexists; in other words, \"Poping\"",

Of those in one of the quintiles 2-4 in 1996, \napproximately 35% stayed in the same quintile; and approximately 22% went \nup one quintile or down one quintile (moves of more than one quintile are \nrarer). 39% of those who were born into the top quintile as children in \n1968 are likely to stay there, and 23% end up in the fourth quintile.[3] \nChildren previously from lower-income families had only a 1% chance of \nhaving an income that ranks in the top 5%.[5] On the other hand, the \nchildren of wealthy families have a 22% chance of reaching the top 5%\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility\n\n\n\nand most importantly \n\nwhy shouldn't that job pay a wage you can live on? if you are working hard, \nshouldn't you be able to take care of yourself? what kind of \"perfect\" (as \nyou claim) system is that?\n\n\"employer is doing you a favour for giving you a job no matter what the pay\"\n\nso it would be a favor to give you no other option but to work for nearly \nnothing, or not have work, (with more 800% income disparity between CEO's \nand the people actually doing the work to make them their profit)\n\nyou just confirmed my claim that capitalism is like slavery to the working \npoor. \n\naccording to capitalism corporations are people. according to you, \ncapitalism cant get extreme. \ntoo big(rich) to fail? capitalism IS extreme\nhow is it any different then aristocracy?\n\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism\n\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of the United States, said \"I hope \nwe shall crush ... in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed \ncorporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of \nstrength and bid defiance to the laws of our country\"\n\n capitalism has no care for the people. its main interest is profit. which \non its own is horrendous and extreme. \n\nno sytem on its own is perfect. no system is above being extreme and unfair\n\nsocialism in extreme becomes communism\ncapitalism extremes become...FASCISM.(money=absolute power)",

Lol, no I still love this Pope, but \nhe's factually incorrect. 1st of all, the church has no room to talk shit. \nI gets MAJOR kickbacks, it's tax expemt, and they pass the offering plate \naround every Sunday. I think it's even in the bible that you're supposed to \n\"tithe\" 10% of your earnings to the Church. My dad does that, and it drives \nme nuts. That's a lot of money that could help a lot of people rather than \nfunding the local mega church.\n\nMore to the point this is a market economy. The firms don't lord over the \nconsumers, the consumers actually dictate the firms. Supply and demand, \nremember, the consumers do the demanding. Competition drives prices down. \n(this is really basic stuff, the pope skipped macroecon 101 to text \nJesus everyday I bet). And a thriving business will pay it's workers far \nmore than a failing one. Save for Wal-Mart, but we all hate Wal-Mart.\n\nBelieve it or not the firms (the corporations) *want* you, the consumer to \nget rich. The disparity between the 1%, the upper middle class, the lower \nmiddle class, and \"the expendable leftovers\" can't be explained by one \nthing. The real estate collapse had a lot to do with it. Fractional reserve \nbanking had a lot to do with it. Technology had a lot to do with it. Greed \non the part of SOME individual companies had a lot to do with it. All the \ndisasters between 9/11, Katrina, and the war had a lot to do with it. And \nthen some of this is just cyclical.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a hands off the insible hand conservative nut, \nan economy can't succeed without regulation. *but* Capitalism, throughout \nhistory, has proven to be the most effective economic system, no?\ufeff",

                "text": "Where do we have an absolute autonomy of the market? How can a completely \nunregulated market be responsible for anything when no such market even \nexists anywhere? And please don't say Somalia, because Somalia became a \ndisaster while under state control, and then its state collapsed. Citing \nSomalia as a failure of freedom is like citing a former smoker with cancer \nas an example of why it's bad to quit smoking.\n\nAlso, even if I were to grant you Somalia, that wouldn't explain how \"an \nabsolute autonomy of the market\" is responsible for anything going on in \nthe US, or any of the other parts of the world where people claim that \nwealth inequality is a problem; since we don't have \"an absolute autonomy \nof the market\" in those places. But then, I guess I shouldn't be surprised \nthat the Pope would think something that doesn't exist should take credit \nfor the way the world is.\n\nAlso, why is wealth inequality bad? The more equal everyone is in wealth, \nthe worse off everyone is. Suppose that everyone had $1 million. Everyone \nwould be as equal as they could possibly be, but we'd all be poor, because \n$1 million would be worth next to nothing due to the fact that everyone had \nit.\n\nLastly, I have a question for anyone who is a theist who also claims to \nbelieve that the well off should help those in need. How do rationalize the \nfact that God supposedly has unlimited power and is capable of doing \nanything he wants, yet people who need help still exist? If it's moral for \nthe well off to help those in need, shouldn't God help everyone in need? \nGod's resources are unlimited. No one is more well off than God. He's the \nultimate rich guy. He could end poverty, feed all the hungry, cure every \ndisease, and end all suffering, and it wouldn't cost him anything, because, \nas I said, his resources are unlimited. So why doesn't he do that? And, if \nit's immoral for the well off to refuse to help those in need, then \nwouldn't that make God immoral?\ufeff",

You're absolutely \nright that God is the ultimate rich guy, Jesus says so quite candidly: \"In \nmy father's house there are many mansions.\" John 14:2. He goes on to say \nthat he is going to prepare a place for us and receive us there - it's a \npromise, a covenant. But he also warns that we have a choice of whether we \nstore our treasure in heaven or on earth (one might quibble here that some \nof us don't have any treasure on earth to store, but Jesus has some things \nto say for those people as well).\n\nObviously, you're under no obligation to believe in the existence of an \nafterlife, which changes the calculus considerably.

They send in Brazilians \nto work the mines, then send them home with OUR massive paychecks, and \nspend the money in Brazil. So explain to me how companies paying foreign \nworkers money out of the Canadian economy so they can spend it on the \nBrazilian economy helps my city, or me, at all? I'll tell you how: it \ndoesn't. I'm a chef, you'd think I'd see a decent portion of the money, \nconsidering these guys make close to $100,000 a year fresh out of college, \nyet I don't, because they go out and buy McDonalds, then go home to their \nown country and spend it there. Brazil may be a South American country, but \nit's FAR from poor. They have a stronger economy and stronger banks than \nthe US, mostly because they don't spend dick all of their own money there. \n\nLastly, income tax? Do you have any idea HOW to attract companies to open \nin your country? By offering them tax cuts, and subsidiaries. It'll cost \nyou more to get them here than having them here will make you. Why? Greed, \nthat's why. And they're all run by assholes like +MetalDetroit who think \nthey should just receive a paycheck for waking up every morning.",

My History \nProf, a Greek Orthodox Libertarian, suggested him to me when I was asking \nabout how a Christian could possibly be Libertarian. Thanks for the \nreminder.\n\nI did not mean to distort what you wrote. It just seems to me that Jesus \nteaching has massive economic financial implications, at least on an \nindividual and personal level, if not on a governmental level. I am greatly \ngrieved by Protestant churches evangelizing under the guise of missionary \naid, putting so-called \"biblical\" belief over real life humans in actual \npoverty and suffering. I see the Catholic Church as the single candle in \nthe world that freely loves these people; not threatening them with Hell if \nthey do not 'know' Jesus, thereby coercing them into the Church, like I've \nseen in so many protestant missions.\n\nI'd question that economics is a purely earthly matter, as the book of \nrevelation seems to paint economics in very spiritual, and even worshipful, \nterms. Of course, this is my Mennonite background's interpretation of \nrevelation, and not necessarily a Catholic one. Far be it from me to \npresume as to what scripture means.\n\nThanks much.",

                    "text": "+Tanaka Adria The difference is the Church has always been about love, not \ncondemnation. Here's what the Church has to say about homosexuality and I \ncompletely agree:\n\n<< 2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who \nexperience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of \nthe same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries \nand in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely \nunexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual \nacts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \n\"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\"142 They are contrary to the \nnatural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not \nproceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no \ncircumstances can they be approved.\n\n\n2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies \nis not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, \nconstitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, \ncompassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their \nregard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in \ntheir lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the \nLord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n\n2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of \nself-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of \ndisinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and \nshould gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection. >>\n\nUnlike what the liberal media would have people believe, The Church teaches \nthat a person is not a just label of thoughts, inclinations or choices, but \nan adoptive son or daughter of God; a human is a body, a mind and an \nimortal soul and has the free will to choose between good and lack thereof.\n\nThe media completely ignores this teaching and claims the Church hates \npeople instead of the sinful acts. These forementioned teachings prove that \nthe Church does not hate people who are afflicted by homosexual thoughts \nand inclinations.\n\nI once heard on the radio that there was a gay couple who adopted a child, \nlater became Catholic and chose to live the rest of their lives in \nchastity, helping their community. They finally invited Jesus into their \nlives who helped them carry their cross, they are now chaste and in \ncommunion with the Church. At the end of his testimony he said:\n\"I lost a lot of friends who also have a homosexual inclination when I \nchose to become Catholic and live my life in chastity with my former \npartner. The radical homosexuals do not speak for most people witht their \ninclination, I always knew those acts weren't right but did them anyway \nthinking that it will compensate for the pain I endured in my past. When I \nfound the Church teaching about homosexuality, I knew we couldn't live like \nthat anymore, I approached my partner about the courage and RCIA program, \nhe protested at first but the more we prayed the rosary, and talked about \nGod, the more Mary brought us closer to her son and the more chastity made \nsense so after a while we took the next step and became devout chaste \nCatholics, going to confession and communion regularly. That was 20 years \nago, I've never regretted it and I am happier than ever.\"\n\nCatholics cannot force God on people, we sew seeds of hope, the Holy Spirit \ndoes the rest.\n\nThe program he took with his friend is called courage, here's the website \nif you want to hear more testimonies:\n\nhttp://couragerc.net/",

                "text": "As an anti-theist *a la* Hitchens, I have to say that this pope is \nsurprising me as well. I would rather see the Catholic church dismantled, \nas well as other religious organizations, but if he's fighting the good \nfight and concentrating on important humanist issues, then I have much, \nmuch, less of a problem with him.\n\nFor those who are commenting that he should be doing something about these \nthings: I think that he actually is. I've actually read the paper released \na few days ago (and yes, it is very long), and he calls for massive changes \nin the church, including changes on issues which were previously dogmatic \nand never thought to be changed. He has called a special council for \ndiscussion and reform, and I believe he actually means it. Of course, we'll \nhave to see what he does in the future, but we all know that changes in the \nchurch take epochs in general. As it is, he's as much of a revolutionary as \nwe'll ever see in the church today and I believe he truly means what he \nsays. Even though he could technically rule by fiat and change everything \novernight, he knows full well that it wouldn't simply be accepted and would \nform another rift. If he's going to change the church, a rift isn't going \nto change anything but harden the stance of those dissenters and will \naccomplish nothing.\n\nNo, I think he's doing something wise: he's trying to change the \nconversation and forcing people to discuss the issues which are important, \nand trying to get them to see the humanist side which he apparently truly \nbelieves in. And if he's able to get a consensus, then change will follow.\n\nSo I'm in the wait and see mode. I do, however, have high hopes for this \npope. He may not live long enough to see all the changes which he wishes to \nenact, but he appears to be setting the tone, pace, and discussion for \nyears to come. Perhaps that is his ultimate goal: to change the entire tone \nfor the long run so that the next pope will have no choice but to go along \nwith it, and future popes thereafter.\n\nBy the way, for those who point out that the vatican has been accused \nseveral times of money laundering and close ties with the mafia, this new \npope has already angered many in the vatican by lashing out against this \nand saying that there will be no more of that. So much so that a few \narticles have been written about how the mafia has found itself in a very \nbad spot all of a sudden with what lies ahead in their financial stakes \nwithin the vatican. He appears to be ready to take that corruption on as \nwell and, some think, could be risking his life in doing so. It's not a \ncompletely idle threat, so I believe that he is truly genuine in his \nhumanist activism.\n\nWe'll see what he brings in the future. But I don't recall reading about \nsuch an active pope since the middle ages, nor do I recall reading about \nsuch a pope who has made such provocatively humanist statements in the \nentire history of the church.\ufeff",

My guess is that Jesus \nwouldn't want much taxes at all! It's used for so much evil, and probably \nmore so than good, lets honestly face the facts. Taxes means that there's a \ngroup of people who are so easily corrupted because they set the rules. \nThey get paid to subsidize corn and meat so we can afford it (which both \ncontribute to being the leading causes of Diabetes and coronary disease \n(further requiring MORE money in healthcare expenditures)), whereas \notherwise it would be you the individual in power in which natural fruits, \nnuts and seeds would be what you could afford making you so much healthier, \nand allowing this industry to grow thereby lowering the costs even further! \nThey just can't compete right now! This happens with fossil fuels, health \ncare, education... the list goes on and they're screwing you! Some may have \ngood intentions, but they're paving a road to hell as we are seeing. Their \nrole needs to solely be about preserving liberty and the freedoms from \nabuse in which I extend this to people, animals and the environment (in \nterms of health of ecosystems to support life). We all have the image of an \nevil CEO - whom are real - with many slaves working. This gives such \nmassive opportunities for competition as people will flock to work where \nthey can get enough money to actually buy more products. If this new \ncompany is stopped, assassinated or whatever, then the government and \npeople can directly fight back with this person.  In which by getting into \na group and working with others pulling in your resources is what will give \nyou even more power. It will allow for new industries to form in which will \nhelp people! If heroin were legal, sure, some people may take other \npeople's liberties and get them addicted. This is terrible, and the person \nwho does so should be positively reinforced through MDMA or LSD use until \nthey no longer take other people's liberties. But after this, there'll be \nan industry that finds a way to profit from helping these people! It'll be \na win-win. I believe we are our own masters of our fate, and I believe if \nyou work hard to cut down a tree that you are allowed to do as you think \nbest with it (so long as it still preserves the liberties of all). You may \nchoose to do so because you will be able to trade it for something you may \nwant/need or because you like the person, but for someone to come in and \ntake some makes them a bully, and it takes away your god given right to \nfreedom, no matter what they believe to be right. This is my thought at \nthis point in time, I did my best here and I'm open to all \nideas/suggestions. I hope you don't get angry or frustrated as I'm just \nhere to honestly help with everyone, and the world we live on. Use \nthorium. \ufeff",

The company \nselected consignees in Boston, New York, Charleston, and Philadelphia, and \n500,000 pounds of tea were shipped across the Atlantic in September.\nUnder pressure from Patriot groups, the consignees in Charleston, New York, \nand Philadelphia refused to accept the tea shipments, but in Boston, the \nchosen merchants (including two of Governor Thomas Hutchinson's sons as \nwell as his nephew) refused to concede. The first tea ship, Dartmouth, \nreached Boston November 27, and two more arrived shortly thereafter. \nMeanwhile, several mass meetings were held to demand that the tea be sent \nback to England with the duty unpaid. Tension mounted as Patriot groups led \nby Samuel Adams tried to persuade the consignees and then the governor to \naccept this approach. On December 16, a large meeting at the Old South \nChurch was told of Hutchinson's final refusal. About midnight, watched by a \nlarge crowd, Adams and a small group of Sons of Liberty disguised as Mohawk \nIndians boarded the ships and jettisoned the tea. To Parliament, the Boston \nTea Party confirmed Massachusetts's role as the core of resistance to \nlegitimate British rule. The Coercive Acts of 1774 were intended to punish \nthe colony in general and Boston in particular, both for the Tea Party and \nfor the pattern of resistance it exemplified.\"\nThe Reader's Companion to American History.

The \nCommunism you're describing is the policy of countries controlled by \nCommunist Parties. Their particular ideology was usually Stalinism or \nMaoism (different flavors of Bolshevism). They believed the State could be \nused to redistribute Capitalism into Socialism and then into Communism. \nThat was Lenin's interpretation of Marx's \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" \nmaxim (of course evidence shows their interpretation was likely WAY \ndifferent from Marx's). They never proclaimed to have achieved communism, \nthey claimed to be in transition towards it. Some other communist \nideologies, like anarcho-communism, propose that the State can never create \na communistic society and that it can only be reached with the abolition of \nthe state along with capitalism.\n\nAnarchism itself is compatible with communism but it is also compatible \nwith other economic systems like socialism, collectivism, individualism and \nGeorgism. Some argue it's compatible with capitalism \n(\"anarcho-capitalism\"), but I largely disagree with the latter. I think \nit's only compatible with capitalism if capitalism gets rid of most of its \ninvoluntary hierarchy and free from the influence of monopolies, \noligopolies and cartels, and people are free to renegotiate or leave \ncontracts. Basically it would have to change to the point of becoming very \nsimilar to Individualist Anarchism (which is an anarchistic flavor of \nMarket Socialism), it would barely be capitalism anymore. \n\nPersonally I'm a Libertarian Socialist and I tend to be non-partisan \ntowards different varieties of socialism and communism. I like your idea \nabout how wealth need not be solely classified as capital or monetary \nresources. I think as economies and societies become more advanced in the \nfuture expanding the definition of \"wealth\" will become very important, \neven vital. Thanks for sharing your viewpoints with me.",

Similar to public \nparks or international waters. Fits pretty well with anarchism - a \nstateless, classless society with minimal hierarchy. What people generally \ncall \"Communism\" is actually Bolshevism or Stalinism. The policy of the \nCommunist Parties of the Soviet Union and China and their allies. \nBolshevism is (self-admittedly, from Vlad Lenin's own mouth) actually a \nform of \"State Capitalism\" (where the government acts as a single monopoly \ncapitalist owning all means of production and determining wages and \ndistribution of produce). He claimed their society was a \"transitional\" \nstage between Capitalism and Socialism. Bolsheviks (and Marxists in \ngeneral) believe you have to gradually transition from Capitalism to \nSocialism to Communism. Different Marxists disagree on how. \nAnarcho-communists believe in a direct transition from Capitalism to \nCommunism with no state-guidance or takeover. They believe the State is \nanother instrument of class society like private monopoly of capital/means \nof production (Capitalism).",
