They say if you get a \ntattoo on your inner forearm then it's pretty sensitive but in a spot like \nyour upper arm near your shoulder than that's pretty bearable for most \npeople. It all depends on your pain threshold and everyone has a different \nlevel of tolerance for pain BUT it also depends on the area as well. The \nupper arm tends to usually have more fat and the more fat you have on an \narea, the less it tends to hurt where else a bony area will hurt worse. To \nsay the least, I think you'll be good. The feeling is not the most \ncomfortable for some people but there are people that get tattoos and most \nare covered with them all over. If the pain was too much to bear than most \npeople wouldn't do it. In fact, it can get pretty addicting. I wish you \ngood luck!",

But one is \nmore CULTURALLY acceptable than the other. (assume caps in this are \nitalics, not yelling)\n\nre: the man you referenced with the sunburst tattoo. That's exactly what I \nmean. I do agree, a lot of the time tattoos can be tacky, poor taste, and \nto fit in. But tasteful tattoos are on the rise, but people still insist \nthat any and all tattoos are bad, on principle. I feel like we're actually \npretty close to saying the same thing. But it seems that you're advocating \nnegativity, and I'm trying to advocate positivity.\n\n\"they are failing to study what makes attractive people, attractive.\"\n\nOr, they do not share the opinion that everyone should have the same beauty \nstandards. \"What makes attractive people\" is different for different \ncultures, and can fluctuate based on a person's beliefs and background. \nThis doesn't necessarily make one perception in that field better than the \nother. Some people would rather someone have long hair. Some would rather \nthey have dark hair, some light. Some prefer people with tans, some prefer \npeople pale (not connected to racism). Some people look at tattoos and go \n\"that's attractive,\" other people go \"NO. THAt'S NOT. HOW CAN YOU THINK SO \nWHEN IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT.\" And that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nFor an example - like I said before, I like a \"classy\" kind of style, so I \nhave a tattoo of a teacup, which is somewhere I can choose to be visible or \nnot. Judging by what I've read, (correct me if I'm wrong) you promote \npeople having preconceptions about me, my judgement, and my character, \nbased on the statement \"I have a tattoo,\" because \"the majority of people \nwith tattoos are --\" and without other factors. It would be wrong for an \nemployer to ask me if I have any tattoos at all, and using that as a basis \nwhether or not I'll be a good employee, without any other factors. \n\nPeople remove tattoos for a variety of reasons. Some of them are that they \nwere impatient, didn't pay for good work or, like you said, they wanted to \nfit in. If a person can avoid these things, and still have a tattoo, they \nshouldn't be treated like they have those qualities anyway for the simple \nfact they put an image under their skin. Also, tattoo \"removal\" can be used \nto lighten poorly done tattoos, so a similar image can be used to cover it. \nSuch as if someone had a cheap tattoo done at 18, but it didn't come out \nwell. They might lighten it to 50%, then go to a better artist to put a \nsimilar, much better quality image over the top.\n\nI think I may be running out of words to describe this? I agree, a lot of \ntattoos are badly done, in poor taste, and show character flaws of the \nperson. But it's not because of the possession of a tattoo, it's because of \nvariables. People should not be treated a certain way because they possess \na tattoo, but what variables come into play.\n\nIf I say \"there are ten people here, eight of them are tattooed.\" Certain \ngroups of people will insist that means 8/10 people should not be hired, \nand are unprofessional and make poor choices. But then if you look deeper \nand find that 4/8 people have tattoos like the man you described - custom \ndesigned, well thought out, and for themselves even if it shows, there are \npeople who would ignore that with a knee-jerk \"BUT TATTOOS.\" That's what \nI'm trying to get at. \n\n\"Being classy is my teenage rebellion.\" - R.

                    "text": "Hmm.\n\nMy remark about gender roles was just another instance of   people failing \nto see the importance of inborn, genetically determined behaviors. Blaming \nthe negative reaction to tattoos on social conditioning is another example \nof that paradigm blindness.\n\nI can appreciate that it's hard to get your mind around the idea that there \nis an automatic, instinctual aversion on the part of some people against \ntattooing. It makes it impossible for you to blame other people and call \nthem narrow minded when they don't like tattoos: \u201cA man should look for \nwhat is, and not for what he thinks should be.\u201d  \n -Einstein\n\n\"Prejudice against tattoos may not be because someone told you to think \nthat way, but it may have something to do with someone telling you it was \nokay to think that way, so it took deeper root.\"\n\nIn my case, it's the other way around. I grew up bending over backward to \ngive everyone and everything the benefit of the doubt, and resisting \nanyone's attempt to tell me to be suspicious. I had no right to my own \nopinion. I had no street sense and trusted everyone, believed everyone had \na valid point of view.\n\nThen I heard something that changed my life: \"Some people have such an open \nmind, their brains fall out.\" I have become much more selective as I got \nolder and more comfortable with my own desires and tastes, and willing to \nmake certain judgments.\n\nWho has the strength of will and intellectual independence to rebel in deed \nand not merely in appearance? And if they rebel in deed, do they care about \nappearance?\n\n\nSomeone criticised Lech Walensa (during the time he was defying the \nKremlin) for appearing in public with his shirt collar buttoned, and no \ntie. George Will said \"If Walensa is worried about anything around his \nneck, it's not a tie\".\n\nThoreau said:\n\u201cNot till we are completely lost or turned around... do we begin to find \nourselves.\u201d  \n\nFor me, one of those moments of turning around came when I soloed an \nairplane for the first time. I had grown up being told that I was ugly, \nstupid, hopeless and would never do anything with my life, and above all, I \ndid not have what it took to be an airplane pilot. I had to put myself in a \nposition that was completely disorienting, and contrary to everything I \nthought I knew about myself, before I could sort out what was real from the \nsocial conditioning. It's an ongoing process for me.\n\nIt was transgressive. And I didn't have to get inked - that wasn't what I \nneeded. Bono once told a crowd at a concert: \"I'm a rock star. It's who I \nam, what I do. I was meant to do this. Probably not many of you listening \nto me are supposed to be rock stars. There is something that you are meant \nto do and be, though. The most important thing in lifer is to find that \nthing  and do it.\" I get the impression that a lot of people who get inked \nwere actually supposed to do something else with that time, money, and \neffort and mental energy.\n\n\nThoreau: \u201cOur life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.\u201d   A \ntattoo is a complication of your visual presentation. Is the benefit of a \ntattoo worth the complication, both of the bearer's state of mind, as well \nas their impact on others? Evidently not in all cases, if you go on Youtube \nand look at all the people who are investigating ways to *remove them*.  I \nthink it would be *very* interesting to interview all those people going to \nget tattoos removed; get to the bottom of the tattoo removal situation\n\nI think that most people who get tattoos are following the herd; they're \nsure not expressing their individuality by getting tattoos like everyone \nelse is doing. It's not transgressive and rebellious anymore. It can still \nbe valid, but I see truly worthwhile tattoos all too rarely.\n\nFrank Zappa said in his autobiography: \"I insist on originality, always.\"\n\nThoreau said: \u201cAll good things are wild and free\u201d and \u201cbe yourself- not \nyour idea of what you think somebody else's idea of yourself should be.\u201d   \nSo that's why I still think that the yellow sunburst tattoo I saw on that \nguy 40 years ago is still cool.  I think he was himself, wild and free. He \nwas a professional who (transgressing against social norms of the time) got \na tattoo he designed himself that was deeply meaningful. And he was unique.\n\n\n\nI think my comment last night missed the point in one aspect: people who \nhave  unattractive elements in their presentation are not failing to look \nin the mirror; they are failing to study what makes attractive people, \nattractive. They are spending their lives in an echo chamber of their peers \nwho are reinforcing their unrealistic ideas of what looks good to most \npeople. Either that, or (as was true in my case before I improved my dress, \nshaved off my ugly beard, cut my hair, gained weight and fixed my skin) \nthey don't know that it is possible to improve one's appearance, or how \nimportant it is to do so (to the extent possible).\n\n\n\n\u201cThe significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of \nthinking with which we created them.\u201d  \n-Einstein\n\nIn the case of deciding what is the best next move for a young person, that \nrequires something truly transgressive: rebelling against one's peer group, \nnot against one's parents or 'society'. \u201cI have forced myself to contradict \nmyself in order to avoid conforming to my own taste.\u201d\n\u2015 Marcel Duchamp\n\n\n\n\u201cThe formulation of the problem is often more essential than its solution, \nwhich may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.\u201d   \n -Einstein",

Don't get me started on face piercings.\" Regarding that, \nI think more of my point was just proven by that sentence. People are used \nto ear piercings on women. Though it's still a piercing, still a \"self \ninflicted defect.\" It's not cut-and-dried, but it still has to do with what \npeople are used to, still somewhat having to do with what they're told they \nshould get used to, told what's acceptable.\n\n\"Why do you think furnishings for babies' rooms are full of pictures of \nfluffy baby bunnies and baby ducks? Why do you think childrens blankets \ndon't have morbid scary pictures of ugly witches and demons and so on?\" I \nknow a family who decorates in sort of \"Harley Davidson\" and skulls motifs. \nEven with their small children (though I think one of their children hs a \nskull shirt with a pink bow on it, but similar themes). I am not convinced \nthat babies are \"hard wired\" to like pastels and \"fluffy bunnies.\" There \nare actually evidences that small children and infants prefer brighter \ncolors because they're more visually interesting (I'm not saying you \nmentioned pastels, but going with the concept). So the parents dress babies \nin \"cute\" things, when the babies don't care. And then the parents say it's \nwhat's acceptable for babies, when it's really what's attractive for the \nparents to be using. Not in EVERY case, however, but the point is that it's \nnot the rule. Humans are not the same as sparrows. I know of children \nwho've loved red-eyed rats and Beetlejuice from a young age.\n\nI'm not trying to debate things like gender differences. What I'm trying to \nsay is that you're completely discounting any influence of conditioning. \nI'm trying to say that I don't completely disagree, but conditioning has to \nbe acknowledged. Like people were conditioned to think that women in \ntrousers was vulgar. Or that women wearing makeup was vulgar. Or that \nbecause the culture you find yourself in says dress boys in blue because \nthey like it, that's ridiculous. If he grows up some and chooses that, \nokay, but conditioning has to be acknowledged to play some part. Not in an \neffort to dismiss every opinion and belief and what other people say is \nright or wrong, but it's trying to work the equation while leaving out a \npart that doesn't quite fit with preconception that \"people don't like \ntattoos because human instinct knows they're negative.\" \n\nPrejudice against tattoos may not be because someone told you to think that \nway, but it may have something to do with someone telling you it was okay \nto think that way, so it took deeper root. If you ponder over it and don't \nthink that's the case, then okay, but the fact is, it's worth pondering \nover instead of jumping past it because it's uncomfortable to question.\n\nThere are things in this (USA) culture that are generally acceptable, \ngenerally unacceptable, and everywhere in-between. And then if you go \nsomewhere else, there is a different scale. It doesn't necessarily make one \nculture better or worse, but the differences should have us looking again \nat what we consider hard-and-fast rules. It's never good to just bulldoze \nthrough society with \"I CAN LOOK LIKE WHAT I WANT DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING,\" \nbut it's also wrong to say, for example, tattoos are always bad, this \nhaircut is always bad, mature people always dress a certain way, everyone \nshould have the same standard of beauty.",

I only used it to say I *wasn't* calling tattoos dirty when I referred \nto un-inked skin as 'clean'. Clean meaning un-inked. Someone else ran with \nthe dirty meme.\n\nHowever, that is really the point, though,  after all.\n\nPeople have an automatic negative response to tattoos because even though \ntattoos might not be unclean in the sanitary sense of the word, they are \nperceived negatively because they subconsciously remind people of dirt or \ndefects.\n\nI know it's really hard for a tattooed person to hear, but you are \nmistaken: the reason people perceive tattoos negatively is not because \nsociety has influenced their ideas of beauty, it's because of a hardwired \naversion to anything on or in the body that looks like any kind of defect. \nMany people perceive tattoos  subconsciously as a deliberately self \ninflicted defect. Don't get me started on face piercings.\n\nCognitive scientists/ethologists did an experiment years ago where they \nwaved a black silhouette of a bird of prey over a nest full of newly \nhatched sparrows which had never seen a real hawk. The baby birds freaked \nout. Why? because it is possible for any organism to have a genetically \ndetermined, innate, negative reaction to certain sights. Why do you think \nfurnishings for babies' rooms are full of pictures of fluffy baby bunnies \nand baby ducks? Why do you think childrens blankets don't have morbid scary \npictures of ugly witches and demons and so on? I had curtains over my crib \nthat had random spiky geometric shapes on them, and the pattern looked \nscary to me. That's maybe my earliest memory.\n\nI remember years ago I grew a beard and a guy at work kept telling me it \nlooked dirty. He said all beards looked dirty. He said Willie Nelson looked \ndirty.\n\nit relates to a personal aesthetic, and those values are innate. It's not \nreally a thought, it's an emotional reaction like you would have if you saw \na rabbit get hit by a car. No body told me that's hard to look at - I feel \nit. Same with tattoos.\n\nYou never see it anymore, but there used to be a trend to install a lot of \nornamental doodads on your car from the JC Whitney catalog. People who did \nthat were generally ridiculed. Why? Because adding unnecessary stuff to \nsomething that is already complete confuses the impression the pure design \nis supposed to create.\n\nHere's an analogy: some people claim that boys and girl babies should be \nraised the same, that gender differences are purely a social construct. \nHowever, there are huge differences that are obviously innate if a person \nis open minded enough to see them. For example, boys play much rougher than \ngirls, who are way more social in their activities. Try reading a book \ncalled *The Red Queen*. It's full of evidence that gender differences are  \ninnate. The prejudice I have against tattoos is not because somebody told \nme to think that way: it's because they generally give me the creeps.\n\nThere are some exceptions, but that's just the way it is. I know you \nbelieve that somebody convinced me that tattoos look unattractive; it never \nhappened.  I have a negative reaction in my body/gut/intuition, not in my \n'thinking/reasoning' brain. It's automatic, nobody ever talked me into it. \nNowadays when I see someone who has failed to maximize their \nattractiveness, it really hits me. Overweight, poor grooming, tasteless \ncolor combinations or ill fitting clothes, expensive impractical ornate \nfingernails, smoking, on and on, I just think, 'gah'. Is there no one to \ntell that person to look in a mirror?\n\nI think it's a trend to take the easy way out, dress up the outside.\n\nA think an awesome body modification for  everyone is to stop eating empty \ncarbs, get down to their ideal weight and then start lifting weights. To \nme, no matter who the person is, male, female, any age, that is 100 times \nmore attractive than tats or face/body piercings, which put me right off.",

I hope I am open minded enough to appreciate *some*  ink, and \nnot be negative about everyone who ever had a tattoo.\n\nWhen I said uninked skin was 'clean', that's not as opposed to 'dirty', \nit's as opposed to 'inked'. I wasn't saying tattoos are 'dirty'.\n\nAnd no, it's not an automatic poor choice - but I was thinking of a guy who \ninterviewed with me for a public contact job who had some kind of writhing \nvine/animal/flaming thing crawling out of his shirt and up around his neck \nonto his head. He looked contagious, or infested. Not a really \nconfidence-inspiring look.\n\nWhen I was 14, in 1972, I met a guy who had a tattoo of a rising sun sort \nof starburst on his wrist. Yellow, the color of equality in Buddhism. It \nhad 13 rays, and the rays were square ended, and the ink went more than \nhalf  the way around his wrist - so no matter what position he had his arm, \nhe could always see at least part of the image.\n\nthere was more to it, but I have forgotten it. It was a random five minute \nconversation 40 years ago.  He had a really good explanation for his \ndecision.\n\nTattoos then were relatively rare - certainly among the professional class, \nof which he was a member. That's why it stuck in my mind. He was a real \nindividual- so much, in fact, that he was wary of explaining the meaning of \nthe design to me because he didn't want anyone to possibly copy it.\n\nthat's my formative years tattoo experience.\n\nAnd it has something to do with my rolling my eyes when I meet someone who \nwants to be seen as a special unique snowflake when they picked a butterfly \nout of a catalog and had to have a couple shots of tequila to go through \nwith it.

Or do you think: \"gah, not again\"?\n\nYou also say \" because people are told they must hide any and all tattoos, \nit perpetuates the idea that all tattoos are unprofessional.\"\n\nI think you have it backward. Because tattoos are unprofessional, they are \nto be kept hidden in any well run business. Why are they unprofessional? \nbecause a significant percentage of the population thinks *just like me*: \nmany or most tattoos look bad, and send a negative message about the \nbearer's judgment. The gut level, instantaneous, genetically modulated \n negative reaction to tattoos on the part of a significant percentage of \nthe general population causes most reasonable responsible managers (modesty \nforbids, but) to ask they are kept covered.\n\nI hope that's not vile, etc.\n\nI just had to respond because it really got me thinking and I wanted to get \nto the bottom of what was bugging me about the current state of affairs.\n\nThank you for sharing.",

If someone's trying to get a certain job and has something \ntattooed onto their forehead, yeah, that's poor judgement. \n\nYou can say \"unless it's well done and rare\" but the thing is, that's two \nreasons that people are against tattoos. People insist that they know more \nabout the experience and process, that it's \"dirty\" than the person who \nactually has the tattoo, went into the shop to get it.

Unless it's really well done *and \nrare* we get tired of it.\n\nI would not hire a person with lots of visible tattoos, because I can't \nstand the sight.
