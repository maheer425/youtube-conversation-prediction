Also, you don't need to see \na particle with your eyes to prove it exists.

That's how the \nHiggs boson was found in the LHC. And finally, about you original comment, \nhe says (or at least he means) that matter, including dark matter, is \npositive energy and gravity is negative.

The truth may actually be that the \nstars and galaxies are at relatively constant distances from the earth and \nthe red shift is really the light losing velocity or energy traveling \nthrough space. I must admit that if this is the case then maybe there is \ndark mass slowing down or absorbing light energy along the way and we must \nrevise our view of the relative distances of stars from the earth. There is \na slight blue shift from about 100 locations in the universe and this seems \nto imply that dark energy is making the light travel faster or gaining more \nenergy as it travels towards the earth. The Andromeda galaxy is an example. \nIt is either traveling closer to the earth or simply the light coming from \nit is being energized by dark energy and the galaxy will never really crash \ninto the earth at some point in the distant future. Give up the idea of an \nexpanding universe and dark gravity no longer plays as significant role \nexcept perhaps in the idea of a black hole at the center of most galaxies. \nAre black holes really a concentration of dark mass or subatomic particles. \nNo one knows for sure yet. Maybe a concentration of subatomic particles is \nwhat dark mass really is which causes dark gravity. There is still much to \nlearn from the universe because there is also turbulence which needs an \nimprovement of general relativity theory which doesn't explain the effects \nvery well. The universe may indeed be filled with subatomic particles or \ndark mass which slows down or speeds up light traveling through it. Yes, \nwhat we can't explain yet or ever will explain leads to theories of dark or \nunknown something as part of the equation. If you call dark gravity unknown \ngravity and dark mass unknown mass then I agree that dark or unknown \nsomething may not be BS at all but something still left to be discovered.",

The most elusive of these particles was the \"Higgs \nBoson\" which is the particle that gravity is made of. It was recently \nproved to exist at the LHC particle physic laboratory run by the CERN group.\n        *String theory* is the theory that all of these particles are made \nof tiny vibrating strings, like in a piano, and the \"note\" is what decides \nwhat the particle is. So for example if a string's vibration is that of a \n\"C\" note, it becomes an electron, and it if it's vibration is that of an \n\"A\" note, it is a quark.\n        *Dark matter* is matter that is completely mysterious to us. The \nonly reason we know it exists is because we are seeing \"holes\" in the \nuniverse (I don't mean black holes, dark matter is even more mysterious \nthan that). For example galaxies that ought to be collapsing due to gravity \nbut for some reason are expanding like there is an invisible force tearing \nthem apart slowly. We can see the \"holes\" but don't know how they got \nthere. We think the cause may be some unseen form of matter and energy that \nwe have called \"dark matter\" because we cannot see it directly.\n        What Michio Kaku is saying here is that \"dark matter\" is very \nlikely made of those other kinds of particles of \"higher octaves\" of \nvibrating strings, which are particles in the standard model that are \ncompletely different from the kind of stuff we see in ordinary matter and \nenergy on Earth.\n        I think you will like these short videos that explain what I am \ntalking about better:\n\nCERN: The Standard Model Of Particle Physics\n\nString Ducky\n\nPatricia Burchat: Shedding light on dark matter\n\nhttp://xkcd.com/171/",

Similar to a coin vortex  display. The coin increases speed \nas it gets closer to the center. I posit that if you were to reach the edge \nof the expanding universe, and were to go a bit further you would come out \nof the center. In essence the universe is falling apart, only to arrive \nagain in the center to \"bang\" again. I never thought of gravity as being a \nnegative energy. -E=mc2 I don't think so. He also inferred that energy and \nmatter were not the same.  BS, everything in existence is a form of energy. \nMatter is energy.  Energy is all that exists. The idea of gravity being a \nnegative energy, i think is not quite right. It is only the polar opposite, \na complementary opposite, not contradictory. All of existence is based on \nthe fundamental principle the high pressure always gravitates to low \npressure. A homeostasis. In that the universe is free, is a different way \nto look at it, but I would more tend to agree with the Buddhist perspective \nin that all that exists is \"True Emptiness\", so I guess the idea that the \nnet outcome would be zero, is correct by that viewpoint. Very grateful for \nthe presentation, it will stimulate my thinking even more, as this is my \nfavorite intrigue.\ufeff",

If you believe in god you must \nthink he created everything so all those creations are amazing their own \nway right?  \n\nSecondly yes, most have 50-80 years here and we're gone, but that does NOT \nmean it is purposeless and the rest of it.  We as humans have the power to \ncreate our own purpose and meaning and life.  In fact nonbelievers tend to \nfeel their life is even more meaningful then believers because they \nunderstand that this life is the ONLY life they get, making it much more \nimportant.  If you believe in a life after this one then why is this one \nimportant?  This one is just the warm up act to the real life right?  So \nwhy not kill yourself and get to heaven?  The logic that this one wouldn't \nmake sense without a god falls flat on its face when you take a minute to \nthink about it.\n\nWhen it comes to the believer, you must first understand that that person \nmay not even have the right religion, in the end what it really comes down \nto is faith, which is belief without evidence, so chances are you don't \neven have the right god. Then apparently that god only truly cares for the \nones who believe and worship him/it, that is not a healthy relationship. \n Any being worthy of being worshiped would not ask to be worshiped, that is \nthe act of a petty being.  \n\nWhat you say at the end is the most revealing thing of all, you ask whos \nlife is better.  Very interesting, surely you would not care whos life is \nbetter but who has the truth of the matter?  Isn't the truth more \nimportant?

My suggestion is just read these \ntwo books as another popular books of mankind, it wont harm you any bit.\n          I already quoted you a scientist who chose to accept Quran and \nnot evolutionism. he has a book easily available, as you follow scientist \nit is your job to prove him wrong.\n       After Quran has established the fact a kind Creator is there, human \nare his beloved, Man and the universe have a great purpose for their \ncreation.(And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is \nbetween them just as players.  We did not create them but with true \npurpose, but most of them do not know.Sura-44 Aya-38,39 )\n       It would be mad to work hard to prove you are nothing more than a \nmonkey, and have no purpose in life.while doing so you are using a great \ngift of wisdom which itself proves you are different and special. It only \nlooks like using an axe to cut your feet. No wise person would do that.",

shouldn't they go at the same speed as every \nother galaxy if the universe is expanding isomorphically ? the answer is \nno. to understand why, let's take a segment, on that segment mark the end \npoint A, the end point B and the middle point M. now if you fix A into \nposition and move B twice as far as before from A, you will get a segment \nthat is twice as long. and of course M has moved as well to the middle of \nthe new segment, but notice that, starting from A, B has moved more than M. \ntwice as much the distance in fact. in the same amount of time, B, that is \ntwice as far from A as M is, has covered twice as much distance as M has. \nso in this sense B was twice as fast as M. in fact not only galaxies that \nare further away go faster, but galaxies twice as far away from us as other \ngalaxies move away at twice the speed.\nso when astrophisicists say that ''the universe is accelerating'' \nas prosperomage said in response to you, they don't mean that galaxies \nfurther away move away faster, because that is just the consequence of the \ngeometry of an expanding universe. they mean that galaxies are moving away \neven faster than they should and the speed keeps increasing for reasons \nunknown.\nnow, how do we notice that galaxies are going away from us and the ones \ntwice as far away from us as others are going twice as fast as them (let's \nassume, for semplicity's sake, that the universe is not accelerating)? you \nalready know this: redshift. galaxies that are twice as far away from us as \nother galaxies are also twice as redshifted ( their light is twice as \nredshifted, i should say ). but what about the galaxies that are so far \naway that their light is reaching us right now, showing us how they looked \nlike 13 billion years ago? well that light is subjected to the same rules \nabout redshift as any other light, so i don't think there would be any \ndifference.\noh, maybe now i got it: i think that maybe your question was something like \n''that light comes from almoust the beginning of the universe, so shouldn't \nit have some special property ?'' maybe you are asking ''if when we look at \nthe far space we look at how things were, and the further we look the older \nthings are, then if the universe is accelerating in his expansion shouldn't \nwe actually see an ever-slowing expansion as we look further and further \naway in space and in the past?'' it's almoust like a paradox: if the \nuniverse is accelerating, then galaxies are going away faster and faster, \nbut the further away we look the more into the past we look, when things \nwere not as fast, therefore the further away we look the slower and slower \nthings should go. mmmm.....(ten minutes go by)....ok, let's see: if a \nphoton A leaves one of this first stars and travels through an expanding \nuniverse, it will get redshifted in the process and  that is what we \nactually measure. the more time it takes for the photon to reach us, the \nmore is subjetced to the expansion of the space-time and the more it gets \nredshifted. but if a photon B from a closer/later star begins its voyage \ntowards us and it gets redshifted, B will start with a more powerful \nredshift that A, so A has 'wasted a bunch of time' with a redshift weaker \nthan B. B will get more redshift per unit of time than A has by the time it \nreacheh earth. so if A was twice as far away as B was from us by the time \nthey begun their journey, if the redshifting was stable A would be twice as \nredshifted as B is, but since redshifting is increasing, A should be less \nthan twice as redshifted as B is. but measurments say it is more, so what \nis going on here ? my answer is: maybe astronomers already considered the \nfact that two photons that reach us at the same time but from two stars at \ndifferent distances and extrapolated the data, but i don't know. either \nthere is something basic i am missing or i need to look up some serious \nliterature. \nwow, all this and i probably still didn't answer your question, that must \nbe annoying huh....well, if i learn something new, i'll tell you, deal?",

                    "text": "There's no \"empty space\" inside an atom. Now, when you really think about \nit, \"empty space\" becomes kind of a tricky concept to define, and it \ndepends on the scale at which you look at the space. For example, there's a \nstory about a philosophy (?) professor doing a demonstration in class, \nwhere he fills a cup with marbles, asks \"Is there empty space in this cup?\" \n(and the students answer \"no\"), then pours sand into the cup, asks \"Is \nthere empty space in this cup?\" (\"no\"), then pours water in and so on. The \npoint is that \"empty space\" is not a specific technical term. A particular \nregion of space could be considered empty or full or something in between, \ndepending on which definition you're using; and definitions differ.\nWith atoms, what's really going on is that the space outside the nucleus is \nfilled with the quantum fields that represent an electron. (It's slightly \ntautological to say that because a field fills space by definition, but \nlet's not worry about that.) The electron itself is very very small, \nessentially pointlike, so it doesn't really take up any space on its own, \nand thus you might argue that all the volume of the atom (outside the \nnucleus), minus the size of one electron, is empty. But on the other hand, \nthere's some probability of the electron being anywhere within the atom, so \nby another definition, it's not really accurate to say that that space is \nempty if there's some chance an electron could show up in it. In \nparticular, the space within an atom is not quite the same as what \nphysicists consider a vacuum, because there's a significant probability \nthat you'll find an electron in the atom whereas the probability is much \nless in a vacuum.\nSo the \"empty space\" is really just the electron cloud. We can never be \nsure of where the electron will be, so we broadly define it as orbitals \nwithin that area of what is traditionally thought of as \"empty space\".",
