The '90s kids will never like the 2000s kids, there's \nthis huge gap between us.\n\nI suspect it's because you were born with technology. We used to play \noutside together, whether in shit or on grass, while all you little shits \ndo is play minecraft and CoD and bitch about how the new iPhone sucks.\ufeff",

But I know it wasn't the 21'st \ncentury kids. It wasn't the 90's kids and it wasn't the 80's kids. So we \nare all influence by these \"gods\" who made technology. It's just that the \n80's and the early 90's kids were not as influence as the late 90's and \n21st century kids. But once you actually take a good close look to social \nmedia and such, You will see people who are over 18+ years old on social \nmedia, and even on COD all day and night, You will see 21+ adults playing \nCOC (Clash of clans) every single day! So yeah the late 90's and 80's kids \nmay have had a great childhood, But all I see now is that you guys are also \non your electronics every day browsing through your instagram feeds and \nwhatnot. I see adults on video games talking down on kids, I see Miley \nCyrus everywhere naked, I see Nikki Minaj booty everywhere, \"I see dead \npeople\", I see--well I guess you get the point now. You claim that our \ngenerations is screwed up, But guess what? your generation is the cause of \nit. We listen to the music that you guys made, we talk the way we talk from \nlistening to you guys, We act the way we act from watching you guys and \netc.. So my point is that we were influence by you guys. Also, not all 21st \ncentury kids stays inside their houses playing games it's just that \nmajority of them do now and vice versa towards you guys. lastly, Technology \nbecame such a big deal since the 1920's, after the great war, and the first \ntechnology made were the light-bulbs and telephone which were created in \nthe 19th century. So you guys grew up with technology too, just with crappy \nones. Lol.\n\nAnd since everyone is giving out there birth year I shall do that too.\n\nBirth: 12/31/1997 (His ideal 90's kids only reaches to 1996-1992, that \nbastard)\n\nGender: The world may never know.\n\nName: Lina Uchiha (Not my real last name, But my first name gives you my \ngender)\n\nPs. Did any \"90's\" kids catch the \"I see dead people\" quote?\nAs what Nathaniel would say, \"Only the 90's kids will understand this\"\nBut the quote, \"I see dead people\" is from a 90's movie. That quote became \nsome-what popular for some reason.\n\nThank you all for reading my comment.. And I had fun commenting on this, \nplease don't take any of this seriously I'm just bored at the moment so I \nstated some of my ignorant knowledge on here. I honestly enjoyed typing \nthis Adios and Salut.",

I \nalso agree with some of the comments that the gay movement has forced the \nissue and got into the minds of school age children. The gay mardi gras is \nanother unnecessary event that is seen as an insult to the older and wiser \ngeneration. These are the cold facts. I think its fair to all humans that \nthe gay community backs off and start to simulate with the general public \nand act normal without their image.
