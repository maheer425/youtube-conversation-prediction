Even if c02 emissions are causing \nextra heat, this would still only affect habited areas. Thus spreading the \npopulace would fix the issue.\n\n  I'm not denying climate change, only man-made climate change. Once I \nstart to see undeniable evidence of it happening, I'll change my mind.

Also \nheres a fun fact for ya: THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS GETTING SMALLER!!!! Yes, yes \ni told you, the pacific ocean is slowly shrinking. This is because the \npacific ocean moves, the atlantic ocean moves too, but the atlantic is \nmoving slightly quicker than the pacific, causing them to join, and the \npacific ocean to shrink. Ok now lets get to Pangea, fun facts over! Ok so \neveryone knows that North America and Europe are moving apart right? Well \nif u didnt know that the well, thats a bonus fun fact for ya! Well they are \nmoving apart less than 2 cm a year, i know that sounds so small, but if u \nadd up like 300 million years from now, it adds up to more than a 4 year \nold would think lol. So when we are dead, and our family members are still \nalive, there will be a super continent ON EARTH!!! HOW FUN!!!! So North \nAmerica and Europe are slowly going towards the other side of the earth, \nwitch will probably make them join together. FORMING A SUOER CONTINENT!!! A \nsuper continent is a giant continent that is the size of well, all 7 \ncontinents joined together. So this means, WHEN IM DEAD, IM GONNA BE \nWATCHING OVER ALL OF THIS MADNESS. well thats Awsome.

OH i think i'll also fill it with larger more \nspecialized killing creatures like thousands of tiny bugs that can kill him \nwith a single bite. \n\nNow that i think about it i also should demand he cuts his tail off. i mean \ni know i MADE him with a tail but i changed my mind it's gotta go and if he \nlikes it because that's HIS tail then tough i'll just torture him if he \nrefuses.\n\nAlso i'll get him a female and put some food in, then just for kicks mind \nyou i'll put a 3rd creature in there and let the 3rd one even though i know \nit's a bad pet convince his female to eat the food i put in there that i \ntold them specifically not to touch. then i'll punish them both by throwing \nthem outside alone away from the perfect cage i made them. also i'll make \nthe female have eggs all the time and be a servant of my pet (because i \nlove him) Unless my pet wants another male lizard then i'll torture him. \nthen i think i'll bring my son timmy in and let him live with the lizard \ncolony in the wild. When timmy get's older the lizards will turn on him \nbecause he's not like them and then timmy will die horribly but! when he \ndoes i'll love all the lizards again. After i'll let timmy come back to \nlife and live with me in the house. he totally won't hate me for it and the \nlizards will love me and be grateful i saved them from my wrath by letting \nthem kill my son (which somehow makes it ok the female ate that food i TOLD \nHER NOT TO DAMN LIZARDS.\n\nSomewhere along the way i'll go to the lizard colony with a firehose and \nblast the little bitches to death, i know i'll regret letting them loose \nand i'll want to kill them all for it because some of them are now \nassholes. I think i'll let one live and he can take his family along as \nlong as he gathers all these horrible creatures i made and take them to \nsafety away from the hose. \n\nBut i did all this for them and i love them, those silly little lizard \nrascals.

                    "text": "+Sir Wafflehat +One Bound If I may interject, I am aware of the Burden of \nProof argument, which lies on the one making a positive claim. Saying \"God \ndoes not exist\" is not a positive claim, so it's impossible to disprove a \nnegative. This is matching to the arguments you both mentioned, that we \ncannot disprove the existence of a god.\nHowever, two things I'd like to mention here for any future readers to \nreflect to. For one, we may not disprove a god, any less than we can \ndisprove other mythical creatures, but if a god exists, then we should be \nable to prove his existence somehow. Make him appear in person, make him \nanswer prayers, and so on. Sure, we'd still have our reasons to be \nskeptical if that really is the god everyone's talking about, but at least \nwe'd have some insight on the existence of supernatural deities. \nUnfortunately, however, lack of evidence pointing in that direction is only \nleaving us with burdening the believers with the need to provide evidence, \nand the fact that there's no disproving a negative.\nAnd secondly, and this is my personal hypothesys, we may not be able to \ndisprove the existence of some kind of supernatural deity, as we cannot say \nfor certain that there is no such thing as universal intelligent, sentient, \nomnipotent force governing our cosmos. However, what we can disprove is the \nexistence of one god in particular. For example, how do we know Zeus does \nnot exist? Because he is said to reside atop of Mt. Olympus along with the \nremaining members of Olympus Twelve in a grand temple makig lightning \nbolts. Once humans actually reached the peak of the mountain, this story \nwas just washed away, because we didn't find any evidence that there ever \nwas any kind of civilization or celestial presence: there were no celestial \nportals, no places, no gods, and certainly no giant bearded man in a toga \ngrabbing and throwing lightning bolts. So how do we apply this to the \nexistence of the God of the Bible, which I'm assuming is what we're talking \nabout? It's quite obvious, actually, while the image of a Christian God may \nvary depending on society, people, and denominations, the only \nquote-unqoute \"proof\" of God's existence is said to be the Bible itself. It \nis said to be the divine word of God, unfalsifiable and absolutely true in \nevery aspect. So, if we can disrpove what the Bible says, we can likewise \ndismiss the existence of the god depicted in it. And we find just that, \nvarious biblical claims that do not correspond with physical evidence: \nThere are no archeological remains of Noah's ark, the Tower of Babil, the \nGarden of Eden or the Mines of Solomon, and there are no mentions of such \nstructures anywhere outside of the Bible. There's also no geological \nevidence of a global flood ever having taken place, and various simulations \nand models have proven that a flood depicted in the Bible could not have \ntaken place at any time in Earth's history. There are no records of \nEgyptians opressing Jews into slavery. There are no records that a man \nnamed Jesus Christ of Nazareth ever existed, and plenty of his so called \nmiracles have been attributed to various other mythological figures from \npagan religions. Disease is caused by germs and pathogens, and not by \ndemons. The Earth is not flat, and it is not stationary with the Sun and \nthe universe spinning around it. It is also not surrounded by firmaments of \nwater, and it is not supported by pillars. A believer drinking poison will \ndie at the same rate as a non-believer drinking the same amount of the same \npoison. There's no evidence of Adam and Eve ever existing, and all evidence \npoints out to common ancestry instead of spontaneous creation. And this is \nnot even taking fantastic events such as people turning into salt, seas \nbeing divided, dead people rising as well as the existence of dragons, \nunicorns and behemoths, which are completely contradictory to what we can \nobserve in the natural world, or the many different contradictions within \nthe Bible itself. Without a doubt, the Bible has been wrong with so many \nthings in so many different aspects, so even if there is a God, it is \ncertainly not the same one that wrote or has been monitoring the writing of \nthe Christian Bible.\nBesides, the very concept of the Christian god is ridiculous, and illogical \nto say the very least. Perhaps there is a god that is omnipotent, perhaps \nthere is a god that is omniscient, perhaps there is a god that is \nomnibenevolent, perhaps there is a god that is all-present, but if you're \ngoing to claim that your god is all those things at the same time, you're \ngoing to have problems defending your beliefs. Epicurus made a perfectly \nvalid statement on this matter before Christianity even became a thing, and \nI'm not going to quote him on this for the sake of giving some more \narguments to it. The point is, that all these ideal attributes cancel each \nother out, and if a god exists, he's not at least one of those things. He \ncan't be omnipotent if he couldn't stop the various natural disasters that \nthreatened the lives of people that prayed to his name. Or maybe he could, \njust didn't know when it was comming. Or maybe he did, but he just didn't \ngive two spits about people praying because it would iterveine with his \ngreat plan. Or perhaps he could do that before, but now he's gone, which \nmeans he's not eternal. If a god really was allmighty, allknowing, \ntranscendend, timeless, perfectly good, eternal and present everywhere, the \nworld would be a much different place. And because of what the world today \nlooks like, it's safe to say that no such creature exists.",

I know this has a very obvious answer and I'd \nlike to know it.\n\nIf all life on earth has descended from a universal ancestor that lived \napproximately 3.8-3.5 billion years ago,and through technicality trees \nwould fall into the category of a living thing, Why would an evolutionary \nchain sprout from this ancestor to create an immobile life form?\n\nIf I had to guess, trees and other foliage sprouted before our common \nancestor and had no need to be mobile due to the lack of predators. Is that \nright?\n\nI feel stupid for asking, but I remember wondering about that as a kid and \nI just remembered it now.\ufeff",

Vegitation was also \nextremely likely to have come about long before life did. Who knows if it \nbelongs on our family tree. Yes veggitation appears to be alive but its not \na form of life that we're familier with. As for why it'd evolve into a tree \nor something else that can't move, that's just like asking why did humans \nevolve in the first place? We can only speculate the anwser. \nHowever, if you look at all plant life, what we see above soil is usually \nonly a tiny fraction of what there is.\nTrees have root systems as big as the tree itself, they grow in fertile \nsoil and suck the nutriants out of it, same thing for water when it rains. \nIt's just more benefical for a tree to do this than to hunt like an animal \ndoes. As for why things are like this, then no one knows I guess.\nIf you ask me, plants aren't the same kind of life as animals. Living but \nnot alive.",

God is Love and Love can only Create like Itself.\n\n God only created Heaven and Eternity. There is no other place there is no \nother time, So if not there where?

Truth is always True it never \nchanges, it never dips down to destruction and death. \n\nThe world of the ego and bodies is an illusion it was created by our egos \nas a defence against God.

Only a madman. \nGod is not mad. \n\nHe didn't put us here. We did. We did this to ourselves. We made it. We \nmade it from a mad desire to be separate. We did it to be special.\n\n Only a mad man would think a perfect and loving God would create such a \nhorrible place for His children.\n\n It's but a playground covered in razor blades.

Your other life has continued without interruption, \nans has been and always will be totally unaffected by your attempts to \ndissociate it.\n\nIn learning to escape from illusions, your debt to your brother is \nsomething you must never forget. It is the same debt that you owe to Me. \nWhenever you act egotistically towards another, you are throwing away the \ngraciousness of your indebtedness and the\nHolly Perception it would produce.\n\n The term \"Holy\" can be used here because\nas you learn how much you are indebted to the whole sonship, which includes \nMe, you come as close to Knowledge as perception can. The gap is then so \nsmall that Knowledge can flow across it to obliterate it forever.\n\nYou have very little trust in Me as yet, but it will increase as you turn \nmore and more often to Me instead of the ego for guidance. The\nresults will convince you increasingly that this choice is the only sane \none you can make.\n\nNo one who learns form experience that one\nchoice brings Peace and Joy while another brings chaos and disaster needs \nadditional convincing. Learning through rewards is more effective than \nlearning through pain, because pain is an ego illusion, and can never \ninduce more than a temporary effect.\n\nThe rewards of God however are immediately recognised as Eternal. Since \nthis recognition is made by you and not the ego, the recognition itself \nestablishes that you and your ego cannot be identical.\n\nYou may believe that you have already accepted the difference, but you are \nby no means convinced as yet. The fact that you believe you must escape \nfrom the ego shows this, but you cannot escape from the ego by humbling it \nor controlling it or punishing\nit.\n\nThe ego and the Spirit do not know each other. The separated mind cannot \nmaintain the separation except by dissociating. Having does this, it denies \nall truly natural impulses, not because the ego is a separate thing, but \nbecause you want to believe that YOU are.\n\nThe ego is a device for maintaining this belief, but it is still only your \ndecision to use the device that enables it to endure.\n\nHow can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately thrown \naway?\n\nHe must have thrown it away because he did not value it.\n\nYou can only show him how miserable he is without it, and slowly bring it \nnearer so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches it.\n\n This teaches him to associate his misery with its absence, and the \nopposite of misery with its presence. It gradually becomes desirable as he \nchanges his mind about its worth.\n\n I am teaching you to associate  misery with the ego and Joy with the \nSpirit. You have taught yourself the opposite.\n\nYou are still free to choose, but can you really want the rewards of the \nego in the presence of the rewards of God?\n\nMy Trust in You is greater than yours in Me at the moment, but it will not \nalways be that way.\n\nYour mission is simple. You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you \nare not an ego, and I do not choose God's channels wrongly.\n\nThe Holy One shares My Trust and accepts My Atonement decisions because My \ndecisions are never out of accord with His.\n\nI have said before that I am in charge of the Atonement. This is only \nbecause I completed My part in it as a man, and now complete it\nthrough others.\n\nMy chosen channels cannot fail, because I will lend them My Strength as \nlong as theirs is wanting.\" \"ACIM\"",

But the devil came as a snake. He tempted eve to eat from \nthe fruit of a tree God didn't want them to eat from. He told them not to. \nAdam followed eve and ate the fruit too. They disobeyed him. They became \naware they were naked, and unleashed the devil's animals/things into this \nworld. Now God decided to fix that.. He came down from the heavens in the \nform of a man. His name was Jesus. He died for everyone's sins, so we can \nbe with him. The earth is a cruel place because of humans' decisions, not \nGod's. Thank you for reading.

The fact that you even checked \nthis thread, shows that your in doubt about the existence of god. So shove \nit if you came here to player hate.\n\n1. Y'all go about boasting that god created the earth, the moon, the sun, \npeople, blah blah blah, but who created God? Definately, a creator must \npoint to the things and raw materials he used to create his work, but the \ngoombah lie of the century or should i say centuries is that god created us \nand he just appeared from no where and just started creating out of nothing \nc'mon now, y'all can't be serious Even mordern day magicians can point to \nthe tools of their trade.\n\n2. Ok your still in doubt. Show me god and let's be done with this \nargument. God is supposedly everywhere. I haven\u2019t personally seen God. \nTherefore, God doesn\u2019t exist\n\n3. If God can prevent evil, but doesn't, then He isn't all-loving. \n\n4. If God intends to prevent evil, but cannot, then He isn't omnipotent. \n\n5. If God both intends to prevent evil and is capable of doing so, then how \ncan evil exist? \n\n6. Y'all talking about a heaven and hell, but nobody has been there to \nconfirm it's authenticity; besides am not scared of hell. I'll rather be \nmore scared of Mushin and Oshodi\n\n7. How come no body can trace the roots of either mary, joseph or jesus \ntill date. At least i know my granfather and i know my grandfather can \ntrace his grandfather and it goes on and on and on. Somebody please show me \na decendant of any of the 3 or let me spread the drag net, any of the \napostles, prophets, sarah, solomon, daniel Anybody in the bible, pleease \njust point to a living relative. Please dont make davinci code look \ncredible \n\n8. Someone wrote the Creation story in the Bible. That someone obviously \nwasn\u2019t an eyewitness to the described events because they are completely \nunbelievable (and I think there are two very different Creation accounts in \nGenesis 1 and 2). Therefore, God doesn\u2019t exist. \n\n9. A tsunami hit louisiana and new orleans and part of texas. The tsunami \ndestroyed plenty churches. so if God exists, he created the tsunami. For \ncreating the tsunami, god must be very mean and wicked to destroy churches \nand kill people praying to him, so Therefore, God doesn\u2019t exist because \naccording to you and the bible, god is a kind god . So who created the \ntsunami then?\n\n10. Things that exist have energy. Energy isn\u2019t alive. All living things \nare made from energy. because he is not alive and has no iota of proof that \nthat he has energy so therefore, God doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nWhat a croc of rubbish, decieving people all these years and some freaks \nwould mount the podium to quote scriptures as if they wrote it and claiming \nrights of authenticity.\n\nThe bible has lots of books written by lots of authors over a long period \nof time. Despite centuries of vigorous god apologetics, they haven\u2019t been \nable to forge a coherent plot for the whole bible that I can understand. \nbottomline, God doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo if i say god is sh*******t, i can go scot free because no body is going \nto arrest me or punish me, rather i'll hear your tired ol' dumb excuse, \nyour gonna burn in hell! Once again, prove hell exist.",

In fact the oldest religion is Hinduism, but `` The West`` \nman first recorded religion was the Egyptians 4000 BCE (Ocean,  ,Tefnut \n , Shu , Geb, Nut , Ra had 3 sons; Osiris, Set and Horus, and two \ndaughters, Isis and Nephthy.) Jesus vs Orisis you should google, they had \n12 disciple and died and came back etc like many other prophet before Jesus.\n\nBasically the reason why you believe in God is in general attributed to \nyour parents believing; example if your parent are muslim you will most \nlikely be muslim if you become religious, that`s why I don`t judge ANY \nreligions because you don`t choose the religion that your born in. The \nparent of your parent does etc and over again. But now people start to \nbecome less or not at all religious ( like me ) and I don`t have any hate \ntowards religion but I believe that  +/- 809 millions people could have \nbeen saved if it wasn`t for religion but communist too kills and they \nshould both not exist , but I do believe religions bring hope to people and \na certain morale code to follow and love message etc of course religion \nmade good on earth but I`m sure less then bad...\n\n\n\nProviding further evidence of Osiris's pre-Christian role as a dying and \nrising savior god, several early Church fathers, including Athanasius, \nAugustine, Theophilus, Athenagoras, Minucius Felix, Lactantius and \nFirmicus, discussed the Egyptian god's death as mourned \"every good Friday.\"\n\nOsiris surrounded by Twelve Stars and Circles (Hornung, 'The Valley of the \nKings,' 94)The death and resurrection of the sun god have astrotheological \nmeaning, signifying the waxing and waning of the moon, which reflects the \nsun's light, as well as the daily rising and setting of the sun and the \nannual shortening and lengthening of the day. As part of his \nastrotheological journey, Osiris \"traverses the twelve sections of the \nDuat,\" and, as the sun god, Osiris has twelve companions\u2014the Signs of the \nZodiac.\" Thus, in the myth of Osiris is the great teaching god with the \ntwelve disciples who dies and resurrects, millennia before the Christian \nera. The evidence abundantly points to Jesus Christ as a nearly identical, \nmythical remake of the highly popular Osiris, whose story was known by \nmillions of pilgrims for thousands of years in precisely the same areas in \nwhich the Christian myth arose.\n\n\n\na son who is a powerful entity himself who is killed or dies for his people \nand comes back to life for the good of his people and an afterlife similar \nto an earthly existence is repeated in religious texts from Phoenicia (2700 \nBCE) to Sumer (2100 BCE) to Palestine (1440 BCE) to Greece (800 BCE) and \nfinally to Rome (c. 100 CE). The Phoenician tale of the great god Baal who \ndies and returns to life to battle the chaos of the god Yamm was already \nold in 2750 BCE when the city of Tyre was founded (according to Herodotus) \nand the Greek story of the dying and reviving god Adonis (c. 600 BCE) was \nderived from earlier Phoenician tales based on Tammuz which was borrowed by \nthe Sumerians (and later the Persians) in the famous Descent of Innana myth.\n\n\n\n\nThis theme of life-after-death and life coming from death and, of course, \nthe judgement after death, gained greatest fame through the evangelical \nefforts of St. Paul who spread the word of the dying and reviving god Jesus \nChrist throughout ancient Palestine, Asia Minor, Greece and Rome (c. 42-62 \nCE).",

                    "text": "If you're wondering where animals came from, that's fairly simple. The \nfirst forms of life were strands (or chains) of ribonucleic acid (or RNA); \nRNA evolved due to the composition of earth's water about 2-3 billion years \nago, being filled with nucleotides, which are a nitrogenous base with a \nsupporting structure of a sugar phosphate. RNA is composed of these \nnucleotides, and natural selection would play out in competition between \ndifferent chains of RNA for nucleotides (as what could be equated to as a \nsource of food). The composition of RNA would state that a chain of these \nnucleotides (arranged to carry all genetic information) would break down \nover time; and hence RNA chains would evolve to attract more nucleotides to \nreplace the ones that were breaking down (hence the equation to being a \nsource of food). One such evolution to attract more of these nucleotides, \nwould be for RNA chains to cooperate, forming the first so-called \n\"protocells.\" And furthermore, certain chains developed an attraction to \namino acid binding (called \"peptide-bonding\"). Said amino acids assisted in \nRNA syntheses, giving them the selective advantage over other chains, hence \na better chance of survival from these adaptations. \nWhile it is still uncertain how it happened, RNA at some point transitioned \nto being a deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA) system of genetic coding. DNA was \nstill an independent organism at this point, but was a far more efficient \ngenetic coder, due to a different base structure and complexity of the \ndouble helix (in comparison to what would equate to a single helix of an \nRNA chain). Like RNA, DNA would compete for base molecules in its structure \nto keep a chain alive; and similar adaptations that were made in RNA, were \nmade in DNA. One such would be cooperation of multiple DNA chains, until \nenough had been made to construct an entire prokaryotic cell structure \n(which itself could asexually reproduce as well). Prokaryotic structures \nrequired no cellular nucleus, and hence had no specific organization of \norganelles, and hence were a simple enough structure to be made by \nprimitive DNA bonding. This adaption would eventually lead to multicellular \nstructures, and/or other species of cells.\nThe first evolution to cells in making them more complex and successful, \nwas the cell nucleus, which could organize the organelles of a cell to do \nspecific vital tasks for life. Such eukaryotes as they would be named, were \noften more successful than their prokaryotic counterparts; much like DNA \nbeing successful compared to its simpler, RNA counterpart. The complexity \nand organization of the eukaryotic cells allowed for more complex roles as \nindividuals (i.e. developing photosynthesis or hunting other cells for food \n(immersion of plants/ animals)), and for complex inter-cellular \nrelationships and cooperation. Eukaryotic cells, whether photosynthetic, or \ncarnivorous, could bond together into multicellular structures; much like \nDNA into the first actual cells. However, they were still limited in many \nways that DNA cooperative groups didn't have to face, such as: Remaining \ntwo cells thick in all regions, given that all cells had to be exposed to \nwater, a third cell in between two would dehydrate completely. Also, cells \ncould still live as individuals rather than groups, and hence they weren't \ntruly multicellular organisms, but rather globs of potentially individual \ncells. \nThe first actual multicellular organisms appeared when cells could evolve \nto fit specific roles in a complex body (such as skin, brain, stomach, \nmuscle etc). These organisms could grow as their cells multiplied; however \na severe issue arose: Bodies this complex could no longer asexually \nreproduce; and hence for a very long period of time, could only grow \nindividually. The problem of asexual reproduction was solved by male and \nfemale counterparts, given traits of male or female sexual organs (such as \na simpler format of a penis or vagina in an animal). Along with organs that \ncould facilitate sexual reproduction/intercourse, there were gender \nspecific cells that could carry the DNA of the host animal; given eggs for \nfemales, and a fertilizer cell for males (such as sperm). \nSexual reproduction allowed for massive changes in a species; as now there \nwere animals (and plants) with varied genomes, interbreeding and \nnormalizing into groups. Even though a species could undergo massive change \nvia sexual reproduction, they tended to not differ greatly from one another \n(one another of the same specie that is). And given the conditions under \nwhich sexual reproduction had to occur (from varied groups of cooperating \neukaryotic cells that had now been assigned specific jobs to a body \nfunction), a normalized specie, and greater differences between species \nthan between individuals was a drastic change. Changes in a specie now \ndidn't only result in physical differences, but also, species would now \nhave certain behavioral traits; resulting in more terms of natural \nselection, hence more evolution of species until today.",

                    "text": "+Dylan Olson It is important to note that the scientists who are backing \nglobal warming are in loop with each other. They are interested in \nfinancial gain, not saving the environment. Take Al Gore for example. He's \nnot interested in \"saving the environment.\" Just look at the way he lives. \nHe is purely in it for the financial prophet. If global warming is real, \nhow come you don't see politicians taking a bigger initiative to combat it? \nHow come they themselves do not bother to live the green lifestyles which \nthey preach of? It is in fact because their cause is utterly, undeniably \nuntrue. The vast majority of scientists not publicized by the liberal media \nnot only detest global warming, but also bring sufficient scientific \nevidence to the table which disproves global warming entirely. The \nphenomena labeled \"global warming\" in recent times has been updated to \n\"climate change\" for good reason. Our Earth is constantly changing and has \nbeen doing so far beyond the introduction of humans into this world. It \nwill continue to do so up until its demise. Ive done many hours worth of \nresearch on both sides of this most confusing equation from a variety of \nresources and have come to the reasonable conclusion that the Earth in fact \nis not getting warmer in the slightest. Diverging slightly from the topic, \nI will go on. Humans need to change the world. If our early human \nforefathers did not attempt to advance and live with the smallest impact \npossible, the evolution and progress of humankind would not be as rapid as \nit was. Progress would be very slow indeed. Humans must change the world \nfor the good of their own existence. It is not out of convenience that we \nhave millions of supermarkets, but out of necessity. With millions of \nmouths to feed, the entire human population could simply not be sustained \noff of small markets. It is not out of selfishness that we guzzle fuel, it \nis out of a need to ship and move goods for an exponentially growing \npopulation. The claim that sea levels will rise due to global warming is \nfalse for two reasons. One is that global reason, as shown by various \nsources, is a false cause. Two is supported by physics itself. You at home \nright now. Go ahead and take a glass and pour a good amount of water in it. \nNow a couple ice cubes. Mark where the level of the water is including ice \ncubes. Now just let it melt. You will see that the amount of water in the \nglass is unchanged even though the ice has melted. This is for two main \nreasons. One is that ice is in fact mostly composed of air, not water. This \nis why ice floats. Once melted the air would simply escape. Two, the water \nmelted from the ice cube would fill the area in the glass the ice cube \ndisplaced prior to it melting. This means that the amount of water the ice \ncube contains would be equal to the area it displaced. If we compare this \nsmall scale experiment on a larger scale, we would see that the water in \nthe glass would behave as the ocean does and the ice put in the glass would \nbehave as glaciers do. We can deduce that the only way to cause a positive \nchange in the water level of the Earth would be to add more water to Earth \nfrom an outside source. This disproves the theory of rising sea levels. \nAlso, the \"sea\" in \"sea levels\" refers to a sea, which is an enclosed body \nof water such as the Dead Sea or the Salton Sea. Global warming has been \nproved untrue. There are only a small number of sources of the studies \nwhich suggest global warming is true. There are however a large number of \nsources of the studies which suggest and prove global warming to be false. \nI have done my homework, and I suggest you do your. You will be happily \nsurprised. One last thing, they say ignorance is bliss. Don't let yourself \nbecome the living example of that. Have a good one mate. :)",
