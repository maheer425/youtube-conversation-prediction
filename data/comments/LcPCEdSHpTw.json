                "text": "Hello Mindy, I am a 12 year old girl and I am going to a wedding on 1st \nSeptember. Me and my mom wanted to wear a kind of side swept hair thing- \nlike a half up half down curly hairstyle but to the side. \n\nI would like it if you could do a hairstyle like this before 1st September. \nYou probably wont but I will be very thankful if you do. \n\nI really enjoyed this hairstyles and keep on uploading!!! :)\n\nThank you so much in advance because I have so much faith in you that you \nwill do it, because other peoples videos don't match my needs. \n\n:) A young girl \ufeff",

My aunt is not good at \nstyling hair so I get nominated to do my little cousin's hair for recitals \nand special occasions, which I really love doing. She's 6 and has really \nfine hair, it's not thin, just very soft and fine. When I try to do a \nfrench braid and pancake it, it basically just falls apart. I'm down to \nputting it in a side ponytail and curling it because I don't know what else \nto do without pulling it all up. I have naturally curly hair so I have no \nidea how to handle fine hair. My question is does anyone have any \nsuggestions for products to use? Would the spray wax help (that's what \nsparked my curiosity in this video, I'd never even heard of that)? I really \nlove this hairstyle idea because it looks edgy without being too crazy.\ufeff",
