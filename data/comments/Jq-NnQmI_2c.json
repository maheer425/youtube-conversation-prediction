Chernobyl \nis showing signs of recovery and Centralia can't burn forever but I \nconsider nuclear less damaging most of the time. Nuclear doesn't \ncontinually pollute the air and create situations like urban china where \npeople wear masks and while reactors can fail the coal factories can catch \nfire. If one wanted to really solve this without nuclear power then he \ncould try and regulate coal operations to the point that there is minimal \nrisk. That's the real influence, people designed reactors with safety in \nmind and went to great lengths to preserve it.",

They don't require \npressurized water (cannot explode) , the nuclear reaction cannot sustain \nitself (cannot meltdown) the \"waste \" become as radioactive as ash in as \nlittle as 500 years (and if you're piky you can recycle it by neutron \nbreeding).

Whatever... here \nwe go again.\n\nSee, this shows that some haters haven't even paid attention. The Republic \nwasn't an actual republic since episode 2. Because of the war, Palpatine \ngot special authorization from the senate to be able to act alone - like an \nemporor - without needing to discuss everything with the senate. That's why \nhe staged the clone wars. This authorization gave him the ability to \ncontrol everything, even transforming the republic into an empire. He \noriginally promised to put those authorizations down after the war, but he \ndidn't. Just like the roman empire started.\nAnd even if they had the choice, do you really think the senate, the \nimperial guard, the police, the people and the PRIVATE ARMY of Palpatine \nwould be totally okay with the Jedi taking their trusted leader prisoner? \nWhat do you think was the purpose of Order 66? Just that! It would look \nlike a take over by the Jedi which was feared at that time. \"Yeah, sorry, \nwe're just taking your elected leader away, because he's possibly a \npowerful demonic mastermind and part of  an evil religion that didn't exist \nfor the last couple of millenias. We don't know exactly and we have no real \nprove, but we figure that out later, okay?\"\nImagine a few policemen trying to arrest the president like that. Even if \nthey had a reason and HAD to act, they would be stupid to do it publicly.\n\n\"I'm asking you to listen to it in hopes that you'll see some things you \nhaven't seen before.\"\n\nSo you basically want me to stop enjoying the movies and become as \novercriticizing and nitpicking as other so called \"fans\". Say what you \nwant, that is propaganda.\n\n\"How can you claim to be right when you won't even listen to the points in \nthe review?\"\n\nI'm not saying I'm right. That is because there is no right or wrong here. \nI'm also not saying you're wrong, just that it doesn't really matter that \nmuch and that all this hatred against the prequels is ridiculously \nexaggerated and ANNOYING! It's only nitpicking. No logical error could ever \nmake that seem reasonable, although haters won't stop trying. There are far \nworser movies out there that never got so much hate or reviews that go into \nmeticulous detail on what could possibly be another reason to dislike \nthem.Wouldn't it be Star Wars and wouldn't \"fans\" have romanticized \nmemories of the  originals, nobody would care. Proof that it's just about \nbeing butthurt, because the new series just isn't the \"right\" one. Screw \nthe next generation of Star Wars fans, all they should know is how bad \neverything is.\n\nWhen I watch the prequels I don't think much about little logical errors \nthat may or may not be in there. I just enjoy them.  Apparently that IS \npossible. How can it be wrong to enjoy a movie? Not you and not some \nyoutube reviewer has the right to determine what's ultimately a good movie \nand what's a bad one. They are either invidually liked or not. And what you \nare trying to do here is propaganda, say what you want. I don't know why \nyou want me to stop enjoying the prequels, but all the more I won't watch \nthis review. You won't watch Episode 1 with an open mind or think about my \narguments either, so we're even.\n\nAnd now I'm clicking on ignore.

Then, Palpatine would have a real reason to accuse the Jedi of \ntreason. For every witness it would have just looked like as if the Jedi \nwould want to take over, which is exactly what Palpatine wanted the \nRepublic to believe.\n\nAnd by the way: NITPICKING! Even if it really wouldn't make sense, you'll \nfind little logical errors like that in EVERY movie if you want so \ndesperately to find them. No filmmaker could possibly avoid that. If THAT \nis your reason to hate on the prequels, you logically must dislike the \noriginals too. Again: One shot - entire Death Star explodes! What was the \ntorture droid doing to Leia? It came close to her but it didn't seem to \nactually do anything to her. She hasn't shown any physical signs of torture \nor atleast a little exhaustion afterwards. Next time we saw her she was \nchilling in her cell and made a quip.\nThe trash compactor scene made no sense at all. Why does it compact only \nsideways? And why so slow? And why at all? In ep 5 it was revealed to be \nthe routine for the empire to throw their garbage out in the space - so why \nsquashing it beforehand?\nWhy was it neccessary for Vader to freeze Luke or Han in carbonite again? \nIs securing and paralyzing for transport not enough anymore? No, both where \nsupposed to be captured alive, so yeah - why not pushing them in some \ncarbon-fridge. Yeah, that makes sense. Even though Han survived, he could \nhave easily died later on transport or there could be a 50/50-chance of \nsurviving. Nobody knew for sure. Then Vader would have killed his new \napprentice (and son) for nothing. The stupidest incarceration method ever!\nIf Vader felt Luke on the stolen ship over Endor, why did he let them pass? \nHe wanted Luke and take him into custody, so why not using a tractor beam \nlike in Ep 4? No instead he let them land and then let his troopers look on \nthe entire moon for him.\nAnd why was there a giant hole leading directly into the reactor core of \nthe second Death Star in the private lodging of the emporor? Isn't that \nkinda dangerous? Somebody could accidentally be thrown down there. Just \nlike a trash chute on the detention block, leading into a completely \nimpractical trash compactor. Seriously, who designs those Death Stars?\n\nAnd these are only some of the many logical errors that can be found in the \noriginals. So how are they better then the prequels logically? I'm not \nsaying they are bad movies, quite the contrary. It's just that you can find \nthose in every movie if you WANT to find them.",

The \nblowing up of a balloon analogy is actually the best one... At a constant \nrate of expansion, you will see that the relative distance between two dots \ndrawn close to each other on the balloon's surface will increase more \nslowly than the distance between two dots further apart on the balloon. The \nfurther away the dots are from each other, the faster they will move away \nfrom each other. \n\nThe 'faster than light' really only refers to what is going on at the edges \nof the observable universe, and comes from the fact that if you just look \nat the relative speed of objects, once you start looking at objects of 14 \nbillion light years away or so, you start seeing this expansion showing \nredshifts that indicate the things moving away from us at close to (or at) \nthe speed of light... Really you can infer this already because we can only \nsee things up to about 14 billion LY away, and thus, we posit that what we \ncan see of the universe is 14 billion years old... That would mean that \nover the lifetime of the observable universe, the stuff at the 'edges' (the \nfurthest we can see, anyway) has in fact moved away from us at a relative \nvelocity effectively averaging at the speed of light. Since the rate of \nexpansion is increasing, and is not limited based on relative distance, \nthis means that the stuff we can see at the edge will be moving away faster \nthan the speed of light relative to us... This means that as time goes on, \nwe will be able to see less and less objects in the sky, as the stuff at \nthe very edge of our vision keeps accelerating faster until it is moving \naway fast enough that the light coming from them can no longer go fast \nenough to reach us. Basically, our effective 'horizon' of visible objects \nwill slowly shrink.  \n\nReally, for all we know, there could be a lot more of the universe that is \nfurther away... It really could be infinite, or at least much older than 14 \nbillion years old, but we just can't see that because of the expansion \neffect that could already have stuff that far away moving at a relative \nvelocity high enough that it is outside of our 'horizon'... The furthest we \ncan see is also the furthest back in time that we can see.",
