I didn't think they would turn out that good because they were \nbaked, but I was surprised because everyone thought they were deep fried. \nThis recipe made about 70 donut holes. I let them rise a bit longer than \nusual so I guess thats why it made a lot. Also I used cinnamon instead of \npumpkin pie spice and they were still really really good. Thank u! ",

The trick is dip them in \nthe butter and sugar as soon as they come out of the oven. Let me know how \nthey turn out :)",

Filling: 1/4 C melted butter, \n1/2 C sugar, 2 tsp Saigon cinnamon.  Glaze: Lots of powdered sugar with a \ntiny bit of vanilla and enough apple juice to make it spreadable, but not \ntoo runny.\n\nTip of the day: After rolling up the dough, slice it with dental floss.  \nSlide the floss under the dough, wrap the ends over the top so it forms a \nloop around the dough, then pull the ends.  It cuts easily without \nsquishing the dough flat like a knife tends to do.",

I personally guarantee you, if you follow my \nrecipe and tips you will not go wrong and you will have the best no fried \ndonuts, that are not cakey. :)\nYou can totally do it by hand. But you will need elbow grease. This dough \nis sticky so it won't come together in one ball like bread does. Mix it in \na bowl. turn it out onto a well floured surface and try kneading by hand. \nBe careful not to add to much flour while kneading or it will change the \nrecipe of the donuts. Just knead for as long as you can, maybe a few \nminutes. GOOD LUCK :)!!!!",

I'm going to let you in on a \nlittle secret on what goes on in restaurant kitchens, they use cream just \ncream and they reduce it by simmering and concentrate it. It become really \nthick. Then they add A LOT of that thick cream mix to your pasta and that's \nhow it tastes like that and why is is very thick. At home, a normal person \nwould never use that much cream but that's what they do. \nTraditionally for carbonara the correct technique is to mix cream with an \negg yolk and that naturally thicken your sauce when you add it to cooked, \nhot pasta. You stir it around to coat the pasta on low heat. You will see \nit thicken, just cook it enough to heat well through and thicken the sauce. \nAdd some parmesan which will also thicken your sauce even more and then eat \n:), does this make sense?",
