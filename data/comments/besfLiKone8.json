Punishing people for not being financially able to \npurchase Obamacare is another stab at the working poor.

If that were the case, then no amount of \nhealthy young adults could have EVER been able to offset the costs of the \nAffordable Healthcare Act. Second of all, people racking up 10,000+ dollars \na year because of high deductibles isn't going to help their impending \nbankruptcy and homelessness. \n\n\"AMY GLASS SAID: Lack of health insurance is a major issue in this country \nand that is a shame for such a rich and prosperous country like the U.S.\"\n\nI never said otherwise. In fact this a fallacy because it has nothing to do \nwith \"my\" argument. My statement never denied the fact that access to \naffordable healthcare is a problem in this country. Rather my point was \nthat 6,000 dollar deductibles does not give the AVERAGE person access to \naffordable healthcare. Why? Because the average person does not have \nmedical issues that requires 6,000 dollars to fix. I have a chronic \nillness, and I STILL don't use anywhere near 6,000 dollars a year for \nmedical care. \n\nSo when I, as a person who makes 14k a year, can only obtain \"cheap\" \nmedical insurance with a 4,000-6,000 dollar deductible, basically all I'm \ndoing is paying for an insurance that I can never benefit from (unless I \ndevelop cancer or contract AIDS, etc). So I'll be paying for insurance, but \nI won't actually receive assistance for my medical treatments because they \nequal well-below 6,000 dollars a year, but they're still above $1,000.\n\n\n\"AMY GLASS SAID: Americans need to wake up and stop being scared of code \nwords like \"socialism\" being spewed by the rightwing who benefit from and \nenjoy socialism themselves without acknowledging it.

With a lot of people- some healthier than \nothers- in an insurance pool, prices come down for everybody\"\n\nAgain, this has nothing to do with my contentions. In fact I even agree \nwith you. Words like communism and socialism are largely misunderstood \nbecause the population is ignorant of political history. These words do not \nscare me, as I am not under the thrall of either the Republicans or the \nDemocrats. As far as I'm concerned they're both one in the same, and they \nboth want to ensure Dema-Republican hegemony of American politics (no \nmatter the costs).\n\nUniversal healthcare with the public option of buying private insurance \nwould help a lot of people get the care that they need; allow people the \nchance to buy insurance so that they can get faster service time at smaller \nclinics; and my personal favorite, dramatically decrease the unlimited \npower of the corrupt Insurance corporations. \n\nThis is all great, but it still has nothing to do with my original point. \nIf I'm not actually being helped by insurance in any way, then I will NOT \npay for it. I'm not a perfectly healthy young adult. I have chronic \nillnesses that I cannot afford to pay out of pocket.

That's how they sanctioned Kevin \nTrudeau for blatantly lying during his infomercials.\nThe thing is, I think she KNEW she was getting a better and cheaper plan- \nShe has a politician husband, they have an army of lawyers, they likely \nread everything 10 times over. The thing is, they know most American's \nglance over stuff, ignore details they don't understand and freak out even \nwhen they get clarification.\n\nFor example, (I work in insurance) a person who starts with Plan A, pays \n$300 a month for their premiums, a $25 co-pay, no deductible and $25-$75 \nper month per prescription. It sounds great on the surface, right? Now \nlet's take Plan B, you pay $200 a month for premiums, $250 deductible, 20% \nco-insurance (on visits and RX's) and a $1000 annual Out of Pocket Maximum. \nIt sounds like a LOT of numbers and added factors, so it looks more \ncomplicated and scary, right? Well, let's compare them:\n\nSusan B. Anthony has cancer, sees her doctor once a month, and gets 2 \nprescriptions a month. The total cash cost of her visits and prescriptions \nare $200/visit and $1500/mo for both RX's.\n\nUnder Plan A she would pay *$5700 a year*. { $3600/yr for premiums plus \n(25*12)=$300/yr for Doctors and (75*24)=$1800/yr for both prescriptions \n=$5700/yr}\n\nUnder Plan B however, she would only pay *$3400-$3650 a year* \n{2400/yr for Premiums, $670/year for the doctor (the $250 deductible plus \n$430 for co insurance), and $330/yr for the prescriptions (or $580 if the \ndeductible wasn't included in the Out Of  Pocket. The total co insurance \nfor the prescriptions wold normally be $3600, however the Out of Pocket \nMaximum capped it out.)}\n\nThe problem lies in the explanation and math. Most people tune out when \nthey don't understand, and they get frustrated. That's why companies make \nthe \"easy to understand, simple plans\", because they cost more, but look \ncheaper. If most people just read their plan and did some research, they \ncould save *thousands* a year on their car, home, life and health \ninsurance! But the companies won't tell you this, because ignorance is \ntheir bread and butter. =(",

Its what the \"fact check\" missed \nwhen they looked at the obamacare plan and declared her lying.\n\n\"Long-term care and nursing care are not covered. Since Boonstra\u2019s leukemia \ndiagnosis five years ago, she spent two-and-a-half years bed-ridden. If \nthat happens again, she\u2019s got a big problem.\n\nThe statement of benefits says glaucoma is not covered. Leukemia is a \ndisease that ravages every part of the body, so lack of coverage for \nglaucoma (or even dental care, which is also highly relevant for a leukemia \npatient and is also not covered) is a very serious issue.\n\nBoonstra is on five different medications to help deal with her leukemia. \nThe Blue Cross PR spokesman claimed that they are all covered. But when \nBoonstra went to fill her prescription for Loratadine \u2014 a \nprescription-level equivalent of Claritin that she uses to control \ncongestion brought on by chemotherapy \u2014 she was told that Loratadine is not \ncovered. She has not yet attempted to restock any of her other meds but she \nis already having to come with strategies to deal with that problem.\n\nThe $5,100 cap on Boonstra\u2019s out-of-pocket spending is for in-network care \nonly. If she has to go out of network, she could spend an additional \n$10,200. The \u201cfact checkers\u201d treat this as impossible because Boonstra\u2019s \ndoctor is in network, but anyone who has ever dealt with cancer would know \nthere is no way of predicting where you will have to go to find care.\n\nWhen Boonstra was first diagnosed, she had to go through a painstaking \nprocess to get approval for her chemotherapy drugs to be covered. When she \nfinally found insurance she liked, she had no problem with the chemo drugs. \nShe now says that process is starting all over again.\n\nBoonstra has already had to cut back on her bone marrow biopsies, which she \nwas having on a regular schedule she had worked out with her doctor, \nbecause she doesn\u2019t have clarification on whether these will be covered.\"",

If \npeople are living paycheck to paycheck and one month their deductible is \nreally high, say they get into a car accident and they have to pay a really \nhigh deductible, suddenly then they'd be screwed. Of course this problem \ncould be easily avoided by having savings for an emergency fund or \nsomething. But still, I see how Obamacare could potentially  be a problem \nfor some people.

If we \ncould reason with you people, we wouldn't have you people. But perhaps you \ncan give me an example of a libertarian society that has worked. If you \nlike you can even use a historical example. I can only assume that at some \npoint in the history of our civilization, your libertarian model has been \nattempted. Right? Also, you've completely missed the Nazi analogy, but then \nagain, that was to be expected. As for the insults, they go both ways, I'm \njust better at it than you. :)",
