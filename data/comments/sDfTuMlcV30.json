They are specially designed for cats because if you attach a dog \nharness or to their collar, your kitty can easily slip out. Next, I put the \nfigure 8 harness on her everyday for a short period of time (without the \nleash) so she could get used to it. Then, I let her drag the leash around \nwithout me holding on to her. Finally, I held the leash and walked her \naround the neighborhood. Most cats don't follow you, but rather smell the \nfauna. This is okay, and they will get used to being \"walked\" and will \nenjoy the companionship of the outdoors.",

The \nbest way would be to build a 'catio'- an outdoor enclosure for your cat. \nHowever that can be expensive and sometimes impossible depending on zoning \nissues.I would suggest purchasing a cat harness and leash, and gently \ntraining your cat to learn to wear it inside, then start taking him/her out \nfor a few minutes at the time until the cat is comfortable outside on the \nharness... then just take him out once or twice a day and let him explore \nthat way. If you ever feel comfortable enough to let him off the leash make \nsure he has a collar and name tag incase he gets lost- but remember, if you \nlet him loose then there's always a chance he will end up in the road, in \nthe yard with an unfriendly dog, picked up by a stranger, in a cat fight, \netc. There's always risk with letting your cat outside unsupervised.",
