In fact, even when I was listening to your \nvideo review about the game, I STILL wasn't sure if I wanted to buy it or \nnot. However, the moment when Derrick gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, THAT \nwas the moment when I said \"ok, I'm not buying this game\". If Derrick \ninstead used a random \"phrase\" as a rating at the end of that video, I am \n100% sure that I \"wouldn't\" have made that decision and still would have \nremained confused/unsure if I want to buy the game or not afterwards.\n\nSo yeah \"numbers\" do matter FOR ME at least and are equally important for \nme as much as the review itself to make up my mind about buying a game or \nnot at the end.\n\nMy preference. My opinion.\n\nP.S: Good job GameXplain as always! :)",

Well guess \nwhat, I highly recommend that you should get Kirby's Dream Collection not \njust to experience all the early Kirby games again(Especially that you \nshould play Dreamland 2 & 64:Crystal Shard since you said never played it), \nbut also looking up Kirby History Mode just to know more about Kirby's \npast. Also, I highly recommend that you should get Super Star Ultra since \nonly it has a better visual presentation, but also having more modes than \nthe SNES original(Especially Meta Knightmare Ultra), thus making it the \ndefinitive version of Kirby Super Star. I also highly recommended buying \nKirby's Return to Dreamland since there's still a chance not only for \nhaving the best visual presentation of all main Kirby games, but also \nhaving the best challenge quality I've ever seen(Especially Extra Mode \nwhich it's final boss has to be the most challenging ever conceived by many \nKirby fans especially Animalguy001's thoughts in his Top 15 Kirby Boss \nBattles). Do you agree with my recommendation?",

And that's the important part, the actual \nreview not the score. When viewers walk away only remembering the score \nthan the reviewer didn't do a good job, or the viewer is missing the point. \nI think a lot of websites put too much emphasis on smaller numbers that at \nthe end of the day don't mean anything. And people will debate over the \nscore instead of the game itself. I think a more simple scoring system \nleaves more room for talking about the games and remembering what the \nreviewers say about games. Instead of arguing that some game is a 7.5  or a \n7. The 1/10 system is fine too, but once decimals are thrown in I can't \ntake it seriously cause it's such a waste of time. If you've never seen any \nAdam Sessler reviews from Rev3Games I recommend you check them out. See if \nyou can guess the star rating before the end of the video and you will see \nwhat I mean. He also did a video talking about why he hates the number \nsystem and Metacritic.",

I feel as though it represents a neutrality, not \ntoo great and not too horrible, but it just looks like a 50% and everyone \nassociates it with failure. I really like the change.",

And King DeDeDe's Drum Dash, while unique for sure, just doesn't look \nfun at all.\nBut yes, I would still recommend this fact simply due to the fact that it's \nfun.

Not saying that's bad but as a long \ntime Kirby fan since Dreamland on the gameboy, it's definitely my least \nfavorite Kirby game. Very basic and with less moves to experiment with than \nother Kirby games. Even as a non traditional title, other games like Canvas \nCurse and Mass Attack, beat it gameplay-wise. It's a solid entry level \nplatformer but stating it's the easiest Kirby game is just a fact. It's not \nan insult against it or anything.

There were 5 of them in all: Ultra Sword, Ultra \nFlame, Ultra Snow, Ultra Beam and Ultra Hammer.  You didn't press anything \nwith snow and actually had full control of it as you shook the wii remote \nto get it moving.  Also, you controlled the beam the entire time as well \nwith the control pad.  Even hammer had strategy when choosing with what \nstrength you wanted or in some cases needed to hit something with.  The \nother two are admittedly pushing a button and watching an animation, but \nthey were given to you in the first world for a reason.  That being said I \nfind the gimmicks in both of these games comparable.  Kirby Triple Deluxe \nwill have to be my favorite Kirby game ever if it wants to beat out Kirby's \nReturn to Dreamland for my top spot though.\ufeff",

I mean... give Return to Dreamland SOME slack other \nthan it was just hitting a button. No they weren't x_x You even had to use \nthem together and time it right to defeat certain bosses.

I was a bit concerned as I feel that Kirby needs a \nchange to the formula like Zelda did somewhat with A Link Between Worlds. \nMaybe a more challenging kirby that is more focused on precision \nplatforming like Donkey Kong (but not as hard).

It was a feature that could \nadd in multi-player elements to the main game. There are people who like to \nco-op games.
