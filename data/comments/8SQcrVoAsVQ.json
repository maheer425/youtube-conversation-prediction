Elsa and Anna's parent's went off to their cousins \nwedding (Rapunzel) who they had to take a boat over seas to do so and they \nran into a bad storm. But in The Little Mermaid you see their parents ship \nunder water. In Frozen you can clearly see brown haired Rapunzel and Engine \nwalking across the bridge to the court yard past Anna. But Elsa's and \nAnna's parents didn't die. They later washed up on shore and gave birth to \na son whos name would have been Tarzan. Then later they were killed by a \nwild cat.\ufeff",

                    "text": "Nope, nope, nope, nope. This is false. Using geography and comparisons, \nlet's see why this is wrong. Frozen takes place up yonder by Norway, \nSweden, and Finland. Tangled can be safely assumed to take place in \ncontinental Europe, I have reason to believe Germany. To get from the Norse \ncountries to Europe, one would have to cross either the North Sea or Baltic \nSea. These seas are notorious for rough weather and rougher seas. It was \nnot uncommon for ships to sink when traveling on these seas. Now, The \nLittle Mermaid takes place in Denmark, which coincidentally happens to \nborder both the Baltic and North Sea. It seems completely logical that \nTangled, Frozen, and The Little Mermaid to be connected.\nBut then there's the Tarzan part. First off, geography. Where does Tarzan \ntake place? Africa. Specifically, around the Congo area where there are \napes and rain forests. How can two people who's ship wrecked up by Denmark \nfloat for several months, stay alive, and land in Africa? Impossible. If \nthey used a lifeboat, incredibly unlikely. There are thousands of closer \nplaces for them to have landed in Europe.\nSecond, comparisons. Anna's and Elsa's parents dies when their boat \ncapsized, it's shown in the movie. Tarzan's parents jumped from their \nBURNING boat into a life boat. And in the introducing scene of Tarzan, \nTarzan is already born. Not only that, but he was born when they were at \ntheir home as seen from the photograph in the movie of Tarzan and his \nparents. Now his parents, or his dad to be more specific. Anna's and Elsa's \nfather has auburn hair, and a small mustache, neatly trimmed. He's also \npretty slim. Tarzan's dad, he is massive. Huge mustache, brown hair. Also, \nif the photograph was taken before they left home, he would have had his \ngiant mustache, which he did not.\nFinally, time period. Frozen and what not takes place around, I'd say the \nmid to late 1600's due to the lack of rifles, machinery and clothing style. \nThis is a generous estimate and I'm guessing it probably even took place \nbefore then. Tarzan, mid to late 1800's. Why do I say this? Steam power, \nrifles, and clothing style. Plus, in the 1800's, the Europeans were \nexploring and conquering Africa. Time wise, I don't think people could \nfloat on a boat for 200+ years and end up in Africa the same age they were.\nTarzan is not related to Frozen other than it is a story told via Disney \nanimations.",

                "text": "i think i got the whole timeline if you don't get it let me explain (mind \nyou that it's not right or wrong it's just for fun, i also added a few \nthings):\n\n  The Witch from Brave turns Merida\u2019s mother into a bear still having the \npersonality of her mother this result to the very first animal with human \nbehaviors. After a while The Witch experiments with many other animals \ncoming up with the most successful Ratatouille, a rat that takes control of \na human. Skinner finds out about the rat and ends up telling Charles F. \nMuntz who uses this for his voyage in creating a device that makes any \nanimal understandable, to help him find the Beast of Paradise Falls. This \nmassive experimentation humans are doing on animals makes the relationship \nbetween the two more hateful. Thus resulting in the Industrial Revolution \nwith BNL playing a big part in it and ultimately being control by machines. \nAfter a while pollution started to grow more dangerously and animals tried \nto stop humans from polluting. This just made humans use machines against \nthe animals resulting into the machines taking over and making earth a \nwasteland. Sending humans to space and controlling them for their revenge.\n\n   In The Incredible a machine turns on its creator and starts destroying \neverything hitting the start of the hatred on humans. Toy Story explains \nfurther why machines hates humans, and just like animals humans neglected \nand took advantage of the machines for many years thus making BNL. Earth \nbecame inhabited without humans but instead with machines, machines adapted \nthe human behaviors and became a society as seen in Cars. But because of \nearths harsh climates, massive storms and erosion. These machines couldn't \nsurvive without humans so these human behaving machines either died out or \nmoved up into space where the humans were. Resulting into the only machine \nleft who can stand everything; Wall-E. Wall-E\u2019s personality and out of the \nbox thinking helped him survive on earth but with the fascination he had on \nhumans he strive to bring humans back to earth. When he succeeds the humans \ntry to make earth a better place by planting the only living plant, this \nplant becomes the tree in A Bug\u2019s Life. In A Bug\u2019s Life it hints that there \nare little to no humans in earth that\u2019s because it\u2019s been only a few years \nafter humans return to earth but bugs survived the wasteland resulting into \nmore bugs on earth. After a while humans, machines, and animals mostly bugs \nstarted repopulating the earth. The earth\u2019s harsh climate and mutated \nenvironment made it hard for animals and humans to live. Bringing them to \neither extinction or mutation through time, and ended up creating a new \nspecies called monsters. Monsters are the next species living in earth and \nhave lived in harmony with machines creating a time traveling device. \nMonsters use this to go back in time when humans roamed the earth to scare \nhumans to use for their fuel when they found out screams can fueled there \nworld. \n\n   Sully meets Boo, a human girl who time traveled into the future with \nSully, they become friends and when she is set back to her time she tries \nhard to see him again. Resulting into becoming a witch and accidentally \ntraveling back in in time when she wanted to go to the future. In the past \nBoo tries to find out the source of magic which was The Will of the Wisps, \nThe magic that started everything. She uses this on doors to time travel \nthrough the doors to different years resulting in experimentation on \nanimals. But ending up back in the time when she was a little girl but \nafter she met sully, turned herself into a little girl again and waited \nuntil Sully comes through the closet to see her again. \n\n   She knew at that moment in time Sully was going to come through the \ncloset to see her. Because when she was time traveling she came across this \nmoment in time and saw that Sully came through the door but saw no one was \nthere. So she traveled back in time a few moments before Sully came through \nthe door turned herself into a girl again because that\u2019s how Sully \nremembered Boo and waited until he came through the door. \n\nLet me know if I left some parts out or something.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Pham Benjamin\nwell at the same time going to real life possibilities for time travel, it \nis easier to create alternate realities than it is to go back in \ntime.everything exists withing a given time and space, sometimes multiple \nspaces and times, in quantum physics but even these multiple positions have \ndefinitive locations. I beleive that time travel to the past would only \nchange your own personal circumstance, not only that but you will be \nleaving your original universe including friends and familly behind. \nwhether they are identical to your original family or not they would never \nbe the same people because you left those people in your universe when you \nwent back and changed \"your\" timeline in relation to the universe.  say you \nwent back to the 70's, say your 22, you would have had to existed for 22 \nyears in that world to be there, a 22 year old cannot just materialize. \nHowever, the sub atomic energy and wavefuctions of matter, which \ninitiations for all chemical reactions whether it be in the lab or in the \ncells of our body, living organisms could react in a way well known to \nhumans as conception, the transition from single cell life to multi cell \nlife from atomic components Human birth, so i believe if you went back this \nwould happen, which means there very well could be time travels but even \nthey themselves would not know, since it would have been their original \nuniverses self that had progress 22 years in life in that universe, who's \ninitial conditions have changed to that of the 70's so obviously you'll be \na different person. another thing people like to think about it the whole \nsee yourself in the past thing, is stupid. The very fact that you never saw \nyourself from the future all the time again just emphasizes that its an \nalternate universe because now this alternative you have an entirely \ndifferent set of life events due to your presence.  alternately the very \nfact of you being there at that time changes that universe, your displacing \nair, and space, killing and producing bacteria. your very presence there \nwith no interaction with anyone or anything on a human scale, the universe \nyour in is still different than where you left it.. So if you went to the \nfuture it would  be different than your own time, whether slightly or \nhugely.",

If you take a look back you would know: the CDA try to avoid the \nposible chances that Human knows and influents Monster's life because their \nenergy is gained from human's emotion and it is dangerous. For example, \nwhen Boo cried, all the light becames unstable and it even got worse when \nshe laughed. The Monster experienced from that and lower the risk; they \nonly gain the energy from children, so the adult won't know their \nexistence. In additional, children are usually harmless and scream for \ntheir parents to protect them instead of using a gun to shoot the s**t out \nof Monster. That's why it is called CDA but not HDA. On the other hand, \nthey also make monsters to believe that Human is dangerous, duhh. And now, \nbased on this wonderful theory, the CDA won't allow that \"Fear Machine\" to \nwork because it would be a big risk for interfering with the past and \neverything could be F**ked up. The worst case could happen is the Monster \nwill not exist at all. Choosing a different period of time is maybe an \noption, but what if they cannot or the time they choose is safety enough \nfor them to do the job. Remember, it is just an energy company so it needs \napprovement from government or at least the CDA to choose an period of time \nor methods to get the energy. Oh well, I can only explain it like this, \nanyway, you don't need logic to love a good movie, do you? :) ",
