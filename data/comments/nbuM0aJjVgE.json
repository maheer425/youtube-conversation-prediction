You criticise the ideology, Muslims will take it as \nif you criticised their beliefs, and brand you a racist.\n\nb) The reason Pakistan and India are separate entities is because of Islam, \nnot because of religion. India=Hindu+Muslim+Christian+Buddhist+Jain \nreligions thrive. Pakistan=Only Islam... notice something odd, given that \nat partition both were very religiously diverse regions?\n\nc) Islam remains a minority in India, in comparision to Persia (now Iran, \nand their conquered territories, now end with -stan), is because Hindus and \nMuslims kept fighting constantly. During the first 400 years, the Muslims \nkept winning the wars. The final 500 years, beginning with the founder of \nthe Maratha Empire, Chattrapati Shiva Ji, Hindus constantly won the wars, \nand the Sikhs formed, they were constantly getting massacred by Muslim \nkings, and protected by Maratha Shiva Ji.\n  \nAll until, the 10th and final human Sikh Guru was born, Guru Gobind Singh \nJi, where the tables reversed, and the Sikhs would be saving the Hindus. \nThe reason Sikhs celebrate Diwali, is because Guru Gobind Singh saved \ncountless Hindu Princes from the tyrannous Muslim king, Aurengzeb, contrary \nto why the Hindus celebrate it, the Festival of Light, celebrating Ram \nsaving Sita from Ravaan).\n\nd) During European Colonisation, the Marathas and Mughals were still \nfighting each other, as ever. Now the Hindus and Muslims hated each other \nmore than the external European forces. So they began selecting allies. \nNapoleon and the French allied with Tipu Sultan (Muslims) and the British \nforces allied with the Marathas.\n\nThe Mughals fell first, French, and majority other European influence was \ncleansed of India (except British and Portuguese). The British then played \na Game of Thrones, and got the naive Hindu kings to fight each other. And \ngradually conquered the whole of India. Well, all except Goa and Nepal.\n\nImmediately after partition, India annexed Hyderabad (obviously, who wants \na gap in their territory?) and Goa (fuck colonialists). They did nothing to \nNepal/Bhutan/Sri Lanka, as all had good relations.\n\nBangladesh was liberated during the 1971 Indo-Porkistani war, thanks to \nIndia.

The Guru said that he will sacrifice himself \nfor the freedom of any religious group to practise their faith, and was \nbeheaded for advocating this belief by the Mughals. A nasty bunch, the \nMughals. Mughals would be successful in looting and violating the whole \nIndia, apart from the Sikh Empire in the North. They were up against one of \nthe most courageous groups of all times, Guru Gobind Singh Ji's Khalsa \nSikhs! \ufeff",

Obviously slaves themselves had concepts \nof personal freedom from slavery, and the recognition that slavery was \nfundamentally wrong (how else could there have been slave revolts in the \nU.S. prior to the Civil War?). Beyond the slaves themselves, anti-slavery \ncentiment and abolitionism was not uncommon uakers in the 17th century were \nnotably opposed to slavery, and they were an influential religious group in \ncolonial America. Many of the Founding Fathers, even those who owned \nslaves, understood that abolition was the *right* thing to do, and that a \nnation founded on the idea that all men are created equal cannot be morally \nconsistent and yet allow slavery. However, they saw the implimentation of \nabolition as a matter of pragmatism: the country could not hold itself \ntogether if the federal government forced abolition, and the slave owners \nthemselves had no incentive to do so because their profits and livelihoods \ndepended on slavery.",

                    "text": "+Chitturi Abhinav Um, so what you mention about the history of the creation \nof Israel/Palestine borders sounds correct, but its also a lot more \ncomplicated than that given the controversies over who \"owned\" the land, \nwho had the \"right\" to create bordes, the people who were displaced out of \ntheir homes and became refugees, and wars fought over ownership of land. I \nam no expert, so I won't go into it, but I do want to make two points - 1) \nthe Middle East is a pretty screwed up place, but the wars constantly being \nfought there shouldn't be blames on Islam (which is followed by thousands \nof people who have nothing to do with the Middle East) and 2) there is no \npoint arguing over what already happened in the past and who deserved what, \nbecause that will achieve nothign and waste time (maybe that's why nothing \ngets resolved?)\n\nI assumed you are biased because you sound like you definitely support \nIsrael and blame Palestine. If you always talk about Israel's attempts as \npeace and ignore the fact that Israel politicians actually called for \ngenocide of the Palestinian people, then you are being biased. If you only \nfocus on the fact the Hamas is a crazy fundamentalist group who want to \nkill Jews, and paint the rest of the Palestinians with the same brush, you \nare being biased. Yes, I know the Hamas got elected, which is kind of \ninfathomable to me, but the perspective I was provided on that was because \nGazans have been bombed and driven out of their homes, and don't have water \nand electricity or any kind of medical supplies because their borders are \nbeing blocked, they probably can't think straight. This is not trying to \nexcuse them, this is an attempt to understand them. \n\nI know a lot of Muslims are also biased against Israel. They fail to see \nthat Israel really is in a pretty shitty position because they have to deal \nwith the likes of Hamas. But if people continue to be biased against each \nother based on religion, they can never learn to work together.\n\nAnd also I didn't mean to make Sha'ria law sound like it's a good thing. I \ndon't support it, but I recognize that it's backdated (which can translate \nto oppressive). Even countries that do follow it probably don't follow all \naspects of it. And again, you are only looking at its negative aspects. I \ndon't see what the problem is if a country chooses to adopt the good \naspects and abandon the bad. I'm not saying that's what Palestine wants to \ndo, because I don't know what Palestine wants.\n\nMy point is all about how you view other people and judge them based on a \ngeneral understanding of their choices. I think it's wrong to automatically \nmistrust Muslims because Muslims happen to be involved with terrorist acts \nin the name of religion (this is not unique to Islam, it has happened in \nthe past with other religions as pointed out by other commenters). It's not \nfair to think of a culture as oppressive because of their religion without \nunderstanding the regional and sociopolitical reasons that cause them to \nact the way they do.\n\nI don't know you personally and I don't understand how you view us. But I \nhate it if people think they have me, or my parents, or my friends, or my \ncountry of original, all figured out because of whatever happens in the \nMiddle East.",

Gaza's \nmore than a pile of rubble, 2000~ rockets and 1.81 million people call it \nhome. But anyway, I digress.\nIt was not created out of the blue, before Israel came into being it was a \nBritish mandate, along with Transjordan(known today as simply \"Jordan\"), \nIraq and British occuped Egypt. Britain gave independence to these mandates \nduring the 1940's, and during that time Jews from around the world decided \nto settle there.\nAnd why must you assume that my supporting Israel is based on a \npre-concieved bias? As if your supporting Palestine isn't for some reason? \nI wouldn't know all this if I hadn't researched the conflict myself. If \nPalestine and the Arab states decide that they will bother Israel no more, \nthen this conflict would be over. And it would end peacefully. On the other \nhand, if Israel decided to lay down it's arms and just give up, the \nconflict would end violently. I can almost gaurauntee you this would \nhappen. Why? Because Israel has repeatedly asked for peace with it's \nneighbors in exchange for the recognition of Palestine. Each and everytime \nthey've been rejected. If a \"free\" Palestine was the issue, then they \nwould've grabbed at the opportunity but it is clear why they refused to \nsuch an offer. These Arab states just want Israel to be exterminated, along \nwith it's Jewish population.\nAs for your shamelessly downplaying on how oppressive Shari'a rule is, \nlet's take a look at their laws.\n\nShari'a's rules on freedom of worship:\n1. If a person converts to Islam, or is born and raised as a Muslim, then \nhe or she will have full rights of citizenship in an Islamic state.\n2. Leaving Islam is a sin and a religious crime. Once any man or woman is \nofficially classified as Muslim, because of birth or religious conversion, \nhe or she will be subject to the death penalty if he or she becomes an \napostate, that is, abandons his or her faith in Islam in order to become an \natheist, agnostic or to convert to another religion. Before executing the \ndeath penalty, Sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to \nreturn to Islam.\n3. If a person has never been a Muslim, and is not a kafir (infidel, \nunbeliever), he or she can live in an Islamic state by accepting to be a \ndhimmi, or under a special permission called aman. As a dhimmi or under \naman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of \nan Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.\n4. If a person has never been a Muslim, and is a kafir (infidel, \nunbeliever), Sharia demands that he or she should be offered the choice to \nconvert to Islam and become a Muslim; if they reject the offer, he or she \nmay either be killed, enslaved, or ransomed if captured.\n\nPeople have been *KILLED* because of shari'a, and you're telling me that \nit's not oppressive?\n\nPalestine has also refused to negotiate with Israel as I've stated before. \nThere can be no gray blurred line on the subject. We'll have to pick sides \nor just remain ignorant completely.",

Trust me, the British were far better than the Mughals. \nIndia never existed back then, only small Kingdoms did. As the Hindu \nkingdoms were busy fighting with each other due to cultural and many other \ndifferences, the Mughals took advantage of it and took over them one by one.\n\nThose who didn't accept Islam were tortured to death. Like Bhai Mati Das (a \nSikh) was sawn across from head to loins because he didn't accept Islam. \nHis brother Bhai Dyal Das was tied up like a round bundle and thrown into a \nhuge cauldron of boiling oil and was roasted alive into a block of \ncharcoal. While Sati Das was wrapped in cotton and set to fire. And their \nguru, Tegh Bahadur was beheaded for standing up against the forceful \nconversion of Kashmiri pandits (Upper caste Hindus). Those who accepted it \nare now Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian Muslims. Most (not all) of them \nhad Hindu ancestors who were too weak to fight against the Mughals, Afghans \nand other Muslim/Islamic rulers. So they chose to accept it. Others were \nlower caste Hindus who were treated like crap by the upper caste ones. It's \nalways funny to see how so many Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims \ntake pride in Mughals and other Islamic/Muslim Empires forgetting the fact \nthat most of them had pussy ancestors who were forcefully converted to \nIslam. \n\nIslam was spread at a lightening speed, more by force, than by actual \nconvincing. Muslims forcefully converted millions of people, burnt our \nlibraries, destroyed Temples, built mosques, kidnapped and raped our women. \nMuhammed of Ghor, Mahmud of Gahzni, Aurangzeb are just few of those \nintolerant Muslim rulers who were responsible for forceful conversions. No \nwonder India has the third highest Muslim population in the world. Thanks \nto the Mughals, Afghans and other Muslim rulers. More Muslims live in India \nthan Pakistan or Bangladesh. And if we combine all of them, then they've \nthe highest Muslim population in the world, just in Indian subcontinent. \nIndia was never so conservative like its today. They technically took India \nback to stone age with their stupid Islamic laws. \n\nThis is how peaceful Muslims were.\n\"If  the revenue collector spits into a Hindu's mouth, the Hindu must open \nhis\nmouth without hesitation\"\n-Qazi Mughisuddin legal officer of  Sultan Alauddin Khilji\n\nAnd it were the Marathas from the West and Sikhs from the North that were \nmainly responsible for the decline of the Mughal Empire. But you didn't \nfeel to mention it. \nBtw, Aurangzeb wasn't Akbar's grandson but GREAT grandson. \ufeff",

Aurangzeb was very multi-cultural who \nhad many hindu officials and also built Hindu temples. And about saying he \ndestroyed Hindu temples that's wrong! How factual is this accusation \nagainst a man, who has been known to be a saintly man? Interestingly, the \n1946 edition of the history textbook Etihash Parichaya (Introduction to \nHistory) used in Bengal for the 5th and 6th graders states: \"If Aurangzeb \nhad the intention of demolishing temples to make way for mosques, there \nwould not have been a single temple standing erect in India. On the \ncontrary, Aurangzeb donated huge estates for use as Temple sites and \nsupport thereof in Benares, Kashmir and elsewhere. The official \ndocumentations for these land grants are still extant.\"\ufeff",

He ordered \nthe Subahdars of these provinces to demolish the schools and the temples of \nnon-Muslims. Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to punish Muslims who dressed \nlike non-Muslims, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds.\"\n\"Another instance of Aurangzeb's notoriety was his policy of temple \ndestruction, for which figures vary wildly from 80 to 60,000.\"\n \"Among the Hindu temples he demolished were the three most sacred: the \nKashi Vishwanath temple, Kesava Deo temple and Somnath temple.

Till today sari and dhoti- kurta are \npreferred tradition wear, we still are majorly vegetarian , most of us \nstill speak Sanskrit/Dravidian based languages and the list goes on. Maybe \nsome have love for Farsi traditions but those are limited to Lucknow and \nDelhi.\nThirdly, most historic canals , technologies, industries of India are of \nHindu heritage. The Islamic contributions end in royal extravaganza viz. \nMosques, Mausoleum, Palaces and pleasure gardens.\nIn fact Its s surprise that thousand years of Islamic rule have contributed \nso little to civic utilities especially when you see what all the 50yrs of \nmaratha , the rajputs ,the vijaynagara the nayakkars of south or cholas of \neast/ south have done in lesser years of rule.\nAncient Indian lifestyle was far superior in quality to what the Islamic \nperiod brought. In that we were closer to nature and lived a more balanced \nlifestyle. The massive accumulation of personal wealth and extravagant \nspending seen during islamic age was previously unseen in india, it \ncontributed to increasing rich poor divide in society seen in India even \ntoday. BTW I did prefer leaf to crockery any day. Muslim contribution to \nindustry is thus limited to luxury items like carpet and embroidery and \nperfumery. Except a few desert fruit grown in their personal groves , \ncultivation was grossly neglected in Islamic period .\nMost of indian cultivation and industrial techniques are traced back to \npreIslamic age the majority of arts crafts and trade were always funded and \npatronized by the Hindu/Buddhist temples as much as by royalty.\nThe worst effected area however was education , which is the mother of \ncreativity and reasoning. The middle eastern and central Asian barbaric \nempires had no clue about education being a part of society, to them it \nstopped at learning Arabic reading Qur'an and drawing calligraphy. They \ndestroyed all the universities and didn't build a single one in a thousand \nyears!\nIf anyone it were the European traders that brought new food, technology , \nadministration and revenue systems.

Now the negative uses \nof that are all too clear to us already but there are positive uses for it \nsuch as organizing large groups of people to donate clothing/food for the \npoor at certain times of the year. Furthermore they would be more willing \nto help complete a public project such as a childrens school or hospital \nwihout expecting any payment in return. Also in certain places like Africa \nyou will notice that Christianity and Islam help to create stronger family \nbonds and a more stable family structure as compared to those who do not \nadhere to such religions. Now keep in mind that im not advocating that this \nis how things should be but rather that before this imperfect world of ours \nbecomes \"perfect\" these things do fill in a niche and help out in certain \ninstances.",

Just like Jains and budhist \ndidnt rule india. Only early kings were Jains and buddhist. Most of muslims \nstill like in poverty and don't have basic facilities (like many hindus \ntoo). These rulers didnt care about Muslims, they only cared for Islam. \nWhat should I be jealous about? My community flourished against all the \nodds (I am not hindu by religion, only by culture u see). And dont give \ncrap about hindus hid in temples and all. We are not fucking terrorist to \nhid in places of worship and use them for such purpose. For us religion and \npolitics are separate. There are tonnes of example where these rulers hurt \nreligious sentiments of other religions for no apparent reasons.\nU stupid think Muslims ruled India? why is it that most of Muslims in these \nregion are very poor then? They didn't care about Muslims at all, they only \ncared about propagation of Islam and tried their best to convert as many \nidol worshipers as they can as according to them worshiping anyone else was \nsin and so is polytheism. Being part of Abhramic lineage it was against \ntheir religious beliefs.\n\nAnd yes that is the reason my post has comment that Mughals were against \n(not muslims). I dont think muslims are like that. i have already given \nexamples of how so many muslims fought for protection of homeland and also \ntemple. I have example of nawab of kutch who surrendered just so that jain \ntemple there would not be damaged. Also about Pir Angarshah who fought \nAfghan looters to protect jain temples of Palitana. Also that akbar (after \nbeing influenced by Hirsuri) made jain temple himself in agra which are \nstill existing with rock edicts to prove it. Currently, there are several \njain temples taken care of by muslims as there is no Jain population in \nthose villages. Most muslims lived harmoniously with others. Even the first \nmosques of Gujarat were created by Jain traders for their workers and \nsailors. They lived normal life but policies of ruler of state affected all.\nHe being muslim and ruling south asia is as co-incidental as British and \nother colonial empire ruled by catholic monarchs. Does it mean we all are \njealous of Christians coz they ruled entire world?\nBy your talks you seems like an Indian muslim. i can only guess u r  \nPakistani coz muslims of my country would never talk about muslims ruling \nworld.

It is the one true empire of the West.\nBritain is the meeting ground for much of northern europe, protected by a \n20-mile moat, of course.",

I think some of the \ndistinctions he made were arbitrary and I think he only used examples that \nfit his model (which isn't scientific but it does fit our tendency, as \nhumans, to search for patterns). \n\nI think he imposed too much of his own morality onto the model...I also \nthink he was biased from the recent fall of his own empire Britain and was \nprojecting what he witnessed there onto all Empires in general. \n\nIn conclusion this does not convince me that his model is a foolproof tool \nfor prediction of Empires but it is interesting. Regardless I can see how \nthe US does fit the model that he presents. (I want to note that there may \nvery well be unconscious bias of him to have the model fit the course that \nthe US has taken being that when he wrote it the US was an example of the \nsubject that he writing about.....) \n\nOn a related note I think that this model is either already or soon to be \noutdated. I think the age of the internet is a game changer for this course \nof Empire(despite the fact that he claims technological advancements have \nno impact). With the internet and the spread of ideas and communication \nacross the globe there is an increasing homogenization of the human race \nand culture. I think this humanizes people who would otherwise be viewed as \nenemies and sub-human.

There will be no more pioneering (unless it is into space but \nthat prospect seems dubious). Also there is a system of law now that would \nhamper, if not stop, the rise of an empire like ones in his model. \n\nSo, taking these changes in to consideration, I think if the US is in \ndecline then that is fine but I am not sure that we will see any more \nEmpires arise after this that fits this model. \n\nI think the next rise in power will come from Asia or the Union of Europe \n(and, taking into account some recent evidence, the US) but I this won't \nfollow the same pioneering and militaristic model.

That's a \nfallacy. \n\nShivaji Maharaj wanted 'Swaraj' for Hindus so he was neither moved by so \ncalled 'Forceful' conversions nor 'Jizya'. \n\nWhen Maharaj escaped from Agra in 1666 then Mughals lost their all control \n First to rise among north Indians were Jats. In 1669, Gokula Jat \nassassinated Abdun Nabi in Agra Bazar which led to Mughal-Jat war.\n\nAurangzeb blamed Mirza Raja Jai Singh and his son Ram Singh for the escape \nof Shivaji Maharaj so he deceitfully poisoned Mirza Raja Jai Singh which \nangered the Rajputs (Kachwas) \n\nAurangzeb always thought that Shivaji's Marathas can never win pitched \nbattles against his disciplined and well equipped mughal army but his myth \nwas shattered terribly when maharaj asked Moropant Pingle and Prataprao \ngujjar to give Mughals fight at Salher (battle of salher) in 1671/72. In \nensuing battle, Mughals were completely routed. Out of 54 Amirs( \nofficers/General) 44 were either captured or killed and this defeat sent \nshivers across the Indian subcontinent. \n\nWhen Maharaj died in 1680 then Aurangzeb's youngest of 4 sons, Akbar ran to \nthe protection of Shambaji Maharaj ( Son of Shivaji Maharaj) . Now \nAurangzeb was poised to destroy Marathas forever. He transferred his \ncapital to Aurangabad and brought every single troop he could ( half a \nmillion troops) to Deccan to personally defeat the Marathas in 1681. This \nperiod is known as 27 years war of independence or Mughal- Maratha war \nwhich changed the history forever. \n\nMountstuart Elphinstone called his period as demoralizing period for \nMussalmans as they lost their will to fight against Marathas. \n\nAurangzeb was forced to retreat from Maratha lands. He escaped capture in \n1706 when his rear guards were routed by Dhanaji Jadav . Mughal historians \nhailed Zulfiqar mohammad  for saving Aurangzeb's life. He died near \nAhmadnagar (Maharastra) \n\nNorth India was left unguarded as there were no troops to counter \nRebellion. \n\nJats dugout the grave of Akbar and threw the bones in fire but Mughals \ncouldn't stop them because they had no numbers. All the troops were in \nDeccan. \n\nGuru Gobind Singh established Khalsa in 1699 when everything was already \ntaken care. ",

The Indian \ngovernment only says in public that it has destroyed  all its samples but \nreality is quite different cause no government is that stupid to destroy \nthere most leathal weapon .So just immunise the hindu, sikh, jains and \nbuddhist population in India and release the virus , in a matter of days \nmussies  will be dieing  like the maggots they r . We must make a UNP party \nwhich unlike these toothless politicians must be totally commited to the \ncause of establishing Hindu dominance in the whole region and a final \nsolution for mussies like deathcamps  . And if the politicians dont agree \nshoot them kill there families burn there bussinesses slaughter there \nchildren and keep on attacking there realatives here and abroad until they \ncomply. Once UNP is established use all the weapons in our arsenal to start \nethenic clensing . This if it is done once will bring total peace and will \nestablish India as a total brutal hagemonic power and the world will stop \nfucking with us . Personally i never liked Gandhi he was right in his \nprincipals but hey this is KALYUG no one follows them . I like Shubhas \nChanda Bose more  a man who brought an army at british cunts doorsteps he \nis a leader to be followed in example. All this non - violence crap wont \nachieve much mussie population is steadily increasing from 14 %it has gone \nto 20 % time is coming that they will challenge us on our land for \ndominance we must follow Russian and Israeli  example and become more \nbrutal than ISIS mussies  so that they piss in there pants when they see us \n.",

Because c'mon name one empire that was \ncompletely fair, just and tolerant to people of other cultures. Aurangzeb \nhad the most Hindu court-men out of any other Mughal and he is one of the \nfew successful (successful in relation to the area he conquered) who did \nnot build any kind of monument for himself, he did not use a single penny \nfrom the royal chest for his own luxury.\n NOW,  I am *not* an Aurangzeb-lover or a Mughal lover, but we need to \nunderstand that History is pretty biased. And historical figures might not \nbe as good OR as bad as they are portrayed in texts. \nWe also have to understand the era in which these incidents took place. \nDuring that time it was pretty normal (unfortunately) to kill your own \nfamily for the throne (btw, he did not just kill everyone, he was \nchallenged for a battle. Had he lost the battle, it would be him who would \nbe killed or imprisoned by what you call his family). At that time, to \nconquer a city, the king attacked on the religious place of the city \n(temples, mosques) as they did not have parliaments or white house. Fun \nfact: Shivaji destroyed more temples than Aurangzeb did. \nOf course, the Sikh killing (like any massacre) was sad and unforgivable, \nbut you can't label it as Muslim culture. Because, if you remember \nJalianwala Bagh Massacre was carried out by the British, but that doesn't \nmean it is a British or Christian culture. There have been atrocities and \nkillings of people for different religions, race and culture carried out by \ndifferent religions, race and culture. It doesn't mean you can generalize \nand, in your own words, \"stop creating sympathetic views\" about a culture.\nIf you demand respect and kindness, how about you start giving it out too. \n:)",
