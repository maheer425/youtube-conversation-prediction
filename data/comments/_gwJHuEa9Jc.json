Would there be a difference if I say \"there is a cat\" \nor \"there are cats?\" The main message of the sentence is that the object \nexists. The quantity doesn't really matter. The cases that the quantity \nmatter are rare.\n\nThere are real languages with a different form for singular, double, and \nmultiple. In other words, \"one\", \"two\", and \"more than two\" call for a \ndifferent form. Having a separation between \"one\" and \"more than one\" is \narbitrary. We could have indications to distinguish \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \nfour\", and \"more than four\", but we just don't bother because having \ndifferent forms of the same noun just doesn't worth the trouble. The best \nindicator is stating the number of object with a number or, in case of \nunknown quantity, state the range of the number (for example, more than \nseven but less than 52). If accuracy doesn't matter, then \"there is cat\" \nwould convey just as much information.\n\nOf course, I am not suggesting anyone to just ignore a grammar rule that \neveryone uses; I am pointing out that plural is unfriendly to \nEnglish-learners in this increasingly connected world.",
