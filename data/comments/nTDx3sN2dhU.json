The Micro-Welder itself does not \nhave an on-off switch, and can pose a fire hazard if plugged directly into \na mains power socket. I made this to be used exclusively with the Scariac. \n(Look for how to build that in another project.) Stick welding, and/or the \nmodification of a Microwave Oven Transformer (M.O.T), can be very dangerous \nand presents risk of UV radiation, shock hazards, burns, fires, fumes and a \nmultitude of other risks.
