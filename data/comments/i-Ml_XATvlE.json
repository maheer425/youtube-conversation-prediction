Whereas the connoisseur has spent years \ncarefully assessing the tastes of wines of varying qualities and has \ndeveloped a skill for discerning when a wine's quality is high.\n\nThat said, I've seen movies that critics rated highly and fans rated \npoorly, moves that critics rated poorly and fans rated highly, and anywhere \nin-between. Sometimes I watch a movie that critics rated highly and it \nbores the hell out of me. And sometimes I watch a movie that audiences \nrated highly and I want to slam my head into something.\n\nOpinions, unfortunately, are never universal, though we'd often like them \nto be.",

More hypocrisy, I'm saying that word a \nlot in reference to you.  Let's take a look at the definition:  \"the \npractice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is \nthe case.\"\n\nLike someone calling another person mad and angry, when they themselves are \nin fact using insults at every turn, defending a film that is widely shat \non for good reason, implying that it has depth when it actually has \nimplications and poor execution, you're angry at me because your own \nstupidity is causing you to like and defend garbage, one of the worst \nsuperhero movies ever made.  Not quite Catwoman or Elektra levels, but \nmediocre nonetheless.\n\nYou used to like Iron Man 2, your standards are consistently high it seems!\n\nI'll quote myself here: \"Loki was the son of Odin's enemy, so he was taken \nfrom his real father as a hostage basically (although he was treated well). \n He was envious of not being able to live up to Thor, especially in Odin's \neyes and always felt like an outcast.  He loves Odin and yet hates him for \nloving Thor more, taking him from his people, lying to him all his life \netc.\"\n\nLet's compare that to Zod: general's purpose in life to be a warrior and \nlead his people, to preserve and protect them, yet HUNTS the only hope his \nrace have, the guy with the codex in his DNA.  He invades Earth and fails.  \n\nA sane person, which you clearly are not as you swear more than a psychotic \ntourettes sufferer, would not for a second say that Zod's development was \ngreater than Loki because Zod didn't develop.  He didn't change at all, \nwhereas Loki did, he tried to kill his brother.  I could use that single \npoint and still have one more than you'd ever manage to wrangle with Zod.\n\nI came to this page because a reply from a conversation I had months ago \nbrought me here, and actually I'd say that the one who swears and raves \nlike a lunatic in favour of a veritable dog turd of a movie is less likely \nto have a life because that honestly sounds like somebody that no-one can \nstand.\n\nYou don't have Roger Ebert on your side, he died before the release of the \nfilm, you have a guy that writes on Ebert's site, and he gave it a 7.5, \nhardly a glowing score.\n\nAs I said multiple times, you blind moron, I never claimed that Nolan was \nheavily involved.  Perhaps you were in a coma or cryogenic stasis during \nthe months leading to the release of MoS, because that's the only reason \nthat you fail to realise the fundamental cause of the hype.  Everyone \nwanted to see it mainly because Nolan seemed to be involved, with his \ntrademark grim style implemented, it seemed that he was basically mentoring \nSnyder, and that we were basically getting the tone and story of TDK with \nthe action and effects of 300.  It looked like the perfect storm, that's \nwhy people were interested.\n\nAgain, as I've said, it was a pseudo sequel (google pseudo because me \nhaving to repeat it so often leads me to believe that you don't know what \nit means) so that's why it made $660m+.  And it was still a bit of a flop.\n\nIron Man 3, apart from the humour being a little too much and Trevor not \nturning out to the be the Mandarin at the end (which I think they're doing \nin the One Shot anyway), was great, 8.5/10.  Story, dialogue, character \ndevelopment (PTSD, denial, addiction to self sacrifice etc.), action, \neffects, performances, it had it all.  You seem to focus on character \ndevelopment (excluding your delusions about it in MOS), I don't know why \nyou hate IM3 when it had it in spades.\n\n\"Get a life kid. Man of Steel was better than every Marvel film but Iron \nMan 1.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure that's an oxymoron.  Google that because you probably don't \nknow what it means either.",

This proves that you know nothing about \nSuperman and the film for that matter.\n\nI don't know what prequels you're bitching about since Man of Steel is a \nreboot, but it's funny that you mention growing up since that's what I did. \nI used to like Iron Man 2 and Avengers. Than I grew up and realized show \nchildish they were. Because of what Disney did to Marvel, I am confident \nthat the sequel trilogy of Star Wars is gonna suck worse than the prequel \ntrilogy.\n\nZod had more screen time than Loki dumbfuck, and instead of utilizing that \nscreentime to shout shitty, campy dialogue, he used it to develop his \ncharacter.\n\nLol, I know you have shit for brains b/c you clicked on a Man of Steel \nvideo to bash it.

You don't just leave character development to the \nindividual films, that's what you're failing to realize. Characters are \nstill being developed. It's not that hard to do, though obviously someone \nas idiotic as you would think so.\n\nOmg, you missed my reference.

Sam with Iron Man 2 and Favreau and \nevery other fucking Marvel film.\n\nAnd with that comment praising the shitastic nightmare that was Iron Man 3, \nI'm afraid I can't debate you anymore.

I'm confident \nthat you'll be in that place soon, with sense flowing through your mind.\n\nZod had barely any screen time, he couldn't really be developed.  He also \nhad barely any scenes or time with his nemesis.\n\nYou shouldn't say that someone has shit for brains when you're the one \ndefending Man of Steel, the hypocrisy is just too much.\n\nLaufey didn't recognise his son in an Asgardian appearance but he must have \nknow that Odin had his son.  Thor is an 8/10 film btw, Man of Steel is a \n5/10.

So for a pseudo sequel (your average \nguy's main reason for seeing it was because Nolan was involved) to earn \nover 400m less means that it's a bit of a flop.\n\nAvengers doesn't really have many flaws, at least that many easily \nnoticeable and major flaws, unlike MoS.  I read that review, he mentioned \njust a couple flaws and mostly gushed over it, I wouldn't call it \nparticularly fair, especially when he rated it 'very good'.\n\nCinemasins video on Avengers was jokey, as are all of their videos now. \n Barely any flaws were mentioned because there aren't really that many.  As \nI said, the solo films made sure that Avengers was setup without the need \nto trudge through individual character development.  The Justice League \nwill do that too, as juggling the character development of a large group of \npeople among a plot, villain etc. would be very difficult and needlessly \ncomplicated.\n\nA real person would care about the deaths of hundreds of thousands of \npeople, so he wasn't a real person.  He only emoted over the death of Zod, \none person, while the ashes of a dead city were thick in the air.\n\nI've already indicated that I wasn't a big fan of IM2, it was an Avengers \nsetup rather than its own film.  Symbiote?  Are you talking about \nSpiderman?  Because I don't think it mentioned the Avengers.\n\nIron Man 3 was a great film, better than the first one and second only to \nthe Avengers in the MCU.  It excelled in practically every way.",

So no, I'm not deflecting \nanything.\n\nWhat the fuck are you reading when I type this same thing over and over \nagain? The YELLOW SUN gives them super strength, speed, stamina, \ndurability, senses heat vision, and electromagnetic vision. The ATMOSPHERE \ngives them flight and maybe super breath/freeze breath. At the cost of \nlosing flight in order to gain the ability to breath normally on the \nplanet, I'd say it's worth it.\n\nI don't see how it's critically panned when it's gotten above average \nreviews from critics (with the negative ones coming from biased critics) \nand gotten good reviews from fans.\n\nAgain, I can't make you see what you clearly don't want to see. Terence \nStamp's, as lovely as he was, Zod was 1D. This Zod was fleshed out as much \nas he needed to be to still stay within the bounds of a supervillain \nterritory.\n\nLoki was somewhat developed in Thor,  though that may have had more to do \nwith Tom Hiddleston's charisma. Come Avengers though? He's just reduced to \na generic, \"take over the world\" bad guy.\n\nOh my fucking god, you really do have shit for brains. You know you're \nwrong on this point as well. He felt bad that the child was abandoned and \ntook him in. And FYI, Lauffey didn't even know that Loki was his son in the \ncontext of the film, so he couldn't be ransomed anyway. It's funny that, as \nshitty as Thor was, I still paid more attention to it than you.\n\nGlad to see that you're not as mad as you were before ;)\n\nThe average guy did bother to rate it. Do you consider yourself the average \nguy? Cause you, my friend, are an outlier.\n\nMy god, why are you comparing Man of Steel to Nolan's Batman films? They're \ntwo completely different universes and two completely different characters. \nOne was the end of a character, the other the beginning. The only thing \nthey have in common is Nolan produced both.\n\nYes, Avengers is dumb fun. Of course everyone loves it. Those who actually \ntake the time to analyze its flaws will see that it's very overrated.\n\nIt's a fair review stupid. He acknowledges the flaws and the good things.\n\nI could just as easily sum up what Avengers was using your shitty \nterminology, though CinemaSins already beat me to it; two superhero pissing \ncontests followed by a little league pep talk in order to stop an alien \ninvasion. No fucking character development there.\n\nLol, I've already compared Avengers to Batman & Robin. Man of Steel aimed \nto present Superman both as a mythological figure and a real person, and it \nsucceeded on both fronts. That's exactly what Nolan did with Batman.\n\nIf the tone is that bad, then it should've never been used as a template. \nJust look at the decline in quality from Iron Man 1 to it's sequels. I \nrecall Jon Favreau even saying that he dropped out of directing Iron Man 3 \nb/c Disney was forcing him to put in more Avengers references for the Iron \nMan 2 and he didn't like being forced to do something that he felt was \ndetrimental to the film. Remind you of a certain film about a symbiote? The \nhumor will always be there.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the marketing. Iron Man 3 was marketed as being a \nreturn to the form for the franchise, instead what we got was more campy \nshittiness. Captain America will be just the same as Thor 2.",

Man of \nSteel is separate, hence they were always going with a different Batman. \nAnd $668 million is a flop?

Zach Snyder loves comics and put his heart into the material. \nEveryone who's read a Superman comic and seen how his fights go can see \nthat. Of course there was greyness b/c they wanted to saturate the colors \nto depict the melancholy of being an alien, and the second half was full of \nurban decay so you get what you get.\n\nI didn't see any shaky cam that wasn't in every other superhero flick. The \nfact that you criticize the acting shows how blinded you are by hate. Every \nactors was great in their roles and just perfectly cast. Compare that to \nAvengers, where the only people who seemed to actually give a shit about \nthe material and legacy of the film were Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, and Tom \nHiddleston.\n\nYou have no ground to argue dialogue b/c Avengers had such shitty writing. \nI'm sorry, what was the story in Avengers? Alien invasion by a guy with \ndaddy problems? Ooh, so good! Man of Steel went through so many themes. \nYes, a good amount of them got sidetracked in favor of the action, but it \nwas still much deeper than that kiddy summer flick.\n\nThat last line shows how shitty your tastes in movies are. You can't defend \nyour own ground and have to create up this illusions in order to justify \nyour blindness. You're extremely pathetic and need to grow up. There was a \ntime when we got good superhero films. Then Disney came and fucked \neverything up. Man of Steel was a wonderful return to form and I look \nforward to its sequel (Age of Ultron?

The only character that showed \nhints at being more than just a flat person was Hulk, but either way they \nsubverted all that in place of the action.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that childish script of Avengers. I \nhaven't seen that many stupid ass jokes in a superhero movie since Batman & \nRobin.",

Some things realism just can't fix completely, like the \nability for a man to fly or a billionaire convinced that the best way to \nfight crime is to become a vigilante.\n\n2) To each their own, though I already admitted it was OTT.\n\n3) You literally just admitted that I was right. Hitting a planet will only \ndraw the necessary particles IF IT HAS THEM. And you'll need a shitton of \nthem in order to completely change a planet's infrastructure, so no, it \ndoesn't matter if Mars has some ice.\n\n4) I felt like they did, but to each their own. The fact is, a superhero \nfilm (especially the origin) has to focus on a lotta different aspects, and \nfilmmakers tend to be happy with cutting low on the romantic part. There \nare some exceptions like Superman II and Spider-Man 2, but it is rare.\n\n5) It is a movie cliche for the heroine to provide comfort to the hero in \ntheir time of sorrow. She was brought onto the ship b/c Zod wanted \ncollateral for the army.\n\n6) It does if you're holding a double standard. The only character that \nneeds character development IN A SUPERMAN MOVIE, is Superman. Though it was \nnice of them to give Lois and Colonel Hardy some as well.\n\n7) The only time he threw someone through a building was Zod through a \nGAS-FILLED silo in the beginning. Everytime else was someone else throwing \nhim.\n\n8) He didn't even technically beat Nam-Ek and Faora in the beginning. Faora \ngot her atmosphere filter broken so that missile knocked her out, and \nNam-Ek actually threw a train at Superman before taking Faora away.\n\n9) I guess that's true, but he either way had no real choice and Zod was \nappearing peacefully.\n\n10) That's what it's always been. In some cases, the glasses change his eye \ncolor too. It's a disguise that only works in the comics lol, though I felt \nChristopher Reeve did a great job really making the two personas appear as \ntwo distinct people.",

                    "text": "+Red Rider\n1) I started my statements with, that this film wanted to be more serious \nand dark than the previous films. which doesn't allow it the exceptions \nthat the previous films had.\nThough you are somewhat right in this regard.\n\n2) That Mr. Kent had to die is acceptable, it is the way that he died that \nwas stupid.\n\n3) The world engine can terraform any planet (the energy it hits the earth \nwith changes the planets mass and the smoke it releases contains the \nparticles necessary for a kryptonian atmosphere).\nthey needed the Codex because it held the genetical template for the \nkryptonian people, which they need to repopulate the terraformed planet.\n\n4) Iron man and Batman Begins didn't have a rushed romantic relationship, \nsince in both parts they were long time friends that were attracted to each \nother. Captain america contained many time skips in which their \nrelationship could have been built on.\n\n5) no it is not a movie clich\u00e9.\u00b4for Lois to possess teleporting powers or \nto be invited into Zods ship,\n\n6) Whether other films have greater or worse character development bears no \nimportance in this discussion.\n\n7) yes he saved the planet and that was great, however did he need to keep \nthrowing the bad guys into buildings and risk innocent people?\n\n8) Power lifters are stronger than than almost anyone, however I'll vote on \nthe mma fighter will win in a fight. Being fast and strong is useful \nhowever combat training is more useful than that.\nHowever Your argument is plausible enough for me to accepts it.\n\n9) Jor-El still knew Zod, which would give insight to the type of person he \nis.\nThough if the purpose was moral support I'll accept the visit to the priest \nif he at least visited virtual dad afterwards.\n\n10) reference to my first statement, also recently read All-Star Superman \nwhere his Clark Kent disguise relied on more than his glasses (completely \ndifferent posture, unkempt hairstyle covering his face and large clothes \nthat makes him look chubby)\nAnd the glasses disguise has always annoyed me, I was hoping that they \nwould have added something more in this film (like in all-star superman).\n\n- Cheers",

                    "text": "+SAEB 1) Because the source material dictates that they have to die for \nSuperman's story to begin. If you're gonna bitch about it here than you \nhave to bitch about it in EVERY media incarnation of Superman.\n\n2) The death scene was necessary. A little OTT, but Kevin Costner deserves \na proper send off since his career is practically over lol.\n\n3) Idiot, you clearly weren't paying attention to the film. They spent over \n20 years searching for a new planet, but couldn't rebuild Krypton anyway \nwithout the codex that contained the genetic code of the entire planet. And \nterraforming doesn't magically turn nothing into something- you have to \nhave the right materials, like water, air, atmosphere, good soil.... aka \nEarth.\n\n4) I agree, but it was also rushed/forced in Iron Man, Captain America, \nBatman Begins, and Thor so you're just holding a double standard.\n\n5) It's a movie cliche, deal with it.\n\n6) Disagree completely. Had more character development than most Marvel \nfilms and character development isn't even synonymous with good so I don't \nget what you're trying to prove with this statement.\n\n7) He prevented an entire planet from being destroyed so I don't know what \nyou're complaining about here.\n\n8) It's clearly stated that he soaked in the Earth's sun longer so his \nstrength, speed, and control are greater.\n\n9) Jor-El didn't know what Zod wanted until he got plugged into the ship \nand accessed all the Kryptonian files. Either way, Clark was there more for \nmoral guidance than anything else.\n\n10) Again, another thing that is tied to the source material and every \nother adaptation. Bitch about it here you bitch about it everywhere.\n\nFunny, that last sentence is exactly how I felt about Avengers.",

They can manipulate energy \ninto matter, how come they aren't able to predict/measure this outcome and \ncreate contingencies.\n\n- The dichotomy that is Jonathan Kent and his unnecessary death scene. This \nis the person that shapes Clarks morals and ethics, he is too important to \nhalf ass.\n\n- Zod's was created/born to preserve Krypton, yet he makes an enemy of the \nonly person that could stop him because he isn't willing to move his \natmosphere changing machine to another planet. Not to mention that this \nunnecessarily made enemy has a an 'object' crucial for saving the \nKryptonian race.\n\n- Though the actor/actress that play Clark and Lois have chemistry, the \n'love story' is rushed and forced.\n\n- Lois Lane inexplicably being everywhere the script demands her to be.\n\n- Lack of character development.\n\n- The amount of collateral damage that Superman could have prevented.\n\n- Clark wins against Zod and his people (bred and trained warriors) even \nthough he possesses no experience in combat. (not even school brawls, since \na sneeze from him will tear the skin off any human being) \n\n- Clark asks for guidance from a priest when his digital father could have \nexplained everything; who Zod is, what he wants, how to stop him.\n\n- Unless Clarks glasses possess some kind of alien technology that prevents \nfacial recognition software or peoples ability to perceive him correctly, \nthey shouldn't be able to hide his identity.\n\nI don't know if other people had the same problems as I had, these are \nhowever the faults that annoyed me.\nStill MoS was an acceptable cinematic experience even though it could have \nbeen much more.",
