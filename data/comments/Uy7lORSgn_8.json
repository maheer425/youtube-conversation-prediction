                "text": "I agree. Same sex couples should be allowed to marry. It in no way bothers \nanyone personally. It's not like if they marry, straight couples will \nsuddenly develop some sort of sickness or disease. It has no effect on \nanybody.\n\nHowever... the church has the right to say they don't believe in same-sex \nmarriage. Freedom of expression, right? To the religious, it is morally \nwrong, and that's ok. If Scientoligists can say we are aliens (or whatever \nnutty thing they believe in) then Christians can say they don't believe in \ngay marriage. Just like atheists can say they don't believe in God. \n\nBut... the church should not be allowed to try and force other people to \ncomply with their specific beliefs. Laws should not be passed according to \na religion's views or ideals. Simply because we don't all believe in the \nsame thing. Also, homosexuals should not sue and force a religious person \nto perform a wedding ceremony or bake a cake for them, making them go \nagainst their beliefs. Imagine that you are on a diet... and I force you to \neat a greasy burger, simply because I am *not* on a diet. Or imagine that \nyou get forced on a diet simply because *I'm*  on a diet. It works both \nways with religion and homosexuality.\n\nI think that a lot of of people who preach tolerance... on both sides of \nthe spectrum... need to practice tolerance themselves. I will respect that \nyou are on a diet, if you respect that I want to eat a greasy burger. \n\nTo the religious, I say this: Don't condemn a person to hell simply because \nthey don't share your beliefs. You are not a judge. You will be judged in \nthe end by the Almighty. Spread the word of God, and the word of God is \n*love*. Don't mistreat or condemn or oppress homosexuals. Love them. They \nare your neighbors. And God said *Love thy neighbor*. Practice what you \npreach instead of being judgmental hypocrites.\n\nThose who don't believe in any religion, I say this: You don't have to \nagree with them. You don't have to comply with their rules. But too many \ntimes I have seen religious people, even the good ones, get bashed and \nridiculed by their beliefs. There are good people within religions. Not \neveryone is a crazy fanatic who condemns everyone to hell. Respect each \nother. We must all practice being a little more civilized to one another. \nRidiculing a person for their beliefs is no better than damning someone to \nhell for their sexuality. \ufeff",

The fact that politicians use religion to make a \ncase and reason to why same sex marriage should be illegal is bullshit and \nis a clear violation to the US Constitution. ",

Mine does. There are quite a few words that spell checker doesn't \nrecognise anyway, so your point being? All you have to do is take a trip to \nthe dictionary or wikipaedia and find out the meaning there. Plus words pop \nup all the time in the English language. If we were arguing 40 years ago, \nyou'd be arguing that the word \"racist\" doesn't exist and calling us \n\"nigger lovers\". 80 years ago you'd be arguing that \"sexist\" doesn't exist \nand you'd be calling us \"little girls\" or \"girly men\".

This leads to my second point, straight men are \nACTIVELY raised to feel fear or disassociate with all things feminine. \nHomosexuality is not necessarily \"feminine\" but it is considered as such as \nit is taboo to many as well. The same people calling str8 guys out for \ntheir uncomfort then immediately imply that it is something to be ashamed \nof. We dont want to look at the institution of str8 male upbringing and say \n\"we've been encouraging your fear since the day you were born and were told \nblue is for boy and pink is for girl, and you should not ask why.\" We would \nrather call out the ones that are too silly or too honest for stating the \ndoctrine they were given, and reward the folks that can \"read the script.\" \nAnd half these dudes see being ok with gays as nothing more than a \nminute-30 second speech they'l have to give from time to time. \ufeff",

There wouldn't be any children if everyone \nwent that route!\"\n\nI didn't say *everyone*, I said:\n\n\"if there had been far more homosexuals\"\n\nOne reason why virtually every other species on this planet is under threat \nand why so many children live such short, miserable lives is that there are \nsimply *too many humans*, so obviously if a greater percentage had been \nhomosexual, there would be fewer humans and that would be a good thing.\n\nSay there were only 3 billion humans on the planet, that would be a \nsustainable amount, but by the end of this century, even without any \nincrease in family size, there will be 11 billion people on the planet. \nElephants, tigers, rhinos and a host of lesser known species will be \nextinct by the time that happens, though.\n\n\"Plus it don't take the bible for someone to realize homosexuality is wrong\"\n\nCan you actually explain*why* you think it is wrong without recourse to the \nbible?\n\n\"Although the bible is very clear on homosexuality\"\n\nThe bible isn't clear on very much. You almost certainly haven't read it in \nthe original language and no one has read the original texts as we don't \nhave them, but some scholars think the original OT exhortations against \nhomosexuality were originally against getting involved with the gay \nprostitutes in temples. There are many examples like this, a basic one is \n\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!\" Ever heard of that one? It was \noriginally, \"Thou shalt not suffer a poisoner to live!\"\n\n\"And yes I do believe in the bible\"\n\nWhy? It has no external validation, no internal logic and no morality.\n\nMost crucially, how do you decide which bits to believe and which bits to \nignore as fantasy?\n\n\"you know its wrong admit it.\"\n\nNo, I don't think that it's wrong. Just because I find the concept of two \nmen sleeping together distasteful doesn't make it wrong. I don't have any \nproblems with the idea of two women sleeping together. Homosexuality \nregularly occurs with other animals and, most notably, it occurs more when \nthe numbers of a given species are unsustainably high, so it's like nature \nis giving us a clue, here.\n\nHowever, if you believe that a god organises things, maybe all these gay \npeople are god giving us a clue that there's way too many of us?\n\n\"We all have done wrong things\"\n\nYou might have slept with a man, but I certainly haven't, the idea revolts \nme, but I'm not going to judge you for it. I'd like to point out, though, \nthat when I was a little kid, before I knew what homosexuality was, \nChristianity seemed far too gay for me; all that kneeling down and asking \nsome guy for love and forgiveness, all the priests wearing lacey dresses, \nall that gay shit can fuck right off!\n\nNow, had I been asked to worship a beautiful goddess... then maybe I \nwouldn't be quite so opposed to religion...?",

What that means \nis, we allow the homosexual person to come into the church and we treat \nthem just like everybody else. But just like everybody else, if they have a \nvice and we know it we are to show them in scripture where it says it is \nsin. In this case, we would show them the following text for one example:\n\n\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" \nLeviticus 18:22\n\nBut after that, if we know they are persisting in their homosexual \nbehavior, two brethren of the faith are to approach them about it and if \nthey will not change, they are to be escorted out of the church. At this \npoint we would make them aware that we want to see them back but they must \nfirst change this behavior. Now then, we still love them even after we've \nescorted them out and explained that it is not in our belief to allow \nsinners who are *living* in sin knowingly and consciously to remain in \nattendance.\n\nnow, if you don't agree with the above, please note that there are terms of \nendearment for all organizations in life. just as we don't allow the nudist \nto show up nude for church, just like the military doesn't let you wear \nsocks on your hands and your gloves on your feet, just like the medical \ndoctor doesn't let you play with his MRI machine, just like your parents \ndon't let you run out into traffic, just as you don't dance gangnam style \nat a funeral or have a staunch democrat join the republican party. there \nare prerequisites and rules in this world in all walks of life and if you \ndo not agree with these rules that exist before you enter any of these \norganizations or businesses etc., then you shouldn't include yourself \nbecause we have rules in this life to protect us and keep us safe while \nother rules are to protect sanctity and group interests.\n\nTherefore do not be offended if your behavior or lifestyle is not \nappropriate for a group that you intend to join. (like church) it is not \nbigotry or discrimination, it was the rules long before homosexuality had a \nboom like we see today.\ufeff",

                "text": "The reason why Christians don't want to enforce laws to ban shellfish is \nbecause those laws were not made for us. The laws in Deuteronomy and \nLeviticus were for the Jewish people of the Old Testament. Christ said in \nMatthew 5:17 that he came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. It's \nnot picking at choosing. Any good bible scholar will tell you that \nChristians don't live by the 613 Jewish laws. Hence, why we no longer \nbelieve in stoning, circumcision, sacrificing animals, ect. It doesn't \napply to us. Those were for Israelites only. Romans 6:14 says \"For sin \nshall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under \ngrace.\" Christians are not under the law. As far as homosexuality, the \nbible is clear in the New Testament that God does not support it in Romans \n1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, and 1 Timothy 1:9-10. So why should the \nchurch who represents Christ do something that the Word of God is clearly \nagainst? I don't understand that. Would you ask a muslim to conduct a same \nsex marriage? I don't think so. But ppl expect Christians to be so \npolitically correct and not biblically correct. We are followers of Christ. \nGod Bless :)\ufeff",

There are a shit ton of people that get married by a justice \nof the peace, who usually aren't affiliated with any religious institution \n(even though they might be religious themselves).

I'm not aware of any that were held \nin a church that he officiated, actually. Also, several of said ceremonies \nwere same-sex marriages -- he's a christian and doesn't agree with \nhomosexuality, but he's a decent man and does his job without making them \nfeel guilt about who they are and the person they've chosen to love. Many \nother people just go to their town hall to have a marriage certificate \ndrawn up and processed through because they don't want all the fuss of a \nceremony.\n\nAnd when the hell is *christmas* celebrated in a church? Last time I \nchecked it was a ritual/ceremony that involved spending time with your \nfamily as well as giving and receiving gifts. Sure, people talk about it \nbeing Jesus's birthday (which we aren't even sure of, because the bible \ndoesn't seem to point to that date anyway) and shit, but that's not what \nit's about. It's about showing goodwill to fellow humans, which is \nwonderful.\n\nFunerals... yes, typically done by a religious person, but only because \nthey offer a sense of comfort about there being an afterlife. The actual \nritual is a way for those that are grieving to come to terms with the \nreality and gather together to give each other support in a terrible time. \nIt is far less a religious ceremony than one of humans supporting other \nhumans.

You're seriously attempting to make that into a point?\n*MARRIAGE WAS NOT A CONCEPT INVENTED BY CHRISTIANS!*\nI'm sick and fucking tired of hearing this 'argument'. The idea of a union \nbetween a woman and a man has been around since before recorded history and \nwas typically massively polygamist for any man that had the luxury (which, \nby the way, was recorded many times in the handful of 'precious', bronze \nage, fear-mongering, 'holy' texts that so many now rely on for 'wisdom' \nwhen the people that wrote them knew essentially nothing that we know of \nlogic and science). It was also done almost exclusively for political or \neconomic power, even perhaps just further influence and always had the end \ngoal of procreation. The trend towards monogamy is only something that was \npushed into marriage through the catholic church in the span between the \n6th and 9th centuries and even then only really for Europeans -- so in the \ncase of monogamous marriage being an agenda that was pushed by christians \nlater? Yes. It's only been for about 250 years that we've been entertaining \nthis idea of a marriage being for love, and it's wonderful that now that's \nwhat it's [supposed to be] about. If you are banning someone from marriage, \nyou are banning them from an expression of loyalty and love to another \nhuman being. It's just unnecessary religious bullshit; claiming rights to a \nceremony that it did not invent just to attempt to keep the status quo... \nbecause it's made painfully clear that you have to drag them kicking and \nscreaming to any point of change.\n\nThe point is, current marriage is essentially secular. To be officially \nmarried is to have a marriage certificate -- which the church does not have \nany say in -- that places you in a relationship with another human being \nthat is seen as a special relationship with tax breaks as well as a \ndifferent IRS status. *That's it.* What religious folks get so up in arms \nabout is the *ceremony*, which is completely unnecessary but we still do \nit. It also doesn't have to be done by a priest; a justice of the peace is \nable to do it and they are typical unaffiliated (at least by their job) \nwith religions. I've never understood why the LGBT community doesn't just \nboycott the churches; they don't need them to keep their faith (as some are \nchristian and still do wish to worship, even if their companions condemn \nthem for being themselves). Despite that perfectly rational alternative, \nthe massive *stink* that religious people raise about this... it's just \ncompletely ridiculous, like its book.\n\nWhy do gays want to be married? Maybe because they love one another and \nwant to pledge that. On one hand you call marriage \"a holy union between \nman and woman\" -- then you turn right around and say \"it's just a word\". If \nyou can't see the hypocrisy in that alone... you had the sense beaten out \nof you as a child.",

Go look it up.\n\nThe main *danger* with religion is that you are saying that there's some \nguy (it's *always* a male god, isn't it, and do you know why?) who *cannot* \nbe heard or detected in any way, but who *must not be questioned!* and do \nyou know why that is so bloody dangerous? Because it's then so easy for any \nmad bastard to claim to know what this dumb god is thinking and wants us to \ndo and then what happens?\n\nWhat happens is *people drink the coolaid! People fly planes into \nbuildings! People shoot abortion doctors! People burn babies to death! \nPeople behead babies! People stop medical advances! People force girls back \ninto burning buildings! People whip little girls to death! People blame \nrape victims. People RAPE, BEAT, ENSLAVE, MURDER AND GENERALLY FUCK THE \nWORLD UP!!!*",

But not much that is TRUE.\n\nThe only things that you stated that are true are:\nBlind faith is wrong and leads to evil being done in His Name.\n\nBecause you LACK understanding you call RELIGIOUS groups that are in \nOBVIOUS violation of HIS WILL \"the church\".\n\nThe ROMAN yes ROMAN catholic SECT is NOT Christian and NEVER has been..... \nIt is only because of the IGNORANCE of the multitudes that it gets away \nwith PRETENDING that it is Christian.\n\nGoogle the 2 Babylons for the breakdown of how the ROMAN catholic SECT is a \nFALSE Church..... Or read Revelation chapters 17&18 for a PHYSICAL \ndescription of that HARLOT SECT.\n\nNow for where you are TOTALLY WRONG:\n\n1.\n\"According to God it is a sin to be allow women to have equality, if your a \nwoman it is a sin for you to go to work\"\n\nPlease cite the Biblical verses that say that. Especially where women \nhaving equality is a SIN.\n\nMen and women are to have 2 DIFFERENT ROLES and Proverbs 31 Praises the \nwoman who makes Her FIRST duty her Family and then gets busy as a Business \nEntrepreneur.\n\nWhy is that?\n\n2.\n\"If your a man it is a sin for you to see women as anything but objects.\"\n\nVerses PLEASE?\n\n3.\n\"By default everyone is a sinner and thusly no one can enter the Kingdom of \nGod. It is after all HIS kingdom not OUR kingdom, that's singular aka no \none else is allowed into heaven but him/her, Jesus, and saints/angels.\"\n\nYou again got ONE thing right.... \"By default everyone is a sinner\" as for \nthe rest of your CONFUSED rambling....\n\nThe very REASON Christ died for us is so that we may enter into HIS \nKINGDOM.... Just as night clubs only allow access if you are dressed in an \nacceptable manner...... To enter the Kingdom of Heaven you MUST be clothed \nwith Jesus's Righteousness..... You also show that you have NO IDEA what a \nsaint is.\n\n4.\n\"When it comes to my judgement day I'd be more than happy to make my case \nbefore God and whoever he decides to judge me. Providing I followed a good \nset of morals why would it matter if I worshiped him or not, in fact if I \nwas 'god' worship is the last thing I would want people to be doing for the \nsimple reason that my name could be used as a means of committing acts of \ngreat evil.\"\n\nAgain you have a small amount of truth it is Jesus that will Judge you and \nNO ONE else.....\nFollowing a good set of morals? Whose SET of Morals? Yahweh's or yours?\n\nIt is written that ALL have sinned and FALLEN SHORT of the GLORY of God.....\n\nSo with that in mind you PRESUME to DICTATE to your CREATOR how He should \nGovern HIS CREATION which also includes you...... Are Ye God? Who are you \nto tell HIM how to do anything you UNGRATEFUL Sin FULL creation.\n\nIf you were God.... If you were God.....\n\nHeads up YOU'RE NOT\n\nThusly you best be finding out HIS WILL and DOING IT.\n\n5.\nCrusades and Slave trading.....\n\nNo REAL Christian would be involved with EITHER....\n\nPlenty of DEAD RELIGIOUS People that follow EVIL MEN like the POPE would be \ninvolved..... But hey.... They ARE NOT Christians. Their ACTIONS declare \nthat they follow NOT the teachings of Jesus and therefore are NOT Christian.\n\n\nSo there it is....... You have a LOT to LEARN....\n\nMixing Pop Culture and DEAD Religion with the TRUTH of the Bible......\n\nDOES NOT WORK",

The \ngovernment can and does override god's law (whatever that law happens to be \n- so many interpretations exist). The people of faith can \"reject\" such \nauthority in favor of their god's, as you point out, but in doing so they \nwill face the inescapable consequences of their dissent.  As I said, you \nare free to believe what you want, but you are not necessarily free to act \nupon those beliefs, even if you feel that your god permits or even mandates \nthat you do so.\n\nYou also say persecution of homosexuals is \"reprehensible\", but in doing so \nyou yourself essentially override god's law according to those who hold the \nsincere belief that god views homosexuality as an aberration and that \nhomosexuals should be put to death as per the law laid down in Leviticus \n(again, whether that is actually god's law is immaterial - all that matters \nis that someone has the sincerely held belief that it is god's law). You \ncannot have it both ways then. You either respect anyone's beliefs and the \nconsequent actions and don't intervene, or you abridge the liberty to act \non certain beliefs. You elect to do the latter, and I'm with you on that.\n\nLastly, as a Westerner, I don't have much issue with those of faith \"hating \nthe sin\" as you or they like to call it (I still have a problem with it, \nbut it's not a major problem, and one I wouldn't particularly care to \ndebate).

Discriminating against certain citizens goes against \nthat. I thus think that the churches should face a choice - be willing to \nmarry gays and lesbians, or lose your tax exemption. \n\nIt's time to make the faithful even more tolerant and accepting of fellow \nhuman beings. Leave the judgment to your gods if you're so certain of other \npeople's misdeeds or apparent \"sins\". Misdeeds or \"sins\" are labelled as \nsuch based on the judgment of those very gods, and not based on the \nstandards or morals of men and women who have empathy, compasion, and \npossess sound reasoning skills.",

That's the context to your  \"Matthew 19:4 \"And he \nanswered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at \nthe beginning made them male and female\"\"  to show that the context was not \nabout gay, but about divorce. It only takes a huge stretch of the \nimagination to link the two. Nice try though. Do you have another one I can \nshow you lying about?\n\n\"As for your argument about free will, this is not about free will, it is \nabout right and the right to get married is not protected by the US \nConstitution, not to mention that I believe every man has the right to \nmarry any woman and vise versa.\"    Isn't that cute. You want to pick and \nchoose who has the right to get married based on what you believe. Right, \nthere is nothing in the constitution for who has the right to get married. \nBut giving the rights for one group to marry, every person has the right to \nmarry, as long as it's consensual.\n\n\"Plus, this is also not about me wanting to prohibit it, it is about the \nChristian churches refusing to condone it. Almost everybody (except those \nin favor of gay marriage) would agree to a compromise where they could get \nmarried with civil unions only\"  You're still talking about discrimination. \nWhy should a christian have to give up being married in a church of their \nfaith? Regardless, the fight is against gay marriage, not against gay \nchurch weddings. What is being offered by those against gay marriage is not \nmarriage. They're saying that they should be happy to live together, in sin \nand burn in hell, and call it a common law marriage.  A nice fair choice, \nisn't it?",

If your master is a \nChristian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all \nthe harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach \nthese truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.\" (1 Timothy \n6:1-2 NLT)\n\nIn Luke it's even stated you're allowed to beat slaves for not doing what \nthey were supposed to do, even if they were never informed of their duties.\n\n\"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, \nneither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.   But \nhe that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten \nwith few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much \nrequired: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the \nmore.\" (Luke 12:47-48 KJV)\n\nBut I'm fairly certain you don't go around preaching on how people should \nbe allowed to own other people.

Please consider the possibility that you do not fully \nunderstand the bible on this issue. As you know many Christians do not \nfully understand the bible and there is no shame in that. It is a complex \ndocument with layers of meaning. We are on this earth to learn.\n\nChristians with the best intentions can misunderstand the bible. People \nread and understand the Bible at different levels. There is the surface so \ncalled literal reading and then there is a deeper more completely and \nspiritually studied level. If you read a letter written between people from \na different culture and language  you can miss some of their meaning simply \nbecause you're not familiar with their culture, situation, beliefs, and \nidioms. In this case a literal reading can result in misunderstanding.\n\nEven Bible scholars disagree over what some passages of the Bible mean. \nBecause of this Christians should not be so eager condemn those who \nunderstand at a different level. We must show grace to one another in areas \nof disagreement because our limited human understanding is not as perfect \nas we think.\n\nIt's wise to study how other Christians understand and interpret the \nscriptures. It's possible they have discovered a deeper meaning that could \nteach us something. For this reason I request you go the extra mile and \nread the articles at the links below.\n\nStudy to show yourselves approved of God.\ufeff\n\nThe following site shows that the bible is more inclusive and loving \ntowards LGBT people than  some people think. At least read the articles for \nyour own sake. They talk about the bible in a loving Christian way that \nshould give you hope for saving others.\n\nhttp://biblethumpingliberal.com/2011/05/22/harold-camping-the-rapture-and-good-news-for-gays-and-lesbians/\n\nhttp://biblethumpingliberal.com/2011/06/06/clobber-passage-i-corinthians-69-all-blade-no-handle/\n\nhttp://biblethumpingliberal.com/2011/05/25/clobber-passage-abominations-and-the-death-penalty/",
