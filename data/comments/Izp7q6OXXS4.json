(And he basically gave you \nthe answer and I'll show you why)\n\nWith regard to the safecracker and the cop, it is quite simple if you can \nforsee the motives and outcomes of both scenarios. The safecracker isn't \nsmarter but he has a plan. The cop is smarter, but he lacks intel. The cop \nsimply does not know which safe the safecracker is going to crack. That is \nwhy Kaku brilliantly used the key word \"prediction.\"\n\nTo put it in a linear fashion: consider two dots on a square board, one \nwhite and the other black; the cop is white and the safecracker black. Now \nput eight letters scattered between them, from A to H, which represents the \nsafes. The safecracker is going to crack one of these safes but the cop \ndoesn't know which one. For the cop to actually catch the thief he will \nhave to predict which is the most likely target; and for the crook to not \nget caught, he will have to predict which safe to rob that cop would least \nexpect. In this case, if it were me, I would rob the one closest to the cop \nbecause he would not expect me to make that move.\n\nThis scanario mimics reality because the only reason crooks get caught is \nnot because the cops are smarter but due entirely to intel which are \ncameras, alarms and tips that only occure after the fact.\n\nAnd why would an advanced soceity be lacking in technolgies that are \nessential, such as medicine and military tactics? The 1st world nations are \nnot lacking in any of those areas, so a society that is one thousand times \nmore advanced than ours won't be either.\n\nPrediction is a form of intelligence and is not the sum of the whole. IQ \ntests don't test intelligence, but all the parts that make up intellect, \nincluding foresight.\n\nI hope I was helpful.",

I've seen first hand in Iraq a father strap his own son with \nexplosives and send him off as a Suicide Bomber. Disgusting. Currently the \nIslamic Extremist Group known as ISIS is slaughtering thousands of innocent \nIraqi's made up of women and children. Islamic Extremists in Africa are \nraping and killing a whole population of their own people. Muslims killed \n3,000 of my people in 2001 and try to attack us yearly. I wholeheartedly \nsupport Israel as the only Democracy in the region. If the Muslims didn't \ntry to launch missiles and bomb Israelis weekly, you wouldn't have the \nsituation you do. You think I take it as an insult that I support Israel? \nHahaa. Laughable. Muslims deserve the shit lives they create for \nthemselves. When they kill innocent people and blow themselves in a \nthousand pieces, I am comforted by the fact that they will burn in hell. \nAllah says do not kill innocents, Muslims are hypocritical slime.

A chemical that's most likely released when \nentering the R.E.M phase of sleep. Maybe you should delve into Psychedelics \nbefore writing *all* of them off. If you're only going by your assumptions, \nyou're very much mistaken with what you're saying. I have never taken DMT, \nno, but I'm not going to say that Psychedelics are pointless and call the \nother guy a \"Junkie asshole\". To achieve what DMT gives you through \nmeditation, you're going to need YEARS of fucking practice. So why wouldn't \nsomeone take DMT and get to that state within minutes?",

Why has fort knox never \nbeen broken? Because the value of the contents is so great that it \njustifies ANY amount of precautions to protect them.\n\nBut clearly, you would sooner have all your thinking done for you by a \nperson you put on a pedestal and who, in your mind must be correct on all \nsubjects.

They know exactly which nipple of their mother is theirs. When they \ngo into a new environment, it's extremely scary for them because the scent \nis so foreign to them. At least based on our observations.\n\nWhen they are especially scared of a foreign smell they will piss on it to \nleave a very distinct smell.

Lesser predators may still be prey themselves. \nApex predators, however, usually being the biggest predators in an area \nand/ or living in packs, need very high amounts of food, so they are \noccupied with finding that, whereas herbivores often just have to move two \nfeet forward to get fresh grass.\n\nNow, if you had said that searching for living prey and learning the \npatterns of your preys behavior requires more intelligence then picking \nleaves, that would at least be an argument.\n\nYou know, actually it is because predators are more occupied, that \nnecessitates that they have a higher intelligence than their prey, not \nbecause they are less occupied.\n\n\nBut intelligence is not necessary for survival and reproduction. And given \nthat a huge brain cost a lot of resources, it is often just to expensive to \nbe viable.\nSo you need a really good reason to develop high levels of intelligence. \nSocial interaction would be such a reason.\nThe more intelligent a species is, the bigger are the groups individuals of \nthis species can sustain. Respectively, the bigger the group is, the more \nintelligent the individuals need to be (excluding hive mind and the like).\n\nIn short, a species must have a need to live in large groups to develop a \nhigh intelligence.\n\nBut a species that already is the apex predator wouldn't need to develop \nintelligence to live in (larger) groups, because they are already \ndominating their environment. Living in (larger) groups would actually be \ncounter productive, due to the already stated need of high amounts of food.\n\nBTW. our ancestors first developed high levels of intelligence and then \nthey became hunters.",

                "text": "No, i disagree with you Mr Kaku, I had many years of thoughts about this \ntopic. About culture, moral and evolution. Yes, in animal kingdom there's \nplenty of living being doesn't have the kind of aggressiveness towards \nresources and territories, and no, that is why we human are the supreme \nbeing on this planet so call earth. If we throw away our human moral, just \nlook at the evolution itself on earth, look at the Natural selection, \nfittest always survives, because of space, resources in order for a culture \nto be survive or sustainable. Let me ask you, one day if you are walking \ninto a unknown place, its like a  desert of infinate space and you know \nwithin hundreds of miles the chances for you to find water are very low, \neven you are equiped with dark energy powered car, moving in close to the \nspeed of light, you have weeks of water and food with you, before you \ndepart you will need to have to kind of mental prepare of taking risk or \neven losing your life, so after weeks of driving you found a small pool of \nwater with some unknown harmless animal, and you discover that the water \nyou started with become only few days of supple, will you still think about \ndoes the water belongs to those low being, do i need their permission for \nthe water? after i taking those water do i need to leave some for them? no, \nyou will not, becos every decision you made will be the outcome of life or \ndeath, from the beginning you already know that, that is the situation of \nspace expedition, 73 % plus 23 % are empty space, in order to survive and \nto higher your percentage of self sustain, there will never be a room for \nmora, there will never be (ENOUGH)l, its like people in the US when they \nare drinking, they will thinking about satisfaction, in the middle of \ndesert its not about just satisfaction, its about life and death, water \nwill never be enough for travelers in desert. So if there's an alien visit \nearth in future, base on the natural selection theory, every being will \ntake what they need for survival, and they ,like us, will not think about \nhow poor and horrible the chicken die when we decided to eat KFC or 2 bags \nof water for me its enough for me to start going back into the desert. I \nwould like to have a further discussion with you Mr Kaku, if possible. \ufeff",

And, once a \ncreature is sufficiently evolved to not have to worry about that, due to \nhaving domination of its surroundings, those aggressive genes are already \ningrained.

It seems to be a logical consequence in \nthe process of evolution to develop such a characteristic. Now if u look at \nearly technological advancements of the human race on planet Earth there \nseem to be a lot of similarities. A lot of isolated populations of homo \nsapiens developed almost exactly the same tools spears, bows etc. It seems \nto me the same thing would happen on alien planets with similar conditions \ncompared to Earth.\nBut if u have vastly different conditions this might not be true. Imagine a \nGas-giant which might be  500 ly away in a binary star-system orbited by a \nocean covered moon without any landmass.Lets suggest an intelligent species \ndeveloped on this moon with a similar level of consciousness as humans \nposes s, they might not even be capable of developing advanced technologies \nor tools simply because of the moons properties no fire to make advanced \ntools,no electricity.(there might be a way to overcome those problems but I \nguess my imagination isnt in for that task at the moment).\nMy point is it seems that u are a bit stubborn regarding the development of \naggressive tendencies all over the various scenarios possible. As I \nexplained it seems to be \"logical\" to imply this under similar conditions \nearth finds itself in.\nOkay and my final point is you also seem to imply that DNA is the only way \nfor  complex lifeforms to evolve even though it is very likely it is only \none possibility of information transmission via genes etc. In fact it is \nvery probable that alien life has other mechanisms to transmit information \nin order for Evolution to happen. If we found DNA in another star system it \nwould be a shocking revelation because it would lead to the conclusion of \nan universal common ancestor of some sorts or \"engineer\" like in the movie \nPrometheus or maybe even some sort of omnipotent Creator.\n\nWell with that said I am happily awaiting your answer to my little text.By \nthe way I am sorry about my insufficient English capabilities, but English \nisnt my native language as u have probably noticed by now.

To prevent this, the group would need to apply \nsome sort of \"resource violence\", purposefully starving the individual. \nThis is similar to how we use violence to apprehend criminals. They would \nsimply create a system of resource trade and resource law, exactly as we \nhave.\n\nAs for the speculated life, it was a long time ago when I've heard it, so \nfinding a link would be difficult. I can mostly give you details. It was \nafter some non-Earth-like planet was discovered somewhere, and it was \nspeculated that despite being non-Earth-like it could still sustain an \natmosphere, and hence, life.\nHere are the basic environmental details: The planet has some sort of \nrotational lock, so that one half is permanently frozen, while the other \nhalf is constantly exposed to the sun. At the center of this exposed area \nis a never-ending tornado. I don't quite remember what causes this tornado \nto exist. Something about the planetary rotation? Or the radiation? Not \nsure.\nAnyway, the planet lacks some ozone layer, or some other protective field, \nso solar flares hit it with extreme radiation that could kill land animals. \nIt was speculated that there would still be sea animals, and amphibious \nanimals. Also, there would be plants with large canopies at the top, \ncapable of swaying around, sort of like water lilies or something, so as to \ntrap as much radiation as possible when it arrives. And finally, it was \nsuggested that there could be a carnivore which, in addition to the normal \nfacilities, has a large eye on the top of the head or body used to detect \nincoming solar flares. Upon detecting such, the creature would head for \ncover, in a cave or under a tree, to protect itself from the radiation.\n\nThis is as much as I can remember. Maybe if you look up some of the \ndetails, you can find a more complete article on the internet. Of course, \nmost of it is purely speculative, or, should I say, an educated guess made \nby people who understand the physical and biological mechanisms at play, \nbut can't really say with certainty what would actually happen.",

This planet has 3 sun ( each in a very specific orbit and \ndistance ) which makes for very interesting seasons, and there is only 2 \nhour of night time for 52 hour of day time.\n\nThese conditions are very different from our own planet earth, and so the \nplants, in order to survive, as most other species on this alien planet, \nevolved to withstand huge amounts of radiation/uv and climate changes. \n\nWith continuous amount of light and uv, mutations and growth were \ninevitable. These plants could take Co2 from the air, isolate the carbon \nand rearrange them in a very specific way to make a shell as strong as \ndiamond. So they were not prey anymore, in order to survive and dominate \ntheir surrounding they did not need to kill other species, they were \nstronger than any other herbivore who would want to eat them, needless to \nsay they were not concerned about predators.\n\n\nMillions and millions of years passed, most of the species that walked the \nsurface of the planet were no more. Because you see, it is a very \nunforgiving planet, with its extreme amount of radiation due to 3 suns, its \nvolcanic eruptions, and solar storms capable of burning alive any creature \nand plant on the surface once every few million years, boiling down the \noceans. Only our little species with its shell hard as diamond and its \nmetabolism craving for radiation and uv could survive this long in these \nharsh conditions.You could almost say these plants were meant to live in \nhell.\n\nThey saw 7 extinction, and survived them all, they were left alone in the \nplanet. \"The chosen species to survive.\" With all other plants and animals \ngone, they were able to spread through the surface of the planet.\nThese plants need very specific minerals all around the world in order to \nlive but their root can not be everywhere, so they evolved to take of their \nroot and walk far away distances ( very slowly ) those who could not take \naway their root were doomed because it is not radiation or volcanoes that \nkilled them, it was hunger.\n\n\nIn order to survive, these moving plants shared their minerals, water, life \nstock. They lived in some kind of plant harmony if you want. Even if from \ntime to time some violent mutation occurred, they did not survive because \nit was not \"each for his own\" as on earth, they needed one and other in \norder to survive, if they were not helpful to each other they could not \nlive, so only the pacific genes remained. Also they were always strong and \nindestructible by other species, and they did not need their meat or \nanything, they just wanted to live, live and grow as long as possible.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about a life form like this ? Tl;dr : Their consciousness \nwill be very very different from humans or any other animal we know. They \ndid not need to be smart and predator-like to evolve but they did evolve \nnonetheless because of extreme mutations due to radiation and they evolved \nto be \"good\" and not territorial and aggressive because in order to survive \nthey needed to be helpful to each other or else their species would have \ndied.",

One such mutation may have a \"violent \ngene\". And without some force to prune out such a mutation, it is likely \nto, instead, prune out the more benign specimen of the same species.\n\nThe benign version must therefore have some method of self-protection from \nsuch mutant versions of itself in order to survive long enough to create \nspace flight and reach our planet.\nWhile having a tough enough head to survive the age-old rock-to-the-head \nmay work initially, it's a lot easier to find a bigger rock than to evolve \nan even tougher head.

However, I was talking in \nbroader terms, like, why we are territorial.\n\nThese behavioral patterns have appeared and reappeared before and after \nmass extinction events, in practically all genus. And the simple reason for \nthat is that they are not motivated by any specific environment or genetic \npath. They are required for practically any type of creature to exist in \nany universe.\n\nAs noted above, the only practical way to avoid the need for violence, and \nthe engrained violent instinct that would result from such a need, is to \nout-reproduce any external threats. In a way, this is similar to how flies \nwork on our planet. Due to their high reproduction rate, they don't have a \nneed to attack other creatures or protect their territory.\n\nYou offer a similar suggestion in the form of immortality. However, that \nsolution is not workable. It suggests the existence of a truly \nindestructible creature. And that requires the physical impossibility of a \ntruly indestructible object. Even diamonds can be cut, and even black holes \neventually dissipate. Nothing in this universe is completely immune to \ndamage. Entropy always wins.\n\nYour second suggestion, a super-intelligent race, does not preclude violent \nbehavior. Sure, thanks to our technological advancement, we live a life of \nluxury, without daily struggle against the elements. But this was achieved \nby trampling the environment around us beyond recognition. These \nsuper-intelligent creatures would necessarily need to, and will, use their \nsuper-intelligence for purposes that do not involve being at harmony with \ntheir surroundings.\nSure, they can eventually become so advanced, that very little in the \nuniverse is an actual threat to them (Except, perhaps, others of their own \nspecies). But by then they will have spent generations upon generations \nremoving everything that did threaten them. And that sort of instinct \ndoesn't just up and poof one day. Evolution has a sense of inertia. Those \ndestructive instincts would remain.\n\nOne possible alternative is actually the non-natural one: A benevolent race \nthat was engineered by a superior non-benevolent one. It's not entirely \nfarfetched for members of a violent species to prefer engineering a \nnon-violent one which would not threaten them.

Now if you think \noutside the box ( outside earth limitations ) its totally possible for \nalien life form to be something completely different from us.\n\nThey may be too intelligent to even bother with lesser creatures likes us, \nthey may be brutes with very advanced technology and their only instinct \ncould be to kill and conquer all other life forms, or they may even be \nimmortal- asexual ( or homosexual ) beings because they wouldn't need to \nreproduce since they are immortal.\n\n\n\nSee my point ? You can not say \"aliens can only be like this\" because they \ncan be anything really.",

Imagine if every last human \ncollectively gained \"enlightenment\", and decided to each live the rest of \ntheir life seeking knowledge and happiness, while forgoing all physical \nneeds and desires. While there may be a chance that all of those people \nwill live very happy lives, extinction would arrive within a generation. \nThey may prefer it, but nature would not, as they are expelled in favor of \nspecies that focus on survival and reproduction instead.\n\nOf course, if you believe race continuity is a higher value, you may \ninstead opt to optimize reproduction beyond what our instincts dictate, and \nconsider this to be \"enlightenment\", from a point of view. On some level, \nthis is a sacrifice of individual happiness in favor of, shall we call it, \n\"the greater good\".\nBy contrast, the view that it's okay for the species to become extinct so \nthat you can live a full happy life is equally valid, just not maintainable \non a grander scale (Since you deny any potential descendants the same \nopportunity, and this \"way of life\" would disappear along with you and your \nspecies).\n\nMyself, personally, would pick the 1000 years, but only because that's part \nof my, shall we call it, \"faith\". Or perhaps a better word is \"ideology\". \nUnless that misery comes from tolerating an undesirable, in which case I \nwould pick removing the undesirable even at the potential cost of life.

Especially since you had successfully \nproven me wrong.\n\nI'll admit I hadn't considered this possibility. A species can survive and \neven thrive without having to resort to violence, simply by out-reproducing \nany external harmful force. I don't know if this is what the people above \nwould call \"enlightened\" but it's a workable solution: A species completely \ndevoid of violent instincts, yet focused on reproducing, and, by proxy, to \npositive interaction with others.\n\nThe down side is that such a species would actually be WORSE for us than \nthe violent conqueror. Arriving in massive amounts, they would act like \nlocust, bringing a message of peace, while, at the same time, consuming our \nresources at a rapid rate. While attempts to eliminate them would be met \nwith little to no resistance, they would remain futile, as their sheer \nnumbers would be simply unmanageable. And, when they arrive on our planet \nthey would be interested in only two things: Testing the possibility of \ncoupling with members of our species, and attempting to get resources, \nhaving exhausted those of their own home planet, and every other planet in \ntheir path.\n\nAnd the best part of it is, we'll be the ones who look like the evil \nviolent race, when we try to do some \"population control\" on the incoming \npeaceful horde.",

One thing \nabout being alive is understanding that your body is essentially \"using\" \nyou and your consciousness to achieve its simple goals; survival and \nreproduction. Considering that you could produce a virtually unlimited \nnumber of offspring, your drive to reproduce can override you drive to \nsurvive. Your drive to survive can override your drive to be happy. Since \nwe know that we are held hostage by our flesh and that we all experience a \nvivid life and can feel great pain or pleasure it can make for a much \nbetter present life to treat love as the top priority. If you try to live \nwith the constant idea that you and your species are damned if you fail to \nsurvive best, you will live in a state of fear and strife.

Or rather, it is found in the relation of one \nmoving object in space compared to another moving object in space. Time, \nthen is a function of space, and not a dimension in the way of dimensions \nas we normally think about them (trajectories of movement within Space, ie \n3D Space).\n\nThat time exists as such is easy to establish. Simply observe an object \nmove from 'A' to 'B', measure the distance travelled, then calculate the \nspeed of the object by comparing the distance with how long it took the \nobject to travel it. And thus one can imagine time being stopped locally \nwithin a black hole, or in regions of space where temperatures equals \nabsolute zero. In these Places there are no movement, and so there are no \n(internal) time. There is still outside-time, obviously, as time is \na general function of the universe in it's entirety. \n\nYour argument is valid, since it touches on the notion that time \nshould have dimensional properties - ie the fourth dimension - and it does \nnot. As you very correctly point out to other posters in this thread, one \ncannot travel in time except by virtue of the mind (remembering past and \nprojecting future). But your argument is also very much philosofical, since \nyou also write off the very real nature of time as being the way to \naccurately express the speed of movement. The notion of past, present and \nfuture (beyond their applications within natural science as reduced, \nsimplified events) are firmly lodged in philosofy.\n\nSo, to sum up, time is an integral, defining function of space. Arguing \nthat time-epochs does not exists as actual 'places' is only valid inside a \nphilosophical discussion. Anywhere else, it simply does not make sense - \nhence the philosofical quagmire;-) ",

I was referring to non-\"brain\" neural network \nwhen I referred to the \"the depth, control, and number of available senses \nand motor functions\". My understanding, which you seem to share, is that \nwhile the brain is small, the neural network is large enough to support a \nbody of that size. However, intelligence requires a lot more than a bunch \nof responsive neurons. The brain-to-body comparison refers to the central \nprocessing unit and often disregards the rest of the nervous system. I am \npersonally way more interested in emergent systems and epiphenomena. I.e. \nmoving beyond *where* the neurons are and figuring out how a very basic \nmechanism like synaptic sensitivity build-up can lead to huge effects like \nmemory, when put into a system that employs it millions of times. I am \nconvinced that alien brains, should they exist, would show a lot of \nconvergent evolution with ours but am equally wary of ruling out the \npossibility that they will exhibit some new, spectacular architecture - \nlike multiple, parallel streams of consciousness or more rigid memory \nretrieval.

In addition there are also \nunderstood to be neural bundles elsewhere in the body called plexus' or \nganglions. these are usually seen as a junction and are really common among \nthe sympathetic nervous system. Could it be possible these ganglion's and \nplexus were more developed in these super-sized reptiles and included the \nsomatic neural system and allowed limited processing with signals to/from \nthe CNS proper to allow cohesion and control.

HOWEVER, there are myriad other factors involved, which \nsurpass just size. Brain structure, used neural pathways, pruning, \ncogitative optimization and the depth, control, and number of available \nsenses and motor functions - All of these would have as much (if not more) \nof an effect on intelligence. There is a lot of misinformation and \nmisunderstanding of nature vs. nurture which lead to some racist or \nsimilarly dangerous attitudes but there you have it. Intelligence, like \n\"consciousness\", is an epiphenomenon - a collection of hundreds if not \nthousands of factors. Oversimplification is just as bad as ignoring Occam's \nrazor. ",

The moment an animal has evolved to be smart enough to begin \nbuilding a civilization, they will do so, and not wait a couple of 100 \nmillenniums more for a bigger brain to do so.
