Second, \nhere is something that is not an opinion, it is a fact; English only \nspeakers and people that grew up in American or non-Japanese culture only \nbelieve that there is more emotion in Japanese (or non English/first \nlanguage) voice acting because they don't understand the tiny details about \nthe culture themselves, nor the speech mannerisms, tone, inflection, etc. \nThis means that your brain takes what it does know (the subtitles) and \napplies the other stuff that it does know to it (tone you understand, \nmannerisms you understand, inflection you understand, the stuff you don't \nget with subbed) and typically your brain will make it as enjoyable as \npossible.

Who \nwould Scarlet and Sage be? There's really not enough evidence as of now to \nmake a clear-cut statement regarding Team SSSN's theme. But one theory is \nthat they're based off of the 4 main characters of the story \"Journey to \nthe West\", the story that Sun Wukong, the Monkey King is from. That \ncharacter being who Sun is based off of (obviously). Check it out, I think \nit's at least plausible. Plus, it's not like a character can't be based \npartially off of 2 characters.

They're confident that they don't have to rely on getting the \nfans \"feels\" bubbling with a forced romance, and that a woman doesn't need \na man to be strong.\n\nNow, if a love interest does present himself, it'll feel more natural \n(hopefully), because the writers spent time establishing her as an \nindependent character, and now a romance can be a side benefit, rather than \na hindrance ",

When pronounced phonetically it sounds like \"Ruby\". The \ncharacters on Team RWBY are all allude to certain fairy tales (Red Riding \nHood, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast and Goldlilocks respectively) and \neach also has a connection to a flower (Roses. Myrtacea, Nightshade and \nBell Peppers respectively) and each of those flowers are commonly found in \nthe colour of their character. Furthermore all the colours that make RWBY \nare existing variants of roses.\n\nJNPR when pronounced phonetically sounds like \"Juniper\" which is typically \nblue in colour. The characters on Team JNPR all reference, and are designed \nbased on, figures in history or literature that are known to have \ncross-dressed. Jaune Arc is based on Joan of Arc. Pyrrha is potentially \nbased on Achilles (as well as numerous figures in history going by the name \nof Pyrrha or Pyrrhus) whom once disguised himself as a woman and took the \nname \"Pyrrha\" Thor, off whom Nora is loosely based once disguissed himself \nas Goddess Freyja in order to infiltrate a fortress and steal Mjolnir. And \nHua Mulan whom Lie Ren is loosely based also disguised herself as a man in \norder to serve in the army in her aging father's place. Each also alludes \nto a colour. Jaune is french for Yellow. Pyrrha has greek (latin?) origins \nand means \"fire red\" named after the red hair of Pyrrha from Greek \nmythology. Nora's name can be seen as short for Eleanora which means \n\"Light\" and Ren is Japanese for lotus which commonly come in the colours \npink, white, blue or red. Given his aura colour it  may be considered that \nhe references the pink lotus which is the supreme lotus.\n\nLastly: Rubies are red, junipers are blue, potentially referencing RvB \nwhere the two mains teams are Red Team and Blue Team.",
