Also for city rides try not to use public \nbuses much rather use uber or ola , the rates are very cheap compared to \nUS.Also as another comment said you should visit part street , its a pretty \ngood place. Hope you'll have a great time in the city of joy. cheers.\nps: Try to stay in a standard hotel in south kolkata and dont consult with \nany brokers. You can always find good hotels online for as low as $15-20 a \nnight.",
