All of the exercise \nliterature I have read firmly states that glycogen is the primary \nlimitation on human muscle performance.  If newer information has changed \nthat, I would be quite interested to read it. \n\nFatty acid and amino acid metabolism can provide a very low baseline power \nlevel specifically in very slow twitch muscle fibers.  Even trained \nathletes can't muster more than 100-200 watts of body power output on those \nenergy reserves which limits you to no more than a fast walk or very \nrelaxed jog.  Any exertion beyond that requires muscle glucose metabolism.  \nLike I said, I would be genuinely curious to see references to the contrary \nbut everything I have read is that glucose is the dominant power source for \nmuscles during any non-baseline activity.\n\nI suppose that the body may fall back to non-glucose energy sources for \nbaseline exertion levels comparable to sitting in a chain, commenting on \nYoutube.  But that's really not what our musculature was built to be used \nfor.\n\nYes, I am quite aware of the relative energy densities of glycogen vs fat.  \nHowever, just because the body maintains its long-term energy reserves in \nfat, doesn't mean that the latter is our primary energy source.  There is a \nreason that losing weight is so difficult - our bodies have to be in \noverall energy deficit, using up all the glycogen and even breaking down \nmuscle tissue before we hit the fat stores to a significant extent.  Keto \nbreath isn't exactly a sign of a healthy diet, after all.  But yes, you are \ncorrect that fatty acid breakdown comes in downstream of glycolysis. It's \nbeen about a decade since I've had to have those pathways memorized and \nsome of them are getting a bit mixed up in my memory. \n\nBut that is all a side note to the basic fact that glucose is by far and \naway the most universal energy source for all life on the planet.  You do \nsee a decent number of organisms that can use pyruvate and citrate as  \nentry points for their energy source, glucose is king.  The energy \nmetabolic pathways we have are most likely all just derived from glycolytic \nmetabolism, with various entry points along the way such as acetyl-coA and \ncitrate which allows other metabolic sources to tie in to it.

If glycogen was our main energy source we \nwould weigh hundreds of kilos more than we do. In fact, once glycogen \nstores are full, excess consumed glucose is stored as TAGs in adipose \ntissue. It's why you get fat if you drink coke all the time. Adipose fat is \na far more efficient storage medium as it is much denser.\nSmall quantities of glycogen are indeed stored in muscle to fuel short \nbursts of very strenuous exercise, and glycogenolysis is triggered (in this \ncase) by adrenaline. However, under normal conditions, it is fatty acid \nbeta-oxidation that provides atp for cellular metabolism. If you don't \ntrust me I can provide references, although I'd have thought that it's \nquite obvious that if we used glucose for movement, we'd have to constantly \neat glucose or go hypoglycaemic! (we can in fact maintain blood glucose for \n10 days a without food, after which the brain switches to ketones.\n\nIn the cns and pns (neurons as you put it), glucose is the main energy \nsource, for some quite interesting reasons that I'll mention if you are \ninterested. However, 25% of brain metabolism is still reliant on one \nparticular fatty acid, oxalone. Besides, the nervous system only accounts \nfor 20% of oxygen consumption (and therefore metabolic load), so you can't \ncall glucose the main fuel source based on that.\n\nYou're point about proteins and fats being converted to glycolytic \nintermediares is rather inaccurate. Some amino acids (derived from protein \nin diet or skeletal muscle) like alanine, and the glycerol part of TACs \nare/is converted to pyruvate, which is not glucose despite being in the \nglycolytic pathway, so I'm not sure why you've lumped them all into \nglucose. They simply share some intermediates.\n\nHowever, most amino acids like glutamine are converted directly into \na-ketoglutarate, a part of the Krebs cycle. All fatty acids are converted \ninto citrate, and it is generally impossible to convert FAs into glucose.\n\nSo, in conclusion, although the brain uses glucose as it's main (but not \nonly) energy source, the rest of the body uses fat and, to a lesser extent \npeptides, as it's primary fuel.

According to \nmaslow you must satisfy one level before moving on. Thus physiological \nneeds must be satisfied before anything else, then you move on to safety \nneeds, and then to the need to belong. Its not saying that the need to \nbelong is more important than hunger, just that physiological needs such as \nhunger must be satisfied before the need to belong. Of course this is not \nalways the case, at times you can have motivations that will mess with this \nhierarchy. An example would be say ignoring your need for sleep or food and \npulling an all nighter to study for a huge test. Im sure there are better \nexamples than this, but this is what i could come up with. I hope this \nhelps, and sorry in advance if it doesn't.
