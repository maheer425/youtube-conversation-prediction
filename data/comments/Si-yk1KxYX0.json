Your cat does not know that it is 'your \ncat'.. from its point of view, it is its own mind! Please pay attention to \nhow your cat responds to what you do to it! It might not like what you do \nto it! Sometimes cats will swipe at you lightly and almost-lightly bite you \nplayfully, that is one way that they play.  Mind you, I doubt that a cat \nwould have that level of rapport with someone who keeps it imprisoned and \npays no attention to the fact that it has its own will.\n\nYou are telling me it is commonplace for people to \"pet\" their cat in a way \nthat is unpleasant to it to the point that it has to react?

                    "text": "+Caitlin Veal Well, training would be involved, and lots of it.  I have \ntrained my girls from the moment they adopted me.  I have one that follows \nme from room to room, that just needs to be in the same room as me, but I \nhave another one that insists on getting in the way when I'm in a hurry. \n There were two solutions for the one that gets in my way.  The first one \nwas to pick her up and carry her with me, placing her down out of the way \nwhen I get to where I need to go.  That didn't work, because she would \nscoot quickly out of reach after she realised what I was doing.  Since she \nwas approx. 1.5 years when I got her from the rescue, I couldn't train her \nfrom her kittenhood, and she can be a bit skittish with sudden movements, \nso when in a hurry and she gets in the way, I'll stop and mimic running on \nthe spot, which sends her scurrying ahead.  She also demands LOTS of \nattention, when my older girl is out of the room (Older girl chases her \naway, she is VERY possessive of me in our room).  So the younger one is \ninsistent that I pay her attention as much as possible.  She is a VERY \nloving girl.  When she becomes annoying with her bugging for attention, \nI'll give her attention for a good 20 minutes or so, but then I'll gently \nbut firmly place her next to me on the couch.  If she gets up for more \nattention, I repeatedly gently but firmly place her next to me on the \ncouch.  If it continues, then I gently, but firmly hold her there.  When \nshe began to learn to stay, I would pet her as a reward, and show her that \nshe will ONLY get pet when she behaves.  I also talk a LOT to my girls. \n They LOVE being talked to, because it's still giving them attention.  They \ndo eventually learn to understand simple things, like 'No', 'Stay', 'Good \nGirl/Boy!', 'I Love You!' and be sure to let your boy see your expressions \nas you teach him these words.  It takes great training and greater \npatience.  Also, whenever he chirps at you, reply to him.  My older girl \ntalks to me ALL THE TIME, and I reply every time, even if it's 'Yes?'.  She \neven has certain calls for certain things, and I've learned to understand \nwhat she's asking of me with the tone she takes.  They learn to understand \na LOT.  I hope this helps.",

And you should also get them \nvaccinated when you take them to the vet. Be sure to always use a cat \ncarrier when you are transporting a cat because they may jump out of your \narms if they get frightened. If you can't catch the two semi-tame cats, you \nwill need to borrow cat traps from your county pound. You will then need to \ntake them to get spayed or neutered and then board them at the vet's office \nuntil the vet can take the stitches out. Release them in your house near \nsome food. But PLEASE DON'T dump them at the pound where they will be \nmurdered. And PLEASE DON'T dump them somewhere else where they will starve. \nFor more information, look up Alley Cat Allies on the Internet and contact \nthem if you need to. Also, if cost is an issue, look into low-cost \nspay/neuter programs in your area. Thank you for being a kind person and \nfeeding those cats. \n",

I could compare this now to the \ngirlfriends I've had, but that would be too much. ;) Like I said, each cat \nis different, you don't need any other theories about why they are.\n It also depends on the race.

At that point I \nthought \"fine, cuddle with my hair\". He then did this every night for his \nentire life. My second cats mom got run over by a car when he was 9 weeks \nso even though I got him a month later, same issue, sepapated too soon. \nHe's 12 y.o now, still tries to suck on owners' earlobes daily.\nCats should be at least 12w before taken from their mom but all cats are \ndifferent and some need to be more/less than 12 weeks. \nHave seen cats suckle on dogs, owners shirts, ears, hair, blankets etc. \nSometimes it becomes a life long behaviour but is rarely dangerous. Also, \nnipples are meant to be suckled, I think it would take a lot for your cat \nto actually damaging him-/herself that way.",

I like to \nthink a cat who has never been outside might not have any wish to do so. \nBut if he does, him getting lost is the least of your worries. Like dogs, \ncats can always find their way back home. The bigger concern are all the \nhazards he can run into outside such as mean dogs and other aggressive \nanimals, diseases carried by fleas and ticks, and moving vehicles. However, \ncats are usually good at staying out of trouble. And so long as the cat has \nhad all his shots, including rabies, and is given a good flea and tick \npreventative, he may do just fine outside. I myself always let my cats go \noutside when they wish and they always come home later. Also, a GPS collar \nisn't a bad idea, so long as you don't think it may get snagged and lost \nsomewhere while the cat is out exploring.",

You can get \nspecific cat grass from pet shops. If he goes outside, you just need to \nkeep an eye on whether the grass might have been treated at all, as that \ncould cause problems. If he's stopped eating grass, (along with the food \nbeing part digested, rather than regurgitated!) that could indicate a \nfurball blockage that's built up.  Here's some more info about grass and \ncats. http://www.knowyourcat.info/info/catingrass.htm  \n\nIf he's still vomiting after having some grass, or specially developed \nfurball remedy, I'd suggest going back to your vet as they SHOULD be able \nto feel if there are any major blockages. If they cannot, it may be a good \nidea to have an ultrasound. I had a cat (a Siamese called Delilah) who was \nvomiting part digested food for many months. I eventually saw another vet \nat the same practice and they could feel a blockage straight away. She had \nultrasound and there was actually a tumour, that they successfully removed. \nShe was fine afterwards, but I was angry that I had been to them so many \ntimes, knowing in my heart that there was more to it than this one vet \nthought. But she was my first cat and I thought vets were infallible, and \nthat it must be something minor and I was paranoid. I hate to think how \nmuch she was suffering from pain before the truth was found. It's always \ngood to get other opinions, as you have had. But as the problem has \npersisted without resolution, it's better to get it checked again, if the \ngrass and hairball remedy don't resolve the situation. NOT by the vet that \nthought him being sick was due to him smelling other cats you've had \nbefore, though! That is the weirdest thing I've ever heard. Scent-marking \nin those areas I can understand. But, vomiting? Bizarre! Hope you get somme \nanswers soon. H x",

                    "text": "+francesca palmer Nobody really likes sick. Most of all, your cat. You \ndon't need to study it for longer than a couple of seconds. Which you would \nbe doing as you clean it up anyway! It should be very obvious what the \nconsistency is, unless you are doing that blindfolded! It's either slightly \npuffed up biscuits (where they've soaked up some liquid!) or more of a \nsmooth consistency. I would have thought the 3 vets you went to would have \nasked about the form the 'puke' comes in. The first type indicates \nregurgitating, probably due to having too much food available. The second \nimplies that, as the food is part digested, this happens further down in \nthe digestion process. That may be due to a blockage of some sort. Maybe \nfur balls or something similar. I would also suggest you look at how much \nwater you have down for him, particularly as you seem to keep his bowls \ntopped up. Generally, for every part of dry food, they require 4 times that \nvolume of water. You could try the bottled water, or a water fountain with \na filter. The fountain would be better to ensure he's drinking enough \noxygenated water, which a bowl is not. Also water, if not using a fountain, \nshouldn't be served in a plastic bowl as the plastic makes it taste \nunpleasant. A glass, stainless steel, or ceramic bowl is much better, and \nhe'll therefore probably drink much more.",

Will let you carry them and hold them like a child, and \nit's not a breed, it's a medical condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia or \nCHat/CHittens. These animals are born with a less developed cerebellum \nwhich is basically brain damage. It's usually difficult to adopt them due \nto people being put off on taking home a 'damaged' kitty. I myself did not \nwant one. My wife picked one at the animal shelter and I was like no no no \nno no no not that cat, any cat but him. Not the brain damage part, the \npacing and meowing, a total handful. Then I found out he had CH and I was \nlike \"Baby, the guy says he's brain damaged\" my wife didn't care. My wife \nis awesome. I relented. We adopted. I named him Corky and he is one of the \nbest cats I've ever been with. He could not walk very well when we got him \nand didn't move in a normal way, he would whip his head around constantly \nlike Stevie Wonder playing on the drums, and he couldn't jump, was always \ntripping over himself, and basically lacks all of the inbred grace and \nbeauty of feline kind. He is a perpetually drunk kitty. But as he developed \nand grew from a kitten into a cat, his coordination improved to the point \nthat most people don't realize he's special. He can jump on the cat tree, \nhe can run, and the stiffness in his gait is almost un-noticeable if you \ndon't know what to look for. This cat.....You can sit him in the bath with \nyou and bath him in a BATH and he just snuggles up like it's the best. You \ncan trim his nails and he doesn't care. He doesn't jump on the kitchen \ncounter, he doesn't try to eat whats on your plate. He's playful but not \naggressive. He loves to be picked up and handled, and he never presents the \nbelly only to claw you when you touch it. He's like pudding, you ladle him \nout of whatever container he's in and he flows into your arms like a bowl \nof jello you scooped out and he will just lay in whatever position you put \nhim in, and just love everything you do together. They love to be stroked \nand held and they are just the greatest lap cats.\ufeff",

They have never worked \nunder human supervision.\n\nPets are not something most people have ever had the luxury of keeping \nthroughout human history. Breeding working animals created dogs that \ninteract with us, cats used as pest control and bred for looks are not \ngoing to be like dogs any time soon.",
