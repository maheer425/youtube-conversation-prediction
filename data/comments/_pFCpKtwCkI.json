This is highly relevant, even when talking about WWII and plays a \nhuge role into how Germany, Switzerland, and Austria interact with one \nanother even today.\n\nAt the same time, Germany would have attacked France, no matter what, as \nGermany and France had been rivals eversince Charlelemagne split its empire \ninto what would later be France, Germany, and Italy. Since then both France \nand Germany tried to conquer the other. The treaty of Versailles of 1918 \nwas a response to the previous treaty of Versailles from when Prussia beat \nFrance, a war that started because France was occupying Germany, which was \na result of .... you get the picture. It wasn't until the Treaty of 1963 \nthat both nations finally left this rivalry behind them and try their best \nthat future generations won't play the blame game.\n\nGermans, however, didn't have a problem with the British. Prior the war, \nthe German national anthemn, \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\" was using the exact \nsame melody as the British \"God save the King\". During the war, the British \ncrown even had to change their German surname during WWI to highlight to \nthe British people that they were, in fact, not siding with Germany.\n\nGermany's entire conflict with Great Britain during this time rests solely \non the shoulders of Wilhelm II who thought that his British side of the \nfamily is at fault for his birth deformity. Wilhelm also turned out to be a \nhorrible leader who saw this war as a game, and kept sending letters to his \ncousin \"Nicki\", as he called him, the tsar of Russia, despite him being the \nsupposed enemy. Furthermore, Willhelm also only used the German navy once, \nthen never again as those were his favorite troops. And it was also Wilhelm \nwho went against Bismarck's policies and insisted on Germany having \ncolonies abroad, which he ended up losing at the end of WWI. Naturally, the \nGermans grew weary of such a leader and feared that only a democracy could \nprevent another such ruler, which is why, for Germany, the war ended with \nthe abolishment of monarchy and the founding of the Weimar Republic.",

It could go either way.\n\nBecause byzantine empire still exists, we'd still get the italian city \nstates.\n\nThe other germanic kingdoms would still form, possibly at the same time. \n\nThe huns would still pillage and disappear soon after, as nomadic tribes \ndo.  This might have more consequences for italy though.\n\nEurope would depend even more on the east for knowledge and commerce.\n\nSpain would probably remain visigoth, or become entirely muslim, and the \nchristian (or in this case, germanic) uprising would all be due to \ncharlemagne rather than asturias or aragon and catalan or what have you.  \nIt's possible that aragon and catalan would still exist and start a \nreconquest, but the spanish language would end up more germanic than \nromance sounding.\n\nEurope would no longer use roman numerals and latin would no longer be \nrequired learning in schools (oh noes! D:).\n\nThe holy roman empire would still exist... or it might not, given there's \nno religious unifying reasons for its formation.  Though there'd still be a \ndominate frankish element, and later there'd be fueding germanic kingdoms \nin central europe.  Also, it wouldn't be called the holy roman empire \n(obviously).  Maybe just east francia, or german francia or heartland \nfrancia.\n\nByzantine empire would still get pillaged in the  fourth crusade* and later \nusurped by the turks (given the mongols still exist).  This still causes \nthe migration to italy and the wealth of italy giving a tech boost to \neurope enough that european kingdoms can start tech boosting themselves.\n\n*Only this time, it's not a crusade; it's just a conquest of greed without \nthe same religious trappings.  This is what it was originally.  It's also \npossible that the germanic religion could unite itself under greater powers \nlike the vikings (and also the franks, pushing germanic religion).  Their \ncould be the equivalent of a crusade for odin or thor.  Especially since \nthe byzantines would be worshipping greek gods, and not german gods, so \nthat gives the germans some religious reasons.\n\nSo basically, not much would change without the roman empire.  We'd just \nhave a modified cultural background that's even more germanic than it \nalready is.  :P\n\nOh yeah, and organized religion would have less of a foothold too.  So you \ncan thank glorious rome for organized religion having our balls in a vice.  \n:)\n\nIn short, Rome destroys carthage and weakens persia, which are the two \ngreat powers that could have resisted muslim conquest.  Rome is the \nbreeding ground for christianity, and it's communicative infrastructure \nenables its spread.\n\nIt's possible that islam would still grab hold of africa.\n\nAnd india remains isolated.  :P",

Politically, Serbia stopped \nintegrating with Russia's economy and culture ever since it's de jure \nindependence in 1878. and turned to France as a role-model of development. \nBut after Bosnian crysis 1908. Russia became more interested in the affairs \nin the Balkans and wanted to revive the mid-19th century 'brotherhood'. \nThis was not going well for them as long as France and Britain kept \ninvesting in Serbia and backing it up. Things changed only after Balkan \nwars - Britain put a collar on Serbia in those wars and did not allow it to \nintegrate certain territories which were won and controlled by its \nmilitary. Serbian government's main goal was to gain as much of territory \nnear the sea coast as possible. But Britania, ruler of the seas, did not \nwant anyone else in the Mediterranean and Serbia had progressed in its \nterritorial gains way to fast for their liking. France and Britain just \nwanted the Ottomans out. Once that was over, there was no need for the \nformation of a new powerful, unified Balkan state (goal of Serbia: \nYugoslavia). They wanted only small nations in the Balkans (easy to \ncontrol). Post WW1 Yugoslavia happened only because USA strongarmed Britain \nand France into accepting that idea. Britain was only allowing Serbia to \nintegrate Bosnia, but had to withdraw in the end. France also pushed for \nthe disintegration of AU and succeeded.\n\nThe Russian Tzar backed the Serbs because he had romantic ideals about \ncommon origins (not that it isn't true, it just was not pragmatic at the \ntime) and purpose: one day there would be a nation of all Slavs led by \nRussia - bolsheviks kinda messed this up with the USSR, although USSR was \nstill a pretty strong nation. It just was not unified under the ideals \nRomanov hoped for.",

Like Czechs and Slovaks, forming Czechoslovakia \n(both nations were opressed - czechs by germanization, slovaks by \nmagyariztion). So these two nations established Czechoslovakia after WWI \nwhich was a great benefit (and were not the only nations). After \nWWII Stalin took a part of the Slovak part of Czechoslovak republic - \nCarpathian Ruthenia, and made it part of the Soviet Union (as a part of \nUkraine, where it remains today, forming most of the Zakarpattia \nOblast). Czechoslovakia was never a part of the Soviet Union, just a \nsattelite state. In fact, nobody liked the Soviets very much and for good \nreasons. Inspite being Slovak, I to not want the Carpathian Ruthenia, a \nformer part of Slovakia back. You cannot undo injustive by making new \ninjustice. I believe borders should stay as they are today and all states \nshould benefit together. The EU is a very successful project, the economies \nof all countries are linked together in a way that starting a war is simply \nnonsense and would harm everybody (this was not the case prior to WWI and \nWWII). And I would like to see Ukraine as a whole in the EU as well one day \n(including Crimea, annexed recently by Putin). The EU is not perfect, but \nstill better than the alternative.

And at least in my opinion the \nsingle good thing about communism is that it focuses on finding a place for \neveryone and attempting to not leave anyone behind. But then again, do some \npeople deserve to get left behind? There are people who are hard-working \nand people who are lazy, so if we give the lazy person the same benefits we \ngive to the hard-working, wouldn't that destroy the hard-working one's \nmorale? The most important thing about capitalism is that it is a \"natural\" \nsystem and therefore it forces individuals and companies to compete with \neach other. Even though it is a cruel system, it is a working system.\nI would argue that even in this new \"mechanized\" future, humans would still \nhave jobs. If not as workers in production then as mechanics for the \nmachines in production. And as machines get more effective and cheaper, \ncompanies invest on more machines and therefore more people in design, \nproduction and maintenance of these machines. When the steam engine and \nfactories first were invented people were afraid that it would make the \nfactory workers obsolete, and they were right. But are 90% of the people \nout of job nowadays? No they aren't, because new jobs were created on the \nfields that the mechanization of the previous fields had made possible. \nMore people began to work on \"serving\" jobs such as restaurants, clubs, \nmovie theaters, supermarkets ...You name it! No-one could have even \nimagined in the 19th century that someone could work as an \"IT-support \nperson\", but still somehow they do.\nThe free market is a strange and wonderful tool in my opinion and I \ncontinue to believe in it! :)",

It is \na direct response to the way industrialization was destroying traditional \nlife-ways and turning people into cogs in a great machine.\n\nIn the same way, we are looking to a future where human cogs are no longer \nneeded in that machine.

There are \nstill people alive who were around at the same time as the archduke. With \nthis in mind I think its more than fair for me to call the archduke out for \nhis actions and point out that he was a tyrant and nothing less.\nIf we're going to excuse the Archduke then we should excuse Hitler because \nboth were grown men at the time, performing vicious deeds some 20 years \napart only.\n\n\nIn regards to your attempt to retort my slaver metaphor all I have to say \nis no, just no.There is no such thing a a good criminal, its a paradox, \nonly criminals. And I'm sure if you spoke to any black man or indigenous \npopulation of a colonised country they would VERY strongly disagree with \nwhat you just said. In addition that was a poor attempt on your part to rip \napart a popular saying, which I'm surprised you never heard of.\n\n\nDid you even read the links you provided me? Those are the most horrific \nexamples of colonialism and imperialism ever. By putting those links in \nyour argument you only reinforce my point. If you were going to disagree \nwith me why didn't you put a positive example of colonialism? What you just \ndid looks like you're arguing with yourself? I feel like your disagreeing \nwith me for the sake of disagreeing or some misconstrued attempt to defend \nMr.Green.\n\nIf you actually read your own links you would understand why the \nAustrian-Croatian relationship was not a positive one but was one of \nexploitation.\nDid you know the king of Belgium was awarded the congo because he promised \nEurope to modernise the people and build infrastructure but he instead \nexploited them? Sounds similar to the archduke doesn't it?\n\nAnd that united states of Austria never really had any substance. It was \nvaguely mentioned, no real plan was ever drawn up. It was just an \nacknowledgement by the Archduke that Austria and Hungary could not control \n12 other nationalities alone. They had to let minorities into their \nparliament or risk potential revolt down the line. This just shows how \nracist the royal family and government were, they didn't let 2/3 of their \npopulation participate in politics and denied basic human rights because of \ntheir race. There was a segregation. The Archduke was simply trying to \nsecure his future throne, which was imploding by this stage. The Austrian \nempire was ravaged with internal instability caused by racism, the most \nrigid class system in Europe at that time, and a heavy iron fist to \ndissidents.\n\nRobert I feel like you're disagreeing with me just for the sake of \ndisagreeing. Go read your links that you posted in some attempt to retort \nme and please don't come back until you know more about WW1 besides this \nvideo. Good luck to you.",

Plus no one could really gauge how \nterrible and bogged trench warfare would end up being, see how most \nsoldiers though the war would be over by Christmas. The true blame lies on \nsimple breakdown of communications and the arms race ",

You may be murdered for your skin colour, \nassaulted if you're not religious, and subjected to discrimination if \nyou're female. All legal, all tested in court and confirmed.\n\nFor example legal racist murder was confirmed to exist in Florida, shown in \nGeorge Zimmerman vs Florida, where a paranoid racist childkiller shot a \nrandom kid for walking down his neighbourhood, and wasn't even arrested. \nWhen public outcry forced a trial for murder, he was acquitted despite \nconfessing to the killing and all forensic evidence tying him to the crime. \nThere was no defense of any kind. Zimmerman's attorney argued instead that \nthe murder was legal because he was defending himself against 'the black \nmenace' and according to the court, US laws indeed allow for that.\n\nIn addition to that you can be seized by the secret police and disappeared \ninto a secret concentration camp for torturing, and held indefinately \nwithout trial. While Obama's presidency has made such occurances rare, if \nthey even continue at all, this is legal in the US.\n\nThere is no equality before the law either. US law allows discrimination on \na variety of grounds. The ERA amendment that was meant to stop this, and \nmake the US the last western country to adopt formal equality before the \nlaw, has been stopped and sabotaged by republicans and other \nultra-conservative groups like libertarians for decades now.\n\nDo you know how the first article in the Dutch constitution reads?\n\"All who are in the Netherlands, will be treated equally in equal \ncircumstances. Discrimination based on religion, views, political ideology, \nrace, gender or any other grounds, is forbidden\".\n\nThe US does not have a law article like that at all.

School Shootings: School shootings happen all over the place, but you \nalso need to take in account the US has the worlds third largest \npopulation. \n\n3. No healthcare for the non-rich: I would really love universal \nhealthcare, and it might be able to work, but it is also very complicated. \nI think that if the US cut its defense budget by a lot (We would still have \nthe highest so people who think China will invade the US wont have to worry \nxD) and then have the government (Not employers) pay for the healthcare \nwith that extra money. \n\n4. Republicans: Not any worse than democrats.\n\n5. Libertarians: Somethings they believe are too extreme, but they are prob \nthe best party in the US.\n\n6. NRA: I guess they can like guns if they want i don't what kinda life \nthey are about. \n\n7. Lack of Protection by law: Eh we are protected by the law...\n\n8. Lack of equality before the law: There is equality before the law sadly \nthough there is not equality before other people. \n\n9. For one thing you can't legally murder someone over their skin color in \nScotland: (You only have white people except for the demoman) You can't \nlegally murder someone over the color of their skin, and the fact that you \neven said this ruined my idea that you were a partly intelligent person.

At all.\nLook, this whole \"Ukrainian Nazi coup\" and \"ethnic tensions in Ukraine\" \nthing is quite simply nonexistent. Media who report strong the far-right \nrising to power in Ukraine broadly fall into two categories: Russian \npropaganda mills, which we'll not bother discussing and Western media, who \nfell for the trap of \"a shiny story to tell\". You see, when western \njournalists write about Ukraine they, as with all other news, are required \nto deliver an interesting story. Most of their readers know nothing about \nUkraine and will not be interested in getting to know the true roots of \npresent conflict in Ukraine. Instead they grab the all familiar to the \nWestern reader paradigm of ethnic conflict and political extremism. Viola, \na familiar and interesting story. Largelly fictional, but oh so shiny.\nThe truth is, while extreme political parties exhist in Ukraine, Svoboda is \nnot one of them, it's a front for several large businessmen trying to \ncapitalise on a certain image, they are about as far right as some \nrepublicans in the US. Sure, they have clowns like Miroshnichenko, and its \na testament to how desparate to how desperate Ukrainians got under our \nprevious President, that such clowns got any support at all.\nDon't take my word for it, do a reality check against this notion of \nUkrainian nationalists coming to power:\n1) You yourself could not name more than one member of Ukrainian \ngovernment, who has affiliations with a supposedly rightwing party. One out \nof over 20 and I'd say I never heard of him doing anything at all. Here, \nI'll help you out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatsenyuk_Government - there \nare two more guys from Svoboda, both also in positions of zero power.\n2) Surely, with rightwing parties being so much in power we'd witness some \nexamples of their actions, laws passed, nationalities opressed, that kind \nof thing. Where are they?\n3) We had presidential elections this several months ago, after the \nsupposed rightwing coup. Rightwing candidates had sub-backgroung noise \nlevels of support. All, I repeat, all rightwing candidates summed together \ngot around 1,5% and that's less voices than one Jewish liberal businessman.\n4) Svoboda got around 10%-ish votes in 2012 parliamentary elections. People \nwere desperate and would vote for anyone who promised to oppose Yanukovich, \nwho was turning Ukraine into his own little authoritarian princedom. Even \nasshat clowns Svoboda, who, for all their rhetoric were just after \nlegislative cover for their real estate business. With Yanukovich gone \nSvoboda's support dropped to where they'll most likelly not make it into \nparliament anymore.\nFor what it's worth I'm a Russian speaking citizen of Ukraine, half-Russian \nethnically, I'd kinda notice if there were Ukrainian nationalists in power.",

                    "text": "+Ben B Allright, hate to have to do this to you, and hate to have to spend \ntime on this rather uninteresting subject. But here we go.\n\nFIrst off, lets get some facts straight and educate you a little bit.\n\nThe geopolitical deterent system that was in place in 1914 consisted of \nseveral alliances, that up to a degree had been in flux. But at the time of \nthe war the situation, speaking in very broad terms, was like this: On the \none hand you had the Franco-English-Russian alliance and on the other hand \nyou had the German-Austrian/Hungarian alliance who had a wavering partner \nin the Italians and a, by all considerd very weak, partner in the Ottomans \n(the English can be considerd a wavering partner in the opposing alliance, \nbut they turned out to be rather unflinching when the fighting started). \n\nSo these opposing blocks where all very much aware of there respective \nmilitary capability's. One of the important factors when considering these \nmilitary capability's was considerd to be the mobilization speed (and the \nrailroad systems that facilitated them.).When one country mobilized, the \nother countries had to mobilize in return in order not to be overrun. Very \nimportant factor to keep in mind for later on. \n\nAllright, so the English and the French had developed a joint mobilization \nplan, of which offcourse the Germans and the entire population of all \ninvolved nations where aware. They allready had mass media in those days. \nThe Germans had made counter plans to deal with this double threat, of \nwhich they knew it was to much to handle in the case of a two front war. \nThis counter plan involved a quick march through Belgium in to France, \ncutting of the English assistance on which the French where counting to tip \nthe balance in their favour. \nObviously the English and the French where fully aware as well of the \nGerman mobilization plans and their strategey to counter their joint \nmobilization plan. In fact, it is important to note that the Germans had no \ncontingency plan, this was there plan A and B. Of which the French, \nRussians and the English where also fully aware. The point being here that \nthe Germans could not envision any other way of dealing with the situation. \n\nAllright, having said all of that we can now move to the other front. The \neastern front. \nAfter the assasination the Austrian/Hungarian empire felt it was forced to \nrespond. They, after much ado, orderd a partial mobilization, stricly \nfocussed on Serbia, which was responsible for the assasination of the heir. \nSmall point to make here, just because it is important to me personally. \nThe main reason the Serbs assasinated the archduke was because he was a \nmoderate. And by being a moderate he would decrease the resistance to the \nAustrian/Hungarian empire, thereby making it more difficult for the Serbs \nto stir up nationalism and anti Austrian/Hungarian sentiment, on which they \nrelied to further their dreams of a large Serbia, and we all know what a \ngreat idea that was. So again a case that proves a point made in a earlier \ncrash course episode about the dangers of being a moderate. \nBut enough of this little side track. The Austrian/Hungarian empire orderd \na partial mobilization and was about to punish the Serbs for assasinating \nthe heir to their kingdom. The Russians felt like they had to protect their \nspere of influence in the Balkans and had to protect the Serbs. Key factor \nto note here is that the Serbs did not dare to reject the ultimatum send by \nthe Austrian/Hungarians untill they had assurances from the Russians that \nthey would interefere and had started their \"pre-mobilization\" plans. The \nsame can btw be said about the Austrian/Hungarians, they only dared to do a \npartial mobilization after they had assurances from the Germans that they \nwould back them. The Germans at this point thought it was a) fair enough \nthat the Austrian/Hungarians responded to the assasination and b) that if \nthey stould firmly at the side of their ally it would reduce the chances of \nan all out war. \n\nAllright, having said all of that. After the Austrian/Hungarians declared \nwar on Serbia the Russians fully mobilized (a full mobilization also \nentailed a mobilization directed at the heart of Germany). The same day the \nFrench also started mobilizing. The Germans then even waited a full day, \nwhich in terms of the mobilization rates and speeds of those days was a \ngigantic military gamble, which they took because they still hoped that \nthere would be a peacefull and diplomatic solution (they where offcourse \nfully aware that they where in the underdog position in the case of a two \nfront war).\n\nAfter all of that they also felt forced to mobilize. At this time the \nAustrian/Hungarians and the Serbs where allready fighting and the Russians \nwhere preparing to invade both Austrian/Hungary and Germany, and the French \nwhere also preparing to invade the Germans (they had allready fully \nmobilized and considering the capability's of their railroad networks, the \nGermans had perhaps one or two more days to respond, else they would not \n be able to stop even the French from marching straight in to Berlin within \na month). \n\nSo everybody at this point knew, the Great war was on. The Germans knew as \nwell and they also mobilized and enacted their one and only contingency \nplan that allowed them some hope of victory. A quick march threw Belgium \nwith some swift victory's over the French, cutting of the English support \nand then focussing on, what was considerd to be the more serious threat, \nthe eastern front. \n\nThe Germans send an ultimatum to the Belgiums, demanding acces due to \"the \ngrave and historical circumstances\". The Belgiums, being spurred one by the \nEnglish who assured them of their support refused. The Germans enterd \nanyways, declaring war on the Russians, the French and the Belgiums. Which \nwas then used as a casus beli by the English political elite to convince a \nprior to that unconviced English public, to also enter the war. They then \nproceeded to enact their joint mobilization plan with the French, which the \npolitical elite of the Enlgish had always been planning on doing. The \nGermans never even managed to cut swiftly through Belgium, because the \nEnglish and the French where there soon enough to cut them off. \n\nSo yes, you are correct, the Germans where the first to declare war. They \nindeed did invade a \"neutral\" country (Belgium). But for the rest, your \nstandpoints on these matters clearly indicate a lacking historical \nawareness. \n\nI could further debate with you on matters such as the possible existence \nof a Anglosaxon, German or a Russian perspective. But since you have so \naptly demonstrated your lack of historical awareness allready, I feel no \ninterest in exchanging more serious thoughts on these matters with you. \n\nI would like to close this little educational session with a simple remark: \nGo read a book. Preferably, if you are actually interested in the start of \nthe great war, \"the Sleepwalkers\" by Christopher Clark. It is mandatory \nreading for all undergraduate history students and political science \nstudents at my university (the Univeristy of Amsterdam) and I am sure you \ncould benefit greatly from it. Untill you have read at least that, I feel \nvery little need or interest in further debating you. Since untill you have \nat least read that you have not even aquired a rudimentary understanding of \nthe causes of the war. \n\nIn closing. If you care at all about assigning blame, which I personally do \nnot care about. This because I believe more in Steven Lukes three dimension \nof power paradigm which seeks causes not neccesarily in personal agency (or \ncountry agency, in so far as that even exists) but in systems of power that \nform and regiment the way in which people and societies think and behave \n(developed in the 70s but still one of the foundational elements of any \nacademic political science udergraduate program) .\nBut if you would like to play the blame game, the Germans are one of the \nlast great powers who you should be pointing your finger to. They had the \nleast to gain from a war, they had hardly anything to do with the causes of \nthe war and the formation of the alliance system that made it a great war \nwas more of English making, in which the Germans simply responded by \nre-establishing and strengthening their bonds with their neighbours the \nAustrian/Hungarian empire.\nSo, if you would like to play the blame game. You might want to point your \nfinger in these directions:\n\nSerbian dreams of a pan-Serbian state (or a great Serbia, which turned out \nto be  a terrible idea for all non-Serbian people forced in to that state, \nleading up to the last session of ethnic cleansing we have seen in Europe, \nwhich we now call the Balkan war.)\n\nRussian interests on the straight and there political dancinig with the \nEnglish over control of it. Which explains the importance the Russians \nascribed to their sphere of incluence in the Balkan. \n\nThe English who felt threatend because of the rise of Germany as an \nindustrial production powerhouse (which was beginning to dwarf and \nmassively outcompete the English production) and who plotted to do \nsomething about that. And by doing so developed the \"alliance system\" which \nthey then had a hand in making this alliance system implode on the Germans. \n \n\nHope you read it and become a bit wiser, a bit more educated. Study your \nhistory, lest it repeats itself... \n\nHave a nice life. \n\nWith friendly greetings from Amsterdam\n\nPS just because this is the internet, that does not mean you can get away \nwith flapping of uneducated opinions. Keep that in mind the next time you \ntry and expound on your \"beliefs\" on whatever the subject may be. Think, do \nI actually know anything about the subject matter I am about the flap of \non? If not, best to keep quite, study and listen for a while before you \nstart talking and making a fool of yourself.  ",

Didn't an anarchist assassin kill Empress Elisabeth? Of course \nthere were people on the Balkan that wanted to free themselves from the \nAustrian oppression. \nEven if the government had people that knew about the assassination, it was \nstill Austrias fault for giving an ultimatum which no sovereign country \nwould accept. Austria wanted the war as Serbia was it's main opposition on \nthe Balkans and had earlier clashes with Serbia.. Also what was he doing in \nSarajevo on 28th of june, the most important Serbian date.. Clear \nprovocation..\nEven if we neglect all the stated above, what was Austria doing in Bosnia? \nAre there any Austrians there? No. They violated international agreements \nand annexed Bosnia which had a 43,5% Serb population and had a historical \nSerbian claim. So yes.. your imperialism and greed led to WW1.",

During the Balkan Wars(1912-13) \nTankosic developed a reputation as an outstanding partisan fighter. He was \nrewarded by becoming the commanding officer of Serbia's guerrilla academy \nat Nis.\n\nTankosic and Dragutin Dimitrijevic were involved in the plot in 1911 to \nassassinate Emperor Franz Josef. When this failed, they turned their \nattention to the the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The men \nwere concerned about Ferdinand's plans to grant concessions to the South \nSlavs. The leaders of the Black Hand feared that if this happened, an \nindependent Serbian state would be more difficult to achieve.\n\nWhen Dimitrijevic heard that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was planning to visit \nSarajevo in June 1914, he sent three members of the Black Hand group, \nGavrilo Princip, Nedjelko Cabrinovic and Trifko Grabez from Serbia to \nassassinate him. Nikola Pasic, the prime minister of Serbia, Pasic heard \nabout the plot and gave instructions for the three men to be arrested. \nHowever, his orders were not implemented and Archduke Franz Ferdinand was \nassassinated.\n\nSeveral members of the Black Hand group interrogated by the Austrian \nauthorities claimed that three men from Serbia, Tankosic, Dragutin \nDimitrijevic and Milan Ciganovic had organised the plot. On 25th July, \n1914, the Austro-Hungarian government demanded that the Serbian government \narrest the men and send them to face trial in Vienna.\n\nOn 25th July, 1914, Nikola Pasic, the prime minister of Serbia, told the \nAustro-Hungarian government that he was unable to hand over these three men \nas it \"would be a violation of Serbia's Constitution and criminal in law\". \nThree days later Austro-Hungarian declared war on Serbia.\n\nVoja Tankosic served in the Serbian Army during the First World War and was \nkilled in action during the Serbian retreat in 1915.\" While the Serbians \nwere not exactly happy with the two, they refused to hand them over \nconveying quite a... not good message to Austria.\n\nhttp://www.firstworldwar.com/source/austrianreport.htm: \"Record of the \nDistrict Court at Serajevo, touching the proceedings there instituted \nagainst Gavrilo Princip and confederates on account of the crime of \nassassination perpetrated on June 28, 1914, on His Imperial and Royal \nHighness the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Her Highness the \nDuchess Sophie of Hohenberg.\n\nGavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Cabrinovic, Trifko Grabez, Vaso Cubrilovic and \nCetres Popovic confess that in common with the fugitive Mehemed Mehmedbasic \nthey contrived a plot for the murder of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and, \narmed with bombs and in the case of some of them with Browning pistols, \nlaid wait for him on June 28, 1914, on his progress through Serajevo for \nthe purpose of carrying out the planned attack.\n\nNedeljko Cabrinovic confesses that he was the first of the conspirators to \nhurl a bomb against the Archduke's carriage, which missed its mark and \nwhich on exploding injured only the occupants of the carriage following the \nArchducal motor car.\n\nGavrilo Princip confesses that he fired two shots from a Browning pistol \nagainst the Archducal motor car, by which the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and \nthe Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg received fatal wounds.\n\nBoth perpetrators confess that the act was done with intent to murder.\n\nThese confessions have been fully verified by means of the investigations \nwhich have taken place, and it is established that the deceased Archduke \nFranz Ferdinand and the deceased Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg died as a \nresult of the revolver shots fired at them by Gavrilo Princip.\"",

Because they didn't want an Emperor who would give equal rights to \nSlavs, to be on the same level as Austrians and Hungarians. And this was \nmentioned in a movie (to some extent documentary) from this year that was \nmade by Austrians and had Austrians as actors. \n2. Except Bulgarians, Albanians, Romanians and Greeks which are not Slavic. \nAnd yes those that lived in Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro were \nconsidered Serbs back at the time period, because they were for the most \npart. They wanted to create a South Slavic nation, which means that Croats \nand Slovenians also count, although it is a little disputable for Croats \njudging by some newer research.\n3. Serbia didn't want a war, since the nation was already exhausted from \ntwo Balkan Wars and most of its army was very old, looking at the age \nstructure. That's why Serbia accepted almost all of the points of \nAustro-Hungarian ultimatum only to prevent war at all cost. But it couldn't \naccept the last two because it was a direct attack on its sovereignty and \nindependence as a nation. And it obviously had full right to protect that, \nright? Or are Serbs not allowed to protect their independence and all \nothers are?\n4. They gained what they wanted because they truly were the winners against \nAustria-Hungary. And Habsburgs and their Empire fell not because of Serbs, \nbut because of all other nationalities that were demanding independence and \njust autonomy, that was a headache for an Empire through the whole 19th \ncentury.",

This probably would have \nresulted in a French-Polish victory against Tsarist Russia which would have \nmeant that all Europe (even the small German states) would be under \nFrench-Polish control, so Germany would have never been united unless they \nstarted a united revolt against French-Polish.

Despite warnings such as this one, \nPresident Truman supported establishing a Jewish state on land primarily \ninhabited by Muslims and Christians. \n\nFew Americans today are aware that US support enabled the creation of \nmodern Israel. Even fewer know that US politicians pushed this policy over \nthe forceful objections of top diplomatic and military experts. \n\nAs this work demonstrates, these politicians were bombarded by a massive \npro-Israel lobbying effort that ranged from well-funded and very public \nZionist organizations to an \"elitist secret society\" whose members included \nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis.

As well in the years after the first world war did Poland annex parts \nof Germany, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia and Russia. As well as when Poland cut \nthe Germans off from East Prussia and began abusing German Polish citizens. \nOn top of that Germany protested to the allies that they where breaking the \ntreaty of Versailles by not reducing their armies as well, in witch they \nagreed to. Also keep in mind while Germany was trying to negotiate with \nPoland the Polish where told by France and Britain that there was no need \nto be reasonable because Germany could not fight a war against all of them. \nFinal thing before i end the comment Germany offered peace multiple times \nand it was declined by all major ally powers before and during the war, \neven worse the Polish army was mobilized before the German army was with a \nplan with France to invade a full month before the Germany plan.

While it's true Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmostly (though in Germany's case not entirely) left out of the colonization \ngame, that wasn't a significant impediment to their economy or growth. \nOverseas imperialism was primarily about prestige not the income (after \nall, why would France try to own most of the \npretty-much-useless-at-the-time Sahara desert if colonial income was their \nprimary concern). Imperial prestige competitions proved fairly easy to \ncontain relative to European issues (after all, Britain and France had \nnumerous imperial disagreements as did Britain and Russia and yet those \nthree found themselves in alliance against Germany) so imperialism probably \nwasn't a major contributing factor. As for Austria, it was trying to expand \nbut NOT to keep up with France and Britain in imperialism. Austria-Hungary \nwas trying to hold together their multi-ethnic empire by suppressing Serbia \nwhich was using nationalist ideology to try and convince Austro-Hungarian \nSerbs and other yugoslavian groups to break away. Securing Serbia was an \nattempt to keep their empire whole not an attempt to gain imperial prestige.\n\n+wh4t Spain technically did have a couple of colonies in Africa, \nspecifically parts of modern Morocco and Western Sahara as well as \nEquatorial Guinea, but it was a bit player. However, Portugal had far more \nextensive colonies (as did Belgium and the Netherlands in Asia) and yet was \nalso minor. Germany held a few colonies, but pretty much all just left-over \ncolonies that Britain and France didn't want (like Namibia that's mostly a \nbig desert, Cameroon that was jungle no one else wanted, and Togo which was \ntiny). Africa was mostly held by Britain and France, Germany was clearly \nsecond tier on the same level as bit players like Portugal and Belgium NOT \non a level with Britain and France. This did annoy the Germans a lot, and \nthey did feel cheated given their relative importance in Europe. But \nGermany didn't start a war over the colonial issue. They were worried \nbecause Russia was modernizing it's army and was allied with France, which \nwanted to retake European territory from Germany (specifically \nAlsace-Lorraine). What Fritz Fischer found was many in the German high \ncommand were concerned that if Russia's military fully modernized then it \nand France could invade it in Europe and carve up it's territory, so the \nGermans wanted a preventative war to defeat those two powers before Russia \nbecame too strong to defeat. As it turned out their timing was poor as \nRussia had improved enough already to not be quickly beaten while France \nand the UK combined proved harder to overwhelm than first thought.",

German-speaking people and other Europeans usually don't AFAIK. \nAlso saying that the German Empire was not made up of multiple ethnicities \nhighlights that you are not very well aware of the make-up of the \nterritory. If you look at the surnames of citizens of the German Empire \nalone you'd see a whole lot of slavic and French surnames. The German \nEmpire was keen on letting immigrants into the country as their knowledge \nand skill proved useful for the economy.\n\nYour other mistake is thinking that a German nation is the same thing as \nthe German Empire. The German-speaking people in Europe considered \nthemselves to be one nation in spirit - divided into countless \nprincipalities and micro-nations after the 30 year war tore the Holy Roman \nEmpire of German Nations apart. There was no such thing as one Germany or \none German nation. The German people wanted a unified country (something \nthat will again play a role with Hitler annexing various German speaking \nregions) and in the 19th century two major principalities emerged, the \nCatholic Austria-Hungary, and the Protestant Prussia who would both manage \nto unify large portions of the German speaking territory while also \nengaging in what German speakers call \"Binnenimperialismus\", a form of \nimperialism in which one conquers neighboring nations and territories.\n\n+Aturo Firestone As to why both leaders are called \"Kaiser\" in German, but \nonly one is referred to as Kaiser in the USA: Ever since Pipin adopted \nChristianity, in the beginning of the Middle Ages, the emperor, or Kaiser \nof the Holy Roman Empire of German Nations was Catholic and seen as the \nprotector of faith. Kaiser being the Germanized form of the word \"Caesar\" \n(or \"cesar\" in English). One of the major elements of the 30 year war was \nthe appearance of the Protestant creed (or evangelical Christians), \nChristians who were against the Catholic teachings. The northern parts of \nthe empire became mostly Protestant, while the south stayed Catholic. Being \nProtestant meant not having to follow the emperor any longer, leading to a \nmultitude of liberties. As time went on, the principality of Prussia formed \nin the north and as this Protestant monarchy started to rise militarily and \neconomically it set its eyes on defeating the Catholic Austria and claim \nhegemony for itself. After the defeat of Austria, they proceeded to call \ntheir leader Kaiser as well and their territory henceforth the German \nEmpire. (This is relevant as Hitler dubbed his nation the 3rd Reich, or 3rd \nEmpire, following the footsteps of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nations \nand the German Empire)\n\nAs Prussia was way more prominent than Austria in the political scene (it \nhad a fierce military, invested heavily into science and technology, and \nstarted exporting massive amounts of products), the Americans came to hear \nmore about the Kaiser from the German Empire, instead of the Kaiser of \nAustria-Hungary. The reason why Austria-Hungary was, at the time, \nconsidered a world power was only because of the historical background: \nTheir leader was the heir of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nations after \nall. Austria was, however, not prominent in non-European media as it \nbasically consisted of an inaccessible mountain region, far off trading \nroutes, not a lot of infrastructure, hardly any railways, and it had \npractically no access to an ocean. Naturally, it was far behind Prussia and \nnaturally most Americans didn't hear from them, thus the term \"Kaiser\" got \nassociated with the German Empire.",
