                    "text": "+Chris Blackmore I have a brother who once thought as you do; I think I \nknow why. There is a common misunderstanding about the way gyroscopes, and \ngyroscopic precession, work. The key is \"torsion\". This refers to axial \nforce, not linear force.\n\nThe videos and images I see online which describe gyroscopic precession all \nuse arrows to refer to angles re-directions of force. It's the arrows that \nare misleading. The force is not actually applied \"in a direction\", but \n\"around an axis\". So, when you hold up one side of a spinning gyro, the \nforce you need to consider shouldn't be represented as a linear arrow \n(acting \"down\" against the other side). even though that is happening.\n\nThe way it should be represented is as an arrow that is curved around the \naxial center of the gyroscope. When gravity pulls one side of it down, it \napplies a torsional force around the center of the gyro. The redirection \nthat occurs as a result of gyroscopic precession isn't a 90 degree spatial \nvector, but a 90 degree torsional redirection around the axis of the \ngyroscope. Therefore, the \"twist\" that gravity is trying to make is \nredirected around the axis of the gyro, not through the space it occupies.",

Now respect the progress \nothers will make by becoming interested in science, attempting to formulate \ntheir own theories & perhaps even come up with something different & new.\n\nAlso, people dress & speak formally....but that is just superficial \nbullshit that doesn't mean anything science.\n\nI only care if a person explores, experiments, & examines.

Physics is \nmuch closer to the examination of 'found objects' (which is how Newton saw \nit, by the way) and the resolution of small anomalies and paradoxes was the \ndriving force. The anomaly in the precession of the perihelion of Mercury \nled to relativity and the so-called ultraviolet catastrophe led to quantum \nmechanics. There has been no major advance in physics for nearly 100 years, \nprecisely because physicists are content that their present theories are \nadequate.

I \nhave made up a short video, 35 seconds, to show how this works. I would \nlike to send you a copy but my attempt is being rejected. It is in an mp4 \nformat which is supposed to be compatable. This machine consists of 10 \nmotors and 8 gyros mounted on two platforms. The drive system rotates the \nplatforms in opposite directions. The total weight is 25 Lbs. and it is \nable to jump from the hook at the bottom of the scale at full throttle. \nUnfortunately it is performing in the ooscillating mode at this time.  So \nit doesn't go anywhere except up and down.\n      \ufeff",

I think trolls \nare amygdala-dominated psychopaths, who parasitize, cannibalize and \nscavenge human energy (mental, emotional and physical) for economic and \nemotional gains. These guys identify destructiveness and sadism with power, \nso destroying something or tormenting someone makes them feel powerful.  We \ncan actually identify this predatory/parasitic human subspecies with fMRI \nscans now. Psychology Today has quite a few articles and Dr. Robert Hare \nhas championed diagnostics. Essentially, the behavior of anyone whose \nmotives and mental activity are governed primarily by the archaic amygdala \nis going to appear intellectually, emotionally and morally underdeveloped. \nAlthough, some are quite good, after a bit of rehearsal and planning, at \nmimicking  intelligence, empathy and moral integrity.\n\nSince their contributions to dialogue is all too often disruptive and \nintended to derail conversations, I've concluded that blocking them is the \nkindest and quickest way of dealing with them.  They're annoying, but \nimpotent. When they leave, they go home to sulk and fester and not back to \n'HQ' to update the 'Anti-Intelligence Agency'. They're just lone \nscavengers. Nothing to worry about. We just need to recognize them for what \nthey are and exclude them, when it's clear they have nothing intelligent to \ncontribute.\n\nI read \"The Universe in a nutshell\".

The \nfact remains that gyroscopes cannot propel or levitate. The basic point is \nthat the plane obeys Newton's Third Law, the gyroscope in the vid above \nobeys it, but no arrangement of gyroscopes can fail to obey it and so \n therefore cannot levitate. On the other hand, the rotating millstones in \nan old-fashioned windmill actually exert a downwards force which is greater \nthan their static weight.

You \nkeep confusing the two. The spinning gyro will always have the same mass \nand the same weight on Earth. On the Moon the weight will be lighter, but \nthe mass will be the same.\n\nAnd I never said anti gravity is a lack of gravity.
