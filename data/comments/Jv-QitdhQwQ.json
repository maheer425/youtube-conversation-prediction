The fact that people are coming to \nyoutube to tell the world that they are fighting technology because those \nwho use it are foolish and not tan is just worrying.\n\nOh, and news flash: Skin cancer is real, and it can kill. Tan doesn't mean \nanything. If you're trying to impress people with your health, show us some \nstats for your most recent 5k, half, or full marathon, recent sports game \nscores, medals for winning state swim meets, some track records, or a \npicture of you summiting a mountain. Anybody can sit in the sun and get a \ntan, or even get artificial ones. It takes time and effort to actually \naccomplish things.\n\nIf you're generalizing an entire continent (Technically America is 2 \ncontinents...) based on a class that sounds a bit like a bunch of 6th \ngraders... well. That's kinda stupid. I'm assuming you mean the USA. There \nare people in South and central America who don't even have access to clean \nwater, electricity, or basic education. I doubt they are worrying about \nminecraft.\n\nIf you want to fix stuff, first learn not to make generalizations, that \n\"America\" is not a country, it's a continent or two, third, that being tan \nmeans nothing and that you should wear sunscreen, and finally, that if you \nwant to make a difference, the youtube comments on a sketch comedy group is \nnot the best place to start rallies to save the world from something you \nnever clearly define.\n\nHave a nice day!",
