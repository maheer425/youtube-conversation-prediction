I \nalso know Canada is bad but not as bad as the South Pole or the North Pole, \nwhere you can freeze your ass to death. Cold is relative. But comparing the \nNortheast and the southern parts of the US, the southern states are better \nplaces to live.\n\nThat's fine if you want to live in a cold place like Canada. Some people \nare OK w/ it. However, most people aren't. In fact, there are almost 36 \nmillion people in Canada. The US has about 320 million people. So something \nis wrong w/ Canada.",
