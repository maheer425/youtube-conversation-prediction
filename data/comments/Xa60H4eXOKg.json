Not the same as 15hr \nshifts in a kitchen but a different kind of challenge, but I'm slowly \nbuilding a small community of subscribers and every time I read their \ncomments, it always makes me smile and realise I love what I do now :) \nPlease feel free to take a look at my channel, my baking videos all have a \nhealthy twist to them as I love making something delicious without the \nguilt. And then there's beauty, fashion and fashion vlogs. Do hope you'll \nlike it! If you scroll backwards enough to my 1st few videos, you'll see my \nchocolatier days when I assisted Ruth Hinks the UK Chocolate Master and \nfollowed her to France last year for the final. Seems like a life time ago \nnow, but think the kitchen days will always run in my blood :) Sorry for \nthe long essay, hope we can keep in touch, love the style of your channel!",
