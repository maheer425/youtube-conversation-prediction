                "text": "Actually, Hazel does not like Pink Floyd. In \"The Fault In Our Stars, she \nsays the first day she goes to support group, she is wearing a t-shirt \n\"advertising a band she doesn't even like anymore.\" She is also wearing old \njeans that \"sag in weird places\" just like in the book, as well. What I do \nfind odd though, is that she is not wearing her old band shirt on her first \nday of support group where she meets Gus ( D; ) , she is wearing a pink \nshirt and a jean jacket. The book also says she had a \"pageboy haircut\" but \nhere, it looks almost as a pixie cut. Don't get me wrong, the book was \nfantastic and I'm sure the movie will be too, but just stating some \ndifferences. I don't really care about the hair, I'm just confused about \nthe Pink Floyd shirt...\ufeff",
