What's wrong with that ?\n\nThen you say I'm judging you which I'm not doing, I'm just stating the \nobvious : we (Muslims as a community) often argue over the least important \nissues and that's a shame. Me saying this doesn't make me a good Muslim or \nyou a bad one...\n\nAnd finally, my comment was a reply to what the other brother was saying \nabout people focusing on the smallest things, I was just agreeing with what \nhe said I was not talking to you so... yeah chill.\nPeople have the right to an opinion Halima, no need to call others childish \nand idiotic when theirs doesn't match yours...
