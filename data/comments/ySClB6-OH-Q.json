Flea bites allow for the bacteria to pass the skin barrier. Y. \npestis expresses the yadBC gene, which is similar to adhesins in other \nYersinia species, allowing for adherence and invasion of epithelial \ncells.[38] Y. pestis expresses a plasminogen activator that is an important \nvirulence factor for pneumonic plague and that might degrade on blood clots \nin order to facilitate systematic invasion.[27] Many of the bacteria's \nvirulence factors are anti-phagocytic in nature. Two important \nanti-phagocytic antigens, named F1 (Fraction 1) and V or LcrV, are both \nimportant for virulence.[21] These antigens are produced by the bacterium \nat normal human body temperature. Furthermore, Y. pestis survives and \nproduces F1 and V antigens while it is residing within white blood cells \nsuch as monocytes, but not in neutrophils. Natural or induced immunity is \nachieved by the production of specific opsonic antibodies against F1 and V \nantigens; antibodies against F1 and V induce phagocytosis by \nneutrophils.[39]\" ",
