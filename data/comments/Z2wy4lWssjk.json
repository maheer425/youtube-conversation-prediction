                "text": "Hi Jamie, I went to your restaurant in Sydney recently. I was so \ndisappointed with the place. Extremely overcrowded, everyone was tightly \npacked in, very noisy, loud 80s music blaring, dark and dingy decor, \ntoilets were horrible, and the food......the worst of all. Very overpriced, \ntiny servings and the meals were nothing to write home about. I was \nhonestly so disappointed. We were a table of 8 and not one of us enjoyed \nour dinner there. The table next to us complained about the small portions \nof food. Our eke sister complained the tables were so close together he had \nno room to move. I really love watching your videos but we'll never be \ngoing to Jamie's Italian again. Why do you want your name associated with \nsuch a bad restaurant? \ufeff",
