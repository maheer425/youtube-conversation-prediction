My problem with Microsoft is they're trying to nudge \ntheir users into adapting bullshit that nobody wants (Windows 8). I own a \ncomputer, not a tablet (and I never want a tablet). However, Windows 8 was \ndesigned from the ground up to be targeted and applied for use on tablets, \nor tablet-esque laptops (touchscreens, removable keyboards, etc). I am \naware that the new Windows 8.1 comes with a \"Desktop Mode\" where it will \nclosely resemble it's predecessors in terms of appears and ease of use, but \nit's ease of use is still not as open, easy, and versatile as Windows 7. \nWhen I built my gaming PC last year, I purposely opted to buy Windows 7 \nPremium, because I didn't want to deal with Windows 8. Now Microsoft has \nmade their list of phase out dates public. Phase out dates are when they \nplan on stopping mainstream updates and support for that operating system. \nWindows 7 is currently set at January of 2015. So yes, Windows 7 users have \nless than one year before Microsoft will stop supporting their OS. You can \npay for extended support, but that is at your own cost, and it will only \nbuy you a few more years time before they stop extended support. Stopping \nsupport means they stop delivering updates that fix security, software, and \nany other issues associated with the OS itself. So essentially, it's either \nbe forced to upgrade, or you're on your own with your OS. The beauty of \nLinux-based systems, there are a shit ton of them. Linux isn't a single \noperating system, it's a plethora of systems built off of the same \n(essentially a baseline/foundation). There are plenty of Linux-based \nsystems out there you can obtain for free, have continuous updates, and are \nhighly open-source, meaning they're modifiable to the user's preferences, \nallow for mods/addons to be created for them. It is superior in this \nregard. I am considering switching over to a Linux-based system when they \ndiscontinue support for Windows 7, unless Windows 9 ends up reverting back \nto a more desktop-friendly user interface. Also, be aware, you can have \nmultiple operating systems on a computer. msconfig allows you to choose \nwhich OS boots with your computer. So you could essentially give another \none a try, and if you don't like it, just remove it.",

This highly untrue opinion (not fact) has been dis-proven many \ntimes, and once by the infamous internet group known as Anonymous. Virus, \nmalware, trojans, and any form of malicious software has to be coded to \nwork on a specific operating system, as well as browsers. This is why it \nappears that Apple computers can't get viruses, because other than for the \npurpose of work, and many school systems using them, they are largely \nunused in the average populace as a personal computer. This creates little \nincentive for hackers to create viruses directed towards Apple systems if \nthe target user base if smaller in margin compared to other operating \nsystems. Again however, research the subject thoroughly, and you will find \nthat Apple-based operating systems are able to be compromised just as other \nOS's are. ",
