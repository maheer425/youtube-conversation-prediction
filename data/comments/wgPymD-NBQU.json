On the other hand, exactly *how* they ruled and \nexactly *how* they died is less certain but we have different accounts by \ndifferent authors - some of them of them of course with their own agenda - \nbut comparing their accounts and applying some elementary deduction with \nthe existing knowledge about Roman society can get you pretty far. Rome was \na literate society and it had a large literate elite who wrote down \nhistories, biographies and other things of note. Much of it is lost, but \nenough has survived from critical periods of Roman history to shed light on \nkey events.\n\nThe time of Julius Caesar and the fall of the Roman Republic is one of the \nbest documented because ancient Romans themselves valued the writings \nconcerned with this period as it was already then understood as having been \na crucial turning point in history. In terms of literature, we have both \nofficial writings by historians but also many collections of letters by \nprominent members of the Roman elite. Being part of the elite, these \nindividuals had both common agendas and conflicting agendas as they vied \nfor power and prestige among each other.

Perhaps a more knowledgeable person can rectify \nany mistakes I make in my presumptions :)\n\nI'm interested more in the legacy left behind by Brutus. His descent from \nan arguable more upright ancestry might have incentivized the Liberators to \ninvite him, as a means to justify and legitimize their killing of Caesar. \nAfter all, his ancestor, Lucius Junius Brutus, had done the noble thing to \nremove a tyrant and return democratic rule to the people. \n\nYet in the minds of the Liberators, were they as noble? IMO backstabbing a \nman because of political reasons would have been the least democratic means \nto an end, yet they claim to be bring freedom. Furthermore how sure is it \nthat the same democratic return is ensured? Did they fear a dictatorship or \na limit to their personal political clout? Maybe they had sought to fill in \nthat political vacuum themselves, bickering and politicking instead of \neffectively ruling the empire, as the video did mention.\n\nAnd where does Brutus play in this? The video did make him out to be the \nyoung man, so perhaps he was naive and succumb to smooth talking? I find it \nhard to believe that a legacy 400+ years ago would have a moral burden on \nhim, but I cannot be sure. Ultimately the legacy he himself leaves to us \ncannot be so black & white. Dante was mentioned for writing Brutus into the \ndeepest parts of Hell, but was he regarding the act of betrayal as the \nworst sin or Brutus? Perhaps Dante had to choose a famous figure in history \nwhose act was condemned enough in his social and cultural context and \npersonal judgement. \n\nI think it really brings into question too the issue of liberty and \ndemocracy in modern times. If the rulers of an empire or country provide \nstability and well being for the people, is authoritarian rule truly that \nevil? I would even go as far to say that democracy and freedom has been \nidealized and worshipped on such a level that masks the limits they can \nreally provide as a social and political institution.\n\nIn the end, we cannot categorize Brutus as a hero or villain, before we \nanswer the question about the costs of liberty :)\ufeff",

I would like to point out at this point that in ancient Greece, \nthe country was filled with city states and depending on which period of \ntime you were referring to, political institutions are very different. For \nexample Sparta was an oligarchy during the time of the Socrates and Plato.\n\nOn the other hand, Athens was a democracy, but a severely limited one with \nvoting power resting in a patriarchal society built upon the backs of \nslaves. What you mentioned does resonate as well and it brings into \nquestion: is democracy achievable and legitimate without first achieving \nequality between all (wo)men? After all, Athens as the hallmark of Western \nhistorical democracy was a society that gave political power to the rich \nmale citizens, without any consideration of the poor or the slaves or even \nwomen. \n\nAs mentioned, I am no expert so take my word with much salt :)",

Simply put, it was an empire \nbuilt on pillage, genocide, slavery and ruled by a small elite of its most \nwealthy citizens. Those wealthy citizens were the only ones concerned with \nsharing power with anyone.  Ironically, the Caesar period was sort of the \nhalfway mark for the empire's lifespan (in the west) and the later half was \nmarked with near constant civil war. With one dictator after another vying \nfor power. The lesson of Rome is not one of democracy, but of power and the \nwill to use it sadly.",
