We \nhave never even hinted at being jealous of the USA or at us wanting the USA \nto be part of Britain again.. The British guy at the end was so unneeded \nand just a way for Americans to feel good about themselves and to keep them \norally deluded, thinking they are the 'greatest country on Earth'.. I love \nthe USA, but that is just unnecessary, sorry,\ufeff",

If they had no mistakes America \nwouldn't be \"the best country on earth to me.\" America most certainly is \nnot weak. But England was coming off the \"most powerful country in the \nworld\" title at that time, and choosing to fight rather than negotiate \nwasn't what I would call a good move. Our navy may be mighty now but that \nwas started in 1812 when we started to take interest in naval combat. I \nalso would like to point out that Napoleon was beaten by a huge coalition, \nnotably England. I was simply trying to get rid of people thinking that \nEngland declared war in 1812, when they were simply trying to pick on what \nthey still considered a weaker country for more naval troops. Originally it \nwas just supposed to be Englishmen who moved to America (who were still \ncitizens), but they didn't care when those born American were abducted. I \ncan also say that many of the \"war hawks\" of the war of 1812 probably just \nwanted a war. I agree, America fought extremely well in that war, but it \nwasn't the smartest decision. It worked out, though, to some extent like \nthe declaration of independence. It was idiocy, but we managed to pull \nthrough, and Americans managed to found the country that will stand in \nhistory as the land of the free and the home of the brave (a line that \nproves the war of 1812 wasn't entirely useless... Just mostly).",

First off, because war should be a last-chance \noption, and second, because it was idiotic. We had somewhere between 16 and \n18 ships to England's hundreds, and while they were fighting Napoleon at \nthat time, once they finished they took Washington D.C... Pretty quickly, \nactually. They might have been able to fully conquer America, if they \nweren't tired of war, and not wanted to fight and risk more lives. I don't \nknow. New Orleans was a miracle, as was Fort McHenry. I'm not sure our luck \nwould have lasted. Of course, New Orleans hadn't happened when the treaty \nwas signed. And yes. It has SO many problems. But it's the best country on \nearth to me.",

It's got a cute and silly \"common enemy\" who \nspeaks to patriotism without anybody REALLY caring, and they fight about \ntheir caricatured disagreements in a cartoon-style way that nobody can take \ntoo seriously.\n\nHaving seen so much political bile, hate, and violence during the past 14 \nyears or so, this is really refreshing. It doesn't even begin to tackle the \nactual issues...but maybe more of these gentle parodies are exactly what \npeople need to help us out of our ruts.\n\nPersonally, I've found it easy to get cynical with age (even here in Canada \nwhere the fights aren't nearly as vicious). Things like this make me think \nthat, eventually, some generation might figure it all out.",

In short, the two parties act a lot like you would expect a divorced \ncouple to do - arguing, bickering, and picking fault at the other. However, \nbecause they are in the presence of their \"daughter\" and the family \ntherapist (which indicates that they want want to make a trend effort for \ntheir daughter), I think it understandable that the \"divorced couple\" would \nturn indicated down at least a little bit.",
