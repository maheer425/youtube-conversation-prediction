I think SM has the tendency \nto promote newer groups quite a bit in their first 2-3 years of activity. \nEXO is definitely gaining a lot of ground thanks to SM's marketing, but I \nthink that SM is giving SHINee a new kind of attention by giving Jonghyun \nand Taemin (and whomever else) solo careers. With those solo careers, \nthey're not building attention just for sales, they're building attention \nfor their legacy.",

I know all of that. What i meant with my comment is \nthat they should get more attention in terms of their talent. I'm a really \nbig fan of exo (they are my favorite group) and other sm groups but i can \neasily say that shinee is the best group sm has. In terms of talent i think \nshinee is definitely one of the best groups out there. And considering \nthat, i do think sm doesn't give them enough attention, if you have in mind \nother sm groups like exo and suju they definitely get more promotions and \nattention from the company, you easily see them making solo stuff and \nappearing here and there. With shinee things are a bit different, yes you \nhad taemin's solo in 2014 but the promo time was so small, usually the \nartists promote for 1 month and do a lot of variety shows and stuff, but \nwith taemin we barely got any stuff. My point is, i do think sm neglects \nshinee if you have in mind the attention that they give to their other BOY \ngroups... (because if we talk about all the groups in general then f(x) \ntakes the trophy lol) ",

But Taemin is the main dancer for a reason. His movements are \namazingly fluid and natural and he can pick up pretty much anything throw \nat him. If you watch the Dance Practice video of his song \"Danger\" even \nEastwood the choreographer for it was amazed by how fast he picked it up, \nhe's been working with hundreds of artists for years. He's just a naturally \namazing dancer, but Key is also a great dancer in his own right and does a \nlot of amazing dancing as well. <3 Kibummie fighting! :3",

If you search Genie/Juliette \nremix live you'll see Taemin and Key doing their dance solo and in \npre-debut times, Taemin and Key also did quite a few dances together. Key \njust had to lay down the dancing to give Taemin the spotlight.

Key isn't lead vocal \nhe doesn't have a voice powerful enough, he's lead rapper though and he's \nthe member who is good at everything since the beginning(now I think we can \nsay Minho is too, and maybe Taemin?don't know if he's good at rapping) so I \nthink if what I read is true:\nJonghyun=Main vocal\nOnew=leader, main vocal\nTaemin=Maknae, Main dancer, lead vocal(if he continues to improve as he \ndoes is singing skills he'll be soon a main vocalist)\nKey=Lead rapper, Lead dancer\nMinho=Visual, Main rapper, Lead dancer(maybe someday lead vocal?

It's humanly \nimpossible as they will be out of breath and that's why they resort to \nlip-syncing. I mean listen to them live and listen to the greats like Elton \njohn or Beyonce. The quality of singing is so damn obvious. \n\nSo what's the difference between them and conventional dance crews? They're \nhot. Simple as that. I'm not saying they all aren't able to sing but \ndancing and singing do not go together. Not only Kpop, pop culture \neverywhere is resorting to these tricks. It's just that if i go to a \nconcert, i want to hear the SINGERS SINGING, not dancing to a record. If \nyou want to add hype, let the singers SING and the background dancers \nDANCE. Combining both doesn't make sense. \n\nIn my opinion, it's due to these culture that quality of songs is dropping. \nI missed the days where lyrics actually meant something and people paid \nmoney for SINGERS TO SING NOT DANCE.

Perhaps their singing would have been even \nbetter if they just stood there in one place, but to be honest ... 3 hours \nof singing.. i could just listen to the album if thats what i wanted.\nIts true they are famous mostly for their dancing, because thats what \npeople want.\nand even though i find their music and voices beautiful, if it wasnt for \ntheir dancing they probably wouldn't have made it into the mainstream, \nbecause lets face it, they are not among the very very best singers \n(technically).\nHowever, i think that it's better to be famous for singing and dancing well \nenough at the same time, than becoming famous for shaking your butt on \nscreen or doing other scandalous stuff in front of a camera. Sadly that's \nwhat music entertainment has become... the music video ends up literally \nmore important than the music itself.\nI think whats more with idols is that as you said, their personalities are \nvery important. Somehow we are allowed to enter a small part of their \nprivacy and get to know them. Its kinda weird when you think about it... \nits almost as if we are drawn into a fantasy. even the word \"idol\" is a bit \nscary cause it implies that they are perfect.. in other words we are \npresented with something almost god-like, and not human beings who sing ... \nand i think that's why many fans feel that they need to defend their idols \nwhen you criticize them -> Its almost as if you are speaking against their \nvery values in life. so in other words people are defending themselves more \nthan the actual idols.\nBUT, and i htink this is a very importand but... some idols are really \nreally grounded and fun and let their imperfections shine on camera. I \nthing shinee is kind of like that especially these more recent years and so \nyou will find that shawols tend to be cool :) \nanyway. end of my two cents ",

TV (which is now the main medium for entertainment and news, \nthough internet is taking over) has also been forced to make things \nflashier and flashier because once you get used to something, it no longer \ndraws you in.

No need to \ncomplicate things. The ones who like it will listen to it no matter what. \nAnd there are a lot of people who like it like me. Who likes some \nmeaningless songs that are actually really upbeat and is good to have fun. \nWhen you are happy you listen to melody/music when you are sad you listen \nto lyrics.

And I think it's pretty \nharsh to judge singers by listening to only two songs. And SHINee is \nactually famous for it's MR removed videos. Go find them and other MR \nremoved videos of other idols. Those idols are trained to sing while \ndancing so it's mostly not a big deal and SHINee is considered to have one \nof the most hard choreos in kpop. While mostly kpop choreos look fancy but \nare actually easy to follow and give chance for the singers actually sing. \nAnd you can see when main vocals sing they stop dancing and so on. And it's \nnot like kpop started the performing while singing. Like Jackson would be \nthe brightest example of someone dancing while singing perfectly. Actually \nevery singer does some dancing or at least walking around while singing so \nI don't know what is so bad about kpop idols dancing. If you don't like \nthis then listen to k-indie or hip hop. Or if you like unimaginable notes \nand lyrics that bring you to tears listen to classical music, operas and \noperettas. ",

It's my own opinion and i never forced it \non anyone. \nAs for why i decided to leave a comment here, i was just browsing though \nyoutube and happened to stumble on this dance practice which is by any \nstandard, quite good. However, trying to sing whilst doing those moves is \nphysically impossible. Even if they manage to somehow to sing the song, the \nnotes they hit won't be there and the \"singing\" itself would turn out to be \nsub-par. Also, even though this is a dance practice video, to me when i \nwatch it live, its exactly what they do here except that their lips were \nmoving.\nNow i have never dissed SHINee cuz i am in no place to judge. Admittedly \nthe only 2 songs i heard from them is this one and Lucifer. Therefore, i \ndid not even attempt to be judgemental since i know for a fact that there \nare \"idols\" who can sing. BUT. And this is a big one. Whenever i listen to \na song nowadays, i often go to find their LIVE versions so that i can see \nwhether they truly have these voices or isit just autotune and lip-sync. So \nfar, i have seen multiple, not just kpop, 'idols' who do just that. And \nthat's what ticks me. Never should anyone lip-sync. \nAll in all, different people have different preferences. Some people want \nhot stars, who kinda know how to dance who often lip-sync. I get that. And \ni'm not dissing anyone. It's just pointing out some facts that not only i, \nbut many have noticed. However, i prefer singers who actually are able to \nhit unimaginable notes at times and sing with lyrics that can make you cry \nyour heart out. Furthermore, it's because of said 'idols' that these \nsingers are sidelined and dying out. You say that i should not complain i \nlisten to what i feel is \"great.\" But if these types of songs are going to \nbe extinct in 30-50 years (I'm 19 so i would prolly be alive then) why \ncan't i complain? \nDo i dislike \"pop\" culture? Yes. Can i hope to change it? No since majority \nof the world prefer your \"variety dish\" as compared to my \"main dish.\" So \ntell me am i whiny just because i have my own opinion and wish to voice it \nout?",

                    "text": "+Jine Lino You seem to be a little bitter about the whole performance \nconcept but I think with kpop the concept is the entire performance. That \nis why there are awards for dance groups and thats why they have a position \nfor dancers. They add to the entire group. Title songs like this, yes, they \ndo mainly sing and dance always but that is because they tend to be DANCE \nsongs, at least in the case of shinee. they do sing pretty decently while \ndancing it too. really im not sure what you want by commenting here. If you \ncomment here, then it is assumed that you are talking about kpop and shinee \nspecifically so?? Are you trying to say that they cannot sing?? There are \nalways pieces on the album where they don't dance at the same time and if \nyou pay attention they perform them well while not dancing. For example, \nperformances on sketchbook tend to be very focused on vocals. There are \nalso idols who don't dance while singing (most tend to be solo singers but \nstill) so if thats what you want its easy to find?? Shinee are a \ncontemporary dance group. They DANCE. Its not like they //cant// sing so \nidk what you want here. There is a lot of diversity in kpop im sure you can \nfind what you are looking for if you would only search. I don't want to be \nrude, but honestly, you sound so whiny commenting this on a DANCE PRACTICE \nvideo of all things. If you think the only things idols sing are pop music \nthan you really don't dig any deeper than the cover huh? The title song is \n\"club music\" as you say, because it is meant to be catchy and draw \nattention to the group so that you look at the rest of their songs. There \nare plenty of meaningful songs from idols and have you ever heard concert \naccounts?? Fans often cry because of the heartfelt performances. The reason \nidols are so popular compared to dance crews and pure ballad singers is \nbecause they do many different things, all in one group. Here let's use \nthis as an example. When you buy a meal, would you want to get the meal \nthat has a variety of good things, or the one that only has the main dish? \nOf course, there are people who will choose only the main dish, you for \nexample, but too many people, the mixed one has more appeal. The bottom \nline is that you should just listen to what you think is great and ignore \nwhat you think is not. I really don't understand why you decided to leave \nsuch a comment here.",
