For instance, \nwe can't just go down to the giant-old-industrial-buildings-store and pick \nup a few locations for a film.  That takes weeks of scouting for locations \n(usually hours away) that will allow us to film on their premises.  And \nthere's 3 different locations like that in this episode.  And when you need \n20 people for a scene including 10 important characters, you can't just say \n\"let's do it tomorrow.\"  You have to wait till everyone' schedules line up. \n But also, as you can tell from the end teaser - we've also shot episode 6. \n With the locations and big cast, it was more efficient to film ep 5 and 6 \nback-to-back before editing episode 5.  If you try to reproduce something \nlike this, you'll discover a lot of things take time that you probably \nnever thought of like constructing costumes and props, waiting on mail \norders, composing an entire original score, etc.",
