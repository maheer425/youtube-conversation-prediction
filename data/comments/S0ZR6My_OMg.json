Who put you in charge of judging whether or not someone is a \n\"real\" fan? The only thing you have to do to be a fan is like Disney. \nThat's it. There's no dictionary definition of a \"real disney fan.\" There's \nnothing that declares what amount of disney facts/movies you need to know \nin order to become a disney fan. So stop acting like there is one. Guessing \nby your comments, I can tell that you are a fan of disney. Well if that is \nthe case, why bash other people who love it as well? There's literally no \npoint to that. Don't you want more people to be a fan of what you're a fan \nof? And who's to say that nostalgia isn't a good reason for liking \nsomething? Here we go again with you being pretentious and thinking that \nyou have the right to judge what is or isn't a good reason to like \nsomething. You've probably heard of the Harry Potter series, correct? Well \none reason why a lot of people love it so much is because they grew up with \nit. Many people still definitely love the story within that's being told \nbut there's something about having grown up with it that makes people love \nit so much. Same with Disney. So the main point of this reply is: Stop \nacting like you're the judge of who or who isn't a real disney fan because \nyou're not and just let people love what they love.",
