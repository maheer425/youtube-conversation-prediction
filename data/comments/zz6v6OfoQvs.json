If \nyou mean places where people live/used to live and you consider big city as \none obeject as well as small vilage, yes, you are right. Because during \nUSSR a lot of money and human lives (of prisoners mostly) was spent on \nmilitary and scientific projects, so a lot of stuff was built (like this \nbore hole). Most of this projects were really expencive and unnecessary \n(like Buran space shuttle), so when the USSR broke down and Russia had a \nlot of problems most of these projects were abandoned due to their \nexpensivness and uselessness. But I think, you can not say that this it the \nmost of Russia, I think you should consider the density of population too. \nNowadays the biggest Russian cities are in good condition, a lot of mony is \nspent on them (though, a lot of money is stolen, unfortunately) old \nbuildings are restored, roads a rebuilt and etc. \nWhile learning more about these ambitious projects, I feel reverence and \nproud, even though I do not like the USSR and I know what have it costed to \npeople of the USSR (while i am russian). \n\n\n\nP.S. I think i should say that living in the USSR was not that bad as it is \n(and was) presented around the world, there were a lot of advantages: free \neducation, medecine, flats, science and equal rights for everyone \nregardless of sex and nationality (except jews, unfortunatetly)",

It is ok to say that the core and the mantle are \nhow they are, but to be taught that this is a \"fact\"... note, not a theory, \nor something that is assumed, but a cold hard fact... is something that is \nflawed. The guy in the video even says \"we know more about what's beyond \nour solar system than what is below our surface\".\n\nYour reply is sound +Nemesis 11FP but you are using the word \"fact\" where \nit cannot yet be taken as a concrete fact. I don't want to argue about \nwhat's below the surface because I'm sure the scientists have a better idea \nthan me, but again, if someone comes and tells you there is a volcano \nunderground because he smells sulfur, is that a fact? Sure, it can be a \nplausible assumption, but maybe there is a factory close by or a chemical \nleak.\n\nI made a point that scientists said at 12KM below the surface the \ntemperature should be 100 celclius. It was twice that. So, if scientists \ncan be wrong only 12KM down, how wrong can they be much further down?\nYou seem to disregard the \"religiously blind\", but yet you are \nscientifically blind if you take every theory as fact, and don't understand \nthat science has a lot of room for correction and proof!\n\nAgain, my argument was based on the way these diagrams are portrayed to \nkids as fact, the same way you probably get annoyed religion is taught to \nkids as fact.\n\n+vakaxx You are a waste of space.

Right? \nThat's not going to happen all at once, you're going to gradually move from \nEarth's surface gravity to that weightless state as you descend.

If you extend this further, astronauts in orbit on the ISS 400km \nup experience roughly 90% of the gravity we do on Earth.

Over these distances, the time to acceleration is going to be within \nour margin of error, so we won't worry about it. The hole is 7.5 miles \ndeep. So, 7.5 miles / 32 mph * 60 minutes = 14.06 minutes to fall. \n\nThat's at surface level atmosphere.\n\nI don't think currents are something we need to account for. If there's air \nrising, there's going to be an equal amount of air going down... it's not \nas if there's a source of air at the bottom. How these currents will work \nisn't predictable, but I think it's safe to say they'll roughly balance out \nover 7.5 miles.\n\nAir pressure's harder to adjust for. I'm working off tables, because I \ndon't have the formulas to hand, but going from 0f to 300f reduces \natmospheric pressure by about 40%. Going from 10,000ft to sea level creates \nabout the same change in pressure. From the surface to the bottom of this \nhole is 4 times that change in altitude... so I think it's safe to assume \nthat the air will be denser rather than less dense -- slowing it more. I'm \nsure someone smarter than me could do a reasonable job of estimating this.\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is the coriolis effect. Anything you drop \ndown that hole is going to hit the side a long way before it reaches the \nbottom. Depending on how smooth the sides are, it may well get stuck. Even \nif it doesn't, I don't think anyone would claim to be able to make a \nreasonable estimate for how it would bounce (or slide?) along the walls and \nwhat impact that would have on the average velocity.\n\nI don't think anyone could give an accurate answer to this without \nexperimentation. But, unless I've made a dumb error in my arithmetic, I \nthink it's safe to say \"at least 14 minutes\".",

Why is he pretending to be \nretarded/childlike/stupid/overexcited?  There is a big issue occurring in \nour culture that revolves around the whole \"I fucking love science\" type of \nattitude.  It's not that, taken literally, \"I fucking love science\" is a \nbad thing.  It's that for some fucked up reason we feel we need to \ncommercialize science as some sort of entertainment product.  Can we just \nstop the nonsense and act like grown-ups please?  Science is great but, to \nthe presenter in this video, please stop trying to act like a goofball.  I \nfind these things interesting and awe-inspiring by themselves.  I don't \nneed the distraction and insult of your stupid 'comic' accents to make me \nwant to learn about science.

I guess they took a place that was most unlikely to move (especially \nin a short period of 24 years) too much to jeopardize the stability of the \n'well' (imagine the fact that the highest we can build with structure \nintegrity intact with metal is around 1km (Dubai building 829m, still \nalmost 200meters short). Imagine doing these drillings in a location where \na vaultline is. Within 24 years, there is most likely to be a tremor \nnihilating all effort done on the project. It might even be, added to  the \ngive reason, another reason why the drill was stopped. In all, there are \nmany interesting things in the video, from many perspectives (even the date \nthey starte drilling and any theories about why they drilled). The video is \nno indepth story, but you can't leave out parts of the already thin \naccummulation of facts.

                "text": "As fascinating as science may be, most of it is theoretical. Since we have \nnever gone deeper than 12 km into the earth, there is no way to KNOW \nANYTHING about the earth's core. It's just a theory!\n\nThere are many such theories, such as, the theory of evolution and big bang \ntheory, for instance. Let's not forget the theory of carbon dating, which \nseems to be taken as fact, when all the evidence points to it's utter \nunreliability. Just because someone with a degree and skills in \nmathematical wizardry says something, does not make it true.\n\nI like this SciShow guy, but his mainstream science bias is obvious. Why \ndoesn't he use his substantial brain to apply the scientific method to \nscience itself? Do a show on; \"Is science really scientific?\"\n\nI'm no scientist but, I do have a brain and from what I can tell, science \ndepends on a belief that there could not possibly be any truth to the Bible \nand that there could not possibly be a Creator. If that's your starting \npoint, how could you ever find truth? Napoleon Bonaparte once said, \"People \nwill believe anything unless it comes from the Bible.\" Lots of people use \nscience to prove the Bible wrong, but is that really science? Shouldn't \nscience start with no assumptions with an open mind? There is a proverb \nthat goes something like this, \"A man who dismisses a matter before hearing \nis foolish.\"\n\nI can't declare the Bible to be true. But I can declare that much of the \nscience we are fed in the mainstream is based on theoretical assumptions. \nWhich is to say, one must believe the assumptions first, or the science \nmakes no sense. It's more like a religion than a search for knowledge.\n\nAt least with the Bible we have archaeological and historical evidence \n(more and more of it every day) attesting to the Bible as a valuable \nhistoric account of life on this planet. It can also be demonstrated that \nthe Bible has accurately predicted future events. That in itself is cause \nfor serious inquiry!\n\nI would not have said these things 5 years ago, but having taken the Bible \nwith an open mind for more than half a decade now, I have come to change my \nopinion about the nature of our reality. I still don't know what to believe \nbut, I am no longer interested in theories. In fact, it sure looks like we \nhave had the truth hidden from us by clever use of theoretical science. So, \nI can no longer blindly believe mainstream propaganda; that includes \nscience and history, not to mention the news media!\ufeff",

And \nwhat really amazes me about all this is people like you actually believe \nthat an explosion from nothing created all this. Or at least an explosion \nthe size of this dot. Well a few years ago it was bigger and earlier bigger \nthan that. And you actually want to call this science. And you dare call me \nstupid. Let me educate you on how it really worked. God spoke all this into \nexistence a little over 6,000 years ago in a six day time span. You can \nactually read about in the KJV Bible that's been proven by science and is \nnot a lie or cover up. Please, I'm begging. Get your facts straight.",

Just laying down some \nkinda realistic figures for others to understand that it's unrealistic.\n\nIt doesn't address your original question though: the main problem is : \ndeepest mines today go as deep as approx. 1km. Here, we are talking 12 km, \nand the limiting factor is not the depth itself (it could be 5 or 20km, it \nwouldn't matter), but the environment conditions that you find at such \ndepth: pressure & more importantly temperature. It doesn't matter if you \nuse a drilling head or an excavator truck: these 2 parameters remain the \nsame and make it impossible to keep digging with available techniques.",
