I \nthink it's more like what Anthropology points out- the question is one of \nbiggest manipulators to an answer.  Anthropology looks at the world as it \nis, and just gets to know it, before forming a question.  I didn't take \nShane's comment as a question of the science- but of how long it took for \nscience to look around.  I think Ekman is awesome- but I think Shane's \ncomment isn't about the finding, it's about why science as a whole looks so \nnarrowly- causing a lot of scientific study to come around rather slowly.  \nArt and Anthropology could definitely speed up scientific discovery!  \nScience as we've been brought to know it is generally all left brain.  Art \nis generally all right brain.  A whole brain will always be most \nefficient.  When we see science and art come together, I think we'll see a \nmassive leap forward in human knowledge and development.  And I know I'll \nbe considered completely radical- but when spiritual development is added \nto this- we will see a whole new paradigm.  I honestly think though, that \nEkman is one of the rare scientists whose work Has begun this balance of \nleft, right, and spiritual.  The whole of his work has an impressive span \nin this light.  Ekman impresses me with how rounded his approach to \nmaterial is- which is why he has made such fascinating and useful \ndiscoveries where many before him simply droned on and on about talk \ntherapy- he's changed the whole field!",

So, let's say without any training what so ever on catching, if \nsomething is thrown at you your reflex would be to move away from the fast \napproaching object or to protect yourself in some way. Now, if you practice \ncatching often, as one would if they were on a football team, the sensation \nof something being thrown at you now changes and now you'll catch it \ninstead of seeing it as a threat. I'm sure you've experienced this \nsituation where you get to a party/gathering and someone just throws a beer \nat you and you automatically catch it. You didn't have to think about \ncatching it, you just did, you didn't \"think\" you had to protect yourself \nby catching this object flying at you or \"think\" about the best action for \nthe best result of the situation. In those cases things happen too fast for \nus to think, so we go off of training. and we just do.                   \n OR, your theory could be true if our brain actually just doesn't store the \nmemory of us thinking about what to do in those situations. Since our brain \nis basically being overclocked at that point, keeping the memory of us \nchoosing which action to take would be pointless and a waste of resources. \nOur brain does this all the time with dreams, because we do dream every \ntime we sleep but sometimes our brain decides the memory of it didn't need \nto be stored.  However, when something is a reflex a different part of the \nbrain is activated than when you are in a thinking process, the brain waves \nof a beginner fighter are different from those of an advanced fighter. But, \nmaybe a different type of \"think\" happens in that area of the brain. We \nstill have so much to discover. ",
