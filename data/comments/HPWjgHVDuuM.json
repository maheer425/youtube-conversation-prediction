Not \"almost no anti-matter\"\n.\nyou said \"(no) Super Nova can form anything but a heavier version of Iron.)\"\nScientists know that elements heavier than iron are formed in supernovae.\nEven if we were not sure how the heavy elements formed, that would not \nimply magical creation, it would simply mean we don't know.\n.\nyou said : \"Organic Evolution is the biggest insanity I have ever heard or \nread about, Study the Miller Experiment or just read about it.\"\nI am familiar with the miller experiment, it showed that organic compounds \ncould form from natural processes. Nothing more. This deals with \nabiogenesis, not evolution itself. Evolution is what happens only after \nsome form of life, or a pre-life self replicating molecule already exists. \nOrganic molecules are now known to exist even in space. I think you may be \nunderestimating how simple these original molecules may have been and are \nlooking at the complexity of today's life molecules like DNA.\nAgain, not knowing how something could happen, still doesn't imply magic.\n\nyou said : \"Somehow Amino Acids in a Primordial Soup magically rearranged \nthemselves into Proper Nucleotides for some basic life form like Algae even \nthough Algae is very complex\"\nAlgae IS extremely complex. No one is saying that the first for of life was \nalgae or anything like it. This shows your complete lack of understanding \non the subject.\n.\nThe first form of life couldn't likely have even had a cell wall, since \nthat would need to evolve. There is nothing that exists today which is even \nclose to that first life form. You probably would not even consider it life \nat all. The only life-like property it had was that it could duplicate \nitself. The most likely scenario is that it was a very simple DNA or \nRNA-like molecule that replicated itself through purely chemical means. It \nhad no biological processes. It didn't move or think or eat.\n.\nOnce again, not knowing how something could happen, still doesn't imply \nmagic.\n.\nyou said : \"It is Estimated that at least 100 new Probably negative \nMutations are passed onto each new generation, Which will be one of the \nmore likely extinction events that humanity will face eventually.\"\n.\n\nOkay so you accept that mutations happen and that they are only \"probably\" \nnegative. On that we agree, but in order to have an extinction event, \nthings have to die. Things with negative mutations have to die. These are \nessentially your own words. If things with negative mutations die, they \nleave behind the things without mutations that are extremely detrimental, \nand also anything with positive mutations... and that's all evolution is. \nThe thing you called an extinction event is already happening every day: \n99.9% of EVERY SPECIES THAT EVER LIVED is already extinct and we have the \nevidence to prove this.",

                    "text": "Ive done more Evolutionary research than you have guaranteed and Creation \nresearch. The Big Bang is insanity and it has been Debunked, The Universe \nis made of many dimensions, At least four. Length, Width, Height and Time. \nThis Big Bang somehow formed physical attractions and physical laws like \nEnertia and Relativity etc. Atoms as far as we know cannot be formed from \npure energy, Atoms are highly condensed energy balls with specific amounts \nof Electrons, Protons and a neutron. The mass of the Electrons, Protons, \nAnd Neutrons are only 1/60,000,000 of the Mass of the Atom, The other \n59,999,999/60,000,000 of the Atom is pure energy. Atoms have thousands of \ntimes their area worth of energy inside of them, We don't even fully \nunderstand what an Atom is just that it has a massive amount of relative \nenergy inside of it. A new study of Anti-Matter shows that in the Big Bang \nto supposedly create atoms you would need an equal amount of Anti-Matter, \nWhen we split Atoms today there is almost no Anti-Matter in Atoms.\nSo The Big Bang magically Exploded for no reason, Created Energy which \nsomehow created Atoms or created Helium and Hydrogen, This Helium and \nHydrogen magically made stars even though Nebulae according to Boyles Gas \nlaw cannot form a gravity well strong enough to form a star. Gas in a \nfrictionless environment pushes away from itself, it does not have enough \ngravitational attraction. So somehow we have stars now, I can't think of \none scientist Creationist, Evolutionist or other than thinks stars even in \nSuper Nova can form anything but a heavier version of Iron. Even in Stars \nlike VY Canis Majoris, Yet the earth has massive amounts of super heavy \nelements.\nSo Stars cannot form the super heavy elements, They need super heavy \nelements to form, And supposing that the earth was formed by Solar Plasma \nit magically has super heavy elements on it, The core of the earth could \nnot form  these elements, If a stars core can't then how can a planets?\nBypassing probably billions of words of arguments and debates concerning \nthe Origins of the Universe, Even if the Universe is self creating there is \nno way that Life is self creating. We are a collection of highly complex \nMacro Molecules that go through beyond complex processes of Mitosis and \nSexual/Asexual reproduction to sustain our existence.\nOrganic Evolution is the biggest insanity I have ever heard or read about, \nStudy the Miller Experiment or just read about it. Somehow Amino Acids in a \nPrimordial Soup magically rearranged themselves into Proper Nucleotides for \nsome basic life form like Algae even though Algae is very complex. These \nAmino Acids had to form In water than was not already toxic to Amino Acids, \nThey had to fuse even under Brownian Motion which pulls them apart from one \nanother faster than they can fuse, Especially in an ocean. You had to have \na spark, And only one spark because a second would destroy the sample, You \ncan't have Oxygen cause Oxygen Oxidizes materials and would destroy the \nAmino Acids, But you have to have Oxygen for Ozone or UV light would \ndestroy the Amino Acids. The Sparks creates a 98% toxic solution, Of which \nhalf the amino acids are right handed, Half are left handed, We are made of \nRight handed amino acids, Not a combination. These Amino Acids after doing \nthe impossible, An Impossible chance power that scientist say is 1 in 10 to \n144,000 power and 1 in 10 to 50 power is deemed impossible, They create DNA \nor RNA and then they magically find a Cell of unknown origins, which has at \nleast 4 organelles, Cells need many organelles to survive and enter \nMitosis. This magical cell somehow survived and then somehow formed into \nbasic  lifeforms like Trilobites even though Trilobites have the most \ncomplex eye known to man. Many Isopods still exist by the way. And then \nMacro Evolution which is nearly as insane as organic Evolution states that \nMutational Accumulation combined with Natural Selection will form new \nspecies. Macro Evolution is completely dependent on NON existent beneficial \nMutations, The only Mutation ive ever heard say might be beneficial is \nSickle Cell Anemia which makes you immune to malaria, But still kills you. \nThe vast majority of Mutations are negative or neutral, And many of these \nmutations are Genetically Inherited. It is estimated that a Cell forms one \nmutation every time it enters mitosis, And since sperm never stops entering \nMitosis until death, Sperm accumulates mutations algorithmically throughout \nthe males  Life, The older you are when you have kids if your male the more \nMutations you pass onto your young. It is Estimated that at least 100 new \nProbably negative Mutations are passed onto each new generation, Which will \nbe one of the more likely extinction events that humanity will face \neventually.\n\nMicro Evolution is the only real Evolution in science, We can test it, \nObserve it, Demonstrate it, Within ourselves and nature. It is a Non \nMutation reliant adaptation in your genetics, Swapping out main genes from \nyour other plethora of Nucleotides in your DNA. We have 3,000,000,000 Base \npairs in a DNA Double Helix, Or 6,000,000,000 nucleotides.\nThey say the change of one important nucleotide is enough to kill a \ndeveloping fetus/child. We adapt within the limit of our Genetics, This is \ntrue. But that is as far as it goes, We are not getting bigger and stronger \nand better, We are most likely getting smaller and weaker and more idiotic, \nRegardless of our technological prowess, Because of Negative Mutational \nAccumulation.\n\nEvolution and by Evolution I mean Cosmic, Chemical, Stellar, Organic and \nMacro Evolution are Hypothetical insanities.\n\n\nThis was a relatively short comment, Mind you there are thousands of books \nand thousands of scientist on both sides, But don't believe in Evolution \njust because mainstream journals advertise it, When you do the REAL \nresearch it becomes obvious, This information has been out and updated for \nyears and years and creation science is on the rise even if popularity is \nat an all time low, The majority of scientist believe in Evolution, One \nreason is that they be fired if they don't many have been, Many will be \nagain. Don't be deceived. You may think Believing in God is insane, When \nyou study our genetics, Our existence, What we are and how complex we \nreally are, IT isn't insane anymore.",

What research is involved in \nthat?\nI have faith in one thing: you will do ZERO research in understanding why \nevolution is proven fact.\n\nAs for whatever loopholes you might come up with for the contradictions in \nMatthew and Luke for whether Jesus rode one donkey or 2, or who was at \nJesus' tomb when he was (allegedly) found missing, or how Judas died (did \nhe hang himself or fall dead in a field?) (who owned the field 2 different \nstories of that) .... most of the Bible is not in duplicate as the Gospels \nare and most of the Bible does not offer much opportunity for contradiction.\n\nHaving drawn the conclusion that you don't believe in evolution, or \npresumably the Big Bang or a 4.54 billion year old earth, I suggest \nfamiliarizing yourself with the evidence. These topics are too broad for me \nto even begin to cover in this forum.\n\nIf I told you that Gone With The Wind had no contradictions, would you even \nassume it was a true story? What if it was written by multiple authors? \nWhat if I told you it was written by an invisible leprechaun? Multiple \nleprechauns? Does the fact that is agrees with itself enough to justify \nbelieving that Gone With The Wind was written by multiple leprechauns?\n\nEven though the Bible has contradictions, even if it didn't, the simple \nanswer lies in the familiarity the authors would have had with the other \ntexts,\nor in the case of the gospels (at least 3 of them), that they are simply \ndifferent variations of the same story that changed slightly over time as \nit was copied by hand.\n\nWhat evidence would you honestly need that Zeus was hurling lightning bolts \ndown from Mount Olympus? What evidence would you need that 2 people had \nbeen abducted by aliens? If their stories had almost identical details, if \nthey described the same aliens, would that be enough?\n\nYour lack of skepticism come from religious indoctrination.\nYou have one piece of evidence: a book that contains no information that \ncouldn't have come from the bronze age.",

It offers no insight that could not have come from the bronze age and \nit tells stories about unicorns, dragons, giants, people living hundreds of \nyears, sorcery, magic potions, talking animals, magic fruit, global \ndisasters that we know didn't happen and so much more ridiculous crap that \neven if it didn't contradict itself, it would not be sufficient evidence \nfor these things, and any intelligent god would know this.\nAdditionally, many of the authors would have had the works of the other \nauthors, especially Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy and \nJob, which any Hebrew those days, even an uneducated one, would have been \ntaught from birth.

In 1911 the Supreme Court declared \nStandard Oil a monopoly and broke it up.\n\nMost people that share your opinion are also a fan for small business, But \na end result of pure unmitigated business and capitalism is big \ncorporations that small businesses can't compete with. Like Walmart. It's \nbeen shown that when a Walmart starts in or near a small town. All small \nbusiness in the town fails or suffers.\n\nAnother way the government interferes with business is through the FDA. \nIt's been shown that when a business is focused with a 100% profit motive, \nthey sometimes cut back on quality. This was a serious problem with meat \nindustries in the 1900s producing meat that made people sick.\n\nYou would argue that in this situations consumers would quit buying meat \nsome this particular company, and it would have to adapt or fail. And you \nwould be right, in theory you can say that is, as it is logically sound.\n\nHowever it's commonsense that in practice takes precedent over in theory. \nAnd in practice, all the other large meat companies lowered their quality \nas well to compete with prices. So the FDA was born to institute \nregulations in the food industry to keep food fit for human consumption and \nto protect the consumer.\n\nOnly a fool, believes in pure unmitigated business with 0 government \ninterference. Pure capitalism works good on paper, just as communism and \nsocialism works on paper, But the problem is in practice both fail. \n\nIn communism it fails due to the human equation. It doesn't take into \naccount for corruption, and also people don't work without self benefit. In \npure communism a brain surgeon would make the same as a janitor, so why \nbother being a brain surgeon. It doesn't award ambition.\n\nPure capitalism fails also because of the human equation, when people work \nonly for self interest things like quality and safety become second \npriorities not to be worried about. Also it eventually produces giants \nstarting businesses can't compete with.\n\nThe simple truth is Capitalism and Communism exists as a gradient and the \ntrue working system is somewhere in-between the 2.",
