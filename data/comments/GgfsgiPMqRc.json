In Iranian schools, they taught in the history books, even as \nearly as the 1960s, that the US CIA was the one who put the Shah Pahlavi in \ncharge, the guy who would indiscrimantly arrest, torture, and kill anyone \nwho he thought was opposed to him. Every Iranian person knew it, and that's \nwhy they hated America in the 70's and took the hostages, and in 1980 setup \nan Islamic republic to counter the perceived (and real) fascist Christian \ndominated western world that, and why they have the new fascist Islamic \ngovernment even today. But the US government just keeps on doing it again, \nand again, and again, and our government is doing it right this very minute \nas your read these words, in Egypt, Lybia, and Syria, and several other \ncountry we haven't heard of yet.",
