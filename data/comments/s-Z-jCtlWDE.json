I have no eyes \nand blood all over my face. I am dead. If you don't send this to at least \n12 people I will come to your house at midnight and I'll hide under your \nbed. When you're asleep, I'll kill you. Don't believe me? Case 1: Patty \nBuckles Got this e-mail. She doesn't believe in chain letters. Well, \nFoolish Patty. She was sleeping when her TV started flickering on and off. \nNow she's not with us anymore. Ha ha patty, Ha ha! You don't want to be \nlike Patty, do you? Case 2: George M. Simon Hates chain mail, but he didn't \nwant to die that night. He sent it to 4 people. Not good enough George. \nNow, George is in a coma, we don't know if he'll ever wake up. Ha ha \nGeorge, Ha ha! Now, do you want to be like George? Case 3: Valarie Tyler \nShe got this letter. Another chain letter she thought. Only had 7 people to \nsend to. Well, That night when she was having a shower she saw bloody Mary \nin the mirror. It was the BIGGEST fright of her life. Valarie is scarred \nfor life. Case 4: Derek Minse This is the final case I'll tell you about. \nWell, Derek was a smart person. He sent it to 12 people. Later that day, he \nfound a $100.00 bill on the ground. He was premoted to head officer at his \njob and his girlfriend said yes to his purposal. Now, Katie and him are \nliving happily ever after.\u200bThey have 2 beautiful children. Send this to at \nleast 12 people or you'll face the consequences. 0 people- You will die \ntonight 1-6 people- you will be injured 7-11 people- you will get the \nbiggest fright of your life 12 and over- you are safe and will have good \nfortune! Do What Teddy Says!!!! Hurry, you must send to 12 people before \nmidnight no send backs \n\n\nSorry I had to send this to enough people cuz I got scared lol\ufeff",
