That was the best part of \nthe song.\nSunmi does slut it up pretty well though. I guess thats how she got the \nlabel to support her.

I'm talking about \"A\" and you \ngo on and on about \"B.\" Maybe it's just a woman thing to do that.\n\nMaybe you don't understand the comparisons because you are so passionate \nabout K pop, and you don't want people criticising it, which is fine.\n\nI don't know if you were trying to be funny but writing the link down was \nkind of lame.\n\nEvery one is entitled to their own opinion for sure, but there is a \ndifference between\n\n\" I don't get it\" and \" I refuse to get it\"",

I mean \nhow can you not?\n\nAuthenticity and originality is what is required in \"good music\" don't you \nthink. When there are constant replica's or the recycling of concepts and \nideas in any form of art, I can't help but notice.\n\nI personally don't know why a lot of K pop mainstreams imitate quite a lot \nof American mainstreams.

Those are indirect judgments on her \nregardless of whether or not you choose to admit so because the underlying \njudgments are that she dances like a prostitute and that she'd never live \nup to other bands. \nAight, foreals though. That choreography had so many great visual, \nnon-sexual parts to it and you choose to focus on that 11 seconds segment \nto bash on the entire dance.
