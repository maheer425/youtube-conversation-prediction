The hot \ntopic is homosexuality, while Leviticus (I apologies if thats spelt wrong) \nstates that is a sin, he also goes on to say that mixing fabrics is a sin \nworthy of hell. Not that everyone listens to that part.\n\nThose that have heard it have often said its not treally important. If \nthats so then why is homosexuality any more or less important? If the \nmajority of christians (just swap the relevant topics for any other \nreligion you may think of as well) choose which part of the bible they \nthink is right and which parts are'nt then thats not faith, thats using \nreligion as an excuse to force their opinion on others.\n\n Also, many of the christians who both study christianity AND the history \nof the catholic church realise that the bible itself is far from accurate \nto their religion. Its a proven fact that Constantine (the emperor from 4th \ncentury A.D) created the church and with the help of a \ncouncil selected certain books written about Jesus (who was until then \nconsidered the mortal prophet of god) that put him in a divine light. Next \ncame the propaganda against the pagan religions by shaming sex, using pagan \nsymbols in demonic descriptions and shaming sex and women. If you want me \nto further explain the latter part of this comment just reply with your \nquestion(s). Be aware that I tend to ramble and go off topic. ",

                    "text": "And a lot of Atheists have converted to Religion because of certain events \nin their lives. Vladimir Putin, Francis Collins, Gabrielle Carey etc.\n\nAntony Flew was one of the most respected Atheists of the 20TH century and \nhe became a Deist. \n\nTrue, a lot of people are not experts in Religion (Unless it's their job, \nPriests, Military Chaplin, Historians, Theologists etc), but many Religious \npeople know a lot about their respective Religion. Where do you get the \nidea that Atheists know more? I have yet to even meet an Atheist who knows \nanything about Christianity.\n\nThese Atheists who read the Bible than become Atheists are ignorant. Again, \nit takes years of dedication, study and devotion to even be able to \ncomprehend the Religion. Years of study in not just the scriptures but the \nhistory it was written and many other areas of knowledge. Just because an \nAtheist reads the Bible a few times doesn't mean he has the ability nor the \nright to comment on Religion in any way.\n\nOne example is 1 Samuel 15:3 \"Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy \nall that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant \nand suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\u2019\u201d\n\nMost Atheists say this is proof that the Bible is evil. Of course since \nmost Atheists have very little education in Theology they miss the very \nbasics.\n\nThe Amalekites were a war like tribe that murdered, killed, raped and \nassaulted the Hebrews as they journeyed from their Exodus in Egypt. The war \nwith the Amalekites was a war of defense for the Hebrews. \n\nThere was no UN back then, no Geneva Convention and no form of 3RD party \nprotection. Back then you either fought or you died. The Amalekites drew \nfirst blood. They attacked the Hebrews in more ways than one.\n\nDeuteronomy 25: \"17 \u201cRemember what Amalek did to you on the way as you came \nout of Egypt, 18 how he attacked you on the way when you were faint and \nweary, and cut off your tail, those who were lagging behind you, and he did \nnot fear God. 19 Therefore when the Lord your God has given you rest from \nall your enemies around you, in the land that the Lord your God is giving \nyou for an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek \nfrom under heaven; you shall not forget.\"\n\nBy todays standards this war was justifiable and necessary. Remember, there \nwas no UN, no Geneva Convention, no NAT, no nothing. The Hebrews back then \nwere also nomadic so what should they have done?\n\nIf they leave survivors they will continue to be harassed, if they do \nnothing they would have been wiped out. \n\nThis is one example where Atheists always use this as justification for \nbelieving the Bible is evil but have never done any research out of reading \na few lines of scripture. They don't know the war like society that \nthe Amalekites were like, they don't know how the Hebrews were forced into \nconflict, they don't know the result of leaving survivors (Resulting in the \ncontinued assault and murder of the Hebrews) etc. Atheists know nothing of \nthe Bible yet they claim to be experts in it.\n\nTheology is more than just the study of Religious texts. You must study the \ntime periods, the societies, the people etc.\n\nIf an Atheist is an Atheist just because he thinks that's the best course \nfor him then that's fine. I have no problem with that at all. But if he is \nan Atheist simply out of hatred for a book he knows little about (And has \nanything less than 4 years of biblical studies) and insults a Religion he \nknows nothing about than I have a problem.

They found \nthat in the social sciences 42.5% believed God existed, and 16% believed in \na higher power.\n\nIn the same study, out of the natural sciences 43.9% believed God existed, \nand 3.7% believed in a higher power.\n\nFarr Curlin, a University of Chicago Instructor in Medicine and a member of \nthe MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics, noted in a study that \ndoctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a \nstudy that found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent \nbelieve in some sort of afterlife and 90 percent of doctors in the United \nStates attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to 81 \npercent of all adults.\n\nMany great minds have been Religious as well. Gregory Mendel, the father of \ngenetics was a Friar (Basically a low rank of monk). \n\nMonseigneur Georges Henri Joseph \u00c9douard Lema\u00eetre, a Bulgarian priest was \nthe founder of the Big Bang Theory (So as he proposed his theory, he taught \nthe Bible as fact. He received a lot of criticism from the scientific \ncommunity because of his beliefs but who's laughing now? The Big Bang \ntheory is the accepted theory of the formation of the Universe).\n\nFrancis Collins, the current head of the National Institute of Health and \nthe founder of the Human Genome project is a devout Christian. He was an \nAtheist as a young adult but converted to Christianity because of his \nmedical research.\n\nMy point is this, you say Religion is Bullcrap but that is simply your \nopinion. Roughly 1/3RD to 1/2 half of the scientific community would \ndisagree with you and had it not been for Religion modern science would not \nbe where it is today.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, look up this article released by PEW \nResearch Center...\n\n\"Religion and Science: a Timeline\" (NOV 5TH 2009) and... \"Religion and \nScience in the US\" (NOV 5TH 2009).\n\nModern Science as a practice was founded by Thomas Aquinas, an Italian Monk \nwho combined Greek Philosophy and Christianity Theology to create the \nmodern practice of science. That's why nearly every scientific word and \nname is related to Latin, Greek and Roman Mythology and attributed with \nChristian Theology. \n\nFurthermore, Religious devout Muslim Thinkers and Scientists help set the \nstage for the Scientific Revolution in Europe in the 17TH and 18TH century. \nIt was known as the \"Golden Age of Scientific Experimentation and Inquiry\" \nin 8TH century. Because of this period in time, Muslim schools and \nuniversities set the stage for the modern practice and advancements of \nscience in the Islamic world. \n\nSo you say Religion is Bullcrap, that's your opinion. However history shows \nthat it was vital in the formation of modern science and sparked many \nadvancements in sciences. Again don't take my word for it, look up the \ninformation I gave you and come to your own conclusion. ",

                    "text": "While the primary purpose of the Bible is to make us wise unto salvation \nwhich is in Jesus Christ, it also provides the basis for a truly civilised \nsociety which really works. One of the blessings which is enjoyed in a \nsociety in which Christianity is a strong and meaningful leaven is a \nsociety based on the principles laid down for us by the One Who made us. \nOnly He can know how we were made to operate, and therefore what will work \nwell for us.\n\nRead PSALM 11:3. What happens if you destroy the foundations of any \nstructure? What specific things would you expect to see if the foundations \nof society were being destroyed? How do we see evidences of this in the \nWest and in our country?\n\nLet's now examine some of those most basic foundations and see what they \nare.\n\nMarriage\nWhile society is based on the family, the family itself has an even more \nbasic foundation - marriage. While the parent-child relationship is \ndesigned as a temporary relationship, the marriage relationship is even \nmore basic and is designed to be permanent once it is begun. Read GENESIS \n2:18-24. Why did God make a helper for Adam? Under normal circumstances is \nit reasonable to suggest that man cannot be truly happy without a helpmeet, \nbut women can? Does the account of the creation of woman mention \nchildbearing as one of the primary purposes of the woman, or even of the \nmarriage relationship?\n\nRead MATTHEW 19:3-9. Did Moses freely allow divorce? Why did he grant the \nJews the right of divorce? Did this increase the strength of their society \nor their own personal happiness? What words does Jesus use to say, \"It was \nnot designed to work this way\"?\n\nWe could continue to find the origin and purposes of the man being the head \nof the family, the basis of the church and government as well as morality \nin Genesis, but we have already made the case that Genesis provides the \nfoundations of civilisation. If you would like, you might search the first \nthree chapters of Genesis for the origins of these institutions as well.\n\nClose this Bible study with a prayerful reading of PSALM 119:1-16.\n\nAbout Homosexuality\nGENESIS 2:18-24 also provides helpful teaching on the subject of \nhomosexuality. How does this text make clear that homosexual relationships \nare not part of God's design for the family? Did Adam find a companion \nsuitable for himself among the animals? Did God make him another man for a \ncompanion? How does this tell us that a person of the same sex is not a \nsuitable companion in fulfilling the needs we were created to have? Now \ntake a look at ROMANS 1:18-28. Verse 18 tells us what the initial sin is, \nthe verses which follow tell us the resulting punishments because of this \nsin, and the stubbornness of remaining in the sin. What is the initial sin? \nWhat is the result of remaining in this sin? Note what the basis or \nfoundation of the sin is in verse 25. How does evolution fit into verse 25? \nCan we say then, that evolution provides a good basis for the undermining \nof the marriage relationship and the promotion of homosexuality? How have \nwe seen this being played out today?\n\nWhy Wear Clothes?\nAnother basis upon which society rests is clothing. Why do we wear clothes? \nWhile much of society answers that the reason for clothes is to keep warm \nor for decoration, some people still have a semblance of the real reason \nfor clothing in the largely outdated word \"modesty\". The word \"modesty\" \ndoesn't actually capture the full reason for clothing, however. For that we \nmust return to GENESIS.\n\nRead GENESIS 2:25 through 3:7. What is the difference in Adam and Eve's \nthinking in GENESIS 1:25 as compared with 3:7? What was the reason for that \ndifference in thinking? Was this an improvement in Adam and Eve's thinking \nability (look at their logic in 3:8)? Sin perverts everything, even \nnakedness. What solution did Adam and Eve try once sin had perverted it?\n\nRead GENESIS 3:21. Was the solution that Adam and Eve came up with for this \nproblem sufficient? The strong suggestion in verse 8 is that their solution \nwas insufficient from both a spiritual as well as a material point of view \n(compare the clothing value of leaves as compared with skins). How was \ntheir solution insufficient spiritually? How might their solution have been \ninsufficient materially?\n\nWhere did God get the skins to clothe them? Does this suggest the origin of \nthe idea that there must be sacrifice and death for sin? What did God's act \nof providing clothes for Adam and Eve prefigure? How do GENESIS 3:21 and \n3:15 tie together?\n\nWe can conclude then, that the material purpose of our wearing clothing is \nto help others and ourselves from becoming tempted by the sins which result \nfrom sin's perversion of nakedness. What guideline does this fact provide \nus with concerning standards of clothing? Is there a connection between the \nway people dress today and the increasing sexual immorality?\n\nSource: \u2018Bible-Science Newsletter'",
