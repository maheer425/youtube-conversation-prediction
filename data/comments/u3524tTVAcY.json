Fox had a rare opportunity to take apart this fool and they \ncompletely blew it.\n\nDuring the interview Aslan grossly misled the audience with his credentials \nas a \"scholar of religions\". His 2009 PhD is in sociology (it was awarded \non the basis of a 140-page dissertation on contemporary Muslim political \nactivism). Only his BA is in Theology. Aslan is currently employed as an \nassociate professor of creative writing.\n\nHe is most qualified at writing fiction. That is his specialty.\n\nIs Aslan qualified to right a book on Jesus. Of course. However 'Zealot' is \nat best a perfunctory analysis of the subject. It is filled with \n'probablies' and 'likelies' and completely devoid of any innovative \n'historical' or 'scholarly' insight or revelation. It is a parochial, \namateurish attempt and should be placed next to 'Chariot of the Gods' on \nthe bookshelf.\n\nLauren Hill's poor interview almost certainly increased book sales and was \na brilliant move on Aslan's part. Anti-Jesus liberals shifting the argument \nfrom 'should I purchase this shoddy book?' to 'Fox hates it so it must be \ngood?'\n\nThe public would have been better served if Professor Aslan had been booked \nby another equally unqualified (and far more successful) 'Jesus' author, \nBill O'Reilly.\n\nO'Reilly would have gutted him like a fish.\n\nMerry Christmas all ;)\ufeff",

As for \nsame-sex marriages, if progress is left unabated, expect polygamist \nmarriages to be lawful in short order. The last two SCOTUS rulings left it \nup to the states to decide what marriage is. A federal judge just shot down \na good chunk of Utah's anti-polygamy law. It'll only be a matter of time \nbefore polygamy is not only lawful in Utah, but will have be supported by \nour federal statues in the same way same-sex marriage is today.\n\nSo why do I give a crap? Despite the fact marriage has become a joke in \nthis country it is a societal stabilizer. The normalization of same-sex \nmarriage creates both a slippery slope (the inevitable normalization of \npolygamist, polyandrous, polyamorous, and incestuous marriage) and \nunintended consequences (federal payouts to spouses, military service, \nforcing Church's to support - just as Massachusetts forced the Catholic \nChurch to allow adoption for same-sex couples, etc., etc., etc.).\n\nOff topic to be sure, but I feel its all part and parcel of the same battle \nwaged by the leftists to destabilize what we know as the United States of \nAmerica. Aslan is but a captain in the 5th column, but his motives are \nclear.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq was brilliant. It was exactly what bin Laden didn't \nexpect. He'd hope to draw us into another Afghan fiasco. He didn't expect \nus to create a honey pot where we could draw Jihadists in to slaughter them \nby the tens of thousands. Its a shame we didn't stick it out. If Truman and \nGeorge Marshall had the vision of Obama Germany would have long ago been \nlost to the Soviets. Oh, well. I have to concede victory to the leftists \nthis time. America's resolve just isn't what it was 70 years ago.",

The biggest scientific discovering \nwe had are already written in the Quran. Even the big bang theory is there. \nThe EXACT shape of the Earth, the movement of the Sun at it's FIXED place. \nI mean don't you see how the sun moves at where it is places when you see a \nvideo, it doesn't move from it position, but it moves at it's fixed place. \nWhich haters kind of uses to tell people it's saying sun moves around the \nEarth which isn't true.\n\nThen now days I see people, mostly Atheists saying that fighting and \nwarring happens because of religion and such. Where that too is wrong if \nyou actually knew the religion or at least Islam for that matters. If you \nactually were to go very deep into the story or go way back into the \nhistory. I mean Islam is the one that teaches to accept people being \ndifferent and learn from people being different. I mean most Atheist argues \nabout religion and the materials they uses to argue about it. It kind of \ndoesn't work out at all if you were to use those materials to argue with \nIslam. I mean it would be like using Islam to argue Islam. If you were to \nuse science to argue with Islam, it's exactly like saying using Islam to \nargue Islam. It's like saying apple is red, so I disagree with apple being \nred.\n\nNo it's not really surprising, it would be to me surprising if he were to \nbe an Atheist.",

Which makes \nthe discussion go nowhere. Lets make a \"christian\" write about Mohamed, and \nsee what happens. Also Jesus Christ, was a Muslim? Their religion was made \n700 years AFTER the bible was completed. The way Jesus did things and how \nMohammed did things were ways different. Jesus taught us to 'make peace \nwith all sorts of men' \"love those hating us\" (You can also see great \nhypocrisy on many so called Christians and the Roman Catholic who led \nChristianity into darkness). True Christians are taught, from the BIBLE. \nThey do not attack anyone but ignore them, and preach. The BIBLE is the \nanswer, of which people (many so called Christians) seek to corrupt. Jesus, \nis not God, for he is the son of God. Its written that '----the head of the \ncongregation is the Christ, AND the head of the Christ is the Father'. 'We \nhave ONE god (Jehovah), ONE lord (Jesus), ONE mediator (Jesus), ONE faith \n(true Christianity like the first century one, before the roman catholic).' \nTrue Christians worship one god the same god of Abraham, and are not \nsupposed to support wars of any sort, do not use carved images even the \ncross. Why, and how can the devil try to tempt God, of all people. I swear \npeople need more bible studies these days.\ufeff",

The holy spirit meaning something with no \nbeginning and no end. Something that is not created. Something if God. The \nholy spirit left Jesus while he was on the cross and it was shocking. He \nhad to go to the cross as the lamb. He cried out Eli, Eli lema Sabachthani \nand God turned his back. Well, it will take some time to assimilate all of \nmy beliefs.

Your God, \nAlla, is a Female Deity, it is the Moon Goddess, many of you still don't \nknow this.. and that Rock Muslims worship (Kaaba Stone) has a huge Metal \nVagina in it that you muslims ritualistically Bow to and Stick your heads \nin and Kiss. And, it was a woman who's name was Kadijah who Funded the \ncreation of the religion of Islam.. Say what you Want, I brink FACTS not \nEmotion to the Table, and this is why Muslims are very very effeminate, \nreact, and respond like women, they have a feminine  Spirit, because their \nGod is a feminine  Deity. Men are not suppose to scream, and act indignant \nand overly emotional over silly things, or because they feel insulted, \nwomen mostly behave like this, and like i said, I have many many Muslim \nfriends, I'm not saying they're gay, But they act and operate in a way, \nOnly women behave in.",

To be a Jew you MUST be Born a Jew, because a \nJew is a Child or Descendant of Judah, the 4th son of Jacob/Israel.. For \nInstance. Let's say my name is James Thomas. And Me and my Children have \ncertain Laws we Follow, No one can start following these Laws then claim to \nBe converted into My Bloodline and call it Thomasism. You can Never convert \ninto a Bloodline no what what you do, This is what Today's Fake Jews have \ndone.. Created A religion called Judaism and are calling themselves \njew-ISH, and ignorant people fall for it without understanding what's right \nin their faces, that \"ISH\" means, Kind of, Of, Sort of, But Not really, so, \nthe Term JewISH means.. I\"m kind of, or sort of a Jew, But i'm not really \nthe Real Jews.. Also, There Are 12 tribes, Jews is Only 1 of the 12 tribes. \nand, Judaism was Only created in the 9th centruy.. which make it THE newest \nReligion.\n\nAs far as Christianity. as i have said, Yes Christianity is a Man made \nReligion. Created byt the Catholic Church, Islam had Nothing to do With the \ncreation of Christianity because Christianity was created in about 321 AD \nLong before Islam was Created. NOW. Islam was Created in around 630 AD \nHundreds of years AFTER Christianity was Created. And i can Assure you \nthis. Here is another Fact that will Break the Back of Islam. It was the \nCatholic Church who Help Establish Islam.It was the Catholic Church who \ngave Mohammed refuge from the REAL Black Jews,( not today's Jew-ISH People) \nAfter Mohammed's Mother and father died.It was Khadijah who Gave her wealth \nto the Catholic Church to help finance this Creation of an Arab Religion, \nand it was She who had Found Mohammed to be the Perfect Messenger for this \nnew religion. Islam Is nothin less than the Roman Catholic Church's Rule \nand Control in the Middle East.  Now go do your research, check out these \nfacts and i challenge you to Prove me wrong.",
