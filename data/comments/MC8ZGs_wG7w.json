All the blind people I know (only a few) say that iPhone is the \nmost accessible phone out there. The problem is not the phone, (though \nthere's room for improvement) but the apps and websites that are not \naccessible. Now, I've no knowledge of what the app Alex Smith is \nmentioning, but considering it is for visually-impaired people, it would be \naccessible. What's nice is that there are apps that aren't specially meant \nto cater to blind people, but are accessible nonetheless. An example is the \nsong finding app \"Shazam\" vs \"Soundhound\". I use Soundhound because I was \nintroduced to it by my brother, but one of my blind friend uses Shazam. I \nasked why she doesn't use Soundhound and she says that Shazam is more \naccessible.",
