                    "text": "Personally, I think all you guys are reading way too much into things. I \ncan understand that you might find things more offensive in these sketches \nthan others might. But many of the specific examples you've given I found \nto lack substance. For example, the throwing down brides comment, and \nfurther comments that Studio C is showing its support of quote-on-quote \n\"collecting woman\" I believe is nor substantiated in these sketches. If \nanything at all, they're making fun of the fact that other people do use \nthose things for entertainment (almost like they're taking a more satirical \napproach to their sketches). And, in the Taken 3 sketch where the bride was \nthrown down, she was one of many subjects that was stopped from \"taking\" \nanything--she was not at all singled out. Had the groom been thrown down, \nwould the joke still be found offensive?\n\nI do understand partially where you're coming from. In the taking bets \nsketch, I was a little wary, however they made the overall comment that in \ngambling no-one really wins, or it's highly unlikely you'd win and a \nwasteful use of time and energy. So, again, I saw more of a satirical \nsketch that effectively spoke against the action of taking bets and \ngambling. I can also see how someone might be offended by the Scott \nSterling sketch because of the blood, but it wasn't intended to be \ninherently gruesome or overly violent, as are many forms of entertainment \nthese days.\n\nAnd as to the comments speaking against the inclusion of Spanish Matt \nCenter, I must say I disagree entirely. Studio C was not including it to be \noffensive in any way, they included no stereotypes. All they did was have a \nguy speak in Spanish--saying essentially the same things that the English \nnewscaster said.\n\nI believe I understand at least somewhat of where you and others are coming \nfrom, and I respect your opinion and theirs, but I hope this may have \nhelped you to see why many people who have high morals like unto yourself \nare not offended by the new and upcoming Studio C episodes. \n\nThank You!",
