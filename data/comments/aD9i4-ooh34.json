He is bought and paid for by banks and \ncorporations no different than McCain or Hillary or Bush or Romney or \nanyone that runs as a Democrat or Republican in 2016. HE support \nunnecessary military action, HE supported changing the definition of \"enemy \ncombatant\" to include \"any male of fighting age\" to make our performance \nwith drones look better on paper. HE has appointed officials and supported \naction that will give the government and corporations control of the \ninternet. HE went back on his word and criminalizes whistle blowers. We \nprobably agree that Romney would have been worse, and I also think Hillary \nwould have been worse, but Obama is not a good president and if you think \nhis ideas were \"perfect\" as if he's a fucking deity, then you can't even be \ntaken seriously. We need someone WILDLY different than anything Democrats \nand Republicans have offered in decades. I would consider voting democrat \nif Elizabeth Warren runs (she's too good for that party however) but would \nlove to see Bernie Sanders run most of all. Tragically, because of Citizens \nUnited and the corporate media, all the shit-for-brains lemmings in the \ncountry will just do what their TV tells them and vote for whichever \nDemocrat or Republican has the most corporate sponsors and won't change \nanything because the banks and corporations are in hog heaven with how the \ncountry has been run for the last 35 years.",
