If the child were just crying because their toy broke; great, buy \nthem a new one, problem solved. But, if the child were crying because their \npet dog died, buying them a new dog wouldn't suffice to fill their \nsentimental void - sometimes they just need someone with an Empathetic \ntemperament to comfort them, cry with them, and 'feel the feels' with them. \nIt goes without saying that Empathetic and Logical temperaments both come \nwith strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWriters, artists and musicians exist to explore and provoke our emotions, \nand a great portion of them explore the beauty of melancholy; \nsad music, sad art, sad poems all exist for a reason.\nEdgar Allan Poe's poem, 'The Raven' was crafted with the mood of melancholy \nwell in mind.\n\u201cBeauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem\u201d in general, and \u201cThe \nRaven\u201d in particular, \u201cMelancholy is thus the most legitimate of all \npoetical tones.\u201d - Edgar Allan Poe.\nTo denounce the worthiness of melancholy is to denounce a great portion of \nthe art world.\nThe very existence of art seems to clash with logic and productivity - a \nwriter sitting around writing melancholic poems doesn't seem a rational \nthing to do, but it carries great purpose.  \nWe need the irrationality of emotion, even at times, if it compromises \nproductivity, because emotion is greatly linked with the purpose of our \nexistence, and life aint all about productivity.\nReplace the humans on earth with highly productive yet emotionless robots; \nwatch them advance greatly in technology - but to what end?\nIf they can't feel, then what's the point?\n  \nIf you're blind to the beauty of melancholy in art, then it would tell me a \nlot about you; that you lack a certain capacity for emotional depth. I \ndon't intend to come off as elitist, but from my history of greatly \nadmiring the beauty of sadness and knowing a great many other individuals \nwhom perceive this beauty too - I can't help but sense a disparity.   \n\n(Btw are you familiar with MBTI?
