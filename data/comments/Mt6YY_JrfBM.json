Your \nold fallout lore video from earlier this year, before you started these \nones was the reason I bought Fallout 3.

When talking about \ncertain things, some people equate the dark to being scary, bad, or evil, \nbut I never could understand it.  =o\nThis is just a philosophical thought, but if in the very beginning of \neverything, there was only darkness, and God has always been and always, \nwill be, and is supposedly everywhere, just like darkness, does that make \nGod the darkness itself?  Or maybe the darkness that is forever and all \neternal is the power of God and that some being or beings harnessed the to \ncreate the universe. Darkness is everywhere, has been around ever since the \nbeginning of everything, does not die or go away, and is even inside of us \n(I imagine it gets pretty dark inside of our bodies.  I don't think we have \nlight bulbs inside of us).  It shares many qualities of the being or beings \npeople refer to as God.  I would say that God would be a pretty dark, and \nthat is nothing negative. But whether darkness is a God or not, there is no \nneed to be afraid of it.  It's like light, except, unlike light, it will \nnot die and leave you.  I don't see how their could be a light God if light \nis born, created, grows, weakens, fades, and dies. And when we die, we will \nreturn to the darkness, like they say God's children returns to him when we \ndie.  Even in this video, they say that the Dark God's goal was unity.   =D\ufeff",
