Even if I don't agree with it, I \ncan respect that you thought about it and came to a logical decision \ninstead of just spewing bad language for no reason.",

                    "text": "\"I'm just an aggressive person.\"  I could agree with this, but your final \nparagraph comes off more as \"pompous ass\" than anything else.\n\nFirst of all, there's a difference between shouting loudly (such as all \ncaps, bolding text, or other things to make your text stand out) and \nshouting vulgarly (as you did).  Impassioned speech =/= aggressive speech; \nvolume =/= content, so don't try to make them into the same thing.\n\nLet me put the marketing thing in a different perspective.  If, as a \nmarketer, you determine that people who like a certain show or pool of \nshows seem to also like another show or pool of shows, can you not then \nalso deduce that they would be likely to like yet another show or pool of \nshows?  Even if you're not snagging a majority percentage, you can grab a \nsubstantial number of people.  For example, I know of a lot of people who \nlike MLP and Regular Show.  Typically, the people I know or have \nencountered who like these shows also like Adventure Time.  From this, I \ncould make an educated guess that they'd like Bravest Warriors and that, \nback in the day, they'd probably have enjoyed shows like Animaniacs or Ren \n& Stimpy.  So, I'd feel comfortable marketing certain kinds of shows by \nsaying \"Fans of [one or more of these shows], check this out!\".  Yeah, it's \nnot going to be everyone's cup of tea, but that doesn't mean that the \nintent behind the campaign was intentionally misleading.  Besides, if it \ncatches a good number of viewers' attention (and potentially loyalty), then \nit's a marketing success regardless.  What convinced Cartoon Hangover that \nDoctor Lollipop would appeal to a fair portion of bronies (perhaps the \nirony of an overly hammy, girly-looking unicorn doctor, if they're going \nfor the watches-the-show-ironically bronies?) is certainly something that \ncould be debated, but I guess I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt \nrather than pouncing on them right away.\n\nKeep in mind that this is exactly how advertising works on the Internet in \ngeneral.  Based on Internet activity and browsing patterns, websites and \ncompanies try to tailor ads to you by showing you what they think you're \ninterested in.  Sometimes, they are horrendously off for one reason or \nanother, but they're always following their algorithms.  Unless you just \nwant to say that all modern targeted marketing is crap and to swear off \npretty much every company you've seen a side or banner ad for ever, what \nyou're saying here just comes across as overreactive, and I guess that's \nwhat I'm trying to say in the end.",

                    "text": "+AJ Earthbend First off, my response was not \"Everybody else does it\" but \nrather \"You have to be aggressive to get a point across on the internet, \nespecially on youtube\". You wouldn't whisper a group conversation in a busy \nNew York subway station, would you? No, because the trains are noisy and \neveryone else is talking loudly, so to effectively converse with a group \nyou must raise your voice. You don't raise your voice just because \n\"everyone else is doing it\", but rather because you have to raise your \nvoice or you will be drowned out by all the other people who are doing it \nbecause of all the people around them who are doing it. All this is beside \nthe point anyway, because nowhere in my response did I even allude to being \naggressive because it's what everyone else is doing, in all honestly, its \nbecause I'm just an aggressive person.\n\nNow, I wouldn't call deceiving your customers (and yes, we are customers, \nwe pay with our time) to get more money as intelligent marketing. Would you \nsay it's good marketing to advertise Vegemite as if it tasted like beer \nbecause it is made from leftover brewer's yeast? Of course not, because it \ndoesn't taste like beer at all, and assuming that people will like it just \nbecause an ingredient is shared would be stupid. Hell, if anything it's bad \nmarketing, because people like me who get upset when someone tries to trick \nthem will stop supporting said company's products, I've added a filter in \nadblock that blocks the ads from channels that I don't want to support \nbecause of their business practices, and it just so happens that I had to \nadd Cartoon Hangover to that list, so I wont be even be seeing them pop up \nin search result ads.\n\nKnow what you're talking about and who you are fucking with before you \nspout bullshit.

                    "text": "+Nosaman\nBasically what I got from your comment is \"It is ok to lie to people as \nlong as you are getting money to live on.\"\n...I really hope that isn't what you meant, because if so you are no better \nthan the head of an investment bank who decides that he needs some more \nmoney and lies to screw everyone out of their hard earned cash. You might \nsay \"oh he had too much money in the first place, hes rich!\" but my counter \nto that would be that he really is getting money to live on, its just that \nhis lifestyle is vastly more extravagant than the average Joe. So, do you \nreally think that deceiving people is ok as long as it pays the bills, and \nthat all the homeless people who cheat/lie/steal are completely justified \nsimply for the fact that they are homeless and hungry?\n\n\"Also, from an outside point of view a show about a talking candy colored \nunicorn would seem to appeal to a fan base that watches a show about \ntalking candy colored ponies.\" You insult my intelligence if you think this \nill contrived jumble of backwards logic would be taken seriously. Lets take \ntwo movies about talking penguins, for example, the movie \"Happy Feet\", and \nthe movie \"Surf's Up\". Happy Feet was a funny, fairly well written, and \nentertaining movie that had pretty good pacing, while Surf's Up was a movie \nthat had large amounts of forced, unfunny humor, had awful writing, was \npaced awkwardly, and got jarringly interrupted at multiple times throughout \nthe movie because the writers for some reason decided that they should put \nlittle news-style interviews with the characters scattered throughout the \nmovie like it was a reality TV show. Now, lets say you saw Happy Feet and \nabsolutely loved the movie, and you joined a fan club for the movie because \nyou loved it so much. You're a fan of Happy Feet now, lets just say that an \nindividual fan is a self proclaimed \"Happy Foot\", and you stumble upon an \nad for Surf's Up that claims to be \"Happy F\u00e9\u00e9t 2\", or has an advertisement \nthat says \"Any Happy Foot should see this movie!\", and you decide to go see \nthe movie. Now, before I continue, I realize that this situation could \nnever happen due to copyright laws, but this is a hypothetical situation in \nwhich the only thing you pay to see the movie is your time watching the ads \nbefore said movie. You are ecstatic, you devour fan works/parodies/official \ncontent with fervor, and you think that this new movie is related to your \nbeloved Happy Feet and so you go to see the movie, sitting through the 13 \nminutes worth of advertising (this video having a 30 second ad which is \nabout 1/12 the length of this 6 minute video, so I made the advertising \nproportional to the 83 minute running time of Surf's Up) and realize that \nthe only relation this movie has to Happy Feet is the talking 3D animated \npenguins. The bad writing of Surf's Up aside, you are angry because the \nmovie made out that it was related to Happy Feet, but you are furious \nbecause the producers of the movie deceived and took advantage of you for a \nquick buck.\n\nDo you see the point I'm trying to make? Also, never start out an argument \nwith \"from an outside point of view\" as there is no such thing and it only \nmakes you look arrogant and stupid by assuming that you are the only one \nwith a level head even if you are neither arrogant nor stupid, not saying \nthat you are, but it just makes you look that way.",

Honestly, I \nwould say that people being able to show their nitty-gritty on the internet \nis a good thing, the only reason I say this is that it gives a good release \nand can do a very good job of keeping people from \"blowing up\" in the real \nworld, kind of like a big stress ball that, instead of being squeezed for a \nphysical comfort, is more like a mental object that your psyche can \n\"squeeze\". So yeah, the internet is a series of tubes *and* a metaphysical \nstress ball that can help people cool their jets if they know how to use \nit. One exclusion I would make is social networking sites like Facebook, a \nlot of studies show that the more time spent on social networking sites, \nthe lower your self esteem and the more jealous of those you know you \nbecome. The most likely cause of the social networking problem that I can \nthink of is that while the internet can be a great mental venting tool, \nwhat you see and do on facebook directly relates to the real world, but a \nlot of people still use it like they have total anonymity, which results in \nthe shift of the hidden dangerous human nature from the background to the \nforeground. Social networking is a great tool if you can keep the mindset \nthat it is a direct extension of reality. Anyway, enough rabbit trailing \nfor now. Oh, and thanks for the compliment.",

Your comment lacks originality and proper punctuation. Anyone can shout \n\"go away and fu#3 off\". But it's only making you look stupid. You're the \ntroll and it is imperative that you create the illusion that are an \nintellectual with a grudge. A better insult would have been\n\"Sir! I wholeheartedly disagree with you. Your opinion is worthless. Please \nvacate immediately\". Notice how i used correct punctuation and big words?\n\n2. Change your icon. Roblox is the worst game since ET and you're only \nmaking yourself look stupid. Change it to something  made of pure evil \nlike a goblin or a cat. An intimidating icon will further the illusion of \nsophistication.\n\n3. Your name. Again it's stupid and leads me to believe that you are stupid \ntoo. Much like your comment and your icon it lacks creativity. When \nselecting a troll name. Never use Numbers or symbols where they are not \nneeded and never use your real name. PIck something intelligent or \nintimidating. Remember your trying to look smart not stupid.\nAn adequate name for you would be:\nInutile.\n\nI know this is redundant because you probably won't read it or even \nunderstand most of the words i've just typed. But i still hope i've taught \nyou a thing or two about how to look like an intelligent troll. Next time \ntry a little harder.",
