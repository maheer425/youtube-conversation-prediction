Doesnt matter what champ you \nplay I promise you will succeed if you follow those basic steps. Get better \nat CS'ing and Capitalize on the many many mistakes the enemy makes, like \nwhen they attack you in your minion wave, stay in lane on low hp, play \nagressive with very low mana, over extend with no wards or means of escape \ni.e. flash on cd.\nHope that helps :) ",
