Example I can pray for a soulmate, a \nbusiness or for success and I can end up with exact opposite. If I pray for \nhealing, a change of heart, or another spiritual concern of my heart he \nwill answer. Why is there murder, rape, and other horric deeds going on is \nbecause of us. We have free will, an example: if Chris went crazy and \nkilled a man it was because he used his free will to do so. Free will is \nthe reason why this world is as corrupted as it is. Because ppl abuse it. \nPpl's decisions to either do right or wrong. If I got killed it's not God's \nfault, it would be the person who killed me. \ufeff",

For some reason I do not quite believe that JK \nRowling could have written the gospels. Actually, the fact that these books \nwere so easily agreed upon in the early days of the church facilitates the \nidea that they were, in fact, written by the original apostles. Jesus sent \nthe apostles out to spread the word of his good news. Through this, they \nreached many places, and were able to tell their stories to many people. It \nis true that the gospels were written several years after Jesus left earth, \nbut that shouldn't come as a surprise. Oral tradition was highly valued \nback in those days, and people would not take changing an apostle's words \nlightly. Actually, them eventually writing it down should be almost \nshocking. It would not be a strange assumption to think that the only \nreason they decided to write down some of what Jesus did in his life was \nbecause the Holy Spirit guided them to do so. \n\nA gospel labeled \"The Gospel of Thomas\" (I'm sure as someone who studied \nthe Bible, you know who Thomas is. He was an apostle that we regularly \naddress as 'Doubting Thomas') That gospel was thrown out of the running for \ncanon because it was written around AD 150. My point with all of this is \nthat \n1. At the very least, the gospels were written within the lifetimes of the \nrespective apostles\n2. The gospels were actually most likely written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, \nand John because the people who had heard their stories (and that would be \nquite a few) would have a problem going along with what they knew to be a \nlie",

Frankly, if you find yourself praying for a new car I think \nit`s a good time to conduct a priority check. It`s my position that \nanything one might pray for can be achieved or acquired without \nsupernatural intervention. It`s my \"wish\" that more people would come to \naccept the fact and take greater strides in achieving their own goals.\n\nIn regards to so-called \"miracles\"; well, this is a sore spot for me. I \ntake tremendous exception to crediting god simply because modern medical \nscience can't provide an answer. I get even angrier when doctors use the \nword miracle - it's akin to saying \"I am the last step before god, if I \ndon't understand it, then it must be supernatural\"; it's arrogance to the \nextreme. Only 100 years ago medical science didn't understand influenza and \nmillions of people died; today our understanding is far more advanced.\n\nI also hope you understand that I, like most atheists, do not take issue \nwith \"A\" god, we take issue with any human interpretation of god. Priests, \nRabbi's, Preachers and Shaman are all humans; the bible itself was written \nby human's - everything you have learned about \"god\" has been the result of \nsomebody else's interpretation.

First I will copy and paste some of what you said and give you \nmy experiences from them. \n\nLet me respectfully say this, I admire that you do all of those things \nwhich we believe as Christians are holy, and I respect that you are not \nrude nor are insulting anyone on here, so I will make my claim respectfully \ndue to my experiences, like you have.\n\n\"there are things in life that are outside of our control - bad things \nhappen to good people but how we process those events is within our \ncontrol. \"\n\nTo answer this, the bible says, \"it rains on the just and the unjust\" which \ninterprets that bad things happen to good people, and bad people, it \ndoesn't matter if you're going to heaven or not, life happens.\n\nI've had a lot of bad situations in life ( as I am sure you have ) and a \nlot of good situations. With that being said let me quote this line and \ngive you my experiences and thoughts. \n\n\"So why give god credit when things go well while never holding him/her/it \naccountable when they go poorly? For that matter, why involve a god at all?\"\n\nIn my everyday life I have been in situations such as: Not getting the \nvehicle that I wanted, or the house I wanted, maybe some clothes I would've \nliked to have ( all of these I have prayed for ). With that being said, \nbecause I did not get those things I think to myself, \"maybe God did not \nwant me to have the vehicle, house or clothes at that time because he knew \nif I would've purchased them then I would've had financial trouble later \non, maybe it was not my time to receive such rewards\" Now, you're reading \nthis and wondering, how is this so bad? Well, entirely it is not, but to \nsome people it is. As far as the starving child, the people dieing of \ncancer, ect. Unlike some other religious leaders who wrote off pain and \nsuffering as just being illusions, Jesus was honest. He told us the truth. \nHe said in John 16:33, \u201cYou will have suffering in this world.\u201d He didn\u2019t \nsay you might \u2013 he said it is going to happen.  \n\nTherefore, we might best respond by saying that God does not Will \"bad\" \nthings to happen in life. Rather, \"bad\" things happen in the freedom that \ncomes with the gift of life. When \"bad\" things happen to any of God's \nchildren, God is grieved and suffers with us, experienced most vividly in \nthe hurt and suffering of Jesus the Christ for all humanity. Any \"bad\" \nthing which happens is never the last word. Rather, God is the deepest and \nlast word, and that word is love and eternal life with God.\n\nBy this God have man choice, weather to go to heaven or hell and it is by \nmans choice that there is so much bad in this world, he gave us wisdom to \ninvent things and create bad that way we have choice. Let me answer this \nwith a story about Noah, God allowed the Earth to flood to get rid of all \nthe sin in the world. The bible talks about when Cain killed Able that Cain \nwas cursed for 4 generations and thus his family with him, that means for \n40 years his children and grand children were cursed due to actions of \nCain, so sometimes God takes those who are dear to our heart, hoping to \nopen our eyes and let us start believe in his Grace. \n\nIf you think about it, aids is a punishment because of homosexuality, I am \nnot condemning anyone nor am I judging, I am just making a point as to my \nexperiences and beliefs. \n\nNow to bring up the \"baseball player hitting a home run\" I can assure you, \nwith all due respect, God doesn't care about sports, games, or anything \nthat keeps our focus off of him. \n\nI've had a lot of experiences in life that God truely exists, from the time \nI was diagnosed with SIDS, even now when my ex-girlfriend had a baby with \nno ovaries, and my grandfather was told by doctors in 2001 that due to his \nexcessive drinking and drug addiction problem in the past that he had 6 \nmonths to live, he is still alive today.\n\nI tell you all these because I have experienced it and I believe it. Thank \nyou for taking the time to read this. I do know it was long and I do \napologize.",

                    "text": "+DireldaKitsune\nThank you for replying Direlda, I truly appreciate your comments. First \noff, wouldn't crediting a friend for my actions be like lying? All I'm \nreally hoping to convey is that love can be shared with or without a deity; \nif I'm viewed a braggart for sharing my own experience, so be it. While I \nwouldn't like it, I prefer that to being dishonest.\n\nSecond, I don't think I could agree more; there are things in life that are \noutside of our control - bad things happen to good people but how we \nprocess those events is within our control. There are countless examples of \npeople who had difficult beginnings and went on to achieve greatness - \nNelson Mandela comes to mind. The reality is, we can only control what we \ncan control and humbly accept that which we can't.\n\nThird, regardless of which factors are at play with a baseball player, they \nare in play whether the player strikes out or hits a homer. So why give god \ncredit when things go well while never holding him/her/it accountable when \nthey go poorly? For that matter, why involve a god at all?\n\nFinally, when reward and punishment are part of the equation, it's not \npossible to know if an action is one of pure love or one of self-interest. \nNonetheless, assuming that you're correct and that some religious people do \nact out of pure love; the point remains the same - god is not required; \nlove is simply love.\n\nPS. We also don't choose to carry the burden of Adam and Eve's sins and yet \nhere we are - at least according to christianity.",

                    "text": "+Larry L\n No one is responsible for everything that happens in their life. A person \ncan't make a tornado not hit their house.  Getting hired or accepted into a \ngraduate program has just as much to do with the people making the decision \nand the pool of applicants as it does with the person applying. A foster \nkid isn't able to get only the good foster parents and avoid the abusive or \nneglectful foster parents, nor is the foster kid able to prevent themselves \nfrom being moved from family to family.  A person doesn't chose the \nsocioeconomic status, ethnic group, country, and family they are born into. \nRegardless of what someone believes about God's existence or non-existence, \nthere are things outside of people's control that affect their lives in \nboth negative and positive ways.\n\nFor instance, to use your baseball example, if it were true that it was \njust hard work, dedication, and practice that led to a batter hitting a \nhomer, then one would expect that batters would get to a point where every \nball they hit would be a homer.  But that is not the case.  There are other \nvariables, such as the pitcher, the speed and type of ball thrown, and the \nweather (especially wind) to name a few, that affect whether or not a ball \nbecomes a homer.  And even the most hard working, dedicated batter with \nyears and years of practice can strike out.  Now whether someone chooses to \nreduce these occurrences to physical causes, or call it luck, or see it as \nGod working things out is up to them.  But the reality remains that there \nis something more than just a person's own efforts at work.\n\nGranted, the view that people are responsible for everything, good or bad, \nthat happens in their life can be rather inspirational and motivate people \nto stop commenting on YouTube, get up off their bums, and make positive \nchanges in their life and/or the world.  However, this view has a dark \nside, which is why I've taken the time to reply.  Because if people are \nresponsible for everything that happens in their life, then every bad thing \nthat happens to them is their own fault for not being good enough, smart \nenough, and so on.  So in this view, it is the foster kid's fault that they \nwere placed in an abusive family and that if they just tried harder they \nwouldn't be abused.  And that is ABSOLUTELY wrong. These \"slings and arrows \nof outrageous fortune\" are not their fault.\n\nNow that the mischief is done, it's time for this fox to run.\nBlessings and peace!\n~Direlda\n\nOh, and if you didn't mean to brag, then why didn't you tell us that it was \na friend of yours who did all those good things? Most of us on YouTube \nwouldn't know better.  It's absolutely wonderful that you do such work and \nyou should keep at it.  Seriously, the world needs more people who do good \nout of love. But if you don't want to come across as bragging, tacking on \n\"I don't mean to brag\" at the beginning or end isn't the way to do it. All \nthat does is come across as another way of trying to look good.  Better to \npretend that it's somebody else who has done your good if you want to be \nhumble.  Also, not everyone who believes in God does good as a way of \nearning points for heaven or avoiding hell--some of them are like you in \nthat they do it out of love.",

I wrote and published a book to \nhelp people lose weight and live healthier lives and I give that book away \nto people at significant expense to myself. I also give money to homeless \npeople, volunteer at shelters and provide free counseling to those who wish \nto change their lives. I don't say these things to brag, only to illustrate \nthat people can be good without a deity in their lives. Taken further, I do \nthese things purely out of love for others and not to win points towards a \nheaven or to avoid being tossed into hell. And to be clear, nothing or \nnobody influenced me that there is no god. You were not born a christian - \nthat was something YOU had to be influenced into by somebody or a life \nexperience.\n\nI really don't wish to sound like one of those angry anti-god atheists that \nlives to insult christians; in fact, the opposite is true. I would just \nlike christians to accept reality; that THEY are the ones responsible for \neverything in their lives be it good or bad. For example, baseball players \nthat look up to the sky when they hit a home run - IT WAS NOT GOD; it was \nyears of hard work, dedication and practice that helped them hit the homer. \nWhy don't those same players look up at the sky and ask \"Why have you \nfailed me?\" when they strike out? Imagine how a starving child might feel \nwhen that player thanks god for helping him hit his home run.\n\nFinally, there is no such thing as a \"god follower\". People follow rules of \nthe bible (written by humans) or as laid out by a human \npriest/minister/rabbi (also humans). Just because a human being said that \nthe bible was inspired by god doesn't make it true any more than if the \nauthor who wrote \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" were to make the claim.\n\nI'm sorry, this got longer than intended.",

God made human beings for the \nreason you stated  we provide love for each other, joy, support and \ncompassion. Unfortunately some humans can be evil, self centered and \nselfish. Anyone who uses the excuse of God did not call on me is not being \na true God follower but that doesn't mean we don't need God. If anything it \nproves even more how much we need indeed need him. God is Love we love \nothers because he loved us first. God new you and loved you before you were \neven born.\nYou said \"Turning away from somebody in need is deplorable whether \"god\" \ncalls on you or not.\" SO TRUE!!!!!!!!!!! but that goes back to showing how \npeople can being selfish and inconsiderate. But not everyone is like that.\nPrayer is a powerful tool. Praying is a solemn request for help or \nexpression of thanks addressed to God. Some people think I pray and sit \nback and watch something happen. Although that is possible it's not always \nthe case. You are right get up off your butt and do something. God never \nsaid be lazy and expect me to hand everything to you. No we talk to God \nthrough prayer the same way we do with someone we trust. But actions on our \npart also have to be taken. I am sorry someone or a life experience has \ninfluenced you to believe there is no God. But I believe there is and my \nlife is proof of that. God Bless.",

I \nmean, where do you stop, the murder level, the lying level, or the thinking \nlevel? If we want Him to stop evil, we gotta be consistent, we can't just \npick and choose.
