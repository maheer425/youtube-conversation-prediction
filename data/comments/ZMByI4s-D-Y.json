The \"Weight\" is the gravitational \nforce acting on a mass and since the gravitation is not uniform on earth, \nthe weight also depends on the location. But those guys are actually not \ntalking about weight but about mass. A mass of 1kg is everywhere on earth 1 \nkg and it's also 1kg on the moon or in space where there's almost no \ngravitational force acting on the mass.In our daily life we mix up weight \nand mass very often and most of the balances we use every day they actually \ndon't measure the mass but they measure the weight and convert it into a \nmass unit (g or kg). The correct unit for weight would be something like \nNewton (N) or kg*m*s-2. Still I do not recomend asking the butcher for 1 N \nof t-bone steaks ;-)When they brought back the sister kilograms to Paris \nthe actually compared the sister kilograms with the big K using so called \nmass comparators. These are instruments which can measure the difference of \ntwo masses very precisely and the gravitation cancels out. So we can be \nvery sure that all those protoype kilograms must have changed over time.The \nchase for a better definition of the kg is still ongoing. Both groups, the \nAvogadro guys and the Watt balance guys haven't been able to come up with a \nprecise enough definition but the Avogadro guys seem to be closer now \n(2015).",

For technical \napplications it is crucial to know how round something ist, therefore it is \ndefined in all industrial standards. It also can be measured and has a \nunit. So one object can be rounder than others. For example a ping pong \nball is less round than this sphere, if you would measure it. This also \nleads to the insight that there is no round object. Even the sphere in the \nvideo shows a surface error, like they said. So there are only \"roundly\" \nobjects, or undefined volumes.\nBesides that, your idea of a ping pong ball being as round as the sphere in \nthe video is due to the resolution of your measuring device (eyes). It all \ndepends on what you want gain from it - to differentiate between apples and \nbananas its precise enough, for producing a decent ball bearing it is not. \nThats why your definiton of roundness fails on this, your measurement \ndevice is just not accurate enough for this case :)",
