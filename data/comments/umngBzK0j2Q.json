It's like he's bored with it.  I tried new toys \nand it doesn't seem to make a difference.  When he was 2, he'd jump after \nthe toys, and really propel himself high to get it.  now I don't see him do \nthat anymore.  What am I doing wrong?  Or is it just old age on his part?  \nI never can get him panting either, no matter how hard I try.  Please give \nme some advice.\ufeff",

If he is a little bit less active but otherwise healthy, \nit's ok. Once they are 6 or 7 they will want to sleep most of the time \nanyway. If however your cat loses all interest, stops grooming himself, and \nbecomes apathetic, of course there is something wrong and you need to take \nhim to the vet. If not, don't panic, try new toys, and try to adjust to the \nschedule of when he's in play mood and when he isn't.\nOne question: Is he a house cat or free range? Because free range cats have \nseasonal activity - in spring they jump to action, and in winter they \nalmost hibernate. House cats have the seasonal thing a little less \npronounced. But my cats, after spending 3 months behind my wood stove \nsleeping, just brought me 3 birds home in 2 weeks. It's spring.",

Something about them dulls out.  Outside/Inside cats \nhave a wildness, an aliveness about them, that  prisoners just do not \nhave.  I earnestly believe that it is wrong, maybe even animal abuse, to \nkeep a cat inside until its wits dull.  Cats need to hunt and explore and \nrun.  My cat comes and goes as he pleases, and I can't even imagine keeping \nhim locked inside! \n\nOne time I took in a cat that was 'lost' and let him into my home.  After 2 \ndays with me, I let him outside again, and he came back after a few hours.  \nHe was with me for several weeks when he started to spray my apartment, so \nthat is when I took him to the SPCA (not sure if there is an American \nequivalent, in Canada that is the organization that takes care of domestic \nanimals).  And found out that the cat belonged to someone else, and had \nescaped from them.  Sadly, the cat was returned to the original owners, of \ncourse.\n\nIn my view, that cat was lively and vivid and intelligent, and if he \nescaped from his captors (yes I will call them that) and did not return, \nthere is a reason for that and they do not deserve to have him.  .  He came \nback to me after 2 days, and always came back after a few hours when I let \nhim out. \n\nI know he is now doomed to a fate of being imprisoned until his wits dull, \nand it saddens me.  If he escapes from his owners the first chance he gets \nand does not come back, he obviously does not want that life with them.\n\nI've been reading in the comments here that some people keep their cat in a \nCAGE??!1? and then wonder why it runs away from them and hides?? Goodness \ngracious! Poor thing!!\ufeff",

To this day \nwe don't know if he died somehow or found another home++). The fact that \nthe actual owners had him tagged and registered actually says a lot \npositive about them - and you've no idea if he ran away or he just decided \nto adopt some more humans. as you've not seen him again, yes there is a \nchance that he's purely an indoor cat now - but there's also a chance that \nhe's been castrated and therefore has a far smaller home territory he lives \nin (and consequently is highly unlikely to visit you again for that very \nreason - but is still an indoor/outdoor cat). ...

As parents we are to keep \nthem safe and if that means keeping them inside then that is what has to \nhappen. When you get home put them in a harness and go for a walk each day. \nYes, I mean put a harness on your cat or kitten and take them for a walk. \nAt one time I lived in the French Quarter and had a cat and 2 Shitzus, so I \nbought a leash that was designed to walk more than one furry baby at a \ntime. I put the kitten between the dogs who eventually grew taller than the \ndogs, which was cute. They had a wonderful time and I took them for rides \nin the car, too, so they were never deprived of being outside each day, but \nwere always safe with me.\nAs parents of furry babies we always have to take into consideration our \nenvironment and the babies safety. If they were human children you would \nnot just open the door each day and them run free if they were to young. It \nha a lot to do with common sense.\nIn the morning my furry babies are fed and I love and play with them, then \nI unlock the pet door and sit outside while they are playing in the \nbackyard, because we have coyotes, hawks, etc that would easily carry off a \nkitten, but when my boys were fully grown they were fast and strong. They \neven protected me from a coyote one evening. It approached me with the \nintent to kill with head lowered, ears back and teeth bared. My boys came \nraising out of the house and surround it taking turns swatting at it until \nI could get my bb gun. Once, they saw I was safe they ran back in the house \nand I shot. It did not kill it but bbs really do hurt, so I did not have a \nproblem with that one, again. I have wildkife that I have looked after \nsince they were babies, especially raccoons and my furry babies arefine \nwithem because they would come up on the porch where I was sitting and I \nalways have water bowls and food bowls there, too. They would touch me on \nthe leg an I would give them some dry food in one of the bowls. They are \nhuge, too, now, but still touch me on the leg and I give them food. I named \nthem, as well, when they were babies, so I call them and they come running \non the porch for their last feeding at night.",

                    "text": "+angelbrownie1  As long as your feeding your cat regularly you really don't \nhave to worry about them running off and not returning. All of my cats have \nthe freedom to go outside whenever they please, and three out of my six \ntake advantage of that and go out every day. My other three don't feel so \ninclined so they don't go out. My cats usually come back every night but \noften they stay out overnight and occasionally stay out for two or three \nnights, though that is extremely rare. They always return though as this is \nwhere they have steady food and warmth and family. My cats will let me know \nif they want out by either standing at the door or meowing at the door to \nget my attention and when they want in they will scratch the door to alert \nus. You do, however, need to worry about them being hit by a car if you \nlive near a road, though if it's a dead end or a very lite traffic road the \nprobability is lower. I live on a country road with little traffic so it \nhasn't been an issue. We've been here for 7 years now and our cats are \nfine, though I do have a fairly decent amount of woods and a creek out back \nso they tend to go that way rather than crossing the street. If you do live \nby a heavily traveled road you may want to keep your cat(s) indoors. Also, \nyou mentioned having your cat stolen and this isn't something I have to \nworry about since I know my neighbors but it may be a problem near you, so \nyou may want to put a collar on your cat. I don't collar mine but as I've \nsaid I live in a rather rural region so it works for me. You also have to \ndeal with fleas and ticks unless you treat them Monthly, which is what I do \nand have never had a problem with either. I use Revolution flea and tick \ntreatment which cost about a hundred dollars for a pack of six and they \nsell it at the vet, but Frontline works well too, as does many other \nbrands. We just prefer the Revolution because it's a bit stronger and has \nadditional benefits. I advise every pet owner to try and keep up with shots \ntoo, but if you only have one cat it isn't too expensive. For us and our 6 \ncats, food, liter, flea treatment, and shots ends up being a bit pricey, \nbut its well worth it. ",

Also, to \ndiscipline a cat, never strike them, this won't teach them anything except \nanger towards you, instead, spray them with water when they misbehave, this \nwill teach them to not do what it is that causes the punishment, just make \nsure you spray immediately after they did whatever it is you deem \npunishable.

Just \nkeep in mind that they are playful and will do things that can annoy you, \nlike scratching furniture or interupting your view when reading or on the \ncomputer, but its out of love. Hope this helped.",

Go figure he got off the lead and wandered off.

He acts very much like a dog (even plays fetch with his fuzzy blue \nball) but so much smarter. It's a breed many people don't know about and \nperhaps pure breads are more difficult. All I know is everyone whose ever \nhad one gets sold on these guys and they become owners of multiple Maines. \nHe's a water cat and even tho i have an enormous fountain he will only \ndrink out of the sink, we have agreed that once we purchase our next home \nthe bathroom faucet will be motion sensor so he can do it himself.

                "text": "One of the most important things to remember when dealing with cats is that \ncats, just like people, are individuals.. There ARE some things that fit \nalmost all cats (like much of the cat language, both verbal and non-verbal) \nbut many things, especially when it comes to habits, can vary widely \nbetween individual cats..\nIf you are having trouble schedule-feeding your cats, try free feeding. If \nyou've tried free-feeding before and there were some behavioral problems, \ntry adjusting how you act instead of how your cats are forced to act. Or, \ntry using a better quality food.\nBetween myself and my wife we have 5 cats (3 at my house and 2 at her \nhouse) and the only time we've ever had any trouble was when we tried a \nfeeding schedule. The feeding worked well, but certain behavioral problems \n(such as scratching furniture and crying at night) started occurring. We \ntried this for a couple of months, but when it was made apparent the cats \njust simply did not like it, we went back to free-feeding and things are \ngreat.\nIf your cats are perfectly happy with having food out all the time, sleep \nwell enough to let you sleep, and (perhaps most importantly) are able to \ncontrol their eating habits enough to not be overweight, then there is zero \nreason to stop free-feeding.\nThe advice here on how to free-feed is GREAT, but I felt I should post this \nbecause some people may not understand that this advice is not applicable \nto ALL cat households.\nThe only time I've ever had any trouble with free-feeding (that's in a 35+ \nyear life with many different cats) has been when times were rough and we \nhad to buy cheap cat food. EVERY time I've EVER seen cats put on cheap cat \nfood, there have been behavioral issues... If you treat your cat right, \nlisten to what they tell you, and STILL have trouble, upgrade the quality \nof their food before trying to alter their lifestyle and habits. I won't go \ninto what foods I have found that work or which brands have CONSISTENTLY \ncause problems, because this is not a commercial :)  (I will note that, in \nmy experience, the most expensive brands are certainly not always best, \nbut, in the same line of reasoning, the absolute cheapest has caused \nproblems more times than not)\ufeff",

I've always done the free feeding with about a tbsp of \nwet food for breakfast and dinner.  My last cat would act like she was \nstarving to death if we were late with the wet food and would wake us up on \nthe weekends for breakfast.  My current cat mostly could care less if she \ngets it or not but she'll direct me to the kitchen if she wants her wet \nfood.  Both cats gave up on me going to bed at scheduled times.  Between 11 \nand 12 - bedtime for kitty.  They both seemed to like to get up around 4 or \n5, grab a snack, use the litter box and then just hang out on the window \nperch watching the world wake up until I do.",

As this study:** \nhttp://www.journalvetbehavior.com/article/S1558-7878%2812%2900122-0/abstract \n** shows, simply living with humans dramatically alters a cat's patterns of \nactivity.. This study also shows (although, indirectly) the importance of \nmaintaining a set schedule. If you stay up until 2 a.m. a night or two \nevery week, you're teaching your cat that staying active that late is \nperfectly acceptable, so of course they don't want to go to bed at 10 p.m. \nthrough the week, just because you have to work the next day...

It was very effective and it made the cat stay away from the \ndoor in a harmless way. I think after a couple of weeks they were able to \nremove the compressed air because the cat had learnt not to approach the \ndoor. It won't make the cat jumpy apart from the sound of compressed air, \nwhich is naturally mimicking a cats' hiss anyway.\n\nJackson would never use a training technique that would subject the cat to \nexcessive stress or any pain.

Find out where your cat \nis laying, then go to him and clip a nail. Then give him a kitty treat, \nthen walk away. Little doses at first so he doesn't get mad, he'll get used \nto it instead. Eventually, you'll work your way up to trimming the entire \nset then giving him a kitty treat. And important, as long as you clip a \nclaw, he gets a treat. Don't let his behavior effect if you give him a \ntreat or not, he gets one as long as you clip a claw. Clipped claw=treat. \nHe'll figure it out eventually.\n\nAnd always remember, only the tip of the claw!",
