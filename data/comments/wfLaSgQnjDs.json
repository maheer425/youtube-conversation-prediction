You have to work with the dog as each dog is different, there \nisn't a magically way for all dogs.\n\nSounds like you have exactly the right dog for the actions suggested in \nthis video. Go slowly, work your way to the paws, and make it an overall \npositive experience.\n\nFind out what your dog loves. Most labs love water. Some dogs find play \nparticularly rewarding. Some dogs really love certain foods. Like the video \nsaid, it's all about positive reinforcement, and making the experience good \nfor the dog so that he associates nail-clipping with reward.\n\nMost dogs love food and will take food, unless they are nervous or anxious. \nIf you practiced a strict routine while raising your dog, and he exhibits \nfood aggression and/or aloof behavior around food, something may be wrong.\n\nBest of luck!",

If there is not, you might be forced to either \nraise the chick yourself or humanely euthanize him/her.

If \nyou don't have the specific food powder, you can improvise. If the chick is \na songbird, mash some fruits into a paste, mix with some water (the younger \nthe bird, the more water), and feed via a 1cc syringe. For columbiformes \n(pigeons and doves), you have to find a crop milk substitute. For corvids \n(crows, magpies, scrub jays, etc.), I actually don't have a good idea, but \nI've seen people use mashed cat food.

I would introduce the clippers in a very non-threatening \nway, like lay them in your lap and call her over. Don't even point the \nclippers out, just give her a treat. Once she knows she's in for a treat \nsession and she's happy about it, put the treat on your lap next to the \nclippers and that will be the starting point. Keep pairing the treat with \nthe clippers. Slowly you can put the treat on the clippers, or move the \nclippers slightly, an eventually hold them in your hand. Take very small \nsteps toward your goal.\n\nAlso make sure you're working toward touching her foot. Don't introduce the \nclippers during foot massage time. Once she's doing good with the clippers \nand foot touching, then you can bring them together. This is going to a be \nslow process, but even if it takes a month or two, reducing the stress she \ngoes through is worth it. Good luck!",
