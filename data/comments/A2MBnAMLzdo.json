The German maglev is an incredibly \nsophisticated and expensive piece of technology, this system would be much \ncheaper because its less complicated and uses less energy.\n\nThe Transrapid as a technical exercise is an amazing piece of technology \nbut the way the track way is built makes it incredibly costly, it has a \nhuge amount of switching gear and power substation and needs a very \nspecific type of electromagnet.\n\nI mentioned in a previous post how it levitates, it isn't pushed away from \nthe track, its pulled /up/ towards the track from underneath by a magnet \nthat is turning off and on rapidly. The whole track way is constantly \nenergising and deactivating as well. Several other banks of electromagnets \nare also pulling and pushing it with a kind of electromagnetic \"wave\" to \nprovide its propulsion.\n\nA tube with magnets in would not need to be so sophisticated, just some \nsimple electromagnets. They would levitate and propel the carriages simply \nbecause of the properties of the electromagnets and they would just need to \nbe there so to speak, it wouldn't need complicated ones with a a huge \ncontrol and switching system that provide all the clever tricks that make \nthe transrapid work.\n\nHowever I think think there are many other issues other than its technology \nthat will stop this project. its too out there for one and people will \nnaturally prefer the tried and tested high speed rail which is one of the \nmost reliable and safest form of mass transit ever. It could carry cars too \nif there was ever enough demand as the Eurostar is a good example of a road \nand rail system.\n\nIt would be dead politically too, there will be a vested interest that \nwants a rail line and they will provide pressure on the authorities with \nlobby groups and so on. \n\nI am enthusiastic about the technology true but I am enough of a realist to \nunderstand that this will never see the light of day in this project, it \nmight be something that works out elsewhere though.",

You can knock \ntogether a model of it at home, I would bet its a simple tube with embedded \nelectromagnets powered by the solar panels and a magnetised vehicle. As its \na tube the vehicle does not touch the walls of the tube at all as its \npulled equally in every direction unlike a maglev where the train is pulled \nup towards the track giving the appearance of it \"hovering\".\n\nWhen you activate the first set of magnets it flings the vehicle down the \ntube, each set of magnets accelerate it until you near the half way point \nwhere the polarity reverses and decelerates it. It wouldn't need any more \nmaintenance than a rail line and would probably need less as there are no \nimpact or friction forces involved, just some corrosion checks on the \ntubing and maybe sending the equivalent of a \"geometry train\" (the ones \npacked with sensors to check every aspect of a rail line) down once a day \nto check everything is aligned and the magnets are fine.\n\nThis is the only technology that would be cheaper, maglev technology is far \nmore expensive and costs at minimum 3x the build cost of a high speed rail \nline.\n\nLike any project though there would be hidden costs and unanticipated \nproblems and issues, thats of course it is what I think it is as well as it \nmight be something else but this would be my best guess as the concept has \nbeen around for a long time.",
