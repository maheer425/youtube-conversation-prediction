I'm not saying anyone *here* did \nthat, btw. But back then, on tumblr at least, some Monchele fans were just \nout of line and cursing other Glee co-stars as well because they had get \ntogethers and such (not just the memorial) and were smiling at some \nphotos... from personal experience, I can tell, it is perfectly fine to be \nsmiling,  it can take days for someone to finally accept it and no denial \nin the world is enough.\n\nI don't think she's a sell out because she's healing.

And I thought my \nheart break a little. It struck me then, that she isn't brave, she isn't \nstrong, she isn't a goddess of all things nice; She is just a normal girl \ntrying to keep it together as best as she could after the loss of her \nlover. She is positive about this because she has to.\n\nI love how they talk about Cory once they got the white elephant out of the \nway. Ah, the fond memories. That truly is the best way to keep the departed \nin the world. Ellen is quite fond of Cory, I think, but she never really \ntalked about him when she interviewed the many Glee stars that came on her \nshow during this period. I'm glad she saved that part for Lea.\n\nI haven't realize this until now - Lea and Cory were the sweetest couple \nbecause both of them genuinely were sweet, sweet people. \n\nTo everyone who knew you, whether intimately or not, you brought them joy \nwhile you lived, Cory.\ufeff",

I haven't had \na drink in 10 yrs, 4 months, 2 weeks and five days but I still don't feel \n\"cured\" nor do I feel I've truly earned their forgiveness. They've given it \nto me anyway and I love them all the more for it but whenever I crave a \ndrink (every day) I remind myself of the price they paid while I was \nguzzling anything that would pour. Never again. \n\nCory never made that decision, never accepted the responsibility for his \nown actions and while his death is sad it's not Cory who really pays the \nprice for his selfishness. Those he left behind pay that every day and they \ndon't deserve to. That's why I say and stand by my comment. Cory was weak, \nselfish and brought his death upon himself.

You are entitled to your opinion \nand I honestly respect what you believe.\nBut here is my side -- first of all about the Chris/Darren thing: they \nnever said they were in a relationship. That BG article specifically said \nthey had only hooked up a few times in the past. (wait are you on tumblr? \nif you are you must have seen certain gifs from glee life and a specific \nthing in an old photo-shoot between the two actors where they were not \nexactly behaving how \"just friends/co-stars behave\") so if that can happen, \nwhat can't? We don't know their lives. That's the entire point.\n\nYeah I was referring to the articles about Lea/Cory and at first I was in \ndenial. I was like 'ha! good joke' but as time went by and heard more about \nit, I believed it.\nI know Lea said most what we read is fabricated but what should I believe \nthen? This hardly 6-minute-obviously-scripted interview? No. I truly \nbelieve those articles. They do have base to them. Sorry if that's \noffensive to you or to anyone but that's it.\nOkay but even you can't say that everything on BG is a lie. If you believe \ncertain articles are a lie that's completely fine but there is a lot of \nstuff that has been proven true. Remember \"RobSten\"? BG called on that PR \nof a relationship months ago and everyone was still in denial and sent hate \nto BG.",
