Please tell me who is uneducated ?? \nu got be kidding, you need stop being delusional my friend. Allah already \nwarned us from ppl like you and im not gonna waste my time on u. when Allah \nguides you we talk.\n\nRead what your creater is telling and may allah guide you.\n\nAlif, Lam, Meem. (1) Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, \nthe Sustainer of existence. (2) He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], \nthe Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah \nand the Gospel. (3) Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the \nQur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a \nsevere punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution. \n(4)Indeed, from Allah nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven. (5) \nIt is He who forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity \nexcept Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\nsura Al-Imran 3:1-2-3-4-5\nhttp://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/3:1\n\nKnow that Allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. We have \nmade clear to you the signs; perhaps you will understand. Sura 57:17\n\nKnow that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and \nadornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth \nand children - like the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth \npleases the tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow; then it \nbecomes [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and \nforgiveness from Allah and approval. And what is the worldly life except \nthe enjoyment of delusion. Sura 57:20\n\nRace toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the \nwidth of the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believed in Allah \nand His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He \nwills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty. Sura 57:21\n\nNo disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in \na register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy. \nSurah 57:22\n\nIn order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in \npride] over what He has given you. And Allah does not like everyone \nself-deluded and boastful Surah 57:23 \n\n[Those] who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess. And whoever turns \naway - then indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy. Surah 57:24\nhttp://tanzil.net/#57:17\n\nAnd let not those who disbelieve ever think that [because] We extend their \ntime [of enjoyment] it is better for them. We only extend it for them so \nthat they may increase in sin, and for them is a humiliating punishment. \n surah 3:178\nhttp://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/3:178",

There are MILLIONS of Muhammadans that \nthink the way you do.   The only good passage in the Quran is al-kafirun.  \nmore Muhammadans should practice it. \n\nIt is clear from your post that Muhammadans and the rest of humanity are \nlike oil and water, and as long as there are people that think like you, \nthere can never be such thing as peaceful co-existence.  Then again, for \nthe Muhammadan, his idea of peace can only occur if every person on Earth  \nis either a Muslim or a dhimmi of them.  Please don't reproduce.\n\nYou speak of multi-culturalism as a bad thiing.  It's a GREAT thing, but \ncurrently only two groups don't seem to have an idea of what it is.  \nIllegal immigrants and Muslims.  Illegals, because they are uneducated, and \ntherefore ignorant. Muslims because they are supremacists.  Man, you prove \neverything I accuse you Muslims of.  Honest Muslims like you are hard to \ncome across nowadays!",

Come on, Sharia law doesn't implicate on burglars if they stole \nsomething without threatening the owner by kill; if the owner of that thing \nwouldn't complain about it and wouldn't be in a keen need of it. Sharia law \nhas its own precepts, it is not arbitrary and not mainstream as you reckon \nsaying. Furthermore, it is not Islamic law, it is Sharia. I advise you to \nconstraint yourself from being a weak-minded.
