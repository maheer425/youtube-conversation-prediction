If it gets hot enough, the \nproteins and other compounds that make up your cells start breaking down, \nand undergoing chemical changes (denaturing) because of the heat. Once this \nhappens, that tissue is basically dead. Beyond that tissues dehydrate, die, \nand sustain damage.\n\nYour body responds by rushing blood to the area to cool the burn down and \nbegin repairs. It also begins releasing chemicals that cause swelling in \nthe area. This is why burns are red. If the burn is worse, blisters are \nformed. Blisters are sacks of fluid your body produces in order to protect \nthe healing damaged tissue. Blisters should contain clear fluid. They can \nalso contain blood, which is usually caused by a forceful injury, or pus if \nthe blister got infected. If the burn is worse still, it can burn holes \nthrough the skin, or even through all the way through to the bone.\n\nDepending on the severity of the burn you can lose sensation in the part \ndue to damaged nerves. burns can also result in skin that lacks pores, \nmeaning the skin can no longer sweat, or, I think, produce the natural \nprotective oils that keep your skin hydrated.",

In \ncomputer science, white can be defined as either the hexcode \"#FFFFFF\", or \nthe RGB \"255,255,255\", but measuring color outside of the computer is done \nvia measuring the wavelength in nanometers, but since white is the \ncombination of all colors, you can't just add up all the frequencies or \nelse you will get something infra-red (or longer), and I don't think you \ncan take the average, or else you'll get the color in the middle of the \nlight spectrum (I think it's green), so how would you go about measuring \nthe frequency of a white light, or to put it another way, what is the \nfrequency of white light?\ufeff",

Businesses, run by humans, individuals, \ncapitalize of the market to gain wealth.\n\nI return back to my story about Rockefeller see my Nov 19th comment)...\n\n\"Rockefeller saw plumes of smoke and slag oil being tossed into the trash \nand he chose on his own to refine oil better, create less pollution and get \nbetter fuels.\n\nSome other people saw that the left over oil that was tossed out could \nbecome clothing, cleaners, plastics and so on.\"\n\nIf you want to see examples of making products better (nearly impossible to \nsee without government interference, but...) we can look to many products \nand businesses.\n\nDuring the 2008 \"great recession\" many companies' heads took little to no \nsalary in order to not reduce workforce. Many companies have offered health \ninsurance and retirement without the force of law.\n\nYou can certainly say that before the Enlightenment and the Great \nAwakening, more focus was on the wealth of the person in charge, but it was \nalways the government (church was a defacto government) who run the \nproduction and if there were any businesses and business men who could \ncapitalize, it was a family run business or kept very small.\n\nWhen the industrial age came about, you had a transition from old \nmentalities (as humans may evolve, but they are not always as fast to \nrethink thins, as you can see we still tend to the government is needed to \nrun our live model even today). But as getting government to let the market \nrun on its own is a new idea (historically speaking). and few countries \ntoday even come close, you only see the system working in these few \ncompanies here and there.\n\n\"If there is a big machine with exposed moving parts that can grab and kill \nyou if you get to close but the company won't put a guard rail up because \nit costs money, would they ever without an external force coming in and \ntelling them to? \"\n\nHard to say, as a company that has large machines like that are often \npropped up by the government rather than allowed market forces. The closest \nyou could find is the farming industry and you do find that the farmer will \nbut new machines that aren't as dangerous when they buy new machinery. But \nmany will continue to use a knife or a simple cutting instrument. In that, \nit is their choice, but those often have few employees and make no money \n... until the government tries to save the family farms.\n\nThe external force is what makes changes. It is usually the invisible hand \nor it is a ruler. Bottom up or top down.\n\nIn your example of a guard rail, there have been companies who put one up \nbecause they can't maintain a workforce without that simple change. There \nare other companies that don't and the employees do the democratic thing \nand collectively fight it. Unions aren't bad until they become the ruling \nclass and a defacto government, not allowing competition.\n\nBut when you look at the various things that stayed static under the \ngovernment while technology soared without the burden, or even the things \nthat had a time under one, then a time under the other, you see that \nletting the free market take the lead is often better than the government.\n\nLook at the Internet. You have people complaining about the businesses \nrunning and choking bandwith. Really? When the military was running the \narpnet development (1960-1980), it was just them and research scientists. \nThey called in private researchers to help develop the system, but it \nwasn't until the late 1980s to 1990s that it sped up for public use. And \nonce it was handed to the public without the regulations, it went from 300 \nbaud dial-up that cost $1 per minute and took hours to download a small, \nfuzzy GIF to DSL to Cable and fiber optics that run fast enough to download \na high def 3 hour movie in under a minute... while you watch it and talk on \nthe Internet phone and email your friends and chat on Facebook.\n\nAnd now the government says this is bad and they need to make it a utility?",

And \nyou would give the vote to people and risk they pick the wrong politician \nwith the view that the light bulb is not worth banning and reverse that? \nSo, something you think is harmful, but isn't, you force people to not buy, \nbut something you know would create the same or similar scenario, with same \nvoting possibilities as an item on the market, you leave to the public to \nchoose.\n\nYou want some cake?

In the case of light bulbs the market was shooting for the stars \nwith CFL as the people wanted them... until about 2007, when something \nhappened (want to guess what?) and the number of incandescent bulbs began \nselling at a ridiculously high rate.\n\nYou concept is great, but the Bubba Effect took hold and where simple \neducation was winning, the government passed a law that turned the market.\n\nBy the way... duh, a business on an individual level will choose to make a \nprofit on its own and to you and +Darth Obscurity  (who asked when \nbusinesses historically switched from seeking profit to benefiting the \nlaborers), each individual looks to their own morals and the society's at \nlarge (\"Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith).

That's because I was making a joke.\n+Malidictus I'm fairly sure neither type of bulb produces \"pure white \nlight\", partly because that's a contradiction in terms.  \"Pure\" light is \nmonochromatic, whereas to be perceived as white a light source must have \nroughly equal spectral power against each of the three cone cell response \ncurves - many spectra can achieve this, from the 'three narrow spikes' of \nthe RGB LED to the black-body spectrum of a hot object.  Daylight and \nincandescent bulbs both have (approximately) black-body spectra.\nWhile these spectra cannot be distinguished from direct transmission, they \ndo produce different results after reflection from a surface - the \ntrichromatic LED effectively samples the albedo at just three frequencies \nwhereas the black-body effectively integrates the albedo spectrum against \nthe cone cell response curve.  In theory it would be possible to make an \nobject which appears white by broad-spectrum light but black by LED light.  \nThe reverse however would not be possible; an object that is white by LED \nlight could be dark grey by broad-spectrum light, but not completely \nblack.  Isn't that fascinating?  Mmm, science.\n+Natasha Taylor Curiously, the \"crisp white\" light is technically 'warmer' \nthan the \"yellow glow\"; look up 'colour temperature' and 'black-body \nradiation'.

Hell, I got a couple mailed to me \nfrom Cree a year or two later so I could use them on a toy I was building \nfor myself. They weren't super-bright like blue LEDs are now, but they were \ncertainly blue LEDs, and they were awesome. The green ones weren't GREEN \ngreen, anyway, they were that lime green color. The same breakthroughs that \nled to blue LEDs led to \"true green\" LEDs.\n\nWhich reminds me, SciShow could and should do a follow-up piece on how/why \nred, green and blue are all that is necessary for us to perceive white \nlight. Or have they done that already?",

It wasn't done.\nThen these japanese men worked on a project, using their work as a basis, \nto invent the working LED in the late 80's and perfecting it in late 90's.\nThe main point I'm making here is that the nobel prize was given for a \ndiscovery made about 30 years ago.

The old vinyl albums were old and didn't fit the new wave \nof technology of hi-fi and cars and transistor radios. There was \nreel-to-reel magnetic tape and then hi-fi 8-tracks as the new groovy tech \nthat you could take in cars and play in portable players.\n\nBut as fast as technology was back then, 8-tracks had only from 1965 till \n1982, 17 years. Meanwhile the cassette tape took the older ree;-to-reel \nidea and in 1950s it began rolling out the technology, not really ready, \nbut growing. By 1971, the cassette tape took off and caused the downfall of \nthe 8-track.\n\nBut CDs were on the beginning of their treck in 1980. By 1993 CDs took over \nfor all magnetic tape, especially as computers were beginning to use CDs as \nwell.\n\nThe album was an Edison invention, like the light bulb and both will be a \nnovelty and be around for a long time, but for popular use, the new \ntechnology of magnetic tape was the future.\n\nReel-to-reel is the same as the old mercury tube lights. The cassette tapes \nare CFL, but the 8-track was a traditional medium in magnetic hi-fi.\n\nCDs and DVDs are the LED technology and MP3s are all digital. I can't \nimagine an all digital light source, but it's out there.\n\nThis change was market driven, just as the switch over to CFLs and LED \ncould easily have been.\n\nI can't imagine what would have happened in the turbulent times of the \n1960s and 1970s if the \"man\" tried to ban magnetic tape and push CD tech \nbefore it was ready.",

The ban in the USA \npassed in 2007, where there was a dip in CFL sales and increase in IC \nsales. But the law too effect in the phase out in 2010 and the big dates of \nthe phase out were 2012 and 2014. When you look at the actual numbers, the \nsales may have jumped in 2007 and held steady, the numbers dip in 2010 and \nfall for IC when the law is in full effect.\n\nBasically, once the government has the corporations that make light bulbs \nunder the law, the compliance is going to be obviously a drop. But CFLs \nwere the 8-track from the transition from albums to CDs.\n\nhttp://greensavingsco.com/2010/12/statistics-from-nema-prove-sales-decline-of-incandescent-lamps/\n\nAnd I do repeat, I have no problems with LEDs or CFLs. I just don't see the \nneed to force people to switch, as the numbers showed we were already \nheaded that way.\n\nAnd usually Australia is the best comparison with laws like this as they \nare a frontier country that has similar sensibilities to the USA on things \nlike guns, healthcare, and such.

You don't like it because it endangers your possition.\"\n\nHate to break it to you, but you can't blame a light bulb for the pollution \nan electric generator puts out. Like I said, if I am only using wind to \npower my light bulb, then the pollution is zero. If the light bulb's \npollution changes based on another variable outside that bulb, then the \nbulb is not the issue, it is that outside variable.\n\nFor example, I can power an LED with dirty oil and it will put off large \nparticle pollution rather than the fantasy CO2 pollution. Does that make \nthe LED now the environmental catastrophe you want to prevent? No, because \nit isn't the bulb causing the pollution.\n\n\"It seems you just didn't wanted to take on the issue of public health.\"\n\nThe issue was not about public health. If you want to take that on, you \nhave to address the source of the pollution, but you obviously would rather \ntackle the light bulb.\n\nAnd, as I later point out the government ban had a reverse effect on the IC \nsaturation.\n\n\"In Chile, the prices dropped by 75% in like 5 years of campaigning. They \nare still ten times more expensive, but it seems just sticking a piece of \ncardboard saying \"this is an stupid choice\" above IC cheap lamps made a \nhuge difference.

There's \nstill dumb monkeys getting second degree burns from hitting IC lamps, but \neven fires went down.\"\n\nAnd in the USA the market saturation for IC was declining just on the \nmarket and people (who are smart) switching over to save money (even when \nthe bulbs were expensive). The free market works.\n\nTake these two charts that show the same thing about sales.\n\nhttp://freedomlightbulb.blogspot.com/2012/03/us-sales-of-cfls-have-fallen-since-2007.html\n\nhttp://www.ledinside.com/news/2013/3/survey_incandescent_bulbs_20130304\n\nIn the second link, they hyped that LEDs are making big inroads, though \nthey don't mention two things 1) that LEDs have been used in battery \npowered lamps and in flashlights and decorations for a long time, \naccounting for their penetration (Christmas lights alone are a major LED \nmarket) and 2) what happened before 2007 and the law banning IC bulbs.\n\nAs you can see in both charts, from 2008 to 2011 IC bulbs gained \npenetration. But the first link shows the hidden story. From 2003 to 2007 \nCFLs were climbing by market forces alone to replace IC bulbs by 2009 or \n2010. But then in 2007 (the year the ban passed in the USA), CFL \npenetration dropped. There wasn't a big break-through in LED tech until \nrecently (2013/2014). And if people were truly concerned about the \nenvironment, then this stat alone should make them weep that the government \ncut off the bulb switch, creating 3-5 more years of those (as you seem to \nthink) bad bulbs.\n\n\"Ironically, this provided a lot of assesment tools that do work much \nbetter outside the US, were people are more willing to balance opinions, \nrather than entrenching in self-defense/relentless destructive attacks.\"\n\nSays the man calling human who know better \"dumb monkeys\" and \"uneducated \nstupid monkey\". And yet Americans trust human and most other countries who \ndon't trust humans put a handful of humans in charge of their lives. Ironic.\n\n\"At least governments have more means to process more inputs from more \ndiverse source, and can project on long term planning.\"\n\nAnd yet, they fail so often.

And we cannot measure the synapses \nactivity, only an overall side-effect of that activity with EEGs and the \nspecific centres activity only by observing the increase in blood flow, \nwhich, as you may presume, is not very specific, so much so that you cant \nmeasure tiny clumps of cells activity. Thats why you need big electrodes \nimplanted in the brain (most of the really specific results on humans come \nfrom tests done on epileptic patients undergoing surgical treatment with \ntheir own accord).
