The proof is in the regulation requiring the studies as every \ntransferal counts as a new business.\n\nBefore the Clean Air Act people forced polluters to fix problems through \ncivil laws suites and now they can't as the legislation that formed the EPA \nvested that power to the EPA and cancer ally from oil refineries in the \nsouthern states still exists due to the EPA only applying tiny fines and \napproving toxin levels.\n\nPolicing Wall Street is easy they make bad investments and they go out of \nbusiness and the public learns to pay attention to their investments \ninstead of blindly dumping money on Hucksters. But you Rewarded them with \nbailouts and quantitative easing so they have no incentive to stop their \nbehavior.\n\nOSHA can be eliminated by simply using the negligent homicide and assault \nlaws as they have far greater penalties and are readily enforceable.\n\nWork hours and wages is a simple matter that resolves it's self when \ncompetition is allowed IE workers are unhappy with 80 hours a week they can \ngo to a business that wants happier more productive workers that offers \nthem lower hours per week and it happened back in the 1900's those who \ndidn't like it Moved on and the factory owners had to import more workers \nwho then moved on in successive waves.\nWages rise when businesses have a limited labor pool and the only real way \nto shrink that pool is to increase the number of businesses drawing from it.\nYour 40 hour week has been destroyed by the Affordable Care Act given that \nin order to avoid the penalties hours are being cut to less than 29 per \nweek and that means many people will have to get two jobs  increasing the \nhours worked overall to above 40. It does give a nice illusion that the \neconomy is improving however due to the want ads to fill those new part \ntime jobs.\n\nCapitalism exists without government regulations Bitcoin and other \ncryptocurrencies for example.

I don't think very \nmany people would say she does not make a passionate appeal. But she \ndoesn't express a deep loathing for Obama, the way so many of his critics \n(including TYT) feel compelled to. She doesn't call him a war criminal. She \ndoesn't accuse him of being a pawn of bankers. She doesn't say he is trying \nto destroy America. Those slurs might tickle the pleasure centers of people \nwho hate Obama, but they will not be effective at convincing anyone else, \nand they will actively push away Obama supporters. There are a lot of \npeople who voted for the president and who still like him quite a bit. If \nyou want to reach those people, and Elizabeth Warren does, you don't start \nby calling the president the anti-christ. Instead, you make a strong, \ncompelling, fact-based argument without the poison. \n\nShe's showing us that it works very well, and as I said before, a lot of \npeople (including TYT) could learn from her example.",

Israel consistently operates it terrorist state \noutside of international law and has been stealing land along murdering \nthose it has stolen from since 1948. The U.S. need to dump the Israeli \nparasite.\ufeff\n\nI have been a supporter of Warren. But, I will need to reevaluate that in \nlight of Warren supporting the Israeli theft of land and on-going genocide \nsince 1948. The United States needs to rid itself of the Israeli parasite, \nwhich ONLY buys us more enemies.\n\nVery sorry to see this important issue come between us Senator Warren. But \nin my thinking, if you are gullible to go along with the Israeli coercion \nof our government, then I can offer nothing but opposition to your \nmisguided agenda.\n\nVERY sad about this Senator,,, I will watch to see if you acquire some \nintelligence and clarity on this important problem.\n\nGood bye, sadly, Loren Salazar\n\nP.S.

Bernie Sanders has around 130,000 small donors, \ncontributing around $40, on average, to his reelection campaign. These \nsmall donors effectively give him the freedom to be his own man and not be \nat the mercy of corporate sponsorship to get reelected.

They'll probably offer \nher a ton of money, then take it away should she fail to tow the line and \nbegin to represent their interests as opposed to the interests of the \nAmerican people.

In \nthe ongoing farm bill amendment process, progressive champion Senator \nBernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced an amendment that would guarantee states \nthe right to pass and implement GMO labeling laws.  The statement of \npurpose for Sanders's amendment reads \"to permit States to require that any \nfood, beverage, or other edible product offered for sale have a label on \nindicating that the food, beverage, or other edible product contains a \ngenetically engineered ingredient.\"  Companies like Monsanto have argued \nthat states do not have the right to pass such laws, that only the federal \ngovernment has that authority.  Sanders's amendment would eliminate that \ncounterargument.\nGMO labeling is very popular among the public--and, of course, not popular \nat all with Big Ag.  In a YouGov poll from two months ago, 82% thought GMO \nfoods should be labeled, with just 9% opposed.\nIn what should come as no surprise because Congress listens more to \nindustry than to public opinion, the amendment failed.  The vote count was \n27-71. Among the 27 supporters were 24 Democrats, 2 Independents, and 1 \nlone Republican.\n ",
