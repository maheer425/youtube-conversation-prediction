As a kid watching the show, that's something I \nalways wanted to do--explore it. This game made my dreams come true after a \nlong, long, wait. Want to go to Rock Bottom? Jump off the edge of town! \nWanted to go to the Krusty Krab? Just walk inside! It's something most \ngames like this don't do. Typically they give you generic platforming \n(which most of the time isn't fun), and give you levels that are either \nsemi based off of areas in a show/movie, or completely \"original\" stages \nwhich have nothing to do with anything.
