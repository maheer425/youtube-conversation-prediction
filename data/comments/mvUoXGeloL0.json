                "text": "Expert spicy food eater here. I dunno why, but the scoville scale is often \nmisleading, lemme tell you why.\n\nI eat habanero hot sauce everyday, and I'm just fine, I don't feel much of \na heat. I also tried a ghost pepper sauce they produce in Seattle and I \ncould handle it perfectly. \n\nThe only sauce that makes me want to throw myself into a pit is a sauce \nI've only seen available in a taco stand in Mexico City. This taco stand \nonly opens at night (it starts serving tacos like at 10 pm and stops early \nin next day's morning); there are many taco stands such as this one that \nonly open at night because the sauce they serve is so spicy that drunk \npeople carve it so that their drunkness waters down. However, this \nparticular taco stand has the hottest sauce. \n\nAaaaaand, guess what?? The pepper they use for that sauce is chile de \u00e1rbol \n(the 4th pepper they tried, I think), which is significantly less spicy \nthan habanero. Not even the ghost pepper sauce I tried was this spicy. \n\nThis is why I say that the Scoville scale is misleading. I'd like to see \nthese two guys trying the aforementioned sauce and jump out the window.\ufeff",

For your information, I ate a ghost pepper once and it wasn't the \nspiciest thing I have ever had (the only thing that that thing did to me \nwas giving me a strong stomachache that lasted for about 30 minutes). If \nyou had born with spicy food in your crib, such as Mexicans or Thais, you \nwould know that some sauces are spicier than the peppers they use to make \nthem. Why? Because there are some ingriedients such as garlic and onion, or \neven other peppers, that intensify the flavour of the chile; temperature \nalso matters. So quit bullshitting and go back and eat hot buffalo wings, \nwhich is the spiciest thing you are gonna find.  ",
