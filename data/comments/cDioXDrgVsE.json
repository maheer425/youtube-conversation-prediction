Then they \nsend you another email asking you to send it to Nigeria, this email comes \nfrom an address *slightly* different than the first email - the address \ndifference is so slight that you don't notice (for example: \nFoxBoX@example.com instead of FoXBox@example.com). So you send the item to \nthe Nigeria and then the buyer claims they never received it and demands a \nrefund, they'll claim they never sent the second email telling you to send \nit to Nigeria instead of the UK. Now you've lost the item and you have to \nrefund the money. I hope this makes sense to you.",

Then a red headed girl \nwent to a old man parked in front of us. She started to fake cry and say \nshe needs money for something the man gave her $50 and drove away thinking \nhe done a good deed. Then the girl walks twords a family and asks for \nmoney. Then another. I tell my father he looks up and says he sees that \ngirl every time he gose up there and the same excuse. Then she to use. She \ncrys saying she needs money then while my dad talks to her I call the cops \nand she went to jail she called me a pice of crap and then the cop fount \ndrugs in her purse she cried and said it was not hers and now she got sued \nby the old man.\ufeff",

The people who fall for scams have red flags along the way, \nbecause the scammer is saying incriminating things along the way, yet the \nvictim still sends money.. It's hard to understand anyone falling for \nsomething so obvious.. Even the lottery you never enter, where you win tons \nof money, but you have to send money to get money.

After like 20 minutes, my PC was locked down, and it \nsaid \"Your PC have been blocked by the Police due to \u00a7Child pornography, \n\u00a7Use of illegaly downloaded software.\"\nThe funny thing was that the PC was almost brand new, and yes, i can admit \nthat i was torrenting, but no child porn, i swear!\n The interface was really well done, I mean, this could trick anybody! It \nhad \"Certified by Visa\" And all these fancy Certified logos, just because \nyou had to pay 100 dollars to the police as a fine by entering your credit \ncard number, or by using a PaySafe code.\n But I was smart enough (I'm not smart at all) to realise that it was fake, \nbecause one of the Certified logos was McAffe, an anti-virus program, and i \nwas like \"why the heck would it be certified by McAffe? If this wasn't a \nvirus, why would it certify that it's virus free? The police wouldn't hide \nviruses in their blocking programs.\"\n And that made me think it all over, i restarted the computer, turned it on \nsafe mode (where no exe's can boot up during start up\" And i typed in \nmsconfig to check all the boot files that booted up during start up. There \nwere the normals, Steam, skype, uTorrent, and what is this?\nTwo mysterious files that were named really weirdly, it was a random \ngenerated name like sdfhwrjjwdfw.exe and ghsgwewt.exe, i unchecked those, \nwent to my laptop and downloaded the anti-virus software called anti \nmalware bytes, put it on the usb, and plugged it in and removed the viruses.\nThe viruses was succesfully removed, and woop, the pc worked again. I have \nto say, the coder that made this virus is a really good coder. He had \nlocked everything, no ctrl alt del, no ctrl shift esc, no windows key \npress, no nothing. All i could do was inputting my credit card. But that \nMcAffe logo was the only thing that saved me through hell. And I'm not even \nsure it would unlock if I'd really put in my credit card numbers, most \npeople would try again, causing you to pay twice. \ufeff",

Apparently people call, usually \nclaiming they're from windows, (the call I got claimed they were from Dell) \nand that their server is receiving a lot of error messages from my computer \nindicating I likely have a virus. They offered to help me remove the virus \nat no cost.  I was half asleep when they called and so I just told them to \ncall back later. When I woke up and actually thought about it... I was \nlike,  'Wait, Dell is a money hungry corporation. No way they offer help \nfor something like this for free. I'll bet this is a scam of some sort'. \nSo, I talked to a programmer friend of mine and also looked it up online \nand sure enough. What they do is have their 'tech support' lead you to a \nfake website to download 'software' to help deal with the 'virus' but it \nactually downloads a real virus onto your system. Then they blackmail you, \neither you pay them hundreds of dollars or they leave the virus on your \nsystem to destroy everything (which they do anyway, no matter if you pay \nthem or not). My programmer friend's mother got taken by this scam herself. \nWhen the person called back later, I told him I know it's a scam and it's \nnot going to work. He just said, 'Oh' chuckled and hung up. The phone \nnumber was from one of those jacked phones that are connected to the \ninternet and scattered so it can't be traced. \ufeff",

The only thing that they seem to know about is \nwho is the new and shocking \"star\" on Dancing With The Stars or some other \ncrappy \"reality television\" show.  *sigh* Why must I be surrounded by \nidiots?  Well, at least on the positive side, I have made money doing \ncomputer repairs to fix the results of some of these other computer scams.\n\nAnother scam that was mentioned in the comments which is somewhat similar \nto a website claiming to be a government website is the FBI/ICE/Moneypak \nVirus.  It basically locks you out of your computer claiming that you were \nmonitored distributing copyrighted movies and music, pirated software, \nchild pornography, beastiality, and other kinds of really bad things.  As a \nresult, your computer has been locked by the \"FBI\", or \"ICE\", or some other \ngovernment/police organization.  These are serious crimes and if found \nguilty of these crimes, you would be sentenced to a long prison sentence. \n However, if you scroll down, you can buy off the United States Federal \nBureau of Investigation for a measly $300 which you can send to them in the \nform of an untraceable Moneypak from Walgreens.\n\nThese scams often rely on fear to get people to suspend their better \njudgment.  If you think about it, the notion that the government could be \nbought off for $300 is comical.  You need at least a few hundred thousand \ndollars funneled through a PAC to a legislator to buy off a government \nofficial (it's officially called lobbying and it's a big problem in \nAmerica, but that's a different video).\n\nUltimately, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and if you \nfind something frightening, stop a moment to collect your wits to try to \nsee how best to deal with the situation.",

Then, he receives a letter, saying there was a \nglitch, and more of his money will be needed to release or secure his \n\"winnings\". Warning #2!  While he is waiting for the money to come in, he \nreceives mail notices asking him to make purchases of inexpensive gifts. \n He figures \"why not\", I have this $$$ coming in, and well he doesn't want \nto risk not getting it by offending \"them\". Warning #3 (These are usually, \ndollar store merchandise, and hey, \"they\" can afford to send these as they \nalready have thousands of his $$$) He receives this cheap merchandise and \nit only reinforces his belief that they are real and true. He has lost \nthousands of dollars in 2 yrs  and he continues to insist that he is a \ndeclared winner.  In the meantime, he is receiving mail from other \n\"countries\" offering him credit cards with specific amounts  of $$$ readily \navailable. WARNING! WARNING!  Now, he needs only to fill out the forms with \nhis private information. He continues to this day to believe that money is \nforthcoming regardless of his bank account being hacked into, Although he \nhas been counselled by many friends, family and his bank , much to their \ndismay, he continues in his quest for the nonexistent fortune.  :((((",

Anything \nthat makes itself known to the user can be removed or bypassed and in some \nrare cases the user can get their own back on the original hacker. Best \nkinds of malware are the \"FUD\" kind that remain a ghost such as persistent \nkeylogger (My favourite was \"Project Neptune\") or an all out RAT (Not \nsomething that would make the user aware like \"DarkComet\" though unless you \nintended to reveal that their system was compromised)\n\nIf you can get hold of a new FUD crypter or posses the skills to write your \nown then building one from predefined templates is not original but pretty \neffective. From entirely owning the system to simply targeting keystrokes.\n\nMy point is that if you happen to have adware or ransomeware, do not panic. \nIf your AV can't help you then roll back, use a backup or if you really \nhave to - reinstall your OS. (Ofcourse you could remove it manually if you \ncould identify it however that would entail finding the probable \npersistence module aswell as whatever the genius can write)\n\n-- I wrote that because it's midnight and I was bored :/ (You may already \nknow most of this but it's the internet - the land of weird)",

So I looked up a help, and a day later, I had a Trojan_V_2 \n((I believe it's called)) virus, and it seems it blocked all my games. My \ndad has fixed it pretty good and he's done his best to remove the virus, \nand alot of the things I used to not be able to play, are playable. But \nanyways, Anybody know how to get rid of the Trojan Virus?\ufeff",

Yes, CS2 (and even Audition audio editor) is *de facto* free, good \nnews for anyone who wants to try these products out for personal \neducational non commercial use, but don't forget, *de jure* it is not free, \nbecause:\n*You can use the serial numbers provided as a part of the download only if \nyou legitimately purchased CS2, CS2 applications, Acrobat 7, or Audition 3.*\nSo if you have a company, and use it for profit, you can get in trouble, or \nif you work as \"computer guy\", and install it on someones system (even when \nthat someone asks you to do it) you can get in trouble as well.\n\nFree open source alternatives such as GIMP for photo editing, and Audacity \nfor audio editing and other free open source software can be installed on \nas many systems you like, and can be used for profit (but you should still \nstudy license file for every software you use, when you decide to use it \nfor profit), that is true even for some open source software, but is \nESPECIALLY true for Free software (not open source), where maker frequently \nallows private use for free but requires you to pay for it if you use it \nfor profit.\n\nI personally believe, morally it's okay to use pirated software and content \nfor educational purposes if you live in a poor family, but hey, law is a \nlaw, don't forget that when you decide to go on the next level - when hobby \nbecomes a job ;)",
