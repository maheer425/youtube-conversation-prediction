An example of bullying would be if I called these youtubers \"fags\" \n(which I wouldn't say anyway). My comment gave an opinion - that I find \nthem talentless and the taste level of their audience to be bland. There's \na difference between an opinion and bullying. And for you to call yourself \na professional and not able to tell the difference, you have put yourself \nat an even lower level than a tween who is unable to debate someone's \nopinion but rather gets offended by it. You, sir, are even less \nsophisticated in your thinking than that. And no, I don't care if you want \nto post my comment. If I can help your baseless career stay alive, then I'm \nhelping you put food on the table. You're welcome. But a person who claims \nto have any kind of scientific knowledge at all would greet my comment with \n\"I see what you're saying, but what would you define as 'talent' or \n'bland'?\" THAT would have been the response of a scientist. Not \"THIS \nPERSON HAS AN OPINION, HE'S A BULLY!\" which is essentially what you did. \nWow, a sociologist is not able to discern an opinion from petty bullying? \nIncredible. You make me disappointed for the field of science, sir. And \nI'll tell you where bullying comes from. It's a combination of insecurity, \nignorance, and the perception of power over another. My comment was not \nformed on these, but based on comparisons to others in the entertainment \nindustry. And in comparison, I find these youtubers' videos to lack talent, \nas there are many youtubers who put much more effort and thought into their \nvideos, and therefore, an audience who enjoys such videos must, by \ndeductive reasoning, have a bland taste level, or are otherwise easily \nentertained. You have proved one thing to me, and nothing else - that even \nin the world of science, there are people who don't know what they're \ntalking about.

So if y'all are gonna talk \nabout Tyler being gay, at least mention the fact that he also plays a major \nrole in supporting LGBT youth and don't just talk about his sexuality like \nit's anybody else's business.
