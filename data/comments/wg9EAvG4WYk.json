But relying on an inaccurate \nand disrespectful stereotype of a devout group of people is heart-sickening \nto me. Yes, the Puritans lived by a strict moral code and had some \nCalvinist theology that most people find weird today. But don't a lot of \npeople have similar feelings about Mormons? We owe so much to the Puritans \nculturally, religiously, and politically in America today. I understand you \ncan't take things too seriously when making comedy sketches but would you \ndo a sketch like this about a Catholic roommate? A Jewish roommate? Of \ncourse you wouldn't.\nI love so much of your work. Please don't cheapen yourselves like this.\n*Descending soapbox*\ufeff",
