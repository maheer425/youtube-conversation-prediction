                "text": "\nThis isn't about me. It is about my best friend. Her name was Karan. She \nended up running away from her brothers and father. See her father abused \nher and her brothers beat her up. I remember her telling me once that her \nbrothers raped her. I told her to tell someone, but she brought up a very \nimportant point.... THERE IS NO ONE THERE TO LISTEN.\nI did what I could. I gave her money, and shelter for the first couple of \ndays. Then she told me something else... she was pregnant. I didn't know \nwhat to do. I told her that she could continue to hide out in my room... \nsee my parents didn't think she was a \"good influence\" on me. So she did, \nand surely enough, she stayed for a short time.\nI got a call about a week after she ran away from my house. She said she \nwas having the baby, and she wanted me to come. I told her to call the \nambulance or I will. She hung up, so I called one. Well, she went to the \nhospital, and had the baby 2 months premature. If that wasn't bad enough, \nthe hospital found her dad and brother, and then called them down. I felt \nso bad cause I knew what was going to happen. But, there was nothing to do \nbut wait.\nWell, 2 weeks later she got to leave, with her dad. I remember her cell \nphone calling me, and over it I could hear her crying, and screaming for \nhelp. The switch of the belt... or something, and then it was silent... I \nfreaked and didn't know what to do. Then her dad picked up, and told me \nthat if I said anything he'd give me the belt next, and I wouldn't be so \nlucky.\nI was scared and didn't know what to do. I never talked to Karan for around \n2 weeks. Then she showed up at the door. She was on the run. Her baby was \nstill in the hospital, and like cowards, we left it there. We ran away from \nOntario, Canada, to B.C. Life was great. We were okay, and we planned on \nreturning for the baby once we were strong enough.\nWhen that day came, she did return. We got the baby, and returned back \nhome. Karen got a boyfriend, who ended up being a total jerk. She felt \nhopeless, and the last thing she told me, was to take care of her baby.\nI didn't catch on at first. But then, when I did, it was to late. She shot \nherself. I took the baby, and returned home, at the age of 17, one year \nlater. But, to my unpleasant suprise, my family had moved. I was homeless, \nwith a child, and my best friend's dad, brothers and boyfriend after me. To \nthis day I am still on the run from them. I would hate to see what would \nhappen if I did accidentally run into them.\ufeff",
