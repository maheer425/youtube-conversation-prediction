When I was your age I had a \nhorrific acne problem, really dry skin on the rest of my body, glasses, and \nbraces. I played sports, but I was also a huge dork. I was a tomboy, so I \ndidn't really get along with most of the girls in my class, and none of the \nguys were interested in me. I am an introvert, and at the time, I was also \nsuper shy. My 6th grade year was the worst year of my life. My parents were \nfighting and separated and all of my best friends went to a different \nschool. I didn't really have any friends and felt alone ALL the TIME. I had \nno one to talk to, no one that understood me or liked me just for myself. \nIt was so bad that I seriously thought about killing myself several times. \nThen, I had some people come into my life who reminded me that I was worth \nsomething. They showed me that it was ok to just be myself. I guess I'm \ntelling you all this just to give you hope. You still have a full life \nahead of you with so many possibilities. But, you have to learn how to be \nok with yourself and who you are. Right now, don't worry about what your \npeers think about you. Kids at your age are so shallow. Just focus on being \nhappy with who you are.\n\nRemember, you are not worthless. You are unique. One of a kind. If the \nworld lost you, we would be losing a part of it that we can never get back, \na part that can never be replaced. You have a special purpose in life, so \nfocus on figuring out what that is right now. I figured out that my purpose \nin life is to teach and help students, so now I'm a teacher who is almost \ndone with a Masters degree. There are times when I still struggle with \ndepression. There are times when I still struggle with insecurity. There \nare times when I still feel like a failure. But, all of that goes away in \nthe moments when I am fulfilling my purpose and can see the difference I've \nmade in other peoples' lives.",

I was the kid everyone wanted \nto use as the butt of their jokes, the kid everyone wanted to harass to the \npoint that he questioned if life was worth it, what was sanity and what was \ninsanity. Sure they didn't notice it, but slowly and slowly I started \nfeeling worse. I use to make myself throw up at school at times just to get \naway from all the hate and the harassment. I started getting headaches \nseverely when I was in middle school, and found out I have issues with my \nheart. \n\nThis went on until I was in 8th grade. In that time span, elementary to \n8th, I wanted to attempt suicide 3 times. The first time, when I tell my \nstory to people, they don't believe me. I was 12. 12 years old and wanted \nto die. To this day, I still battle depression. To this day, I still battle \na personality disorder. To this day, I have trust issues. To this day, I \nfind it hard to love- to think that someone who tells me they love me means \nit.\n\nBUT!- To this day I have opened my eyes that the world, despite how much we \nfuck it up, is beautiful. To this day, I've realized that all this drama \nand heartaches and sleepless nights are just a temporary thing. Life WILL \nget better. Some days will be better than others, vice versa. Hang in there \nand you WILL make it through. Suicide seems like a solution, but to what? \nSuicide is a long term solution to short term problems. One day people will \nsee you for YOU. Not based off appearance. Based on YOU as a human being. \nBecause outer beauty? Fuck outer beauty. Fuck trying to fit in, because \nbeing yourself? Being who YOU want to be?

                "text": "I think I should share my story. In grade school I was the one guy who had \nno friends, at lunch on the floor, BUT wasn't bullied. Then in high \nschool (third week of grade 9) I was punched on the bus for trying to talk \nto my friend. I stupidly punched back and now I am ridiculed. Embarrassed. \nAnd I'm still ridiculed, even after 4 months of staying quiet. Staying low, \nbeing nice to everyone. It does work after everyone forgets or someone does \nsomething has done something else that's horrible. I'm not on drugs, and \ndon't drink. I'm a good kid but other kids don't care. They see one mistake \nand take you as some freak and don't care what you really are. Even my \nfriends started to stay away so I wouldn't ruin their reputation. There's \nno way for me to permanently fix this, but then I found this video. This \nman changed it. When someone starts to bully me I just put in my headphones \nand listen to this. It saved me. Healed me. I guess the point of this is, \nwhen you do something wrong and you start to be harassed, just leave it. \nAnd if someone who doesn't have anything to do with it starts to join in, \nthat's when you take action (phrasing). Get help! No matter what they do \nthey have probably made worse life choices than you ever will! Nowadays the \nkid who I thought would pick on me the most stuck up for me because I kept \nmy  nose clean. He actually apologized for his friends. People do change, \nand it is hard, but after 2 months, it gets better. People do change! Just \nremember to take action, before loosing control. Sorry if I send some mixed \nmessages.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+TheIlikecookies123 Just so you know:\n\nDepression generally is linked to low levels of the neurotransmitter \nserotonin. Effectively at the ends of neurones where the transmission \npasses from one (pre synaptic) neurone to another (post synaptic) neurone, \nthe neurotransmitter passes through a gap called the synaptic cleft and \nbinds to the other (post synaptic) neurone to continue the transmission. \nWhat is commonly seen in disorders such as depression is that the serotonin \ndoes not pass as readily into the post synaptic neurone and is reabsorbed \ninto the presynaptic neurone.\n\nThis is where medication and antidepressants come in. As it happens the \ncontents of an average first aid kit cannot remedy depression but clearly \nthe implication was medication cannot help. Well in come SSRIs. Selective \nSerotonin Reuptake Inhibitors form a barrier as such over the pre synaptic \nneurone that \u2018inhibits\u2019 the reuptake of the serotonin into the neurone \nmeaning that it can pass more readily into the post synaptic neurone to \ncontinue the transmission.So since the implication was that medication \ncannot help you. As it happens, it can help. \n\nTo quote the NHS:\n\n\u201cIt would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental \nhealth conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in \nserotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to \nother types of treatment\u201c \n\nTo all those who want to give more detail to the post I just want to make \nit clear that I do know the process in more detail than this however for \nthe sake of keeping the post as simple and short as possible I only want to \ninclude relevant information for the process. No need to mention vesicles \nect. because it doesn't affect the fact that the neurotransmitters do cross \nthe synapse.",

Not some superficial reason about a god \nor something, because i know I'm better than them. And you are too.\ufeff",

Once we unshackle ourselves from the echos of cruel judgement, we \nrealize we have no need of anyone, for we departed from the social food \nchain long long ago.  The black holes of abyss that live in hearts of those \nwho feed on  belittling others, will always have need of someone to try and \nvictimize and magnify the perceived weakness of others, for they can not \nface their own.  Many of us who made it through such things, found strength \nin our individual purpose, embracing our weaknesses and magnifying our \nstrengths.  Many have learned to break the shackles and confront our own \nchallenges,   having no need for ego driven social strata competitions.  \nCreative solutions to social ignorance is top shelf.  I applaud you for \nstriving to enlighten through top self manifestations of creative \nexpression. Keep striving to light the path for a better day and a better \nway.  Cheers.",

With regards to examples of those who surpassed \nit, I'd like to point to King George VI and Winston Churchill, both of whom \nhad speech impediments, yet become known globally for their speeches to the \npeople.\n\nWhat frustrates me is how little such sentiments come out on TV. Don't get \nme wrong, every show, especially children's shows, has at least one episode \nabout being true to yourself. Some even go into the problem of bullying. \nThe problem is that so many of them delve into the subject so superficially \nthat they prove useless to those of us who end up dealing with it. This is \nquite problematic, given that these shows are often the first time we're \nexposed to the topic.\n\nThat's why I'm working on writing a show I hope to get made, adapted from a \nwork that actually addresses it openly and honestly, while still managing \nto be exciting and fun.

                    "text": "+EditDeath\nI have a number of self conscious manifestations as well as manifestations \nof dyslexia.  The first step to acknowledge strength is recognizing \nweakness in clarity with out elements of self persecuting judgement.   This \ncan be exasperated by those who only seek to exploit and demean the \nweaknesses of others for their abyss of insecurity, which is a black hole \nof dysfunction that can be satiated for a moment but will never heal or \nfill with atrocious mean spirited predatory behavior.   The reality is they \nare indeed wrong, but focusing on our own weaknesses in a derogatory way \ncan tend to make an individual overly self scrutinizing and resentful of \nthe wounds predators seek out and exasperate like piranhas in socials \nwaters of herd acceptance.  The blessing is that many who are deemed \noutcasts break from the herd, and with clarity from being distanced from \nit, can see the totally folly of the social mindsets around us.  These end \nup being the estuaries of the artists, poets, philosophers, and visionaries \ndetached from main stream delusions.  Some of the greatest minds though out \nthe annals of history, were indeed these social outcasts, brave enough to \naccept the unusual blessed gifts they were given and stand boldly in the \nface of any audacious, ignorant, and short sighted social norms.  The \nmanifestations of dysfunction does not have a face, but indeed it is a \nspirit to lift one self up at the cost of deprecating another.  This is a \nmanifestation I have coined the interpersonal teeter totter.  For the \nseverly insecure, life is something you live in perpetual competition, even \nwith the ones you call friends and family.  It is indeed a sickness  of the \nspirit, and the vicious teeter totter can live in lesser and greater \ndegrees in us all.  Knowing it can, is the first step to paying attention \nfor this spirit to grow in any, even ourselves.  Kindness, compassion, and \ncooperation are the paths to beneficial involvement, and society seems void \nof such spirits and when they see those spirits start to emerge in others, \nthey desire to rape it out of existence with acts of violence, either in \nwords or action.  Fighting the good fight, and knowing our own weaknesses \nis a step to strength the herd will find frightening as their actions just \nbecome mute to our spiritual eyes and ears.   Much like entering a smoke \npolluted room, the affects of grotesque negativity will cause even the \nstrongest to become subject to the pollutants.  Support and re-energizing \nthe power within is a constant necessity in staying as healthy as possible \nin a very smoke filled society.   Much like a proctologist, if we fight \na-holes all day long, we  are still submerged in the experience of dealing \nwith a-holes.  We will start to see the world through crap covered \nglasses.  Time to rest and restore and bathe in visions of positive \npossibilities can do immense healing.   The smoke of experiences past may \nlingering on our clothes for much time to come, but if we bend over to \nsmell the flowers, we will smell nothing else.",

                "text": "Oh how long the days have gone where everything wasn't so fucking black and \nwhite. I find it abhorrent that most people believe \"you should never have \nto change for people to like you\". Never huh? What about a person who gains \npleasure from seeing people suffer? Or the person that talks openly about \nhis hate for black people? Believe it or not, but some traits DO have to be \nabandoned in order to become accepted. It's like experiencing the death of \na loved one, believing they're not dead isn't going to bring them back, \nbeing who you were isn't going to change that, so you might as well let \nthem go.\n\nThis country has turned into such a kindergarten school; \"There's no \nexcuse\". I've been called plenty of names, been bullied as much as the last \nperson. I changed so I wouldn't be bullied. Insanity is doing the same \nthing over and over again expecting shit to change. Being accepted starts \nwith YOU. I've changed, abandoned some attitudes that I shouldn't of had, \nand I'm a happier person for it \"To This Day\". See what I did there? Being \nhappy or sad is just a state of mind and isn't a life changer. YOU, and \nonly YOU, ultimately control your life, not others.\n\nSo while I agree with some of this poem, I do not believe it's something \nthat should encourage people to stay who they are. If I didn't change, I \nwould still have no friends. Don't be miserable the rest of your life, \nCHANGE YOURSELF.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Horrible Four You obviously don't understand, can you like take a fucking \nclass? I'm talking about people who aren't able to change everything about \nthemselves. Yeah they can change themselves, BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU \nCAN CHANGE. You're saying that people who have their own personalities \nshould change? I'm not talking about drug addicts I'm talking about people \nwho take a look at their own individuality, you're saying that they should \nchange? Everything that people want to change about themselves they see the \nchange through from other people who reach out to them. Yes I'm anti \nsocial, but because of the people in my life, I've learned that I want to \nbe able to reach out to them more. That's not just a change, it's more like \na form of growth. Yes, we have bad traits, yes there are things about who \nwe are that we should change, But change can really happen if we're able to \nlet people be a part of the change that we're trying to make ourselves. \nBecause if we didn't have people reaching out to us, how would we know the \ndirection we should go? I never denied that people shouldn't change and \nstick to the way they are. What this poem is trying to say is that there \nare things we can and can't change about ourselves. The author of this poem \nisn't encouraging people to not change, in fact, he's encouraging people to \nstand up and more forward to change. But the thing that you misunderstand \nis what his focus is truly on. That is, that everyone deserves to be seen \nas beautiful, and through that beauty brings change. Like I said bro, take \na look at the video again. Because it doesn't take 100% of your brain to \nknow what he's trying to really say.. people are depressed because people \nmade them that way, but people can come out of depression by people who are \nable to love that person enough. Like I said before too, you change every \nlittle thing about yourself. But that still won't help you escape from the \npain and sorrow people once inflicted upon you.",

                    "text": "+Horrible Four Yes, there are bad traits. But a lot of bad traits come \nstraight from genetics and it's not the easiest thing to change how you are \non a genetic level. And you say that people need to change to avoid \nbullying. To a certain extent, everyone should alter their personality a \nbit to fit the situation based off of location and the people involved. \nBut, you're blaming the victims rather than the the perpetrators for the \nlatter's crimes.\n\nAnd this of course is all under the assumption that kids are bullied for \nthings they can just change. A physical deformity is not something that can \nbe changed without a lot of money for surgeries. A mental deficiency or \nillness is not something people can just change about themselves. One or \nboth of your parents being of ill repute is something outside of a kid's \ncontrol. Being poor isn't something that the victim can help or change. Or \nmy favorite, people being screwed with because of gender, race, or sexual \norientation. You know, because you just change that too. These are major \nreasons for bullying that seem to pop up a lot. You are making everything \nblack and white. Like every victim can just change everything to avoid \nbeing labelled as an outcast.\n\nI will submit that there are certain things that can be changed. But those \nare behaviors and not genetics or social class giving you a middle finger. \nWhile one's DNA structure will likely encourage certain behaviors or \nquirks, most people have the self control to not do things that will get \nthem fucked with. Like screaming about unicorns in public, or putting porn \non your school computer. Even then, subconscious thought is a powerful \nthing that can supersede conscious thought.\n\nAnd your examples of drug addicts and anti-social individuals. Those don't \nhelp your case much. It's not as simple as just changing and quitting drugs \nmost of the time. A drug addict's brain convinces them that they need the \ndrugs to keep living. Their brain will put them through hell to force them \nto use drugs again. Many through outside help can overcome this; but, it's \nstill extremely difficult and wasn't the simple act of just changing on \ntheir own.\n\nAs for anti-social people, you're using the term wrong. If you mean social \noutcasts, then they have become outcasts because of stigmas and bullying \nagainst them. Usually, for something outside of their control. An \nanti-social person is someone with Anti-Social Personality Disorder. They \nare sociopaths. They don't care about anyone but themselves and would only \nmake friends to screw with them for their own amusement. Those are the \npeople that need to change, but it is unfortunately impossible for these \npeople to ever change and genuinely feel something for another human being.",

In some instances, you do have to change \nyourself, nobody is perfect, but shouldn't you strive to be better? Why the \nfuck would you want to stay exactly where you are?\n\nDon't these people - whom are depressed, have no friends, and gets bullied \n- want to stop being depressed, start having friends, and stop being \nbullied? You're suggesting that this is \"okay\" by having these kind of \npeople stay the way they are, actively going out of your way to make them \nsuffer more.\n\nAm I changing every day? No, of course not, I changed until I was \ncomfortable. Why would you not want to change if you're upset staying who \nyou are? What if somebody is a drug addict and wants to quit? You're \nsuggesting they should stay the way they are. What if somebody is \nanti-social but wants to have friends?

Its about being accepted \nfor the things about yourself you CANT change. That people are still worth \nso much more than people think because they are the way they are.\n\nAlso people who find amusement in other peoples suffering? Thats exactly \nwhat bullies are bro. Bullies are people who hate on people not because \nthey need to change but because they are different. And I dont see why \nsomeone needs to change themselves to be accepted by the people who bullied \nthem. To change who you are completely for those kinds of people is \nabsolutely stupid. \n\nNow I'm not saying that someone shouldnt change who they are their whole \nlives. Because we all eventually change as our lives continue. But in order \nto make a better world, there needs to be love for every person. I shouldnt \nhave to bully a classmate for being into starwars and tell them that I \nwould only accept them as my friend if they play football.

I was afraid of girls because they were \ncruel to me, they said I was ugly and they will never go out with me, I \nstarted to hate everyone and started to hate God, because it was not fair. \nI was a great student, I had good grades, I was kind to most of the people, \nthen because of this my hate for everyone started to grow, I started \nhitting my brothers and started to bully my younger brothers.

I was an atheist as well, and now my path is different, the \npain, the suffering, the anxiety and the depression is caused by ourselves, \nbecause we take all of those words seriously, we choose to believe those \nwords. Its up to you to fight and choose not to take those words seriously, \nbecause you know yourself, you know what you are and what you are not.\n\nThe most important thing is to know yourself, see why its causing you \nproblems, why are you choosing pain instead of happiness. For me it was \nvery simple and it took me more than 6 years to find the answer.\n\nI was trying to find love from another person, I wanted people to love me. \nBut how I was going to find love in another person, if I didn't loved \nmyself first, I hated myself, I didn't even want to look at myself in the \nmirror, now I am learning to love myself, to take care of myself and things \nare very different now. I have a lovely wife, 4 kids and my life is going \ngreat and I thank God for the experience I am going thru right now.\n\nI know that most of you once they see the word God, you will start to \nquestion this answer, you will choose not to believe because it sounds \nridiculous in your mind. You are choosing pain, because you are so used to \nfeel fear and pain that you don't really want to choose God. You don't need \na religion to find God, you want a proof that God exists ? look at yourself \nin the mirror, take a very close look at yourself, at your surroundings, \nthe universe, how every system and ecosystem works, do you really think all \nof this is just a mere kind of randomness ? all of this its not random, \nrandom doesn't exist, if you flip a dice it will go 5, 6, 7 because it will \nfollow rules like gravity, momentum, force, and the initial position of the \ndice. So its not random, even in computers, how do you think random its \ncalculated ? we need to use factors like date, position and other \nparameters that you will put into calculations and will throw a number, the \nnumber just doesn't appear magically from nowhere, we make it look like \nthat.\n\nChoose another path, choose love instead of fear, happiness instead of \npain, choose another life, if the world around you is bad, change the \nworld, but first, you need to start from yourself. LOVE YOURSELF and you \nwill see change.",

chops and karate chops\nwere the same thing\nI thought they were both pork chops\nand because my grandmother thought it was cute\nand because they were my favourite\nshe let me keep doing it\n\nnot really a big deal\n\none day\nbefore I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees\nI fell out of a tree\nand bruised the right side of my body\n\nI didn\u2019t want to tell my grandmother about it\nbecause I was afraid I\u2019d get in trouble\nfor playing somewhere that I shouldn\u2019t have been\n\na few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise\nand I got sent to the principal\u2019s office\nfrom there I was sent to another small room\nwith a really nice lady\nwho asked me all kinds of questions\nabout my life at home\n\nI saw no reason to lie\nas far as I was concerned\nlife was pretty good\nI told her \u201cwhenever I\u2019m sad\nmy grandmother gives me karate chops\u201d\n\nthis led to a full scale investigation\nand I was removed from the house for three days\nuntil they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises\n\nnews of this silly little story quickly spread through the school\nand I earned my first nickname\n\npork chop\n\nto this day\nI hate pork chops\n\nI\u2019m not the only kid\nwho grew up this way\nsurrounded by people who used to say\nthat rhyme about sticks and stones\nas if broken bones\nhurt more than the names we got called\nand we got called them all\nso we grew up believing no one\nwould ever fall in love with us\nthat we\u2019d be lonely forever\nthat we\u2019d never meet someone\nto make us feel like the sun\nwas something they built for us\nin their tool shed\nso broken heart strings bled the blues\nas we tried to empty ourselves\nso we would feel nothing\ndon\u2019t tell me that hurts less than a broken bone\nthat an ingrown life\nis something surgeons can cut away\nthat there\u2019s no way for it to metastasize\n\nit does\n\nshe was eight years old\nour first day of grade three\nwhen she got called ugly\nwe both got moved to the back of the class\nso we would stop get bombarded by spit balls\nbut the school halls were a battleground\nwhere we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day\nwe used to stay inside for recess\nbecause outside was worse\noutside we\u2019d have to rehearse running away\nor learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there\nin grade five they taped a sign to her desk\nthat read beware of dog\n\nto this day\ndespite a loving husband\nshe doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s beautiful\nbecause of a birthmark\nthat takes up a little less than half of her face\nkids used to say she looks like a wrong answer\nthat someone tried to erase\nbut couldn\u2019t quite get the job done\nand they\u2019ll never understand\nthat she\u2019s raising two kids\nwhose definition of beauty\nbegins with the word mom\nbecause they see her heart\nbefore they see her skin\nthat she\u2019s only ever always been amazing\n\nhe\nwas a broken branch\ngrafted onto a different family tree\nadopted\nbut not because his parents opted for a different destiny\nhe was three when he became a mixed drink\nof one part left alone\nand two parts tragedy\nstarted therapy in 8th grade\nhad a personality made up of tests and pills\nlived like the uphills were mountains\nand the downhills were cliffs\nfour fifths suicidal\na tidal wave of anti depressants\nand an adolescence of being called popper\none part because of the pills\nand ninety nine parts because of the cruelty\nhe tried to kill himself in grade ten\nwhen a kid who still had his mom and dad\nhad the audacity to tell him \u201cget over it\u201d as if depression\nis something that can be remedied\nby any of the contents found in a first aid kit\n\nto this day\nhe is a stick on TNT lit from both ends\ncould describe to you in detail the way the sky bends\nin the moments before it\u2019s about to fall\nand despite an army of friends\nwho all call him an inspiration\nhe remains a conversation piece between people\nwho can\u2019t understand\nsometimes becoming drug free\nhas less to do with addiction\nand more to do with sanity\n\nwe weren\u2019t the only kids who grew up this way\nto this day\nkids are still being called names\nthe classics were\nhey stupid\nhey spaz\nseems like each school has an arsenal of names\ngetting updated every year\nand if a kid breaks in a school\nand no one around chooses to hear\ndo they make a sound?\nare they just the background noise\nof a soundtrack stuck on repeat\nwhen people say things like\nkids can be cruel?\nevery school was a big top circus tent\nand the pecking order went\nfrom acrobats to lion tamers\nfrom clowns to carnies\nall of these were miles ahead of who we were\nwe were freaks\nlobster claw boys and bearded ladies\noddities\njuggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle\ntrying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal\nbut at night\nwhile the others slept\nwe kept walking the tightrope\nit was practice\nand yeah\nsome of us fell\n\nbut I want to tell them\nthat all of this shit\nis just debris\nleftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought\nwe used to be\nand if you can\u2019t see anything beautiful about yourself\nget a better mirror\nlook a little closer\nstare a little longer\nbecause there\u2019s something inside you\nthat made you keep trying\ndespite everyone who told you to quit\nyou built a cast around your broken heart\nand signed it yourself\nyou signed it\n\u201cthey were wrong\u201d\nbecause maybe you didn\u2019t belong to a group or a click\nmaybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything\nmaybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth\nto show and tell but never told\nbecause how can you hold your ground\nif everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it\nyou have to believe that they were wrong\n\nthey have to be wrong\n\nwhy else would we still be here?\nwe grew up learning to cheer on the underdog\nbecause we see ourselves in them\nwe stem from a root planted in the belief\nthat we are not what we were called we are not abandoned cars stalled out \nand sitting empty on a highway\nand if in some way we are\ndon\u2019t worry\nwe only got out to walk and get gas\nwe are graduating members from the class of\nfuck off we made it\nnot the faded echoes of voices crying out\nnames will never hurt me\n\nof course\nthey did\n\nbut our lives will only ever always\ncontinue to be\na balancing act\nthat has less to do with pain\nand more to do with beauty.\ufeff",

Have I \nbeen cruel before? Yes! We all have made mistakes as children, but we've \nalso been been hurt a lot. BUT, the reason why I say you have no heart, is \nyou have taken your struggle (your mother attacking you), and USED it as an \nexcuse to justify insulting those who have had a completely different \nstruggle from your own. That, AND you also insulted certain race groups \nbecause they have a time to celebrate their emergence from oppression, even \nbefore they have yet to be fully out of oppression from the white upper \nclass. Bullying is something you cannot understand if you have never been \nthrough it, and I know none of the words I say will make you stop trolling \nbut I'm going to say it anyway. Depression is a natural result of bullying; \nimagine a wolf getting bitten and attacked by his own pack because he's not \nwanted there. So the wolf has to live on it's own for the rest of it's \nlife. Imagine how that would make the wolf feel, it wouldn't just \"Get over \nit\" as you claim is the easiest thing one can possibly do. Instead, he \nwould try to find another pack and hope they don't attack him as well, but \nyou claim that's \"Being an attention whore\". So then you can make the claim \nthat this wolf is weak and only the strongest survive, BUT THAT'S THE \nPROBLEM. People think selfishly, they think survival of the fittest is only \nan individual person based thing. It's the mindset of a bully that can \ncause things like the holocaust, and the nuclear bomb, \"Survival of the \nfittest.\" It's the reason that if humans go extinct IT'S MOST LIKELY \nBECAUSE WE KILLED EACH OTHER. Those who tell us to get over it are either \nthe bullies themselves, or they are completely ignorant to what it is. So \nno, we can't get over it, but you should NEVER forget our hearts aren't \nweak. I used my experiences of being bullied as strength to dedicate my \nlife to making the world a better place, just like the poet in this video, \nand people like you are who I'm up against. In the words of Shane Koyzcan, \n\"You can't agree to disagree when they're FUCKING wrong.\"-Help Wanted.",

The best way to make things better and prevent this \nsame kind of pain this video talks about is to seek understanding. I know I \nalways do, even for the \"worst\" kinds of people, like ex cons, pedophiles, \nand other 'deviants' on the edge of society. Most are not that bad, they \njust get a lot of hate because nobody actually listens to them and gets to \nknow all sides of these things. \"There are no monsters, only \nmisunderstanding\" -Landyn Haskin",

I could \ncomment the strength of his words, the accuracy of his message, or any of \nthat. But I will not. Instead, just like Shane, I will comment the nasty \ntruth that needs to be said: Hypocrisy. That rank filth that seeps into \neveryday life without individuals being aware that they, themselves, are \npart of it. Or knowing they are and being too apathetic to be bothered by \nit. I could comment about how I agree with this, but what would that \naccomplish? Mindless, forgotten, typical Youtube \"me too\" comment. No. \nHypocrisy. How many people have seen this and are moved by it, whether they \ncommented about it or not, and yet are actually part of the pain this video \ntalks about? How many people see this, think \"I agree so much with this\", \nand yet will go their entire lives blissfully unaware that they have \ndemonized others the same way the examples in the video were treated? \nPeople think they are so innocent - pleasantly ignorant to the pain and \nsuffering they dont know they caused or aided in creating. How many \nheartless, depraved, sickening, nauseating wretches believing they are pure \nand innocent? Or that they havent caused enough pain to be worth \nconsidering? How many people either too incompetent or apathetic enough to \nknow or care about the suffering they caused? I challenge you to drop your \npride and think. Not about what you want to be true or what you think to be \ntrue. Not about your delusions, your desires, or your ideals. Think about \nthis: What DONT you know? What have you likely never considered because it \nwas too risky to imagine your fault? Who have you hurt without ever \nrealizing it or giving it a second thought? Dont reply to this. Dont deny, \nadmit, agree, or disagree. In your own mind, consider the things you havent \nbefore. Consider the very real possibility that you have aided in, or \ncaused, the suffering of another and have been blissfully unaware of it. \nFor those of you whom may have trouble doing so: Think about YOUR pain. \nThink about what YOU have been forced to endure. Think about YOUR troubles, \nYOUR struggles, YOUR suffering. Think about the people that caused that. \nThink about the reason those things - those feelings - happened. Imagine \nthose people who hurt you went their entire lives never being aware they \ndid it, or not caring that they did even if they knew they hurt you. \nImagine those people being unaware of the pain they put you through, then \nask yourself \"What if that is how somebody else sees me?\"\ufeff",

What made me stop before i had done so was only \none thing...how would my parents feel, how would my family felt...if i had \ndisappeared...and i will never come back...that made me feel terrible \nbecause their lives was crushed because of my own selfishness to rid of my \nown problems...so i had stopped myself from making that killing thrust that \ncould've ended my life...\nSo that is why i care so much about people like you because people like you \nare great people to talk too and i enjoy your company...\nIK it was a bit of a mouthful...but i wanted to shave that off my chest \nwhile i still had it in mind...if you want you can tell this to others \nabout my story...relive my stress a bit...go ahead...",

This is one \nof the first videos that have legitimately brought me to tears.\n\nI have been bullied before, ever since I stepped foot into that hellhole \ncalled elementary school. I never told my parents about it, and when I did, \nI didn't say much. Becuase I didn't want to be known as the snitch or the \nweakling.\nI've always been one of those people in those special programs for the \nsmart kids (although i don't see myself as smart), and this brought on \neight years of being bullied because of it. Getting beat up, called names \nlike \"dumbass\" or \"smartass\", getting rocks thrown at me, ect. I lost \nfriends, because people didn't want to be around that girl that was getting \nteased or tricked all the time. There's still much more on that list, but I \ncontinued to live like nothing was going on, because I had always kept a \nshred of hope that things would get better, like they do in all of those \ndraw my life type of stories.\nContinued to lose friends, more bullying.\nParents got divorced, more bullying.\nGrandfather died, more bullying.\nMy sister became a force to be reckoned with halfway through university. \nMORE FUCKING BULLYING.\n\nTo this day, things are still going downhill, and every day, I start to \nlose a little bit of that hope that there actually is an uphill. \ufeff",

I was \nalways taught by my Mom and Dad that everyone was unique and I should learn \nto love them and protect them. Many times I got into fights simply because \nsomeone was being pushed around and I stepped in for the person being beat \non. Several times I didn't even know the people I was standing up for and \neven though I would get cuts and bruises, atleast I knew that I was making \nsomeone's life better. I often became friends with them and they would \nalways ask me why I helped them. It was a simple answer. I cared about them.\nIt does get better. Every single one of them agree with that statement. I \nam sorry someone like me wasn't there to help you. I wish I was. Nothing \nmakes me sadder than hearing about amazing people like you. Someone who \nshould be celebrated. Someone who should be loved. Not kicked around. \nYou're life WILL get better. While the hill you are on is steep, while \nevery step gets heavier, While it may seem like you will not get to the \ntop. You will come to a day where you finally feel all that weight lifted. \nMy friend once told me, Life is full of evil, but it is also filled with \ngood. We all encounter evil, but we also all encounter good. A primitive \nsaying but it got him through it all. \nI came close to tears numerous times while watching this because all those \nyears where I helped people in your position. I never would have guessed \nhow impactful this video would have been when I first looked at it. And now \nthat I think of it, I learned about this video from a friend of mine who is \n14, gay, atheist and also a native american in a very religious, racist \nwhite populated area.He sent me this video and told me that he was thankful \nthat I was there to help him through his first year of High school. I was \nnot in high school of course, but I was friendly to him, I made him feel \nlike he was wanted. He said that without me, he would have possibly \ncommitted suicide. I only bring this up because it will apply to you. Some \nday you will find someone who makes you feel safe. Someone that will \nshelter you from the evil of this world because you deserve it. Everyone \nwho this post applies to deserves that. This will get better everyone. I \npromise. ",

They make their insecurities as apparent as a derogatory term \nto others' faces, from a punch, to a kick, to the whines to the heavens. \n\nIt is not always about the victim of typical occurrence that must be taken \ninto consideration: the bully is at more fault for appropriate reason, but \nthey are hurting themselves far more subtly. They might not even be aware \nthat they themselves are actually becoming a bully: I did not know since my \nvision, hearing, smell, taste, coordination, memory, and other mental \nabilities were deteriorating at a horrifying rate.\n\nNow I know that my justifiable fear for others and hurting others because \nof my own mistakes was only holding me back in the same way that I never \nlet go of my regrets. I managed to self-rehabilitate myself to the point \nwhere I am now better person inside and out, even though I've always lived \nby my moral code.",

I was in the middle of puberty and it's \nusually not a moment when you feel confident about yourself and your body \nand everything, and I was younger than everyone else because I had skipped \none grade in the past. I had no one I could tell about it. I tried to tell \nmy parents, they told me I exaggerated or that I should get over it because \nit happens to everyone in school. That's not true. I was a real scapegoat \nfor my class. I would have told my teachers, but either they CHOSE not to \nsee it, or they went along with my bullies (it happened for real). I even \nhad a fight with some girls. It depends on your personality, I was just to \nshy, too afraid and too young to realize that what I was going through was \nnot normal. I feared that if I told something it would make things worse. \nSo I hid, made myself as invisible as possible, and waited.\n\nI took me many years to open up again and regain confidence. Of course if \nthis had happened to me when I was a little older, I would have handled the \nsituation differently, I would have spoken up, tried to defend myself. I'm \nnot who I was back then. Probably these events made me who I am today. But \ntoday, I'm a grown up, I'm not alone, I have friends and passions besides \nschool and things that keep me going. Bullying does not make you stronger, \nit destroys you on the inside, and it takes a lot of time to heal.\n\nI'm not complaining, I just want you to understand that not everyone is \nlike you.

                "text": "http://youtu.be/ltun92DfnPY\nWhen I was a kid\nI used to think that pork chops and karate chops\nWere the same thing\nI thought they were both pork chops\nAnd because my grandmother thought it was cute\nAnd because they were my favourite\nShe let me keep doing it\n\nNot really a big deal\n\nOne day\nBefore I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees\nI fell out of a tree\nAnd bruised the right side of my body\n\nI didn\u2019t want to tell my grandmother about it\nBecause I was afraid I\u2019d get in trouble\nFor playing somewhere that I shouldn\u2019t have been\n\nA few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise\nAnd I got sent to the principal\u2019s office\nFrom there I was sent to another small room\nWith a really nice lady\nWho asked me all kinds of questions\nAbout my life at home\n\nI saw no reason to lie\nAs far as I was concerned\nLife was pretty good\nI told her, \u201cWhenever I\u2019m sad\nMy grandmother gives me karate chops\u201d\n\nThis led to a full scale investigation\nAnd I was removed from the house for three days\nUntil they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises\n\nNews of this silly little story quickly spread through the school\nAnd I earned my first nickname\n\nPork Chop\n\nTo this day\nI hate pork chops\n\nI\u2019m not the only kid\nWho grew up this way\nSurrounded by people who used to say\nThat rhyme about sticks and stones\nAs if broken bones\nHurt more than the names we got called\nAnd we got called them all\nSo we grew up believing no one\nWould ever fall in love with us\nThat we\u2019d be lonely forever\nThat we\u2019d never meet someone\nTo make us feel like the sun\nWas something they built for us\nIn their tool shed\nSo broken heart strings bled the blues\nAs we tried to empty ourselves\nSo we would feel nothing\nDon\u2019t tell me that hurts less than a broken bone\nThat an ingrown life\nIs something surgeons can cut away\nThat there\u2019s no way for it to metastasize\n\nIt does\n\nShe was eight years old\nOur first day of grade three\nWhen she got called ugly\nWe both got moved to the back of the class\nSo we would stop get bombarded by spit balls\nBut the school halls were a battleground\nWhere we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day\nWe used to stay inside for recess\nBecause outside was worse\nOutside we\u2019d have to rehearse running away\nOr learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there\nIn grade five they taped a sign to her desk\nThat read beware of dog\n\nTo this day\nDespite a loving husband\nShe doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s beautiful\nBecause of a birthmark\nThat takes up a little less than half of her face\nKids used to say she looks like a wrong answer\nThat someone tried to erase\nBut couldn\u2019t quite get the job done\nAnd they\u2019ll never understand\nThat she\u2019s raising two kids\nWhose definition of beauty\nBegins with the word mom\nBecause they see her heart\nBefore they see her skin\nBecause she\u2019s only ever always been amazing\n\nHe\nWas a broken branch\nGrafted onto a different family tree\nAdopted\nNot because his parents opted for a different destiny\nHe was three when he became a mixed drink\nOf one part left alone\nAnd two parts tragedy\nStarted therapy in 8th grade\nHad a personality made up of tests and pills\nLived like the uphills were mountains\nAnd the downhills were cliffs\nFour fifths suicidal\nA tidal wave of anti depressants\nAnd an adolescence of being called popper\nOne part because of the pills\nNinety nine parts because of the cruelty\nHe tried to kill himself in grade ten\nWhen a kid who could still go home to mom and dad\nHad the audacity to tell him \u201cget over it\u201d as if depression\nIs something that can be remedied\nBy any of the contents found in a first aid kit\n\nTo this day\nHe is a stick of TNT lit from both ends\nCould describe to you in detail the way the sky bends\nIn the moments before it\u2019s about to fall\nAnd despite an army of friends\nWho all call him an inspiration\nHe remains a conversation piece between people\nWho can\u2019t understand\nSometimes becoming drug free\nHas less to do with addiction\nAnd more to do with sanity\n\nWe weren\u2019t the only kids who grew up this way\nTo this day\nKids are still being called names\nThe classics were\nHey stupid\nHey spaz\nSeems like each school has an arsenal of names\nGetting updated every year\nAnd if a kid breaks in a school\nAnd no one around chooses to hear\nDo they make a sound?\nAre they just the background noise\nOf a soundtrack stuck on repeat\nWhen people say things like\nKids can be cruel?\nEvery school was a big top circus tent\nAnd the pecking order went\nFrom acrobats to lion tamers\nFrom clowns to carnies\nAll of these were miles ahead of who we were\nWe were freaks\nLobster claw boys and bearded ladies\nOddities\nJuggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle\nTrying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal\nBut at night\nWhile the others slept\nWe kept walking the tightrope\nIt was practice\nAnd yes\nSome of us fell\n\nBut I want to tell them\nThat all of this\nIs just debris\nLeftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought\nWe used to be\nAnd if you can\u2019t see anything beautiful about yourself\nGet a better mirror\nLook a little closer\nStare a little longer\nBecause there\u2019s something inside you\nThat made you keep trying\nDespite everyone who told you to quit\nYou built a cast around your broken heart\nAnd signed it yourself\nYou signed it\n\u201cThey were wrong\u201d\nBecause maybe you didn\u2019t belong to a group or a clique\nMaybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything\nMaybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth\nTo show and tell but never told\nBecause how can you hold your ground\nIf everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it\nYou have to believe that they were wrong\n\nThey have to be wrong\n\nWhy else would we still be here?\nWe grew up learning to cheer on the underdog\nBecause we see ourselves in them\nWe stem from a root planted in the belief\nThat we are not what we were called\nWe are not abandoned cars stalled out and\nSitting empty on a highway\nAnd if in some way we are\nDon\u2019t worry\nWe only got out to walk and get gas\nWe are graduating members from the class of We Made It\nNot the faded echoes of voices crying out\nNames will never hurt me\n\nOf course\nThey did\n\nBut our lives will only ever always\nContinue to be\nA balancing act\nThat has less to do with pain\nAnd more to do with beauty\n-Shane Koyzcan\ufeff",

I've never \nbeen bullied, or ever called a name to my face, nor have I ever heard \nsomeone say something bad about me. But there is this guy I used to like \nfor 3 years, and him and his friend laugh at me sometimes during class. So \nthat really hurt me, because that isn't even physical or mental bullying \nbut It feels so bad! When names are focused on one person I believe that is \nwrong. \nWhat I mean is that me and my friend (she's way popular and goes to \ndifferent school) we sometimes will make fun of peoples clothes but we \nwould move on to a next person. I don't think that's wrong. Because If \nsomeone did that to me, I realize that makes them happy, so you shouldn't \ncare so much about one word said about you, but when it's totally focused \non you ALL THE TIME, it's different.\ufeff",

I \ncan't watch gymnastics in the summer and figure skating in winter. It \nreminds me of what I could have been, and what I gave up on. \n\nJust so people know I have moved on. I wasn't flexible because I was \nmuscular. I used my muscles and became an athlete. Soccer, basketball, \ntrack, swimming, and snowboarding. I used my inflexibility to realise that \nI didn't care about being flexible any more. I cared about sports, it gave \nme friends. I wasn't the girl who took gymnastics anymore.\n\nThis all seems incredibly happy, it isn't. I was still bullied, bullied for \nmy \"fat legs\". I was bullied because I got over one thing, moved on, and \nthen became to comfortable. I was getting to muscular. The one thing I \nembraced about myself was getting me into trouble. \n\nFor everyone getting bullied, I found a release in sports, you find your \nrelease. Then, grow your wings and take off.

I used to cut because i spent so much time feeling \nsorry for myself. I was playing the victim. & I think bullying is taken yo \nharshly. You cant criticize anyone without being a bully.

Its all about survival of the fittest. But I do think its unfair \nto say depression is only a figment of imagination. I think for alot of \npeople it is. Not every teenager now in days can be chemically depressed. \nBut it is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Chemicak depression is when \nyou lack Serotonin, which is a nuerotransmitter that effects a ton of \nthings within you. Your mood, your perceptiob on pain, even body movements \nlike twitches & tremours. So though I agree with you on alot of what you \nsaid it is unfair to say all depression is psychological.

(start of small find \none thing about yourself and focus on that then find something else the \nnext day etc. it's silly but it helps).",

It felt worse at \nthe time. Thousands of cuss words and swears flying all around me, \nsometimes directed at me, when I didn't realize that they were trying to be \nfriendly.

He was \ncalled weird, so I ended up hanging out with him due to people beating him \nall the time, even at home. Being yelled at for no reason, I was the \nsame... My biological dad always hit me, when my parents got a divorce I \nwas still in pain. I used to spend weeks at a time with my friend at his \nhouse. He would get yelled at for no reason... No one cared about him, no \none wanted to help him... Except me... I would beat people up, it's why I \nhate ships. My life is terrible, I can't even trust my grandparents, they \ncall the cops on my mom for no reason, and now they want her to go to rehab \nfor 3 months when she doesn't even need it. If some people that get their \nphones taken away and say their life is bad, fuck, have I got a story for \nthem. I lost my friend in 5th grade, it still hurts me to this day. I never \neven got to say goodbye... Not even get to say, \"I'll never forget you...\" \nThis is why I hate everything. I was often called \"Shark Girl\" because I \nbeat up all the other people that teased me and him. People don't \nunderstand, I haven't told many of my friends this. People don't really \nconsider me like a person to be scared of, they think that because I have \nsuch a messed up life, they're better... If they came to my house, their \nhead would be at the end of my katana. (Yes I seriously own a katana)",

For the first year of my \nlife, my family thought I wasn't going to make it because had to go to the \nhospital daily. When I was 5, I started school. I was quiet, and these kids \nused to bully me because I stuttered. They'd say I stutter because I was \nnever supposed to be born, and god didn't want me to tainte anybody's minds \nso he stopped me from talking so clearly. By age six I believed if I died \nit would be okay, because my family and friends would move on. Now, at 15, \nI don't think of myself as pretty. My friends say I weigh \"5 pounds\" \nbecause I was born premature and I'm very small. My friends say I'm ugly \neven when I'm a model. My friends call me stupid and worthless because of \nmy ADHD. My parents and siblings think I have problems because I lock \nmyself in my room. They think I'm depressed, and they're right. My \nboyfriend dumped me for the girl who tells me I'm worthless and claims to \nbe my friend.  I say \"like\" and click my tongue to stop myself from \nstuttering, and people make fun of it. I try to be nice and outgoing but \npeople think I'm annoying. My IQ is well over the american female average. \nI have A's in all of my classes, but I feel like I'm worthless. I tell my \nfriends that I'm sad and they say that have way bigger problems and mine \naren't  valid because they're \"going through worse\". Today my older sister \ntold me I was a mistake, and I need to go to a mental ward. My mom said I \nhave problems. My friends said I'm \"too pretty and skinny to be depressed\". \nMy friend said she could kick my ass and I'm as strong as a 2 year old, \neven though I practice Muay Thai and have mastered lots of moves. My \nfriends said I have \"no butt\" and I'm \"as flat as Taylor Swift\" because I \nweight 100ish pounds at 15. That's not my fault, I like to excersise and \nI'm just not hungry every 10 minutes. Today a boy said my nose, which I \nbroke and can't afford the plastic surgery to make my nose perfect again, \nlooks like a penis and I'm pinocchio, and my friend liked the comment. \ufeff",

Those 'Friends' you have shouldn't be in your life if they \nare going to treat you that way. Because let me tell you something. I may \nhave never EVER met you before, but I know you are perfect, even if you \nhave flaws, you are perfect. Not being skinny or pretty make you perfect, \nbut being real and staying true to who you know you are, deep inside. A \nhappy person, who is capable of shutting all those mean things out, not \nletting them bother you. And let me tell you something else. If your \nboyfriend dumped you for one of your bullies, then he isn't worth being \nupset over. One day, you will find a guy who loves every. single. thing. \nabout you, and you will feel the same way. And some day, you will have \nfriends who are really more of your brothers and sisters than friends, and \nwho would sacrifice their own lives for you. You just have to hang in \nthere, and believe it. You have to be patient, but it will happen. You are \nperfect, beautiful, nice, kind, everything about you is amazing, okay? So \ndon't you EVER believe them I have lost a few family members to suicide \nbecause of people making them feel insecure, and its not worth giving up \nyour life. And your sister? If she said you were a mistake, she jealous. \nJealous that you are brave enough to walk through the school halls and LIFE \neveryday. And rightfully so, at that. And if she wants to make you feel \nbad, just let it go. She is your sister, and sisters are also meant to be \nmean, but deep down inside, they love you more than anything. I was \nbullied. Kids chased me in the playground when I was six saying \"time to \ntake out the trash!\" and other things. It got so bad I didn't want to go to \nschool, and refused to get ready. Though the years, I have realized \nsomething. These bullies, they aren't gonna mean a thing to you when your \nolder. That your going to go on to do great things, and they won't be there \nto stop you. So just take one thing from this: You are a perfect, beautiful \nhuman being, even WITH whatever flaws you think you have. \n\n-Kaitlyn",

I am the same age as you and i also got \nteased because of my size i got called fat, ugly, slut, whore, and the \nworst thing is, is that i was also called fat and ugly by my family my \ncousins, my uncle, i was also called Emo by my older brother because i cut \n\"i hate living\" into my arm. i couldn't even count how many time my \n\"friends\" sent me away because of this other girl who said that they \ncouldn't hang out with her because i was there. so I know how you feel. I \nalso watched this at my school and i started crying and had to go out of \nthe room. There were also kids laughing at this video and they stopped when \nthey saw me leave the room cause they realized it wasn't funny. They \nrealized that people actually went through this. They realized that I went \nthrough this and my new friends told me all of this. By the way if your \nfriends call you worthless then you need to not have them as your friends \ncause if they call you mean and nasty names then they aren't True friends \ncause i know that true friends would never call you worthless they would \ntell you that you aren't worthless when someone else tells you that you are \nand i will also be your friend we may not know each other but i know what \nyou are going through. I love you for who you are and you should do the \nsame <3 <3 <3",

I realize \nsocializing can be hard but as silly as this may sound try to talk to \nyourself privately and maybe practice calmly on how you would like to \nexpress or convey your ideas.\nThis is all can do as this is the internet which is just full of words and \npictures I hope this had some help and if not sorry. Hopefully other people \ncould be better at helping you. ",

My family never ate dinner together my \nfather always drinking or smoking he would probably let me die over beer if \nhe had the option, my mother always working. I wanted to meet people so bad \nand go out in life and be free rather than a caged bird. To this day I am \nstill alone but I try to strive.\nNow enough of my crap. I want to know why do you have this perception to \nmake no attempt or what misery you are speaking of If you do not mind me \nasking. You are yourself and there is no possible way I can reach out and \nmagically help you, so therefore you sadly have to help yourself. Only you \ncan be independent and strong for your own self interests so stand up. I \napologize for any annoyance or anger I have caused you and hope things \ncould get better for you. ",

                "text": "This video. I remember watching it a little while ago during an anti \nbullying assembly. I've always been small, small enough that I was never \nable to do anything about being bullied. The names the physical abuse and \neven the flat out intimidation thrown at me from other people was enormous. \nI couldn't help bursting into tears at the end of it and had to skip last \nclass so no one thought anything was wrong. The part with the boy always \nbeing picked last hits me hard because no matter what bullying was the \nworst during gym. It\"s always apart of the game but it never really is. \nWhether is was getting slammed into the ground by someone who wanted to \npass you or getting picked up and tossed into a wall because you didn't \ncatch something, it never stopped hurting. Even the words haunt me. Along \nwith being small I am quite thin. They called me anorexic starving and bone \nboy, to make matters worse I have dress in mainly black and eat alone \neveryday to the fact that I have no friends. All of these factors came \ntogether to give me the Nickname Mr. Emo. My bruises and scrapes heal but I \ncarry around those words wherever I go. I pour my heart out into everyone I \nmeet but no one ever stays long enough to see what I see. Today I even had \na girl come over to me and say \"suck it up bruises heal\". Sticks and stones \nmay break my fucking bones but the scars words leave last forever. Thanks \nfor listening guys sorry if I wasted your time.\ufeff",

And that blanket statements work about as well as a \nmatch in the vacuum of space. Here's an example; all black people call \ntheir friends \"nigga\" and hate white people. That's obviously wrong, since \nnot every person with African descent does that. The same can be said for \nyour little statement. Not everyone is you; everyone you know is different \nfrom you, and so is everyone they know. People have different emotions and \ndifferent chemical make-ups, meaning that while you're sitting here being \ninsensitive and idiotic, someone you hang out with could very well be on \nthe verge of suicide or on the verge of murdering their family. Sure, you \ncan dismiss that as mental illness, but not everyone is suffering from \nissues because of illness. Plus, illnesses like depression can crop up from \na variety of reasons and are harder to cure than simply saying \"get over \nit.\"\nAlso, if you're implying that humans are in any way like other animals, \nyou're wrong there as well. We are animals, yes, but we're not like them. \nWe're capable of shaping our environment to better suit our needs. \nTherefore, we're all weak. So, by your logic, no human on this planet is \nstrong, so none of us deserve to be alive. We depend on other humans and \ntechnology; remember that. So, when one of us falls over and can't go on, \nyou're willing to further weaken an already weak species by killing off \nvital portions of what makes us strong? That makes about as much sense as \nHitler's hatred for Jews, and is very similar in many ways. You have no \nidea how it feels to be someone with depression, it's quite obvious; you've \nprobably got a very good or mediocre home life. Why not go ask your parents \nto start beating you and withholding food from you? Or maybe why not get \nrid of one parent? Or make one of them a drug addict? You'll be tooting a \ndifferent horn then, but why should we listen when you do? You'll be \"weak\" \nand you'll \"deserve to be shot.\"\nI'm just going to be frank with you; you need to open your mind and not be \na complete douchebag. Your the kind of person who gets shot because of \nsomething they say. Because you have no experience with depression, or with \nhelping prevent someone with depression from committing suicide, you have \nno place talking about it like you're an expert.\nPlease take any anger or rudeness on my behalf with a grain of salt; I'm \nnot angry at you, just at your ignorance. You're most likely an okay person \nto be around. And I also apologize if this comment came off long to you. I \ntend to type a lot.\nGood day, and try widening your perspective.",
