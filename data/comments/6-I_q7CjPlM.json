He's not even the same level as Calvin \nJohnson or Dez Bryant, much less a HOFer like Jerry Rice.\n\nSherman will always be known as an egotistical jerk. Just look at Sherman's \n\"24\" trash talking during the Super Bowl 2015.

Instead \nof being young and reckless through drunk driving after parties, he stays \nat home and studies his game and other plays. Just because you feel like \nyou accomplish more than someone else doesn't make you better. Richard \nSherman is also a genius with how he acts. he gets into people's heads. \nThat's the whole point. He doesn't do this just to be an ass. If he gets \ninto their heads, the stress they receive can cause them to blow the game \nwhile he makes big plays. I bet if he was transferred to the 49ers he would \nwork as a teammate should with Crabtree. This isn't peewee, no \"good game!\" \nbullshit. This is pro. In ALL pro sports, there is massive trash talk. \nIf you don't like it, you're not mentally prepared for your game. If you \ndon't want trash, you make the plays.

                    "text": "The name football as Americans use it is just an historical carry over. \nOriginally Rugby and \"football\" (AKA soccer) were the same sport played by \nschools in England. Players got tired of going to different schools and \nhaving to play by different house rules every time, so various schools sat \ndown in the mid 1800's to standardize the game. But when they were drafting \nrules they were split over how much hand contact should be allowed in the \ngame. So the first major split essentially created Football/Soccer where \nalmost no hand contact is allowed and Rugby Football where there's still a \nlot of plays done with your feet but hands can also be used. A more \nrugbyish style of football, brought across the Atlantic before the rules \nwere standardized, was popular in the US, especially at Harvard. The US \nwould go on to create its own set of standard rules for their version of \nrugby. A major difference between the English version of Rugby and the \nAmerican version was the idea of using a line of scrimmage and a snap-- \ngetting rid of the often messy \"scrum\" all together. To speed up the game, \n in 1982 the rules were changed again so that players had to move the ball \nat least 5 yards every three downs or the other team would be given the \nball (Today it's 10 yards every 4 downs). Essentially it created the \n\"gridiron\". So basically  by the time the 1900's rolled around there were \nseveral distinct versions-- Football, Rugby Football,  American Football, \nand even Canadian Football (which is similar to American football but there \nare differences). At first American football was pretty dangerous . In 1905 \nthe sport caused 19 deaths and President Roosevelt threatened to ban the \ngame. So, in order to not get banned, a lot of rules had to be implemented \nto make the game safer. For example, the rules were changed so that forward \npasses could be used,and players began to wear padding.  ",

Watch a Seahawks \ngame and watch how he behaves and acts on the field.  He isn't a thug, and \ni agree thats not the issue and its a word that people can say just because \nhes black and thats no the word i would use to describe him.  The best word \nwould be asshole.  He is an asshole on the field and thinks highly of \nhimself off the field, no matter what he does on the field, i wouldnt want \nto root for him",

Me, personally, I loved every second of it, but he was \nwrong there. His whole attack on Crabtree was for stuff that happened \nbefore the game and even during the offseason before any games were even \nplayed, when Crabtree said some things about him that he didn't like.",
