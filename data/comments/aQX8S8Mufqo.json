I \ncurrently use a Pinnacle Platinum plus rod and reel combo baitcaster and \nwith my 10lb test .30mm Spiderwire mono I cant cast far at all and its not \nsensitive so I cant feel any structure, so I want to switch to a more \nbaitcaster friendly line. And with braids thin diameter it seems like the \nway to go, but from what I've heard you need to go heavier test with braid \nwhich will give me a thicker diameter. And I've heard straight mono can \nhave bad memory problems. So as you can see I'm in a bit of a pickle. Any \nadvice you can give me will be greatly appreciated. I've been searching for \nanswer for weeks. Thank you!!",

Because most of your \nhooksets will be powerful in order to wrench the bass away from the cover, \nI think having that extra line-to-line knot gives drastically increases \nyour chances of breaking off. It's just one more potential \"failure point\" \nin this situation. I'd go with straight 16 to 20-pound fluorocarbon or \nstraight 50 to 65-pound braided line. Thanks for watching! ",

                "text": "Thanks Walker, great info. Just curious, why do you recommend a 7' rod for \nshorter people, and 7'6 for tall people. Seems like short people would need \nthe extra advantage of a longer rod. A lot of guys go with 20-25lb \nfluorocarbon and7'6- 8' rods for the extra security and power when horsing \nout big fish from the thick stuff. \n\nAlso, how do you feel about using snell knots on a flipping hook? The hook \ngets better penetration compared to an EWG. I think the only advantage of \nEWG is you're basically guaranteed weedless. Hook point of a flipping hook \nwill come out once in a while. \n-Zach\ufeff",
