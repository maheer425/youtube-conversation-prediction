If half his supporters (25,000 of \nthem) marked Candidate D as their 2nd choice, 5,000 votes (half the \nsurplus) have to be transferred to Candidate D.\n\nThere are two ways of doing this:\n\nOne is pick 5,000 of the 25,000 votes at random.  This is fair in a rough \nand ready way and will usually be reasonably fair if enough people have \nvoted.\n\nThe other is to transfer all the 25,000 votes (for which D was 2nd choice) \nat a fraction of their value.  In this case, it is calculated as 25,000 \ndivided by 5,000; i.e. 1/5th (20%).  This is more accurate.\n\nSome territories use one system and others use the other.",

                "text": "There are serious downsides to this system that maybe you could touch on in \nanother video. Namely that with the removal of electoral districts it will \nbe harder for a single candidate to reach out to voters without larger \ncampaign funding. Trying to get elected from a district of 500 voters is \nfar easier and less expensive then trying to get elected from a district \nwith 500,000. What ends up happening is that the three candidates with the \nlargest political war chest will end up in the congress (in the absence of \npersonal familiarity with a candidate, voters will default to faux \nfamiliarity which is achieved through things like media and advertising), \nand those without the proper campaign financing will once again fall by the \nwayside. What we have with American democracy is a congress that is \nincredibly skilled at fundraising.\n\nFundraising is a valuable skill and requires many talents that people find \nmeritorious, like leadership, public speaking, persuasion, drive, \ndiscipline and organizational ability, and the people and groups who give \nmoney to a candidate believe that that candidate can win and govern \neffectively. The question is whether we believe that the same skills used \nin fundraising are the same skills that make an effective legislator. If \nso, then the system we have in place is adequate. If not, then the solution \nis to eliminate the necessity of creating faux familiarity and force \ncandidates to focus their efforts on voters who are not politically \nmobilized.\n\nThe average citizen's level of political mobilization ends with party \naffiliation. Most are not involved in other interest groups, whether they \nbe grass roots organizations like home owners associations, private \npolitical blocs like big business lobbies, or other political organizations \nwho can mobilize votes like public or private unions. The way to break the \nhold of these organizations (if that is your intent), is to make voting \ndistricts smaller, not larger. With smaller districts, less money is needed \nby candidates to familiarize themselves with the public, which means that \nthey are more free to make policy which benefits the general, \nnon-politically organized public, as opposed to special interest groups who \nfinance their candidacies and by such hold their loyalty which may be \nopposed to the will of the people. Smaller districts increase the power of \nthe individual vote and therefore increase the level of direct \nrepresentation and voter accountability in the congress. \n\nBy creating smaller districts, we also increase the size of the congress, \nwhich will further dilute the power of any power group within it, creating \na much more representative and democratic legislature whose individual \nmembers are beholden to their smaller and more responsive districts. \ufeff",

In these instances, there would be no \"cutoff \npoint\" -- rather, a mini election would be performed within that range to \ndecide where the excess goes. In a way, everyone in that range would \nreceive a second vote of sorts -- but the power of that second vote would \nbe in proportion to the range as a whole. \n\nLet's say we have 100 voters just to keep the percentages clean. The \nchoices are A, B, C, and D; they receive 60%, 5%. 30%, and 5%. A only needs \n33%, so is left with an excess 27% to distribute. As a whole, they voted \n66% for B, 30% for C, and 4% for D (which amounts to ~+18% for B, ~8% for \nC, and ~1% for D. The math isn't absolutely correct, I know -- but this is \njust an example). So, after the excess runs off, you end up with 23% for B, \n38% for C, and 6% for D. At this point, the runoffs get a little messy in \nthis example, but you might have the general idea. I think the core problem \nwith this system is that, dammit, the runoffs are somewhat volatile and \nimpossible to predict with much certainty -- but at the end of all the \nmathing you should end up with 3 winners at 33% with the 1% excess error.\n\nI may have to play with this using far larger numbers, just to see how it \nbehaves.

Nothing has actually changed, we are all still the same \ndamn dirty apes but the belief in our society and our legal system frees us \nfrom ourselves.\n\nNow if i'm right you don't need an actual anarchical state to see it's \neffects, all you need is a lack of trust in the framework... So pick a \nghetto, any ghetto :-) there you will find a child who's educators of the \nframework are an absent father and a school with metal detectors on the \ndoors, He listens to music that says the police are out to get him, he \nwatches films where cops are always crooked, then views media sources who \nonly print confirmations of that idea and he looks at his government and no \none seems to represent him. These kids grow up with no trust in the \npolitical framework and so every time they encounter each other they have \nno choice but to behave like humans. Then the rest of society names it gang \nculture to convince themselves it's something new and separate from them.\n\nMy political views would be described as Libertarian by most, I am all for \nsmall government and personal liberty but we have to accept that we all \nhave parts of ourselves that we don't grant these liberties to, i can \neasily think of a man whom i recently wanted to punch but i logically \nconcluded that a more inhumane response would be a better choice, and so \nour society should reflect this. So if only to provide a legal comfort \nblanket, some form of government is an essential part of a successful \ncivilisation",

Then, because the major \nparties want to put each other as low as possible, and minor parties make \ndeals with each other in a structured way, you end up with candidates being \nelected from very fringe groups with 0.5% of the vote (when the quota is \n16%.) \n\nAlthough the problem is more with the fact that you have to number all \ncandidates. If you could only number as far as you were interested, that \nwould fix the system, although Australia has compulsory voting.

I see how it could be used for the Local Electorates but I am \nunsure if it could be used easily for the party votes as well...\nLike, first the electorate seats would be determined using STV. Then the \nlist seats are determined and parties are awarded as many seats as they \nautomatically qualify for, for example if you need 1% for a seat and a \nparty gets 29.84% of the vote it qualifies for 29 seats with .84% \nremaining. Then the remaining votes that aren't high enough to qualify for \na seat get redistributed like in STV where whoever is furthest away from a \nnew seat is redistributed.

I guess, as wrong \nas I know I am for this, I like to think of anyone with an electorate more \nas an independent who just happens to share opinions with a party rather \nthan a representative of the party itself who will vote as told to.\nI think the good thing about MMP is that you can vote for a local \nrepresentative you agree with on some local issues, which may be very \nimportant to be voiced, but not on the macro/party sort of issues and you \nuse your party vote for that instead.

Under FPTP, C would win even though you've just upset \nthe majority of the population. Under Schulze, however, B won the election \neven though only 2 people voted for them as the top choice. This might seem \nbad at first giving a minority rule, but looking at how everybody else \nvoted, it's actually a great compromise that made 2 people really happy, \nand 11 people content with the compromise, instead of making half the \npopulation upset with either candidate A or C.

THis allows e to get 7 secondary votes.\n\n \n\nThis puts him at 11 votes, higher than d(who does not have\nany 2nd votes from A). E is not eliminated.\n\n \n\nFor the situation least favorable to e, only 5 of the 40 1st\nvoters have 2nd votes for E, all 5 voter who had 2nd votes for D voted for \nA.\nThis puts the number of 2nd votes for D to 1(rounding up), The number of 2nd\nvotes for E is 1(rounding up again). D has a total of 7 votes, E with 5 \nvotes\nis eliminated.\n\n \n\nHowever, this is considering the Hare method. The Droop\nmethod is the one used by most real life systems.\n\nIf we consider the droop method, where threshold is\n(100/(3+1))+1 = 26, and applying the same situation,\n\n \n\nIn the first case, E(4+9=13), D(6+1=7), E is not eliminated\nfirst\n\nIn the second case, E(4+14=18), D(6+0=6), E is not\neliminated.\n\nIt becomes tricky for the last one.\n\n \n\nWhile D does get 2 votes, so does E. Moreover, B and C get 5\nvotes each. B, with (30+5) votes has all of his extra votes go to E. E gets\nanother 9 votes, totalling 15 votes. E is not eliminated.\n\n Thus using the droop method, there is no way that candidate E would be the \nfirst candidate eliminated. \n\nNote:\n\nI did not consider the 3rd votes as \n\n1) They don't matter for the first elimination \n\n2) E cannot have 90 3rd votes, given that he has 55 2nd\nvotes (A voter can't place both 2nd and 3rd votes for the same candidate)",

If you can't \ncobble up 50%+1 in congress (parliament) from 2 or more parties, then it is \ndead-lock.\n2) Small parties wield incredible power.  Party A = 48%, Party B = 47%, \nParty C = 5%. Party C now calls the shots as kingmaker, holding the other \n95% hostage to Party C's demands.\n\nNot saying STV is any worse than FPTP per se, but just pointing out that \nevery system has its own flaws  :) \ufeff",

In recent years, the Australian \npolitical climate has stopped being a system of to major parties with a \ncouple of minor parties to hold the balance of power. Now, there are many \nmicro-parties that run in these elections, each representing a niche \ninterest and each with a tiny percent of the vote. For example, in the 2014 \nWestern Australian Senate Election, there were 57 registered political \nparties, most of whom fielded a couple of Senator candidates in the \nelection. \n\nMoreover, since our system allows us to vote 'above the line' for a certain \nparty, with the flow of preference being decided by the party itself, \npreference deals played a huge part in eventually getting people elected. \nFor example, the sixth Senator elected in Victoria was a man named Ricky \nMuir from the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party. Despite getting only \n0.51% of the vote, the preference flow of all these micro-parties who made \ndeals with one another meant that one of them was bound to be elected.\n\nAt the moment, the Australian Senate is a mess, with 9 different parties \nbeing represented, and no party being able to hold a majority without the \nsupport of some minors. And while I recognise the importance of accurate \nrepresentation, I don't think one sixth of Victorians identify as a \nmotoring enthusiast.\ufeff",
