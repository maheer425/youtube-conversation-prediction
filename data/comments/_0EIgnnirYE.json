Last time I checked, marriage was ordained \nby The Most High, not the court. Name one person in the Bible who had a \nmarriage license, or acquired permission from the court (or even a priest) \nto get married. As a matter of fact, do a google search on the origins of \nthe marriage license. Sadly, there's nothing Christian about it whatsoever. \nEducate yourself on these things before you go judging people. May The Most \nHigh bless you.",

Boo I am happy with you but I need a piece of paper so let's make a \nlaw that says you get 1 piece of paper with every binding relationship. Na \na. Why would people get married if it was just for a piece of paper because \nsweetheart I have like 1000 pieces of paper on which you can write: \"I love \n....\" . It still isn't a marriage. Why don't you first look it up and then \ntell me again. \nPS: I sometimes come of as rude when I am in one of those moods but don't \ntake it personally because I'm just a little bitchy sometimes.",
