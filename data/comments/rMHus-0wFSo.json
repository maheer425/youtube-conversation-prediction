There are many parts of sleep that are not understood \nsuch as why the brain is so active at night (especially relevant if you \nconsider sleep as a method for energy conservation), why the white blood \ncell count decreases with lack of sleep and why hormone abnormalities \n(often leading to depression) develop with lack of sleep.

And then I can feel my bed floating and on the \ncloset in front of me I saw a 2-feet creature, he's dark and have skin like \ntree barks.\n\nIt still happen to me this days but not that much anymore. Here's my tip:\n\nOnly these parts of your body that can be moved during sleep paralysis, \nit's your big toes! Try to move it as much as possible then eventually \nyou'll be fully awaken!\n\nYou better fight the urge to sleep once you feel you are entering that \nsleep paralysis first stage. Well, it's like the feeling of something \nchaotic is taking place in your environment but you know that you are half \nawake, but you are just to sleepy to wake up fully. It'll be kind of hard, \nbut you need to coz if not, the next stage, you can't move your body \nanymore..\n\nIf ever you are fully awaken from sleep paralysis, try to change the \nposition of your sleep, maybe try exchanging your head-foot position, etc.\n\nFor me, sleep paralysis triggers whenever I'm stressed like really, really \nfatigue and lack of sleep, or something like I try to stay awake 3 or 4 am \neven though I am very, very sleepy..\n\nHope this helps a little :)",

I was doing random \nthings so I was just shooting fire at a wheel on a cart and it was \nspinning, so I said, \"Look, the wheel is spinning\" and at that exact moment \nis when I new that I've experienced this before, even if it was in a dream, \nI did. And I knew exactly what my father was going to say, I could have \ntaken the words out of his mouth, he said, \"The /burning/ wheel is \nspinning\" because apparently it was still on fire or something but anyways, \nI totally get what you mean, and I've had a few more that were places as \nwell, like dreaming of a gas station and seeing it built a couple months \nlater its pretty cool but pretty freaky.\nThis also isn't only psychology and our dreams and the way they work but \nthe science of space and time because time really isn't as linear and \nstrict as we think (it really is a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey \nstuff) and in space time we can see an event at different times, and they \nhappen at different times so its totally plausible to see a certain event \nbefore it actually happens, and even though there are different theories of \ndeja vu, I believe it is correlated to that mostly, because everything in \nspace time is, was and always will be, even if it hasn't happened to us \nyet, it has still happened, everything we've done and will do already \nhappened at some point, past, present, and future as well.\nSorry for the big speel, I'm just happy to find someone who has the same \nthing happen to them ^-^",

I can't move at \nall and I see it coming closer even though its gliding I hear loud thuds \nlike steps, the atmosphere is mostly in the dark but with an impossible \nlighting of greyish and small shimmering lights. I could only slightly turn \nmy head but each time I did that it would cut closer. One time in a dream I \nwas in my bed completely frozen a to the right corner (like something out \nof sight but clearly in view) of my vision that tall silhouette stood \nlooming over me but instead of teeth I saw white (mostly greyish) circular \neyes that got hazy on the rim and when I say white I mean like you could \nsee though into another room but its eyes were 2D, I'd wake up cursing, in \na cold sweat. And I'm quite nervous cause lately in my dreams I've been \nable to spot it coming closer, in a crowed, corners, end hallways- but now \nand I'm gonna sound psycho but I've recently been seeing it out of my \ndreams for a split second.

Or it \ncould represent someone you know who would fit that description not \nphysically but more personality wise, actually it could mean a problem will \noccur in the future, a person, something that happened in the past maybe \nthat's why it's reoccurring??...

In my nightmare, I \nwould awaken still in a pitch black bedroom with only a glimmer of dull \ngrey light through my curtains (just above me on the wall to my immediate \nright, my bed pushed up against it). I would be paralyzed and hear a quiet \nfootstep (I knew it was on the stairs), a long period of time would elapse \nand I'd hear a slightly louder footstep. Gradually, the footsteps would \nbecome louder and louder, and the time between them would become shorter \nand shorter until I felt a massively loud stampeding in my head and a huge, \nanthropomorphic silhouette would appear in my doorway and dash towards me \naiming it's outstretched fingers towards my throat. I'd wake up in a panic, \nand sometimes the nightmare would repeat. This nightmare disappeared for a \ndecade or so, yet when I lived on my own/with friends/with my girlfriend, I \nstarted to experience this terror again, however this time it was lucid \n(although me being in my family home in said apparition) and upon hearing \nthe first 'thud', I thought \"Fucking COME ON THEN!!!!\". I'd wait around in \nthe bed I slept in as a child until after seemingly a lifetime I'd hear \nthat second, louder thud. At this point I wanted to kill the silhouette \nthat haunted my childhood so I'd dash into the hallway. I'd be petrified at \nthis point, but insisted on turning the corner and running down the stairs \n- it was no longer just a black silhouette, but flashing white teeth. I'd \nrun full pelt towards my enemy determined to kill it, I remember imagining \nthat I'd punch, kick, bite, elbow and headbutt it, and I fucking did, but \nas soon as I felt in my dream that I was doing it damage, I'd wake up next \nto my girlfriend screaming like a psychopath! I've proof read this and it \nsounds like bollocks, but I promise you that this was my re-occurring \nnightmare. It still occasionally springs back to haunt me to this day, but \nwith the same result.  What the fuck is wrong with me? What does this mean?",

If your \nawakening is sudden and you instantly feel completely awake, then it is \nbecause of the surprise factor and adrenaline. Once the adrenaline wears \noff, your brain is usually active again. Anyways, useless science facts... \nYou should consult with a doctor or if you're a minor, talk to your parents \nabout it so they can talk with a doctor. But before you do that, try a \nmelatonin pill, which you or your parents can buy over-the-counter at \nnearly any pharmacy. To very basically sum up its effects: when you fall \nasleep, you stay asleep. Try different doses (start low and scale up) until \nit works, but don't overdose. If you get to an unnatural or dangerous \namount, THEN you should go talk to a doctor about what's happening. \nHopefully that helps! I might also suggest anti-anxiety prescriptions if \nbeing all wound up is a source for this insomnia. Another thing that might \nhelp would be meditation or just taking a breath and relaxing before you go \nto bed. Sleep well! ",

My current reasoning for this is exactly why you can't \nremember the sequence of colors in the Google logo, why you don't know the \nnumber of people that were in your 6th grade history class, and other such \nthings. Your brain hasn't prioritized it as something to remember. The \nneural connections are there, but just not easily stimulated (why you can't \neasily remember them).

Like \nHank said, Mike Birbiglia actually jumping through a window due to a \nnightmare is not very conducive towards your physical well-being.\nWhen you sleep, your body releases a chemical which essentially paralyzes \nall voluntary motor functions. You might twitch in bed here and there, but \nyou won't get up and run into a wall. That's the point of the paralyzing \nchemical.\nWaking up is a process, and when it begins, your body stops producing the \nparalyzing compound and your motor functions slowly returns.\nHowever, sometimes you can wake up while your body is still flooded with \nthe chemical. This is what causes you to be paralyzed while you're eyes are \nclearly open. This is also why it is hard to breath during the episode. The \nonly reason why you're breathing at all is because your brain can send \nautomatic signals to do so, but the sensation of not being able to control \nyour breath causes a panic. Slowly, the chemical wears off and motor \nfunction is restored!",

Then I reached for my \niPad and started texting people randomly and said rlly stupid things I \nregretted. Then, in a panic, I suddenly woke up (again) and did the exact \nsame thing. I couldn't figure out whether or not I was in reality or not. I \neventually woke up (shivering, and my mind weirdly buzzing), I reached for \nmy iPad to check if I had actually texted anyone anything, it turns out I \nhadn't. I was so sleep deprived and overtired I fell right back to sleep. \nThe weird thing was that the second I fell asleep I got another dream that \nI reached for my iPad and did the same things. I kept waking up, checking, \nand falling back to sleep. Eventually, my stomach grew sick and I jumped \nout bed, shivering, and weirdly off put.\n\nThat whole experience took me like a week to recover from, it was sooooo \nscary and odd. Comment if you think you know what happened, cuz I sure as \nhell don't.\ufeff",
