However, \nthe texture was really weird, idk how to describe it, it's like rough?? Not \ncreamy smooth. Used heavy whipping cream and for the condensed milk I used \na LOT  less than what was required because it was too sweet. Everything \nturned out beautifully and my cream was whipping. It seems like it was only \nafter I added the vanilla extract did the mixture turn from solid smooth \ncream to a rough grainy texture, Its soft ice cream but not smooth at all. \nFreezing it doesnt change it. Any idea why? Other than that I made a \ncookies and cream version-heavenly. Delicious. Thank you. ",

Add a 1/4 cup of ice cream base to 3oz of COOLED melted chocolate. \nmix together fast, then add another 1/4 cup ice cream base and continue to \nmix fast. Now that the mix is looser and you have 'introduced' the \nchocolate mix in 1 1/2  Cups of ice cream base. To this add in your bits, \ntoasted nuts and marshmallows. (don't judge but I used marshmallow fluff in \nmy s'more ice cream so it scooped really well and it rippled through the \nice cream. I hope this is not too confusing. Happy baking!",

The thing with the mango puree is that it \nfreezes solid so when you add it to your base it can freeze your base like \nthat. I added sugar in the video to stop this from happening. You can try \nit again and maybe add more mango mixed with sugar  to your base.\nThe best way to enjoy this ice cream base is to mix it with the bigger \nflavors, like cookies, cake, honeycomb. The sugar in those stop it freezing \nrock hard. Also have you seen the holiday ice creams I \nmade @gemsholidayicecream . I make the ice cream base in this video again \nand I tried to show it in more detail. \nTry it again, You got this! :)",

I know it seems weird but \nit really is like an awesome homemade ice cream. The best results come the \nthicker flavors, like cookies and cream so I suggest you try that one first \nand you will see how great it is :). Did that help?",

I have a lot of viewers in the Middle \nEast and I know the flavors are so different. If you have an idea for a \nflavor just add it to the plain base and taste, should be great. ",

Heat it until it is about to simmer then turn off. let it \nsit and the flavor infuse into the condensed milk. (MAYBE 30 MINUTES, MAYBE \nLONGER) Then strain out the leaves and let the condensed milk go cold. you \ncan do this step the day before. I hope you get enough flavor. I think you \nwill. Don't use too much green tea or the flavor might be bitter. Hope this \nhelps :)",

The condensed milk stops the cream from \ncrystalizing because it is laced with sugar. So you have a scoopable cream. \nbest thing, it doesn't take like condensed milk or too much cream. Add your \ncookies, cakes, candy etc and you are looking at one yummy ice cream :)",

It means to mix in one ingredients of different temp and \ntexture into another. heres how to add ice-cream. Add a 1/4 cup of ice \ncream base to 3oz of COOLED melted chocolate. mix together fast, then add \nanother 1/4 cup ice cream base and continue to mix fast. Now that the mix \nis looser and you have 'introduced' the chocolate mix in 1 1/2  Cups of ice \ncream base. When you freeze the ice cream now it should freeze hard but not \nrock hard and will be scoop able. Too much chocolate will make it hard to \nscoop. Also about not using cocoa, cocoa is used in some recipes as a \nreplacement for chocolate, it is not right and you are right not to do it \n:). Does the above method make sense?",

However if you want to eat \nit at its best then eat within 7 days. But honestly I keep it frozen for \nweeks \n2, I wonder are you describing 'Evaporated milk' and not condensed milk. \nEvaporated is like milk like what you said. Any condensed milk I have used \nhas been the same as what you see in the video. It is thick like a caramel \nbecause it is sugar and milk boiled. You can not substitute evaporated milk \nfor condensed milk as they don't do the same job. If you want, you can \neasily make your own. There are videos online. In tomorrows video I do show \nyou have to make a dairy free condensed milk so you can watch that method \nusing regular milk and sugar :). I hope this helps ",

I'm going to remake it again, and even though I did it wrong \nmy ice cream was still great. I divided the base into two containers and \nadded crushed Sneakers to one and left the other plain. I haven't tried the \nplain one, but the Snickers one was delicious!!! If it's this good when I \nscrew it up I can't wait to try it doing it correctly. Thank you so much \nfor all these wonderful videos and for responding to my comment made when I \nwas panicking!!!!",

You landed on a great one because it is my most popular. \nI can absolutely do edible cookie dough. I'll add it to my list and let you \nknow when I get around to it :). For real peppermint ice cream you take an \nextra step. You can put fresh mint into your condensed milk and heat it  to \ninfuse the milk. Leave it sit and go cold. When cold take put the mint and \nthen make the ice cream like normal. The after you make the base drizzle in \ncooled melted  chocolate  and stir. it hardens as it hits the ice cream and \nit creates texture and crunch. Hope this makes sense :)",
