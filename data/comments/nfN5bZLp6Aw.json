Anyone else thinks so? No racism here, don't get \nme wrong. However, I'd love to go to that deserted island Poveglia, near \nVenice. Altough, I'm wondering why they locked down the island instead of \nrebuilding it. It would make a nice spot for a hotel. Maybe with an \nadditional rent-a-boat-offer. They'd earn a lot of tourists' money. Closing \nit down just strengthens that whole haunted-island-thing :D\ufeff",

The continued \nsecurity is supposedly intended to keep the economy from collapsing.  Other \nconspiracy theories state that the gold is gone, but other priceless \nartifacts remain. Some speculate that dead alien bodies and UFOs sit inside \nthe vault.  Speaking of UFOs, another Fort Knox conspiracy rests on the \nreputation of Lt. Col. Philip Corso.  He wrote a book about the Roswell \nincident being real.  Many believe the alien technology is being stored \ninside of Fort Knox.  Top secret shipments transferred from Area 51 to Fort \nKnox add fuel to the conspiracy. Another famous alien connection about Fort \nKnox is called the Mantell UFO Incident of 1948.  The Kentucky Air National \nGuard  sent out three pilots to check out a report of an unusual aerial \nobject flying above Maysville, Kentucky.  One of the pilots, Thomas \nMantell, found the object which was reported as being bright white and \nround with a red border at the bottom.  The object supposedly made its way \nover Fort Knox.  All this comes under the banner of *Conspiracy Theories* \nbecause *nobody, including yourself, actually knows!*",

I went there for her school \nprom(first prom they had there). Her parents paid (score!) for the both of \nus. $150 per person was the fee for us to go. Her private school had a hook \nup I guess. I had heard about Club 33 years before and when she asked me I \nwas speechless and said YES of course! So when we went it was so awesome! \nAll dressed up, we waited as a group in front of Disneyland till employees \nescorted us into the park. They walked us down main street as everyone \nstared at us wondering why we were all dressed up...(we felt like \ncelebrities as guests were staring and taking photos as we walked by) We \nfinally get to THE door and had to wait and take some photos then when went \nin and oh my was I shaking with happiness and excitement. It was \nawesome...We danced and had the night of our lives...oh and the gourmet \nbuffet was so good! It was cool cause we were there after the park closed \nso we got to see the park at night basically empty as we were making out on \nthe deck. Much fun. Never forget. Thanks for reading.\ufeff",

But rival males often violently force themselves onto \nfemales.\n\nTo gain the edge in these conflicts, drakes have evolved large corkscrew \nphalluses, lined with ridges and backward-pointing spines, which allow them \nto deposit their sperm further into a female than their rivals.\n\nThese extreme penises are even more unusual when you consider that 97% of \nbird species lack any penises whatsoever.But female ducks have developed \ncountermeasures.\n\nTheir vaginas are equally long and twisting, lined with dead-end pockets \nand spirals that curve in the opposite direction.\n\nThey are organic chastity belts, evolved to limit the effectiveness of the \nmales\u2019 lengthy genitals\n\n\nRead more at \nhttp://sex.omgfacts.com/Sex+Facts/Female-ducks-vaginas-are-meant-to-confus/59002#LoWd3USijFFOTzlx.99",

But until you've lived \nmy life, it is unfair for you to assume that there's an easy explanation \nfor it. You haven't seen what I've seen, and you haven't experienced what I \nhave. Maybe if you did, you would think otherwise. But anyway, they *can* \nbe explained, but not with something stupid like \"aliens\". Considering the \nincidents I'm talking about, the belief that God is behind them makes \nperfect sense. But until you've experienced my life (Which, unfortunately, \nyou never will be able to) you'll never be able to see that it makes sense. \nThere's no way I can prove it to you, and I regret that. But I'm not going \nto stop believing because I know what I've seen. \n \n       And why do you say that believing God did it is a lazy answer? If \nit\u2019s the only thing that makes sense, then how is that just being \u201clazy\u201d? \nI\u2019m not talking about looking at some random thing I don\u2019t understand and \njust shrugging and declaring God magically makes it work. No. I have looked \nat all the possibilities, and I would be a fool to believe it was caused by \nsomething else. Saying God is behind it is the only thing that makes sense. \nI\u2019m not talking about a simple hoax from a parent or pastor, I\u2019m not \ntalking about something stupid like saying a random dream is proof of God \nor something, and I\u2019m not talking about something that has plenty of better \nanswers. You believe what you want to, but I *know* what I\u2019ve seen, and I \nknow I\u2019m not crazy or lying. Like I keep saying, unfortunately, there\u2019s no \nway to prove this to anyone else, so this discussion is probably pointless, \nbut if you could have seen what I\u2019m talking about, if you had been me, then \nI\u2019m sure you would have a different attitude about it\u2026.\n \n       Anyway, at the end, you said *\u201dif we can explain anything we know \ntoday it is thanks to scientists not God. \u201c* Now you\u2019re committing a \nfallacy. You\u2019re assuming God doesn\u2019t exist, and offering that as valid \nproof that everything scientists have found has nothing to do with Him. If \nGod exists, then of course He would have helped them or at least allowed \nthem to find what they\u2019ve found. Besides, even if God just left them alone \nand let them discover what they could, how does that invalidate His \nexistence? If He just created the world around them and let them loose like \na parent lets a little kid loose in a scavenger hunt to find what they \ncould find, that wouldn\u2019t be \u201cproof\u2019 for Him not existing\u2026 Now, let me ask \nyou something else. Have you been able to look at all the facts for every \ndiscovery? Have you been able to prove without a shadow of a doubt, and \nwith actual proof, not just personal assumptions, that God didn\u2019t \nintervene? I guess these are the main things I\u2019m trying to say here: That \nthe fact that you don\u2019t think God exists is not actual proof that He hasn\u2019t \nintervened in scientific discoveries. First you\u2019d have to be able to \ncompletely disprove Him and any other concept of a god, which is pretty \nmuch impossible. Then, even if He didn\u2019t intervene, it still doesn\u2019t mean \nHe doesn\u2019t exist. He could have just wanted people to find out what they \ncould on their own, kind of like with the analogy I gave about the little \nkid in the scavenger hunt.\n \n       Alright, sorry for rambling, but one last thing. At the beginning \nyou said *\u201dWe don't have prove that he exists, so he probably doesn't.\u201d* \nI\u2019m guessing that you made a typo here and meant to say \u201cWe don\u2019t have \nproof\u201d; instead of \u201cWe don\u2019t have prove\u201d. Anyway, I\u2019m just going to assume \nyou were trying to say proof, and make my points based off of that. If I \nmisunderstood, please correct me. Anyway, there is proof that God exists. \nAll you have to do is some research, and you\u2019ll find many things about the \nBible that really point to God. Case in point:\n\nhttp://www.alphanewsdaily.com/mathprophecy1.html\n\n       Another thing. Jesus Himself definitely existed, we have proof for \nthat. The question is, was He God or just a normal person? If you do more \nresearch on the matter, you\u2019ll see many more things in support that He was \nGod. If you look at the highly complex things around us in our world and \nUniverse, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s more likely for God to have created everything \nthen for it to have all come about by chance.",

For instance, someone could say it was \"government technology\" or \n\"aliens\" but that sounds a whole lot crazier (And is so unlikely it \nshouldn't even be considered a real possibility.) than the notion that God \nis behind them.

But since I, personally, know that I'm telling the \ntruth, and I know what I've seen, it gives me extra basis to believe in God.\n \n       EDIT: I just realized something else. The original point Drei was \ntalking about in explaining things was *about how everything must be \nexplainable to be considered science.* To which I replied by talking about \ndifferent things in science that couldn't be explained, to which you \nreplied by saying that everything could be explained eventually. Basically, \nit went like this. *Drei*) God isn't explainable, therefore does not = \nscience. *Me*) Some things in science aren't explainable but are still \nconsidered science. *You*) Everything can be explained eventually.\n\n       Okay, if everything can be explained eventually, who's to say God \ncan't be explained eventually? Therefore, you can't really say God isn't \n\"science\" because He's unexplainable, because you still consider those \nother things I mentioned science even though they can't be explained \neither. Therefore, that point is invalid. Just because we can't explain \nsomething yet or don't know how it works doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And \nbesides, if God exists, why is it so hard for you to believe He could break *His \nown laws?*\n       Therefore, it seems the debate shouldn't whether God can break His \nown laws, but does He exist or not?",

Of \ncourse, if you aren't acknowledging its existence at all, you wouldn't \nexpect it to be able to do anything, much less break any universal laws.\n\n       As for the thing about the miracles, I *have* tried to comprehend \nthem and see if there were any other explanations. I'm not talking about \nsome kind of \"simple hoax\". You said yourself I seemed intelligent. Don't \nyou think if some person tried to \"fake a miracle\" or something to keep me \nbelieving, I would have figured it out?

You said *\"The \nthing with science is that it is required by definition to be explainable.\"* \nThere are many things in science (That Atheists and Christians alike hold \nas fact) that cannot be explained, or have yet to be explained. Like what \nhappens beyond a black hole's horizon. Sure, you can hypothesize, but you \ncan't give a definite explanation. Or why light travels so fast. Or why (or \nhow) gravity pullls things in. Maybe some of the things I listed can be \nexplained, but even so, there are many things that aren't explainable, yet \nstill considered science. All you have to do is Google \"things that science \ncan't explain\" and a ton of articles will come up listing all of the things \nthat aren't explainable. Besides, most Atheists (The ones that don't even \nconsider the possibility of a god or God existing) consider the Big Bang's \nstart science, yet no one can explain what started it or how the \"point of \nsingularity\" got there in the first place. Now, please don't hear what I'm \nnot saying. I'm not trying to debate the validity of the Big Bang, I \nalready stated that I believe it. I'm just trying to point out that all \nit's aspects are not explainable, yet are still considered science.",

Earlier I was in a \ndebate about it, and the fellow I was debating with brought up 10 very \ninteresting, seemingly fool-proof points. After extensive research, I found \nanswers for pretty much all of them. If you'd like, maybe I could \ncopy/paste the discussion here or something.\n\n       Anyway, about the infinite mass thing, well, that's a bit harder to \nexplain. If it was really all powerful, it could bend the known laws of \nscience and the Universe and make itself not have infinite mass. Or, \nperhaps, since it would have created the entire Universe, perhaps it could \nexist outside of it, and use it's power to interact with the Universe's \ninhabitants. There are different possible explanations, but if a being was \nall powerful, surely there would be things we couldn't hope to understand \nabout it yet. Now, I will be honest about something. I have yet to \nthoroughly research evolution, but I plan on doing it soon.\n\n       However, I have a few reasons why I believe in God, even if the \nproof was in evolution's favor. For one, I have seen Him do supernatural \nworks in my life, that can't be explained any other way, psychologically, \nor physically. Unfortunately, there's no way I can prove this to you or \nanyone else, and I'm sure you'll think I'm nuts or lying, so it's not \nreally a good \"point\" for debating. I might as well be saying I traveled \nback in time and had tea with a ghost. But I know what I've seen, and it's \nkept me believing in God. Another thing that keeps me reluctant about \nevolution, even if I didn't believe in God, is all the chance involved.\n\n       Sure, +E ante, you seem to have a good explanation about the \nmutations, but it still amazes me that even simple cells (which are still \nincredibly complex) could have \"learned\" how to repair mutations in the \nfirst place. I put the quotation marks because cells aren't really \nsentient. But speaking of being sentient, how did mindless simple life \nforms eventually cross the \"bridge\", if you want to call it that, to \nactually being sentient? And all by random mutations and adaptations? There \nare many things that I don't know how they came to be on their own, like \nmemories, being able to visualize images in our heads, personalities and \nwill, etc... Sure, some of those things might have logical explanation that \nI just haven't heard yet, but surely all of it couldn't have come about by \nchance, right? I just don't have enough faith to believe in those kinds of \nodds... And even if all the current evidence points towards evolution, \nwho's to say we just haven't found the evidence that disproves it yet? \nBesides, there are still some flaws in the theory, as I said in an earlier \npost.\n\n        Anyway, I'll try to do more research in the future, so I can make \nmore detailed and intelligent points in discussions like these....",

At least at the moment until someone comes with \nscientific proof which can be PEER REVIEWED and proves it is wrong and that \nsome other hypothesis is correct.\n\nAnd coming to your point about mutations \"Aren't mutations supposed to be \nharmful It's really hard to believe that a series of random mutations (That \nwould be harmful, at the least, 95% of the time) could form more and more \ncomplicated creatures, until it got to us.\"\n\nThere are many kinds of mutations, some of them don't cause harm, since \nthey can happen in what is thought of as non-coding parts (or parts not \nbeing used in that particular cell) of the DNA (and I would like to make it \nclear, it is thought of, or it was thought of recently, it's a \nhypotheses).And if they occur in the coding parts, some don't matter \ntowards the final outcome (the protein), although this is rare, also there \nare many ways by which the cell can repair mutations, one of them is the \nSOS method, but there are more.\n\nIf a mutation occurs the fact that there are millions of cells and \nthousands or millions of members in a species makes its effect lower. On \nthe other hand, some mutations can benefit the cell or organism by creating \nnew proteins which can have different functions to the original one, \nalthough this can be rare. One of the cases in which it happens and by \nwhich it can help our body is in the secondary immunity, if mutations occur \nin the section of DNA which codes for the variable region of our antibodies \nor antigen receptors this can give us an advantage, since maybe that \nreceptor or antibody can attach to a different epitope (the part of an \nantigen to which the antibody binds to) leading to immunity against a new \npathogen or a mutated pathogen.\ufeff\n\nIn the case of individual cells, the mutations can be helpfull since in \nsome cases it leads to variations which are favourable under certain \nconditions, such as a bacteria which tolerates better heat since its \nproteins won't denature at higher temperatures.",

They haven't really offended me, but I was a little \nannoyed that it seemed your last post mainly consisted of mocking \nChristianity and other random things like that instead of valid points. \nAnyway, E ante already complained about my last article, so I admitted that \nit had less to do with evolution, that I had thrown it in there for good \nmeasure, and that I had kind of skimmed it over. No one ever said anything \nabout the other ones, though, and they had less to do with Christianity and \nmore to do with pointing out flaws in evolution. Like I've said before, I'm \nreally busy, and it's a miracle I've been able to respond to you so fast \nlately. We both know it can take me weeks to reply. Why? Because I'm really \nbusy, (I'm only about 17 and still in school as well) and in over my head \nin other discussions that take up time.\n\n       Anyway, as to your question at the end. You said *\"how many atheists \ndeny the fundamentals of biology, archaeological findings, history, and the \nlaws of thermodynamics governing the conservation of mass and energy?\"*. It \nseems you're trying to point out that Christians often deny the \nfundamentals of biology, archeology, etc... Usually, the Christians who \n\"deny\" the fundamentals of those things simply haven't done thorough \nresearch yet, or really misrepresent the Bible, thus making it look worse \nthan it really is.\n\n       The Christians *who have done their research* usually don't deny \nthose things, just stuff like macroevolution. I don't know if you consider \nthat fundamental to biology or whatever, but other than that, they don't \nreally deny much else you would consider fact. It seems to me there are \nthree groups of people when it comes to Christianity VS Atheism. The first \ngroup would consist of the people who never really took the time to \nresearch the \"scientific\" matters about the Bible, but believe it based off \nof other things. The second one would consist of people who did some \nresearch, and based off of that, think that the first group consists of \n\"ignorant\" or uneducated people. For instance, when I say \"some\" research, \nI mean this. Surely you've heard of the seeming \"contradictions\" in the \nBible, right? If an Atheist did a little bit of research on the Bible, and \ncame up with these \"contradictions\", they might be content to say they had \ndisproved the Bible and refuse to believe in it. Likewise, they might do a \nlittle bit of research on evolution, and not find any of it's problems or \nflaws, and easily deduce it was correct and the Bible was wrong, thus \nprompting them to look down on the people in the first group.\n\n       Then, what I'd consider the third group to be, is the people who \nhave done in depth research on both matters. If you dig deeper into the \nBible, you'll see that there are very reasonable answers for all of the \n\"contradictions\". And, likewise, if you do some heavy research on \nevolution, you'll find its flaws as well. You'll also find that the Bible \nisn't exactly specific on how long it took for the Earth to form.\n       However, you'll even find evidence for the young-Earth theory. Sound \nabsurd? Allow me to explain. (Please note, I still don\u2019t exactly believe in \nthe Young-Earth theory, but I thought these points sounded interesting and \nmade it sound a bit more credible.) For one, there\u2019s something called the \n\u201cGenesis Code\u201d or something\u2026 I\u2019m a little bit fuzzy on the details, but it \ngoes something like this: That at the start of the Big Bang, everything was \nmoving a lot faster because of the explosion from the point of singularity. \nTherefore, when the Earth was formed, billions of years worth of time \npassed in 6 24-hour periods, or days. According to the theory, \u201ctime\u201d (How \nfast everything in the Universe was moving) eventually slowed down to what \nit is today. Again, I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on it, so I probably misrepresented it \nsome. Anyway, sounded interesting in my opinion. Another theory (that some \nnon-Christians have adopted) is that light used to move faster.   \n\nhttp://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2012/08/light-traveled-faster-in-the-early-universe-todays-most-popular.html\n    That would invalidate the proof of a billions of years old Universe \nthat\u2019s based off of how far away stars are, if it's true. What I mean is \nthis. Some people say that the fact that some stars are billions of light \nyears away prove that the Universe is billions of years old. And at first \nglance they\u2019d be right. But if light used to be faster, that particular \nargument would be invalidated. These and a few other theories seem pretty \ninteresting, but again, I\u2019m not out to prove the Earth is 6000 years old. \nThe Bible isn\u2019t specific on the matter.",

I don't think buying houses in alberta for 400% original \nprice is something to brag about.\n2. Ontario is in a loooooot of debt and as toronto is canada's biggest city \nthey needed to make changes so that we can start making some of that back. \nSaying ford is like hitler just to compare the love of police is really \nstupid. In our biggest city with all of the immigrants, toronto needs more \npolice. The more i read your comment over, you just sound brainwashed \nyourself.\n3. I'm no conservative puppet, i know they aren't perfect. Infact they are \nfar from it. At the federal level though they are balancing the budget and \ngiving canada a chance at doing well in these crazy times we live in. \nLiberals want nothing more than to spend all that hard work away. Please \ndon't kid yourself, voting independant is like wiping your ass with your \nvote. \n4. As being canadian myself, i don't think of myself as right or left wing \nbut somewhere in the middle. As i think we all are, but i do admit my last \nfew posts were rather \"extreme\". \n5. As someone who is interested in politics i use it as a bad word mostly \nbecause of the people around me. I was raised in a very conservative family \nso the prejudice is hard to fight but i come back to the wanting to the \nliberal ideal of the \"best way to make money is to spend money\" *cough* \npower plant *cough* However i do agree with some liberal ideals, being in \nthe middle i think everyone should. The right wing approach just doesn't \nwork in the 21st century. If we use what is good about the old ways and \nfreshen it up, we could have a very nice country to be very proud of. I \nthink we'd both like that.\n\nAs a side note i want to apologize for my earlier crude statements, i guess \nsometimes one can get a little too passionate and lose sight of their true \nbeliefs. i just love canada and want the best for her. I think above all \nelse we can agree upon that.   ",
