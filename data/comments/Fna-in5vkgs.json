It is that there \nare others that are more deserving; if free food is going to be given out \nit should go to the most deserving first.\nAnd class distinctions are rampant in America, why should a firefighter \nrate so much higher than a city bookkeeper?  It would be hard to quantify, \nbut I suspect that a city bookkeeper effects more people, more profoundly \nthan a firefighter. The firefighter has more visibility, has more job \nrelated risk, and effects us more emotionally than other civil servants, \nthat is why we worship them.\nI just think that if this McDonald's woman is going to make customers wait \nwhile she calls corporate headquarters to authorize free food, maybe it \nshould go to the starving people instead of the cute firemen!

                "text": "\"There is no soul within the corporate machine\"\n\nYup - I know this working firsthand at a popular pizza place I will not \nname. I think what's hilarious though is the amount of rules these \ncorporations force upon their employee's, and how little they give a fuck \nabout them. The funny thing is if you even have the balls to raise your \nopinion about anything the managers who get paid like 1-2$ above minimum \nwage will immediately shut you down just to further feel better about \nthemselves and to try and justify their positions and get in the bed \nfurther with the owners who could give half a fuck about them in the first \nplace. \n\nI know people who dedicate 50+ hours a week and are treated like absolute \ngarbage by the managers/owners who will make sure to fuck them on overtime \nhours- but I think almost anybody who works fastfood or minimum wage jobs \nin general just comes to expect this - no fucks are given for laws either \nand lawyers are so fucking expensive that it isn't even worth the time . \n\nI know people who have worked 5 years who have been fired for arriving mere \nminutes late over things they had no control over, people who devote vasts \namounts of time just to be bumped down a peg because the manager has some \nfetish for some hot girl and gives them management/more hours despite that \nperson lacking seniority; people who walk in with skin conditions who cant \nshave deep who get fired because of \"no facial\" hair policys, or people who \nhave to cover their piercings, scars or tattoo's with ridiculous bandaids. \nNot to mention places that give 17-19 year olds the power to fire people \ntwice their age who have been their twice as long for piety reasons or just \nfor a power trip. \n\nThere is literally no room for error where I work, and no compassion or \nempathy when it comes to anything. Employment is no place for any forms of \nself expression or unique talent - but a place where you are expected to \nwork as a drone pipe down and bend over to those in power. I've phoned my \nemployer to let them know I had to be late 10 minutes over something I had \nno control over after taking shifts from those who've never showed up and \nstaying late despite not having to and the managers I've worked with have \nridiculed me for it saying \"calling late\" doesn't \"help them\" as if they \ncould give a fuck about my reasons or my courtesy for even notifying them \nin the first place. Managers who literally look for any small reason to \nfire somebody over just to feel good about themselves. I know a 17 year old \nmanager who bragged about firing somebody 3 years older - and these are the \nkinds of people these establishments cater to. \n\nMinimum wage jobs attract the shittiest people. Mcdonalds firing this \nperson over being courteous isn't suprising - but again it's just how a lot \nof these places work - and a lot of these people have no choice but to work \nthere because of either lack of money for education or lack of time and \nresponsibility to support their families.\n\nComplaining just nets you the same shit responses from people too. It's \nbest to just keep your head down, say nothing and do your job. Courtesy, \ncompassion, empathy, feelings or any of that shit will end up getting you \nfired eventually. \ufeff",

And that is very similar to what they did to her too. \nThey would have her working double shifts, without overtime pay, to cover \nfor their friends and mistakes. In the end, one of the regional managers \nwas caught stealing from the till, so the blame was put on her and out she \nwent. They screwed her royally.\nI only worked for them a few years in high school, and it was basically the \nsame thing. They even allowed me to deliver pizzas when I was 16, even \nthough it was against company policy. I would close the store and not get \nout of there until after midnight on school nights.\nI think my final straw was when one of the shift managers and I were \nprepping (saucing and cheesing) a \"promotional\" crust that became permanent \nlater. She had the bucket of sauce and hocked the BIGGEST loogey she could \nsnort up, into the sauce and stirred it up, then continued to sauce the \ncrust with it..\nI GAGGED and was completely appalled, but she just laughed it off and said \n\"if you think that's gross, you should see some of the other shit I do \nhere!\" I told the Restaurant manager and was told to keep my mouth shut, \nbecause that's his girlfriend, and if someone will be fired for committing \nsuch a disgusting act, it would be me.\nI quit that same day, and never ate there again.",

Plus you \nmake much more than the other people working there and new hires, but \nyou're disabled, so they can't just fired you for no reason, or something \nthat can be turned around to \"you discriminated against him\". So what they \ndo is start trumping up other \"charges\", like falsifying \"bad work\", then \nclaim you're screwing up, slipping up on the job and they've talked to you \nagain and again and you just keep \"screwing up\". They can then fired you \nsafely.\nBut other than that, your job is OPEN SEASON. =( Your boss doesn't like the \nway you sneeze; YOU'RE FIRED!. Your boss hates your handwriting; YOU'RE \nFIRED!! Your boss wants to hire his mistress and get her on the payroll, \nbut the only job that gets her around his office regularly is yours; YOU'RE \nFIRED!\nEither way, you be the point.. It's stupid..
