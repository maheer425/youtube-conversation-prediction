                    "text": "+IRONMANAustralia \nOkay, I love bats, but I hate Batman. I agree with most of what you say \nabout Batman. Ironman would totally kick his ass, and Batman is overrated, \nand his fondness for little boys in tights is quite disturbing. And quite \nhonestly, Batman takes very little inspiration from actual bats, aside from \nhis name and part of his costume. He doesn't even use sonar. Batman gives \nreal bats a bad name. He's so not similar to an actual bat that when I hear \n\"Batman,\" I don't even think \"bats.\" I just think \"lame posterboy of DC \nUniverse.\"\n\nBut real bats take a large part in keeping mosquitoes and other bugs we \ndon't like under control. DDT is a giant fail, as it completely ruins \necosystems. Just one example of its effects is that it makes birds' eggs \nhave thin shells, threatening them to extinction since they can't \nreproduce. Bats provide us humans with free pest control (yes, it's not \nperfect, but it's free and mosquitoes would be way worse without them). The \nonly way they would spread disease is if you went around eating their feces \nor got bitten by them (and since most bats don't go out of their way to \nbite humans, it would be your own damn fault).\n\nI really don't know what your beef with bats is. Yeah, they have rabies, \nbut so do lots of other creatures, dogs included. And it's not like every \nbat carries the disease, otherwise they would die out. And rabies is only a \nthreat if you're trekking out in the wilderness days away from access to \nmodern medicine. You're the one who's over-reacting, not the people who \ncare about the planet and don't want it destroyed from people making \nirrational decisions like yourself. Honestly you sound like a raging \nredneck and the stereotype for Americans that other countries think we are.",
