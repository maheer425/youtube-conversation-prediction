Doing this will cool the cooking side avoiding charring. At the same \ntime the movement will not allow too much heat to penetrate the middle so \nit cooks slower towards the middle.  You will end up with a highly \n\"crusted\" not burned, meat that if seasoned well will be amazing.

With whole cuts of red \nmeat, the bacteria you need to worry about is on the outside, and browning \nthe meat will kill those off, while the inside won't be a problem.
