You can even believe that life on Earth was originally initiated by \na god.  Our understanding of abiogenesis is, at *worst*, decent.  We can \neven ignore the fact that argumentum ad ignorantiam is a logical fallacy.  \nNeither are pertinent to the next point.\n\nEven if you believe that God created the universe (there are legitimate \nbiologists who believe this), and even if you believe that God personally \ncreated the original life on Earth (there are [fewer, but, still, some] \nlegitimate biologists who believe this too), this would in no way impact or \ninvalidate the fact of evolution.\n\nAll life on Earth is descended from a common ancestor.  Every animal, \nplant, and fungus on this planet is a cousin (some more distant than \nothers) of every other.  Go outside and find a bird sitting in a tree.  \nThat bird is your distant cousin, as well as mine.  The tree the bird is \nsitting in?  Also a distant cousin to you and to me and to every other \nperson and to every other animal and every other plant that is living today \nand that has ever lived.\n\nThis is not an opinion.  This is not a guess.  This is a fact.  All \nanimals, plants, and fungi evolved through ancestral lines in a single \nmassive family tree.  Every one is directly related to every other, and \nevery one shares an ancestor if you trace the lineages back far enough.  \nThis is reality.\n\nEvolution is a fact.  It has been proven beyond any plausible refute, and, \nwhat's more, it would still be a fact even *if* the universe and, indeed, \neven if the original life on Earth had been created by God.  Creationism is \nfalse, whether God exists or not.  I urge you to take it upon yourself to \nactually study the subject of evolutionary biology.  That way, the next \ntime someone says something as patently false as \"nothing evolved\", it \nwon't be you making the error; indeed, you can be the one to correct their \nmisunderstanding.",
