Looking back to it, I have to admit it may be \nfar-fetched, but I still believe it to be true on some level.\n\nAlso, I never said a white guy from America, I was talking about people who \nunderstand one of the Western cultures, most notably by living in it.

I'm sure, that you are a well meaning person, I was only \npointing out, that for most of us, who learned English, French, German, \nSpanish, Portugese, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, or Russian as a second \nlanguage, there is a challenge to get noticed in the platforms of social \nmedia, since even beyond obvious hate and ignorance, there are still \npeople, who master their own culture, and isolate themselves from others, \nso pronouncing and understanding names falls hard, although there should \nbe, in theory no difference between two ideas.\n\nCase in point, Ethiopia, aside for Liberia was the only country never \ncolonized, and since Eritrea's departure, does not have to largely struggle \nwith things we knew in the '80s. They produce one of the world's best \ncoffees, and some expensive gloves, yet as John pointed out, we mostly \nregard the continent as one country. My ideal is, that progressive people \nshould be able to overstep cultural boundaries, and ease the situation of \nless developed countries with being open to experiences, ideas, and \nsuggestion from others, regardless, if we have problems pronouncing a name, \nand don't know right away, if our conversational partner is a he or a she.",

Here in the \nSeattle area there is a rather active East African community, and you will \nfind people in health care fields from several different nations here, \nwanting to come to America and stay here for the better life it offers. \n Just off the top of my head, I've met people from Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, \nand Eritrea, and I'm certain I've forgotten others.  \n\nThe owner of the adult family home I reside in was born in what it now \nEritrea, as was his wife, and they spent time in Sudan during the Eritrean \nwar of independence (And they have some strong opinions of Cold War \npolitics).  Their oldest daughter was born in Sudan, and their youngest was \nadopted from a brother.  I ask them questions because I'm quite curious \nabout them and their lives, and they are my friends as well.  But they live \nhere, now, and they are naturalized citizens (I think their sons might be \nnative-born Americans, in fact), and it is Eritrea's loss and our gain \nhere.  \n\nMy most recent live-in caregiver just went back to Ethiopia, but she vows \nit's only going to be for three months, since she very much wants to stay \nin the United States, because of the opportunities here.  Which gets me \nthinking how difficult things are when immigrants will work long hours for \nlow pay here, and fight to stay and improve their chances at integrating.\ufeff",

I was looking at this map the other day: \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2evjkz/i_pinged_all_devices_on_the_internet_heres_a_map/\n\nI think if you could quantify soft power and map internet usage vs. a \ncountry's soft power, you would find a pretty clear correlation between the \ntwo. Let's face it, the internet is essentially how most of us get our \ninformation in this era. Since the majority of people on earth won't have \nthe luxury of choosing to travel frequently, the conversations we have \nonline with strangers from other countries form the basis of how we \nperceive others from different countries. The internet holds a LOT of white \nnoise but I think the problem starts when some voices, which hold similar \nbackgrounds and cultural references are MASSIVELY louder than others. \nTelling stories on behalf of others - or giving them a platform is useful, \nbut I think it would be more useful for our cultural understanding of the \nother if online communities (particularly sites like Reddit and Tumblr that \nallow easy interaction between strangers, as opposed to Facebook which \nlimits you more to your existing group of acquaintances) if voices from \ndifferent countries were heard more frequently.\n\nI feel like it would be extremely interest to map the effect of internet \nexposure on soft power and the perception of other people within the world!",
