                "text": "Something i always miss in the U.S. whenever i go to Mexico is that you \nhave to pay to go to the bathroom.  When we go drive over there we always \nhave to have like 10 dollars in change in order to live by a day with going \nto the bathroom.  Also when you pay theres sometimes a person who gives you \nthe toilet paper and it sucks because they always give you like 3 sheets \nand its terrible.  I am verry thankful to have free bathrooms in the U.S.\ufeff",

So i have to open the windows which is \nwhat everyeone here does~ but like in houston YOU DONT OPEN WINDOWS UNLESS \nIT'S SUMMER AND UR AC IS BROKEN OR SHITTY. and here the heaters are these \nweird box things almost to the floor compared to the AC/Heater vents \nupclose to the ceiling (<--we have in Houston)~\n~ and another thing is ceiling fans and ceiling LIGHTS in apartments tend \nto not exist in many places in Washington... like u'll find them in the \nkitchen and bathroom~ maybe the dinning room if u have one- but in bedrooms \nand living room its like \"hahahah who needs light? go buy a lamp\". You're \nlucky if you find a place with a ceiling light in the bedrooms. and then \nceiling fans~ it's hard to find apts in WA that have them- my apt has one \nbut it only in the dining room... like wth i want one in my bedroom!\nAtleast here in the USA we have it better than when I lived in El Salvador \nwhere we had no ac or heater in the house and only had holes in the walls \nfor air ventilation. but yea--- even in the SAME COUNTRY things can be so \ndifferent.\ufeff",

During the summers, the temperature should not be \ncooled down to 25C (Or 27C or in between) and during the winters, it goes \nthe other way around. Random checks will be made from 'ordinary \nlooking' guys from the government by simply measuring the temperature \ninside the building. If the temperature is indeed exceeding (or cooler \nthan) its limit, the facility owner will be heavily fined. It's not only \nSouth Korea, but many other countries are doing this (mostly European \ncountries, and in fact, most people do not even own air conditioners in \nFrance).

If you \nhave 100 acres of land, is it more efficient to have a 100 acres of corn, \nor 25/corn, 25/wheat, 25/barley, 25, etc... you get the point. Also, corn \nis incredibly durable, has a short maturation cycle, and is in general \ncheap and easy to make. \n\nSo... going back, if you're making pepto bismol, and you can use corn syrup \nor some other derivative to introduce to pepto instead of a more expensive \nalternative, what would you use? Sugar(i.e. cane, brown, white, etc...)? \nWhy use that on your pepsi's, when you have corn sugar which is a 1/10th of \nthe cost? Hey, you like eating beef? Feed them corn, despite the fact that \ncows aren't naturally predisposed to eat corn, which many scientists \nsuggest \"corn\" may actually be partially responsible for mad cow disease, \netc...\n\nTLDR? In short, it's super f'n cheap. ",
