                "text": "+James BA Hitman +Foxy the prince of hell Please, listen to the video. here \nare some lyrics to read along if you need them. Thank you for your time.\n\nThere will be bad days.\n\nBe calm. Loosen your grip, opening each palm slowly now.\n\n Let go. Be confident.\n\n Know that now is only a moment,\n\n and that if today is as bad as it gets,\n\nunderstand that by tomorrow, today will have ended.\n\nBe gracious. Accept each extended hand offered, to pull you back from the \nsomewhere you cannot escape.\n\nBe diligent. Scrape the gray sky clean.\n\nRealize every dark cloud is a smoke screen meant to blind us from the \ntruth, and the truth is whether we see them or not - the sun and moon are \nstill there and always there is light.\n\nBe forthright. Despite your instinct to say \"it's alright, I'm okay\" - be \nhonest.\n\n Say how you feel without fear or guilt, without remorse or complexity.\n\n Be lucid in your explanation, be sterling in your oppose.\n\n If you think for one second no one knows what you've been going through; \nbe accepting of the fact that you are wrong,\n\nthat the long drawn and heavy breaths of despair have at times been felt by \neveryone - that pain is part of the human condition and that alone makes \nyou a legion.\n\nWe hungry underdogs, we risers with dawn, we dissmisser's of odds, we \nblesser's of on \u2013 we will station ourselves to the calm.\n\n We will hold ourselves to the steady, be ready player one.\n\nLife is going to come at you armed with hard times and tough choices,\n\n your voice is your weapon, your thoughts ammunition \u2013 there are no free \nextra men,\n\nbe aware that as the instant now passes, it exists now as then.\n\n So be a mirror reflecting yourself back, and remembering the times when \nyou thought all of this was too hard and you'd never make it through.\n\nRemember the times you could have pressed quit \u2013 but you hit continue.\n\n Be forgiving. Living with the burden of anger, is not living.\n\nGiving your focus to wrath will leave your entire self absent of what you \nneed.\n\nLove and hate are beasts and the one that grows is the one you feed.\n\nBe persistent. Be the weed growing through the cracks in the cement, \nbeautiful - because it doesn't know it's not supposed to grow there.\n\nBe resolute. Declare what you accept as true in a way that envisions the \nresolve with which you accept it.\n\n If you are having a good day, be considerate. A simple smile could be the \nfirst-aid kit that someone has been looking for.\n\nIf you believe with absolute honesty that you are doing everything you can \n- do more.\n There will be bad days, Times when the world weighs on you for so long it \nleaves you looking for an easy way out.\n\n There will be moments when the drought of joy seems unending. Instances \nspent pretending that everything is alright when it clearly is not, check \nyour blind spot.\n\n See that love is still there, be patient. Every nightmare has a beginning, \nbut every bad day has an end.\n\n Ignore what others have called you. I am calling you friend.\n\nMake us comprehend the urgency of your crisis.\n\n Silence left to its own devices, breed's silence. So speak and be heard.\n\n One word after the next, express yourself and put your life in the context \n\u2013 if you find that no one is listening, be loud.\n\nMake noise. Stand in poise and be open. Hope in these situations is not \nenough and you will need someone to lean on.\n\nIn the unlikely event that you have no one, look again. Everyone is blessed \nwith the ability to listen.\n\n The deaf will hear you with their eyes. The blind will see you with their \nhands.\n\n Let your heart fill their news-stands, Let them read all about it. Admit \nto the bad days, the impossible nights.\n\nListen to the insights of those who have been there, but come back.\n\nThey will tell you; you can stack misery, you can pack disappear you can \neven wear your sorrow \u2013 but come tomorrow you must change your clothes.\n\nEveryone knows pain. We are not meant to carry it forever.\n\n We were never meant to hold it so closely, so be certain in the belief \nthat what pain belongs to now will belong soon to then.\n\nThat when someone asks you how was your day, realize that for some of us \u2013 \nit's the only way we know how to say, be calm. Loosen your grip, opening \neach palm, slowly now \u2013 let go.\ufeff",

Know that now is only a moment, and that \nif today is as bad as it gets, understand that by tomorrow, today will have \nended. Be gracious. Accept each extended hand offered, to pull you back \nfrom the somewhere you cannot escape. Be diligent. Scrape the gray sky \nclean. Realize every dark cloud is a smoke screen meant to blind us from \nthe truth, and the truth is whether we see them or not - the sun and moon \nare still there and always there is light. Be forthright. Despite your \ninstinct to say \"it's alright, I'm okay\" - be honest. Say how you feel \nwithout fear or guilt, without remorse or complexity. Be lucid in your \nexplanation, be sterling in your oppose. If you think for one second no one \nknows what you've been going through; be accepting of the fact that you are \nwrong, that the long drawn and heavy breaths of despair have at times been \nfelt by everyone - that pain is part of the human condition and that alone \nmakes you a legion. We hungry underdogs, we risers with dawn, we \ndissmisser's of odds, we blesser's of on \u2013 we will station ourselves to the \ncalm. We will hold ourselves to the steady, be ready player one. Life is \ngoing to come at you armed with hard times and tough choices, your voice is \nyour weapon, your thoughts ammunition \u2013 there are no free extra men, be \naware that as the instant now passes, it exists now as then. So be a mirror \nreflecting yourself back, and remembering the times when you thought all of \nthis was too hard and you'd never make it through. Remember the times you \ncould have pressed quit \u2013 but you hit continue. Be forgiving. Living with \nthe burden of anger, is not living. Giving your focus to wrath will leave \nyour entire self absent of what you need. Love and hate are beasts and the \none that grows is the one you feed. Be persistent. Be the weed growing \nthrough the cracks in the cement, beautiful - because it doesn't know it's \nnot supposed to grow there. Be resolute. Declare what you accept as true in \na way that envisions the resolve with which you accept it. If you are \nhaving a good day, be considerate. A simple smile could be the first-aid \nkit that someone has been looking for. If you believe with absolute honesty \nthat you are doing everything you can - do more. There will be bad days, \nTimes when the world weighs on you for so long it leaves you looking for an \neasy way out. There will be moments when the drought of joy seems unending. \nInstances spent pretending that everything is alright when it clearly is \nnot, check your blind spot. See that love is still there, be patient. Every \nnightmare has a beginning, but every bad day has an end. Ignore what others \nhave called you. I am calling you friend. Make us comprehend the urgency of \nyour crisis. Silence left to its own devices, breed's silence. So speak and \nbe heard. One word after the next, express yourself and put your life in \nthe context \u2013 if you find that no one is listening, be loud. Make noise. \nStand in poise and be open. Hope in these situations is not enough and you \nwill need someone to lean on. In the unlikely event that you have no one, \nlook again. Everyone is blessed with the ability to listen. The deaf will \nhear you with their eyes. The blind will see you with their hands. Let your \nheart fill their news-stands, Let them read all about it. Admit to the bad \ndays, the impossible nights. Listen to the insights of those who have been \nthere, but come back. They will tell you; you can stack misery, you can \npack disappear you can even wear your sorrow \u2013 but come tomorrow you must \nchange your clothes. Everyone knows pain. We are not meant to carry it \nforever. We were never meant to hold it so closely, so be certain in the \nbelief that what pain belongs to now will belong soon to then. That when \nsomeone asks you how was your day, realize that for some of us \u2013 it's the \nonly way we know how to say, be calm. Loosen your grip, opening each palm, \nslowly now \u2013 let go.\"\n\nShould make it easier to caption.\ufeff",
