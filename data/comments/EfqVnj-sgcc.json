Speed is associated with the medium \nthrough which the object travels, and so the speed of light is related to \nthe essential fabric of spacetime.\n\nYou also have the gravitational constant (G), which is related to who knows \nwhat.\n\nWell, Plank's length comes from combining these natural and essential \nparameters, constrained by the nature of spacetime and the minimum energy \nyou can have, and thus you get the minimum amount of space you can divide \ninto.\n\nL = (Gxh/c^3)^0.5\n\nWhich about 10^-33 m if I recall correctly.\n\nAll this is pure speculation (albeit a reasonable one), since that sort of \ndistance is waaaaay smaller than what the actual energies we can gather (or \nwill be able to in the future) allow us to inspect.",

TO A POINT where it becomes too thin to draw.. Thats fine.. \" you \nremain stuck on believing that lines are objects. They are not objects. In \nfact, squares, triangles and other geometrical shapes also aren't objects, \nthey are just shapes that define a surface area. \n\nI'm becoming repetitive, but lines don't have width by definition, they \nnever did, ever since the father of Geometry Eucleud defined the \"line\" \nmany years BC. They are not matter, much like with vectors or even 2 \ndimensional geometrical shapes. If I cut the shape of a triangle off a \npaper, my triangle is made of matter, so it has width, height(miniscule) \nand length, it's a 3 dimensional object, not a 2 dimensional shape, yet we \nstill recognize it as a triangle. It's the same with lines. Drawing a line \non a paper doesn't mean that lines in general have a width which is \nequivalent to the width of the marking that my ink left on the paper. Lines \nare 1 dimensional geometrical tools that define shapes and the concept of \nlength and/or distance. Dismissing this definition as a folly is pretty \nmuch scrapping not only today's high math but also most of the math that \nman has ever known, if not all of it.\n\nAs for infinity now. Infinity is a concept tied to it's core with numbers \nand mathematics. It's the concept that there's no smallest or biggest \nnumber and I dare you to disprove it. With materials of the real world, I \ncan't play with infinity because there are limitations, but with concepts I \ncan. And, I'm sorry, but concepts also exist in the real world. For \nexample, distance is a concept. If I'm one meter away from you, I can \nreduce that to 1/2 a meter. And then that to 1/4 of a meter. After a bit, I \nreach 1/128 away from you. But I can still divide by two, there's no rule \nthat says I can't. So I keep going. 1/256, 1/416, 1/832 and so on and so \nforth. Nothing stops me because I'm not dividing matter by two, I'm \ndividing distance by two, and distance is not material. Zeno claimed that \nsince there's always a small distance to cover, I'll never reach you. And \nwe found out that the distance between me and you becomes so small that it \nis annuled. Not only that, but we found out that the sum of 1/2 + 1/4 \n+...+1/416+1/832+... equals 1 and we defined 1 as the limit of a function.\n\nThis \"paradox\" helped us define limits and work with functions that we \ncouldn't use before. Mathematics may get pretty theoretical but they are \nactually bound with the real world and almost never escape from it(except \nimaginary numbers, not quite sure about those). I understand your concern \ncompletely, but it's only through pondering and pushing our imagination \nthat we can discover or invent new things. As a matter of fact, if we use \nbasic tools that have been proven to work perfectly, in order to construct \nbigger tools, and then use those tools to construct even bigger ones, \nwouldn't the end product still adhere to the same rules as before? Sure, we \nmust be careful to use our tools correctly and watch out for mistakes, but \nthat's exactly the point of these \"paradoxes\". We find flaws in our system \nwhich we then fix.\n\nBy the way, the definition of square root of 2 is \"the number which if you \nraise to the power of 2, will produce the number 2\". I mentioned it because \nyou complained about me using it in a previous comment. Anyway, google \nirrational numbers and you'll see a full explanation on why they all have \ninfinite amounts of decimal digits, including square root of 2. Another way \nto see numbers with infinite decimal digits, albeit not irrational ones, is \nby doing divisions like 10/3. We all know the result is 3.3333333333333.... \nand it goes on. It's because of the nature of the division using the \ndecimal system that we get this result.\n\nHope I shone some light over there.\n\nEDIT: I took out the part where I site the function because I made a \nmistake.",

My \nreason for this however is because it states something that is clearly \nincorrect and I don't feel I need to understand complex math to know that..\nInteresting to hear you say that a line in has no width.. Again I \ndisagree..  Were you not talking about a line that was painted on a piece \nof material..? Initially at least.. It has width.. then somehow we were \nassuming knowledge about imaginary things.. this it where the slight of \nhand happens.. It's all I'm trying to point out because I think it's \nimportant.. This is my point.. This slipping between things and non-things \nand trying to carry conclusions across.. In my world if your piece of \nmaterial is a meter square then the squiggly line could be 1/2 meter wide \nand go up and back so be 2 m long.. and if it got thinner it gets longer.. \nTO A POINT where it becomes too thin to draw.. Thats fine.. Your imaginary \nline that has no width has no width.. so it's no a line .. it's a concept.. \npossibly a conceptual line..? but the two things are different.. then \nyou're in concept land and you can begin to play with infinities and such \nbut you can't then assume that the new concepts that result apply to the \nreal world again.. This you have to check and try.. it's called science..So \nyes your imaginary line of infinite length can exist between your two \nimaginary conceptual points.. knock yourself out.. but in the real world \nthis is simply no how things actually work.. that's all I'm saying.. there \nis not paradox.. it's simply two entirely different things being spoken \nabout with similar or the same words and the speaker confusing them for the \nsame thing as a result.. As to whether this is what Zeno was doing or \nintending to do or whether it was simple meant to illustrate some point \nabout not assuming things I don't know..

                    "text": "+paulflute First of all, let's clear something up. I don't believe this is \na paradox, but I also don't think it's just confusion on behalf of a great \nphilosopher and mathematician. It helped us find our way to the limit \ntheory and define an infinitesimal amount.\n\nBack to the discusion, I brought up \"drawing a line\" and \"lines on \nmaterials\" to make my example more understandable.I quote you \"But clearly \nfor an infinitely long line to be drawn on a finite surface it would have \nto be infinitely thin. i.e. it's width would have to be (tend towards) \nzero.. i.e. it doesn't exist..\" By definition, a line has no width, it only \nhas length, it is one dimensional, it covers no surface. Even still, the \npoint and the line are both concepts. They are not physical, they are not \ncomprised of any material. But existance isn't solely based on having mass. \nLines and points exist in our perception of the world and are integral in \nhow we explain it.\n\nAlso, square root of 2 belongs in the same category of numbers as pi and is \nproven to have infinite decimals.\n\nPythagorean Theorem : If the right triangle is comprised of the three \npoints A, B and C,with the hypotenuse being the line BC, the following \nequation is fullfilled (AB)^2 + (AC)^2 = (BC)^2 where (AB) , (AC) and (BC) \nthe length of the sides of the triangle. You actually wrote the equation \nyourself, but with words. So, if the length of AB and AC are one 1, as with \nthe triangle I introduced before, this becomes 2 = (BC)^2 or (BC) = Square \nRoot of 2. Pythagoras may not have lived in the epoch of decimals, but his \nTheorem is always true, so the result I found is valid,\n\nAs for your recap, I agree 100% with you that THINGS can not be infinitely \ndivided. In the physical world, we hit a barrier when we reach the atom, \nmuch less the sub-atomic particles. But as I said before, lines are not \nTHINGS. They are not physical, they are conceptual. Lines can be infinitely \ndivided. A line's length could be 0.000000000000001 or \n0.0000000000000000000000001, or even 10^-30. And when we talk about \ndistance between two points, we are talking about a line. Distance CAN be \ninifinitely divided.\n\nZeno's paradox really isn't a paradox because there was a small but crucial \nflaw in logic that has to do with limits and infinitesimal amounts. But \nexcuse me, I don't believe my knowledge allows me to go any further than \nthis and make explanations on those theories.",

I can imagine an \ninfinitely long squiggly line being drawn on a piece of paper as my \nimagination has no physical form and therefore no limits.. But clearly for \nan infinitely long line to be drawn on a finite surface it would have to be \ninfinitely thin. i.e. it's width would have to be (tend towards) zero.. \ni.e. it doesn't exist.. which is just my point .. physical things have \nlimits: imagination does not.. it's not a paradox.. they're just different \nthings..\nYour triangle example is equally misled.. Root 2 may or may not have \ninfinite decimal places.. we have no way of knowing.. by definition.. As I \nhave said.. If we know the limits of an object then it is not infinite. is \nwe do not know the limits then we cannot say whether is is infinite or not..\nBut this is irrelevant as Pythagorus neither used not understood decimal \nplaces.. they being discovered (in the west) many centuries after his \ndeath.. His theory states that the sum of the SQUARE of the hypotenuse \nequals the sum of the square of the other two sides.. So it if take a right \nangled triangle and make squares out of the the length of the sides then \nthe biggest SQUARE covers the same area as the other two.. that's all.. no \ndecimal places or infinities required..\nAnd just incase you are still unsure the word square here refers to a shape \nnot a mathematical function..\nTo recap my point is this.. Zeno's paradox states that the distance between \nto things is infinite because we can subdivide it infinitely.. I say this \nis not a paradox but simply a semantic confusion..

In my mind, I can imagine a line that connects them and \ncontacts both at a 90 degree angle, that line defines thei distance. If I \ntake a paintbrush and actually paint that line, does it now exist? Yes, \nsince I can see it I guess it does.

Of course, you have a right triangle with \ntwo sides of 1 meter each. What's the size of the third side?

But square root of 2 has infinite decimal \ndigits, how is it possible to have the side of my paper triangle have a \nlength that has infinite decimal digits? It isn't, we can't achieve such \naccuracy in the real world. But what if I never actually cut the sheet of \npaper? The diagonal distance between it's points should still be square \nroot of two. And let's say that having a square piece of paper that's \nexactly 1 square meter is impossible as well. The fact that I can't cut a \nmaterial into that exact shape and size because of lack of ability to get \nthat kind of accuracy doesn't mean that the lines that I SHOULD cut in \norder to get that shape aren't there. So, if you look at a surface, There \nmany places on it, infinite to be exact, on which you can cut to get a \nsquare that's 1 square meter in size. And that means that the diagonal \ndistance between it's points also exists, so the line with a length of \nsquare root of 2 does exist in the real world.

Would to carry half of your \nmemories and skills.. would it run half as fast but require only half the \nfood..\n\nIf I invented a symbol for the contents of this bag say \u2018ttp\u2019 would I then \nbe able to multiply this by 5..?\nif I took a larger bag containing ttpX5/2 to your mother would she be \ndelighted..? cos she would be able to throw away one ttp/2 and use the \nother four to make two sons..? how wonderful..?\n\nNo.. none of this would happen.. slice you in half we get a bag of blood \nand bones.. it has o% of your personality, knowledge and skills..\n\neven at a more basic level.. cut a table and chair in half with the same \nchainsaw and you DO NOT get 2X .05 table and chairs.. You get a pile of \nwood.. which does not stand up and can\u2019t be sat on or eaten off.. you can\u2019t \nhalf sit on a half chair or half eat you dinner of a flat bit of wood with \ntwo legs on one side.. It\u2019s just not how the world works..\n\nWhy do mathematicians remain under the illusion that if you can make a \nsymbol up for something then it must actually exist.. you say thing like \n\u201cTherefore there must be an infinite number of midpoints\u201d.. this is called \nlogical conjecture.. it\u2019s very useful sometime.. but in the physical \nsciences it\u2019s a beginning.. you than have to go and FIND these points and \ndescribe them.. to say they simply \u2018must\u2019 exist in not enough..\n\nAs for infinity.. In the real world there may or may not be infinitely \nlarge object,, by we can never know this by definition.. If we have any \ninformation about the limits of an object then it\u2019s not infinite.. and if \nwe don\u2019t then we can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s infinite or not..  comprend\u00e9..?\n\nNow back to maths..\n\nagain have you any evidence that your process can happen infinity..? has \nanybody ever done it infinitely..? clearly not.. so when you say it can \nhappen infinitely what you mean is in a purely conceptual landscape you can \nsee no reason why this process should have to end..\n\nIn the real world the process that you started required some pixels and \nsome power.. so it\u2019s infinite iteration would require and infinitely large \ncomputer with an infinitely large screen and a never ending power source.. \nthis may sound pedantic but it\u2019s important to understand..\n\nwhen we say infinite in maths what it actually means in any useful sense is \nsomething like \u2018and so on and so on\u2019 .. and what\u2019s interesting is often the \nmost useful thinking about infinities is the convergent infinities which \n\u2018tend towards a limit\u2019.. so we have limits again..\n\nand again you cannot even know if a process can go on indefinitely for the \nsame reasons as the infinitely large thing.. find a limit.. it\u2019s not \ninfinite.. don\u2019t find any limits.. you can\u2019t say whether they exist or not..\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong I love maths.. it goes from incredibly useful to mind \nblowingly beautiful.. but it\u2019s when people start thinking that it\u2019s real \nthat they get stuck in the gaps between how they they imagine the world \nought logically to behave and how it actually does behave.. and this is \nneither useful nor beautiful..

It's a useful mathematical \nconcept,, but it's no more.. it's not even really a process and is never \nactually done in maths..\nWhenever the concept of infinity comes into play people have to try to \nfigure out different ways to approximate it.. sometimes these \napproximations are rougher than other but always result in something that \nis approximate.. the problem is that when this is forgotten and the next \ngeneration begin to use the approximation as if it was the actual thing you \nget these semantic nonsenses that occur in the gap between the two.. this \nbeing one of the first.. a more recent example being the -1/12 as the sum \nof all integers and then being used in string theory as if it really was \nthe answer.. rather than an product of the approximation..
