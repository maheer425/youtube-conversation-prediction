The closest \nthing me have are serial killers and mass murderers. They don't carry \nchainsaws and, with one or two exceptions, don't wear masks of human skin. \nMany serial killers have been described as \"charming\", \"persuasive\" and \nseemingly normal.\n\nBut their minds are like a vault of corpses under a charming European city \nor a fire burning silently out of control under a Pennsylvania suburb. If \nwe're alone there's nothing to deal with but our own problems. In a crowd \nwe can trust the law of averages to tell us that we're probably safe. It's \nthe stuff right at the edge that's the real horror. That one guy on the \nsubway with you. That one person waiting in the car across the street of \nyour house.\n\nOr, you know, some guy with a shotgun running around Gungkin-Jima yelling \n\"Oh come out muthafucka!!!\" \n\nThat guy's totally a dangerous psycho.",

Though I imagine \nfinding it would be difficult.\nMummy caves- this I don't know, honestly. I want to say no, but I could be \nwrong.\nHelltown is - I imagine- like Centralia, PA. You probably can easily get \nthere though I don't believe it's legal. There are many videos of people \ngoing to Centralia, but it's mostly Urbex, and police tend to try to keep \npeople out.\nJatinga, like stated, is for visiting :)\nThe Catacombs of Paris are open for visiting as well.\nCandido Godoi is a town, I imagine it being open to visitors.\nIsland of the Dolls is listed as a tourist destination.\nThe Prip'y'at amusement park (Prip'y'at being the city/town which housed \nthe Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) is difficult to get to, and is often \nvery pricey. It's up to you to be as careful as you want. The mutations, \nlike listed elsewhere, are intriguing as well as quite horrifying, and are \ncaused by the radiation. It's said that there have been up to 600,000 fatal \ncases of cancer caused by the disaster. These are just facts to warn you.\nWinchester Mystery House- tourist attraction, open to public, but be sure \nto visit during hours. Aha.\nSan Zhi Resort, sadly, was completely demolished between December 2008 and \nearly 2010. The area is reportedly being transformed into a commercial \nresort/water park.\nHellingly Hospital is actually partially gone now. Only a few buildings are \nstill there.\nI've heard that the \"Silent Hill\" ghost mine is available to public but \nincredibly difficult to find due to the fog.\nMaunsell Sea Forts are difficult to reach but are known to be open to \npublic.\nThe Overturn Bridge is open to public, just has to be located and reached. \nThe church of bones is open to public for visitors. As any tourist \nattraction, it has a fee.\nAs does the Jewish cemetery.\nAnd lastly, Gunkanjima, more commonly known as Hashima island. It's \ndifficult to get to due to it being an island, but is open for public \nvisits.\n\nI hope I helped. Aha.",
