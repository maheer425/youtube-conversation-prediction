If they do hit puberty in their preteen years like most normal ppl \nthen by the time their 20 they might very well attempt rape... o_0 bcuz \nthey wouldn't know any better. Most ppl would completely rule out this \npossibility bcuz of his appearance, but don't forget that that *man* is 20 \nyears old, and if they really do hit puberty, then they have hormones in \ntheir body like everyone else, and being mentally handicapped, they \nwouldn't know any better but to attempt rape... It would be really sad if \nhe had to be registered as a sex offender in the last few years of his life \nhe has left, his family needs to completely isolate him from all sorts of \nmedia that portays even the slightest bit of sexuality... If he does go \nthrough puberty he might even target little girls bcuz of his own hi\ufeff",

I have dealt \nwith the \"bullying\" as in my eyes it is a lesson he needed regardless of \nhim actually having bullied anyone. Further more he is much too young for \nsocial media. He is not yet at a competent age of knowing the proper manner \nin which one should be handled. He is not old enough to yet distinguish \nwhen he might be offending someone. He is not yet old enough to realize \nthat all of our actions can and do have consequences. The reasoning for \nthis long post was to formally apologize to you and anyone offended by his \ncomment. The bigger reason is to suggest that you get off of social media \naccounts yourself.  Simply, Google requires you to be 13+ to open any \naccount with any part of its network. If you were so morally inclined at 10 \nyou would not have lied to open an account that of which you do not need at \n10 years old. I am offering some advice. Should you have trouble reading \nany of this or comprehending it, grab a parent or guardian.",

Personally, I think you proved your superiority as a human being \nfrom your discussion with Vidoes4Less, although, in terms of accurate \ninformation, I think he/she was right, this tiny person\u201ds brain hasn\u201dt \ndeveloped and it\u201ds really exaggerated to claim he can live on his own. In \nanswer to your question, it states in the video that he has strokes and \nbrain aneurysm. Given that fact only, he needs 24/7 supervision, so your \nidea of him living in a neighbor house can be easily considered as \ninefficient. Now, I agree with you that he is treated like a child and \nmaybe if he was treated more like an adult, he would at least develop \nmentally to the age of 10 let\u201ds say. But why is living like a child a bad \nthing? He is obviously happy. I mean, we think that being mentally \nnormal/mature is a good thing. We could be wrong. We  don\u201dt know what it\u201ds \nactually like because we never experienced mental \u201drecession\u201d as adults and \nwe only pity him or people like him because we know they are not healthy \nand normal. He could be happier than most of us.For example,  I think that \nthe childhood was the nicest period of my life and I felt the happiest. Of \ncourse, as you said, it\u201ds your opinion and also, it\u201ds not that absurd to \ntry to integrate him in the society. My opinion is that his family treats \nhim right. But I liked how you sustained your ideas with arguments, \nalthough I think that I could dismantle all of them if the both of us were \nat a public debate, let\u201ds say. :)",

Also I never said that they did not teach English; I did say \nthat they did not teach grammar or phonics.\n\nIn the 1980's there was a \"better\" way of teaching kids spelling then \nphonics but it was only taught in a few schools and only for a few years \nbecause they learned that it was doing kids more harm then good because \nthen they could not \"sound-out\" words like when taught the phonics system. \nAlso it was a military school in Texas so grammar was not a big deal. My \nEnglish class consisted of memorizing words and reading...that was it. The \nextra time that they saved doing it this way made it so that every single \nyear we could have Texas and US History classes starting in first grade \n(got to start brainwashing them young if you know what I mean.)\n\nIs there any other way that I can make you look like a fool?
