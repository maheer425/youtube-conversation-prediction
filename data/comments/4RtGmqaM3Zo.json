This has been a long dream, almost half of my \nlife. Any tips, for when I would go for it?*\n*=this text was originally before the following stupid text. If you want, \nyou can read it, and see if I could do it out there\n\nI taught it was impossible to travel the world, until I just accidentally \nfound this guy. I didn't know there were people travelling around the globe.\nIt has been a long dream to just wander the earth, without home nor \ndestination.\nI never even wanted to sleep in a 5 star hotel, or eat the most expensive \nluxury foods, I am not those people who need lots of expensive stuff all \nthe time to be happy, I've had this 50\u20ac used guitar for a bit over 1\u00bd a \nyear (one of my more recent purchases), and it still rocks. The small \nthings, like the Yogscast funny song going on the backroung while writing \nthis, make me *really* happy.\nI want to take my guitar, and travel, see wildlife, see cultures. I am just \n18 tho, so school, and can't leave yet, but when ever I could I would.\ufeff",

It's 1,600 words (ignoring time stamps) and you can download \nthe English captions file here: \nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1872630/lessons.rtf (Keep all time \nstamps intact and only change the text), and you can email them back to me \nat b@fi3m.com. Would appreciate it!\n\nOtherwise, to everyone else who liked this video, PLEASE share it on your \nFacebook wall!! I'd really appreciate it, because I think some of these \nwords are worth hearing for many people. It's a wonderful big world out \nthere and I feel so privileged to have seen even just a small fraction of \nit over the last decade.\n\nThanks so much for sharing my thoughts with the world!\ufeff",
