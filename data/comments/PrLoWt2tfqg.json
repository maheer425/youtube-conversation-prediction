If you are not Christian, \nI wish you Happy Holidays.\nIf you haven't heard, I will have a Christmas book come out next year. It's \nscheduled to be called \"Stories of Bethlehem\" and will be a collection of \nshort stories that I and some other people have written. They are all \nhistorical fiction from the story of the birth and youth of Christ.\nFor this Christmas season, I am sharing one of these stories with you so \nyou may share it with others as well. It is a story of the shepherds that \nwere visited by the angel announcing the birth of Christ and then their \nvisit to the stable.\nI hope you enjoy it. Please let me know what you think of this story and \nthen share with others but please let them know about the other stories \nthat are coming.\nDownload it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzy2d1y\n\u2026/A%20Shepherds%20Tale.pdf\u2026\nI am also sharing with you the Piano Guys' release of \"Angels We Have Heard \non High\" with David Archuleta, Peter Hollens, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, \nand a additional 1,000 member choir. This YouTube video is so moving.\nhttp://youtu.be/PrLoWt2tfqg\nI wish you and your family a wonderful Christmas.\nAll my best,\nBoyd Petersen\n\u202a#\u200eJesus\u202c \u202a#\u200eChristmas\u202c \u202a#\u200eJesusChrist\u202c\ufeff",

The very concept of \"the Bible\" did not even exist \nback then. Each sacred writing was its own book; they weren't compiled into \na collection until centuries later. In addition, John wrote the Gospel of \nJohn after he wrote Revelation. An overly-broad interpretation of the \nwarning at the end of Revelation would invalidate the most beautiful and \nprofoundly spiritual of the four Gospels!\n   I am sure that you are  a great person with a good heart too.

It was put last by councils \nlater on because of it's contents. The book of Revelation was written quite \na while before John's last epistle so by your very logic John himself would \nbe damned for \"adding\" to the \"word\" of God.  The facts I gave you are \nfacts, and in no way try to prove my religion but are used to show we have \njust as much reason to believe what we believe as you do. \nFurther the WORD, is logos in greek. Which denotes the expression of \nthought. NOT the name of an object. It is an embodiment of an idea, a \nrevelation. Then later in that verse the grammar changes slightly ,still \nlogos but the concept of the logos is altered to meaning the Personal \nexpression of thought as a title to the Son (Son of God) It is intended to \nbe taken as the evidence of his place in the Godhead.  \nThen the concept of the logos is altered to meaning the evidence of His \npower as the logos becomes possessive. \nBasically with the literal meaning of the language here it is NOT talking \nabout the Bible. It is not talking about the 66 canonical works being the \nONLY expression of Gods thought intended for man on earth having been \nspoken by Him and recorded by His prophets.That is NOT what it is, what it \nmeans or anything of the sort.\nHow it is to be understood is simply this: \"In the beginning was the \nperfect expression of thought. A revelation, a plan. This plan was with God \nand this plan has power in and of itself as the plan is the embodiment of \nHis son.\" Which we know the Savior was the plan, without Him there is \nnothing. \nThe Word is more than a personification of the Savior and has no reference \nto our Bible. \nI have already stated the facts of the Bible. It is a historical \ndocumentation which was compiled over of the course of years. Before they \nwere merely scrolls not a collective work as we see now. Therefore the \nother writings not included plus those continued writings of the 1st and \n2nd centuries should most certainly be considered as possible scripture as \nmany of those epistles were written by men who were students of the \nApostles themselves. In that light I believe it should be able to make \nthings clear. ",
