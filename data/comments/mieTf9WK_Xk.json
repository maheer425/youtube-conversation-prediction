Without proper physical and environmental \naccommodations, nutrition, socialization, and intellectual stimulus, \nprovided by people who understand them and their behavior, birds become \nincredibly stressed and unhealthy. They display self mutilation (such as \npulling out their feathers or smashing their beaks into bars) and mental \nillness. They're not in *any way* comparable to fish or cats and should not \nbe treated as such.",
