                    "text": "+Footy Fan Of course they do, but it's an issue when you have a population \nof 13% Blacks and the crime against Blacks by Blacks exceeds that of any \nracial group. That's the appalling part of it all. If Whites were a small \npercentage of 13% and committed the horrific everyday murderous crimes \nagainst each other, guess what? There should be an alarm and great concern \nabout that from other Whites. That is the issue and the main concerning \nissue is that Whites kill Blacks for just being Black now that Obama is in \noffice if you noticed the new trend now. This should make every Black man \nin America take a really hard look at themselves particularly the Sharptons \nand Messy Jacksons of the Black community and focus their anger towards the \nreal issue to Black issues. Hit it where the root is. \"Whites kill Whites \ntoo\". I know this already, but Whites also make up the highest number or \nwelfare recipients in this country yet Blacks, again a very small \npercentage in this country, are behind Whites in that by only 2%. Think of \nthese numbers here - 65% / 38%; 13% / 36%. These numbers almost a replica \nof the welfare ratio between Whites and Blacks, Whites representing the \nfirst set of numbers. I didn't even give you the murder ratio which would \nbe unbelievable and worse than the welfare one. The reason I point out \nBlack on Black crime is because sweetheart, Blacks are enemies of Whites in \nthe eyes of the Michael Dunns and George Zimmermans out there who are now \ntargeting Black males. If you already have a racial group targeting you and \ngetting away with murdering you, then why on earth would you be a Black \nperson helping the Dunns and Zimmermans out by murdering your own? That is \nmy point. Blacks don't murder Whites like Blacks murder Blacks. Blacks are \nalready discriminated against by many Whites in this country so other \nBlacks claim anyway. With all of this said, I find it hilarious how Blacks \ncontinue to focus on murdering each other rather than focus on who the real \nenemy is. ",

I'm a mixture of a bunch of different races, so no one can \npin point a specific one. There are some people that still have bitter \nhatred for the U.S. and they call me a \"Yanqui\". I have some Bolivian \nheritage, which is frowned upon by some and a few Porte\u00f1os have called me \n\"Negro\", while others tease me for having \"unclean blood\". I've been called \na \"Gringo\" in a friendly and belligerent way. Back at home, I've had white \nsupremacist douche bags not fully able to place me as one particular race, \nbut take liberties at trying to find a racial slur that fits. I even had \nsome people guessing I was Indian or Islamic, because of their need to \nclassify me as something.\n\nI don't reciprocate the hatred and I don't define myself by any particular \nrace, nor pay attention to my own family telling me to \"get in touch with \nmy roots\". It's all very stupid, and pointless. Racism exists in many \nforms, but it's best to not add to the problem.",

I'll tell ya, the same thing that \nhappens countless times each day in America that you bastards refuse to \nreport on. What Dunn did wrong was not waiting. At the very least, half of \nhis shots were NOT in self-defense... and that's even if you believe his \nstory (and no one including me believes him).\nDunn was pissed and aggressive too, that's why he was found guilty, he \nacted on that and it was the right decision to convict him. But I'd take \nthe odds and bet good money that had Dunn NOT had a weapon and the \nsituation unfolded the same way, the story of Dunn being beaten brutally \nwouldn't have ever made the news and is is highly likely that's what would \nhave happened... and you wouldn't be talking about it because it wouldn't \nget you any views. Even if you DID, I'd take another bet that you would \nSTILL somehow defend these black kids for no other reason than them being \nblack.\nThere really is no defense for Dunn. But on the OTHER subject, stop with \nthe cheerleading for blacks. In general, they ARE prone to violence, most \nespecially young men.

If you are going to cherry pick my statements at least \nhave the decency to get the full context of the argument.\n\nAt the end of the day no one does something just because they are black \n,white etc. they do it for more personal and individual reasons. To assume \na reaction involving values, attitudes, traditions or culture based on skin \ncolor is making an assumption with no proof that the individual will act or \nreact a certain way due solely to the fact that they are black.\n\nMy argument is that even if something is more popular in black communities \nthat you can't assume that all black people do it. That is the difference \nyou are not seeing.\n\n\"you keep talking about people being individuals, which obviously i agree \nwith; i've been arguing all along about general cultural characteristics \npertaining to groups. if you seriously don't believe those exist, there's \nnothing more i can say; but i think that's an untenable position.\"\n\nYou can't have your cake and eat it to. You cannot state that you agree \nthat all people are individuals and should be evaluated as such while at \nthe same time giving credence to the notion that it should be ok to not \nlike black people because you don't like aspects of black culture. \n\nI tried to make it very simple for you and reduce this to one single \nquestion: Does a person have a right to be a racist if they choose to do \nso. And if they do have that right then how can they express that in social \nor public sectors. I.E. Refusals of service or employment on racial grounds.\n\nI argue that you have a right to choose to be a racist and in which case \nsociety should choose to ostracize and belittle you. But we have laws on \nthe books in this country that prohibit such discrimination when it is \nacted upon in both the public and private sector. Because if and when we \ndidn't have such laws it caused major problems for the black community.  \nProblems that are still felt today and still have an impact on their lives \nin a very personal way.",

I would not call it a \"right\" \nbut in a way no one can prevent him from choosing to be a racist piece of \ntrash if he so chooses. I used \"Choose\" in that sentence twice because that \nis key to understanding to two sides of this argument. One side is choosing \nto hate the other side for one of two reasons, either he hates them for \nbeing black, or he hates them for having characteristics that he prescribes \nas being black characteristics. In either case he is wrong for the \nfollowing reasons:\n\nIf he hates them just because they are black then he is racist, by \ndefinition.\n\nIf he hates them because he hates their culture then that is racist as \nculture is a part of racial identity.\n\nIf he hates them because he hates uniquely \"black\" traits or \ncharacteristics then that makes him racist because he is using his \ndefinition of a \"black trait\" to project further traits and fears. In this \nfinal example it makes him short sited as he is attributing his hate to a \ntrait or characteristic that may not even be present in that individual \nperson.\n\nAt the end of the day the entire argument still comes back to his right to \nbe a racist. If he can have that right then I get to have the right to hate \nhim and all racists for their choices.\n\nAnd that is what makes me better than them. Racists hate people for things \nthat those people cannot change or choose to do differently while I hate \nracists for the specific choices they have made, namely the choice to be \nracist. That is how it is ok to hate a person for their personal choices \nversus things that individuals have no control over. This seems like the \npoint you have been trying to make the entire time, a justifiable right to \nnot like someone.\n\n\n\"you bring up the incarceration rate, and you mention targeting by police. \ni have no doubt that goes on; indeed, i have no doubt that there is \ndiscrimination and bias all the way up the judicial system; yet it is \nobvious that is not the whole story behind the higher incarceration rate. \ni'm sure you don't think that most incarcerated black people are \nunimplicated in criminality.\"\n\nNo they are not all completely innocent targets of a racist system but data \nshows that black people are no more likely to commit crimes than people of \nany other race however they do face punishments for those crimes at a much \nhigher percentage. Blacks use drugs for instance at the same percentage as \nthe population at large yet if you are black and use drugs you are more \nlikely to have a run in with the police than a white person. Look at New \nYork's stop and frisk policies before those were revoked and how much that \ntargeted young black men more than any other group.\n\n\"your question about the statistical threshold is the first time you've \nsaid anything relelvant and engaged, rather than emotional and indignant. \nsociological statisticians deal with these questions day in, day out, with \nagreed thresholds of statistical significance.\"\n\nWhy does every person defending a selfish or poor aspect of society always \naccuse the other side of arguing from emotion lol? This happens constantly \nin you tube comments. I listed several examples during this back and fourth \nand if anyone keeps reiterating that they are still correct in spite of \narguments to the contrary with no actual proof to back up your statements \nand claims it has been you.\n\n\"in your last paragraph you say that making generalisations accomplishes no \npurpose; but we assert general propositions about groups because we cannot \ndescribe social reality without doing so!\"\n\nBut you absolutely can. A person should construct their world view from the \nlitany of life experiences they go through and people they meet. Ideally \nyou will meet people of various cultures and customs and temperaments and \nuse that knowledge to be a more open minded and accepting person. Not \neveryone goes through that social maturation and education though. You \nsculpt your Some fervently object to that maturation (racists) and actively \nfight against it and for preserving something they view as unique or \nsuperior from their group.\n\n\"we advert to general facts about social groups because they evidently and \nobviously exist! get off your high horse and look at reality!\"\n\nNo they don't. People are individuals with their own traits, experiences \nand likes and dislikes.\n\nTake for instance a scenario where you every person you know has watched \nthe same TV Show. Can you from that information automatically assume that \nany new person you have met have also seen that show? Of course not.\n\nBut with race or cultural issues it is far more serious and can have far \nlarger repercussions on those people you meet.  If you are an employer that \nbelieves that black people are lazy then you will not hire any for your \ncompany. You are letting your incorrect assumptions affect the lives of \nother people for reasons they cannot change or affect.That is wrong, end of \nstory.",

                "text": "Two contributing factors. Mr Dunn's lack of respect for the lives of the \nyoung men and the young men's lack of respect for their elders. I have had \narguments with my elders and I usually say something about respect for my \nelders, it throws them off, but I mean it and it helps to lead to a \nresolution. There is an epidemic of a lack of respect for elders in today's \nsociety and it may be a contributing factor in these incidents.\nDunn was wrong as was Zimmerman, but if a grown up asks or even tells you \nto turn your music down, then it probably was too loud and kids should \nnever fathom raising their hands to an adult unless the adult is trying to \nput their hands on them first. The Zimmerman issue is a little more \ncomplicated, but the music thing is stupid, just turn the music down and \nthen blast it again once you start driving off. I just think that situation \nwas totally avoidable. \ufeff",

Believe me the bottom line is I am tired of seeing the people of \nmy community getting gunned down by these stand your ground folks. I do \nwonder what would happen if one of us stood our ground? I know about the \nsista in Florida, which is a jacked up state imo, for black folks. She got \njail time without even killing anybody. As I said earlier, I was merely \nspeculating if the situation could have been alleviated by a little \nrespect, but yes racism is what it is and it sucks. Yet those kids could \nhave been bigger men then Dunn in that situation which could have made him \nreally look more like an ass AND the young man might still be alive.\n I failed to mention not letting crazy a-holes get their hands on guns too. \nThat wasn't my point to list everything. I was combining two trends, the \nblazing lack of respect and failure to realize that these racist folks will \nshoot your azz with the trend of racist folks who will shoot your azz \nwithout giving it a thought.\nMaybe I am saying don't give them another reason because being black and \nyoung is probably already more than enough.",

That is a case of young folks knocking the \nhell out of anybody, elders included and you would think in that case there \nis a clear case of lack of respect for elders as the elder gets knocked out \nand is innocently just walking by.

Actually the origin of the word \nnigger doesn't mean human. It is an ancient Kemetian originated term that \nis misspelled and mispronounced by Europeans since 500 something b.c. or \na.d. It is actually \"neger\" or \"n-g-r\" which means God/Goddess or Black \nGod/Goddess. Africans have referred to their Black Gods as neger or n-g-r \nquite often during those times. The Europeans, like they've done to the \nswastika, stole the term and sullied it to use it as a virtual weapon \ntowards Blacks. I personally don't find the word nigger offensive at all \nbecause I am educated enough to know its real meaning behind it and for any \nWhite person to call a Black a nigger, they are just calling them a \nGod/Goddess. Blacks don't know this because they don't pick up books to \nactually read but instead take whatever Whites say as the truth. ",
