Is a shark evil because it constantly \nattacks and eats living animals? No, it has no such concepts. Is a flea \ncourageous because it hops towards danger to get it's meal from creatures \nfar larger and more powerful than it? No, it has no concept of fear. It has \nno feelings to overcome.\n\nWhat gets apologized and 'let slide' are things perceived as \"good for the \ngeneral public\" and things that are generally evil and \"not good for the \ngeneral public\".\n\nWhat actions do you sympathize with me. It's hard to sympathize with a \nterrorist who murders and maims people for reasons that defy logic. But you \ncan more easily sympathize with a drug dealer. Then there's other \nclassifications of drug dealers, while you might hate those that have no \nqualms selling to kids, you may have no problem with those that sell to \npoliticians and other high class clientele since they know what they are \ndoing to themselves and are probably more to blame than the drug dealer \nwho's out to make a living just like the rest of us.\n\nI've seen some people here just attack the idea we are discussing such \nthings, but these things are incredibly important. Politicians of all types \nprey on your fears hoping you don't stop and analyze what they are saying. \nYou have many people at one point calling the current president a \ncommunist, which is absurd. Communism is about violent revolution to bring \nabout change, is he going to hold a gun to his own head and to take over as \nleader of the country?\n\nSome people will like to talk about how anything that can be linked to \nNazis is just the slippery slope to being a Nazi, without knowing WHY or \nWHAT the Nazis did that made them so damn evil in the eyes of the world.\n\nIf you don't stop to examine what is wrong, what is right, and try to come \nup with ways to find out where the line should be drawn (and accept that \njust because it's deemed fine by today's standards, a saint by yesterday's \nstandards, and tomorrow might consider you a monster) how you plan to \ncritically think of moral quandaries you face on a day to day basis? What \ndo you support as \"yea, that should be punishable\" or \"No, that's wrong to \noutlaw!\"... do you just go with your gut feeling or do you examine it?",

I think that these views can be sometimes \nill-conceived, but such person is in no way as misguided as a nazi. \n\nThen for another example take your \"revolutionary\", \"class warfare\" \n\"marxist-leninist\", \"at least they built stuff\", socialist (but it also \nworks with a colonial imperialist or somebody like that). \n\nI think that both of these hypothetical persons can be equally prejudiced \nagainst different groups of people (classism instead of chauvinism). Both \nof their worldviews are considered extreme, but in most social circles, the \nfirst fellow will receive more disrespect, because Hitler. Yet, it would be \nfair to discredit both of these views equally, if they are equally filled \nwith prejudice. \n\nSo what do we do? We say \"Stalin killed more people than Hitler!\". And by \nthat, either we uncover a previously \"hidden\", potentially dangerous \nprejudice, OR we eliminate a pointless reductio and hitlerum argument. \n\nDetermining who was worse serves mainly an aesthetic purpose, so that we \nknow whether to say \"Stalin was worse than Hitler\", or \"Stalin probably was \nnot as bad as Hitler, but he still was terrible\". Ideally we want as strong \nstatement as possible (in this case, the first one), but only as long as it \nis true.\n\nI am not a follower of a nationalist ideology, and I don't intend to defend \nit.

I thought  -why is this? i \nfeel bad that i think and feel this. I guess its cause in africa, it seems \nafricans just dont seem to value life and each other, their fellow men, \nwomen and children, as much as westerners seem to, or, tbh - at ALL. To me, \nit seems life seems to have no value, or very little value to them. The \nones who suffer the most are, predictably, and as in every backward \ncountry/society (eg islam) women and children. the rape stats are truly \nhorrific. they kill children for \"witchcraft\". they kill and dismember \nalbinos for body parts for magic potions. albinos have to be buried in \nconcrete to stop body part theft after death. rwanda genocide - with \nmachetes! The list is endless, and anyway, my point is, i find it hard to \nattach the same value to africans (black) lives as westerners lives, or any \nother society/country/nationstate, that has a higher value of life. This \nsame \"logic\" (totally my own, and probably needs challenging) applies to \nthe middle east (parts of) under hardline conservative islamic sharia rule. \npeople executed, stoned, flogged, disfigured, amputated, for often \nimaginary crimes, or \"thought crime\" (to borrow orwell) type \"offences\". I \njust kind of automatically think - well, if they place little or no value \non their fellow lives and freedoms, then i place little or no value on the \nlot of them, and their rules, system etc. i DO really feel for the victims \ntho - women and children. like the lady in the mid east atm who has been \nraped and is now facing execution for sex outside marriage, plus 100 \nlashes, publically. So when disasters etc happen to these societies, eg \nhuge mudslides swallowing half villages, I kind of think - well - so what - \ngods granted them a favour, really.\nI DO expect a challenge on my thinking, Edith :)",

We are all agreed that it \nis better to draw the enemy on to this Island by striking at his vitals, \nand thus to aid the common cause.\"[93] Due to the inadequate British \nbomb-sights the strikes that followed \"had the effect of terror raids on \ntowns and villages.\"[92] On the night of 15/16 May, 96 bombers crossed the \nRhine and attacked targets in Gelsenkirchen. 78 had been assigned oil \ntargets, but only 24 claimed to have accomplished their \nobjective.[94][95][96] On the night of 17/18 May, RAF Bomber Command bombed \noil installations in Hamburg and Bremen; the H.E. and 400 incendiaries \ndropped caused six large, one moderately large and 29 small fires. As a \nresult of the attack, 47 people were killed and 127 were wounded.[97][98] \nRailway yards at Cologne were attacked on the same night.[98] During May, \nEssen, Duisburg, D\u00fcsseldorf and Hanover were attacked in a similar fashion \nby Bomber Command. In June, attacks were made on Dortmund, Mannheim, \nFrankfurt and Bochum.[94] At the time, Bomber Command lacked the necessary \nnavigational and bombing technical background and the accuracy of the \nbombings during the night attacks was abysmal. Consequently, the bombs were \nusually scattered over a large area, causing an uproar in Germany. \nFurthermore, on the night of 7/8 June 1940 a single French Navy Farman \nF.223 bomber attacked Berlin.[99] The attack occurred just days after \nGermany had bombed Paris.\nDespite the British attacks on German cities, the Luftwaffe did not begin \nto attack military and economic targets in the UK mainland until six weeks \nafter the campaign in France had been concluded.[92]\"\ncoventry my arse.",
