They operate exactly as normal humans apart from that.\"\n\nHere is where people don't understand what they are saying.  Your statement \nabove is not the cause but rather the effect of the psychopath looking not \nto feel from it's own body.  They actually feed off the feelings of others \nbecause they don't want to feel their own feelings.  This is not conscious \nit was developed from the pregenital stage.  The opposite sex parent is \nusually the one that is the issue with psychopathy.\n\nYour Statement:\n\n\"The motivation for this view is completely false. The reason the \npsychopath is always right is because his is the only emotions that are \nbeing taken into account.\"\n\nThe psychopath had sacrificed the creativity of their torso to go to the \nlaw of the head.  At the pregenital stage 3-5 years old the decisions the \nchild makes are beyond the no and boundaries this is the beginning of \nunderstanding right and wrong.  Because they sacrificed their pain in the \ntorso the right and wrong is replaced by \"I'm right and you are wrong\" this \nis really simple stuff how can you have blundered this so miserably?\n\nYour statement:\n\n\"I don't think you have the first clue what \"Hitler's position\" was. As I \nhave actually read Mein Kampf, I can tell you that we are talking about a \nperson who was convinced that the Jews were racially compelled to undermine \nthe Aryan civilization, which Hitler held to be the closest to the image of \nGod. He had both a self defense angle and a religious justification for \nsolving the problem of Jewish conspiracies. Neither is psychopathic. He \nalso had a personal element to the story as Hitler got gassed in the \ntrenches during WW1 and he blamed the fact on Jewish opposition to the war, \nwhich prevented quick victories.\"\n\nSo you read Mein Kampf what does that mean?  Nothing!  Isn't it interesting \nthat the torso is also where The Spirit dwells and if a pregenital trauma \nof a child sacrifices it's torso for the \"I'm Right you are wrong\" of the \nhead they need to establish some sort of justification of religion.  In \nessence your argument actually and perfectly proves my point.  You can read \nmy studies on the pregenital stage trauma and why israel has no peace they \ntie in perfectly why Hitler did what he did.  Hitler was digging into the \nfeminine energy of the east that is why he used the swastika which is an \nindian sanskrit symbol.  This is also why he wanted to create an aryan race \nand then justify it with religion because he sacrificed his own Spirit by \ngoing to the head.  Easily understood when you understand psychopathy. \n That is why the psychopath wants to be a judge because they want to take \nthe role of God.  That is how high their head is in the clouds.  In the \nBible The Jews were told they were the head and not the tail so long as \nthey obeyed God and when they didn't God made them the head.  The feminine \nenergy Hitler was looking at would clearly want to destroy the head.  That \nis why he also burned all the books and killed the intellectuals.  He was \nkilling the heads.  \n\nYou need to read history better.  The Jews that caused the first \nJewish-Roman war did that because their messiah didn't come to the temple \nafter the temple was completed for two years and they were convicted within \ntheir soul they were wrong.  Jesus told them to pay their taxes and \nremember Israel was a client state of Rome they were allowed to expand the \ntemple in Herod's day, the temple that took a tremendous amount of \nresources and allowed the jews to complete the temple.  Then they didn't \nwant to pay 17 talents of Gold to the Romans.  The Bible recorded the \npriests saying they had no king but caesar and now caesar (Romans) needed \ntax money.  So the Iscarii and the Zealots provoked the Romans in a war \nthey would have never won.  They were jews killing each other while the \nRomans waited for them to finish before attacking them near Jerusalem.  By \n70 AD the temple was destroyed and 1.1 million jews were either killed or \nsold as slaves.  The remaining Iscarii then fled to Masada where the Romans \ncame to finish cleaning up the rebellion and the Iscarii ended up killing \neach other and then finally the last person committed suicide.  Some people \nlook at this as martyrdom.  However the darker side of this is that the \ndumb Iscarii rabbi leader said:\n\n\"Since we long ago resolved never to be servants to the Romans, nor to any \nother than to God Himself, Who alone is the true and just Lord of mankind, \nthe time is now come that obliges us to make that resolution true in \npractice...We were the very first that revolted, and we are the last to \nfight against them; and I cannot but esteem it as a favor that God has \ngranted us, that it is still in our power to die bravely, and in a state of \nfreedom.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elazar ben Yair\"\n\nBy the way if they read the old testament God said to go into Babylon and \nwait...  So you can clearly see these Iscarii were true psychopaths!!!\n\nHere is where this really gets interesting the most famous Iscarii is JUDAS \nISCARIOT who betrayed Jesus and KILLED HIMSELF!  Sounds a lot like Masada \nIscarii to me.  You see the Romans didn't sin killing the jews on Masada \nthe jews sinned their own laws and killed each other.  This is why people \ndon't realize what they are saying because they don't understand The Bible. \n The Iscarii glorified themselves in killing themselves.  Suicide is the \nheight of psychopathy.  To have WILL over your own self.\n\nSomeone that can say the Romans were to blame but really now if you live in \nthe united states and Hawaii wanted to stop paying taxes and kill other \namericans wouldn't the united states send the army to stop the rebellion? \n YES THEY WOULD.\n\nLet me tell you the future.  National Israel does not have access to The \nDome of The Rock.  They will look to blow it up someway so they can justify \nthe temple mount.  If they do that and the Muslims attack and destroy \nIsrael.  What would be the cause and effect?  \n\nMy answer is The Iscarii and Zealots who have a miserable understanding of \nThe Bible will cause countless deaths of their own people.  History repeats \nitself again...  \n\nPraise I AM, \nMichael Idarecis",

He \nalso had a personal element to the story as Hitler got gassed in the \ntrenches during WW1 and he blamed the fact on Jewish opposition to the war, \nwhich prevented quick victories.\n\nMoreover, these were not only Hitler's beliefs. Christians have been \nmanufacturing conspiracy theories about the Jews since the first century. \nLook up things like \"blood libel\" and \"the wandering Jew\". Christians have \nalso performed periodic Jew cleansings in Europe although they have had \nsmaller scope than the Holocaust. Hitler's beliefs actually were mainstream \nand that's why he was able to attain power. There are even examples of \nplaces like Austria where the local population started lynching the Jews \nbefore the Nazi troops arrived. You literally have to hold that \"Almost 50% \nof Europe were psychopaths\" during WW2 to defend your thesis.\n\nIt's worse though, because if you go back 100 years more, you'll find that \nmost countries in Europe had anti-Jewish legislation as official policy. \nFor example, even relatively modern constitutions like that of Norway, from \n1814, has as its second statement, after declaring that Norway is a \nsovereign nation, that Jews and Jesuits don't have access to the kingdom. \nAnd that's viewed as a very progressive constitution in many ways. The idea \nthat there was something special about Hitler's psychology is laughable and \njust involves avoiding taking responsibility for the fact that produced the \nholocaust - 2000 years of Christian antisemitism, lies and slander against \nthe Jews.",

You should probably look \nup the term \"Compatibilism\". It goes back to the Stoics in ancient Greece - \nat least(it's probably the first view of responsibility and agency humans \nhad, because the animals we evolved from most certainly don't worry about \nfree will). Sam Harris etc add no new thoughts to that discussion beyond \nthe connection to neuroscience.\n\nYour obsession with free choice is actually a problem that doesn't arise in \nany other context than monotheisms with judging creator gods who also \nclaims to be moral. That is, some interpretations of Christianity and \nIslam(Ones that don't just embrace determinism and a divine command theory \nof morality). That situation creates a problem, because the apparent \ndeterminism of the natural world seems to not make humans morally \nresponsible vs the God who set it all in motion. That's the origin of the \nlogical contradiction \"libertarian free will\". It is not a property of \nreligion in general, just your type of religion. Which, amusingly, is just \nthe kind of religion that historically has led the charge for worldwide \ndomination and imperialism. Hardly a good moral role model even in practice.\n\nIn any case, humans make choices under naturalism as well. We just \nrecognize that those choices are a consequence of natural laws operating on \nalready existing personality constraints in people's brains. So if you \ndecide to rape a little girl merely because the image of said little girl \nfalls on your retina, we are going to conclude that you are a dangerous \norganism, because you exhibit that behavior and because you made that \nchoice. In a sense, we'd be punishing you because you are \"you\" and the \n\"you\" makes such decisions.The determinism means we can be confident that \nyou would repeat your actions unless we intervene in some way. If we really \nbelieved your past actions have no relationship to your future actions, or \nwhat's going on around you, then we'd have no reason to punish you or \npraise you for anything. Under the deterministic model, we do this to \nencourage or discourage your behavior though, such that you meet with \ndesirable or undesirable consequences which will feed back into your \ndecision making apparatus and causing you to learn to behave better.",

Actually have done a lot \nof thinking in the past when reading The Bible 7 times and my conclusions \nwere miserably wrong.  They would parallel what is taught today maybe a \nshade different here and there.  However in the last 7 years have a \ndifferent understanding not founded on choice.  Choice is what all the \nreligions teach.  Choice is the ability to have dominion on something to be \nable to make a decision on whatever is in view.  Similar to buying brand A \nor B at a supermarket.  That is the concept of God to most the world.  Man \nmakes an action however that then brings them to a dead god.  God had said \nGod is the God of the LIVING not the dead.  The dead being dead in their \nfree will understanding.  The eyes of Adam and Eve that can only see the \nlie and have no way to choose the truth.  That is why God has to make one \nbelieve upon the truth.  That is why direct people to my website where by \npulling out parallels from The Bible that trump understanding being taught \ntoday.  It is kind of like when Moses was dealing with the magicians and \nthey didn't show their face to Moses because they had boils upon their \nfaces from God through Moses.\n\nThe point is there is no convincing argument for God to change someone's \nmind because God has to connect the person's head with God's Spirit.  That \nis not my endeavor.  My endeavor is to write about whatever God reveals. \n Like had said to scientists in the past \"you better pray God doesn't give \nyou the convincing argument outside of God's anointing because that will \nend up being your judgment\".  Man's head can't bring man to God so if man \ndoes finally see by the head through some proof that is not from within \nthen that is judgment upon the person.\n\nActually at parties everyone gets a kick out of me.

For instance, I would genuinly feel empathy towards a \nperson if I were to kill him. It certainly does trigger an emotion. I \nwould, however, have no trouble at all killing a baby-hitler if there were \nno consequences. This is because I couldn't live with myself knowing I let \nemotions run my decisions and eventually cost the lives of millions of \npeople. I think it's a terrible thing to not be able to overcome your own \nemotions. In my opinion, people who are unable to make such decisions are \namong the most ego\u00efstic people I know since they value their own emotional \nexperience above other peoples lives.\ufeff",

If has made it as an artist we would not \nhave the obscene slaughter of so many innocent people. I remember a film \nabout the last days of Hitler starring German actor Bruno Ganz (the title \nescapes me at the moment) and a public complaint that Hitler was too \n\"human\".

It seems as if some wish to believe \nthat Hitler was not even of our species....perhaps summoned forth from the \nchurning pits of hell...never having been born, never a baby, never even \nbeening in love at some less corrupt moment in his life. For lesser or \ngreater a variation of Hitler will always periodically pop up to poison the \nworld. I am fascinated about Germany of that period and how he seduced \nsupposedly sane people to do the evils he willed and a larger population to \nignore the atrocities happening in their own town. The power of evil is \nsometimes amazingly seductive.....who has the real corage to stand outside \nof the mob and disagree and be aware of the potential consequenes.

I began a book called The Hitler \nYouth about the way propeganda turned sane people into mindless followers. \nIt is fascinating how easily mob mentality can be manipulated. But Hitler \nexploited the defeat of WW1 for his own evil benefits. For their undying \nlove for this lunatic the German people suffered. I especially hated how \nthe words of Nietzsche were being twisted to support the idea of the Nazi \nsuperman. I have read virtually all of Nietzsche's works and find his \nthoughts and ideas sobering and hopeful and he would not have support such \nanamalistic regression.",

A cursory study of history will show \nconclusively that psychopathic leaders recreate the chaos in their own \nminds, and externalize this chaos onto their followers, with disastrous \nresults for those they lead, and for themselves.\n\nThe point is, Kevin, that we don't need to approach psychopathy by creating \nimpossible scenarios. We have enough real-life scenarios of psychopaths, \nand how the choices they have made have left entire societies in ruin.\n\nJust name one single, solitary psychopath whose behavior resulted in a \npositive outcome, a net gain for society. Just one will do.\n\nIf you have ever been the victim of a psychopath, you know these people are \nincorrigible and incapable of being \"cured\" or \"helped.\" They leave a trail \nof destruction wherever they go.They need to be held accountable for their \ncriminal behavior, not glorified.\ufeff",

Actually, nobody has zero empathy, people just \nhave varying levels of it.  If it seriously begins to affect decision \nmaking then you are not a psychopath.  That means if your judgement is \nclouded by what you believe to be the 'humane' course of action then you \nare probably not a psychopath.  To put it simply psychopaths take the most \nlogical decisions.  People who have loads of empathy make poor leaders and \ntend to have terrible decision making ability because their decisions are \nclouded by their empathy.  For example, a leader had a choice to make: \n either 1) The entire country of people dies, but not his family or 2) his \nwhole family dies, and only his family.  A psychopathic leader would allow \nhis family to die.  The so called non psychopath would tend to abandon his \nduty and the country he loves because he loves his family more. \n\nIn your case yes he is the psychopath but no that doesn't make him evil. \n People with high levels of empathy don't tend to go round killing people \nwhatever the reason.",

From the year 1000 AD to the 1700's and \neven today, Islam has been taking lives in South Asia.\nChristianity as a religious doctrine is no where near as destructive as \nIslam.\nI would however would need to kill Cortez, some Popes, etc.\nBut Christ as a leader would not need to be killed.

If he decides to do so, it should be done \nout of his free will and not viewed as any other person's choice to make. \nHitler on the other hand IS morally responsible for all the deaths \ncommitted in his name, therefore I think a decision to take his life* would \nbe morally more valuable than one to let million other innocents die...

                "text": "While it seems like the obvious answer to stop Hitler in some way and \nprevent the horrors of the Holocast... in truth, Hitler's actions were a \nmuch needed event in the wake of modern history.\n\nHear me out, it has nothing to do with Anti-Semitism or hatred or lesser \npeoples.\n\nHitler's actions were a wake-up call for the world, in showing just how \ndangerous it was for any one person or group to have complete control and \nallowing them to have free reign, and to allow bigotry and hatred to run \namok and unrestrained. It mattered little that people like the Jews, \ninnocents themselves, were the victims, if it weren't Hitler, someone else \nmay have come along and done the same to them or to someone else on a \nsimilarly massive level... or worse, they wouldn't have done so to the \npoint it garnered the reaction the Holocaust did.\n\nIf so, they would have never prompted the creation of things like the \nGeneva Convention, and dictate what can or cannot be done in war, and set \nin stage the modern era where countries have to answer to one another or \nface alienation from the entire world.\n\nThe world began truly policing it's own following the atrocities of the \nSecond World War, and the combination of the Holocaust and the horrific \nafter-effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were enough \nto prompt the world's undivided attention. It made them realize that enough \nwas enough, and a line had to be drawn in what was reasonable in conflict.\n\nThe people who died from the Holocaust and from the War did not die in \nvain, beyond Hitler failing in conquering the world, their deaths brought \nto light the darker side of humanity and forced us all to confront it, \nwhether we liked it or not.\ufeff",

England, the biggest super power of the world (then) \nwas already doing what Germany was about to do (slaughtering and burning \npeople alive, aka Holocaust), but much more discretely. England conquered \ncountries in the Name of colonization and then enslaved the peoples and \nkilled those who resisted. But when Germany decided to do the same, a World \nWar took place.. But, they only teach us about Hitler and the brutal \nkilling of an entire people.. No mention of the peoples that were being \nkilled before.. \nWWII was pretty much the same thing, only that instead of protecting the \nEnglish Empire, we ended up creating a new Empire, on top of the ashes of \nthe city-victims of the atomic bombs, the American Empire. The US managed \nto benefit a lot from the second world war, which they created, and with \nthe Cold war, after annihilating the British Empire, they also destroyed \nthe Soviet Union. \nSome pretty basic stuff you ought to know about the WWs.

Don't you NEED history in order \nto have present? Or do you imply that there are some historical events or \neven periods of time, that did not take part in the creation of what we \ncall \"present\"? If so, you are awfully wrong. Every little piece of \nhistory, every war, every revolution, every child birth, everything \n(historically) up until now has been a part of what we call \"presnt\" and \nwhat we call \"reality\". The present consists of the past. All of it. If you \nchoose to change the past, no matter how drastic that change is, you will \nchange the present. (assuming such a thing is possible)\nFirst of all, Hitler and his actions were not caused by Hitler alone. There \nwere many factors that contributed into the creation of a Nazi Germany and \na lot more factors that contributed into the beginning of the World War(s). \nIf you actually believe that Hitler's intentions were to simply rule the \nworld and the world war was a battle between \"good\" and \"evil\", then you \nare wrong (again). The powers that led the peoples from all around the \nglobe into killing each other, in the name of \"justice\" and \"freedom\" (or \nw/e they pretended to protect), didn't give two shits about the world \nitself and it's welfare. They only cared about their very own interests and \nprofits and how to protect these. It's no wonder the US became a \nsuperpower, the biggest superpower, after WWII. It's obvious that it used \nthe War in order to gain control over the other countries (The US achieved \nthat with the TOTALLY unnecessary bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's \nquite obvious that Japan had no means to threat the US forces, without navy \nor airforce and that it was about to surrender, especially since the USSR \ndecided to join the fray). If there's ONE thing we learned from the world \nwars, that is to murder, destroy and manipulate without costs and risks of \nan all-out war. That's what we now call \"Neo-libertarianism\".",

If you won't do it out of \nfear of guilt, then you are making it so that your guilt is worth more than \nthe lives of whatever amount would die. If you are doing it out of fear of \na damp in your reputation, then your reputation is worth more than those \nlives. If out of fear of the self-loathing or whatever state of mind of, \nthen once again, your making it worth more than those lives. If it is \nbecause it is against everything you believe, but you know that it is the \nright thing and still don't do it, then you are putting what is false and \nwrong of more worth than those lives.

No.\nAssuming that I know enough of the future to see what this baby would \nbecome, I would also have the clairvoyance to see what would become, if the \nbaby DID NOT live.\n\nI'll give a fictitious example. The question was addressed in the game \nfranchise Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Einstein invents a time machine, \nand erases Hitler from history. The disruption of European powers allows \nthe rise of Joseph Stalin, and his takeover of Europe. There's some info on \nStalin on his Wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_stalin\n\nBut long story short, without Hitler's Nazi Germany to stand in the way, it \nis probable that the USSR would have at least attempted to invade the rest \nof Europe, never mind what the USSR actually DID invade around that time, \nand the massive famine that resulted from Stalin's forced conversion of the \nUSSR from an agrarian economy into an industrialized one. Think of how much \nworse it would have been if Stalin was able to continue his conquest.\n\nOf course, if Hitler didn't persecute the Jews, then we're faced with a \ndifferent scenario, The modern nation of Israel would never have been \nformed, we wouldn't have Jews and Christians squatting in the middle east, \nprovoking much retaliation from the Islamic community. Not to say that \nIslamist extremism wouldn't still be a problem, it would just be less of \none. The USSR would probably do a good job of keeping Islam out of Europe \nentirely, with the cost of trading one tyranny for another.\n\nOf course, it is mere speculation. It is impossible to predict reliably how \none party would have reacted without the other to keep the first in check.\n\nSo we're left with one evil, and another just as bad. The moral of the \nstory is: Don't try to change history, but learn from it, so you don't \nrepeat it.\ufeff",

With \nlikely a V3 version able to travel much further being an option if... \nwell... the whole \"fuelled by crystal meth\" thing the Germans were doing \ndidn't have a time limit of functionality. American space travel was \ncreated by captured nazi scientists who were given jobs.\n\nAs per the Atomic Bomb... Einstein was German. There were also other \nScientists working on that stuff--however the \"being all hopped up on Meth \nand moving as quick as possible at people\" tends to be terrible for proper \nresource management. Very good for territory aquisition... but horrid for \nmanaging those territories. The couldn't build an atomic bomb... but rest \nassured, had Hitler not been born, the chance whoever was in charge during \nWW2 instead would have built one increases.\n\nAnd no idea what you are on about with racial discrimination. People hated \nJews and Roma LONG before World War 2. If anything, when the Nazis started \nto lose, and decided, \"let us dispose of the evidence by killing all this \nslave labour\"... the rest of the world sit back and could not answer how \nthey would not do the same thing. Jews were universally hated at the \ntime--that is why the Nazis could easily displace the hatred onto them.\n\nHell, the whole issues in the Middle East were pretty much a side effect of \npeople going, \"oh shit... we don't want to look like we hate the Jews... as \npeople who hate Jews Jew Gas them in the Auschwitz Bake Ovens... and \nthat... is a bit of a faux passe. Wait... Jews have a holy land right? \nWell, out of sight, out of mind right? Round up all the Jews out of their \nghettos and send them to Gaza... which isn't a ghetto if we call it their \nholy land!\"... which would have worked too--not from a bunch of kids and \ntheir dog... but the fact was people were kind of living in Isreal... and \nthe entire world, making an effort to pretend they didn't hate the fuck out \nof the Jews--but not wating to actually have to look at them, pressured \nthem to go to Gaza-Ghetto... I mean... Gaza... totally not a ghetto, don't \nthink of it as a small place for all of one undesirable to live... it is... \nuh... a holy land... TOTALLY a holy land.\n\nIn the 1950s, much of the bullshit Jews had to put up with was no longer \nthe usually being killed in the forest, hunted down, bullied and all that \nother fun stuff we like to pretend we never did... but having people \npressure them into going to Isreal. Being downright fucking jerks, to try \nto indicate they are more welcome in Israel... so they should go there... \nthe belong in Israel... it is nicer there.\n\nIf anything, I'd argue (terribly) that WW2 resulted in less hate towards \nthe Jews overall... the Roma however? People still hate the fuck out of \nthem. Practicing Homosexuals people have calmed down against. Communists we \njust look at them all silly when they talk about Finland, Iceland and \nnorthern Europe as USSR did not work--so universal health care is stoopid, \nthey are stupid! The Mentally Ill--people are still dicks to the Mentally \nIll... it hasn't changed from WW2. And well, Political Dissendents? They \nare okay... it is okay if you have a Mental Illness that has you against \nour glorious leader--it is not your fault you are retarded.\n\nIf anything... the sheer incompetence of Hitler hasn't really put us that \nfar back... it kind of was beneficial. In fact people in midwestern towns \ncan take some of the stuff he made big and sell it for money. I'm not \ntalking about racism (that is going away)... I'm talking about Crystal \nMeth... the drug that powered the master race.",
