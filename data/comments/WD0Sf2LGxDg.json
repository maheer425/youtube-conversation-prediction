I for one give think that the book is amazing, it's such \na good book its actually my favorite book, well the series is my favorite \nseries.\ufeff",

Let is take a classical riding crop. In a shop \nfor horse riders you get decent ones for 10$-15$, a sex shop will ask for \n45$-60$, and that gap is fairly typical, can even be higher ;) Paddles you \nfind at Ikea (kitchen supply , for example the metal pancake turner with \nrubber sheeting, I love em ^^)\nI buy a lot on DIY hardwarestores , home improvement centers and arts and \ncrafts stores. If you go through them with open eyes you think they would \ncater mostly to us kinky;) \nOh, and I love top use plastic wrap for bondage, the kind you use for food, \nthat sticks  on itself through adhesion, but doesn't stick to other stuff. \nYou can do wonderful things with that. For stiffness simply use bamboo \nsticks you wrap with in, or furniture ^^\n\nAs a kinkster you need to be creative, and you will have tons of fun ;)",

If you want to see his acting talent watch the \nBBC The Fall with Gillian Anderson you will be blown away and shocked how \ngood he is. Jamie did get a tone of fans when signing up to do 50 Shades \nbut I find some are due to his pretty face. Ok I have read the books not my \nthing as I am not into romance novels, yes that is what they are romance \nwith a bit of kinky sex (BDSM is NOT violence against women its those who \nlike pain and pleasure) instead of boring run of the mill sex. Jamie \nmentioned in a interview that yes he isn't doing full frontal but you can \nsort of see things and his back is just as sexy. Jamie also stated the film \nis a \"adaption\" of the book not the book itself, lets face it the book was \nbadly written. I can see what James was trying to do but she is no prize \nwinner. Will I see it at the theaters I don't know BUT being a fan of Jamie \nI might. IF you think 50 Shades is porn obviously you have never watched \nporn. Its more of erotic romance then anything. If you read the book you \nwould know Christian doesn't do anything without Ana's decision and wanted \na contract first. Danielle Steele's books get made into movies because she \nmarried a tv exec and those are shit.\ufeff",

Sorry was commenting \nat like 2 in morning.\n\n2. I myself have not read the books. However, on the subject of movies that \nchanged the books there are some movies that are nothing like the book. \nLook at the shining. It changes who dies and what happens. Hell the ending \nof the movie is drastically different. Just putting it out there. That \nbeing said I doubt the movie will change that much. It's seems to me like a \nshameless cash grab based off the books popularity.\n\n3. I wasn't being sarcastic. I realize it may have sounded that way, but \nfor the sake of intelligence be aware that it makes you seem kind of \nchildish. I'm not saying I agree with it, but that's the stigma of the \nhashtag.\n\n4. I have not read twilight either. I tend to gravitate more to film than \nbooks, so I may be a bit biased. In all honesty that comment was not my \nbest. I just feel that a film shouldn't have pre-reading to get the most \nout of it. I agree that reading is something that drastically changes from \nperson to person as it is affected that person's imagination, however \nmovies to me feel a bit more sedimentary. A bad movie is bad you can really \ndissect it and figure it out. A bad book is kind of hard to define \nsubtracting bad grammar and poor writing (things that usually get fixed in \nediting). For example I liked the Da Vinci Code, however its to my \nunderstanding that that writer (Dan Brown I believe) is not very good. At \nthis point in development of this movie I can't really say whether its good \nor bad. I just have low expectations, because of how ,for lack of a better \nterm, cash-grabby it feels.",

Welcome to the internet and 21st century so glad you could join us. \nHashtags are used for nearly every social media application--you pointing \nout my hashtag doesn't help you case either #sorrynotsorry\n\n4.

They are in fact the same so \nthe brick/mineral analogy doesn't make sense. People who read the book may \nhave different experiences than the movie.

It was under the name \"master of the universe\" on \ntwilighted.net. It is more than inspired really, the author writes almost \nthe exact way as Stephenie Meyer. Not on purpose I think, must be because \nshe read the books so many times that her writing style took a very similar \napproach to how she describes her environment and how the characters \ninteract with the world she created. Many twilight fanfictions have been \nturned into books over the years, but I just fail to see why this was the \none to become the best seller. Because so many of the fanfiction authors \nare really talented, and deserve to publish original work of their own. I \nlove \"trashy\" and over the top romance novels, but this was a pain to read \nbecause it was... well, not very well written. Too repetitive, very shallow \nand blank character description, painfully hollow personalities, not very \nsurprising turns, and again: the writing. Ugh. That's my number one pet \npeeve with these books, I very rarely read books that annoys me just \nbecause of the way sentences are put together, but this does the trick and \nthen some more. ",

                "text": "It features an emotionally abusive man preying upon an insecure young woman \nand calls it a relationship. Christian Grey is an abuser. He is emotionally \nunavailable, emotionally abusive, and sexually exploitative. His complete \ndisregard for his partner\u2019s comfort, experience, and emotional well being \nare contemptible: he gets his pleasure at the expense of his partner.\nBut somehow, emotional unavailability translates into an ineffable \nsexiness; lack of care turns Christian Grey into some sort of sexual \ndemigod. He throws a sexually inexperienced woman headfirst into the depths \nof what takes a great deal of trust and intimacy to safely establish, and \ngives her neither. This is not the basis of BDSM. While power certainly \ncomes into play, as it does in all relationships, BDSM is not about using \nand abusing power over someone in order to get off. It is not about abusing \nsomeone\u2019s trust or someone\u2019s body.\nBDSM is about mutual care, mutual pleasure, and mutual respect. A healthy \nand safe relationship that involves BDSM requires all the things that any \nhealthy and safe relationship requires: trust, intimacy, vulnerability, \nrespect. Allowing your partner to control your body during sex demands deep \ntrust. Bondage, discipline, submission\u2014all of these things are highly \nintimate acts. And most importantly, BDSM is based on consent.\n50 Shades of Gray is saying that it's okay to treat women as merely objects \nfor their sexual pleasure and that it's 'sexy' and 'kinky' to abuse them \nphysically, emotionally and mentally. This book and movie are toxic to \nsociety and should be viewed as that. This is a poorly written, mediocre \nbook that should never have been published. What a shame.\ufeff",

I cannot believe that \nmillions of people on Valentine's Day went to see this thing and call \nthemselves civilized and of higher intelligence. Emotionally stable females \nare smart enough to know the differences. A friend is very into this movie \nand the books, she pretends to be emotionally ok  and she looks happy but \nshe was also abused when she was a kid sexually and she is taking drugs for \ndepression. I wonder how many people who answer to you post cursing or \ndisagreeing with you went through abuse as well, emotional, mental, or even \nphysical. I bet most if not all of them. Those people vote and they \nprocreate as well. This is highly alarming in my opinion. People like her \nhave the need to go out and yell how free they are abusing others or being \nabused is the new sexy. No, this is not sexy, this is plain sick because \nsuch people are just an emotional mess. Such people are not to be trusted \nwith things, people who tend to be abusive or like to be abused in their \nemotional relationships they highly tend to be abusive in nature \neverywhere, such as workplace, friendships etc... I would avoid such people \nat all costs.  Nothing good can come from their mind set.",

                "text": "I'm astonished at all the entirely negative reviews by men. In fact, I \nthink it's the same kind of hate that men who are successful with women \nreceive from other men (the jealous ones). Remember that this is a movie, \nand it's meant to be enjoyed by the appropriate audience, and not to be \nwatched by people who don't care about erotic romance. \n\nThis is CERTAINLY NOT porn, if it was, more men would actually like it. So, \nif that was the case, this would be widely popular by men and a great \nexcuse for a man to go watch it with their \"romantic\" partner.\n\nWhat this IS - IS a BDSM relationship, which are relationships based on \nTRUST and surrender from one party to another. And it is expected to be \nfrowned upon by people who don't understand the fundamentals of that \nrelationship.\n\nI read all three books in the series, done in-depth character studies, and \nfound this story to be popular because it hits the major fantasy points \nthat dwell in the heads of A LOT of women. Let's face it, the way our \nsociety has gone, men have become weaker - and sometimes women miss a man \nwho can roll the dice and show some self-control, as is demonstrated by the \nBDSM relationship - which requires a TON of control from the DOM/DOMME - in \norder to maximize the line between pain & pleasure for the submissive.\n\nIt requires a strong man to recognize what a woman really wants and to be \nable to provide it with complete selflessness. It's not always about your \nown pleasure, but to cross the border into euphoria by creating unknown, \nyet pleasurable sensations.\n\nChristian Grey struggles with a completely jacked up past, much like we all \ndo. When I read this story, I could relate to some of the things he felt, \nsome of his thoughts, and why he believed the things he did. And it took \nhis love for a woman and her love for him, in order for him to drop false \nbeliefs about himself that were created in his youth. \n\nJust like I believe that we can all be empowered to change regardless of \nour past, sometimes it takes something as powerful as love to push us over. \nThat's all this is - and to me, that's everything.\n\nAnd yes, I'm a straight male (completely secure with my sexuality). So I \ndon't mind sharing my somewhat objective views on this matter.\ufeff",

But a woman \nwho has many men is still considered a slit, while a man with many women is \nconsidered a real playboy in a positive way.\nThat a women just goes for a man is frowned upon in many societies, she has \nto wait for the man to make the move, and then she has to play hard to get \nor is considered a slut. She can't just say, hey i am horny, let us get up \nto my room or her reputation would be wrecked in many societies.\nI could go on with many more examples, but I think you see the point. Women \nare supposed to hide their lust, and act as if they have sex because the \nman wants it. They let the men have sex, they put out, all these \nformulations are supposed to show us that sex for a women is just something \nshe does for the  man. Know what I mean ?\nIn a rape fantasy she does not have to think about things like \"did I make \nit to easy for him\" \"did  put out to quick\" \"is sex on the third date too \nearly\" etc.etc. wiomen constantly have to think about their reputation, so \nthey are not considered sluts. In a rape scenario all these worries are \ngone, since she is not in control. She can just let go and enjoy without \nany repercussions or bad feelings afterwards, since it was not her choice",

At one point she even normalizes rape.\n\nI read that there was a whole genre of books where the man violently rapes \na woman and they end up together. Then I read that feminists don't speak \nout about them, don't boycott them. No they BUY them. The damn things fly \noff the shelf. That this is a woman's fantasy.

I still believe that there are always going to be exceptions, and \nmay even see it as an opportunity or excuse to abuse someone.\"\n\nOf course you can find abusive assholes everywhere, even in the BDSM scene, \nbut we take great care to exclude these people. You see in our scene it is \ncompletely normal to ask people about their ex-partners in intimate \ndetails, to be able to screen people before you do something with them. \nThat is a great way to keep out the riff raff.\nOf course no system is perfect, and for obvious reasons we are attractive \nto certain abusers, but we take great care to police our own. Some peoople \nthink a submissive women would simply do everything you want, but people \nlike that are easy to spot with experience.\nIf new people come to our meetings, they are usually screened by a few more \nexperienced members of the community. We simply talk to them try to feel \nthem out. If they are fishy, we politely ask them to leave. So we take \nevery precaution possible to get rid of abusive assholes before something \nhappens. OF COURSE this is not perfect, but as I said, you can meet people \nlike that everywhere, only that we take way more precautions then anybody \nelse to discover them and get rid of them,.\nAlso, our scene is quite small, so if you fuck up, soon everybody will \nknow, and if you do not tale great care to make amends and be better in the \nfuture, you will not get any more partners,.

I have not read the books \nor seen the movie, but from what I have heard about it, it sounds more like \ndomestic violence than BDSM. He sounds like he is narcissistic, which is \nvery hard to see when being manipulated by someone. The abuse isn't an \nobvious \"shut-up you slut\" or a punch in the face. This kind of abuse is \nharder to recognize but can be just as harmful, sometimes even more \nharmful, than the more obvious kinds of domestic violence. Stalking is \nnever OK. It may seem fun at the time if you like the person, but it is a \nsign that they do not respect your privacy and may have serious mental \nhealth issues. Controlling, obsessive behavior raises a big red flag \n(warning sign) in the real world and I advise anyone who wants to live a \nhappy life to 'steer clear' of those kinds of people.\nBDSM is great, but unfortunately there are too many people out there who \nare into it for the wrong reasons. Unless they receive help for whatever \ntrauma they have suffered or whatever mental condition they are struggling \nwith (i.e. a personality disorder), they are going to bring this into their \nBDSM play and relationships and it then becomes unhealthy and even \ndangerous.",

BDSM is extremely mainstream.\n\nit should also be obvious, from descriptions of women's sexual fantasies, \nthat most of them are into sex which has a \"domination-submission\" theme. \nif you don't believe me, then try talking to some women sometime.\n\nas for your last question, i have not had any relationships with women. \nprecisely for the reason that they don't open their mouths, which is the \nquestion you asked me.",

Its modern day feminists, again like you, that have taken what \nour predecessors have done and just screwed it all up. No wonder men don't \ntake women seriously. Also I am an English and Library Science major, so \nsorry to tell you, but I read all the time and my GPA is fantastic. \nClearly, its you who needs to read because I said PAST fairy tales, you \nknow from like the Grims Brothers! Jesus, girl, do you need glasses? \nFurthermore, I was trying to say that 50 shades is different not only \nbecause of the sexual content, but because instead of the rich prince \ncharming (Christian Grey) saving the innocent virgin (Ana Steele) it is she \nwho ultimately saves him from himself. I'm not saying these series are \nliterary classics like Dante's Inferno, but it has potential to be \ninterpreted more than just \"mommy porn.\" Shesh, open up your mind already.",

As to the other idiots judging a \"FICTIONAL\" \nbook, get the fuck over it! So what it's not your average \"traditional\" \nmale fairy tale where the \"innocent\" little virgin gets saved by the \ngorgeous rich prince charming and learns her bullshit moral lessons. The \nstory line is reversed! The \"innocent\" little virgin is the one who saves \nthe prince  in the end! Read and study old fairy tales, whom I might add \nwere all written by MEN, and tell me that you cannot see how utterly \nridiculous and completely irrational they were by constantly \"conditioning\" \nwomen into thinking that sexual acts were bad and that they must be perfect \nlittle angels even while married. These books are a means to reverse past \nmale \"conditioning\" and \"constraints\" on women's sexuality! Shesh!",
