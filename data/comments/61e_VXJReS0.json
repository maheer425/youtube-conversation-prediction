The next, he praises DMC despite it having pregnant women \nkilled BY THE HEROES.....\nAnd then Moviebob praises Mario and Metroid Other M and accuses their \ndetractors of being Japhanophobic Feminazis, the next, he's boning down \nwith Anita Sarkeesian, a person who pretty much embodies all Straw Feminist \nattitudes.\ufeff",
