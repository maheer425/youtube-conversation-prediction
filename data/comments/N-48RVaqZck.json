But the 2nd choice on the \nother hand will give you infinite regeneration and you'll be able to \nregenerate anything and everything and be near immortal.

                    "text": "+Laurie Harding-Russell Not really. At all. I am pretty sure you know that \nand are intentionally being simple here though. Genes are transcribed into \nRNA, which can do all kinds of things, including regulation of cell \nactivities. Some of this RNA is mRNA, which can get translated into \npolypeptides. Proteins are composed of one or more polypeptides, and \nenzymes are one type of protein--the type that catalyzes biochemical \nreactions. There are definitely other kinds of proteins--e.g. hemoglobin (2 \ncopies each of 2 different polypeptides). Hemoglobin binds oxygen so that \nyour red blood cells can distribute it throughout your tissues. There are \nproteins that transport things from point A to point B, proteins that color \nthings and seem to do nothing else, proteins that stabilize the structure \nof things, etc.\nNon-protein molecules can also affect the production of things like \nsteroids. For example, saturated fats lower transcription levels of LDL \nreceptors, resulting in less LDL in your cells and more in your blood, \nwhich opens the door for it to get oxidized/glycosylated/etc. and \ncontribute to atherosclerosis. It is the cholesterol inside LDL that your \nbody can use to synthesize steroid hormones.\n\nAlso, gene therapy tends to not be permanent either, for two big reasons:\n1--unlike bacteria which have circular DNA, humans have chromosomes shaped \nlike sticks, and the therapeutic DNA doesn't really integrate into that \nvery well. It hangs around for a while and then gets degraded by enzymes \nthat are supposed to degrade loose chunks of DNA.\n2--you actually have a complete copy of all of your DNA in every single \ncell (except sperm/eggs etc.where it gets weird) in your body, but the \ntherapy isn't going to successfully reach every last cell you've got. So \nyou'll be fixing the defect in some cells but not in others. Usually, the \ndisease reduces in effect but does not go away completely. Now, some cells \nare still dividing and some aren't. Some of the ones you fix will divide, \nand some of the ones you didn't fix will divide. How many of each may be up \nto random chance, so the proportion of cells you have at any given time \nduring the duration of effect for gene therapy is not guaranteed to be in \nyour favor--i.e. you're not guaranteed to have more of the ones that are \nexpressing the fixed proteins than you are ones that are expressing \ndefective proteins. This is one of the same reasons why metastatic cancer \nsucks so bad. It usually originates in cells that are still dividing and \nthen go on to divide without limit or regulation. And when it can do that \nanywhere in your body regardless of where it originated, you tend to die \nfrom it.",

                "text": "So I propose this question to Christians and Scientists alike. Christians \nwill say \"you can't improve upon perfection,\" i.e. the human body because \nwe are in God's image. And yet, we do improve on this image each and \neveryday. Go to the beach and grab a tan. What have you done? Adapted to \nyour environment. Have we changed? What happened to perfection? People are \nfar from perfection any sort mentally, physically, or emotionally. But \nreally what is perfection? People will call God perfect but why? What is he \nor her or is there a perfect gender? Is perfection not having a gender? IF \nwe are created in God's image and we ate from the tree of the knowledge of \ngood and evil, wouldn't we technically have God's shape (image) and \nknowledge or at least the capacity to reach his knowledge? My answer is \nthat God did not create perfection, I mean he couldn't. If he created \nperfection and he(she) is perfection than we'd simply all be carbon copies \nof God. But what if God isn't even perfect? What if God is just like us? \nFlawed. Looking at the universe this way we can explain a few things. For \nexample, evolution and the creation of the universe. Let's say God created \nthe universe (i.e. the big bang in my theory) he started out small, light \nand dark, and let's say he starts with simple single cell organisms but \nthey weren't enough. So he thought they should get better, be better. So he \nevolved them. He slowly created fish, and then thought \"what about things \non land,\" and took them on land. He kept evolving and trying things until \nhe eventually got to the Human, an image much like his own. \"He looked at \nhis creation and saw that is was good.\"\n\nI leave you with this idea. If some told you \"create something\" do you snap \nyour fingers and boom there is an object? Or do you put something together \npiece by piece. What if God creates through trial and error?\ufeff",

When \nmy great grandfather died he couldn't talk(well low mumbling that was \nusually a word or two and impossible to hear), walk, feed himself or any \naction that is necessary to live. The only reason he did was because of the \ntechnology and aid we have today. We're all destined for that or death and \npersonally I'd rather die then be like that for years. Therefore, my views \non God most certainly aren't dampened even a bit.\n \n\"The promise of an afterlife that, when all things considered, most likely \ndoesn't exist isn't a good enough reason for me, personally to believe in \nand worship a murderous psychopath.\" I don't praise God for an afterlife. \nAlso there is no reason to live without religion in my eyes, there would be \nnothing else. Death would be the end and living would have no purpose. \nWithout God we're living in a chaotic world without a single reason to live \nbecause if we did perfect everything then there would be nothing left. If \nwe didn't perfect everything then there is still misery and sorrow.\n\n\"Even if god existed I still would not choose to worship him because by \nappraising an evil act you may as well be committing it.\" Although he did \nallow evil it wasn't his fault, he wasn't the one to disobey himself and \nthe rest of us are punished. The punishment is long and harsh but that \ndoesn't mean he removed all of the happiness in the world. And yes, I do \nconsider Hell to be waaay over the top and I don't imagine the all loving \nGod to be like that. I think what happens after dying will be different for \neveryone and I don't imagine anyone that isn't Christian will burn in Hell \nforever. I believe that on the day God judges everybody that there will be \nseparate punishment and rewards for He is a loving God and the bible \nmentions it many times. My opinion is that he just wants us to do good in \nthe world and to me life is just test to see what we actually do, which \nwould explain why he put the tree of knowledge in the garden.

It would make me as guilty, in the eyes of the law, as \nhim.\"   Justice varies in different peoples eyes, but it was our fault that \nmurders could even exist. Also if you have read that ten commandments then \nyou know that God doesn't support murder in any way.(you're probably \nthinking God is a hypocrite now) God created each in everyone one of us for \na reason, personally I believe many reasons, and if he chooses to take \nsomeone's life then so be it. God won't take someone out of this world or \nallow Lucifer to take someone out of this world if he sees fit. \n\n\"According to the Bible...he has committed genocide and at one point even \nkilled the vast majority of the world's population, leaving only one family \nalive and two of every animal,\"  Why yes indeed, that is correct. God did \nkill the very large majority of the world's population and I can not lie \nabout it. Break it down(music in the background). A loving God created \neveryone and everything. Eventually, no one believed in God anymore except \na single family; Noah's family. The city was filled with sin and nothing \nthere was good, just a completely corrupted place and God knew that nothing \nwould change them. Although I don't know what would have happened if God \nleft them alone, I assume He flooded the world because otherwise all people \non Earth would stop believing in God. The one who always loved you and \nwanted the best for you was likely to be ignored until his existence was \nunknown. So God destroyed the evil in the world washed the slate clean, \nquiet literally.  Afterwards he was sorry a vowed to never flood the Earth \nagain, he originally has done it out of anger that the people he created \nand loved had forsaken him to such a degree. Besides, what makes you think \nthat dying is oh so bad? I could care less when I die. I know what's \nwaiting for me and I couldn't care less about when I die. Also if you think \nit's cruel, everyone dies at some point in their life.  In one year there \nare 31,536,000 seconds and it only takes roughly 20 seconds to 60 seconds \nto become unconscious(that was just all googled to show how short of a time \nperiod it is). If God had let them live many years then 31,536,000 would \nmultiply and you can see how short of a time that really is.\n\n \"god has tortured people\" I'm not sure what you mean, anything he has done \nor let happen has pretty much been punishment. Bible verse please.\n\n\"and if you're a fundamentalist then you most likely believe that all \ndiseases and forms of suffering, including natural disasters, are a product \nof his creation, thus the world is already suffering.\"     Personally, I \nbelieve that everyone should read and interpret the bible as best as they \nand hopefully with the guidance of church members as the bible can be quite \ncomplicated. Other then that, I'm not aware of any verses in the bible that \nspook of the weather before sin entered the world but due to everything \nbeing created within the first 7 days I would assume that weather was \nalready there. Also, I would guess that at the point in time it never was \ndangerous before sin, disease, and other forms of suffering entered the \nworld. Everything that we, for the most part, consider evil came after Eve \nand Adam ate the forbidden fruit. Of course the fruit could be interpreted \nas other symbols too but the point is that nothing bad was there until they \nate the fruit, this includes,\"all diseases and forms of suffering, \nincluding natural disasters...\"\n\n\"Most Christians don't actually read the full Bible..A lot of atheists were \nformer Christians and most of them state that they became an atheist by \nreading the Bible.\" Okay, that's kind of a different topic about the Bible \nand I'd prefer to avoid another long discussion. Also it's mostly a \npersonal view and it really can't be proven one way or the other without \nlegitimate statistics.",

But just because we don't yet have the \nability to solve them, doesn't mean we couldn't if we had all the \ninformation. They don't just get better because God blesses them, there's a \nphysiological reason, just one we cannot yet work out.\n\nAnd if you can't discover God with your own 2 eyes you must have to \ndiscover him through blind faith, which is a self-fulfilling prophecy. God \nmust exist because of 'A', even though I can't see/smell/hear/touch him, \nwhich proves he's real because we don't have the capability to \nsee/smell/hear/touch him, what with him being incomprehensible. It's the \nperfect cover for the usual line of basic questioning of your faith. Why \ndoes God do this? Because he's God. Who created God? Himself. Why? Because \nhe's God. It's retarded, but not as retarded as your inability to see this.\n\nYou know God exists because you believe God exists. I think this line of \nmis-logic is the reason why there are so many religious people, because \nthey simply don't even try to work around the stupidity of what's written \nin a holy book, but rather take it at face value.\n\nTake the parting of the Red Sea. God saves the Jews and kills the pursuing \nEgyptians. Why would he do this? He created the Egyptians, he knows that \nthe way they are is a direct consequence of the way he made them, yet \npunishes them anyway. Is he cleaning the slate of an old mistake, in which \ncase he isn't perfect and doesn't know everything? Is he changing sides and \nabandoning the Egyptians, in which case he's an asshole? Or is it because \nthe Egyptian gods are taunting him and he has a hissy fit, in which case \nhe's not the 'one' true god?",

Steroids activate a class \nof cellular receptors called 'Nuclear receptors' which are responsible for \ntranscribing several genes (usually the steroid binds the receptor and \nactivates it, then the receptor binds to a transcription factor and \nactivates that). The transcription factor then binds to the promoter \nregions of its 'target genes' and transcribes them, in other words making \nan mRNA copy that will form the template for the production of a protein.\n\nIt obviously depends on the type of receptor activated by the steroid \n(usually steroids target receptors with anti-inflammatory properties, such \nas PPARgamma) and for how long you take the steroids.

So you should understand why I don't exactly take the bible \nas the most credible or reliable source.\n\nAnd even if you try to come back with the infamous \"Classic Christian \nCopout\" (patent pending) of \"You're just taking it out of context.\" or \n\"That's not what it really means.\", then you are still proving me to be \nright. Because if the bible's words aren't literal, then that means they \nare up for ANYONE'S interpretation, rather than fixed and engrained words \ndirectly from the mouth of God.\n\nUnless you actually DO believe in the existence of unicorns.

Jesus aka GOD has put into His DNA \ncode, certain mechanisms created before man was even living, that when man \ncame to the technological point of being able to do what man can now in our \ntime with DNA and where this is going which God already knows, God/Jesus \nensured there's an automatic KILL OFF flag that get's tripped the SECOND a \nman or woman CHOOSES in their mind to allow themselves to get 'eugenicized' \n(sold as \"Enhancement\").

You seem to have \nmissed that many of the \"Sci-Fi\" movies over the last several decades since \nhollywood began, keep have been retelling the same stories of old world \ndomination as part of a process that first requires to indoctrinate nations \ninto views that suit they who actually decide the price of bread daily. \n Sharks survive for a reason, they are the big fish that rule the murkiest \ndepths that man still hasn't been able to chart nor attempt... they stay \nhidden for a but are eating in the dark. \n\nIf you wanted to fool a generation of mankind to buy into 'enhancing' when \nit's really eugenics, (but hey, what do the eugenicists like Gates, \nRockefeller, Rothchild, Carnegie-Mellon etc know when they are the ones \nfunding it right?) not knowing that they are actually downgrading \nthemselves under the lie of 'upgrading', little do they know they are being \nmade into remote control robots who will no more know what 'privacy' is and \nwhat it's like to be a man or woman without being android'd (what are those \nchemtrails for?) ... what would you do? Would you tell mankind they are \ngoing to be made into downgraded and turned into flesh-bots OR, if you \nunderstand ANYTHING about *Business in Marketing / Advertising in Relation \nto Internationalist Geo-Political Agendas*, would you sell eugenics to the \npublic like nothing before because you know the corporate elite see the \nworld as a business, period? .......as in GOLLY JEEPERS THIS IS THE BEST \nTHING SINCE SLICED BREAD! (lie) WAIT! This is truly a philanthropic mission \nthan ever before in mankind! (more slick sick serpent lies), THIS IS GOING \nTO CHANGE MANKIND FOR THE BETTER! (the age old lie from the dragon \nhimself.. we will be 'gods', no.. we won't when man can't even take care of \nhimself most of the time, watch what is going to happen, it's effects can \nalready be discerned for it's birth is right now) WE SWEAR! WE PROMISE! YOU \nJUST WAIT AND SEE! WE WILL SOLVE IT ALL! (more like they know the \nsolultions, but need to make money over helping sick people etc) WE KNOW \nWHAT WE ARE DOING! PUT YOUR LIFE IN OUR HANDS! YOU CAN TRUST US! (sure, put \nme to sleep while satan drives, yea, must be the smartest idea in the \nworld)... and public falls for it why?\n\nBecause most are in the hands of the devil... and for those who deny such a \nreality exists, little do you know how much you actually DO NOT KNOW, for \nwe're all being pulverized through all forms of mainstream media to \n'believe' and 'accept' this is some great idea which appeals to those who \nagain, who have no real knowledge of history on such matters that changed \nhistory forever AND don't know much about what is really going on in the \nworld and the dire position we are already have passed the Rubicon, the die \nis cast, and so comes the black storm of chaos looking like 'the onward and \nupward progress of society' (of course, the industrialists motto to fool \nmankind into repeating, thanks Lenin) ... man, if only people took the time \nto actually truly study history meticulously to learn where this is all \ngoing.\n\nWhen you don't have enough knowledge about something being sold to you, our \nemotions are very easy to move and that's why selling works on so many \npeople, this is not opinion, this is documented proven fact, it's designed \nto appeal to your lower emotions first because the sellers are playing on \nyour emotions, not direct mind-thinking foresight, no, they want you to \nforego the actual considered future reality of the implications of what \nthis means in SO MANY ways concerning the survival of mankind and what it \nmeans concerning \"RIGHTS\" to \"LIFE\".  We are being made into androgynous \nsterile BOTS for THEIR purpose, NOT YOURS as you believe it to be.... our \nsperm count is already down 80% from about 100 years ago realistically here \nin the west, and THAT'S BY DESIGN, but of course, you guys don't read \nhistory changing \"history\", so they are playing on your emotions... so that \nway it entices you, makes you 'give in' and actually 'believe' it's as it \nas good as it seems... well sorry, a sucker is born quite often these days \nso... people who buy this, are the ones responsible for quickening the END \nof MANKIND if they continue to take part in such a masked agenda that is \nKNOWN to HIGH society after they learn of it.  But seemingly to folks as \nyourselves, devastatingly and tragically ignorant, you have helped tie the \nnoose for mankind's ultimate jump into a VERY DARK FUTURE of what it means \nINHERENTLY to be a MAN or WOMAN.\n\nThis is leagues beyond some comments on a YouTube video page.  There is no \ngood ending here for unsaved, that's the facts, it's only getting worse and \nwill be very much like something you saw in a movies that you've been \ndrilled with for ages... here's a hint... eggs are the core of the future \nreality for the future is dark and only looks splendidly bright when you're \nin direct controlled REM.",

Anything \nbeyond improving health and potentially other things like lifespans, \nintelligence (though remember a lot of that also comes from \nnurture/learning), etc. are fine. But more radical things easily breach \nmorphological freedom. Though I do agree with the idea of using this \ntechnology to improve survival in space habitats (and potentially other \nenvironments).\n\nBut we should still remember that we are a long way before anything of this \nscale occurs. We should also remember that there is not really a guarantee \nfor some potential uses of technology that other transhumanists like to \nposit. *Science takes time and results are not always like what lay people \nare hopeful for (though, sometimes, unexpected results might lead to \nsomething potentially better).* The more radical stuff like \"mind \nuploading\" is still very far off--assuming it is possible in the first \nplace (I'm talking about the possibility of it being done, the \nphilosophical issues are yet another can of worms).\n\nInterestingly, Transhumanist thought has matured quite a lot recently in \nterms of bioethics (the last of your links may be an example, but I'm \nskeptical since they mentioned \"the singularity\"). Though one should note \nthis is the direction the movement is going within academia. The general \npublic scale of it, IMHO, seems to be dangerously veering off into silly \nwish-fulfillment/pseudo religious things like \"singularitarianism.\" \nAdditionally, the movement has grown increasingly political with some \ntranshumanist notions slowly becoming more common within Libertarian \nthought ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_transhumanism ) and the \nrecent \"Techno Progressivism\" ( \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-progressivism ) on the opposite \npolitical spectrum.",

If science believed in God creating everyone in His image, it is \nimpossible for science to ever BE science. There are many ways we can \ninterpret what you're saying, and in all honestly, people create people. \nGod only creates an embodiment of heart. But it is not God who creates the \npeople of the Earth. Otherwise, everyone would be perfect, and we clearly \nwouldn't need Jesus. But, coming from someone like you who knows nothing \nabout science, and yet has the audacity to claim that a mere \"Belief\" can \nwin by years and years of scientific study, you are just now being stupid. \nYou see, we clearly have already genetically altered our DNA. It's the next \nbig thing such as making someone grow taller, or shorter. \"Modify\" \ngenerally means to do it man made. To make it happen on your own intent. \nBut, the body is an amazing being. It can already genetically alter itself. \nTumors can form in the brain that cause a glitch in a growth spurt and have \nyou growing up to 7 feet. Dwarfism is another example. You see, beliefs are \nnot stronger than science.\n\nP.S. Humans are not perfect and most of the population doesn't come from \nGod. Don't believe me? Well.. Go to India. \ufeff",

Think of a drug \naddict. When they are sober they suffer depression because the \ndopamine/endorphin receptors become less responsive as the drugs provides \nmore than enough stimulation. The body tries to balance itself. When \nsteroids are introduced they dramatically increase testosterone (Depending \non dosage) and so the testicles shrink as they no longer need to produce as \nmuch testosterone. After ceasing use of steroidal supplements the testicles \nreturn to normal size as testosterone production is brought back to normal. \nSteroids are mostly safe to use at low doses so long as they do not greatly \nexceed what would otherwise be a natural level of testosterone. Some \nbodybuilders have been tested as having supplemented testosterone at 100x \nnatural dose.",

There \nhave been several types of cancers documented in sharks, as well as \nbacterial and parasitic infections.

Sharks also don't have bones, they only \nhave cartilage, which doesn't have any blood vessels. This could make them \nresistant to some cancers, as cancers need blood to survive.\n\nTheir immune systems are impressive, but not perfect. :)",

Penises. \nAnd they even asked our teacher if that would technically be possible. \nHe then said it would be possible if you would inject a gene like those of \njelly fish to make a part of a person glow in the dark. The problems are \nthough 1) with most genes whatever part has the gene would only glow under \nUV light, except for some gene found in some other jelly fish or something \nthat is also the reason for those amazing fotographs of glowing water on \nbeaches, this gene makes the part glow \"when stimulated\" (imagine the \nlaughter). 2) you can't really modify a grown human. It would work with \nfetuses, but then it would kind of be a problem to convince parents why \ntheir unborn child should have a glow in the dark penis. \nThose two guys were pretty sure they could make a fortune with this idea. \nIt was weird, yet kind of funny to listen to xD\ufeff",

The NR2B gene they stuck in the mice \nis a subunit of the NMDA receptor, a receptor important in memory and \ncognition. However, it's also the NR2-form (out of NR2A-D) that results in \nthe most damage during disease like Alzheimer's when the glutamatergic \nsystem (uncluding NMDA receptors) is hijacked.\n\nThere are too many genes involved in cogition/memory, it would be stupid to \nthink we could change it with a modification to a single gene. We'd have to \nchange many hundreds, in which case the cancer chance increases, until \neventually a genetic boost results in cancer 100% of the time. Same with \nstrength and speed, though these are easier to achieve than cognitive \nenhancements.\n\nI'm guessing you may have played Deus Ex, which dives heavily into this \ndebate, and I think I have to fundamentally agree with you.",
