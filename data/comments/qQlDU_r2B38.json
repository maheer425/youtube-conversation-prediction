                "text": "With the conversations about pet mills. Here in Ohio, US there's a pet shop \ncalled PetLand that claims to be rescuing dogs and cats and how they care \nabout their animals when in reality, they're getting their animals from \namish pet mills.\nI went there once and a little girl on her way out asked me to take the \nkitten she was holding so I did. This kitten could not have been older than \n4 weeks. It could hardly stand and it was OBVIOUSLY malnourished and \nunwell. NEVER NEVER NEVER take cats or dogs away from their mothers before \n8 weeks!!! They learn so much from their families that it's worth it to \nwait! They were also asking for $900 for this tiny, ill kitten that they \nclaimed was pure Russian Blue (it wasnt [yellow eyes]) and when I told them \nI wasnt going to buy it, the clerk offered to let me set up a monthly \npayment plan for it. That means theyre desperate to get animals out of the \nstore enough to knowingly give a living creature to a family that probably \ncant afford living costs for said animal. Not to mention the horrendous vet \nbills.\nI really wish people were more educated about these types of places. \ufeff",

I can't say \"cheese\" and expect my dog or cat to know I want them \nto \"lay\".  Maybe I can get away with \"may\" instead of \"lay\" but the sounds \nhave to be similar.  You don't want to confuse your pet, you'll always get \nthe best results if you consistently use the same words for the same \nactions.  Also, hand gestures are very useful as well.  I use gestures \nalong with commands, especially when it comes to them getting a treat for \nsomething.  Their eyes are on my hand and the treat, so if I turn my hand \naway, they know they are not getting the treat yet.  If I turn it towards \nthem, they know I'm offering them the treat now.  Some dogs are better at \nthis than others but this method has always worked very well with my dogs \nand cats.",
