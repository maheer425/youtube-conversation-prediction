Ends up giving the girls guns in exchange \nfor a mountain of T-shirts.>\n\nBack in America's house, fighting turns ugly. In the east, Virginia fights \nthe Northeastern girls to an exhaustive stand still. In the West, the great \nlakes states gained the upper hand. Ohio-chan is developing \nYandere/pyromaniac tendencies and has gutted both Georgia and South \nCarolina's rooms with fire <makes offhanded remark about prarie dog \nvillages>. Just as Virginia is shown backed into a corner and North \nCarolina is being chased around the house, America (representing American \nnational identity) comes home from the hospital.\n\nStill groggy from all the poison, America stares at his half destroyed \nhouse and looks exhausted for the first time. He stops the violence and \nsays \"This is why I can't take you girls anywhere.\"\n\n\"Can we get Pasta? I'm starving.\"\n\n\"Yes. Let's do that.\"\n\n<<Roll Credits: Draw a Circle. That's the earth.>>",

Then there was an explosive growth in cotton \nproduction in India and Egypt.\n\nGoing further, the most powerful Midwestern States (agriculture, industry, \nand population) are clustered around the Great Lakes or would be in that \ngeneral sphere of influence (Iowa). While Chicago would be a logical \ncapital for this grouping, the state of Illinois wouldn't necessarily be \nmore dominant than either Ohio or Michigan.\n\nThis group's priorities would be:\n1. Enforce Right of free passage on the Mississippi river (A major grain \nexport route) and Saint Lawrence seaway.\n2. Place Kentucky and West Virginia in their sphere of influence for coal \nand energy resources.\n\nThis would place them in conflict with the South and not the Northeast \n(which has some overlapping interests with them).",

So if the person says they will do \nsomething, they will instead do something to help out the company that \nsupported them so they can gain MORE money, to buy more ads, to eventually \npersuade the public to re-elect them. It is an endless cycle... \n\nThere is barely even a reason to vote in these elections, as the person who \nmakes the most ads, has the most money, and says the most ridiculous things \nabout other canidates, will win.\n\nThis is why a good portion of people don't vote in elections.",

Yeah, \nI know it's weird and I'm horrible at explaining. After all, the Vietnam \nWar was more of a civil war. \"The Second Vietnam War,\" as you referred to \nit, the United States possibly had achieved its goal of aiding South \nVietnam, but two years later the Republic of Vietnam collapsed, so I would \nsay it was a temporary victory for the U.S.\n\nAlso, while North Vietnam recognized South Vietnam's sovereignty on paper, \nand the Republic was recognized by countries like UK, US,...the Communist \nstates (Ex. Russia) have recognized its communist comrade - North Vietnam. \nConsidering its withdrawal a year after the peace accords, the USA had \npossibly realized that its intervention will not successfully alter the \nresult.\n\nThe other thing is that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam might be \nconsidered the victor, but Vietnam was horribly drained by colonialism, as \na result it is now impoverished, corrupted, and hierarchical. As many \ncommunist states will become, \"Independence-Freedom-Happiness\" became the \nopposite. In the end, the U.S remained a developed state; many Southern \nVietnamese of 1975 moved to the States as refugees and established their \nwell-beings, while Vietnam became what it has became: a poor country. In my \nviewpoint, there is no definite answer to the question \"Which side won the \nVietnam War?\"\n\nEveryone is welcomed to inform me more about this topic. \n\n+Th\u1eeba An \u0110\u1eb7ng, just as any person who doesn't see both sides of the \nproblem, is terribly supportive of North Vietnam, and that is fine. I lived \nin Vietnam for most of my life, and I wouldn't stand it when people (who \nclearly have no clue) start talking about the Vietnam War and how bad \nVietnam is. Government officials are extremely corrupted, and they do not \nfear to show it, but as watup2101 mentioned: Don't judge a country by its \npeople.",

The U.S. engaged in a limited war in Vietnam, successfully \npreventing the North from absorbing the South for over decade and a half, \nwhile not getting China committed like it did in Korea. There was no end in \nsight until the Tet offensive; after that, the U.S. had practically won, as \nthe NLF was nearly annihilated. Eventually, by 1972, peace accords were \nsigned where North Vietnam officially recognized the sovereignty of South \nVietnam, without either party losing territory. That was the intended \nresult, so the U.S. did, in fact, win the Second Vietnam \"War.\" The U.S. \nthen pulled out a year later. \n\nTwo years after THAT, the North declared war on the South again, and the \nU.S. did not intervene. *That* war, the Third Vietnam \"War,\" was a decisive \nvictory for the North Vietnamese; South Vietnam didn't stand a chance. \n\nWhatever the result, it's noteworthy that the U.S. was supporting half of \nthe Vietnamese against the other half.

Casualty estimates from the \ntime predicted ~500,000 U.S. military casualties, ~2-3 million Japanese \nmilitary casualties, and ~2-10 million Japanese civilian casualties - far \ngreater than the ~150,000 killed by the Hiroshima bomb. \n\nThe Nagasaki bomb is rather more ambiguous, as the Hiroshima one alone \nmight have secured Japan's surrender.\n\nAll in all, though, the A-bomb has saved far, FAR more lives than it has \ntaken. \n\nThanks for reading this essay. :P",

Every day, \nthe gardener would find signs of the caterpillar but never the caterpillar. \n Eventually, the caterpillar became complacent, eating more and more \nthinking he was safe from the gardener.  One day, tired and belly filled to \nsatisfaction, the caterpillar decided to spin his cocoon.  He found he had \neaten all the foliage around him and had grown too fat and lazy to find a \nsuitable place to hide.  Sure he would never be found, he spun it in the \nopen.  Later that evening, a passing bird found the cocoon with the \ncaterpillar tuck away in it.  The caterpillar became a good meal for the \nbird.  The moral of the story: become conceited, fat, lazy, confident of \nyour status and security in an insecure world, misuse your resources, you \nget your ass handed to you.  That's the situation America is in right now. \n Americans might have believed in the back of their minds a terror attack \nwas possible but they never saw 9/11 coming.

Hamas \nHAD to break all of the agreed upon ceasefires too. because shelling \ncivilians during a ceasefire is definitely morally justifiable.\n\n**END SARCASM**\n\nJust because someone supports Israel does not make them a \"Zionist.\" I \nsupport Israel because they are an important ally that is surrounded by \npeople that want them wiped out, whether they overtly show it or not.  Are \na people who, historically, have been constantly threatened with \nextinction, and yet, have always survived. That deserves respect in my book.\n\nbesides, if the millions of Israelis shouldn't be there, then what do we do \nwith them? kill them? because that would make us just like the Nazi SS, and \nthey aren't exactly popular. If we don't kill them, where do they go? what \nabout their possessions and developments? they weren't there when Israel \nwas established in '48. If we let them stay but force them to be under \nHamas/Hezbollah/Al Qaeda/ISIS, then is allowing their genocide acceptable? \nbecause that would be the result.\n\nEven if Israel shouldn't exist, it does now, and its to the point where any \nattempts to \"set things straight again\" would involve inconceivable and \nunacceptable costs, both in money and blood.",

                    "text": "+ImperiumTrooper\n\n\nI like your passion and general understanding of the revolution of the \nworld that has been the Americanization of culture, as well as America's \nplace as a world power.  But I see your thoughts as being far too singular. \nYou are thinking but you are not acting like you're thinking.. Also you \nshould really consider a more bipartisan approach to criticism instead of \nbeing so vindictive. Have your own opinion, call it what you want, but \npartisan bullshit and many categories are in fact a means to separate and \ndivide us as a nation, these are just operative gimmicks they use to \ncontrol us trickling down from money & corruption, in both Congress and in \nthe Senate. Furthermore, I am disappointed how you see America as a power \nyet don't place it as having more involvement in its own diplomacy/ruling. \nCurrently America is more of an oligarchy veiled under a constitutional \ndemocracy. Our rule is superseded by the wealthy rather than its own people \nas a true democracy should be. Your remark '...you act like the US is the \nnew USSR', is clearly from your own standpoint and not someone who has \nexperienced the repression of corporate ruled America. You are like an \nunripe fruit, you do not yet feel the bruises.\nOur rightful grounds as states will continually be overruled by national \nlaws. Constitutional rights should protect and serve us, instead of define \nand infect us, our executive branch most of all, which is incidentally \nhighly protected by the constitution, is given far greater power than EVER \nintended. You seem to think that revolution is necessary but yet you say \npeople who think the governments excessive power is necessary......? Our \nproper rights which includes that of which to deconstruct an obsolete \nbranch of government, do not apply to the current regime. Anyone who \nopposes the current rule is pretty much labeled an 'anti-American \nextremist' and probably tracked by the NSA for the purpose of knowing their \nenemy.\n\nAs you have said, knowledge is power, perhaps you do not realize how all of \nthe internet and social media is used against us daily in targeted \nadvertisements and brainwash. Even political speeches. Its more like a \nfucking movie or game than an honest competition. And you think America is \ndoing right by abiding by this system? We didn't even have the right to \nvote as individual citizens before Jackson!!!! Even now 'our' electoral \ncolleges define our vote for us.\n\nHowever your made up statistics and overall understanding of the term \n'third world' as pointed out by +Shaggy Cris  TWICE, are getting you \nnowhere. And thats not the only thing Imperiumtrooper; Perhaps even more \nimportant, especially since many people seem to lack this understanding, \njust because something is your opinion, does not make it a fact!! \nFurthermore, your views of the government granting our 'individual freedom' \nand apparent understanding of how law making and lobbying works, are \nclearly two different ideals. No hand shakes from the fakes required to \nunderstand this one.\n\nAlso regardless of how democracy changes or fails to change, I don't see \nhow we can succeed on Earth when we've reduced humanity's existence to \nexclusively leaving humanity as a benefactor, depleting all natural \nresource.\n\nBesides the fact that Earth is already 75% water and both the land and \nwater are filled with plastic shit, we're increasingly overpopulated and \nneed new energy solutions. Perhaps even more dauntingly indicative of war, \nthey've done studies to show most people need X amount of acres of land, \nwater, etc. in order to be happy. At the rate we are producing and \nconsuming, for the middle class Americans in the skewed bell curve that is \nour socioeconomic structure, we're screwed.\nBefore you think 'society will be fine it has been fine before' consider \nthe explosion of humanity's population as a whole over the past 300 years. \nAs far as the ironically anti progressive comments on greener living and \noverpopulation, how can you not see that A.You don't have to be a socialist \nto think to see our current energy system is increasingly failing due to \nlack of resource and manpower. B. Because of overpopulation these changes \nare critical into reforming the WORLD and should start in the birthplace of \nmany great ideas, America!!\nFor example, the way we farm is completely obsolete and basically killing \nthe soils necessary to sustain proper crops. Ask anyone who understands \nproduction of agriculture. They will tell you just how bad combines are for \nthe earth, GMOs are for the body, and pesticides are poison to us all.. I \nmean its pretty embarrassing that the government is so paranoid at \ncompetition in its big money interests, it has failed to recognize that \nmarijuana with THC and HEMP are two different plants and that hemp is in \nour best interests both as manufacturers and producers but as rope, paper, \nand a lot of applications which would improve our GDP. American government \nhas repeatedly and will continue to protect its own pocketbook, whether its \na bailout, or the annexation of small businesses. Ultimately our science \nisn't backing up our existence as a whole, we merely crutch on with wounded \nlegs meanwhile corporations feed off of our backs. The corporations use \npolicies and copyrights and drive off small business with rock bottom \nprices in order to run them out of town and then raise their prices once \nthey've eliminated the competition. Walmart for instance.. They also tell \nproducers what they will buy their products for rather than negotiating. \nThey use their money stay above the law. One of Walmart's CEOs even killed \nsomeone D.W.I./DUI and unsurprisingly, used her money to get a slap on the \nwrist. They will remain in power regardless because they strongarm us with \nammunition we've provided whether literally or using figures from their \nmassive data pools collected on us, the loyal subjects..  Meanwhile they \nget the last laugh knowing they have the final say..\n\nWe need viable solutions in a nation so full of ideas... Hope you take \nsomething from this book of a comment..",

However, that is not a \nguarantee that it would secede as a separate state.\n\nFurthermore, just because some people want to secede does not mean everyone \nwants to secede. Texas, last election, was more close than it has ever been \nwith a sizable population voting blue instead of red. Meaning that if it \never DID secede, it would probably end up like Virginia and West Virginia \nwhere the state itself would break apart.\n\nAnd if Texas breaks apart, its economy may change to where it might not \nsucceed on its own.",

Furthermore if one state were to secede \nunchallenged what would stop other states from doing the same? Allowing a \nstate to secede puts the rest of the nations sovereignty in question which \nwould be to much of a risk and puts the continued existence of the USA in \nquestion. Effectively trying to leave the USA by secession is considered an \nillegal action and the USA would use any means necessary to bring the State \nback in line.

No one should be in the same place on the economic ladder \nfor long.\n\n In a socialist system, everyone except the leaders is at the bottom. the \nleadership live in luxury while average person is expected to \"give their \nfair share.\"\n\nIn a socialistic mixed system, what we have right now, the government picks \ntheir own winners and losers, and it is difficult (but not impossible) for \nany of the \"losers\" to advance before being demonized and cut back down to \nthe bottom. the leadership and those few deemed winners (and those who do \nnot get cut down) have most of the wealth, while the middle class shrinks \nrapidly and the lower class grows tremendously.\n\n If you mean all rich people, well, some are rich and famous because they \nare rich and famous, like the Kardashians (don't know how to spell it, \ndon't care); being useless to society in a pragmatic sense. They are \nworshiped like gods even though they don't do much or produce anything. But \nthey will probably burn through their money eventually.",

One thing that must be \nremembered, is that the USA is 400 million peoples' best attempt at working \ntowards a thriving community, and I think that they are doing pretty damn \nwell. Sure there are things that they disagree upon, yet when we look at \nthe countless other nations that have a population anywhere close in size \nas them, we see pretty f*cked up stuff. I get it, Europeans have great \nstuff going on, yet at the same time most of the Euro countries have a mere \ntenth of the American populace.

Maybe when you go \nto live in another country out of a feeling of belonging there and falling \nin love with a place is gets easier to just be part of the culture but when \nyou live your country thinking about doing a sacrifice for your future is \nanother story. I cannot say this is the feeling for every immigrant that \ngoes to live in your country but I'm sure is the feeling of many...maybe \nthat's what comes across as wanting to change the country to be the one \nthey left...I hope it comes clear that many, many would prefer to go back \nhome but is not always easy to live behind the hope for a better future.",

It's kind of hard to have a \ngovernment if you do not have actual citizens to make up both the governing \nauthority and the governed body. \n\nAs for American Samoa, American Empire only mentioned them as being in the \nno local government category because they are similar to the non-inhabited \nislands because American Samoa residents are not actual citizens of the \nUnited States of America.

The \nresult was(if I remember correctly) 62% voted for statehood, which was \nobviously skewed because of the large chunk of people who didn't vote. The \npro-statehood party still celebrates that victory to this day, despite the \nfact that the results didn't mean much, and also despite the fact that Rick \nSantorum on a visit here to raise campaign funds publicly stated that even \nif statehood prevailed the result needed to be a landslide victory, \nsomething like 95% of people in favor of statehood, in order for congress \nto do something about the status of Puerto Rico.",
