And that's when the inbreeding starts \nhappening, or maybe the generation after that. But since noone has the same \ndad it might be slightly less terribad... Or whatever.

Outcome is either #2 or that the decent folks win and manage to \nhave some sort of function family until the vault population plummets due \nto aging.\n4) The majority of the vaults are decent people and manage to have a \nfunctional system up and running to minimize suffering and maximise \npopulation. It works for a while but isn't enough to support the population \nand the vaults gradually die out. That or vaults manage to survive and have \na massive inbreeding problem.\n\nSo yeah.

The point \nis to shuffle the 1000 genes of females while avoiding to pass males genes. \nMale has A/A genes while females have 1/1 2/2 3/3 etc. Those 500 boys would \nhave A/1 A/2 A/3 genes. If you make a careful timetable, separate the \noriginal females into 20 teams per 50 and those into 5 teams per 10 \ncurrently breeding. Those 500 boys would have to emm... have sex with their \nsort of aunts to shuffle say female 50/50 with a boy A/17 this has a 50 - \n50% chance to get 50/17 instead of A/50. This way the original females and  \ntheir children might produce a second generation with enough variation that \nwould number about 250. With enough care over who screws who it might be \npossible to avoid inbreeding.

If the Man \ndoes manage to breed with 999 women...(a sex machine he would be) half the \ngenetic material in each child is his own.

The \nSecond law of thermodynamics states that all systems (such as DNA) have a \ntendency to revert to their natural states. This means that all elements \n(as in those on the periodic table) will lose/gain electrons from other \nelements to reach a point of stability where they no longer gain/lose \nelectrons. So if no new material is introduced from other genetic lines, \nthe elements in each successive generation will be progressively more \nstable. Stable elements are unable to interact with each other (see inert \ngases) and you need active elements to make functional DNA. In summary, the \nlonger a single pure DNA strand reproduces without outside input the more \nerrors will occur (harmful mutation/deformation).",

In Fallout 2 (and according to \nthe Fallout Bible 6) it contains indeed mostly just seeds, but also \nfertilizers and a lot of knowledge on holodisks (and a pen flashlight), but \nin Fallout 3 it is actually a Terraforming module capable of reforming all \nmatter nearby into farmable land. Literally all matter nearby. Don't turn \nthat thing on if you're standing right in front of it.\n\nTo answer the original question; yes, it did work for Vault City, if I \nremember correctly (at least they said that they \"used theirs already\" and \nit was kind of a thriving, modern city in Fallout 2). And in Fallout 3 it \nis used as a part of the giant water purifier used to supply water to the \nCapital Wasteland.\n\nI possibly made a few mistakes here and there, since I just wrote what I \nstill remembered.

Twice a day and your looking at a year \nand a half between each. Good luck having \"no\" mean anything in that \nsituation.\n\nNot to mention that everyone would soon realize exactly how doomed their \nsituation was even if they did stay civil. Best you can hope for would be a \nsociety where everyone was civil and nice until everyone dies of old age, \nnaturally, and the last few senior citizens are the only ones that don't \nget properly buried. Or however you dispose of the dead in a vault, I don't \nknow about that part.\n\nIn short, it would simply not work.\n\nSuffice to say the vault with only one woman would be rendered extinct in \none generation, maybe two depending on if she has any children. The one man \nscenario however... would be far more cruel. 999 potential mothers, but \nonly one father - of absolutely everyone. The next generation after the \nfirst would *all* be each others brothers and sisters, half perhaps, but \nthey would all share half their genes with each other. That is way to close \nin family to produce anything but in-breeds, the gene pool is simply not \nbig enough.\n\nIt would soon turn into a disgusting nightmare as each group after the \nother is so in-breed and mentally retarded you soon would not have anyone \nable to run the needed works of the vault and everyone would perish in \ncruel and pitiable ways as the vault stops functioning around a population \nto retarded to understand what's going on.\n\nIf I were that one guy? At best, I'd sleep with any woman that wanted it \nuntil I was completely exhausted and ultimately sick and tired of sex, then \noff myself at some point. At worst, I'd just off myself.

An independent variable is a variable you \nchange, in this instance, what happens inside the vault and the dependent \nvariable is a variable that stays the same in all subjects of a test, for \nexample, the amount of people in a vault, how big the vault is etc. Eight \nvaults were used for control vaults, Vault 101 and other vaults their \nnumbers of which are not disclosed to us.\nThe rest of the vaults all had something about them. Vault 13, the main \nvault of Fallout 1, has a water purifier chip that malfunctions, Vault 87 \ntested new pathogens and cures for diseases for over the years to come and \nVault 112, the tranquillity lane project.

Remember; these vaults can withstand earthquakes, atomic bombs, ect. \nSo I doubt they were worried about some untrained survivors with broken old \nguns. ",
