There are many apparent tracks he has left, and \nsometimes we have to believe in the unseen. \n\nFor example, I am muslim, and in the Quran (which has been proven to not \nhave changed) it explains the orbital of the planets (which could not have \nbeen known 1400 years ago), it explains the creation of life, originating \nfrom the sperm (which could also not be known). It says things about \npharoah, before he was born. This obviously could not be known. These are \njust three of countless miracles.\n\nAlso the quran is text that can not be compared to. There have been \ncountless scholars who try to come up with text as complex and beautiful as \nthe Quran, but they never come close. Within a specific three short verses \nof the Quran, there were over 40 literary elements used. \n\nFinally, to refute the atheistic view. OK, i get it. The big bang. But, who \ncaused it?? One year from now, the sun will come up at exactly the same \ntime as today. Nothing major has ever collided with earth to severely harm \nthe human race. We havent been hit by major solar storms. And im expected \nto believe that BANG, and the sun is there, coming up the exact same time \nevery year, and BANG the human race is forever protected from solar \ndangers. This doesnt make much sense to me. Another thing is evolution. \nThere is a major flaw in the theory of evolution. Where did single cellular \norganisms originate? this is still not known to this date. Somehow, the sun \njust magically cultivated life. Life comes from life, and this has been \nproven by scientists, so how could life come from nothing.\n\nFor me, there is obviously someone who created life. And, in my belief, it \nis Allah.\ufeff",

Can't even make it to \nthe closest star other than our sun. These other galaxies are millions of \nlight years away, and stars are 4 - 80,000+ light years or so away, you \nknow what that is? Haha, we'll never ever reach anything out there, not for \nhundreds, thousands, maybe millions of years to come. And if science does, \nwe won't be alive to even witness it. Don't mess with God ever, you can't \nreach God, and you won't see anything either, until you pass away, you \ndon't even know. And to the idiots saying \"Oh how come we cant see God? or \nwhy hasn't God cured my pet or family member of sickness? See there is no \nGod\"..... Just shut your mouth and go in a corner and not speak again, \never, cause you sound retarded. You don't ask God for anything and expect \nto get help right then and there, how foolish can you be? You don't know \nhow the Almighty works. You have no knowledge. You'll never understand, and \nthat's very sad. In the end, God will handle everything, all we need to do \nis pass God's test. Just live, love, and be kind.\ufeff If I come off as \ndisrespectful and rude, I'm sorry but, these atheists aggravate me. They're \nblind so I have to shed some advice and knowledge.\ufeff",

The Bible that you have so much faith in was not \nwritten by any witnesses of the events portrayed in the Bible. The Bible \nwas written 30-70 years after the events of Jesus' life. You say we cannot \nprove God yet you can't either, your whole religion is based off of a book \nthat cannot be proven nor dis proven yet you reject science because you \nbelieve it didn't exist thousands of years ago. I hope you have actually \ndone research about the lifespan of people at that time because most people \nbarely lived past 30 or 40. I'm talking about research from reliable \nsources not the bible. One more thing that just confuses me. So god gave \neveryone free will yet we have eternal torment hanging over our head, that \nis not free will. What kind of kind of god would put such a system in \nplace. If he was all knowing and all loving then he would essentially \ncreate a being that would reject him and punish it for its god given right. \nReally makes you think right?",

That's a pandora's box. because by saying that very \nthing, you basically say everything exists until proven not to - so.. \nunicorns, faeries, santa, tooth fairy, slenderman, cosmic teapot, \nextrasolar lightspeed rhino... you can't prove none of these are real.\n\n'who made all this happen' is an impossible question, because if there is \nno answer involving a 'who' then the question will still be asked. it's a \nmalformed question, because the way you ask it presupposes that there was a \nsentient being behind it. Science hasn't does not stop there being a \nsentient being behind the universe, but at this current point in time, \nthere is no evidence there is. if evidence were to come about that there \nis, you can be sure that scientists will eventually chase down an answer as \nto 'who'.\n\nOoh, do I detect a hint of pascal's wager? well, I would believe in one \nless god than you. And i'm pretty sure that in most religions, the penalty \nfor not believing, is much less than the penalty for believing in the wrong \ngod. So I ask you.. What if Allah is real, and you've been following the \nwrong practices - If YOU are right, both the jews, and the muslims, have \nbeen believing in the right god, but following the wrong practices - and \nare doomed to hell. What if The egyptians were right in their beliefs? I \ncould go on all day, asking the same question about numerous religions. I'd \nrather be doomed to a lesser hell for not holding a belief, than a worse \nhell for making the wrong choice.\n\nI believe those who need to believe in a god are in pain, and often lonely. \nI don't understand the desire to seek such a belief, when the world we live \nin and the people we meet, provide us with more happiness and joy than you \ncould wish for. I don't make fun of those who believe in any god, I take \nthat seriously. But.. when it comes to the gods themselves... there is \noften much to mock. There's zeus turning into a swan, The schizophrenic \nnature of the abrahamic god, the power hungry narcissistic nature of the \nabrahamic god.. the even more narcissistic nature of the egyptian gods.. \nAll these gods have some easily mockable features.\n\nOh, and the reason i'm speaking to you as I am, is because of how you \nspeak. You condescend, and label athiests as 'ignorant.' Many outspoken \nathiests know more of the bible than many christians. We've thought through \nthe beliefs. we've considered pascals wager. we have gone through 'soul \nsearching'.

As mentioned in \nmy last comment (that you clearly didn't read, or didn't comprehend), there \nare different types of atheism which classify reasoning in different ways. \nWHICH AGAIN, to your selective illiteracy, is the other root of this \ndiscussion -- the disconnection between atheists who do not have 1 single \nagreement of \"what is atheism?\"\n\nAs for your last question; \"Are you suggesting that anything we cannot be \n100% certain about is a belief?\"\n\nMy answer is to again reference your selective illiteracy as I will copy \nand paste from my previous reply, which you did not read, or otherwise \ncannot understand . . .\n\n\"But those who identify as \"atheist\" while stating, \"I don't believe in God \nor gods,\" or to say, \"there is no God or gods,\" are representing a belief \nsystem -- those atheists, as with theists, cannot PROVE their point of \nview, but have made their declaration to believe as they do.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being skeptical and open-minded, curious and \nindifferent, or apathetic in general . . . but again, when one declares it \none way or the other (as both atheists and theists have done throughout \nthis thread) it becomes a belief.\"\n\nI will type as slowly as possible, as you present yourself as slow . . . \nwhich is not my arrogant speech, but you really display yourself as . . . \nwell, slow. \n\nI am not suggesting a lack of absolute certainty becomes a realm of belief \n. . . but when one comes out and says something with certainty, absent of \nproof, it is a belief.\n\nSo I get it . . . you're taking this personally, as if I am accusing you \nand the whole of atheism as a belief, but what you've failed to read & \ncomprehend is that I, and others, are outing the self-proclaimed \"atheists\" \nwho say \"there is no God or gods,\" or otherwise deny any possibility, \nabsent evidence or reason, as foolish.\n\nIn the end, we both seem to agree with Immanuel Kant; a refusal to claim \ncertainty absent the proof of certainty.\n\nI will otherwise say I am open minded to concepts, perceptions, and \nexperiences I do not yet know or cannot explain -- there is something \nresponsible for the reality, physical and inanimate, that we all seem to \nunderstand & agree of.

It looks more like you're critiquing a book for \nan exam, rather than responding to youtube comments. Your posts carry an \ninsulting, arrogant and patronising tone. You belittle those who respond to \nyou and then insult them further.\n\nAs long as that continues I will send insults your way. Just so we're clear \non that particular subject. You are pedantic because you take everyday \nphrases literally. When it suits at least. Fortunately I've only \nexperienced one other person like that online some time ago when discussing \nhumane training methods for dogs.

Are you related?\n\nYou talk about atheists as a group that you are not part of as you refer to \nthem/me in the 3rd person. So either you believe in a god or gods, meaning \nyou're religious, or you lack that belief.\nI guess now you're going to put your pedant pants on and argue about my use \nof the word religious. So just to clarify I was going by this definition... \n\"Having or showing belief in and reverence for God or a deity.\"\n\nAtheists do not need to prove anything, as they are not making any claims. \nAtheism is disbelief, not belief. An atheist does not affirm the \nproposition that a god or gods exist. I'm not sure which part of that \npeople find so hard to grasp. If you were an atheist you would not be \narguing against that, or referencing Christian philosophers!\nIf I was to assert that god does not exist I would need to provide evidence \nfor that, yes? As I am making a claim. If I was to assert that I could run \nat 40 mph I would need to provide evidence yet again, as I am making a \nclaim. Presumably you would agree with that? If you didn't think I could \nrun at 40mph because, as yet, you have not seen any evidence to back this \nclaim up, would you need to provide evidence of your own?  Would you need \nto offer proof that I could not run at 40mph? Would that be classed as a \nclaim?\n\nAre you suggesting that anything we cannot be 100% certain about is a \nbelief? ",

Rather, there is no clinical standard to say \"one who \nchooses religious / theist belief is therefore mentally inept.\" I \nappreciate you clarifying the meaning behind your poor choice in phrasing.\n\nYou're otherwise calling yourself daft, crazy, stupid, as well ignorant to \nbelieve as you do -- you have no sufficient evidence to term others in a \nnegative light for not perceiving life as you do. Instead of simply \ndismissing others for their views you lash out and espouse your own, while \ngiving me a baseless label of \"pedantic.\" If you can only express yourself \nvaguely, with poor selection of words, or needing to emphasize your \nperspective with curse words and insults then you open the door to be \ntalked down to -- speak like a grown up and I can look past the little \nthings, or at least give the benefit of the doubt to what you're trying to \nsay.\n\nI say you're illiterate because you've conveniently skipped over major \npoints of this discussion, repeating the same things others have tried & \nfailed to communicate.\n\nWhy raise the subject of atheism here? Mostly because of the amount of \n'atheists' who posted here about, \"why is this video lacking the greatest \nmystery of all -- why the hell do people believe in God?\" So you could say \n25% trolling and 75% curiosity to see how these self-proclaimed atheists \nrepresent atheism as a whole, or what it is they really believe / perceive.\n\nYes, the aim of my discussion was to argue one of the SEVERAL \nclassifications of atheism -- another point where I question your literacy, \nas I've already referenced my context of Immanuel Kant's argument of \n'rational agnosticism,' or Epistemological Atheism -- where I used such an \nargument about atheism against atheists.\n\nThen you say I'm changing the definition of atheism, while falsely defining \nme as 'religious?' At what point in the 200+ messages here have I \nidentified myself as religious? Again, questioning your literacy, because \nI've repeated over and over again that I've been arguing the perspective of \nEpistemological Atheism, but never once referred to myself as belonging or \nbelieving in any form of religion. You're free to enlighten me on either of \nthose points; when it was I declared myself religious, and where I've \ndefined atheism in a manner inconsistent with any definition / sect of \natheism.\n\n\"Atheism is not a belief system and does not require faith. It does not \ndictate that a god or gods do not exist. It is not a world view but is the \nstandard position.\"\n\nAnd the final reason I question your literacy, as it's been pointed out \nSEVERAL times that there are SEVERAL different classifications of atheism \nand your statement does not wholly represent all those views.\n\nIn conclusion, atheism remains a belief, no different than theism. Rational \nagnosticism, however, is what you're explaining; absent any certainty it is \nfoolish to declare certainty in any specific view.\n\nBut those who identify as \"atheist\" while stating, \"I don't believe in God \nor gods,\" or to say, \"there is no God or gods,\" are representing a belief \nsystem -- those atheists, as with theists, cannot PROVE their point of \nview, but have made their declaration to believe as they do.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being skeptical and open-minded, curious and \nindifferent, or apathetic in general . . . but again, when one declares it \none way or the other (as both atheists and theists have done throughout \nthis thread) it becomes a belief.",

We \njust can't prove it. So on that, science is as ignorant as belief.\n\nSecond: \"Why choose to make us out of flesh and blood? Why give us organs? \nWhy give us a bone structure?\"\nThat, my friend, is where evolution comes in. We have these stuctures \nbecause it is necessary to live for us. I'm a medical student and from that \nI can assure you that God couldn't have created us, because there is just \nto much evidence of evolution to ignore it. Therefore I think evolution is \na fact although it is described as a theory.\n\nI think people can believe if they want if it gives them hope, but know \nthis.

If you believe & even if you don't believe, the obvious \nthing to do here is to go back in ancient history- to humanity's \nbeginnings, (at least as far as we have discovered....) Do this with an \nancient language translator. translate these 3 words 1st- 1. God \n)=creatorS...a plural word. 2. Angel=messenger 3.bible=books(from the \nancient languages - original meanings) To make a decision about anything \nwithout seeking out the truth the understanding is NOT there and it is \nabout as intelligent as doing brain surgery and the only knowledge you have \nabout how &/or the reason you're doing it comes from watching 1-2 u tube \ninstructional videos that explain the overview of the process! You have NO \nway of knowing what nerves, tissues, blood vessels to no sever or how to \nrecognize them even if you had a\nlittle deeper knowledge of the complex intricate structure of the human \nbrain! In the same context, simply making an assumption or opinion of the \nexistence of \"God\" based on 1 point of view (one religion or belief or \nanother human explanation) without searching or learning beyond this \ninterpretation for yourself is shallow and can hurt more than just yourself \nbut others too.  You stunt your own mind and spirit!  Anything that is \nTRUTH that you learn about by searching for the bigger picture and a \nbroader understanding will be confirmed as true at least 2 x's, & likely \nway more than twice!  Science will back up truth discovered 9.8 out of 10 \ntimes! So if you want to prove any belief you choose .... Do your \nhomework!  Same goes if you want to prove someone else's opinion or belief \nwrong! Arguing over what you assume you were told truthfully about is 100% \ncompletely and utterly foolish and downright idiotically stupid! If you \nchoose to believe or not to believe is perfectly acceptable either \nway...... IF YOU ARE SURE OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR CHOICE and you are not \nmaking a choice WITHOUT getting ALL the information & knowledge possible- \nfrom all points of view.... COOL! But if a large part of the pieces are \nmissing, how can you honestly make a true assessment about what the picture \nis.  If the puzzle you are putting together is missing a large number of \nthe pieces throughout the entire picture how can you possibly know where \nmost of the existing pieces fit!??? Or how can you possibly be sure of what \nthe is in the picture?? You can't! If you are supposed to get to a \nparticular destination and the only possible way to find the way there \nrequires reading a  certain rare map, As you begin following this map and \nsomewhere along the way you assume that you have read enough and you know \nthe way, so you toss aside the map and go on your way.... a bit later you \nnotice that there are several other directions and the scenery looks the \nsame no matter where you look.... Now you don't remember this on the map \nbut you don't have it anymore, you tossed it way back there but which path \nwas the one you were on?!!!  Ooops!!! You assumed you knew all the \nimportant info, You KNEW you were right and KNEW the way, You made your \nmind up without taking a deeper look and now you realize you should have \nstudied and learned a whole lot more about how to get there than you did! \nYou should have become much more informed and you shouldn't have assumed \nyou had all the info! Now you are lost and and you didn't get all the \nimportant info! There is no way to find your way without learning \neverything you thought you could do without! Or same scenario except that \nalong the way you find out that you are missing at least one page of the \ndirections and they just happen to be the most important part! You realize \nthat you had plenty of opportunities to make sure you had all the pages, \nall the directions, and never bothered to check and verify all of the \ndirections were there. If you had looked for yourself instead of believing \neverthing others told you and at a shallow look it looked like all the \npages were there so you didn't bother to look any further and now you \ndo NOT have the slightest idea about where you are or what way you should \ngo! IT IS TOO LATE >>>>>>YOU DON\"T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO \nGET THE REST OF THE MAP OR THE MISSING PAGE OF THE DIRECTIONS!!!!  YOU HAVE \nTO BE THERE OR YOU WILL LOOSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT AND EVERTHING YOU \nNEED TO SUSTAIN YOUR   LIFE AND THE LIVES OF THOSE YOU LOVE! WOW!!!! What a \nconcept! Not getting all the available info before making a stand about a \nbelief is just as foolish as any one of the situations I described here. If \nyou don't agree..... then ask yourself this one question, ..... What if \nthere is even a slight chance that you need more truth and solid \ninformation before you make up your mind and a ways down the road you \nrealize you made a grave choice and it is too late to fix your bad \ndecision.  What if your life or someone you love life depended on having \nall the truth and info and ooops! you do not have it and cant get to \nit!???? To me even a 1% chance of making the wrong choice here would not be \nworth it!  I must look and find out all the missing info! Better safe than \nsorry for sure!  Think about it a while ...... then choose!\nREALLY ....... I BELIEVE YOU ....... YOU SAID IT SO IT'S TRUE..... THE \nCHECK IS IN THE MAIL!  YES, I WILL RESPECT YOU IN THE MORNING!  \nHELLO????!!!!",

Maybe favor with God? If \nGod/Unconditional Love chooses favorites, how's that unconditional, or any \nform of higher love? Maybe it's simply least and greater vibration...and \nperhaps it's best to \"Judge not, lest ye be judged\", because we have all \nchosen to forget we temporarily lowered our vibration to be better able to \n\"play in the fields of the Lord.\" The fields of the Lord is the experience \nof Good and Evil, where \"for everything there is a season...\"\nHere's some intriguing words: \"Even as ye do unto these, the least of my \nBrethren, so ye also do unto me.\" If Yeshua considered us less than \nHimself, why did He give us the word \"Brethren\", but NEVER anything like \nthe word \"Subjects\"?  If the Kingdom is within, why do we need an outside \ninfluence interceding for our salvation?

Whats worse is \nthat genuine idiots can now just get called \"trolls\" as if they were joking \nwith their comments all along whereby really all they are is .............. \nwell ......... just idiots.\n\nPeople should believe what they want as long as it doesnt impact others. It \nonly ever becomes a problem when it costs lives (religious wars) or is \nforced upon people (preachers, jehovas witnesses), or has incompatibilities \nwith societies (no burkas for security purposes).\n\nI think the topic attracts so much hostility because of the lunacy of \nfreedom of speech, equal rights, compatibility/lack thereof religions etc. \nDont get me wrong both are obviously fantastic regualtions BUT i think the \nbest example is the guy with the hook hand on the streets of london \npreaching kill the westerners whilst having no job and taking tax payers \nmoney on the doll etc takes the piss. Obviously things like that will stem \nhatred and frustration",

They know cause deep in their heart they understand the life of \nJesus. Now, you, according to your comments I believe your not a chirstian. \nWe Christians are not trying to make you believe, that's your choice. But \non our side. We don't use evidence. We use faith and dignity, And hope to \nrise him up. Now you must think I'm talking like what you describe 'shit' \nbut you also don't have evidence of why you are here on the first place. \nWhy you are talking to Christians who DO believe. Why you want to have \nevidence so much if you don't even care? Why do you care if people believe \nin god. It's their choice. Now, if you comment back saying thing like 'your \ntalking shit in the internet' it still doesn't prove why you care about \nevidence so much. Why you care that WE pick what we believe in life.",

Its \na very typical atheist formula. Religion isn't a harmful idea... racism, \nslavery, etc. are. Trying to put religion in the same category as those \nhorrible things is pretty rude. My religion is all about love, but people \nmake the religion \"harmful\" and we all get blamed for it. \nAttack ideas? sure harmful ones, but religion isn't one of them. \nIf someone has a religion that dosn't spew hate to an atheist, then why \ndoes the atheist has to create problems? It dosn't make sense unless the \natheist is a douchebag.\nAnd thats why atheists need to learn how to respect people, unless you want \nto have more problems in the world. ",

It's a theory. Get a dictionary and look \nthat word up. Then, go over what makes a scientific theory popular; \ncountless positives strengthening it with zero negatives rendering the \ntheory untrue. This is what advances the hypothesis into a well-accepted \ntheory. Our theory regarding gravity is one of these.\n\nSee it this way:\nI make a new theory that everything, when dropped, falls straight down. I \ndrop several items and, well damn, they fall. Then I drop a piece of paper \nand it goes flying away in the breeze. Is paper the exception to my rule? \nDid something lift the paper up? Either way, my theory is broken. Dropping \nstraight down is no longer an unconditional matter. There are variables \nwhich are throwing it off that I must now figure out through rigorous \ntesting.\n\nReligion is a similar principle, but instead of working off of positives \nwith zero negatives it's a gut feeling combined with zero negatives. I'm \nsure any rational religious folk would acknowledge that they're incorrect \nwhen a negative is provided. But none have been, so until then saying they \nare 100% right or wrong is impossible. You can disagree, but at that point \nit's a matter of opinion. Scientific theories that aren't proven themselves \ncannot be used as evidence, let alone proof, that these religious beliefs \nare false.\n\nSo hey, that invisible pink dragon may just as well be there. ;P",

Atheism is for weak people who are too afraid to answer \nand take responsibility for their actions.

It gives you a piece of mind to ignore the \"evils in high \nplaces of power\". Like a frog sitting in hot water, you pretend like the \ntemperature isnt coming to a boil because it threatens your false sense of \nsecurity. Its almost laughable when you claim people are \"crazy\" or \n\"ignorant\" for telling you to get out. You're the one who's weak. The truth \nhurts so you'd rather ignore it with lies about how the improbable is \npossible and how your great grandfather was some sort of a jelly fish. How \nrandom events gave birth to order, systems, and rules that if one was \nbroken or out of place, everything would fall apart. Because tornados can \nnow build houses. And living things can be birthed by the dead. Because a \nbunch of atheist claim that these are facts, the world population should \nswallow the \"do what you're told pill\" and pretend like religions doesnt \nrequest the same thing.\n\nWhat proof do you have to show these \"facts\" to be true? Their word of \nmouth? Please. Lets stop acting like those with power and knowledge have \nnever lied to the populace before.",

I'll give you \ncredit for 'knowing that your GOD has a penis (though for the life of me, I \ncannot figure out what 'HE' needs one for, but other than that, don't you \nget to know HIM 'personally' through the accepted book of your faith, The \nBible?That would be like thinking you know Frank Sinatra 'personally' \nbecause you read his biography, would it not? I was brought up in the \nCatholic church, have enjoyed studying many religions, mythologies (which, \nif we are going to be honest here, are just as 'valid' as any current \nreligion, save the fact that they are no longer current in popular cultural \nas systems of belief), was baptized and became active in the Baptist church \nfor a while, and truly mean no disrespect to anyone who chooses to believe \nin whatever they choose (because when it comes down to brass tacks, I have \nno way of actually 'knowing', and have a strong suspicion that regardless \nof what anyone says, that anyone else does, either), but what I find \ndisturbing about many 'believers' is their outright dishonesty to \nthemselves, and each other (and possibly their beloved Deity) by lying when \nthey say they 'know God personally', like they are golfing buddies, or \nsomething. If you do know him, send him over to my place for dinner next \nThursday, as I have a bunch of questions I'd love to ask \nHIM/HER/IT/EVERYTHING/VOICES IN MY HEAD/ETC. IF any of you can make this \nhappen, I will be back on Friday with a full apology to you and your \n'brothers' (as I will then KNOW (insert whatever here, as I don't even have \nthe creators real name) also. That would be awesome.And, PLEASE do not try \nto baffle me with some kind of hocus pocus mumbo jumbo...I want to eat \ndinner with your/our/possibly imaginary GOD, Thursday night, say around 5pm \n(burnt offering in the form of BBQ steaks, taters, and maybe a coupla \nbeers), and (I'll give you this one) HE should know where I live, since he \nknows everything else. However, if you cannot make this happen (unless of \ncourse HE is busy that day and wants to reschedule, which please let HIM \nknow that I prefer a phone call, as the voices in my head cannot always be \ntrusted as a solid connection) stop with the 'knowing him personally' BS, \nas according to the scripture, you cannot even pronounce his name, nor look \nat HIM directly. Do we have a deal? Cool. Thanks, and have a wonderful \nexistence...I was going to say 'friend', but I really do not know you \npersonally, even though I read what you write...you understand, right? Uh \nhuh...sure you do. Looking forward to Thursday. Chow!",

It was assembled by the Nicean Council quite a \nlong time ago to help cement what they felt were Christian ideals (with a \nhealthy dose of political influence to help consolidate power).  They had \nsome funny rules about which books could go into the canon, like 'no female \nauthors'.  It isn't hard to assemble a canon of books where its message \nremains the same if you get to choose the books you assemble into the \ncanon.  If you have the liberty of leaving out things like the books \nassembled into the Apocrypha (which contain things like The Gospel \nAccording To Mary, yet another creation story that seems to favor Lucifer, \nand other interesting ideas), you can make a message consistent.\n\nTaken with this information in mind, the bible really is an instruction \nbooklet.  It is a booklet of instructions less from some caring deity of \nsome kind, and more from a group of now long-dead men who wanted to \nmaintain control over other men, by convincing them that they would be \n'happy' despite the remarkably awful living conditions for the majority of \nEuropeans during Rome's decline, and the terrible feudalism that swept \nthrough the lands (not unlike what we're starting to experience in the \nUnited States, as the rich consolidate more wealth to themselves and leave \neveryone else following this same instruction booklet, or maybe the Quoran).\n\nFunny thing is, people generally seemed happier once scientific ideals were \nembraced rather than fought.  Our standard of living improved, and we \nstarted making useful tools once we stopped religiously following books \nlike the bible and started making cogent conclusions of our observations.\n\nYes, life is rather complicated.  Scientific observations have shown just \nhow complicated it is.  It's way more complicated than religious texts \nwould have you believe.  And its existence isn't necessarily proof of god's \nexistence or non-existence.\n\nYou can ascribe things that science hasn't explained yet to religion if it \nmakes you comfortable, but you steal curiosity from yourself with such \nexplanations, which may prevent you from wondering why certain observations \nare as they are.  After all, why bother trying to figure out if evolution \nis guided or not if you have convinced yourself that some unseen \nintelligence is pulling the strings?  Why bother trying to ascertain if \nthat unseen intelligence is a god or your own ancestors if you have \nconvinced yourself that it's a god pulling the strings?  Ironically, by not \ntrying to understand your observations, you risk not understanding god (if \ngod exists), or the reality in which you live (if god doesn't exist).\n\n(BTW: Not that I expect it, but don't trust everything I've written here as \ncorrect.  Research it yourself.  See if I'm full of crap, or have certain \ndetails wrong.  Do your own research).",

Also this idea is supported by the FACT that we share \nover 60% of our DNA with insects, 75% of our DNA is identical to reptiles, \nmost mammals have 90% of the same DNA as us, and we share 98% of our DNA \nwith chimps, our closest relatives. \n\nWrong, there are plenty of transitional forms in the fossil record which \nshow the progression of one life form to another, naturally certain \nanimals, particular soft bodied animals which our early ancestors would \nhave been, do not generally create fossils, but logical progression and \nGene mapping indicate there was a common ancestor.\n\nIf you and other Christians or Theists can prove the existence of god then \nwhy haven't you done it yet? No evidence of any substance has ever been \nposed to , much less accepted by, any notable scientific organisation in \nHISTORY.\n\nAlso you are a clear LIAR, you say you've researched Evolution yet your \noriginal comment showed a complete lack of knowledge on the subject and you \neven stated \"we're all monkeys route\" which is clearly your ignorance \nshowing. You're a liar, if you are going to be a dumb theist who knows \nnothing about Evolution at least admit it.\n\nSure, call it stupid without addressing ANY of the argumenst made except \nfor human behavior, which you unsurprisingly got wrong: Human Behavior \nshows indicators of us evolving, for example humans and other social \nanimals have more facial expressions due to their social nature, humans \nidentifying certain physical traits with health etc. Also humans did not \nevolve from beetles but we are related to them.\n\nAgain you demonstrate your lack of knowledge, a THEORY in scientific terms \nis a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world \nthat is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and \nconfirmed through observation and experimentation. NOT the colloquial use \nof the word. The theory of evolution is just as much fact as the theory of \ngravity. \"any credible scientist would admit this\" is that why every \nnotable scientific organisation accepts evolution as true? moron.\n\nMuch of the world's knowledge stems from ideas first developed and held by \ncertain highly intelligent individuals, Newton and gravity for example. \nAlso did you read what i wrote \"the cumulative knowledge of the world's \nscientists and the subsequent mass of evidence to support their claims\" the \nidea has been expanded upon and accepted by science as true.\n\n\"Believing a particular science, is as much as a religious movement as any \nother\" No it isn't you monumental idiot, Science is the REJECTION of dogma \nand the acceptance of only things that can be PROVEN,\n\nThe Egg. A creature that existed prior to the chicken, A sort of \nproto-chicken would have laid an egg containing a creature that would later \nbe defined as a chicken. Also Scientists don't accept ANY random idea as \nfact it has to be backed up with EVIDENCE.\n\nIt takes MILLIONS of years not hundreds of thousands. Also you are an idiot \nif you think you could observe evolution in real time.",

You're directly attacking your own beliefs \nthere. There is NO evidence! And I'm the idiot?

Besides there is no logical \nconclusion to any of it.\n\n\n\nAnyway, this can go backwards and forwards for all eternity, and this was \nthe exact reason I left it at my opinion and that's it. I'm not prepared to \npaste links, and argue the endless argument, I told you I can show you or \nany Christian can show you God, I told you what to do, I told you I and ALL \nother Christians can prove God exists, but YOUR arrogance prevents it. I've \nlooked at evolution on a mass scale, if gone done every avenue, and as much \nas my intelligence can possibly fathom there are too many faults. I have \nthe answer and the proof (if you're prepared to witness it first hand) I'm \nnot trying to convert you because the way I see it is one less annoying \nprick I have to put up with for eternity =] so it's win win for me.\n\nI've been down the \"we're all monkeys route\" and it is incredibly retarded \n>>> IMO <<< I believed it too until my eyes were opened, you can think it's \nstupid as much as you want, I really couldn't give a fuck tbh.\n\nIf you really believe in the words that you reach, get off your skreet and \nonto the streets, just don't try and argue something you'll never win or \njustify.\n\n\"F) There is OVERWHELMING evidence for the validity of the theory of \nevolution:The fossil record, gene mapping, genetic commonalities (related \nspecies), bacterial resistance to antibodies, common traits in embryos, \nhuman behavior, anatomy etc etc ETC!\"\n\nWell LOL, if you look at this in the right way, this again is stupid.\n\nSo an ape grabs a stick, smacks a bee hive to get honey and that's human \nbehaviour? WELL ROFL, I mean if I actually have to explain WHY this is so \nso so so so so stupid then there really is NO HOPE, I've seen a dung beetle \nrole a piece of dung down a hill, I've watched a human make a massive \nsnowball, and role it down a hill!!

Because one of the ultimate questions, and as common \nas God v Evolution/atheism w/e, IS \"What comes first? the chicken or the \negg?\" WELL as previously stated, and according to Darwin's hypothesis, the \nchicken would of had to come first, as a animal would of evolved into a \nchicken which in turn laid the egg...there we go hundreds of years of \ndebate solved by li'l ol me...maybe now I have such credibility I can put \nforward my theory for millions to follow...\n\nA duck, created from a volcano blew up creating thousand of meat chunks \nwhich in turn created plants, this inspired animals to magically form from \nspace dust.....then all the sudden!!!!!!!!!! a fish in a random ass pond \nturned into a marsupial which then turned into an ape which then turn into \nyou mongs above, which THEN created Humans and then some random put a cap \non it so evolution could not take place anymore.\n\n\n It's been \"apparently\" 400,000 years ( like 4 years ago it was BILLIONS of \nyears ) which still is under debate lol - and nothing has even remotely \nstarted to change within the human race OR primate.",

                    "text": "+LORDUnLuCkY13  Right time to shut you all up, Enjoy the read.\n\nThe biggest problem for evolutionists is the origin of life from non-life. \nEven the simplest single-celled organism is unthinkably complex, with \nscores of highly-sophisticated parts, all performing important functions \nand all mutually interdependent. The laws of statistics have convinced all \nwho have bothered to calculate that even a protein molecule, consisting as \nit does of a chain of hundreds of precisely arranged amino acids, could \nnever arise by chance. And such a protein molecule is trivial compared to \nany of the working parts of a cell. When it is recognized that all of these \nparts must be present and functioning at the start, it must be admitted \nthat life from non-life is impossible without intelligent design. Actually, \nany living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent \ndesigner that only a willful ignoring of the data (II Peter 3:5) could lead \none to assign such intricacy to chance. Every living thing, from simple \nbacteria to people, possesses the marvelous DNA code, which contains a \nlibrary full of precise information, and without which life is impossible.\nAnother huge problem for evolutionists lies in the nature of the fossil \nrecord, i.e., the only physical record we have of life in the past. As is \nnow being admitted by my evolutionary colleagues, the fossil record gives \nno clue that any basic type of animal has ever changed into another basic \ntype of animal, for no in-between forms have ever been discovered. Each \nbasic type is distinct in the modern world and in the fossil record, \nalthough there is much variation within these basic types. While gradual, \n\"Darwinian\" evolution has always predicted that in-between forms would one \nday be found, the current rage in evolutionary circles is the concept of \nrapid evolution, or \"punctuated equilibrium\"\u2014proposing that small isolated \nportions of a larger population evolved rapidly and left no fossils. But \nwhere is the evidence that they evolved at all?\nEven though the gaps in the fossil record are found between each basic \nanimal type, there are two huge gaps, which should be emphasized. The \nevolutionary distance between single celled organisms and the vast array of \nmulticellular, highly complex marine invertebrates precludes even rapid \nevolution. In the supposedly 600-million-year-old layers of rock designated \nas Cambrian (the first appearance of multicelled life), sponges, clams, \ntrilobites, sea urchins, starfish, etc., etc., are found with no \nevolutionary ancestors. Evolutionists don't even have any possible \nancestors to propose. And then the gap from marine invertebrates to the \nvertebrate fish is likewise immense. To make matters worse for the \nevolutionists, fish fossils are also found in Cambrian strata. If evolution \nis true, fish must have evolved from something, and invertebrates must also \nhave evolved from something. Evolution has no ancestor to propose, but the \nevidence exactly fits the creation model, for creation insists that each \nanimal type was created fully formed, with no evolutionary transition.\nThe evidence for creation is so strong; it is illogical to believe anything \nelse. Only a religious commitment to atheism, or a desire for the approval \nof those atheists, who call themselves scholars, could lead one down this \npath. The Bible says that those who deny creation are \"without excuse\" \n(Romans 1:20).\n\nWhen you fit in the missing gaps that even the \"experts\" can't fathom, I'd \nask for your buddy further up the comment tree for some help if I was you \nsonny\n\nUsing Words doesn't justify your maturity you idiot, calling someone a \nretard when you have the exact same arrogance against my beliefs would make \nyou one too.\n\nThe evidence is there in black and white, research try to figure it out I \ndon't care, join the other millions of scientists desperately looking for \nthe answers that will NEVER BE FOUND.\n\nThis is exactly why I don't associate myself with an ape, un-intelligent, \nstupid, morons that just wave there stick around without hard evidence.\n\nDon't question my intellect as it clearly surpasses all of your put \ntogether as you've believed your ancestor is a monkey for the last what \never years lol.\n\n\nI rest my case.\n\nGutted?",

Forming the world with people \nwho have very different ideals and beliefs from one another, once again \nwith the same believes standing at their respective places.\nOne is science and one is God.\nNow, people lean on God and people lean on science, but the truth of the \nmatter here is that we aren't that different. To believe that the world was \ncreated by a God versus believing life was born by a universal explosion, \nhonestly, they both take a lot of faith to believe in. And that's the bond \nof humanity, we believe in something and we will stand by that belief with \nour lives if it's threatened and insulted. We are all the same in this way.\ufeff",

The first 2 laws of \nthermodynamics, the expansion of the universe, the chances of earth being \nin the goldilocks zone.  It stated the earth was round when thought to be \nflat, it has predicted the return of the Jews to there homeland after being \nspread out for 2000 years and retaining their language.  The real problem \nis people do not keep an open mind because they feel they need to defend \nthere belief and they get irritated.  Most people have never actually \nstudied the bile or evolution.  Darwin actually renounced his theory before \nhis death.  I use to think the bible was hard to believe and my thoughts \nhad many holes in them, until about 20 years ago I decided to study the \nbible as well as other religions and evolution.  When you fill in the \nholes, it all makes perfect sense.  There is a lot to consider before \ncondemning another belief from both Christians and Darwin supporters.  I \npersonally have no doubt that the bible is true.  It is up to every man to \ndecide for himself.  I can say that at least you are taking an interest in \nwhere you came from.  That's more than most people do.\n ",

Religion asks why, Science figures out how. The whole point of \nScientific theory (and no, theory isn't \"I think...\" it's the best, most \neducated answer we have so far that isn't 100% confirmed and is designed to \nbe built upon) is to find out the answers, no matter how long the process. \nScience doesn't just leave it as is because a magic man said so in a book \nwhich wasn't even written by him - God doesn't have a pen. You know, we \nused to believe God had made the world flat, and it was held up by a bunch \nof pillars. We also used to believe that God had put the Earth at the \ncentre of the universe, as we were the \"focal point of creation.\" Science \n(Galileo to be precise) discovered otherwise and Galileo released a book \nabout his discovery. Wonder what the Church's response was? He was forced, \nas a 70 year old man, to get on his knees, kiss the popes ring and renounce \nhis work as the writings of a madman.\n\nYou know, God is becoming the God of the gaps nowadays. Now that Evolution \nhas gathered enough evidence to be considered a fact, Christians are now \nsaying that God created the wiring needed for Evolution to take place, \ninstead of God creating life as it was and it's always been perfect. Now \nthat the Big Bang Theory has been all but proven, as it's impossible, \nChristians are saying that God set all the chemicals in place to make it \nhappen, instead of the whole seven day bullshit.\n\nChange is slowly happening, only time will tell how long it will take for \nreligion to die out.\ufeff",

Imagine you find half an apple. It's \nreasonable to assume that it had a second half. Even if said second half \nfell into a black hole, and no longer exists, we know that an apple \"makes \nsense\" as a whole, and therefore a half-apple \"makes sense\" as having had \nanother half attached to it.\n\nOur universe has sufficient evidence to show it is like a \"half apple\".

Sir Issac Newton was someone who came up with a \nhypothesis, tested it out probably thousands of times, and came to a \nconclusion that made sense for a long time(remember, this was back in the \n1600's). Proving a theory wrong in science is commonplace. And there are \ntimes where it isn't proven wrong, just...improved from what it was. But, \nwith Religion-from my experiences-everything is absolute. It happened this \nway. This way is right, that way is wrong. If it isn't like this, then \nyadda yadda you're going to Hell, or you're going to be eaten by this \ncertain entity.

That wouldn't make sense. If Earth was \nmade with man in mind then why do we not have unlimited resources? If 'God' \nloves us so much that he would attack his previous creation (Angels) over \nus what would stop 'God' from getting teired with 'man' and creating a \nbetter race of being? As the universe is forever expanding wouldn't \nChristians then believe that 'God' has moved on and is making more planets \nwith other versions of humans? \n:P My 10yr old Science book is out dated yet you expect me to follow a book \nthat is 2000 years old, crazy.\ufeff",

He's depicted as a very frightening power \nwith a justice system very different to ours' more so than a tender, loving \nGod who would give us a cuddle every day if he could. Just because when we \nlove each other we don't smite them doesn't mean an almighty superpower \nisn't going to do so despite his love for you. It's like getting smacked on \nthe butt by your parents when you do something wrong, but with 10000% more \ndeath and -100% less chance to learn from your mistakes. :P\n\nNow I'm not saying religion is fact, just that your argument sounds 99% \nsourced from the New Testament and based purely on \"If God is so nice, why \ndid this bad stuff happen?\" more so than fact.\n\nAs a side-note, your science book probably goes over a lot of scientific \n*theories*. Please don't believe these as fact. They are *theories*. At the \ndrop of a hat they may be disproven and replaced with a new theory, whether \nthat new one be mostly similar or largely different.",

Take a cell phone for \nexample; humans create them but look at how complex all the electronics and \ncomponents are inside of one. The hardware of a phone alone is not enough \nto make it work tho, it also takes software which allows it to function. \nBoth hardware and software have to be in sync for the product to exist and \nwork. Its too many laws and rules for physics and biology for there not to \nbe a god. You think everything works the way it works and is the way it by \nrandom? Everything from how gravity works, to the existence of light, to \nthe genome of species and its cellular structure all the way down to the \natoms, literally everything and anything. You are a FOOL if you believe \nthere's no God. Plain and simple\ufeff",

Houses, abandoned, and no \nsign of a fight. They found nothing that could explain the mysterious \ndisappearance. The only thing they found was a message carved in a tree \nthat read, 'Croatoan'. (I think thats what it said, it could be something \nelse.) So, the settlers either left for a nearby island called Croatoan \nIsland sure to the lack of supplies, our they were attacked by a native \ntribe called the Croatoans. \ufeff",

So yes everyone does go to heaven, \nunless your completely embellish the satanic beliefs or a misotheist.

                "text": "Atlatntis wasn't a city, it was a really big island almost big as australia \nthat had alot of cityes, the cityes were build on a form of the tree of \nlife  and had 1 extra branch. The cityes were bild by the humans who were \nall 12 year old girls, and 2 cityes were left unbuild. Then came the \nMarsians who were all 75 old men who came to earth using piraminds on their \ndestroyed world to make a portal to Earth. They were were agresive and we \nknow that becuse they had a war that destroyed Mars. They breeded with the \n12 year old humans and thats how we were made. The origin of the Marsians \nis unknown and the origin of the humans. It is also sed that in the bermuda \ntriangle has a portal to Mars that was made by accident becuse of the \nmagnetic field of the islands. And Antlantis sunk becuse of a war beetwen \nthe humans and Marsians. Also there was 1 other race that was made from \nbreeding humans and Marsians, but i forggot the name, and they could \ncontrol and make things from their mind and had a 3rd eye. Also from the \nfuture came the humans that also had power to do what ever they want with \ntheir mind. It is also sed that 10 Marsians survived and they are known as \nthe Illuminati. If you ask how we know these, well the answear is that the \ngreat piramid of Giza was build from the air down and that a room deep \nbellow is build that holds a space ship that is 3 atoms big and i think 13 \nmm wide and it protects the Earth. And even deeper you can find a giant \ncity made from gold and emerald. A tunnel to the city was found near the \npiramind and in the tunnel were found emerald tablets with writtings that \nwe got all of these information from. The tablets were put in a really \nstrong furnace to melt, and even on the tempreture hot as the sun, the \ntablets wouldnt melt. The city was never found becuse the tunnel was soon \nto collapse after finding the tablets. You do not have to believe these, it \nis your choice to believe or not to believe.\nMore evdience: Becuse we were created from to races that could control \ntheir mind really well and speak with each other through their minds, we \nare connected. After WW2 in Australia people were shown pictures with faces \nwith hidden faces in them. Nobody saw the hidden faces. The they \nbroadcasted the places of the faces only in England and when they shown it \naround The World everyone knew where the faces were. Also we do not have \nthe knowlage they had becuse every couple thousand years the world changes \npoles and The Earth falls into a Deep Void for 3 days and we lose all of \nour knowlage. These now happens every 13 thousand years, and it is dropping \nevery time, the first time it happend it was every 360 thousand years, or \nsomething like that. We have proof for these to becuse a more advanced \nhibride of humans and Marsians that i mentioned earlyer was alive to see \nthese 4 times and passed the knowlage to a man in Afrika. These was dont a \nlong time ago and it is sed that the man still lives and is almost \nimmortal, the hibrid that gave him these knowlage has given him his powers \nbecuse he was dying. The man from Afrika wrotte the knowlage on tablets \nthat were found and translated. The Afrikan went to the future with other \nhibrids where all humans have unlimited power with their minds. These story \nis a Top Secret government file that arheologist and other people \ntranslating and finding the tablets told some people who told the story to \nother people.\ufeff",

Yeah, there called characters. The Bible is \nnothing but a big collection of stories thought of by many minds all on \nroughly the same subject, filled with many characters. Oh, and don't claim \nthat Christianity was founded as a result of Jesus, there were these people \ncalled Jews that had believed of his arrival many millennia before it \nsupposedly happened. Thou shalt not kill, who were the crusades ordered by, \noh yeah the church. Who did they kill , Innocent people. The church ordered \nthe killing of hundreds of Innocent women, in England alone, during the \nwitch trials, don't say that live, love and be kind is all you Christians \nhave done and that you're not forcing you're beliefs on anyone else because \nits a Blatant lie and you are. Don't deface the Georgia Guide stones, they \nmay not have a nice message but they certainly weren't written by \nSatanists. Be careful who you trust. I will thx.

Solid sources, please. \nSecondly, you're correct in saying that the Big Bang has not been proven, \nnor can it be (I would encourage you to research the fundamental principles \nof the scientific method); however, it's the most likely scenario based on \nthe evidence. It has been 'second opinioned' a great deal, if you're \nreferring to peer review, as I think you are. The fact that's it's accepted \nas the working model of the genesis of the universe speaks to that. Like \nany good theory, it specifies conditions for its falsifiability (a \nsteady-state universe, for example); if any scientist supplied \nincontrovertible proof that it is false, they would win the Nobel \nprize (and lots of money and respect) without a doubt. Lots of scientists \nare trying to do just that; they haven't managed yet, but that doesn't mean \nthat they won't in the future. And that would be great, because we'd be one \nmore step along the road to knowledge.\nThirdly, you cannot 'disprove' God for precisely the same reason you CAN \ntheoretically disprove the Big Bang - claims of God's existence offer no \nconditions for their falsifiability. God's claimed existence is an \nunfounded assertion, which can be used to explain everything without \nrecourse to any evidence; I can use the same trick with any fictitious \ncharacter I care to imagine, and you'd be hard-pressed to refute my \nassertions.

When I was in high school, another \nstudent who was younger than me committed suicide, and even though I didn't \nknow him personally, my best friend was close to him and I know he probably \nwondered why nothing happened to prevent him from taking his own life. \nSimilarly, I have wondered why people who I have known have died from \nillnesses (like cancer), in spite of how strong they were. \n\nI don't believe that your friend deserved to die the way he did, and I \ndon't believe that the people who were killed by Hitler deserved to die in \nthe Holocaust either. However, I do believe that some things that happen \nare simply out of our hands. I believe that everything will work out in the \nend, but that this current life is filled with challenges. The Bible \nacknowledges that we are presented with challenges to overcome. That book \nalso tells us the way that God gave every human being the free will to make \nhis or her own choices. You chose to care about your friend's well-being, \nand you are now choosing to remember him. Every person from Hitler to \nMartin Luther King Jr. has been able to make his or her own decisions. \nEvery action that we take has results, too. I believe that God will judge \nall of us based on our actions. Until then, we can learn something from \nevery event that happens in our lives, even if some events are difficult to \nhandle. Even when bad things happen, the good things that come along can \nhelp to comfort us and strengthen us. That's how I believe God helps us, if \nwe just ask him for help. \n\nAnyway,  I just wanted to let you know that I have been in your position \nbefore. Stay strong. ",

                "text": "The \"God\" topic...\n\nIt is striking to me, about just how ignorant the majority of people are \nabout religion, God, Christianity, the bible, and other religions... \n(though, it probably shouldn't be so unexpected as I was equally ignorant \nat one time).  Most of the arguments presented by believers in this forum \nare easily dismissed. \n\nI can, with great confidence, say that most believers (especially those \nposting here) simply accept what their parents and other authority figures \nhave told them without ever having investigated the claims for themselves.  \nAs I was a self-claimed Christian for 28 years of my life, I did the same \nthing.  And the majority of those who claim to have investigated, have \nreally only read the scriptures of their beliefs for evidence that the \nscripture is true instead of investigating the history of the religion.  \nUsing the bible as evidence that the bible is true is a fallacy called \ncircular reasoning.  It's no different than saying the Egyptian god, Ra, is \nreal because it's written on the walls of their buildings.  I would bet \nthat most people don't understand that Thor and Odin are not just Marvel \ncomic book characters, but they were worshiped and praised just as Jesus \nand YHWY (Christian god) are today.  This applies to all literature which \nwe identify as mythology.  (Mythology = religion which is no longer \npracticed)\n\nThat said... there is no evidence that a god exists, nor is there any \nreason to think that one does.  Any claim to \"evidence\" supporting god, or \nreference to any natural occurrence suggesting to support the \"god\" claim \nis simply a demonstration of that particular individual's level of \nignorance in regards to science and how our universe actually works.  The \nonly arguments \"for god\" which have any chance of being true are held in \nthree specific areas of science for which we do not yet have a sufficient \nexplanation; Beginning of the Universe (notice I did NOT say \"creation\", \nthere is no evidence to suggest it was deliberately \"created\"); The \nBeginning of Life (same.. ); and the emergence of consciousness \n(specifically the concept of \"self\", not just neuron input and response). \n\nThese \"places\" in which we do not have a sufficient natural explanation are \nknown as \"gaps\", and when god is used as the explanation it's known as a \n\"god of the gaps\".  While many theologists, such as William Lane Craig, \nwill claim there is no such thing as a \"god of the gaps\", it is quite clear \nthat that this the only kind of god which has ever existed.  We used to \nhave many gaps during the days when Thor, Zeus, and Poseidon were worshiped \nin order to explain things like, thunder, lightning and tidal waves.  Now \nthat we understand the nature of our environment, we no longer need gods to \nexplain those natural phenomena.  Thus, as history shows, the \"evidence\" \nfor the existence of god diminishes at a rate identical to that at which \nour scientific understanding of our natural world increases.\n\nThe most concise and logical explanation that there is no reason to believe \na god exists is as follows:  All things that have ever been proven, have \n100% of the time been demonstrated to be the product of natural processes.  \nThis leaves no reason to suspect that any further discoveries will ever be \ndemonstrated to be anything but the product of natural processes.\ufeff",

We never really did talk about religion in the house, but \nmy mom did take me to Sunday school until I was about 5 or 6 years old, and \nI did go to church off and on as a kid with some friends. That being said; \nI never believed in any sort of religion. One of my earliest memories is of \nme actually sitting in church and feeling uncomfortable upon figuring out \nthat people thought the bible contained real stories. I honestly held the \nbible in the same light as the children's fables that try to teach you \nlessons on how to be a better person, and that church was just a communal \ngathering. \nAfter that I never really thought of religion or why I didn't believe it. I \njust knew I didn't and some people did (but I never talked about my \nfeelings because I was scared to). I still went to church off and on, but \njust kept my mouth shut.\nI was very much ignorant/oblivious when it came to religion. Hell, I didn't \neven know that the title of atheist existed until I was 14. haha\n\nNow, as to not ramble, I started looking for reasons for my atheism around \n16 years old; starting off by watching Youtube atheist videos, watching \nscience documentaries, and things of that nature.  While I held my beliefs \nfirmly before then, that new found information just concreted everything \nfor me. \nAround the same time though, out of general interest, I started studying \nthe occult. I always found it interesting and fun to read about. As for \nwhat I wanted to believe during my time of weakness; it was still very much \natheism in a way. It was just a way for me to try to escape my problems, \nand in turn I searched for fulfillment in trying to force myself to believe \nin something that I only had interest in as a subject study.  After going \nthrough all these play on words and mental gymnastics, I still knew that I \ndidn't truly believe in anything of that manner, and then noticed why I \ntried in the first place. \nJust for reference, that little stint lasted a few months. I never tried to \njoin in groups/orders, did any sort of ritual or prayer, or anything like \nthat. It was very much just a mental thing to try to hide from my problems. \nSorry for writing so much, but I wanted to be very clear. ",

They certainly wouldn't have a record of \nher blood. Police officials didn't record or collect samples of those \nthings as they had no reason to.

We are naturally animals. A child \nturning out bad is dependent on influence around them.

Some people will believe in science, which has produced \nmedications to cure people of parasites, to perform operations to save \npeople after car accidents or a poor turn in health, and to get us to the \nmoon; while other people will believe in the Bible, which is nothing more \nthan a book. I don't believe in the Bible, but some morals I can support. \nJesus said \"Love thy neighbor\", and anybody who says \"Those who don't \nbelieve in the Bible are retarded!\" or \"Those who don't believe in science \nare retarded!\" is not following that lesson. You are not following Jesus's \nlesson, so don't you dare call yourself a devout \nCatholic/Christian/whichever you choose to describe yourself as.\nI am a different case all together. I won't sit here and say \"Religion is \nbullshit!\", nor will I sit here and say \"Science is bullshit!\" I can't \nargue against your claim, because you clearly have made up your mind on \nwhat you believe. As long as people stand on one end of the spectrum, both \nscientists and religious nuts will be at each other's throats. However, \nplease hear me out.\nScience has gotten things accomplished. Science has made discoveries in \nmedicine, science has created the Internet, science has created so many \nthings to save - and end - lives. However, science can't prove everything. \nScientifically speaking, the bumble bee should not be able to fly. And yet \nit does. Some people have come back from the grave. However, things that \nhave been told after death are scary. Some people come back and say \"I saw \nGod!\", but some children are able to solve mysteries on how their past life \nwas murdered because they had been reincarnated, or so the claim goes, and \nthe pieces come together.\nWhat has religion taught us? Not much. It hasn't developed the Internet or \nany break-through technologies, but here's the catch: I believe in \nmiracles. Some peoples' faith is actually what they claim brings them \nthrough a tough time. There have been cases of people who should by all \nmeans have died but somehow they cling to their last threads of life and \nwake up on the operating table. Then there's the bumble bee.\nNow here's what ties religion and science: nobody knows how the universe \nwas created. All of it is just theory. Because nobody was there when the \nfirst star came to be, there is no one to say what happened. And I know \nthat some people are going to say, \"Oh if anything that proves God is \nreal!\" but it doesn't. Could God exist? Nothing says yes, but at the same \ntime, nothing says no. Are there multiple gods? There's no proof one way or \nthe other. Is the after life just some kind of mash-up of every speculation \nin existence? Maybe, maybe not. No one will know until they die, but once \nthey die, that is it. There is no coming back. Once you die, and once \nyou've been dead, you're gone. Then you know what happens.\nI feel like religion and science could do some amazing things if they'd set \nit all aside and get into some kind of mindset. We don't have to love each \nother, but we shouldn't hate each other. Scientists will agree that hating \nsomeone for no reason is dumb, and any Catholic or Christian who is as \ndevout as they claim should know that Jesus said \"Love thy neighbor.\" It \nmay not happen, but because religion can't be proven one way or the other, \nand science is still hazy. I feel like people should be taught as soon as \npossible to keep an open mind and to think for themselves, instead of \nimmediately letting a book or test tubes think for them. Let's face it, the \nBible isn't perfect; it says that a rapist is entitled to buy their victim \nas a slave, and there was once an error in a printing where it said \"Thou \nshall commit adultery\" instead of \"Thou shall not commit adultery\". And \nhey, science isn't perfect either. Heck, tapeworm eggs were sold as a \nmiracle dieting pill before people realized it was killing them. The issue \nhere is the fact that both religious nuts and science nuts tend to jump on \nthe bandwagon too soon. I feel like we should delve into both with open \narms, slowly and steadily at first, taking baby steps and learning to love \neach other before we hate. Then perhaps, by some God-sent yet scientific \nmiracle, we can all get along a little better.",

Your a bunch of whiners who just assume everyone is attacking \nyou. NO. We are simply trying to stomp out ignorance and judgement. You \nwanna talk about \"Poor pitiful me?\" then let's talk about how thanks to \nyour fucking religion I can't get married to my boyfriend? How about that \none? Oh, no comment other than either you don't believe gay marriage is \nwrong (Then you don't follow your religion obviously) or \"The Bible says \nit's wrong\" so what? Keep it to yourself. If you christians are going to \nhave such a loud fucking opinion that it keeps others from being happy, \nthen damn right I'm going to break down your crapfest religion until you \nhave nothing left to stand on, because in the midst of YOU being happy, you \nare stripping  others of THEIR rights and whining how everyone is out to \nget you and attack you  when it seems to me, your the only ones left in \nthis Country attacking the rights of others, and being dicks about things \nYOU have no fucking control over, like love. Jesus you people are martyrs \nAND hypocrites. You really think God would be proud of you stripping \nother's rights in your tyrannical path to your Jesus? Your trying to own \nthe world and what people in it are allowed to do based off YOUR shitty \nbelief in some unseen unproved god. Oh, you've FELT the presence of God? \nWell I've FELT the love between me and my boyfriend but your allowed to \nshowboat your shit thats not even real and I can't even say it out loud \nwithout persecution. and all you do is whine and complain that nobody \nunderstands your religion and people just attack you all the time *Swoon \nand faint* because your life as a rich entitled Christian is so fucking \nhard here in this God fearing country where people don't ACTUALLY have \ntheir say unless they believe in Jesus. At least if your going to come up \nwith such a steaming pile of crap, don't complain about how hard it is to \nstand by it.",

But apparently religious fanatics are on that short list of people \nwho DON'T grow or change since , from the beginning of their \"reign\" in \nsociety they've done nothing but try to prove others wrong for their own \nbeliefs or non beliefs. Do you realize it was Christians that pushed their \nway into society and changed things to agree with THEIR point of iew to \nbegin with? They were NOT originals, they were radicals, obnoxious radical \nidealists that spawned from their egotistical belief that their way of life \nwas better because they knew \"so much more\" and could \"Make things the way \nthey were supposed to be\" when my question is, who the fuck gave you all \nthis knowledge on \"How it's supposed to be\"? God? Cause as far as I'm \nconcerned he hasn't given you much knowledge at all since your still \ndebating the same shit over and over and over. Your Bible was written by \nmen, several men and translated through thousands of languages over years \nand years of misinterpretation.

Your Argument is invalid, please try again \nReligion, but thank you for playing.
