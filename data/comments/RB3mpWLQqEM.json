I'll admit I smoke pot and I don't live in a \nstate where it is legal.\n\nBut I think it comes down to:\nA) Is someone criminally responsible for violating a law that has and will \nbe found to be unjust? \nB) Should someone be released for knowingly violating a law that existed at \nthe time?\n\nLike I said, I do smoke pot. But I do so knowing that I could be arrested \nand I have been arrested for possession. Regardless of if the law changes, \nI knew what I was doing was illegal whether I thought it was just or not. \nShould my conviction be wiped from my record?\n\nPart of me says that these people should be released and part of me says \nthat these people (like myself) knew that they were violating the law. \n\nI guess another point would be; why when it is illegal federally should one \nstates \"criminals\" get a pass when people who do the same thing in other \nstates don't?\n\nI personally think it should be legal federally, however until it is I \ndon't see how a state can bypass federal law to give their citizens \nimmunity that doesn't apply to inhabitants of other states. It seems like \nthey get \"special\" treatment federally because of the state that they live \nin.\n\nIt's a very rare situation where the federal government doesn't enforce the \nlaw on the state level, but it seems like they are discriminating against \nmost other states and their citizens with this ruling. If you are in say \nIllinois, you will stay in jail because it is illegal, but if you like in \nColorado you don't have to live by the same federal rules.\ufeff",

In practice, the law applies \nto you equally whether you agree with it or not, but there are \ncircumstances where the experiences from decades of trials and observation \ndone while the law was fully active, tell us that the law wasn't actually \nenhancing the overall quality of life for its' citizens.\n\nOne example from history of such a law is the prohibition of alcohol from \nthe 30's. Afterward, it was easy to see that the ones who benefitted the \nmost from alcohol being illegal, were the criminals who smuggled it. The \nenforcement of that law also cost tremendous sums of taxpayer money. Sure, \nit's reasonable to say that alcohol can cause societal problems, like drunk \ndriving and violent crimes, but apparently, making it illegal didn't have \nthe positive effect they were hoping for.\n\nThe weed laws are quite similar, and the problems with wasted tax money are \nstill here, but medically, the ill effects of marijuana are far less than \nthose of alcohol. I say some problems should be dealt with by other means \nthan illegalizing them.",

Not one.\n--- You then say \"drugs and weed.\"  No other drugs are being discussed.\n--- Nothing you said is \"just a fact,\" so if \"everybody knows it,\" it's \nstill wrong.\n\nBut best of all: \"Many people have died from overdose on *alcohol*. Its \njust a fact that everyone knows that *alcohol* kills.\"\n\nI read an estimate some years ago that alcohol contributes to 75,000 deaths \na year in the US.  Some 35,000 were alcohol-related diseases (liver \nfailure, mostly), and the rest were car crashes and other accidents.\n\nReason, that thing you lack, leads one to question why a drug as dangerous \nas alcohol is legal in the first place.

We have our *moral* values, we have \n*scientific* facts and we have a *market* value system; sometimes none of \nthem are in sync. It can be difficult to know how to best benefit human \nsociety in such a dilemma.\n\nA *moral system* (meaning, a system used in a society that respects and \nprotects the individual, enforcing justice and fairness in general) renders \nsafety, happiness and therefore, productivity.\nA *scientific system* cares about what's true, and provides knowledge to \ninform our decisions.\nA *market system* allows for interactions that are mutually \nbeneficial between individuals and societies, and provides a monetary \nstandard for evaluating the worth of a product or service.\n\nIn capitalism, which is the financial system used today, the *market value* \nis the only value taken into account, which creates many situations where \nthe most financially beneficial choice neither conforms with moral values \nor with what is scientifically sound.
