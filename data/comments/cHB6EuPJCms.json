These all end up the \nsame using the same tropes and stereotypes without having anything to back \nit up. A great example of breaking the mold would be 21 jump street where \nall the cool kids were the nerds etc. and that everyone questions the age \nof the leads as being high school students when clearly they were adults. \nNot to mention how you can find any of the characters likable as their \nstereotypes deems them so, like how can the lead find the jock as a love \ninterest(which it will by the mid point of the movie) when he calls her by \nsuch standards. How can we like the lead when she can't be herself but has \nto bend and mold herself into what everyone wants her to be?\ufeff",

Both leads in The Duff (Robbie Amell and Mae Whitman) \nare 26 years of age! Granted, Mae Whitman could pass for 19, but Amell is \nno doubt beyond his pubescent years. Could there be a shortage of younger \ntalent, or does Hollywood simply insist on making teens feel physically \ninadequate? Perhaps X-Men Apocalypse will break this trend?  Thanks, \nGrace:) Beyond the Trailer has been a huge inspiration on my life, and I \nhope to cover movies, as you do, after graduation! Cheers:)     \ufeff",

                "text": "DUFF, according to this movie, is supposed to stand for Designated Ugly Fat \nFriend. How does the lead actress in this movie fit the definition of ugly \nor fat? She is far from fat, and she is not ugly. She has an attractive \ngirl next door look. The vast majority of regular guys would find her \nattractive. She might not be bombshell attractive or Victoria Secret \nattractive, but she has an everyday beauty. In terms of her weight, there \nis probably a meager 5 lbs difference between her and her \"hot\" friends. \nThis is hardly significant. If Hollywood is attempting to make a movie to \nappeal to the esteem of \"regular\" girls, who have body image issues, this \nis not a good example. If the producers of this movie are really interested \nin offering a social critique, they should have hired an actress that was \nthe exact antithesis of the Hollywood ideal- not someone who looks very \nclose to the ideal, but is just missing a few features or has a minuscule \namount of extra weight. They need to hire a girl who really looks heavy, \nand whose face is really unattractive. Then the movie would have the right \nto be called a bold social commentary. This is still playing it safe. This \nmovie reminds me of \"She Is All That\", a movie that came out 1999. That \nfilm had the audacity to portray Rachael Leigh Cook, a woman who is \nexceptionally good looking, as a nerdy \"unattractive girl\" by putting \nglasses and frumpy clothes on her. It didn't fool anyone. \ufeff",

Grace called out Best Man's Holiday for having only one white \ncharacter, but there is no mention of how Ken Jeong is the only person of \ncolor in this trailer and probably in the whole movie.\n\nWhat is it about Duff or Fault in Our Stars that will make them instant \nclassics or have strong cult fanbases but not Beyond the Lights. They're \nall formulaic; we basically know how each of these movies will turn out, \nthe leads are all attractive, the themes are universal, so... just what is \nit?\n\nI understand that Grace is talking about the likely success of this movie, \nand I agree with her assessment; however, I'm sick to death of movies that \nseem to only differ from each other in the race of its cast but they are \nnot being received by audiences with the same level of enthusiasm. But of \ncourse it's never about the racism of white audiences, they aren't telling \nHollywood and Hollywood isn't listening to them that they want and need \nwhite faces on screen so they can engage and identify with the characters.\n\nEvidenced by how they consistently refuse to support movies starring actors \nof color and instead of confronting their own racial preferences they blame \nblack, Asian, and Latino productions for being too esoterically ethnic. \nWithout even a second thought that they could be doing the same thing to \naudiences of color with their all/ mostly white casts in movies. White \nfaces, experiences, and perspectives are so universal that white actors can \neven play people of color more *effectively* than actors of the original \nrace or ethnicity.\ufeff",
