                "text": "America is such a backwards country in so many things. Look, you pay for \ninsurance, through a private plan, you pay for other people's healthcare. \nIt's a pool, thanks to a coupe of Scottish priests, in the 18th century, \nthere became this system, were by you can pay a company monthly payments, \nthey use this money, along with that of thousands of others, as well a from \ncompanies, to pay for healthcare of those covered. They negotiate with \nproviders, to reduce their costs, they float the company and generate \ncapital from investment in, and also invest out, diversify, to generate \nmore. This way they make profits. That money you pay in, you don't get \nback. It funds other people who've been sick that year, and bought in. \nThus, you are paying for other peoples care. People who theoretically could \nafford their own. They also want to, by nature, cover as little as \npossible, to retain as much as possible in profits.\n\nThey nature of this system, leaves the most needy, most vulnerable. Those \nwho cannot pay in, are not covered. Those who cannot afford excessive \npayments, wind up under covered.\n\nSo not only are you paying for other people,. you're paying for other \npeople who need it less than other's not being covered. Come on, even the \n'Right' in the US has to be able to see that unless you feel that only \npeople of means, deserve life, even if to you it doesn't make sense to pay \nfor other people, it makes even less sense to pay for other people who \ndon't need it, so third parties can gain wealth, gambling on over all \npublic health, your health.\n\nIt still works.. but it leaves the most needy behind the eight ball. This \nis the fundamentally flawed assumption of the 'Right' in the US. All people \nwho don't have means, are lazy moochers who don't want to work or have \nmoney, and the security and freedoms it brings, they just want to sit \nabout... doing what? I don't know... and bludge.. collecting food stamps, \nwelfare cheques, and free healthcare. They have engineered their own \n\"neediness\".\n\nI cannot even begin to list all the studies both inside the US and without, \nwhich show that this section of society is the smallest. The reasons for \nlow income, or unemployment, are diverse.. but conscious choice is one of \nthe smallest sectors. To begin with, America's 'Starvation Wage' minimum \nwage is huge part, as is outsourcing labour, entrenched poverty, \ngenerational poverty, mental and physical health, lack of facilities and \nopportunities within communities, even poor business choices, or crime \n(such as people having their wealth wiped out by white collar crime)... are \nall by far the more prevalent reasons for people to need welfare, including \nsubsidized healthcare.\n\n\nHow can anyone feel such negativity towards doing something, paying for \nother's, they already do, when they should really be feeling revulsion at \npaying for other's don't need them to, and more, those who don't need it at \nall...  the high income bracket folks buy the same insurance you do, but \nthrough many many means, can in turn negotiate to pay less in, for more \nout... with you footing the difference.\n\nPeople in the Right in the US who oppose socialized medicine, also oppose \nAbortion, in most case.. they are pro life ( a compromised position the \nmoment you form a mob and do violence at abortion clinics, I would \nargue)... but then when the teenage girl from a broken home, a third \ngenerational poverty home, who's family failed her, who's community is \nunderserviced, and where opportunities are lacking, falls pregnant... and \nkeeps the child... is cited a s burden on society. Hang on a minute, you \nwon your argument, no one is born with morality.. it's conditioned... your \narguments of right to life, worked... but no...    she's a burden... she's \nnot .. not working because she is a single woman who lacked opportunities, \nhad a broken childhood, and lives in a place which is underserviced and has \nno money to get out, and now has chosen to keep and raise her baby as a \nsingle mother... she's a ;leech who had a baby for bucks.\n\nI could go on and on about examples. I wont.\n\nI will say that a single user pays State system, with a private option for \nanyone who wished, funded through a set levy, which can be discounted for \nthose on low income, and voided for those who cannot afford it, would be \nless than many of you are paying now for healthcare, and would effectively \neliminate the thirty million American's not covered, and the, by some \nreports, forty million under covered.\n\nWhat would it cost your hip kick? Nothing.. in Australia.. 500 bucks a \nyear... lets say it cost American's a thousand flat, still less than what \nit costs your per capita now. As stated in another video about outcome, \nSurvival Rates V Mortality Rates, by Dr Caroll, it wouldn't effect outcomes \nall that much either. In fact, in some areas.. the statistics are clear. Dr \nCaroll used Cancer for his explanation, but look at life expectancy, and \ninfant mortality rates...almost ALL the countries on this videos list, have \nHIGHER L.E. and LOWER infant mortality, and achieve it for HALF or closer \neven to a THIRD of the costs of the US.\n\n\"But America has 300 million people\"... the last argument. Japan has \n130,000,000 million... they spend less than any Western nation, according \nto a 2008 WHO study, and achieve the highest outcomes. The difference \nbetween Denmark's 5 million, and the US pop. of 300,000,000 is significant, \nbut the difference between 360,000,000 and 120,000,000 isn't any where near \nas much.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, there's NO real excuse, except 'I pay my way, \nyou pay yours'.. but in that case.. withdraw from Society. Please. Because \nlike or not, Society is a collective (evil commy word isn't it....  \npredating the word Communism as political word and ideology by centuries, \nbut meh)... you drive on state funded roads, you are defended by local, \nstate and federal police, you are protected by the Military of the State, \nyou have education, and healthcare, and even interest rates on loans... \nindirectly supported by the State. EVERY SINGLE \nConservative/Libiterian/Capitalist right, you people cite as Negative \nRight, inviolate, which is the only kind there is, is in fact a positive \nright, because you remove yourselves from this 'Collective' called \n\"Society\" then you remove yourself FROM all aspects of it... including \nhaving ANYONE in a uniform of with a gavel from having TO ACT to enforce \nyour 'Negative Rights'\n\nGreed and selfishness, mixed with fear, and brainwashing, is a horrible \nthing America. Consider things like Obamacare, a mild trial course of part \nof  a cure. You already had them water down your medicine enough it might \nnot work.. but I hope for the sake for millions of your fellow Americans, \nit does, if just a little.\ufeff",

So to address your \n\"convincing\" point: yup they are absolutely forcing people to get health \ncare, but it's for the same reason that car insurance is mandatory. Owning \nand operating a car means that you have a chance to cause damage to \nproperty other than your own. In the case of this event you need to be able \nto afford the repair costs. Same goes for owning a body. One day you get a \nbad injury/illness and can't pay for it, but it's not like we'll just let \nyou die, so you get emergency care. That translates into higher premiums \nfor everyone else. As an added bonus health insurance means preventative \ncare and less chance for costly injuries and illnesses. And while I agree \nwith you that there are better ways I would argue that literally anything \ndone right now, i'm talking anything, is better than the shitshow system we \nhad before. (also given new Affordable Care Act provisions, medicaid is \nexpanded and subsidies are given to people that can't afford insurance)",

My \npoint is that a penalty is not convincing, it is a mechanism to force \npeople to do something be it good or bad.  Your first point is that health \ninsurance is not an iPad. I agree, but my analogy isn't about importance to \nsociety its about the use of force vs convincing.  Your second point about \nforcing the cost of healthcare down.  I would argue there are much better \nways to improve the cost of health care without forcing people to pay for \nsomething they do not want or can't afford.  ",

Most doctors have given up private practice or \nbecome boutique services which don't accept most insurance.\n\nI have been dealing with a seriously ill family member for the past 5 years \nor so, and we spend as much time trying to figure out payments as we do \nfiguring out providers and healthcare. Similarly, the billing people at the \ndoctors' offices spend more time dealing with the billing than the doctor \never spends with a patient. Then, the insurers also spend huge amounts of \ntime.\n\nCompletely aside from the additional profit that the insurers extract along \nthe way, these gross inefficiencies add huge additional costs.\n\nThen, add to the fact that each individual often has multiple payers to \ndeal with. Am I paying this with my copay/coinsurance/deductible? Is this \ncovered by my medical insurer? By my behavioral health insurer? By my \ndental insurer? By worker's compensation? Just hope that you don't end up \nwith seized muscles around your temporary-mandibular joint and worn and \nbreaking teeth in your jaw due work-related stress and to poor ergonomics \nfrom your workplace-provided chair. You will quickly discover that this \nparticular malady falls squarely in the gray area between all of those \npayers and everyone wants to pass the buck. (No, this is not the condition \nmy family member has).\n\nDespite my supposedly excellent insurance plan and supposed limits on put \nof pocket expenses, I am just a few bills away from bankruptcy due to the \nmedical bills from my family member's treatment costs. See, if the insurer \ncovers 80% of their \"usual and customary rates\" (read \"the lowest rates \nthey have negotiated for in-network providers) for out of network coverage, \nthe 20% of UCR counts towards your out of pocket maximum, but the \ndifference between UCR and what you are charged does not.\n\nThen, try to actually find out in advance how much a procedure will cost. \nThe doctor can't tell you, and refers you to the billing department. \nBilling says they don't know until they see what procedure codes are \nsubmitted. The doctor doesn't know the procedure codes, and refers you to \nbilling. The insurance company won't tell you their UCR unless you give \nthem the procedure codes.\n\n*THIS* is the mess that ACA doesn't even touch, but that single-payer would \nsolve.",

It has been proven to \nwork pretty well, within the consideration that all systems have flaws. \nBut, for something like healthcare to be universal, you have to do it \nright. Obama's way of doing trial and error is to see how much he can get \naway with before he is put below a 30% approval rating. first he says that \nwe can keep our healthcare, if we like it, then he takes a lot of it away \nand claims we would keep the insurance if he liked it. he threw so many new \nregulations on insurance companies that many that could stay changed so \nmuch that they are barley worth having. Then because of huge uproar obama \nsaid that until an extended date we can keep our insurance. But damage was \ndone already and if places (like blue cross) remained to keep their \nhealthcare packages their rates went up at least 22%, leaving many people \nout in the cold anyway. Obamacare is law, no one can debate that. The fact \nObama is \"allowing\" insurance companies to operate the old way for a \nlimited amount of time, not only isn't written in the new law (thus making \nhis words again, very unofficial), but is also so temporary, it can't undo \nthe damage that was done this very short time obamacare has been active. \nPeople because of this, are loosing their jobs. work places big and small \ncan't afford to cover everyone the way the bill is asking and so either \nthey have to cut pay or lay off people. Pay can only be cut so much and \nstill be legal, so the latter is more useful to especially small \nbusinesses. \nThis isn't the way universal healthcare should work, my problem isn't with \nuniversal healthcare, it's with how horrendously it is being represented. \nHealthcare should be for all people, but we need to follow the examples of \nother countries have laid out for us and not make ridiculous tangents from \nit and give it the same name. I don't know how much we are suppose to \nsacrifice but this system is hurting almost everyone, from the families who \nhad no insurance to begin with, to the ones who have to pay a lot more and \nor settle for less.

People don't always \nknow if what they have is serious or needs medical attention until they get \na diagnosis.

You don't recommend narcotics to somebody with a \ndifficult period in his life. You don't do that. It's immoral.  Its just \nwrong. And if it's not Dopamin than it is Noradrenalin or Serotronin or a \ncombination of it- it doesn't matter. It works like the most common \nharmfull narcotics (Speed, Cocaine, Crack etc.). And taking drugs didn't \nhelp anybody on the long run. You just become dependent. It will grow an \naddiction. It fucks you up. Of course there are a view people in the world \nthat can tolerate narcotics better but the most people will feel much worse \non the long run and will be unable to get away from it. ",

To \nchange how your body behaves, you can change the messengers the body is \nusing.\n\nStill psychotherapy is the better way to thread such things. But people \nwith major depression are not able to get one, because depressions \nare incapacitating. That's the situation where you need medication to fight \ndepression, so the patient is able to participate in the therapy. Otherwise \nyou will end in a catch 22 situation, where you need to help someone with \ndepression, but because of his depressions you cant help him and that's the \nreason you need to help him.",
