We can't ever even know how our own \nuniverse was born, though we have a strong suspicion.\n\nCreating a universe requires a way to decrease entropy into zero at one \nvery small volume in space. Of course, if big bang theory is right, if it's \nnot, then I could say anything about flying elephants. Decreasing entropy \nlike that just will not happen. It may be possible, but not in the needed \nscale. The energy needed is just so immense. We may once be able to light \nagain a couple of stars. But the energy of a star is not even close enough \nto the energy needed for a universe. After all, the energy we put into it, \nis the energy there will always be. Meaning that if we make a universe out \nof the energy of a star, there will never be humankind in that universe.\n\nIf any physicist realistically believes in a theory of universes within \nblack holes, that physicist is not to be taken seriously. Even if that did \nhappen, there is no way to enter another universe. Well, not alive. Not to \nmention that theoretical physics is very strongly quite certain that a \nuniverse within a black hole is impossible. (And in fact, not all \nphysicists even believe in the existence of black holes anymore).\n\nLike I said, if there are other universes, there is no way to get any \ninformation of them, and there is no way to enter them. Because those \nuniverses would be universes of their own, and there can't be a connection \nbetween two different universes.\n\nImagine the universe has four dimensions. We only perceive three. There \ncould be another \"3D universe\" just two inches from us, but we have no way \nof perceiving it, because we can't perceive four-dimensional space. In \nsomewhat a similar way, there may be a separate universe two inches from \nus, but there is no way we can perceive it, because we are bound to our own \nphysicality, universe.\n\nAnd anyway, humankind is too likely to destroy itself before such things \nare relevant to think about. Looking bad already, and no one really wants \nto make a difference.\n\nI wouldn't like to say that it is impossible for humankind to exist \nforever, but I see no realistic reason to believe in such a thing. Yes, \nthere may be some spiritual existence, afterlife, but that's not a matter \nof physics. I don't believe that humankind will ever find a way to \nmanipulate the fate of the universe. Such energy can't realistically be \nhandled.\n\nIf we somehow manage to create another big bang, we're doomed. Like I said, \nthe time would flow towards the past. And you can easily imagine that it \nwill erase not just what has happened, but also all the memories of it. \nWhich means that when we start to force the time backwards, we reach the \nvery end of our existence. Because once we've got back in time, we would do \nit all again. We would see Galileo and Leonardo again, and we would us \nwriting these exactly same comments. And we would have some idealist \npressing the button which reverses time. And the whole process is going to \nbe repeated seemingly infinite times (of course in reality, it's just the \nsame time happening again). \n\nNever try to travel back in time.

It was a perfect phase of nothingness. From 0 to \n10^-43 seconds is known as the Planck Epoch. At the Plank energy (10^19 \neV), the gravitational force was as strong as the other quantum forces, \nresulting in a probable unification of all forces, a single force denoted \nas the \"super force\". This resulted in a perfect symmetry. At 10^-43 \nseconds after begun the creation of the embryonic universe. This occurred \ndue to a breakage in the super-force due to a random quantum fluctuation. \nGravity, broke from the super-force, causing a quake through out the whole \nuniverse. the other three forces were still unified, they are denoted as a \nsmaller symmetry known as GUT symmetry. This is called the GUT era. (Temp = \n10^32 C) After 10^-34 seconds the strong force broke from the GUT, \nresulting in the end of the inflationary period, and transitioned into a \ncommon friedmann expansion. The universe consisted of many particles, at \n10^27 degrees the gluons, quarks and leptons condensed into baryonic \nmatter, and such. This is important in giving you an image of the Universe. \nThe universe has defined borders not in terms of the observers within the \nuniverse, but the observers outside the universe. This universe is an \nembryo of unlimited space-time, space can be stretched infinitely, and you \ncan travel in it infinitely without ever reaching the end, because you are \nthe observer. \n\nIf it is flat, it only means that if you construct a triangle with three \nstraight line segments where all end points are in contact with another, \nthe angles inside the triangle equate to 180 degrees, the shape of the \nuniverse doesn't particularly mean much, when asking what is beyond. What \nis beyond is theorized to be a perfect phase of nothingness. Nothingness \njust waiting for a random quantum fluctuation.                             \n               ",

If the universe were contracting, then it could be possible for \ngravity to overtake dark energy, but the reverse is true.  What's more, it \ndoesn't matter if we have more black holes or what, all matter has gravity \nand that can not change over time.  The only thing that matters for the \nstrength of gravity is proximity between objects, and that's getting \nfurther.  So gravity is pulling back \"in\" less and dark energy is putting \n\"out\" more over time.  That paints a very clear picture.

What is actually happening is, due to the growth of the \nuniverse, and because universe is the space of itself, the universe isn't \nexpanding somewhere, it's expanding in itself.
