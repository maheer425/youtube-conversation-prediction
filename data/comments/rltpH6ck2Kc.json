I was just thinking that if for some \nreason we had the need to transport the entire planet somewhere else, we \ncould actually send it to another habitable zone. He mentioned that after \nthe sun disappeared the Earth would fly off on a tangent to it's last point \nof revolution, and said it would be like a \"shuttle.\" That's what made me \nthink of it. And even if we do become something different than what we are \nnow, chances are water would still be very important as it seems to be the \ndriving force sustaining all life that we know of. Why waste an entire \nplanet made of mostly water?",

The Elders, realising the potential for evil \nwith this knowledge, locked it away. The Elders ordered mass killings of \nthe Egyptian people in the name of war, but really it was to protect the \nsecret of this knowledge. A thousand years later the key to this \ninformation would fall into the Freemason's hands. I now share it with you. \nI have escaped the Freemasons grip and want to share the secrets I have \nlearned ",

'i did understand it, but i dont know why he said that cuz hes \ndutch\ufeff'. \nLike we said, jokes have nothing to do with our knowledge of Latin. So not \nonly are you ignorant, but you show you didn't even bother to read through \nthe comments, but just lazily felt compelled to spew forth you uneducated; \npoorly thought out opinion. If you took an IQ test to see your IQ, don't \nexpect it to be right. If the test said that you had an IQ of 193, that's \nreally not true and is an a really bad estimate. And because you can't even \nget a simple obvious joke, it proves the test even more wrong. You got to \nstop calling people 'morons', 'idiots' and 'dumb'. This fact of logic is \nslowly shrinking your IQ. Take a more precise test before you boast about \nyour IQ. Next \u2026 wow! How cute, you're not replying to me, probably because \nyou can't understand any simple logic of Latin. And yeah, as \nSallySnarkCommander said (and which you pretty much decided to ignore), \n\"Just because you have an IQ of 193 doesn't mean you're a genious. IQ means \nIntelligence Quotient, not \"You are this smart\". I have an IQ of 125, and I \nsuck at math.\", and you could not get a joke.\ufeff If you so have an IQ of 193, \nwhy don't you think before commenting, huh? BTW, as I said, if your going \naround boasting about your IQ, it most likely means your arrogant and you \nhave nothing else to do. Ha! What have you got to argue? Probably nothing. \nIf you also think you've got an IQ of 193, take at look at your grammar. \nYou might say my grammar is garbage (which in truth, it's not), but at \nleast I have better grammar than yours. Finally, this simple piece of \nlogic, would probably shrink your IQ to a more precise 125, and my IQ would \nprobably count as 150. Infact, you might very well have the broadest \n(lowest, in case you don't known what 'broadest' means) spectrum of \nintelligence out of this entire conversation, and I could possibly count as \nhaving the highest.\ufeff ",

                    "text": "+ParaditeRs Ok I shall explain this in a simpler manner for you. currently \nthe earths axis is slowing down, due to spinning inward towards the sun. If \nthe sun is no longer applying reverse rotation than the earths spin will \nremain the same. The earths core is heated due to the insane quantity of \ngravitational forces of the remaining earth, it is most likely a plasma of \niron. While the earth was young it began to spin due to various impacts and \nother forces, this started the direction the earth has to began to spin in. \na plasma by definition has shared electrons this the magnetic fiend that \ncurrently protects the earth from 98.7 percent of the suns radiation, \nhowever it serves a second purpose, once a core of a comic body has become \nplasma, no other forms of miterals will have a effect on it, such as \nliquid, gas, and solids unless something of greater magnitude acts on the \nbody such as two planets colliding. What this means is that the core of the \nplanet is not actually touching the inner mantle but is in a state of \nsuspension spinning at the center of the planet. The krugor effect refers \nto the core being gridded on by the inner mantle, however our earth is to \nlarge and has a plasma core, this effect is currently happening only on \nmars due to its small size and having a small core that is more in-pure \nthan our own. For the earth to be affected by this it would take longer \nthan a white dwarf to become a black dwarf, which hasn't happened yet and \nwon't happen for at least another 10billion years or so, which would bring \nyour total near  23.7billion years until earth losses rotation which is \nlonger than the expected lifespan of the universe.",

Eventually there \nwould be fish and eventually they would start to walk on land.  Then there \nwould be birds, but again this all would occur extremely slowly and over \nbillions of years.  The reason life won't end up the same as it is today is \nthat evolution is due to random genetic mutations and occasionally the \nmutation turns out to be a benefit to the species and thus makes it more \nlikely to be passed on.  Obviously since these mutations happen randomly, \nthere is no way life would be very similar but there still would be some \nsort of fish/land animals and birds. ",

If you wanted to convey that you meant another main \nsequence star of similar mass then you could have just plainly said that. \nYou seem to be confused about terminology. Voyageur is not a satellite. \nAlso, hundreds of thousands of supernovae occur daily. It hasn't been a \ncouple months since the last, one likely occurred in the last couple \nminutes.\n\nWe don't need to go there to determine whether the laws are the same. We \nknow the laws are the same in other galaxies due to the properties in the \nspectrum of light we collect from those galaxies.  Is there the possibility \nthat they could change in the future or be different beyond our observable \nbubble? Sure, but the hypothetical star our planet could have come from \nwouldn't have come from the future or that far away.\n\nYou don't need to be so defensive, I wasn't attacking your idea, I was \nattempting to quantify it in a general sense. Posing hypothesis is \npointless if you can't handle someone analysing it.\n\nI haven't the slightest clue what you're saying about black holes. You seem \nthoroughly confused about what a theory is. String theory is not a theory, \nit is a hypothesis. It is unfortunate that it leads to this much confusion, \nthey should have called it Model of strings. The Big Bang Theory isn't a \nguess. We know the universe is expanding from a smaller more dense form, \nit's Known. Not a guess.\n\nDo you think forensic investigators just guess who did a crime too? The \nevidence tells you who did it.\n\nFor you to say you believe in a higher power just goes to show your \nirrationality.

The only known satellite Voyager has only reached \noutside of our solar system and isn't even scratching, will scratch the \nsurface of future exploration yet..\n\nWho was to say Andromnia was our closest galaxy millions of years ago? when \nmany distant stars have gone supernova being examined over the years from \ndata received (Last one only happen back in January this year).. I hate \nwhen people cut other peoples theories down when you or the other thousands \nof brilliant minds up until today weren't even around when the big bang \noccurred or millions of years down the track after it occurred.. It's a \nplausible theoretic explanation not a confirmation of what happen when \nscientists explain the big bang theory. String Theory is something I \nbelieve in and leads us to believe that other universes could indeed have \nno physical complexities of physics and gravity.\n\nAnd who is say that a black hole couldn't have been thrown into the mix of \nhow earth suddenly appeared appeared millions of years ago or light years \naway from a far away distant universe in my theory.. I don't give a shit \nabout explanations of how a black hole would obliterate the earth and \nsurrounding planets or stars because no one has been near one to experience \nit.

By the way I'm agnostic, even though I don't believe in a religious \ntype of way I only believe there is a higher being in or outside our \nnatural universe....\n\nIf we never had imaginative minds from when we evolved we wouldn't be where \nwe are today..

Assuming Earth formed and was ejected from a star system there 10 \nbillion years ago means Earth would have to been travelling at 761km/s \n(average only, because it would have slowed down as it escaped Andromeda \ndue to it's gravitational field and sped up later on due to the Milky Ways \nfield) and that's if it got here today.\n\nSo if the star disappeared and we assume the planet was orbiting at about \nthat velocity, the orbiting star must have been much more massive than our \nstar now and we likely orbited much farther out than we do now. \n\nIf for example we were to orbit our star at that velocity, ignoring the \nfact that we would actually just fling off into space, one year would be \nabout 14 days.\n\nNot an impossible event, but very implausible. Especially considering at \nthat speed, the earth would not be able to settle into an orbit around the \nsun at this distance.\n\n(3) I'm not even going to comment on that other scenario. lol",

It would take ~8 \nminutes for the earth to go dark, but we would know immediately that \nsomething was wrong because Earth would immediately fly out of orbit - like \na slingshot. Gravity operates outside of space/time and is therefore \ninstantaneous.\n\nHopefully, we'll rocket past the moon, rather than into it. GPS would \nimmediately stop working, and at least 12 of those satellites would come \ncrashing to Earth. In fact, every space satellite in our new trajectory \nwould immediately come crashing down to Earth, the satellites on the far \nside of earth would be left behind, trailing in Earth's gravity.\n\nEarthquakes would start moments later, due to the sudden gravitational \nshift. Some of our atmosphere will be lost, but much will remain. No \nworries, as most that atmosphere protected us from a sun that is no longer \nshining, or at least will stop shining within 7 minutes, 30 seconds...\n\nSoon after we've gone dark, massive tidal waves will hit, because the \noceans tides are no longer managed by the gravitational pull of the Moon. \nThere will also likely be massive tsunami's as a result of the earthquakes.\n\nTwitter would go nuts, and of course the New York Times would print \"End of \nthe World: Women and Minorities Hardest Hit\"\ufeff",

Firstly, everything you say is \nstrewn with a plethora of errors (eg human SPECIES, not RACE).\nSecondly, and most importantly, you have no higher education in Physics, \nPlanetary studies, Space, Rocket science etc. You know comparatively little \nabout space travel, the cultural and economical issues associated and why \nwe've been gathering data from other planets.\n\nAt no point did I say that we won't colonize space-we of course intend on \ndoing so in the long term. You, however, seem to think that we need to do \nit asap, and also ramble on at a tangent about setting an example to alien \nlife or something like that (you really lost all credibility at that \npoint). We will colonize space at our own rate, and as and when it becomes \nnecessary. It will not be worth it in terms of resources, but we may have \nexhausted those on Earth and it may be necessary.

We dont \nneed to survive - we need to thrive. We know nothing about the full majesty \nof space - maybe space has more intelligent life forms than one can even \nimagine. I dont want my future descendants to show this other beings how \naggressive we are - for this may cause them to treat us as a threat. I \nbelieve that inorder for the rest of humanity to coexist with other beings \n- mutual understanding must be attained between the lives of space. \n\nAnd you might think that this is quite out of topic, this is the extension \nof my proposed idea of exploring space. For years, we are sending out our \ninformation to space. Maybe aliens are tuning their radars into Earth and \nare listening to Hitler's speeches or to the radio transmissions during the \nCuban Crisis.Anyway, whatever those dudes out there in space are receiving, \nthey know we are here - and what if they use a form of communication that \nwe cant even imagine - and that might be the reason why no one receives \nradio about them. For an sentient life form to be recognized as an advanced \nlife form, one must learn about space faring. This might be a very \nexpensive step for all of humanity to take - but this only step we have to \nensure survival of the race. I hope you understand what I mean.",

There might be, at some point \ndown the road, where we can convert this generated energy to plant-friendly \nand thus artificially propagate photosynthesis on a grand scale.",

If it's \njust spacetime being altered by a massive object like the sun, then in \ntheory couldn't the gravity continue to exist for quite some time after the \nsun's disappearance, like how a matress still has an imprint of where you \nslept on it after you get out of bed?\ufeff",

                "text": "When it comes to no sun you would not be able to survive, kind of, well let \nme explain.... - Vitamin D is only obtained from sunlight, and is vital. \nWithout the sun, we would all be Vitamin D deficient, and therefore \ndeficient in other things too - like Potassium and Calcium (which will also \nbecome deficient since Vitamin D helps absorb it). Because of this, we \nwould pose many health problems - not to mention issues with our skin. We \nwould also suffer from depression (or other depressive disorders) because \nsunlight is vital for creating the neurotransmitter, serotonin, which \nevaluates our mood. Without it, we would all spiral down, a large majority \nof us even committing suicide. Basically in short, if the sun suddenly went \nout - we humans would not survive. We have evolved, and therefore adapted \nfor the environment we currently live in.\n\nIf, however, the loss of sunlight was slow and gradual overtime, then the \nrising of a possibly mutation would change our eye and skin anatomy - given \nwe were able to adapt. We could possibly adapt an amazing ability to take \nin minimum Vitamin D, or perhaps not need it at all! Imagine what on earth \nour skins would look like!\n\nWhy do you have skin colors? Its because of melatonin in reponse to \nsunlight. As the sun gradually disappeared, we would have no need for the \nskin colors we have today. We would possibly all look ghostly white, and \nhave to develop thicker skin to adapt to the coldness we'd have without \nsunlight. Here evolution could experiment with skin.\n\nA very important one concerning eyes - eyes evolved to detect light. \nWithout it, suppose we had no other light source on earth? Remember, the \nmoon does not give off light - it reflects the suns light. We could end up \ndeveloping smaller eyes (as they would have no use to us any more), or \nloose them all together! We would definatly lose color vision as primates - \nthis has been a very important evolutionary feature in primates who need to \nmake judgements on picking food (imagine not being able to tell which fruit \nwas ripe or which was poisionous)!\n\nThere are many implications to this question, and I have only touched on \nSOME of them. We could perhaps look like pale, thick skinned, hairy, \neyeless creatures without sunlight. Have fun imagining the rest!\ufeff",

In the presence of CHLOROPHYLL a little \ndance takes place. It's complicated, hang in there. In the leaf there's a \nmolecule called adenosine diphosphate. There's other molecules with \nphosphorous. The photon strikes the outer electron layer of the other \nphosphorous and raises that layer to a higher energy state. The chlorophyll \nfacilitates the coupling of that higher phosphorous with the adenosine \ndiphosphate, creating ATP! Adenosine TRIphosphate. We eat the plants or we \neat the animals that ate the plants. We digest the ATP. It releases that \nextra photon locked in the higher energy state of the outer electron layer. \nThat photon moves a muscle cell causing it to contract. And ten thousand \nother things. This allows LIFE. Chlorophyll brings starlight into our \nbodies and cells allowing them to be ALIVE. Get a biology book and really \nread what goes on. I learned this in high school science. You should have \ntoo.",

If the sun disappeared, then in the next 500 \nyears without the sun, they better fucking solve the ability of time \ntravel, make a giant time portal, and drive everyone in the world to the \ndinosaur age, eliminate the dinosaurs, then do what we've always done for \nyears and etc etc... Er, well, maybe AFTER the dinosaurs died, seeing as to \nhow there was that meteor thingy that ended the dinosaur age.\nAnd then once the sun disappears again, we all just build the same time \nmachine, then repeat the process.\nNow, however, I know what most people on the internet think: But, what if \nwe run into ourselves and cause a paradox?\nWell... Technically, there is another theory about time that is mostly \ncorrect, this theory talks about how there are MULTIPLE timelines, each \ncarrying what we've done in the past, or (possibly) what we done in the \nfuture. If we travel to a timeline of the past, then, nothing much will \nhappen, in fact, the future of that past timeline, might even change if we \nwere to interrupt it, however, it wouldn't disturb the other timelines \nseeing as to how they're in their own separate place in the \"time stream\" \n(aka, home of time lines or whatever ya want to call it).",

When the \nsun expands to a red giant we will have developed planetary shields to \nprotect us from it and using our technology we will use tidal acceleration \nto push ourselves away from the expanding sun. That will result in the same \neffect as if the sun actually did disappear. You see, I am from billions of \nyears in the future. The earth will end up drifting through the galaxy and \neventually we will establish orbit around a blue giant but in the Goldilox \nzone where we are far enough away that we get the same heat and light from \nit as if it were the sun. By then we will have time machines and so after \nfinding this video which was put in a time capsule and preserved, I went \nback in time to personally thank you for it.\ufeff",

You see, \nwhen the moon gets between the sun and the earth, the sun 'tugs' it a bit, \nand this is likely what is pulling it away, otherwise, earth would \neventually pull it in. So, if the sun disappeared, after a few billion \nyears the moon might hit us... lol or it might stay there forever... But it \nwon't go away, the sun plays no part in it orbiting the earth. After like, \ntwenty to fifty billion years the earth would slow down so much the moon \nwould smash into it sooner or later, because the sun does keep the earth \nspinning, but things in space stay spinning for a loooong time once they \nget spinning!

One could argue that we could use UV bulbs to grow \nplants for subsistence farming, but we would still lose a lot of nutrients \nbecause certain plants would be too costly to grow and would take too long \nto produce. Our diets would mainly consist of grains such as rice and \nstarches, with little to no meat aside from cannibalism.\n\nThe psychological factors of such an event could also be catastrophic, \nespecially due to the possibility of losing large quantities of life on \nEarth within 5 to 10 years. Loneliness would be common-placed and \ndependencies on others would increase tremendously in order to maintain \nsanity. (Wilson would serve as a fine substitute for human interaction, but \na volleyball would still fail to meet our basic social requirements)\n\nWith these sudden changes, the average lifespan would drastically shift \nfrom the current ~71 years to much lower values due to the fact that \nnewborns and young children will not be capable of surviving long after \nbirth without certain required nutrients from a varied diet. An infant \ncould survive on breast milk for years, but the supplier would have to take \nin extra nutrients and food in order to build a sufficient supply for \nanother being.\n\nMaking our own sun wouldn't be a possibility given the modern limitations \nin technology and science, even though we can replicate the nuclear fusion \nthat goes on in our own sun, we will not be capable of gathering anywhere \nnear the amount of energy to make an exact duplicate sun.",

Now shake the \nbag, until you obtain a fully assembled laptop from the bag.\n\nSome evolutionists have argued to me: \"yeah, but appearance of life and/or \nevolution has happened over billions of years!!\"\n\nAssuming the earth is 4.something billion years old, do you think you'll \nobtain a fully assembled laptop even if you keep shaking the bag for 4.xx \nbillion years?\n\nOk, for those who argue that \"abiogenesis\" is a completely separate concept \nfrom \"evolution\", the same - well, similar - argument still applies. Any \nform of mutation can be compared to a bomb exploding, and causing \ncompletely random changes at the DNA level. Mutations are *never* helpful \nto the organism suffering them. If you rounded up all the material to build \na house on a construction ground and then blow it up with dynamite, do you \nthink you'll get a perfectly built house, with all its wiring in place, \nfurniture landing exactly in the right places, and so on? Or that you ever \nwill, even if you repeat this trillions and trillions of times? Personally \ni've never heard of a bomb explosion \"improving\" the structure of a \nbuilding. *Another interesting topic* is the mutation experiments they did \nwith x-rays on several millions of fruit flies (drosophila flies) for \ndozens of years, ending in the mid 80's -- the x-rays multiplied the factor \nof mutation by over 100. Once removed from the x-rays, after a few \ngenerations, even heavily mutated fruit flies became, guess what: back to \nnormal fruit flies.\n\nAs for Darwin's slow, progressive changes between species - ie. so called \n\"natural selection\": 1. as i noted above, we have scientific proof that \ndidn't happen, and zero proof that it actually did, and 2. If it did, then \nwhy are there still monkeys? How come they didn't all evolve into humans or \nhuman-like lifeforms? Why are they all at the same \"evolutionary stage\" so \nto speak?\n\nAnd most importantly, why is there so much debate and disagreement even \nbetween evolution experts? Why don't even they agree about whose \n\"scientific method\" is the right one?",

We haven't \nfound a single one. This is why these \"transition\" drawings are just that, \ndrawings purely out of the human imagination, and not pictures of actual \nfossils - because obviously we have no such fossil records. For examle, if \nthe giraffe was really a \"descendant\" of the antilope, why don't we have \nfossils of antilopes with progressively longer necks? We only have \nillustrations drawn by evolutionists trying to hammer the idea into the \npublic's mind - and sadly, widely succeeding at that.\n\nIn the introduction to his book \"the origin of species\", Darwin himself \nadmitted that the absence of such fossils would contradict his entire \ntheory. He predicted that within 100 years of writing this book, we would \nhave found every fossil proving his theory. Like i said, we have found \nnone. He also claimed that proof of sudden appearances of groups of similar \nspecies would also destroy his theory. This is what archaeologists also \nfound actually happened.\n\nOne thing about carbon dating: the amount of carbon 14 in the earth's \natmosphere has only been \"relatively\" constant in the past 6000 to 10000 \nyears, before that it varied wildly. This has led to gross errors in carbon \ndating of some specimens.",

We're talking about abiogenesis. A hypothesis (rather, a \nconcept) which has much more speculation involved than evolution, which is \nabsolutely a demonstrable fact.\n\nAll I've heard you say in your entire collection of statements can be \nsummed up by saying \"evolution is far too complex and seemingly unlikely \nfor my mind to comprehend, therefore, the God hypothesis is far more likely \nand also much more pleasant.\" As Neil deGrasse Tyson has said before, the \nGod of the Gaps is no God at all. The more science advances and covers \nareas we knew nothing about, the more the God of the Gaps disappears.\n\nIf you wish to argue with science, you need to play by its rules and \nactually provide us with some peer-reviewed studies (or at the very least, \nexamples) to back up your claims.",

I don't think you realize how \nextremely complex even the simplest living cell is. Compared to it, even \nthe most powerful man-made supercomputer is nothing but sticks and stones. \nAnd, even IF by some miracle a living cell popped into existence, this does \nnot solve the problem of its environment, a single living cell would never \nhave been able to survive for very long in this \"big mush pool of pre-life \nearth\". And that's just the very first problem with the evolution theory. \nEven many evolutionists acknowledge these facts.\n\nAs for other life-sustaining planets in the universe, the balance of all \nthe different parameters that make life possible on earth is just too \nextremely perfect. Just for example, the moon's axis around the earth is a \ntremendously precise feat. It was clearly NOT caused simply by large bodies \ncrashing together in space - that's just ridiculous when you look deeper \ninto it. Another example is the earth's atmosphere, which is carefully \ndesigned to shield us from dangerous rays from the sun, while at the same \ntime absorbing vital ones. Plus, even if there was life on other planets, \nit would just be so unimaginably far away that it just wouldn't even \nconcern us, period. Real life isn't a sci-fi movie.\n\nAnd yes, evolutionism has become nothing more than another false religion. \nIt takes a LOT more so-called \"faith\" to belive it, than to believe the \nuniverse was created by a supremely intelligent and creative Architect.",

Thus you have the natural will of life to, \nwell, stay alive. So because the conditions required for a planet to \nsustain life and for that life to occur are so astronomically small, do you \nthink we are special? That there is someone kind of divine intervention? In \ncase you weren't aware, there are trillions and trillions of planets in the \nuniverse which means that the odds of there being NO life are drastically \nsmaller than there being life. Of course there are still some unanswered \nquestions about evolution, but I would just like to clean up some your \nignorance. Also you should probably be careful with certain words such as \ncalling evolution a religion. Scientists are merely trying to answer \nquestions with consistent logic, and if any evidence suggested that life \nwere impossible without divine intervention, then evolutionists would no \nlonger hold faith in evolution, much unlike how a religion acts.",

They scout the planet for signs of \nlife and they find it.....everywhere! But only in fossil form. Dead \nbacteria and strange aquatic life all dead and preserved in the ice. They \nscout the very few landmasses and find what looks like buildings! They must \nhave been created by some sort of intelligent life form! But they are dated \nto be billions of years old (they are very well preserved). They find \nstrange skeletons, they appear to be designed to walk upright. They have an \nincredibly large brain to body ratio so the aliens confirm they must have \nbeen the intelligent life here. They send the skeletons up to the mother \nship for initial testing along with all the other samples, sadly wondering \nif they were too late. If their first and most incredible discovery of \nalien life would never come to the discovery of actual, living life. In awe \nand wondering if there was any actual, still living creatures on this \nplanet they scout the entire planet's surface. They find something \nremarkable! The planet has an unstable crust, this means fault lines... \nWhich means there could possibly be pockets of unfrozen, even warm, H2O due \nto underwater volcanic activity! Excited, they scan the oceans and find \nexactly that! They decend down to the planet yet again and begin the plasma \ndrill through 16 kilometres of ice. Two days later they reach a safe haven \nif warm water. They decend into the alien liquid and scout it for \nlife...and they eventually find it! Hardy sea plants capable of surviving \nthe pressures and lack of life down here. The aliens return to their home \nplanet and report their incredible find to the public. The media is \noverloaded by the greatest discovery in their existence and the population \nis swept. Their are conspiracy theorys of it all being made up but \neventually some of the fossils are sold to museums for the public's \nviewing. A crowd of pre-mature school aliens huddle around a glass case \ncontaining one of the skeletons of the extinct, intelligent aliens. They \nread the plaque:\n\"_~\\|\\*~\\~~\\_~\\*\\*~~*\\~_\\*~_~~~_~\\_~~_~~_~~*\\|::/\"\n\"The first instance of an upright, opposable thumbed creature with a large \nbrain to body ratio. These creatures are thought to have built the billions \nof structures found on 'Frozen Orb 001-9'. They could have very well been \nactual, intelligent, alien life.\"\nThe aliens continue to live their lives and shape the fate if their own \nplanet. The discovery launches a great change in the public's opinion of \nspace exploration. Governments around the world fund trillions of dollars \ninto further exploration, scouting the universe for any other possible \nremnants of this strange, extinct, intelligent life. The only thing they \never find is a stiff, frozen flag and a few strange footprints on the \nplanet's lone moon.\n\ufeff",

A star can only die if it expands and turns to a supernova. Thus, if \nmar's star died, the star expanded and engulfed Mars. The star couldn't \nhave disappeared and send Mars flinging off into space. Mars probably came \nfrom an asteroid or something. If anyone disagrees please reply.

Stars don't just vanish.\n\nSeriously though, it is possible for a planet to break away from a solar \nsystem. It is usually in the early stages of a solar system and the planet \nis most likely not evolved much yet. Some of the fasted celestial objects \nare rogue planets slung from a snagged stars of a binary star system when \nit's star gets grabbed up by a black hole. Unfortunately these are very \nhard to detect and we most likely will never see them in our lifetime. But \nscience can prove they must exist. Any rogue planet has very little chance \nof sneaking into a solar system and finding a nice orbit but they have a \nworse chance of fitting it. We can tell how old things are. We know that \nEarth is about as old as our solar system. Shucks. We are most likely not \nadopted. \nA cool thing to note is all the heavier elements that make up our solar \nsystem was spat our of a dying star. So technically parts of the Earth did \ntravel the solar system to find their (current) resting spot. ",

Air system: If the plants die for whatever reason or they run out of \nseeds then they need to pull air from an external source vents outside will \nnot work because the entire planet is frozen on the surface.\n\n\n2. Since they cant mass produce everything in the bunker they might run \ninto problems in the later years since if the sun really did disappear the \neffects would last a very long time meaning they cant build factory's on \nthe surface the build what they need.\n\n3. Water where would they get it from? I guess according to this video they \ncould take trips to the surface collect huge amounts of it then bring it \nback to the bunker\nhowever they will need the water for the crops and plants huge amounts if \nthey need to get air for the bunker and all the people to drink too.\n\n\n\n  \ufeff",
