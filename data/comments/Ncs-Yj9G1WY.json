Atheism \nis the default position, and we should not replace current scientific \nignorance with \"God did it\".  Proper scientific research and discovery \nshould be taken, before jumping to conclusions, like saying a deity did it. \n Atheists say \"If you have evidence for a god, sho me, and I'll change my \nviews.\n\nYou also state that the Big Bang Theory isn't a law, do you even know what \na scientific theory is?  A theory is the highest honor a scientific idea \ncan achieve. Have you ever heard of the Cell Theory? Atomic Theory? Theory \nof Gravity? Theory of Germ Disease?  Yeah, they're all theories. But we \naccept them as fact.  Scientific laws are part of theories.. if only you \nhad received a proper education.\n\nReligious people: Believe that a god that came from nothing created the \nwhole universe and didn't even leave any evidence behind to show us that he \nis real.\n\nGod was used to answer questions like: Where does wind come from?  Back \nthen someone would have said: \"Well of course, by the grace of God.\"  But \nnow we know it's just air moving from high pressure zones to low pressure \nzones.  People also asked: \"How do the tides go in and out, checkmate \ngatheists.\" Well, it's because of the gravitational forces from our own \nmoon, you see where we're getting at?  We don't need a god to answer \nquestions any more.  As time goes on, the need for one gets marginally \nsmaller and smaller. Now religious people jump at god of the gaps saying \n\"Haha, you can't explain this, god must have done it!\"  Well no, it's just \nthat we don't know yet.  And we can find out through science, it hasn't let \nus down yet.\n\n You're making positive claims that a god exists, saying he is the cause of \nthe universe. Well, present your evidence! It is not the job for the \nAtheist to disprove god, it's on the one making the claim, which is people \nlike you.  It's like me stating there is an invisible unicorn in my \nbackyard, prove he doesn't exist!  Once you do provide this proof, you'd \nhave received the Nobel Prize for your efforts.",

When I saw it, I could only think (jokingly) \nthat if that man were to have sex with anyone, he'd probably kill the woman \nwith the size.\n\nA toy museum actually sounds interesting too if it were to be about the \nhistory of toys or what children play with around the world, including \nthose below the poverty line.\n\nA uterus mueseum could work too if it were done similarly to the penis \nmuseum. You could perhaps learn about how babies of different species are \nproduced in the womb, or their development beyond the womb like many \nmarsupials or the stages it goes through in an egg. Perhaps even with the \naddition of how male animals give birth. I would find that quite \nfascinating to learn more about.",

It's affects the pineal gland \nin your brain, which is responcible for dreaming and 6th sense ability. New \nAge people are against Mercury & Vaccines for this reason. Also the \nconspiracy theory is not far fetch. The government has done worst things to \npeople without telling them. Isn't it funny how a new flu always comes up, \nkilling some people, and then the news and media blow up telling everybody \nto get a flu shot? I've never had a flu shot and i'm fine.

They in a very \ndefensive state of mind, that is hard to change and cannot be \"forced out.\" \nThat's why I groan as OnFew's approach of calling anybody \"stupid\" in which \nhe disagree's of their points, that's is NEVER a way to change somebody's \nmind. Now, let's get to the faults in YOUR argument why \"YOU are stupid if \nyou get a vaccine.\"\n1. Viruses- Uh, that's the entire point. Vaccine are a preparation of \neither a dead or weakened  form of a virus which you inject to your body, \nand your body uses to make antibodies from, so when the real virus comes \nalong, your body will be ready to fight it. Really, your body can make \nantibodies with the real virus, but uh, you're much more likely to die \nand/or kill others before that happens.\n2. Animal DNA- So? If the DNA doesn't cause harm to the body and to the \nanimal that it came from, then why should it matter? Besides, we use animal \nDNA in medicine such as insulin (using human DNA) to give to humans, and it \nprevents against severe immune and/or allergic reaction, because in the \npast we had to extract the insulin from animals.\n3. The vast majority of poisons will not cause harm to the body if the dose \nis small enough, and mercury found in a can of tuna fish has a higher dose \nof a more lethal type of mercury than in a vaccine, so if you are concerned \nabout mercury poisoning from vaccines, then DON'T EAT TUNA!

The ideas of humans \"evolving to \neat meat\" is misleading, we evolved the ability, not the need, to eat meat \nand gain benefits.\n2. \"Evolving for\" something is an irrelevant argument, because even though \nwe have the ability to something, doesn't mean we should if it harms \nothers, and we can live without it.\n3. You generalize vegans by few arguments that some make, which lead to the \nconclusion that they're \"stupid.\"\nExtra: Don't even talk about \"pets\" if you eat animals yourself. Now, I am \nagainst feeding strict carnivores (such as cats) vegan diets, however I \nthink their is a lot of hypocrisy around here when a meat eater sympathizes \n  with the animal when \"a pet dies,\" because truly, the only difference \nbetween the animals you eat, and the ones you keep as pets, is the way you \nand your culture sees them as: either food or friend.",

Activities include manual labor, interrogation by former \nKGB members, learning the USSR national anthem, wearing gas masks, and \neating a Soviet dinner listening to Russian folk music.\n\nPeople who survive (Make it through) the entire experience get a \ncertificate of surviving a Soviet experience and a prize (which I believe \nis a t-shirt).\ufeff",
