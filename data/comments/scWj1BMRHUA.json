It may not have been \nwidely used in Nashville when you where born, but it was around for quite a \nwhile.\n\nColor TV also predates you by a couple years. The fact that it wasn't \ncommon till much later is a cost and opportunity issue.\n\n20 years ago from today would be 1995, by that time, MTSU and TTU had been \non the internet for 2 years. I think Vandy was on even earlier. Hard to \ndispute the comment that you had to pay for email accounts. Telalink(an \nearly Nashville ISP) gave you one account free with your dialup access in \n'96, at least according to the info on the wayback archive. So even in \nNashville, it was unlikely you had to pay for the first email account. By \nthe end of 1995, you had Yahoo and ebay on the internet. Also in '95, it is \nclaimed that more email was sent/received than US postal mail.  \n\n30 years ago puts us in 1985. That was a year that Cisco was building a \nrouter with IP only capabilities. IP being Internet Protocol.  TCP/IP has \nit's origins around 1973. DNS has it's origins around 1983. \n\nThe video had it's own issues. The internet taking it's terms from the sea \nis just false after the fact justification. The term pirate being used \noutside of naval usage is common. In the 1940's it was used for radio \nstations even on the land. It had been used for software piracy long before \nwe had common usage of the internet. \n\nThe first person to use \"Surfing the internet\" was borrowing the term from \nchannel surfing. And even then, it was being used for Gopher, the tool that \nwas from before Tim Berners-Lee and HTML and therefore the \"web\". ",

But to someone who CAN read Chinese, they would know what \nthat picture of strait and squiggly lines meant, and only because the \nperson who first created it taught others what it meant.\nLikewise, you DO know how to read English, but to a Chinese man, this \nentire comment is nothing more than a string of strait and squiggly lines. \nBut you know what these strait and squiggly lines mean, because you were \ntaught what each one means and what specific groups of them mean.\nSo, when I say the word \"cat\", you know what c, a, and t means. You also \nknow what those three letters combined in that order means. So when you \nread \"cat\", you imagine a cat in your head. Where it gets tricky is what \nthat cat looks like to you. It might be black, or orange. You may even come \nup with a simple personality for the cat. But if you were to write down \nevery single detail of the cat you're imagining, then someone else could \nread what you wrote and see in their head exactly what you saw.\nExcept the Chinese man.

However this does compare to images like a peace sign.\n\n        Going back to the roots using peace sign as an example, as word \nform the general thought is 2 options of imagery being a literal symbol \nwith a circle sectioned off or one made with the hand, but simply because \nit is a word that is all it can bring.\nWith the images of either generalized options are expanded with the context \nof the rest of the image. The symbol of peace being shown in many way to \nrepresent the same as a word as well as a number of things whether it's a \ncomplete decade or monumental event like war. The hand sign can be seen in \nmany ways as well including the hippie era, a treaty between countries, an \ninsult to some (not even kidding), and simply a means of saying you are not \nhostile.\n\nOh and if you plan a response please make it finalized to your best extent \nas to be honest I'd rather not spend forever on just this topic haha.",

For some people \"their\", \"they're\" and \"there\" might sound the \nsame, others can tell you what was said even without context.\nI am not a musician myself, we only practised \"listening notes\" back in \nschool. I think some people have it easier than others, but that it is a \nskill that can be learned. One might never be as good as it as someone with \ntalent in that field, same as with painting for example, but in my opinion \nthe basics can be learned.\nMusic notation is said to be \"written symbols\" and we must first \"write \nmusic\" for it to be read or played. But what is the difference between \nsymbols and letters? Some might say that not all letters are symbols and \nnot all symbols are letters. If we don't take the latin letter system but \nlook for example at arabic letters, Hiragana or Kanji, they do seem a lot \nlike symbols to the average person (who probably cannot read them).\nI never thought it possible, but right now I'm genuinely interested in this \ntopic :p",

The context \nin which the word was used effectively communicates a feature of the \nsubject in question and communication is the purpose of words. While the \nmeaning of the word in the context in which it was used is certainly \nderived from a word of the same name that means homosexual, the fact is \nthat it no longer retains that exact meaning.\n\nPeople who say 'gay' aren't stupid people. Stupid people are those who \ngenuinely have something against people with different sexual preferences \nand believe that they are in the right.

Websites tend to have way more \npages than just the ones you can access; including php files, databases, \njavascript files, info/config files... all technically accessible through \nthe internet but locked to everyone but the website admin(s). There are \nalso millions of articles submitted to online academic journals, access to \nwhich has to be paid for. Not to mention other paid-content sites. There \nare other protocols other than http(s)/fps: I2P, P2P, Gopher, TOR, \nFreenet... all very much legal as a platform for swapping data and with \ntheir own pros and cons [apart from Gopher, which is mainly cons as it's \ndifficult to search, pretty much text-only, and is only really used by \nhobbyists/enthusiasts [a.k.a: Buzz Killingtons : ) ]. The Internet isn't a \ndark, dangerous place; it's just people doing people stuff. I dislike all \nthe fear behind it; it's a tool which can be used for so much, \n[subjectively] good and [subjectively] bad- like a hammer... or a sandwich! \n: )",

                    "text": "As many have said, there is the deep web and there is the dark net. Most of \nthe deep web is completely legal to access. Then we also have the dark net. \nThe dark net is a term used to categorize those more seedy areas of the \ninternet; for example, sites that you can view illegal pornography on, hire \nhitmen, etc. The communications and transactions usually on this are \nusually F2F(Friend to Friend) which means that they are often direct links \nbetween two computers over network infrastructure. However, these sites \nmake up the minority of the deep web. As to the specific legality of \nvisiting such sites, such as the Silk Road ([illegal] drug wholesaler), \nmerely looking at these sites will not get you into legal trouble(maybe on \na watch-list if you are not heavily obfuscated), but the moment that you \norder something or view something such as cp you WILL most likely be \ntracked down and charged with a crime. \n\nOn to the lighter stuff. Many of the sites on the deep web operate on the \nold BBS system used during a good portion of the 90's. This is basically a \nsystem whereby there isn't really a search engine, but you look at a large \nlist of sites and take a hyperlink to them from which you can travel onward.\n\nTo address +SuperSaiyanMaze 's question the way that you can access the \ndeep web is not extremely difficult. A popular browser that is often \nutilized is The Onion Ring [TOR] browser; you can simply google this \nbrowser and you will find the TOR foundation's website where you can \ndownload it as a zip file. Once you open the browser, which is a modified \nversion of Firefox, you can use a search engine such as DuckDuckGo or even \nGoogle and search something along the lines of \"list of .onion website \nindexes.\"\n\nAs mentioned above many deep web websites have particular entrance \nrequirements. Some of them require you to do a Captcha, others require \npasswords, memberships, use of specific protocols or scripts, contextual \ncues, et cetera.\n\nMy final word to all of you is one of caution. Things like the TOR browser \ndon't completely mask your activity. If you do something illegal and aren't \nobfuscated enough law enforcement will eventually catch you. Bottom line, \ndo not do something stupid.\n\nBy the way, thanks for the watchlist add NSA.",

Of course because all the \nother sites of the Deep Web are useless, most people see the dangerous side \nof it.\nThe Deep Web has been used by rapists, terrorists teaching their children \nhow to make bombs, and dealing crack. It has also been used for safer \npurposes such as government communication and by rebel groups in communist \ncountries to plan revolutions and independence.\nIt can be accessed using TOR, but to be safe, I wouldn't go.",

A made up story about made up people that \naccomplishes nothing.\n\nOur entertainment says more about our species then anything else we will \never make. Sure, we learn how our ancestors fought, or what technology they \npossessed through other means. And those things are important. But who we \nare? How we think? What makes us laugh, what makes us cry? What are our \nopinions, and what do we value? Those things are read most easily by how we \nchoose to indulge. \n\nGive me a sword.

Then we also have the dark net. \nThe dark net is a term used to categorize those more seedy areas of the \ninternet; for example, sites that you can view illegal pornography on, hire \nhitmen, etc. The communications and transactions usually on this are \nusually F2F(Friend to Friend) which means that they are often direct links \nbetween two computers over network infrastructure. However, these sites \nmake up the minority of the deep web. As to the specific legality of \nvisiting such sites, such as the Silk Road ([illegal] drug wholesaler), \nmerely looking at these sites will not get you into legal trouble(maybe on \na watch-list if you are not heavily obfuscated), but the moment that you \norder something or view something such as cp you WILL most likely be \ntracked down and charged with a crime. \n\nOn to the lighter stuff. Many of the sites on the deep web operate on the \nold BBS system used during a good portion of the 90's. This is basically a \nsystem whereby there isn't really a search engine, but you look at a large \nlist of sites and take a hyperlink to them from which you can travel onward.\n\nTo address +SuperSaiyanMaze 's question the way that you can access the \ndeep web is not extremely difficult. A popular browser that is often \nutilized is The Onion Ring [TOR] browser; you can simply google this \nbrowser and you will find the TOR foundation's website where you can \ndownload it as a zip file. Once you open the browser, which is a modified \nversion of Firefox, you can use a search engine such as DuckDuckGo or even \nGoogle and search something along the lines of \"list of .onion website \nindexes.\"\n\nAs mentioned above many deep web websites have particular entrance \nrequirements. Some of them require you to do a Captcha, others require \npasswords, memberships, use of specific protocols or scripts, contextual \ncues, et cetera.\n\nMy final word to all of you is one of caution. Things like the TOR browser \ndon't completely mask your activity. If you do something illegal and aren't \nobfuscated enough law enforcement will eventually catch you. Bottom line, \ndo not do something stupid.\n\nAlso, hello NSA analyst reading this. Thank you for trying to determine if \nI'm a threat while also breaching my rights and possibly putting me on a \nwatchlist.",

This would \nresult in a explosion of devices and software. Imagine a processor the size \nof 1/8th of a desktop CPU chip.

For the next moment, lets toss \n\"Religion\" out the window and disconnect it from a \"God\". As well as rid of \nthe whole \"God is a bearded man that intervenes\" belief. Now, where did \nthis all come from? This complex information system? The Big bang explains \nthe \"How\" if you choose to believe it but like all people ask, what was \nbefore? Right now, no one knows at all. It could very well be a creation, a \nsimulation, an experiment, a fluke, we don't know. It could have been \ncreated 2 minutes ago but with a history put in place so we felt we were \nalways here. None of us know. So when you young \"Atheists\" and young \n\"Religious\" folk stir up a war and scream \"Can't be a god!\" or \"Cant be \nnothing!\" you're both wrong... or you're both right. You can't tell someone \nwhat its not, if you don't know at all. Our logic is limited to our \nexperience, in this Universe we experience no controller, just cause and \neffect. Things NEED to be created and WILL die out. We can't imagine \nanything other than that making any sense. We can't imagine a Color we've \nnever experienced before because we never experienced it. Could a being \nhave created this? Yes. Could have it been from absolute nothingness? Yes. \nSo stop being ignorant and open your minds to new ideas, thats what makes \nyou a thinker. Closing your mind to what you simply dislike or don't \nunderstand.. well.. is ignorant.\ufeff",

(even though it's observed every \nfucking day)\" or \"Well, if there isn't a God, then how come this book that \nwas written by God that is so inconsistant with itself exists?\" or even \n\"Okay, so God doesn't exist? Well you guys always use the burden of proof, \nso burden's on you! (even though that's not how the burden of proof \nprinciple works)\" and many more. The main thing is, it's not all of \natheists that are the real problem, and it's not all of religion that's the \nreal problem. Atheism+ is about as good as the YouTube X Google+ thingy \n(just like the removal of the character limit, the addition of secular \nhumanism was good, the rest is trash.), and the religious folks who are \nalways like \"FOLLOW ALLAH, THE TRUE GOD!\" \"Jesus is our saviour, he died \nfor our sins. We must respect him, or be sent to the eternal flame of \nmisary and dismay\" \"GOD WILL SAVE YOU, THE LIGHT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT SHALL \nGUIDE YOU!!\" and so on if someone so much as hints to a religious idea are \nalso the problem.

Why do people that are gifted with understanding what is so \nmysterious to most have to continue to distance themselves by always being \nso dismissive. It makes the rest of us, those that have a genuine interest, \nafraid to speak up, at the expense of looking dim. Well, here it goes, I'm \njumping in and reaching out. You guys know that you are ahead of the rest \nof us. How about some constructive criticism, so the rest of us can \ncontinue to learn?  \ufeff",

                    "text": "+tehfutureawesome Each website could be \"saved\" somewhere entirely \ndifferent to another. Web pages are \"saved\", to use your terms, on servers. \nEach server has its own unique IP address. Servers are basically just \ncomputers programmed to take requests and return things back out.\n\nWhen you go to a web page by typing a URL, that name has to be converted \ninto an IP. Each domain name can have a different IP address associated \nwith it. When you try to go to a webpage, there are specific servers called \n\"Domain Name Servers\", or DNS, that convert the Domain name into it's IP so \nyour data can be sent to the right place.\n\nWhen you make a request to see a web page, the source (yours) and \ndestination (the server's) IPs are attached to your request. Your request \ntravels through networks, making paths through the internet until it \nreaches the server where the specific web page is \"saved\".\n\nThe server can do what it wants with your data. For example your IP is \nlikely to not do anything when I make a request to it - you've not set up a \nweb server . I could probably 'Ping' it to see if it's online, but that's \nabout it. You aren't hosting a web page or hosting for the WWW - you are \njust online the Internet. Web servers will take your data, and return what \nyou requested (if all goes well) sending it back through the networks, \nuntil it reaches your network. 'Routers' are what pass on or 'Route' it \naround.\n\nThey are generally all connected together with cables. Your data will \ntravel down fibre optic cables at near to the speed of light when \ntravelling across countries or any long distance, even under the sea. It \nwould be very slow if it had to use satellites. I believe that's why \nconnection speed on cruise ships is very slow - they use satellites to \nconnect to the rest of the network.\nhttp://www.fastcodesign.com/1671777/infographic-the-550000-miles-of-undersea-cabling-that-powers-the-internet\n\nThis is my understanding. Alas, I'm only 17 so I have much to learn. I \ntried to put this in Layman's terms although I had to use some specialist \nterms - feel free to look them up.",

When modems was pushed down under \n$100.\n\nRemember now it was 4 years from 386 to 486 and 4 years from 486 to \nPentium. We been living with core i series for 6 years now... sure some \nrevision, but they are some what similar.\n\nFrom i heard of the internet about 89-90 or so, then the web was released \nto the public in 91 and it totally exploded. 5-6 years later IRC was \nreplaced with web-chat. Pop was replaced with webmail, FTP was replaced \nwith weblinked dokuments. Downloaded music/videos was replaced with plugin \nplayers and streaming.\n\nFirst i tryed webstreaming was in 1996. Most of them used hacked mpeg1 that \nremoved some of the overhead and compressed harder. It still looked quite \nokay, but you have to download a plugin for every different company so its \ndidnt work if you had no root access. I think it was 1998 when macromedia \nbought up some of the companies and also implemented more modern H.263 \ncodec it finally worked in every day use. Every time macromedia updated, \nyou need up update it... it still worked thow.\nWas first far later that it was solved, probobly was youtube one of the \nfirst that actually detected your macromedia version and fed the corect \ncode regardless of installed version. Then everybody start using youtube \nbecause it always worked.\n\nIt was quite a while with just  about everything from Bluetooth, to Wlan to \nmobile surf, webvideo, online shoping and so one, where it existed commonly \nfrom about 1996-1997 until it worked properly in about 2003-2005\n\nThinking back, i bought my first computer 1994. It cost about $2000 and it \ncould hardly play video, it had no interconnection and i have to use 1.44MB \nflopyes for everything. I could borrow a 14kbit modem and use it over the \nland line.\n\n2002 i bought my first 3G phone. It cost $0 (plus $19/month). Could play \nvideo, store on 512MB flash SD cards, stream video download at 2Mbit/s just \nabout everywhere. I could bluetooth it to my laptop and use is as a \nwireless modem and play Battlefield 1942 on the train! (well.. in the \ndensly populated part of the country)\n\nIt was less than 8 years between...  and thinking, the development can\u00b4t \ncontinue at this speed...\n\n... and it diden\u00b4t... now we also have multitoutch...",

NASA's \nDeep Space Network is a network of dishes and satellites which provide data \nconnections to and from spacecrafts.\n\nIt's by no means the internet, but they are tackling some important issues \nregarding packet loss and delays of hours instead of milliseconds. On the \nnormal internet, if a packet gets lost your computer will request a new one \nand probably get it within a second. In space that could take hours. So \nclearly our current protocols aren't suited very well to that kind of \nnetworks. It's really fighting against the laws of physics to get any kind \nof data back and forth reliably. The distances are simply unimaginable.\n\nPart of the DSN is finding solutions to those issues so that spacecrafts \ncan be controlled and send back meaningful data. When we eventually do \nsettle on Mars or anywhere else, you can be sure that the data link between \nthe planets will have a lot in common with the DSN.\n\nOn a personal note, I believe that the internet is a historic invention \nlike fire. I like to see it as a kind of brain for the organism that is the \nhuman species. It allows absolutely anyone to exchange information with any \nother person. It's a goldmine of knowledge, information and improbable \ncollaborations. It has already transformed out lives and I think it's only \ngetting started. Back to the fire analogy: We've now learned how to cook \nmeat and stay warm at night. I'm excited to find out what the combustion \nengine might look like ;)",

Well while the Call of \nDuty series is pretty mindless, there's alot of games like Hotline Miami, \nAVP 2010's Alien Campaign, Half-Life, Warframe, ect. They rely on you \ndeveloping a strategy around what you have, what's on the map, how the map \nis shaped, how strong the enemies are, where's the best places to strike \nfrom, how you can strike, the speed at which you can strike, the ease of \ntaking down an opponent, the avalability of safe spots, and much more. In \nHalf-Life, if you just charge the Gargantua before the chaper On A Rail, \nyou'll get #rekt, if you charge General Vor in Warframe then WHOOPS YOU \nDIED!! AVP 2010, as a Xenomorph you have no ranged attacks, so you can't \njust charge the Marines or Predators because you're clearly mortal.

He asked me to watch this video and I replied as follows:\nYes, very interesting, although in my opinion the bit about books compared \nwith screens is very superficial. The thing is that people read books and \nuse screens for entirely different reasons; some people who do a lot of \ngaming also read a lot of books, and what they're looking for in one medium \nis entirely different from what they're looking in the other. They enjoy \nbeing 'in charge' of the narrative when using a screen, and they also enjoy \nbeing directed (and not necessarily in charge) when reading a book. So I \nthink that the guy in the video is setting up a false comparison; books are \nnot 'better' than screens, and screens are not 'better' than books - they \nfulfill different requirements. People who manage to benefit from books and \nscreens are better off than people who only involve themselves with one or \nthe other. He doesn't actually say that screens exercise the brain more \nthan books, but he implies it - and what I would say is that some books no \ndoubt exercise the brain a great deal and others not so much, if at all. \n\nHowever, I think he's wrong to say (or imply) that people who read books \nare being lead in a way that people playing sophisticated video games are \nnot; this is too much of a generalisation; again, it depends on the book \n(and the screen activity). A great writer places an idea or an image before \nthe reader, who will make something of it - and the range of things that \ncan be made of a single idea or image can be vast. A great writer doesn't \ndirect the reader and tell him what to think - he/she opens up the world to \nthe reader, often through very inconspicuous details. A poor writer can't \ndo this, and I imagine that people who read crappy books would indeed be \nbetter off spending their time on a screen. By the same token, some things \nthat people absorb through screens will genuinely benefit them, while \nothers won't. So I think that what this guy has to say at this point in the \nvideo simply isn't subtle enough. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure what is meant, precisely, by 'exercise' for the brain. \nWhatever the positive/negative effects of either reading or 'screening', \nthe fact is that one has to put more work into reading a demanding book (or \nperhaps any book) than into doing stuff on a screen. I would argue that the \neffort required to interpret the author's words is in some ways a bit like \nhaving to dig diamonds out of the earth a mile below the surface and in \ntesting conditions, rather than simply finding them lying around on the \nsurface, to be simply picked up and marvelled at. This process of \nintellectual 'mining' is what in my opinion makes many books more valuable \nas 'brain exercise' than most computer games or other screen activity. I'm \nnot saying that all computer games/screen activity is less valuable than \nmost books; just that, just as the vast majority of books are very \nrewarding, just as the vast majority of songs are not very rewarding, just \nas the vast majority of paintings are not very rewarding - so are the vast \nmajority of computer games not very rewarding. Like all those books, songs \nand paintings, most computer games no doubt provide activity for the brain, \nbut it's not necessarily very valuable activity. ",

Using the browser isn't \ngenerally a concern for any reason unless you go on your personal stuff, or \nsimply browsing certain parts of the internet is a crime in your country. \nIt's not advised to go on your personal things like Facebook on TOR, \nbecause that ruins the magic of being anonymous, those bits of information \nare sent to hundreds of computers, and you can be easily tracked from \nthere. TOR has multiple uses. It is a hole used to access some parts of the \ndeep web, or \"darknet\" and is also a way of keeping your anonymity. All of \nthe information sent from your computer, is then sent to hundreds of \ncomputers through peer to peer connection before you reach your \ndestination, which all of those bits of information sent are scrambled and \nthen unscrambled when reaching the website you want to access, and then \nit's all sent back to you using the standard UDP and TCP protocols that the \nnormal world wide web uses. The part that may be concerning is that the \ndeep web has things on it that might not be suitable for viewing. One such \nexample (that no longer exists today) is \"The Silk Road\" which was one of \nthe largest online black markets that had ever existed before, where \nillegal guns, drugs, and even HITS, (hiring someone to kill another person) \nwere sold in online bitcoin transactions. It's not exactly so \"deep\" \nbecause searches for it have expanded more and more to the surface of the \nweb, and it's not exactly the secret thing you need to access a secret \nwebsite anymore. TOR has proven that it's security can be cracked, which it \nhas been by the NSA, and the owner of the silk road was arrested. Not only \nthat, but other things have been proven. Many High ranking officials and \nFBI agents lurk TOR, and bait users to click on illegal sites like child \nporn or money printing services, which are tricks to track you down and \nhave you arrested. Many of TOR's servers have been proven to simply be \nbotnets and aren't actual people, but zombie computers. Now, the deep web \nrequires common sense to navigate through. Don't go searching the deep web \nfor illegal things, and don't be stupid, but simply browsing it and finding \nthings that don't fit that criteria, and you'll be just fine.\nThe conclusion? Using TOR is completely fine. Your intentions define your \nexperience. If you're just curious, and you play your cards right, you \nshouldn't find anything that can make you say \"I've seen some shit\" unless \nyou were looking for it. If you're looking for illegal things, it could be \nlegitimate, or it could be a high ranking official that would really like \nyou in a jail cell. If you're looking to spam/harass people so you can \nchange your IP and never be IP banned, it could work, and it's very \nunlikely you'll get into any serious trouble with it, but don't use your \npersonal account, because you could compromise it to hackers looking for \nyour information.",

We never claim to have \"the absolute truth\", but we try \nto use everything accessible to us to get as close to the truth as we can. \nIn science, we keep our minds open to what we haven't known, to all sorts \nof possibilities, but we simply don't accept any possibility to be true \nuntil we can test them.

With all sorts of deities and supernatural stuff human has ever \nthought of (and even Hogwarts!), we say that they are *possible but \nimprobable*, until someone can prove them. If you just believe in a certain \npossibility without any evidence and then it turns out out to be true, it \nmeans nothing but you have a *lucky guess*.
