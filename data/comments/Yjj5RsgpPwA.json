We can all \nrespect that. It just felt wrong to not admire something so good people \ncreated with 0$ budget. But then, with nearly a million dollar of fan \ndonations, they twisted everything we hoped for into...this. WHAT IS THIS!? \nGet sober Hangover, you can still make things right! Everybody expects that \nin season 2 (and how can you call 4 episodes a season like seriously) you \nmake something really good like YOU KNOW YOU CAN!! ",

HOW COOL IS THAT!? \nBut the actual series? Bee suddenly gained a 100 pounds, they switched the \nstyle completely, it's not even fun anymore, the main problem is not \nkilling monsters but looking cute, and the villains are not even cool, \noriginal creatures but...giant cats?

A lot of money goes into hiring additional animators and writers.\n\nStill, while that is true, I also think that they should have been able to \nmake twice the episodes they said they could. While the animation is \namazing, it's not very hard to capture, and it's not like it's incredibly \nhigh definition. The art style is unique and great, but it doesn't take the \nbudget that they're anticipating. The writing is also really good, but \nthere's only so much a writer can charge for good writing. I think that \nthey overestimated the cost per episode, and may or may not release extra \nepisodes at the end of the season to compensate.",

You look different...\"\n\nIt's possible that Puppycat is the Space Outlaw (considering his reflection \nthing in the pilot episode shows as much), and he was transformed into some \nweird *thing* that nobody except Bee apparently wants, because cat/dogs are \nweird. Bee suddenly cry's a crystal tear-drop.... something is special \nabout her, but we do know that she's weird, has a eating disorder, and is \nincredibly lonely. It's possible that, like you said, the Space Princess' \nfather dealt with the Outlaw without his daughter knowing about it, and now \nshe's a sobbing wreck... or perhaps she's eccentric enough that she forgot \nabout the meet-up time xD\n\nEither way, Bee and [Puppycat] somehow got reunited again, but in different \ncircumstances while still retaining their personality's. They stick \ntogether for some inexplicable reason, and I'm curious to know if this is \nthe \"bond\" they shared before or if it's something else.\n\nAnyways, time will tell us and hopefully we'll get some answers before the \nseries is finished :-)",
