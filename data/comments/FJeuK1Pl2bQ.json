The truth of the \nmatter is, all guys, at some point or another will be hit in the balls \nwhether it be be a kick, motorcycle, horseback, a ball, etc. its \ninevitable. While girls on the other hand say \"we have to go through child \nbirth.\" Well, no you don't, thats a choice you're letting happen. I'm not \nabout to let someone boot me in the nuts because in no way is that \nassociated with pleasure for my party, yet conceiving a baby is pleasure \nfor both. \ufeff",

It sounds like the immediate pain lasts only a short while, but can \nstill ache for a couple of hours. \n\nAs bad as that is, I would still say childbirth sounds a LOT worse. Pain \nmeds aren't always available or an option (allergies to medications), and \nthey only last a short while. Have you ever seen a woman giving birth? \nShe's beet red, covered in sweat, her veins are bulging, and she's shitting \nherself without even noticing it. All the muscles in her abdomen are \nstraining and cramping trying to force something the size of a watermelon \nout of a hole the size of an egg, and her perineum (the skin between her \nvagina and anus) often tears during the whole thing, again without her \nnoticing it. Depending on the individual woman, labour can last anywhere \nfrom a few hours to a few days. If all goes well, she has to stay in the \nhospital for at least a couple of days, and it takes a year for her body to \nrecover from the trauma of the whole thing. \n\nSome women even die in childbirth, but I've never heard of a man die from \nbeing kicked in the balls. Not saying it never happens or that it isn't \nextremely painful, but it must be extremely rare (I tried searching it on \ngoogle and found nothing). Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of women die \nevery year during childbirth.\ufeff",

The periods are not really at question here.\n \nBut also remember that our bodies do not remember pain except for the \nemotions attached to them. If you have a positive enough connection with a \npainful process that you would want to go through it again, can it really \nbe all that bad? I  mean  look at masochists. They do things most people \nwouldn't even dream of doing and they do it repeatedly simply because they \nhave a positive emotion applied to it. To them it is something normal, to \nus it is absolute mind numbing, pain, and agony. So in this case, if the \nnine months were worth it in the end, can that truly be considered worse \noff then hours of excruciating pain that were not worth it or wanting to be \nrepeated?

Getting kicked in the balls \ndoesn't amount to anything, so of course you wouldn't willingly volunteer \nto go through that. However, sometimes having a 2nd child, or for your \nchild to have siblings is totally worth the pain.\n\nI'd also like to suggest that females might have it much worse because \nbefore having to give birth, you have to carry a child for 9 months while \ngoing through massive body and hormonal changes. As ASAPSCI talked about in \nthe Heartbreak video, emotional feelings such as hormonal \ndepression/heartbreak trigger the same region in the brain as physical \npain. I'm not arguing that women go through intense pain like childbirth \nfor 9months+ --that's ridiculous.

That is like saying a paper cut in between your finger that annoys \nyou for a few days hurts more than a twisted nipple which only hurts for a \ncouple minutes or so. And plus, women, under normal circumstances, are \ndrugged and expecting. Getting hit in the junk is usually unexpected and \nwithout any medication to numb the pain. Not even adrenaline is that fast. \n\nThe next argument is that it is (again under normal circumstances) a choice \nto give birth. Why would women go through the pain of child birth if it is \na.) easier to adopt, and b.) as painful as everyone claims. \n\nAnd if you DO want to talk about pain time-wise, guys spend their ENTIRE \nLIVES protecting that area. Getting hit in the nether region can happen at \nany moment, on any day, at any age. Think about that for a moment.\n\nFinally, giving birth is natural. A woman's body is created to give birth. \nThis means it has some level of preparing itself for the pain to come. Or \nat least, more so than a man getting hit in the groin. \n\nFinal accusation: As far as highest point of pain, the guys win that \nargument. As far as the experience OVERALL PAIN the women no doubt have it \nharder. \n\n                                                                            \n         Cheers.\ufeff",

I also know both men who can take a hit to the junk \nwithout much whining while others fall on the floor and cry uncontrollably. \nHow is it anything but subjective? How can we not call it a tie under such \ncircumstances?\n\nA broken nose is a lame comparison to anything, to be honest. Mine was \nbroken too (my crooked nose proves it, lol), and I can honestly say a \nperiod hurts a lot worse than that sometimes. Tiny little stabs in the \nuterus... ugh. :(",

If \nthey are not, then that may cause a man to become sterile which is not \nnatural.\n\n\"Pain is subjective\" yes but we can all agree that some things hurt more \nthan others. \n\n\"You don't think it is as advised to give birth while drugged\" 90% of \nmodern births are drugged, and everyone seems to turn out fine for the most \npart. Honestly I don't see why you would want to do it naturally, and for \nthe sake of argument, if the option is there, you can't say \"well I did it \nwithout drugs, so therefore it hurts more\" and refuse. \n\n\"That area.... if you will, rips while giving birth. I can to a certain \nextent compare that to certain types of pain that I have/can experience/d. \nI would imagine it would be similar to skin being pulled apart, but on a \nlarger more sensitive scale. (correct me if I'm wrong). However, getting \nhit in the junk is a pain that is unrelatable to any other kind. It is a \nsickening internal pain. It doesn't feel like a punch to the shoulder or a \ncut from something sharp. Also realize that the body does everything it can \nto tell your conscious mind that hitting that area is a VERY bad thing. \nMore or less the existence of the human race. So if that area is damaged, \ngiving a huge shockwave of pain is how it lets us know to stop doing what \nit is we are doing.\n\nDon't feel like I'm trying to make childbirth sound easy. Absolutely not \nwhat I'm trying to say. But I've broken my nose on a metal pole before, and \nthat pain was nothing compared to a good shot to the groin. ",

Just \nbecause a woman chooses to have a child (you love your significant other \nand want to see little mixes of the two of you) doesn't mean she knows how \npainful it will be. Also, I don't think it's advised for women to be \ndrugged when they give birth. It's healthiest for it to be all natural, so \nthey can push and stuff.\n\nHow is a man being hit in the junk less natural than a woman giving birth? \nIt's exposed, therefore bound to be hit at some point. You're stronger than \nmost women, but have that weak spot. You are prepared for being hit at \ntimes, you just said it and then changed your mind in the next paragraph. \n\nFinal point: we make estimations regarding pain levels and it is \nsubjective. Let's not forget that oftentimes, when women give birth, their \nvagina also rips a bit in the process and sometimes hemorrhoids come out as \nwell, all at once.\n\nI'm not saying being hit in the balls is better, but calling it a tie just \nseems fair considering everything implied.

Plus cramping from mussel contractions and the fact \nthat a high percentage of woman TEAR THERE BODY APART from vagina to rectum \nand need to be stitched up immediately after giving birth.

Getting kicked in the balls must \nhurt as HELL, but I've never experienced it (I am female~) You can \nexperience excruciating pain, then have it linger for (Days? Weeks? \nMonths?).

Contractions, \nbleeding, sweating, nausea, you name it!And the aftermath...But with \nchildbirth comes the gift of life. So don't be bitching about 'Why don't \nyou adopt? You don't have to have a baby, y'know?' \n\nThink about this: Tell that to your mother.\n\nGetting kicked in the balls is pointless. You don't need it, so do me a \nfavor and don't kick anyone in the balls unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. And \nfeminist? Please, stop. Just stop.\ufeff",

I immediately fall on my knees or crunch trying to get air and I \nfeel like having a metal rod in my throat. Then the nausea comes. And when \nyou try to walk it hurts when you move so you can't run or stand upright.\n\nSo I believe when talking about having a baby vs being kicked it all comes \nto duration vs intensity.\ufeff",

Also, you still seem to think that the purpose of the \ntestes being \"removed\" from the rest of the body is to absorb any impact; \nit's not.

It's even lower in first-world countries \nin particular. The US (as an arbitrary choice for a first-world country) \nhas a rate of maternal death of around 0.01846 percent (i.e., on average, \none in 5,416 women going through childbirth in the US die).

When it begins, when it is finished? The \nfact it's that a childbirth takes a longer time and that contributes a lot \nto the pain that someone feels. You can't take a random second of a \nchildbirth and compare it with the moment when you get kicked in the balls \nand say \"that both are equally painful\". It's like to compare the pain when \nyour kick something hard with your toe with the pain of breaking a bone. \nMaybe in the moment both are equally painfull, but no one would say \"it's \nthe same pain\". Everybody would be agree that breaking an arm is much more \npainful because we also take in count the time. \n\nSo I will make this question: Why we don't do take the time in count in \nthis case? Why we only take a moment? By those standars we can say a lot of \ncrazy things, like falling from the stairs is equally painfull to a \nchildbirth or that cutting your finger with a paper is equally painfull \nthat a kick in the balls. This is what happens when you compare apples with \noranges? No this is what happen when you compare apples with elves.\n\nAnd second, why some guys make this kind of discussion a battle of sexes? \nOK guys, you feel more pain. No let's go to a corner and began to sing \"We \nare tha campions\"! It's like to make a contest about who is the most \nidiotic-stinky-ugly-person, get the 1st prize and being happy with that!",

I can only really describe it as a hot metal \nneedle on the inside of you slowly trying to stab it's way out. And what's \nworse, people treat periods like it's just something we have to deal with. \nYou can't get off gym because of a period, but you sure can hell if you get \nkicked in the balls.

Yes, women menstruate and I feel \nthat they will forever be jealous of guys because we don't, but trust me, \nsociety and life in general has its own way of making males hurt in ways \nthat women just could never understand... not to mention that we oftentimes \nhave to \"suck it up\" when we are upset or injured in a way that is not \nexpected of females.",

As the baby \nprepares for birth, it releases chemicals into the mother's blood stream \nthat activate this system, as well as the uterine contractions and cervical \ndialation. So a woman's body has time to prepare for birth. A man does not \nhave that luxury before getting kicked in the balls. \n\nEver stubbed you toe really hard? Remember how much it hurt? Try stubbing \nit hard enough that you break both your toe and the table leg you stubbed \nit on. Now imagine it's not just your toe that hurts, it a pain shooting \ntrough your body (parasympathetic nervous system, I believe). No time for \nthe oxytocin to set in or an epidural to be given. You're writhing in pain \njust like a man is when he gets kicked in the balls. \n\n\n\nSecondly, be thankful your ovaries are inside your body and not hanging out \nthere to get kicked. At least they are protected by being inside your own \nbody along with a layer of muscle and tissue. Because Testes need a \nslightly cooler temperature to produce sperm, our vital reproductive organs \nare left hanging on a thin flab of skin that raunchy men refer to as the \n\"dick\". When you get kicked in the dick, it's not like like your taking a \nGo Ju Ryu kick in the right stomach. You are actually getting kicked RIGHT \nIN THE ORGANS. \n\n\n\nSeriously, if giving birth is like having a watermelon crammed up you anus, \ngetting kicked in the balls is like getting that water melon crammed up \nyour urethra at lightning speed. Only about 10x worse since it's not \nnatural to take a low blow right in the sac, so the body doesn't release \nthe oxytocin I mentioned earlier. It may not last as long, but the few \nminutes after being kicked in the balls will be the worst of your life.",

So, '1. -----' \nwould be regarding your first paragraph section thing.\n\n1. While I did say that, it's just to make things fair. I'm still comparing \nwhat we're trying to compare, just over different periods of time. And even \nso, the amount of time a guy is in pain would probably add up to be quite a \nfew hours, putting the amount of pain from child birth and the amount of \npain from being kicked in the balls at an equal starting point, \nduration-wise. That's simply to stop people from saying \"Child birth is \nworse 'cause it lasts longer!\". You can't do that. You have to look at the \nbig picture while sticking to the 2 things being compared.\n\n2. Refer to 1. However, if you want to give women that huge advantage (or \ndisadvantage, really), then yes. Birthing one child would probably be worse \nthan getting kicked in the balls, under most circumstances.\n\n3. Alright. While the period may be related, it's still not the same thing, \nso stop trying to say women have it worse because of that. I don't care as \nI'm comparing the pain from child birth and kick in the balls. NOT a period.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want to compare one menstrual cycle and one kick in the \nballs, I'd probably put those at the same level of ouch. They both can, \ndepending on the individual, cause abdominal cramps, major pain, nausea, \namong other things. There's one big difference between the two, if we're \nnot counting the amount of time they last. The menstrual cycle keeps a \nwoman healthy and ready for child birth, but being kicked in the balls \ncould stop a man from being able to produce children. Though on a \nphysically painful point, they're probably about even, if we don't consider \nfrequency.\n\n4. Men can't keep their balls safe. I mean, what are we gonna do; wear \nuncomfortable and ineffective cups all day, every day? Don't think so. As \nfor circumcision, that's nowhere near a fair argument for either side as \nmost guys are forced into being circumcised (in the US anyway) before they \ncan even think! However, if that's the case, we don't remember the pain \nfrom it, so it doesn't matter. Therefore, that's not something you can use \nas comparison as we can't even remember it happening.\n\nAs for the last sentence about *kicks*, there's no reason we should be \ndirectly using kicks other than for simplicity's sake. Kick should refer to \nany painful impact to the balls. If we only use kicks, then we're talking \nabout dumbasses who think they know how to kick properly, but miss the \nballs and typically cause little to no pain whatsoever, so the pain isn't \neven comparable. However, taking a baseball bat to the balls will be the \nworst pain a guy will ever experience. There's many variables that have to \nbe taken into account. And yes, there's plenty for the woman's side, as \nwell.\n\n5. That's completely true. However, if you're gonna try to compare the two \nfor some reason, you have to at least look at the big picture and be \ncompletely unbiased. You can't say \"Women have it worse because x, y, and \nz\" while only comparing against x for men. Likewise, you can't say \"Men \nhave it worse because we say so!\". All I ask is for people to be unbiased \nfor once.",

I agree that what i've said previously \nshouldn't be considered regarding your argument, but I only brought up the \ntopic of periods because you started talking about how men will take many \nblows to their balls throughout their life. \n\nI thought we were comparing one time a woman goes through childbirth with a \nman getting one kick in the balls.\n\nI'm just saying that the menstrual cycle and childbirth are both closely \nrelated things, and that while it's fair enough to say that not all women \ngo through childbirth, periods are inevitable for an average healthy woman \n(and women who go through childbirth will obviously go through periods!)). \nAnd again, I'm not talking about all women, but *some* really do experience \nmajor cramps, nausea, cold sweats and diarrhoea, and possibly other things \nwhich are far worse and beyond what I can imagine.\n\nMen on the other hand, are given the option to keep their balls safe, and \nif not for their religion or beliefs, they don't have to go through \ncircumcision (here you go, it's that \"something\" you wanted for the male \nside) and go through the pain there. I know that there are everyday \naccidents where your balls could get hurt, but unless you're really that \nvulnerable, you probably won't experience major *kicks* to the balls.\n\n*I'm just going to reinforce my point again, but I don't think there's \nanyway you can compare the two things because everybody feels pain \ndifferently.*",
