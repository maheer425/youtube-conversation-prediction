In a way, \npost production dubbing (aka ADR) is probably used in every cinematic \nfeature length film.\nIf you are on a remote location.... the scene still needs lighting so you \nbring generators. The generators aren't quiet so your production audio \ncan't be used in the film but can be used as a guide track.\nTypically they get actors back in during the post process to re do the \nlines.... sometimes even change them.\nThis channel revolves around the ADR process and it's been a cinematic \nprocess for quite some time.",

Putting an asterisk at the end* of a word particularly \nin a sentence can generate confusion, as most people will have seen the \nother way and not be sure which word you're correcting. (End? Of?)\n\nIn standard English literature every form of punctuation that doesn't \nrepresent a break, pause, expression or separation goes before the word, \nwhether in pairs or not.\n\nSuch as (brackets), \"quote marks\", \u00a320 numerical designations, and \ncitations.\n-The Founder, 2014\n\n(With the exception of the percentage sign, for some odd reason.)\n\nHence the default of new modern designations such as: #you 'rewrong, \nwww.yourewrong.org/thissubpageisrepresentedbyaforwardslash, and +Cameron \nMacLean is wrong .\n\nThis is because standard English text is written left to write, and \npunctuation serves as a signpost denoting what context the following text \nis to be read under. You would only put a designation AFTER the text if you \nwere reading it from right to left and therefore needed that information \nfirst.\n\nExpressive punctuations such as exclamation marks and question marks go at \nthe end to indicate the emotional tone such that it isn't forgotten by the \nend of the sentence, to aid in fiction and the general ease of conveying \nemotion. A good case could be made that we should put one at the start of \nthe sentence too, for the same reasons already stated, which is what many \nother languages do. But alas, it is not to be.\n\nIn addition to all that, there already IS a precedent for putting an \nasterisk at the end* of a word.\n\n*For further reference or clarification elsewhere, to avoid cluttering up \nthe sentence.\n\n\nI don't normally give random grammar lessons to strangers, but if you're \ngoing to be a smart ass and attempt to correct someone who was merely \nperforming the public service of safeguarding the internet from either bad \nspelling or helping someone notice a typo that might be making them look \nstupid, you should probably know what you're talking about first.\n\nI mean it's already a dick move.
