Is your and Benjamin's point that TED only attempts to inspire \nand engender corporate aggrandizement, presenting only the bright sides of  \ntechnological innovation and advancement, appealing to idyllic emotionalism \nand whatever's currently in vogue (possibly put there by corporate \npropaganda), while neglecting to address the possible negative \nrepurcussions of said exploration and advancement? If this is what TED \ndoes, then I would agree with both you and Benjamin. I am going to watch \nmore TED talks and see more of what you are describing. I am also going to \nhave to watch Benjamin's presentation again.\n \nYour points raise some interesting quandaries.\n \nOne is whether anyone will watch anything that doesn't appeal to their \nemotionalism or their need to be inspired. We humans seem to be pretty \nsimple in that regard.\n \nSecondly, if TED allows the critiquing of creative innovation, will \ncorporations shut them down? On Fox, would TED become the liberal agenda? \nOn CNN, would TED become aloof and elitist scientists and/or denial \nadvocates?\n \nThirdly, hindsight is 20/20... foresight is 0/0... I'm not so sure anyone \nwill ever will be able, willing or daring enough to accurately explore and \npresent the negatives. Valiant though their endeavors might be, anything \nthey say will likely be, basically, ignored.\n \nWe humans seem to be built to go forward without too much thinking. We may \nbe simply fated to suffer the unforeseen, unpredicable consequences of our \nfoolish endeavors. (as long as those who profit from our foolish endeavors \ncontinue to push us to do so)\n \nIt seems that what we may now be learning is that technological evolution \ngoes full circle... that all this wondrous innovation may actually be \nleading to societal, moral, ethical decay, environmental havoc, gross \nseparation of rich and poor, and the innermost disquieting feelings that \nall is really NOT right with the world.\n \nSo what's the point of presenting the downsides if nobody will listen? \nPerhaps the point is, it's the right thing to do.

Maybe it's hard to follow some references he's throwing \nat you, but his talk makes a lot of sense.\n\nI don't know if I can simplify and convey it, but according to him (maybe \nI'm wrong or he's wrong) TED or society in general, believe that some guys \ncoming up with ideas can just change the world. For example, a guy travels \nto India, sees the shit on streets and decides that people need to be set \nup with portable toilets and Indian sanitation problem (at least this \naspect of it) will be solved. \nBut then it turns out that this doesn't work, because Indian culture says \nthat it's not right to sh** indoors on such a toilet, and when you're \noutdoors, nobody uses the toilets because they can just sh** on the street. \nIt's not that they're dumb people, but their view of the world is \ndifferent. And that's much harder to change than just give them some tech \nsolution. \n\nThe same with drones and automated manufacturing and new technologies... \nPeople think that actually IN CAPITALISM AT ITS CURRENT FORM we'll be \nbetter off with all that, but we won't be. They'll either 1) make us lazy \nand complacent 2) kick us out of our jobs. We need to tear down the old \nsystem, at least question it more, and I also don't know the magic formula, \nbut whatever we have now will not help us to correctly distribute the \nbenefits of information age to everyone. \n\nHe said it correctly- when people on TED talks talk about something they \nhave invented, they usually just brush past any cultural, politic, \neconomic, social etc. implications of it. They just say ''well, it can be \nused both in good and bad way, but I'm sure we'll all be ok, because this \ngives us XYZ etc. benefits''. People hype Google Glass, only to realize \nthat people still want their privacy badly and can even beat you up because \nyou have a camera face. People invent Bitcoin and say ''oh this will change \nthe world'', only to stumble with hacks, thefts and government \nregulation.... \n\nAll the ideas and hard work won't help you, if society is not on the same \npage with you. We co-opt technologies, we don't disclose their and also our \npotential. For example, why the f*** a person living in India cannot access \nthe same Netflix Americans can? Cause society, regulations, distribution of \nrights- it's not a technological problem. It's our problem as society. With \nlots of things, the problem is not our lacking of technology, the problem \nis culture, politics etc. Why Mexico and India are poorer than USA? And do \nyou think that if we teach them code or farm, they'll be better off. Hell \nno! Why? Because centuries of fucked up political and cultural shit, that's \nwhy. There needs to be a cultural shift. If culturally people of those \nplaces changed overnight, they wouldn't need any aid or help from outside, \nthe same for Africa. Transplant any working part of democratic \nparticipatory society in poorest corner of Africa, and if it will not \nthrive, it will at least be the most developed corner in the continent. Not \nbecause racism, but because these people will have completely different \ncultural and political background. I mean, look at Israel and its \nneighbours. It's not that Arabs are worthless people and Jews are just that \ngood. It's also not a religion thing. It's political thing. Fu** up any \nWestern country's political systems enough (increase corruption a few \ntimes, destroy trust to justice system, private property rights and free \ncompetition) and they'll be right where most of Africa is. No drilling of \nwells can help the big picture, if a local villager who sets up his own \nbusiness is shut down and bankrupted because some president's right wing \nman is his competition... Sure it happens in West too, but these are \nexceptional cases, not everyday realities.\n\nThe essence of the long rant is just that THINGS... ARE... COMPLICATED. \ufeff",

There is only so much time in a day, yes \n24 hours. There is only so much information you can possibly digest or \nread, in a single given day. If you have to sift 98% bs in order to get 2% \ngolden nuggest, then your platform is inherently flawed. It simply doesn't \nwork. Its not a problem that \"no one\" else can be able to solve this \nproblem, because there are other forums that are 100 times more capable, \nexcept that given all the attention is given to a crappy space. The people \nthat should be rewarded are not rewarded, simple as that. Its the best \nproduct or the most useful that wins market share, and TED knows this very \nwell. TED is actively destroying real innovation, and it is fundamentally \nimpossible for it to change unless they completely change their whole \npurpose. TED is the total opposite of \"changing the world\" it is actually \npreventing it from changing for good. It just promotes more of the same.",

In the first place the technology will \nchange the world, and not because some dudes are preaching it from a \npulpit. But because its technological base, has the potential, has the \npeople working on the actual solution to the problems you talked about and \nit is not mumbo jumbo gibberish pie in the sky solutions. They are actually \nworking already, the code is functional, the solutions are already here, \nits just hard to convince others to use it. The main reason is precisely \nthe whole point of the talk, people need to be pitched a sale. I think we \nare starting to see the cultural shift when it comes to BTC particularly, \nnow its all popular, and that is a good thing when it comes to real and \nactual innovation in the space. The problem is 99.999% what gets all the \nattention is pure gibberish hog wash products that have no real value to \nthe poor in the world. Bitcoin entrepreneurs are doing the hard work, of \nprecisely the cultural, religious, political work in order to get it \naccepted. There is always a healthy criticism from bitcoin advocates, they \nare not selling a Utopia, but simply a better alternative than the current \nsystems we have. TED is an example of something that once it has a network \neffect, is hard to destroy. TED could really be a platform where people \ncould be able to get the necessary funding to do the dirty work, but \ninstead all the money is going to the Tony Robbins of the world, that do \nabsolutely nothing but inspire pie in the sky thinking. I know some folks \nlove to dream Utopian worlds, but as for me I could careless. I want \nsolutions that work in the real world. Bitcoin as it is today, already \nsolves all my problems, and if anyone takes the time to learn it a bit more \n(yes its complicated, get over it). Anything in life that is worth it, is \nworth reading over it. Sure it might be a huge stumbling block for many, no \ndoubt. TCP/IP and the internet was difficult and hard to build the \napplications that never stopped anyone from using it. At the end of the \nday, something with real utility rarely gets the attention it should, while \ncrappy stuff sold in a golden box is sold as revolutionary. Go figure... IN \nan effort to \"think outside of the box\" we are still thinking inside of \nthat box. Its funny, but all those supposed innovation is more of the same \njunk. Did the internet succeed and changed the life of those who have \naccess to the information. Yes, is the work over? No, but the point is that \nwe will solve the problem, despite the con artists/TED pie in the sky \ntalkers. We could solve it quicker, if the right people are compensated. \nInstead of wasting time energy, efforts, on a bunch of con artists selling \npipe dreams.",

                    "text": "Fine, yes. It's in their mission statement that ideas have the power to \nchange the world. You got me.\n\nI don't hold TED on a pedestal, however, don't put words in my mouth. I \ncalled this talk out as being an idiotic and assholish rant not because I \nwish to defend TED but because the rant is idiotic and the ranter is an \nasshole. Apparently very few people can see the fallacies that saturate \nthis talk, so allow me to enumerate them:\n\n\"Have you ever wondered why so little of the bright futures promised in TED \ntalks actually come true?\"\n\nNo. I haven't. You know why? Because I know that discussing ideas about how \nto change the world is very different to actually changing the world. I \nknow that actually changing the world is a very difficult thing to do, so \nmany of the ideas discussed will ultimately fail. I also know that many TED \ntalks are not about promising a bright future. Some are about music, art \nand entertainment (you know, the 'E' in TED). Some are about discoveries. \nSome are about the problems we face. I also know that many past TED talks \nhave actually come to fruition and changed the world.\n\n\"My TED talk is not about my work\"\n\nThat's a great lie. His talk is almost word-for-word a recitation of an \narticle he wrote called, \"Why TED is a recipe for Civilizational Disaster\". \nThis talk is no different then when Malcolm Gladwell paraphrases what his \nlatest book is about.\n\n\"The first problem is oversimplification. Now, to be clear I have nothing \nagainst the idea of interesting people who do smart things explaining their \nwork in a way that everyone can understand\"\n\nReally? That's interesting because he then goes on to recite an anecdote \nwhere some idiot demands that an astrophysicist explain his work like \nMalcolm Gladwell, but instead of slamming that particular individual as \nbeing one of the many idiots that inhabit this planet, he slams Malcolm \nGladwell who's very job description is \"explain the work of interesting \npeople who do smart things in a way that everyone can understand\". This \nshould be the very first hint that Mr. Bratton is completely full of shit. \nWhat does he even mean by \"a journalist who recycles fake insights\"? Are \nthey recycled because Gladwell didn't conduct the experiments himself? How \nare the insights 'fake'. Let's go on. Maybe Mr. Bratton will explain why he \nresorts to petty name-calling hidden behind flowery language...\n\n\"This is not popularization. This is taking something with substance and \nvalue and coring it out so that it can be swallowed without chewing.\"\n\nThat's just a flowery, cynical description of paraphrasing. Apparently Mr. \nBratton thinks paraphrasing will bring about the downfall of civilization. \nLet's hear him explain why.\n\n\"TED is a proposition. One that says, 'if we talk about world changing \nideas enough then the world will change'\"\n\nWow. I thought this guy was against paraphrasing and 'oversimplification'. \nApparently when it serves the purpose of building a shitty straw man, it's \nOK. I thought he was OK with the goal of letting experts share their ideas \nwith the public, but now it sounds like doing so could end all of \nCivilization. I'm still unclear on how that works, so let's listen on.\n\n\"TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. To me, TED stands \nfor middle-brow, mega-church, infotainment.\"\n\nMore petty name-calling wrapped in hyperbolically cynical language.\n\n\"The key rhetorical device of any TED talk is a combination of epiphany and \npersonal testimony.\"\n\nI can think of dozens of TED talks that don't follow this stereotype (or is \nit an 'oversimplification'), however, if you're going to explain an idea to \npeople, it often helps to relate how you arrived at said idea which often \nreads as personal testimony leading to epiphany. So what's wrong with that?\n\n\"What does the TED audience hope to get from this. A vicarious insight. A \nfleeting moment of wonder. A sense that it's all going to work out after \nall. A spiritual buzz.\"\n\nHere is the set-up to his main argument. A wonderful stereotype of the TED \naudience as a gaggle mindless dullards. Another straw man. Apparently the \nTED audience isn't made up of individuals with their own reasons for \nwatching TED talks. He's enumerated all the possible reasons. I must just \nwatch TED for the spiritual buzz it gives me. Right. What's his evidence \nfor this so far? He once heard an idiot mention Malcolm Gladwell.\n\n\"Well I'm sorry, but that's not up to the challenge of the problems that we \nare ostensibly here to face. Their complex and difficult and not given to \ntidy, just-so solutions. \"\n\nOK. So the goal of 'facilitating the spread of ideas in hopes of bringing \nabout change in the world' has now become 'solve all of the world's \nproblems' and Mr. Bratton is upset because TED is not enough to solve all \nthe world's problems. Is his complaint \"TED is horrible because it won't \nfix the world\"?\n\n\"[the world's problems] are complex and difficult and not given to tidy, \njust-so solutions. They don't care about anyone's experience of optimism.\"\n\nAh, so the real problem goes back to the dummy audience who apparently is \njust in it for the high and doesn't realize there's more to solving \nproblems than just talking about solutions. Stupid audience. What a bunch \nof dummies.\n\n\"Given the stakes, having our best and brightest waste their time and the \naudiences time dancing about like infomercial hosts is too high a price. \nAnd it's cynical\"\n\nSharing ideas in a paraphrased manner is a huge waste of time? Apparently \nif I go to someone with an interesting idea and say, \"do you want to share \nyour thoughts in a concise talk.\" I'm actually asking them to dance about \nlike an infomercial host. Mr. Bratton laughably uses the word 'cynical' to \ndescribe such an act while he himself apparently loves hyperbolic cynicism.\n\n\"Plus it just doesn't work. [tangent about TED discouraging science-woo]. \nThe corollary to placebo science and medicine is placebo politics and \nplacebo innovation, and on this count TED has a ways to go. [gives Konny \n2012 as an example]. You see, when inspiration becomes manipulation, \ninspiration becomes obfuscation. And if you're not cynical, you should be \nskeptical.\"\n\nThis is not an example of TED not working. This is an example of why people \nshould approach new information with skepticism, because TED, like all \nother forums of discussion, is not perfect. So, the real take away of the \nKonny 2012 anecdote is not that TED is fundamentally harmful to society, \nbut that accepting information without critical thinking is a bad idea. \nThat has nothing to do with TED. The only way Mr. Bratton has so far tied \nthat lesson to TED is by building a straw man of both TED and the TED \naudience.\n\n\"Technology: We're told that not only is change accelerating, but the pace \nof change is accelerating. In terms of the computational capacity, this is \ntrue. But at the same time, (and in-fact the two are related) we're at a \nmoment of cultural deceleration. We invest our energies in futuristic \ninformation technology including our cars, yet we drive them home kitch \narchitecture copied from the 18th century.\n\nThe future on offer is one in-which everything can change as long as \neverything stays the same. We'll have google glass but we'll still have \nbusiness casual. \n \nThis timidity is not our path to the future. This is incredibly \nconservative and more gigaflops will not inoculate us because if a problem \nis endemic to the system then the exponential effects of moors law also \namplify the problems. It's more computation along the wrong curve.\"\n\nNo single person or even group of people can offer what Mr. Bratton demands \nof Technology-oriented TED talks. A complete vision of the future including \nall of the social, artistic, and technological changes in one cohesive \nview. Is it surprising that one person talks about the single aspect of \ntechnology that they are focused on and another talks about the work that \nthey are doing without also talking about how 'business casual' and \narchitecture will change. There's a reason society follows the 'timid' \ntrajectory and it's endemic to our limitations as a species. Our inability \nto track every social, political, and technological implication of every \npossible change in trajectory. Moors law is featured in some tech-oriented \nTED talks, but there are plenty that don't. There are plenty that talk \nabout changes in architecture and society that must take place.\n\nI'm bored analyzing this shitty talk. He's mad at TED for not being \nsomething it never purports to be and for his stereotype of the audience \nbeing so stereotypical.",

I think TED (and TED(x) should be able to be \nlooked at with a critical eye, and I think Benjamin Bratton was spot on \nwith many of his points. People pay a lot of money to attend / support TED, \nand deserve a lot of value from the non-profit.\n\nMany presenters don't do it, but perhaps they could refer people to URLs \netc. to more detailed items that they cover during their talks, and add \nvalue to what they are saying during their brief lectures. Often TED just \ncomes across for many as an ego-boosting opportunity of narcissistic \nproportions, and does deliver the Reader's Digest version of science to \nmany, which you could pick up in 5 minutes watching a PBS special or \nsimilar. This is where TED falls down a bit.\n\nYou can attend a Maker-space for example, or a private user/interest-group, \nand get very similar talks for free. That has been happening since forever. \nTED needs to refine the quality of the presentations a bit, and add value, \nI think that is all that he is asking for here. Most of all, TED should not \nbe above critical discussion, and acknowleged for what it does and does not \ndeliver to a mass-audience.",

Epcot is the most \n\"toe-dip-in-the-waters-of-tech for the public at large\" I can think \nof---much more so than TED.\n\nPublic relations vehicles like TED have been around for centuries. So what? \nHave they held us back? Nah. Not any more than religion or materialism or \n(insert your favorite soapbox platform here). And make no mistake, TED is a \npublic relations vehicle for science, technology, new ideas, etc ... Case \nin point, this speaker himself uses it for -- ta da! -- public relations.\n\nThis speaker reduced some concepts like \"systems\" and egalitarianism to \npablum (which I thought he was against) and padded his lecture with them.\n\nI liked the Tony Robbins line and Malcolm Gladwell story, but this speaker \ncomes off like the dad in Dirty Dancing. Using the example of Kony2012, \nhe's misinterpreting the significance of TED in the system and attempting \nto lead us to do the same.\n\nThere are plenty of avenues for those inclined to hold deeper conversations \nabout their passions and lifes' work.

As \nfar as entertainment goes, TED is pretty great. As far as world-changing \ngoes, TED is pretty limited, but so is pretty much everything humanity has \never tried. I've yet to see humanity as a whole solve a complicated, \nmorally ambiguous problem at all. I would love to see an example of a high \nlevel problem involving agreements between government and the private \nsector that didn't involve compromises that were cynically and corruptly \narrived at. Most of the solutions to problems like these end up with the \npeople who care the most about them being to sick to their stomachs about \nwhat needed to be given up to reach a middle ground at all. So why should \nTED be the magic bullet that didn't exist before TED? Why should we expect \nTED to be more than it is and something it's not? And in the meantime, why \ncan't we just enjoy TED for what it is? There are certainly many worse, and \nmany more cynical things we could be paying attention to and giving our \nmoney to.",

Given that this does not create actual Big Change, it is \nbest categorized as self-delusion.\n\nThe real problem is what the speaker points out early in the presentation: \nthis ineffective approach makes it harder for those who are \nproductively engaged in discovery and problem solving: they get measured \nnot by actual results but by how well they match up to the entirely bogus \nexpectations of inspirational presentation skills.\n\nIt is one thing for society to conserve the status quo and, as a \nby-product, create friction for the innovator (this is arguably quite a \ngood thing as it creates selective pressure on innovation while holding on \nto that which is already proven to work to some acceptable degree) but it \nis entirely another thing for society to attack the founts of progress by \nerecting false idols of intellect in their place.\n\nIt may be less personally glamorous, but it is far more useful and \npersonally effective to support the true innovators and profound thinkers \nin their arduous and difficult tasks than to pretend the mantle of \ninnovation with one's own hollow rhetoric.\ufeff",

Acknowledging it when we see it in the mirror \nheld up for us can lead us away from that way of being.\n\nI'm sure that wasn't inspiring in the least, but if you actually hold on to \nthat idea and try it out I bet you'll get more from it than all the TED \ntalks you've watched combined.",

Its a semantic \nargument, so no that does not resonate with me.  And i wouldnt accept how \nit can bring about social change at all.\nIMO propping up a semantic argument as though it holds the power to sway \nsocietal change, and TED does not,  is where the ego lies in this comment \nsection. \n\nIts a very grammar nazi methodology of thought.

You wanna know how to rid the world of \nthat?  Get rid of money.  That doesnt lead us to anything but that is a 1 \nsentence answer that will solve the problem.  But no one will do that so no \nreal point in discussing it.  Because a change in how man perceives reality \nis required.  Many hold money in dogmatic fashion.\n\nThat may not seem feasible to you, yet it is the ONLY answer to the \nproblem.  WE could debate it all day, but if money exists, poverty exists.  \nAnd nothing will change until mankind realizes our potential.  Potential \npeople are trying to explain to others via TED and other mediums.\n\nMy arguement is that the OP and the speaker are doing much worse for the \nflow of information than TED is.  They make things overly complex for the \nsake of complexity.  Saying not everything is simple, but in return making \nthings unnecessarily complex becuase in their eyes good info should be hard \nto come by.  But thats not how it works.   If i can say something in 1 \nsentence i shouldnt write a paragraph.  To bring about change?  How does \none do that if other people dont know what the hell youre saying because \nyou make it complex just for the sake of sounding smart. \n\nYou cannot complain about TED not addressing the real issues, then say some \nbig worded ambiguous bullshit that doesnt help anyone, that 38% of the \npeople didnt even understand.  Theyre thinking \"bring up the next guy.\"  I \nmean are you patting yourself on the back?  BEcause youve done nothing but \nexactly what TED does.  Just state your opinion.

Its not a building that we can reconfigure to \nsuit our opinion.  \n\nAnd i mean why didnt the speaker bring up thiese big issues and ways to \nsolve them?  Thats my point.\n\nDont speak with big words and be a hypocrite.  Thats what the speaker and \nthe OP are doing. Criticizing a medium trying to do something saying it \ndoes nothing, but doing nothing at all while they are speaking about it.  \nNo matter how intelligent they sound, theyve added absolutely nothing, and \nTED is at least trying to add something.

With \nthat concession out of the way, I will put forth what I said before: not \nthat the speaker is opposed to TED, but believes it deserves a kind of \nauditing of purpose. \n\nAnd as I said before, I personally am not totally opposed to an \ninspirational angle to TED talks. Its nice. Makes me feel warm and like \nwe're all capable of doing good things for each other. \n\nHe's asserting that TED is slightly missing the plot on some the largest \nworld issues, issues LIKE: the poverty gap; rape as a weapon of war; the \ngrowing discrepancy between populations with access to communication \ntechnologies and those that don't...\n\nAnd that also not *all* technology is necessary, appropriate, or well \nexplored. He has high hopes for TED's purpose. It can still be accessible \n*and* more relevant. As it is in his eyes, and indeed in mine (and indeed, \nas a fan of the conference) TED can seem sort of tone deaf, or at least out \nof touch. It all seems well and good, but a lot of it doesn't seem \nfeasible. \n\nI understand how it works though, because I like you, believe in a kind of \nnatural selection of ideas: that those ideas with the most utility and \ntruth tend to resonate, and therefore it's always advisable to talk and \ndebate about ideas.\n\nYour argument, and I'm more than glad to be wrong about this, seems mostly \nsteeped in what seems like a distaste for inaccessible language, from what \nI'm reading, veiled accusations regarding the intelligence of your \nopponents.\n\nFurthermore, I'm failing to see what the argued point is, because though we \ndisagree on the subject, the disagreement is nearly negligible and boils \ndown to: You think TED is fine just the way it is, we see room for \nimprovement.\n\nWhy is this worth such vicious opposition?",

Any system that \nis set up to make the profit margin as wide as TED's appears to be is a \nsystem that is automatically not created \"for the people\" and therefore, \nlacking egalitarianism, is doomed to failure, since the ideas contained \nwithin are intended for a very small audience (proportionally speaking). \nPerhaps the *real* reason TED ideas echo in a chamber is that they are not \nfreely distributed. If TED wants to enact *real* change in the world, they \nshould consider allowing anyone and everyone to attend their conferences. \nYou can't enact systemic change if only the top echelon have access to the \ninformation in question. These 10 minute youtubes and 'free' access on \ntheir website do not count; systemic change requires more commitment than \nsimply plugging in for a few minutes and walking away with one new piece of \ninfotainment. \ufeff",

Perceiving fake \nnostalgia toward an era that you neither saw nor experienced as superior to \nthe shallow here-and-now worldview of pop culture.\n\nTo put it simply, you don't know the first thing about how the 20s actually \nwere. For all you know, the perspective you gained through literature \n(which is mostly fiction anyway) was constructed on the old timey \nequivalent of 'Cribs'. Attempting to make qualitative judgements by \ncomparing the old in the context of the new is a logical fallacy and one of \nthe points of this talk.\n \nThe reality is, your 'insight' is nothing but a common example of liberal \nconservatism. That your pseudo-intellectual scope of the world is not your \nown but a third-hand regurgitation of somebody else's experiences that \nhappened long before you were born. Ie the facebook highlight reel of \nhistory. \n\nThe fact is, our society and education system actively reinforces and \nlegitimizes a culture of liberal conservatism. As if emulating/copying the \npast successes of others is a surefire path to success. Literature is \npreached through the eyes of Hemingway, architecture on the renaissance, \npolitics on ancient Greece, economics from the post-depression era, etc... \nAll of it is convergent rhetoric dressed up as creativity.\n\nThere will always be a culture of divergent thinkers in our society. People \nwho reject the notion that originality is nothing more than the rehashing \nof old ideas. People who spend their everyday lives inventing new ideas and \nseeking a deeper understanding via trial and error.\n\nSadly, legitimization is currently membership based. You have to have to \nhave a PHD before you're allowed to have an original idea in college. Wear \nthick rimmed glasses and have a shaved head to be taken seriously as a \njournalist. Have a strange voice or style to be recognized as a musician. \nAnd on and on.\n\nIt all comes down to one simple question. If you ask yourself honestly, \nwhen was the last time you had a truly original idea? Are you afraid of \nbeing wrong and, if so, at what point of your life did that fear manifest?",

They \ndon't realize that language simply veils an interest, if a conservative \ntalks of \"protecting the family\", does it actually mean that?

And the reason for this is because while \nLiberal thinkers may have espoused such rhetoric, it has never reflected \nthe reality of Liberalism's existence, namely, as a political-ideological \nsummation of the interests of the bourgeois class. What seperated \ncapitalism (and liberalism) from feudalism (and therefore, religious \nideology) politically was political equiality for everyone, no longer was \nthere higher born or lowerborn, aristocratic, etc. A rich man could walk \nthe same street as a poor man, and, on paper, all citizens were equal \nbefore the law. But this is only a formal equality, and therefore, a formal \nfreedom. What remained is social inequality, and I do not mean with regard \nto income, I mean with regard to their relation to the mode of production, \nthe retention, or the further existence of property relations made equality \nmeaningless. So, politically, (as opposed to the feudalism before it) do \nliberal democracies have a division of power? Politically yes, but it's \nmeaningless because the social basis from which liberalism survives and \npervades prerequisites the \"ABSOLUTE POWER\" of the ruling class, as in any \nother mode of production. Liberalism is a component of the bourgeois state, \nand thus serves for their complete class dictatorship. It is why the \nideologues of liberalism claim we are \"striving from true liberalism\" when \nthe state exercises authoritarian, or violent behavior. They don't \nunderstand that the very basis of liberalism gives way to the basis for \nthose acts to exist, liberalism is the mystified veil which hides the true \nviolent and oppressive nature of the bourgeois state. It's why all other \nideological projections of capitalist production, Fascism, Stalinism, etc. \nare so terrifying, it's because they espouse the real barbarism of \ncapitalism. ",
