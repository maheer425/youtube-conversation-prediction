It is not a mistake if you \nknowingly do stupid shit which could very obviously come back to bite you. \nFor example, it was not a \"mistake\" when Justin Bieber peed in a mop bucket \nin that kitchen. He knew what he was doing, he knew it was illegal, he knew \nwhat would happen if somebody recorded it (which they did), and then he \nescaped punishment by claiming \"it was a mistake.\" No, that was not a \nmistake.\n\nAnd willingly getting drunk does not excuse any actions you do while drunk. \nTake responsibility as you allowed yourself to get into a state of \nintoxication in which you ought to know you do regrettable things. Its this \nreason we don't forgive drunk drivers, they must take responsibility for \ntheir actions, even if their actions were not that of a sober person. A \nmistake is not an acceptable excuse. \n\nIf you want to call that a mistake, fine. But they must learn from it. But \nthat should not change the fact that you must face the consequences. No \n\"easing\" up because you \"made a mistake.\" No sympathy. I am basically \nsaying I am sick of people doing stupid shit and then thinking they can get \nsympathy or escape judgement by calling it a \"mistake.\" Like, a mistake is \nan error in judgement. If you don't want the consequence (eg getting \npregnant), and you know an act (eg drinking excessively) has a foreseeably \nhigh chance of receiving that consequence (eg having sex while drunk is \nquite common), yet you choose to do the act anyway (drink to excess), you \nhave not made an error in judgement. Unless you didn't see the link between \ndrinking and pregnancy, unlikely, only then would it reasonably be called a \nmistake, as its an error in judgement because you didn't realise that the \nact (ie drinking) would likely lead to the consequence (pregnancy). And I'm \nreferring to pregnancy as the consequence as the outcome, and assuming it \nwas not planned. ",

Maybe is his quadrature and Heron's Engine \nwere considered together, there might have been an advance. But one event \ndoes not lead to a leap in human being. Calculus helped us understand the \nheavens, but it took further developments to understand thermodynamics, \nelectrodynamics, continuum dynamics, etc. and how to apply what we learned. \nArchimedes was brilliant, but I doubt his pseudo-development of \"calculus\" \nwould have changed the world.\ufeff",

It's easier for us to cast blame on one person but that often is \nnot the case where armies or governments have done horrible things.

What came as a direct result of calculus? \nNo social changes, that's for sure. Perhaps it would have made Columbus a \nlittle more perceptive of how big around the earth was, but probably not. \nWe would probably have more interesting architecture, which would be a feat \nconsidering how interesting it is now. But I think overall, we'd be in \nabout the same place. Unfortunately science travels at an exponential pace. \nYou need more pieces in place in order to make it go faster. The more \nknowledge you gain, the more you have the potential to gain. One discovery \n- which he said was merely the groundwork, not the finished product - would \nnot be enough to cause a huge change. It might be enough to put us a decade \nahead. And even then, it's hard to say what that means. \n\nReally the problem is that there are too many variables. No way to know \nwhat could have been. ",

In other words, there may be multiple causal pathways \nthat can lead to a given effect.  Also, it is virtually impossible to prove \nthat such pathways would not have occurred in other circumstances.\n    As another example, this error is almost always made regarding \ngovernment regulation.  Just because the government regulated something \n(such as air quality) and air quality improved, people say \"if the gov. \nhadn't passed the Clean Air Act then we'd still be breathing 1970s levels \nof smog and having our buildings eroded by acid rain.\"\n    This statement implies that the only way the problem of air pollution \ncould ever have been addressed, was via government regulation.  This is \nfalse.  There are myriad ways that people in society could have dealt with \nair pollution resulting in a constructive outcome, other than by government \nregulation.\n    In the case of WWII, there was enormous loss of human life, coercion of \npeople into roles which they would not have otherwise chosen, as well as \nincalculable capital destruction and loss of opporunity costs.  Like the \nbroken window fallacy, if you take your argument to its extreme, then if \nWWII would have never ended and just kept getting worse, we should have \nachieved immortality and the end of poverty for all by now.\n    Yet that is a contradiction, because war means death and destruction of \nwealth, which means less to go around and be produced, so something is \nwrong with the argument.\nIn fact, it is likely that the so aforementioned positive outcomes of WWII \nwould have been dwarfed by even more substantial rates of progress in \nmedicine, science, and technology (with much less human suffering to \nachieve them) if WWII had never occurred at all.",

I can't understand why would \nyou believe crap like that, so do your research.\n\nWhat you mention about the ark is exactly what I'm talking about. You \nintroduce a bunch of \"MAYBES\" into the ark story, like: \"Ohhh, maybe not \nALL species of animals where in there\", and then go and say: \"See? The ark \naccount doesn't contradict science!!!\". Thing is, you need to provice \nEVIDENCE that all those maybes you've introduced are actually valid... \nevidence that I'm sure you don't have.\n\nSomething being old doesn't discredit it from being accurate; it's \ncomparison with modern theories and evidence that decides that.\n\nI could say that the shintoist account of the creation of the earth, where \none of the gods shakes salt in the sea with a massive spear to form the \ncontinents, it totally up to par with modern theories in geology that \ndescribe how the earth was formed. All I have to do is take an event in the \nfolklore, compare it with event in the scientific theory, see if they are \nkind-of-sort-of-similar, and then fit them together!\n\nThat's what you do when you say religion doesn't contradict science.

So \nright there I can just call that you are recycling common arguments that \nyou don't understand yourself. Something is not proven wrong because it is \nold, that is a logical fallacy. For example, calculus is old as well and it \nworks just fine.\n\nThe 6000-year-old theory is the opinion of some people, myself not \nincluded, who choose to ignore very convincing scientific findings. The \nflat earth claim is also wrong, in fact in the book Job it says that the \nearth is spherical and \"hangs on nothing.\" As for the ark, I think that \npart of the bible perhaps could *help support evolution.* Of course every \nsingle deviation of every single species couldn't fit on a boat that size. \nBut a sample of most parts of the animal kingdom might. I can't say that I \ncan explain everything, but you know neither can science explain where the \nbig bang came from.\n\nSecond, I really don't want to start the whole bible vs. science debate in \nthe comments section here. Again, my whole point is that science and \nreligion really don't need to be seen as two contradicting entities. I \nexplained what I could without being provocative, and I would appreciate \nleaving it at that with our differing opinions.

The way I see it, there \nwill always be two reasons/ways to unite: resources and land. In instances \nlike WW2, there will be a small varying number of reasons to unite, such as \nto take down a tyrant like you're suggesting. \n\nI do agree, however, that people like Hitler are crucial to our history to \nhelp us learn from it.\n\nTl;dr: Basically, I don't think there are many reasons to unite to start \nwith (by this I mean nations won't unite unless there's something to gain \nfrom it), so I disagree in that, in any sort of case, there aren't many \nreasons to start with.

But it so happens that history is not built around CHARACTERS. \nWell, not as much as we tend to believe. Rather, it is built around \nPRINCIPLES, TENDENCIES, and CONTEXTS. A country with deep economic \ntroubles, hyperinflation, and lots of resentment, is almost certain to \nproduce a dictator. And dictatorship is almost certain to rely on finding \ninternal and external \"enemies\" to justify the current troubles.\n\nMy point is: even if, by some super-dooper-lucky chance Hitler had been \nkilled, there were plenty of people to replace him in that political \ncontext. Just look at Hitler's immediate surrounding. \n\nAnd have you considered the possibility that we might, in fact, be \nextremely lucky? That someone, a person who could have become an even more \nterrifying figure in history, more talented and successful leader than \nHitler, a person who could have won WW II for Nazi Germany, was actually \nkilled in WW I? And Hitler was, if you please, only a second \"best\"? How \nabout this?\ufeff",

Germanys people might have accepted a dictatorship with \nanother leader (like italy or russia), but it most likely wouldn't have \nlead to a war of this extent. I wouldn't say that the people at that time \nwere especially to keen to attack all its surrounding countries and kill \njews, however im neither a historian nor have lived back then. It were \npartly the convincing and empowering speeches of their leader. I'm not \ntrying to justify ww2 or unburden the germans at that time, but I think \nthat Hitler had very big influence in the way the people thought. He used \ntheir general unhappiness with the outcome of ww1 to turn them against jews \nand other nations and accept war as something honorable. Also without \nHitler as leader some extreme decisions wouldn't have been made, because a \ndifferent leader would've been more humane. This might have changed the \noutcome or even the start of ww2 in both ways. I'm pretty sure though, that \nHitler has not done all by himself. He was the face that was needed to \nconvince a nation, but Goebbels who wrote his speeches, his assistants and \nofficers did most of the crucial job for planning the leadership and the \nwar. So the question whether it would've came to ww2 without Hitler is \ntricky, and no one will ever be able to answer it.",

Period!\n\nPeace out.\n\n*EDIT:* Why is there a translate option next to my comment? It is in 100% \nEnglish LOL. Freaking Google! xD\ufeff",

For example, when he \nchanged his targets for the aerial fights in the UK to civilian, he caused \nmore deaths but those deaths weren't so useful, since he ceased bombing \nactual military installations.\n\nWhen he had soldiers stay back from Normandy, thinking there was going to \nbe an attack elsewhere, he made it easier for the Normandy invasion to be \nsuccessful due to fewer troops to hold back the assault.\n\nAnd most importantly, when he chose to turn on the USSR, he created the \nsame problem that killed the Central Powers of WW1. A war on two fronts, \nand even when he was successfully fighting the Russians he took a page from \nNapoleon's book of \"how not to invade Russia\" and got caught in the \nwintertime.\n\nMy personal thoughts are that the Nazis would've still rose to power, Still \nwould've attacked the rest of the world, and still would've attacked in \nblitzkrieg style. However, they could've had a more competent leader, and \nthat could've spelled much more doom and death upon the world, whether they \nwon or lost.",

We would have never had Greek temples to the \ngods and never would have possibly never would have had the Roman Empire.\n\n Christianity does have its problems and the Catholic church is plagued by \nthem,(trust me i'm baptist) but blaming them would be like blaming the \nRomans for destroying countless of middle eastern cities before \nChristianity.",
