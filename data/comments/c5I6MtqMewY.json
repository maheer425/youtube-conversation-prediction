Only 1st top tower destroyed (actaully, denied).\n\n There are things that I just had to made up, like in this episode when \nenigma and phoenix ulti who gets wich kill and wich assist, or when terror \nkills juggernaut in the jungle if phoenix actually killed or not rubick, \nbut i think it's pretty accurate.\ufeff",

That's the \nbiggest problem to Medu, imo. She has to either go for damage items (crit, \nmaelstrom,etc.), which then will reduce her survivality, or go for \ndefensive items (linken, most of the time) and therefore lack the needed \ndamage output. TB is a much more straightforward in item choice, since Meta \n+ illus give him insane damage dps. I agree with you that TB has big \ntrouble with nukes and disable, but that fact can apply for almost 90% \nheroes, right :) ? Medu wont fight the enemies alone, even with her ult up \n(and Medu is obviously not strong in 1v1, she shines in 5v5 clash), so does \nTB.

His strength growth is low, but not the lowest in the game, and \nthe high base armor can more or less make up for it (still vulnerable to \nheavy nukes, but lets face it, almost all agi carries have the same \nproblem).
