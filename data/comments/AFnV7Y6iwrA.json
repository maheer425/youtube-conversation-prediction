Let me be your 2PM guide girl ~\n\nJun.K : aka crazy daegu granpa, super hyper despite being the oldest member \nof the group, funny and likable, arguable the weirdest yet nicest. He \ncomposes and his voice is gold, he's the main singer. Just full of talent \nbut is super underrated :'(\n\nTaecyeon : aka Taec / OKTROLL / He's considered very manly but fans know \nhe's really just a huge dork. Likes to troll the other members and staff. \nHe's CEO to OkCat ( A cute little green cat franchise that he created and \ndesigned ) Has big ears and teeth but still hot. :B He's the groups main \nrapper. 3rd oldest. \n\nNichkhun : Khun . Thai prince. He's thai and just a sweetheart. He's \nconsidered the visual of the group and still/used to be immensely popular \nwithin kpop and the hallyu wave because of his good looks. Like SNSD's \nYoona, he's the equivalent. Second oldest. \n\nJunho : Hobutt. Hands down without a doubt has the biggest butt in the kpop \nscene. Look up hobutt, you'll see why. He's known for his charming eye \nsmile and talent. Can both sing and dance well, as well as do acrobatics. ( \nThough all of 2PM was trained in tumbling and acrobatics, ) The boy is just \nseriously talented. 2nd youngest\n\nChansung : Giant Maknae / youngest member, People often mistake him for the \noldest because he's huge. He has a long waist and likes to take his shirt \noff at concerts a lot, lol. He's also a huge dork like Taec. He loves \nBananas and animals. Has the most contagious laugh, he looks so dumb when \nhe laughs, but that's why we love him :')\n\nWooyoung : Woodong/Toshio/ Fake maknae. People often mistake him for the \nyoungest. Like Junho, he can both sing and dance very well, his voice is \nlike a beautiful whisper. He was often treated like the baby of the group \nback in the day. He's also a ssanti king, just look up his ssanti videos, \nhim dancing to single ladies = gold. He's the visual dancer of the group ( \nhim and Junho are the best dancers, just different styles ) He's just \noverall adorable. ( My ultimate bias :') ) \n\nJay Park : :'( ex-leadja / aka old pink grandpa. Originally the oldest \nmember of the group and leader, wasn't afraid of wearing pink. Ridiculously \ntalented, he could sing, rap, bboy and do acrobatics. He's pretty wild and \nfunny, was closest to Taecyeon and Wooyoung. He used to be the craziest \ntoo, I suggest you atleast watch one episode of WILD BUNNY, it was 2PM's \nreality TV show back when Jay was still with them, it was also the most \npopular reality group show back in the day. Everyone watched it, it won't \nfail to make you laugh. Anyway, he kinda has his own company now and is \ndoing his own thing as a solo artist, all of his music is seriously good. \nSometimes I'm sad he had to leave 2PM, but also happy, because then I \nwouldn't be able to listen to his amazing solo music today. \n\nAnd there you have it. I hope you enjoy the concert at Rosemont knowing a \nlittle more about each member :') ",
