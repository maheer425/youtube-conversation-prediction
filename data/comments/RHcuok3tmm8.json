                    "text": "+Mohd Akmal I might be a bit late on the answer but I can try to answer \nyour questions. \n\n\n\n\n1. Cats are nocturnal animals, they hunt during the night and sleep during \nthe day, that's nothing special just nature.\n2. I don't entirely understand this question, since its more a fact about \nthe cat then its a question. \n3. The belly is an area the cat is really protective over, its the most \nvulnerable place on the body so it is afraid that someone could attack him \nthere. Just don't touch the cats belly since most cats don't like that.\n4. You should just feed him things cat normally eat, give him cat food and \nmaybe some Tuna every now and then. Its not dangerous if it eats something \nlike bread and things like that but try to refrain from giving it food that \nthey normally wouldn't eat if they lived in the wild. (except for cat food) \nP.S Never give them milk. \n5. He/she might be a bit insecure meting new people since he/she doesn't \nknow who they are and if they could possibly be a threat, I would recommend \nthat the people coming to visit sits down and let the cat come to them if \nhe/she wants to meet them. \n6. Balls can be fast objects and can hurt if they are hit by it, he/she \nmight be scared that the ball might injure him/her if it goes with high \nspeed towards him/her so just don't use balls as toys. \n7. Keep litter boxes in areas you might spend a lot of time, you never know \nif the cat might pee on something because he/she wants to mingle his smell \nwith yours, also make sure you have places high up so he/she can be to look \ndown on things, since the cat prefers being high up. \n8. Unless the litter box is closed off and its like a room then the shape \nshouldn't be a problem, make sure that its an open litter box and not a \nlittle room. \n9. Cats are territorial creatures, so if there are cats in the area they \nwill probably fight since they fight over who is the owner of the \nterritory. The other cat wont kill your cat, that is highly unlikely and if \nthe cat is older then yours its most likely that its stronger and that is \nwhy your cat can't really do anything against it. Just make sure that if \nsomething serious happens that you notify the owners of the other cat and \nthat you take your cat to a vet. \n10. Not really a question like number 2, its more of a fact about your cat.",

In the \nend one will continue to play, while the other will walk away and just \nobserve from a distance :( Is this because cats have some \"play etiquette\" \nthat I don't understand? Would appreciate your advice. \ufeff",

I \nplay with one until she's exhausted, then the other cat takes over.  Cats \nhave short top energy spans so have a little breather every ten minutes or \nso, works well for them.  I verbally engage the observer to let him/her \nknow it's their turn next.  If one cat really doesn't want to share, I take \ntwo toys.  Both cats have different favourite toys, so that helps.  \nSometimes they make etiguette mistakes, both jump out at the same time, but \nit doesn't end up in a fight.  Hope this helps you.

Now your cat's kittens all died prematurely, and \nshe is still in the maternity mode, it may explains why she is following \nyou around. Many cats think of their owners as their family members, that's \nwhy they bring home their kills as their way of saying they're trying to \ntake care of you. There are many examples of cats whom had lost their \nlitters prematurely, and ended up being seregate mothers to other species \nof animals such as puppies.  Now back to your cat su su, her situation will \nremedy it self with time, once her natural needs to care for her  kittens \nwear off. In the mean time, try to spend more time with her, It may bond \nyou and her closer. Get her fixed will also help. Plus if you don't get her \nfixed soon, she is going to have another litter of kittens.",

Whenever I go in \nthere. She immediately runs after me most of the time and stays there until \nI leave. (Maybe because I put her food in there along with her litter box \nand she's trying to protect it. Or because she just likes to see the toilet \nflush. XD)\nShe's a Wallflower cat when my dog goes full-on attack mode though. No, not \ntrying to eat her (although he has kind of swallowed her head. He never \nbites down though.), he's playing with her. But she gets a little scared \nand quickly runs under the bed and hides~.\n\n(Also no, I didn't name my cat J\u00e4ger after the liquor, but because it means \nHunter in German. And wow, does she like to hunt small plastic things for \nsome reason....)\ufeff",
