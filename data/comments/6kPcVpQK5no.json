It is the only constraint that is necessary and should \nbe allowed. Anything beyond that is the product of fallible individuals \n attempting to impose their will on others to gain their percieved needs \nwhether of safety or pleasure. This is unacceptable aggression against \nother individuals.\nThe Constitution, from the beginning, was designed to take freedom, \nprimarily from the states which until that time could be considered \nseperate countries and were busy quarreling with each other. When you take \nfreedom from the states, you also take freedom from the individuals within \nthose states. Todays states are little more than puppets of the federal \ngovernment. The majority of their funding for the things they do comes from \nthe federal government. Perhaps, the fight should be in each state to \nget FEDERAL money out of state government.\nI would finish with these thoughts. A Constitution is the controling \ndocument of a corporation. Its foundation, so to speak. Thus all \ngovernments are Corporations. Special types of coporations, but coporations \nnonetheless. They are always interested in the bottom line. Are they not \nalways crying about the same financial terms that every corporation deals \nwith every day? Does not the government treat these coporations as if they \nwere wholely owned subsidaries of itself, taking a part of the profits \n(taxes)? Another reason why personal taxes could be considered a form of \ndouble dipping. So in fighting whatever coporate control of the government \nthere is, are you not limiting the ability of those \"employees\" to fair \nrepresentation.

Chaos, or Entropy, is \none of the basic forces of the universe.  Freedom, and other flavors of \nChaos, can be and almost always are constrained by Order of some kind.  My \nfreedom to do what I will is constrained at a basic level by 1) the pattern \nof my abilities  and 2) the pattern of the reactions of others.  Freedom is \nalways on a continuum.  I am freer in some areas than others, and always \nwill be.\n\nAs for the benefits of hierarchy, hierarchical structures are risky, but \nthey are also very effective.  WolfPAC has a natural endpoint of getting a \nconstitutional convention.   If it starts going beyond that endpoint, I \nwill take a close look at what further ends it is after.  If WolfPAC starts \nusing questionable means for its ends, then I will absolutely speak up.  \nHierarchical systems require vigilant monitoring by the rank and file, and \nneed to maintain enough freedom that the rank and file can act on their \nobservations.\n\nOn to the Constitution.

I do not \ntrust hierarchical structures to successfully perform a task not only due \nto the ease in which they can be corrupted by only a few near the top, but \nalso because hierarchical structures, by nature, have an inclination \ntowards self-preservation that often results in self-sabotage of the \nmission or redefining of the mission to prolong its life. It most often \nrequires an outside force to bring its existance to an end.\nThat said, rather than a long explanation of how anti-freedom the \nConstitution is, I'll simply ask a question. What good will adding more \nwords do, when the document is either ignored or reinterperted by those in \npower to sustain their actions?",
