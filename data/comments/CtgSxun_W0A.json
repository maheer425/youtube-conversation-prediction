I think \nBill Dance Excalibur is the only crank that can cut it for me b/c I'm \ngood...which may or may not be the same thing as the 6th Sense. Go figure. \ufeff",

We can even do trout fishing on the \nKings or crappie fishing in the most notorious Isabella Lake. We can do it \nany lake here from Los Banos to Lake McClure to Pine Flat to Hensley to \nMillerton to Sycamore Island Mendota Wildlife homie. It does not matter to \nme. Call him up. I'll whoop him and film it for you all to see. I kid you \nnot. All KVD lures suck. The only one I like is the KVD Sexy Dawg and I \ndon't even throw that one. I just have it in my tackle so the rich guys get \noff my back...I throw Japs on top like the companies that start with an I \nor N or an L or the M. LOL. Whoa!
