It was \nthe world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital \ncomputer.[1] The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22-bit word \nlength that operated at a clock frequency of about 5\u201310 Hz.[2] Program code \nand data were stored on punched film.\nThe Z3 was completed in Berlin in 1941. The German Aircraft Research \nInstitute used it to perform statistical analyses of wing flutter.[3] Zuse \nasked the German government for funding to replace the relays with fully \nelectronic switches, but funding was denied during World War II since such \ndevelopment was deemed \"not war-important\".[4] The original Z3 was \ndestroyed in 1943 during an Allied bombardment of Berlin. A fully \nfunctioning replica was built in the 1960s by Zuse's company, Zuse KG, and \nis on permanent display in the Deutsches Museum. The Z3 was demonstrated in \n1998 to be, in principle, Turing-complete.[5][6]\nThanks to this machine and its predecessors, Konrad Zuse is often regarded \nas the inventor of the computer.[7][8][9][10]\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)",

I hope this \nhelps, and trust me, the machine is not nearly as complicated as I have \njust made it seem, and I hope this cleared your question up :)",

                    "text": "+utilizator500\nI'm on my Winter Break from my university so I didn't have a chance to get \nto the university libraries until now; so let's get on with it.\n\nTo be short and to the point: Is Typex unbreakable? Absolutely not.\n\nFirst, let's put down the proof that the Typex is actually an Enigma clone:\n\"While the British were busy breaking Enigma traffic, they themselves were \nusing a modified version of the machine, the Typex. The British had been \none of the many countries to purchase commercial Enigmas for study in the \nmid-1920s. Over the next decade this machine was studied and gradually \nstrengthened to the point where British cryptanalysts thought it \nsatisfactory for use. The Typex used five rotors plus a static reflecting \nrotor. The rotor design and ratchet arrangements were copied directly from \nthe Enigma. As with the Enigma, the reflecting rotor was on the left when \nfacing the machine. The two entrance rotors, IV and V, were stators. They \ncould be set initially, but did not move during encipherment. This \narrangement forms a sort of \"variable plug-board\" which altered with each \nmessage. It is but another method of defeating the isomorph attack used \nagainst the commercial Enigma. Rotor III was the fast rotor and drove rotor \nII, which drove rotor I in the usual manner except that the rotor rims were \nmultinotched to provide for frequent rotor movement.\" \u2014 (Deavours and Kruh, \n1985; p. 144)\n\nSo, there's the \"proof in the pudding\" as it were, that Typex was an \nEnigma. I'd provide more quotes about the specifics of the Typex, but \nthat's not important to this discussion.\n\n\nAs to the cryptanalysis of the Typex, this statement should be telling:\n\"Many of the cryptanalytic methods discussed for the Enigma also can be \ncarried out on the Typex which is more or less a fast-stepping Enigma with \na non-reciprocal plug board. Using a computer, the coincidence spectrum \nmethod discussed in connection with the Hebern machine can be adapted for \nfairly rapid solution.\" \u2014 (Deavours and Kruh, 1985; p. 146)\n\nThe rotor cipher machine idea was conceived of by a man named Edward \nHebern. The reflecting rotor was something that was unique to the Enigma \nand its relatives; the machine Hebern designed did not have a reflector to \n\"bounce\" the signals back through the rotors. That means that unlike the \nEnigma (and most of its relatives) where the encipherment and decipherment \nprocesses were the same (since the cipheralphabet was reciprocal; e.g. if A \nturns to W, then W turns to A), these machines had to have a switch to \nreverse the direction of current flow through the wheels to be able to \ndecipher a message. This adds some security as now a letter can become \nitself.\n\nThere's quite a body of work on cryptanalysis of Hebern-type rotor \nmachines; and in this time of computers, many of the techniques used to \nbreak Enigma traffic are actually the same techniques used on \"normal\" \nmachines. These attacks rely on statistics and statistical analysis in the \nbreaking of the machine; and with the advent of the modern computer the \nmassive amount of number crunching needed can be both automated and sped up \ninordinately.\n\n\n\nGoing back to talking about the Engima and its relatives there are quite a \nfew interesting machines. The Enigma family itself, for one, provides quite \na bit of interesting variation. Meanwhile the Swiss, the British, and the \nItalians all made Enigma clones with various modifications to the base \nmachine. The British had Typex. The Italians had the OMI made commerical \nmachine, where the machine had seven rotors each consisting of two pieces \nthat could be mixed and matched (essentially a 14-rotor machine where the \nrotors step in pairs). And the Swiss had the NEMA machine, which \ncomplicated the rotor stepping in a most fascinating manner.\n\nThen we come to the Russians and the M-125 (and the improved M-125-3) \n\"Fialka\" machine. The last of the machines that could be said to be based \non the Enigma design. It did a very, very interesting thing. The Enigma's \nfatal flaw was the reciprocity of its cipher alphabet causing no letter to \never encipher into itself. Most of the reflector for the Fialka was the \nsame as in any other Enigma clone, however four of the wires from the \nreflector were not paired as is normal, instead they went to a so-called \n\"magic circuit\". One of the four wires was sent to a special triggering \nrelay that made the machine encipher the original character as itself; the \nother three wires were sent to a small bit of transistor electronics. This \nlittle piece of electronics allowed the wires to \"reflect\" into the others. \nIn one position of the switch wire 1 translates to wire 2, 2 translates to \n3, and 3 translates to 1; flip the switch and the order is reversed.\n\nOf course the cryptanalytic principles used against the Enigma can also be \napplied, for the most part, to the Fialka. The machine was Russian in \ndesign so it had 30-contact rotors (because Cyrillic) and only four of \nthose contacts did something \"weird\". That means there is an 86\u2154% \nprobability of the output of the Fialka being \"like\" Enigma output. The \nstepping on Fialka however was rather complex, and the machine had more \nrotors than the Enigma, so that did complicate matters.\n\n\n\nReferences\nDeavours, C., & Kruh, L. (1985).

However, the Brits did improve it in \nother ways, and used much better practices.\n\nAn example of the improvements would be the fact it can print, as well as \nsupplementing the fixed plugboard with two (non-moving but settable) rotors \nas well. Also the rotors had more stepping notches (broke up the stepping \npattern nicely, even if it was relatively regular). The printing feature is \nrather neat, as the Typex could also encode symbols, numbers and spaces \nwith the printing feature, but it required the operator to remember to \nswitch between encode and decode settings (unlike the Enima); it did that \nby taking three of the most unused letters and turning them into \"function\" \nletters. Which could be printed in the \"figure shift\" mode.\n\nFinally in terms of operations they did something the Germans never did: \nRegularly replace the rotors and reflectors. The Engima Number I rotor in \n1945 was the exact same as the Number I rotor back in the 1930s, whereas \nTypex completely replaced the rotors every few months, as well as having \ndifferent rotor sets for different operating groups. (There was also better \nand more stringent operator training.)\n\n\nWhat you are thinking of is the CCM. Which was an add-on/modification of \nthe Typex (and a similar one for the US SIGABA machine) that let the the UK \nand USA intercommunicate without showing each other their classified cipher \nmachines.\n\n\nThe rest of your post though? Pretty much correct. German cryptanalytic \npractices were utter crap because no one wanted to work together (like what \nhappened with the Allied forces before, and during the very beginning of, \nthe war).\n\nAlthough the Turing-Welchman Bombes are not computers; they are very clever \nmachines, but they aren't computers. The Colossi could be considered early \ncomputers (as well they should be), but they were used on the German \nSZ40/42 teleprinter ciphers.\n\nAs to the German intelligence quality? Yeah, the Abwehr under Canaris was \npretty much working for the Allies; I mean, half their agents basically \nwent to the Allies and went \"Hi, I'm a spy for the Germans. Gimme things \n(money) and I'll tell them anything you want.\" and the other half were the \ndefinition of incompetence (that the Allies were well aware of the \nexistence of, because of the first group). Hell there's even speculation \nthat Admiral Canaris himself was working for the Allies.\n\n\n\n...And I just realized how long this has gotten.",

So it was possible to eliminate the vast majority of wheel \nsettings, given a crib.\nFor the Lorenz, as I understand it the crucial flaw is the very \nslight asymmetry of ones and zeroes in each column: maybe due to German \nlanguage letter frequencies or maybe due to the many double letters in \nGerman (I'm not sure if it's a direct effect or a delta effect.)",
