She has terminal cancer and needs medications which will no \nlonger be covered.  You've got FACTS here.  They'll have to find another \npolicy, with less coverage, and she'll most likely die without the proper \ntreatments.  This is going on all over the place.  Ted Cruz is telling the \ntruth and giving FACTS.  The rest of you are living in a Tunnel Vision \nwithout facing any FACTS.  Spread the Wealth, give anyone who makes a \nliving wage NO HEALTH INSURANCE, because they can't afford the rate \nincreases, so they'll pay penalties to avoid it.  More people will be left \nwithout Health Care, than with Health Care, and are dying as we speak.  \nVeterans are without Health Care right now, and it is a major disaster.\ufeff",

I do agree some of my \nlanguage was harsh and I have edited those comments according. \n\nI accept people have honest disagreements on healthcare and other gov't \npolicies even when the discussion is based on facts. However people who \nsubstitute cynical  politically partisan rhetoric for facts then \ndeliberately and repeatedly lie, distort and misrepresent everything they \nsay on the issue in addition to expressing their wish to impose their \npersonal religious beliefs on others in life or death situations be they \nChristian or the Taliban have justly earned my contempt.  \n\nDespite fanatical conservative opposition the ACA is working. Millions of \npeople with pre-exising conditions that were shut out of the system before \nhave now gotten insurance, health care costs have stabilized and appear to \nhave begun to go down and the savings are projected to extend the Medicare \ntrust fund 10 more years. I've always found you can't argue with success \nbut conservatives try to do it every day. \n\nSo maybe like Susanna you think gov't needs to keep it's hands off your \nMedicare while simultaneously arguing we need to get rid of Medicare \ncompletely and rely on charity for our health care instead. Apparently \nSusanna also thinks given the choice Jesus himself would prefer millions of \npeople die for lack of access to decent healthcare so that Corporate Health \nInsurance CEO middle men can enrich stock holders and get their annual $10 \nmillion bonuses that they worked so hard to earn by finding new ways to \ndeny medical care to sick people.\n\nMark my words it won't be long before the very same conservative \npoliticians who have voted 50x to repeal the ACA will instead soon be \ntrying to take credit for it.

Read \nmy lips, or my words as the case may be:\nhttp://www.bcbsnc.com/assets/hcr/pdfs/spotlight_taxes_and_fees.pdf \nThe PDF in a nutshell:\n\nBeginning in 2014, health insurers will be assessed new federal taxes in \nthe form of an annual fee.  The ACA requires the health insurance industry \nto pay the amounts shown in the table below.\n2014 - 8 Billion\n2015 - 11.3 Billion\n2016 - 11.3 Billion\n2017 - 13.9 Billion\n2018 - 14.3 Billion\nEach insurer's portion of the fee will be determined annually based on its \n\"net premiums written\" its share of the US insurance market.  Put simply, \nas an insurer's market-share rises, so too will its portion of the new \nfee.  These fees are not deductible for tax purposes, but the additional \npremium needed to cover them are taxable.  As a result, health insurers \nwill need to collect premiums greater than the fee in order to have \nsufficient funds to pay the taxes and the fee.\nLook at the whole PDF and wipe the mud off your face.",

The ACA merely \nmandates that such networks cannot spend more that 20% of their revenue on \nadministrative costs and does nothing to regulate network size.\n\nThe ACA is the center-right plan, not the progressive option; it is just \nthat the current GOP and conservative movement are insanely extreme.",

Both \nlife expectancy and infant mortality are generally used as meassurements of \nnational health care efficiency by international organization such as the \nWHO, so I'm not \"picking\" anything, I'm going by the global standards that \nwe have available. The US also tops the list of conditions deemed \npreventable with adequate early care and prevention.\n\nI understand your point and like I said in my previous comment to you I do \nagree that lifestles play a part as well. However you're doing exactly the \nsame thing you're blaming me for, except top the other way around: you're \nchucking all the statistics which underline the bad state of national \nhealth in the US simply to life style. Again, yes teen pregnancies play a \npart, but like with my previous statement, if all of the teen mothers had \naccess to affordable care, the spike you mentioned would not exist because \nless kids would die. This is not a black and white situation wherein the \ngrim statistics are either caused purely by bad lifestyle choices or purely \nby the model of health care - both unquestiponably play a role. But it is \nalso a fact that using pretty much any meassurements we have at our \ndisposal, the US health care system performs more poorly overall than other \nexisting western alternatives.\n\nA night spent in a US hospital costs on average 5.6 times as much as in \nJapan for example (and japan doesn't even use an entirely tax funded \nsystem). A simple ambulance ride to the hospital costs anywhere from 4 to 9 \ntiems as much as in here.  And so on. This is largely due to the fact that \namerican insurance companies are the only ones that arfe allowed to operate \nfor profit when providing basic health care, which drives the costs up \nacross the board - and this has nothing to do with worse lifestyle: it's \njust more expensive to begin with., which reduces cost-efficiency. \n\nMy point is this: your system could be A LOT better with the amount of \nmoney you're currently dumping into it. Right now it's overly costly and \nineffective, using pretty much any stats you can find, and this ineffciency \nis largely due to the way it's organized right now.",

The thing about Obamacare as I understood its intent was a \nseperation between insurance and healthcare. There was a story I remember \nof a Michigan man who had two of his fingers cut off, his left middle and \nring fingers. He had to pay for the reattachment surgery and did not have \nenough money for both, so he, being the romantic at heart he was, paid for \nhis ring finger so he could keep his ring there. I also heard of a story in \nOntario, Canada of a 20 something year old student who lost all his fingers \nin a similar accident. However, due to the different systems, he did not \nneed to pay out of pocket for the surgeries and was immediately cared for \nthe day he needed them done, whereas the man took time to decide because of \nhis lower income status. \n\nSo long as this is the intended use of Obamacare, I will always welcome it. \nIf there is one thing Canada still does better than America, it is \nhealthcare.",

Very well done CNN!\n\n  As for the ACA - yes, it's broken as it's being sold through the website \nBUT it's like saying that ice cream isn't tasty because I can't find a \nspoon. (borrowed from Real Time) The changes to how insurance companies are \ngoing to do business are still good even if it's difficult to get the \nwebsite to work right now.\n\n  That said, the website is simply one way of providing the coverage NOT \nthe only way. I seem to remember seeing a phone number, which is how a lot \nof people signed up for coverage before having an internet to use. Never \nmind the people that don't actually have internet access and how they are \nexpected to complain about the ACA if they don't have internet to access \nthe non-working website.\n\n  And for all the people that are claiming they have insurance premiums \nthat are going up. It's insurance... You pay into a pool of premium money \nand use that money based on your medical needs. If you've seen your \npremiums double that suggests you were using far more health coverage than \nyou were paying for or you were in an \"insurance\" plan that wasn't actually \nproviding you any coverage. And, if you end up paying more than your risk \npool needs the insurance company will have to refund the extra portion that \nwasn't used, that's also in the new law. (i.e. 85% or more of premiums \ncollected must be used for medical care)\n\n  In the end we're only two months into this - it's far too early to \ndetermine what we need to do to fix any problems we eventually identify, \nmuch less how successful the ACA will prove to be. BUT, given the fact that \nthere were people (i.e. Ted Cruz, and company) that have done everything \nthey can to prevent this from being successfully implemented and they are \nthe principle critics of this, I'm not sure we should be taking cues from \nthem on how things are going...\n\n  And, my last point is that in almost the entire world you will find a \nmore comprehensive medical coverage system that costs far less and provides \nthe same or better outcomes. An example is Germany, which pays roughly 8% \nof GDP on health care. The US spends almost 18% and we have worse outcomes, \na shorter life expectancy, and almost 50 million people without any medical \ncoverage.\n\n  But... We should keep doing what we were doing before Obamacare...\ufeff",

Because Cruz didn't provide a government \"solution\" to \nthe problem to any liberals that means doing nothing. We have seen what \ngovt does, and it stinks! It had made the costs double so far. And because \nthe numbers that have actually signed up is unimaginably small that means \nnext years costs will be far higher than this years! This is why insurance \ncompanies LOVE Obamacare! It guarantees them lots and lots of money and \nthey don't really even compete with each other now. BTW, they arn't even \nstuck with pre-existing conditions because Obamacare charges an extra $63 \nper peron to pool the pre-existing conditions cost for all insurance \ncompanies. Liberals are a joke! You just made poor people even poorer with \nyour idiocy! Now far more people are without health insurance than before \nObamacare! Great job liberals!

Superior?\n\n\nI disagree with his statement, \"In a well-informed and well-intended \nsociety, the majority will always make the best decision\". Not because we \nelected Obama twice, but because I don't believe we are in a well-informed \nsociety, much less one that is well-intended. I believe we live in a \nsociety where those who are not well-informed are being intentionally kept \nthat way by those who are not well-intended. \n\n\nWhat markets in the US do you think are open? Everything has regulations, \nmaking some national standards for health insurance like requiring that 80% \nof premiums must actually go to treatment or that you can't just declare \n\"pre-existing condition!\" and not cover someone doesn't destroy the open \nmarket, although it makes ripping consumers off just a wee bit tougher. \n\n\nMost states have requirements that you have liability insurance to drive a \ncar on our commie roads... destroying the open market! Mandate! They want \nyou to have a driver's license which comes with the requirement to pass a \ntest proving you have some minimum ability to see and drive! Those anti \nopen market commies!\nOh wait... that might actually prove your point in reverse. There we have a \nlaw that mandates that poor people carry insurance that covers rich \npeople's losses if they hit their cars. Shouldn't it be on the shoulders of \neveryone that if they want their losses covered in a car accident that they \nshould carry insurance that covers only their own losses? If you get hit by \na drunk driver and your ride is destroyed and you are hospitalized... your \nfault if you made the choice not to be insured. But the law is that I have \nto carry proof of insurance that covers the other parties... not even \nmyself. Socialism!",

People go to Germany, Dubai, Switzerland, Belgium, \nEngland, Turkey, Poland... you name it.\nIt's quite a meaningless argument.\n\nThere is nothing \"lazy\" about wanting universal healthcare. Look at the \ncountries that changed their systems to it. It was quite an undertaking. \nLazy would have been to do nothing about the appalling health conditions.\n\nYou keep saying you don't want to change one flawed system to another, but \nI'm afraid that's going to be the reality no matter what direction you go. \nThere is no such thing as a perfect system. The best we can hope for is a \nsystem where flaws are relatively limited and correctable...\nAnd personally I much prefer a system which doesn't exclude millions of \npeople simply because of income, so I would say that any system which \ndoesn't do that is at least a small improvement.\nBut that's just me...\n\nAnd I say again... What system the US ends up with is up to the citizens of \nthe US, which of course includes American liberals, conservatives, left and \nright alike.",

But if you need surgery or that \nmajor MRI you either have to wait or not get it at all.  That is why he got \nhis knee surgery done in the US.  He had to pay a lot (his insurance \ncovered most of it) but he got it quickly.

You were a philosophy major. So sad that didn't \nactually open up your mind, but somehow hardened it into being an asshat \nthat twists words in childish ways in attempts at insulting people.

Then come up with \"bet you finished community \ncollege in five years\". Oh, that hurt... not any more true than your claims \nabout ACA... but I'll scurry off now because you have made another \nunsubstantiated claim about something you know nothing about. Let's \nstraighten that out... I didn't finish community college in five years, I \nteach at a college full time. Yep, in the \"North\", the evil north where I \nteach people a trade rather than how to call upon the powers of Sartre, \nCeline, Gide. Nah, I'd rather talk about people that did something with \ntheir lives like Paine, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams... even Burke and Marx \nwhen discussing government. But, I am not a philosophy major, I'm someone \nthat works for a living while still finding the time to give back to my \ncommunity.\n\n\n\nWhat is my beef? Childish internet bullies like yourself that can't hold an \ninteresting conversation, but instead insult others and declare themselves \nthe winner because you make a claim rather than even bothering to attempt \nto back up your point in a manner that would entice others to join your \nside. No sir, you prefer to insult and attack with whatever childish \nfantasies are spinning inside your head.\n\n\nWhy this little rant as a response?

It was always known that there would be people with plans that \ndid not meet the minimums and they would probably lose those plans and was \neven warned about early on.\n\nHowever as I said, the republicans and tea party picked and chose what \nparts of what Obama said they were going to listen to and made such a big \ndeal out of the statement 'if you like your plan you can keep it' that it \nbecame a perception problem, therefore the extension.",

The main issue with the pre-Obamacare \nhealthcare system was that people with pre-existing conditions were missing \nout. No one was deliberately doing that. That is simply how insurance \nworks. All that was needed was to expand medicare to them.There was no need \nto overhaul the whole healthcare system and look what a mess it is now. \nObamacare is not the right healthcare reform. If you really want to see \nprices go down and more options available you have to get the government \nout of healthcare and allow private competition.
