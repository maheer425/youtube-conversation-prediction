                    "text": "+Lumpy TopHat Yeah I've thought a lot about this as I am a huge Attack on \nTitan fan, its hard to imagine still, 1 Trigger is for the gas propelling \nthe hook while simultaneously unreeling the cable (To avoid loss of \nmomentum from friction while the hook is pulling on the cable). And then \nthe 2nd trigger to initiate the reeling in of the Cable (Allowing you to \npull yourself towards the hooks destination). And lastly Pulling on Trigger \n1 while Trigger 2 is already depressed would release the hook from where it \npunctured the wall allowing the hook to come back to you while the Cable is \nstill being reeled in when your still in motion.\n\nI would assume you would have to make a way for the pressurized gas to \nassist in the reeling in on the cable to allow fast enough movement when \npulling the person towards the object, otherwise the maneuvers of only \nusing 1 of the hooks seems unreasonable.\n\nAnd as stated already the biggest problem is making the hook capable of \npenetrating concrete, the amount of force required to shoot this heavy duty \nhook and the weight of the cable (Depending on material) fast enough to \nreach your target, without its speed being hindered too greatly, would be \nso ridiculous you probably would be blown back onto your ass every time you \nshot the cable out while standing on the ground. Not to mention when your \nairborne and you don't shoot the hooks simultaneously you'll spin 180 \ndegrees every time on the side you shot from first. And you would have to \nbe ridiculously accurate to hit targets dead on otherwise the hook will \njust bounce off the wall or whatever it was you were trying to hook into.\n\nAnd Lastly, being hopeful enough that the impact of the hook doesn't \ncompletely obliterate the wall you were trying to hook onto from the force \nof the shot so that while in motion you don't suddenly begin falling to the \nground.\n\nLASTLY LASTLY! - I was wondering what would happen if you traveled past the \nhook and then retracted it, ever retracted a tape measure from far away and \nit swing around hitting you in the arm or face? Yeah imagine a heavy duty \nhook smacking you in the stomach or arm? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.\n\nI guess it would be more like a Spear head with 4 arms that would be able \nto spread out when in the wall and then retract when reeling it in....\n\nI believe I may be over thinking this a bit much.",
