( \nhttp://www.evergladesammo.com/pd-45-230gr-fmj-bullets.html )\nYou will see that after the conical part of the bullet, they are straight \nsided- this is the part that directly interacts with the side of the \ncasing, and this length allows it to stay in place incase of bumps or what \nhave you. It is also the surface that is being acted upon by the rifling \ninside the barrel, so the idea is that the more area covered by this \nrifling, the better the effects the rifling will have upon the bullet.\n\nI am not saying that the .45 acp is 'Bigger\" but instead \"Longer\" as I \noriginally stated.",
