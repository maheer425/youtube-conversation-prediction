Divergent IS another set but not in terms of \nfactions since, technically, in the books, being a divergent is so rare \nthat there wasn't a separate faction for it, and of course humans fear the \nunknown and since being a divergent was so rare that it messed up their \n\"order\", they thought it was dangerous and wanted to hunt all divergents \ndown to eliminate the \"danger\". Because of this, divergents were hidden \nwithin the factions, choosing which one they wanted to be in. Shailene's \ncharacter is a divergent but she doesn't find that out until they do a test \nthat all 16 year olds undergo, where they get to choose which faction they \nwant to be in. Before the age of 16, people have to stay with their \nfamily's faction, and Tris' (her character's) family was in the faction \n'Abnegation' - so Caleb was originally in Abnegation before they chose to \nseparate. Therefore, a Stiff! =) Haha sorry for that very long explanation \n:3",

Actually, i'm not sure if it's all the other factions \nbut Peter would call Tris a stiff to taunt her. As Ansel plays Caleb who \nwas in Abnegation, he's also a \"stiff\" so ironically, him being \"stiff\" in \nthis interview lives up to his nickname. Hope that explains it :)!",
