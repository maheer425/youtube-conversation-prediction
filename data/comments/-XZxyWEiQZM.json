                    "text": "+Amber Barton I'm glad to read about how much you like cats and appreciate \nthem so much. I used to be a dog person, too. In fact, I just became a cat \nperson!!  But I don't agree with some of the generalizations you make about \ndogs and the differences between cats and dogs and the reasons cats are \n\"better\" connected with their genetics. For example, it is hard wired into \ndogs to be domesticated, and that is hardwired into cats, as well. \nOtherwise, they would be just like small lions and tigers, which they are \nnot!  The biggest difference in the behavior of cats and dogs in famillies \nis that wolves (ancestors of dogs) lived and hunted in packs, so they HAD \nto be more cooperative with each other. Felines are solitary hunters \n(except for lions in a pride.) You can tell they are used to living around \nother felines because they are so territorial with each other. I'd say cats \ntend to like each other, but only if they respect each other's territories. \n( I learned something from \"My Cat From Hell\" recently. He came into a home \nin which one cat was dominating the other cat like crazy and the victim cat \nwas peeing all over the floor and hiding the rest of the time. Jackson \ndidn't do anything with the aggressive cat. He did a serious of things with \nthe victim cat to turn him into a \"confident cat\" and then, as a \"confident \ncat,\" he stood up for himself with the aggressive cat, and territory got \nbalanced, and the victim cat completely stopped peeing on the floor! I was \nreally surprised that it was not a matter of re-training the aggressive \ncat. It was funny, too. The aggressive cat was this pale long-haired sweet \nlooking ball of fluff. The victim cat was a large sleek black and white \ncat!!\n\n I think it would be interesting if someone did a study on the differences \nin personality between dog people and cat people, as you mentioned that you \ndo see a difference.  I think cat people can recognize their cat's \nindividuality and how it makes choices\u2014and, after all, being so small, they \nare more sensitive and can't take as much roughousing (well, small dogs are \nmore sensitive, too, aren't they?) and dog people when they see that, think \nthat the cat doesn't care about the person and it is aloof.\n\nI prefer it when people don't say that cats are better than dogs or dogs \nare better than cats. I think it totally depends on the preference of the \nowner. Also, another important thing that makes a difference is whether a \ndog or a cat was abused when young. Just like with people, it's very hard \nto get beyond that suspiciousness and lack of trust which they learned from \nbeing abused.\n\nHere's something we could notice here online, on cat or dog discussions. \nWhich people tend to post angrier posts, cat people or dog people.  Did you \never notice? I didn't\u2014I just know there's a lot of unnecessary anger \nbetween people with different tastes.  And the reason I thought of that, is \nthat I think these extremely angry people were abused as children. Maybe \nnot physically abused, but a lot of disapproval and criticism.",

The relationship between a gentle and caring \nowner and a sweet cat is a beautiful thing.  When you see images of people \nholding their cats, and the cat is very relaxed with its eyes half closed, \nthat is a cat that is feeling love.  Of course, if an owner is cruel or \nrough with the cat, the cat will not love them.",

And this is coming from someone who grew up and \nloved (and still does love) dogs their whole life until I got my first cat \nand that completely changed my opinion of cats.  I would rather have a cat \nover a dog ANY day.  Their independent but also loving because they CHOOSE \nto be not because it's hardwired in them to be dependent on humans. \n They're fine defending themselves and will bring you gifts showing they \ncare as well as respect you more than ANY dog I've ever had has respected \nme (aside from my border collie but she acted more like a cat if I'm being \nhonest) and from my experience cat people and dog people are very different \njust as cats and dogs are.  Cats take time to grow to you, they need to \nlearn to trust you, and develop a relationship over time and dogs are just \nimmediately and blindly loyal and needy and have to be taught everything. \n Cat people value that animal's individuality and independence and respect \nit as they do their owners and it transcends into life where they value \nrelationships that take time and trust to develop instead of blindly \ntrusting whoever they meet like dog people tend to do.  This is just from \nwhat I personally have seen and experienced in my life from being a dog \nperson as a child and then a cat person at the current place in my life now \nand I see it a lot in people who are cat/dog people.  Dog people tend to \nlike being depended on hence why they like dogs.  Dogs need that constant \nguidance and attention and someone who's going to lead them because they \nlack independence and they lack their own ability to realize right from \nwrong.  I just prefer how cats are more intelligent and have vast and \ncomplex personalities and take time to love you because that time you spend \nand let grow with the cat is so worth it in the end.  More loyal than any \ndog because they take the time to get to know you as well.",

I think it is correct for anyone to \"post stupid rants\" \nonline when it comes to declawing cats. (Although I have to say I don't' \nsee any rants, stupid or otherwise. \"Rants\" have to be long to be called a \n\"rant,\" don't they?) And this is Jackson Galaxy's thread here, so if he did \nneed to be educated, this is where he could do it. When people post on the \nweb, it can be very good way to educate people, in fact. My problem is what \npeople go on and go, using horrible insulting language. Anything they are \ntrying to teach gets obscured by their anger. \n\nIf enough people educated other people online, maybe we could move towards \nmaking it illegal.  However, I've read a LOT of pro-declawing stuff online. \nIt seems that people have been doing it for a long time, and people seem to \nthink that their cat is fine. Other people say that maybe they don't know \nhow much their cat could be in pain all the time, even now. Also, I've read \nthat when the cat gets elderly, that's when problems from declawing get \nworse. so many people's can't aren't that old yet. I think it sounds like a \ntopic that needs more exposure. I didn't know anything about it until a \nmonth ago when I started researching cats, see?",

Thanks! \n\nI have two kittens, Midas and Mojito. Both are 9 months and were adopted \ntogether in August in a shelter nearby. Midas was born in the shelter and \nstayed with his mother cat until he didn't want it anymore. My mother in \nlaw also adopted his sister. Mojito was found walking alone down the street \nwith only a few days of life. The vet said it is a miracle he is alive. \nBoth are extremely affectionate and happy, but Mojito is a bit shy and \nscared.\n\nThe only problem is, because Mojito didn't have his mother cat he never \nweaned. When I adopted them I was on vacation from college and spent most \nof my days at home. I think he sort of adopted me as his mom during this \nperiod. Now every time I give him affection just wants to suckle on me. It \nreached a point that I can't let him sleep with me anymore because he wakes \nme up several times during the night trying to suckle on my cheek, ears, \nnose, etc.\n\nI've tried several methods to stop this habit. I've tried spraying with \nwater, give a small tap on the nose, ignore him, put him on the floor, etc. \nNothing works! I feel bad for him, I don't want to traumatize him or make \nhim feel that I don't love him. But I wish I could pet him and sleep with \nhim in bed without he only thinking about suckling on me all the time. Is \nthere any solution to this problem? I also feel bad because Midas sleeps \nvery well, but if Mojito can't sleep with me so can't Midas. I really need \nto find a solution to this problem ASAP! Any help or advise is welcome \ufeff",

The good \nthing is that it doesn't really seem to bother her, and she is an indoor \ncat. I just wish that she understood how bad her back claws hurt. She \ndoesn't scratch, really. It's just when she lays on my lap or back or walks \nacross me or jumps off/on me, she always seems to have her back claws \nout... There's no way she'd let me trim her claws, and my parents refuse to \nget caps for her claws, because they say that those are absolutely useless. \n*sigh* Any tips? If not, I'm sure I can probably deal with it. I dealt with \nmy previous cat biting me whenever she got mad (like if I wasn't in bed at \nbedtime... She acted like a mother... Of course, I got her when I was 5, \nand she was a tortie.). Claws are actually a bit easier than that. :)\ufeff",

But keep in mind, I can't get inside your cat's head. :)\n\n1) When she jumps, she might be using those back claws for stabilization \nbefore take-off. Then, when take-off happens, your skin feels the results.\n2) A reason why she might feel like she needs to stabilize herself may be \nbecause she lacks front claws. And so, she uses method #1. \n3) Some cats just don't realize that humans have pathetically thin skin and \nnever learn to be careful with their claws. \n4) Her nails just may be so long that they poke you even if they're \nretracted.\n\nI would say, start slowly getting her used to those back paws being \ntouched. Touch her paw a little and give her a treat. Gradually start to \ntouch and fiddle with her paws for longer amounts of time. Jackson's tips \nare spot on about trimming nails once you get there!",
