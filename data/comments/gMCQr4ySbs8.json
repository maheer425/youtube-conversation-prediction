This demographic quickly became the majority which is the reason \nthe modern industry isn't like the industry in the 90's and earlier. It's \nnot a gaming industry anymore, and devs aren't making games for gamers. \nThey are making simulators for simulator fans.\n\nA simulation is \"a program designed to provide a realistic imitation of the \noperation of a vehicle, aircraft, or other complex system\". Games are \nplatformers, puzzles, cards, or other programs that require player-input \nthat aren't just a blatant rip-off of reality. That augmented reality \ntechnology that turns reality into a video game is merely technology that \nexaggerates reality. Any game that can be augmented in reality is no game \nat all.\n\nEnjoy your easy wins in simulations, non-nerd gamer noobs.\ufeff",

A \ndecade passes and they are still making nothing but action films. People \nare calling themselves fans of the art of film despite being one of those \nwho became interested in the industry just for the action films and who \nhave done nothing but watch action films since. That is what happened with \nthe gaming industry.\nIt's all the same game over and over. I feel like I've been taking crazy \npills for a decade.",
