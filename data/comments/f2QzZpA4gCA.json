I have 2 cats and in the \nmorning i give them vet wet food mixed with pumpkin and topped with a \nspecial treat sometimes, however I do leave a small amount of dry food out, \nwhich is usually still there when I return from work.  However I have \nlearned that people are feeding some of their cats actual meat from stores, \ncooked or raw I don't know.  What is better?  And do you recommend grain \nfree food? Lots of questions sorry, I just haven't heard what you feed your \ncats yet.\ufeff",

Dr. Jean has info on optimal nutrition and health for \ncats based on what cats are designed by nature to eat. Much of the feeding \ninfo is similar to the non-commercial and highly recommended Catinfo(.)org \nby Dr. Lisa Pierson.\n\nThis info has saved many cats' lives, including our neighbor's cat and \nothers. I've noticed that our cats are healthier than most \"clinic cats\" \nI've seen living at various vet offices.  This info can help you save money \non cat food and will help you save on vet bills.
