You are aware that the majority \nof the worlds of the Imperium are left to govern themselves however they \nwish, (including local economy) with little to no outside interference save \nfor about three basic tenants (fulfill tithes, surrender psykers, reject \nenemies of the IoM)?   considering the shithouse universe the Imperium \ninhabits, these are reasonable goals to follow\n\n2. How does chaos avoid the \"fascism, Xenophobia, and narcissism\" of the \nImperium? The majority of the Chaos God's servants are highly militant \nabout their beliefs, often dealing with non-followers (whether they worship \nthe Emperor, gork and mork, etc.) using extreme violence. Piratical chaos \nforces pillage and murder on a whim and many daemons of chaos brutally \nslaughter and/or torture innocents (some of them are created with the SOLE \nPURPOSE of inflicting pain and suffering), especially those that they \nconsider 'weak'. The daemons and Chaos Space Marines usually treat their \nmortal followers as disposable manpower, and frequently treat them \nhorribly. Furthermore, CSM's despise and hate alien life as much as (if not \nmore) Imperial marines; it is also noted in the lore that many of them are \nalso extremely arrogant.",

Their duties encompass aspects ranging from \nestimating and managing manpower, weaponry, and supplies of the Imperial \nGuard, but the Guard is so massive that its inevitable of how routinely the \nMunitorum screws up something. The Munitorum decides which planets have met \ntheir tithe requirements or not, but on a few occasions rounding errors or \nmisspellings have resulted in worlds being declared traitors or wiped out \nregiments being sentenced to death posthumously.\n*Estate* *Imperium*: Charged with maintaining the records of the Imperium. \nThe Chancellor of the Estate Imperium can occasionally get a spot on the \nHigh Lords of Terra. Well, were he not doped-up on anti-depressants to deal \nhis raging OCD, anyway.\n*Historical* *Revision* *Unit*: The propaganda branch of the Imperium, \ncharged with making sure Imperial history makes the Emperor and the \nImperium look perfect and eliminating all knowledge of traitors. Because \nthe Imperium wasn't grimdark enough, they cut/paste the Ministry of Truth \ninto one of their foundational institutions. However, they must have done \nit with Linux, because they didn't manage to get enough of in to really \naffect the universe. Although... there has been a shit ton of 'revisions' \nto a wide variety of things to make various institutions look so \nunrealistically good that it defies sanity, and yet it has become 'fact'... \nWell played GW... On the other hand. This lack of knowledge of the very \nexistence of traitors could be very useful in...other ways.\n*Officio* *Agricultae*: The department charged with overseeing agriculture \nin the Imperium, serving to determine the tithes of the various agri-worlds \nthat litter the Imperium, and making sure that that there is enough food to \nfeed the people of the Imperium. Food will still not be distributed \nequally, however, and pretty much only the nobles and the Imperial Guard \ngets priority over food while civilians get whatever scraps are left. Food \nriots ensue.\n*Officio* *Medicae*: The department charged with medical affairs of the \nImperium. Unless you're a noble, Guardsman, or Inquisitor, you won't be \ngetting access to any meaningful medical assistance without visiting a \ndread-inducing back alley doc, who is always located in the underhive, \nsmells of Obscura, and whose services cost an arm and a leg. Sometimes \nliterally. If you do fall under the aforsaid categories, you are eligible \nfor drugs and cybernetics that can keep you alive and kicking for a few \ncenturies. Although certain Ecclesiarchal charities and missions do still \nprovide medical treatment for the common citizens of the Imperium, just \nprovided that they do not suspect anyone in your area of heresy, which can \nturn a humble medical mission into a crusade to burn your district or even \nyour entire planet into ash.",

Founded by Malcador the Sigillite back in the day the Emprah was \nstrutting about, the Administratum is the bureaucratic division of the \nAdeptus Terra. They assess the tithes every world must pay to the Imperium, \ntake census data, and maintain records. Unfortunately, ten thousand years \nof bureaucracy has created red tape that stretches for light years and \ninertia that can (and has) cost wars. Imagine the Vogon equivalent of the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles with all the grimdark of Warhammer 40,000 and \nhalf of the productivity; then multiplied by the number of planets in the \nImperium. The Adepts of a department will keep going about their duties \nlong after their department has become completely useless because they will \nlikely be executed for abandoning their position if they were to stop. \nThat's the Administratum. It's run by the aptly named Master of the \nAdministratum, who is the most powerful of the High Lords of Terra (because \nhe can threaten to get anyone so bogged down in red tape they will never \nsee the end of it in the span of their lives).\nThe rest of the Imperium routinely despises the Administratum; even the \narbites and the Inquisition admits they are highly inefficient (in fact \nthere's a whole Ordo that sole role is the cut as much red tape as \npossible). The Astartes and Guard are more straightforward in their \nthoughts, thinking that not a few wars could be won if they gave each Admin \nadept a lasgun and sent them to the front lines. However, as much as they \nare disliked, all other departments need the Administratum, as they won't \nknow where to go to start ordering basic supplies even if they were \ndesperate enough to try.
