                    "text": "I'm not going to call you a racist or a redneck. I am going to respectfully \ntell you that I think you're misunderstanding some of the legal nuances \nhere.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not from Florida, different laws (regarding felonies) in \ndifferent states are generally the similar but not identical (I.E. In PA, \nmy home state, unbeknownst to almost everyone we do have \"stand your \nground\", but it's only in play if the defendant can *prove* he was \nacting as in defense of an immediate threat on his safety or his family's \nsafety. In Florida SYG is much less rigid (and that's why it's so \ncontroversial). You simply have to prove you were threatened or afraid, but \nnot in immediate danger)  keep that in mind, I'm incredibly confident in my \nknowledge of PA/NY/NJ criminal codes, but Florida's could be a little \ndifferent. So I could be a little off.... But.\n\n1.)There were no grounds for a mistrial, and a mistrial is never ideal for \nthe state. I mean not just the prosecutor, the whole Florida DAs office. \nEspecially if it's dismissed *with* *prejudice* (can't be retried) That \njust didn't happen; mistrials only occur when due process is irreparably \ndisrupted. You can't ask for a mistrial simply because a DA screwed up his \ncase and he wants to use it to get around double jeapordy. If the \ndefense causes a mistrial, it's usually w.o. prejudice, and the state has \nthe green light to go again. But even then, *typically* the DA wants to \nspeed cases up and the defense wants to slow them down (because time ruins \na lot of cases. Wittnesses move away, evidence degrades, the impact dies \ndown, maybe even the victim's family moves on. If I'm a DA and there's a \nmurder, I want the defendant in front of a jury, ASAP. If I'm the defense \nI'm filing 20 motions and 30 continuances).\n\n2.) Premeditated murder doesn't simply mean he went to the gas station with \nthe intent to kill somebody. An offender can \"premeditate\" for 5 months or \n5 minutes. It's a little ironic, the classic example of non-premeditated \nmurder (manslaughter, the guy who sees his wife in bed with another guy) \nmay or may not be legit. If he thought his wife was being rapes, legit. If \nhe flew into a violent rage and didn't mean to kill him, legit. If he \nshoots the guy point blank out of jealousy, not legit. Here the defendant \ngot into an altercation, took out a gun, and fired it into a car. He knew \nwhat he was doing, he knew it could kill somebody, and he knew it was \nwrong. In PA and NY, That's murder 1. Whether it took him 10 minutes or 60 \nseconds to go get his gun, it's still murder 1.\n\nTo your point, the DA absolutely could have put man 1 or murder 2 on the \ndockett, and probably could have gotten it. We'll never know why he didn't, \nbut if you'll allow to me to speculate, sometimes when a DA's presented \nwith a touchy case like this, he doesn't want to give the jury a \"way out\". \nThey might just settle for man 1, because it's easier. Essentially he was \ntrying to make the jury give him the needle, and it backfired. He \noverplayed his hand, people are very hesitant to convict on murder 1, \nespecially when the death penalty's in play.  \n\nDo we fault the ADA trying the case for that for that? Maybe, but \nhindsight's 20/20. And I'm pretty sure the DA will be appointing a new \nguy to retry the case after the deadlock. His career's going to take a hit \nregardless. Even if he does run for office, or a seat on the bench, or try \nto go into private practice, he'll always be the guy who didn't convict \nMichael Dunn.\n\n3.) Quite simply, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, it's \nhomicide. That's why these \"attempted murder\" verdicts where somebody died \nmake no sense, but again you can't appeal a jury's verdict.    \n\n*Luckily* for the state, the jury didn't acquit. They were deadlocked. \nWhich means the prosecution, but they can't bring him up on new charges. If \nthey decide to go at him again, they can't say \"oh well, I don't think we \ncan get murder 1, let's try man 1\". It's the original charge or no charge. \nWith all the controversy around FL's SYG laws, I wouldn't be surprised to \nsee this case retried, and soon this issue will hit the supreme court. FL's \ntaking A LOT of heat, and not just in the media. It's starting to hit their \neconomy.",

Or is it because people don't \nunderstand what he said by \"it is ironic what they say about an armed \nsociety being a polite society\"?  In case that is the issue, let me explain \nthat phrase.  It is \"An armed society is a polite society\".  Is our society \narmed?  Yes.  Is our society polite?  NO!  Hence the irony!

It is \nunfair for any of us to make this case an open & shut case about a cranky \nold man killing an innocent kid for no reason.\n\nFor all we know Dunn could have made a completely reasonable request to \nstart off with & Davis could have been the one acting like an unreasonable \nobnoxious turd\n\nLet's not forget that a)Dunn was still convicted of a lesser charge and b) \nas Jarret stated, Lemon, nor any one of the people commenting was involved \nin the case,\n\nHonestly I absolutely hate this kind of  arm chair quarterbacking on legal \ncases. They are complex & more often than not this kind of over simplistic \ncommentary does not do them justice (pardon the pun)\n\nWorse is when either side of politics tries to use them as political cudgel \nto score points, The right is reprehensible for trying to use legal cases \nto push tough on crime messages & although less frequent, it is becoming \nmore common that the left is trying to use these cases to push some racial \nmessage (e.g this case & the Zimmerman case).\n\nIndividual cases are no different from anecdotal evidence, one case \nperhaps, but not something you should use to draw any sort of trend from, \nOnly aggregate evidence should do that.\ufeff",

That's SECOND DEGREE murder for which he was not charged,\n\nHe did not follow him into the store and kill him to rob him, he did not \nplan out the killing or stand to profit from it that's FIRST DEGREE murder \nwhich was what he was charged with.\n\nWhat I object to is the tactic of the prosecutors, very commonly, By not \ncharging him with second degree murder, they gave the Jury first degree or \nnothing, banking on the hope that the jury would not let him slide on \nfirst, in order to improve their prosecution record\n\nThis failed & he was found not guilty of first.\n\nAll I am saying is that the jury acted completely appropriately, by not \nsuccumbing to the prosecutor's games & I was objecting to people \ncriticizing the Jury's decision.\n\nThe fact that the jury did not find him guilty of first almost by \ndefinition demonstrates that the Jury agreed with me.",

He was frustrated with the judge being \nwishy-washy in his instructions and what they imply in terms of \nself-defense or stand-your-ground.  Lemon also kept harkening back to the \nquestion \"whether it was ok to shoot\" when the shooter is the aggressor, or \nwhen the shooter makes no attempt to de-escalate, or when we can't even \ncome to \"some consensus on whether someone is guilty of murdering a \nteenager because his music was too damn loud?\" \n\nAnd to repeat, *if* the jury couldn't agree on which murder charge best \napplies, that means they *were not* debating over any of the issues Lemon \nwas all worked up about.  (I say *if* because others have come to that \nopinion and it's the only conclusion that makes sense given the three \nattempted murder in the 2nd degree convictions this jury also handed down.  \nI haven't found any reports definitively confirming this is the issue the \njury split over.)\n\n1st degree murder and 2nd degree murder are both, equally, not okay to \nshoot crimes.  Both are murder, period.  In other words, to all those \nissues infuriating Lemon regarding flimsy justifications for \"whether it \nwas ok to shoot\" a teen who mouths off, or \"ok to shoot\" a teen who won't \nturn his music down, or \"ok to shoot\" when you've made zero attempt to just \nmind-your-own business about the car parked next to you?  The answer would \nbe, even with a 2nd degree murder conviction, is \"No. It Is Not Okay to do \nany of that stuff.\"\n\nThe problem with a hung jury is that legally there's been no progress \nwhatsoever.  It's like the trial hasn't even taken place yet for that \ncharge.  But it also does NOT mean that anybody on this jury said it was in \nany way, shape, or form OK to shoot that boy.",

But this wasn't a capital case-the \nprosecutor wasn't seeking the death penalty.  So the difference between 2nd \nand 1st conviction in his case is that he spends a *minimum* of 25 years in \nprison vs life sentence for that charge alone, and he's facing minimum \nconcurrent sentences on the other 3, meaning it's life in prison anyway.  \nAnd pushing for 1st increases the odds of a mistrial because it is a more \npotentially confusing (in this case anyway) application.  You don't have to \nbe psychic to predict it will be much harder to find 12 jurors in gun crazy \nFlorida who agree 10 seconds of fury constitutes \"premeditation\".\n\nMy point is there's a world of difference between jurors who don't see 10 \nseconds as long enough to convict on 1st and jurors who \"think it's okay to \nshoot people who don't turn down their music.\"  2nd degree murder *is* \nmurder.

                "text": "60 years in prison is nothing to laugh at, especially at the age of 45. \n Basically Dunn will be sentenced to death in prison and will die in prison \neven if he has parole in 30 years. Not to mention that their is a high \nchance that he will be killed in prison  by other inmates if he is not \nplaced in protective custody. The jury could not convict on 1 first degree \nmurder because the defense put the idea in their head that the victim was \narmed and that no weapon was found because the police searched the area a \nfew days later. As a side note, it would be nice to see at least one black \nmale juror on these type of cases. It is ridiculous that black male jurors \nnever get selected for these cases but white male jurors do. \ufeff",

                    "text": "+Plato86 Hello Plato86, good to see your comments here as always. I can \nshed a little light on this subject as I am a native of Jacksonville \nFlorida for 36 years and have had personal experience with the Duval County \n''justice'' system. I can speak about the conditions of the jail downtown \nand the prison farm, but not the state penitentiary. The only time \nprisoners are segregated are in the instances of federal crimes or murder. \nThere is a suicide block on the 6th floor, where inmates are confined to \none cell with no time out except for showering or court. It used to be two \ninmates to a cell but that may have since changed. However, inmates are \ncompletely nude and only get a mattress and blanket. No socks, sheets or \npillows allowed. General population is entirely integrated though, and it \nis the same at the prison farm. But at the p-farm, dorms house over a \nhundred inmates in each and there are no cells, only bunk beds. It is a \nwide-open space. There is a cafeteria where everyone is escorted during \nchow-time. At the county jail the food is brought to inmates, and in \ngeneral population the cells are open and there are 30 minute rec-times, \nbut it's not technically outside as there are high walls and a ceiling. As \nI said though, I don't know how things are done in the state pen. Pretty \nmuch the only time someone is segregated is whenever they are deemed a \nbiohazard due to disease. Other than that, everyone is together. I hope \nthis info gives a little clarity. Take care. By the way, Dunn will have to \nwatch his back for a long time unless it's decided he should be protected, \nwhich I hope never happens for him. This should not have been a mistrial \nand the ''stand your ground'' defense should have never applied here.",

It was a counteraction to the shooter's \nstance on why he murdered the kid claiming he was standing his ground. \nThere was no ground for him to stand on from the beginning. There are \nthousands of people who blasts their music loud in public in this country. \nIt's a part of American culture and if this was guy knew anything about \nAmerican culture, he would have simply rolled his windows up to avoid some \nof the bass from the kids car or got his gas or goodies inside the store \nand went on about his way. He was only going to hear the kids loud music \nfor less than 5 minutes, then he could have gone back to his software \nengineering job because that's what he was/is. Don's response about a \"mind \nyour own damn business law\" was counteractive to the stand your ground law \nthat people believe it gives you the right to murder anyone who makes you \nangry enough rather than the law being in place to allow you to protect \nyourself when seriously threatened. What Don basically was saying is that \nthe stand your ground law has become absurd and ridiculous so maybe people \nshould then react to it by making another but opposing ridiculous stupid \nlaw, one that could spin out of control just like the stand your ground \nlaw. I will not be surprised when Black kids start aiming their guns at \nWhite people instead of at each other and when that day comes, no one \nshould be surprised or outraged. A group of people can only take so much \nfrom White people. White people reak havoc anywhere in the world and \nprovoke people all the time. The Middle East is a prime example. Blacks \nwill respond to stand your ground law with violence towards who they deem \nas their enemy which won't be people with guns but White people with or \nwithout guns.

No, it only gives you the right to > defend and protect < yourself. \nIf a person poses an actual and serious threat to you, then yes you have \nthe right to defend yourself from being physically harmed. This is giving \nnot only Whites a bad example but Blacks also because at some point and God \nforbid, Blacks are going to get extremely tired of their children being \ngunned down over music and walking through a neighborhood they don't live \nin. Blacks are going to start taking their anger out on Whites, then what? \nThere will just be excuses by Whites, but if you react to your anger with \nviolence, then you will receive violence right back. I don't condone \nviolence but if White guys start getting \"popped\" out of the blue by Blacks \nall of a sudden, then I won't be shocked nor surprised.
