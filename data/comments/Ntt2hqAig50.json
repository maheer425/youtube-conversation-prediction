Fly east end up in Tokyo, \nnorth the north pole, etc...) Steal a space ship from NASA and end up in \nspace or on the moon... Lol. They can do this in time and hopefully they \nwill.

This video has no indication of it \nbeing on the Ps4 at all and in fact, since that video plays in 60fps, it \npretty much confirms what I said about the Ps4 being locked at 30fps.\nIt has been confirmed that both the Ps4 and the Xbox One will run the game \nat 1080p 30fps. For that trailer to have been recorded on the Ps4 it would \nnever have reached 60fps. The hardware really isn't as powerful as you may \nthink. So before someone decides to call me a fanboy, I actually own a Ps4, \nan Xbox One, and a PC that I built a couple of years ago.\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-is-1080p-30fps-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-first-per/1100-6423369/\n\nRockstar said: \"Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC \nfeatures hundreds of additions and enhancements including 1080p resolution \nat 30fps on PS4 and Xbox One.\"\n\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52341/gtav-ign-delivers-new-details-first-person-experience\n\n\"Alongside the new First Person mode, Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4, \nXbox One and PC features hundreds of additions and enhancements including \n1080p resolution at 30FPS on PS4 and Xbox One (4K compatible on PC).\"\n\nAlso nice use of the Autism Card. Did you honestly expect me to know that \nabout you? Now to be honest that actually seems very disrespectful to \npeople that have autism considering you aren't taking it seriously and are \njust using it to throw around as some sort of universal rebuttal to get \nyourself out of these sort of debates on the internet.

That is fucking stupid lmao.

                    "text": "+Slim Slader That does not support your argument at all. The gameplay \nitself was playing at 60 frames per second, therefore the footage was \ncaptured on PC. The game's framerate on the PS4 is locked at 30 frames per \nsecond, you can render the video file in 60 frames per second but if the \nsource is less then that the footage won't play back at 60. It is \nphysically impossible, unless of course you decided to speed up the footage \nto double what it was recorded at so that each single second would contain \n60, not 30 frames. In the process of doing that your video would be half as \nlong as what the original video file was and I don't think Rockstar would \nuse sped-up footage for a trailer pretty much dedicated to a gameplay \naspect of the game. It is playing at normal speed in 60 frames per second \nso once again, it is being played on PC.\n\nDo you honestly even know what you are talking about?",

It will run the game o \nmedium settings, 30fps, 1080p. A 10% (which is roughly what the PS4's APU \nis on par with) underclock on a 660 runs just a  bit slower than a 570 \n(sauce here: http://gpuboss.com/gpus/GeForce-GTX-660-vs-GeForce-GTX-570).\n\nThis means the game will run a bit worse with a 570 than with a PS4 because \na standard Win7 PC with some background applications (Steam, other DRM, \nSpotify, Chrome, you get the idea) consuming computational power from his \nCPU this will bottleneck the GPU further, but not by a noticeable amount. \nThis is where the PS4 wins, as its OS is built around gaming, and gaming \nonly.\n\nYou're also forgetting both of us estimated the specs of the game. If \nRockstar optimise this game enough, it could be possible to run it on \nhigher settings. I am judging this based off of most other AAA titles \nreleased this year. If they pull a GTA IV, then chance are, he might not \nrun the game at all. Only time will tell...",
