She's supposed to be full of herself, overconfident in her \nabilities, and a little headstrong when it comes to getting what she wants \n(at least, at first). I feel she's being unintentionally funny in her \nexaggerated mannerisms. But what I love most about this interpretation is \nthat we clearly see what Knightley has to put up with on a daily basis - \nhis self-satisfied whistle at the end of the video says it all :)\ufeff",
