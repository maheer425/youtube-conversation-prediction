MANY MANY dyslexics can read b/c they have \nmemorized word shapes and compensated in other ways. They do, however, \nprocess slower b/c of this as they read. Dys= Difficulty with. Lexia= \nLanguage.- in Greek. Dyslexia involves not just reading or spelling, but \ninvolves AUDITORY processing of language. They hear whole words not parts, \nand have much difficulty w/ the normal phonics/sounding out because they \ndon't hear letter to letter. It may also involve rhyming, directionality \n(up down & left right--thus backwards letters, but also directionality in \nother parts of life.) It can affect memory. It is an inherited trait--50/50 \nchance. It can be extremely MILD or very PROFOUND. They may have trouble w/ \noral language as a child, memorizing arbitrary facts, sequencing, and more! \nDysgraphia is not spelling. Dys=Difficulty with. Graphia=meaning writing. \nNOT spelling. Two completely different things. The dyslexic brain is \nactually different than that of someone w/out dyslexia. The right hemispere \nis normally 10% smaller than the left. Dyslexics have both sides the \nsame--not because one side is smaller, but because the right is larger! \nBecause of this, many are gifted in Art, Athletics, Music and much more!!!! \nThere ARE programs that help with it!!!",

I would argue \nteachers specialising in teaching dyslexics will have developed experience \nof processes that work for many dyslexics and can probably help find \n methods for each individual quicker than someone trying by themselves. \nRegarding your speculating point, trialling different methods I beleive has \na plenty of merit for dyslexics, the benefits could be large for all anyone \nknows. I suspect many are low to zero cost (a book perhaps, a voice \nrecorder etc. or just attempting to consciously think differently, \nremembering to use spell check!). Having said that I personally have \nshocking working memory relative to other aspects of IQ. Besides practice \nand the use of common memory techniques such as creating stories I have \nfound precious little information on how to try and improve that aspect (I \nresearched brain training games and there seems little evidence in the \nscientific community for their effectiveness). I will keep looking however! \nI mainly just have to try to override the symptoms with reliance on \ntechnology for organisation etc.",

Until we have \nresearch focused on specific categories within dyslexia along with evidence \nthat there are interventions that are specific to these conditions we are \nsimply speculating.

This is fairly new \nresearch I believe. Up to now, as you say, diagnosis is from symptoms which \nmay have led to some mis-diagnosis. Symptoms are also determined by many \nother factors in individuals lives (specific problems with dyslexia can be \ncombatted with practise for example). That does not rule out the \npossibility there being a very large group of people with dyslexia (indeed \nthe evidence is very strong there is), with the same brain types. I agree \nthat individuals need to treated as individuals. But dyslexics brains do \nfunction very differently to the rest of the population (which common \nteaching practises cater for). It's not unreasonable to suggest there are \nprobably methods that work better for the group of dyslexics on average. \nIndeed coloured overlays may not work at all for the rest of the population \nand so they may think they are stupid merely because they don't work for \nthem.

I \nbasically was partying, doing all kinds of drugs and hooking up with guys \nthat didn't care about me. I didn't care if I lived or died at that point. \nIt was January of 2011 and I almost over dosed on some ecstasy pills. I \nremember looking at myself in a mirror and asking God for help. I went to \nchurch that following Sunday and it felt so good to just be there. I \nlistened to the surmen and it hit home so starting changing my life from \nthat point on. I don't go to church anymore I think I just wanted to feel \nconnected to god and now I know that our creater is within all of us at all \ntimes. I feel like everyone has to go through some shit so that you can \nrealize who you truly are and that Is anything you want to be. You're only \nlimited by your beliefs but it's taken me years to get where I am today. \nReprogramming my mind with just positive thinking. Every day I repeat \nafermations that change all the years of shame, embarrassment and \nself-doubt. And Google has helped a lot too... lol the best advice I can \ngive you is to find the things that make you feel a live and do them as \nmuch as you possibly can.",

I had wonderful teachers (now that I think back-I didn't think \nthat then) who bought me special books and worked with me trying to improve \nmy handwriting.  It never helped.\n\nI can recall my first issues with dyslexia being in the early simple learn \nto read and write books when lower case b's, and d's and even the letter p \ngave me problems.  M's and N's were always bad.\n\nMath gave me another problem all it's own.  Word problems were \nincomprehensible to me.\n\nWhen I was in the fifth grade I had a special reading group that taught me \nto slowdown my reading.  This worked but it gave me another problem also. \n Always to be the last to finish tests, sometimes not getting to finish, \nthe frustration factor was to the point where I would pull out my hair. \n Oral test were a nightmare.  Often, I couldn't  finish the answer in time \nfor the next question.\n\nNow I am an old man.  I had a good life.  I spent 23 years in the military, \nreached the rank of Warrant Officer, became a military court reporter, had \na small unit I was assigned as commanding officer, I worked many  years at \nan ammunition plant, and have written six books.  So yes dyslexia gave me \nproblems and it still does.",

I did see an articles on the web today that has me \nsmiling.  Stephen Hawkins had said that the God particle could cause the \nuniverse to collapse in onto itself. \nOne of the books I wrote over 20 years ago I used that apocalyptic theme.\n\nI still have trouble spelling.

With words it's vowels that get inverted. The same ones over and \nover again.  I think my teachers couldn't put it together because like you, \nI was an avid reader.  I've even had a teacher write on my homework for me \nto stop being rebellious and spell my words the correct way.  \n\nBy the way - Hats off to you for getting the word out on the idiocy of book \nbanning.   In the past I spent a lot of money collecting antebellum \nmemorabilia.  People would ask me why I collected that stuff.  It's part of \nour history.  I would take it into high schools along with negative images/ \nsigns of American Indians, Asians, the Irish and Italian and lecture on how \nthose images were used by the rich to divide the workers.  There is NOTHING \nin American history classes about unions.  And that is a crying shame. \n Maybe some John Steinbeck, if they're lucky,  but thats it.",
