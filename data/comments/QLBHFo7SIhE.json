They are tiny, pale yellow with real long legs.  They are spiders \nso yes they are venomous but no way is it harmful to humans.  You ever seen \nMythbusters? Adam Savage actually aloud several of these guys at once to \nbite him, which he said they certainly were biting which throws out the \nwhole \"fangs too tiny\" crap.  Obviously he was fine.\n\nThe second is not even a spider at all.  It's called a harvestman, this is \nthe one commonly called \"daddy long legs\".  Those round, brown guys with \nthe crazy long legs.  They aren't spiders at all. They are arachnids.  They \ndon't even have venom glands at all and their entire anatomy is different \nfrom spiders. Completely harmless and actually pretty cool.",

Poisonous animals \nare animals that will poison you if you consume them. Venomous animals bite \nor sting injecting venom into the bloodstream. The two things are very \ndifferent. For example a grass snake is highly poisonous if eaten but has \nno venom with which to bite you. Conversely a rattlesnake has a highly \nvenomous bite but is not poisonous upon eating. There is a commonly held \nmisconception linking poisonous and venomous but they are in fact defined \nvery differently. Love your channel though.\ufeff",

The majority are second generation, \nmany of which migrated to Australia during and after WW2. More and more \nmigrants and immigrants from Asia and the Middle East are shifting this \npopulation statistic as well.\n3) Most Australians live in cities or in towns, and up to eighty percent of \nthe population live along the coast.\nThe majority of the inland is dry bush land and desert, but Australia is \none of the most environmentally diverse continents on the planet, with \nmangrove swamps, rainforests, grasslands, alpine, semi-arid and arid \nenvironments. I blame movies for that association of dry red Earth \neverywhere XD\n(I know you were joking, but I just wanted to give you some information. I \nhope I didn't come across as angry or anything.

The only trouble is, that will be many hours and people give up \nwhen they get no response.

But \nluckily there have been no recorded deaths since the introduction of the \nanti-venom in 1981 although people still get bitten. The anti-venom making \nprocess is quite incredible though, first they milk the female funnel webs \nwhich they only do In the Australian Reptile Park (females because there \nvenom is stronger) then when they have there venom they send it to a lab in \nMelbourne where they put the venom in a rabbit little by little every day \nand each week they increase the dose of venom and in a month they would've \ngrown a full immunity so they take there blood and separate the white blood \ncells from the red ones. Those white blood cells from the rabbit is now the \nanti-venom to a Funnel Web. (White blood cells are what fight bacteria they \nmake you better when you are sick, the rabbits blood would've developed an \nimmunity to the funnel webs poison.) And that is the reason why we haven't \nhad a funnel web death since 1981.",

                    "text": "+ElementGuns12 The daddy long leg can kill other venomous arachnids (like \nthe red back) because it throws a web around them to then kill them with a \nweak venomous bite.  The whole myth of them being very venomous comes from \nthe fact that they are able to kill red back spiders, which are very \nvenomous.  Similarly, where I live, they sometimes attack black widows that \nhave egg sacks in the rock walls and then feast on the eggs and the host of \nthe nest.  Black widows (like the red back spider) are also much larger and \nmuch more venomous than a daddy long leg.  Red back > Black widow... for \nreference.  Funny thing is that we used to have a wall in our back yard \nfull of an assortment of many species of spiders.  Most of which consisted \nof these orange garden spiders that resembles crabs, black widows (and lots \nof them), jumping spiders, brown recluses, daddy long legs, wolf spiders, \nrare tarantulas, and many other unidentified species of spiders.  Ever \nsince we brought our guinea pig to live nearby, we hosed the wall and all \nthe spiders (from what we have last seen) are no where to be found other \nthan many other dwellings in the nearby sheds, rusted cars, and my aunt's \ngarden.  Luckily most of the spiders (including the black widow) run away \nfrom humans and danger, and do not act aggressively... however the brown \nrecluses were definitely a problem, as their bite doesn't hurt, but can \nkill just as much as the black widow, and they attack EVERYTHING that \nmoves.  Very quick little buggers.  ",
