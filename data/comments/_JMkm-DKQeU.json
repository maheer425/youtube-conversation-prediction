The difference between Europe and the US is that in the US \nyou are free to chose such health care programme that suits you best (by \nyourself or through an employer). While in Europe there is usually a \nmandatory health insurance which is paid the same way as in the US on \nmonthly basis, or as part of taxes. Consequently, in Europe there cannot \noccur a situation where someone does not get a medical aid. However, in the \nUS, those residents (around 15% of the American population) who are not \ncovered by any health insurance whatsoever, are exposed to the risk of not \ngetting any medical support in case of need.

Therefore making people who get sick or \ninjured get better quicker and back to their jobs. That increases \nproductivity which in turn, betters the economy. The downfalls are, other \nmajor health care companies are loosing members due to this. The big 'fat \ncats' that own those health care businesses want to make as much money as \npossible, and since they're loosing members, they are increasing prices to \nmake up the profit.

Then the \ngovernment had to introduce a deductible.  They asked the seniors to pay \n100 dollars every August and then after that all meds were free again \n(although they did pay a reduced dispensing fee, and they were allowed to \nget a 3 month supply, so 5.95 for each med every 3 months wasn't horrible). \nThe first year and sadly for at least 3 more years, the seniors were \nfreaking.  Some would rather not get their important medications because it \nwas too expensive, yet were in a rush to go next door for their hair \nappointment!  It seemed ludicrous that they would opt for a nice 'do' or a \npretty blouse rather than blood pressure/cholesterol/stomach acid \nmedication.  Eventually they came around, but for the first few years, \nevery August I needed ulcer medication - the arguments were crazy!  Really \nwhat I'm saying is change is hard, some ppl see the logic immediately and \nothers after much prompting eventually come around.  Health should always \ncome first.  Heck, whenever I send a card to someone for a holiday I \nusually wish them good health and happiness.  \nHave a good day!  Sorry for the long response, but g+ took away the \nkeystroke restrictions.",

USA has one of the worse and least advanced health \ncares in the western world, and there is a simple reason for it: \nCapitalism. \n\nI'm all for capitalism, but not when it involves health care, because it \ncreates health care into a business. In America hospitals only invest in \ncheap equipment than can be used for thousands of people. Hospitals won't \nbuy certain medicines or equipment's or technologies for certain illness or \ndisabilities, simply because they don't effect enough people. The most \nadvanced countries in the world when it comes to health care are \ncommonwealth countries, as they work together for medical innovation. Hence \nwhy Canada and Australia are up in the top 10 list. Also, so long as you \nhave to pay for healthcare, it is not in anyway \"affordable\". Affordable \nhealthcare is free healthcare, simple as that. I can't call a country \ncivilized if it sees healthcare as something to be exploited for financial \ngain as it's the most vulnerable and weak that need healthcare the most, \nbut won't be able to afford it. To even try and backup the American \nhealthcare system even though the facts go completely against your \nargument, probably explains why America is crashing in pretty much every \nfield. The reason countries like: Britain, France, Germany, Australia and \nCanada don't have stronger economies than America, is because unlike \nAmerica they invest the money into public sectors. Which also explains why \nthese countries and most of the developed world has overtook or is \novertaking America in: Health care, education, science, influence, \ndemocracy, humanitarian, crime and justice ect ect. The only thing America \nis top at is: An over sized military it doesn't need and will never fully \nuse, the number of people who believe in angels and the worlds biggest \ndebt. So long as America remains so capitalistic, then it will continue to \ndestroy it's self. Like Abraham Lincoln said: America will never be \ndestroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be \nbecause we destroyed ourselves. America is just a country that war \nprofiteered during the world wars and now it's extremely nationalist, \nundemocratic, extreme democratic has a crime rate higher than mount Everest \nand a wealth inequality so large it could tilt the Earths axis,\n\nThe top 20% earners in America control 40% of the wealth, the top 1% \nearners control 10% of the total American wealth, minimum wage is lower \nthan most countries and it doesn't mandate maternity leave and the bottom \n20% earners and the middle class only control 0.5% of the totally market \nstocks between them. When 60% of the country is practically irrelevant for \nthe functioning of the economy, and their lives boil down to mere labour \npower, then that is when you need to start implementing free health care \nand real worker rights.There is a reason most of the world hates the \nAmerican government.",

The thing that knocks the US down in the rankings \nis the bloated costs.\n\nThe cost problem is caused by horrendously bad insurance laws. Before \ncongress fucked up the health insurance laws in the 80's and 90's; the US \nhad affordable and cutting edge healthcare. The US was near the top by \nalmost all measures at that time.",

I'm sorry, but I think that politicians who still think \nhealth care is to be bargained with in the most economically powerful \ncountry in the world don't have the ability to emphasize. Recent poll by \nthe health ranking index shows that Britain, a country who is expected to \nbe the 3rd most economically powerful country in 15 years, spends the least \non health care than any other nation in the western world, yet still has \nthe best health care to provide. America spends the most and is ranked the \nworse health care in the western world. \n\nIf you can't see he's targeting \"moms with kids\" then you're severely \ndeluded. Politicians target sympathy groups to get votes, they always do. \nHence why politicians often hold babies or they will be seen with cute \nkittens or they will always chuck about the line \"Kids are our future\" ect \nect. The whole point of those lines and actions are not to make an argument \nvalid or make a point, it's just to get sympathy votes. Because if you're \nnot into politics and you see in the paper a politician with a baby you \nthink \"aww that's cute, might vote for him\". Of course if you're into \npolitics this probably won't get past you, but most people are not into \npolitics. Why didn't he mention \"fathers with kids\"? or \"homeless people\"? \nor \"Ex-veterans\"? or \"rich people\"? or \"families\". Why specifically \"moms \nwith kids\"? Why? Because society seems them as vulnerable, but at the same \ntime moms with kids can also afford to buy health care. Homeless people are \nvery vulnerable, but can't afford it, so *poof* they're out the window, \nfuck them. Right who's next? I know, moms with kids: Vulnerable, worried \nabout their children and can afford to pay health care. Land of the fuck \nfree my arse, you're about as free to do what you want as long as the \ngovernment can tax it.I can't call a society civilized till it provides a \nfree health care system. And I'm not having a go at the American peoples \nhere, I'm having a go at your corrupt, greedy fucking politicians. ",

Last I checked, the House has a \nRepublican majority, unless that has changed, most of congress are indeed \nrepublican, so even though the Senate has a Democratic majority it doesn't \nmean squat for passing bills if the House won't pass it too, which means \nrepublicans have to agree with the bill, initiative, or whatever, you get \nmy point. and pass it too, THUS they have a voice in congress and control a \npart of it too, otherwise the bill won't get to Obama, and if Obama doesn't \nget the bill, he can't pass it, or veto it, anyways, the point is, no bill, \nlaw, or anything else has the chance to be passed unless the republicans \nagree to it, because it's a fifty-fifty with Democrats currently owning the \nSenate, and Republicans currently owning the House, and all Obama really \nhas is the final say as far as passing bills and such is concerned.

                    "text": "+mj carollson\nHealth Care is NOT a right, no one is saying you can't get medical \ntreatment, we are saying that we don't want to pay YOUR bills.  I don't \nwant to pay higher taxes and higher premiums so Tammy in the Ghetto with \nfive Bastard Children and one on the way that she can't afford to feed can \nget her \" Free\" Health Care.\n\nIf Health care is a right, then where does it stop? Should we be forced to \npay your car payment as well? Or pay for your Plastic Surgery? How about \nmaking Tampons a right for all Woman, and we need to pay for that to, not \njust any Tampons, but the most expensive ones on the market.\n\nHealthcare as not being a right is a FACT, not an opinion. That is the \nproblem with you Liberals, you would rather do what makes you feel good at \nthe end of the day than do what is right. Doing the right thing offends \npeople, sometimes results in people getting hurt, or even in the most \nextreme cases results in people getting killed,  in the long run it was the \nright thing to do.\n\nEconomically we can not afford this, we need to cut Welfare/Entitlement \nprograms and benefits not create more. I am not suggesting cutting \nGrandpa's medications or Medical Treatments, I am suggesting reforming \nWelfare back to what it used to be, the basic essentials for life such as \nbread, milk, eggs, water, rice, beans etc and cut steak. lobster tails, \ncrab legs, shrimp, junk food, soda, cash back assistance, etc.\n\nWelfare is supposed to support those that have worked their whole lives and \nare retired, the psychically and mentally handicapped, and help people help \nthemselves by not supporting them.\nWelfare State or Socialism is not economically sustainable, and it hurts \neveryone.\n\nThe reason why Health Care is so expensive is because the Government is \ninvolved with massive, unnecessary regulations and taxes.\n\nTake Medications for example. It costs Pharmaceutical Companies less than \nfive cents to make a pill, after regulations, taxes, red tape,etc that pill \nnow costs five dollars. Everything the Government touches it raises the \ncosts. But you Liberals just don't get it.\n\nImagine if the DMV was privately owned and there were competition. The \ncosts at DMV would be cheaper, the Customer Service would be better, etc. \nWhy? Because companies have to persuade you to give them your money unlike \nthe Government that can take your money at gun point. There is no \ncompetition when it comes to the Government so you can't go to another \ngovernment. ( well you can move to another country).\n\nThink Universal Healthcare is so great? Everyone keeps referring to \nCanada's  Health Care as being so wonderful, well here are the facts. Yes \nyou get prompt medical care for a broken arm, but lets say you need a brain \ntumor removed, or Cancer treatments. You will be put on a waiting list for \nmonths. Forget about getting that one on one personal care from your \nDoctor, you will be treated like a number.\n\nHow about that little problem of Supply and Demand. As is there are not \nenough Doctors to cover everyone's needs. Throw a few Million more people \ninto the system, add Millions of Illegals, we now have a problem of the \ndemand being high and the supply being low, which in turns raises the cost \nof Medical care which the Middle Class will have to suffer the blunt of \npaying for.\n\nEmployers now are facing these problems,  the very little that they will \nreceive as a tax break for providing their employees with Health care does \nnot even cover the costs. So, is it cheaper to have all their Employees go \non Obama Care and pay the fines which in turn the Employees have to pay for \ntheir own insurance? Or just simply cut hours, cut pay, lay people off, not \nhire, or all of the above. This Bill in the long run will hurt the poor, \nand decimate the Middle Class by raising Health Care costs through the roof.\n\nIt's not like you can opt out of it, you have to buy it and like it or you \nwill be fined. Oh, and you better hope you pay for all the insurance to \nmeet the requirements even if you don't need it, if you don't you will be \nfined.",

Your \nfeeling as to whether or not healthcare being made available to all is \nadvantageous or not---is an opinion.\n\nP.S. If you really care about money as much as you claim to (hell, if you \neven take once second to think about the principle of residual loss for a \nmoment) you wouldn't be so shortsighted as to say healthcare is not a \nright.  Do you have ANY idea what the costs are for emergency (and \noutpatient) treatment of ailments that are treatable for a fraction of the \ncost if addressed in the early or preventative stages?  Add to that the hit \nour nation's economic productivity takes every time a minor medical issue \nbecomes a major medical issue and takes a skilled, knowledgeable worker out \nof commission---and you've got a problem.   There wasn't nearly as much a \nproblem with the healthcare system as it was decades ago, but the young \nadults you are so concerned about are living in a society where \npre-Obamacare private health insurance was scarce (and that which was \navailable a mere shadow of the benefits their parents enjoyed).  They are \nliving in a world where \"permalancing\" is the employment mode of the day, \never since employers realized it was better for the bottom line to treat \npeople as human capital and not human beings.  Obama didn't inflict that \nbullet wound; he's just made an attempt to move us closer to stopping the \nblood loss.  Yes, it will cost us in taxes.  But that I liken it to the \ndiscomfort one experiences when using rubbing alcohol to disinfect a \nwound.  Besides, what he has done is far better than what most of the \ngeneration who stood idly by while Reaganomics chimed the beginning of the \nend can say they've accomplished. \n\nIf you think you can do better, I hear there's an election coming up in \n2016.",

They have a fundamental misunderstanding of how \ntaxes and health care work and how important they are, all they see is the \ndollar sign they'll have tacked on to their bills - yet they completely \ndisregard the benefits of the small price we pay. \n\nIf you don't have an intelligent argument and you just hate him to hate \nhim, I have no time for you. And if you expect him to be the perfect human \nbeing and never make a mistake, I also don't have time for you. If you \nthink he's worse than Bush, I - shockingly, don't have time for you either. \nGrow a brain. \ufeff",
