That means that it was the taxcuts and not the wars that \nthrew it off balance.\n2. Upon arrival, Obama created a massive spending spike, that has barely \ndecreased since. The decrease in deficit came by increasing taxation.\n\nSo, when republicans say that Obama is expanding the government, they are \ncorrect. What Cenk showed is that he is doing it more responsibly than the \nway Bush pretend-reduced government in his time.\n\nOverall, the only president that has done well in a very long time is \nClinton.

The \nannual deficits and total debt number does not include Freddie/Fannie debt \n(in trillions!) and it does not include S.S./Medicare/Medicaid unfunded \nliabilities, which are in the tens of trillions.\n\nStandard accounting rules call for businesses to report all future \nobligations on their balance sheet. The govt. doesn't abide by that same \nrules. It places tens of trillions of debt off-balance sheet.\n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve is monetizing the debt and annual deficits! \nIt's purchasing $45 billion per month of treasuries on the secondary \nmarket. That means interest payment on the debt are artificially low. The \nFed can't keep those rates low forever. They've already caused commodity \nprices to soar, bubbles and an increased concentration of wealth. And the \nCPI is not capturing a lot of the inflation.\n\nAt some point the Fed is going to have to turn the monetary spigot off or \nrisk a run on the dollar. Then interest rates will go back to historic \nnorms or, more likely, even higher given low savings rate of Americans. At \nthat point the reported annual deficits (even with all of the tens of \ntrillions of debt off-balance sheet not included) will go well over a \ntrillion per year. The federal government will not be able to even service \nthe interest on the debt when that day comes.\n\nTYT is an effing joke. They are just party tribalists who pretend to be \ntruth tellers. Maybe they don't understand what is going on. I think that \nis likely.

Sure, we owe less money to people, but we also have less money. \nIt's like if my student loans were $50,000 and I had $8,000. A few years \nlater, my loans are $20,000 left, but I only have $1,000. My debt is much \nlower, but I also have a lot less money on hand.

You have a \ndeficit of $100. See what it means now? It doesn't refer to money you \npossess, but the money you earn subtract the money you spend.\n\nPlease take this to be a notice of words do not always mean what you think. \nSo do be careful.

The government \ncollected more money because a stronger economy increased the earnings on \nwhich people were taxed and because certain tax provisions, such as the \npayroll tax cut, expired. Tax levels also increased for Americans above a \nhigher income threshold. lower unemployment rates meant the government \nspent less money on unemployment insurance. The across-the-board spending \ncuts, known as sequestration, also cut spending for many government \nagencies. I do agree that its a two party dictatorship. we are fooled in to \nthinking the only way is left or right, but no matter who gets elected the \nreal people in charge are behind the scenes.",

I'm sure they don't all hate Obama but there are quite a few that \ndo.  That is evidenced by the fact that your average person bringing up \nObama cant even refer to him by his actual name.  They cant even say his \nname without using it as a way to insult him.  Do you really insult a \nperson like that solely because you don't agree with his policies?

Don't know how that \ncompares to your school, but we were proud. The school officials were proud.\n\nI'm referring more about higher education. I'm sure you disagree with the \namount of money high schools required compared to me. But colleges? Look at \nstudent debt. It's stupidly high. It discourages people from getting an \neducation and encourages people to just go work. We can't have that. Not \nwith how the economy is changing.  More so with so many jobs requiring a \ndegree, and the jobs that that can't leave the country are service jobs. \nWhich tend to be low paying. That doesn't sound right at all.\n\nAnd I agree, not everyone should get a high school degree. Some people \ndidn't do a thing for it and shouldn't get it. I never said we shouldn't \nleave people behind. I only care for the people who don't want to be left \nbehind.\n\nAlso my school used blackboards. And some whiteboards. I wish we had LED \nboards. Also your schools sound way better off than mine for the love of \ngod. I haven't seen a LED screen in a classroom ever....My teachers stayed \nthere the whole day.....Again, your school sounds a lot nicer than mine was.\n\nAlso there's such a thing as money not well spent and money not well \ndistributed. Doesn't mean you don't need it, just means the person handling \nthe money needs to improve. Because at my high school, we had textbooks \nthat were well past 5 years old, maybe even 10. Were they in good \ncondition? No. But they were all we had.\n\nI will admit to there being well funded schools. But clearly not all \nschools are well funded since your school sounds so much better than mine \nwas.....\n\nThere's also the problem of No Child Left Behind. Dumbasses made the public \nschools be all about tests. I talked to my teachers. They all teach around \nthe tests. Nothing more. That doesn't sound like a good thing personally. \nThe whole point of learning, is to apply what you learn in real life/what \nyou'd like to do in the future. But with this, it's making it seem like, \nyou learn to get a good grade. You learn to get a job. You learn to get \npaid more in life. FUCK that. Education is not about money or grades. \nEducation is about learning about the world and exploring it. Not grades or \nGPA. When the fuck has education been about money? Excluding accounting. \nThey're special, because the whole thing is about counting money.....\n\nI do not believe that anyone with motivation will find what they need to \nsucceed. If that was true the american dream would still be a blazing. But \nI do not believe it's still alive and well. Maybe alive, but well? I don't \nthink so. The best I can think of, is student loans. Ya we can go to school \nand earn a degree. But the question is, is it worth it. A large chuck of \npeople don't work in the field of their degree, so what's the point of that \ndegree? At least when I finish school, I'll know what the point of my \ndegree was. To learn more about something I love. If I find something in \nthe field, awesome. If I don't, well I was expecting it.\n\nIn conclusion, your view is very different from mine. Because your school \nclearly is better than mine was...I do want more funding for high schools, \nbut not all high schools. Just the ones that need it. Where I want more \nfunding for everyone is college, because FUCK student loans. The economy in \nthe US is changing. It's shifting to one that requires degrees. Because \nwe're shipping a lot of work overseas. So we can only keep certain jobs \nhere in the states. Service jobs will never leave the states. But aside \nfrom that, a lot of it is up for grabs.

The teachers were ok, but my \nMama is the one who pushed me to get ahead.  If someone wants teachers to \nbe more responsible for their kids than they are, that is pretty darn lazy, \nand the kids will likely be thugs. \n\nThe school system I live in now is no better than the one I was raised in, \nand they have A LOT more money. It is wasted. I do not like paying for \nteachers to take half the day off to go shopping. But that is where I am .\n\nI didn't have a private tutor, I had a mother who worked hard to make sure \nI got where I am today. \n\nAnd sorry, but some kids need to be left behind, not given a diploma \nbecause they show up \"most of the time\".  At some point, people need to \ntake responsibility for themselves. This isn't the 19th Century. There are \nwell funded schools with books and all the essentials needed to succeed. \n LED projectors are not needed to succeed. They are nice. But clearly that \nis not what makes the difference because kids are getting dumber and dumber \nthe more money we spend. If the kids want and desire more, there are \nlibraries. Anyone with motivation will find what they need to succeed in \ntoday's world. Problem is, they want everything handed to them. \n\nThen, when the kids fail because they are lazy in school or drop out, they \nwant us to pay for their food, housing, cell phones, healthcare, etc, etc, \netc. I am sick of the nonsense.

Unless of course, you're talking about private tutors. But \nthat's another matter. Not all families can just change which school the \nstudent goes to. It took my family two years for me to switch schools, so I \ncould go to the school behind my house. I don't even bother thinking about \nthe bullshit behind that.\n\nI prefer how it was before, where Federal government only provided money, \nand every student was not expected to be tested every few weeks. I mean the \nclassroom was changed with that. It was no longer about teaching the \nstudents so they could learn. It became, teach the students based on these \ntests, and nothing more. This is why I loved my Calculus class in high \nschool, because you didn't have to teach for the test, because you had the \nwhole year to prepare for that test. Plenty of time to get ready for that \nAP exam.\n\nThere's also the problem of money. Because usually switching schools, \nusually involves the school being further away from their home. Not all \nparents can afford to take their child to school. I know because I wanted \nto go to a different high school, to fit in.\n\nLucky you, my school begged teachers who have been there for years to \nretire years early. So they could hire new teachers, who by the way cost \nless. We also dealt with large classes. I was just lucky to be in AP, \nbecause the school cared for us. Other classes had 30+ students stuffed \ninto one class, while my AP had.....20?\n\nIn the end, I think you just lived in a nicer place than me, or maybe your \nschool has better people working there. I don't know, but your school \nsounds better off than mine was.",

If you were \nto be a GOOD journalist, you would have reported Bush's prior years of \ndeficits, which averaged about 250 billion, WAY lower than any of Obama's \ndeficits. Don't get me wrong, I hate Bush AND Obama as presidents... But \nyou need to stop doing biased reporting. So, has the deficit gone down \nunder Obama? Yes it has but only when compared to Bush's last year (2009 \ndeficit), and not to his average. If you compare it to his average and/or \nprior years (before 2009), then Obama is still much higher in deficit and \nhas yet to bring it back down to that level! Thank you.

You \nthen need to think of a new way to reduce your deficit by cutting you're \nother spending, say your weekly salon that costs $200. then you're back on \na surplus of $50, but you're debt still stands until it's paid back in \nfull.

If you have a large deficit, then you need to borrow money to \nbalance it out, to break-even so to speak. I don't know how to explain it \nclearer.For example, you start a company, you need to borrow some \nmoney,that's debt. if you're company is making a positive cash flow whilst \nspending loads of money, that surplus, you have money in your pockets to \nspare, but if you're company is not gaining money, a negative cash flow, \nthat's deficit, you need to borrow more money just to balance it. but to be \nclear, negative and positive cash flow is not the same as profit/loss. \nbefore you can tackle the debt sufficiently, you need to reduce the \nspending rate, and bring it to a surplus, then you would money to back the \ndebt.

The Fed wasn't \nmonetizing debt right after the war. It didn't start doing that until the \nlate 60's under Burns at the Fed. Bill Martin was Fed Chief for 17-years. \nHe never monetized the debt.\n\nPaul Volcker didn't monetize the debt during his tenure. In fact, he \nstopped the dollar debasement/price inflation by turning the currency \nspigot off. That was the only way. And interest rates rose to 21% for \nawhile.\n\nThe govt. and finance and the whole damn economy has become addicted to \nartificially low interest rates. The Fed really started ramping up the \nprinting press in 2009. It has been buying $45 billion per month in \ntreasuries and $40 billion per month in MBS with currency created out of \nthin air for years.\n\nAll of this has created price inflation, but much of the inflation to date \nhas flowed into bonds, housing, stocks, bonds and even fine art (see bubble \nin fine art).
