You may be right, giving priority to Hierarchy may be \ntypically British (with Quenn, Lords, Sirs etc ...) while giving priority \nto legibillity (related to aesthetic) may be typically French (artistic and \nluxury domains, LVMH etc ...) Maybe. . . Each one his perception. I don't \nknow your age, I am 70, and I can tell you that my first writings in \nTangier were laid on a not-so-white paper (rather light brown, coming from \nCasablanca, not from Paris or London) with a lot of inclusions. And paper \nwas probably worse when most Continental countries enfavored the use of a \nmuch visible mark (coma), while.British, accordind to your opinion, \nenfavoured the hierarchy.\nHowever I don't see why the hierarchy in text should apply to numbers. In \nArab, Persian, and Hebrew, writing is from right to left, but not the \nnumbers which are left to right, applying a different rule totwo different \ndomains.\nNote that final points are almost invisible on my screen (no problem, a \nsentence starts with a \"Majuscule\" (upper-case) or next paragraph), while \nthe comas (rythm of the sentence) are legible, and a coma misplaced can \nmake a lot of difference in some meaning (so, coma may be more important \nthan a point, in that case).\nFor what concerns the shape of the \"1\" and the \"7\" in French, we just \nrespect (in hand-writing and some fonts) the original code built-in the \nfigures, ages ago (one angle, two angles ... seven angles ...).  Funny to \nsee that, on this particular point, WE, French, stick to traditions ! God \nsave the 7 and have a nice day !",

                    "text": "+crunch642\n\nHello crunch642,\nIf you\u2019re saying that your Tangier experience with the Brits inspired you \nto agree with their use of the hierarchy of commas and dots .... but that \nthe difference between French and Brits hand-writing the 1s and 7s caused \nyou to change your mind, I must tell you that sounds so funny \u2026 and so very \nFrench.\n\nDot versus comma, 1s and 7s, in my opinion, is a cultural thing and it has \nvery little, if anything to do with legibility.\n\nAs for dirty paper causing legibility problems or confusion in the early \ndays, I don\u2019t quite see your point (pun intended).\nIf a \u2018dot\u2019 could be mistaken for a \u2018comma\u2019 due to imperfections on the \npaper, then you have problems no matter which marker you choose.\n\nAllow me to explain with an example: You write \u201c1.000\u201d if you want to write \nONE THOUSAND. Agreed?\nAccording to you if the paper is not squeaky clean (fly shit) the dot \u2018.\u2019 \nmight be read as a comma i.e. 1,000\nNow it reads simply reads as 1 with 3 zeros behind the decimal mark. That \nis NOT one thousand. As I said, it\u2019s a problem.\nAnyway, the first use of the \u201ccomma\u201d and \u201cfull stop\u201d goes back to the 15th \ncentury with the introduction of printing.\n\nQuite frankly, I consider it rather unimportant what people in different \ncountries choose for their decimal marker. Nobody is right and no-none is \nwrong!\n\nI am a lot more interested in the fact that people can\u2019t agree on universal \nstandards of anything from commas and dots to decimalisation, weight, \ndistance, capacity, speed, temperature etc etc.\n\nIt\u2019s rather amusing that you state \u201cAfter some reflexion\u201d you concluded \nthat \u2026 \u2026! Did the reflecting involve any research at all? Perhaps you have \nevidence that might support your conclusion that the structure of a \nsentence has nothing to do with the structure of figures? If not, then it\u2019s \nmerely your opinion. Do we agree?\n\nThe majority of the people around the world may even disagree with you \nconsidering that most people use the opposite method of separating \nthousands and decimals from the Europeans.\n\nWhatever you conclude or believe is fine with me, honestly! I have no \nproblem if it makes sense to you however I am questioning why it should be \nlogical for punctuation marks in the written language and punctuation marks \nin mathematical expressions to be diametrically opposed to each other. It \nis illogical!\n\nI have evidence to prove that at least one French hypermarket chain \nadvertises its prices in both ways. I doubt that it was a mistake but they \nare showing different articles and their prices. The decimals of the prices \nare separated with a point on one article and with a comma on the other ON \nTHE SAME PAGE! Chapeau! Evolution!?\n\n\u2018Coma\u2019 and \u2018Comma\u2019! Michael Schumacher was in a \u201ccoma\u201d for a few months! \nVirgule = Comma!\nIncidentally, you say you are 70!?

                    "text": "+Gene Hunter\nHi Gene, just too late for Happy New Year, so ... Back to decimal \npoint/coma.\nWhen I was a young scholar (living in Tangier, International city, I had \nBritish school-friends in the French school) I was thinking exactly same as \nyou (the hierarchy of coma and point in writing). Then I have been thinking \nalso about the way to write 1 and 7 in English or French. And I realized \nthat the french logic was NOT based on hierarchy, but on \"LEGIBILITY\" \n(\"lisibilit\u00e9\". did I translate it properly ?).\nThis is why, for instance, our ONE has a little \"nose\", unlike US which is \njust a vertical bar which can be confused with a slash (divide symbol). Our \nSEVEN  has a \"neck-tie\" to make it not confusable with our ONE. Today, \nhandwriting is over, we all write on keybards and chose a variety of fonts \nand styles, and the digital displays have standardized the figures.\nSO, back to the Decimal sign, whatever it is (coma, dot, other), it was \nimportant that it should not be confused with a natural spot (or \"fly \nshit\") on rough paper. Today, the cheapest paper is absolutely spotless and \nbright white, but when I was young (I am 70) it was not so !). And the fact \nis that the coma is more visible than a dot. They could have chosen  \" or \n,,  even more visible, but they were happy with a single coma.\nConcerning The dot (point) between thousands, it is NOT used. Instead, \nthere is a SPACE. So, the french \"hierarchy\", if any, is \"space\" between \nthousands and \"coma\" before the decimal section..And after some reflexion, \nI came to the conclusion that the structure of a sentence had nothing to do \nwith the structure of the figures, it had NO reason to follow it, only some \ncharacters are similar.\nIt is like English, Irish, and Portuguese, they use the same latin letters \nbut use them differently. (some day you will explain me the TWO \npronounciations of the \"i\", in English ONLY (in NO other language).\nLast point ( :-) ) about decimals : often, the decimals are written in \nsmaller size, and then nobody cares about point or coma, no possible \nmistake.\nHave a nice day.",

Language is \nnot logical, and it has hardly ever been, which is why there are so many \ndifferent sorts of languages with so many different grammar types and \nrules. So is made a language that almost any word around you can move \nwithout losing the sense. And that's not how logic works. If logic defined \nlanguage, then all languages would have the same, stable syntax. But they \ndon't. Should the verb be at the beginning, middle or end of the sentence? \nShould the object be before or after said verb? It's not defined by logic. \nVocabulary isn't defined by logic. Sure, language is used to express \nlogical thoughts, but it's not the other way around, logic doesn't define a \nlanguage and it never has, because it's all patterns that were created by \ngroups of people that evolved over time, not patterns that were decided \nbecause \"they made more sense\". They were used like that because that's \njust how the language evolved.

The '.5' in \n'3.5' has to be seen as a '50'. You just add a '0' so you can fairly \ncompare two double decimals. . ----> 3.5 becomes 3,50 (trois virgule \ncinquante) which is indeed > 3,35. When 3,5 is written, it implies 3,50. \nCalculators also remove unnecessary 'zeros'. If I remember well, we call \nthose zeros 'imaginary'; even when they are not there, they ARE there! LOL\n\nAnother way, would be to only consider the first decimal of each number, to \ncompare them: 3,5 > 3,3(5).\n\nMakes perfect sense, bien s\u00fbr! ... No? ;))",

We all know 3.5 > 3.35 but how do you \nfigure that out in the French system?\n\n3.5  => trois virgule cinq\n3.35 => trois virgule trente-cinq\n\nDo you just automatically know that since there is only a single digit \nafter the decimal in 3.5, that the cinq is greater than trente-cinq?\n\nI can understand that and it isn't that hard to work out, but you have to \nadmit it seems a little backwards.

In \nlanguages that inflect fully (or almost fully), you can omit the pronoun \n(i.e., you don't need to say \"I\", \"you\", \"he\", etc., because that is \nalready implied by the verb itself). This is what happens in Spanish, \nPortuguese and Italian, for example. \n\nOther languages, like French and English, have limited inflection. So while \nyou can say \"am hungry\" (and it's clear that you are talking about \nyourself, even without the \"I\"), if you say simply \"are late\", it's unclear \nif you mean \"you\", \"we\" or \"they\" (even with \"you\", it's unclear if you \nmean singular or plural, so people tend to add more words like \"guys\" to \nclarify that). And, since the pronoun is required in those cases, English \nand French speakers end up using it for every person (even for the ones \nwhere they wouldn't need it).",

I \nsuppose this is the laziness of language, tending to find the shortest way. \nBut it is just my guess.\nFor the dates, it is not always like you say (and you took a bad example !).\nWe say \"Mille huit-cent\" or \"Dixhuit cent\" equally. Just ask a French of my \ngeneration (70 y.o., today I don't know what they learn) : Marignan ??? the \nanswer is \"quinze cent quinze\" and you would probably say \"fifteen fifteen\" \nwithout any \"hundred\" (1515 is the battle of Marignan, won by Fran\u00e7ois 1er \nin Italy) and no one will say \"Mille cinq cent quinze\". But we always say \n\"Mille xx\" if it is LESS than 11xx (do you say \"ten hundred\"???), then  If \nit is equal or  more than 11xx, we say  equally, \"Onze cent xx\" or \"Mille \ncent xx\", with a preference to \"Onze cent\", \"Douze cent\", Treize cent\" \n...It takes the same time to say \"Dix-huit cent xx\" than say \"Mille huit \ncent xx\".so it's up to everyone.\nThis goes up to \"Dix-neuf cent xx\". Then for 2014 we say \"Deux mille \nquatorze\", and now \"Deux mille quinze\", NOT \"vingt cent quatorze\" or \"Vingt \ncent quinze\" !!!.\nFor 2243, I don't think we will ever say \"Vingt-deux cent quarante trois\", \nbut rather \"Deux mille deux cent quarante trois\".",

A long time ago barbarien who lived here counted on a base of 6 that's \nwhy they haven't any word after 60.\n\n2nd (my favorit options) In the middle age, the market people used weights \nto give the value of the goods. Weights were limited and did not exceed \n60. A weigh of 70 required a weight of 60 and 10, for a weigh of 80, four \nweight of 20 where required.\n\nI hop my English was not too bad, because I'm a Swiss from the French part \net I don't always write in English.\n\nHo! and here we have words for 70, 80, 90. whiches are \"septante\", \n\"huitante\" and \"nonante\" ;)\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Gene Hunter First, thank you for your clarification. I agree with quite \nall you said.\nActually, I didn't really think about when we use \"mille milliards\" and \"un \nbillion\". And now, I realize that I've never heard \"un billion\" on TV for \ninstance. So, yes we use a 3rd scale based on \"milliard\" for the everyday \nlife.\nHowever, I can assure you the short scale is used too. In Math or Physics \nfor example, french books use the short scale.\n\nBy the way, I completely agree that we all count in our familiar ways : \nAmerican and British people use the long scale, lots of European countries \nuse the short scale, France uses it too but has a preference for a third \nscale, Japonese people are used to count with packs of 10 000 instead of \n1000, etc.\n\nSo, I find it irritating too when someone says that nobody but him is \nright. And I know for the other guy but my point has never been to declare \nour way to count is better than others ! So I apologize if you thought so. \nI believe that any counting system has its advantages and its drawbacks.\n\nAnd I'm really disappointed that we have this image of beeing arrogant or \nsnobbish or whatever internationally. And it irritates me even more than \nyou when someone confirm those prejudices.\n\nWell, let's back to the video and my first comment, the point was that \nEnglish people could be bothered by small numbers in French and that French \npeople could be confused by big numbers in English. For instance, I've \nalready seen bad translation from English to French when trillions of \ndollars were involved. The subtitle didn't translate it correctly and it \nwas written \"un trillion de dollars\" which actually means a quintillion of \ndollars which is even not possible. The point was indeed about the \nconfusion between the two ways to count even if both are right and legit.\n\nEt merci du compliment ^^, I actually spend a lot of time writing those \ncomments but I enjoy debating with you so it's not a big problem !",

The French used the \u201cmilliards scale\u201d long before \nthe British were bullied by the Americans into changing. The British \nofficially adopted the short scale in 1974!\n\nI know that many French people have never even heard of a billion, a \ntrillion let alone a quadrillion etc. That\u2019s fine with me, I do not object \nbecause in their heads it all works in multiples of milliards and yes, they \nlike it because it is familiar.\n\nHowever, I object when any Frenchman dares telling the rest of the world \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s completely false.\u201d\n\nWe all count in our own familiar ways but we should be tolerant when other \npeople do it in a different way.\n\nQuite frankly, who wouldn\u2019t find it rather irritating when a Frenchman \ntells you that they are right and the rest of the world is wrong? Perhaps \nyou do not consider that arrogance or snobbery but make an effort; try and \nlook at it from a foreigner\u2019s point of view.

It's true that \nmore-than-35-year-old people sometimes convert euros in francs but it's \njust because they grew up when franc still was the money in France. So, \nsometimes they need to represent themselves an amount of euros by \nconverting it into francs (even if this tends to disappear). We are not \nstuck in the past like you seem to say.\n\nNow, about what you've said, I think we use \"mille milliards\" more than \"un \nbillion\" to avoid the confusion with English and because, as it's not very \ncommon, \"mille milliards\" is just more representative.

They say 25360 as \"two ten-thousand five \nthousand three hundred six ten\". They are easy enough to read and write.\nFor decimal number, they are exactly same as English, use dot(.) and read \ndecimal digits as individual number.\nFor bigger numbers (like 416,000), they also write comma as same as Eng's \nbut they read it diffrenetly. Since they have \"ten-thousand\" as a word. \nThey devide 4 digit as a part as 41|6000 and read as \"four ten one \nten-thousand six thousand\".
