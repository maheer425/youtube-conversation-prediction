But at the same time there are \npeople of color that have blue eyes and blond hair, you can see these \ntraits in black people, Asians and Aboriginal Australians, including \nthe red hair trait. Speaking on the subject of  the Aryan Brotherhood, I \ndoubt that they know that racial scientists were also classifying other \nEuropeans as different races. Dark skin white people during the 18th \ncentury were considered \"dirty whites\" for being mixed race, when their \ndarker pigmentation is due to environmental factors. Today these ideas \nof superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, \ngenetically there is no such thing as race.\n\nEven the majority of Germans have brown eyes and dark hair. It's so ironic \nwhen Hitler and the Nazi party were practicing eugenics, killing Jews and \nsterilizing the poor, mentally ill and disable, criminals, degenerate, \ndissident, homosexual, idle and Roma Gypsies, all were white people. The \nfunny thing is that Hitler got the eugenic idea from the Unites States. \nDuring the early centuries of the U.S., Jews, Irish, and  Italians were not \nconsidered part of \"white America\" until the middle 20th century. These \nthree ethnic groups endured some of the same discrimination that racial \nminorities endured today.",

However let me remind \nyou that brains are not fully analyzed and understood by neuro scientists \nand engineers yet, and from my undergrad level of neuro engineering \nknowledge, I still keep my skepticism on his conclusion of towards the \nstudy.  confirmation bias has always existed in social science and many \nearlier research papers are discredited as a result of that.\n\nI am sure there are many insights you can get from ones' study, but it's \ndifficult yet important to hold your critical thinking skills when reading \nones' studies because it's really easy for an author to uncontinuously mix \nhis views into the documents he wrote (even if its peer reviewed)",

Feagin, who is \na world known sociologist and social theorist. Dr. Feagin is a Harvard \nUniversity graduated, a Pulitzer Prize winner and was president of the \nAmerican Sociology Association from 1999-2000. Dr. Feagin field of study is \non extensive research on racial and gender issues, especially in regards to \nthe United States.\n\nThe brain scan imaging study I\u2019ve mentioned is in full detail in his book \n\u2018Systemic Racism: A Theory of Oppression\u2019 published in 2006. The book gives \na historical and contemporary view on white-on-black oppression, and not \njust African-Americans, but people of color in general in American society. \nDr. Feagin has been doing this study for years and his facts are in full \ndetail in his book and research page that you can get online. But hey if \nyou doubt my sincerity, there are some YouTube video that shows Dr. Feagin \ndiscussing his research and several of his other books that deals on race \nissues. You can also find the brain scan race study publish in the Journal \nPsychological Science and online.\n ",

I don't see any women from Caucasian countries winning \na \"Ms. World\" or \"Ms. Universe\" contest, although women from India have \nindeed won it. So what you consider \"beautiful\" may not be the case as far \nAS THE REST OF THE WORLD is concerned. Also, in the REAL WORLD, it is \ngenerally what you're perceived to be is how people will ultimately treat \nyou as far as race is concerned. In a country as diverse as the U.S. for \ninstance, no one is going to NITPICK over subtle differences between a \nCaucasian, a West-European, or an East-European Slav. They would all be \nconsidered as \"White,\" especially after they all settle for a generation \nand have American born kids (often of mixed ethnic backgrounds with North \nAmerican accents. Same thing goes for Jews, Arabs, Persians, Turks, \nArmenians, and others from the Middle-East, Central Asia, or South Asia \n(including Indians and Pakistanis) who LOOK White, as well as Latinos, the \nleading minority group here in the U.S. Many Latinos have very little \nnative DNA and are almost of entirely Spanish descent, and they too can \npass as White here in America. So basically, if you look White, and other \npeople think you are White, then you're White! As for those people from \nCentral Asia who look like Japanese or Koreans, they will be labeled as \nAsians. It's basically about how you look, get it? And no one cares or \nnotices the subtle differences between Caucasians and others who qualify as \nWhite. ",

The word \"Caucasian\" here in the \nU.S. is merely a synonym for White, as Central Asians/Eurasians and \nMiddle-Eastern folks who are light-skinned and European looking, are also \nconsidered to be White. Even some Latinos who are light-skinned and are of \nmainly Spanish origin (whose ancestors have not mixed with the Native \npopulation in the Americas) can pass as White people here in the U.S. Only \nthose who have obvious darker skin tones, darker hair/eye color, and look \nabsolutely nothing like a European White person are considered to be \nsomething else. The ethnic minority groups here in the U.S. are mainly \nclassified as follows: Black (negroes of African/Caribbean origin), \nHispanic/Latino (all Latin American folks hat are visibly non-White), Asian \nmost of whom are Oriental (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) or Southeast Asian \n(Filipino, Indonesian, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Laoasian, Cambodian, etc.), \nbut there are also quite a few Indians & other \"Desi\" people, and of course \nthe Middle-Eastern and Eurasians who visibly don't look White. Fiy, there \nis also the etnic category of the Native Americans as well as other natives \nlike the Inuit (Eskimos), etc. And that is basically how race \nis categorized here in the U.S.\n\nSo, when Sydney English referred to herself as \"Caucasian,\" what she meant \nto say is that she is a general White person of European origin (most \nlikely Anglo-Saxon), as her name would indicate.",

They'll tell you, all blacks \nlie & steal from you. All Asians are sneaky. And in a lot of cases, \nmilitant minority families will tell their children all white people are \nthe enemy. This is what we call, cognitive behaviour. It is association of \na thing (person, animal or extension of either) with a past negative \nexperience with that thing. This has to be educated out of the entire human \nrace. And, maybe unfortunately for a lot of people, we have educate \neveryone to learn outside of their culture. NO ONES culture is the be all \nend all, we all need to become generalists who learn a much broader scope \nof education. That's the ONLY way out of this racism mess.\nAnd it's not just racial issues we see being programmed into the next \ngenerations from birth....it's everything! The government will tell you \n\"There has always been war, so we've got NO alternative but to strike back \n& continue to have conflicts, wars & armies forever.

They'll say \"Geeez I don't know...\" Ask them how do you increase \nthe agricultural yield, without exhausting the soil. They'll say \"I don't \nknow...\" \nWell, what do you know, you idiotic morons? Why the hell are you in charge, \nif you can't directly solve anything? Why aren't the city planners, \nengineers, doctors & 'general' scientists in charge? People who can \nACTUALLY improve ALL of our lives for the better. We're told we need \nmoney...why? Can you 'literally' build a sustainable house out of money? \nCan you eat money? Can you stitch actual clothes out of money? No to all. \nSo what bearing does money have in the real world? Absolutely nothing. In \nthe Bible (I'm no longer a practicing Catholic) it Jesus says \"May it be on \nEarth, as it is in Heaven\" well there is no money in Heaven is there? Jesus \nchased all the money lenders out of the temple, so why does the Vatican \nChurch need money then? \nYou see what I'm driving at? It's all bullshit. Everything we have learnt \nover the last 1,000 years or so is bullshit. We got rid of Kings & Queens, \nyet we've got governments, presidents & prime ministers now. \nWHAT...THE...HELL!

Or the history about \nracism itself, because for example I am a historian and I will be a teacher \nsomeday and here children in ~7th grade will learn about slavery of \nafricans by europeans/~americans, the occupation of African land, the \ndeportation of slaves, the civil war in the USA and of course in the later \ngrades you will have the second world war and how africans finally got \ntheir recognition in Europe and then in the USA and of course their \ncitizenships. And this old \"racial classification\" system was established \nas some kind of pseudo science (like the creationism in the US) to justify \nthese conflicts and the exploitations. They did some strange things like \nskull measuring and called it \"science\" and today we have DNA tests and \nadvanced science which declared these ideologies as false and said that the \nterm \"race\" in the human race is kinda complicated because we are too \ndiverse, everyone of us is practically a mix of like 1000s of \"races\" and \nwe are also not \"white\" or \"black\", we are brown or less brown and if your \nskin seems pretty bright it is mostly because where you live you didnt got \nenough sun. So for me it is basic biology which I will teach my students in \nthe future. Human is the species, homo sapiens sapiens is the race, other \nraces are for example the neandertaler or the homo erectus which both got \nextinct. Funfact: The classification you are obviously using is ironically \nthe one of the Nazis declared by them back around 1933. The US adapted it \nbecause in the beginning they had very strong sympathies with the nazis, \nbecause yeah they were still ultra racist as well back then.\n\nI think what is also very problematic about the use of races is that \nespecially in the USA you can see that many people put a high value on \nrandomly chosen cosmetic attributes which causes a strange kind of \nidentification among them.",

Prior to the civil rights \nmovements, minorities couldn't even use the same drinking fountains, \nfacilities, or even attend the same venues as their White \ncounterparts. If our society hadn't progressed from that era, and the laws \nwere not amended to do away with those segregation guidelines, you and your \nsister along with each of your families, wouldn't even be able to attend \nthe same restaurant together. But thanks to our continuous \nefforts, minorities, women, and even gays have acquired many rights and \nprogressed to levels that those before them couldn't enjoy. Yes, we have a \nlong way to go, but with each passing generation, we do make a little bit \nof progress every time.     ",

Both of these shows have multiple Grammy and Peabody Awards for \ntheir excellence in both entertainment and journalism.

If current trends \ncontinue, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in \nprison during his lifetime\n\u20221 in 100 African American women are in prison\n\u2022Nationwide, African-Americans represent 26% of juvenile arrests, 44% of \nyouth who are detained, 46% of the youth who are judicially waived to \ncriminal court, and 58% of the youth admitted to state prisons (Center on \nJuvenile and Criminal Justice).\nDrug Sentencing Disparities\n\u2022About 14 million Whites and 2.6 million African Americans report using an \nillicit drug\n\u20225 times as many Whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African \nAmericans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of \nWhites\n\u2022African Americans represent 12% of the total population of drug users, but \n38% of those arrested for drug offenses, and 59% of those in state prison \nfor a drug offense.\n\u2022African Americans serve virtually as much time in prison for a drug \noffense (58.7 months) as whites do for a violent offense (61.7 months). \n(Sentencing Project)\nContributing Factors\n\u2022 Inner city crime prompted by social and economic isolation\n\u2022 Crime/drug arrest rates: African Americans represent 12% of monthly drug \nusers, but comprise 32% of persons arrested for drug possession\n\u2022 \"Get tough on crime\" and \"war on drugs\" policies\n\u2022 Mandatory minimum sentencing, especially disparities in sentencing for \ncrack and powder cocaine possession\n\u2022 In 2002, blacks constituted more than 80% of the people sentenced under \nthe federal crack cocaine laws and served substantially more time in prison \nfor drug offenses than did whites, despite that fact that more than 2/3 of \ncrack cocaine users in the U.S. are white or Hispanic\n\u2022 \"Three Strikes\"/habitual offender policies\n\u2022 Zero Tolerance policies as a result of perceived problems of school \nviolence; adverse affect on black children.\n\u2022 35% of black children grades 7-12 have been suspended or expelled at some \npoint in their school careers compared to 20% of Hispanics and 15% of whites\nEffects of Incarceration\n\u2022 Jail reduces work time of young people over the next decade by 25-30 \npercent when compared with arrested youths who were not incarcerated\n\u2022 Jails and prisons are recognized as settings where society's infectious \ndiseases are highly concentrated\n\u2022 Prison has not been proven as a rehabilitation for behavior, as \ntwo-thirds of prisoners will reoffend\nExorbitant Cost of Incarceration: Is it Worth It?\n\u2022 About $70 billion dollars are spent on corrections yearly\n\u2022 Prisons and jails consume a growing portion of the nearly $200 billion we \nspend annually on public safety\n\nThis is a problem, and it contuse to be so.

It's basically said when someone has done something untoward or \notherwise not awesome. The implication is \"You thought that was a good \nthing to say/do? You have another think coming!\"  (Basically telling them \nto rethink their actions/words)\n\nAlso, you are correct about Due. =) \"With all *due* respect\", stating \"With \nall the respect that is owed.\".\n\"With all do respect\", while being essentially a non-sense statement, would \nbe the equivalent of telling some one to do something with respect. (Just \nin poor English)\n\nI get what you were saying, I was just enjoying the way people butcher \ncommon idioms and colloquialisms.

The intention behind my comment \nwas not about defending the wrong and hurtful comments about the Miss \nAmerica Winner, but instead about the comment generalizing all \"Americans\" \nas stupid and moronic. One of the reasons why others tend to feel so angry \nabout \"Americans\" is that the whole range of emotions (from joy to pain) \nconcerning social issues, such as racism, exists here in American society. \nThe greatest joys of human achievement and the worst atrocities against \nhuman dignity have occurred in this diverse country. So, when ignorant \npeople make hateful comments about other hateful comments, and thus \nreducing ALL \"Americans\" as rednecks, I feel compelled to point out the \ninjustice.

You do know that Islamic \npeople comes in many ethnicities and backgrounds, as well as the many \nethnicities in the Jewish and Christian faith. I, myself was a former \nChristian who became an atheist and was born and raise in the U.S. You like \nto comment about the future and how Christianity and Judaism \nfundamentalists are not without fault; well you need to open your eyes, all \nreligions haves its downside which is why I became an atheists.\n\nFor instance, did you know that in today's Israel the majority populous \nAshkenazi Jews are discriminating against Beta Ethiopian Jews? Yes, their \nfellow Jews are being discriminated against, by the very same people that \nwere being discriminated and being wipeout by the Nazi party and most of \nEurope. In Israel even their fellow black Jewish brothers and sisters are \nconsider second-class citizens along side with the Palestinians who have \nmore Israeli DNA in them than the Ashkenazi Jews and are the rightful \npeople of Israel or Palestine. There were no \"white\" or European \nPalestinians, nor \"white\" or European Jews in the Middle-East and in North \nAfrica. The Ashkenazi Jews originated in Eastern or Central Europe and are \nJewish by conversion.\n\nThere are countless of YouTube videos of Ashkenazi Jews being very \ndiscriminating to Christians and talking behind their backs. If you don't \nbelieve me, there's is an Israel commercial with a runway model type woman \nand a puppet, making fun of the crucifixion of Jesus. But, if the roles \nwere to turn and someone or some group were making fun of the Jewish \nreligion heads will roll. It's the very same thing that I've seen with \nChristian extremists in the US.\n\nOh, by the way, I find your comment about going into \"Muslim country \nwithout getting shot or maimed\" very humorous. It's clear to me that you \nhave not went nor enter any Islamic country with that statement, as there \nis but a few Islamic countries that are engage in war and there are lots of \nIslamic country that are very peaceful. And your oil comments is about as \nhumorous and moronic as the statement about all Islamic countries being \nshitholes, extremist, warmongers, when the biggest warmongering nation is \nthe US.\n\nHere's a fact that you don't know?! Oil is fossil fuel, which derived from \nburied dead organism that can be found in most parts of the world. If you \ndon't want to use Middle-Easterners oil I suggest you can go to the West, \nand use their abundant supplies of oil that they're keeping, or maybe what \nyou really mean to say is since Europeans and the West no longer have their \ngreedy hands stealing other nations and peoples' resources, you no longer \nhave people, especially people of color kowtowing to Europeans and \nWesterns. Oh, and your comments about Opium just amazes me considering \nOpium is a necessary drug used in medicine as a pain reliever, it was use \nthroughout the East for that purpose until the US (the biggest drug dealer \nnation of all times) made it illegal. You Westerns and Europeans should be \nhappy to find opium, because before there were opium, Europeans were \ncutting and hacking people limbs and leeching people even till the point of \ndeath.\n\nMy point to you is so simple; \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't \nthrow stones.\"",

European Christians during that era were the religious \nextremist, not the Muslims.\n\nAlso factor in the witch burnings of countless majority of women on the \nbaseless accusation of practicing witchcraft and don't forget the Crusades \nera.

This country and the vast \nmajority of the world isn't homogenetic, which blows this race thing right \nout of the water; we're all Africans. Besides, if you really think about \nit, this is a mixed country. The only thing I don't understand is if a \nperson is born in this country regardless of ethnicity or ancestry, that \nperson should automatically be called American without a hyphen and their \nancestral country of origins. I could understand if that would apply to a \nperson who is a naturalize citizen, but not for people born in this country.",

Your insane rhetoric makes no sense \nwhatsoever? Frist of all, I am not white, and second, all Homo sapiens \nderived from Africa, East Africa. I can also assure you that my forefathers \ncame from West Africa and Western Europe. Your statement that \u201call other \npeople have hair like goats\u201d is laughable considering Asian hair is not the \nsame as European hair type, different textures. So the \u201cnappy\u201d hair \nstatement makes no sense, because the San people of Africa have very coarse \nAfro type hair and Asian people derived from them. There are Afro-Asians in \nAsia, and dark skin Asians with very Afro type hair. There are Africans \nwith straight hair! Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right, pale skin Europeans are \ngenetic mutations, but that doesn\u2019t make them less African or human. And \nwhere if ever in my comments that I\u2019ve stated that white people are a \n\u201crace?\u201d For there is no such thing as \u201crace.\u201d I did state previously that \npale skin people are recessive, but pale skin Europeans do have melanin, \nnot that much of it.\n And yes, I do agree with you that humans, no matter what sort of man-made \nweapon or machinery will ever be strong enough to destroy the earth. The \nearth has been around for 4.56 billion years, and ours sun have been here \nmuch long than the earth\u2019s existents, and as long the universe and our \nsolar system still stands, there will always be the earth. As a species \nwe\u2019re dependent on the earth, the earth doesn't depend on us. And yes, we \ndo have some influence on the earth's atmosphere but, not that much \ninfluence to ever change it drastically or destroy it. Our carbon \nfootprints will have a huge effect on us, not the earth. The earth has a \ncapacity to repair itself no matter what happens to it.\nGet your facts straight, I stated that it\u2019s estimated that by 2050 there \nwill be 9 to 10 billion people living on the earth. Look at the population \ngrowth now, it was estimated by the U.N. as of October 31, 2011, there \nwould be 7 billion people, and their predictions were right. There\u2019s now 7 \nbillion people on the planet. What makes you think that there wouldn\u2019t be \naround 10 billion by 2050? By 2050, 70% of the human population will be \nliving in urban areas. Tell me with all these people living in such crowded \nareas, how is it not possible that they are not effecting the environment? \nLet\u2019s put it this way, in the 1800s 1 billion, 1960s 3 billion, 1974 4 \nbillion, 1987 5 billion, 1999 6 billion and now in 2013, 7 billion people \nliving on the earth. For every second 2 people on average are died, and for \nevery second, 5 people are being born each year. There are 80, 90 year olds \nthat seen most of the history of human population growth increasing by two \ncenturies. How is it possible that I could be lying about that?\nAlso, where did I state that the earth would destroy mankind? Sure it may \nwell be possible, certain species have long been extinct without the \ninfluence of humans, but I\u2019m pretty sure with our population trend, and our \npropensity of getting at each other\u2019s throat, we may not need the earth to \nkill us off.

What, she's got a beautiful face & body, so let's give her all \nthis attention & adoration? I'm sorry, I didn't realize that she was a \ngreat sculptor who made her face out of putty & clay? All of those girls, \npast & present. Give me a break, our societies, ALL SOCIETIES are SO far \nbehind with all this unimportant bullshit like these beauty contests & \nhaving a day of mourning for actors who get paid millions of dollars who, \nlet's face it, couldn't give a shit about you or me. Why the FUCK do we \nhave bronze statues of killers (soldiers & officers) adorning our cities? \nWhere are the bronze statues of doctors & engineers who advanced society \nfor the better? Why do we hold on to such misery like 9/11, Bali Bombings, \nLondon/Spain bombings where ONLY about 3,500-4,000 people of all those \nevents combined were killed? Nations & other cultures, who do it MUCH \nharder on a hourly basis (not just daily), lose tens or hundreds of \nthousands of people in a single event and pick themselves up and go on. We \ncomplain about the most trivial shit in the western world. I went on a trip \nto both Rwanda & Cambodia, after HAPPILY being honourably discharged out of \nthe dipshit tyrannical Army and mostly what I saw were friendly, helpful, \nhard-working people, always smiling. Over the course of roughly 4 years, \nCambodia lost an estimated 1-3 million people out of a population of 8 \nmillion. 25% of the population. Rwanda over the period of 100 days (100 \nDAYS for goodness sake), lost an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 out of a \npopulation of 7,3 million (though those in the know, say 800,000). Again, a \nstaggering 20% percent. These are not events that happened 100 years ago, \nor even 80, 70, 60 years ago. We are talking within the last 40 years! They \nare all rebuilding & repairing their psyche and have been ever since it \nhappened. We stupid westerners can't rebuild after losing a measly 4,000 & \ncontinue to drool over celebrities, styles, fashions, trends & 'beautiful' \npeople. Things that have NO bearing in the real world, or when it comes \ndown to brass tacks. And now our cultures have impacted & had shitty \ninfluence on the already worn out, stomped on, down trodden 'third world'. \nI sincerely hope, 100 years in the future (if humankind is still around) do \naway with these stupid, brainless contests & celebrity culture. And more so \nmoney, ideology, armies, police, corporations & governments.\n\nWhat the FUCK people....WAKE THE FUCK UP ALREADY! \ufeff",

That includes Muslims.Thirdly, you and I both know \nthat regular followers of the Islamic faith are about as supportive of \nterrorism as you and I would be of fundamentalist Hindu organisations. \nThey're people. Just like you. Or hopefully, a little better than you. \n\nYou sir, have taken an entire culture, an entire religion and crippled it \nto fit your own myopic view of what a 'Muslim' is. You're wrong. The \nproblem isn't 'them'. The problem is you, someone who is so eager to define \nan entire population by the precious little you think you understand. \nYou've acted with extreme intolerance , and if you think that the \nPartition, 1965, 1971 or Kargil justify your bias and racism, you are a \nmajor part of the problem.\n\nYou're mixing national and religious issues to such an extent that I'm \nconfused what your point is. You have no facts to support your view. Just \nracial bile. So why don't you get your facts straight before asking me to? \n\nAlso, just FYI: The Secretary of State for USA is not Condoleeza Rice. \nHasn't been for a long time.
