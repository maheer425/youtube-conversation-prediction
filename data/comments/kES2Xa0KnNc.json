During this period, for example, there \nwas massive expansion of education, medicine (even dissection was allowed), \npreservation and advancement of knowledge, like the systemic translations \nof ancient texts, which inspired men like Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon and \nRobert Grosseteste to further empiricism and the scientific method. \nAstronomy was particularly furthered during this period, starting with the \nCarolingian Renaissance. Many of today's premier universities were also \nfounded, including Bologna, Cambridge, and Oxford.

However, I believe that the \npoints of the cancer argument is that (1) cancer is no longer a 100% death \nsentence If treated promptly and managed. (2) It cost a lot of money to \nmanage, which typically, requires one to have insurance. (3) People who \nhave insurance are more likely to survive cancer, or extend their life \nexpectancy as opposed to those without insurance. \n\nFor example: I stated before, my grandfather had colon cancer, was treated, \nand lived well into advance age, dying of a condition unrelated to the \ncancer he was treated for years prior. I assert that he would not have been \nable to do this without being treated, and he would not have been able to \nreceive proper treatment if he did not have health insurance. \n\nStill, the more precise argument would be that due to factors in and beyond \nour control, the risk of sickness and injury is astronomically probable. \nTherefore everyone should be required to have insurance. \n\n",

And \nindeed, cancer treatment has significantly reduced the chances of one dying \nfrom cancer. Your assertion is just not up to par. \n\nBut lets put aside the cancer argument for the sake that it is a bad \ngeneralization. Instead, lets turn to what the conservative purpose of the \nAffordable Care Act is: reducing the rate of healthcare cost increases to \nthe rate of inflation. Why? Because healthcare cost, historically, have \nrisen faster than the rate of inflation, which in turn, caused premium \nincreases for all Americans thus making in affordable for many. \n\nTo archive this purpose, two main factors had to be addressed. (1) People \nwith out insurance were going to the E.R and not paying for services \nrendered. (2) The pool of people in the healthcare market needed to be \nincreased to, collectively, reduced cost (more people paying premiums to \ncontrol cross and subsidize coverage for others.) This is why the mandate \nwas created, to address these factors. And so far in has succeeded. 7.1 \nmillion people have singed up for plans on the exchanges because they don't \nwant the fine for not having insurance. According to the CBO, the rate of \nhealth care cost, for the first time, have risen at a rate historical of \ninflation. The CBO also states that the cost of premiums on the exchanges \nare stable, meaning that the consumers will not see a sharp price increase \nin the near future from insurance providers. If one were to look at the \nMassachusetts plan upon which the ACA was based, then you will find that \nthe rate of enrollment and the rate of healthcare cost in the state \ncorrelate to this same effect. \n\nNow I grant that the ACA is not the crown jewel of health care. Some people \nwill pay more for insurance, some people will pay less for insurance. This \nis because (1) Insurance has to cover more than it has had to do \nhistorically (another factor in controlling cost. (2) More people must be \ncovered by insurance (even people who were denied insurance in the past for \npreexisting conditions. (3) Our model is not a government based model (the \nACA is private insurance and thus ultimately it is up to them to set the \nprice of their plans, not the government.) \n\nWith this said, one would be hard pressed to not to conclude that, so far, \nthe ACA, like the plan it was modeled after, is on track to achieving its \nintended purpose: A stable health care market..

Some have done so through \nmarketplaces created by the law, some through other private insurance and \nothers through Medicaid, which has expanded under the law in about half the \nstates.\nThe tally draws from a review of state and federal enrollment reports, \nsurveys and interviews with insurance executives and government officials \nnationwide.\n\n\u2022 At least 6 million people have signed up for health coverage on the new \nmarketplaces, about one-third of whom were previously uninsured.\n\u2022 A February survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found 27% of new \nenrollees were previously uninsured, but newer survey data from the \nnonprofit Rand Corp. and reports from marketplace officials in several \nstates suggest that share increased in March.\n\u2022 At least 4.5 million previously uninsured adults have signed up for state \nMedicaid programs, according to Rand's unpublished survey data, which were \nshared with The Times. That tracks with estimates from Avalere Health, a \nconsulting firm that is closely following the law's implementation.\n\u2022 An additional 3 million young adults have gained coverage in recent years \nthrough a provision of the law that enables dependent children to remain on \ntheir parents' health plans until they turn 26, according to national \nhealth insurance surveys from the federal Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n\u2022 About 9 million people have bought health plans directly from insurers, \ninstead of using the marketplaces, Rand found. The vast majority of these \npeople were previously insured.\n\u2022 Fewer than a million people who had health plans in 2013 are now \nuninsured because their plans were canceled for not meeting new standards \nset by the law, the Rand survey indicates.",

                    "text": "+TheRetiredtrucker Youtube sensors my links.\n\nBut why don't you just look it up. A 1 year old can type in say, \n\"Affordable Care Act Statistics\" into Google search and find the numbers on \nhow many signed up for Medicaid, how many gained insurance, and how many \npeople lost insurance.\n\nIgnorance is never a valid defense to committing a crime.  \n\nBut, you want to know how many people paid, yet you are frustrated that no \ndata is available on how many people paid aka \"the deadbeat question\". Well \nthis is mainly because the market is based on demand and not payment; \nsupply and demand. Indeed the argument itself is premature as many people \nhave not even received their first premium bill, or have a payment due for \nanother 6 or so weeks. So it is just going to take some time to get a clear \npicture on the \"deadbeat question\" you seek to answer.\n\nNow I can tell you that the rates on the exchanges are based on this CBO \nprojections supplied to private insurance companies: How people would want \nplans on the exchange, this is the equation they sought to predict, but \nincluded in this prediction is the assumption that failure and/or late \npayments would occur because, of course and as you rightfully assert, this \nwould effect the stability of the exchanges. With this in mind, the CBO \nstates today as of 4/2/2014, that, with all their assumptions, the \nenrollment figures for the ACA would have to hover around 7 million in the \nfirst year for rates to be stable for the first year. And they give us \nprojections for next year and so on. Included is this number is a safety \nnet, a assumption that their will be some \"deadbeats\" out of this 7 \nmillion. So even if there is some percentage of \"deadbeats\" in the \nexchanges, as long as 7 million or so have selected plans, then one will \nnot see a sharp increase in prices this year. thus for now, no death \nspiral. Also note that built into the ACA are several provision that would \nslow or prevent several this perceived death spirals and other threats to \nthe ACA sustainability. Also note that the states and countries who have \nimplemented similar legislation have healthy health care exchanges.\n\nSo the \"deadbeat question\" is ether over exaggerated, or not really \nrelevant. It is not a silver bullet that will kill the ACA.   ",

When you bend, break, or \notherwise rig the rules so that you profit more, there will simply be less \nmoney for the actual work. \nYou saw this in Russia with the Sochi Olypmics that were the most expensive \nOlympics in history at $51 Billion.  Regardless of the details, Sochi was \nhardly the best organized Olympics ever.  That is the effect of \ncrony-capitalism: your incompetent friends get these opportunities to make \nmoney. \nThis is one of the major mechanisms that makes crony-capitalism inherently \nunsustainable.  And its only going to get worse...",
