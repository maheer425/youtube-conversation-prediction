Well I hate to say it but before you start talking about little \nmen from outer space or some escape by submarine there is one \" MOST LIKELY \nAND PROBABLE \" cause of his disappearance is that for some strange reason \nis a SHARK??? You know those big scary fish with sharp teeth that have been \nknown to attack man especially when swimming in area's like this guy was, \nDING DING DING!!!!! NOT going to be taken in by the fact that this was \nnothing more than a \"being in the wrong place at the wrong time event or \nMan vs. Shark and guess who won??? While the other stories after this one \nare strange and unusual this first one should be removed from the list and \nchalked up to a more down to earth event then supernatural. Or at least \nuntil proven otherwise not include this particular case in this manner.\ufeff",

On Sunday morning 17 December 1967 he and a neighbour, \nMarjorie Gillespie (his mistress), went to Point Nepean to watched the lone \nEnglish yachtsman Sir Alec Rose sail through Port Philip Bay Heads on his \nreturn journey to England. They were followed in a second car by Alan \nStewart with Gillespie's daughter Vyner, 20 and her friend, Robert Simpson, \n19. Despite the blustery, muggy conditions Holt wanted to swim at the \nprivate, exposed ocean at Cheviot Beach, rather than at one of the more \nprotected beaches in the bay. Holt changed into his swimming trunks and \nentered the surf shortly after midday. The four witnesses claim they saw \nHolt swimming out to sea when turbulent water suddenly built up around him \nand he disappeared. They called for help and one of Australia's largest \nsearch and rescue operations was mounted. By nightfall approximately 190 \npeople were searching for the prime minister. He was officially presumed \ndead on 19th December 1967. The search was scaled down on 22nd December and \nofficially terminated on 5 January 1968. Holt's body was never found. \n Stewart later said \"If Mr Holt can take it I had better go in, too.\" But \nbecause of the strong undertow Steward did not go out of his depth and \nreturned to the beach. So your suggestion that he was killed elsewhere \nand dumped in the ocean is ridiculous!",

I have been diving with all types of sharks in the Bahamas, the \ncoast of California and several other locations that gave me a first \nhand view as to the apex\" The  great white, down to reef, lemon, bull, and \njust about every other one in between. This is why I not only and still do \nown and run an auto repair shop for 20+ years but recently finished \nachieving one of my dreams in receiving my degree in marine biology. \nNOTHING PISSES ME OFF ANYMORE THAN people jumping to conclusions as to why \na shark attack or a possible shark attack means curtains for that species. \nWE are the visitors in THEIR world, and from the time you set foot into the \nwater their sensory skills are such that they know we are there and AT \nANYTIME WE COULD AND WOULD BE LUNCH for humans. They didn't survive for \nmillions of years by being mindless killers however people don't realize \njust how massive a great white can be to add that the biggest one I ever \nsay was 22ft. 6000+ lbs. and I was awestruck at the beauty of this animal \nthat was dead because of a shark net thus killing an innocent creature. WE \nARE NOT the masters of the water compared to them and until we respect that \nfact attacks can and will continue to happen I can say what happened to \nthis guy but My opinion is just that MY theory as to what might have \nhappened to him but it will probably never be known for sure.

The lag is most \nlikely due to you having too much open in your multi-tasking. The iPhone \n6/6+ does break easier than the ones before it, but that's because of size. \nCommon sense--the bigger the device, the easier to break. Your battery life \nis because of all of the extra crap that the iOS 8 software does. Simply \nturn it off. My iPhone 5 (that is over 2 or 3 years old now with 500+ \ncharge cycles and is jailbroken) can stay on 100% battery for a very long \ntime being inactive, while active it dies rather slowly.\n\nTry to think logically when you attempt to bash something.

Historically, the name refers \nto the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on \nMay 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, \nreligious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order \nof the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the \nmachinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without \ndominating them.\"[1] The Illuminati\u2014along with Freemasonry and other secret \nsocieties\u2014were outlawed through Edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles \nTheodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, \n1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was \nvilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they \ncontinued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\n",
