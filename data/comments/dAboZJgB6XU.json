With two \nregular magnets, you have to perfectly line them up to make 'em float. \nSuperconductors work like magic, as you can see in the video, and you could \njust have a line of electromagnets as your \"track\" turned on in very quick \nsuccession with no moving parts getting you moving at incredible speeds.\n\nI just read a story a few months ago by Greg Egan called \"Zero for Conduct\" \n(soon to be collected in *The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year \n\u2013 Volume 8*) where this Afghani high school girl in Iran develops the first \nroom-temperature superconductor.",
