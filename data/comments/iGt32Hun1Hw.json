I'm \nwondering how this can be since the whole reason the LDS church started was \nbecause Heavenly Father told Joseph Smith that the Christian Church was a \nfalse church that had lost the truth. President Hinckley even said that \nMormons believe in a different Jesus. \"In bearing testimony of Jesus \nChrist, President Hinckley spoke of those outside the Church who say \nLatter-day Saints 'do not believe in the traditional Christ.' 'No, I don't. \nThe traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I \nspeak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this the \nDispensation of the Fullness of Times. He together with His Father, \nappeared to the boy Joseph Smith in the year 1820, and when Joseph left the \ngrove that day, he knew more of the nature of God than all the learned \nministers of the gospel of the ages.'\" (LDS Church News Week ending June \n20, 1998, p. 7).",
