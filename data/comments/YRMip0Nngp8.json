They could pet here but \nonly a couple times so most times people would just pet her once and leave \nher be as she slept on their laps.  I figured she 'ran away' from her home \nbecause of the declawing and pain she had endured.  I'm very happy she \nfound me because I gave her the love and time to learn to be around me and \nothers without striking back.  I named her:  Sassy, the Cuddly Evil. :)  \nVery fitting for when she first came to me but she was a very loving cat \nafter a couple months.

As well as marking their turf with scent from the corner of their \nmouths a lot of cats have scent glands in their feet if I remember \ncorrectly. So given enough productive scratching spaces you shouldn't have \nto rip your cats finger tips off. The very tips, just like with humans has \nno feeling and just like if you cut back your fingernail too far, it will \nsting and bleed.

It is definitely a difference in \nculture, here in Europe most people do realize that declawing is a very \nnasty thing to do to a cat and thank god it is illegal. The real solution \nstarts with education i think. And of course sterilization. Must be a \nnightmare to try to safe cats in this horrible way.",

I \npersonally do not agree with it as there are other solutions, such as \ntraining or claw caps, that work effectively to solve problem scratching. \nThis is something I *always* work on training with cats in the shelter, \nbecause it is a big issue for many owners. I have even offered training to \nseveral adopters after the cats are in their new home to make sure they \nwere successful. You would not believe how many cats are turned into \nshelters daily for destructive clawing. Or they are just dumped off (we get \nlots of this where I live in the country). However, if it comes down to \ndeclawing with a good home versus death in a shelter... I'm sorry but I \nhave to choose life. And, unfortunately, that is what it comes down to for \nmany cats. :( That is my only point.\n\nMost shelters do take very good care of the animals in their custody. The \nemployees and volunteers are generally all animal lovers and will do \nwhatever they can to make these animals lives better and get them a home. \nHowever, with the sheer volume of animals turned in each day, it is a \nnearly impossible task. But, we always do our very best to get as many \nanimals adopted successfully (as in they do not get turned back in to \nshelters) as possible. I do not think the overpopulation issue is as bad in \nthe countries you mentioned. Close to 4 million pets are killed every year \nbecause of this epidemic. There is no way to house them all - and, sadly, \nit isn't much of a life for them living in a tiny cage. There are simply \ntoo many people irresponsibly allowing their pets to breed.",

                    "text": "Wow, you all are aggressive in attacking someone who doesn't believe the \nsame things you do. Do you really think this is the best approach to help \nsomeone learn the truth about declawing? Or to see the errors in their \nthought process on it?\n\nAs I have said in numerous comments, normally I do not agree with \ndeclawing, as I think alternatives should be exhausted before even \nconsidering it. However, under certain circumstances, I can't really be \nwhole-heartedly against it either. Let me try to explain. I volunteer in \nboth a kill shelter and a non-kill shelter. Both are packed well past \ncapacity with cats. A very low percentage of these babies ever get a chance \nat a new home; there are simply not enough people who care. Those who do \nare generally looking for a kitten or very young adult under the age of 1 \nor 2. The older cats just can't catch a break. One of the things I do is \ntrain cats on the basics (litter box, sitting, playing politely with other \ncats, leash training, grooming, and general manners) to make them more \nattractive to adopters. Problem is, we don't get enough people in to adopt \nall of them, no matter what we do to improve their chances. Furthermore, \none of the biggest reasons cats are dumped at our shelters is scratching \nand destroying someone's home.\n\nIn the no-kill shelter, we have cats that have been there for years. It is \nan opened space area so they are not constantly in cages, thankfully, but \nit is so sad to see them get passed over again and again. They have a \nforever home at the shelter but that is really no life for a cat. In the \nkill shelter, we have cats that have been there much longer than they \nnormally would be, thanks to my pleading and begging. But that can only go \nso far when there is nowhere to house them. Cats are still routinely killed \nevery week! We can't even get a decent amount of people to foster... let \nalone adopt. This is an epidemic on a national level in the United States - \nnot just my area. I live in a small rural town so I can imagine what the \nbig city shelters' see. So, this is where I have trouble with this topic. \nIs it fair to leave a cat in a shelter environment, knowing that it will be \nkilled, when it could be spoiled in a loving home? I'm sorry, but if it \nmeans a cat will be declawed, but have a good forever home, I cannot be \nagainst that. The life and treatment of the cat are more important. Would \nyou prefer they be killed? Yes, it is horribly tragic to have to choose \nbetween the two, but sadly it is a reality we face currently.\n\nPersonally, I have a cat with epilepsy, which is controlled with daily \nmedication. She is not a lap cat at all and does not like to be restrained \nin any manner (which we have to do to get the medicine down her throat - \nshe doesn't like any food but her dry food - no treats, soft food, or even \ntuna - so we can't sneak it into a treat), it scares her, so sometimes she \nsinks in her claws. I let her do it, it doesn't matter if she hurts me, as \nlong as it makes her feel safe, secure, and helps her take the medicine she \nneeds. I am usually covered in scratches from her but that's okay. The \npoint is, it isn't something I take lightly or would agree with for \nconvenience only. ",

People want them to be like a toy: Ready to \nplay and cuddle all the time, nice all the time, never messy, never \naggressive, never a real ANIMAL. If the cat is stressed, that doesn't mean \nthat the cat is bad. That means that the human is bad. You're the one to \nguarantee a good life to the cat, not the opposite. Declawing them is like \nto cut the thumbs to a person. Would you cut your own thumbs???? NO. You \nneed them.

I am usually \nan opponent of moral crusaders. People get totally worked up about a \ncause, which I feel is understandable in this case, but the way they go \nabout it only puts people off, which is counter-intuitive. This is what I \nwould say to someone who believes that cats can be declawed, and that many \nof them will suffer little to no long-term impacts on their lives. Cats \nare part of a group of animals known as digitigrades. This word comes from \nLatin, and it means \"toe-walker.\" They walk on their digits, or toes. In \nthe case of cats, they walk with over 60% of their weight on that end bone \nwhich is amputated during a declaw procedure. This forces them to shift \ntheir weight to the back of their paw, which is an unnatural way for them \nto walk. It can cause arthritis, and several other problems. In many cases, \nthe bone grows back, but in pieces or chips. This is extremely painful for \ncats, as the sharp pieces cut into surrounding tissue. As it is essentially \na foreign object, the bone pieces will become infected and surrounded by \npus, which makes its way into the bloodstream of the cat, causing liver and \nkidney damage. I'm glad you don't declaw your cats, but you should really \ntell other that it's wrong. Diabetes and being prone to infection is \nabsolutely no excuse to declaw a cat, because all you're doing is making \nthe cat more likely to bite. Bites are more likely to cause infection than \na scratch, and furthermore, increased aggression is a side-effect of \ndeclawing. If anything, someone with a compromised immune system has even \nMORE reason to keep the cat's claws intact. They can also clip the cat's \nnails, and even cover them with soft caps if they want. As Jackson Galaxy \nsaid, there is no reason to declaw a cat, ever. It is never in the interest \nof the cat to declaw, and there is always a solution to whatever problem \narises from the claws that can be implemented without declawing. There's \nalways a better solution.",

                    "text": "You have no idea what you're talking about. Millions of dogs and cats are \neuthanized because there are too many without homes. Spaying and neutering \nis done to prevent more homeless animals from being born into a life of \nneedless suffering. It's called stopping a problem before it starts. \nDeclawing means you are amputating ten or twenty separate limbs from a cat. \nThat's what it is, amputation, at least ten limbs cut off. A dog or cat can \nstill live a happy, pain-free life after being spayed/neutered. Cats are \noften severely traumatized by declawing, with a range of post-operative \ncomplications including behavior issues like refusing to use the litter box \nbecause it hurts their wounded feet, and increased biting. There is a high \nrisk of infection, because the amputation wounds frequently re-open. Once \ndeclawed, a cat is robbed of its primary means of defense, and its only \nmeans of escape from predators. They use their claws to defend themselves \nwhen attacked, and this buys them that split-second they need to run away, \nusually at which point their instincts tell them to climb a tree or a fence \nto escape. Without front claws, they can't climb at all. You should also \ntype the words \"phantom limb pain\" into Google, and see what comes up. Cats \nundoubtedly suffer from phantom limb pain, as human amputees do, but they \ncan't tell us that. Declawing is far more cruel than spaying/neutering, \ntrust me. There are multiple alternatives to declawing. As Jackson Galaxy \nsaid, declawing almost NEVER has to happen. There is one rare condition in \nwhich a cat will develop tumors on or near that terminal limb, and the only \nthing we can do, for now, is to amputate, but that's a very, very rare \ncondition, and even then, only the affected toes are amputated. That is the \nonly legitimate medical reason to declaw a cat. Otherwise, it's not \nnecessary. This campaign is not about shaming people, it's about educating \npeople, so they know what declawing really entails. If you didn't know what \nit really was before, and your veterinarian possibly misled you, or didn't \ngive you all the information, then you just didn't know. You can't change \nthe past, but now that you do know, you can make sure you never do it \nagain. You can also tell others about what it really is. Once you know more \nabout declawing, if you're still okay with it, that says something pretty \nbad about you, about your moral character.",

                    "text": "The problem is the declawing in and of itself can CAUSE future problems. A \nkitten may bounce back from the initial surgery a bit quicker than an adult \nor older cat, but they aren't spared from anything else. Without the claws, \nthe cats may honestly feel even less secure (they feel defenseless), and \nthe fighting may very well intensify. A cat that doesn't feel comfortable \nin itself and its environment will usually be much quicker to lash out. A \ncat in pain will almost always be quicker to lash out. Biting can be just \nas nasty, or even more so, than scratch marks.\n\nWhen he was talking about it changing their physiology, it changes the \nentire way their body supports weight. Rather than being up on tip-toe as \nthey are supposed to be, it forces them to stand slightly farther back than \nis normal. I don't know if you know much about horses or any hoofed \nanimals, but it's similar to overgrown hooves forcing horses to stand in \nunnatural positions, and eventually rendering them lame. It places stress \non areas of the joints that aren't mean to handle it. Sure, it may not be \ntoo bad once they adjust to it initially, but as they get older, years upon \nyears of unnatural positions WILL cause severe discomfort and pain, usually \nin the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, wrists, and/or ankles. Arthritis \nusually sets in faster, and more severely in declawed cats. The problem is \ncompounded by the fact that scratching things with their claws actually \nexercises the muscles in the paws and legs. A full bodied, luxurious \nscratch even more so. Without the exercise of normal scratching, the \nmuscles will weaken just the same as any other muscle.\n\nThere's risks in having the surgery done in and of itself, as with any \nmajor surgery. Admittedly a smaller risk, but a risk all the same, is that \nwith one small slip of the hand, one little mistake during the surgery, the \nveterinarian could potentially make the cat completely lame in that paw. It \nisn't common, but not completely unheard of for a vet to make a mistake and \nbasically ruin the entire paw. It doesn't take much. An infection setting \nin after the surgery can be a risk to the cat's paw, leg, and even \nlife-threatening if it progressed far enough.\n\nI hope this doesn't seem offensive, but in my opinion declawing is just \nanother way for saying \"I don't want to fix the actual issue at hand. I \nwould rather mutilate and (again in my unforgiving opinion) essentially \nphysically and mentally torture my cat than work through an issue.\" To me, \nit sounds as though you need to be working on getting the two cats to get \nalong. I would highly recommend watching some of Jackson's My Cat From Hell \nepisodes. He gives many wonderful tips to helping two cats get along \nbetter. Try some of them out, any of them, until you find something that \nworks for your cats. If you can help the cats co-exist, then the need for \ndeclawing is null. Your cats will be a thousand times happier, you'll be \nhappier, and on the bright side of it, you'll save money and the torment of \nwatching the cats in extreme pain after the surgery when they're too sore \nto even stand, and the frustration when it doesn't fix a single thing, or \npossibly even makes things worse. Declawing is not reversible. Please don't \ndo something that you, and your cats, will regret for the rest of their \nlives.",

But, even then, cats want to be touched, they are \njust afraid of it. However, I do agree that not all cats are lap cats. My \nPersian, for example, hates to be held or restrained. He has hated it since \nhe was a tiny kitten. He is very loving otherwise and loves full body \nmassages. So, I agree to his terms on that and don't do what he dislikes. \nAny relationship with an animal, of any kind, needs to be on their terms.\n\nI strongly disagree that a person does only gets scratched when they push \nthings too far. You can get them in multiple ways that are unintentional; \nfor instance, by a cat jumping off your lap, a cat playing too rough, and \nmany other ways.\n\nI am not pro-declawing, by any means, yet I am not fully against it either. \nOne of the shelters I volunteer at is a kill shelter. I see cats turned in \neveryday for scratching issues. Unfortunately, our take-in rate is much \nlower than the adoption rate, so cats with these types of issues are often \neuthanized.

First of all, de-clawing directly \nimpacts the quality of life for a cat, whereas the spaying and neutering of \nan animal, as far as short term physiological and psychological effects \ngoes, only stops their yearning for genetic propagation and the obvious \nability to do so.

Now, I have 3 cats currently, so it would cost me around $39 \nevery 2 months or so. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but many \npeople just couldn't realistically  afford it. Many also have far more than \n3 cats as well. In my area, a declaw costs between $100 to $120, which \ncomes out to considerably less overall.

I \ndon't even trim my cats' nails because it's unnecessary - I live in a small \napartment, and raise my cats inside and still, nothing gets destroyed. I \ntaught my cats with the basic techniques and they know it's wrong and \nthat's it. My secret it's cardboard boxes, they have three or four that \nthey can play inside, scratch, destroy, do whatever they feel like, and \nreplace them every other week when it's too damaged. Yeah, I have to clean \nway more often because of all the pieces around the house, but they keep \ntheir nails.

Both males and females have just a 1cm incision and \nby the time the pain relief has worn off there is no pain - and no unwanted \nkittens. Neutered cats also have longer life expectancies. A de-clawed cat \nis not just inconvenienced for a couple of days like a cat being neutered, \nit is mutilated and suffers for the rest of its life - no defence, no way \nto escape, altered gait and its associated problems and unable to even \nscratch an itch.
