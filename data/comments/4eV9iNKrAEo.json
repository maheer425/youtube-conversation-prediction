This \nchanges from each city.\n so (6th) 7th and 8th are considered middle school/ Jr. High school\n then there is high school where the average (9th grader) Freshman is 14.\n then sophomore (10th grade)\n then junior (11th grade)\n then senior(12th grade) average graduation age is 18. \n then you go on to college and bla bla bla...",
