                "text": "Hello,\n        My name is not important. But as a viewer of your videos I have to \nsay, your apology is accepted. However, to an extent. If I had a pie chart \nit would be this. Acceptance 1% Not really giving a shit 99.99%. Here is \nwhy. I am glad to see you take responsibility on your actions on \nthanksgiving day. I will give you that much so 1up mushroom for 0 lives. I \ndigress lets talk about the 99.99% shall we. Get ready find anything \noffensive, sorry I can say it no apologies. First off, your father should \nhave been the first to hear an apology. Not your mother. Why you may ask? \nHe just asked you to get a job. Just flat out apply to a mcdonalds if you \nhave to. Now I may not know how this started on thanksgiving day. \nDigression is kicking in again, all these videos have been about you and \nyour father. Mainly your father saying get out and get a job. He has a GOOD \nPOINT!!!! Because in life, you have to have a plan b. Here's the bee sting, \nthe odds aren't always in your favor. However you are blessed with these \nthings. 1)A College degree. Do you know how many people have to quit school \nbecause they couldn't afford to go?! I'm 19 going on 20. I go to college, \nwork at a pizza joint, volunteer at a theatre to learn how to BECOME A \nPROFESSIONAL STAGE MANAGER (albeit I didn't have to go to school but if I \nwanted to keep a job in that field.) and find shows to be known. Now half \nof my family isn't around and or we talk on occasions, my tuition is in the \ntoilet, I don't get paid much, and finding good PAYING shows is hard to \ncome by IN NEW JERSEY!!! My relationship ended with someone, and I have car \ninsurance to pay the next is my HEALTH INSURANCE!!! And even with all this, \nI still drag my sorry ass off of the sealy every morning and drag my face \nin the raping machine for one more day not knowing when it's my time to \nflash those cosmic car key at those pearly gates. 2) a girlfriend. Now it \nmay seem like an attack on me or jealousy. Your relationship with her is \nlike watching an episode of King of Queens. Cause if I was her and being \nthe type of \"man\" you are, I would see other people. Sorry, I'm a douche \nlike that. 3) Parents! Lord, please repent me for what I am about to say. \nThey fucking give you EVERYTHING. Car, video games (platforms came from \nyour mother and some your father), roof over your head, food to eat, \nclothes on your back, the whole 9 yards. Hell, my parents drive me crazy. \nMy father talks more to me than my mother. But at the end of the day, AS AN \nADULT, I give back to them. Cause who knows what may happen. Now you my \nfriend Veruca Salted your parents in everyone of your videos, bitched about \nhaving a college degree in a field that you CAN get a JOB in, and whined \nabout not getting a Christmas present. Kudos to your father and brother I \nwant to shake hands with them really I do. They are showing the world and \nyou the error in your thinking. And quite frankly, I'd boot you out of the \nhouse with that Tommy Wiseau anger filled table throwing you did. It's \nuncalled for, disrespectful, and down right too late. An apology should \nhave been made to your WHOLE FAMILY! not just them. Two welcome to the 99% \nwe have been expecting you. In life you have to work for things. Not just \nplay video games. I know being a pro gamer is a dream. Hell I wish to be a \npro gamer in pokemon. However, I can't put my hopes in that. I will not pay \nmy bills. So do more with your life instead of what you are doing now. And \nas for a Chirstmas present. Your father has a good point. You don't deserve \none. Not one but a kick in the ass. Now that you don't have to wrap up and \nput in a box but you DID ASK for a present. However if my ears deceive me, \nyou said \"You HAVE to get your CHILD something.\" You my friend are no \nchild. But accommodations could be made. Want to be treated like an adult, \nAct like one. You are no child. However, You are a manchild. Grow a pair, \nwipe your tears, drink some bitter water, brush your teeth, wash your face, \nstraighten up, fly right and cool down fucker don't you blow your top. *Drops \nmic exits stage left*   \ufeff",
