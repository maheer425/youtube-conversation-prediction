Fission of uranium breaks the nucleus apart, reducing the number \nof nucleons. \"Fission\" of a hydrogen atom would involve breaking the quarks \napart. The difference is that the attraction between two nucleons is a \nresidual, sort of shielded, bit of strong interaction. So, this force is \nmuch weaker than the force holding the quarks together. Which is why it's \npossible to fise uranium but not hydrogen (okay, while technically \n/possible/, highly impractical energetically difficult).\n\nWhat's more, U235 (the uranium used in nuclear weapons) does not undergo \ndecay by ejection of a simple proton.

If the puck spins fast enough you can hold \nup the mass below the table, and if there were no friction, so there would \nbe no loss in energy, you would be able to keep the puck spinning, and the \nmass dangling without it falling down due to gravity =D I hope I explained \nthat so you can imagine it xD I just thought it was cool you could have two \nforces working on two objects constantly without any energy being converted \nat all, it all stayed the same and no work is done.",

Though I guess it would be disappointing if the \nbiggest mysteries to the universe where easy to comprehend.\n\nWe only understand physics after the smallest fraction of a second after \nthe big bang, when the universe first started to expand. We're fuzzy on the \ndetails, but this is the part of the big bang we know happened.\n\nBefore then, at time=0, we don't know what happened because our equations \nbreak. We can't divide by zero for instance.\n\nThe classical model of the big bang just assumes that, as we play back \ntime, nothing special happened and everything just continued to compress \ninto a singularity.\n\nSince that's the part of the big bang we don't know about, modifications to \nthe big bang theory (such as The Big Bounce) propose we might not have \nreached a singularity.\n\nEither way, we say with reasonable confidence that from the first moment in \ntime, energy existed. Perhaps it's easier to imagine The Big Crunch \ninstead, where time would die.\n\nIt might be more intuitive to imagine how energy wouldn't somehow cease to \nexist the moment before time stopped, it would happen at the same time.",

Then it began to expand. \n\nYou are saying time started when the big bang happened...so...at the point \nwhere it begins to expand is where time begins????\n\nis that what you're saying? cause it seems to lead my mind to the logical \nconclusion that all the matter in the Universe was a small speck for a \ncertain amount of time before it expanded. So that would mean we have to \npush back the origin of time to right before the expansion started. since \nnothing can change with out time.\n\nSo time must have come first or else things just don't change (exspand). \nUnless maybe the expansion of the Universe and time happened at the same \ntime (As you say the Initial condition) Of course how time and the big bang \nhappened at the same time before time was a thing is still a maddening \nthought to wrestle with/ Also the big bang can't be the initial Condition \nand at the same time have a beginning...at least i wouldn't think since \n(initial Condition) would imply some sort of eternal state that always is \nand has never changed.

Keep going and the result could be single black hole that \nhas precipitated all matter and energy in the universe into de-spatialized \nenergy.\n\nIn other words, the universe may have no outside and even no inside.

If that energy would be taken \nout of it, there would be nowhere else for the energy to go.  It would \nexist in the form of a purely massive area of condensation too dense for \nanything to exist outside of it, including light.\n\nIn effect, therefore, the universe would really have no 'outside' or \n'space,' generally.
