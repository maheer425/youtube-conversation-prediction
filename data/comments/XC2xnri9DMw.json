Incredibly conceited arrogant hypocrites.\n\nPut down the mythical ancient \"holy\" books and the various make-believe \ngod(s) and demons that supposedly inspired these books. Instead, use your \nbrain....make intelligent decisions, be moral for it's OWN sake, and last \nbut not least....do your part to help liberate the minds of your fellow \ncult members...I mean, religious folk. Stop pandering to their insane \nbeliefs. Stop pretending such people aren't bat-shit crazy. Start calling \nit out for what it actually is. Let's stop with all the politically correct \nwalking on eggshells around the religious. They SHOULD be offended. They \nSHOULD be made to feel stupid. People need to be given a harsh dose of \ntruth to snap them out of their various cults.\n\nAs a former born-again Christian myself, I'm grateful to the people that \ncalled out by bullshit beliefs. It hurt at the time....but later on I was \ngrateful they didn't handle me with kid gloves. I'm glad certain people had \nthe courage to tell me my beliefs were immoral and insane. It lead me to \ntruly investigate the validity of my beliefs. Once I did that, it was \ninevitable that I'd let go of religion entirely. There's no other sane \nalternative. I'm SO much happier, ethically-minded, mentally healthy, \nempathetic, and educated now that I've let go of the greatest evil that \never infested humanity....religion.\n\nReligion truly does poison EVERYTHING....especially your OWN mind.

The word was already \npopularized (infamously). Why not call it Mindgamesism or something less \ncontroversial instead of redefining a word that already means \"chief spirit \nof evil and adversary of God; tempter of mankind; master of Hell\".\n\nAnd as for the reliability of Wikipedia, at least I read the summary before \nposting an opinion.

The Loch Ness monster, Ghosts, precognition, ley lines and all that \nkind of stuff are not necessarily Deistic in nature so believing in them \ndoes not automatically stop someone being an Atheist. Paranormal beliefs \nthat are Deistic in nature might mean someone is Agnostic instead.\n\nA person can be superstitious and an Atheist just like a Religious person \ncan be totally sceptical about everything apart from their belief in \nGod(s). According to a Gallup poll apparently 31% of the Atheists polled \nexpressed a belief in the paranormal or supernatural with only 8% of the \npeople that activity attended some form of worship admitting a belief in \nthe paranormal/supernatural, (saucy \nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122178219865054585)\n\nI know you want to believe in the ideal that all Atheists are total and \nabsolute rationalists, I am not saying this mockingly either because its \nhard to reconcile Atheists disbelieving in sky wizards and magical \ncarpenters turning water into wine and then turning around and believing in \nghosts. Believers in the paranormal will often resort to pseudo science in \nan attempt to rationalise their beliefs like the Creationists do.\n\nSo yes I get why you are thinking the way you are but it simply isn't true, \nAtheists can be and are superstitious and believe in the paranormal. If you \nwant to argue that Atheists *shouldn't* believe in the paranormal that \nargument would have legs but its another discussion for another time and is \nvery different from stating that your view on what Atheism *cannot* be in \nthis discussion.",

                    "text": "Joseph Stalin was raised to be a Catholic Priest and I remain curious as to \nwhy his Christianity is shoved aside in all these arguments. Yes, there is \nno way to get around the fact that in his early career, Stalin made a vast \neffort to rid Russia of religion, but that had nothing to do with atheism. \nIt was the only way he knew to seize power of the country.\n\nFor generations the entire populace of Russia had been taught that the head \nof state was supposed to be close to god. At the time in question, the head \nof the church in Russia was a tyrant. The Russians were already disposed to \nservility and all Stalin did was exploit these two facts, and place himself \nin the position of god. Once Stalin was firmly seated in office, he revived \nthe Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the \nwar effort. Stalin was part of a council convened to elected a new church \nPatriarch. Then the Russian theological schools were opened, and thousands \nof churches began to function. Even the Moscow Theological Academy Seminary \nwas re-opened, after being closed since 1918.\n\nSo, while Stalin was no peach, he was not exactly what you would call a \ndied-in-the-wool atheist. He was more a secular minded religious \nopportunist, which is a personal character trait. He did not use atheism to \ngain control, but religious principles that were modified to fit his own, \nsick and twisted method of revolution.\n\nWhat about Pol Pot?\n\nTruly a monster, having killed some twenty-five percent of the entire \npopulation of Cambodia. Pol Pot targeted not just different religions, but \neducation, science and medicine in his quest for total domination. Now, \nlet's take a head count of atheists who are against education, science and \nmedicine. Thought so\u2026 Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge were composed of Buddhists and \nPol Pot was a Theravada Buddhist. He studied at a Buddhist monastery and \nthen at a Catholic school for 8 years. Cambodia's communism was influenced \nby Theravada Buddhism.\n\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk said, \"Pol Pot does not believe in God but he \nthinks that heaven, destiny, wants him to guide Cambodia in the way he \nthinks it the best for Cambodia, that is to say, the worst. Pol Pot is mad, \nyou know, like Hitler.\"\n\nSo, while Pol Pot was definitely not a Christian, he was also definitely \nnot an Atheist.\n\nLet's get on with some Mass Murder, shall we?\n\nAdd up the deaths that were attributed to Hitler, Stalin and Pot. Then \nround up for good measure. You can safely say that the number is \nstaggering. Probably upwards of fifteen million. However, consider the \nfollowing conflicts where the only differences between the opposing \nfactions were and are religion:\n\nAlbigensian Crusade, 1208-49\nAlgeria, 1992-\nBaha'is, 1848-54\nBosnia, 1992-95\nBoxer Rebellion, 1899-1901\nChristian Romans, 30-313 CE\nCroatia, 1991-92\nEnglish Civil War, 1642-46\nHolocaust, 1938-45\nHuguenot Wars, 1562-1598\nIndia, 1992-2002\nIndia: Suttee & Thugs\nIndo-Pakistani Partition, 1947\nIran, Islamic Republic, 1979-\nIraq, Shiites, 1991-92\nJews, 1348\nJonestown, 1978\nLebanon 1860 / 1975-92\nMolucca Is., 1999-\nMongolia, 1937-39\nNorthern Ireland, 1974-98\nRussian pogroms 1905-06 / 1917-22\nSt. Bartholemew Massacre, 1572\nShang China, ca. 1300-1050 BCE\nShimabara Revolt, Japan 1637-38\nSikh uprising, India, 1984-91\nSpanish Inquisition, 1478-1834\nTaiping Rebellion, 1850-64\nThirty Years War, 1618-48\nTudor England\nVietnam, 1800s\nWitch Hunts, 1400-1800\nXhosa, 1857\nArab Outbreak, 7th Century CE\nArab-Israeli Wars, 1948-\nAl Qaeda, 1993-\nCrusades, 1095-1291\nDutch Revolt, 1566-1609\nNigeria, 1990s, 2000s\nIf you add up all of the lives that were lost in the name of one religion \nor another, you come up with a staggering figure that is in excess of \neight-hundred-million.

Moreover, many believe that these books \nprecisely define god as 'all-powerful' or 'all-knowing'. In reality, most \nof the books in the bible show very little concern in 'describing' god and \nmuch more ink is used in explaining how god - and other myths - are useful \nto the difficulties presented in the author's society and time.\nAs for 'god's power', considering only the early writings in the NT (Mark's \ngospel  and the authentic epistles of Paul), it seems as if the 'adversary' \nhas control over the present age, but when god intervene that will change. \nUnfortunately, these ideas are not explicitly exposed and can only be \ninferred from the text, hence, lots of conflicting interpretations. Still, \nthe most accepted view (among scholars) is that jesus believed that god had \nthe ultimate power, but, for some unknown reason, gave away control over \nearth to the forces of evil until the 'return of the son of man' or some \nother apocalyptic moment, when god would assert his power.\nStill, god's power would have always been absolute in the sense that the \ndevil would have no power to stop god, when god decided to act.

The eastern orthodox \nchurch finally asked the pope for assistance in defending themselves. After \na successfull campaign they were able to recapture land that had been taken \nfrom them.

There are however cases \nwhere one might consider an abortion. Incest for one. Not just on a moral \nlevel, but on a practical level, it isn't fair to bring someone into the \nworld that cannot function on the most basic level. If I was in a position \nwhere I was pissing, drooling and shitting myself and couldn't say two \ncoherent words, I don't think that would be a good life to live out. If you \nare born blind, deaf, mentally retarded on a functioning level or autistic, \nyou can still have a decent life. Its when it gets to a point where you \ncan't function on the most basic level that is disturbing. That also goes \nhand in hand with a drug user. Then there is the rape situation. If a woman \nwas raped should she be forced to carry out a pregnancy? Can you imagine \nhow violated you would feel. Or the shock and horror that you could bring \nsuch a savage human being into this world? What about medical \ncomplications? If you do have an abortion, you will most definitely live, \nbut the child will die.Then there comes the possibility that both the woman \nand the child could die. What then is the solution to the woman who doesn't \nhave self value that produces eight children? What is the practical moral \nsolution in that case? We don't live in a society where they typical family \nunit is self sustaining on a farm anymore. That is part of what makes the \nHoly Bible obsolete. The Holy Bible places woman as second class citizens. \n\" And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, \nand replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of \nthe sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that \nmoveth upon the earth.\" - Genesis 1:28.... This implies that we should \ndrain the world of all its resources, over populate the world to a point \nwhere we can't take care of our children then pollute everything that is \nprecious on this earth. In modern day, to have a strong family, is two have \none to three kids. Beyond that, you simply cannot sustain a strong future \nfor that kid. Which gets into the next point. Contraception... A holy man \nis going to walk into a village and tell them that condoms are morally \nwrong. Spreading disease does along with unplanned pregnancy does not make \na strong society. It just doesn't. Should we teach contraception or just \nhave entire groups of people that starve and cannot sustain themselves? In \ncultures where woman are taught to value there independence and there \npotential, they produce less children and are able to provide more for \ntheir offspring. The Bible didn't plan on this. The Bible did not foresee \nthat one day we would have  much more complex societies that would have \ninstitutions to raise children in a family unit where both parents worked.\nA world where woman were teachers, leaders and maybe even one day the \npresident. The Bible clearly talks against this. Its not to say that there \naren't circumstances where an abortion isn't morally wrong. The problem \nwith religion still remains with the us vs. them mentality which carries \nonto the modern day in a terrifying way. ",

Both of these types of people are in \nthe bible and are both considered relatively equal since they both reject \nGod.\n\nSatanists #1 - Worshipers of the Devil. Basically all the devil evil \ncannibal murdering rapist people go here along with some super duper \nagainst God but still not atheist people.\n\nSatanists #2 - People who believe that they are their own Gods. The major \ndifference between Atheist and Satanist here is that Atheists have a lack \nof belief in God based on a lack of evidence. Satanists claim that we are \nall \"Gods\" and basically to quote assassins creed \"nothing is true, \neverything is permitted\" BUT in the most literal sense possible\n\n They believe that everything you do is simply an action, a chemical \nprocess in the brain, and nothing more, EVER (atheists do to but also \nacknowledge the psychology and philosophy which helps determine bad stuff \nfrom good stuff).\n And they accept the Christian argument that without God there is no moral \njudgement but instead of fearing it, they embrace that idea as the excuse \nto do anything they feel like doing. Which in some cases is a decent life \nand in others its mass murder.\n\nOften Christians attack Atheists because of just how close they are to \nSatanist #2 and basically equate the two. The 1% difference however, makes \nthe two distinct. More often than not, an Atheist would go by evolutionary \nideas + societal law at the time in order to live amongst humanity and \nevolve with it. Satanists on the other hand, don't give a shit. \n\nReally when it comes down to it, the amount of fucks you give on humanity \nand its opinions determines whether you are an Atheist of Satanist.",

                "text": "Now before I say anything, I want to make it very clear that the Bible and \nALL text written about the Christian god and the Christian satan are no \ndifferent to me than the texts over the Greek gods. They are all mythology \nto me, and I see them as literature rather than fact.\nThat being said, I have read many different kinds of texts that paint \nLucifer (Satan) in a very sympathetic light. For example, in John Milton's \nParadise Lost, Lucifer is shown as defiant to God, but not in the way \nChristians typically tell it. Lucifer doesn't want to be subjugated. Anyone \ncan relate to that feeling. No one wants to be told what to do all the time \nor be forced to be \"under\" someone else forever. He sees God as a tyrant \nand thinks all angels should rule as equal gods, which is why he leads a \nrebellion against his creator. \nTo answer your question, Cenk, of why some worship Satan, I point to \nliterature such as Milton's. Who do you think is more relatable in this \nstory? God or Lucifer? The obvious answer is Lucifer. So when people decide \nto worship Satan rather than God, perhaps this is their mindset. That God \nis a tyrant and Lucifer was just trying to fight for equality.\ufeff",

You love to base Christianity on the actions \nof crusaders 1000 years ago yet you are quick to defend Satanists who \ncommit murder in the name of satan. Your hypocrisy is only eclipsed by the \nstupidity contradictory nature of your statement that you are not a \nSatanist but somehow know what it's all about. You can't put lipstick on a \npig. No mater how pretty Satanist try to crack it up to be, Satanism is \nnothing but pure evil. it goes against God, the source of all goodness. Now \nsome faggots would claim that Satanism has nothing to do with the Biblical \ndevil. Then why use his name, dumb faggots? I sincerely hope that every \nsingle Satanist defender alive is ritually killed and sacrificed by a \nSatanist. That would be a good fucking riddance.",
