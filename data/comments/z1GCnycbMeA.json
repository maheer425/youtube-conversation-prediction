Heisenberg had already talked about this domain of \"Potentia\" which \nis outside space and time but Einstein couldn't quite grasp it at that \ntime. Non locality was verified in the Physics laboratory in 1982 and then \nhumans in 93-94. It was all these quantum experiments that made all this \nquantum magic come to life. It would have been very difficult for these \npioneers even thought they suspected that philosophy of physics is due for \na great paradigm shift. Schr\u00f6dinger declared I am this whole world, cosmic \nconsciousness, but not in connection with his work. His work, was brought \ndown to the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat which never could solve. Only Von \nNeumann said yes consciousness is the answer but couldn't raise above a \ndualistic view of consciousness. He wasn't radical enough to think \nconsciousness was the ground of being. Eugene winger, suspected the same \nthing but couldn't be radical and go far enough to recognize that \nconsciousness is cosmic not individual choice and got bogged down in his \nown paradox and could not solve it. You see the struggle these people went \nthru. These guys knew a radical shift in which we do science is coming.",

But if they are so close that \ntheir wave functions overlap, then as they are identical, I can not \ndistinguish which is on the left and which is on the right.  NOW they are \nentangled, and described by a two particle wave function.  If I now move \nthem apart, they are still described by a two-particle wave function, as \nlong as I don't interact with either particle.  Now if I perform a \nmeasurement on one electron, determining that it is spin up, this also \ntells me that the other electron is spin down.  More than obvious logic (if \nI start with two marbles, black and white, and check to see that one is \nblack, then the other must be white), I also, by doing a measurement on one \nelectron, determine the axis in which \"up\" and \"down\" is defined!  This \ninformation is transmitted to the second electron, as the two particles are \npart of the same wave function.  This is the 'spooky action at a distance,' \nand great care must be taken to avoid messing with the electrons until you \nare ready to do the measurement (that is, to avoid decoherence).

You're actually smarter than Rick McDick's douche \ncomment implies. If you are having trouble understanding this then \ngood. Stephen Hawking has trouble understanding this. The problem that many \nphysicist have with this example, like you are having, is that this theory \nworks on the microscopic level and not the Macroscopic level like cats and \nbombs. On a microscopic level, take 2 identical atoms of the same element, \ntheir electrons will spin around the nucleus. In quantum physics, it is \nsafe to say that the position of the electron will never be in the same \nposition or opposite position. However, if you freeze atom A, it is safe to \nsay that whenever you freeze Atom B it will never be in the same position \nor opposite position of atom A. \n\nnot sure if this is right, but don't be a douche like Rick and just accept \neverything you hear and see on youtube.",
