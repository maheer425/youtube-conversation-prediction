That's what it was intended to be, a movie, not a movie \nlength porno. The reason why there's a lot of sex is because that's what \nactually happened in real life. A lot of us think we can act, but really \nyou have to have the whole package to be able to act well (at least like \nLeonardo). Try this, go look at yourself in the mirror and act out \nsomething. Do you think you're cut out to be an actor? And scenes are being \ndone over and over again so you have to maintain it too.. ",

He also said they also actually toned some things down a \nlittle. Therefore in no way was this film glorified. Leo said he made this \nfilm to expose the this culture and how greed and excess can destroy \npeople. It is a cautionary tale. He made it with noble intentions. \nObviously most people including myself don't agree with how these \ncharacters behaved but I think that's the point. If you see the movie in \nthe right light you will be able to see how brilliant his performance \nwas. Leo is an actor (therefore his character is not who he is) and he \ntakes on roles that will challenge him. Not safe roles that will be a \nguaranteed box office hit. If you are uncomfortable watching it that is \nperfectly understandable, a lot of people are easily offended but this film \nwas not a porno . It had nudity yes but it was a true story of a man who \nactually lived like that. I think some people are just uncomfortable with \nthe truth sometimes.",

Think about it, his best chance of \nwinning an Oscar was probably last year for the Wolf of Wall Street. Don't \nget me wrong, he's great in that film, but you also have to contemplate the \nfact that people like Matthew Mcconaughey and Chiwetel Ejiofor were \nnominated as well for the Oscar. Mcconaughey was the deserved winner of \nthat year; he was exceptional in Dallas Buyers Club, like truly \noutstanding. The same applies to Ejiofor to Twelve Years a Slave. He gave, \nin my opinion, the second best performance of the year. You also have \nChristian Bale with his incredible performance in American Hustle. So, \nreally, Dicaprio was up against stiff competition and, in the end, he was \nunlucky to be put up against such great actors. Ultimately, however, he \ndidn't deserve to win the Oscar that year.",

Do you realize that just \nbecause you depict something in a film doesn't mean that you approve of it? \nTo the contrary, you might even criticize what you're showing (or do you \nthink for example that Schindler's list is a nazi propaganda film?). The \nWolf of Wall Street is based on the memoirs by Jordan Belfort and the film \nis pretty faithful, so I'm sorry to tell you, but it just happens that \nthose guys in the film were greedy, homophobic drug and sex addicts who \ndidn't give a shit about their wifes (or anyone for that matter). Actually, \nJordan Belfort stated that the events in real life were even worse. Anyone \nwith a decent moral compass will realize, just like you, that Belfort is a \ndespicable human being. Life isn't a Disney film and many people do \nterrible things, deal with it. It's the new film by arguably the greatest \nliving filmmaker, very well-made and with great performances and that's all \nyou have to say?\nWhat's next? Criticizing a film about Hitler for being antisemitic or a \nfilm about slavery because it's racist towards black people? I think \nEllen's able to judge for herself if she thinks the film is sexist and/or \nhomophobic and especially, if that's the case, what the film tries to say \nwith it. She just happened to have come to a different conclusion than you.\nThe fact that you \"feel horrible\" and couldn't stop watching is kind of a \ncompliment for the film. The main problem with the film is rather that it \ndrags and isn't that engaging because it's hard to care for such awful \nhuman beings.",

Mcconaughey won, rightly so, but second would have easily been \nEjiofor because he was outstanding; not to mention Christian Bale for his \nstunning performance in American Hustle as well. He was very close to \nwinning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Django Unchained and an \nargument could definitely be made for that. However, Christoph Waltz killed \nit in that film and he won the Oscar which was the right decision. DiCaprio \nhas simply been unlucky each year as he's put up against phenomenal actors.",
