In a known \narea where there's been trouble we do night watches just like we were \nsailing, except we're at anchor with big machetes, air horns, and massive \nspot lights.  We have been boarded twice (once in Indonesia, and once in \nthe Solomon Islands) but both times we could scare them off before they \nstole too much.  The creeps always come out at night!
