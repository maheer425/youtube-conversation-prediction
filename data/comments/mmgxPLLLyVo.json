And as a Korean listening \nto the lyrics of the song, it comes differently to those who listen to the \nsong and reading the translation of the song. Anyway, this would just \ncontinue the argument.. This whole thing started not because if \nmisinterpretation of the song but because everybody has their own views \nabout songs or poems. I would like to say sorry if I hurt your feeling as a \nfan of the bts bug that doesn't mean that I totally agree with you.",

They are simply saying not to let it control you. \nIt's good to value education, but it's also about finding something you \nlove to do for the rest of your life. Yes you need the finances but does \neveryone succeed in becoming educationally successful? No. Everybody has a \njob and wants a good one. My whole point here is that you should chase your \ndreams too and that my idol oppas are not encouraging anyone to rebel \nagainst school. Like I said, they value education deeply. It is a part of \nnot just the Asian culture, but others as well. With all due respect, why \nwould you ask her that if you don't even know her at all? For all you know \nshe can do most of those things or maybe even all. What if she planned to \nbe just like them and that you're one of those people who shut her down? I \nunderstand that you might have not done it on purpose, but that's what you \ncame off as. But you're right though. Education is important. I completely \nagree with you on that. But you can't let it control you. You can do both. \nChasing your dreams all while getting a full education. That's what most of \nthe idols are doing. ",

He is currently 20 turning 21. In this MV his birthday was just 2 \ndays away (Sept. 12, 1994), so that makes him 18. \n\n0:19 is their dancing machine, Jung Hoseok or J-Hope. He is also one of the \nproducers of their songs. He serves as the rapper and dancer of their \ngroup. He and Rap Monster are the same age. He is the 3rd oldest in the \ngroup.He was only 19 in this MV, but currently he just turned 21. His \nbirthday is on Feb. 18, 1994.\n\n0:21 is their speed rapper, Min Yoongi or SUGA.

A wave of dread washed over him as he \ntook a deep breath, it was reaping day. Even that one second of ignorant \nbliss seemed so far away.\nReaping day was here... again. The day he had been dreading every year \nsince he was twelve. Since he was twelve, he had been forced to pretend he \nwas a girl, due to the majority of girls in district twelve, so it was much \nless likely for him to be picked. His real name was JungKook, but had taken \non Kookniss as a facade. He loved his mom but he wished she wouldn\u2019t force \nhim to be a girl, but she did love him a lot, and that was why she forced \nhim to do that in the first place. His little brother, Jimin, was forced to \nact like a girl as well, taking on the name of Jimrose. '\n\nIt's so random I can't wait to bring in 'TAELE' Taehyung gale XDDD",

It's about not living in the confides of \nsomeone else's (i.e your parents or teachers) expectations because that's \nwhat they did; not pushing your personal ambitions aside to say \"It'll \nhappen one day\" when you can say \"I can make it happen now.\"\nA lot of people (including myself) have had experiences in school where \nthey feel their being oppressed or pressured because, somewhere along the \nline, school became less about your ideas/hopes/dreams/creative aspirations \nand actual learning, and more about rote memorization and competition. I \nthink a lot of the song speaks towards that issue. \ufeff",

There are \nsimilarities between every school system, but there's no doubt that Korea \nhas a more strict system than most which, I would assume, would add a lot \nof extra pressure in accompaniment to the pressure that comes from a more \ngeneral standard.\nThis song really means so much more than just rebellion so I feel it's a \nbit sad that I see so many people who think BTS are a bad influence when \nit's really that their songs need need a bit more analysis than just what \nyou can gather from the first time you watch the video.",

A lot of \nstudents are being told (maybe not directly) that they have to be on top or \nthey aren't good enough and I believe that  is also why there was a high \nlevel of suicide amongst high school students. They are in school all day \nand some go to cram schools/hagwons until late at night. Their futures \n(including even their marriages sometimes) are based on how well they do, \nwhat college they tested into and so on and so forth. It seems extremely \nstressful. They do all this work, but are they really happy. I feel like \nthat is the essence of the song, not to rebel per se, but to stand up for \nyourself and don't let what others want for you to overshadow what you \nreally want for yourself...just my opinion...",

They only took part of it, so I'm guessing that maybe \nwhen they produce their songs (Like fully produced) they do this, specially \nSUGA, he fully produced Jump and Tomorrow, and those songs have this beat \nand this kind of lyrics. As well with Let Me Know, SUGA produced that song \nand it's my favourite from BTS. Only the recent tittle songs are different, \nbut for example I think Just One Day was the best among the four (Boy in \nLuv, Just One Day, Danger, War of Hormone) when they changed to School love \nconcept. Sadly, this is what Kpop does to good musicians. They need please \nfangirls standards, so love songs are needed. But they still having their \nown style, and rap-line still writing amazing songs, I've heard SUGA is \nworking in new material, so maybe for the next album we are going to good \ngood songs!",
