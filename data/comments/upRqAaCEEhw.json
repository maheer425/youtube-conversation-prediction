                    "text": "+Ae Fl Yes your right. By the laws of thermodynamics matter isnt eternal. \nTherefor the universe had a beginning. You still do not seem to understand \nthat this fact implies no creator. It implies nothing in fact. Scientists \nhave already run a simulation universe with a big bang and it produced a \nuniverse very similar to ours (because we cant account for many minute \nvariables). In fact we arent even sure if our standard model of particles \nis complete. But from what we've observed, the big bang is our best bet. \nNow onto intelligent design. So because you keep talking about what little \nscientific rhetoric you know, let me clear some things up. But before I do, \nhow can you talk about using deductive reasoning for a topic such as this? \nWhy not instead of guessing about what we guess makes sense, we use \nscientific knowledge. Yes biological and mechanical function needs a \ncreator. But you are sorely lacking correct information if you think that \neverything needs a creator. Ever heard of the Casimir effect. One of the \nmost promising \"new\" discoveries in the field of quantum mechanics. \nMolecules popping in and out of existence in a vacuum. Interesting. Almost \nsounds like something coming from nothing. While the effect is small, as in \na small amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves, it exists. \nNow imagine that you have a void. Anything we say here is meaningless \nanyways as we know nothing about the properties of the outside universe but \nlets go off of what we know. Assuming there is no time because quantum foam \nis a universal construct, everything would happen at once (similar to how a \nphoton would see the universe). Meaning that there is no probability of a \nparticle zapping into existence. Of energy zapping into existence. In fact \nmany researchers are now thinking that these could be failed \"universes\". \nOnes that have different negative energy variables(but thats a different \ntopic for another day). So imagine that because it is a total void it is \nimpossible for nothing to happen. As everything that can happen WILL \nhappen. sufficient energy, or infinite energy, would be impossible to NOT \noccur. Or at least  in the current thinking of most quantum mechanical \nphysicists. But thats just one idea. As you probably know the cosmic \nmicrowave background radiation is a map of the first burst of \nelectromagnetic energy in the universe. Signaling its birth date in a \nsense. But while we originally thought it to be uniform. We now know that \nit is lopsided. Suggesting that it was birthed out of a parent universe. \nBut how did that parent universe get there? This is why this entire \nargument is silly. A god could or could not exist. A universe could or \ncould not be formed. We cant know for sure yet. Because we dont know the \nproperties of the outside universe. Perhaps the outside universe is in a \nfield where universes are the only things that can be born, or that time \ndoesn't exist and universes are constantly being birthed, giving birth, and \ndying. We just dont know. This argument if futile. So until we have \nsufficient evidence, I choose to go with the decision that most relects \nwhat we know so far. And that is that there is no Intelligent Creator. \nHowever unlike you, im willing to accept the truth if it turn out to not be \nthe case. But your fine to believe whatever you want. Just maybe instead of \nacting all high and mighty as if you know all the answers in the universe, \nrealize that your not the centre of the cosmos. What you say isn't law. It \nbarely even makes coherent sense.  We will continue to explore, test, \nquestion, and discover long after you've made up your mind.",

The only reason that I bothered to even respond to him \nwas because I saw a glimmer of intelligence and hoped that he was not like \nthe millions of other Christians in America. But as the conversation \nprogressed I realized that he just couldn't accept what I was saying. Its \nall because of the environment religions set up. They are nurtured from \nbirth to believe in this fairy tale. Making it basically as strong as their \nwill to live. They are told that this person has all the answers that they \nwill make him safe, and that theres nothing to fear as long as your with \nhim. Of course you want to believe that. It gives you comfort. Your told \nthat you were created in his image and he created everything. Gives you a \npurpose in life, some thing humans always strive for. Gives them sloppy \nreasons to things that he always wondered like \"how did I get here\"? and \nwithout any scientific knowledge or the sufficient critical thinking at \nthat age it seems to make sense and it sticks. You're told he loves you and \nthat gives you a sense of community. You get to the point when you realize \nwhat death is. And like every human you don't want to die. Thats when \nreligions most underhanded and deadly trick comes in. Implemented by every \nworld religion. An afterlife.

This is passed down generation to \ngeneration. Parents teach it to their children and they're children do to \ntheirs. Its a never-ending cycle of lies. This is how religion gets you. It \nmakes you want to never leave. It makes you WANT to believe. Makes you use \ncircular logic such as using the bible as proof of god and makes you ignore \nall the horrible things in your belief system like sexism, racism, slavery, \ninconstancies, and plain lies. It makes no sense to continue to argue with \nthis man. It gets us no where.  Where accomplishing nothing.Its too late. \nSome people are just too far gone.

To imagine it, \nimagine a very dense ball of matter. It doesn't have enough space for the \nmatter to cool down. So how did the bang trigger? We honestly don't know. \nBut something CAN come from nothing. There is this thing called quantum \ntunneling. Where particles can essentially borrow energy from the future \nand pay it back later. This takes a long time as the chance is random, but \nas I've said before, space isn't in tact so time isn't isn't in tact. So, \nall space has to do because it is infinite, just expands into itself in a \nway. Essentially giving itself more room. That is the most prevalent \ntheory. Complete with evidence that points AWAY from god and towards a \nbeginning. But there has been a problem. When we put the big bang into our \nmathematical simulations, it always comes out wrong. So either the theory \nis wrong or we missed a variable or variables needed for the equation. But \nlately they've found that to solve the equation it would suggest an \nINFINITE universe. A universe that has been there forever. Now heres when \nyour wrong. Your going to need to stay with me here and try to follow \nbecause this might be hard to wrap your head around. Nothing needs a \ncreator. The only reason we say that is because the universe were in has \nmacro-physics(not quantum) that suggest that. We don't know the laws of \nanything outside the universe. Outside of our universe there could be a \nspace where anything we think of as being normal and logical goes out the \nwindow. There is nothing that says it has to follow our laws. Due to it not \nbeing in the jurisdiction of our universes laws. Your other question was \nstupid. I was waiting for you to fall into that trap. And boy am I glad you \ndid. I was scared that even intelligent people believe in this crap. But \nnow that I see this, I understand that such a thing is impossible. It seems \nperfect to you. That is an illusion. We could be monsters with straws for \nears yet we would still think we are perfect. Our sun being the perfect \ndistance away is also wrong.  You think that we are lucky to be her in the \n\"goldilocks zone\"(named that because it isn't too got or too cold). Wrong. \nBECAUSE LIFE COULDN'T EXIST ANYWHERE BUT THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE. Its like \nbuying a lottery ticket and saying \"wow i'm pretty lucky\" and then \nrealizing that you were the only one who could even receive the money! But \ngood one. Your endless stupidity amuses me, it really does. Also, the \nreason that your penis ejaculates is to mate. Natural election explains \nthat as well. Looks like you fell into another illusion. Poor guy. If you \nDidn't have that as a species, how would you continue to be alive to even \nask that question? Any animal that DIDNT have that would have died off the \nsecond it's first member died. So congrats on falling into two holes that \nare literally like light to a moth but for idiot religious people. No I \nDONT think its a coincidence. Its called natural selection. Look it up. Our \nthumbs grip to things because we mutated with that trait. Because people \nwith that trait were able to make tools, they lived longer that their \ncounterparts and passed down their traits. Its very simple. Ive even \nexplained it to children form 8-10 years old. Im disgusted and sad for you \nmore than anything. So let me anticipate your next argument. Your probable \ngong to talk about the fact that we have multiple theories and that you \ncant prove them yet. Well your right. But while religious people settle for \na random answer because the truth is to hard to get, science tries to find \nthe answers, constantly testing itself to make sure its right. And even if \nthese to are wrong, we will find more information and craft another theory \nthat better fits our new view of the universe. It's like piecing together a \npuzzle. Except instead of helping, militant religious people claim that \nthey have all of the puzzle solved when in actuality they havent even begun \nto scratch the surface. Notice how science LOVES to admit when its wrong. \nThats what makes the system so amazing. If it didn't do this, it would be \nflawed. While religious people yell \"na na na we can hear you\" to the world \nand continue they're lies.Oh look a final illusion thats hard to catch but \nI caught. This is one of my favorites. Your hinting that because the big \nbang is wrong to you, god is the next answer. You cant beat science at its \nown game. Thats why in debates you ALWAYS LOSE. You can be a christian or \nwhatever. Im cool with that. But the second you attempt so say that your \nchoice makes more sense than mine, its over. Especially with thousands of \nreligions all saying different things. How do you know your right? Why \nwould a random answer, made by racist, sexist, dumb, sister raping, \nignorant, un-advanced, people 2000 years ago be any closer to the answer \nthan the constant testing and evidence given by science. Your joking. \nReligion doesn't stand a chance. It is a teddy bear to keep humanity \ncomfortable. But as I've said before, we no longer need our teddy bear to \nkeep us safe. Because we now can prove that there is nothing under our beds.",

Why would you challenge \nme to find proof of one?\nI did not say there is no other life in the Universe.\nI did state that I would not be surprised to find microbial life outside of \nEarth's atmosphere. \n\nI also said that the likelihood is very improbable, because if life was \ncommon, many billions of life forms would have evolved far longer than \nHumans. Some life would have already evolved billions of years beyond life \non Earth. Therefore if life, and more important, if Sentience existed as a \nfactor of probability, it would be highly unlikely that some species had \nnot had a noticeable effect on the Universe.

To take an extremely simplified example because I \ndon't know your scientific background, if say, an asteroid orbits the Sun \nat 1000 km in a minute, and then another 1000 km in the next minute, and \nthen 1000 km in the next minute, and nothing is in its way, science is the \nact of calculating, based on how the asteroid has moved thus far, where the \nasteroid will be in, say, a year. Of course, it's never that simple, but \nScience does a bloody good job at doing well.\n\nEqually, science very often does not have \"faith\" in the unknown. Science \nconstructs models of what we perceive as reality based on the best evidence \navailable to us. Of course philosophically, one cannot truly prove \nanything, but the simple fact that scientific theories bring us consistent \naccurate results and practical applications is very strong evidence that \nthe results we are achieving are true, or at least very good approximations \nof reality.\n\nOne clear example is Newtonian physics. Newtonian physics had very good \npractical applications and predictive qualities. However, it took Einstein \nto realise that Newton had neglected certain factors, factors which, taken \ninto account, can provide us with far more accurate results (the orbit of \nMercury being the most famous example). Practical applications of Newtonian \nphysics are numerous, though without Einstein's approximations of reality, \nyour GPS would become unusable within minutes.\n\n\"Some theories were proven wrong, others proven right and still other \ntheories changed entirely\"\nI challenge you to name one. Theories are extremely well substantiated \nscientific ideas. Of course science quite often gets generally accepted \nideas wrong due to lack of evidence, but when evidence accumulates \nmassively, it then becomes a theory. There are many scientific ideas which \nare changed, but theories change only in comparatively minute details.\n\n\"the scientific community shuns and even suppresses research conducted \noutside the \"community\"\"\n\nThis is the case when research is conducted poorly on extremely poor \nevidence. Take creationism, for example; it is increasingly obvious that \ncreationism is nonsense, and creationists will complain that their lack of \nfunding is due to \"scientific closed-mindedness\", when in reality it is \nsimply due to such pursuits being a waste of time and resources.\n\nI do somewhat agree that there is no evidence for or against life outside \nEarth and that it is a matter of belief, but there is indirect evidence; \nthe existence of life on at least one planet, and the sheer size of the \nUniverse renders the probability of life outside of Earth at least a \nrelatively likely proposal. But the very size of it is likely the reason \nwhy we will probably never discover life outside our planet.\n\nI apologise for the elongated reply, however, I tend to speak far too much.",
