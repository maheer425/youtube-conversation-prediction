Are there contradictions in \nmathematics? Sure. The singularity that is 1/0 springs to mind. However, we \ndon't say 1/0 has multiple solutions, we say that 1/0 is undefined. If they \ncan't be defined as one thing in mathematics - in other words, if it \ncontradicts, we say it's undefined. It seems like a cop out, but it's the \nonly way we can be sure of anything in mathematics... At least if you \nlisten to G\u00f6del.",
