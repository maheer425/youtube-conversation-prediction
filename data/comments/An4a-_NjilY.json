But the one who \ndoes not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few \nblows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and \nfrom the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\" \n-Luke 7:47-48\n\nJesus establishes that people who are ignorant of the rules, obviously, \nhave a much less severe punishment.\n\n\n\"And he continued, \u201cYou have a fine way of setting aside the commands of \nGod in order to observe your own traditions! For Moses said, \u2018Honor your \nfather and mother,\u2019 and, \u2018Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be \nput to death.\u2019 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have \nbeen used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to \nGod)\u2014 then you no longer let them do anything for their father or \nmother.Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have \nhanded down. And you do many things like that.\u201d -Mark 7:9-13\n\nJesus points out the evident and inherent flaws in the Romans interweaving \ntheir own traditions and misconstruing the original ones. Namely, the rules \nof honoring your mother/father. (Fun fact: the command of honoring one's \nfather and mother is the only one that holds long life as an inherent \nreward. In contrast, those with a 'depraved mind' are characterized by \ntheir unwillingness to love and respect their parents.)\n\nAnd, finally,\n\n\"Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were \ndone, because they did not repent.\" -Matthew: 11-20\n\n'repentance' is not only humble apology, but the resolve to commit to \nchange. It's pretty much common sense from their--people who don't change \ntheir flawed ways are going to see negative consequences, from authority or \notherwise. Refer to the Luke verse above.\n\nI don't want to sound condescending with any of this, but I personally saw \nsome flaws in the way you perceived these writings, and decided that I \nwould throw what I see as the full context.",

As a spoken word artist, a great deal of thought goes into \nthe words I choose. The word was not used with disregard to the public... I \nwas actually quoting a friend who completely hit the nail on the head by \nsaying it. The word is used specifically to shine a light on the problem, \nand has caused exactly the intended effect. Yes, I could have changed it to \n'mess with' or 'screw with'... but do either of those options make the line \nstand out? No. The fact that the world is more concerned with a single word \nover the fact that our planet is in crisis, just shows how completely lost \nwe are. Everyday we are subjected to images and articles of intense \nviolence... but still we choose to object to a word that describes our \nfeelings about the situation, rather than the actual situation itself. Our \nplanet is dying... I can think of no more appropriate time to use this \nword... I can think of no better word to describe the immeasurable scope of \ndespair and frustration I feel toward our treatment of the planet. Share \nthe video or don't... the choice is, and will always be yours... I am \nforcing no one to watch it. This campaign is a call to action... real \naction is what's needed to save our home... our survival depends on the \nparticipation of all. Please don't think that the omission of a single word \nis the action that's going to make this world a better place.\ufeff",

I \nwas actually quoting a friend who completely hit the nail on the head by \nsaying it. The word is used specifically to shine a light on the problem, \nand has caused exactly the intended effect. Yes, I could have changed it to \n'mess with' or 'screw with'... but do either of those options make the line \nstand out? No. The fact that the world is more concerned with a single word \nover the fact that our planet is in crisis, just shows how completely lost \nwe are. Everyday we are subjected to images and articles of intense \nviolence... but still we choose to object to a word that describes our \nfeelings about the situation, rather than the actual situation itself. Our \nplanet is dying... I can think of no more appropriate time to use this \nword... I can think of no better word to describe the immeasurable scope of \ndespair and frustration I feel toward our treatment of the planet.
