I'm not sure why there would be such an issue with people knowing \nyour dog's name, for any reason. I do not put my last name on the collar so \nI don't think it's a big deal. If you do not personally know why you \nshould/shouldn't put your dog's name on the collar please do not comment, \nit will confuse people.",
