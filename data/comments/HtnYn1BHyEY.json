Re do the vedio and delete this off your entire board if u \ndnt wanna have to be charged for showing unsafety methods\n\nPencil bun is no pencil bun some can say without the pencil try the point \nstanding up atleast some one can see and wouldnt want there self pricked or \npoked at so safer but best use u sharpen pencils or replace pencil later \nwith a clip or so as an option\n\nWhat if kid falls on her back , so eone pulls her head back, or accidently \nshe tryies to exercise her head and neck by rolling and bendi g. These are \ndangers loook at them first as how u could add a better vedio for them. \n\nI dnt have kids but as a hairdresser I always think of safety when its kids \nespecially.   \ufeff",
