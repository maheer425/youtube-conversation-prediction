Islam says arranged marriages are wrong, a girl has the right to \nmarry of her choosing. It also says that you must follow the law of the \nland even if it isn't Sharia Law.  So if the law says she cannot marry \nuntil 16-18 then the people must not go against the law. The parents still \nretain the right to refuse an offer of marriage to the daughter, and the \ndaughter could also petition a judge to allow the marriage.  If they are \nnot Muslims none of this matters and culture wins it's that simple.\nFinally two things, I believe that she was helped in her video by someone \nwith an agenda not her's.

                    "text": "+yahtoray3\nWell, in some cases, both parties are young. In many cases in the Southern \nUS, both the groom and the bride were fairly close in age, but the groom \nwas forced into marriage in a \"shotgun\" wedding to avoid prosecution for \nviolating the statutes. Sometimes, there were mistakes in age and the groom \nwas tricked into believing the partner was older than she really was. (As a \nside note: today, most states don't even allow the shotgun wedding defense, \nbut there are many 17 year-olds who are forced to a lifetime punishment \nwith the sex-offender restrictions for consensual sex with a 15 year old. \nThere are also occasionally legitimate mistakes in age where the law \ndemands the perpetrator to be treated as a child predator.)\n\nUsually, the fact that men can do their part in the reproductive process in \nold age, albeit often with some difficulty, while women cannot because of \nmenopause, has exerted evolutionary pressures on men to generally pursue \nmoneymaking/education and marry at an older age. Generally, the more \npolygamy and child marriages, the higher the birthrate. The more education \nwomen have, the lower the birthrate in society. Some of this might be due \nto more knowledge of birth control, but it's mainly due to the fact that \nwomen marry later because they're too busy studying. \n\nAlso, it might have boosted life-expectancy. In a primitive society, if a \n13 year old girl were to marry a 13 year old boy, there would be a good \nchance that the 13 year old boy carried genes that lowered life-expectancy \nand could pass these on to offspring. However, if a 13 year old girl were \nto marry a 50 year old man, the odds of the groom passing on relatively \nstrong longevity genes to offspring would increase dramatically. Due to \nmenopause preventing procreation, it wouldn't be advantageous to have young \nboys marry older women. \n\nThere was one society in the US that forced young boys to be child \ngrooms(in a sort of swinger community) to older women before \nage-of-consents applied to males. It was called the Oneida Community, and \none of its traumatized members assassinated President Garfield. Guess what \nhappened. Its members had a low birthrate and died out! It's now just a \nregular silverware company or brand. ",

I have a BA in Arabic and obligatory studied \nthe Qur'an, which made me decide to become a Christian, interestingly \nenough. I was shocked to read the Qur'an in Arabic and see that it does \ncontain warmongering language and hate-exciting content. Up 'till then I \nwhitewashed claims of non- or anti-muslims to that fact. (Almost) every \npage of the Qur'an refers to at least something negative in relation to \nunbelievers, women, infidels or the like. Maybe 'we Westerners' just don't \nget it then, that a sentence like \"kill the unbelievers wherever you \nencounter them\" means exactly that what it says. The verb used, \n/\u0642\u062a\u0644-qatala/, by the way, semantically does really equate /to kill, slay, \nmurder/ in english.",

A man can marry a 2 yr old if he wishes.\n\nI asked:\nWould the best human on this earth have sex with a child?\nWith a slave?\nWould kill, steal, torture, lie, and commit many other crimes?\n\nAgain you could not answer because you know the answers would be NO.\nYou KNOW mohammad did those crimes, so you don't answer instead you take a \nfew cheap shots. It was expected I won't be offended as easily as you.\n\nI expect you to lie. And you do.\nI expect no answers because the answers will prove what a liar you are and \nwhat a complete scumbag mohammad was.\n\nYou say \"you should know what is marriage is all about.

You have to keep repeating mohammad is a prophet. It's like \nyou have to fool yourself. Pathetic!\n\nSince you say you love the 4 prophets, which would you consider the best \nman?\nWas it moses, jesus, abraham, or PROPHET momo?\n\nYou know what they all did, so who was best.\nIf you are a liar and I know you are, you will say ALL of them are equal.\n\nWill you prove me wrong?\nI have given you an opening.",

                "text": "Cenk is such a hypocrite. According to his own logic he shouldn't have \nanything to say about anyone else's traditions and morality. He is always \nranting and raving about how evolution is a fact and people who believe in \na creator are morons. Well maybe these people are just adapting new laws of \nmorality as they go through their natural evolution, right CENK? Just \nbecause our laws of morality have \"evolved\" a different way then theirs', \ndoesn't make either one right or wrong.\n            THE FACT IS we have laws of morality written in our hearts that \ntell us this is wrong because it is a reflection of YHWH's (God's) \ncharacter to despise such things.  The people committing such atrocities to \ntheir own beautiful children have a special place reserved in hell for \nthem! They know in their hearts that what they do is wrong but Satan has \ntrapped them into believing through fear and intimidation and possessing \nthem with his mindset from childhood. If people don't swallow their pride \nand realize that these things are true then we will never be able to \naddress the real problem here. Sadly people will look right past the real \nproblem and blame the belief in a creator. And creationists and bible \nbelievers will get sucked in with all this nonsense and will be blamed for \nthese immoral things that certain religious organizations are responsible \nfor... The quaran is like rat poison, 99% good food to attract the rat and \n1 % poison to kill it. Although I think the quaran has much more poison \nthan just 1% as we can see here in the video. People who believe in the \nquaran are not using their brain to arrive at this belief and they often \nend up finding out about these things after they've converted. Then they \nsay, \"well they don't believe in the parts of the quaran with the jihad, \npedophilia, abuse and disrespect toward women etc.\". If they don't believe \nin any of those parts of the quaran then why don't they just become Jewish \nbecause if you take those things out of the quaran you essentially have the \nold testament, or the Torah. But usually you don't ever make it that far \nwith a Muslim without them getting angry because they know that in their \nhearts they are wrong. Thats usually when they become a jihadist because \nthey refuse to face the truth and they need to take out their anger on the \nones trying to expose there insanity.For any Muslims who made it through \nthis whole paragraph without getting angry, I truly commend you. \n          This wonderful little girl has the fire of the Holy Spirit in her \nand may Yahoshua the messiah bless her with His Holy Spirit for the rest of \nher life. She knows in her heart what is right and wrong so much so that \nshe is willing to never talk to her family ever again because she knows \nthey are scumbags despite all the ideas to the contrary that were being \ndrilled into her head throughout her life. Cenk knows right and wrong too \nbut he doesn't know WHY it is right and wrong, so therefore he has no \njustification to do anything about it. I know that we have right and wrong \nbecause it is a reflection of the character of our Creator. And if we don't \ndo anything about the wrong being done, it will spread like a virus or a \ncurse. The Holy Bible justifies wars against nations who have sinned \nagainst Him. I mean what are we supposed to do, just stand here idle and do \nnothing while they rape and kill their woman and children and wage war \nagainst all those who don't believe in a book dictated by a man who \ncouldn't read or write in 660 AD, just because we can't accept the fact \nthat the laws of morality are universal and did not evolve! All Cenk can \nsay is \"come on guys can't we just realize what century we're living in\". \nAs if they need to evolve more. I would argue that evolution theory \nactually promotes the same thing jihad does (survival of the fittest).\n       The quaran hasn't ever been put up to the type of scrutiny by \nscholars and historians over the centuries that the Holy Bible has, because \nif it did it wouldn't be around anymore. But of course theres a law against \nexposing the \"holy quaran\" anyway lol. The quaran is a perversion of the \ntrue and historically accurate Torah.\ufeff",

I had a big comment but I messed up and \nerased it... too lazy to write it all again. so here is a little version.\n\nwhere do you tae all that genetic thing from and how does it justify child \nrape ? none of those tribes were completely erased so did god fail ? how \nare women virgins humans but all the others who got slaughtered non human ? \nwhy aren't boys virgins pure too ?\n\nThere is a similar thing in islam but it's bs, and the quran and the bible \ndo say that the earth is flat but I haven't actually encountered this thing \nfor the bible yet so I guess I'll look more into it to see if you're right, \nalso, how does that justify childrape ?\n\nI dont give a fuck about the economy. The rules I'm worried about are those \nlike don't pick up sticks on the sabath or DEATH. do I need to say more ? \nDo you really want me to talk about all the other ridiculous rules that are \nin the bible ? like the one condonning abortion ? and how does that justify \nchild rape ?\n\nthey lovzed it so much, and memorized it so well that none could write it \ndown the same way. None are well written and if that's the word of Yah then \nhe just isn't very literary. Not a significant drawback, but ya gotta tell \nit like it is, he writes like a prepubescent  teenager with a thirst for \nblood and virgins. and how does that justify child rape ?\n\nI realize you didn't adress the two kids who got murdered by GOD through \nbears for being annoying little pricks like all kids are.\n\nthe contradictions are waaaaaay too many, and boring in genesis where some \ncharacthers suddenly become their own fathers from a page to another etc. \nEven christians have admitted that there are actually two accounts of the \nfamily lines after adam and eve and they are completely different.\n\nyou know, I don't think I can sway someone so... fanatic as you, so I just \nwant to hear one thing. WHat do you think about child rape ? is it good or \nbad, it you think it's bad, I ask you to read the bible and reconsider your \nfaith, if you think it's good, I hope a god is real just so he can send you \nto some kinda hell because fuck you.\n\nBut if you think child rape is bad, if you agree that science is right when \nit says the earth is millions of years old and that dinosaurs existed, then \nI don't care about your beliefs.

She has say \nover who uses those organs.\n\n\"The baby's body is unique and different from either parent! There's no \ndecision to be made.\"\n\nExactly.

The bank \nteller is not using the organs of another for their survival.\n\n\"for the same reasons, you don't decide whether to let any person young or \nold to go on living, whether he's dependent on somebody else or not.\"\n\nYeah, we do.  We dont force people to donate organs, as people have the \nright to bodily autonomy.  The same applies to pregnant women.\n\n\"You don't even consciously think about it. Unless you're a cold-blooded \nmurderer of course.\"\n\ndenying another the right to use your organs isnt cold blooded murder, as \norgan donation carries quite a bit of risk, just as any surgery does. \n Pregnancy ALSO carries quite a bit of risk (in fact, FAR more risk than \norgan donation surgery), therefore, denying the right of a fetus is not \ncold blooded murder.\n\nAgain, if the mother denies organ use, too bad.  Its her body and her \norgans.\n\nIf you disagree, please explain why you dont also advocate forced organ \ndonation, like liver and bone marrow?  Neither are more life threatening \nthan pregnancy, and both regenrate, yet I am sure that you would agree that \nFORCING people to donate those things would be a violation of their rights, \nREGARDLESS of whether or not denying that donation would cause the death of \nanother.",

If you know anything about natives of the Arabian peninsula you \nwould know that it was perfectly ok for girls to merry young\n----\n\nThere is no such thing as \"Islamophobia\" .... either you believe in Islam \nor you do not ...\n\nPersonally I'm only looking at what Allah has put his stamp of approval on \nin the Quran and what Muhammed did himself according to the Quran and the \nmuslim hadiths ... and by these standards then child marriage is allowed \nand has the stamp of approval, which is no doubt also why we still see \nchild marriage in the Islamic world, simply because they use the deeds of \ntheir Prophet , the Quran and Islamc law as inspiration as how to live \ntheir life.\n\nBut I totally agree with your second point, that these rules were only ment \nfor people living 1,400 years ago ... and that is exactly the problem with \nthe Quran, because most of it is simply outdated and is useless as guidance \nof how to live in this day and age ..\n\nChild marriage is both illegal and a no-go in my part of the world, so is \ncapital punishment, or taking booty and slaves in war, or having sex with \nwar captives and demanding ransom or selling them off like cattle ... all \nthis has the approval of Allah in the Quran, which is also why I cant take \nthe Quran seriously, because no God would send a \"perfect\" book and message \nthat so obviously is not for all people at all times ... the Quran is quite \nclearly a law book and \"guidance\" for Arab people living in the desert \n1,400 years ago ... and even back then it was outdated, considering that \nthe fulfillment of the law through Jesus the Messiah and his message to all \nmankind was already there for Muhammed and his followers to see, which is \nthe one you find in the Gospel in 'The Sermon on the Mount' :\n\nhttp://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm\n\nhttp://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm\n\nhttp://biblehub.com/matthew/7.htm\n\nBut I'll only quote this most important part :\n\nMatthew 7: 12\nIn everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat \nyou, for this is the Law and the Prophets.\n\nThis is the Gospel from Jesus the Messiah, who himself was without sin \n(also according to Islam), unlike Muhammed or any Prophet who came before \nhim ... so everything he said still holds true, because it was not really \nadressed to people living 2,000 years ago, but to all mankind at all times.\n\nAs for Matthew 7:12 it sums up how all people should live their lives ... \nand obviously, child marriage, a 'Dar al-Harb' ( \"house of war\"), killing, \ntaking booty and slaves, or having sex with them, Muhammed and his \nfollowers would never have done if they had lived by the words of Jesus the \nMessiah as written in Matthew 7:12 and in his 'The Sermon on the Mount', \nwritten down hundreds of years before the time of Muhammed... it is by \nthese words we no longer do the unlawfull things Muhammed and his followers \ndid 1,400 years ago and some muslims unfortunately still do with the \napproval of the Quran and by example of their Prophet.",

Let us not mention \nthe fact that you are basing your argument on something that happened over \n1400 years ago when society was more than a 'little' different. If you know \nanything about natives of the Arabian peninsula you would know that it was \nperfectly ok for girls to merry young - you see college and a career was \nnot a priority for women back then, being in a constant warfare marriages \nserved political and social purposes. Age was just an estimate so hitting \npuberty was their sign that a girl is ready for marriage. Aisha had agreed \nand so did her father, therefore, it isn't a forced union and if you think \nshe was some helpless kid who got forced into a marriage to an older man, \nthink again because she was a military leader, after the prophet's death \nshe became a prolific hadith scholar. Her husband instructed people to \nconsult her in his absence.  She was a strong role model that was nothing \nlike you Islamophobs depict her to be! and she was treated with respect by \nthe man you claim to be a pedophile and there are volumes documenting love \nand kindness and romance between Mohammed and Aisha in an age when men in \nEurope were pissing all over their women.  so when I say things like forced \nmarriage in Yemen and Sadia Arabia happen today because of a rotten culture \nthat deviated from the example of Mohammed, I would be very much correct \nand you would be WRONG. And just for the fun of it, why is it ok for 33 \nyear old King John to merry 12 year old Isabella of Angouleme and not \nMohammed to 9 year old Aisha?! since you obviously know 'so much' about \nIslam and Prophet Mohammed, tell me - was King john following the teachings \nof Quran?!",

Because homeless people like it when people pity \nthem and grant a useless blessing from their lord. Yet the person who \ngranted this blessing feels validated with their effort, and won't feel the \nneed to do any volunteer work or actually helping a starving homeless \nperson get some food. God's already got that covered, at least in their \nmind.\nWhat can you do to help little children like this? You can spread the word, \nmake the oppression known, tell people about it. Because as long as viral \nvideos like Gangnam Style has 2 BILLION views, and this has <1% of that, \nthen the word is getting out to hardly nobody.
