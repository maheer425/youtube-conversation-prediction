                "text": "Off topic: For people who played the fatal frame games. I beat FF1 less \nthan a month ago and I loved it so much. It's a masterpiece imo and SO \nfreaking scary. Yesterday, I started playing FF2. I heard that it's the \nbest in the franchise, has a better plot than FF1 and that it's so scary. \nI'm only 2 hours in, BUT I'm not interested in the game almost at all. It's \nso boring, too effing easy, the story doesn't seem better at all (so far), \nthe ghosts aren't scary at all, the environments are too simple to be \nscary and the camera sucks!! I hate that I have to get close to do more \ndamage. The first game did a better job in my opinion. I was so scared, but \nI wanted to know what was going on. The story was interesting from the \nstart. The readings were interesting as well. Plus, the environments were \ncreepy and cool. Why do most ppl  love FF2 more? Bcuz of the better \ngraphics? :/\ufeff",

The story is \ndefinitely better and if you keep reading the files the back story is also \nmore interesting. Following and trying to reunite with your twin keeps you \non the edge all the time. The music is great. The gameplay is better with \nthe new and improved Camera Obscura and the ending is just... well you've \ngot to see it. It will make you want to play it again because the game has \na really high replay value. This is probably one of the scariest games of \nall time so I'd suggest taking a break too. Go play some \"happy\" and fun \ngames for a while :) By the way, the third game is also great. It's sort of \nlike Paranormal Activity and Silent Hill 4.",

                    "text": "You can say that, just the way it feels mechanically. They really ironed \nout the buffs and scratches that were existent in the first game. I think \nthe reason why people like FF2 more than the first is because of its \npolished look and improved gameplay. I personally enjoy both games and \ndon't prefer one game more than the other. The camera gameplay in both \ngames are unique, which I like. I think the reason why FF2 requires you to \nget close to ghosts is to make the game more challenging, unlike in FF1 \nwhere you can just spam ghosts from afar. The scares in FF2 were more \nspooky for me, but that's just my opinion, and both stories were great. FF2 \nmade me pissed at the end and FF1 made me sad. Maybe the reason why you are \nfinding FF2 boring is because you just recently finished the previous game, \ntake a mini break from it and come back :3",
