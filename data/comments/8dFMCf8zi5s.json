The burning sensation is just capsaicin \nattaching to pain receptors and giving you a perceived pain that is more \nintense the more capsaicin the pepper has.

I find \nthat full fat greek yogurt works the best because with milk you swish \naround the capsaicin in your mouth. With superhots, such as the Trinidad \nScorpion Moruga or the new #1 pepper, the Carolina Reaper, milk won't do \njack squat, matter of fact, it'll make the burn WORSE.",

So \nyeah, you wouldn't be able to eat it as you would probably die from looking \nin its direction, lol. Also, pure capsaicin is edible. They have made \nsauces that is simply pure capsaicin measuring at 16,000,000 scoville and \nyou can eat it, it's just advised not to try more than two drops for the \nfear of stomach problems. Resiniferatoxin is what you're probably thinking \nof as it is highly toxic. Resinferatoxin is the spiciest thing found thus \nfar measuring at 16,000,000,000 scoville, many time spicier than pure \ncapsaicin.",

So my uninformed guess is that hiccup is just a reflex that \nis very important in fish brains but in the human brain somehow only \ntriggers when... our body hates us for what we just put into it through our \nmouth?
