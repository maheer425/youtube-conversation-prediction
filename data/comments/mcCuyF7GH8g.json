Just goes \nto show how overwhelmingly intelligent the electorate is.  And therefore \nhow easy it is for incumbents to get re-elected. \n\nNot to mention also showing how easy it is for the media to determine the \noutcome of many elections.  In large part all you have to do is plaster the \ncandidate's name all over the newspapers/airwaves and they're basically a \nshoe in.\n\nI also agree with you that we're being trained to believe the president is \nakin to a dictator.  And that the congress is unnecessary and just gets in \nthe way.",

You fear someone disagreeing with you, you fear \nknowledge, you fear anything else that goes against your view of the world \nand you fear those who will stand up to you.

It must be tired of forcing your \nsister to do it.\nThis is not one of my own. I don't care what party they belong to or if \nthey are conservative or liberal, if they commit a crime, then they commit \na crime and should be put on trial and if found guilty serve their sentence.\nI am sorry that the education system in the US failed you and that you are \na stupid fuck and like having a loaded pistol to your head Martin (in case \nyou are confused that was meant figuratively not literally). I particularly \ndo not and any evil thing you want to know about me just ask because I will \nadmit to it if I did it. You see, you fear knowledge, strength and are \nintimidated by anyone who knows something that gores against your pea sized \nview of the world and that is a weapon that is used against you. This is \nprobably the last response you will get from me, but how does it feel to \nhave all these weapons used against you because of those things that you \nfear? You do fear it or else you would have just talked and commented \nwithout feeling that I was putting you down for sharing information with \nyou and give you something to think about. It is a defense mechanism and \nfrankly, I am so tired of people like you who trash any kind of education \nand who rely on the Bible for all your information. That is the most \nrevolting thing of all, Jesus was a hippie liberal because he believed in \nfeeding the poor instead of putting them down, he did not believe in \nviolence to get a point across or resort to name calling. Did you ever hear \nabout the big Jesus smack down? No? Because it never happened that's why. \nBut you go on ahead and comment on everything I ever commented on if it \nmakes you feel like a real man, I mean, I guess your hand must get tired. \nOh, and name calling and stupid put downs do not win an argument and that \nis why people like you resort to them because the idea of talking, \ndisagreeing and agreeing to disagree are things that real adults do.\nOh, and use spell check.

And if that is \nindeed the case then perhaps that is why the NSA was getting away with \nthese acts for so long. Because the U.S., the way I see it, is not united \nat all.\n\nNow, how surprised would you be if we got into another war? I don't think \nit would be too surprising. I mean, especially if it was with the countries \nyou named. Although, I wasn't aware those countries were funding these (T \nword)s (how long are we going to keep this up? Haha). Maybe we already are \nin a war or wars we don't know about.\n\nFinally, I agree that when the time calls for it then perhaps suspending \nthe constitution is the right thing to do. However, now is definitely not \none of those times. As far as we know, we're in a time of relative peace. I \nthink it's noble that the CIA and NSA want to prevent terrorism before it \nstarts. That's probably one of the few shared interests of this country. \nBut as I said before: they are not doing that. Maybe they were doing that \nat an earlier point in time. I'm not too sure. But now they're just using \nthe \"we're searching for potential threats\" as an excuse/cover. If they are \nreally looking for threats then there shouldn't be a reason for them to \ngather and store the types of porn people watch nor any nude media they \nhappen upon that belong to those same people. If they were really doing \nwhat they said they were doing, preventing threats, then perhaps Snowden \nwouldn't have felt the need to make what is going public.

One of the advisements/requirements is \nthat you shouldn't be doing things against the interests of the United \nStates even if they're legal.  The part where it said 'even if they're \nlegal' took me by surprise.  This could theoretically include anything we \ndon't even know about; including free speech and/or repeating what networks \nlike RT report.\n\nThis, among other things, makes me believe that free speech has the \npropensity to actually be damaging to the US right now.  It's sad if true, \nbut it seems like we may actually be in a time of war that we really don't \neven know about.  Not only against \"t words\" (lol) but against those who \nfund them like Russia/China/Iran/North Korea, etc. \n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures in government; especially when \npreserving and protecting the United States is the most fundamental goal.  \nRemember, Lincoln had to suspend the constitution during a time of civil \nwar so that he could gain an advantage over the south.  FDR had to put \nJapanese Americans in internment camps out of fear they were going to \ndestroy the US.  Freedom isn't exactly conducive to winning wars...
