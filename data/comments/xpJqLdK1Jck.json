Hugo Boss - a clothing company - \nwould not have known anything about the Nazi's plan to exterminate (by \nmeans of murder) millions of Jews.\n\nDo you honestly think if the Nazi's were murdering millions of Jews they'd \ntell everyone who they contracted to design/manufacture uniforms, build \nfactories, etc, etc...?\n\nJust as an interesting thought - imagine Germany won the war, and not the \nallies. Now think of all the atrocities committed by the allies during WWII \nthat could be used by Germany, perhaps exaggerated to some extent,  to make \nus out to be pure evil. I don't think it would be very hard for them to do \nso, they have a lot of material to work with...\ufeff",

It seems that the Government, schools, media have got you living in \na bubble that makes you oblivious to what is REALLY going on in the world. \n Its this stupidity/ignorance of all things non-american that makes it \ndifficult for Americans to take a stance on so many real issues.  I \npersonally don't think you're all as stupid or ignorant as government and \nmedia think you are.  The way things are going, you guys are beginning to \nresemble North Korea in the way the state feeds information thus limiting \nyour knowledge (unless you as individuals are curious enough to seek the \ntruth).  Freedom of thought and expression has been heavily restricted for \nAmericans and I don't think you are even aware because you're all caught up \nin this idea that you live in the home of the free and land of the brave. \n Seriously....you don't!\ufeff",

I could say you just proved my thesis with that \nstatement right there eh, but on the bright side at least you didn't say,  \n'Talk shite get hit.'  so at least that's something. \n\nThe logic I use to support my argument, besides experience of course, is \nsimple kiddo.  The terms Yo, Hoe, My Girls Yo, Cougar, Baby Momma, My Crew \nYo, My Bitch's, and Getto Spicy Momma, have became incredibly popular eh.  \nAs well as single girl's, single mother's, house wives, or cougars being \ndrunk, violent, going to jail, or fighting over the only non gay guy on the \nreality t.v. show has also become incredibly popular, almost as if it's the \nnew norm.  Hence we have, 'Orange is the New Black.'\n\nI'm not sure why this is but from my own experience uncaring violent \nalcoholic party girls were extremely popular when I was a kid eh, because \nthey liked to party, pass out in hallways, fight, and as long as you were a \ngood kisser allot of fun eh.  But for some reason I can't quite put my \nfinger on all these girls really want to do is have gangster boyfriends, \nnot husbands, have a gangsta crew yo, party in Vegas and Can Cun, and hang \nout with their high school and college crews forever and ever eh, nothing \nmore nothing less.  And if they do have kids they want to become friends \nwith their kids and make them part of their crew yo, instead of being \nparents eh.\n\nBut you already know all this kiddo, cause talentless violent uncaring \ngangster club girls have become more and more popular ever since Snooki \neh.  And once the violent uncaring party girl fad became popular, all the \nfilm, t.v, and music industries picked up on the trend and realized that \nthey could make pretty penny if they pushed it as hard as they could eh.  \nSo when all the violent uncaring party girls grew up and became violent \nuncaring club girls with expendable income, they saw their lives reflected \nback at them in film, t.v., and music eh, and they loved it and ate it \nright up. \n\nAnd when all the kids of these uncaring violent alcoholic club girls become \nteenagers their mother's like to tell them how they became party girls when \nthey were fifteen, and how cool they were, still are yo, when they ran from \nthe cops. So the trend is just continuing to get stronger and stronger with \nno end in sight eh.\n\nTo sum up,  'You don't know me.'   ''Talk Shite Get Hit.'  and  'Peace till \nmy crew get's here yo.' \n\nAnd try your best not to be such a mean nasty bitch okay kiddo, it really \ndoesn't look good on you, it really doesn't.   Remember...  You must fight \napathy with all your heart and soul to the bitter end, or not whatever I \ndon't care. \n\nGood luck... ",

His support came from the people because he \nput them and Germany first.

At the Nuremberg Trials, I, together with \nmy Russian colleague, condemned Nazi Aggression and Terror. I believe now \nthat Hitler and the German People did not want war. But we, {England}, \ndeclared war on Germany, intent on destroying it, in accordance with our \nprinciple of Balance of Power, and we were encouraged by the \n'Americans'{Jews} around Roosevelt. We ignored Hitler's pleading, not to \nenter into war. Now we are forced to realize that Hitler was right. He \noffered us the co-operation of Germany: instead, since 1945, we have been \nfacing the immense power of the Soviet Empire. I feel ashamed and \nhumiliated to see that the aims we accused Hitler of, are being relentless \npursued now, only under a different label.\" (Ashamed and Humiliated The \nBritish Attorney General, Sir Hartle Shawcross, said in a speech at \nStourbridge, March 16/84 (AP)).",

You \"have an emotional \nreaction\", grab a gun, run into the streets and randomly start murdering \nOTHER men, who have nothing to do with that, or who would have even HELPED \nyou, would they have been aware of what the other guy did to you - is THAT \n\"justice\" to you?\n\nYou make no sense, but are convinced to make all the sense in the world. \nDid you not learn about logical thinking in school?\n\nIf Hugo Boss refused to acknowledge the involvement of their company with \nthe nazis, or if they even CONTINUED to uphold a mentality that can be \ncompared to that of the fascists, you (and Russel Brand) would have all the \nright in the world to point fingers, be appalled, not buy their products \nand try to get others to boycott them, too.\n\nBUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.\n\nThose, who run \"Hugo Boss\" today are entirely different individuals than \nthose who ran Boss during the nazi times. Nevertheless, already a long time \nago, this NEW management has fully acknowledged to the past nazi evolvement \nof \"their\" company, has expressed their sorrow over it and is co-funding an \norganization that helps investigate into nazi crimes and is helping former \nvictims of nazi slave labor.\n\nWHAT IS WRONG ABOUT THAT?!??\n\nAnd how does it make sense to pretend there is some huge \"scandal\" here, \nand \"inform\" people about what those, who (unlike you, I guess) are TRULY \ninterested in history already know since a long time ago?\n\nBy the way - I do not buy from Hugo Boss any more - but because I think \nthey have a shitty quality and are overpriced. This nazi-aspect does not \nbother me the LEAST bit with Boss. However, it DOES bother me for instance \nwith G.W. Bush: His Grandfather Prescott Bush was once of the prime \nfinanciers of the Nazis during the early years, when there was still a lot \nof political opposition in Germany that could have stopped them. Arguably, \nPrescott Bush helped the Nazis rise, and laid the foundations for whatever \nhorrible crimes were committed by them in consequence.\n\nThe Bush family - unlike today\u00b4s Boss management - NEVER expressed remorse, \nlet alone paid any form of financial support to victims, or funded \nhistorical research into their ancestries dark past. Instead, they had the \nNERVE to retrieve a huge wealth of money made on the backs of those, the \nNazis murdered AFTER the war, and that had initially been taken away from \nthe Bush\u00b4s under the WWII-era U.S. government.\n\nThis wealth of money still today is part of the family property, that \nenables Bush to lead a quite comfy life (and allowed him to become U.S. \nPresident, in the first place, engaging in horrible war crimes in the \nfollow-up that include the introduction of torture-methods, that had been \nused in the Nazi\u00b4s Concentration Camps).\n\nBush went up against Holocaust Survivors in court to keep that Nazi Wealth.\n\nI have \"an emotional reaction\" about that. But unlike yours, it actually \nlines up with LOGICAL THINKING!\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar",

They will poke at all the prickly/touchy topics they \ncan get their hands on and won't give a fuck about the consequences because \nas comedians they are intelligent enough to not mean and deliver it in a \nhateful way, they merely pose it as a comment, normally in a sarcastic way. \nAmericans and apparently Hugo Boss don't deal with their cynical \npersonalities and dry humor it seems. I think that it's also wrong that \nthey removed Brand from the event but lets face it, they shot themselves in \nthe foot and made it a larger issue by trying to cover it up in that \nmanner. I still don't believe they need to actually address the point or \napologize for it.\n\n+Andrew Beeter - A little thing I wanted to add to Andrew as well is that \nmy question of being a Nazi and TRULY being a Nazi are still very different \nthings. Now of course this doesn't apply to everyone but how many people do \nyou think were coerced or forced to become a Nazi. Oskar Schindler was a \nNazi on paper and we all know what he was famous for. I always feel these \nmatters require a bit of common sense, think about it, Hugo Boss was a \ncompany manufacturer, what would his business gain by killing Jews? \nAbsolutely nothing, if anything he would be losing business and that is \nillogical. I don't blame anyone for joining the Nazi's at the time, when \nevery German around them were turning into them. This is what I meant by \nbeing a Nazi and truly being a Nazi and of course many of them killed Jews, \nbut I'm sure that there are still many Germans who became Nazi's because \nthey had no choice to conform - lets not forget that that was essentially \ntheir government regime and under that pretense anyone, ironically even \nJews themselves would've been counted as Nazi's just for living in Germany. \nI like to at least believe and think that every Nazi wasn't a straight up \nnasty piece of racist/prejudiced shit because life and more to the question \n- good and evil isn't quite that black and white in the real world compared \nto how they are on paper and portrayed throughout history.",
