Whats so difficult to \nunderstand you fool?\nThe law places an onus to the seller for the item to work. and the law \nplaces an onus on the educator to give education. Nothing more and nothing \nless. The law doesnt say that the educator must guarantee a job. The law \nalso doesnt say that the educator must give the student numbers on \nplacements, just as the law doesnt say that the buyer of the item must be \nsatisfied with the item (Remember the term \"buyers remorse\" in high \nschool?). Thats outside regulated law. Principle and philosophy of the law \nis always to seek a compromise between contractual parties.\nThe law doesnt want to favor the seller. And the law also doesnt want to \nfavour the buyer. The law has additional consumer protection laws, but on \nthe question of colleges and job placement figures there are no consumer \nprotection laws (Thank the Bushes and Obamas you voted for). So therefore \ncommon contractual law strikes a compromise: The seller has to provide the \nitem in a functioning state (how? Thats not the buyers problem --> thats \nthe problem of the seller). But if the item is delivered and it doesnt suit \nthe buyer, then thats not the sellers problem --> thats the problem of the \nbuyer).\nAnd if the student placement nonsense is  outside of regulated law and \noutside of the contractual agreement, then the student should have paused \nand said: \"Hhhm, wait a minute...

Does it send billions in foreign aid \nto its allies? Does it monitor foreign countries, its own citizens, ect for \n\"national defense.\" Does it have as many bureaucrats to set up and police \nrules and regulations that keep people \"safe?\"\n\nThese are all government services and if you take everything into account \nthe US provides more of them then Sweden. Again most people don't want any \nof these services but when you have a government you don't get to pick what \nservices you want and what you don't. This is why less government is better \nbecause you aren't forced to pay for services you don't want.\n\nYou don't need government in order to provide education, healthcare and \nhousing. People want these things and if you free them from the tax \nburdens/regulations governments place on its citizens they will be \navailable to everyone, either through purchase or charity.\n\n+Slaeowulf\nYou haven't addressed any of my arguments and continue to throw ad homines \nmy way.

And no, that's \nnot \"greed\"; making a profit is the whole point of a business.\n\nIf it's possible to make or change a law to benefit your business, then of \ncourse that's what you're gonna do. Because otherwise, your competitor is \ngoing to do it and you're gonna lose.\n\nWhat people fail to understand is that the system selects the kind of \nperson that's going to get in a position of power.\n\nFor instance, currently our system favors greedy sociopaths to become heads \nof corporations. That's because corporations are fictitious, monstrous \nlegal entities that are diametrically opposed to the concept of a free \nmarket. So people without conscience tend to be more successful in those \npositions.\n\nThus, the idea of adding more and more laws and regulations to control the \nmarket is unfortunately completely doomed to fail. The market is what \ngenerates wealth; wealth leads to power, power influences the law. \nTherefore, the law is never going to keep the market in check as people \nintend and hope for.\n\nHere's what needs to happen: capitalism has to be seperated from the state \njust as religion once was.\nThere shouldn't be such a thing as \"business law\". Laws should apply to \nreal individuals who can be responsible for their actions, not fictitious \nentities.\n\nThe more you merge the market with the state, the more dangerous and \ndominant a system it will result in (- >fascism). Seperate them, and it \nbecomes a harmless system that actually serves the people (- >free market).\n\nJust to be clear: As long as capitalism and state law influence one \nanother, a free market is completely *impossible*.\ufeff",

I established \nearly on that I use state and government interchangeably. In recent posts \nI've tried to stay consistent to your definitions. So in that first quote \nI'm talking about the state. In the second I'm using your definition of \ngovernment though maybe we should discuss that more. It seems unnecessarily \nbroad and contrary to what most people understand a government to be. To \nmost people government and state are interchangeable. This doesn't mean \nthat is the right way to use those terms but you can understand my \nconfusion when you quibble over the definition in one reply and then seem \nto interchange terms in another. Take for example your response to Tom \nEvans:\n\n\"I want our laws determined & enforced by democratic government.\"\n\nYou can't have a democratic government that isn't also a state because you \nmay have as much as 49% of the population that doesn't agree with the \ndecisions. The only way to get these people to follow is force which can \nonly be accomplished through a monopoly on force. Therefore, I can only \nconclude you have interchanged terms here. Can you understand my confusion?\n\n\"If all you're saying is that legitimacy, etc, is determined by government, \nthen I agree but you sure have a funny way of stating it.\"\n\nSee, I'm not sure how you're using the term government here. By your \ndefinition private courts, dro's, ect could be classified as governments. I \ntherefore don't like this definition and would prefer defining government \nin the same way as state, just for discussion purposes.\n\nLike I said, legitimacy will be determined by common law. No centralized \nauthority will determine it. It will arise from the bottom up.\n\n\"I am sincerely trying to engage in honest debate.\nI apologize if I have offended you, it was not my intent.\"\n\nThank you.
