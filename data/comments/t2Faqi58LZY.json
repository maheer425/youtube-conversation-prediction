Now, if someone just \nsort of speeds through the main game, I could see someone thinking it is a \nbit on the short side.  But, if one takes the time to really \u2018chew\u2019 on the \ngame, you will be MORE than satisfied, I think.  So, here is basically how \nit has worked for me:  I played through the main game.  Then (and I\u2019m still \ndoing this actually), I started back on Island #1 to unlock the extra \nlevels.  I think there are like 3 levels to unlock on Island #1 alone\u2026and \nthese are not like the unlockable levels from other games that tend to be \nshort and just tacked on.  The extra levels here are JUST as good and long \nas the main levels.   It can take a lot of time and effort to get the extra \nlevels, so there is a lot of playtime there.  Then, you\u2019ll want to play \neach level for the KONG letters and the puzzle pieces, and at least attempt \nto get a medal on the speed runs.  So, my point is that if you really take \nyour time with the game, try to be complete and really savor what is there, \nyou\u2019ll absolutely love it and you won\u2019t feel cheated in the slightest.  I \nam a HUGE DKC fan from the first game to today\u2026and this game, overall, is \nmy favorite.  Absolutely LOVE it!",

So \nmany games that people love like Donkey Kong Country Returns, Rayman \nOrigins, and Sonic Colors, I haven't been able to enjoy because looking for \ncollectibles in those games ruins the pace and fluidity of them, and I just \ncan't feel satisfied if I don't collect them. I wish platformers would go \nback to the way they used to be, where you felt good about finding secrets \nbecause you needed the extra lives/power ups you would find, not because \nthere was one of several arbitrary collectibles of that level. A lot of \npeople say that they help give a game replay value, but I say the opposite \nis true.

Nintendo are \ndealing with 2 different audiences and its not working.\nDK on the other hand is challenging from the start, and has a very nice \ncurve to it, for that, i place it above mario 3d world too,\nMe and my friends both say \"It only gets kinda hard around half way through \nworld 7\" to almost every modern mario.\nBut some levels even seem out of place, take the grumplump or whatever, the \nblock that rolls in lava when you step on it, it in ONE level, and its hard \nas all fuck in 2 player... in a world where we died 0 times.",
