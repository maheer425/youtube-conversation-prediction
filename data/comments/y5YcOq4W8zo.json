She looked \nlike she has a 12 inch waist. Okay, I'm exaggerating, but seriously they \nmust be using CGI to give her an un-realistic Barby doll waist in that \nscene. What kind of message are they giving to young girls with that?\ufeff",

                "text": "I don't think the message of kindness is simplistic.  Sometimes we wrongly \nassume that kindness is equivalent to weakness.  Sometimes being stern with \nsomeone is a measure of kindness in a sense that it is for their own good. \n If you're concerned about children misinterpreting the message, well \nthat's where the parents come in.  Sometimes you don't want to over \ncomplicate things when they are very young and allow them to calibrate \ntheir perspective as they get older.  Also it should be noted, that \nCinderella's mother (or who I assume is her mother), told her to \"have \ncourage and be kind\" and \"where there is kindness, there is goodness, and \nwhere there is goodness, there is magic\".  I don't think that is overly \nsimplistic.  If anything it's rather cryptic and begs implies there's \nsomething more to the message. It's so easy for us in today's society \nespecially, to be cynical about everything.  And sometimes that can work \nagainst us.  \ufeff",

I think the angle is that \nCinderella survives this horrible ordeal because she keeps her kindness in \ncheck and never stoops to her step-family's level. My father used to say, \n\"taking the high road eventually takes you to a higher place\" which seems \nto be the case for this movie. What do you think? Could Kindness be a super \npower?",

I don't think the intent is to teach girls that \nbeing kind only will get you out of an abusive situation any more than they \nare trying to teach girls that fairygodmothers are real.\n\nBut if you must find a message in a movie based off of a fairy tale then I \nwant to point out that in my personal opinion people should be kind even in \na horrible situation, But I don't think being kind in the real world means \nyou are a doormat, you can be kind and assertive. I think being able to \nlive through something like abuse and still being kind and not turning into \na horrible person like those who were abusing you is a virtue.\n\nAnd thirdly for all those complaining that this is teaching girls to stay \nin abusive situations, the fact that she stayed is probably the only thing \neven remotely close to reality about this fairy tale movie, if I am not \nmistaken for the time period this is set in there wasn't anywhere for her \nto run away to. Maybe perhaps a work house where she wouldn't have been \ntreated any better.",
