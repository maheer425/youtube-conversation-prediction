                "text": "The thing that troubles me with philantropy by billionaires like Bill Gates \nis that giving away their money someway seems like an attempt to legitimate \nthemselves and the capitalistic system within people like Bill Gates got so \nrich. I am not trying to make Bill bad, no I think its great that he \nrealises that with great wealth comes great responsibility, but he is only \none person with one opinion and if some other billionaire doesn't share his \nsense of charity, well then fuck you poor people. Philantrophy has to be \ndemocratised, money has to flow from the richest to the poorest and there \nhave to be mechanisms which prevent the creation of a super rich elite, \nwhich might not want to share its money.\nFrom great wealth comes great responsibility and responsibility has to be \nwithin the democratic process, not only within a tiny elite.\ufeff",

This kind of public \nawareness also increases pressure on other wealthy individuals, charities, \nand corporations that can do more to help.\n\nAs far as I can see, the Gates family is doing everything they can to \npromote charity across all groups. Given that they will likely end up doing \nmore philanthropic good than anyone else in human history, it's impossible \nto argue that they aren't putting their money where their mouth is.",

I \ndefinitely agree with you - CSR is indeed great for business, and I did \noutline that in that post I wrote just then.

And if we got more of them to see benefits in \nhuman development, not just through CSR (though the benefits of CSR for the \ncompany are also substantial) but also by seeing the third world as the \npotential markets and places to expand to rather than simply exploit (which \nthey can best achieve by expanding people's disposable income by removing \nthe barriers that stop them from progressing) - then we'd get a lot more \nhuman development happening and a greater connection between the business \nworld and individuals. \nIndeed, if that happened, and more people found it easier to give and more \ncompanies marketed the good they were achieving around the world, we'd \nprobably influence society a lot more. If businesses could be made to be \nseen as good aspects of society, why couldn't wider society ditch the \nconcept of greed is good?

It therefore gives off connotations of \nsacrifice.\nAnd when we ask people to give - we only target their compassion, we \neffectively guilt trip them into giving.\nWe'd get a lot more people willing and able to give if we started making \ncharity seem like a win-win. It already is in fact - and those wins aren't \njust limited to the \"warm fuzzy feeling\" you get from giving - there're \nsolid economic benefits in giving too. \nIndividuals, governments and businesses can all benefit from helping out \nthe third world. As individuals - there are so many ways we can help out \nwithout that sacrifice. And making this clear to people will definitely get \nmore people to give. (You could say people will only give to charities if \nthey saw a benefit in it for themselves if this mentality were to shoot off \n- but I don't think it'll stop people from giving because altruism can \ncoexist with this. In truth - it'll just allow people to give more)\n\nI've written this all up and effective altruism (and all the stats/evidence \nbehind it is there too) on my blog here: \nhttp://nikhilthegrizzlybear.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/giving-to-charity-is-win-win-businesses.html\nAnd I talk about this - as well as my journey through cancer on the blog's \nfacebook page too so check that out if you wanna - very interested in \nchatting about these things =] \nwww.facebook.com/musingsofamedstudentpatient",

I would like to \nhear your opinion John (and internet :)).\nIt was an article in news and it's main point was, that USA and Europe are \nat fault for Africa's horrible state. Reason being - western society came \nin, started to create infrastructure so they could drill for resources \n(oil, ores, etc), started to haul in food and supplies so they could \"buy\" \nlocal governments.  \nAnd once they got what they needed, they just left - this however started a \nhuge population boom, however Africa wasn't ready for huge amount of people \nthat was born, and we have states like Ethiopia. \nNow I'm not sure if this is the case or, but I do think that Africa didn't \nhave these problems 200 years ago. \n\nSo my question is.. are we really \"helping\" them in the long run? \ufeff",

Europeans came \ninto Africa, built infrastructure, and used that infrastructure and the \nhuman manpower available to strip away any sort of wealth they could get \ntheir hands on. Diamonds. Ivory. Coal. All of that was harvested using \noppressed African hands to send to Europe. They did nothing to improve the \nlives of Africans. That the railroads and other parts of infrastructure \ncould be used by the locals was pure coincidence. As such, the British and \nthe French did nothing to improve water availability or agricultural \npractices. In order to create order between Europeans, and to create \ndivisions between Africans, the Europeans drew up unnatural borders. \nSuddenly, tribes were split apart, while competing ethnicities were pushed \ntogether and told they were part of one group. European colonization \ndeveloped a social hierarchy in the colonies where the white man was on \ntop, and only the native people who sucked up to them could gain any sort \nof upward mobility. When the Europeans left, they took as many resources as \nthey could, and then they left their social hierarchy. The problem was \nthat, now, there's nobody at the top to actually make sure things run. You \ncouldn't have the suck-ups rule; they represented the oppressors. In any \ncase, they weren't sufficiently trained at anything, either. \n\nTo summarize, European colonization\nBroke existing boundaries between people, and established new, unnatural \nones (which caused quite a few civil wars)\nstripped away natural wealth of the nations\nlimited local people's to entrenched poverty\ncreated a social pyramid where everybody is at the bottom\nLeft with no political plan or powers in place",
