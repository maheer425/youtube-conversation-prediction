Right \nup until The Deathly Hallows Part 1. I don't know what happened. I don't \nknow why I stopped reading the books, buying the merch, watching the \nfilms... I just stopped. Now, here I am, 10 or so years after I first \nwatched the first film, bored out of my mind in the cinema, kicking and \ncomplaining that I wanted to go home, right up until when the trio went \ndown the trapdoor, then after that, after I start emoting for the \ncharacters as they appear to get eaten by that plant (I don't even know the \nname of it any more), I became obsessed. I read the first four books, and \nlistened to Stephen Fry's honey-sweet voice read the next two to me, and as \nI say, I went to all of the first-day screenings, and received A LOT of \nmerchandise as Christmas and Birthday presents. But now, 10 years later, \nhere I sit, watching a fan-made YouTube video of the life of a person who \nis probably my only creditable childhood idol, and I haven't even seen his \nlast film. Probably the most important film in the entire series. Harry \nPotter has been most of my childhood... and I haven't even got closure. \nWhy? Why have I allowed this to happen? Why have I allowed myself to be \nruined the ending, when before, just a few years ago, I could have read the \nbook or gone to the first day release?... And to think... I used to be the \nbiggest Pot-Head around... Oh God... What have I done? Child Sam would not \nbe proud. I even seem to recall one of the Harry Potters being the first \nfilms I ever cried to... I couldn't say which one, though...\ufeff",
