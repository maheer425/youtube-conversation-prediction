Just like I prefer to hold a book in my hand, \nand not read it on a computer screen. Nothing wrong with the technological \nadvancements, but folks will always prefer the technology that they grew up \nwith. And yes, you're still a kid. My own daughter was born in 1998. =)\n\nI do believe that some of them would not have any physical photographs, \nthough. Many households have completely switched over to digital.. *shrugs*",

That was the point of most of what I've said: physical \npictures and film will ALWAYS fade, no matter what, but digital \ninformation, as long as it's backed up and updated once every so often, is \nas eternal as it's keeper/s.\n\nAlso, yes, estimated.  However, they're estimations based on quantified \nnumbers that formed a definite grouping pattern.\n\nAnd, yes, there are plenty of ways to store bit-based information for - \nhypothetically - thousands of years, but you can already print data on \npaper with QR codes.  With a modified QR reader designed to handle 16 or 32 \nbit blocks, you could print or inscribe as much information as you wanted \nto on any physical object.  Printed bits and bytes are nothing new.\n\nPlus, the method to manually decode QR codes is also EXTREMELY well \ndocumented, which means that QR codes now will be decipherable for as long \nas they and at least one codex or cryptographer physically survive.",

Nothing beats the personal connection you \nget from touching a real life photo of a loved one that is long gone or \ngood times you had when you were young.

Its not the same bringing up digital photos on a \nphone and sharing it with people. Its not, personal.  \n\nWith old cameras you really had to be careful when taking a picture, the \nwork the set up for something the could inevitably be a bad shot but turns \nout good is something worth cherishing. Kids are spoiled today. They can \ntake 100 shots per minute and just pick the best one. Convenient of course, \nbut its just not the same.\n\nThe problem here is not that technology has made kids lazy, its that its \nmade them less human.

I think), the MPAA's \"physical\" copies of film will last \nonly ~200 years before they begin to degrade irreversibly, and that's \nassuming the MPAA can keep those physical copies in that microclimate for \nthat long.\n\nIf you want to preserve permanent media quality, you HAVE to convert your \nmedia to something that can be copied infinitely and without error, so that \nyou can have an unlimited amount of backup files stored in an unlimited \namount of places.\n\nThis is the philosophy of people who like storing files on torrents (not \njust illegally distributed movies; people like The GIMP Foundation, or \nother GNU publishers; lots of people have a copy, so if one distributor \ngoes dead, there will be hundreds more to pick up the slack).\n\nAlso: we'll always have the technology to read old data unless the world \ngoes completely tits up.\n\nPlus, you don't even have to worry about it all that often.  Data is so \neasily converted to new formats, it's silly.  For example: when you upload \na YouTube video, YouTube re-encodes the video several times in several \ndifferent formats within a matter of seconds, even for files several \ngigabytes in size.\n\nThis isn't a problematic question, either.  You may subjectively like the \nidea of film slides more, and you're completely free to choose to store \nfilm in film slides instead of digital scans of film slides, but \n*objectively* it is 100% quantifiably better for longevity of image \nquality to keep image scans of your film slides and just transfer them onto \na new backup disc and re-save them in the newest .jpg or .png or whatever \nimage standards every few years.",

Think how 80year olds \nfeel,they had record players and no TV sets even as kids in the 30s and \n40s. 50year olds had arcade machines in the 70s when they were entering \ntheir teens only,also 70s console games and Sony walkman became a thing \nonly in the 80s. 40year olds remember laser discs(not CD) for music/films \nin the 80s,and betamax/VHS tapes as well as the game consoles and computer \ngames in the early/mid 80s. 30year olds remember when the internet \ncame,when laptops came. CDs came in early 90s. I got my cassette player for \nmy 10th birthday,a CD player in 2004,an MP4player in 2008. Kids don't know \nsuch devices. I remember when nobody had cell phones,when there were no lcd \nmonitors or Tvs. I used a bloody rotary phone! And yet, at 25,you realize \nit's not that important if kids remember this or not,some kids will learn \nhistory of it on their own,and as adults people learn anyway of it.My mom \nhad her own processing of photos in a dark room,also a slide machine for \nslides(!),black and white photos actually too till the early 90s. I recall \ngoing to rent a VHS often as a kid,they had those here into the mid00s at \nleast,and VHS dominated till early 00s,despite DVD coming in 1995.

                "text": "Having digital cameras and digital storage is awesome. I don't care what \nanyone says, it's FAR more reliable than physical photographs and film \nnegatives. Digital data is VERY hard to destroy. Your computer or \nhard-drive screw up? Then pay someone to retrieve the data. In the case of \nphysical photographs, if those get destroyed via flood, fire, etc then they \nare gone. Data can be retrieved from hard-drives even in some of the most \nserious fires. All that being said. The digital camera age, has given \nvirtually everyone in the world the notion that they are a photographer. If \nyou can't take an old manual SLR or even an automatic film camera like the \nones they used in this video, and take a picture and KNOW that the quality \nand composition will turn out well, then you are NO photographer!!!\ufeff",
