I can \nusually fall asleep pretty easily afterward, but the attacks are still \npretty bad. I think that mainly it's because I'm the kind of person that \nneeds stimulation almost constantly, or I'll get stuck in my head and start \nworrying about things. And nighttime is when things start winding down and \nother people go to bed. It's gotten to the point where the idea of sleep \nitself starts to frighten me.\n\nAs far as Chorophobia goes, I get scared when I'm asked to dance in public. \nThis fear came from when I was in 7th grade and everyone was dancing. I \ntried to dance, despite knowing that I couldn't, and was immediately shot \ndown by just about everyone. Some were laughing, some were giving me faces \nof disgust, some were even getting mad at me for wasting their time, I \nguess was what it was. The next day everyone kind of looked at me funny. I \nnever wanted to experience anything that disheartening again.\ufeff",

                "text": "I have Trypophobia. I get very uneasy and freaked out when I see tiny \nholes.. especially when clustered together. For example: makeup mirrors \nthat zoom as close to as your skin pores freaks me out; along with honey \ncombs of bee hives, rain drops on loose dirt, bread sometimes, Surinam Toad \nwith their offspring, close up of eyes ( as semi cool as it looks ), garlic \nwhen cut... this shit freaks me out so much my skin is beginning to crawl \nand now I feel sick.. \nIs this unreasonable? That's an opinion, but it simply grosses and freaks \nme out.\n\n I think it started one day when I was in my elementary years.. I shook a \npine tree after it had rained and the raindrops on the branches fell onto \nloose dirt beneath... leaving multiple small holes... I stopped and stared \nat it in shock.. it made me think little maggots were going to crawl out.. \n( I also hate maggots, if that ties into this phobia? ) .. the recess \nsupervisor had to tell me recess was over and walk me to class because of \nthe strange trauma it gave me.. I remember that day being the first time I \nfound my phobia.. of course I was too young to know it was a real phobia.. \nand now my friends love to search trypophobia on my Google searches at \nschool when I'm not looking.. they think its funny.. I suppose it kind of \nis if I were on the other end, but I'm not. Anyone else relate?\ufeff",

I know it's unreasonable, but sleep terrifies \nme. My other fears are pretty bad too. Deer- which stinks because there are \nhundreds of deer where I live. I'm afraid of them because I've been charged \nat by 3 deer. I'm also scared of bridges. That's bad because my family goes \non road trips a lot. That means a lot of bridges. Sleep, deer, and bridges. \nNow aren't those common phobias? \ufeff",

When a Christian says \"Jesus \nis going to rapture me\", are they stating that Jesus is going to violently \ntake them away, or are they stating that he is going to rape them?   I am \nan X minister who knows the Bible extremely well so be careful with your \nreply.  The term rapture does not appear in ANY version of the Bible, and \nthe belief in  a rapture  is only  found in watered down parts of \nChristianity or  New Age Cults.  No Catholics believe in the rapture, and \nno Protestants believe in the rapture.  This superstition is only prevalent \namong churches that haven't been around for too long.  If you are depending \nupon RAPTURE to save you then you are screwed.  ",

When a person is uneducated in a subject, that is what \nthey fear.  People who have experienced death, have no fear of death.  \nPeople who have been through physical, or mental torture, tend to not fear \nthose things because they know that they can survive them, or overcome \nthem, the alternative is only death.  People who grew up staying up all \nnight,  working all night, or not running the lights at night, have no fear \nof the dark.  Some people are afraid of spiders.   They fear them because \nthey have never studied them.  You fear, only what you do not understand.  \nThe better educated a person is on a subject, the less they fear.  It is \nonly when a person's knowledge of a subject is quiet limited that they fear \nsomething.   Therefore, fear is of the unknown.   The less that the person \nknows, the more they fear.  It is not to say that one does not gain a \nhealthy respect to avoid certain potential life threatening situations.  \nAvoiding those things is not the same as fear, in fact that is actually \nwhat is referred to as MORALS.  Learning the moral to the story.  If you \ncan learn by the mistakes of others then you have MORALS.  If you survive \nyour own mistakes then you will develop NO FEAR..",

But \nit's the irrational fear of whales. I have a very different form of \ncetaphobia though, it's not just the big whales, it's any defined whale. A \nkiller whale does not frighten me one bit because it's an \"orca\" which is a \nbranch of whale but more... Less frightening to me. I can be afraid of any \nwhale you put in front of me but if you put something that isn't a whale \nbut looks like a whale in front of me, I wont be terrified. I think it's \nthe dorsal fin that makes it less frightening. But I purely hate my \ncetaphobia because it's stupid, I can't go to any water park with whales in \nit.\ufeff",

Fear of sex and \nrape.. I think every girl find this morbidly intriguing.. in a terifying \nway xD . Fear of clowns, yea, they can be creepy. It's even worse if you're \nsensitive about scary stuff. \"Fear of numbers\", huh? I'd rather say the \nunpleasant experience with them probably because you're not good at math. \nThe social phobias you wrote are common too, when we're talking about \npeople like you <.< , you seem quite an introvert otaku.. so these are \nslightly worse but not even close to what I experienced. The others are \njust silly, you just find these repulsive, because you're not into religion \nxD . Conclusion: You have no phobias, my dear, unless you find yourself \nwith a feeling of imminent death, doom, your heart beats like a hammer, you \nhardly breath and your mind is covered in dark thoughts when one of these \noccurs in your mind, like I felt when I was forced by circumstances to \nreturn to a social enviroment.. c:",

A phobia is when you literally \ncant do anything because you're so scared, your heart feels like it's going \nto burst out of your chest, you cant breathe properly, you just want to run \nand scream and get away from the thing thats causing this. Even just \nthinking about that thing can bring about a reaction. \"Ewww a spider!\" isnt \nArachnophobia. Arachnophobia is when just seeing a spider web terrifies \nyou, you couldn't bear to even think about being in the same room as one, \nand if you were, you'd probably start hyperventilating and burst into \ntears. When you start claiming you have all these phobias, you undermine \nall the people who really do have serious fears, and who cant go about \ntheir normal daily lives because of them. Stop attention seeking. Nobody \ngives a fuck.\nRant over.\ufeff",

If you are \nafraid of clowns, it is irrational, and therefore a phobia, if you get \nmildly mad at clowns for no reason, it's a phobia. For instance, I myself \nhave entomophobia, and though I only very rarely receive panic attacks \nbecause of this, it is still a phobia. Severity has nothing to do with \nphobia, the irrational part is the important part. A fear of being stabbed \nmultiple times in the neck, is not a phobia, because it is rational, the \nfear of drowning, also not a phobia, but the fear of knives, and the fear \nof water itself, those are phobias.",

Sorry to say dude but if I remember anything \nfrom psychology class it's that phobias are often totally irrational and \nthe people who have them very often know that, but that doesn't make it \npossibly to just get over it. Many phobias form from one or more \nexperiences in a person's life that make them either consciously or \nunconsciously associate a stimulus (the thing they become afraid of) with \nextremely unpleasant feelings. Some fears like the fear of spiders are \npossibly a semi-innate fear passed down through generations from a time \nwhere spiders might have been more dangerous, just as some people fear the \ndark etc. My deep fear of injections and blood tests for example is mostly \nirrational and I know that, but I will always associate those needles with \ngetting vaccinated as a kid and the fact that it happened to hurt a lot at \nthe time and the nurses were scaring me. I know someone who has a severe \nfear of dogs because they were chased/attacked by one in childhood and \nnever forgot it. People usually know there's no reason to fear the thing so \nmuch, but the mind is a complicated thing making it impossibly to just \nshove that fear away permanently. It takes time and sometimes certain forms \nof therapy or gradual exposure to get over it.",

So let's make some things clear and hope you understand \nclearly;\n\n- Just because someone is a homophobic doesn't mean they're a freak of \nnature. Guess how gays were viewed for thousands of years? Freaks of \nnature. Guess how blacks were viewed when the religious crusades of the \nMedieval era started? Freaks of nature. However, both are natural.\nNow in the modern world, we have phobias being recognized more often. Fear \nof bugs, animals, the colour yellow, water, heights, even fear of ducks \nwatching you. And if there's phobias, there's misplaced anger. So why is \nHomophobia bashed on? Because only Homophobia has been recognized \nthroughout history (At least as the biggest one).\n\nSo with that in mind, you have *no valid* reason to bash on Homophobia. You \nwouldn't like it if I bashed on your fear of people, would you? As a person \ntrying to change their ways to be better, you're being pathetic about it; \nintentionally avoiding keeping an open mind in situations and throwing \nnarcissistic rants.\n\n- Speaking of open minds, you pass of Homophobia because I only developed \none justification. Guess what? Homophobia almost levels on fear of people \nif the person is paranoid enough. So I *dare* you to shoot down the one \njustification that - by the way - covers your phobia as well. Go on, I'm \nwaiting.\n\n- Another changing issue you're facing is you're *fighting* something, not \ncalmly resolving it. You may as well be the KKK expressing their opinions \non non-Whites; that's accurately how you're handling this.\n\n- And you're being *highly* hypocritical. You bash on +Ethan Ball (Among \nother Homophobics) like they're being keyboard warriors whilst defending \nHomophobia, yet here you are caps locking your poorly constructed argument \nand destroying any structure you make. You basically defeat your own \nargument.\n\nIn summary; Grow the fuck up. If something exists, there's probably a \nphobia for it. And if there is, you have *no right* to shoot it down like \nan abomination. Otherwise you simply show yourself off as any religious \nxenophobe of the religious crusades, and any decent person will not want to \ntake you decently, if at all.",

I can sacrifice myself if it means to save others, \nand my life had meaning. Someone can slit my throath for all I care so long \nif I lived my life happily, and I wouldn't give one damn......... Honestly, \nnone of that matters to me, but what does is the fear of dying before I \nachieved something that I really wanted to do. If you want to kill me, you \nmay or may not actually get my permission (depending on the situation), but \nonly do it when I achieved something that I can die happily with. Of \ncourse, it's not like I want to die, but I'm not exactly afraid.",

I think it started when I was little and, like \nmany, I was afraid of bugs because they were things I didn't commonly see \nand looked foreign. However, that fear never went away and got worse.\n\nFor instance, a couple months ago a brown mamorated stink bug landed next \nto me in my room. I charged out of the room and began crying and \nhyperventilating in the hallway, and I wasn't able to go into my room for \nanother half hour.\n\nFlies and smaller insects like pantry moths don't bother me, but bigger \nones make me go insane. The thing I hate is how people belittle me because \nI'm terrified of a 3 inch creature I could easily squash. I know it's \nirrational and stupid, but it doesn't stop me from being afraid!\ufeff",

Now let me explain this part. The other day I played this \ngame called \"Lego:Star wars III\" with my little brother. Now if you ever \nplayed that game you would know that you can go to space with your ship. So \nI was going to space when suddenly my little bro triggered some mission \nwhere you had to destroy all the bombs in space to progress. I was 'kinda' \nok with it untill lots of them started to explode. Idk how I felt, I guess \nscared. I felt like when all of them started to explode, they started to \nspread. You know, when a bomb goes off, it's smoke and remainings go way \noff into the distance. So when all of them went off I just realized how big \nall of that was and I got scared. Really. Maybe some of you know how it \nfelt. I know that it was just a video game, but I felt so afraid. The way \nall of the bombs went off, the way they spread, and the way the universe \nwas so big. A strange, but scary sensation went through my head when I saw \nall of that, and I felt afraid. Does anyone know what that phobia is?\ufeff",
