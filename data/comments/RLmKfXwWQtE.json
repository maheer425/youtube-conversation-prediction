Also, to my \nknowledge, the one child policy is not entirely compulsory in China, just \nvery strongly encouraged by preferential treatment for those who follow it, \nand sanctions for those who don't.  I've also heard stories of women who \ndecide to have a second child being bullied by their community into \naborting it. Sex selective abortion, however, is strongly discouraged (I \nthink actually it's technically illegal), and families in rural areas whose \nfirst child is a girl can apply to have a second child without sanctions.",

When the population pyramid been first used (maybe as early as 1950's), \nthe social norm at the time was male and female. Adding other genders to \nthe chart will greatly use time, funds and resources to retroactively move \npeople around and impassible to ask what gender were they when the person \nis already dead and gone. Resulting the databases to be broken for \nforecasting population.\n\n2. The population pyramids counts only the physical state of the gender, \nnot mental or emotional, This is because there are biological differences \nbetween between man and women that the data needed to focus problems that \nan area can face. Say there is a disease that targets only one gender, the \nworld heath organizations got to take the best estimate to produce and \nsupply any medications for that area and reduce fatalities. If the other \ngender is in the chart, they will either make too little for the few that \nis not considered male or make too much that the time spent making them \nwill use travel time, increasing the wait times for the ill.",
