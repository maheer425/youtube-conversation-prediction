Like, for example, wanting a tiger because they're pretty and \nsomeone's favourite animal. But that's where the thinking stops. They don't \nactually realize all of the effort they'd have to put in to properly take \ncare of them. It's very selfish. They're doing it for themselves, not the \nanimal.\n\nEvery pet I have owned (or own) I have put in hours of research and then \nspent a lot of money to make sure they are as happy as can be. And for the \nmost part, a lot of pet enthusiasts are like that too. I want my pets to be \nmy friends, and as my friend, I will take care of them as best I can and \nensure they are happy.\n\nYou know you're taking care of your pets right if you take them to the vet \nfor whatever reason and the vet compliments you on their overall health. <3",
