The humans who ate \ncooked foods on a daily basis survived while those who ate raw foods ended \nup dying off. (in theory.) Although I agree that our intelligence cant be \nattributed to just cooked foods, they definitely play a part in doing so \nconsidering that most ancient civilizations were hunter-gatherer and relied \nmainly on hunting prey. Plus really your smoothie example doesn't stand \nbecause, well come on, as consumerist as the world is right now, just about \neverything is sterilized and produced en masse, which was definitely not \nthe situation back then. As in, do you really think mesopotamians had \naccess to easily digestable bananas, milk, and other popular fruits we have \ntoday?",

Thank you for repeating what the \nvideo already said. Did you just now learn that?  \n\nFruits are VERY high in energy, you do not need cooked foods to supply your \nbrain with sufficient energy.  There are many theories on how humans gained \ntheir intelligence, but what conclusive evidence is there to support this \nidea of cooked food being attributed to brain development?  \n\nIf humans developed their intelligence from cooking food, how did they \nstart cooking in the first place?   I eat about 1500 calories a day half \nraw half cooked, and I can safely say i think way more after eating raw \nfood during the first half of my day than I do from eating cooked food at \nthe end, Often times I wake up groggy til I make a banana smoothie, then \nbang I am ready to go and have energy most of the day, sometimes I need a \nsecond one, but my energy doesn't dwindle till I eat cooked foods.  \n\nCooked foods did not led to brain development.

However, animals \ndo eat raw meat and do not get sick. Most diseases caught from raw fruits \nand veggies are caused by run off of animal farms or poor storage \nconditions.  I am referring to diseases like cancer, heart disease, liver \nproblems, adrenal problems and in general organ related illness. Cooked \nfood would also refer to processed foods as well. Raw food diseases are \ntypically related to poor handling in some way.  \n\nRaw foods are better for the body in that they contain enzymes. Enzymes are \nproduced by the body when needed, but most wild animals produce few if any, \nthis is because they get them in their daily diet.  Because of cooking and \nprocessing most humans have an enzyme deficient diet.  Enzymes break down \nin heat and in general over time, therefore any food that is cooked is \nenzyme deficient,  When the body has to produce enzymes the liver enlarges \nand organs that produce enzymes are constantly working to pump them out. \nThe body can only produce so many enzymes in one lifetime. This slow \nprocess leads to many diseases we have today.  Cooked food is not easier to \ndigest because of the lack of enzymes, raw food digests itself therefore \nthe body can do other things like produce energy for the brain etc. ",

                "text": "I must respectably doubt the conclusion that multitasking is not possible \nfor energy-saving reasons. There is a ton of things that everyone \nconstantly multitasks and many of which are complex enough that computers \ncannot or are challenged with doing. Consider the example of Driving and \nhaving a Conversation with someone next to you. You don't have any computer \nthat can have a conversation with you and interpret natural language like a \nperson. You also only now have prototypes of self-driving cars that can \noutperform most humans. Now, how come we can do both? At the same time? \nCompete on multitasking with a women and you will find you lose most of the \ntime. A simple change of gender (that is not simple at all), improves \nmultitasking extensively and yet I'm sure it's not because she gets more \nneurons activated at a certain moment. In my understanding, multitasking \ndepends highly on coordination of smaller tasks. Coordination on your brain \ncan never stop, it might be underloaded or reduce frequency but it would be \ncaos if it stopped. The reason we can multitask complex things with \npractice is that the unconscious progressively learns some coordination of \nand offloads the conscious coordination. That's why with practice you only \nthink \"I'm heading home\" and you find yourself parking your car there \nwithout being aware of the subtleties of clutch-accelerator-break \nequilibrium. So in my view, we are outstanding machines in regards to \nmultitasking. And again, I sincerely doubt that it has anything to do with \nenergy management.\ufeff",

Our brains are very \nreal machines and their architecture frames their abilities with specific \ntradeoffs. I think the case you gave about talking on the phone was a very \ngood example of that. The frequency of context switching and it's \nconsequences on quality of memory access seems to be one such tradeoff. \nAttention and concentration are key skills of our neo cortex that play a \nrole in this tradeoff as they compete for the opposite end of multitasking. \nNonetheless it's not a static tradeoff. We seem to have some margin to \nconcentrate or multitasking as necessary. Nice Talking to you too :)",

In the real world, \nmultitasking is simply accomplishing two tasks simultaneously, regardless \nof the neurological methods used for doing so. And reading back to your \noriginal comment, I really don't disagree with much of that either. I \nbelieve my argument was while the video talked about the neurological basis \nof multitasking, you were referring to real world multitasking, where the \nneurological setbacks aren't always so obvious. But you clearly understand \nwhere I was coming from, and vice versa. One note, the fallacy and gross \nexaggeration I mentioned were in reference to what multitasking consists of \nand that one could call every aspect of our body a fantastic performer of \nmultitasking, respectively. Neither of those statements were referencing \nthe definition, just my own examples. And I most definitely will look into \n\"thin slicing.\" Good talk. ",

The only way \nI could have multitasking in the way you express is with two disconnected \nbrains instead of a coordinated one. Switching between coordination of \ntasks is the only way we can get it done on a computer no matter how many \ncores you have. Coordination is by definition a centralization problem. \nParallelization of work is not always possible. Two good examples are the \ncalculation of prime numbers and the calculation of Fibonacci numbers, \nbecause they are series defined by their previous instantiations. (by the \nway, there is a prize on the first that would make you millionaire... And \nalso break the foundations of modern cryptography). So when you say that \nthis definition is fallacious or a gross exaggeration you are missing the \npoint that even if we were perfect parallel machines we skill wouldn't \noperate in full paralell mode. By the way you might find interesting the \ntheory of \"thin slicing\". I read about it in a book from Malcolm Gladwell \nnamed \"Blink, the power of thinking without thinking\". Thanks for sharing \nyou opinion. If you want me to elaborate on anything you disagree or where \nI wasn't clear just question it ;)",

                    "text": "That is solid thinking, but they have actually done some research on the \nlack of multi-tasking that occurs in instances such as driving and talking \non the phone. However, I agree in that by the definition of multi-tasking, \nyou would be doing such, but as far as neuroscience is concerned, \ninattentively driving down the road while listening to someone talk is not \ntrue multi-tasking. Looking at it physiologically, the brain switches \nbetween the two tasks very quickly, allowing you to stay on the road and \nunderstand the phone call, however in every instant, one is only doing both \nactivities at a fractional efficiency. The more things you do at time, the \nmore poorly you will do at all of them, even if it doesn't show so \nobviously as driving off the road. Women's brains are better at switching \nfrom one area of attention to another, thus making them more efficient at \nperforming multiple tasks at once, however the same effect occurs. memory \nof the phone call is significantly decreased, and lack of attention to the \nroad causes terrible reaction time and a lack of awareness of surroundings. \nAnd breaking down these tasks to simple functions that occur at once, such \nas the pedals of a car and the clutch, is a logical fallacy in itself, as \nyou could say each of our cells is performing multiple functions, thus we \nare performing millions or more tasks at once. I know that's a gross \nexaggeration, but the point is when we learn to drive, all of those tasks \nare learned as one. Someone who learned to operate gas, then brake, then \nclutch, with never using all three at the same time, would be terrible at \ndriving. It is all bundled into one task, as far as our brain is concerned. \nWhen it comes to your main point of energy management, I can't completely \ndisagree with  that, because I do think other variables are involved.",

Inner parts of the brain is always working such \nas involuntary actions of heart and breathing as well as other parts \nreceiving inputs or waiting for inputs like hearing, seeing, sense of \ntouch, smelling, etc. at their individual cycles.\nCerebrum brain cycles very quickly: waking consciousness ranges from 12.5 \nto 30 transitions or cycles per second.  \nAnd new studies show both grey matter which is the smallest portion of the \nbrain once thought to be only places where neurons formed memories and \nother complex activities appears to be wrong.  White matter are of the \ncerebrum has been observed to change shape over time after learning motor \nactivities. \nhttp://io9.com/5681378/mysterious-white-matter-may-be-more-important-than-gray-matter-in-your-brain\nSo we use all of the brain. And it cycles very quickly.\nEssentially, the 16% is describing how large bursting activity happens in a \nseries instead of all at once in cycles.  But if all of your brain wasn't \nworking; it wouldn't receive those bursting cycles up to 30 every second \nand continue the brain activity.  And if all of the brain lit up 100%; \nlikely many of the interrogative parts of the brain that specialize in many \nareas such as speech, motor function, facial recognition, etc. would get \ntoo much  cross information (some parts of the brain and concept forming \nuse same regions or mixture of regions for different things so data would \nget mixed up) causing you to ignore the stimulus of 100% burst activity, \nunconsciousness, seizures, spasm, or become extremely confused and \ndisoriented until it was reduced back to the lower numbers mentioned in the \nvideo.\nAnalogy to turning all transistor paths on a computer to on. You'd get \nscrambled confusion... just an analogy but it'd be something like that.  ",

I think you need a little more open \nmindedness to absorb and analyse their views. Different tasks require \ndifferent sets of neurons to fire and it is a highly inter-connected \nnetwork. Even if you are able to supply the brain with infinite energy or \neven just over-feed, it is of no use because you cannot simply force a \nbrain to work harder. When was the last time your brain was activated many \nfolds just because you ate too much food? You have to ask yourself whether \nactivating the whole brain is really necessary. Why would you want to drive \na car home and at the same time cook or to remember your nightmares, and \nmillions of other things? The perception will simply be too chaotic and \nwill lead to nothing but failure in what you had to do (i.e. drive home). \nMost multi-tasking would most likely involve some common set of neurons to \nfire. If there is a over-lap of inputs from two different tasks on the same \nneuron/set of neurons, the brain will automatically tag confusion and you \ncannot perform well. There is reason to how our brain has evolved in this \nway to be better efficient in one work at a time. I love the human brain as \nit is. It's just that we have to understand how it works in order to excel \nat our tasks.",

I would guess \nbased on the information on how the human brain works from this video that \nif 100% of our brain was active at any given moment, so as to say that \nthere was a current running though all of the billions and billions of \nconnections in the brain, we would lose touch with \"the real world\" as \nJonathan Lyng mentioned before me, but in a much deeper sense. I believe \nthis level of interconnectedness between the full scope of our memories, \nand the complete awareness of the present moment would greatly affect our \nsense of reality. I believe a brain of this type would begin to perceive \nthose parts of reality that are normally much too subtle to grasp, like \nseeing the effect of time in evolutionary theory. Perception of time for \nthat matter might change altogether with the person being able to \naccurately determine futures due to the combination of complete awareness \nbetween all their past experiences and present positioning.  In quantum \nmechanics there is an experimentally proven phenomena called the \nmeasurement problem, roughly speaking it describes how the act of measuring \na body at the quantum scale actually alters its state, classic example \nbeing a cat in a box that you can't tell is dead or alive unless you open \nthe box and look inside. In quantum mechanics, that cat is both dead and \nalive at the same time until you check, and I think a brain with 100% \nactivity would perceive the world in that way, it would have the capability \nto see the superposition of all the states of the universe.

Cytowic  First of all, I am honored that you find my idea \ninteresting.\nWell, I never actually thought about how to supply infinite energy as I am \nmore curious about what could we achive if we somehow do it. What would be \nthe capabilities or limitiations of brain in such a scenario.\nAnyway, I would try to answer your question to the best of my understanding.\nI dont think that applying infinite energy instantaneously (using \nelectricity etc) would do any good. The \"10% at a time\" limitation is \ninduced by nature so that the body could sustain energy hungry brain. But, \nwhat if we start overfeeding it. Brain feeds on glucose like the entire \nbody. An athelete needs extra glucose cause he consumes more. Same can be \nthe case with brain. If we supply increased amount of sugar in a controlled \nway and force our brain to \"exercise\", that is to activate more than one of \nregions at a particular instant, we might be able to extend the limits. I \nguess, what I meant to say is to force the brain to evolve. It would take \nyears to make changes, but I dont think that million years of evolution \ncould be reversed in seconds. The possible faults in the idea:\n1) altering glucose balance can be harmful.\n2) changes in an individual wont be transferred to its progeny, i.e. \neverything would need to be started again.\n3) Brain might not actually change.\n\nNow, if we are impatient and we want to do it in seconds only. Then, we can \nflood our brain with 'some' molecule which can act as an alternative source \nof energy for neurons and has the property of ~100% renewability based on \nenergy input from other source of unharmful energy. UV rays can cause DNA \nmutation, it might be possible to find a energy providing molecule which \nreplenishes itself using energy from, for example: ultrasound. ",

Or \nlisten to Welcome to Nightvale and work on a puzzle. Isn't that \nmultitasking too? Or is my brain just switching from task A to B and back \nso quickly that I don't realize it?

Thus, such statements imply that plant-based and raw diets are \n\"unnatural\", and that it's not possible to get enough calories on such \ndiets to fuel the huge human brain. This is not the case.\n\nOf course industrial food production makes it easier for everyone (no \nmatter what they eat) to get more calories now than early in our history.\n\nJust as the idea of us using 10% of our brains became a cultural value, \neven more so engrained is the idea that humans are meant to consume dead \nflesh.\n\nI suppose I'm saying we should always be suspicious when science reinforces \ncultural norms.\n\nShall we take on hemispherical asymmetry next? ;)",
