He says \nthe same things in all interviews and repeats the words/phrases \n\"enormously\", \"entertained\", \"never in my wildest dreams\" \"extordinary\" etc.\nTom is a VERY good actor, but I feel like he's way too overated and Chris \nis very underated. If fans just took the time to notice how he acts in the \nmovies, as much as they do with Tom, all the attention would be directed \ntowards him.\ufeff",

Later on that day we went to go watch the new \nThor movie with some of my friends and afterwards we played videogames \ntogether. He was like an older brother to me. Then I woke up and I told my \nfriends and they made fun of me for having a dream about a muscular guy and \nI made fun of them for not having a dream where Chris Hemsworth was like \ntheir older brother.\ufeff",
