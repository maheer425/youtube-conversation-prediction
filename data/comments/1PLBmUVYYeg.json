The common knowledge \nat the time was that cholera was believed to be caused by \"miasma\", that \nis, toxins in the air. One man did figure out the real cause.\n\nJohn Snow, a physician in Britain sat down with a map of London during the \n1854 outbreak and looked at where people had died of the disease. He \nnoticed they all seemed to be getting sick around the Broad Street water \npump.\n\nSnow went to examine the pump and noted that it drew water from the Thames. \nHe noted that a sewer drained into the river near where this pump drew its \nwater. This was pre-germ theory but Dr. Snow was convinced that, rather \nthan miasma, *something* in the water was killing people.\n\nSnow went to the authorities who refused to act. Snow then went back and \nupdated his cholera map. Soon, a few people died who *didn't* live around \nthe Broad Street pump. He went to the relatives of the deceased and learned \nthat these people might not have lived near the pump, but they *were* \ngetting their water from it. Dr. Snow knew that if alleged miasma had been \ncausing the problem it wouldn't have killed those who just passed through \nbut his deadly water theory fit perfectly with these findings.\n\nSnow returned to the authorities with his now indisputable evidence. They \ndetatched the handle on the Broad Street pump and the cholera outbreak \nstopped.",

For instance, his thesis in Guns, Germs, and Steel \nsuggests that Spain conquered the Americas not because the Spaniards wished \nto do so, but because the conditions were right for it to happen. Again, \nthis is technically true, but ignores the decisions and personalities of \nthe people involved.\n\nHis books are fine as far as pop history goes, but I think it's a mistake \nto refer to him as an 'historian'.\ufeff",

For \ninstance; I don't think there has ever been a historian who could do a \nbetter job explaining deep time subjects than evolutionary biologists, \ngeophysicists, or astrophysicists. A historian has little to no business \ntalking about things that old because their field is defined by its \nanthropocentric bias.\n\nHumans are already too ready to claim that they are intentional actors. If \nthis were true, we would not behave like a physical fluid when you get a \nlot of us together -- so much so that they are commonly called \"crowd \nfluids\" [1,2,3] in simulationist terms. In fact, this is how we simulate \nhow well emergency exits will work in buildings. Real life fluids are also \nconfusing and unpredictable on small enough scales. Individual atoms are as \nhard to predict as individual humans, but on a larger scale, they both \noperate in a predictable way in relation to their environment. A few \nthousand atoms (people) may differ from the prediction, but that's \ninconsequential in the broad sweep of the movement.\n\nWe -- just like everything else in the universe -- are incredibly \npredictable when acting as a group, and if the conditions are right to do \nsomething -- chances are very very good that we will do or have done it. \nThe purpose of history is to help us understand potentially uncomfortable \ntruths about ourselves, not reinforce easy myths of our own grandeur.\n\n1. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041164774900276 2. \nhttp://www.researchgate.net/publication/224010877_On_the_fluid_mechanics_of_human_crowd_motion \n3. https://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/06-5-1.pdf",

In addition pneumonic plague lacks the classic swollen \nlumps (or 'bubos') that are written about in historical literature.\n\nBubonic plague on the other hand has a longer timeframe from infection to \nsymptoms of around half a week and is a little less lethal. Importantly it \ndoes cause bubos in infected people - bubonic plague being a Yp infection \nof the lymph nodes causing them to swell.\n\n*shrug* Hope someone else finds that interesting.\ufeff",

As \nmuch as cats kill other things, it tends to not be as large creatures as \nrats, usually small birds and rodents. So the effect of less cats is \nprobably quite neglible compared to the cultural tendency to not bathe \n(although dry cleaning with strips of linen was popular by the mid-15th \ncentury) and the winter vests peasantry favoured for six months of the year \n- the vests were effectively wrapped around and stuffed with straw or some \nother insulation, and pretty much never removed for the whole winter \nperiod, so fleas could easily breed and survive within.\nContrast this with the Arabic world at the time (cats weren't hugely \npopular) where cultural practices of bathing, regular changing of clothing \nand cleaning of laundry with 'Al-Kahli' chemicals would mean a much more \nflea-free environment.",

For those who might be interested, she has \nbooks available http://www.amazon.com/Jacalyn-Duffin/e/B001HMRLP2.\n\nLovers and Livers is particularly interesting - \"disease\" is actually a \nvery complicated subject.  Just ask yourself, what is a disease?  My entire \ncourse was centered around this one question.  In the West, we usually use \nthe \"medical model\" which says a disease is bad, cureable, and affects the \nindividual.  But consider terminal cancer - it's still bad, but we talk \nabout strengthening an individual and community organizations have been \nbuilt addressing cancer.  This isn't all philosophical - palliative care, \nharm reduction, and psychiatry all follow very different practices from \nother medical fields.\n\nThis also needs to be looked at from the context of history.  The four \nhumors, especially as understood by Galen, were the basis of Western \nmedicine - for over 1500 years.  Today we would consider it pseudoscience, \nbut for all that time, it was science.  I think that's an important history \nlesson!",
