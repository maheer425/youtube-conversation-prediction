It's great to watch the experience of some actors leveling up \ntheir career or performance but I wasn't convinced that this is an Oscar \nworthy performance though. I still think Rosamund Pike will get that crown \nbut I'm hearing a lot from Julianne Moore in Still Alice for the prize as \nwell. Interesting race...and great review Grace!

                "text": "Hi Grace! Just wanted to give you a little history on this movie that you \nmight find interesting. The screenwriter for the movie originally wrote \nthis as a short story (also called 'Cake') that appeared in The Kenyon \nReview. In the original story, the main character is deeply unlikable and \nhas almost no redeeming qualities. It actually made the story very hard to \nread, because it was obvious that she was in a tremendous amount of pain, \nbut was so awful to everyone around her that it was very hard to sympathize \nwith her. For example, in the story she get's Nina's address by threatening \nto sue the support group for emotional distress. Looking at the movie, it's \nobvious they softened the character a lot and I'm guessing they might have \ntweaked the ending to make it more palatable. \n\nSorry for the long comment, but I got super excited when I recognized the \nstory and thought you might think its path to becoming a movie was \ninteresting too. Have a good one!\ufeff",

                    "text": "I disagree. It's a common concensus that the Best Actress cathegory this \nyear is weak, weak, weak. First of all there's is a lack of female centered \nmovies this year. There's Gone Girl, Wild, Still Alice and Cake that are \nabout it, of course there is still Two Days One Night, but that's not a \nHollywood movie and The Hundred-Foot Journey, Under the Skin and so on, but \nthey aren't considered Oscar-worthy stuff. And of these movies, I've seen \nGone Girl and Still Alice and I hated them both. And to be perfectly frank \nI think Still Alice is only an awards contender because of Moore's lack of \nan Oscar, her performance in the film isn't even that particularly good, \nStill Alice, very much like Cake seems to be - I don't know yet, since I \nhave not yet seen Cake, but Still Alice is a cry-shout to the Academy for \nan Oscar for Julianne, that's it, it's not a good film. So we basically \njust have Rosamund Pike and Reese Witherspoon as the leading ladies of \nhailed movies. That's not much! And if we look at the Best Actor race - it \ncould not be more tense. Filled with great performances and I feel like in \na normal year, even Matthew McConaughey from Interstellar could be in \nconsideration but this year, it looks like, he has no hope of winning. \nThere is Michael Keaton - a frontrunner for the win, Jake Gyllenhaal, David \nOyelowo, Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Steve Carell, Channing \nTatum, Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connel, Gael Garcia Bernal, Oscar Isaac, \nTimothy Spall, Chadwick Boseman, Bradley Cooper, Tom Hardy and Brendan \nGleeson, this list not even including Kevin Costner, the cast of Fury, Mark \nWahlberg, James Corden - so that's 16 men and 2 women. - well if you \ninclude Johansson, Cotillard, Felicity Jones maybe, and fine, Julianne \nMoore - it's still 6 women, I'd say it's a pretty weak competition... \nESPECIALLY when the predicted winner is someone who would be getting it as \na \"career award\" not for the performance itself.",
