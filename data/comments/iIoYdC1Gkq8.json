TL:DR version: \nPeople pay money to advance in the game, then when the game gets difficult \nor repetitive, they believe they should keep playing anyway since they've \nalready sunk X amount of money into the game. \n\nCandy Crush uses psychology to literally addict players to it. The cycle of \ndifficulty in the levels make it so that your brain thinks you are getting \nbetter by making a few levels very easy than ratcheting up the difficulty \nso that you can only fail. After several hours the difficulty does lower to \nkeep you playing even if you don't want to pay, but most are pressured into \nbuying to advance. Then once you've put your own money into the game, your \nbrain basically says \"well, we've spent this much already, might as well \nkeep it going\". This is followed by another series of easy levels making \nyou think the investment is worth it until it ratchets up the difficulty \nand the cycle continues.\n\nIt's the same strategy that old arcade cabinets used. Easy at first, then \nsuper difficult so you have to spend more quarters to keep going than super \neasy to make the investment seem worth it etc. ",
