                    "text": "+Bloodyravenheart13 I agree. Five Nights At Freddy's 1 you have to close \nthe doors and make sure not to use up all your data because there's no way \nyou can regain it back, but they also add a few more character's every time \na new night starts. So that's pretty scary. But they also do that to the \nsecond game. Five Nights At Freddy's 2, you have to wear the Freddy Faz \nBear head to trick the old auto mechanics into thinking you're Freddy Faz \nBear because that'll be the only way they leave you alone. But when they \nstarted talking about the Fox, he's a new mechanic, so the head won't work \non him. But he has a second friend with him, so both of them aren't tricked \nby the head, you have to wind up the music box and flash the lights \nsimultaneously at them. The little boy laughing and saying \"Hi.\" you have \nto wind up the music box because the lights nor the head would work on him, \nso you have to wind the music box so he'll leave. So I agree with him \nbecause actually you're more stressed than scared. Sooo, in my opinion, \nFNAF 2 is a lot more stressful.",
