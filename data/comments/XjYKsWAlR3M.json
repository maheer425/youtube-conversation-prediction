Different words symbolized zero, or nothing, such as \"void,\" \"sky\" \nor \"space.\" In 628, a Hindu astronomer and mathematician named Brahmagupta \ndeveloped a symbol for zero \u2014 a dot underneath numbers. He also developed \nmathematical operations using zero, wrote rules for reaching zero through \naddition and subtraction, and the results of using zero in equations. This \nwas the first time in the world that zero was recognized as a number of its \nown, as both an idea and a symbol.\n\nIts beyond any doubt that concept of zero and the matric system was \ninvented by Indians since ancient times. Infinity and Zero are not new \nconcepts to Indians. Arabs learned many things from Indians as knowledge \nwas transfered while trade and Arabs took this to Europe. Europeans were \nthinking that the number system was invented by Arabs till recent time. \nAfterwards they called these as Hindu- Arab numbering systems. Not only \nzero, the trigonometry and very complicated theorems in applied methamatics \nand precesion calculations about solar system orbits and palnetary \nmovements were known to Indians. In my opinion, the mathematics was not \nbare additon and subtraction for accounts purpose but it was so developed \nto study astronomy and universe. The idea of infinite universe was not new \nto Indians. ",

If I took a nap this afternoon and woke up to \nfind myself on the overnight train from Luxor to Cairo, I would think maybe \nI died and I was in heaven. I'M NOT JOKING.\nI described Cairo using harsh words to illustrate it for Westerners. If you \ntook a typical Westerner to where the minibus taxis gather on the north \nside of Ramses Square -- across from the train station -- they would \ncompletely freak out and panic. They'd be freaked out until some Egyptians \nask if they're OK and if they need help. People asking how you are \ndoing doesn't happen in Europe or the US where you could die on the street \nand nobody will say a word. I ate dinner in an Egyptian home withing 24 \nhours of arrival. So, yes, I loved your country and I'm sorry I gave you \nthe wrong impression.\nNice meeting you in the digital world. If you and your family ever come to \nLos Angeles you're all welcome in my house. Peace",

First, the Mughal empire was more Mongol and Turkish based \nempire as the ancestor of the empire, Timur, was Turkish and claimed to be \nthe great khan, trying to be a successor to the Mongol emperor Genghis \nKhan.  They did not take over India until the 17th-18th century. Before \nthat, there were only small regional kingdoms like Gujarat and Calicut that \nwere heavily based in trading connections. India's revolutionary math \nconcepts came mostly from the time of the Gupta and Mauryan empire in the \n10th century (or earlier I believe) . The math we now currently have came \nfrom Arabia and the Muslims word during the Abbasid caliphate. With the \ncultural and educational capital of the world at the time was Baghdad, \nrevolutionists began to create this base-ten system. India contributed and \nadded on to what the Muslims started. After the fall of the Abbasid \ncaliphate from Mongol invasion, India was severed from any relations and \nfell into bickering wars between kingdoms. The crusades were in the 13-15th \ncentury, when they fought against the Abbasid caliphate. Then the Mongols \ncame in the late 15th century and overthrew the Delhi sultanate in India. \nAfter this, the different khanates were established. The Jagadai khanate of \ncentral Asia, led by Timur, flowed into India and Timur's descendants \ncreated the Mughal empire. There were no crusaders anywhere near India \nduring the Mighal empire. The only sort of crusaders were in the late 15th \ncentury Spanish reconquest of Iberia, but no crusaders fought the Mughals. \nThere were no Muslim world other than the Mughal empire in the world, and \nthe crusaders were in a different time period.
