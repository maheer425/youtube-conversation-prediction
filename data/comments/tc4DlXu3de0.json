I have bought one of the 55 gallon drum from a \nlocal food store that i have been using for a about 6 months now to collect \nthe RODI water for my weekly water changes. when i bought this drum i had \ncleaned it up thoroughly and let it dry. after about 6 months of usage i \nnoticed the Phosphate level in my tank was showing high.. i checked my rodi \nunit and the tds meter was showing 0 so the water was good. i checked the \nphosphate on the water coming directly out of my rodi and the test showed \nbetween 0.4 to 0.2ppm however i had some rodi water in the 55G drum and whn \ni check its ph it showed 0.64ppm so i know that was the source of the \nphosphate being high in my tank. My question is if you collect rodi water \nand keep it untouched for some days or untill next water change will that \nslowly increase your phosphate since the water in the drum will have no \nmovement...i have always liked the idea of setting up a water change \nstation for my 150G setup to make life easier but i am worried to collect \nwater and leave it there would effect the water quality? \ufeff",

The switch is placed \nat the normal operating level of the sump. The controller is programmed to \nturn on a small pump for a set time each day, and this pump sends water \nfrom the sump down the drain (typically 1% of the system volume). After \nit's done running, a second pump in the makeup salt water reservoir turns \non, and refills the sump until the float switch tells it to turn off.\n\nThere are important considerations with this setup, such as having some \nsort of redundancy to eliminate disasters from controller or switch \nmalfunction, and the ability to disable auto topoff during the water change \ncycle. Also, the  water change process needs to automatically disable \nitself if the reservoir runs dry. These things can be easily accomplished \nwith a versatile and reliable controller.",

It was tricky \nto \"tune\" it to always pump out as much as it pumped in. There were two \nproblems: One was that the back pressure from the reservoir changes every \nday due to the falling water level inside it, so the amount added to the \nsump changed daily, whereas the amount being pumped out of the sump was \nconsistent due to the continuous water level in it. So there was a constant \nimbalance. The solution was to have the pump take its replacement water \nfrom a container placed on the floor. This container has a high-volume \nfloat valve in it that leads to the reservoir. When the pump starts pumping \nwater, the float valve falls and water flows into the container from the \nreservoir. So, the pump is always drawing water from the same height. Once \nthis problem was solved, the other issue was to get the two heads on the \npump to have identical flow rates. The water \"out\" side pumped more water \nthan the water \"in\" side. This was solved by putting a plastic ball valve \non the submerged end of the tube that drew water out of the sump, and \nrepeatedly testing both halves of the pump by using it to simultaneously \nfill two 5 gallon buckets for a set amount of time and weighing them \nafterward. The ball valve was adjusted until the weights were identical, \nand the system was tuned.",
