Stun-Guns and Tasers deliver an \nelectric shock to stun the target, they don't electrocute (unless something \nhas gone horribly wrong and the target dies as a result of being shocked).  \nGiven your context, Hanks question probably should have been \"why don't \nthey shock themselves?\"",

The man did *very* well for \nhis time, but much of his taxonomy is outdated today (and he did much more \nthorough work on plants than he did animals). Mind you, I say this as \nsomeone who works at a Linnaeus museum and has a lot of respect for him as \na scientist and thinker.",

We can *recognize* different groups by some \nsimple superficial characteristics - most mammals have fur, for example - \nbut whales are still mammals by definition, because even though they lack \nfur, they share a common ancestry with animals who do (we call this a \n*monophyletic* group).\n\nThis is also why we don't call any legless lizard a snake - no matter how \nsnakey it looks, snakes are an exclusive taxonomic club, membership of \nwhich can only be inherited. :)\n\n... Of course, this gets very complicated when some members of a group \nevolve that are so different that we want to put them in a parallel \ncategory. For example, because reptiles, birds and mammals (including the \nplatypus!) all evolved from amphibians, systematically speaking they *ARE* \namphibians. You're an amphibian! (And a fish, for that matter!) But that \ndoesn't seem very helpful, does it?\n\nThis is where we get *paraphyletic* groups, which exclude a few lineages \nthat are descended from them. Class Amphibia is a paraphyletic group, \nbecause most of the time when we say \"amphibian\" we mean \"amphibians except \nreptiles, mammals and birds\".\n\nParaphyletic groups are rarely used in formal systematics, but in daily \nspeech we use them all the time because it just gets unbearable otherwise. \nFor completeness' sake, there are also *polyphyletic* groups, members of \nwhich look the same but are unrelated (typically because they have a body \nshape that is universally useful and has evolved many times in different \ngroups). Polyphyletic terms include \"worm\" and \"tree\".\n\n\ntl;dr: Yes, a platypus is technically an amphibian, but not for the reasons \nyou suggested, and not in a way that anyone except a systematic biologist \ncares about. :D",

Top # lists and trashy attention \ngrabbing headlines?\n\nIf the last 3 months are any indication, it won't be long before we start \nseeing videos with titles like \"Top 10 ways science improves celebrity \nweddings!\" or \"5 scientifically guaranteed positions to make him/her want \nanother 'cram' session!\".\n\nIf this is the direction you Want to go with your channel, then go for it. \nI'm not going to step on anyone's dreams. But I certainly will not be \ncoming along for the ride.\n\nNeither will my money.\n\nI just cancled my SciShow subscriptions for YouTube and Subable. Thank you \nfor the interesting science news over the years but if SciShow is not going \nto be a show that concentrates on Science, I'll spend my time elsewhere. I \nhope I check back in a while to find that you have come back to your roots. \nUntil then.\n\nGood day.\ufeff",

I'm just looking back at my \nwatching history and noticing that I am skipping 9 of their videos for \nevery 1 I watch.\n\nI funded them because they were educators who made science entertaining, \nnot because they were entertainers who scraped together a few overly \nsensationalized facts to feed the masses.\n\nI'm sure there are some that feel differently than me, and if you are among \nthem, great! However, I don't feel the need to justify my decision in a \nseries of replies. If SciShow wants more feedback from me they know where \nto reach me.
