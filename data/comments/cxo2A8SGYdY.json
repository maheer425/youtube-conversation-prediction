                "text": "I feel like I am most like Cinna. He really supports Katniss and helps her \nbecome the best he can be. He brings out the best in her. I bring out the \nbest in people around me because I always try and make people feel the best \nand that they are always welcomed. Like, in the first movie, Cinna \nsupported Katniss when she had to go talk to Ceaser. Katniss was so \nnervous. All Cinna said was to act like she is talking to him. That is \nsomething I would say to a friend that is nervous about something. Plus, \nCinna also loves fashion... So do I!! Overall, I am most like Cinna because \nhe is supportive of the people around him.\ufeff",
