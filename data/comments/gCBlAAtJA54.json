If you \nwere of importance to the country, which I assure you, you are, *you* \nstopping *me* from saying harsh things makes *you* a borderline dictator. \nWhich means you are the pure opposite of what USA stands for.\n\nJust a side note, USA isn't the only country researching cancer. Have you \nbeen blinded by the great Uncle Sam's national pride? Pretty sure the UK \nare doing more research than USA. Egypt is also a big help. So is \nAustralia. The list could go on.\n\nPretty sure Red Cross was created by Switzerland folks, fool. Hence, their \nflag and the Red Cross symbol is the same, however switched colours. Many \ncountries have their own Red Cross organisation. Just because America has \none doesn't mean they created it.\n\nSpace exploration and research *would* be happening, because the Soviet \nUnion were researching within the same time as USA. Russians were the first \npeople in Space. Americans were the first people on the moon.

The chances \nof a sentient race emerging in the amount of time we have been around, \nmaking them theoretically less advanced than us are very giant actually \nbecause the universe in infinite and all and there is infinite chances for \nsentient life. HOWEVER there are hundreds of billions of years before we \nachieved anything at all. So that number of races born in that time IS \nexponentially by like a number that does not have a proper name higher than \nthose that are less advanced than us. Upvote if you agree with my logic",

The answer is of course, we cannot.  As far as SETI is \nconcerned, it remains the biggest boondoggle and waste of money in UFO \nresearch history, in my opinion. They're already here, and have been for \nthousands of years.\n\nAs far as the imminent theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking's \"hands off\" \napproach to UFOs is concerned, simply ignoring a visiting alien race would \nnot be any more productive than the proverbial ostrich burying its head in \nthe sand.\n\nThe question may not be, \"Are we ready for aliens,\" but, \"Are aliens ready \nfor us??\ufeff",

Turns out, they KNEW what they were doing, \nthere's  a fucking CITY there. Mount Sharpe is a 3 mile high ruin. Not only \nthat, MANY people have posted enlarged images FROM THE NASA WEBSITE which \nclearly show structures, technogogy, and even living humanoid creatures as \nwell as apparent animals. \n     The fact that NASA released these images without their usual airbrush \nadditions indicates to ME that they're getting ready to acknowledge what \nwe've been discussing.\n   As to moon bases, I've seen such in images from NASA, JAX, even Google \nMoon. Get out from in front of your moniter, go outside with a 30x or \nbetter 'scope and look for yourself. you can see them from here on a clear \nnight. Sometimes craters are illuminated like sports stadiums. Astronomers \nhave been illustrating, and writing about, them for the past 400+ years. \nWhy do you not know this? Or do you and are simply convinced you're a \nrepresentive of the only life form contained in an almost infinate 45 \nbillion year old universe?\n    Lastly, the few times in DID smoke crack many years ago, I saw Ninga's, \nNOT aliens.",

I began a search for 'the truth' about \n45 years ago as I was seriously considering going into an American Baptist \nseminary (hey, we tend to follow our parents programing). Since then I've \nlearned that most of what religion taught as truth, isn't. And much of what \nthey said couldn't be true, in fact is. Frankly, I still don't know what \n\"The Truth\" is and sometimes it sems that the more I learn, the more \nuncertain it all becomes. However....much has become SO self-evident that \nit seems to be well beyond any further serious denial, Alien life is one of \nthose things.\n     After studying the teachings of many, if not most, of the worlds \nreligious fables, as well as the stories of many different and widely \nseperated indingenous tribal historical legends, they seem to (almost) all \nhave the SAME STORY. god came down, made man, and created civilization. \nWhen everybody says the same thing, how can we deny the possibility they're \ndescribing a reality within their own reality? If we accept that they \nprobably are, then we must try to put their myths into a logical framework \nthat fits within our own understanding of reality.\n     They were ignorant of many things that we know as technology. Much of \nwhat they perceived as miracles, or magic, we can now attribute to \nscientific norms. If we can now see their 'miracles & magic' as being \nattributable to technology then we're faced with a very real probability \nthat that's ALL it may have been. If so, WHO brought such technology into \nour reality?",

(I feel like your a tad pessimistic \nsome times) but I can't listen to your videos more than once a day. The \npregnant pauses you use in your speech have a tendency to drive me up the \nwall. Your a smart guy and I want to hear what you have to say but I often \nfeel like you pause in your speech to give me time to catch up and it makes \nme feel like your talking down to me as if I can't possibly be at your \nlevel. I know it's not on purpose or that your intent is to be irritating, \nbut I felt like I should make you aware. Your a great guy and I'll keep \nwatching regardless of how you speak. I will power through!\ufeff",

I have no quarrel with your final \nstatement. In fact, should you care to look, my very first utterance into \nthe subject was praise for V's efforts and in the same post I praise his \nintellect.\n\nA therapists opinion need not be obtained as I am not sensitive to the \npoint that I think people on YouTube are talking down to me and, (once \nagain) should you care to look, during the conversation with Mr. Allen I \nsay more than once that I am assured V's motivations are genuine. Perhaps \nin reading through my first post you missed the line where I said \"I know \nthat it is not on purpose or that your intent is to be irritating,\" \nFollowed by an admission that I will continue to follow him regardless.\n\nThe issue is not what I \"Think\". The issue is what I \"Feel\". The feeling of \nirritation is comparable to the feeling that one has when you have spoken \nbut the person you are speaking to has not heard a word, or has come up \nwith an unintended meaning. I am indirectly speaking about this \nconversation of course.\n\nNow I hope I have made clear that from a logical, self \"thinking\" \nstandpoint I hold no ill motive or animosity against V. But, should you \nwish to debate further why I should not \"Feel\" irritated by the pregnant \npauses, I promise your counterpoint will have as much effect as any \nargument I could come up with as to why you should.\n\nThat said I hope the rest of your day is a pleasant one.",

But the pauses, sometimes several \ntimes in the same sentance? Dramatic effect looses its effect after \nrepeated use.\n\nAs I am sure you have more pressing issues in your life, I surrender you \nthe final word.

Columbus was an \nundereducated selfish prick looking to make a quick buck by establishing a \nnew safe trade route with Asia.\n\nI think it may be more prudent to look back at a different civilization in \nour history, if using ourselves as a template for alien behavior can be \nsaid to be prudent, anyway.  One with much more success than Columbus had, \nand one with an established academy of scientific and cultural advancement, \nwhich a space-faring race would likely have needed to achieve stellar \ntravel:\nAncient Rome\n\nThe Romans conquered much of the known world.  But every new nation or \nculture they conquered, they did not enslave or destroy.  They assimilated \nits people AND its culture and religions into the greater bulk of Roman \nculture itself.  Once acquired, children of conquered noble families were \ntaken as \"hostages\" back to Rome to be raised and educated there, and thus \nimmersed and invested in the culture of greater Rome.  This peacefully \nensured that the conquered nations would not rebel after the occupying \nforces withdrew, and that the new nation would benefit from- and provide \nbenefit to- the empire as a whole.\n\nSomething similar could be the case if dealing with a social species \nadvanced, intelligent, and successful enough to develop interstellar \ntechnology.  Perhaps some of our children, or groups of humans, would be \ntaken up to other worlds, stations, or ships, to be immersed in a \ncumulative alien culture and be educated in advanced sciences and ethics.\n\nIn my opinion, this (or equal or better alternatives) are more likely than \nan uneducated, superstitious, greedy alien space captain looking for a \nwormhole to the other side of his civilization and finding us instead.\ufeff",

However, the enormous \"frames\" that have been erected \naround these religions to support and promote them are now crushing and \novershadowing those very values, focusing instead on image, popularity, and \nenforcement of \"rules\" that are starting to lose the meaning they were \ncreated for.\n\nWe as humans have grown to a point were we are able to discover, \nunderstand, and integrate into our lives the same values and virtues from \nwhich religions originate, without requiring management by external \norganizations. Understanding these values on its own is not an easy task, \nso there is definitely a need to nurture them into our society, as to teach \neveryone the right way to find a path toward happiness, acceptance, and \ncooperation.\n\nReligions induce fear of the unknown into its followers, thereby hindering \none of the most precious abilities that we have: curiosity. Without \ncuriosity, one does not feel the need to undertake a journey into \nself-discovery, and without knowledge of oneself, we are merely reduced to \nthe state of lab mice, living to follow the paths, goals, and rules \nestablished by people from a previous era that is long over.\n\nWe are able to do as much good as religions ever did and even more, but all \nindividuals first need to come upon realization of their own potential and \ndecisive power over their lives. Once we are finally able to cope with each \nother, live together, and share common goals, we will be able to relinquish \nreligions and finally leave them to museums and history books, where they \nbelong.\n\nThe human race is capable of so much more. We are all so different, yet so \nclose to each other. If the appropriate choices are made, I know for sure \nthat we will be able to use all of our potential toward making the world a \nbetter place to live for everyone.",

But why is it that they also have the \nsame physical features as us? That also explains why they do not interact \nwith us, we are still far too primitive.\ufeff",

For example, \none of the few big predictions left is that a 'great deception' will cause \nthe world to turn away from belief in God. Consensus leans toward fallen \nangels (who can take any form and who have been given temporary power over \nthe earth and skies) appearing and claiming to be 'aliens'. Just FYI.

The world isn't beyond all hope, nor do I think it ever will be. \nPlus a fresh start wouldn't necessarily mean a better world. Much of our \nmodern world is specialised. Not everyone can be an architect or \na scientist or any other highly trained professional only those with the \ncorrect education. Unless special steps are taken to protect such \nspecialists and sources of advanced knowledge (like books) then any wiping \nout of civilization would likely take a great deal of that skill and \nknowledge. Lets say that very few doctors or surgeons survive the \"reset\". \nLife expectancy would plummet as there wouldn't be enough people with \nmedical training to tend to the sick or injured. Previously \"eradicated\" \ndiseases would likely make a comeback as no co-ordinated efforts would be \ntaking place to prevent or quarantine them. But doctors aren't the only \nspecialists we would have need of. If farmers were in short \nsupply then starvation would become an even greater threat as people \nwouldn't know the best places to plant crops or how to tend them. Life \nwould become a brutal battle between warring tribes over scarce resources \nof food, medicine, knowledge and whatever working technologies are \nleft (basically The Walking Dead without zombies). And speaking of \ntechnology, we would likely regress in that area as well due to a similar \nlack of specialists, parts and factories making new products. After a \ncouple of generations it would be back to the horse and cart, to the spear \nand shield. You say we would have knowledge of our past mistakes. Sure, we \nwould at first but not for long. Again many historians and historical \ndocuments may be lost to the reset and the few that are left would have \nlittle opportunity to make that knowledge useful. If you're in a tribe of \nsurvivors you want to join people who can be of use (doctors, farmers, \nhunters, warriors etc.) if someone's skills are \"knows a lot of stuff that \nhappened a long time ago\" but nothing else, then they won't be of much use \nto the group in it's daily struggles. The fact that people would be reduced \nto small tribes and clans would also be a problem for any hope of world \ngovernment. It would be like turning back the clocks back hundreds of \nthousands of years. We would have to build new villages, towns, cities and \nnations. In short, all the progress of human history: world wars, civil \nrights, religious beliefs, *everything* that has ever happened since the \nfirst human rubbed one twig against another to make fire would have been a \ncomplete and utter waste of time. A reset sounds good when you don't think \ntoo hard about it but when you do it turns out to be pretty horrifying.",

For example: it could be a \nlarge-scale version of US politics where you have a number of local \ngovernments which all submit to the authority of a federal government and \nelected head of state. Another possibility is a \"modern Napoleon\" where a \nvisionary leader will forge an empire (kind of like the Emperor in \nWarhammer 40k). One person being in charge isn't an inherently bad thing. A \ndictatorship is only as bad as it's dictator after all. However I doubt \nthis will be what happens as if someone set out to conquer the world (even \nif it was in a well-intentioned manner) a number of less receptive states \nwould almost certainly ally with one another to bring said leader down. \nLeft-wing ideologies like Marxism have internationalist aims but their \nultimate vision of successful revolution involves the state fading away \nonce an equal society is established. Call me a pessimist but as nice as \nthat sounds you need some kind of government structure if you intend to set \nup colonies on other planets and I just can't envisage a stateless, \ncommunal society doing that.\n\nIt seems likely to me that unification will be a gradual process going from \nlocal to continental and finally global stages. For example, I live in \nScotland. First we would have to abandon the notion of Scottish \nindependence so that the British Isles are truly united. Then we would have \nto support greater integration with Europe (in the case of Britain that \nwill involve abolition of the Monarchy - the same goes for other \nmonarchies). If that goes well we would end up with a unified Europe (this \nisn't something that would happen solely in Europe though - similar events \nwould hopefully occur in Asia, Africa, America etc.). Finally all the \nunified continents would have to come to some sort of agreement on world \ngovernment. Ideally, this would all play out without any major wars but you \ncan never be too sure about these things. Ultimately though, the form and \nevolution of world government isn't as important as the end goal. That's \njust my best case scenario.",

There have \nbeen several proposals by scientists on terraforming mars to make it \nhabitable by humans. And the human fantasy of spreading life further out in \nthe universe from earth is gonna keep living until we actually do something \nabout it. I would imagine that the first step would be to make mars \nhabitable by humans. Spreading further out from this solar system is far \ntrickier, granted. Maybe it is not possible to travel the distances between \nstars in a human generation. If we were to plan a manned mission to a \nforeign star that trip would probably take many human generations and the \nwhole spaceship would have to be some kind of ecosystem with artificial \ngravity that could sustain a breeding human population for generations. In \nsuch a scenario we would probably have sent out an unmanned mission prior, \ncontaining some seed of life that could be planted by some of our robots on \na suitable exoplanet. There it would transform the environment so it was \nready for our arrival and we would know in advance that we would come to a \nplace where we could breathe the air. Maybe for whatever reason however, it \ncould be that it's just not possible for humans to make such a grand trip \nto foreign stars across several generations. Then all the humans would stay \nhere on earth, but i still think that we would probably try and send some \nsort of earthly lifeform that could survive the trip to other star-systems, \nsuch as bacterias, just for the hell of it :P In fact life on earth could \nhave started and evolved to the point we're at today because some ancient \ncivilisation did something similar to that a few billions years ago ;)",

Sarcasm is unnatural for a man because its feminine, is that the \ncrux of your argument?\n\nYou... you do realize that the male brain still creates estrogen, right? \nJust because you have a penis doesn't mean estrogen disappears. If you want \nto talk about artificial constructs, your binary notion of male/female \nparadigm is more artificial - the trait of sarcasm being feminine has \nnothing to do with hormones, chromosomes, or genitalia. Its a learned trait.\n\nLets expand a bit further. You called him unnatural. Over the internet. \nUsing some form of a computer. News flash - human's don't act very natural. \nThe very act of making and using tools in unnatural - wood, metals, and \nsilicon all appear in nature, but the way we process them into instruments \nis not. You'll never see a Mac Book blossoming in nature. Its ironic that \nyou're calling someone unnatural because of a personality trait - something \nfrom their brain, over the internet - which is as far from natural as we've \ncome.\n\nNow, to unpack your message. He never said that Aliens don't exist. His \nargument was about conspiracy theorists.\n\nNow, saying that its possible that other organic organisms live out in the \ncosmos is one thing. Saying they've been to Earth is another.\n\nThere has been no definitive physical proof that aliens exist. You can \npoint to things like The Drake Equation, which mathematically set out to \nprove that we are not alone (it estimates about 9 other empires should \nexist, but it fluctuates wildly based on the inputs), but there is no \ntangible proof. No alien corpses. No tissue samples. No crafts. No leaked \ntechnology. No leaked photos. Not even an instrument - something as mundane \nas an eating utensil, which could be cross analyzed to determine its \norigin, makeup, etc. Nothing.\n\nAnd to say none of this has leaked in the entirety of world history due to \na shadowy cabal of people who want to keep it secret because... reasons... \nis a conspiracy theory.\n\nIf you want to argue that in some far off section of the galaxy there are \nproteins that have assembled into lifeforms is a completely different \ndebate then \"They're here\".",

If an Earth like planet formed before Earth did, \nand followed a similar process of evolution, they could be several million \nyears more advanced than us. Which would make them capable of things beyond \nour imaginations. I mean, NASA is planning to set foot on Mars with a \nliving human being by 2030. And that is not a one way trip. Imagine what we \nwill be capable of in just 50 years. If I had to guess, I would say that we \nwill have interstellar travel capabilities within 500 years. And that is \nbeing generous. We will definitely have a warp drive of some sort in 100 \nyears, assuming that it is possible, of course. Just look at how quickly we \nhave advanced in technology. 100 years ago, radio was barely a thing, now \nwe are sending and receiving radio signals to and from hundreds of \nlight-years  away. It doesn't take long to become intelligent. Plus, \nstatistics are not wrong as much as you think. Perhaps you should actually \ndo some research into this topic before you start bashing it with your own \ncrazy ideas that aren't even close to being true. There are likely 10's if \nnot 100's of thousands of planets that could support life in our own \ngalaxy. And there are 10's if not 100's of thousands of galaxy's. Most of \nthem bigger than ours. We are not alone in the universe. Also, we aren't as \nlucky to be this intelligent as you think we are. Yes, it is true that it \nis strange how we suddenly jumped in our mental capabilities and still \ndon't know how, but even just looking at other animals on Earth, we aren't \nthe only intelligent species. We are the most intelligent species on Earth, \nbut not the only one. Dogs, apes, dolphins are all examples of highly \nintelligent creatures capable of thought processes. Then can all be taught \nmath and language. Hell, some of these creatures are a lot smarter than \nsome people.",

We are \nassuming there is only one direction of intellectual development possible \nand since we've taken that direction we think that even races on other \nplanets are bound to take the same direction. But in my opinion it is very \nlikely that they've developed in a different way than us. When it comes to \nscience perhaps they've discovered different things from us, come to \ndifferent conclusions than us. \n\nEveryone is forgetting one major factor when it comes to understanding the \nuniverse around us and mastering its laws. A factor that is popularly being \ndismissed by the Earth's western civilisations as 'bullshit'. That factor \nis spirituality. What if the civilisations on other planets don't dismiss \nthe existence of the spiritual world and instead have mastered their own \nmental abilities and use these within their development as a civilization. \nWhat if they combine the laws of the spiritual world with the laws of the \nphysical world to have good control over everything in life?

                "text": "... and what if communication isn't even possible?\nIn face to face communication we humans use the voice, which is controlled \nfluctuation of sound waves. Fortunately we have ears that can detect these \nsound waves and a mechanism that can interpret them.\nBut what is being transmitted and interpreted? Well, we're transmitting \nsounds that are culturally accepted to represent ideas. If you understand \nEnglish and I say the word \"frog\" you hear the word \"frog\" and we both \nunderstand that \"frog\" is a symbol for an amphibious creature. It happens \nautomatically.\nBut if I say the English word \"frog\" and you speak German chances are you \nwill hear the word \"frag\" and think I've said \"question.\"\nOkay, because we're both human beings we share a common body type and a \ncommon understanding of the world we can still establish a limited kind of \ncommunication by using hand signals. But again, hand signals are a \nculturally accepted symbolism and in this case I mean human culture.\nThe Earth is filled with millions of different kinds of animals, but the \nnumber of animals we communicate with is very, very small. Dogs can learn \nto understand a limited number of words, and they're actually very good at \nunderstanding human body language. Some dolphins have learned to understand \nsome human words and symbols- and I can't help but point out that if we're \nso smart it ought to be the other way around.\nWe know that bees communicate through a sort of dance, but we haven't \nlearned how to communicate with them. Ants apparently communicate through \nthe use of pheromones, but we're not whipping up batches of pheromones to \ntalk to them.\nBecause we don't know how their communication works, what it's symbolism is.\nChances are we have more in common with dogs, dolphins, bees and ants than \nwe will with an alien species.\nAh ha, you say, but we will share an intellect, an intelligence, with any \nalien species sufficiently advanced enough to attempt to establish \ncommunication. There are any number of earthly creatures who exhibit what \nwe call intelligence.\nAnd we have math!  Well, math may or may not be a universal truth. \nCurrently we believe it is, and that theory is called Mathematical Realism. \nIt postulates that math is an inherent feature of the universe and that it \nexists as surely as light or matter.\nThe other viewpoint is that math is an invention of mankind that has proven \nto be a wonderful tool in understanding and explaining the universe.\nJust because we have discovered radio waves, and cannot imagine an advanced \nrace of aliens who also haven't discovered radio waves, doesn't mean that \naliens will be using radio waves as a calling card. What it does mean is \nthat we lack the imagination to consider other forms of communication that \naliens might be using.\nWe're too Earth-centric at this point.\ufeff",

But even in this solar system, if you think about it, it's so \nweird that these entire planets just sit there hardly even changing for \nbillions of years, just doing nothing, just existing. We are extremely rare \nhowever you look at it. Sometimes now when I see sand dunes or something, \nit makes me think how fragile we are. Even here on Earth where life seems \nso abundant, it's so easy for it to be scraped away and the ground left \nlooking as lifeless as Mars. Is life hardy enough still to withstand \nsomething like the asteroid that caused the great extinction 65 million \nyears ago? Maybe. Or maybe it will happen and that will be that for that.",

                    "text": "+bowser jr\nExactly, I'm glad you made that point (cells on their own are considered \nalive, but they're not themselves composed of cells). This concept has been \nbothering me for a while now. It seems to me everything in the universe \ndoes begin (is born), grows (changes), (has the opportunity to) reproduce, \nand ends (dies). So, that pattern is just everywhere. Stars do that, rocks \ndo that. Everything follows that pattern in one way or another. It seems to \nme that we confuse ourselves when we say that life has to be made of cells, \nand we have too narrow a perspective to understand the many forms of life \nthat saturate the universe. If cells are alive because they're the smallest \nunit of a living thing, then organelles also have to be alive since cells \nare composed of organelles. If organelles are alive, then how can we say \nDNA, proteins, compounds and molecules are not? I think we just draw the \nline at cells and typically ignore everything smaller we don't understand. \nIt makes sense to us that living cells make up a living body, but we then \nsay that the cell is made up of non-living stuff, which seems odd. If \nnon-living stuff is at the core of everything, that means we're not really \nalive either, we only believe we are. We think we're a group of cells, a \nliving organism, but we're just an even larger group of dead molecules and \natoms. Either 'everything that is' is alive or it's all not living but \ncreating illusions of life. But then again I think our concepts of life and \ndeath are probably poor descriptors of reality. So, no I don't think we'll \never know LOL. We can use science to make our lives more convenient and \nface the challenges of poverty, hunger and environmental crises, but I \nguess we'll never find the answers to the fundamental philosophical \nquestions.",

What would happen, I guess negation and peace would come to mind at \nfirst but I wouldn't be surprised if what christopher columbus did would \nend up happening to us as that's what usually happens to a first encounter. \n\nThe universe is infinite and its insane to believe there isn't life outside \nit but humans from modern day wouldn't be able to handle this type of \nencounter. We can barely solve our own problems without there being wars \nfor resources involved so man meets alien would equal the end of our \nworld. \ufeff",

                "text": "I have a theory that explains the Fermi Paradox AND makes a prediction \nabout how aliens would behave towards us (maybe someone has already come up \nwith it but if they have I'm not aware of it). The theory assumes that most \nalien civilizations will develop a technology like our fossil fuel-based \nindustry, which has the potential to destroy themselves. The only way to \nstop this happening is for said civilization to work together and stop that \nhappening, which will only happen in a civilization likely to be peaceful \nand easy to compromise with.\n\nThe reason this explains the Fermi Paradox is that generally the most \nintelligent species are carnivorous, they eat other intelligent species in \norder to get the materials they need to be intelligent. That means they \nhave a tendency to be aggressive and overuse surrounding resources, it also \nmakes them less able to agree with each other and more territorial. So, if \nthe majority of civilizations are aggressive, and in order to survive to \nreach a spacefaring age they need to become peaceful, then most intelligent \ncivilizations will die out at around the stage of development humans are at \nthis century.\n\nThis also predicts the way civilizations who survive will behave. They will \neither be friendly towards us because that's in their nature that allowed \nthem to survive, or if they are so advanced they don't see us as \nintelligent, they will just ignore us to preserve the natural environment, \nalso in their nature.\ufeff",

A planet which is ice cold could \nsupport life, although it will probably not be based upon water. Liquid \nnitrogen is able to do the exact same thing as water in freezing \ntemperatures (and with freezing I mean 77K or -177\u00b0C). In those conditions \nnitrogen is able to do the exact same thing as water (source: Into the \nuniverse s1e1 \"Aliens\").\n\nDiscovery Channel created a very understandable and quite fun documentary \nwith Steven Hawking, where Hawking talked about alien life. He explains \neverything from biological rules to alternatives which could also support \nlife.\n\nFunny to read you have learned a lot of our conversation, I am no expert in \nthis thing, I am just a guy really interested in this stuff ;-)",

I do \nagree that, for there to be intelligence, there must be a certain 'central' \norgan to be able to do anything remotely coherent, whether on a microscopic \nor on a planetary scale (as we don't know the limits of life). Still, even \nwith this one LCA that everything evolved from, we can see deep in some \nacid lakes lifeforms based on amino acids containing materials poisonous to \nalmost every other lifeform on earth, making the possibilities seemingly \nlimitless: what if every single material in this universe can be part of an \norganisms base structure? That broadens the concept of life immensely. All \nthis is purely hypothetical though, and I'm afraid I don't have sufficient \nbiological knowledge to present a well-argumented and factual hypothesis.

                    "text": "+BonDieu617 I agree, but life still has to follow laws in biology and \nphysics. Sure, it could be possible there is life in Jupiter's clouds \n(Steven Hawking's storm jellyfishes anyone?) or on Venus, but an \nintelligent life form, thus meaning it has a sense of living, has instinct \nand a conscious, must have specific things to be able to be intelligent, \nlike a \"brain\". Sure, it is not a mandatory thing every individual being \nmust have a brain, a hive mind which communicates with telepathy could be \npossible, but there has to be a leader with the brains to do it. \n\nLife needs energy to be able to live, intelligence needs energy to be \nthere. That is one biological rule all forms of life have to follow. Even \nthe most primitive bacteria on our Earth show some signs of primitive \nintelligence, and they all need certain elements to be able to produce \nenergy to live on. An intelligent cloud of, for example, methane just isn't \npossible, as it has no possible means to extract energy from other sources \nto be able to feed the thinking processes. Another problem will be: where \ndo these thinking processes take place? Like I said before, there must be \nsome central \"room\" where all this stuff happens.\n\nEvolution is a thing that is never finished and is incredibly variable, our \nEarth could have looked very different when not we, but another race would \nhave lived on instead of the Homo Sapiens. Still, even if there is a planet \nwith life and its origins are from a not comparable \"Last Common Ancestor\", \nthe sentient race still has to follow a path that is laid out by the laws \nof biology and physics. Yes, there is no way we already know everything \nfrom life as we know it. We do not even know what are brains are capable \nof. Maybe there are aliens who are able to use the power of their minds to \ninfluence the world around them. And maybe they don't eat like we do, but \nconstantly burn methane inside their bodies to produce the energy to be \nable to fuel those thought processes.\n\nThings you name as examples of life are possible, but highly unlikely in a \nchain of evolution. I agree, we do not have the right mindset to recognise \neverything immediately as life when we meet it, but there are some ground \nrules we found out, that life has to follow to be able to be there.",

What if life evolved from other planets from another common \nancestor? It would be completely unimaginable for us, simply because we \nwouldn't know what to imagine; both how it would look like as how it would \n'think' would be completely and utterly eldritch. We -and thus our view on \nlife itself - are severely limited by our own psychology. Alien life will \nprobably be completely different from what even the most visionary human \ncould imagine, simply because, as all we know comes from a single planet, \nwe don't know the limitations.

Which one will have a better chance to survive in a hostile \nenvironment full of predators?\n\nAnother thing you have to think about is something psychological.

Survival, the only one thing \nthat is common in any and all lifeforms.\nOnce you've reached immortality, the acts you'd do for survival lose their \nvalue, their meaning, and you'll only do them instinctively, to fill your \nnever-ending meaningless existence.",

A different medium of \natmosphere for example as you stated. But there are some conclusions that \ncan be drawn just by assessing us humans and how we became what we are.\n\nHighly evolved lifeforms must exhibit certain physiological and mental \ntraits. First of all would be something that allows them to use and operate \ncomplex contraptions. A.K.A something like hands.\n\nThey also need to be capable of conveying information, as we do through \nspeech. I would dismiss telepathy just because in a evolutionary point of \nview, it's much easier to just produce noises than to develop superbrains \nwe can't even imagine.\n\nIt is also most likely, that they need a lot of energy, as we do. Oxygen \ndoes provide that and it is very common. The evolution of respiration gave \nus extraordinary amounts of energy compared to non oxygen \"breathers\" like \ndeep sea microbes, which only make usage of the nitrate cycle. This energy \nhelped to fasten further evolution and gave us an edge over the competition.\n\nAnother very important point is knowledge. When evolution comes to a \ncertain point, scientific and philosophical advances matter more and more. \nWithout a method of storing knowledge, it becomes increasingly difficult to \ngo further. We used stone, papyrus, books and then digital methods for that.\n\nTL;DR. Any highly evolved life form needs:\n\nFunctional appendages\nA way of conveying information\nHigh production/consumption of energy\nA method to store knowledge\n\nThere are more things, just google search it\n\napart from that, almost everything is possible.\n\nAnd now I will leave the discussion to you, I have already put more time in \nthis than i originally intended xD.",

That is why we believe our time is so worth-while, \neven if we'll be dead and gone one eventually. Our conscience compels us to \nseek a life that might be positively regarded, perhaps even in hopes that \nGod will smile on it. The truth is, the tiniest sin stains our record and \nour only hope is Jesus.\nI've heard of that multiple universe theory, but, yeah, it's just a theory, \na total guess. The word universe literally means \"single\" \"spoken\", like \nwhen God created the universe by simply uttering commands. \"Let there be \nlight\" etc.\nAnyways, the Bible predicts the second coming of Christ will be long before \nwe could ever go very far into space ourselves, so I think the space chase \nis useless.",

What your saying could be applied to \neven someones life. For example: Why should I do anything in life if I know \nill eventually die? Why shouldn't I just give up now and kill myself? This \nis why I think we should just learn as much as we can and build amazing \nthings before then. The second thing I have to say is this. There has been \ntons of research on the big bang and our universes expansion and other \nthings that are similar topics to these. One of the biggest theories that \nwe, as humans, have come up with is that our universe is not the only \nuniverse. That universes are actually more like galaxies and that we can \nactually travel between them. If this is true then the heat death wont \nnecessarily actually kill us.

The only way around this \nwould be to send the value as 11101011110, but this would still leave a \nvalue that they would not recognize on their machines depending on their \nchar size.\n\nNeedless to say, this would only come through as noise to them, and you are \nmaking yet another assumption that the crew onboard their ship contains \neither a programmer or obsessive mathematician.\n\n\nBy the way, both of you seem to ignore the list of reasons that we could \nnot even contact them in the first place.\n\n\nI'm done arguing about this, because everyone that replies to me just \nfurther proves my point that humans are too arrogant and egotistical to \ncomprehend why aliens won't make contact with us.",

News flash, \ncombat is NEVER risk free, even if your opponent was unarmed and you have a \ngun, the risk factor is NEVER 0. This has been demonstrated numerous times \nin army practice lessons and war games countless times. One rookie loads a \nmortar incorrectly, 3 people dead, easy. Fighter jets collide with each \nother in air, injury free survival is fairly rare.\n\nIt really doesn't matter how many safeguards the aliens have on their \nweapons / crafts, mistakes and equipment failure is ALWAYS an option and \nwhen that happens, it is often lethal when weapons, or super high speed \ncrafts are involved.\n\nThus it is ALWAYS safer to secure uninhabited planets, ESPECIALLY since \nthere are billions and billions of uninhabited planets EVERYWHERE!\n\nThis is why even the notion of space warfare is idiotic to me, unless \nyou're talking about a Star Wars, or Mass Effect type of situation where \nyou have dozens of different civilizations interacting.

The dominant species on a planet will be carnivores; this source of \nenergy is the only one sufficient to power the brain required to form a \nspace fairing civilization. Thus, evolution will select for the \nmost aggressive.\n\n2. The dominant species will also be tribal; a species that stays by \nitself,even if it is highly intelligent, can't build a village let alone\na vessel that can travel the stars.\n\n3. Tribal societies will inevitably come to blows over issues such\nas access to resources, especially during times of scarcity. They won't \nbe driven by human nature, but they will be driven to survive.\n\n4. Over time, some tribes will come to be dominant over the others due to \nsome combination of advantages. They will be able to assemble bigger groups \nwith which they can gather more resources and power. As history progresses \nthe most successful groups will likely learn that it is best to use \npolitical means and soft power to achieve their interests rather than brute \nforce.\n\n5. As they advance to the status of a space fairing civilization their \nresource requirements will grow exponentially and they will\nseek to guarantee their access to the resources they need.\n\n6. Eventually, assuming space fairing life is common, they will encounter \nother civilizations with the same motivations and needs as them; not all of \nthese \nconflicts will be resolved peacefully and some might go on to be decades or \ncenturies\nlong confrontations. \n\nThat's what i base it on; space faring civilizations will be driven by the \nsame\nsurvival instincts we are, which is what drives conflict when you really \ndrill down\ninto it.\n\nI only have human history as a model and it might not be accurate.
