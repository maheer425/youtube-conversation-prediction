As it \ncollapses, the density becomes greater and so the gravitational field at \nthe centre (not outside of coerce). The missing part of the equation is \ntime distortion. More density = more gravitational pull = more time \ndistortion. The black hole reaching infinite density would take an infinite \namount of time observed from the outside. After close to infinite time all \nthe matter in the universe would collapse into a single black hole and only \nthen when all the matter in the universe comes together to form a \nsingularity will an actual singularity form. Of coerce we do not know what \nwill happen in such an great distance of time away, though we can \nspeculate. I do not see anywhere else where the \"Schwarzshcild solution\" \ncould become a reality and it may even be prevented from happening due to \nunforeseen physical events. Maybe as the singularity is forming all mass is \nconverted from matter to energy and thus the gravitational field disappears \nand the energy is released... Who knows...\n\nI think it's safe to say that the \"Schwarzshcild solution\" is \nmathematically correct, but it does not take all physical qualities into \naccount. It just says that in these conditions this will happen. It does \nnot say that these conditions will ever come into play in reality. Until we \nhave a theory of everything we should be careful of predictions that do not \naccount for all conditions.",

We have no way of discerning what the world \nlooks like for a brain different than ours assuming \"look\" is the right \nexpression.

The eyes of the mantis shrimp can also detect \nultraviolet and polarised electromagnetic waves. Even more amazing, each of \nhis two complexeyes is composed of up to 10.000 miniscule mirco-eyes that \nare arranged in such a clever pattern that each complexeye is able to \nperform 3D perception on his own. That means the mantis shrimp is able to \nuse one eye to target potential prey while the other eye is on lookout duty \nfor other predators.\nBottomline: No, humans are not the only animals that can see colours and \nthey do not even have the best colour perception.",

By using those \ncolors, you're effectively using colors outside of the ultraviolet \nfrequency, which means that it's not an accurate representation of an \n\"ultraviolet only\" view of an object.\n\nOr, a better example, dogs can only see reds and blues (I think), but if \nyou tried to show a dog the greens that humans can see (such as on grass), \nyou can only use a combination of the reds and blues to represent it.

I find alot of these topics \ninteresting, like the crows in japan that use crosswalks to crack walnuts, \nas well as some of the other adaptations seen in \"Smarter Every Day\"s \nexploration of the Brazilian Rain forest. For example, SED came across a \ngroup of caterpillars that moved in a stack, communicating through tactile \nmessages. By crawling over one another they covered ground x times faster, \nx being the number of caterpillars in the stack. He also came across some \nspecies of spider that used its silk to create a fake, larger 'puppet \nspider' to ward off predators. \n\nHow and why are animals coming up with these skills? What's your input, \nMike? \ufeff",

So people put people \ndown to feel they are up, when really they should tear down the bad stuff \ninside and rebuild with positive thought forms. Now what i mean by comfort \nis the whole fact that so many people are comfortable being miserable, so \nthey don't move for fear of things getting worse. For example a person lost \nin the freezing cold  woods at night may stay in that spot and never move \nif they have a blanket and a pillow. I don't know how to word things right \nbut stick with me here for just a sec. Imagine if we cracked the code on \nhow to stop this in every persons life.  We would all progress drastically, \nI have someone in my life who I care for dearly, but for years she made \nbad....really bad decisions and even started smoking crack. Then she had an \nepiphany. Once she moved out of her bad thought forms her whole life \nchanged. she was happy. To this day she is clean and generally only makes \ngood choices. \ufeff",

Magnetic north is basically where a compass always points to \n(well in the southern hemisphere it points South but the Compass and maps \nwere mainly used by northern civilizations). \n\ntrue north is the position the earth is relative to the sun and the axis \nthat the Earth spins on. An old sailing technique is using a scale to \ncompare the angle of the Horizon with the Noon sun (The highest point the \nsun is in the sky), this creates a certain amount of degrees. On the true \nequator the Sun is almost directly above you at 0 degrees. In say New York \nthe sun is actually more on the southern part of the sky with a horizon \nangle of about 42 degrees (This is why latitude coordinates use angular \ndegrees). Both of these are very different.\n\nInteresting right? Magnetic north and true north poles are actually \nhundreds of miles apart.\ufeff",

That's the \nreason aura lights only happen closer to the poles, because the magnetic \nfield is strong enough on those places to interact with charged particles \nfrom the Sun.\n\nIt points south in the southern hemisphere because when you cross the \nequator heading south you get closer to the southern pole, the magnetic \nenergy from the southern pole becomes stronger than the northern one and so \nit points south. Compasses point to the strongest magnetic influence and in \nthe south that is the south pole. The reason we have north as north is \nbecause a majority of modern 1ST world countries originated in the northern \nhemisphere. Sumeria, Greece, Rome, China, England, the US etc, most of the \ngreatest civilizations and societies that ever lived have been in the \nNorthern hemisphere, which is why the map is the orientation it is today.",

Earth is concave, space/the universe is inside Earth along \nwith only a few small planets, reason why NASA told us certain type of \nplanets near by our world, Earth has a sky ceiling up 60k miles surrounded \nby ice, so when that ice melts you're all looking at a great flood.  \nEverything you were ever told in school, on tv, movies, your parents, NASA \n\"scientist\" \"astronauts\" they lied they altered the maps because they don't \nwant you to know how truly big Earth is.\n\nDark Matter is Dark Water and this is where it gets interesting,  If you \ndon't believe me, go to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico you'll see a brine \nlake underwater, yes underwater.  It is surrounded by muscles, you'll see a \ndark area where you can see further into like an opening but you'll just \nbounce right off of this dark super saline substance which is Dark Matter \nbecause dark matter is dark water, you all have been deceived by mother \nnature, we are separated from the heavens and she did a pretty damn good \njob of fooling all of you.  I don't know how else to explain this call me \ncrazy if you want but this is the god honest truth.\n\nNASA cons you for money, they're the biggest fraud in history.  They hire \nartist and use CGI and Adobe Photoshop to alter the image into a ball when \nreally they filmed the moon landing in Hawaii and Mars, Nevada desert.  \nAnyways IDK who this Jew is talking in this video, but yeah, I'll just \nleave it at that.\ufeff",

We only percieve time one \nslice at a time, rather than the whole that it really is. \n\nBased on what I understand of the theory of the Ten Dimensions, the idea is \nlike this. If one dimension is just a single line, to create a second \ndimension, we stack these lines on top of each other in either direction to \ncreate a plane. The third dimension follows the same rule, stacking these \nplanes (think of them as sheets of paper) up and down creates three \ndimensions, the way we percieve the world. If a creature that was only made \nof two dimensions, and only percieved two dimensions traveled in three \ndimensions, he would only see one sheet of paper at a time. However, \nbecause he is in three dimensions, he is free to rotate any direction he \npleases. The same is true for the fourth dimension. It is an infinite \nnumber of three-dimensional existences stacked up upon each other. Seeing \nas we only exist in three dimensions, we are able to move freely in the \nfourth dimension, but can only perceive it one slice at a time. \n\nWorking upwards, there are ten theoretical dimensions making up reality as \nwe know it, created by different possible origins of the universe and \ndifferent possible 'dimensions' housing other 'realities'. If you want to \nknow more from people who have actual degrees on the topic, just look \naround you tube for videos uploaded by universities and their students (be \nsure it's reputable though.)

That last question is going too far into the more \nrecent, and abstract, modern physics concept, so I'm sorry if it's hard to \nanswer.\ufeff",

As for my use of the word \n\"abstract,\" I meant to use it in the more rhetorical term, which actually \ndoes mean complex; I just wanted to use a different word other than \ncomplex. Also, I am a bit uneducated of the Higgs; however, I was speaking \nof the energy that used to actually \"find\" it in March of last year now, \nsomething like that, right? Anyways, apparently all that I've learn of it \n(that it gives mass to objects and it's the reason why some matter can be \npassed through each other) may have actually been either not clarified, or \nsimply wrong. I know it does have to do with mass; however, due to the \nsource of the information stating that it was the \"God particle,\" it leads \nme to believe that it follows the exaggerations used in the one book, the \nname escapes me, however.

The rest of the body will be left to oxidize and break down into \nmore stable atomic components.

The earth would \nprobably be pulled around via other celestial bodies' gravity and given an \ninfinitely large universe it would eventually hit something.  It might also \nget captured by another star and orbit it.  The earth would be under \nconstant night and temperatures will drop to well below zero.
