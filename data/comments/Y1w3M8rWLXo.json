Learn to reflect and think about the criticism, rather than \nimmediately denying it, like you did. grey autonomy may have been over the \ntop with swearing and name calling, but that doesn't make their comment \ninvalid. Good people, loving people, people you look up to and like, \nthey're all going to make mistakes. Pointing out the mistakes isn't \nbashing; it's helping them become better people.\n\nYou said grey autonomy was making the assumption that people were offended; \nyou're making the assumption that no one was offended. You say lack of \nevidence is your evidence, but that's so flawed. There are so many reasons \nwhy people might not have said anything; maybe they're too shy, maybe they \ndon't want to rock the boat, maybe they don't want people telling them to \nsuck it up and stop being \"oversensitive\". \n\nHasn't someone ever said someone hurtful to you, but you decided to let it \ngo and not say anything because you didn't want to start an argument? \nHaven't you ever disagreed with someone but kept your mouth shut because \nyou didn't want to have to defend yourself?\n\nI'm not saying that there are for sure people who were hurt by it \n(personally, being raised by immigrant parents whose English isn't that \ngreat, I know that it hurts them when people belittle them for it, or joke \nabout it, because they're trying, so, actually, yes, I do know for sure \nthat some people are going to feel a little hurt. It might not even be \nhurtful enough to comment about it, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt), \nbut the point is that there are people who could be. Even if EYK viewers \nweren't too offended by it, it doesn't make the behaviour itself OK. Like \ngrey autonomy said, if I went up to a group of black people and said the n \nword, but none of them were offended by it and maybe even though I was \nbeing funny, it doesn't make it OK to say that word.\n\nEvidently, this isn't getting through to you because you're too busy \ndefending Simon and Martina, but I hope you at least think about what I \nwrote, and I hope that you learn to be more considerate of others.",
