There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the Earth at this \ncurrent time. Each human roughly consumes 40000 litres of water in their 80 \nyear life time. So you're already looking at 280,000,000,000,000,000. This \nis 0.0002% of the total worlds water. Not thats in 80 years, how long have \nhumans been around? Granted the population is lower the further back you \ngo. But even 800 years at the current population is 0.02% of the whole \nworld's water. So that's humans accounted for. What about the 8.7million \nother species of animals? Chickens, there are currently 7x more chicken in \nthe world than their are humans They drink water. Cows? 1.5 billion, theyre \nbig animals! Sheep? 1.2billion. Then insects, even insects respire. There \nare literally TRILLIONS of mosquitos. Who drink sugar water from plants and \nblood from other animals. If humans make up 0.02% at a small estimate of \n800 years. How could the rest of every animal (including big thigns like \nelephants that live in hot climates) not add up to over the total of the \nworlds water. Admittedly some water will be used again and again, but that \nis most likely the water on the surface that will evaporate and rain into \nyour \"non-tainted\" supply. \n\nThe pure chance you've never drank any ex-waste is just so mindnumbingly \nsmall. Especially since the number of molecules in ONE glass of water is \nabout 8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. There are just so many molecules \nthere, and they all get mixed up. You're looking at the probability of \nevery single molecule in that glass and every single molecule in every \nother glass not ever being in a cycle. Multiplied together! Thats stupidly \nsmall numbers multiplied by huge numbers of other stupidly small numbers! \nIt pretty much =0. But I do admit there is a teeny tiny possibility which \nis definitely less than the probability of being able to predict what and \nentire family says their entire life as they say it purely by guesswork.

I visited Boston's municipal sewage \ntreatment plant. The latest tech, from sludge settling tanks, scum skimmers \nto a dozen 11 story tall anaerobic digestors which treated and separated \nthe processed water, while turning the solids into fertilyzer. The water \nwas discharged into the ocean, and monitored constantly. \nNoticeably cleaner beaches and harbor, where seals & porpoises frolic. \n\nMy job then as a state licensed (3-I) Industrial Wastewater Operator was to \nprevent industrial effluent from 'contaminating' the raw sewage from \nmetals, cyanide, formaldehyde, oil & grease, solvents and other nasty \nstuff. I did this with chemical treatment, microfiltration, ion-exchange \nresins, and reverse osmosis, and had to comply with state DEP parameters. \n\nFor those fans of 'Boston's dirty water', sorry.",

The same geology that \ngives us exciting earthquakes also gives us geysers and steam fields.  The \nproblem is, in the fifty years since the steam fields were developed for \npower generation, production has fallen off because the source was becoming \ndepleted.\n\nAbout ten years ago the nearby cities decided to kill two birds with one \nstone; they build a pipeline that ran 20 miles uphill to injection wells at \nthe geysers and now pump huge quantities of tertiary treated wastewater \ninto the ground, replenishing the steam fields.  Now they don't have to \nworry about releasing treated wastewater into the nearby river and the \nwaste generates clean electricity.

Many humans have mental disorders \nthat can inhibit proper human to human relations and functions, effectively \nmaking them useless in the working world. Medicines are created to \ncounter-balance or nullify these things in order to make the individual \nmore functional. These medicines are taken pretty much throughout the \nindividuals life, and many contain chemicals that are not very good for \npeople who don't have any problems the medicine is being used to treat. In \naddition, not every medicine works with the same person the same way, which \nis why two different people could be taking two different medicines in \ndifferent dosages to treat the exact same mental disorder (bipolar, \nAsperger's syndrome, anti-stress/anxiety medication for people with OCD, \nADHD or Asperger's etc). Although the chemicals are made to be broken down \nand used, they can have an effect on human waste, such as increasing the \nacid and nitrate concentration in urine, and I wouldn't dismiss the \npossibility that some of the chemicals are also left behind in feces as \nwell. This could be potentially harmful if used as fertilizer, as the \nplants will absorb the elements from the broken down chemicals, and may not \nactually use them at all, which could lead to people getting sick, even \nfrom fruit, as the tree can absorb these elements through the roots \nregardless of whether or not in needs them. \n\nOf course, large waste treatment facilities such as those used in cities \nfor treating sewage, are very effective in removing all kinds of \nnon-organic chemicals and elements from the sewage, effectively making any \nfertilizer created from it pretty much safe for use. I just wouldn't use \nHumanure myself as it could potentially cause an overdose of my own \nmedication, or make me sick from the broken down chemicals used for the \nmedicine having potentially toxic effects on the human body when not in the \nform it is intended to be used as. such as Sodium chloride (sea salt/ table \nsalt) being made from highly explosive sodium alkaline metal and poisonous \nchlorine gas, but when combined, becomes a harmless food additive if taken \nin small amounts as well as an actual biological agent our body requires in \ncertain amounts (it does absorb water fairly well though, and if too much \nsalt is the human body, it can cause dehydration and even death.

It seems that the \nhormones in birth-control pills can have enough remaining in human effluent \nthat it can effect the reproduction cycle of some amphibians, by making it \nso that they are nearly all born as girls, which makes reproduction \ndifficult.

Lunch is usually 30 minute. Elementary \nschool and middle school usually start later in the morning and get out a \nlittle later (8 to 9 am). This way the older kids will be home when they \nget off. Middle school has around 7 classes just like high school. \nElementary students (k to 6th) are usually in the same class most of the \nday. They too have a 7 hours or so school day. Lunch is also 30 minutes and \nthere is about an hour of physical education/recess per day (though some \nhave less).

I found a document in which it \nwas said that in 2008, 65000 people in the entire country (0.4%) do not \nhave their homes connected to a sewer. Of these people, 40000 (0.24%) had a \nseptic tank. Couldn't find any more recent data, unfortunately, but I think \nit's safe to assume that 99.6% of the population drops their waste into the \nsewers. That's how things are in the Netherlands. If you don't have access \nto a sewer system, you're special. Access to the sewer system is probably \nconsidered COMMUNIST in the US (technically it's socialist, but not many \nAmericans know the difference), as it is the local government making the \ndecision for you that you should have a sewer, which comes with its own \ntaxes and stuff.\ufeff",
