It's the \ncommenters and how everything happened.\nEvery single thing he did resulted in getting hit in the face even though \nhe tried to do the opposite, the irony in that is amusing. It's also how \neveryone else on his team was such an idiot and the doctor was hilarious. \nIt's also how the goalie  himself reacted to it that was funny. So no, I \nshould not be \"condemned\" for sharing this video saying it's hilarious, and \nyou don't know us so you really can't say that either. It's really very \ncondescending. This is is also the wrong use of the word \"bully.\" I'm also \nwilling to bet the people who laughed at this also felt sorry for Neymar \nwhen he got that horrible back injury during the game. Some might have \nlaughed saying it looked funny before understanding how serious it became.",

By the time they did that, the Americans knew of the \nsport as soccer, and they never really stopped calling it that since they \nhad created their own football.
