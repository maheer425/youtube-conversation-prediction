I'll tell you, most of \nthe path breaking research with leads ultimately to development of drugs is \ndone by public money, in public funded Research institutes. Scientists in \nUniversities or research institutes who are funded with public money \ndiscover the genes and drug targets involved in diseases. Only after much \nresearch and knowledge has been generated with public money, then the \ncompanies jump into \"discovering\" drugs or treatments, and charge hefty \nsums of money. \n\nEXAMPLE: Take the Example of BRCA gene involved in cancer. Mary Claire King \nworking in a University first discovered that BRCA gene mutations are \ninvolved in Majority of Breast cancers. After this important and original \ndiscovery, funded with public money, The company Myriad, cloned and found \nmany mutations and patented them, making the diagnostic use of BRCA \nmutations in cancer costlier. So, Most of the times the lead is provided by \npublic funded Research which the companies take and develop into \ntherapeutics or diagnostics. They have no ethical rights to charge \ninsanely. \n\nRMEMBER: The driving force behind all therapeutic research and discoveries \nis the public funded BASIC research, the fruits of which companies reap. \ufeff",

So getting patents, or at least a \nprovisional patent, allows small businesses free space to develop and \ncompete with the big dogs.  \n\nOn the other hand though, there's patent trolls, who simply patent things \nwithout ever making anything.  They do this to either block out \ncompetition, sue companies for infringement, or sell them.  This makes the \npatent itself the business and not the product.  \n\nAs with everything, there's reasons why it exists and ways people can \nexploit it.  My hero, Tesla, never patented any of his great inventions \nbecause he wanted the whole world to benefit.  That's the way it should be, \nbut with the money system in place most people don't have that luxury. ",

The real \ninventors (i.e. the researchers) are perhaps getting a fraction of the pay \nof the what the CEO and the stockholders are getting. The real inventors \ncan do their work in a university financed by public money and then the \ndrug could be delivered at cost I think. removes the middlemen like this \nCEO and the stockholders.\nI read somewhere that only the diseases common in developed parts of the \nworld are being researched by pharmas for treatment. guess why. \n\nIt's not really free market when say you suffer a heart attack and need \nimmediate attention. can't shop around. works while buying computers or \nbooks etc. but not in this case.\nAlso, patent protection is a regulation which doesn't exactly follow the \nfree market principles.\nSay a company dumps all it's harmful stuff untreated into a river which \nwould be possible in an unregulated environment and most people except that \nliving in the vicinity of the river wouldn't even feel the effects for a \nwhile. You will still buy their product, but the social cost (ie destroying \nthe environment) doesn't get passed onto the company. \nAlso, FM can't make sure that cars are following proper emission and safety \nstandards? \n\nThese are some of the flaws that made me reexamine my belief in free \nmarkets.

The only thing rather \n\"new\" about it is the fact that it can be prosecuted by law, which is a \ncultural accomplishment. It allowed people to take huge financial risks \n(opportunities) without fearing the consequence of being thrown under the \nbus by their copycat competition or even worse their peers. I would like to \nknow how it is stealing under the current system. Do people have to \ninvoluntarily give their resources and property away other than by paying \ntaxes? Because I pretty much thought of that as the sheer definition of \n\"stealing\". One could debate how our banking system might include elements \nof stealing but remember we're talking about pharmaceutical companies here.\n\nI used to have a similar stance on intellectual property until I actually \ngot to know \"small\" musicians and producers who literally get eaten up by \nthe big record companies because their intellectual property is stolen by \nan internet generation that somehow feels entitled to get everything for \nfree and therefore destroys their source of income. You could argue that it \nmight be the fault of greedy big record companies but reality is (and \nthat's what those \"small\" musicians say) they don't have the least chance \nof competing against the big fish when their intellectual property is \nnotoriously stolen and the market is being reduced to an oligopoly. And \nguess who can afford the better lawyers?\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you simply did away with patents? If \nanybody survived, it would be the big companies you seem to dislike so \nmuch. Adding insult to injury you would reward theft of intellectual \nproperty as companies who haven't spent a dime on research are able to sell \nthe product to a much lower price - potentially eradicating the actually \nresearch-intensive players on the market and killing any incentive for \nundertaking the risk of innovation again.\n\nHow exactly did universities sell their ideas without labelling it as \n\"intellectual property\" I wonder? To me that notion seems really \ncontradictory. If it weren't property, what would there be to sell? And how \nwould that be any different from patents?",

The concept of \"stealing ideas\" in itself is a \nrelatively new invention and it's completely artificial.\n\nUniversities (and people in general) were making money with their ideas \nlong before they could patent them. People were inventing stuff even before \nthey had this \"incentive\" you talk about. When anyone could \"steal\" their \nidea and freely improve upon it.\n\nAnd notice, that I'm not for removing this incentive altogether, just \nreducing it to a workable size. Decades-long patent protections are \nridiculous. They are stifling innovation and artificially inflate prices.\n\nMy \"two year estimate\" isn't designed to balance out current development \nprograms. Current development programs are not covered by future profits, \nbut by current profits. These companies develop new things with the money \nthey have, not with the money they hope to have. They do not operate at a \nloss and would not operate at a loss, even if cut the patent protection to \ntwo months. They would simply have to re-adjust to a new variable and \nre-evaluate their policies, but they would suffer no immediate loss.\n\nI think a two-year protection is more than fair. It's long enough to \nestablish your market position and build an advantage in any field, and yet \nit allows others to start improving the idea relatively quickly.

I don't say I wholeheartedly support the system but I \nunderstand why your criticism is pointless utopia.\n\nFirst off, yes competition drives innovation, but how would there be \ncompetition without any incentive. What is the incentive of any corporation \nor of any person for that matter to invest tons of money and resources in \nthe development of a pharmaceutical drug if somebody could just sneak \naround the corner and steal the idea, only to sell it for a ridiculous \nprice. That is NOT what drives innovation, it is stealing. I invested \nresources and someone else (who has not invested and taken the risk) gets \nthe price - simple as that.\n\nYou're claiming you don't have an incentive to develop a new product when \nanother company sits on the patent, but I bet you don't have the least \nevidence to support that hypothesis. If you think logically, why would the \nincentive of another company to develop a competitive product just vanish? \nWhen Pfizer had the patent for viagra, Bayer invented levitra - they didn't \njust lean back and stop innovating - quite the contrary. It gave them the \nconfidence to develop a competitive product entirely on their own without \nstealing any intellectual property.\n\nI agree that the idea of having a high profit margin in the years holding \nthe patent might sound inhuman and I can understand that some people will \neven consider it \"murder\". But you can't just fully replace rational \nthinking with irrational emotions and claim a monopoly on morality. That's \nwhy I call it utopia. I know that many times companies would \"buy out\" \nuniversities and single researchers and I do not support that. But you're \nalternative is to throw out the baby with the bathwater. According to your \nidea, you would also cut universites from earning any money selling their \nideas and therefore cutting their major source of income.

Someone came up with a good idea, started to sell a \nproduct, made some money on it, established a brand. Then other people \ntried to make a similar product, improve it, make it better, make it \ncheaper, make it more accessible. And it was all good for everyone.\n\nNow, if you as a pharmaceutical company are allowed to sit on a patent, you \ndon't really have a strong motivation to develop a better cure. Why would \nyou? You are the only one with the product, and you are allowed to rip off \nthose who are dying. Nobody else is allowed to help them and they have the \nstrongest motivation to pay whatever outlandish amount of money you demand. \nThey will sell their cars, their houses, anything for a chance to \nsurvive. THIS is stealing. Actually it's worse.

Kleptocracy is already \nhere and our current patent system is a huge part of it, building a wall \nbetween the rich and the regular people.\n\nBy the way, some of the patents are bought from the regular people, bought \nfrom universities and from those who actually developed them. And quite \noften they are bought on the cheap. It also sometimes happens that big \ncompanies force people to give up their rights and don't give a fuck about \nactual inventors.

We developed this product \nfor Western patients who can afford this product, quite honestly. It is an \nexpensive product, being an oncology product.\u201d\nfrom \nhttp://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-21/merck-to-bristol-myers-face-more-threats-on-india-drug-patents#p2\n\nSo apparently it was a statement to calm shareholders that Bayer would \nstill make profits in spite of the losses on the Indian market due to \ncompulsory licenses.\nThe real question, however, is what price we (as humanity) affix to \nintellectual property and innovation.   It's a drug that has been developed \nat a cost to the company and to the countries in which that company does \nresearch (presumably Germany for Bayer) and now India comes along and is \nessentially taking away the compensation for that development (which is not \nto say that the price Bayer put on the drug is a fair compensation).\n\n There are other companies (see the businessweek link above) like Merck \netc. that have e.g. HIV drugs, which may be looking at the same situation.  \nAs far as I understand it, the Indian authorities can only award a \ncompulsory license to an alternative manufacturer if the medicine is \npatented in India.  So it might backfire in such a way that companies will \nno longer patent (and manufacture and sell) certain highly priced \nmedication in India.  On the other hand it may also lead to companies \nreconsidering their pricing policies.  But let's face it:  drug development \nand synthesis are darn expensive.\n\n+The Young Turks  It would not hurt much to have a bit more balanced a \nperspective on the subject matter and elucidate the conflicts at work here, \nbut it's not all black and white.\ufeff",

You can disagree or agree that's up to you.\n\nBayer was acting stupid. They accepted that they do not have a market here \nin my country. They did not manufacture the drug at a fairly reasonable \nprice when they were asked to do so, even after the ruling was given \ndespite the fact that the government was willing to provide subsides for \nthe poor in case the drug was too expensive. By too expensive India meant \none or two thousand dollars a year which is by itself expensive for a \ncountry like ours which has a GDP per capita of $1500. Bayer was too \narrogant and reported that India would have to pay the full amount. \n\nWhich Government in the world would pay $69000 dollars a year for each \ncancer patient when a local pharma company can manufacture it at 170 \ndollars.Capitalism might be a fine idea for someone who needs money money \nand just money. India however follows socialistic capitalism wherein Human \nRights cannot be overruled by the plagues of Capitalistic behaviour. \nCapitalism is inherently bad if no one guides it. Look at what happened in \nthe USA in terms of Net Neutrality, Civil Forfeiture and the greatest \nhindrance to democracy : Open bribes through Fund Raising and Lobbying. \n\nMy country is inherently poor, I may be sitting here talking to you guys \nabout this stuff but I cant afford that drug though I am a part of the \nUpper middle class in my country. If I cant afford the drug think about the \ninnocents who earn 2 to 3 dollars a day.I think the world must adopt a \npolicy on life threatening situations such as this. India provides its poor \nwith medicines that too are still subsidized to less than the 170 dollar \ncost. The West must adopt this kind of a policy too. Think of the families \nin USA who cant afford this drug either because of Healthcare plans or \nbecause of inherent money problems.\n\n\nFor people criticising our spending on defence and the Space \nProgram.Poverty cannot be abolished by giving away money.People have to \nslowly use opportunities to grow out of Poverty. A government's job is to \ngive opportunities to people not direct cash making them dependent on the \ntax paying society that will ultimately result in a government collapse. \nIndia does spend money on defence about 40 billion dollars a year. What is \nIndia supposed to do when we are cornered by Pakistan and China on two \nsides. The power of Nuclear Deterrence and Brute Strength is the only thing \nstopping Pakistan to war with us.Despite their economy being a tenth of \nIndia's they still grow their nuclear arsenal with no indications of \nsigning the NPT or adopting the no first use policy. There you have my \nreason for defence. \n\nIn the case of Space Research, India reaching Mars was a business move. \nIndia can launch satellites at a much cheaper price than Elon Musk or the \nEuropean Space Agency. But no one believed in India for this. Reaching Mars \nis to bring people to believe that my country can do things properly. And \nIndia does not spend much in space our Space Program is about 1 billion \ndollars which includes the cost of military launches etc. The Mars Program \nfor example only costed 75 million dollars whereas the Nasa Maven cost 675 \nmillion and the Program was in fact developed to show international \ncustomers that India can do things effectively and at the same time reduce \ncosts. India does have a clue on what it is doing and we believe what was \ndone was right. ",

Now maybe you say you will lower the prices in 10 years, but by \nthen most people will either have starved to death, or they have survived \nby deciding to break the law that says you are the only one allowed to \nproduce food.\n\nThere, that comparison fits the facts of this case much better, I even used \ncomparable numbers. Do those business practices still sound good? I think \nthey sound terrible, not just on morally, but also economically. And if you \ntry to defend your prices by saying that you have to take this much money \njust because building your factory was very expensive and you need to earn \nthat money back you should really check the numbers again... seriously.\n\nNow, I'm not sure how rich you are yourself, but what if you needed a \ntreatment that you can't afford to survive? Even if you do make a lot of \nmoney, lets just say that the treatment you need costs more than your total \nyearly income, even though mass producing it is very cheap. Would you still \nthink that some companies intellectual property is more important than your \nlife? Would you die to defend their right to be horrible people?\n\nAnd please don't keep repeating the argument that they need to make a \nprofit to make up for the cost of development, if this was the best way, \nwhy don't all medication have the same price tag as a new car for 1 small \nbottle of pills?\n\nIf there is a reason for this other than \"they are idiots and horrible \npeople\", it's probably that they are in bed with insurance companies and \nare trying to drive up insurance prices.",

Whereas, a poor person in dveloped \nnations would be feeling embarrassed over being poor, surrounded by rich \nbrats! Pity!",

How's this. Instead of \ncomplaining they're having their property stolen... instead of worrying \nabout middle class share holders and execs insane bonuses, they seek to be \nremembered for curing Cancer, or Malaria... how about people look up Jonas \nSalk to see how it's done. If they are not willing to follow the \ntraditional esteemed tenets of Alturism implied for centuries in the \nmedical profession, fuck them. Force them. Anyone who says 'They'll just \nstop research' let me paint you this picture... lets put the proverbial \nhorses head in their collective beds... 'Listen, since we're a Fed. Govt.. \nof a Sovereign state, and you're in our masters, AKA the people's... \nhouse.. what you're going to do, is be free to make all the money you want \noff medication for non-fatal conditions, but the ones you make for cancer, \nmalaria, AIDS and the like... you sell at a loss, or we nationalize you, \nseize your research and make it a state priority to disseminate your \nmedication globally at a reduced price, now you can move over seas, but you \nwont make the cash you are allowed in Western capitalist democracies on all \nyour other medications, chose\".... anyone who doesn't think that's fair, go \nlive in the free and unregulated Utopia's of Somalia or South Sudan.\ufeff",
