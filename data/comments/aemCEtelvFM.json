While \nhardworking middle class parents are working all day, their children are \nbombarded with indoctrination programs to try to convert them to \nhomosexuality.  Books like Tango and Foundations coming from ultra liberal \ncities seek to spread the social disease called Homosexualtiy.  Within ten \nyears homosexuality will likley be cured by biotechnology and people \nchoosing to not be gay.  Homosexuals take advantage of anyone who is \ngoodhearted.  If you choose to do homosexual acts, you are not a Christian, \n Science and God are both against you\ufeff",

                "text": "The fascination of big butts really started with Saartjie \"Sarah\" Baartman \nin the 1800s. She was taken from her home in South Africa and sold into \nslavery in her 20's, however, she was extremely voluptuous- large breast, \nbutt, thighs, lips- the image that people try to attain now. People had \nnever seen anything like her (aka: a black woman's naked body). She was put \non display in a circus, for her \"exotic\" look in London, Ireland and then \nto France. She was stripped naked, dancing for people's entertainment so \nthey can see, touch and laugh at the \"oddly\" proportioned woman who they \nalso nicknamed \"Hottentot Venus\". Even after she died at just 25 years old, \nFrance kept her skeleton, preserved genitals & brain and a plaster of her \nactual body on display until 1974!!! That is almost 160 years!!! Sarah \nbecame an object to fulfill people curiosity and crazy fetishes (i.e. rape \nand whatever else they did to her). Now people go through surgery to get \nwhat she was born with. It is sad how much people are fascinated with it. \nIt's even more sad to think that this \"big booty movement\" started with \nBeyonce, J-Lo, Kimmy K., or Nicki! I bet if many people knew some history, \nthey wouldn't be as obsessive over it but more sympathetic towards Sarah \nand see how sickening it actually is... \ufeff",
