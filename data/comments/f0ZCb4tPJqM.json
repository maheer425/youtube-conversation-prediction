Like if you wanted to \nbe a Marine Biologist then in Science you would only learn about Marine \nlife and Social Studies/History you could learn the origin of Marine life, \nLanguage Arts you could read about marine life and learn how to say their \nnames in other languages and etc, in Gym/PE you could go to an aquarium and \nhelp out with the animals and stuff like swimming and help training the \ndolphins and such. In math you could learn lengths and stuff, but you do \nneed to learn at least basic stuff in math like addition and subtraction, \nand stuff like that...which also goes for Language Arts. Then you could \nhave 1-2 days every other week where you learn other things other than what \nyou're focused on and studying. In my opinion, a lot more kids would want \nto go to school because you could learn what you're interested in and have \nfun while doing it. Another thing about School being a bore is Dress Code \npolicies, kids should be able to express themselves through their clothing \nstyle. Sure, some kids do dress and others don't approve but let them be \nit's how they want to dress, it's not your wardrobe or your body. There is \n'bullying' but that is just life itself, everyone makes fun of one and \nanother no matter who they are whether you're a kid or an adult. If someone \nis making fun of you, just ignore it and be you, excuse the language but \nfuck what other people think. Do what you want, wear want you want and the \nrest can fuck off and there are some people that hang around your style. I \nknow it can be hard to ignore people, especially people with depression and \netc have trouble but you need to look on the bright side and if someone is \njudging you then fuck them, you're your own person and you can do what you \nwant. :)",

But the problem is this: most cafeteria \nfood is the products of major food corporations. 80% of the money in the \nschool lunch program never even makes it into the cafeteria. Why? Because \nmost of it goes to the food corporations. Bush made it seem like he was \nextending school lunch programs and helping hungry children when in reality \nhe was just scratching the backs of big business. Not only do they get a \nload of subsidies but they get to have poor children eat their food and get \nhooked to the salts and sugars they process and use without even know it's \nfrom the same companies who make McDonald's, coca cola and much more. \nHealthy food can be delicious and filling. But it won't happen until \nCongress stops kissing ass to the super wealthy. Obama is simply trying to \nwork with the crap she has.",

                    "text": "+Peanut Butter then I'd apologise and say that I didn't mean to hurt you :)\nLet me tell you one thing: in 'liking a sex' and 'having sex with' the word \nsex has a completely different meaning. In 'liking a sex', sex (sex; noun) \nmeans 'man' or 'woman' and in 'having sex with', sex (having sex with; \nverb) means 'doing the do', 'fuck', 'doing the thing' or whatever you want \nto call it. Please don't confuse those two, because that will cause awkward \nsituations haha.\nAnd you said \"i think my dog is cute doesn't mean ill have sex with it\" and \nthat's more than logical, but do you think that, for example, boys who like \nboys think \"hey, that boy is cute, let's have sex with him\"? Because they \ndon't, just as you don't think \"that person is really attractive, I'm gonna \nhave sex\". The way you said that sentence I quoted, it sounds like you're \nimplying that homosexual people think that, while heterosexual people \ndon't. But it could also be that you just confused the two meanings of the \nword \"sex\" and then I'll take everything back.\nAnd one more thing: love is a feeling and you can't pick feelings. \nConclusion: you can't pick what sex you like.\nBut if you're not going to change your opinion, then that's okay. You do \nyou. Just try not to harm other people with your believes though. You \nwouldn't like it either when homosexual people told you that you were wrong \nand disgusting and that you should just leave. And before you say \"but \nthat's not true, I'm normal, they aren't\", that's the same thing they would \nsay about you. Try to see things from another person's perspective, it \nmakes life easier for the both of you :)",
