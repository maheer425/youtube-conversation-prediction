These government tyrants might as well be trying to \npersuade you that oxygen is not currently being fairly distributed, and \nthat only they can ensure the fair distribution of air.  And people are \nfalling for this?!  See the PJ Media Trifecta video \"Obama Care for the \nInternet:  Can Net Neutrality Cut Your Cable Bill.\"\ufeff",

The only groups that vote in those size blocks tend to be \nuninformed or uneducated.  There is a very good reason for this. People who \nare well educated and intelligent disagree by nature. They look at all \nsides. uneducated people tend to vote or think with emotion or based on \nstuff they believe not facts. In fact there was a study done at University \nof Michigan that shows when people were presented with fact against their \npolitical position. They became strong in their political position.  So if \nyou think we have more control of the federal government get more informed. \nSecond the FCC is the one that will be the gate keeper. No one votes for \nthem.",
