I completely agree that cats are not cruel \nbecause they eat meat, I only use a vegan diet because of the evident \nhealth benefits I have observed in them when the diet is changed. It is \nfairly recent that it has been discovered that cats can gain all their \nnutritional needs from plants, so many people still hold the views that you \ndo. If you want to know where all the different nutrients come from, take a \nlook at the reference page linked in the article. Regards :-)",

They will get \nsick. Dogs can be put on vegan diets if you're very careful, but they are, \nlike cats, naturally carnivorous. They *should* be fed with something \ncontaining meat protein/fats and the like.\n\nNow, secondly, *stop trying to enforce your morality upon animals*. They \nare not moral actors and thus are not being cruel when consuming meat. For \nhumans you could make the case that veganism is morally superior, but for \ncarnivorous animals you're simply deluding yourself.

Some grains can be beneficial for a dog's gut \nmotility and preventing obesity, so dont worry if the next ingredient down \nis corn or rice (but some dogs are wheat intolerant). When looking at the \nnutritional composition, for an adult dog you want a diet as close to 25% \nprotein as possible (try not to go higher than 30%, as it can have a \nnegative effect on the kidneys), and around 5% fat.

I \nrecently discovered you can buy Fennec Foxes as pets and I'm not sure its \nethically sound to do so. Traditional domesticated animals, such as cats \nand dogs, are generally acceptable pets but if its okay to own a dog/cat is \nit then okay to own a animal such as a fox (assuming they are bred for sale \nas a pet, wild animals should NEVER be pets imo)? Just curious on your \nmoral outlook on the subject. :)\ufeff",

I should've put that assuming you can \nprovide for an animals needs 100%, is it still ethical?\n\n+libbylobs1234 - I know some animals are far easier to provide for than \nothers but just because they are easy to care for doesn't mean it is moral \nto keep them as pets. I think all animals would make great pets in the \nsense of the enjoyment humans would get out of them, but I'm not sure if it \nis right to keep any animals as pets. Even though it is accepted in society \nto keep pets.\n\n+Sammi Palmer You amke a really good point when you talk about animals that \nenjoy the company of humans, I didn't consider that! I just thought about \nwild animals that make the decision to get close to humans! But I wonder is \nthis because we have encroached on their habitats, would they choose our \ncompany over the company of their own species or the wild? A bit off topic \nI know.\n\nI don't think it is ever ethical or moral to have an animal as a pet if you \ncannot provide for it fully. That means meeting all of its needs, like the \nones you noted in your Fennec Fox example! I'm not sure that, even if you \ncan do so, that it is still ethical to buy animals that are bred as pets. \nObviously rescue animals are a whole different case (if they can't be \nreturned to the wild for whatever reason).\n\nI guess my question is - Is it moral to keep an animal as a pet, assuming \nyou can provide for all its needs, that has been bred for the purpose to be \na pet? Especially non-traditional/exotic pets.\n\nGuess I'm a bit of an ethics/morality nerd haha!",

In my opinion, \nanimals that make good pets are those that enjoy the company of humans; \ndogs, cats, rabbits, rodents, even some reptiles all show behavioural signs \nof enjoying human companionship, and I'm sure some wild individuals may do \nthe same, but not all. Its also important to consider whether all the \naspects of an animals welfare can be met in a 'pet' environment; providing \nthe correct diet, exercise, freedom to express natural behaviours and \npreventing illness, disease or distress by proper care (including finding a \nspecialist vet for the animal). For example a Fennec Fox would need \nadequate heat, a carcass-based diet, companions of its own kind, space for \ndigging etc. which they wont get in most households.",
