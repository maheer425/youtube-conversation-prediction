It's mostly due to the narrow-minded and ignorant citizens who are \nblindly criticizing him, like yourself for example. Overpatriotism is \nunhealthy. Get this through that thick skull of yours. I'm definitely not \nfrom a liberal, left-winged or democratic nation like the USA so I KNOW \nfirst-hand about how it feels and what it's like to live in a country \nsimilar to your country had it been somebody else other than Obama who was \nthe President. Don't shift all the blame on the President. If you really \nknow how politics work, you would've already known that Congress has more \npower/say compared to the President himself. But unfortunately you don't. \nIt's one person against many people, and he can't help it if he gets \noutnumbered and the majority wins. There's only so much one can do. So do \nthe world a favor and educate yourself on how the government system works \nbefore accusing anybody. Lastly, seeing as how the whole bunch of you hate \nhis stance in politics over therr, I'd be glad if you could send him here \nto be the President instead \ud83d\ude04 not everyone is ungrateful like you are.",

And let's not forget the millions who lost insurance coverage \nbecause of Obamacare..\n\nHealthcare is NOT a right, and it's not a privilege either.  It's \na RESPONSIBILITY to yourself and your family.  You can't expect to buy \ninsurance coverage AFTER something bad happens...the whole concept of \ninsurance is to buy it ahead of time incase something bad happens in the \nfuture.  Try telling an insurance provider you want full-coverage on your \ncar after you get into a wreck and total it.  See what their response \nis.  Health insurance works on the same premise..  So why should I have to \npay a much higher premium because of the irresponsible people who didn't \nplan for the future?  They can still get treatment even if they have no \nhealth insurance.  Emergency rooms are required by law to provide \nhealthcare to people.  They will be in massive debt, but that's the risk \nyou take when you don't plan for the future. \n\nThe problem is liberals just don't understand business or economics, and \nthey are the primary reason our country is $17 trillion in debt.  Thanks to \nthem, America won't be the greatest country in the world for much longer. \n By 2020, the interest alone on our debt will be America's largest \nexpense...more than defense, medicare, education, etc..  At some point, you \njust have to say 'enough is enough'...we are living in the real world, not \nfantasy land.",

Obama is not a U.S. citizen and has taken \nmore vacations then any other president in history, never had a job, never \nran his own business, has no grade records of any school he has ever \nattended. Obama's real name is barry sortoren, he was born in Kenya and has \na brother and father who live there now and are criminals. Obama's step \nfathers name is Obama and he smuggled little Barry into the USA and gave \nhim his new name Obama when he married his mother. As for Corporations my \ndumb friend they are the companies who keep people employed and their \nemployees pay taxes for all the non working freeloaders and social programs \nlike obamafraud. Minimum wage jobs are for students, part time workers and \nteenagers on summer break, these types of jobs are not intended to be a \ncareer or to raise a family on. That's why you get an education and move up \nto higher professional jobs. If corporations paid 30 dollars an hour they \nwould never be able to compete with the other countries like china, why do \nyou think america is flooded with products from other countries, because we \ndon't make anything in the US anymore because it's too expensive to pay all \nthese spoiled american brats to make it. The unions pay big bucks and \nnothing ever gets done and half the union workers are on early pension \ndisability because they hurt their finger, that's why america can't compete \nin the world markets.",

But, making it easier does \nnot make one's criticism wrong or unworthy. Criticisms should be considered \nto see if there are any valid points made by those who oppose what we \nsupport or are against. In democracies we deserve the government and \nelected officials we get. I do not support President Obama's direction he \nwants to take the United States. This is the most \"leftist\" President \nelected to office. In President Kennedy's inaugural address he said, \"Ask \nnot what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your \ncountry.\" The current direction of the Democratic party has become, \"Ask \nnot what you can do for your county, ask what your country can do for you.\" \nThis President and the Democratic party seems to believe the bigger the \ngovernment, the better off the citizen. I believe the larger the government \nthe smaller the citizen. This country has amassed a $16 trillion national \ndebt. Eventually we run out of other people's money. This is the slowest \nrecovery from a recession the US has ever had since the Great Depression \nof  the 30's with modest growth of 2% or less after spending $1 trillion \n(The American Reoovery and Reinvestment Act of 209) that the President and \nthe Democratic congressional leadership asserted that it will bring us out \nof the recent recession.",
