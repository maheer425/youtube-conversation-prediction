Underwater footage uses a Canon G15 in a \nFantaSea dive case.  We're pretty amatuer and really can't afford much gear \nso just use the built in camera mic.  We use Adobe Premiere and our laptops \non board for \nthe editing.  I'm happy to say everything is charged\\powered 100% with \nsolar power as well.  Life on a boat is good!Good luck with that massive \nLagoon!  Would be a hell of a cruising boat :)Cheers to you and thanks \nagain for watching!BrianS\\V Delos",
