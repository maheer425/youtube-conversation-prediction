I have two VCR's from the 80's \nVHS and Betamax, my TV from around 1990, but I am getting the very first \nDVD player from 1997 so I will connect it to my VCR's. oh and yes I also \nstill use Floppy disks to transfter data from my 2006 daily laptop over to \nmy vintage computers plus I have keept all my dad's old Floppy disks he \nused in the 90's when I was growing up. I also still keept his old modem he \nused before 1999 my dad got Broadband in 1999 he was part of the 2% or 3% \nwho had it in 1999. but I used to use cassette tapes but I moved away from \nthem years ago as I prefer Minidisc that is even more 90's than cassettes. \nI also own a 1997 Digital Camera by Sony it store the pictures on floppy \ndisk other reason why I still use Floppy disks. you said you where born in \n1999 right? well then I will 8 year old back then but sure early to mid \n2000's still had alot of 90's stuff in them it was so easy to find back \nthen so I would call you a early 2000's kid.

At this time, \n$3 was about a day's wages for most workers.\n\nBut even so he claims he preferred the phone system he had as a kid. He \nwould pick up the phone to call his mother, and if he didn't know where she \nwas the operator did, and would connect the call accordingly. (He grew up \nin a small town.)

If that is the case, it \nwould not be surprising that these kids would never experience a busy \nsignal.  This would be more likely in the \"high-tech\" Silicon Valley of \nCalifornia, but for the rest of America, where older phones and phone \nsystems are still used, most of us still deal with busy signals, even with \ncell phones and I-Phones.

Rather than considering it a reflection of parents \n\"spoiling\" their kids...realize it is just a reflection of society \nprogressing. Technology is a great thing, as long as these kids are getting \nsome physical activity in, there is no severe harm in giving them access to \nthese items.

When they learn that those things cost money, and it is hard for \nthem to get those expensive things, they maybe learn or chose to live in \nother ways. They are kids, of course most of them prefer the things they \nknow, or the most fun or the most expensive. I just think your words were a \nlittle over the line for a bunch of kids. Yeah, they might be stupid \nbecause it is really simple using old stuff, but again, they are kids. I \nlearn to play LP's on my grandma's stereo until I was 10. And she and my \nmother tell the same things; \"Why do you need a cell phone? Back in my \ntime, no one had those, and we survivied!\" \"Why do you need an xbox?\" LCD \nTV's, Tablets. Printers. Those things were created to make our life easier. \nI bet you at least had a laptop now. Or something with internet connection \nto post in this video. Maybe you didn't had those things when you were \nlittle, me neither, that's why we'd chose or wouldn't care using old \ntechnology. But this kids do have this things, and of course they prefer \nthem. Maybe that's a new concept of evolution, I don't see this as \n\"nauseous\"; I think it's funny how things change and how kids live \nnowadays. I had my firs mobile til I was 15, and it wasn't even color \ndisplay...\nSorry for that long answer, and if you choose to read it, thanks.",
