The argument that all this work can be \ndone by off-the-street part time minimum wagers doesn't hold water. That \nworks for much of it but that behavior isn't what this is about - there are \ninstances where they want a specific worker there for more than 40 hours in \na week, and locking them into a salary is the cheapest avenue to do that \nbecause they can wave a title and 25k gross salary in front of a part time \nworker making 12k gross a year and it seems like an offer that cannot be \nrefused, until they realize that in exchange for taking on greater \nresponsibilities they've really taken a pay *cut* vs. what they'd be making \nat their old hourly rate with the new longer hours.  So yes, in these cases \nit would actually be more expensive for the company to pay straight time to \npeople vs. the set up that is being busted - Which is why several people \nhave pointed out that your dystopian conclusion is actually pretty positive \nbecause if they did bring in more workers instead not only is a person not \nbeing screwed out of pay for hours worked, but unemployment would drop  - \nbut the fact that isn't the cheapest route is what prevents it from \nhappening now.",

Companies that dont pay there employees well \nwould always be losing employees to their competitors. They will \ncontinually have to hire and train new staff with fewer experienced ppl \navailable to do the training. Eventually they would have to raise their pay \nand use other strategies to retain workers, like paying them for overtime.\n\nThe market will decide what these employees are worth. Just like anyone who \nis making above minimum wage right now. The market decided what you were \nworth...not the government. Shouldn't that be applied across the board?\ufeff",

If you sell apples, but there are too many \napple sellers and not enough apple buyers, then the cost of your apples has \nto go down. you need to make tough decisions, endure some hardships and do \nwhatever you need to to keep your apple farm afloat. it's sad, but thats \nhow the free market works. there is now an incentive for you to work \nharder, to be smarter, diversify your product listing, do something to get \ninto a market that is less crowded. The free market \"incentivises\" hard \nwork. The government does not go out and say \"everyone making over $50,000 \na year has to buy $100 in apples a month\". \n\nIn this story, the workers are apple sellers. there are just too many of \nthem. by free market principles they need to find a way to offer something \nmore and that will result in them not having to get the government to tell \nthe companies who pay them (apple buyers) how much to pay. the payers will \nobserve the quality in their product and offer higher wages based on that.\n\nIf the government really wants to help, they should tax these companies \nmore and invest in schools and community programs that will give these ppl \nmore opportunities to learn skills that companies want and are willing to \npay for....that is of course if you believe in a free market system",

The time addressing \nsuch talking points is \"wasted\", as you say, but largely because so many \n\"others\", collectively, are publishing them as a means of discussion. \n\nDepending on a given news organization, the decision to not spread or not \naddress Fox News talking points may or may not have an impact on spreading \nit.  Each situation with each organization must be examined individually, \nbased on the specifics of their situation. \n\nFor example, if MSNBC decided to ignore all Fox News talking points, that \nmight have a noticeable impact that Fox News would react to.  Thus, it is \nnot just about the exclusively MSNBC audience or even the MSNBC audience \nthat might also watch Fox News, but rather, it is also about the Fox News \norganization itself, and the Great Discussion at-large. \nNow, if a blatantly and unabashed progressive news organization decides to \nignore Fox News talking points, that audience will still remain unaffected \nby the Fox News talking points, and Fox News would hardly notice or care, \neven if this unabashed news organization is very large. \nDepending on your interpretation, this might be a mildly positive or a \nmildly negative benefit for this non-Fox audience.  If you believe that \nthis non-Fox audience is negatively susceptible to the Fox News talking \npoints, then omitting them would be somewhat positive, but only mildly so \nas compared with a typical TV-news watcher.  On the other hand, this \nnon-Fox audience might be largely immune to the deceptive populist wiles of \nFox News, and thus they could only gain a benefit from a rebuttal analysis \nof the talking points, or at least bear neither benefit nor detriment from \nit. \n\nBut, otherwise, you are mostly right in that, at least, Fox News is \nbecoming decreasingly relevant these days...\nAlso, sometimes I just find them to be hilarious.  :-p",

Often enough, they may make the workers they don't lay off, \nor cut the hours of, just simply work harder and pick up the slack.  This \nis a very simply concept, I feel like the old canard about liberals never \nactually having a real job is true here.  Have you ever actually been in \nthe work place in such a situation?",

Mind you the government is supposed to be \nthe responsible and trustworthy part of this equation. Has there ever been \nany such expectation for corporations beyond what they can get away with \nfor their own gain? Would the corporations be spending the money to send \nthe lobbyists if wasn't working, and the politicians weren't accepting \ntheir bribes and perks? The answer to both of those questions is no.\n\nA simple example for the nature of the relationship between government and \nbusiness is like the relationship between a babysitter and a toddler. The \nbabysitter (government) is supposed to be the more mature, responsible \nperson that makes sure the kid stays out of trouble, in fact the babysitter \nis paid to do so. The toddler (business) is obviously the irresponsible one \nin this relationship, and is pretty much always going to act in his self \ninterest, doing whatever he is able to get away with. Now if the toddler \ndoes something really bad, like escape out of the front door and walk \naround the neighborhood for half an hour, are you as the parent going to \nblame the toddler more or the babysitter more? Would you harp on how ninja \nsneaky and ingenious the bad bad toddler was for escaping, or would you be \nfurious with the incompetent babysitter who obviously was not doing her \njob, or worse, personally let the child out to wander alone?",

I agree that it would \nbenefit people and society as a whole to be more self sufficient. What I am \ntrying to get across to you is that a corporation can not force you to buy \ntheir product. You do not \"have\" to buy them from a corporation.\n\nThe only way that we can be forced to buy a product is through the \ngovernment. That is where you should be looking to direct your ire if you \nare concerned that people don't have the ability to make anything of their \nown. Not corporations, only the government can dictate your ability to grow \nor raise your own food, harvest your own materials, operate your own \nmachinery, create your own products, etc. There aren't any corporations \nthat can prevent you from doing any of these things, except through the \nauspices of government. The government is paid by us to be the watchdog, \nthe ones that protect our freedoms, and yet as you claim they are in bed \nwith the corporations. Who is more to blame in that relationship between \nthe corporation and the government? The entity who's job it is to \nspecifically protect us, or the entity who's job it is to make money? \n     \nI don't understand when people are shocked that corporations will spend \nmoney any way they can get away with in order to make more money, that is \ntheir job. What confounds me more though is that people don't place blame \non the government who's responsible for regulating the corporations, and is \nthe only entity that can allow corporations to get away with whatever shady \nnonsense. Like I said previously, it is like blaming a toddler for getting \nout of the house and not saying anything about the responsibilities of the \nbabysitter you were paying to watch him.\n\nEither way, to sum it up, corporations require voluntary cooperation and \ncan't prevent you from making any of your own stuff that you want, \ngovernments can prevent you and do prevent you from doing so, and do not \nrequire your voluntary cooperation, they can just force you.",

But neither the \nlaid-off workers nor the physical factory go anywhere.  For a time, the \nfactory retains all its original equipment because, typically, it is easier \nto contract out the work to some preexisting factory overseas. \n\nThe equipment that they remove is typically sold off, but as it costs money \nto do this, as well as to properly dispose of unsold equipment, much of it \nstays in the factory and rots away. \nThat is the height of inefficient use of human resources.  You have people, \na means, and a desire, but the system just can't put it all together.  \nThat's the reality of Pareto non-optimal markets. ",

Picking up \na second job isn't that easy (even though I have two, and sometimes three \nmyself).  A reason why your company laid you off is because one, you simply \nweren't that good of a worker, or two due to regulations it was too \nexpensive to keep you.  The company my dad worked at closed, he picked up a \njob that pays $26/hr starting off, he is getting paid more now.  He had a \nlot of experience and they went after him.  This idea of \"worker's rights\" \nand \"redistribution of the wealth\" is what is killing jobs.  It makes it \ntoo hard to hire people.\n\nPlus, as I mentioned before, redistribution of the wealth is impossible.  \nYou have to create wealth.  I showed that with my house example.  61% of an \naverage family's net worth is in their home.  A homeowner has 30 times more \nwealth than a renter. Is it because a homeowner is oppressive to renters?  \nNo, because beyond owning a home people don't have much wealth, but they \ncan still have a nice income.  In order to have wealth redistribution you \nwill have to start giving people Walmarts.  And considering how around 50% \nof small businesses fail within the first 5 years it is safe to say that in \n5 years some Walmarts will do well and others will fail leading to more \nwealth redistribution.  You have to create wealth somewhere, and in order \nfor wealth redistribution to take place the government has to \"trickle \ndown\" that wealth to people who didn't create that wealth, and they have to \ndo it constantly.

Back when workers had rights, we had \na middle class. After we lost our rights, most of the money went right to \nthe top, and the only thing \"trickling down\" are \"golden showers\".

Those concept can be ultimately founded in \nreason. Assume a group of perfect reasonable beings making a contract about \nhow to live in their society \u2013 they do not know what role they are going to \nhave in that society \u2013 those perfect reasonable beings would necessarily \nagree on a perfect social contract \u2013 which content is founded objectively \nin reason and its value defined by those who are concerned \u2013 thus a social \ncontract is not worse founded than most of our knowledge (except maybe \nmathematics or classical logic) \u2026\nOf course it is just a thought experiment and imperfect humans can never \nreach a perfect social contract but it demonstrates that such a contract in \nprincipial can have a sound foundation in reason.\nSo that was very briefly a bit of social contract moral theory. This is \nwhat I meant when I used the word fairness & good \u2013 excuse my sloppy \nlanguage but I did not want to get into a discussion about a moral system.\n\n@ State\n\nI am not in favor of most things the state does! It only helps the richer \nclass \u2013 it bails out banks for billions of dollars it helps the rich to \nsafe taxes \u2026 the only thing it does since decades is attacking the poor ppl \n\u2026 how can you think I would appreciate anything the state does? The state \nis just a puppet of the rich class!\n\nI am just saying I am in principial o.k. IF the state would regulate to \nachieve a better society (as defined above) \u2013 and if an economic system \nleads to children dying in coal mines I am all for intervention even if it \nmeans that some money has to be taken from the richer class \u2013 because there \nis a better way to organize our society for sure \u2026 on the other hand you \nwould even accept dying children to protect the upper class \u2026\n\n\nAnyway: This discussion is already out of every border and I do not want to \nget into deep with all the topics you raised and also I do not want to be \nsloppy again \u2026\n\nLet me just say this \u2013\n\nI think I have demonstrated by simple mathematics that the possession of a \nlarge amount of money (e.g.: 1 billion [$]) more or less automatically \nleads to earning approximately 10 times more money every 50 years (assuming \na real bad internal rate of return) that means after 50 years -> 10 billion \nafter 100 years -> 100 billion after 150 years -> 1000 billion after 200 \nyears ->10.000 billion [$]\n\nIt is a fundamental problem of capitalism \u2013 as the goods and resources \ncannot grow with the same speed this money has to come from somewhere \u2013 \neither banks create it out of nowhere devaluating all the money you possess \n(btw. all the dollars an euros we have are not even worth the paper they \nare printed on anymore) or they take it directly by exploiting their \nemployees or forcing the state to save money on e.g.: education (and \ntherefore accepting the destruction of every society \u2013 because a society \nwith bad education for all their kids is not competitive on the long run) \nor even go to war killing civilians to get oil (!).\n\nUltimately this system therefore collapses approximately every 50 years \neither in a huge war a revolution or the collapse of world economy \u2026\n\nAnd to be honest it is not that there is any disagreement here -literally \neveryone who has a glue of what he is talking agrees to that even just one \nexample as you mentioned him \u2013 rich guys like Warren Buffet \u2026 you can read \nit in every history book and you can ask any economist \u2026\n\nConcerning the minimum vage example \u2013 of course the guy who works over time \nwould earn more money afterwards as well \u2013 because as we agreed overtime \nshould be paid \u2026\nBut anyway don\u2019t focus on specific examples \u2013 let\u2019s say we find out (just \naccept it for the moment \u2013 for the sake of argument), that paying minimum \nwages is beneficial for the entire society (more money in the local economy \nmore kids on college and university \u2013 more engineers and scientists \u2026 etc.) \nlet\u2019s say all of this works out that way \u2013 in that case would you be for it \nor not?\n-> Because if yes than we ultimately have no disagreement\n-> if no than we have an unresolvable disagreement",

One shall not initiate force \nagainst another if you want is stated as a commandment.\n\nSo what do you have with that? rich people can do what they want with their \nmoney.\n\"Poor\" people or starters can work and add to their human capital to be \nmore valuable to the community who may or may not freely chose to use this \nvalue.\n\nSee: Poor people and starters are more competitive because they are willing \nto do more, work harder for less pay to get going. that's also what we \nentrepreneurs do. I've done it many times, failed many times, whined and \ncryed that it's unfair nobody buys my shit etc. Fact is the offer wasn't \nvaluable to enough people to pay me enough money.\n\nComes in your god, the STATE. Let's install MINIMUM WAGE! yeah yells the \ncrowd.\nnow eveyrone working for $5/hr is getting $7/hr. How is that fair to the \none who worked for longer at the job and adde more value to its employer \nand their customer and already made $7/hr? is he getting bumped to 9? Nope.\n\nsee under the guise of fairness you can pass anything. there is always a \ngroup that feels treated unfairly. Min Wage jobs are not meant to be a \ncareer. but the gvt, through its regulations and taxes has left people \nstuck in there.\n\nAnd this to the great appreciation of big corporations who can gobble up \nthese low wagers.\n\nSee I would never dream of forcing you to do anything. work for me, work \nfor someone, or not work. If I have product I would never use force to make \nyou buy or even use it.\n\nBut that is exactly what the state is doing.\n\nAnother thought for you to ponder is this: If you like the state so much \nand it is making every american broke to the tunes of 100s of thousands per \nman, woman and child in the US.

I know most of the time \nit's meant to keep the middle class cranking the hamster wheel but still \npeople do get out fo poverty by ingenuity, networking, savvy money \nmanagement and yes, luck also.\n\n    Of course rich ppl can lend their money to other ppl to support \nprojects - its called\n    investment - the return on investment will make them even richer - let \nalone that\n    they of course own the project if they give the money for it ...\n\nNope. many 'rich' people (especially those who inherited or won the \nlottery) do\nnot make smart investment decision. And nope, most of the time they do not\nown the project, Get on an accredited investors list and see who calls you.\nput 10-20k in every project and see how many are winners and how may bust.\n\n(Actually do not do that, you 'll lose your money, only invest in what you \nknow\nhow to operate).\n\n\n    @ minimum wage\n\n    Sure people are so desperate that they would work for a minimum wage \u2013 \nbut\n    how is this a good thing? It may start with some temporarily workless \nmum doing \n    some housework for someone else \u2013 nobody would object to that \u2013 but it \nwill end\n    with children working in coal mines dying on average at the age of 14 \n(as we had\n    it in England at the end of the 19th century \u2013 were we had unbound \ncapitalism\n    I would say it has to end up bad for everyone individually and bad for \nthe state as\n   well \u2026\n\nIt is a 'good' thing because it's either that or dying. You either get \nsomething\nthat the market is willing to pay you or you get NOTHING. Sorry for the \ninconvenience but childrend dying in a cole mine is no fun and nobody\nwould claim that. At the same time unless you produce your own electric\npower your are giving those children a job. A crappy one yes, but a job.\n\n\n    I would like to take wall mart as an example it has used its power to \nreally exploit\n    their employees \u2013 pays them next to nothing and does not provide any \nhealth\n    insurance.\n\nHow many jobs have you created? how many times over min wage did you pay\nyour employees? do you own a smart phone? guess how much those poor\nbastards working 14hrs a day were paid so you can tweet or chat about \ngetting\nmilk home.\n\n    Also it has used its enormous financial power to get huge state subsidy \nlike for\n    example 1,2 billion in tax breaks, infrastructure assistance, low-cost \nfinancing and\n    free land. (pls note that is not the major point - iam just mentioning \nit additionally -\n    it is primarily about the wages)\n\nThank you for bringing that up. STATE subsidy is the problem. You let the \nstate\nsteal money from you and then give it to wall mart. The very concept of a \nstate implies coersion and is therefore repugnant.\n\nWe agree on that point at least. But it's not wall-mart's fault if there is \na pile of cash sitting there for big corps just for the taking. A Pile you \ncontributed to btw.\n\n    Combined both \u2013 exploitation of the employees and federal support, they \ncan\n   offer their goods so cheap that they beat out any concurrence.\n\n    So what has happened here?\n1.)    All the money goes to a few rich people (using their existing money \nand the power originating from it to command the ppl and the state to their \nwill) and most of it is basically lost for the economy.\n\n    2.)    The small stores who paid a fair wage to their employees had to \nclose\n    and fire them\n\nThat's probably an incorrect assumption. Small store also try and pay as \nlittle as possible, just like you trying to get your phone for as cheap as \npossible. don't you?\n\n    3.)    The people who work in this industry fell from an low income to \nan almost\n    non existing income \u2013 reducing buying power in the neighbor hood and \ntherefore\n    hurting the entire local economy\n\nI agree, but agian, it is not primarily WM ' fault. Stop the corporate hand \nouts,\nwithdraw support for statistm and WM wouldn't be WM. Plus you're still free \nto\npay more for what you buy at WM or give employees a tip if you want. Are you\ndoing this?\n\n    4.)    This people cannot afford an education of their kids anymore \u2013 \nthe nation is\n    losing potential scientists & engineers \u2013 (News: smart kids are not \nonly in rich\n    families \u2013 but only rich kids go to universities even if they are \nincredibly stupid\n    (e.g.: S. Palin, G. Bush, etc. )) \u2013 this is one of the major reasons \nwhy the US is\n    falling behind other nations technology wise rapidly!\n\n    So please tell me how would forcing wall mart to pay their employees \ntheir\n    overtime (which is nothing but fair) respectively pay them a fair wage \nwould not   \n    be of more benefit to everyone?\ufeff\n\nI think we're clear. Employers should pay overtime. now if they get a \ncontract that says an employee will work and not get paid overtime, what's \nstopping this employee\nfrom getting another job?\n\n1) Im sure none of these employees are actually LOOKING for something \nbetter.\n2) none of them are trying to increase their human capital and provide more \nvalue to their employer or someone else who'd pay them more.\n3) if they are looking they probably find only worse jobs than what they \nhave. Now how is that WM's fault if they alraady provide them with the best \ndeal they can get/\n\nAre YOU offering them something better? anything at all?\n\nAnd again, the problem is gvt intervention in business and private affairs \nwhich renders it very expensive to start a new venture or business. often \ntimes (most of the times) large coproration and conglomerate lobby the \ncongress to pass these OSHA laws, or ADA or abomination care. Because with \n10000 employees have one or two attorneys on staff to handle all that is a \nvery inexpensive way to keep the new company out of business which has \nonley 10 employees.\n\nsearch YT for the taxi license thing in Washington DC. I think it's by John \nStossel.\nI illustrates my point very clearly. and please comment.\n\nthanks for the conversation.",

Don't you have stuff to do \nyou'd better pay somone to do? Laundry? housekeeping? cooking?\n\nwhy don't you do it?\n\nFor most people they're too expensive for your income. so you can't afford \nthem. now I know dozens of people who'd be super happy to cook and clean \nfor others if they just could get a room and eat and a bit of money. They \ndon't have ambitions of becoming millionaires. they just want to \nparticipate in life.\n\nBut the laws make it illegal to contract or hire them. You need to pay \nthem  aminimum wage, insurance, install a stupid wheelchair ramp in case \nsomeone shows up with disabilities... sutpid tuff like this make it \nimpoossible for these people to work.\n\nI'm all for paying people overtime. I'm an independent so I contract with \ncompanies and factor in my best estimate of what the work would cost me in \nterms of time, outsourcing, travel, etc and leave me with something left \nover whether I worked 5min or 50 hours.\n\nIf I contract with hourly people I request a regular status report so \nthings can be adjusted as we go along and not have to deal with an invoice \nor overtime twice what we had anticipated.\n\nSee it's that whole concept of employee/employer that keeps people \nprisoners of their JOB. Why can't you walk into a business, ask if they \nhave some work, negotiate a compensation and delivery time, do the work , \nget paid, and leave or do it over the next day?\n\nbecause the state has made it hard and cumbersome for employers to hire \nlike this with mandates on insurance, work conditions etc.\n\nNow to your point about the rich people: you wrote:\n\n    The point is: at a certain threshold rich ppl will get richer and \nricher even if they\n     do nothing \u2013 and if someone gets richer \u2013 guess what other persons \nhave to\n    get poorer \u2026 (that is somewhat simplified because in general the total \namount\n    of available goods increase as well \u2013 but  it is still true as this \nprocess is much\n    slower, than the redistribution from poor and middle class to the rich \nones)\n\nSo what? rich people are getting richer. some will bust because they invest \nin loosing propositions. some will just spend it on stupid shit. how's that \nyour problem?\n\nwhen someone gets richer how does that mena that others are getting poorer?\nthat is a school/media induced belief.\n\nRich people have capital and that capital can be used by others to build \nnew projects, enterprises and businesses. Some will win, some will lose.\n\nWhat I am oposing is the concept of  a State coming in and taking people's \nmoney and deciding what happens to it.\n\nCheers",

That's why I think a good start would be the disenfranchisement of \nbenefit recipients.\n\nBut I realize that it ain't gonna happen because people are basically \nrapacious and see everything from their own perspective only.

The working \nclass were glad when Clinton made changes to the Welfare program, termed \n\"welfare to work\". It limited how long and how many times you could use it. \nForcing many back to work for fear of losing benefits. Until Bush(2nd) \nenacted even more welfare programs and doubled the roles and debt. We now \nhave more people drawing money from the federal Treasury than paying taxes \ninto it. We either have to stop the loss of funds or raise taxes. Our form \nof Gov't will collapse if not. If you wish to speak for all Americans and \nhow it ALL works it would help if you didn't invent opinions for the rest \nof us. It's wanted and it's needed. The TEA party proved it. If their \nplatform was a little more in the middle and not on the fringe like uber \nliberals or conservatives it would be accepted by most. Logic and common \nsense isn't how the political machine works, enough of us could change it. \nIt happened by force in 1776. It should be able to be accomplished now \nthrough voting out incumbents and demanding term limits. If you wish to \ntake from your neighbor rather than work, that's your cross to bear. I want \nour Gov't to be gutted and rebuilt. No more tax breaks for corporations \nthat don't provide jobs here, no more tax exemptions for anything, flat tax \nonly. No deductions, no shelter, no deferment. You make it you pay it! Then \nkick the sloths off the welfare rolls, find them jobs and if they refuse, \ndo like the countries in South America, let them beg! If family doesn't \nwant to help, so be it. So continue to whine about those of us who push and \nwrite our representatives and demand change. Hopefully you'll have guts \nenough to join. If not get your food stamps and subsidized housing taken \ncare of, I wouldn't want you to miss an episode of Springer. One of your \nrelatives might get their 15 minutes of fame!",
