Charles Schumer receives the most campaign money \nfrom Time Warner Cable is because Schumer's ban on data caps in NY State \nactually saved Time Warner Cable's business in the long run, especially \nwhen TWC is available in NY AND Los Angeles, which are markets that Comcast \npurposely avoided and left, respectively, right before the latter company \nimplemented its data caps and throttling policies.\n\nUnless, of course, Charles Schumer is purposely letting Comcast buy TWC, so \nthat Comcast gets called out for its data capping AND throttling \nshenanigans.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, should be outright embarrassed how its biggest \ncompany is the source of all what is wrong with American internet, to the \npoint JAPAN calls Americans \"LAGGERS\".  In real life, I ran into a \nPhiladelphia native in a Comcast market and sardonically told him, \"Thanks \nfor Comcast\"; he responded back, \"I am well-aware of Comcast's \nreputation\"...to the point Philly continually gets dissed into \n\"FAILadelphia\", because of Comcast's data capping and throttling \nshenanigans.  Even Occupy Philly occupied Comcast HQ.\n\nOh, here's Comcast HQ's contact info:\n\nComcast Headquarters\n1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n215-286-1700\n\nWhether Comcast likes it or not, once they buy TWC, the FCC is waiting to \nclamp down on Comcast's data caps and throttling policies.  Seriously, data \ncaps AND throttling on residential internet in Silicon Valley!?  Even The \nBronx, of all places, has better internet!  Even L.A., let alone NYC, hate \ndata caps.\n\nAs for Michael Powell, even Howard Stern called him out, even before the \nprior became the NCTA President.\ufeff",

To me \nthat sounds like A. no more paying for speed, now paying per byte. B. No \nmore compressing high bandwidth content hence making my digital consumption \ntake up more bytes. C. No more package deals as it's no longer an all you \ncan eat buffet of data. And D (this is the kicker) Content coming directly \nfrom the ISP will flow just as content from anyone else (cloud DVR \nrecordings yeah that'll count against your data usage) That's lose for the \ncontent providers (youtube, Netflix, hulu etc), lose for the service \nproviders (Comcast, Verizon, Google etc) and lose for the consumer (you, \nme, etc).
