I finally left the church \nbut my ex husband has brainwashed out daughter. Yeah I married a guy--again \nfor security and safety reasons.  I was celibate most the time too.  ",

I dont approve some \nparts of the Bible.. does that make sense?\nI always wanted to be a vegetarian, but its sooo hard, once you have eaten \nmeat for 7 years of your life, and just found out what vegetarians are/is.. \nBut arent we animals too? well, we evolved from apes, INTO humans, so, \ntechnically, we are animals. So, I dont think you should worry about \ncomparing them ;)\nI dont love my self either, I'd say that Im not a selfish person, but, most \npeople say that f you say such thing.. you are probably selfish XP\nThat part is completely your opinion, so I cant argue with that :] Yes, \neverything IS our fault, **I cant remember what I said, it was last night, \nI think :P**\nI kind of dont believe in God, because of all that Big Bang stuff, and that \neverything evolved. If everything evolved, then God didnt, REALLY create \nAdam and Eve.. we just.. evolved from an ape.\nAbout that part, since you said that evrything os OUR fault, then why does \na good person have to say Thank you to someone, that.. didnt make the \nsuccess..for them? (I cant word my.. sentences properly XP) Well, scratch \nthat, I dont know if thats what other people said, or if thats your \nopinion, sooo... I dont really have anything to say about that..",

I just ignore \nsome of them, for example when it says \"you can eat animals that do not \nhave hoof\" But, animals have life too, so if we eat them, we aren't loving \nthem, or we are but just for eating them. I am a vegetarian, because I \nthink... would people like if others kill them to eat them? I know I \nshouldn't compare animals with humans, but some humans act like real \nanimals and animales have feelings too, so... I do can forgive, but I don't \nforget. The \"love everyone\" just works with people that love themselves... \nin my case no.. unfortunately I don't love myself, but that's other case. \nFor me God IS perfect... maybe he considers those \"imperfect\" things as \nperfection; and that's why he made them. But on Earth, everything that \nhappens is OUR fault. He created us as free living things, and if we do \nsomething bad, he will make a punishment to that, what means is our fault, \nbecause if we do something good, he will give good things (not all the \ntime, but there's a reason: He wanna prove our faith. He just made Adan and \nEva as perfects HUMANS. I mean, their structure and all xd. He doesn't \ncreate personalities, he creates the outside... Sometimes we ask... why do \nbad things happen to good people? But we will never know the answer.. just \nGod knows. Maybe because that person isn't the way we thinks... or has \nreached good things in life but didn't say thanks to God, because the \nsuccess is because of the opportunities that he gives to us. Probably some \nparts of the Bible are wrong, and we don't know that... but, God didn't \nwrite it.",

I've seen many different haters, but I've NEVER seen a commenter \nlike Lola...\n\nI'm going to argue with you, Lola, so if you are reading and don't want to \nread this and you really are SICK OF THIS ARGUMENT, go away right now \nbefore you read it and reply back to me.\n\n\n\nTo Lola Lavish,\n\n        First off, Lola, Internet slang is part of us teenagers' lives. \nIt's slowly gaining popularity, and if they don't know Internet slang, many \npeople tend to feel left out because it is used so frequently. If you've \never felt that way, you know how horrible it is to feel left out. That's \nwhy most of us use/know/understand Internet slang. Second, Lola - most of \nyour replies are very racist and rude. You were very impolite towards \nAfrican Americans and Mexicans. They are human, and there are many smart \n'blacks' and Mexicans out there. Next, you were talking about bullying like \nit was nothing. Bullying ruins lives, and it's not something you can just \ncasually talk about as if it were nothing. I've been bullied, and still am \nbeing subtly bullied, and it's HORRIBLE. Fourth, if you are an adult, then \nwhy are you acting so immature? If you were an adult, you'd know that these \nteenagers on here probably are going through... that stage of life - \npuberty. I know because I am going through puberty right now. I'm 13, by \nthe way. Anyways, this means that the typical teenagers get angry easily \nand their words usually mean nothing. Adults know about this, and most of \nthem just brush it off, thinking '_oh well, they are..._ growing up'. You, \nhowever, just keep replying and replying, further stressing the teens out. \nThis flows in well with my last point. You are being very self - centered \nand immature. My mum always does this kind of thing, teasing others \n(including her own family, which includes ME) harshly, not caring about \nothers' feelings, echoing back another's words very rudely, fighting \nunnecessarily, and basically living to make others angry. She knows that \nshe is self - centered, but she won't admit that she is immature because \nshe is very prideful. You are just like my mother.\n\nSincerely,\nHeart of the Stars",

I'm a \nChristian and while by the bibles standards it does say that gays are \nsupposed to go to hell but if Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and if \nbeing gay is a sin, that means that they are taken care of. Don't judge \nsomeone because of their sexual preference and don't try to change them \nbecause you don't like who they are. They can't change so don't force them \nto. \ufeff",

God doesn't hate them, he \nloves all his children, but if they don't accept Jesus as their Savior and \naccept God into their life, then that's God's decision whether they go to \nhell or not.

He can't help who he \nfalls in love with, he's just being HIMSELF and hat's why I love him. If \nyou're really going to unsubscribe over something as unimportant and \nirrelevant as which gender he's attracted to, then I'm sorry, but you're a \nvery low person and I honestly feel bad for you. Him being gay does not \neffect you, nor his videos. I really hope that if you are unsubscribing \nbecause of this small fact, you open your eyes someday and see how dumb \nyou're being.

If he really didn't \nwant homosexuality in his world then why would he even allow the human \nbrain to be attracted to the same sex? \n\n\"The bible is against it\": Cool. Did god write the bible. No. Anyone \ncould've put what's in there. \n\n\"It's unnatural\": Dude, it's the 21st century. Homosexuality has been \naround for a while. And change can be good sometimes. So grow a pair and \naccept it.\n\n\"It's disgusting\": ok. I find naked women disgusting and you don't see me \nrunning around youtube complaining about it. \n\n\"Gays are evil\": and how would you know? Did you meet them? What's so evil \nabout liking the same gender? \n\n\"They are different\": what's so different about them? Do they have a mouth? \nYes. Do they have noses? Yes. Are they a giant fire breathing dragon who is \ngoing to gnaw off your head and slurp down your spinal cord like spaghetti? \nNo! They are human beings just like us! All were created equal.\n\n\"My parents said they are bad\": News flash, your parents are ignorant. You \nonly have a vindictive attitude against something when your parents teach \nyou to. Try listening to the millions of non-ignorant smart people in the \nworld. \n\n\"The human race is going to end because gay people can't make babies\": \n(facepalm) like I said before, some people are born gay. And some people \nare born straight. There are plenty of straight people on this earth so I \nthink we don't need to worry about that :/.\n\n\nAnd before you reply back saying \"EUUUGHH your grammar sucks\" or \"yur probs \ngayy\" or something stupid like that, grow up. That's it. Grow up. Simple.",

Because all these people who are \nnot real disciples of Christ. I'm not saying I'm perfect or anything. I'm \nno better than the person who wrote that comment. I just hope those people \nrealize that as a genuine christian, they should still love homosexual \npeople. Doesn't mean they have to love their actions or choices or accept \ntheir beliefs but just to love the person. It just makes me so angry when i \nsee these kind of things.",
