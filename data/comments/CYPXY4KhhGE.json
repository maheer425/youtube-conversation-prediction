I'll name the \nones I saw:\n-The glasses are on Formula Rossa because Abu Dhabi has sand storms and the \neyes must be protected by sand, not objects.\n-Kingda Ka rolls upwards to the left.\n-The Steel Dragon 2000 video is by Theme Park Review, not CoastersView. In \nfact, CoastersView only used the footage for a video of the tallest \ncoasters in the world.\n-Parrot Coaster (Flying Over the Rainforest) at Ocean Kingdom is actually \nthe longest and fastest wing coaster at 4,193 feet and 67.1 miles per hour.\n-Diving Coaster at Happy Valley Shanghai is actually the tallest diving \ncoaster in the world with 213 feet of height.\n-All except 2 dive coasters have floorless trains.\n-All flying coasters have zero-g rolls.\ufeff",
