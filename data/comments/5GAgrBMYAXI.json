This \nis particularly true in the Black community.  The only adjustment one can \nmake is to date a fat girl in the Black community.  The sweet (Black) Emily \ntype loving a geeky Black boy simply doesn't exist. Asian guys have it \ngood, because there are Emily types available but still they have to have \nthe balls to get her.  Emily would have been the perfect girlfriend for me. ",
