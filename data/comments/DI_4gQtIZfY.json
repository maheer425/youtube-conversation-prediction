I \njust fail to see the argument. I mean look, the whole \"corporations are \npeople\" is a talking point. Corporations actually ARE composed entirely of \nhuman beings. Pooled resources do not obviate that simple fact. Families \nare people as well. As are gangs, tribes, societies, faculties, and any \nother conglomeration you might pick.\n\nWhen one side of the equation is out of balance, in a free society it is up \nto US to make up the difference. Rather than railing on the Supreme Court, \nperhaps you should rail on the simpletons that keep casting votes against \ntheir own interests. So what if the Koch brothers spent $10 mil to \ninfluence some race. It would be wasted money if people weren't so FUCKING \nSTUPID, UNINFORMED, and DISINTERESTED.\n\nThe problem isn't that there's too much money in politics, it's that THERE \nAREN'T ENOUGH FUNCTIONAL BRAINS IN THE ELECTORATE. And you can't solve that \nby taking money out of politics. At best, you'll just get the same game \nwith less money wasted by people whose money we should be WASTING.     \ufeff",

It hurts your exposure and \ninfluence, but your first amendment rights remain intact. The commercial is \na product you bought for money.

A corporation does not get personhood \nrights or citizen rights because a corporation is not a person or citizen. \nBy the same token you can't charge a corporation with murder or sentence it \nto jail.\n\nAs for money in politics, the problem is unequal access to the public \nsphere. The one with most money will get their message heard often, and the \none with less money will not. This takes form as ads on radio, tv, \nnewspapers etc. If, for example, you want to run a radio ad for your \ncampaign but someone else has bought up all the important air time on all \nthe most popular stations, what can you do about it? Not much, in today's \nUSA. You could say people should be smart enough to invest time in getting \nsavvy with the politics and the facts, but most people don't have all that \nmuch time or energy to do it. There's a big difference between ought and \nis. Leveling the field among competing parties will at least allow the less \npowerful to get their say in the public sphere.

Period.\n\n2 - You can word an amendment such that \"misinterpretation\" is impossible. \nExample: \"Thou shalt not kill\" can be misinterpreted by saying that the \n*state* is not a person, it's an entity, therefore it can execute someone. \nBut if you can word your amendment to explicitly describe then prohibit \nactions and scenarios.

We are convicted of our cause but we are pushed out of the \nconversation for our lack of organization. My goal is to spread a network \nacross the globe that takes real action for social justice, united under \none  cause of justice for all- not just money for few. I have a dream that \none day we can all be wealthy, in sound mind and body and most importantly, \nfree. That is merely the surface though. You seem like someone who would be \ninterested in a cause like that. Right now I am only located on youtube but \nkeep an eye out for something like what I describe. My short term goal is \nto have a fully functioning cell up and running within 10 years. If you are \na chemist, physicist, a biologist or are good with electronics or computer \nhacking it will be a plus but we will need all kinds of support. Keep up \nwhat it is you are doing though, I know we can make a difference and maybe \none day a bigger difference.",

That will fix everything!\"\n\nI think that you're missing a vital point within the point that you've \npresented: Government protecting the rich, ensures that they are immune to \nmarket forces.\n\nBy forcing those wealthy entrepreneurs to deal directly with the market \nwithout legal immunity, and without bailout guarantees, any abuses of the \nmarket will lead to a direct loss in sales. Hence, they will be punished \nand correct their behavior or face extinction.\n\nSo long as Government is involved, it will always protect the party that \ngrants it the most power. And that will always be the party that has the \nmost money.\n\nI also want to focus a bit on this comment: \"...government corrupted by and \nworking for the rich...\"\n\nGovernment is Corrupt on account of Power; it does not matter if that power \nis in the hands of the wealthy, nor \"the people.\" Communism proves this, \nCorporatism proves this. Also, those who have power, use that power to \nenrich themselves, so it should be no surprise that those in bed with \npoliticians should be wealthy, even if they didn't begin this relationship \nas wealthy persons. The Communist Elite proves this yet again.",

Because despite what you have seen in Norris & \nStallone movies people die a lot in wars, & white people die in wars just \nlike everyone else.\n\nAdditionally you might want to consider the possibility that Mexico & \nCanada i.e. America's geographic neighbors aren't likely to shelter \nAmerican militants or provide arms & equipment to them. Which by the way \nwas the case with both the Viet Cong & the Taliban.\n\nFurthermore, you might want to remember that unlike Afghanistan & Vietnam \nwhere people were attempting to expel a foreign invader, your little \ninsurrection will striking at people i.e. military, law enforcement, \ngovernment workers, & elected officials; who have friends, lovers, & family \nmembers within your pool of potential revolutionaries. Also funny thing \nabout soldiers, they tend to like fellow soldiers more than other people, & \ntend to dislike people that shoot at their fellow soldiers. People in the \nmilitary are funny like that.\n\nIn other words, in a little place I like to call reality, civil wars are \nawful bloody affairs that involve massive death tolls to both combatants & \ncivilians alike from both sides. They are not simplistic white hat versus \nblack hat affairs where everyone joins your team because you think your \nright. Because most people will simply want to go about their lives without \ngetting shot or blown up, by you or the government.\n\nContinuing on, you might want to contemplate the idea that you so keen to \nbe revolutionaries might not be on the same page, & could in fact end up \nwith multiple factions vying for supremacy against each other & the current \ngovernment.\n\n& crushing as this is going to be for you to hear, I am sorry you probably \naren't going to be the one leading your glorious revolution. In all \nlikelihood you will be just another bullet sponge, that no one remembers or \ncares about, with the exception of your family who has to try & continue \non, even though you are a corpse. That's another one of those funny things \nabout war, poor dumb bastards nobody remembers, tend to outnumber the \npeople they make action movies about years after the fact.\n\nNow I realize you probably don't actually care about any of these facts, \nafter all contemplating the idea that an actual war might have consequences \nmore complicated than what happens in a Rambo movie, well that isn't nearly \nas stimulating as stroking your deer rifle & fantasizing about being a war \nhero.\n\nBut you see some of us who prefer to live in a little place I call reality, \nunderstand what you are really talking about, namely a whole lot people \nbeing killed regardless of where they stand or what they believe. Probably \nin the millions neighborhood, which will also be coupled with even more \ncasualties due to the collapse of infrastructure as each faction attempts \nto weaken the other, by destroying the infrastructure used by other \nfactions. & also the very real possibility that like so many other violent \nrevolutions through out human history, you might just replace the current \nsystem with something worse.\n\nYou know the kind that people point to decades & centuries after the fact & \nremark upon the atrocities that characterized the transition. That whole \nregimes that come to power via violence, continuing to use violence to \nensure the continuation of their power.\n\nDoesn't really matter though does it?
