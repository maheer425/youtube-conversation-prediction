Most of them aren't focused on the really important things.\nBecause the most important job the GOP and Dems to is to polarize the \ndebate to take the attention away from the REAL problems.\nAt least Obama did lots of things that have been in the plans for 30+ years.\nBut even health care is a small concession, compared to what he keeps doing \nthat is not in the interest of the 99%.\nThe USA needs to end bipartidarism. END IT.\nIn theory the process is simple, but since it's utterly against the \npolitical establishment it's nearly impossible to be adopted.\nRunoff elections of every vote where first place don't get 50% of valid \nvotes. Put on the ballot of the runoff every candidate that got at least \n10% of valid votes.\nOut of a sudden, you no longer have to vote GOP or dems because if you vote \nfor a fringe party you're giving a vote to the other side of the isle.\nA centrist party becomes possible.\nPS: Yeah, I'm a centrist. There's no solution from the extreme left or \nextreme right. The problem isn't changing ideology, The problem is knowing \nthe real data (spin free) and then fixing problems. All ideologies are bad.\nOf the developed world:\n  Only the USA has mainstream parties that deny climate change.\n  Only the USA has an anti abortion mainstream party.\nMuch like I actually tell my fellow Brazilians that never been to the USA, \nGermany or the UK to at least once go there, I tell american citizens to at \nleast once go to Europe and spend at least a week there actually talking to \npeople.

Everybody was \nsupposed to save money by undercutting the competition.. well its kinda \nhard to undercut the competition when you force people to add 1000 \ndifferent things to a plan that most people wont use, and then allow kids \nup to 26 to stay on their parent plans. The only people paying less for \ninsurance nowadays are people who make under $15,000 and are getting \nsubsidized on the tax payers dime.  No doctors want to accept it, making a \nhuge shortage of doctors for people with those plans. There are so many \nfailures from obamacare, I could go on for hours.... And its pretty \napparent that you dont know what the Affordable Care Act is and defend it \nby default since its called obamacare.

The TPP was started by four countries that \nlaid the base for the treaty.  In those four countries the treaty is \nworking and anyone can read what laws those countries had to pass. \n-I don't understand why would you lose your healthcare in Australia.  Is \ntrue that if the treaty is applied drug companies will have more rights \nover the patents of some drugs but this companies did pay for the research. \n \n-If you live in the UK corporations control everything in your daily life. \n Your country invented corporations on their current form.  \n-Seattle and any city that is in the TPP region can benefit by creating \nmore competitive markets, liberating capital and creating a set of rules \nthat everyone has to abide by.  Seattle is a city that trades with Canada \nand Asia so any Pacific treaties will bring more work to the Port of \nSeattle and the Port of Tacoma.  We have many multinational companies and \nmany local companies that service those companies so it will create more \nwealth for all of those companies.  People that service the middle class as \nis my case will benefit because this multinationals will hired more middle \nmanagers.  That means more clients for me.  \n-I would like to see a more integrated Pacific region and the problem with \nthis treaty is that it doesn't deal with the labor force.  I believe that \nunions and left groups should strive for including the labor into the \ntreaty instead of fighting the treaty. If part of the rules where better \ncontrols on quality, much better oversight of labor rights and a more \nprotection of individual rights this treaty would lift the biggest and most \nimportant region in the world to a new standard.
