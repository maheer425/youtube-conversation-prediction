South of France is known for its Italian \ninfluence in architecture & food. I got a job in a small pizzeria where I \nstarted as a busboy, later becoming a head chef. It was there I met my \neventual lover, Gastone. He was my assistant chef. In a pizza contest, we \nwere voted best chefs in South France and won with our Margherita Pizza. We \nlived a fantastic, exciting lifestyle, full of adventure over the next \nyear; the nightlife was especially fantastic, filled with handsome \nFrenchmen we has come to know very well. Nowhere in the world was there a \nmore free place for homosexuals than the French nightlife; A place where I \nfelt I belonged. Gastone and I were a happy couple. Tragically, things took \na turn for the worst. We lost the pizza contest the next year, but that was \njust the beginning. I came to work early one morning & was greeted by the \nsmell of pizza. Except it wasn't really pizza! It was Gastone in the oven; \nhis mutilated body burnt to a crisp, covered in cheese. It was depressing. \nI had lost a lover & after a short time, I returned to my home in Germany. \nI've since reverted to being straight. To this day, I have a phobia of \npizza & when I smell it, all I can smell is the charred body of Gastone.\nHomosexuality is not welcomed in this world. Everyone should do as I did \nand accept that hard reality. It will only cause you pain if you don't... \njust as it did for me.\ufeff",

Ironically, you say that 'we' need to \npick up a biology book, and then you state some pseudo-psychology about why \nmen and women have sex without going into depth. It's you, who needs to \nmove past primary school biology, and study nature in DEPTH. Because when \nyou start applying some critical thinking skills and going further in the \nsubject of human sexuality, you'll find it's not so simple and black and \nwhite as you think. Just as everything else, it's complex, has many \nfactors, and goes beyond your way basic thinking strategy. But BEFORE you \ndo that, because clearly the confusion is a bit too much for you to grasp \nnow, I'd say you take some time off, relax and stop caring so much about \nother people's lives. Focus on your own, make yourself happy and at peace \nwith things, before you go off to destroying the happiness of everyone else \naround with your negativity. Take a deep breath, take it easy. ",

A very specific \nkind of perception of victimhood, with the kind of frightening angry behind \nit that Cenk refers to at the end of this video. I have been scared a few \ntimes, I'll be honest.

Using his Youtube views as a proxy for people's distrust in mainstream \nmedia and as an indicator of people turning to TYT for truth in reporting \nreal news.  Example.. \"We've got over 1 billion views on YT because no \nlonger trust mainstream media to report the truth.  Whereas the truth is \nmore like TYT spams Youtube with thousands of videos, but gets the majority \nof their views from the ones dealing with pop culture or TMZ/National \nEnquirer type stories, many of which contain salacious or misleading \ntitles/thumbnails. \n2. \"George Bush won the disputed 2004 election because his cousin worked \nfor Fox News and called the results first.  All the other news stations \ndidn't want to be late, so therefore, they immediately repeated this \ndeclaration\".  \n3. \"The USA has the lowest corporate tax rate among OECD countries.\"\n4. His self serving and biased account of how he \"quit\" MSNBC, because his \nbosses wanted to silence him.\n5. \"Mainstream media calls everything right down the middle.  GOP says \nthis, Dems say this.\" \n6. Even his signature calling about getting money out of politics is laced \nwith half truths.  Most people, including myself agree that money should \nnot corrupt politics, so I agree with the intent.  But to back his \nposition, he quotes \"facts\" about \"x\" percentage of the time, the candidate \nwith the highest fundraising wins the election.  He says this and all \nimpressionable TYT viewers thinks he's got a point.  But Cenk never raises \nthe well known principle that money doesn't just influence the winner, but \nthat it follows the winner.  Meaning, if a candidate is going to win, even \nby a landslide, a donor will still donate money to that candiate for \npossibly future access.  That doesn't mean the money helps determine the \nwinner.  Sure, the money might still be intended for less than noble \nreasons in the future, but the point is it doesn't determine the winner.  \nThe fact Cenk never points that out, or that TYT vierwers can never figure \nthis out is infuriating, although not unexpected.",

One of the \nfirst things out of my new bosses mouth was \"maybe it is genetics, this is \nwhy different races shouldn't breed\" in reference to my hair loss [I'm a \nwoman]. Do I want money? Yes. Do I want money from random strangers who \nfeel sorry for me? No. Due to the former I am going to continue to work for \nthis racist bitch until I find a new job which is hopefully going to be as \nfast as possible. \n\nPeople who make up crap like this to get attention and money make me so mad \nwhen there are so many people out there who live and put up with REAL shit \nlike this every day and don't cause a fuss about it.  Because in the end, \nthe opinions of vile, racist, homophobic bigots mean nothing other than \nthey live sad pathetic little lives.\ufeff",
