Carbs like fructans and galactans are \nuniversally poorly absorbed by all people, and fermentation of these carbs \nby bacteria in your gut is what causes gas production and subsequent \ngastrointestinal distress.\n\nSo eating gluten free products may actually help you feel better.

Of course, is easier to \nbelieve that when the sorcerers or whatever they call themselves showed \nreal power and keep people terrified and the believe strong amongst the \nuneducated population. After all, some of their lore (at least potions) had \nsome real effects, besides is hard to argue the power of a sorcerer clad in \nscary sh*t with a couple of zombies at their command,\n\nAnd yes, that is also well documented. Apparently they made some kind of \nconcoction that produced death-like symptoms so their victims where buried \nand later exhumed by the priest. Of course the \"zombies\" where completely \nharmless, but as the side effect of the drug and possibly the oxygen \ndeprivation produced brain damage; couple that with the fears and \nsuperstition and you have the sad story of brain damaged people \nmiraculously \"returned\" from the dead to be used as slaves as a symbol for \nsome arseh**e power hungry creep.\n\nAs for your interpretation.. no, you should never blindly believe anything \nthat is been told to you; you should always demand evidence for any \nnon-trivial claim and before accepting the evidence you should check and \nvalidate it and make sure that it supports it. And remember two important \nrules: first, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, \nparticularly when the claim has a deep impact in your life or well being \nand second, you should be ALWAYS open to reconsider a position when more \nevidence in either direction is available.\n\nAnd since thats also true for the stuff I posted, feel free to use these \nreferences as a starting point:\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/maq.1983.14.4.02a00030/pdf\nhttp://harpers.org/archive/1984/04/the-pharmacology-of-zombies/",
