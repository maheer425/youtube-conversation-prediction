Thats \nwhy i wish i wasn't born here cause school has not enough discipline here.",

Primarily because for instance that's a very accurate \nlist of \"what makes a perfect man\" whereas polls over here show hugely \nvarying ideas of an ideal partner in physical terms, height, shape, colour \netc. etc. but that the ones that stay the same are generally what goes in \nin the mind, ie. Intelligence, a sense of humour, stepping in to help a \nwoman etc.\n\nAlso not supporting your argument is the very open culture of desiring \npeople who your views would suggest are unattractive and yet millions \nopenly admit to, chubby chasers etc.\n\nThe truth is that in western cultures for quite a while and increasingly so \nnow, things like those seem trivial in our cultures. We all may lust after \nsomone because their bodies are very nice and admire that but it doesn't \nmean that it factors into your ideal partner.",

Did the people who \nseeks wealth in their partners call you disgusting for having different \nthoughts? You're taking things so directly and hastily make criticism \nfocusing on one premise of my comment, failing to see the main gist. My \npoint was that you shouldn't hastily jump to conclusions especially when it \ncomes to judging an ethnic group, and that making generalizations from a \nvery small sample is foolish. I know you weren't exactly doing what I've \ndescribed above, since I did notice you were calling ppl with those values \ndisgusting, not Koreans. I was only trying to tell you that this is \ndefinitely not the accurate representation of Korean society and their \nvalues, since you were wondering about the credibility. I was quite upset \nat this video, since it is quite manipulative and could implant false \nimages of Koreans into foreigners who are completely oblivious to this \nmatter. I tried to oppose to your claim while not sounding rude at the same \ntime, but I guess my words made you resentful. I apologize if that's the \ncase, and I do accept your apology as well. \n\nI wasn't forcing my opinion on you or stopping you from freely expressing \nyours either. Seems as you've totally misunderstood my point. My emphasis \nwas not on the valuing different ideas part... If you were busy not giving \na fuck, why reply now? But oh well I do understand your resentment since \nyou've completely misinterpreted my point. ",

The \ntruth is your whole statement is hypocritical.\nSee the difference is I recognize there's difference, and though I feel \nfree to express my opinion of the other way of life I'm not trying to force \nmy opinions on anyone or stop anyone else from expressing their opinions. \nYou are.\n\nI'm sorry for the late reply, was busy not giving a fuck",

Having said that, \nI'm a Korean who didn't grow up in Korea, so it's unlikely this video would \nreflect my own values anyway, considering it's about current views of \nKorean people who grew up there.\n\nIf I were to add my 2 cents, from what I've seen and heard from my Korean \nrelatives who spent their entire lives there, this sort of view is actually \nquite prevalent. It's admittedly not so much a set-in-stone attitude as S&M \nhave (unintentionally) made it sound, but from what my cousins have told me \nthose are the general themes (i.e. appearance, financially stable job, \netc.). But the key word, I think, is IDEAL. Describing someone who ticks \nall your ideal boxes and describing someone who you'd actually like to live \nwith for the rest of your life are two different things for most people.\n\nFor example one of cousins, male and older than me, describes his ideal \ntype as being shorter than him but has long legs, long straight black hair, \nand a teacher. In reality he's dating a totally average (i.e. NOT Kim \nTaeHee), but also totally lovely, girl with an office job who he's head \nover heels in love with. \n\nThis got really really long winded. ANYWAY, point is, there's a marked \ndifference between a Korean person's ideal type and that same person's \nactual preferences. I think it's also important to remember the \"ideal \ntype\" conversation is often light, or at least not overly serious. ",
