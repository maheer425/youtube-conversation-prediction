The problem is, you have been told the same thing most \ncountries teaches their young in history lessons; They were always right \nand their enemies were heartless monsters (same here). It is important to \nkeep in mind that people who inhabit this country today are not the same \nones that lived during the ages of conflict, and even if their ancestors \nhad done evil deeds, it isn't right to blame it on their children. Sure, \npeople tend to unquestionably assume whatever their ancestors did was \nright, a lot of Turkish people do infact have an undying hatred towards \nGreece and/or any other country they conflicted with before, but i like to \nbelieve we are all sane enough to understand that just because there is ill \nhistory between two countries, it doesn't mean we should keep up the fight \ntoday. There are a lot of innocent people who inhabit Anatolia who are \nsimply believing the stories their elders are telling them, i don't think \nanyone needs to see what you want to see.\n\n With all that said, Turkey isn't exactly a shining example of a nice \nmodern society. I would trade the current leader, the ever censoring \nreligious extremist, with any other at this point. I am already searching \nways to leave this country asap and continue studying abroad.\n\n One more thing; why do people not remove the head,tail and legs of shrimps \nin Greece? Especially in a spaghetti. That was my biggest complaint during \nmy trip to Greece. The food was amazing, but why can't i eat my food \nwithout having to clean it up first? I hate the way those shrimps look at \nme... With their beady eyes and crawly legs...\n ",

I could care less what happens to them. \nThey deserve anything and everything the Greeks and Latins would dish out \nto them, maybe a bit more even. Hell; I'd personally piss on the grave of \nSultan Mehmed II, the \"conqueror of Constantinople\", if I were ever given \nthe opportunity.\n\n\nI applaud the Greeks for what they did to Turkish peoples during their \nrevolution.

For Barack Obama's 2012 get out the vote \nprogram, see Project Narwhal.\n@20\n@9\nNarwhal@220Side and bottom views of an individual@220Size compared to an \naverage humanConservation status\n@7Kingdom:@10@150The frequent (solid) and rare (striped) occurrence of \nnarwhal populationsThe narwhal, or narwhale (Monodon monoceros), is a \nmedium-sized toothed whale and possesses a large \"tusk\" from a protruding \ncanine tooth. It lives year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, \nCanada, and Russia. It is one of two living species of whale in the \nMonodontidae family, along with the beluga whale. The narwhal males are \ndistinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated \nupper left canine. The narwhal was one of many species described by Carolus \nLinnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758.Like the beluga, \nnarwhals are medium-sized whales. For both sexes, excluding the male's \ntusk, the total body size can range from 3.95 to 5.5 metres (13.0 to 18.0 \nfeet); the males are slightly larger than the females. The average weight \nof an adult narwhal is 800 to 1,600 kilograms (1,800 to 3,500 pounds). At \naround 11 to 13 years old, the males become sexually mature; females become \nsexually mature at about 5 to 8 years old. Narwhals do not have a dorsal \nfin, and their neck vertebrae are jointed like those of other mammals, not \nfused as in dolphins and most whales.Found primarily in Canadian Arctic and \nGreenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialized \nArctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, \nunder dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and \nGreenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the \nremainder of their diet. Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean \nas summer comes. In the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to \n1,500 metres (4,900 feet) in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. \nNarwhals, like most toothed whales, communicate with \"clicks\", \"whistles\", \nand \"knocks\".Narwhals can live up to 50 years old. They are often killed by \nsuffocation when the sea ice freezes over. Another cause of fatality, \nspecifically among young whales, is starvation. The current population of \nthe narwhal is about 75,000, so narwhals qualify for Near Threatened under \nthe criterion of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nNarwhals have been harvested for over a thousand years by Inuit people in \nnorthern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory, and a regulated \nsubsistence hunt continues",
