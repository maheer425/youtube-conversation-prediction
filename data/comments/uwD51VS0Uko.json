Really funny. You \nshould check out 2PM Show, you'll love him even more and the rest of the \nmembers, ofcourse. But I'm warning you, 2PM are bunch of goofballs. They \nare faaaaaarrr from the typical \"Idol Image\". They're barely sane. \nOoooopsss! Forgive me for being such a blabber. \n\nWelcome to the crazy world of Hottest! \u2665",

For GG and BB/GD-Taeyang the YouTube \nMusic awards is what has brought them so many views on Good Boy, I got a \nBoy, and etc. For 2NE1 it was the fact that they were on The Bachelorette, \nhad their songs played on US Radios, and had their song featured in a Mac \nBook Air US Commercial that has netted them a lot more views. Plus the \nvideos you're talking about are a LOT older than this, so it's silly to \ncompare this 2PM video to them. If 2PM was put on the YouTube Awards and \nfeature in America more they'd have the same kind of views. 11.2 million \nviews in 5months is pretty good for a K-Pop group and shows that 2Pm is \nindeed very popular.",

Lets not blame each other. Im sure everyone has put our hearts and \nsoul into voting and cheering for 2PM and I won't deny it, I do want them \nto win BADLY.\n\nLike many of fans would say, as long as 2PM knows that there are fans who \nare still cheering supporting and loving the music they produced, I'm sure \nthey will be happy. \n\nHence, whatever happens, LETS NOT GIVE UP. Because once Hottests work \ntogether, we can do it. \n\nFor #2PM, we shall stand together! \n\nHwaiting 2PM and Hottests! \ud83d\udcaa\ufeff",
