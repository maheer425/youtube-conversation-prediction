Tried a new vet and she recommended just feeding her no \ngrain wet food (like fish or mince)  I opted for feeding her mince so I \ncould use it to lead her through simple exercises as she is VERY food \nmotivated  (walking up and down a few stairs inbetween each piece or \njumping up and down from a chair) She has now lost about 1 1/4 kgs in 4 \nmonths (which is  alot for a cat). Vet also thought my cats obsession with \nfood might have come from her being a stray (she was only 4kg's when I got \nher and had put on 2kgs within a couple of months). I have been a bit slack \nin the last couple of months and some biscuits have crept in again but she \nis continuing to gradually loose weight so I'm hoping my early efforts have \nkick started her metabolism again.\n\nFor my underweight cat the vet recommended feeding them biscuits biscuits \nand more biscuits as they are full of carbs which helps put on weight. It \nhas worked to a point but they are both pretty active cats and burn it off \npretty easily (one is 4 and the other nearly 12 and the 12 year old is the \nmore playful and energetic!)\n\nHope this is helpful.",

I got rid of my problem (i have like 4+cats and one male cat had the \nsame problem) when i bought 2 extra huge plastic boxes (i think its \n75cm*50cm). it is said that for a cat you would need +1 litter box. aka if \nu have 2 cats, then 3 litter boxes. but in my case the 2 huge ones worked \nvery well. also it can be the litter material itself. the extra clumping \nworks best for my case.\n\nAlso if it wont fix your problem, then i think you should get your cat \nchecked @ the doc, cuz she might have some bladder issues. but i dont think \nthis is the case right now.

When in the new \nplace, put him in/near the litter, or when he finds it, repeat, \"Litter! \nGood boy!\"  Start him in the new place in one small room, laid out nearly \nto what you've got now and gradually expand his territory?  Dealing with \n\"differently abled\" cats is a challenge, but THEY don't seem to know \nthey're \"disabled\" as much as we do!

On a perfectly clean \nfloor, she will dip her paw in the water dish and start to paw the floor \nlike she would as if she was trying to paw away litter when she steps out \nof the box.  She will do this in the kitchen, bathroom, anywhere there's a \nhard floor.  She's even done it after a fresh mop job.  It's gotten to the \npoint where she would do it and the result would be an overturned water \ndish, resulting in another human mop.  Her water dish now resides in the \nbathtub.  Any tips for this one?  ~Shivani and Raj\ufeff",
