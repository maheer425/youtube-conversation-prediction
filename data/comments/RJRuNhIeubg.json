Hate of belief against oneself has been around for as long as \nwritten history, the hate to muslims currently, in my opionion is due to \nthe current violence splashed all over tv which portrays people acting out \nwho are muslim.\nThis happens with all religions, they all have their own extremists, even \nagnostic and athiest have extremists. In the western world it is believed \nwidely that judism & christianity are the dominant religion's (though \nlikely untrue) and due to this supposed popularity, the extremism is not \nsplashed onto tv screens.\nThe fact that at one time Catholics & Christians recieved just as much hate \n(and in some of those times rightly so) has been forgotten.\n\nHate of race, sex, religion is an ever passing fad that make people of link \nminded nature feel superior in their beliefs against others.\n\nFrom my standpoint it is starting to shift again, and some other fad is \nabout to take the role of 'hated' and Muslims will get a reprieve. \n\nThis is merely an opinion btw, I base this on my own beliefs and \nobservations.",
