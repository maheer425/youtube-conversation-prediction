For example, the study does not \ncompare apples to apples but apples to oranges.

In a twisted way, the holocaust wouldn't \nhave happened (or at least not the *way* it happened, backed with Nazi \nideology) if it hadn't been for:\n\nRacism and Anti-Semitism (as old as the hills, or nearly so, but weren't \nconceptualized in the same way prior to the 18th and 19th Centuries); \nHomophobia and the notion of Homosexuality (while there were gay people \nbefore the 19th Century, they were thought of differently, not as a type of \nsexuality - even sexual types being a new concept); Social Darwinism, which \ncame from incorrect notions about Evolutionary Theory, which was one body \nof theories that changed forever how people viewed humanity, and such \ntheories stem from previous theories that stretch in a long line back to \nthe earliest days of the Enlightenment, and the Renaissance that came \nbefore it. Also very important to the Holocaust happening is the influence \nof Nationalism (which led, among other things, to the revolutions of 1848, \nthe unifications of Germany and Italy, and the concept of the nation-state \nas representative of an ethnic group). Nationalism, Capitalism, \nEuro-American Democracy, the concept of natural rights and freedoms of man, \nand the Industrial Revolution (plus the very concept of a Revolution \nitself), are all the children of the Enlightenment. [Plus we must add to \nthe mix the influence of the grandkids of Enlightenment: Marxist-Leninist \nCommunism, Socialism, the Military Industrial Complex (i.e. the arms race \nthat led up to World War I, and kept on rolling forward after that)]. Et \nCetera.\n\nTo put it simply: Without the Enlightenment, the Holocaust might not have \nhappened - but many other great and terrible things that have happened are \ndependent on things that followed before. It's as cogent (and inert) an \nargument as suggesting that the Atomic Bomb was not possble without the \nEnlightenment - well DUH.\n\nSomething that maybe Mrs. Crouse and Ms. Nance would do well to remember is \nthat THEIR BRAND OF CHRISTIAN BELIEFS would not have changed to become what \nthey are today without the influence of the Enlightenment and Modernism. \n(The very idea of Fundamentalist Christian Theology, it could be argued, \nfollows a trend for simplification and stripping away excess that pervades \nModernist art, literature, music, you name it). The idea that the bible is \nto be taken literally at face value is a *modern* concept, NOT an ancient \none at all.",

In this sense, religion is not what binds people together but \nrather what is contemplated or reread - namely myths, founding texts, \nteachings ( = Torah in Hebrew), a body of language (Veda in Sanskrit), a \nbook (biblia in Greek) a reading or recitation (Quran in Arabic), a law \n(dharma in Sanskrit), a set of principles or commandments (the Decalogue in \nthe Old Testament) - in a word, a revelation or tradition that is at once \ntime ancient yet still relevant, accepted, respected, interiorized, both \nindividually and communally.  \n\n     This is where the two possible etymologies can converge: re-reading \nthe same texts, even individually, binds people together.  Etymologically, \nreligions owes less to sociology than to philology.  Religion is the love \nof the Word, the Law or the Book - a love of Logos.\u201d  (pg. 19-20, L'Esprit \nde l\u2019ath\u00e9isme, 2006)",

But please dont deny the nature of your religion. Purely \nbecause of secular reasons christianitys position has changed but the \nreligion itself is unchanged. Humans got more moral then their gods.\n\nBut sure to defend your side. Its great that most christians these days are \nmore moral and better human beings despite of their religion. And specially \nbetter then these fundementalist that thrive on death and despair of what \nthey see as sinfull people. And i'm guessing you and many many christians \nsupport the equal rights for gay people and the secular society where you \ncan have your religion in the privacy of your home/church and head.\n\n+DastardlyMuffins  Actually after jesus the slavery part continues. Thou \nshall honor your masters and not rebel against them. (something like that)\n\n\nIn the end. In whatever way you turn it or redirect this topic. It are \nchristian (american) organisations who are responsible for pushing this \nbill. And the mainly christian country is indoctrinated by religion to this \npoint because of the disgusting stuff missionarys taught them. Dont be \nfooled the message was more about hell and doom and sin then anything else \nas it is the true hart of christianity.\n\nThe things that happen there now are wrong. And i hope some international \nlaw for human rights can do something about it. Gay people are equal as \nhuman beings and deserve the same equal rights. Let them be in love, have \nsex they enjoy, be married and reap the financial benefits like any other \ncouple.

You are \ncorrect that HIV/AIDS is more common among gay men, but it being more \ncommon does not mean everyone who is gay has it you idiot. And it being \nmore common among gays means we should encourage protection and safe sex, \nNot hate and discrimination and even violence.\n4. Your whole.... well I hesitate to call it a point, but lets call it that \nfor this. But yeah the point about reproduction and how the human race can \nnot continue with gays is ridiculous. Do you know why? Because not everyone \nis gay, As a matter of fact most studies suggest 1/10 people are gay (in \nthe closet or not) And gay people actually are giving back to the planet by \nnot being able to procreate, Because our species is growing at an alarming \nrate, Over population is a serious issue, we do not need a larger \npopulation, we need a smaller one. Plus them not being able to have their \nown kids means they adopt, all the unwanted children who otherwise would \ngrow up in the system and most likely have terrible lives.\n5. Religion is the real disease, religion is responsible for countless \natrocities and the murder of millions over the last few thousand years. It \nspreads hate, ignorance, and destruction everywhere it goes, brainwashing \npeople into believing in fairy tales. fairy tales that spread immorality, \nignorance, and hate.",

Also i dont believe in god because it is \nunreasonable that the existance of a magical, invisible, all knowing, all \npowerful god whom there is no undeniable proof of or any proof at all other \nthan a book which has no credibility and is full of contradictions and \nhypocrisy, plus it is hard to agree there is a god when the people who \nbelieve in him can not even agree on the details. Some claim he is just, so \nclaim he is vengeful, some claim he is merciful. And in the bible \nspecificly it claims god said something but then it says god said something \nelse which completely contradicted what he previously said. Which if he \nreally was an all knowing being he would not have had to do because he \nwould already know what is right and wrong and would have no need to change \nhis mind. Also the idea that god exists leads to one undeniable fact if he \ndid.... god created us just to watch us condemn our selves for all \neternity. The reason this is true is because if there was a god then him \nbeing all knowing and all he would have already known that adam and eve \nwould doom all of man kind, meaning god knew that countless millions even \nbillions and maybe one day trillions of people would die and suffer all \nbecause he created adam and eve all the while knowing what they would do \nbut for some reason still punishing them for it and all of us... plus how \nis it at all fair and just that we have to pay for their sins? especially \nsince god planned it like that. So basically the belief god exists means \nyou believe in a sick twisted evil vile creature in the sky who decided to \ncreate an entire species of creatures knowing how much they would suffer \nand pay for something he planned from the beggining because he knew all \nthis would happen and still decided to do create adam and eve and let them \ndamn themselves and all of mankind... what kind of... god... would allow \nthat? A evil, terrible, sick, twisted, abhorrent, sadistic, bastard who \nenjoys the pain of others.... no merciful god would allow an entire race to \nbe doomed to suffer for eternity and have to face death because he created \ntwo people who he ultimatley knew would do exactly what he told them not to \ndo.... how can you punish them for curiosity and defiance when you designed \nthem like that.... so if god does exist he is a sick bastard who should be \nshunned by mankind not revered... if he exists he deserves to burn in his \nown creation of hell for his fucked up atrocities and unspeakable acts.... \nwho know maybe there is some other all knowing and all powerful being who \ncould one day serve justice and destroy him and make him suffer for an \neternity while doing it because unfortunately no punishment humanly \nimaginable is sufficient for gods crimes to us.... his so calle children... \nmore like torture victims for his own sick pleasure. So in short your god \nis a sick twisted motherfucker who hates everyone even you I mean you are \nalready going to hell for judging and condemning other people like gays and \nany who support them. So see you in hell.",

                    "text": "+Myamar Salooki What the hell does that have to do with Catholicism saving \nthe world in the dark ages? They caused it, simple. Because in becoming the \nCatholic Church, the ruling elite of the Roman Empire sewed the seeds for \nthe break down of civilization, since the apparatus of state, was \ndiscarded, and all the mechanism of it along with it. They then ensured was \n'dark' both in terms of the lack of progress, actually, regression, \nin socio-cultural, economic, scientific and technological terms, and \nacademic terms of little evidence, historical and archeological, from that \ntime... by ruthlessly suppressing any and all thought which challenged \ntheir doctrines, and power through it, and control those things such as \neducation and funding.\n\nThe rise of Protestantism ended this. The rise of secret societies of \nscience, ended this... well in fact, the latter came first... the rise of \nPhilosophy and especially 'Mechanicalist Philosophy'.. AKA \nScience.. especially Physics and Astronomy ended this...arrival of Arabic \nMathematics, through Algorithmi,  ended this... as the power of the 'New \nDivine Empire' was diluted.\n\nBut don't talk to me about precious Protestants.. I am not Christian nor \nreligious, I am educated and intelligent, and thus an Atheist... \nProtestantism only managed to gain ANY traction because of powerful 'New \nGuard' Elites... the Monarchies, their Royal Houses and High Nobility, who \nwanted to freedom from the Power of the Divine Empire... so backed \nreformist Christian Philosophy, because if successful, it would allow them \nexpanded power.\n\nNo longer would they need answer to Rome, no longer would the Pope and the \necclesiastical hierarchy of Catholicism be above them... THEY WOULD BE in \nDIRECT COMMUNE with GOD.. ruling by the DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS... they could \nseek to mutate in a hybrid, both as an Earthy Kingdom over their subjects \nand domain, and Divine One ruling by 'Will and Right of God'.\n\nA side note... however Democratic, the world today as we know it, is still \nruled by these two classes of men and their Asian counterparts... \noccasionally some women. In the era of Empire.. a bunch of 'New Money' and \nEducated folk... took to challenging this... played a close game of cards \nto get money and accrue wealth, placed pawns in parliaments after using \nlesser nobility and merchant nobility to be their weapons to curb Royal and \nNoble powers... not for the people, but for them... and got power \ntoo...others watched... and learnt.. and saw a chance for repeating in the \nNew World... see Rothschilds and Rockefellas and the like.\n\nSo now today we have essentially three groups controlling the world. The \nOld Imperial Dynasties... AKA Catholic Church.. the New Royal House... AKA \nMonarchies and Landed Nobility of Europe and Asia.. and things like the \nJapanese mega-corps which come Zaibatsu, which in turn just grew from \nSamurai wealth making operations and businesses already in existence which \nafter the end of the Caste Japan, and curbing of Samurai and Shogunnate \npowers, became their focus of efforts for socio-economic power...  and the \nNew World Order... correctly so named because they were NEW.. and many \ngained power through fertile virgin society of the new world, where they \ndidn't have to challenge the previous two classes for their control. \nRothschilds, Krupps, Rockefellas (I could give you a few Chinese, Japanese, \nThai and Indian examples too though not sure you'd have heard of them).\n\nThese three groups vie for power and control the world and the agenda of \nit. Because they control money, they invented the debt based credit based \neconomy, they put a price on everything... even Democracy.\n\nSo I have no love for these people... doesn't change Catholicism CAUSED the \nDark Ages.",

                    "text": "+Myamar Salooki Right, homosexuals HAVE 'infiltrated' the Roman \nCatholic Church clergy, that's true.. but they where also Christians. \nCatholics, who where born homosexual like all born so, perhaps not Born \nCatholic, but certainly stepped in Catholicism, you need to be to gain \nadmittance to the Seminary. They didn't want to destroy what they were part \nof. They served it lovingly. Pedophilia and Homosexuality are no \ninterchangeable terms.\n\nPedophiles may have infiltrated the church, like they have many power \nstructures, because it offered both protection.. and you are deluded if you \nthink it hasn't offered that... and access to children.. but there is also \nevidence that the molesters in Cassocks turned to such, because Abstinence \nis unnatural and leads to a point where it must be unleashed.\n\nThis is a massive sin, so the mind fuck of it all leads to an \ndysfunctional, perverted development of sexual psychology, which is \ncompounded by their vows, and the concepts of 'Evil' associated with \nbreaking them.\n\nThese men are completely indoctrinated in to the delusion of Christ and \nGod, and the eternal paradise or damnation which rides upon their choices, \nso firstly cannot leave the Church, and believe they honestly face their \nsouls damnation if they do, feel like they are abandoning their God, their \nflock, and their soul... but also.. cant even begin to try to approach \nillicit affairs with competent adults, lest they be found out and lose it \nall.. so chose to keep their sins between they and God, by targeting the \nmost easily manipulated and enthralled of their spiritual charges, and most \neasily silenced and controlled, CHILDREN.\n\nYou have absolutely no idea about what you're speaking about.\n\nAs for the Dark Ages.. SORRY.. NO.. Monotheism, or conversion there to, \nspecifically Roman Catholicism, KILLED ROME.. as an Empire, because IT WAS \nROME, the Emperor made Christianity HIS.. and that apparatus, then \nsuccessfully consolidated it's power, after killing off it's old worldly, \nearthly body... and metamorphosized in to Heavenly, Divinely Ordained, one.\n\nAt which point it down scaled in to an Elite.. which controlled the people \nthrough GOD. Not Centurions, and vast body politic, bureaucracy, judiciary \neconomy and system of Slavery. The powerful elites of the Empire, the \nImperial and Noble families, coalesced in to the Catholic Church. They \ncould have ONE priest in the villages, instead of a Garrison. One Bishop in \na region, with small retinue, instead of Governor and division of troops, \nand three dozen bureaucratic staff assigned to him.\n\nTHEY COULD GET PEOPLE TO TITHE... AKA.. PAY.. BE TAXED.. for SALVATION.. \nNOT SERVICES...and these people would come to THEM.\n\nThey could affect change and effect peoples mass moral consciousness, by \nthe power of Divine Authority, and punishment or boons for their ETERNAL \nSOUL.\n\nALL ANSWERS TO ALL QUESTIONS COULD BE ANSWERED BY IT BEING GODS DIVINE WILL \nAND PLAN.\n\nSo what then? Why spend millions of dollars worth of Gold and resources on \nan Army, or builder, trades people, bureaucracy, infrastructure, you don't \nneed?\n\n The secular Nobility and Royalty.. petty chieftains who became \nDynasties, who filled the void as earthly authority, the tribes powerful \nenough to rise to the top of the power struggles claim land and authority, \nbacked up by your endorsement.. would see to productivity and economies, \nand give you gold, they would through Feudalism, supply you with all the \nArmies you needed... not even that.. THEY WOULD FIGHT YOUR WARS  FOR YOU IN \nTHE NAME OF GOD.\n\nThe same systems would still produce tradesmen, and artisans, and famers \nand merchants, and lawyers, and healers and builders and accountants and \nmathematicians and scientists and philosophers and engineers... the \ncream of which would learn from YOUR educational institutions, would speak \nLATIN, and be thoroughly indoctrinated in to your CULT.  Then be thoroughly \nat your disposal for your own demesne, because of faith, and the copious \namounts of wealth you didn't even have to be unpopular to gain (which was \nliterally brought forward and given to you with joy), that you could lavish \nupon them in sponsorship.\n\nSo why maintain the worthless money sucking elements of Empire... when you \nnow had an Empire of Souls? Others would convert, through conversion, you \ngained more tithes and wealth, and DIDNT NEED to conquer, DIDNT NEED to \nserve your society and develop on in socio-economic, technological and \nscientific progress, from your Hellenistic roots, people would convert with \nor without flush toilets, sewage and running water, with or without \nconstabulary, armies, theatres, coloseums, games, work, welfare, without \nscientific understanding, and advancement, and technological, without \neducation and opportunities, without some degree of democracy... they would \nsign up, and pay, just for the sake of their souls.\n\nSo why spend the money and run the risk, leave that to the Kings and Dukes \nand feudal system and how much it would or wouldn't allow such to \ndevelop... SO LONG AS IT DIDNT VIOLATE YOUR DOCTRINES>.. AND AUTHORITY.\n\nAll you have to do then, is ruthlessly repress all threats to your power, \nall questions, destroy all knowledge which is inconsistent with your power, \nand people too... and BOOM.\n\nYou are essentially the next best thing to Gods... you're the Avatars of \nGods on Earth.\n\n\nSO YES... the CATHOLIC CHURCH MOST CERTAINLY DID CAUSE the DARK AGES... and \nTHE FALL OF ROME YOU BLAME IT ON.\n\nEnd of story.\n ",

Political \ncorrectness depends on whatever interest group has political power.  When \nimmoral interest groups gain too much political power, they gain the \n\"freedom\" to attack morality.  They gain the \"freedom\" to take away the \nother people's freedom to act moral.\n\nAnother problem with the liberal West is their perversion of the concept of \nequality.  The liberal West has now perverted the concept of equality as \nmeaning that all cultures have to be \"equal\".  A culture that amputates \nlimbs for petty offenses now has to be \"equal\" to a culture where people \nlove their neighbors and forgive their enemies.  Satanists, pagans, and \nwitches have to be \"equal\" to Jews and Christians.  In the case of the LGBT \nmovement, morality must now be \"equal\" to immorality.\n\nIt seems to me that in countries that are less liberal, like Russia and \nUganda, the government has the power to disregard political correctness and \nact in the interest of public welfare.  Most African countries are less \nliberal than the Untied States, Canada, and Britain.  They do not allow \nobscene lewd Gay Pride Parades.  The same is probably true of Eastern \nEuropean countries.\n\nI hate to play devil's advocate, but one benefit to dictatorships is that \nthey can act in the interest of public welfare, without regard for \npolitical correctness.

In addition, Malaysia, Egypt and \nPakistan have laws within their penal codes prohibiting homosexuality, as \ndoes the Indonesian province of Aceh. After the Iraq War the allies \nreintroduced the pre-1963 constitution in Iraq, but there are, as Iraq \nmoves towards total post occupation autonomy to reintroduce the \nConstitution of 2001, which prescribes the Death Penalty for Homosexuality.\n\n\nBUT...   these countries also have a myriad of other crimes deemed crimes \nagainst Islamic Law, for which prison, or capital punishment is prescribed \nfor violation...  ( Witchcraft is still a capital crime in Saudi Arabia for \nexample, and over 20 people have been put to death for it in the last 12 \nyrs... and Adultery is punished by Stoning to death in Afghanistan)  ...and \nthe fervor and brutality of which they are pursued is much less than Uganda \nand Russia, it seen as shame, and sin, and to some degree.. a tragedy these \npeople couldn't be ardent Muslims. Even then, even within the \nintelligentsia of these nations, the religious and political and tribal \noligarchs... there is dissent as to if these laws are actually Sharia, case \nin point the Iranian Govt. 'Sex Change' laws.

I will try to \nfind you his name, he was interviewed by a reporter for the ABC here in \nAustralia, after the Taliban blew up the Buddhist statues. In all these \ncountries, there are also caveat, and loopholes specifically left in the \nlegislation to allow some degree of leniency.\n\n\nIn Uganda, and Russia to lesser extent, the laws and discrimination against \nHomosexuality, are championed by the Government, there's a move to increase \ntheir severity, even now, some Politicians in Uganda want the death penalty \nelement of their legislation to be reintroduced, and there have been \nactual efforts to whip up the masses to actively practice acts of \ndiscrimination or repression against the LGBT community.\n\nTHIS is what makes it so much worse.. this is mass hysterical orgia, \nencouraged by the Government in hand with ignorant subhuman masses... and \nyes, any who go along with it ARE INHUMAN!... to completely repress and \ncrush, and ultimately, extinguish homosexuality from their cultures.

How \nterrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison.  To-day, \nafter two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly \nthan ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His \nblood upon the Cross.  As a Christian I have no duty to allow my self to be \ncheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice\u2026  And if \nthere is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is \nthe distress that daily grows .

Serve them \nsincerely as you would serve Christ\"  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT).\n \"Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that \nthe name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a \nChristian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all \nthe harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach \nthese truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them\"  (1 Timothy \n6:1-2 NLT).\n\nRape in the bible:\n\"If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, \nhe must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the \nyoung woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to \ndivorce her\" (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT).\n\"If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has \nrelations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city \nand there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for \nhelp though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his \nneighbors wife\" (Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB).\n\nMurder in the Bible:\nKill women who are not virgins on their wedding night.\nKill fortune tellers \" A man or a woman who acts as a medium or \nfortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but \nthemselves to blame for their death\" (Leviticus 20:27 NAB).\nKill gay people who have sex.\nKill children who curse their parents. \"All who curse their father or \nmother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense\" \n(Leviticus 20:9 NLT).\n Stone to death adulterers.\nStone to death fornicators (those who have sex without being married).\nKill Witches \"You should not let a sorceress live\" (Exodus 22:17 NAB).\nAnd on and on and on.

They try to equate homosexuality \nwith not just pedophilia, incest, polygamy and such, but they also try to \nreduce the entire lives of gay people to anal sex and poop eating so that \nthey can justify their homophobia and heterosexual supremacy. They are \nhoping that if they make gay people seem so dirty and disgusting in our \nminds, we would also hate gay people the same way they hate gay people. \nIt's not working any longer at least here in the West since gay people can \nbe out of the closet and live openly. People know too many gay people and \ncouples to believe all the negative stereotypes we hear from heterosexual \nsupremacists. Gay people don't eat poop anymore than heterosexuals because \nit is unhealthy and they would all be dead if they did. Like I said, the \nhomophobes go online and search out the most extreme and tiny fetish of \npoop play and claim that somehow, that represents ALL gay couples. They \ndon't do the same with heterosexual and female homosexual porn which also \nhave these same extreme fetish videos. They know full well that people who \nwatch porn know that most of the time, what they are seeing is not real. \nThese homophobes are trying to justify their hatred of gay men that is \nalready present within them.\n\nThe facts are clear: More heterosexuals engage in anal sex and there is \nnothing wrong with 2 consenting adults doing what they want. More \nheterosexuals engage in oral sex as well because there is simply more of \nthem. As far as incest and polygamy, almost exclusively all, if not all, \nincestuous and polygamous marriages to date have been heterosexual in \nnature- not homosexual in nature- so if you are against incest and \npolygamy, go after the heterosexuals who practice it.

The fact is that he is a liar. He went to the internet and \nsearched for the most extreme and fetish gay porn and claimed that that is \nwhat ALL gay couples do in their bedrooms. And he is a hypocrite as \nwell because there is heterosexual porn and female homosexual porn that has \nthe same activities that he was attributing to ALL gay men. I doubt he \nwould pull up a heterosexual fetish porn where there is poop play and claim \nthat somehow that is what ALL heterosexuals do in their bedrooms like he \ndid with the extreme fetish gay porn that no sensible person lives by. The \nfact of the matter is that they just hate gay men and they are grasping at \nstraws trying to find reasons to justify their homophobia against \nmale homosexuality. ",
