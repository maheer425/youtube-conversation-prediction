To just turn around and ban them would work about as well as our \nattempt to ban booze. Blackmarket gun sales would skyrocket. They already \nsell illegal firearms, after all. Making all of them illegal just adds \ninventory.\n\nIt would take a gradual progression of stricter gun laws to make the \nbanning of private firearms feasiable. Each new law would need a cooling \nperiod to keep the \"you'll take mah guns when ya pry'em from mah cold dead \nhand\" types from getting too angry. We got enough wackos forming militia \nout there in deluded preperation of government storm troopers coming to \nsteal their guns...\ufeff",

Not long after \nSandy Hook Obama and his inner circle tried to justify more gun control and \nsaid introducing more guns to a shoot out just makes it worse and then said \nthat the Syrian rebels needed more guns from the US to fight Assad. How \ncome Russia or China or any of the former communist bloc nations never \nfaced sanctions for all the surplus military hardware they flooded the \nthird world with?

That was committed with illegally supplied Soviet pattern \nsmall arms, illegally supplied mortars from the United Nations, and of \ncourse shovels, axes, clubs, machetes, and other blunt and edged weapons. \nThe victims of the Rwandan genocide were previously disarmed under laws \nthat deliberately signaled them out as racially inferior and a threat to \nthe government.

So it is in fact Allah\\'s own words that are in Koran, and Koran \nis full of peaceful teachings, I know this because I am a follower of Koran \nand I read it like 15 times a day, so I know it well.

Not to mention many of \nthe foods we eat contain all kinds of weird chemicals that most of us \ncouldn't pronounce. If the government can crush us that easily, why do they \nseem so intent on taking firearms away from law abiding citizens? If \nsomeone doesn't want to own a gun, whatever, they can just not buy one. But \ndon't expect us to conform to your ideology or your lifestyle. The vast \nmajority of gun owners such as myself simply own them because we like \ntarget shooting, shooting competitions, plinking tin cans, stuff like that. \nThe great thing about a gun though is that we can defend ourselves from \ncriminals more effectively than using knives, mace, or common household \nobjects. The only knives we can legally carry are 3 inch folding knives. \nWhat's so intimidating about that? That means we have to get in even closer \nto our assailant in order to take him out. The guy could be wacked out of \nhis mind on drugs for all we know. Most of the time when a gun is pulled \nout in a self defense situation, the other guy runs away. Now, does that \nmean that you should pull out a gun during a fist fight? No, not \nnecessarily, unless he plans on beating you to death with his fists. If \nit's just a fist fight like the typical ones you see in schools and \nwhatnot, then you don't need to. Now you might talk about accidental \nshootings, well that can be addressed accordingly with proper training and \ntrigger discipline. Also, when your gun is not in use and/or has no \nbusiness being out in the open, unload it, put it in a safe and lock it up. \nEspecially if you have children. But if you like your hobby enough that you \ndon't want to quit it, be sure to lock any and all firearms in a safe along \nwith the ammunition. Be sure to give your children the training and \ndiscipline that they need in order to operate a firearm once they are \nmature enough. That way they'll know what it is, what it looks like, and \nwhat it can do if it is misused. And if you raise you kids right with good \nmorals and values and that you really are 100% sure that they are of sound \nmind, you won't end up with the next Adam Lanza. Which was clearly a case \nof extreme irresponsibility on the mother's part.",

                    "text": "+CrypticHeaven Hence my Turk example.. I have never had any reason to hate \nor like the Turks, hence how I react. There is no negative or positive, \nracial bias in that. The reason why I brought up bias was not only because \nof your misconception of the definition of racism, but because a sheltered \nman who has mainly seen white people all his life wont necessarily be, \nunder your definition, racist.  Unless you develop a negative bias against \na specific race, you have no reason to react differently to that race \nsimply because they're different.\n\nHistory is a good example of this. The Roman Empire cared only if you were \nRoman. They didn't care about race at all. In fact, an Arab, Philip the \nArab, was able to rise to the rank of Praetorian Prefect (leader of the \nguard, basically), and eventually, Roman Emperor. There were multiple Popes \nborn in Africa, such as Pope Gelasius I. A more modern example would be the \nvarious terrorist groups in the Middle East, like ISIS. They don't care \nabout your race, they care about your beliefs. Despite their extremism, \nthey aren't racist.\n\nThe thing is, racism exists because of stereotypes, and bias. When neither \nis present against a different race, then how could everyone be racist? \nJudging people is natural, everyone does it. However, people judge with \nreason. If they have no other reason to judge, other than that someone \nlooks different, they usually wont judge. Racism wasn't even that common \nthroughout history. It became common with the start of the slave trade in \nAfrica as people needed a reason, especially as Christians to justify what \nthey're doing. Even with the mistreatment of the Native Americans, the \nfocus was less on their red skin and more on how \"uncivilized\" they were \ncompared to Europeans.\n\nA lot of what you were describing reminds me of the U.S. It's important to \nremember that Americans don't represent the world...While the American \nmedia and people like to put emphasis on race when such emphasis shouldn't \nexist, not every country does.

This is likely due to the fact that racism & stereotypes often \ngo hand in hand. Nowadays, the term can be applied to any person making a \ncomment regarding race. Nonetheless, my point can be inferred and stands. \nPeople selflessly let race hinder their decisions & perception whether they \ndo this consciously or unconsciously, & most people would refer to this \ntype of bias as racism, whether it's the correct term or not.",

No one \nsaid you can't be racist. You were just mocked for being racist. \n\nRacism is defined by www.oxforddictionaries.com as, \"the belief that all \nmembers of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that \nrace, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another \nrace or races.\" Saying that everyone is racist is simply untrue. A more \ncorrect statement would be that everyone judges others based on their own \nexperiences, including media or just simple life experiences. It's called \nstereotyping, and bias, not simply racism.. The same is done with rednecks, \nthe British, the Finnish, the Americans.. It is something that is done with \neveryone.\n\nDo you know what racism even is? I have never throughout my life believed \nthat your race defined how you are. What are your opinions about the Turks \nof Turkey? Do you hate them, like them, or don't care at all? They aren't \neven a race, yet are considered by many, mainly those effected by them in \nhistory like the Greeks and the Armenians, to be evil. I have never met a \nTurk ever, in my life. If I met one, knowing that they're a Turk, I may be \ninterested in their nationality, however I would not judge them negatively \nbecause of their origins. Would you?\n\nBasically, you have no idea what you're talking about. Assuming that quote \nrepresents your own beliefs, you confuse insults with forbiddance, and \njudging with racism. I'm sorry if I sounded rude, as my intent isn't to \nbelittle you. I'd just like you to think about what you're saying before \nyou say it, or in this case, quote it. ",

Some \n40% is homocide, and remember that this is mostly violence found in black \nand hispanic neighborhoods, not white. Guns are also an important part of \nAmerican culture. We are a cowboy culture, after all. Guns to us are like \nswords to old Europe, and there is pride in owning a good gun. Besides, \nfiring a gun at the firing range is one of the most exhilarating feelings \nabove the belt.",

While that body stays benevolent, weapons of all kinds, \nincluding and beyond guns, merely exist as hypothetical insurance. \n However, people are people.  Eventually someone wants power and \nmanipulates the system to gain enough to challenge the existing order.  You \ncan look at virtually every nation that has existed for evidence of that. \n Rome is a great example of a limited democratic republic that devolved \ninto a mob-ruled democracy that then welcomed a strong leader to give them \nsecurity and order, converting it into a despotism.  England was a \ntumultuous country for centuries where the crown, the nobles, and the \npeople were constantly at odds until the nobles basically lost their \neconomic purpose during the industrial revolution.  At that point, it \nstarted gelling into the system that exists now out of necessity for \nstability.  Nothing is saying that existence is permanent.  France was \nsimilar, though more bloody because the mobs succeeded in outright \noverthrowing the existing system.  America had an incident during the civil \nwar that ended up changing many fundamentals of the nation, both good and \nbad, but America is so young compared to anyone else, its history is not \nthe best gauge.  Guns don't fix day to day problems.  They, like all \nweapons, simply give the power to change things.  The one that has the \nweapons has the power to enforce their will.  If it is a balancing system, \nas America was intended, where both the people and the government has their \nown types of access to weapons and the people can declaw a rogue government \nby refusing to fight for it and defending against its agents that do, then, \nin theory rogue governments can be put down with minimal loss.  In \npractice, though, it is always more complicated.  Especially when people go \nrogue themselves and have to be put down by the government and people \nexpect the government to fix it.",
