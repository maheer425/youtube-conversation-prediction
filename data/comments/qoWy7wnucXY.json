He's actually protecting the constitution \nthat American citizens shouldn't be killed by a drone (or whatever) on \nAmerican soil without a trial. AG Eric Holder and President Obama believes \notherwise. \n\nPresident Obama is a completely different person from 2007. He either lied \nto us for the majority of things he \"stood for,\" or he's totally changed. I \nhappen to believe the former.\n\nRemember, Obama was supposedly against warrant-less wiretapping and the \nsupport of indefinite detentions for U.S. and non-citizens by the military. \nWell, that never changed. \n\nIf you don't agree with this Rand Paul position, then you're clearly not a \ntrue liberal or progressive. You're not principled. \ufeff",

Absolutely not.  So the basis for asserting that Obama needs to come \nout and say anything is somewhat tenuous.  And Attorney General Eric Holder \ndid in fact state that it would require an \"extraordinary circumstance\" for \nsuch an option to be considered and that they could not rule it out should \nsuch \"extraordinary circumstances\" present themselves; however he also made \nclear that \"The United State government has not carried out drone strikes \nin the United States and has no intention of doing so.\"  Attorney General \nHolder's letter (if you care to read it it's below and makes Rand Paul's \nentire grandstand look even more foolish than it already does) makes clear \nthat it would require an extraordinary situation, like 9/11 or the attack \non Pearl Harbor, for the President to use lethal force against an American \ncitizen on American soil without using the criminal justice system which, \nAG Holder also points out, has been successfully used hundreds of times to \nconvict and prosecute terrorist criminals.\nhttp://paul.senate.gov/files/documents/BrennanHolderResponse.pdf\nIn sum, the entire filibuster was typical partisan nonsense and a waste of \nthe American taxpayer's dollars.  If Rand Paul wants to help protect \nAmericans, he should, to borrow the phrase of his fellow party member \nSpeaker Boehner, \"get off his ass\" and get to work helping to come up with \nreasonable, bi-partisan solutions for the unemployment problem and not \nmake up issues which are delusional at best.",

As for surveillance  we're all \nunder surveillance thanks to the Patriot Act & laws passed since 9/11.\n\nThe reality of the situation is we, as citizens, have no real rights  of \nprivacy once we step out the front door.

Where's the Congressional outrage against that? Why hasn't that been \ndeemed a gross breach of our constitutional rights, worthy of theatrical \nfilibusters? Because we've grown accustomed to the idea that while it \nshould always be questioned and investigated, *sometimes it's justified*. \nPerhaps not everybody agrees with this, but it is the status quo in the \ncountry today.\n\nThe only difference here is that we're talking about law enforcement using \na remote-controlled weapon instead of a handheld weapon. With drones in the \npicture, suddenly we have nightmares of soul-less assassin machines roaming \nour countrysides and city-scapes silently picking off undesirables. While \nnobody wants that to happen, nobody (in law enforcement or otherwise) is \nsuggesting that *should* happen.\n\nThe conversation should definitely be had, that's a given.

He cannot, in his capacity as AG speak to the moral question. \n Again, not defending the policy AT ALL, but I think we need to be careful \nhow we characterize people in this.  Focus on the legal question and \nfighting it on Constitutional grounds and keep the character assassinations \nout of it.  This policy existed prior to the Obama administration.",
