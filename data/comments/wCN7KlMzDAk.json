A Cayman \nGTS can hit 60 in 4.3s (claimed), but probably 4.1s in reality.  The Cayman \nGTS is down only 15 lb-ft of torque, and can still hit 175mph.  The amount \nof power will feel rather similar, though the Cayman will feel nimbler due \nto a lower curb weight, less body roll (especially with the X73 sport \nsuspension), being mid-engined (43/57 F/R weight distribution), and with a \nshorter wheelbase.  You also get the engine and intakes right behind your \nhead.\n\nHonestly, go drive a Cayman S (or GTS in 1-2 months).  Only then will you \nsee if it's worth it.  After driving a Cayman S last year, I put a deposit \non an order for the GTS a week ago. Shows up in June. Can't wait.",
