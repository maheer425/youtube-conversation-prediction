Hot \nchocolate powered and milo powder are not the same. However you can leave \nit out all together and just add the amount in flour instead. It won't \ntaste like red velvet but it will be a nice red cake. Hope this helps :)",

If you go back and look \nthis is what you'll see\n\n6 tablespoons (50g/ 1 3/4 oz) self-rising flour ( to make SF flour add 2 \ntsp of baking powder to 150g/6oz/1 cup plain flour)\n\nThe measurement is for 6 tablespoons, not 1 cup. The 1 cup was to make \nthe self raising flour. It's all written there.\nIf you try it again following the recipe it will work :)",

Also how much \nflour are you using? \nHonestly I think something might have happened by 1/2 the recipe. They are \nonly small so I would just to the 2. Mix it in a bowl and then pour it into \n2 mugs. \nLook over the recipe and see if you halted it correctly, I make mistakes \nwith halting recipes all the time :)",

So I might of \nadded a little to much or little. Im not sure what wattage is my microwave, \nevery time I try to ask my mom she's busy, then i forget about it. I cooked \nit for 50 seconds like you said. I don't have unsalted butter and something \nelse, vanilla extract, I only had Imitation Vanilla Extract. First timed it \nspilled, second time it almost did, and last time it kinda worked but it \nwas not how yours looked. Mine was crumbly kinda feels like a cake. I \ntasted it and it tasted to much like vanilla extract. I couldn't bare it so \nI threw it away, but I am looking forward to trying another one, i didn't \nhave sprinkles so.. i might try the oreo one.",

Anyways, I was out \nof a couple ingredients so I had to ad-lib a little. I used Bisquick in \nplace of flower and water in place of milk and do you know what? They came \nout very moist and tasty! I had to cook them for about 2 minutes in my \nmicrowave...not sure how many watts it is...but it was perfect for 2 mugs. \nThanks again for sharing all these yummy treats! I'll be back for more! :)",
