But thats besides the point. \nThe most amazing part was that the kid who sounded younger picked invoker \nand was actually playing really good, at least better than most invokers \nI've seen before. He got a couple of wicked sick sprees against a \nsurprisingly good for LP enemy team. So the cursing stopped at around 7 \nminutes into the game and everything was quite after that.
