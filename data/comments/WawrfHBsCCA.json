And if you don't have a great immune \nsystem, you're likely going to catch a lot of colds and a flu or two when \nyou arrive there within the first month or two-- you'll probably keep \nadjusting for the next 3-5 months. Fish and rice are probably the main two \nfoods eaten there, and anything imported from your country is going to be \nalmost un-purchasable for how much money it'll cost. I'm just telling you \nright now.\n\nIf you move to a city, it wont be so bad, but living out in the country, \nyou'd probably be an anomaly if you don't have close blood-related Asian \nancestry(a grandmother or parent, for instance). So, be comfortable with \nstares and questions. Though, honestly, this can happen anywhere if you \nlook a lot different than the natives.\n\nStrong work ethic, too. Don't be lazy. And they still treat people as \nweirdo's if they're obsessive about anime or manga like it \"too\" much. Just \nlike most of your peers probably do. Anime makes it look idyllic, but \nhonestly, make sure you do your research before you plan to move to a \ndifferent country with very different laws, social rules/etiquette, and \nculture.

God knows how many \nchanges they make to the lyrics of disney songs. Or how many pop culture \nreferences they remove/alter. But you know what, just because the lyrics of \na song are slightly different, or a joke is dropped or altered, doesn't \naffect the plot in any significant way.\n\nthis brings us to your point about missing plotlines. which is flat out \nwrong on like 90% of all english dubbed works (the 10% being 4kids and \npre-90s dubs). Most legit dubbing companies try to stay as close as they \ncan to the source material as possible rarely leaving anything out. The \ndialogue may not be word for word, but as I said earlier, the meaning is \nkept the same and the plot is not altered in any significant way. Hell, \nsometimes, even subtitles aren't always the exact same depending on who's \ndoing the translating.\n\nThere are numerous anime that have well done english voice casts (Hellsing, \nBaccano, FMA, and Black Lagoon just to name a few) I would even go so far \nas to say that numerous dubs have surpassed their sub counterparts.  If you \nprefer the sub version over the dub, that's fine, I'm completely okay with \nthat. But to declare ALL english dub works as \"inferior\" to their sub \ncounterparts simply due to  them not being in the original language or due \nto missing out on a few word puns is completely asinine.",

Sometimes with some anime I feel as if the English is soooo much \nfunnier than the Japanese, but with a show like Attack on Titan, everything \nsounds WAY too Americanized where the story that takes place doesn't exist \nas dubbed. The Japanese voice actors convey a LOT more emotion than the \nEnglish voice actors, so I end up feeling a sense of empowerment and all \nthe emotion that is originally conveyed. With the English, I feel it is \nlost within the translations. With the Japanese I feel as if I could \nconnect with the characters every time I'd watch something from it. I \nrewatched most of the series in English and felt myself getting annoyed as \nI found the characters' English voices being annoying and non-fitting to \nthe character.\n\nBut anywho, to each his own. If you're not a fan for subbed I'd say go for \ndubbed, but if you don't care like me then you should definitely go for \ndubbed. It's all the matter of your opinion and that's what counts!",

To \nanswer your last question, you can't just judge a country by what you \ngenerally hear about it or see from it. Believe it or not, Japan is a \ncountry that is much more dedicated to education that most countries. \nThat's one of the reasons why most Japanese people are smart or at least \ncapable of thinking in ways that are different from how others would \ngenerally think.

Live-action shows is just the popular medium here, as anime \nis in Japan. +Blo0dredRidingHo0d is right, yeah. I just wanted to give the \nmore detailed explanation XD Like, there *are* specific genres to separate \nthe anime (and manga). \"Shoujo,\" means \"young girl,\" and therefore the \ndemographic is for younger females. Conversely, \"shounen,\" means \"young \nboy,\" and the demographic is younger males. \"Josei\" and \"Seinen\" are then \nolder female and older male, respectively. Yeap :v",

His mother being \nimportant, because it was her reluctance to tell her mooch sister to go die \nin a ditch that ended up working her to death, just like Kaneki's \nreluctance to give his all against Jason directly resulted in the deaths of \nthe 2 ghouls.\n\n(Not to mention all the torture Jason had done to him had dulled his \nability to feel pain and given him a thorough understand of what his body \ncould actually take and used that to his advantage in his fight. Of course \nit helped that Rize was simply a stronger ghoul then Jason (though both \nwere rated as S class), so Kaneki already had an advantage in terms of raw \npower and finally had the resolve to use that strength without reservation).\n\nBiting Jason had zero to do with the fight (aside for causing him to freak \nout because he didn't think that the, up to that point, mentally broken \nKaneki had any fight left in him), until the end where he literally ate on \nof his Kakuhou to stop his regeneration.",

My recomendations for \nyou would be:\nEureka Seven - a bit long mecha/action/romance\nMirai Nikki - a bit strange it has plenty of brutality and it's fantasy\nGintama - I don't think you would enjoy it now, but maybe after you watched \nsome more animes. It's a very funny comedy but at the same time it has some \nepic battles and is pretty serious at some points. It has small arcs and no \nfourth wall whatsoever they just break it at the start and leave it like \nthat :D.\nSoul Eater - comedy and cool battles\nDurarara!! - it's pretty random at times it has some fantasy and it's a \nmystery\nIf you want more info about an anime you can look it up in MAL. Also you \ncan find new animes there, it's pretty usefull if don't know it already.",

I won't go into to much detail, but basically one person every month \ndies. This doesn't happen every year because they found a way to stop it. \nThey realised that the cause of this was when there was an extra person in \nthe class (This isn't the main character, it is someone who died but \ndoesn't know it. Just accept the fact that they are dead). The way to stop \nis is to pretend that someone in the class doesn't exist, they chose Mei. \nMei Misaki lost her eye to a tumour when she was 4. Her mother said that \nfake eyes are ugly, so she gave her a dolls eye. For supernatural reasons \nthat add more plot to the show further on, she can see things that no one \nelse can through this dolls eye. So she keeps it patched up mostly.",

I can't for the life of me understand why people care \nso much about sub vs dub; as long as an accurate representation of what's \nsupposed to be going on is displayed, I really don't mind. Attack on \nTitan's dub is fairly true to the original, that's what really matters. \nAnd if we really wanna throw a hissy fit about which one is the \"original\", \nneither subs nor dubs are exactly the original experience. The original \nexperience would be knowing the Japanese language and watching it with no \nsubtitles. In fact, some may argue that taking in the visuals completely \nwithout averting attention to subtitles by watching a dub is closer to the \ntrue experience, but I don't know if I'd personally go that direction \nbecause, if both subs and dubs are well done, they're both equal in my \neyes. Maybe I'm just saying this because I've just recently started getting \ninto anime, but... I really don't see what the big deal is. Just let people \nchoose what they want to watch. If a sub-watcher can have a proper \nconversation with a dub-watcher regarding the show's plot, then I'd say the \ndubbers and subbers did their job just fine.",

Fairy Tail's dub isn't horrible, and Gankutsou the \nCount of Monte Cristo has a really good dub too(granted the sub's better, \nbut mainly because of the french intro). Code Geass is overall really good \ntoo(not really diggin' Johnny as Lelouch though).\n\nAnd my prime example is Death note, where I find L's voice to be absolutely \nperfect. Most of the others I'm indifferent too, but with L there is no \nargument. The sub is taking him too serious a lot of the time. And for \nsomeone like L that's weird. Not that they're doing a bad job. I just think \nthat the dub is actually doing a better job. ",

I \nsay it in capitals for everyone who will accentuate on what I just said and \ntry to opose me with \"The titans don't have human proportions\". Now when \nsomeone bases a cartoon on the story of a manga, IT IS STILL MANGA, just \nanimated.

A more well known example would be the Fullmetal Alchemist series, \nwhere the Japanese voices didn't sound like what I expected them \nto*cough*I'm looking at you, Edward*cough*.

This is not the USA. This is not the UK or Australia or \nwherever you are. This is the internet. Heck, I am in France but that does \nnot mean squat on here, because even an American told me here on youtube \n\"well this is America, welcome to America\". Um no, it is not. I am not in \nAmerica nor am I about to enter it. And I am an American btw\n\nWords have their meaning for a reason. Otaku is a JAPANESE term. If you \nwant to give it your own definition, you do so using another word no one \nelse used before.\nIt's like if Japanese people started using the N-word and say \"oh well this \nisn't America so it's fine it's not an insult\" NO IT IS NOT TRUE.\n\nThe N-word has the same meaning ANYWHERE. Otaku has the same meaning \nEVERYWHERE. It's a derogatory term, used to define people that are usually \nshut-ins, socially awkward, or anti-social. Otaku does NOT mean \"anime fan\" \nor whatever unofficial definition whoever gave it.\n\nEven the Urban dictionary definition for Otaku mentions how westerners \nconfuse it for a positive word \nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=otaku\nIt irks me to see people misuse a word that's not even native to your own \nlanguage. Research a foreign word before using it..\n\nAnyways this is it. I'm done, I wrote this beautiful essay that would make \neven an English teacher proud even if it's not 100% correct grammatically. \nFeel free to hate, ignore, comment, love, etc. I think argument is won, no \nneed to comment actually.",

Finally, you're 100% right about \nthe term \"otaku\" - overall it lost a lot of its negative stigma (although \nnot 100% in Japan, but I'd say its better thanks to westerners embracing it \nas a positive thing).\n\nI only feel it isn't fair to judge people as not being true \"fans\" or \n\"otaku\" or whatever just because they're super into mainstream stuff.",

Take your favorite show (outside of anime) \nand one day they changed the main character's voice, your first reaction \nwould be \"Wait... that doesn't sound right.\" it's the same idea here. Also, \ngetting the new English lines to sync up with the mouths is actually really \nhard, if you watch interviews they have to watch the scene play to fit the \nwords in, sometimes changing the line. Plus, literally translating the \nlines from Japanese (or any other language really) would not only not fit \nthe way the characters speak, but also sound wrong to people that speak \nEnglish. I have nothing against Subbed, just trying to shed some light on \nstuff! \nI personally think the voice acting in Attack on Titan is fantastic, they \nALL give it their all and it sounds realistic at times, like with Eren's \nMom. If you want bad Dubbed voice acting, watch Elfen Lied. It has some of \nthe worst Dubbed acting I have ever heard (no offence fans of the show, but \nI really dislike that anime). If that's what all Dubbed sounded like I \nwouldn't blame Subbed people, but there are a lot of good animes that have \nawesome dubs. I think Fairy Tail, Hetalia, and Attack on Titan have \nfantastic dubs. That part is just my opinion though",

Baccano is \nthe best example I could think of because the anime takes place in the \nUnited States(around the 1930's). Of course someone from the United States \nwould do a better impression of someone living in that time period than a \nJapanese person, just like how an American's voice wouldn't fit a Japanese \ncharacter very well. Most animes are based in Japan so I think that's \npartly the reason why they don't fit very well. It also has to do with \ncasting and how Japan often has a lot more resources for anime than a \ndubbing company like Funimation. Oh and there's the fact that subs are \noften fanmade, so they never really have very translations. I remember \nreading all these Parasyte mangas/subs where they were still spelling \nShinichi's name as \"Shinji\". Saying that a sub is better than a dub just \nbecause it's the original doesn't make much sense to me, I just pick from \nthe voices I like better.",
