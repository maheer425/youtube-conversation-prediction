                "text": "The Holocaust. The Lynchings. Two of the worst atrocities in history.\n\nIn Germany today the Holocaust is the single biggest thing taught in \nhistory and other subjects. They read multiple books written by survivors \n(think Anne Frank's diary) in German classes, they visit synagogues and \nconcentration camps and they learn all the gory details of the third Reich \nin history class. Multiple times in different depths. In the vast majority \nof German environment there is no hate or even resentment against Jews. And \nsaying something that can be construed as antisemitic is the surest way for \na German politician to commit political suicide. Holocaust Denial, the Nazi \nSalute, membership of the Nazi party and the promotion of hate and violence \nare all illegal.\n\nIn the Deep South of the USA today Lynchings are at best viewed with mixed \nopinions, many seeing them as a great thing that's gone now. The details \nare suppressed, rarely focused on in class or politics, and those that do \nbring it up are discredited for 'Playing the race card'. Hatred and racism \ntowards African Americans is extremely commonplace, and politicians who \nspeak out against African Americans, insulting them and using racist slurs \nas often get a boost from their base as they get political retribution. The \nKKK, Nazi Party and numerous other hate groups are completely legal and \nable to be joined, as is the promotion of hate and in many cases violence.\n\nIn the true American way rather than learn from the past, much of the USA \nlooks back at it's most horrendous time fondly, many completely ignoring or \ngoing out of their way to suppress any mention of it, while only a minority \nit seems to see it and point to it as the horror that it was.\n\nAmerica loves to point out the horrors of the holocaust, of Stalin's Russia \nand more recently of North Korea's horrific prison camps, yet is all to \nhappy to deny and forget the horrors it itself committed, despite the fact \nthat there are those today still suffering from the after effects of it.\n\nThe horrors of the years of slavery, and the years of segregation, of \nlynchings, racism and such are not 'The Good Old Days', they are what \nAmerica should be most ashamed of throughout it's entire history, it should \nbe considered, not just in America but worldwide, as one of the greatest \natrocities in human history, a symbol of the very worst of humanity.\ufeff",

We've, literally, built this county \nbrick by excruciating brick and have fought in every single war this nation \nhas ever had; yet, somehow, we are regarded as a disease and value far less \nthan our white brethren. When we stop fighting for this country and start \nfighting for ourselves, America will have absolutely no choice but to show \nfavor. By fighting for ourselves I mean discontinuing enrollment into Armed \nForces and refusing to spending our money where we aren't hired or on those \nwhich refuse to spend their money with us.\n\nBlacks have the most powerful currency this world has ever seen since gold. \nOur money is better than gold because we don't own anything; therefore, \nevery dime we make is spent on another race of people and their products, \nmeanwhile, our businesses are boycotted by the rest of the races. Now, \nsure, some do spend their money with us, but the majority does not. Some \nrefuse to do so by way of bias, but most understand that in order to \nmaintain dominance they must exercise group economics.\n\n Now, this isn't meant to race-bait or hate anyone, but to uplift those in \nthe struggle. \n\nAlso, regardless of Arabs pushing of slave throughout history, they aren't \nthe ones beating us down here in America, which our people built and fought \nfor. If we were judging a country by way of slavery we would find that \nevery country known to mankind has had dealings in slavery. ",

False accusations of racism seem to \nbe your defense mechanism, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you are \nlikely a black liberal. I also base that on the way you phrased your \ncomment earlier, blaming blacks committing much more crime on racism. No \nfactual evidence to support your claim at all of course. Also, tell me how \nblacks are influenced to commit more crimes specifically because of the \nfailure of affirmative action? Affirmative action was a program of FAVORING \nblacks and HANDING them jobs/positions at universities. How can that be \nblamed for why blacks commit more crimes? If everything liberals said is \ntrue, affirmative action should be improving the lives of blacks. In \nreality it's not because giving black people jobs/positions at universities \nthey aren't qualified for is a recipe for disaster because they aren't \nqualified. It's not because their black. It's because they aren't the best, \nmost qualified, highest scoring candidate. Anyhow, affirmative action can't \nlogically be blamed for black failures in America. Racism truly can't be \nblamed either (at least not in today's society) because we live in a \nsociety where you are EXCORIATED if you say anything that could even be \nperceived as racist (if you are white of course). White people \nintentionally walk on egg shells in society when talking about racial \nissues because they don't want to be ruined socially. That is a liberal \nbullying tactic. They try to discredit/demonize the person they are \ndebating, instead of trying to combat their message. White people are sick \nof it though, and we're still the majority so it's going to stop. ",

This not only \nincluded the Germans, but also Scandinavians; Hitler also felt that the \nBritish, or Anglo-Saxon people were related to his Aryans. He then regarded \npeople from the Latin counties (Spain, France, and Italy) to be just below \nhis race. To say that he felt that the \"white\"race in itself to be superior \nis completely incorrect as he said that that the Slavic peoples (almost all \nof Eastern-Europe) were inferior, and only fit for slavery, whereas the \nJapanese and the Chinese, according to what he said, were \"equal to if not \nabove the aryan race due to their 'racial integrity and purity'\". \nThe more you know... ;)",

                    "text": "+Hadley Pleasanton At first I was skeptical about your skepticism, Hadley. \nYou're saying that methodically exterminating five to six million people, \nperforming bizarre experiments on them, and plundering their bodies is, at \nsome level, comprehensible, but making lampshades out of their skin \u2014 now \nthat's crazy. Personally I wasn't seeing any great leap, depravity wise. \nHowever, on investigation, I think you may be right. While the Nazis kept \nmany grisly mementos of their victims, including tattooed skin, the \nlampshade claim may be a myth.\nBy far the best-known account of human souvenirs comes from the camp at \nBuchenwald. Here's the story as best I can piece it together:\n\n(1) Even by Nazi standards, Buchenwald was out of control. Its original \ncommandant, Karl Koch, was by all accounts corrupt and cruel. Inmates \nloathed him and his apparently sadistic wife, Ilse, whom they dubbed \"the \nWitch of Buchenwald.\" Meanwhile, medical personnel were keeping human \nsouvenirs \u2014 in 1942 SS higher-ups ordered them to quit making \"gifts\" such \nas shrunken heads. A story arose that Ilse had had tattooed prisoners \nkilled so lampshades and other articles could be made from their skin.\n(2) In 1943 the SS conducted an internal investigation and tried the Kochs \non charges including embezzlement and incitement to murder. (Karl had \narranged for the shooting of two inmates who knew he'd contracted syphilis \n\u2014 the SS brass, if not necessarily the rank and file, paid at least lip \nservice to the notion that prisoners weren't to be killed frivolously.) The \nSS judge, Konrad Morgen, found Karl guilty and ordered his execution, but \nacquitted Ilse. Later at her war crimes trial Morgen testified that a \nthorough search of her home found no human-skin lampshades or the like. \nIlse didn't live at Buchenwald after 1943.\n(3) Shortly after U.S. troops liberated Buchenwald in 1945, director Billy \nWilder made a documentary about the camp to publicize Nazi atrocities. A \nwidely circulated still photo from the film showed a table covered with \npreserved human remains, including two shrunken heads; several pieces of \nwhat appears to be tattooed skin; and an ordinary-looking table lamp. The \nfilm's narration says that among the items found was \"a lampshade, made of \nhuman skin, made at the request of an SS officer's wife.\" The press went \nnuts, and soon the lampshade became emblematic of Nazi barbarism.\n(4) Ilse Koch and others from Buchenwald were tried in 1947 for war crimes. \nProsecutors submitted as evidence a shrunken head and three pieces of \ntattooed human skin but apparently no lampshade. Much of the testimony \nagainst Koch was hearsay, although at least one former inmate said he'd \nseen a tattooed-skin lampshade. Koch was convicted, but her life sentence \nwas commuted on review, in part because of doubts about the witnesses' \ncredibility. She was later tried by a German court, again sentenced to \nlife, and committed suicide in prison in 1967.\n(5) Five pieces of tattooed skin are kept at the National Museum of Health \nand Medicine (NMHM) and one at the National Archives (NA), both federal \nfacilities in the D.C. area. All six items are from Buchenwald; three have \nbeen positively identified as human, and another is now being tested. The \nNA item was once labeled \"human skin lampshade,\" but an archivist there \nsays it has no perforations or other indications of such use. Two of the \nNMHM items have holes on the left side as though from a hole punch. A \nthird, which is large and irregularly shaped, has pinholes around the \nperimeter at one- to three-centimeter intervals. How the holes got there is \nunknown, but a photo shows the skins stuck up on an exhibit board at Ilse \nKoch's 1947 trial. The NMHM curator reserves judgment, but to me nothing \nsuggests these items were part of a lampshade. The lamp from the movie \nstill has vanished; however, as photographed it doesn't match the lamp \ndescribed by witnesses at the trial \u2014 it has no visible markings at all.\nAbsent compelling evidence to the contrary, I tend to the view that \nappalled liberation forces heard the survivors' tales, found the \ntattooed-skin souvenirs, and thought: Whoa, lampshades. In short, the story \nmay be a legend. Deniers will now claim: That proves the Holocaust didn't \nhappen! No, it doesn't, losers. All it means is that, even in a gamy \nbusiness like this, it's still possible to separate fiction from fact.\n\nOccasionally you hear about human-skin lampshades in private collections. I \nwon't claim to have surveyed the field, but I did speak to Norm Sauer, a \nprofessor of forensic anthropology at Michigan State University. Professor \nSauer was part of a team of experts that a few years ago examined a number \nof alleged human souvenirs that had been donated to the Holocaust Memorial \nCenter, now located in Farmington Hills, MI. Among the items were a \nlampshade (and it really was a lampshade, consisting of panels on a wire \nframe), two chess sets, and a bar of soap, along with some collections of \nashes, bone fragments, and so on. Although some of the bone fragments did \nappear to be human, most and possibly all of the household objects were \nnot. The chess sets were made of animal but not human bone; the lampshade \npossibly was deer or goat but not human skin. Tests of the soap were \ninconclusive. (The alleged practice of rendering human fat into soap is a \nstory unto itself; the common opinion now seems to be that while it may \nhave been made experimentally once, human soap was never produced in \nquantity.) You never know what will turn up, but without tests, don't \nassume that just because a lampshade or other item is claimed to be of \nhuman origin, it is.\n Further:\nIn The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New \nOrleans (2010), New York magazine contributing editor Mark Jacobson tells \nof a lampshade discovered in the wreckage of post-Katrina New Orleans that \ntesting showed to be made of human skin. (Here's an excerpt.) According to \na Publishers Weekly review quoted on Amazon, \"evidence linking it to famous \nallegations that Nazis made lampshades from concentration camp victims is \nscanty, and Holocaust museum curators dismiss such claims.\"",

Because Muslims immigrants who have \ncome in masses to Sweden are raping all the ethnic swedes since they \nbelieve women who don't cover themselves are whores and deserve to be raped.\n\nAnother example, check this story out that happened recently about two \nmonths ago in Britain.\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2523658/Muslim-campaigners-protest-sale-alcohol-popular-East-London-area.html\nBritish muslim citizens are protesting for sharia law and ban of alcohol. \nThe leader of that group is a Muslim man that was born in the UK in the \n1960s. So your theory of this not applying to second or third generation \nMuslims is a load of BS. I've also seen stories of so called \"Muslim \npatrols\" going around attacking innocent civilians.\n\nIt has also been uncovered that there are \"rape gangs\" of Muslim men who \nare going around raping white women.

Here's a recent story on this but there are COUNTLESS CASES where the \nPC liberal government turns a blind eye to.\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2564678/Teenage-girl-victim-grooming-gang-raped-30-men-just-six-hours-including-father-schoolboy-son.html\nBtw, in Britain, when they refer to asians, they mean Muslim Pakistanis, \nnot oriental asians like most would assume (technically, pakistan, india, \nafghanistan are in asia). A tactic used in Britain to deceive people.\n\nModerate muslims my ass. These Muslim scum are the only ones that can't \nintegrate wherever they move to.
