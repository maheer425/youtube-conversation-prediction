My \nfriend suffers from depression as well and finds that mindfulness \ntechniques help her - there's lots of books and stuff online about it. Or \nthere's online CBT courses...\nasking for help is hard and it took me a really long time but the more \npeople you have supporting you the easier it is. Also find out as much as \nyou can about it and what options you have in terms of help (knowledge is \npower!)\nSorry that ended up being so long! hope some of it helps",

The point you made about finding happiness in \nsmaller things is actually something I came to realize on my own recently. \nNot every moment in your life is going to be as big as say, graduating, \ngetting a new car, getting a new good job, meeting your special someone, \netc. Most days (speaking for myself here ) are just like take-out food and \nNetflix (for example), and that's perfectly okay. I stopped comparing what \nI've done so far with what everyone else has done/is doing, and just enjoy \nbeing myself and doing things my own way. I found I was a lot happier doing \nthat. Also hope this makes some kind of sense because I end up typing so \nfast that my brain hasn't finished processing what I actually want to say \nand sometimes it doesn't come out right (derp) >.>\ufeff",
