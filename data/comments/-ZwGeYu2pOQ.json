I feel like there was \nabsolutely nothing wrong with the writing because it felt like its how the \ncharacters would react and how its suppose to happen. The only problems i \ncan see so far is the VERY minor problems in animation and how awkwardly \nthey characters move at times and the early episodes that had the most \ntrouble with lip syncing, but other than that, i feel like this writing is \nhow it is and is how it should be. I'm tired of people judging it even if \nthey say they enjoyed it. I just want a crowd that appreciates it as much \nas i do, which isn't hard to do at all.",

There are plenty \nof anime that make sense on their own terms, like how The Matrix makes \nsense for the Matrix franchise or how giant eagles with complex politics \nmake sense for Lord of the Rings.\n\nDeath Note, Fullmetal Alchemist*, Berserk*, YuYu Hakusho, and Baccano!* are \njust a handful of anime that would be pretty accessible for a newcomer. \nIt's best to start with some mainstream series before you veer off into \ninsanity like Code Geass: Lord of Anime Tropes, Gurren Lagann, or FLCL. \n\nAlso: For the record, gratuitous fanservice is one of the things I hate \nmost about modern anime. That said, High School of the Dead is another \nseries that's pretty accessible, but at the same time it ODs on fanservice \nfrom minute one. Its chemical formula would be something like \"zombies plus \nboobs,\" with guns as a catalyst.\n\nAlso: Also: I'm not sure starting with a web series whose status as \"anime\" \nis, shall we say, debatable, was the best place to test the anime waters. \nIt's kind of like wondering, \"Do I like sitcoms?\" and then marathoning \nCollege Humor videos. But that's just my two cents.\n\n*The characters in Fullmetal Alchemist, Berserk, and Baccano! have Anglican \n(read: not Japanese) names, so there wouldn't be a ton of words to get \nconfused over.

Slowly the Hunters and Huntresses all fall until \nonly team RWBY are left, fighting with everything they have. The group \nslowly get separated and surrounded. They fight honorably, but in the end \nthe sheer amount of enemies they face is too much and they fall. They all \ndie in a blaze of glory in a battle worthy of the gods. It will be a good \nday to die.\n\nAnd when they're all dead, the camera slowly pans to show the counsoler \nsaying 'Director, another fragment has been made'\"",
