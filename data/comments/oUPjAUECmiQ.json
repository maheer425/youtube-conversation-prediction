                "text": "Gods, I've been saying this for months -- years, even, since I put the \npieces together and realized that there's a concerted effort among a \ncertain paleoconservative, hyper-capitalist element in our society, in and \nout of government, to sabotage, defund, and discredit the government -- \nprimarily the federal government but also the state government -- to such a \ndegree as to render the privatization of some or all governmental functions \nmore palatable to enough of the American people so that they can, once and \nfor all, dissolve most or all of the government that durst regulate \nbusiness in any way, probably only keeping those aspects thereof that they \ncan use to exert their will over the \"consumers.\"\n\nThis may sound like hyperbole, but these people fit within any reasonable \ndefinition of \"enemy, foreign or domestic\" -- in this case, largely \ndomestic, although there are foreign corporations that have significant \nshares in propaganda arms within this country that are used to sway people \nto vote against their own interests.  I'm not saying that criticizing \ncertain aspects of government or society or promoting certain ideas is \ntreasonous, but this kind of wholesale manipulation is not intended to \nincrease the quality of life or the efficiency and effectiveness of \ngovernment but rather to artificially render it obsolete.\n\nNow, it may be the case that, in the course of time, a certain form or \nmanifestation of government naturally becomes obsolete.  This could be due \nto irreconcilable differences among constituent populations (\u00e0 la \nCzechoslovakia), or it could be that, sometime down the line, a vast \nmajority of the people of said state decide that a hierarchical \ngovernmental structure is not how they want to go about perpetuating and \ntaking care of their society (such as the proposed \"Venus Project\").\n\nHowever, intentionally wreaking havoc on such a massive scale by causing \nwidespread confusion or spreading so many outright lies in an organized \nmanner for the purpose of paralyzing the government and sabotaging the \npeople's faith therein is not fundamentally different from waging war on \nthe government and thus the Constitution -- the social contract -- that \nenables our system of government and protects our way of life, although it \ncan only do that so long as enough people treat it as the supreme law of \nthe land that it is.\n\n\"Corporate personhood\" gives a small number of people within an \norganization the ability to use the resources accumulated by a much larger \nnumber of people as their own power-base in order to effect changes via a \nfor-sale government that naturally suit them and not the people by whose \nauthority government governs and without regard for the mandates by which \nrepresentatives, senators, and presidents are sent to Washington, D.C., to \ndo the job of governance.  Corporations, however, are greedy and rapacious. \n This is not a value-judgment, per se, but rather a statement of fact.  In \nthe system that we have set up for doing business, corporations *have* to \nbe greedy and rapacious, doing literally whatever they can to meet their \nbottom line: the acquisition of money at the cost of nearly anything else. \n Purposefully taking a financial hit for any reason other than the promise \nof *more* money later is grounds for a lawsuit from one or more \nstock-holders, whose investment is considered \"stolen\" if the petroleum \ncompany (for instance) in which they've invested their money decides *not* \nto built a disastrously dangerous pipeline because it will very likely have \nan immensely devastating effect on the environment.  It is possible that \nsome corporations may be able to get away with it by stipulating to its \nshareholders that certain environmental and social justice issues may take \nprecedence over money, but if that's an option, then most are not willing \nto do that.\n\nThis is why corporations shouldn't be running things.  Allowing them to \ncontribute virtually limitless funds to candidates and causes, often \nwithout having to reveal their true nature or the amount of money spent in \ntheir propaganda, is like making specific accommodation for criminally \ninsane people who represent the very worst of human nature to hold \nunelected positions of authority in a community.\n\nWe share this home, so to speak, and to a certain degree, We the People \nhave a right to set certain limits on the behaviors that we allow from \nourselves and others who do business here or with us, and while I don't \nfavor a violent uprising against these people, like the Koch Brothers, I do \nabsolutely favor fighting back politically.  As I see it, there are at \nleast two ways of doing this: 1) Not being fooled and doing whatever you \ncan to ensure that as many people with whom you have any contact, direct or \nindirect, have a chance of seeing the truth, too, that these corporations \ndo not own this country, they do not own our government, and they do not \nown our people; 2) by removing \"corporate personhood\" and undoing the \ntravesty that was the ruling commonly known as \"Citizens United.\"  Wolf-PAC \n-- the political action committee started by Cenk Uygur of TYT to achieve \nthe latter goal -- and other similar groups, such as MoveToAmend, could \nonly do good for this nation if one or more of them succeeds, and I truly \nhope that one of them does.\ufeff",

A government that is bought and sold will never \nserve the people's needs.\n\nSecond, no, big corporations do NOT have a vested interest in maintaining \nprivate property rights for the majority of the American people -- only for \nthemselves and their allies.  Just ask Monsanto about their disturbingly \nsuccessful efforts to sue farmers after Monsanto allowed their \"patented\" \nseeds to enter the farmer's land, resulting in the stealing of countless \nacres of land.  This, ye of too much faith, is not the support of \npro-property rights; this is pro-corporate rights, as they see themselves \nas eminently superior to individual humans and smaller businesses.\n\nNor do they have any interest in the continuity of a stable government. \n They are feudalists who truly believe, as their actions demonstrate, that \nmost, if not all, government functions can and should be privatized.  Just \nlook into the TPP; it places mega-corporations above states, which would be \nthe end of our democratic republic, and everyone else's for that matter, as \nwe know it.\n\nThat said, the effort to destroy this country that I described up above is \nbeing perpetrated by people on \"both\" sides; ergo, *I despise Obama as much \nas I despise the Koch brothers* and see them both as being responsible, in \ndifferent ways, for achieving the same goal: the running down of the \nfederal government in order to make privatization seem more palatable to \nthe American people.  So, the \"See?  Obama's an evil leftist and worse than \nany corporation\"-argument won't work on me because he's largely a \"right \nwing\" Republican without the religious fundamentalism.  The American people \nwere duped\n\nDon't forget, Obamacare (this \"socialist\" agenda -- which is nothing more \nthan a corporate giveaway via a national mandate) largely originated from \nthe \"right wing\" -- i.e., The Heritage Foundation -- and it was largely \ndesigned to fail.  Obama's people tweaked it a bit, but it's still highly \nproblematic.\n\nAmerican corporatism is feudalism, and free-market capitalism is religion \ndressed in economics.  The former is the sanction of the creation of large, \ntransnational organizations whose interests are ultimately at \ncross-purposes with the people of the United States and the government \nitself, given that they can be sued by their shareholders if they DON'T \ndevastate the environment in order to make a few extra buck, if they DON'T \nruin people's lives for the sake of a few extra bucks, and so on and so \nforth.  The latter is predicated on \"the invisible hand of the free \nmarket,\" which is -- in no uncertain terms, according to Adam Smith (who \ncoined the term and wrote about the free market) -- the hand of God.  Adam \nSmith *knew* that economics didn't -- and still doesn't -- work in such a \nway that would make \"free market\" capitalism work, and yet he believed that \nthe God would work \"His\" will through the \"free market.\"",

The part that makes me happiest, tho, is the \npart where you refer to them as \"phony capitalists\". Based on, both, the \nstrict definition of capitalism and how capitalism as a system works in the \nreal world they aren't capitalists; they are crony capitalists and \ncorporatists.\n\nCapitalism is a system that works quite well when there are checks & \nbalances in place that keep it from rampaging out of control, i.e., common \nsense federal laws and a level-headed Federal Gov't. As I implied above, \nthere are two things wrong with capitalism, however, and neither one of \nthem is capitalism.\n\n1. 'Crony capitalism' is what happens selfish & ignorant self-serving \nbehavior i.e., cronyism, ppl getting jobs, contracts, bonuses, etc., \nwhether or not they have any logical right to lay claim to them of any \nkind, whatsoever, and/or the same self-serving behavior(s) by businesses \nand/or businesspeople spills over into politics and/or government, and/or \nwhen self-serving friendships and/or family ties between businessmen and \nthe government influence the economy and/or society to the extent that it \ncorrupts public-serving economic and political ideals.\n\nBig business was vehemently against 'the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act' when \nit was being pushed through the House and the Senate, bc of crony \ncapitalism, for the very reason that it meant that businesses and/or gov't \nwouldn't be able to hide very well behind corporate and/or gov't policies \nto keep ppl from being paid money that is legitimately owed to them, \nregardless of whether or not those ppl (And in the case of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act...women!), played the office politics necessary to \ngarner the incentives and support of, typically upper management, those who \ncould make decisions about specific things, such as who gets paid, how much \nthey get paid, when they get paid, what they get paid for, etc.\n\nAnd then there was the ever infamous Dick Cheney, and/or the Bush \nAdministration, giving Halliburton that sweet no-bid contract!\n\n2. Corporatism, has more than one definition but the one that I am \nreferring to, is what happens within a company/corporation when what is \nbest for the business drives every, at least every primary, goal and idea, \ni.e., money and the pursuit of it, overriding all other concerns.\n\nBig business was also against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act due to \ncorporatism, too! It wasn't good for their bottom line after all!\n\nAnd Lee Iococca did this in the late 70's with the Ford Pinto! Ford found \nit cheaper to pay off the families of the victims, the maimed, families of \nthe maimed and the families of the dead, of Pinto fires than the $137 \nmillion it would cost to fix the Pinto immediately, according to an \ninternal Ford memo introduced during a civil trial. So, they decided that \nit was not cost-effective to do the repairs & therefore screwing over real \nppl, families, children, etc.\n\nThere is no way of knowing how much Ford paid in Pinto suits because some \nwere settled quietly out of court.\n\nI hope that we are not all doomed!",

I would hope we can all agree that national defense is \nbetter done by our government. Since you clearly haven't read Samuelson or \nany other basic economics text, here's just one example of other things the \nfree market doesn't do very well: free goods are those things which we all \nwant but which it's at least difficult to deny to those who don't pay for \nthem like clean air. We all need it to breathe, but polluting it is cheaper \nfor manufacturers than not to. So, without regulation, polluting firms will \nhave lower costs and drive out their responsible competitors, and we will \nall be wearing masks to survive in polluted air. Some of us would rather \nregulate manufacturers, pay a bit more for their products and breath \nwithout masks :-(  As to the gross unfairness,and, yes immorality, of the \nversion of equality represented by any flat tax, I think Anatole France put \nit best many years ago: \"In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and \npoor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of \nbread.\"",

Money paid will come out of other areas of the economy.\n\nThe idea that everyone is going to get better healthcare and plus insure an \nadditional 30 million people for free, is a bit wishful thinking.

It's logically flawed.\nNobody would force a vegan to eat a hamburger, and they wouldn't force \nsomeone who was morally opposed to it to use birth control.\n\nFor your comparison to work, it would have to look like this:\n\"You wouldn't force a vegan employer to insure their meat eater employees \nfor heart disease, even if they thought heart disease was caused by meat \n(it does increase the risks) and the vegan thought the meat eaters deserved \nheart disease\"\nAnd actually, I would.\n\nSecondly, what kind of religious zealot nutjob is against BIRTH CONTROL?!\n\nFurther, if abortions are legal then yes, I would force an employer to \nfully cover their employees for legal medical procedures that are \navailable. You can argue that abortions shouldn't be legal (though you \nshouldn't even if you're against them, but that's another story) but if \nthey are and insurers want to provide that cover, then an employer \nshouldn't be making that decision for other people.\n\nYou're trying to garner support by obfuscation and confusion. Not \nsurprising really, but it's not ethical. If you really think your position \nis more moral, you should be able to express it cleanly without the \ndeliberate attempts to muddy the issue.",
