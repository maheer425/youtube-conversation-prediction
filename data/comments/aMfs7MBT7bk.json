I \nwasn't raised eating sushi and neither were Martina and Simon (cause, you \nknow, I live in the southern US and they lived in Canada) so of course none \nof us would know how to properly eat sushi. If I went to a sushi place and \nhad the chef there help me out like the chef in this video did, I would be \ngrateful, not offended. Cause I'd rather have someone tell me how to eat it \ninstead of possibly offending someone by eating it wrong. And to the people \nsaying the camera is too close to Simon's face, she was on her iPhone. And \nthe black \"fly\" on the screen?

The chef will have already put the \ncorrect amount of wasabi on so you dont have to.",

The pace was perfect for me. The right amount of time to \nenjoy the sushi and served in the perfect order. again, the tamagoyaki was \nsuperb, Tako was extremely flavorful and tender, the wild kuruma shrimp \ndelicious, and the Uni light years far from other restaurants i tried. We \nmust agree that there is something special in the way Jiro makes sushi, but \nalso the way is selected. \n\nTaira Shirokane is great, dont get me wrong, and hayashi is amazing, one of \nmy tops so far, love the place but for some reason Jiro blew my mind.

Not as long but it's aged to \nenhance the flavor. How you cut the fish makes a HUGE difference in \ntexture. If you've ever filleted a fish, you'd know that you need a super \nsharp knife so that it's not only easier to cut, but to preserve the \nintegrity if the fish.

Others are equally as uncomfortable turning their \nphones off at a dinner table, or in in a theater. However, in neither \nscenario is your discomfort a justification for disrespect; you pay the \nwaiter because that is the custom, you turn your phone off at the dinner \ntable because it distracts the people at the table, and you turn your phone \noff at the theater because you ruin the experience for everyone else. It's \ncalled basic fucking courtesy.\n\nIf a chef doesn't want you to sniff his food, you simply don't sniff his \nfood, or better yet, don't eat there at all. In Japanese culture, sniffing \nfood is equivalent to seasoning something a chef has cooked - you're \ncalling his/her creation shit. You just don't do it. If you fail to follow \nit, they throw your disrespectful arse out of there.\n\nOn a happier note, I'm delighted to hear that ilk of your kind would be \ndiscouraged from following or taking part in a culture that threatens to \nthrow you out of a fine dinning experience for your failure to follow their \nrules. You've saved us all valuable time. Just let the rest of your kind \nknow that as well, so that we can actually serve people who are interested \nin a proper experience.   ",

News flash, just \nbecause it's in a culture doesn't mean it's useful or even makes sense. We \ndon't agree with cultures that kill people as part of ritual, but when it \ncomes to non-harmful yet asinine things, we excuse it as \"culture\".\n\nIt just sounds snooty. I think it's obvious if someone is checking for \npoison or something vs taking in how awesome and fresh something smells.\n\nIf someone is truly offended by something, it's THEIR job to tell this \nperson kindly not to do it. There is nothing wrong with that, even if \nlogically it make not make sense, it's still respectful, not to the \nculture, but that human being with feelings to respect how they feel. \nMartina would of stopped immediately had the chef asked her kindly to not \nsmell his food and he explained how it made him feel.",

I was a sushi \nchef once and I believe all the sushi chefs out there are highly conscious \nabout it. So, as for sushi in Japan, the smell/scent part is not expected \nto be enjoyed except for few such as broiled one.\n\nBut.

Different food  And different habits \nabout food...And again your opinion is not supported ...a haburger is what \nwe call pressata and it was cooked here in my country before the discovery \nof the USA .And is a German recipe....What you think is \" american\" at the \nend is something imported...hahahah Connecticut ? Really you are such an \nignorant you dont realize that your country is just 600 y.o more or less :D \nahahahahahh You don't even have a tipical cusine ... What we cook here \ncomes from thousend years of story !!!!!! Here food is related to culture \nand not to something that you eat to become a  barrel as your country \ndemostrates daily and .BTW our sushi sheff was japanese :D hahahah That's \nwhy nobody can come here and tell us that is wrong cos we respect the food \nas form of art and not as a product.!!! Now please co back to your MC \ndonalds,, or KFC to order some shit. And there is not an american way to do \na pizza .. there is just 1 way .. our way ...as for the sushi there is only \n1 way the japanese way.. as for the Pressata/Hamburgher  there is only one \nand has nothing to do with your country! Go to the american indians and ask \nabout food they are the real americans ...they know wich is the real \ntypical cusine...But we agree on something at the end there is a lot of \npeople like this..even in our restaurants..BUT THEY DONT PUT VIDEOS ONE THE \nINTERNET PRETENDING TO BE CRITICS!!!!!!  THAT?S THE POINT!!!!!!!",

There's the Korean take \non pizza, the Italian take on pizza, the North American take on pizza, it's \njust a fact of life that people have different takes on the \"traditional\" \nway of doing things. Look at all of the different ways the hamburger is \ntaken around the world! No one goes around saying, \"that's not a *real* \nhamburger. You only get *real* hamburgers from Connecticut made exactly \nthis way.\"\nJust let people enjoy food. Not everyone is as nit-picky as you are about \nfood.\nIf you're Italian, who's to say a Japanese person can't come up to your \noh-so-fabulous restaurant and say you're doing it wrong simply because \nyou're Italian? That's what you're saying about American pizza. I can \nalmost guarantee that there is something that your restaurant does that \nthey don't do in Japan because of differences in resources and fish species \nby region.\nBy the way, I have never been to Italy but I have been to other European \ncountries and I see PLENTY of obese people. Just sayin'  \nI just don't understand what you're so upset about. This professional sushi \nchef is preparing sushi for them, telling them what it is, they eat it and \nenjoy it, end of story. What in the world is there to get offended about? \nTHEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT GOES INTO THIS BLAH BLAH BLAH THEY MAY HAVE NEVER \nTRIED THIS ANYWHERE ELSE TO COMPARE BLAH BLAH BLAH. You bet your bottom \ndollar that most of the people that come into your restaurant are the same \nway as Simon and Martina. \nI feel like there may be some misunderstanding due to the language barrier \nabout what I said before, so I feel like you may have misunderstood some of \nmy statements and that's why you're so offended. But whatever, let bygones \nbe bygones. \nPS: I'm not a fella ;)",

I' m a spearfisher... i love sushi  i know the sea ..... i do \nsushi.. i'v worked for 12 years in restaurants and also in the best sushi \nrestaurant in my region . ( arcadia restaurant in turin ) .

To \nthis kind of people you can offer a Trout telling that is salmon ...or a \nMullet telling that is red snepper.... that's the point .

You can say that \nyou like something .. if you like it nothing wrong with that... But your \nopinion is based on your experience always!!! And BTW there is a reason if \nyour country has a real problem related to the food and a 40% of obesity \nand is that you don't know how to properly eat....

Your logic doesn't really make sense to me. They \naren't food critics and they don't mean to be really, they are just going \nto restaurants to show them off and say, hey! I had a really good \nexperience here because we, ourselves, liked the food! They aren't \nprofessional culinary critics by any means, they are just going to Japan \nand sharing their adventures and experience.\nSo, are you saying that an American can't go to Italy and try pizza and \ndecide that they don't like it because American pizza is made differently? \nThat's pretty shallow, if you ask me. You're probably thinking, \"Their \npizza isn't *real* pizza because they make it differently.\" So what if it's \nmade differently? If it's delicious to the person does it really matter? \nWhat would the world be like if everyone made all the same food all the \nsame way wherever you went and never experimented? Boring.",

WHEN & HOW the fish was caught. Regular Fish you'd find at a market \nwas most likely caught & immediately shoved into ice to be shipped off. \nSushi grade however (depending on freshness) is normally kept in really \nclean tanks still swimming until ready to be eaten or prepared (to be \nfillet) & 2.) Is WHERE you cut the fish. You CANNOT just cut any part of a \nregular fish and serve it up raw because the fish IS ALREADY DEAD DUMBASS! \n\nI don't know about you but I'm not too keen on slicing into a whole fish \nthat's been dead with a side of Freezer Burn (& not to mention without any \nproper training of slicing said fish in the first place) & serving ANY part \nof it to myself or my family. That's pretty damn stupid if you think that's \nok. \n\nSushi grade fish has been carefully sliced in SPECIFIC places that are safe \nfor human consumption IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FISH WAS CAUGHT. Freshness is \nkey to Sushi Grade fish, & even in America isn't the freshest sushi in the \nworld. \n\nIt's just like Philly CheeseSteak Sandwich. WHERE WOULD U GO FOR THE \nBEST???? UHM YEA. DUH. PHILLY! or a New York Cheesecake???? \nNEW.FRICKIN.YORK. WHY? Because they originated there. Now where in the \nworld do you think Sushi originated from? Take a wild guess. Yea Japan. \nJapanese people have been making & perfecting sushi for centuries!!! That's \nwhy it's so popular. \n\nAnd because they don't make ignorant mistakes like people like you. -_- \nSoak up a little culture into your brain before your mouth runs.",

Don't be \nscared! Any and ALL raw seafood is prepared in a way that makes it 100% \nsafe to consume! Also, almost, if not all, sushi places have cooked seafood \nas an option, or even sushi rolls without seafood in them at all \n(Philadelphia Roll, for example)!

Think of it as dry aging process of steak.\n\nthen comes to perfect balance of fish, rice and soy sauce. How you prepare \nthe rice also dictates the flavor of sushi as well.  Food can be considered \nan art. For same reason you pay more to listen to Leon Fleisher play piano \nvs some local HS kid playing it.   to untrained ears, they may sound same \nand you might as well not pay more to listen to Mr. Fleisher, but if you \ncan discern it, then you know the difference.\n\nsame for sushi.
