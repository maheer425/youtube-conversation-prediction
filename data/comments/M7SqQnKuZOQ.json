I returned them 1.5 months after I bought them because the right \nshow split in half.......full refund. Then I went to sport check and bought \nsome real shoe's.\nI won't buy any electronics from Wal-Mart. My dad made that mistake and \nspent 400 dollars on a TV it did not last a year.\ufeff",

During \ncollege, we had a vending machine with New Coke for awhile so New Coke \ndidn't vanish immediately. I did get it occasionally.\n\nAlso, my parents had cases of original Coke. We only ran out shortly before \nClassic Coke came out. I agree that Classic Coke doesn't taste like the \noriginal. We did have a stray can show up later and ended up with it in my \nlunch one day months later. To me, Caffeine Free Classic tasted more like \noriginal Coke. I do admit that I don't know if a long time in storage may \nhave affected the cans. It was not flat though.",

In addition, \nCoca-Cola was able to play \"good Samaritan\" in \"changing\" back to it's \noriginal form while further burying it's increasingly distant competitor - \neven brought the term \"classic\" into the game, thus appealing to both older \nand younger soda drinkers who instantly forgot about Pepsi.\n\nWhat Pepsi ad campaign can you remember since the \"challenge\" days?\n\nCrystal Pepsi?\n\nExactly my point.\n\nCoke has been king ever since and this will never change until it's \ningredients and negative impact on human health are greatly publicized, \nsomething which is really gaining ground about now.\n\nBut New Coke was a brilliant left - right combo that forced Pepsi to start \nbuying potato chips to maintain market significance.\n\nHas anyone ever asked you, \"Is Coke okay?\"\n\nNo, but the same can't be said for Pepsi. If not for a couple of stupid \nfast-food chains, Pepsi wouldn't have seen the turn of the millennium.\ufeff",

                "text": "Great list, Danger Dolan...but you forgot to mention Nintendo. \n\nDuring the 80s and first half of the 90s, Nintendo was the unstoppable \ngiant of the video gaming world. They did everything right, until it was \ntime for the successor to the Super Nintendo console to hit the scene - the \nNintendo64, an absolute powerhouse for its time. Better and more powerful \nthan its competitors (SEGA Saturn, and Sony Playstation) in almost every \nway, there was nothing to suggest that the outcome of this generation of \nconsoles would be any different than the previous. Nintendo would be the \nwinner, and that was that. Well... it didn't quite turn out like that. \n\nGoing from 2D pixel based games to 3D polygon based graphics requires lots \nof digital storage space. For the longest time, Nintendo was making the N64 \nto be a CD ROM player. But then out of fear of losing profit to the piracy \nthat plagued the CD rom market, Nintendo suddenly ditched the planned CD \nROM player, and made the N64 console cartridge based like their previous \ntwo consoles. Cartridges are expensive to produce, and had only a fraction \nof the storage capacity of a CD. What's even worse, Nintendo made this \ndecision way too late. All the 3rd party game developers were already far \ninto their game projects for the console, thinking they had the 700mb of a \nCD to work with (+ the ability to put a game on several disks), instead of \nthe 8mb of a cartridge (an NO ability to but the game onto several units). \nThe most powerful console on the generation, had been reduced to something \nthat equals a Porsche with a thimble sized gas tank. The games that were in \ndevelopment for the new super console had already exceeded the size of \nNintendo's miserable cartridges, and the 3rd party developers urged \nNintendo to reconsider. Nintendo replied with arrogance, and basically told \nthe developers to suck it up and make the games smaller, or start over. \nNintendo thought they were unstoppable, and that they alone still could \ndictate the conditions of game development. The results were catastrophic, \nand their once so loyal 3rd party developers abandoned the console in \ndroves, for what would become the new king of the consoles - Sony \nPlaystation. Nintendo lost their momentum, and the effects are still felt \ntoday.\n\nThe story doesn't end here, though. It actually has a really interesting \nprequel. See, a few years earlier, Nintendo worked together with Sony to \ndevelop a 32bit CD ROM player add-on for the 16bit Super Nintendo console. \nThe add-on machine dubbed \"Nintendo Playstation\" was heavily anticipated, \nuntil one day out of a clear blue sky, Nintendo decided to axe the project, \nbecause they felt that Sony had too much of an advantage contractually.\nSony were outraged at such a disrespectful treatment from a business \npartner.  They continued to work on the console, which was later released \nas Sony Playstation. Irony so thick you could almost touch it. \ufeff",

                    "text": "+thebbeenn I'm to lazy to read the comments above to see if anyone else has \nalready said this, but I actually think SEGA were the ones who really \nfucked up during that generation. Nintendo might have won the 16-bit war as \nfar as worldwide sales are concerned, but that was thanks to the wide gap \nin sales between the Mega Drive and Super Famicom. (The Mega Drive wasn't \npopular in Japan, selling only a modest 4 million units while the Super \nFamicom sold 17 million.) In North America, Brazil, and most of Europe the \nthe Genesis/Megadrive was the more popular system.\n\nThen Silicon Graphics approached Tom Kalinske with a deal to make a \npowerful 3D based next generation console, but Sega of Japan didn't \napprove, so they went to Nintendo. SONY ALSO came to Sega looking for a \ndeal, and Sega of Japan said that it was \"stupid because Sony doesn't make \ngood hardware and they don't make software either\" THAT'S when Sony decided \nto go solo (coincidentally, Trip Hawkins approached Sony to manufacture the \n3Do, but Sony was unimpressed and had already decided on making their own \nsystem with their own hardware).\n\nSega of Japan had been working on their own next gen console, and it would \nbe a 2D-powerhouse as apposed to a 3D dedicated machine. Then, in late 1993 \nSony they got wind of what the PlayStation would be capable of, and Hayou \nNakayama, CEO of Sega of Japan, got so pissed off at Sega's hardware \ndivision he went over and chewed them out for being shown up by a company \nwith no experience on developing videogame hardware. He said to make the \nsystem a more powerful machine, and have it ready before the PlayStation \nwould be released, \"or else.\" Contrary to popular belief, a no single \nprocessor was \"slapped in at the last second\" in order to make what would \nbecome the Saturn better at 3D. The team scrapped everything they had \nworked on and hastily began designing a console that would be a capable 3D \nmachine, and an even BETTER 2D machine than originally intended (the \noriginal Saturn was presumably no better at 2D than the PlayStation). They \nonly had eleven months, and the end result was a console that was very \npowerful for its time, but an utter nightmare to develop 3D games for. On \ntop of that, Sega didn't even have time to develop any good tools and \ngraphics libraries to give their developers an easier time to make 3D \ngames. Yu Suzuki only had 2 weeks to develop a port of Virtua Fighter, and \nit was simply atrocious. It had glitchy graphics, minimal polygons and ran \nat an inconsistent framerate. Thanks to it, however, the system sold out on \nits first day, and the Saturn would remain more popular than the \nPlayStation in Japan for a few more months. The PlayStation took over in \nsales eventually, but the Saturn would still remain popular thanks to the \nrelease of more refined arcade ports and RPGs.\n\nIn America, the hype was real, as Sega had been the dominant console \nmanufacturer. Tom Kalinske announced the system would be released on \n\"Saturnday\" September 2nd, 1995. Nakayama demanded that Sega of America \nsneak the system on the shelves of select stores, and had Kalinske surprise \neveryone with the announcement that the Saturn had already been released. \n3rd party devs were pissed off by this, and they had already been worried \nabout meeting deadlines. Daytona USA was rushed for the American launch, \nand it was an underwhelming port. Unlike Virtua Fighter with Japanese \ngamers, western audiences took one look at the Saturn's version of Daytona \nUSA, as well as Virtua Fighter, and compared them to the PlayStation \nversions of BA Toshinden and Ridge Racer and began to feel that Sega's \nmachine wasn't powerful enough to compete. It was also 400 dollars, and \nSony, after hearing, announced that the PlayStation would be 300 dollars, \nwowing audiences. Retailers were pissed off at Sega for their little stunt \nand many of them stopped stocking their content altogether. Sega never made \nany attempt to woo them into selling their products, and the Saturn sold at \na handicap in the states because of this. Sega had officially made a bad \nfirst impression of their new console.\n\nBy the end of the year, it was the same price as the PlayStation, and \nproved to be a capable 3D machine with great ports of Sega Rally, Virtua \nCop, and Virtua Fighter 2, which was released in January the following \nyear. Things started to look up for the console. And then it happend... \nSega made the move that would burry them as a console manufacturer: they \nhired Bernie Stolar, after Sony fired his ass.\n\n Rather than fire him like Sony did when it quickly became apparent that he \nwas utterly incompetent, they PROMOTED him to COO. The marketing for the \nsystem was practically non-existent by 1997, with Stolar constantly pissing \noff 3rd parties with his asinine policies. And then he bitch-slapped \nconsumers and developers by announcing that the Saturn would be \ndiscontinued. He did this at e3, as Sega was showing off games... Third \nparty devs were annoyed that they had wasted their time developing for a \nconsole soon to be dead, and consumers lost faith in Sega as a hardware \nmanufacturer. Stolar actively worked to kill the Saturn in the states, to \nput pressure on SoJ to finish and release \"Katana\" as soon as possible. \nThis damaged Sega's reputation and bleed their wallets damn near dry. A \nyear and a half later, the Dreamcast was released in the US to great sales, \nbut as time went on those sales dwindled. The diehards were the main ones \nwho bought the Dreamcast, as the masses wanted to wait and see if Sega \nwould actually be capable of keeping the damn thing alive. We all know how \neverything turned out. Sega was too broke to market the damn thing and seal \ndeals with 3rd party devs like they did in the past, and they were already \nin dept from the Saturn's failure, so they had to discontinue the Dreamcast.\n\nMaybe I'm being too hard on Stolar for putting the final nail in Sega's \ncoffin. After all, SoJ were the ones who hired him. THEY turned their \ncheeks as he was pissing off third parties and ALLOWED him to prematurely \ndiscontinue the system. THEY hired him in the first place, and promoted him \nfor his \"excellent work.\"\nOne things for sure: Sony didn't kill Sega, nor did Nintendo. They killed \nthemselves with retarded management.",

Meanwhile, Sony was hesitant to even continue development with \nthe PlayStation, but went ahead anyway and finished developing it. The \nresult was mind-boggling, and it went on to be the most influential CD-ROM \nbased system of all time.\n\nReleased in 1995, the Sony PlayStation was a huge success, with the \nCD-ROM-based games able to hold up to 700MB of data on a single disc, and \ncode them in a way to continue games on more than one disc, it was a great \nway to sell many games and give third parties the opportunity to put their \nwildest dreams to the test. Then we got games like Spyro the Dragon, Crash \nBandicoot, Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and Tactics, the Digimon World series, \nJade Cocoon, the Klonoa series, just to name a few of some of the most \nsuccessful franchises, and the ones that have become cult classics.\n\nSo to put it bluntly, this wasn't a marketing mistake by Sony, it was a \nmarketing mistake by Nintendo. If Nintendo hadn't made that little side \ndeal with Philips, then Nintendo would've been considered even more so as \nthe most influential gaming company on the planet; Pokemon would be a lot \nbigger than it is today (both fan-base wise and game-wise), Castlevania \nwould probably still be exclusive to Nintendo consoles, Metroid games would \nprobably keep Samus as not a whiny bitch who complains all the time, and so \non and so forth.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who grew up mainly with the PlayStation as \na kid. In fact, I still have my original copies of the Crash Bandicoot \ntrilogy, and a whole bunch of games that have survived almost 15-20 years \nof abuse (Geez, that long already?), and some of them have survived it, but \nsome have to be purged... I still play on the GameCube, GBA, Nintendo DS, \nand even the Wii, but I get my fix for PS1, PS2, PS3, and sometimes even PC \nand emulation so I can relive my childhood. I don't think it matters \nwhether a game is on a computer screen or on a television screen five feet \naway from you, what matters is the influence and impact it has on you, the \nplayer, and how it affects your taste in games, and what console team you \nbat for. Just remember to bring up those CD-i games every now and then.",

Kmart closed 5 Montreal stores and several other Quebec \nstores in 1983 due to the company restructuring. However, as a result of \nKmart's ongoing financial difficulties, the Canadian division comprising \n112 stores was sold to competitor Zellers of the Hudson's Bay Company in \nMay 1998, after which the stores were either closed or converted to \nHudson's Bay Company brands, mostly Zellers. A store in Saint-Laurent, \nQuebec (now Montreal) became a Canadian Tire instead because of the mall \nthat used to house Kmart already having a Zellers. (from Wikipedia \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kmart#Canada.2C_Europe.2C_Mexico.2C_Australia_and_New_Zealand_stores\n)\n\n\nAlso, Walmart came along only in 1994, after Woolco decided to sell their \nCanadian stores to walmart to pay debts.",
