                "text": "This is a super interesting study. I'm Irish, and have a few things to say. \nThis is a super cultural thing. I mean 6 drinks in Ireland is not \nconsidered anywhere near a binge. It's not even close. I was in the pub \nlastnight with my Grandfather, Aunt, Her Partner, The Publican & His wife, \n a couple I know from Dublin and another guy. We each ordered drinks in the \nround, over 4 hours everyone from my Granddad to me had over 10 drinks. And \nthat pub was full. I wouldn't do it every week, I mean I could go months \nand just not bother going to the pub (public house), but the scary point to \nmake hear isn't that 10 drinks in my local pub isn't considered excessive, \nwhen I tell my friends (22-26 years old) I was out for drinking, the fact I \ndidn't go out to a night club or disco-bar means it doesn't even count as \ndrinking. So when I hear that Cenk considers 6 to be alot, man I gotta \nthink- is the super-lib approach the Irish take to drinking seriously \naffecting the health of the entire nation?\n\nAlso, on the women stats in Ireland. I'm calling Bullshit straight outta \nthe gate on that one. Every woman I see in the shop has like 2/3 bottles of \nwine in their trolley. That's just the older ones, girls in college over \nhear drink phenomenally larger amounts of alcohol than their contemporary \nmales. I think it's again a hugely cultural thing, like over here in \nIreland when a guy can afford to go out and drink every weekend, especially \nin rural Ireland, it's worn as a badge of honour of sorts. Whereas there is \ndespite our super-lib approach, a stigma attached to women over a certain \nage being seen to be drinking, either at home or in public, without an \n\"occasion to do so.\" \n\nI just find 56% such an amazingly high number, I wonder if you measured \nrelative to each nations average consumption per drinker, and then measure \nthe number of people drinking in excessive of the median, would you get a \nmuch different number? The only conclusion I can come to is that \nculturally, 6 drinks in one sitting (taking the average visit to the pub to \nbe about 4-5 hours, it's 1.5, there or about, and hour) in Ireland, isn't \nconsidered outrageously much by anyone in all honesty. \n\nSorry about the long-winded post, I just think this is an unreal number, \nbut still when I think about it, it doesn't even come close to surprising \nme. Our approach to drinking in this country is so laid back, it's actually \na bit scary in context. \ufeff",

                    "text": "+My real name is I AM  I'm curious as to how you done your math exactly. I \nhate to be the bearer of bad news, but your calculations are off son. \nThis probably happened because you didn't take into consideration all the \naspects of the situation. To accurately estimate how many binge drinkers \nare in America, there are several things you have to remember... 1. How \nmany people are in America, 2. How many Americans are adults, 3. How many \nAmericans drink, 4. How many Americans are men (and how many are women), \nect. (See paragraph 3)\n\nI got all of my statistics from the United States Census Bureau, The \nNational Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and this video. Before \nI go any further I want to make a valid point, ALL STATISTICS ARE BULLSHIT! \nPeriod! It doesn't matter whether it's the Young Turks, the US \ngovernment, The Statistics that I am about to use, ect, they are all \nbullshit. How do I know this? Let me answer that with a question... Did any \nmen in black suits pull up to your door and ask if you were a binge \ndrinker??? No?? Then how do they know the percentage of ALL Americans that \nare binge drinkers if they didn't question ALL Americans??? Truth is, ALL \nstatistics are based on so many people (like 70,000 or so) then they place \nthose statistics across the whole country. So if they happened to test \nthese questions in an area with high alcoholism rates, it may appear that \nmany Americans are binge drinkers, when not near as many Americans drink as \nwhat is concluded in the results. Some statistics may be more accurate than \nother, but until they poll EVERY SINGLE PERSON the results are ALWAYS going \nto be BULLSHIT. So although the statistics I'm about to use are not \ncompletely accurate, they are the best we have, so here you go.\n\nThere are 311,116,000 people in the United States according to the census \nbureau. 74,187,000 people are under 17; 193,642,000 people are between ages \n18 to 64; and 43,287,000 people are 65 and older. That leaves with \n236,929,000 people over the age of 18. 114,448,000 of these are male, \n122,482,000 are female (48.3% male, 51.69% female) . The NIAAA concluded \nthat 71% of people 18 and older reported that they drank in the past year; \n56.3% reported that they drank in the past month. Cenk said that anyone who \nhas drank any alcohol in the past year qualifies as a drinker, therefore \n71% of everyone 18 and older is a drinker. So since 168,219,590 people 18 \nyears or older drank in the past year, they are considered drinkers. Going \nby the stats (48.3% of US adults being male, & 51.69% female), that means \n77,885,670.17 men drink and 86,952,706.07 women drink at least once a \nyear. So if 13% of the men drinkers (and 3% of women drinkers as mentioned) \nare binge drinkers then 10,125,137.1 adult men and 2,608,581.18 adult women \nare binge drinkers, or just short of 13 million American adults. \n12,733,718.28 is less than 4% of the population, and instead of being more \nthan 1 in every ten Americans (like you thought), it is actually less than \n1 in 20 Americans.
