With a population of just over 500,000 I \nfound the chance to make a name for myself. At the age of sixteen I found \nan opportunity to trial for a scholarship with NSR Australia. I went to the \ntrials, got through furthered into an interview which then cleared me. I \nwas given the full scholarship to play for a team in the US while getting \nmy degree in Architecture. Summary of my experience, there is ALWAYS an \nopportunity around, no matter where you live! Head up man I'm sure if \nyou're passionate enough something great will come!",
