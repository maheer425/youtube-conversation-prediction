Even Gandhi only fasted for 21 days at a time before \neating something proper again at the most...not 40 like you have mentioned \nyou want to do! As for Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha), he was fasting to the \npoint of almost dying and was in pain doing it. Sure, he reached \nenlightenment, but you may do it incorrectly and actually die. That's not \nthe way to go! We're not supposed to suffer in pain from starvation just to \nreach some horrific goal weight!\n\nYour body is wasting away with your routine...it's not weight loss in the \ncorrect sense. Unless you actually want to live and look like those in \npoverty who are literally dying for food, I think you're seriously going \nthe wrong way about weight loss.\n\nYou are supposed to eat and poop! You want a laxative effect without buying \nrandom crap? *eat more fruit and vegetables* to cleanse your digestive \nsystem each day. You're still not getting all the necessary requirements \nyour body needs and I'm no dietician! Where's your iron coming from? \nWhere's your source of calcium too? Heck, I have a blood disorder which \nmakes it impossible for me to absorb iron properly in any way. It could \nbuild up and kill me if I take iron supplements but you're intentionally \nskipping so much important nutrition that your body NEEDS.\n\nHonestly, if you don't change your routine now, you are going to end up in \nhospital critically ill (and forced to eat until back at a healthy weight) \nor worse, you will die before getting there...and honestly, I don't want \nthat to ever happen to you. For goodness sake, just eat!\n\nSeriously, I'm sure you're taller and weigh less than me.

I'm getting tired of people \nsaying it's for attention, especially if they haven't faced it themselves. \nSure, there are some people who brag about their problems on a daily. But \nthen there's those people who want help desperately but don't know how to \nget it, or just don't have anyone to help them. But people saying it's \nmerely for attention makes them scared to reach out.. Anorexia and Bulimia \nkill, there's no way around the health problems and mental problems they \ncause. They're both just as deadly having experienced both. They both slow \ndown the metabolism, they cause you to become weak and dizzy, they do \nimmense damage to the heart and organs. I've come close to death a few \ntimes because of it, yet I still didn't stop but for a while. Because when \nyou're too far in you don't think about the consequences, although they're \nalways in the back of your mind creeping up every once in a while just to \nfreak you out.. It's nothing to do with others anymore, it's a battle with \nyourself. The thoughts never cease to exist, even in recovery.. Which leads \nto overwhelming fear and anxiety.. If not a relapse.. No one would go \nthrough this for attention.. Especially when the only \"attention\" it ever \nreally brings is comments such as \"You're dying.\" And if you don't, a life \nsentence of your mind..",

I'm just heavy for my height.\nI'm also the same when it comes to realising I'm significantly heavier than \nmany friends roughly the same height as me. I'm about 10kg heavier in some \ncases but we have very similar figures. The only significant difference \nbetween our lifestyles with my friends is that I do martial arts several \ntimes a week. It's also the reason my partner who is a very similar height \nto you weighs over 90kg.\nHe now gets classed as a hyperweight at tournaments and I'm a middleweight. \nFor our heights, normally we would fit with the weight class below us and \nhe did when he first started a few years ago.\nIt's great that you were able to gain some weight again though and that you \nare body building. I know how difficult it can be to put weight back on \nafter a difficult phase of life!\n\n\nBut also, like I said...I wasn't having a go at you. I just can't believe \nhow small the (minimum) weight is for a height so much taller than me.",
