                "text": "The United State voting population has overwhelmingly supported the \nPatriots Act, which does allow for increased surveillance. If Edward \nSnowden believed that this document was unconstitutional then he should \nhave leaked the relevant information to a select few lawyers and judges you \nspecialize in constitutional law. Instead he totally waived the democratic \nprocess of the American people and released this information to \njournalists, he then also released information on American spying on \nforeign countries, a completely sane and legal thing to do which all other \nnations themselves are participating in, hugely damaging Americas \ndiplomatic ties with other nations. He also, by releasing this information, \nhas allowed actual Islamic extremists and terrorists to effectively drop \noff the grid and has greatly reduced the ability of the security agencies \nto Identify and keep watch on those who actually want to do great harm to \nthe American population and the populations of other non-Islamic nations as \nwell. Perhaps the final act of betrayal was his decision to flee to China, \na nation with has a much stronger surveillance program on it's population \nnot to mention it's innumerable list of human rights abuses and lack of \ndemocracy and then to flee to Russia a nation which has decided to \ncriminalize homosexuality, curtail freedom of speech and has illegally \ninvaded a peaceful democratic nation.\nIt also launched an illegal war against Georgia in 2008. That is why, \nEdward Snowden is a traitor.\ufeff",

Get real. \nHe is a patriot and a very brave man. So in one post the man mentions \nRussia and China so he has to be louse for that reason. Guilt by \nassociation.
