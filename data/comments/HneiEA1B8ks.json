As time went on we \nstarted to understand a bit more about science, nature, and many more \nthings, slowly proving what you guys had made up about a god, wrong.\nNow i ask you religious people, Where did god come from? Where is heaven \nlocated in this PROVEN universe? We may not be able to explain things yet, \nbut have u guys ever?\nIm not hating on religion but i am hating on how you guys are so blind. You \nprove things by saying \"The bible says it\" well, the bible has no proof \nbehind it, and quite frankly, the bible is only made up of atoms and that \nhas been proven\ufeff",

You have to look \nat the context of that story, if you are curious, you can check here \nhttp://christianthinktank.com/qmeanelisha.html. God punished not only them, \nbut their parents, who diverted from God and turned to worshipping many \nidols. They did not raise their children God-fearing and respectful to his \nprophets, and to other people. God cut their lives short also to avoid \ngreater evilness they would do if they grew up. However, that story \nhappened if the Old Testament, when people were different and other \nmeasures might not have worked, so such bitter lessons were taught. We live \nin the New Testament time, when the whole relationship between humans and \nGod is different. God does not need to appear like a punisher and have \npeople follow him out fear, like it was in the Old Testament, when people \nwere more primitive, but revealed his love to the world, and wants us to \nfollow him out of love.\n\nGod is never angry, God is  love, and everything he does is out of love. He \ndoes not want us to suffer forever in hell, that is why he uses different \nmeasures to turn us on a righteous way in our short lives, that will lead \nus to Heavenly Kingdom and eternal bliss after death. What kind of loving \nmother will feed her kid with sweets and chocolates to keep a child happy \nfor a while, if she knows it will lead to child's sickness and suffering in \nthe future? However, God cannot force anyone into Heaven. If a person does \nnot want, even God cannot save him.\n\nWith all that said, God's ways are miraculous and often are hidden from our \nunderstanding, because we do not see a greater scheme of things. We all \nhave God's voice within us, though, which is our conscience, and behave \naccording to how our conscience tells us to. We all look for beauty, \nkindness, love, fairness, forgiveness. Let's hope that everybody hears that \nvoice, and then our world will become a much better place to live, without \nwars, terrorists and immoralities.  ",

They have also proven these Birkeland Current \nconnections between Saturn and its moons, Mars and Its moons as well as the \nother Bodies and the Moons that orbit them, as they themselves orbit the \nSun. Locked not in a Gravitic Orbit as proposed by these fools you let lie \nto you, but by the ElectroMagnetic Connections between them...\n\nYou are Far far behind the curve young man.  You had better get your head \non right and start looking at Plasma Physics and its Lab Tested Results \nthat prove without a Doubt, the Universe is not a Vacuum, but is filled \nwith Electricity called the Aether, just as Nikola Tesla proved at the turn \nof the 20th century, over 100 yrs ago now.... \n\n\nBesides, if you actually believe Einstein thought his THEORY(read that as \nNEVER YET PROVEN BY ANY LAB TEST OR ACTUAL TESTS IN SPACE) of Relativity \nwas all there was, you do not know Einstein.  He himself never like it, as \nit had to ELIMINATE the Electrical Nature of Space.\n\nEinstein was asked in the mid 1930s by a Reporter, \"Mr. Einstein, how does \nit feel to be the Smartest Person on Earth?\", to which Albert Einstein most \naptly replied, \"I do not know, you will have to ask the good Dr. Tesla for \nthat answer.\"",

Specific Gasses being Highly Excited \nwith High Levels of Energy=, which are in a state of constant Flux, create \nthat Perceived Shift in the Red Spectrum they want YOU to believe is a \nmeasure of Distance.  Sorry, it just is what it is.\n\nSo, if you want to continue to be fooled by the Tier B Scientists that have \nbeen lied too most of their life as well, that is your choice, but One only \nneeds to do their own Research, and be at least not a dumb fuck, to \nunderstand how this little \"Trick\" works.

God? no, dark \nmatter and energy. however you should have explained the big bang theory. \ndark matter picked up when they used the theory to predict the age of the \nuniverse. they where waaaay off (~1 billion years was a bit too young). so \ndark matter became a convenient smudge to readjust energy-mass equations. \nyeah.. but a wild guess is always a wild guess and reality is always a bit \nwilder that is why we have suns in our galaxy 4 times older than the big \nbang. i find hard to swallow both of them at the same time. dark energy is \nsomething exactly like dark matter. an easy explanation for something we \ncannot understand.\n\npoint being, dark matter and dark energy are like greek epicycles, fitting \nthe description of an earth centered universe. point, the big bang theory \n(the mathematical father of both therms) has failed every single prediction \nin it's initial form, no matter how much we modify it's equations the \ntheory and even the hypothesis is false.\n\nHubble and redshift: there are countless bodies out there which do not \nfollow the graph of Hubble which has trends of spectroscopic data in \ncorrelation with light intensity (i.e. speed and distance). the real data \nis big blob of points, no clear trend, Hubble constant. in my \nopinion Hubble down right forged the data (he got addicted to success). in \nany case, he still has a place in history.\n\napparent redshift: intergalactic particulate matter is good at filtering \nhigh frequency light, bad at filtering lower frequency. in fact that low \ndensity medium can be a conductor for low frequency EM radiation, you can \nobserve the same in acoustics via resonance studies of different materials \nat different lengths.\n\nCMB and the bang: microwave background radiation is contrary to popular \nbelief not a proof of the big bang. the big bang allows for it and that is \njust it. however, it is one of the first failure of the theory. static \nuniverse predictions ranged from 0.75 to 20K. bang prediction putt the \nradiation at about 50Kelvin. well, i will not point out the results, it is \nquite obvious. however, there are allot of re-estimations along the line, \nfitting the theory to the observations and new theories.\n\nfinal point. if a theory needs so many readjusting in order to fit the data \nthat it should be capable to predict then the theory itself is the problem. \nand at this point i seriously tend to think of cosmology as a religion if \nthe big bang does not fall soon. it is a too damn convenient idea. it has \ntoo much resemblance to most monotheistic religions. God created everything \nin 7 days - the big bang created everything in couple of minutes. i don't \nthink there is an able minded person out there who cannot draw a parallel.\n-\nso why do galaxies spin in a mysterious way? mostly because they \nare mysterious. it is frustrating not to know but that in itself is not an \nincentive to make educated guesses and consider it pillars of science. \nnearly 100% (because i am too damn lazy to type so many \"9\"s after the \n\"99.\") of stuff out there is plasma. so, i tend to think in addition to \ngravity, electromagnetism is the main force governing the motion and \nstructure of the universe. in fact, i go as far as to say it is the main \nforce.\n\nso, is the universe a static electromagnetic soup? i do not believe that. \neverything needs a stir to produce complexity, however, is is definitely \nnot as simple as firecrackers in the abyss.\n\n- do not ask for documentation, i am not a whore of other people's mind \neven if i let them inspire me\ufeff",

Why have you not \nthought trough any of your stuff?\n\nNo, that's not how its works :D Try it yourself: the equation does not work \nout ... just as with everything else you claim.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"positive\" or \"negative\" electromagnetc wave \n... look it up or work it out with Maxwell's equations (or QED if you \nprefer).\n\nAgain: what is that C\u00b2 you claim? Is it the speed of light squared? For you \nI hope it's not, since a speed squared is not a speed ...\n\nA ratio between vectors is not defined uniquely in mathematics. Show a \nmathematical definition of what you mean. Do you even have one or did you \njust think ratio sounds cool?\n\nWhat is \"locational 4pi spherical\"?\n\nAnd no, we have known for about 400 years now, that not everything is \nelectromagnetism. Take gravity for instance, or the strong or weak nuclear \nforces ...\n\n\"Vibrating matter is simulating rest and balance now through violent \nmotion\" So what now: rest or motion?\nAnd: evidence please!\n\n\"Antimatter positive electric charge and Matter negative electric charge\" \nNot all antimatter has positve charge and not all matter is negatvely \ncharged. Electric charge is not even the only difference between the two ...\n\n\"profound and perfect symmetry forming and breaking\" There is not a perfect \nsymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. Obviously the \nuniverse is matter dominated. Or have you not noticed that?\n\n\"And when that symmetry is broken forms the imperfect spiral symmetry of \nthe Fibonacci sequence seen everywhere in nature!!!\" That's just nonsense. \nSee my prior messages ...\nThings do not become true because you repeat them (it only makes you look \nstupid ...).\n\nI have to admit: you are really, really bad at math. Let me explain a \nconcept: if you say something is equal, and it's clearly not, then you made \na false statement. In math lingus:\n\"when the left side of an equation is not equal to the right side, then \nyour equation is wrong\".\n\nYou also do not provide a single shred of evidence for anything. You simply \nmake (wrong) claim, after (nonsensical) claim after (simply stupid) claim.\n\nHave you ever looked into a physics book? Performed any experiment? Solved \nany equation? Do you even understand the concept of science?\n\n... obviously not.",

An \nobservable resistance to flow that causes gravitational lensing. Dark \nenergy causes space-time expansion and moves through space time like a \ncold, quantum fluid. This tidal force, like a current of water, affects the \nmovement of objects with mass. The greater the mass an object possesses, \nthe greater the resistance to flow.  Spiral galaxies are where dark matter \nis observed through gravitational lensing. The spiral arms do not fly apart \ndue to this resistance where they stay intact like hurricanes or leaves \nfloating in a liquid whirlpool. Scientists estimate that dark energy \naccounts for approximately 68 percent of what exists (matter and energy) in \nthe known universe. Could such a large percentage of energy be a sort of a \nuniversal engine of the cosmos, affecting everything in its path; and \ncreating motion, gravitational lensing, and dark matter? Dark matter \naccounts for approximately 27 of the mass-energy of the universe. Is it \npossible to have two unknown forces accounting for such a large percentage \nnot be two tied to each other through some cause and effect relationship? \nPerhaps force is a better description since we don't know dark matter as \nactual matter but can only observe its effects.
