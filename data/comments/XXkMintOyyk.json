He \nclaimed that traveling faster than the speed of light would violate the \ncausality principle. For the layman, that means cause and effect. An \nexample of this would be a bullet hitting a target before the trigger was \neven pulled.\n\nAccelerating to light speed or exceeding it would also violate certain \nfundamental energy conditions. It could even allow for time travel.\"\n\nDid I look that up enough for you? The only circumstance where a particle \nor object with mass can travel faster than the speed of light is when the \nuniverse around it is distorted and though it actually isn't faster than \nlight it seems that way to an observer.",

Your argument is not on point, and I have taken both general \nrelativity and special relativity courses, as well as graduate level \nquantum mechanics, so yes...please enlighten me some more. It's fascinating \nas a physicist to know if you have any better mathematical model that you \ncan show me. Your argument between Jesus and mathematics/science is not \neven ideal...science is proven in the lab, and yet being completed. If you \nwant to say otherwise, you must show it.",

However, what you don't understand is that the burden \nof proof is on you. Einstein had proven his theory, and nothing \nscientifically says that you can travel faster than light itself. If you \nbelieve so much in such notion and are convinced that it's the right thing, \nthen you should prove it before saying that c is not the speed limit of our \nuniverse. Apparently, ranging from electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, to \nrelativity, it was proven by theory and experiment that c = constraint of \nour universe. Although you can say that it's just a limited version of the \ncomplete theory of our universe, you have to prove that your facts are \nright before saying otherwise....",

The guy \nsaid she had pulled over and once he got over to her car she had already \npulled the pole out of her head. She doesn't remember any of that. The \ndoctors only let us see her in the hospital because they thought she was \ngoing to die. 8 years later she is still driving past the scene of the \naccident. 45 minute drive to work, working 4-5 days a week, ranging \nanywhere from 40- 60 hour work weeks. She hardly ever gets to take a break \nor lunch at work; thats what happens when you are an assistant manager at \nwalmart, and your boss is doing anything he can to fire you. This woman \nruns on 4 hours of sleep. If that doesn't motivate yuh than you don't \nbelieve it. I don't blame you, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around \nit.\ufeff",

In \nany case, all we're talking about are theories. I would just accept the \nfact that we don't know and keep an open mind, but don't accept things \nwithout evidence. ",

If anything, God created the big bang, but had nothing to do \nwith us specifically. We, over millions of years, have become what we are. \nWe tend to convalute our existence with random, un scientific methods to \nexplain our existence when we have no way to. If God exists, we will not \nhave proof because he lies outside our scope, and we should only rely on \nwhat we can test, science. In any case, I think a god is as likely as no \nGod at all.

He \npretended to be dead and had to remain silent and still faking his death as \nthe native scalped him. After the native left the worker found his scalp \nand walked to the nearest settlement only to learn that they couldn't \nreplace his scalp, so he kept as an oddity and brought it with him to bars \nand similar establishments and he lived a full life after that.

Obviously their succes isn't important to someone who already \nknows, the thing is they come up with the fact that the ones who actually \nput their minds to it in order to ground their evalutations actually got \ncaught up by it... by it I mean actually understanding, science is one of \nthe ways, and it's the way of now.\nI guess offstreamers exist aren't just pure coincidence anymore accoarding \nto their latest theories too.\nneither is the scientific succes in combatting GMO either.",

There are theories that there are multiple universes and it is \nthought the universe is infinite. Both of these are unknowns because there \nis currently no way to test for these other than with arithmetic. Also we \nbelieve that the occupied space in our universe is limited, since there was \na big bang and all matter had a starting point, then everything in the \nuniverse must be centered around that point. Knowing this the universe \ncannot be filled if it is infinite and there is a \"boundary\". Also since \nvision is limited by the speed of light, only certain areas of the universe \ncan be observed so we would not be able to see a boundary whether there was \none or not. Anyways, I do not know a lot on astrophysics and astronomy and \nspace, but if you are going to go on some rant and then support it (with \ninformation that has nothing to do with your argument may I add) then \natleast do your research on the topic and at least be sure what you are \nsaying is actually factual. I am fine with you having an opinion, but it is \nnot an opinion when you pass it off as fact.\n\n I think you should read up on some of Socrates works, maybe it will make \nyou see knowledge and how you perceive it in a new perspective. I don't \nlike looking at it for things that I know are literacies, but I like \nlooking at for things that are theoretical. Think about gravity for \ninstance. We believed Newton's definition for gravity for ~300 years, then \nEinstein comes along and disproves it with the theory of relativity, making \nthe scientific community speechless by disproving what was thought to be \nscientific law.\n\n\u201cThe only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\u201d\n\u2015 Socrates\n\nI just read that you graduated some joke of a school with a degree in \nastrophysics, either you have forgotten much you have learned, you went to \na school where someone dragged you through by your dick, or you are a \ntroll. No matter the fact, what I said above still applies, and if you \ntruly are as educated as you say you are, this is why every other person \nhas to go earn a bachalours degree and those who are have a higher \nintellectual state have to move on to graduate school, because every person \nwho can read and write now is expected to get a degree (such as yourself).",

Even saying that you can accelerate something \nfaster than light, is saying that Einstein's greatest accomplishment of the \nequation E=Mc^2 is wrong, algebraically, if you're saying a particle can go \nfaster than light is saying that E<Mc^2, which is like saying if you buy a \npint of ice cream, you get two, the second appearing out of nowhere.\n    Secondly, particle accelerators exist not to go faster than the speed \nof light, but to input massive amounts of energy into a few hundred protons \nto collide with a piece of a heavy element to reproduce the effects of the \ninitial state of the big bang with the intent to discover novel particles.\n    Thirdly, someone said that the god particle, aka the Higgs' boson, can \ntravel faster than light? We have only discovered this particle in the past \nfew years, it only exists for a brief moment only to evaporate into the \nuniverse's Higgs field. We've never measured its speed, but I can assure \nyou that because it has mass, it will never travel at, or faster, than the \nspeed of light.\n\nAll these things are taught to you in high school; I'm ashamed.",

The article indicates \nthat the universe is *expanding* to the point where it reaches the speed of \nlight. Actually its expanding faster than the speed of light, right now. \nHowever, this does not imply that it breaks the theory of special \nrelativity. If it did, there would be a paradigm shift in physics. That \nhasn't happened. \n\nSpecial relativity states that nothing can move faster than the speed of \nlight *within* the universe. It doesn't stipulate that the universe cant. \nThe article sort of creates a misconception when it states galaxies \nimmensely far away from the Earth are traveling faster and faster; a red \nshift, close to the speed of light.

Do you HAVE or MUST use it?\nDo you even know what it means?

If you're being \nserious, you're probably just some person that grew up with indoctrination \nin his/her life. You're blind and I'm sorry to tell you this. Not in the \nsense of visually, but mentally. You probably grew up knowing nothing else \nbut your so-called God and your Bible and whatnot. Obviously, when a person \ngrows up learning something and nothing else, that person will always use \nit to his/her life. You believe God is the reason for everything but boy \nare you wrong. So much suffering in the world and you still believe in God? \nThe world is filled with rape, murder, molestation, abuse, accidents, \nhunger, poverty, and the list goes on and on. You religious people never \nblame God for this but whenever you hear about people receiving food, or \nbeing sent off to another family after years of abuse, THEN you you say \"Oh \nit was the Lord that helped you\". What about when that certain person \nneeded help in that moment? Why didn't God help that person in that moment? \nDoes a person need to suffer for God to take notice in them? You're \nso-called God either has truly abandoned us all or never even existed. You \npeople only give credit to God for the good things that happen, but then \nwhen bad things happen, you need someone to blame so that's where \"The \nDevil\" comes in, because obviously you can't dare yourself to blame God for \nsomething bad. All religion does is cause War and discrimination within \nourselves like The Crusades, War currently in the East and all over the \nworld. And if you also recall, God promotes Genocide and has killed \nmillions of people as it says in the Bible. As it is also said in the \nBible, Satan even only kills a couple while God kills millions. Religion is \njust an idea Man has created to not feel alone in the universe and just \nanother way to control other people. (If you think about it, It makes \nsense). It's honestly shameful with all the corruption that is going on in \nthe Catholic, Christian, or any other church out there that only want \ncontrol, power and most importantly... money.

                    "text": "I certainly wouldn't presume to explain the many catastrophes that are \npermitted in a realm that we think is overseen by our supreme being, whom \nwe call God.  I can share one story that happened to me in 1991.  My \ndaughter asked that we go to a movie that had recently been released, \n\"Ghost\", in which a young couple, Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, recently \nmarried, were stalked by one of her office mates who was desirous of a \nrelationship with the Demi character.  Thwarted by her recent marriage, her \noffice mate contracted with several villainous acquaintances to murder the \nyoung husband to clear the way for his advances.  The husband, now \ndispatched and on the other side of death, pursued a more talented denizen \nof purgatory (if you will), who had learned how to move small objects still \nin the world of the living.  He amused himself by snapping bottle caps on \nsubway cars to scare riders who could see no means by which they were \nanimated.  The young husband now sets out to warn his young widow to avoid \nthe associate who had arranged for his demise.  He engages Whoopi Goldberg, \na \"charlatan\" seer/fortune teller to help convince his widow of the danger. \n That convincing occurred using the vehicle of running a penny up the \ninside of a closed door, defying gravity in the process.  On our way home \nfrom the feature film, my daughter suggested that since I was 30 some years \nolder than she was, that I would probably die before she would.  She asked \nthat if that eventuality occurred, that I find some way to use pennies to \nlet her know that I'd arrived in Heaven.  I promised that if the talent \ndisplayed by the young husband could be duplicated on the Heaven side of \nthe veil, that I would certainly do it.  My daughter had been stalked by an \nacquaintance who wanted to date her.  She was in the preliminary stages of \nbeing engaged and wanted nothing to do with the young man.  He lured her \naway from my home on the pretext that because she wouldn't date him, he was \ngoing to commit suicide.  Instead of killing himself, he killed her that \nnight.  I was desolated.  Several weeks later I returned to work.  When I \nwas retiring one night, I remembered my promise to use pennies to let her \nknow I was in Heaven.  In my prayers that evening, I asked her to find a \nway to use pennies to let me know that she'd made it all the way to Heaven. \n The very next day I headed off to work at the bank where I was an officer \nwith a designated parking place in their lot.  I went to exit my car, \nextended my leg to put my foot on the ground.  It hit something slippery. \n I looked down to see 13 bright, shiny, brand new pennies laying there.  Of \ncourse, I picked them up.  From that day to today, I've been blessed with \nwelters of pennies.  Before I moved across the country in 2003, I'd \ncollected two, five gallon Hinckley & Schmidt water bottles full of \npennies.  I had not told anyone of the conversation Rachel and I had that \nnight.  I can't imagine that a 17 year old would would tell her friends of \nsuch a conversation she had with her father, and yet the pennies have \ncontinued to pursue me.  I have no choice but to believe that Rachel made \nit.  I have no choice but to believe that God and Heaven exist.  You will \nhave to construct your own belief system based on your own experiences.  I \nhave my proof almost every day.  Good Luck!  RobtheElder  ",

They are killed as \nfood because that's what they are there for, to help man. Tis true lol. the \nbible states that if an innocent is killed, it will go to heaven. And to \nanswer your point about something being created even if it's doomed to die \n(And God knows this) then yes I agree at first it seems strange. Each and \nevery living human was given free will. God does not \"Control\" us, but he \nknows what the outcome will be. For example: God knows a man will kill a \nbaby, but he will create the baby and the man anyway, to give him free \nchoice, because by preventing it, he would be controlling us. So even \nthough he knows all the evil that will happen, he won't stop it because it \nwas our choice :) Hope that made sense idk lols. Have a nice day +\nZengarZanvolt :D",

Few years ago \nwhile praying I asked God, asking whole lot of things about why the world \nis so violent and many people or animal suffering in pain, the answer I \nreceived is trough feeling, immediately I felt tremendous amount of sadness \nand love coming from nowhere that make my tears flow like a river, I \nbelieve it aswered my prayer. God never wish for his/her children to \nsuffer, NEVER, don't blame God. \n\nThrough my spiritual and truth seeking journey all these years, I'm getting \nmore understanding. I'm not really into religion mumbo jumbo as I felt it's \ntoo rigid and close minded for me, there are much more information beyond \nwhat the structured religion hiding from us. This is a planet of freewill, \nbefore you or other people are born, you get to choose your life plan and \nchallenge, what difficulties and suffering would that be when you incarnate \nto be a human. \n\nAnd during life, people make every single choises that affect other living \nbeing and their environment, they have free will and they can do anything \nwith it and of course most people couldn't remember making their life plan \nbefore they came here, higher power cannot intervene for the suffering that \nyou or other people choose yourself troughout your life lessons. I'm also \nalways wondering why even animals have to eat each other? Well, that's a \ngood question, before the earth frequency becoming so low and dense, it was \nan utopia, animals don't eat other animals eons ago, this planet suppose to \nbe a beautiful planet of eden, every single thing is pure and loving. \nBecause of freewill and choises humans make and mostly choose to be a \nrather non-benevolent behaviour it's also take a great part in pulling the \nearth frequency down and affect animals to become more beastly. Perhaps I'm \nwrong, that's the conclusion I've got from my journey of seeking truth. So \nmuch thing we don't know from this side of the veil. Life is a great \nmystery isn't it?\n\nHope that helps abit, good luck and have a wonderful day! Wish you all be \nblessed with love, light and joy!",

In \nanother stroke of luck a grenade landed to my left and a rocket blew out \nthe passenger side rear door and looking at the door I picked it up and \nused it as a shield. The force was so strong it made throw up. Then I \nremembered I had about 6 Semtex grenades (C4 grenades) and 6 regular \ngrenades I swear I threw those shits as far as I could and aimed it to \nwhere I heard the gun shots coming from.... Then I saw a baby tank coming \nback for us, one dude in my baby tank was hit by a damn RPG right his legs \nand he flew maybe 10 feet away from impact. His rib age was ripped open, \nhis guts where half burned , blood oozing out, his top skull crushed in and \nhis legs and one arm ripped off .... I thee 3 flash bangs at enemy \ndirection and got machine gun covering fire from the baby tank that came \nback for us....we must have hit at least 100mph getting the fuck out of \nthere.... As soon as we were at a safe distance I exploded the c4 that was \nleft In the truck ... All in all there was 4 survivors in my truck... That \nwas something I will never forget... \n\nWe went back the next day with at least 100 troops and there was at least \n40 killed by my grenades and the covering fire... \n\nAfter those types of firefights, you know you have to die in the field to \nhave a complete life. \n\nI deploy again in 3 months.
