It is not \nsurprising then that only a few are not resistant to change. Indeed, \ntraditional Filipino thinking styles are to blame for our lack of ability \nto change and to accept the truth. One would think that we somehow prefer \nto stay the way we are than risk being offended by the truth.\ufeff",

Increasing \ntemperature has been linked to heavier and more frequent superstorms. In \nother parts it has led to extreme draught, destroying yields. It also \nendangers a lot of species that are important to many ecosystems we rely \non. Bees f.e. are doing extremely bad and bees are extremely important for \na lot of plants to procreate.\n - Do we humans affect or contribute to climate change in any way? Can we \nchange that and decrease our impact? The majority of scientists agree that \nwe do affect and have a negative impact on climate change.\n\nSo basically, what environmentalists try to do, is raise awareness for \nthese two issues and try to convince people to try to change our impact.\nWhat you, deniers, keep doing is boycotting our efforts. \n\nIf required, I can accept that you don't care. But please stop trying to \nconvince others to not care as well. You're doing no one or no thing a \nfavor.",

For an educated person like \nme, that is so pathetic.  There is a fine line between asking money and \nearning money out of hard work. I think your statement is contradicting. \nYes, the Philippines is a third world country and because of that, our wage \nrate is a little low and that alone is one of the reasons why we work \noverseas. There is no point of argument. And because we are not so much of \na whiner even we clean your toilets after getting a degree, we are in \ndemand all over the world. Should it be held against us then? It's a \nchoice. You can also do that if you like. We leave so we can earn enough \nbecause we do not want to demand what our government cannot provide at the \npresent. We find ways.  We understand sacrifices. Of course we cry when \nsomeone we love dies, who doesn't? We donate what we presently have, we do \nnot give what we can't. We help in our own little ways.\n\n\"If my country were to happen the same way, I would straight away left my \njob and be by their side.\"\n\nSince I am a Filipino, I would not do that. Easy for you to say. What \nhappens after that? Will I let my family eat what was left? The debris? The \ndead bodies? The fear? If we are to do that, what would we become? Savages? \nNo house, no food? Do you think love and happiness will still exist without \nmeeting the needs? We understand the fear, the sacrifices. But that should \nnot stop us from living. That should not stop us from wanting to provide \nthe best for our families who remain. The living. And all these things \nshould not stop us from eating in restaurants. Why? What's the connection \nwith education from all these? Why am I even trying to explain?\n\n\nI understand the confusion. I respect your opinion. Good day Wolfe.",

Even \nexperts were clueless, proof that one meteorologist apparently died when \nshe drowned after she was washed away by the surge. Veteran broadcasters, \nfishermen, farmers, etc. who have year in and out \"tamed\" their response \nand attitude to the regular 30-or-more typhoons per year got the biggest \nshock of their lives when they underestimated the devastating effects they \nwere in for. All the money pouring in are useless unless they sre used to \npurchase food and supplies. Many gov't agencies advanced their stocks of \nrice, noodles, canned goods etc. to these places, They can't find those \nafter the storm! And those who kept their stocks didn't have volunteers to \nrepack and distribute. No cops, no firemen, no workers, nothing. Even they \nwere victims, or maybe dead too.\n\nI'm pissed at all these blaming, most of it coming from Filipinos \nthemselves. If they could only grow a little more brain and try to \nunderstand the humongous difficult task ahead amid the havoc then maybe, we \ncan go forward faster and rise again as a stronger nation, more resilient, \nmuch wiser, more compassionate, more mature.",

Also the Activity within \nthe Earths core changing the Magnetic field every so often and effects \nevery thing else including animals. These patterns have been going on for \nmillions of years, WAY before Humans came to make pollution in the first \nplace. AND Today, the Earth Still release its own Green house gas from \nvents on the ocean floor...FACT look it up, It is the Truth. But I am not \nsaying Humans are not responsible for any damage at all.

For example, when I first came here in the US, someone \ncalled me \"what's up fool\" and I told her not to call me \"fool\". at first I \nwas offended and I didn't know that what she said was like \"what's up bro\".\n\nSeriously, not all people in other countries know what you guys mean. So \ndon't be stereotyping races and don't call Filipinos dumb. Cause you're \ndumb enough not to realize that Filipinos and people in other countries \nhave DIFFERENT cultures. You got that punk?

Most \neveryone else who is not aware of the bigger picture, is an equal \ncontributor. Also, we cannot continue to rely on others to make the changes \nnecessary to fix things. Our whole system is broken. We must first begin at \nthe personal level, with ourselves, then, work our way forward from there, \nbut, only after we have made changes within our own lives that align with \nour values and principles. Tell me, everyone, how much are your daily food \nchoices contributing to climate change? Do you eat animal 'products'? Do \nyou eat a lot of packaged foods? Do you purchase bottled water? Do you buy \na lot of food and/or non-food products stored in plastics and boxes? When \nyou shop for groceries, do you use the plastic bags provided by the stores, \nor, do you use bio-degradable and compostable, re-usable bags? How much \nconsumerism do you contribute to in your lives? How much waste do you \ncontribute to in your lives? Do you use up unnecessary amounts of \nelectricity, by not turning off lights in rooms you aren't in, or leaving \nother electronics on, when not in use? What about water? Do you use only \nwhat you need, or are you wasteful? Do you keep the water running the \nentire time you are in the shower? Do you leave it running while brushing \nyour teeth, or washing your hands, when it is unnecessary to do so? How \nmuch about the effects of the way we live as individuals within modern, \ndeveloped society, exactly, are all of you unaware of? Unless you have done \nvery, very thorough research, have looked closely at the way you live on a \nday-to-day basis, have considered the situation earnestly, and, are doing \neverything in your power to reduce your own impact on the climate in your \npersonal lives, then, I'm sorry if it upsets you, but, you're not much \nbetter than those you are inaccurately laying all of the blame on.\n\nEveryone, and, I mean EVERYONE, needs to seriously reflect on the way they \nlive, then, make the changes necessary in their personal lives to \ncontribute as little as possible and practical, their solitary \ncontributions to our collective impact on the climate, overall.\n\nAs a humanitarian, environmentalist, and vegan, I see the bigger picture, \nquite clearly, and I live a very frugal existence, for the betterment of \nall, which is something we all should be doing. Steps must be taken to \nreduce our impact on the climate in ALL areas of our lives, and, we must \neducate people on the leading human-caused effects on the climate, as well \nas teaching the importance of living more in balance with our Earth's \nnatural systems, and reducing our impact on the environment as much as \npossible. If you are so against what the so- called 'rich', the \ncorporations, and those who work in government are doing to negatively \nimpact our climate, then, you need to look at how you may be contributing \nto climate change yourselves, and, change your lifestyle accordingly to \nmatch your values. Otherwise, your words are empty, meaningless, and, you \nare wasting your time. If you are not sincere, don't act as if you are, \nand, if you aren't in this for others, and are mostly just concerned with \nyour own well being, and the well being of those you hold closest to you, \nemotionally, then you need to reflect on your mindset. Let's stop the \nnonsense and get our acts together, people! We've got a lot of work to do!",

The Filipinos \ngo to other countries so they will have more opportunities to help their \nfamilies back home.  I have not seen any Filipino that do not regularly \nsend whatever extra they have of their earnings to the Philippines.  Before \nyou judge, ask a Filipino how many times in a year they send money home, \nhow many times they send packages in big boxes, how many relatives they are \nsupporting and paying for college education.  Then get data from the \nPhilippine government how much remittance they get from these Filipino \noversees workers and how these remittances have helped in the country's \neconomy.  These Filipinos suffer insults and discrimination (some even \nmaltreatment) from their employers and from ignorant and self-righteous \npeople like you and blogger Toben Lichtenhagen.  Yet, they persevere \nbecause they know that it is the only way they can give their relatives \nback home a better life.",
