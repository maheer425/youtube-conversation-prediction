Remember correlation doesn't equal causation, if you \ncan't eliminate or at least mitigate all of the other variables in the \nclimate equation when you are conducting your experiments, then you can't \nconclusively say that it was variable A rather than variable B (or C, D, E, \nF, and variables we don't even know of) that produced whatever outcome.\n\nThis problem gets worse when we try to create computer models to predict \nwhat will happen. We don't even fully understand what all of the variables \nare in the climate system, how can we hope to include all variables in a \ncomputer model of this system? Even if we did mitigate all the variables, \nthe results that the model produces depend heavily on the programmed \nsensitivity to changing conditions, and to positive and negative feedbacks. \nThese issues all arise without even questioning the data itself that is \nplugged into the model, and the IPCC data is indeed questionable.\n\nYou can label them as political if you want, but my comments have been much \nmore focused on the reliability of the data and the models used by the \nIPCC. My arguments have been from a scientific and data analysis standpoint \nmore than a politics standpoint, and you failed to actually address any of \nthe points I brought up. What is the IPCC basing it's conclusion that \nhumans are causing global warming off of if not computer models? If they \ncan't \"travel through time\" to collect data, on what data are they basing \nsuch conclusions?\n\nAlso, I never placed blame on the US government or any specific government, \nthough the US government is complicit in perpetuating the idea that science \nis a popularity contest.",

                    "text": "+rek0v3r Let me first start by saying that I don't believe these are \ntheories, they are IN FACT theories, just like Special Relativity is just a \ntheory and Gravity is just a theory. This is part of the problem I have the \nwith AGW fervor, you can't claim that you are practicing sound science, and \nthen claim that you are positive beyond any doubt in the same breath, the \ntwo are mutually exclusive.\n\n \"Something that has never happened in such a short period of time void of \na cataclysmic event...\" Which is exactly my point, where is the empirical \ndata that shows such rapid rises in CO2 cause rapid rises in global \ntemperatures. The cases where there have been such rapid rises in CO2 have \nbeen coupled with extreme catastrophe that have thrown all sorts of other \nvariables into the climate equation, so how can you pin down CO2 as the \ncause for any ensuing climactic shifts? By the same token, we have no \nbaseline to judge what will happen with a rapid rise in CO2 that lacks \nthose other catastrophic events. I have only seen computer models that \nextrapolate what happens at this point, we don't have anything empirical to \ngo off of, so saying that we know what is happening for certain based off \nof the models the we created assumes that we accounted for all of the \nvariables throughout the entire Earth's climate and created accurate models.\n\nI have no great love for oil companies like you imply, I just don't see why \nwe should alternatively trust information pushed by companies and \ngovernments that are just as corrupt. Mind you, I am not deriving any \nskepticism from data that I have seen perpetuated by oil companies, my \nskepticism comes from looking at the data and claims of people who say that \nhumans are indeed causing global warming, like the IPCC reports. The \nconclusions drawn by the IPCC are based on computer models, not empirical \nobservation. Their temperature readings and tree core samples which are \n\"empirical\" have been shown to be selectively chosen, and the temperature \nreadings subject to things like the heat island effect. I live in Tempe, \nArizona right next to ASU. On their campus is one of the temperature \nreading stations used in the IPCC reports, I have visited it, and it is in \nthe middle of a black asphalt parking lot with a chain link fence around \nit, and the temperature probe is maybe 5 feet from the ground. On a hundred \ndegree (F) day, that parking lot easily gets up to 110-115.\n\nI can't wait until clean and abundant energy sources are made cheap and \nefficient enough for everyone to utilize them without having to mix \npolitics and science by having governments subsidize such technologies. \nUnfortunately what we have now are expensive technologies subsidized and \npushed by governments that aren't very efficient, and that frequently end \nup putting all sorts of nasty stuff into the environment themselves. The US \neconomy and the stability and safety of the nation and it's populace is \nentirely dependent on fossil fuel. This is not a desirable situation, but \nit is a fact, and it is one that I would like to see changed as soon as \npossible. The problem still remains though that we can't simply drop oil, \nit will have to be a gradual process of replacing all of the infrastructure \nof the entire country. It should be done through free market capitalism and \na desire for the populace to willingly buy into it. Also, for the record I \ndon't support any government subsidization of any private company including \nwhen government covers the risk for exploratory drilling, subsidizes any \nproduct, or bails out any company or bank.",

I only want to correct \nyou on your comments of abrahamic religion. rest all things you can discuss \nwith others. If only belive in the old testament. Some animals are good to \neat, and if i have an opportunity to eat them, i will eat them. You should \nnot try to stop me or teach me about it. I have a belief that eating beef \nand lamb is healthy for me and nutritious too. You can go vegan as you \nlike, but come preaching to me.",
