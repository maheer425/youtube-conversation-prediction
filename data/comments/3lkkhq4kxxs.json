Never mind the \ngrammar mistake, how can you say that s/he wasn't told that? Unless you can \nprove you were there, you cannot make that claim. You then go on to provide \nan excuse for the psychiatrist, which once again you can't prove the \nintentions of if you weren't there.\n\nNo matter WHAT, you do not tell someone to kill themselves, never mind how \nto do it successfully. ESPECIALLY if you're a psychiatrist. You're trusted \nto fix people's problems, not encourage them. Also, \"How can you hold that \non him. [sic] Maybe you are still alive because of him (partly).\" Now \nyou're blaming the victim for being upset about a trusted professional who \ntold them how to kill themselves? And the 'maybe' could be true, but you \nhave no clue about that. Even so, that statement kind of undoes all the \nwork he did... or at least had the potential to.

Past that if the criminal proves mentally sound they get the \noption of being euthanized or to seek rehabilitation through the means of a \nlife sentence, and if the criminal is not mentally sane we should avoid \nkilling them (because I personally see no reason in harming our sick) and \nput them into a criminal asylum (not 100% sure of what those are called) \nand use their condition to learn from in order to help people who have the \nsame thing as the criminal.  Personally I'm highly against capital \npunishment (thank god Im Canadian) and feel that people are capable of \ndoing bad things, and following that logic people do do bad things.  I feel \nvery strongly that in order for a society to advance we need to eliminate \nthe forced euthanization of criminals, but hey that's not gonna happen any \ntime soon so until then we are stuck here with governments that kill off \ntheir citizens instead of trying to use them for the better of the people.

You say they \ndon't have enough \"real problems\" in their life to be depressed, but guess \nwhat, depression doesn't make sense. It's a medical condition that results \nin severe self loathing and dark thoughts, even when life is otherwise \ngoing smoothly. And when you basically tell them that they're not allowed \nto feel that way, it just makes them feel guilty about it, and then more \ndepressed. The biggest thing perpetuating depression is feeling guilty \nabout it.\nAlso, I've known people from all kinds of backgrounds who have suffered \nfrom depression. The oppression olympics is a petty competition only used \nto shut out and ignore other peoples' problems. Yes, racism is a terrible \nthing that is far more prevalent in society than most want to admit, but \nyour oppression is not a competition.",
