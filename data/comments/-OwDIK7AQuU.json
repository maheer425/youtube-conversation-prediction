I can't speak for inter-reptile \nsocialization but I know Red Foots are very social with humans. Whenever my \ngirl, Tortellini, sees me outside her enclosure she hurries over to say hi. \nIf I open the door she does her best to climb over the lip of the cage and \ninto my lap. Even when I pull her out and set her on the ground, sometimes \nshe'll explore but usually she likes to hang out right by me. She'll even \nignore her freshly filled food bowl at times because she'd rather get some \nattention. Many types of tortoises are like this with their owners but tend \nto get territorial with other tortoises, Red Foots are an exception and \nwill frequently get along with other Red Foots sharing their enclosure. \nHopefully that gives you an idea on how social they can be, as to why, I \nthink it gives them something interesting to do. Interaction with another \ncreature is more interesting then being by yourself, especially if it's a \nhuman that tends to give you tasty food or shell scratches. And yes, they \nabsolutely love getting their shell scratched in certain spots, \nparticularly around the back end (like Jessie demonstrated) and around the \nfront. Mine will stop whatever she's doing, press into my hand, and dance \nfrom foot to foot, rubbing her shell back and forth. I'm guessing Yucca \nusually does the same (many do) she just wasn't feeling up to demonstrating \nin the video. I frequently use a toothbrush instead of my fingers/nails and \nthen she'll really dance against it. If she wasn't enjoying it then she'd \neither give no reaction or walk away. It feels good to them though because \nthe areas between their scutes is where new shell growth is added and new \ngrowth tends to be itchy. Since a tortoise can reach around and scratch \ntheir shell themselves they need to find something to rub against. As for \nreinforcing or warning gestures, typically if they like something they will \nstop whatever they're doing (walking, sleeping, eating) and hurry as fast \nas their little legs can carry them over to what they want, bulldozing over \nanything in their way. If they don't like something they'll either walk \naway or pull into their shells, making a hissing noise as they quickly \nexhale all the air in their lungs to make room like Jessie said.
