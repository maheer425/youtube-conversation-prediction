I \ndon't understand why people don't do anything when they see a red squiggly \nline under their words. That red line means that the word is spelled wrong. \nPeople on the internet these days are so retarded because they have no \nutter sense of spelling or grammar. It's ridiculous that people are so \nignorant, and illiterate when  it comes to spelling and grammar. I hope you \nunderstand your mistake and fix it because this is unacceptable, you \nignorant little turd.  ",
