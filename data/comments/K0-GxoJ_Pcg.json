Overall this \nhas more to do with mass and density than just volume, so that's also \nlargely dependent on the composition of the planet. If we are to consider \nthe extremes, such as a planet that's extraordinarily large but also made \nof particularly light materials and a star that's extraordinarily small but \nnonetheless has enough mass to be a star, you could potentially get a \n'normal' planet that has a larger volume than the smallest 'normal' star, \nbut I'm not sure.\n\nI don't think there's any general scientific consensus on what it is, but \nwhat could decide when a planet becomes a star would depend on a mass \nthreshold, how massive a celestial body must be before nuclear fusion \nstarts to occur at the core. Jupiter is nowhere near this threshold, even \nthough its composition is similar to what a star's would be, and we have \nfound planets 10 times the size of Jupiter (planets larger than this are \ndebated over whether they are planets or brown dwarfs) that obviously \naren't stars. The mass threshold is also likely dependent on the \ncomposition of the body in question, as an overabundance of heavy elements \nI believe makes nuclear fusion more difficult, but most gas giants are \ncomprised almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, the most common elements.\n\nThere are celestial bodies that fall just within or just short of the mass \nthreshold for internal fusion, and become the aforementioned brown dwarfs. \nThey're not really considered stars as enough combustion occurs for the \ndwarf to radiate some energy, but does not have stable internal fusion. \nSince they're not really considered planets either, they're sort of a class \nof their own.\n\nThe conclusion I draw from the scientific debate whether the extrasolar \nplanet almost 30 times more massive than Jupiter is a brown dwarf (most \nmassive planet discovered) is that if you go a bit further, you get a \nfull-fledged star. Perhaps when a body is about 85-90 times more massive \nthan Jupiter (the upper limit of brown dwarfs' mass is 75-80, so beyond \nthat point they achieve sufficient internal fusion to be a main sequence \nstar)? It would still be a very small and cool star, but it would be \nconsidered a main sequence star. Even then it would be nowhere near the \nsize of the sun either in volume or mass, so I would say it's impossible \nfor a planet to be the size of the sun.",

Yeah just live your life the way you want and as for you \ntelling on adults, it's no big deal I did that too. I think it's \nold-fashion to tell on adults but what could you do right. As for the \nbullies, I usually don't have a problem with them because *sigh* I've BEEN \nthem (I'm both ashamed and not ashamed to tell that cause I really learned \na valuable lesson from it both good and bad). And the best advice I can \ntell you when you ran out of witty comebacks to crack your bully's \nself-esteem is to just walk away. Prove them they're not worthy of your \ntime and that usually makes them feel ignored and declined. From what I \nread you're a pretty secure kid, like you already have your life figured \nout.

I am mature enough \nto know what to say and what not to say, for example these little kids \ncalling everyone \"gay\" as an insult when it's ignorant. Gay means happy and \nthere's completely *nothing* wrong with homos or \"gays.\" I don't do that. \nIt's okay for an opinion, but as long as you don't offend anyone bad \n(offending is still not okay, but it depends on the person and how they \ntake it). I don't cyber-bully, I don't share picture of my food (seriously, \nwhy do people still do that?

So we \nare quite sure that this is is the 2014th year since the agreed upon birth \nof Jesus (it may not be the year he actually was born, but it has been 2014 \nsince the year it is believed he did).\n\nOur current usage of years and time has nothing to do with anything before \nthat time period so anything before then has no effect on our measurements.\n\nTechnically it's possible some error occurred and was covered up or \nforgotten, but it's also possible blue unicorns are using magic to hide \nunder the earth's surface waiting for our moment of weakness to jump out \nand kill us all.

However, he is super strong. \nAdditionally, he (and all Kryptonians) generate a bio electric aura-like \nfield around himself. Superman's lesser weight and super strength allows \nhim to leap tall buildings in a single bound, while his electric field \npolarizes to be suspended in the magnetic field of the earth, extending bus \nability so he flies. This explains why he can change direction, rather than \ngoing in a straight parabola like jumping would do. Some evidence for this \ntheory is in the movie Man of Steel, when superman is shown kneeled before \nhe takes off, the rocks around his fist pressed to the ground are seen \nfloating, almost telekinetically, showing that it is not just Superman's \ncorporeal form, but a small area of effect around him.",

So what if we could create spaceship faster than light and we \ncould travel to place far enough to see light from past. In that we could \nsee our selfs at some place where you were 10 years ago.

                    "text": "(If any part is croosed out, it's Youtube's action - It's worth the same \nand it makes sense altogether)\n\nANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION: First of all, quantum physics. That is about \npossibilities. But since I am not an expert on it, I'll tell you what I \n\"think\" I \"know\":\n\nLet's say we discover everything. What atoms are made of to the last level, \netc. Every particle. Everything. Let's say the universe is not infinite, so \nthat we can process all that data (process infinite seems just... never \nending). We are already assuming that the universe is not infinite, and we \nare forgetting about quantum physics too. Well, even then, you have another \nproblem. You didn't measure everything from the beginning. And that means \nthat everything that will happen since you start measuring will be affected \nin an unknown way by all those things that happened before. Probably.\nAn example? Maybe you can measure to death the trunk of a tree. The way it \nis, its condition (suffered X damaged, in these points, etc. -you know, to \nthe smallest particle). But human minds? I don't know. First because we see \nsomeone. We like that person. Then the wind is 9.8m/s, so we feel it. We \nscratch for a combination of elements/reasons, and smile. Then maybe you \nthink you already forgot those unimportant things, when all of a sudden \nsomething happens and it reminds you of that moment. Maybe it was a \nsubconscious process. Well, that factor is going to affect the outcome. And \nsometimes, it's one of the most important factors. The product was great, \nbut your nose reminded me of a person I had an argument with, so I turned \nit down. For example.\n\nYet maybe it's possible to know everything about our brain so that, even if \nwe don't know part of the data, we can say how our brain will react. Well, \nthen you face at least two last problems. First of all, maybe you can find \nthe smallest element on earth/universe (beyond \"God's particle/s\", etc.). \nBut what about time? The word infinite sucks. But you can divide 1 second \ninto infinite parts, and in every of those, something is supposed to \nhappen. Maybe. So that you cannot measure anything because you need the \ndata of the instant called: Static infinite part of a second. And you will \nnever end dividing it. \n\nBut now think that things do not happen so instantly, but instead they take \nsome time. I don't know, but let's say things jump from instants to other \ninstants that are bigger than 1s/infinite. And let's assume the outcomes \nare always the same. A cell always \"does the same things\" no matter what. \nBecause if that factor that changed the outcome changes its state at \nsmaller intervals than the one it takes for cells, we may be screwed.\nBut even assuming you can find that one thing that changes fastest on earth \n(universe, actually), that you measure its changes if necessary, and all of \neverything else, and so you can predict things- let's call it predict-, \nthere is ONE LAST THING:\n\n-HOW CAN YOU BE SURE ABOUT IT? HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NOTHING \nYOU ARE MISSING? I WILL USE THE WORD MAYBE, BUT MY \"ANSWER\" (yes, without \nanalyzing it much) IS PRETTY MUCH YOU CAN'T. SO YOU COULD PREDICT FUTURE, \nAND DO IT RIGHT, BECAUSE LET'S SAY YOU FOUND EVERYTHING THAT IS AND \"CAN \nBE\" ON EARTH/UNIVERSE, EVERY POSSIBLE NEW FORM OF LIFE ETC. ALRIGHT. YOU \nGOT IT. YOU'D BE PREDICTING THE FUTURE! BUT YOU COULDN'T TRUST IT BECAUSE \nYOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING EVERYTHING.\nWE THINK A LAW WORKS, BUT WHAT IF UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IT WORKED \nOTHERWISE? HOW CAN YOU TELL IF YOU DON'T KNOW THOSE CONDITIONS? THEY'RE \nINFINITE. MAYBE. AND APART FROM THAT, THE MAIN POINT IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW \nIF THAT'S ALL. YOU NEVER KNOW. BELIEVING SO IS JUST FAITH. DOESN'T MATTER \nIF YOU FOUND 100 LAWS OR 1 000 000 000 000 000 000. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF \nEVERYTHING FITS. MAYBE THE FORMULA IS OK, BUT IT NEEDED A SECOND ELEMENT TO \nCONSIDER AN UNCONSIDERED \"AND VERY RARE\" CONDITION.\n\nAnd I didn't even talk about delays. Like light. When you see it, it \n\"already happened\" (let's not make it longer :)). That moment was gone. But \neven if you measure it according to your own \"space/time\" in the place you \nare (infinite too, probably; due to little variations due to changes in \ntime due to mass, attraction, different posititions...) is that still \npredicting the future?\n\nAnd one last thing. What about that thing that time for you, moving at a \nnear-to-the-speed-of-light speed, is not the same as for me, in terms of \noutcomes? (getting older...)\n\nBUT THE MAIN THINK FOR ME, AS I SAID, IS JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVE THAT \nYOU ARE FACTORING EVERYTHING IN. EVEN IF YOU ARE DOING SO, THAT DOESN'T \nMEAN YOU CAN BE SURE. IT'S FRUSTRATING, AND BEAUTIFUL. \"LIKE THE COMMENT I \nWROTE\" :)\n\nAND I DIDN'T MENTIONED MUCH ABOUT PARADOXES!...\n\nOh, can anyone please tell me the exact number of words I used? Apparently, \nthe more I write, the less I think, the older I get, the less smart I \nbecome, and the more irrelevant it is for you, the more you will like it \nand feel like doing it. So you tell me. I bet you will.",

I will try to \nsimplify and give a few main reasons:\n- the most important thing to note is a positive feedback loop: if the \nEarth warms a bit, that leads to warming even more. That is mostly because \nice melts and the Earth is a bit darker, thus reflecting less sunlight.\n- tectonic plates move. If a continent is on top of a pole (as one is now), \nor if an ocean it at a pole and walled off (as one is now, lol), it is \nharder for heat to get transfered all across the planet, which turns out to \ncool the planet down.\n- the Earth's orbit around the Sun is changing slowly. Sometimes we are \ncloser, sometimes we are further away. The rotation axis is also wobbling \naround, making 1 cycle about every 30000 years (which is very often \ncompared to the other things I've said).\n- water is the most important greenhouse gas. The more of it is in the \natmosphere, the warmer it gets. Small changes in temperature (for example, \ndue to the CO2 we release) allow the atmosphere to be able to hold more \nwater, which makes it warmer, which allows it to hold more water ... yup, \nit's just another positive feedback loop.",

But, I'll try to answer your question to \nthe greatest of my capabilities.\nI think you and I could both agree that the pitch of a sound is just the \nfrequency of \"pressure fluctuations\" per every second, and the higher a \nfrequency, the higher the pitch, so if there are 360 \"fluctuations\" in a 6 \nseconds clip, then the frequency will in turn be 60 Hz (360/6=60). We can \nalso agree that as a clip speeds up, less time has gone by between the time \nthat the video or sound clip has started, and the time it has ended, so if \na clip is running at twice its regular speed, then there is less time, but \nthe number of \"fluctuations\" stays the same. So, if there are, again, 360 \n\"fluctuations\" in a clip, which this time lasts only 3 seconds, then the \nfrequency will then become 120 Hz (360/3=120), meaning a higher frequency, \nwhich is a higher pitch. We can also do the opposite, there slowing a clip \ndown decreases its pitch. So, in conclusion:\n-A pitch is determined by its sound wave's frequency,\n-A sound wave's frequency is determined by the number of \"fluctuations\" per \nevery second,\n-Speeding up the clip will reduce the number of seconds in the clip, but \nthe number of \"fluctuations\" remains the same,\n. . . and finally,\n-This in turn means that speeding up the clip will increase the pitch.\nHope that helped!",

Is this not written in the Book of \nJashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for \nabout a whole day.\" (English Standard Version)\nNow all the \"versions\" are pretty much saying the same thing. The sun and \nmoon stopped in the sky. For that to happen, the Earth has to stop \nspinning. The video shows us what happens when the Earth stops mid rotation.\nIf your book is true and accurate, why did this scenario not happen? BTW, \n\"god-diddit\" is not an acceptable answer.

Also, I have a vague idea that the \nChristian Bible does not take things literally all the time, this could be \nanother meaning other than literally the sun and moon stopping?? Although \nthe second verse is very specific stating that the sun did stop in the sky? \nAlthough that was not a scientific explanation, I would also like to see \nsomebody explain this as much as you do. Good point there! ",

We use 100% of \nour brain to function and survive. If we even used 99% of it, we would die. \nSimple as that. Now, for cognitive thought and especially things using the \nfrontal cortex, which is responsible for all the things we say we only use \n10% of, we only use 10% because we do not, at least not at this point, need \nto use any more than 10% of it. The reason why other species use less than \n10% of their frontal cortex is because they do not need anymore than they \nalready have to survive as a species. Look at how advanced we are with just \n10% brain power. Imagine how advanced we'd be with 15%? It's going to be a \nGIANT leap, because as you said, 6-7% used by other animals is very \nprimitive compared to 10% of ours. What if we could use 100% of it? Well.. \nIt's hard to imagine that. Floating cities and flying cars would already be \nvery primitive with 100% cognitive thought. Hell, we're already making \nhover cars and that's with 10%.

Personally, I like to question BOTH. I \nthink it's good to question and really think about what the Bible says. And \nreally considering it before just jumping in and saying \"Oh, this is what \nit says, ok I'll worship God, no questions asked!\" However, this goes the \nsame for science, as I refuse to mindlessly say \"So this is what scientists \nare studying and what they say is true! Because I'm sure they know what \nthey are doing!\" No, I think it's best to question both. So my thoughts on \nGod? Personally, I think there is no such holy being controlling us. And I \njust think, if he really was real and a good God, why does war and hunger \nand diseases still exist? I'm just saying. And science, I don't think all \nof it is true. What if they're lying? What if they don't know anything and \nare upset telling you what they want you to think? I agree with the guy \nabove me, religion and science and exist together.

Either direction is simply \naccepting ideas other people have told them, that they themselves have no \nway of proving. The Bible is said to be a long elaborate story of bullshit, \nbut why can't the same be said about the Theory of Evolution and such? I \nunderstand the logic behind \"oh well experiments have been done and it just \nlinks together and makes sense yada yada yada\", but the same argument could \nbe made for the Bible.\nWhat I am really trying to get at here is there is no way in our current \ntime that any of you can prove your belief is 100% truth, and you all need \nto stop being so ignorant to other's ideas because you think you're hot \nshit b/c you read some articles and watched some videos.",

                "text": "*You really should do an episode on the meaning of life. Not the \nphilosophical meaning, but the scientific one*\nBut because the chances of you seeing this comment is so pathetically low \nand because I still want to share my opinion/thoughts on the matter I'll \njust do a discount take on it here. \n\n*What is the meaning of life?* \nWhat is the meaning of life, what is the meaning of our existence? This is \na question we have all asked at least once or twice in our lives. We all \nalso choose to answer it differently. \n\nThose whom want to live a comfortable life without pondering this \nfascinating question often goes to Religion for the answers. Not only does \nreligion answer these questions but they mostly do so in warm ways that are \ntypically not hard to understand and easily accepted by the ignorant \nfellow. However as time went on and education was offered to the average \nbloke these options became very unpopular and instead seen as primitive and \ndumb. \n\nSo where do we go to get the answers now? Some people refuse to give up \ntheir religious beliefs but those who did went straight to Darwin's theory \nof evolution and natural selection which states that the purpose of life is \nto - for lack of better term - to fuck to keep life going. However this is \nunsatisfactory. There's just something about it that screams \n''INCOMPLETE!!!'' when you read about it. But up until now there has been \nnothing to add. \n\n*:WARNING: The following will be facts mixed with my thoughts and opinions \nbuilt mostly during my time on the toilet* \nAs Schr\u00f6dinger demonstrated with his infamous ''undead'' cat experiment, \nobserving nature forces it to arrange into something that fits within the \nphysical rules of our universe. It all involves quantum mechanics which is \nrarely discussed because our brain is not outfitted with the tools \nnecessary to logically understand it which is why I'll grossly simplify it \nfor you guys sitting in your computer chairs presumably eating cheetos. \nBasically what's happening is that two fatass kids are trying to make it \nthrough a door to a room in which there is only enough space for one. But \nbecause they're so fat and because they're trying to make it through at the \nsame time they instead get stuck in the door frame. That is until a third \nkid - representing the act of observing - helps them out by ramming them \nfrom behind. Forcing one through into the tiny room making the other fat \nkid search for a different door. \n\nWithout the third kid the two kids would be stuck forever, trying every \ntiny variation possible within the space they're in. So in reality without \nthe third kid, everything is possible. Which means every tiny variation is \nhappening all at once which means that life is inevitable. Once life is \ncreated within one of these variations that means the act of observing is \nso also, which forces nature to straighten itself out and choose one \nspecific variation, prompting the creation of a universe.\n\nThere are probably some faults in my logic that I'm sure some of you will \npoint out but the ground work is stable. \nSo according to me and the leading scientists within quantum mechanics the \nmeaning of life is to keep the universe in check.\ufeff",

But \neven without the wind, it still won't rotate with the earth.\n\nWhen the helicopter is sitting on the surface, it has a certain amount of \nangular momentum such that it's moving along with the surface.  But if it \nflies straight up, the angular momentum must be conserved.  If angular \nmomentum is conserved and if the altitude of the helicopter increases, it's \nangular velocity must decrease.  So without any atmosphere, it still \nwouldn't keep up with the earth's rotation.\n\nBut what about if we had an atmosphere with absolutely no wind (so the \nentire atmosphere is rotating perfectly along with the earth)?  Would that \npush the helicopter along enough to keep it stationary with respect to the \nearth?  The answer is still no.  Think about it this way.  If you drop an \nobject off a tall building, does the stationary air below it keep the \nobject from falling?  Of course not.  All it can do is slow the fall down. \n Similarly, an atmosphere with no wind will help push the helicopter along \na bit, but not enough to keep up with the earth.\n\nSo why are you able to throw a ball upwards and have it come straight back \ndown?  The radius of the earth is 6300 km, so if you throw a ball 5 m in \nthe air, it's distance from the center of the earth is only changing by \n0.07%, so it's angular velocity only has to change by 0.07%.  When the ball \nis only in the air for a few seconds, it can't fall behind very far.  A \nhelicopter in the air for 12 hours should see this effect more clearly, \nespecially if it flies higher.",

You can choose the orbital height or \nthe speed.  You can't choose both.  Low orbits are fast and high orbits are \nslow.  This is why it takes the ISS 90 minutes to complete an orbit, but it \ntakes the moon 27 days.  Somewhere in between those two altitudes is an \norbit which takes 24 hours.  This is the geostationary orbit.\n\nNow technically there ARE an infinite number of orbits with a period of 24 \nhours (these are called geosynchronous orbits.)  An object in a \ngeosynchronous orbit might move across the sky but always return to the \nsame point every 24 hours.  In order for an orbit to be truly \ngeostationary, it must be geosynchronous, it must be circular, and it must \nbe level with the equator.  These is only one such orbit.\n\nBasically, no.

When the helicopter starts out, it's sitting on the \nground and the ground (being part of the Earth) is rotating at one \nrevolution per day, as we know. Since the helicopter is also sitting on the \nground, it's also inside this moving reference frame, and has the momentum \nthat goes with it so the helicopter is also moving at one revolution per \nday. In fact, so is the air! Now, when the helicopter takes off, it flies \nstraight up to some height above the Earth's surface. But though the \nhelicopter has exerted a force (through the use of its rotors) to lift it \nstraight up, it hasn't exerted a force in the horizontal direction to \ncounter the motion (momentum) it already had that one revolution per \nminute! So though the helicopter is no longer touching the ground, unless \nthe pilot purposely exerts a force against the helicopter's initial \nmomentum, the helicopter will continue to move at one revolution per day, \nand thus remain above the same spot on the Earth's surface from where it \ntook off.

When life first formed on Earth in \ntidal pools, it was thanks to the gravitational pull of the Moon that \nprimordial life was able to traverse between different pools and generally \nspread across the planet. While we\u2019re already here now, life that is \ncurrently in the oceans is no longer able to move so easily. The churning \nof the oceans, and thus the circulation of nutrients, ceases. Water-based \nlife struggles to survive and, eventually, thousands (and probably \nmillions) of species go extinct.\n\nThe Moon isn\u2019t done yet, though. You see, it also accounted for about \none-eightieth of the Earth-Moon mass system. The loss of the Moon directly \naffects the Earth\u2019s orbit, rotation and wobble. Without the Moon to act as \na stabiliser, the Earth begins to wobble more and more, sending our seasons \ninto turmoil and changing our orbit around the Sun from slightly elliptical \nto massively elliptical. We now swing around the Sun in a wild, unstable, \nfluctuating orbit.",

This force is provided \nby the gravitational force of the Earth(which is assumed to be located at \nthe center). Since we use up more gravitational force as centripetal force, \nthere is lesser force providing us weight. Just a summary: There is only \none force providing us with centripetal force and weight, which is \ngravity.If more force is used as centripetal force, there is less left for \nweight.\nTherefore we weigh more at the poles.",

For example, if you have a \nspinning sphere and shape it into an egg without adding or taking away any \nmass, you will still alter it's rotation because of alterations on its \nmoment of inertia. Since angular momentum L is product between angular \nvelocity and moment of inertia (and since the angular velocity is constant \ndue to the fact that we're considering a constant speed rotation), and \nmoment of Inertia is the definite integral from 0 to m (mass) of r squared \n(r being the distance of the outtermost particle of a body to its axis of \nrotation) in respect to mass, altering it's spacial distribution of mass, \nalters the value of the definite integral, and consequently angular \nmomentum, resulting in a different rotational velocity.

The clocks we use for civil timekeeping are based on this motion. \nOf course, the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky is actually caused \nby the rotation of the Earth. So, our clocks measure the length of time \nrequired for the Earth to rotate once with respect to the Sun. From our \nperspective, the Sun revolves around the Earth every 24 hours. This period \nis known as a solar day.\n\nSidereal time is time measured with respect to the apparent motion of the \n'fixed' stars in the sky due to the Earth's rotation. While the Earth is \nrotating on its axis it is also moving along its orbit around the Sun. Over \nthe course of a day the Earth moves about one degree along its orbit (360 \ndegrees in a full orbit divided by 365.25 days in a year is about one \ndegree). Therefore, from our perspective, the Sun moves about one degree \nfrom west to east with respect to the 'fixed' stars.\n\nAll of this means that according to our clocks, which are based on solar \ntime, a given star will rise or set about four minutes earlier each day \n(the Earth rotates 15 degrees in one hour, i.e. 360/24, so one degree of \nrotation is equivalent to about four minutes of time). For example, a star \nthat rises at 9:00pm (21:00) tonight will rise at 8:56 pm (20:56) tomorrow \nand at 8:52pm (20:52) the next night. One month later that star will rise \nor set two hours earlier. In other words, from our perspective, the stars \nrevolve around the Earth in only 23 hours and 56 minutes. This period is \nknown as a sidereal day.\n\nWe don't use the stars to dictate the time of day, but the sun.",

If we were created by something \nthen we were created to evolve, and we do.\n\nNot my statement, question, or argument.\n\nReligion is not about if there is a god or not.  Religion is a means to \ncontrol people. Nothing more.\n\nThe premise of religion as we know it here over the past 2000+ years is \nalways the same. If there is a god, and you worship that god, then there is \na high priest, who only that god talks to.\n\n And there you have it, your control system funnels down from the top.  \nOver the centuries as people started to NOT believe in this concept, it has \nbe reinforced over and over again with fear. A lot of times with brutal \nviolence, as I stated with my first post on this video. \n\nMy comment wasn't to tell Northern Spearwolf that he couldn't make posts \nlike this, he can do what ever he wants.\n\nHowever the bible is a book of half truths, at best, if not blatant lies.  \nThe Hebrews themselves have stated that they borrowed from other religions \nwhen creating it! Some of the most dedicated Orthodox Jews today will tell \nyou exactly this.  And we know this to be true by looking at other \ncultures, that are older, and or have written full accounts of what the \nbible has only touched upon! When you look at Babylon for instance with \ntheir cuneiform writings, this is where most of your stories in the bible \ncome from.  Yet in cuneiform you have full stories, and they make sense. \nHowever you can also see that they are just stories! Nothing more!  When \nthey wrote the bible they did a good job on wrapping it in mystery, by \nputting in snippets of stories here and their. Hell the thing is still \ncausing problems some 2000+ years later, I would say it was a very clever, \nand very well written document for control!\n\nBut it's nothing more than that, and it doesn't have a thing to do with if \nthere is an actual creator or not. That is one of the clever parts of this \nbook. It keeps you arguing over and over on the nonessential's.\n\nBest way to control people really, divide and  conquer with the written \nword, you don't even have to raise a weapon and you have already won the \nwar.\n\nIf nothing else, take this one part of what I'm saying.  The bible is a \nbook of hypocrisy,  and or an oxymoron at best!\n\nA big part of this book is in direct reference to a group who proclaim \nthemselves the chosen people of god, holy people. Held in some supreme \nbeings highest esteem, being virtuous, and just.  \n\nThe reality, they were murderers.  Nothing more, just murderers who took \nother peoples land, homes, and belongings.\n\nThen the bible got an upgrade, and the next group stepped up to commit \nmassive killings throughout the centuries!\n\nAll in the name of the prince of peace!",

                    "text": "+Skyler Thompson You are right, you are not an expert. Science and religion \nare absolutely not compatible. Science is based on observation and data \ncollected through the scientific method, the single most successful \nmethodology for verifying knowledge that the human mind has created. At its \ncore is is the idea that the truth value of a hypothesis, theory, or \nconcept is best determined by its ability to make falsifiable predictions \nthat can be tested against an empirical reality, this means higher powers, \nspirits, demons or gods cannot be included in a hypothesis. Religion is \nbased on faith and faith alone. You have no falsifiable evidence for your \ngod, Yahweh, or any other god. No one possesses such evidence. \n\nYou obviously know nothing about evolution, so allow me to introduce you to \nit. \n\nEvolution is change in the gene pool of a population from generation to \ngeneration by such processes as mutation, natural selection, and genetic \ndrift. \n\nNatural selection is a simple tautology that should really be obvious.\n\nInheritance and selection:\n\nIf an inherited trait helps an animal or plant to survive and reproduce a \nhigher percentage of organisms with that trait will survive and reproduce \nthan the percentage without that trait. That is known as a favourable trait.\n\nIf an inherited trait makes it harder for an animal or plant to survive or \nreproduce a lower percentage of organisms with that trait will survive and \nreproduce than the percentage that survive without the trait. That is known \nas an unfavourable trait.\n\nOver the generations the proportion of organisms with favourable traits \nwill tend to increase while the proportion with unfavourable traits will \ntend to decrease.\n\nNatural selection can happen in any situation where something reproduces \nand passes on its traits. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace \ndeveloped this idea independently. Natural selection affects the genes of \nliving organisms.\n\nOver time natural selection causes populations to differentiate as they \nadapt to new environments. Gradually new subspecies and new species are \nformed. This is known as the Theory of Evolution by natural selection.",

Here's how it goes: \nAssuming the Universe is alone, maybe if it is floating in time, there is a \npossible general speed. This \"General Speed\" is moving faster than time, \nsending us forward in time. By moving opposite the general speed, which may \nor may not exist on a different plane of existence, we would slow down \nthrough time. We'd still move faster than time though, so we'd just slow \ndown. Moving with time would cause you to not move ahead of time, therefore \nstopping time for the object(s) moving with time. Moving slower would send \nyou back in time. Moving faster than general speed would speed up time for \nthe objects moving faster than general speed.\n \nAgain, this is just a theory. I merely thought it up randomly, so I have no \nfactual evidence of any \"General Speed\".",
