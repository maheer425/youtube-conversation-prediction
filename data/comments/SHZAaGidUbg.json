                "text": "Lots of emotion in this video. Allusions to things not true, but beckoning. \nThe TNT/Bomb explosion is bogus; it all depends on the size of the TNT \nexplosion. A bay in NC - no, sorry, too high, too far from water, not a big \nenough hole. \"The uranium rich secondary\" - well, rich with depleted U-238, \nnot fissionable, not very dangerous, even if someone stored it in their \nbarn. The lithium deuteride won't ever do anything. What does the \nradioactive Boy Scout have to do with bombs? He wasn't even trying for \nthat. Radium isn't fissile; americium is, but how many detectors would you \nneed to scrap? You know the reasons that \"we can build a weapon...but not \npredict the weather\"; how does that affect what we should do? (And we can \ndo better than a \"few minutes ahead of time\".)  What do the proclivities of \nthe Japanese religions have to do with the bomb, except you get to use \nHirohito's phrase?  Did he not see the destruction in his own royal city, \nwhich killed more people without any atomic weapon?\n\nThese non-sequiturs bother me.  I think your conclusion is brilliant, and \nsensible, but not because of the evidence you site.  Perhaps it isn't \nreally evidence, but just what you think is motivating. Not original, \ncertainly, but well put.\ufeff",

Most people \nconsider athiestic communism a religion as well, however, they were \nstriving to more then just apes. This ideal  goal which most of the time \ncomes from relgion, is what I love about it. Some religions have caused \npeople to give up all they have and help the poor and unforuate in the \nworld. Some religions have caused people to give up thier lives in the \ndefense of others and some philosphy caused nations to be detroyed and \nothers created. It is a tool.

                    "text": "+mrdean171 You speak of Japanese soldiers being the toughest soldiers out \nthere, perhaps the more fanatical compared to American GIs? Yes. Toughest? \nThat is a long shot, The traditions of Bushido that permeated during \nImperial Japan are matched by the sheer manpower/will of Russian forces. \nThe strongest argument against the dropping of the bombs is the invasion of \nthe Soviets. Russia at the time had just suffered extensive damage from \nGermany and had, through attrition, destroyed the German War machine. They \ncaused German armies to completely capitulate, not even the American forces \nin Normandy, Sicily and North Africa could say the same. Germans were \nalmost similar to Imperial Japan. Albeit, there was significant numbers of \nmass suicides upon American invasion of the Japanese colonial islands. \nThere is also a significant number who just flat out surrendered. And if \nyou say what you said is true, even though their Government and Emperor \nsurrendered, the Japanese people would have kept fighting. Then all those \nletters of officers, sergeants and privates of the Imperial army are false. \nTo a certain extent it can be shown how suicidal Japan was, however if that \nwas completely the case as we like to point out then Japan would have never \nsurrendered, if you base this on Opinion like you have.\n     Also the Generals at the time new completely of all these \nconsequences, politically speaking. These factors mentioned in previous \nstatements were made by those Generals and heads of staff. I'm not \npretending to now more than they did. I'm merely restating what they would \nreveal decades after the Decision to drop the bombs. The truth is also, \nthat if it hadn't been for Truman's change of heart we would have kept \ndropping the bombs. Japan surrendered after Truman's decision to stop the \nbombing (at least that's what he himself revealed). Japan surrendered after \nthe authorization of atomic bombing was suspended. We also can infer more \nupon Stalin's confidence  was that rushing the Russians to liberate China \n would end the war. We also know through cracking the Japanese code \n(something achieved mid-WW2) that the successful Russian invasion of \nManchukuo nearly coincides with the surrendering of Japan.  So perhaps it \nis just coincidence, that's up for you to make the final decision (of \ncourse based on your haste rational nothing changes your opinion). There \nwas a significant timeline of the end game, the bombings, Russian invasion \nand then the surrendering. \nPerhaps nothing would have changed, who knows, but it is likely it would \nhave changed. After the second bombing records still show that PM Tojo and \nthe majority of the head generals still supported fighting to oblivion. The \nemperor didn't make his final decision until over a week after the bombings \nand then after the Russian invasion.\n     What still concerns me is that we as Americans, the majority of us, \nwould rather believe our actions are nearly almost justified in the end. We \nlike to whitewash history and stay quite when it pictures America as the \nwrongful aggressor. We hardly ever speak of the true crimes against Native \nlifestyles and culture throughout the 19th century. Nor do we nations we've \nabused in Latin America. We only talk about our pride being shredded in \nVietnam and not the herbicide and napalm warfare and don't even mention the \nbrutality of the actions certain Army and Marine regiments against \nCivilians. The problem is that we rather be ignorant and clean our own \nfootprints rather than accept what we did.\n     If bombs work so well, atomic, nuclear or conventional, why did we \ngive up at Pearl Harbor, why did the Vietnamese surrending after we dropped \nmillions of tons of ordinance on Hanoi with B-52 bombers? Bombs don't do \nmuch to the spirit of a nation. Britain and Japan both stand up to that \nargument. Neither surrender, not in the Blitz and neither in the \nFire-bombings of Tokyo. That flaws the entire idea the reasoning behind the \ndropping of the bombs. Statistically speaking it is believed that the \nfire-bombings did more damage then the A-bombs did.",

Imagine Iwo Jima but \non a scale 10,000 times bigger and you might be in the ball park for the \nkind of destruction it would have resulted in.\nAlso, you do realize that it also would have DEVASTATED the Japanese \npopulation right? On many islands we attacked over the civilians would jump \noff fucking cliffs before being under our rule. Are you really so god damn \nselfish you don't care if that happens to a whole country?\nI also find it funny how you think you know more about the situation than \nour Generals at the time.

                    "text": "+mrdean171 It's that type of American arrogance that makes us look bad \nabroad. If you do not realize this, Russia was already taking China from \nJapan, if you're smart its possible to not even invade Japan. They could \nnot supply themselves without their 'colonies'. When we dropped the bombs \nRussia was taking Japan's only remaining source of raw materials. We could \nhave saved many people on both sides with this strategy of seiging Japan \nrather than invasion. We had peace treaties planned that were not overly \nliberal and sympathetic to the Japanese. \nSecondly, you make yourself look bad when you compare your actions to the \nholocaust. By dropping the bombs we succumbed to the level of the Nazis and \nthe Japanese in genocidal massacres of Jews and Chinese, respectively. I \ncan understand the elimination of military targets, I don't mind bombing \nports, roads, bridges, mines, factories, etc. What we should mind is the \nmassacre of defenseless women, children and elders.\nFinally, I don't understand how I'm ignorant when in your response to my \nstatement lacked no historical evidence of the casualties we were rumored \nto have had. I'll give you some, We were predicted to lose over 1 million \ntroops storming Japan. The original bombing target was Kyoto, the spiritual \ncenter of Imperial Japan. Until Truman specifically said to stop bombing we \nwere prepared to drop more bombs, easily equaling more than 1 million. \nTruman himself, in his last report he made publicly, said there's anywhere \nfrom 200,000 to 1 million dead. Sadly despite as many records as we can \nfind, some people were completely and instantaneously vaporized (so if it \nhelps you justify our actions, the Japanese who were in Ground Zero \nprobably felt no pain). You can check these facts out yourself, these are \nactually numbers reported by Truman and his military staff. The affects of \nthe bomb has continued to leave its effects on Japan as cancer continued to \ncirculate in families if it didn't kill them off initially. \nSo I end this response by asking how I am in the end the ignorant one when \nin both my statement and my response to an arrogant child I provided basic \nfacts which are able to find quite easily. It seems to me, my friend, that \nyou need to backtrack and support yourself before spewing ignorance and \nmaking yourself seem dimwitted.",

I like how you believe that the Japanese \nonly killed 2,000 American soldiers, and completely ignore the 6 million \npeople that the Japanese military regime raped, tortured, AND murdered \nduring their Asian Campaign of World War II.\n\nHow about the 250,000 men, women, and children that the Japanese raped, \nburied alive, hacked to death, used for bayonet practice, and poured petrol \non and burned alive during the Rape of Nanking? And they repeated THE EXACT \nSAME TACTICS in ALL other territories they conquered. But no, the Japanese \nwere the victims because they died in less than a second from flash-fire \nright? Quick literally the quickest, least painful death you could receive \napart from dying in your sleep.\n\nI also find it hilarious that you believe the Emperor actually had power \nlike a president. No, the Japanese military had power over the country, and \nthey wanted to continue fighting; so they did. The Emperor was merely a \nfigurehead to keep the Japanese population happy.\n\nI could go on and on about the mistakes in your comment, but I'll just sum \nit up with this question for you. If the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki and \nHiroshima were SUCH a massacre and SO evil, why is Japan one of the United \nStates' closest allies today? What, one generation later and every Japanese \nperson on the planet forgot about this \"great massacre\"? Give me a break, \nit's called they realize they were in the wrong, they know they weren't the \nvictims, and they've seen the error of their ways. If it was such an \n\"intolerable massacre\", why are there no riots over the fact American \nsoldiers are still present in Japan today? After all, those American are \nthe \"mass murderers\" right? Answer that question with a response that's \nimpossible to deny, and I'll admit that Americans are dirty, murdering, \nmoral-less pigs. Have fun.",

In the \ndiaries found by Japanese Officers and Kamikaze pilots made for their own \nrecord or to give to parents, friends and family show the complete detest \nof these Pilots. Many of them did not want to die, they specifically state \nit in their letters that they questioned the idea to give their life in a \nsuicide campaign against U.S.\n\nMany people forget that it wasn't the bombs or the Russians per say that \nended the war, Emperor Hirohito himself (the human god-emperor of Japan) to \nhave them lay down their arms. We had written an adjustment to our \n\"unconditional surrender\" to allow the Emperor maintain his throne, which \nwould of likely allowed a peaceful end to the war. However, we decided to \nhold this information back.\n\nSomething interesting to note though, when we dropped the bombs Stalin \nhimself was appalled, a man who would have later been discovered to have \nkilled 20 million of his own people. He himself would not have believed we \nwould drop the bombs. Given the long distance, the Generals in charge of \ncampaign in Japan did not even need Executive approval to drop more bombs, \nbut after Nagasaki was bombed Truman demanded Groves (the leading general \nincharge of the bombings) to stand  down with the words, \"I don't want to \nkill anymore women and children\". In the end we didn't give them a chance, \nin the end that's what we did, killed women and children, in the end those \ndeaths were and still are on our hands. \n\nWhat's our greatest defense? We got our revenge for Pearl Harbor, over \n2,000 American Sailors perished, compared to over 200,000 men, WOMEN and \nCHILDREN. I know many GIs would support the idea that it would be rather \nthe enemy then themselves, but is that worth it. Can you honestly say that \nthanks to the bomb you lived, while a woman or a child died? You traded \nyour life for that of an innocent child. So I hope the dropping of the \nbombs were worth it to you (Collis)",

How close \nwere they to completion? I'm not sure that info has been declassified. Do \nyou think they would have hesitated to use theirs' on our armed forces as \nwe prepared to invade the main island?  How many Americans, Brits and \nAussies would have been killed?  How many Japanese old men, women and \nchildren were preparing to die to repel the evil allied invaders? As I \nrecall, we projected well over one million Japanese deaths before they \nwould surrender. And...what should we have done with the TWO MILLION well \narmed and equipped Japanese soldiers in mainland Asia? Before the atomic \nbombs were dropped, the near total destruction of most Japanese cities by \nconventional bombs did not persuade those two million soldiers to \nsurrender. Even after the bombs, the military brass still did not want to \nsurrender. If we had just been nice to them, maybe they would have \nsurrendered without the bomb. Be nice, then there will be no war. Maybe we \nshould have let Tojo finalize his treaty with Stalin. That would have made \nthe world a safer place. Oh, yeah, maybe we were too mean to Germany, \nalso.  Maybe we should have let them finish their atom bomb, too. Let's be \nfair. The world should be a level playing (battle) field. One sided \narguments sound so reasonable. Liberals never mention that the atomic race \nwas a three way race. If we had lost it, what would your childrens' school \nuniforms look like? Just be nice. Take another hit on your bong.

Waited until the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 \n- Because of the close proximity of the Soviet Union's entry into the \nPacific War and the nuclear bombings, it is unclear over which one of these \nhad the biggest impact to Japan's surrender. It is quite possible that it \nwas purely the Soviet Union's entrance into the Pacific War that got the \nJapanese surrender when you compare the date Japan surrendered (August 15) \nto the date the second atomic bomb was dropped (August 9). This lengthy \ntimeframe may suggest that atomic bombs did not play a key role in the \nsurrender. By contrast, the Soviets invaded Manchuria on August 9, and by \nAugust 15, occupied it and threatened the Japanese home islands. \n\n2. Waited for the US sea blockade to end the war \n- A sea blockade was more effective than a US invasion to end WWII. The \nJapanese military were eagerly anticipating a US invasion so they could \ninflict American casualties. If the US publicly denied an invasion of Japan \nit would mean no American casualties and would signal to Japan that defeat \nwas inevitable. The US Navy was against an invasion and strongly backed a \nsea blockade for this very reason. Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz and Gen. \nCarl Spaatz of the USAAF believed that in the event of this scenario, \nJapanese leaders would ultimately give in. (Remember, Japan had no navy and \nno air force to relieve the blockade). \n\n3. Given a public message to Japan saying that the imperial family would be \nsaved from war crimes trials \n- The Japanese military resisted primarily to defend the imperial family \nfrom post-war prosecution. Japanese military leaders believed the Allies' \n\"unconditional surrender\" meant that the imperial family would be powerless \nand face the court. This was obviously not the case, but Truman failed to \ntell Japan this. Gen. Douglas MacArthur knew the importance of the imperial \nfamily to the Japanese military and therefore urged Truman to let Japan \nknow about the fate of their imperial family if Japan accepted the \nunconditional surrender. \n\nIf Truman was truly humane and serious about \"saving lives\" he would've \ntried these alternatives before resorting to nuclear bombs. This is why I \nbelieve Truman purposely used nuclear weapons to intimidate the Soviet \nUnion. It wasn't a coincidence that they were dropped around the same time \nthe Soviet Union entered the Pacific War. \n\nI hardly think deliberately destroying Hiroshima and Nagasaki's hospitals, \nuniversities, high schools, primary schools, kindergartens, temples and \nresidential suburbs was the difference between winning or losing WW2. At \nleast with conventional bombing, bombers aim for specific military-related \ntargets (like a barracks, munitions factory, depot etc). \n\nIf the atomic bombs were dropped in the frontlines it wouldn't of been such \na big issue. The regrettable aspects of the atomic bombings were that it \nwas militarily unnecessary and used on civilians. Many Americans lack the \nsympathy because their country was the perpetrator and not the victim. If \nNazi Germany used an atomic bomb on Boston, there is no doubt that \nAmericans would condemn that act and call it a war crime - even if the \nGermans argued that \"it saved lives\". \n\n\"Once it had been tested, President Truman faced the decision as to whether \nto use it. He did not like the idea, but he was persuaded that it would \nshorten the war against Japan and save American lives. It is my opinion \nthat the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no \nmaterial assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already \ndefeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and \nthe successful bombing with conventional weapons... My own feeling was that \nin being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to \nthe barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars in that \nfashion, and that wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.\" - \nAdmiral William Leahy",

However, I'm not entirely \nsure why you're so convinced that dropping the atom bombs on hundreds of \nthousands of innocent civilians was not only not cruel, but the best \npossibility at the time. I'm entirely confident there were better options, \nlike those I had previously suggested. There was no absolute need to drop \nthe bombs, at least not to \"save lives\"-- not American let alone Japanese. \nTo be entirely honest, I agree with the view that the bombs were dropped \nmore to prove a point to the Russians than anything. But I digress..\n\nIn the end, you've presented even less evidence than myself in regards to \njustifying why dropping the bombs was even necessary. Because it saved \nlives? I wonder exactly how many lives were saved, compared to those lost-- \nand I don't ask for the statistics that you learned in school.\n\nBecause the Japanese deserved it for their past crimes? Should we then \npunish civilians of other countries because of the horrific things their \nmilitary and government may have done? Ultimately, to be honest, I don't \nthink punishing the Japanese for their crimes was actually among any of \nTruman's or his advisors' priorities.\n\nYour view is of someone who relies too much on information that their \nhistory textbooks offers them.

                    "text": "+Neokiller333 No, there *is* nothing special about the neutron bomb; it's \njust a relatively small nuclear weapon. The various effects of a nuclear \nweapon scale differently with yield. Blast spreads out in a volume of air, \nso it decreases with the cube of distance. Thermal effects come from \nvisible and infrared light, which follows an inverse square law. Gamma and \nneutron radiation are also subject to the inverse square law but they're \nalso significantly absorbed by the atmosphere so there's an exponential \nfactor as well.\n\nThis means that the deadly thermal and blast effects of large bombs reach \nwell beyond the lethal range of their ionizing radiation, while those of \nsmall bombs do not. So the outer edge of the lethal region around a \nsufficiently small bomb will be determined by the range of its ionizing \nradiation, not its blast and thermal effects.\n\nThat said, there are design differences between different nuclear weapons \nof a given size. Different amounts and energies of neutrons are produced by \nfusion vs fission reactions,  and large \"hydrogen\" bombs actually produce \nmuch of their energy by fast fission of ordinary or depleted uranium that \njackets the bomb by the fast neutrons from the fusion reactions. The \nneutron bomb omits this outer jacket both to reduce yield (thereby \nfollowing the scaling laws above) and to let those fusion neutrons escape. \nSo while it might produce more neutrons than a fission-only bomb of the \nsame yield, a small fusion bomb would probably produce just as many.",

Modern hydrogen bombs, which \noperate through nuclear fusion (compared to the nuclear fission of earlier \nweapons) have explosive yields typically measured in megatons. (1 megaton = \n1000 kilotons = 1000000 tons of TNT) The most powerful of these detonated \nto date was the Russian Tsar Bomba, which exploded with a force of ~52 \nmegatons. It was detonated at only half the theoretical maximum yield for \nit's design, meaning if another bomb of the same make were to be built, it \ncould have a maximum yield in the area of 100 megatons (equivalent to \nroughly 5000 Little Boys).",

You provided no evidence or statistics to \nback your claim and so I cant take it seriously.\n\nThe Japanese were island hoppers not blitzkrieg warriors. That was Germany.\n\nActually, that is the point of leaders. They represent the rest of the \ngroup. Our leaders would be fed and protected first too. Don't even bring \nup \"whoring\" or rape. the Japanese pillaged and raped thousands of women in \nNanking and throughout their conquered territories... Again you are \ngrasping at straws and assuming that something is true it is not. The \nImperial Japan mindset is leaps and bounds away from the American mindset. \nNo, almost every citizen would fight and die for the emperor. \n\nHahahahahaha! You seriously think that waiting for the Japanese to rebel is \na good idea given the fact that it would never happen. The Japanese would \nsee our lack of action and assume we were scared, which in turn would boost \ntheir morale. The emperor wouldn't give up. Also if we waited they would \nstock pile supplies and sooner rather than later be able to launch a major \noperation.",

You even agreed that the Japanese Navy was \ncrippled so i don't quite see how they would be capable of transporting \ntheir \"soldiers\", who were probably just half starved civilians given next \nto no equipment, to fight over seas. Not exactly the formidable war machine \neverybody seems to think they were.\n\nThe main reason Japan invaded places like the Philippines was because if \nyou wanted to fight a \"Blitzkrieg\" war then you needed oil, which Japan had \nvery little of in their islands. When America took all of Japans Empire \nback of them, Japan's industry and fuel supply, which they needed to fight \nwith, was gone.\n\nHalf of Japans leaders didn't represent the Japanese populace, the leaders \nwould be unaffected by the food shortages and the rest of the sufferings \nthat the common people were dealing with. I don't think a half starved \nfather whose son was killed fighting for someone who he had never even \nheard speak, and whose daughter was having to whore her self out for food \nwould want to carry on fighting. The Japanese Government and Emperor would \nhave undoubtedly say their people had high morale about the war, but you \nand I know that was definitely not true.\n\nMy point is that even if Japan were capable of forming one more foreign \ninvasion then before they even landed in a ex-territory the Allies would \nhave blown them out of the water. All America and Britain had to do was \nwait for the people to either rebel or for the Emperor to give up. \n\n  \n ",

What occurred at \nHiroshima was not war, nor was it tactics, it was terrorism. You might as \nwell say to the victims of 9/11, \"Hey, these are the repercussions of your \ncountry's foreign policy. Deal with it.\"\n\nIf the bomb had been dropped on a military base, I'd still have a problem \nwith it, but I'd agree that it's the toils of war. But Hiroshima was a \ncivilian centre filled with women and children, many of whom were sick of \nwar. Not to mention the Japanese wanted to surrender; Churchill and Truman \nset the conditions such that the Japanese would refuse in order to continue \nthe war. Part of it was so that Stalin wouldn't get a share of the spoils \n(the greed bastards), but also they wanted at least once to use the bomb \nthey'd spent so much money on.

If you fight a war in which \nyou or your allies are attacked by a pitiless genocidal opponant, you must \nrespond as ruthlessly as they attack. You must make the fighting of that \nwar as costly in every way to them as they are making it to you. More so. \nYou must make clear the cost of their actions. If they did not start the \nwar and bomb your cities, you would not be bombing their cities. They are \nthe cause of their own demise because they started the whole terrible \nprocess. To do otherwise is to betray your own dead innocents and to risk \nlosing because your opponent is more ruthless than you are and makes your \npeople suffer more than they can bare. And the leader of a nation has a \nresponsibility to his own people and does not have the luxury of pacifism \nor not getting blood on his own hands. \nArthur \"Bomber\" Harris was a pacifist. He saw no point in war and hated it. \nBut he realised that to stop and prevent war, you have to convince the \nworld of how terrible it is, not give it rules and try and create \"nice\" \nweapons that don't kill to many, or don't get the folks back home who \ncheered the armies on their way. And voted in the monster of a dictator who \nstarted the whole business.",

When the bomb \nwas initially developed they thought troops would be able to enter the area \nwithin minutes to sweep up. Had the full impact of nuclear weaponry been \nknown at that time it's likely that it would have never been used in the \nfirst place.\n\nBear in mind that the Manhattan Project happened not long after a time when \nradiation was the new cure all fad and you could order pitchers through the \nmail that irradiated drinking water for \"health benefits.\" By then they \nwere starting to understand the dangers of radiation, but they had no idea \nit would stick around as long as it did. Their expectation was that it \nwould dissipate faster than a bug bomb (those little cans you set off to \nkill off spiders, which only puts you out of the house for 2 hours or so), \nall of the damage, both from the explosion itself and through the \nradiation, would be delivered in an impulse, and the recovery process for \nthose cities would be no different than if they would have been carpet \nbombed with conventional explosives.\n\nHere's a scenario: Let's say you develop an engine that can allow a semi to \ngo for 100 miles on a jug of peanut oil. No greenhouse emissions, you have \nan almost infinitely renewable resource, it's basically as clean as you can \nget short of mandating that all cars be propelled by sails. Yet it has the \nunexpected consequence of peanut allergy sufferers dropping by the hundreds \nfrom fatal allergic reactions to emissions that are otherwise harmless. \nIt's guaranteed that the engine would be banned if no way can be devised to \nprevent the emission of the substance at the root of the problem, but \nshould history remember you as a murderous barbarian because you didn't \nrealize your engine would cause such problems?\n\nAnd accusing Americans of incest? Are you serious? You do realize that \nincest occurs in all countries, don't you? In fact, for centuries your own \ncountry was run by people whose family trees often folded back in on \nthemselves. That's right. The royalty and nobility of old Britannia were so \nintent on keeping their titles and lands in the family that they would \noften marry close cousins (i.e. their father's brother's daughter). It \nhappened with such frequency that even the residents of Arkansas and \nAlabama, the USA's go-to states when people outside of Arkansas and Alabama \nwant to make incest jokes, joke about the inbred royal family and noblemen.",

When 'struck'  by a neutron it's absorbed and Li-7 decay's to produce \nan alpha particle, and a tritium nuclei.  Tritium is what fuses with \ndeuterium in the D-T fusion mechanism so the presence of Li-7 increased \nit's ratio drastically with deuterium and an incredibly larger quantity of \nenergy was produced as a result. \n\nThey should have separated the two isotopes especially since it was the \nsecondary fusion fuel by default one would think, regardless of supply \nshortages at that time.\n\nThe result was that a populated island needed to be evacuated and are \nprobably the most heavily irradiated in one dose group of unlucky \nindividual's to live ... or die of cancer.\n\nIt was done on a non-ideal day and wind's carried the fallout large \ndistance.  The USA has never detonated a nuclear weapon larger then this \none ... probably because of this one. \n\nTsar Bomba was the largest nuclear device to be detonated by the soviet's \nto have a 50 megaton yield.\n\nTo put it in perspective Hiroshima and Nagasaki were approximately 15-20 \nkiloton yield, we are talking megatons here which is 1000 times greater \nthen a kiloton.\n\nSo a divergence from the expected 6 megaton's to having it detonate with a \n15+ megaton yield that it did is the equivalent to 450 Hiroshima/Nagasaki \nscale bombs.  Most definitely the second biggest blunder in nuclear history \n(Chernobyl and the government's attempt's to cover it up when they really \nreally needed to stop those reactor's from continuing fission but totally \nignored so many simple things).\n\nFeynmann was a very wise man.  Considering he discovered/invented the whole \nof Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) he has a deep and profound understanding \nof the spiritual or ... magical side of reality as well, which there are \nseveral fascinating discussions with him filmed, they're on youtube if you \nsearch.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+vyor2\nYes their original design was to create a 100 megaton bomb ..... I wasn't \ngoing to repeat a textbook.  My already crazily long post was written to \njust throw out point form points because there is so much to this.\n\nSo ... what's your point? \n\nThey scrapped the idea because a blast of that magnitude would thrust \ndebris (and FF .... fission fragment ... fallout ...) extremely high, \ncompletely above the stratosphere AND the mesosphere into the \nthermosphere.  This is the region of our atmosphere where UV ionizing \nradiation occur's, thus it would turn the fallout into a vastly more deadly \npoison\nand be in a region of space so high above ground that fallout would have \nbeen carried across the entire continent (west) and possibly even across \nthe Atlantic Ocean onto North America ... that would have quite possibly \nstarted WW III right there.\n\nThe 50 megaton bomb itself had it's debris go way above our stratosphere \nand into the mesosphere.  As a consequence not only was the entire Kola \nPeninsula irradiated with fallout, but it was carried all the way across \nScandanavia and almost reached Finland/Norway.\n\nThey PURPOSEFULLY used a LEAD tamper in the third stage, whereas typically \na U-238 tamper is used because it amplifies the X-ray's produced by the \nsecondary (and partially the primary) which is being directed into the now \nfusing (after detonation) nuclei of the third stage fuel (the fusion fuel) \nto significantly increase the amount of fuel which undergoes nuclear \nfusion, which in turn increases the amount of U-235 that fission's (he says \nin this video that only 1.3% of the fission bomb is actually .... \nfissioned).  The entire point of the fusion stage is to increase fissioning \nof the primary, the heat/power/shockwave does NOT come from nuclear fusion, \nit comes from the amplified U-235 nuclear fission of the primary due to the \nenergy and fast neutrons that the tertiary nuclear fusion event generates.\n\nIt's not about megaton's anyways, it's about mass/yield (mass of the bomb \nto it's yield).  The Tsar Bomba was 27 metric tonnes (27,000 kg ... which \nis ... i dont know and hate imperial system so we'll just go with the good \nold multiply by 2.2 which is about 60,000 pounds).\n\nIt was a TEST shot and there were never any plans of creating nuclear \nweapons in that high of a megaton range for military usage BEFORE or after \nthe Tsar Bomba detonation.  Why?\n\nMIRVS.  A single Trident II missile can carry a warhead that has 8-12 \nnuclear bomb's on them (MIRV = Multiple Independently Targatable Reentry \nvehicle(s)).  ONE single ICBM can carpet blanket a country with many \nnuclear warheads off the same missile.  So much of a scare that UN measures \nhave made it so that Trident II ICBMs can only carry 4 MIRVs ('legally') on \nthem ... which to me still sounds like a pointless resolution, 1 bomb is \nbad enough, 4 is ... well disgusting.\n\nDo you know the yield that the US designates it's W88/W89 warhead's?  Only \n200 kiloton's (it can be 'dialed' down or up to I think 600 kiloton's).\n\nConsider too that US has 17 ohio class sub's with 24 of these missiles \neach, overkill just a bit.\n\nMegaton scale nuclear warheads are impractical for the mass/yield ratio, \neg. a W89 warhead is only 1 meter long and only weighs 150kg .... vs. Tsar \nBomba @ 27,000kg and the W89 still has a yield of 200 kiloton's and \nobviously small enough to be fitted on a MIRVed ICBM.  Can you not see the \nVASTLY increased yield per kg that smaller weapons have).\n\nThere's a second reason why megaton scale bombs are impractical and most \ntest shot's by the soviet's were never in that range (most were in fact \nonly baby nukes in the 20 kiloton range because they were TESTS to make \nbetter fuel, design and advanced accidental detonation prevention \nmechanisms).\n\nThat second reason is that a megaton scale shot creates a crater so deep \nthat the shockwave the bomb creates reflects BACK into the crater vs. \nspreading outwards and obliterating everything in it's path.\n\nI could go on for HOUR's, but you see now why I started stating brief \npoints of note because my msg was as epically long as this one which I \ndoubt anyone will read (though you'd be wise to know what your Military has \nin it's hands).",

On the same day an invasion of Japan \nwould have taken place, Japanese light bombers would be burning down cities \nlike San Fransisco, San Diego, maybe even as far as Las Vegas.\n\nThis would have angered the United States even more, and would possibly \nopen a new front, a second Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe United States being distracted with Japan would allow North Korea to \ncompletely invade South Korea, which would make North Korea an actual \nthreat in modern day.\n\nThe prolonged war would lead to even more development of weapons, and might \neven prolong WW2 into a possible conflict with the Soviets.\n\nWe would ask for help, they would bring up their heavy losses against the \nGermans. We would send supplies, they would get the wrong idea (note that \nthis actually happened) \nThey would be outraged as they were at the conference about invading Japan \nfrom the north and ending WW2. \n\nU.S, U.K, Canadian, Australian, Mexican, and all other allies in Japanese \nPOW camps would have to endear a lot more years of abuse. \n\nOverall, its worth the H bombs...\n\ufeff",

These are the pioneers of \nmany of the things we use in the modern day, the golden age of physics. \nWernher Von Braun worked for the Nazis during WWII developing the V2 \nrocket. The rocket stood more than 40 feet high, over 56,000 pounds of \nthrust, and a velocity of 3,600 miles an hour. When the first of these \nrockets hit Britain he stated \"The rocket performed perfectly, it just \nlanded on the wrong planet\". Those rockets would be used later in the \ncreation of the rockets that took Americans into space. The scientist that \nworked so hard in the Manhattan project, developed the atom bomb. They knew \nwhat minute reactions would occur but, had no idea what the major \nconsequences would be. They had no idea what the bomb would do when \ndetonated. Some scientist feared that the bomb would destroy the earth, set \nthe atmosphere on fire, or do nothing at all. After seeing the completion \nof his work and witnessing the detonation of his device; Robert Oppenheimer \nstated \"I have become death, the destroyer of worlds\". These are not often \nevil men, or mad scientist. They are chasing creation and discovery and \noften see their work used to decimate life instead of bettering humanity. \ufeff",

Nuclear \npower plants are very expensive to build and costly to maintain which made \nthe industry disinterested in experimenting with other reactor designs, of \nwhich there were many even in the 1950s. \n\nAlmost all of the problems with our nuclear power industry can or have been \nsolved already elsewhere and remain unfixed for political reasons. It is my \nopinion that global warming is a threat so much greater than nuclear waste \nthat we should make nuclear the main share of our base load power supply \nwhile aggressively switching to renewables. \n\nSwitching to nuclear might be kicking a can down the road but staying on \nfossil fuels is like kicking the can down a mountainside of loose rocks. \nNeither is good but one we can control, the other might start something we \ncan't stop.",

                    "text": "If Earth were to impact such an object, everything here would have \nbasically no chance of surviving. Even if we were hit by a \"planet\" \nmatching the moon in size and density at the shallowest angle and the \nlowest speed possible, the impact could increase Earth's day-length by 16 \nhours or slow it down by about 8. This is happening at the speed of sound \nin the ground, but the impactor is moving much faster, meaning that there \nwould be a wavefront on the ground where suddenly it is moving several \nhundred miles per hour faster or slower. This rippling makes online \nasteroid-impact-calculators understate the effect of the Earthquake \ndramtically. The calculators say that on not-quite the opposite side of the \nworld (to avoid the deadly reverberating effects of the antipode of the \nexplosion) one would first feel the siesmic shaking and that it would \n\"only\" be enough to destroy sturdy buildings and throw the water out of \nlakes. This is not true. In reality, the suborbital debris and air blast \nwould outrace the Earthquake. The pressure from the airblast would be on \nthe order of 500 atmospheres, in other words, being hit by air at that \nspeed would feel like having a white-hot train thrown at you at the speed \nof sound... Even if you were in orbit, you would probably be hit by the \nbulging atmosphere. If you managed to survive, say, by being in a bunker \nthe likes of which the world has never seen, you would have to contend with \nimmense changes in the Earth. One major change would be that the continents \nmay be re-sculpted completely and that Earth would heat up... a lot. If the \nheat were evenly distributed throughout the Earth, each kilogram would \nrecieve about 670,000 joules. This would be enough to raise the temperature \nof the entire thing by about 800 degrees Celsius, enough to melt aluminum, \nlead, tin, zinc, magnesium, and most rocks. The Earth would literally BE \nlava after the impact.\n\nOf course, if earth were to be hit by another Earth, it would be a very \nbirght explosion that would slowly condense back into a new planet or \nperhaps not even do that. The impact speed would approach 16000 m/s, at the \nminimum end. NOBODY would be safe. The explosion would be on the order of \n8E32 joules. If it took  1000 seconds to release the energy, during that \nthousand seconds, Earth (Or Earth and the other planet) would be 2000 times \nbrighter than the sun at the same distance. The moon would receive enough \nheat to shatter or boil much of its surface into space and melt the rest. \nAstronauts on Mars who could see the collision would be vaporized within \nonly a few seconds. The explosion would be brighter than an atomic bomb at \n3 km, but last for over half an hour.\nSo yeah, planets colliding wouldn't just kill everyone and everything on \nthem and in them and in orbit, it would leave scars on other celestial \nbodies as well and kill everyone within line-of-site even on other planets.",

The resources needed to make them are \ncarefully monitored. Special plants need to be constructed to get the right \ntype of payload. You've seen Iran building secretive nuclear plants which \nscreamed weaponized payloads. They tried to hide it, but it was discovered.\n\nAnd actually, the strongest single payload was dropped as a test in 1961 by \nthe USSR. It was 50 MT. Current warheads are weaker, but more easily \ndeployed. But, that actually helps prevent their use. If the US or Russia \never decided to use even one, they would be met with a overwhelming for by \nthe other. MAD has done a good job at preventing the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe point is that it doesn't matter how powerful they are. What matters is \nthat more than one nation has the power to keep the other in line. It's \nbeen ~70 years and there hasn't been a single nuclear war..",

Fire, cannot set off a warhead nor the \nexplosives used to detonate the nuclear charge. Miss-communication, only if \nyou are talking about there being a glitch in the programming of the bomb \nitself somehow. Way to many checks and balances in place in the Military \nfor that to happen. Rouge Officer... not possible; you need a minimum of \ntwo people to even start the launch computer and a set of no less than 5 \nseparate codes to begin the launch sequence. Dropping... please. You can \nput a pneumatic jack-hammer directly to the Uranium or Plutonium core and \nit still wouldn't go off. Little Boy was Uranium 235... not Plutonium. \nAtomic Bombs... use Uranium. NUCLEAR bombs, generally use Plutonium.\n\nVsauce's comment about the B52 crashing even proves my point... NO NUCLEAR \nBOMBER CREW carries said bombs with their detonation devices inside the \nbomb... these devices are only installed once the bomber is over the target \nbomb release point. You can crash these things strapped to an airplane and \nsmash them into the ground at 600 miles per hour from 50,000 feet... and \nSTILL NO NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. WHY???\n\nBecause to DETONATE a Nuclear or Atomic explosive, you must create a \ncritical mass within 1, 1 trillionth of a second. And the way to do this, \nis by either smashing one piece of uranium into another at the several \nhundred times the speed of sound (Little Boy Design) or by detonating \nseveral high explosive charges around a solid core of Plutonium or Uranium \nin an exact detonation sequence that must be timed to the nanosecond and \nhas a timing error of 3 nanoseconds + or - of the previous and next \nexplosion in  the sequence (Fat Man)\ufeff",

                "text": "\"Cruel bombs\" were not used for cruel purposes.\n\nQuite a few people like +Rinku - The Hero of Time  and other commenters \nbellow have stated how the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings are \ncruel, disgusting, twisted.\n\nBut here is a message that was forgotten to history.\n\nThe Americans have had many bombers fly over Japan months before the 2 \n'cruel bombs' droped. But these are not bombers throwing hate. No bombs \nwere dropped by them. But only a message. a Leaflet. Warning the Japanese \ncitizens to evacuate, leave. The Americans are not as cruel and heartless \nas history makes them out to be.\nBecause these men have risked there lives flying over a hostile aerospace \nthat was one of the most dangerous places to fly in the world at the time, \nWhere people would kill them self for there country and kill you in the \nprocess. \n\nThese people have went through extreme lengths to leave this message, to \nwarn the Japanese citizens and the country as a whole of what was coming on \nAugust 1945.\nWarning them of the 30 targets that they should avoid and the fact that \nTHEY are not the target.\n\nBut the majority... did not take the warning seriously... they decided to \nstay instead.\n\nThese bombs may be cruel, but they were not used for a cruel purpose. \n\n\nCopy of the Note: \"\n\n*TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE:*\nAmerica asks that you take immediate heed of what we say on this leaflet.\n\nWe are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man. \nA single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent \nin explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s can carry on a single \nmission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure \nyou it is grimly accurate.\n\nWe have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still \nhave any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one \natomic bomb fell on that city.\n\nBefore using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which \nthey are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition the \nEmperor to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen \nconsequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these \nconsequences and begin the work of building a new, better and peace-loving \nJapan.\n\nYou should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall \nresolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly \nand forcefully end the war.\n\n*EVACUATE YOUR CITIES.*\n\n\nAnd the second leaflet dropped by the americans after the first 'cruel \nbomb'.\n\n\"*ATTENTION JAPANESE PEOPLE. EVACUATE YOUR CITIES.*\nBecause your military leaders have rejected the thirteen part surrender \ndeclaration, two momentous events have occurred in the last few days.\n\nThe Soviet Union, because of this rejection on the part of the military has \nnotified your Ambassador Sato that it has declared war on your nation. \nThus, all powerful countries of the world are now at war with you.\n\nAlso, because of your leaders' refusal to accept the surrender declaration \nthat would enable Japan to honorably end this useless war, we have employed \nour atomic bomb.\n\nA single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent \nin explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s could have carried on a \nsingle mission. Radio Tokyo has told you that with the first use of this \nweapon of total destruction, Hiroshima was virtually destroyed.\n\nBefore we use this bomb again and again to destroy every resource of the \nmilitary by which they are prolonging this useless war, petition the \nemperor now to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen \nconsequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these \nconsequences and begin the work of building a new, better, and peace-loving \nJapan.\n\nAct at once or we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other \nsuperior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war.\n\n*EVACUATE YOUR CITIES.* \"\ufeff",

Either way, \ndebating the dropping of the bombs and whether or not it's a good thing \nthat the US developed it, is, in my opinion a dumb debate.  Without doubt \nthis was a positive thing because even though it killed many many people \nand many more in horrible ways, ultimately it did save lives (both American \n*and* Japanese--and probably saved more Japanese lives than American).\n\nThe takeaway from this horrible experiment is that we should do our best to \nnever use another one in war.  It's hard to imagine a scenario today that \nwould warrant their use.  MAD, during the cold war was an insane policy and \nprobably was nothing more than a game of chicken (thank god nobody every \nflinched--or did we *both* flinch with the game of chicken metaphor?).  The \ngoal should be to destroy all nuclear weapons, but this just isn't \npractical in today's global environment.  70 years after WWII and the US is \nstill playing the role of peace keeper and frankly, I think a very \nnecessary role *(even though we screw it up a lot of the times)*.\n\n\np.s. To anyone who might say, OK, drop one, but why a second three days \nlater?  This is actually because we threatened to drop several if they \ndidn't surrender but the fact was that we could not actually make enough to \nfollow through with this threat (in fact the Hiroshima bomb, I believe, had \nnever even been tested because it was so hard to enrich enough \nUranium-235).  By dropping another so quickly, we bluffed the Japanese into \nthinking we were very capable of doing such a thing.  Luckily they didn't \ncall our bluff (although the military wanted to).

The \nconcept of a being who is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscience; there's \nsome other traits sometimes applied, but that generally covers the most \nbasic definition in most cases, so I'm doing a bit of bracketing here about \nthose other possible definitions (omnibenevolence for instance).\n\nA being that is all powerful, all present, and all knowing. In this sense, \nif you forgo the other assumptions that can be made by what he means by the \nword 'god', his statement is not so untrue. Science does attempt and even \nsucceed in some cases to give these things. Something as simple as a \nsecurity camera system allows a certain amount of omnipresence, for example.\n\nNow, if you wanted to levy a complaint against this statement, it wouldn't \nbe that these two concepts (science and god) are incompatible, but that the \nstatement is so vague and expansive that it becomes meaningless. What \nmeaning you take away from it is your own, rather then actually belonging \nto the quote.

At the \ntime, the Japanese military did not believe in the notion of surrender, and \nas such did not tolerate those who did. When they invaded China, they \nkilled thousands of Chinese soldiers that had tried to surrender. \nAfterwards, they set their sights on civilians. There were reports that \nJapanese soldiers would throw Chinese babies into the air then catch them \nwith their bayonets. When Japan invaded the Philippeans, there were \nhundreds of thousands of American and Filipino soldiers whom surrendered as \nwell as displaced civilians. The Japanese solution was the Bataan death \nmarch, an 80 mile march without any break or rest, where any wounded or \nstragglers were shot and killed. The destination, The former U.S. Base of \nCamp O'Donnel, was another hell, not much different than Nazi Concentration \ncamps. Many of the men who entered, never came out. Some where tortured to \ndeath, others shot, and others starved.\n\nIt is because of this intolerance of surrender and the Japanese ideal of \nabsolute war, the complete destruction of an enemy, that the decision to \ndrop the bomb was made. It was estimated that it would cost the lives of \nnearly a million soldiers in order to successfully invade and occupy Japan \nand the surrounding isles. The Japanese people were brainwashed into \nbelieving that we were coming to destroy them all as a people. Civilians \nwould have fought back in any way they could, forcing confrontations. It \nwas with that in mind that the bomb was dropped. Was it Ethical? No, but \nthat is the nature of war. Was it the best decision? That is a matter of \nperspective and debate. But it is what happened, regardless of who you \nblame. Keep in mind, that during war, neither side is innocent. Each is \nguilty of their own atrocities.

It is obviously \nnot gravity, since gravity is so weak, or electrostatic forces, since + \nrepels from +  and the nucleus is filled with protons. So by common sense, \nthe atom shouldn't even be able to hold itself together.\nBut the atom actually transforms some of it's own mass into energy to \n\"glue\" itself together. Obviously, the Uranium atom is much much bigger \nthan Kr and Ba, so the Uranium atom transforms much more mass into \"glue\" \nthan Kr or Ba.\nSince Kr and Ba transform less of it's own mass into energy compared to \nUranium, the excess \"glue\" that held the Uranium atom together has nowhere \nelse to go since Kr and Ba already has enough \"glue\", so it is turned into \npure energy.\nThat excess \"glue\" is where the atomic bomb gets its destructive energy, \nand the amount of \"glue\" that was converted in the bomb is soo small that \nit only amounts to 0.7g.",

North Africa today is still plagued by landmines placed over \nseventy years ago by both Britain, and Germany. The Chinese were raped and \ndestroyed by the Japanese out of hate. The Soviets razed Germany to the \nground out of hate for destroying their homeland. The British firebombed \nand burned many German cities to the ground to ruin morale. The Americans \nwere assaulted for stopping the Japanese Empire's advances in the far east, \nand the Japanese were firebombed and blasted into oblivion.\n\nSix million people were killed in cold blood out of racism and \nsuperstition. Millions more were killed for simply being in the wrong place \nat the wrong time. An entire race of people was interred out of fear, \nstolen from their homes. An entire generation was practically lost around \nthe world for political interests. Even then, thousands in the end were \ntraded between the English and Soviets in good ol' fashioned imperialism.\n\nNear 50% of the world was engaged in pitched combat, across all continents, \nand almost everyone felt its influence. War is not a pleasant affair, and \nunless you've got the stomach for it, I suggest you have nothing to do with \nit.",

Go research firebombing, and you'll \nrealize that in many cases, firebombed cities had more dead civilians than \neither Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Firebombing would have been the rule had the \nUS gone ahead with a conventional invasion(in fact it already was for every \nside).\n\nPlus, even after the nukes, most Japanese leaders were still planning to \nfight. It took a direct intervention from the emperor to stop the madness. \n\nI encourage you to research things like this before jumping to conclusions \nand assuming you could have done any differently in the same situation. \nVision is always 20/20 in hindsight, and I can guarantee you wouldn't have \ndone any better in the same position with the same knowledge possessed by \nthe US.

Hell even bombs are \nstupid, to add to the list, guns are stupid. The human race has developed \nto the point where machinery takes priority over the lives of others. \nReligion, is one of the stupidest ideas because it enforces us to take \nlives and flesh when something that we cannot be sure about stands behind \nus \"justifying\" our actions. Sikhism is the one religion that I have read, \nseen, and heard about that does not discriminate. They appreciate all forms \nof life, they do not care about your sexual orientation, they do not care \nabout your sex, and, they do not care whether you believe in their \nreligion, they care about your health, mental and physical. This religion \nis what I believe to be the closest teaching to kindness in our world. \n\"Humanity\" is not even a word that describes kindness and compassion \nanymore, it is a word that describes the people of today that argue over \npetty matters such as power rather than remember that they are responsible \nfor the people in their lives. The people in power do not understand the \nbeautiful creativity that moves and pushes children to experience new \nthings. It is the corruption of the world around them that make children \npower hungry. If children were taught with the compassion of Guru Nanak, \nDalai-Lama, Mohatmet Gandhi, or even Charlie Chaplin this world would be a \nbetter place. I do not know about you people, how you live your lives, what \nyou eat, when you sleep, why you say things, and especially how your brain \nworks. I am not pushing, I am not telling, I am not preaching, I am \nspeaking, it is your choice to read or listen, state what you think, I will \nnot be ignorant of what others say. I am not a pacifistic, I believe that \nif someone wishes to hurt you, defend yourself, but to a point. The men, \nwho start wars do not involve themselves in them. They tell the soldiers to \ndo the work for them, \"fight for freedom and your country\", when the \nsoldiers are really just fighting for death. Bombs, bombs do not need to \nexist, they do not have to exist when there is a world that slowly dies \nwatching us hold each other at gunpoint. I realize that there are people \nthat force their ideals upon others, and that defending your beliefs is \nappropriate, as long as those who do not wish to concern themselves with \nthe argument do not get hurt. If dictators and presidents had no soldiers \nto command, no armies, no weapons, and no nukes, they would have to solve \ntheir problems with words, by talking to each other rather than blindly \nkilling those who step in their way. I can never know true tragedy \nfirst-hand until I live the lives of those who have suffered. I am only a \n16 male playing video games through highschool, and if i can realize these \ntruths, I do not understand why politicians who attend Harvard cannot \nrealize that machines and technology are not what we need now, bombs, are \nnot what we need now. What we need is compassion and kindness. To throw \naway bombs and to embrace the true meaning of \"Humanity\". I do not mind \nopinions as long as they are open minded and opinionated as I love to hear \nwhat people have to say. If I have not convinced, or even reached out to, a \nsingle number of you, I hope you will learn from this.   Charlie Chaplin \nfinal speech in The Great Dictator",

The only good \nthing I can say about it is that we can use more than 400 characters in our \ncomments.\nI don't know if anyone else notices it, but every time Google changes \nthings they often get worse than they were before. The new Chrome takes too \nlong to load due to the \"most visited websites\" starting page. Google even \ndid away with the \"Web - Images - Gmail etc.\" bar on top of the Google \nSearch page. I can only ask: Why? What's the point? Why do they fix things \nthat ain't broke? I can only hope the YouTube reply system works again.",
