I was starting college around this time, where all students were \ngiven a login to the school's system along with an email account and some \nquota of space.  But commercially speaking, yes, people could get their own \ninternet accounts by signing up with an ISP (Internet Service Provider) \nlike AOL, Prodigy, or Compuserve. They'd typically give you a floppy disc \nwhich let you set up your account, had internet tools you could use, etc.  \nTons more ISPs became available as the popularity of the internet grew, and \nI managed to steer clear of AOL and go with one of the cheaper providers \nfor home.",

First \nPC was the TRS-80 Model III with cassette. I also had a Z80 card on my //e \nwhich allowed it to use CPM. (I had a CPM-based word processor.) I also had \nthe PC Transporter (PC clone on a card) on my IIgs. I also learned alot \nwhile using the various versions of DOS for PCs. I know keystrokes from \nWindows 3.x that are still part of Windows 8. Most people need an app to do \na screen capture when Alt-PrintScreen and Ctrl-PrintScreen can do the same. \nAfter using that keystroke, go to a program like Paint and hit paste. With \nWIndows 7, Paint became a decent program. (Not sure about Vista, never used \nit.)\n\nI agree kids need to learn and experience where we came from. Modern kids \nsound lazy as well as some adults. If your computer crashes or internet \nservice goes down, what would you do? Go to the library and learn to look \nthings up without Google or Bing. Do a rough draft of a paper by hand. \nLearn to take notes.\n\nAfter I noticed the laziness, even The Jetsons started annoying me. \nEveryone panics because a button doesn't work. Well, learn to cook with a \nstove. At least learn to cook some canned soup.",

Those things have \nbeen obsolete for decades now, and have little to none relevancy today. \nYour logic is way off course. You really shouldn't force kids to do \nanything, because they might actually do the opposite and then they start \nto rebel (of course not all kids). Instead you should encourage them and \nteach them good habits and values when they are young. They should \neventually learn everything. If not, then they are bunch of retards. \nForcing isn't necessary. You can of course speak in forcing tone to kid but \nreally not to force. Kids I have seen are very good mannered and \ndisciplined. I don't know where you live, but here people in general are \nnice and honest with good manners and discipline and forcing isn't really a \nthing here.\n\nSo what I meant that the forcing isn't necessary to kids.",

The great thing is that \nthey are up to times, so you can reserve and even request orders through \nthe internet on a PC, tablet, or phone.
