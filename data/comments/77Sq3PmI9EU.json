Schools, \nthe Social Security Agency, and other institutions throughout the United \nStates accept it and give it the same credence they give to birth \ncertificates issued by state authorities in the United States. \n\nOnly the child's biological parent or legal guardian, preferably the U.S. \ncitizen parent, can apply for a CRBA.  Either parent, including a non-U.S. \ncitizen parent, may execute and sign this application.  If it will be \nsigned and executed by a legal guardian, a special power of attorney from \nthe parent(s) or guardianship affidavit must be submitted.  The application \nmust be made before the child's 18th birthday and the child must make a \npersonal appearance at the U.S. Embassy.",

Had \nthere not been an empty suit squatting in the White House, none of those \nsuspected terrorist scum would have been released. Since Guantanamo is \nstill open and has inmates, its fairly obvious that fools such as yourself \nhave not been very successful in getting the detainees tried by whatever \nkind of court, the detention facility closed and returned to its primary \nstatus as a military base. You are nothing but a self righteous moron who \ncannot deal with the fact that there are people who KNOW you are wrong and \nfull of possibly dangerous shit, and will call you on it. The Constitution \nis all any American citizen needs to safeguard their rights, with the \ncaveat that they are not stupid enough to go to some backward shithole part \nof the world where similar protections are not in place. \"Just be thankful \nTHEIR are people\"---? Oh yeah-you're a REAL master of the English language. \nROFLMAO. When you manage not to make word usage mistakes common to third \ngraders, then maybe you will have earned the right to critique others \nwritings. Again--you're a self righteous pile of shit.  What you also in \nfact ARE is a fucking JOKE. Go puke in your self righteous indignation \nagain. Sieg Heil!",

One more \ntime, halfwit, did the U.S. go through the trouble, risk to soldiers and \nother operatives as well as the expense of capturing, transporting and long \nterm detention of terrorist suspects just for \"shits and grins\"?\n Are you so profoundly ignorant that you do not realize muslim extremists \nhave perpetrated attacks in Europe despite your claims of their greater \nrespect for your \"human rights\"? Sorry-you fucking cretin-they ARE mad dogs.\nThe only valid point you have is that the U.S should not in fact be \nsupporting regimes such as was done with various middle eastern nations \nover time, should there be a regime  change as when the Shah was driven \nfrom Iran--the new regime is likely to be hostile to American interests. It \nwas indeed stupid for the U.S to turn around and then support the new \nIranian regime because they were going to make things tough for Saddam in \nIraq, although that in fact led (after the U.S. became directly involved) \nto the end of Saddams genocidal activity against the Kurdish people. (human \nrights?)\nIt took many years to find Bin Laden, you seem to think the U.S. should not \nhave engaged in the operations it undertook in the effort to find and \neliminate him. What your idiot ass does NOT get is that he would not have \nbeen forced to hole up where he was finally found and eliminated if the \nU.S. had not made it so dangerous for him to conduct his operations in \nother places.\nSome would claim the firebombing of Dresden carried out by the USAAF and \nthe RAF which killed and maimed massive numbers of German noncombatants was \nas great an atrocity as the Soviets behavior, and it may have been British \nrevenge for V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks on London. That is what war IS--you \npathetic simpleton. Civilians WILL die.\nIf you really think that calling me a racist will work any better than \ncalling me a fascist Nazi--you are wrong, as usual. Again, I cannot be \nshamed by a moron or morons such as yourself and others of similar \nwrongheaded belief. Your attempts are pathetic, steeped in futility, and \njust make me laugh.

Since they are Asians rather than homicidal \nmuslim scum, I suppose you're willing to give Kim whatever a pass.  \nSincerely,\nyour \"honorary Aryan\" and racist adversary.

You can never claim any moral high ground if you behave in the same \nway as those who deny people their rights and dignity, yet you think you \ncan? A nation can win wars, defend itself and deal with threats *and* be \nthe better people with the higher moral standards. The Allies defeated the \nNazis without resorting to atrocities in the name of revenge like the \nSoviets, they defeated Japan and the Americans then handled the occupation \nand reconstruction without the same brutality the Japanese showed to those \nit defeated. \n\nGermany and Japan are perfect proof of why its practical as well as moral \nto take the higher path in the long run as well, instead of having to deal \nwith a long term occupation of nations filled with resentful bitter people \nthe allies treated the people of those nations fairly and with dignity and \ngood things came of it instead of just causing another war a few decades on.\n\nYou insist how much better Americans are than the \"evil homicidal maniacs\" \nwithout realising the hypocrisy in killing 18,000 innocent people to get at \nthe couple of hundred men that orchestrated the murder of 3,000 people, or \nhow the misguided \"war on terror\" has actually killed more American \ncitizens than the number of people it was trying to avenge.\n\nThe whole fucking thing has done nothing to make you safer, in fact it has \nactually done the opposite and not only motivated a whole new generation of \nJihadists who are even more violent and brutal it actually created a huge \nnew crucible to forge them in.\n\nOh yeah, you gave them weapons and money too!\n\nJust like you did with Osama Bin Laden, look how well that worked out for \nyou... (incidentally, after thousands of American soldiers lost their \nlives, tens of thousands of civilians murdered and over a *trillion* \ndollars spent he was found in another country a decade later... Killed in a \nprecision military strike by special forces, which is *exactly* the right \nway to do it, not blundering about and creating a thousand new Bin Ladens \nin the process)\n\nYou seem too stupid to understand that those \"murderous, beheading \nhomicidal maniacs\" are all to often your allies, you have groups of brown \npeople with funny names that behead people in the name of Allah in one \nplace and you have groups of brown people with funny names that behead \npeople in the name of Allah in another place.\n\nOne of those groups are actually your political and military allies, you \nalso have one Middle Eastern country that beheads people in the name of \nAllah that support global terrorism and has threatened to \"sweep Israel \ninto the sea\" in one place and another Middle Eastern country that beheads \npeople in the name of Allah and also support global terrorism and insisted \nthat *they* will be the ones to sweep Israel into the sea.\n\nOne of those countries are actually US political and military allies, you \nsell them weapons to. Hundreds of billions of dollars worth, some of the \nbest weapons you're willing to export.\n\nThis what I mean by there are no good guys, its not about \"utopian fairy \ntales\" its about not being childish and believing in \"good guys\" and \"bad \nguys\". That kind of idiocy is for six year olds,  now I realise that *does* \nseem to be about your level of intellect but are really that naive? \n\nThat was a rhetorical question by the way, I *know* you are that childish \nand naive.

I certainly would not show \nsympathy for you if you were involved in a terrorist attack preventable by \ndetaining potential perpetrators. I would say you richly deserved it. You \nstupid less than ignorant boob-The U.S. has fought wars for well over 200 \nyears to establish and protect what is the greatest nation on Earth, and \nthat must continue regardless of your pathetic vomitus until there are no \nthreats to the security of the United States or its citizens, should such \ntime ever occur.

I personally know of a couple British nationals who continuously \nharp about how the pakis are wrecking their country. I know of the Rigby \ncase, and those dune coons should have been given the death sentence,  The \nBritish have become far too weak to execute anyone. Pity that Henry VIII \nisn't still around--he took NO shit from anyone opposing him. Heads would \nhave rolled. (SOME of the heads should not have rolled however, he indeed \ndid persecute and execute both Catholics as well as Protestants who would \nnot swear allegiance to him) Unfortunately, executing psychotic muslim \nvermin doesn't stop them, rather it encourages others of their vile kind, \nbut we are nevertheless rid of them. The homicidal maniacs want their 72 \nvirgins they think they get for martyrdom. (and you still pathetically \nthink such creatures should be allowed \"human rights\" Are you certifiably \nfucking insane?) When one behaves as a human then they should be treated as \nsuch.\nYou're a fucking joke--In order to prove Guantanamo detainees involvement \nin terrorism or support thereof (or the opposite, should that in fact be \nthe case) one would require access to still classified CIA files, that is \nan impossibility, and you know it. I have never made any assertions \nconcerning the number of killed or anything else, what I did was attack and \nquestion your evidence, a point obviously lost on you. NO you are NOT doing \nthe caps correctly, they are to be frequently used as would a drill point \nto penetrate the thick skulls of those with wrong and potentially dangerous \nviewpoints. Sorry-I find NO shame in being likened to a Nazi or fascist as \nits merely the opinion of one who is so wrong about many things and is less \nthan irrelevant. (but nevertheless amusing) Did you not pay attention when \nI told you attempting to shame me IS futile? Does that bother you? I know \nit does, and I like it.\nI do however appreciate your complement--\"Honorary Aryan\".

You are \nmisguided, misled and chock full of ridiculous, and even dangerous beliefs. \nI find YOUR ideas and belief structure not only obnoxious and disgusting \nbut ignorant to the extreme.\nWhat of CIA documents that remain classified? Those could in fact provide \nevidence supporting detention, those persons deemed to be of lesser \nintelligence value or danger may have eventually been released. As I have \nstated previously-you, or anyone else outside the intelligence community \ndoesn't know everything the CIA does. You pathetically stupid dope-WE do \nNOT attempt to impose some absurd religious belief system on ANYONE through \nuse of force, neither do we use it as justification for murder. Your claims \nof murder of however many muslims are essentially baseless, and just where \ndid you get the number from? You havent ANY evidence whether those \"people\" \nwere innocent or in some way supporting al Qaida or a similar terrorist \norganization. The world has not previously and does not operate in the \nmanner you believe it should. Until then protection of Americans MUST be \nthe primary objective. There is no irony-fool, only your belief who are the \n\"bad guys\" vs  those whom I believe are and the methods that should be used \nagainst them. ANY entity jeopardizing American lives SHALL be destroyed by \nwhatever means necessary, and there WILL be collateral damage as in any \nconflict. Only in your twisted warped way of thinking could one equate the \nactions of the U. S. and Britain with that of vicious subhuman jihadists. \nCertain U.S military units have a saying-\"Kill em all-let God sort them \nout\" Thats the way it should be unless these muslims can police themselves \nand control the violent radicals, and I am in full support of doing just \nthat(go puke your tolerant and oh-so-just guts out)\nI will, however agree to a VERY limited extent with your concept of \ndebriefing and trial as well as soundly defeating them, but you are \nincredibly naive in your belief that they operate on battlefields. Since \nyou believe the CIA is so inept, WHO exactly is going to monitor these \ndebriefed individuals, and should they form a terrorist cell and carry out \nattacks who is responsible? Lock them up, and to hell with your human \nrights rubbish, that should NEVER apply to those who behave as wild animals \ndo.  Much better to err on the side of protecting American lives. Radical \nmuslims are vermin who orchestrate random terrorist attacks on civilian \npopulations, making military defeat difficult if not impossible. Drone \nstrikes are an excellent idea, as they minimize collateral damage, and \nnoncombatants frequently get killed in wars, no matter the care taken. That \nIS part of violent conflict. \nYour statement that Gandhi would be revolted by the idea of wasting 18,000 \nmuslims may in fact be true EXCEPT for the fact that the British he led a \npeaceful revolution against were a far more civilized people than the \npsychotic vermin who wage terrorism in the interests of forcing their wacko \nreligious beliefs on the rest of the world. Gandhis methods almost \ncertainly NEVER would have worked against islamic fundamentalists.There is \na huge difference between muslim terrorists (animals) who believe literally \nthe statement in the koran \"infidels must be killed\" and the far more \ncivilized British (humans).\nAt least you realize that archaeological evidence proves the Jews were in \nwhat is now Israel millennia ago, before possession of the land by what are \nnow called Palestinians. \nExactly WHERE did I say \"militant Zionists\"? I used the term \"Israelis\". \n Don't spin your SHIT.\n I agree that the militant Zionists are only arguably better than the \nradical Palestinians ONLY because they do not use acts of terror as the \nPalestinians do. Just as with your  factual claim that there are innocent \nmuslims, there ARE also Israelis who are NOT \"militant Zionists\" I agree \nwith a handful of your points--but reject many. \nYou may think Im a Nazi and thats fine, as I do not care in the slightest \nwhat you think--but I think you're a wimpy blithering idiot with ideas that \nare dangerous to the safety of American citizens, and yes--I am \nnationalistic--and DAMN proud of it.

                    "text": "+Dave Miller \"I have a very hard time believing the information you have \nprovided is ALL there is to know about the case in question.\"\n\nThe material is all there for to research yourself, the comments from the \nUS government admitting there was no evidence against him and the comments \nfrom the 2010 Guantanamo Review Task Force are all a matter of public \nrecord. So are the farcical and almost comical way the CIA cooked up \n\"evidence\" by bribing an inmate with McDonalds into signing statements \naccusing other inmates of terrorist activities, especially how absurd some \nof them are like the whole \"Bin Laden battle sidekick\" idiocy. Even his \noffical CIA files have since been declassified (like this one for example \n which confirms his status as an informant and some of the accusations he \nmade \nhttp://www.documentcloud.org/documents/82873-isn-252-yasim-muhammed-basardah-jtf-gtmo.html#document/p5) \nso *all* the information is out there for anyone to research.\n\nCriticising the Israeli government and Zionists =/= anti semitism, stop \nprojecting your fascist and national supremacist beliefs onto my comments.\n\nI'm nothing like you.\n\nA portion, a fraction of the Jewish people left their homeland thousands of \nyears ago (most stayed after the cultural ancestors of Jewish people split \nbecause of religious reasons, archaeological evidence shows that a specific \nJewish sect left their homeland but culturally similar people stayed) but \nthat doesn't give them the right to ethnically cleanse the people living \nthere now. A culture that had nothing to do with them leaving the region \nmillennia ago, a culture that has been in the region for centuries, \ncontinually and had no input when Foreign powers gave somebody else the \nnational territory right out from under them out of political expediency. \nThe Zionists are almost as bad as Militant Islamists like IS, they are both \nkilling and displacing people because of \"Holy & Divine\" rights and \njustification. Jews around the world? I have no criticism of them, Jews \njust living in Israel? No real criticism for them either, just the Zionists \nthat believe God told them to murder and displace people because they have \nDivine rights. Just like I have contempt and criticism for the Islamic \nState and other violent Islamists\n\nGandhi was a singular individual, an exemplar of the potential for peaceful \nand morally adjusted Human behaviour just like Nelson Mandela. The levels \nof double-think on display here are amusing, you cite the actions of a man \nlike Ghandi and say \"look how this guy did it!\" this how it should be done \nwithout realising the contradictions in your own statements and how they \nwould rail against the idea of murdering 18,000 unrelated and innocent \ncivilians to avenge the murder of 3,000 civilians. How their beliefs and \nactions stand in direct opposition to your own statements also.\n\nHow did the United States gain their Independence? They started a violent \nrebellion over some taxes, not outright repression and ethnic cleansing but \nI bet you will say that the violence was justified (I would even agree if \nyou did). How do many countries have to earn independence, when your \nculture is being displaced, your people losing their homes and their rights \nthe results are often violent and in the case of the ethnic cleansing of \nPalestine the results and backlash are violent.\n\n\"You do of course realize that these homicidal muslim scum (not ALL \nmuslims, admittedly, are) would enjoy torturing and beheading you simply \nbecause YOU do not subscribe to their beliefs\"\n\nYes I do realise this, I hate the fact that humans abandon reason and \ntolerance like this but do you know what?\n\nI'm better than they are, just like I'm better than you. Neither will I say \nthe oppression of any Muslim, that locking them up and denying them their \nhuman rights and basic dignity because of unsubstantiated suspicions that \nthey might be one of the dangerous ones. I would never think that killing \nnearly twenty fucking thousand other peaceful Muslims to get at a few \nhundred of the murderous thugs is the right thing to do.\n\nAlso you seem pretty dumb, you keep talking like I'm saying we should give \nthe actual violent Jihadists flowers and a box of chocolate (probably your \nfixed, prejudicial and fascist mindset again) when I have not. In the field \nthey need to be defeated as cleanly as possible to minimise the impact on \nthe civilians caught in the warzones, any that surrender or show up back in \ntheir home nation need to be detained if evidence of any wrongdoing is \nconfirmed. The ones from the UK that want to come back home? No, they \nshould not be allowed to roam free here if there is evidence that they took \npart in the fighting and any of the atrocities unless they are fully \nwilling to extensively co-operate with intelligence services and be willing \nto be debriefed by the SIS. If they give worthwhile and relevant \nintelligence willingly let them go but only under extensive monitoring and \nscrutiny (extra conditions like restrictions on certain types of \nemployment, access to Children and other precautions would be necessary, \ngood intelligence would be worth the incentive as long as they are \nthoroughly monitored. Otherwise no, don't let them go and put them on trial \nso the evidence can be reviewed. Ideally they will get killed over there \nand that solves that problem but we should not allow people to travel to \nwarzones and commit atrocities and just come back home as if nothing has \nhappened, yet neither should we start indefinitely locking up every single \nperson that travelled to places like Syria for charity or humanitarian \nwork. If there isn't evidence that would stand up in court well enough to \nget a conviction they should let them free, that doesn't mean they cannot \nbe monitored still.\n\nI mean here is another example of your double think \"Whatever it takes\" and \n\"crush this, murder that, exterminate them, blow those guys up and execute \nthese people\" and so on and so on and then in the next sentence you are all \n\"how dare they! Those violent and murderous bastards, so disgusting!\" and \nyou never see the irony! Oh that irony!\n\nIts classic how the simple truth that attempting to justify the  murder of \ninnocent people, the support of war crimes committed by Britain, the US and \nIsrael and the decade long detention of people on the flimsiest of \naccusations makes your opinions and belief structure every bit as obnoxious \nand disgusting as those held by the Jihadists. They believe that they are \nright and they need to crush this, murder that, exterminate them, blow \nthose guys up and execute these people exactly the way you do.\n\nAnyway Sieg Heil Ehrenarier o/ (translate that if you don't know what it \nmeans)",

As I'm also sure \nthat he's not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. According to you right \nwing fanatics, his administration is full of Muslim Brotherhood members. \nThat is just a complete fallacy. I wonder if you would have these \nsuspicions if Mitt Romney was the president. You are right when you say the \ncorporate elitists are running the show. Unfortunately it seems that would \nbe true no matter who is in office as long as elections can be bought. We \nneed to get money out of politics and get rid of Citizens United. I would \nlike a candidate not affiliated with either party and not beholden to \ncorporations and lobbyists. But I don't understand why you think this \ncountry is becoming communist.

Your president has been targeting his political enemies with \naudits from the IRS.  He has been supplying arms and bribes to our enemies. \n He has overtaken governments from around the middle east to overthrow the \nleaders and has replaced them with his MB buddies.  Egypt is a really good \nexample of this.  He has put many in positions within our own government. \n No one holds him accountable for his treasonous acts of which there are \nmany!  Do you even pay attention to what he is doing?  Do you read the \nexecutive orders he has written?  Do you understand that he is acting like \na tyrant?  Do you even believe in the Constitution?

Don't see the relevance. Sure, its another case involving \nNatural Born Citizenship, but the circumstances are pretty different from \nthe Obama case. As I recall, the facts of McCain's birth revolved around \nwhether someone can be called Natural Born if he has two US parents but was \nborn on soil that was arguably not a part of the United States. Conspiracy \ntheories about Kenyan aside, the facts of Obama's birth are that he was \nborn in Hawaii to one US parent and one non-citizen. As regards that topic, \nI find most birthers either do not know or ignore the Supreme Court case \n\"US vs Wong Kim Ark\". You'll find that to be the basis for why a child born \non American soil is considered a Natural Born Citizen and why we use the \ndefinition of Natural Born taken from English Common Law over Vattel's The \nLaw of Nations (I'm not kidding, those exact topics are all brought up in \nthat ruling; you should check it out).\n\n\"First off, this is not about me and I have not been a part of any of the \nlaw suits challenging/questioning Obama's eligibility so you have been \ncaught in a lie and a fallacious argument from the get go.\"\n\nI think you'll find I use the phrase 'you guys' earlier in that paragraph, \nhence I'm referring to the whole birther movement when I use words like \n'your' later in the paragraph. I'll admit that calling you a 'good citizen' \nin the middle of the paragraph might have been a *little* confusing for \nyou. But your ability to leap immediately into conclusions about \"lies and \nfallacious arguments\" is....disturbing. I am seriously questioning your \ngrip on reality and your ability to think logically right now.\n\n \"Second, your claim above is patently false because Obama is one of the \nfew POTUS to not have a parent who was not born on US soil\"\n\nhttp://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message844358/pg1\n\nAlso, irrelevant as US v.

The basic idea is to \n\"win\" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to \nanother topic. This sort of \"reasoning\" has the following form:\n\nTopic A is under discussion.\nTopic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when \ntopic B is actually not relevant to topic A).\nTopic A is abandoned.\nThis sort of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because merely changing the topic of \ndiscussion hardly counts as an argument against a claim.\n\nThe original issue here is without a doubt your self professed knowledge of \nObama being fully and completely vetted, and I am asking you to back it up \nwith facts not fallacies and circumvention.",
