Furthermore if the government \ngave people the option in exchanging their benefits for being allowed to \noperate independently and the business owner was in fact racist and did not \nallow blacks to eat at his place of business who would eat there? Very few \npeople I would imagine. The place would go out of business anyway. You're \nimposing a cost on the business owner for his racism in multiple ways A) He \nis no longer getting any help from the gov't, B) He is choosing not to \nserve a large portion of potential customers, C) He is putting out negative \nopinion of his business to the general public. By not allowing this you are \ngiving no punishment to the racist business owner, imposing no cost on him \nto not refuse to serve people he does not. He may very well decide to lower \nhis quality of service instead and there would be nothing that the blacks \ncould do about it other than not eat there entirely.\n\nAnd going off of the SUPREME law of the land he does indeed have that \nright.

In \nother words, if you want the benefits of the society in which you live you \nmust be willing to agree to compromise.

If, \nunder the laws of the country in which you live, you decide to deny service \nto someone based upon an inconsequential thing (such as sexual preference) \nthen you are subject to the same criticism you are presenting.\nYou can make a philosophical issue out of it all you want, and dilute the \ndiscussion all you want, but the basic point remains: If this *public \nbusiness* owner wants to discriminate against peoples' who's lifestyle is \nin-congruent with  what his moldy old book of bronze-aged prophecy, he does \nnot have that right in our society unless he declares his business a \nprivate establishment.\nIf it is a public business, it means it is open to *all* public, regardless \nof any social stigma. *Period*\n*That* is the point.

That means they \nare in business to accommodate the needs of the public. They actively \ninvite and seek the patronage of the public and therefore are subject to \nthe same anti-discrimination laws that protect workers seeking employment \nor promotion. Specifically, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \ndiscrimination and guarantees all persons the right to \u201cfull and equal \nenjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \naccommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination \nor segregation on the grounds of race, color, religion or national origin.\u201d \nVia Lifescript  \nhttp://www.lifescript.com/soul/self/well-being/the_right_to_refuse_service_or_discrimination.aspx\n\nLook at the cake case in my state of Colorado recently.

They do not decide to be religious only because \nthey KNOW that does not pay the bills. They want to discriminate when it \nhelps them or they get attention but not play that card the entire time . \nIf they want to do that, maybe we should have a law where they cater ONLY \nto their own religious people...but like i said, not many choose that \nbecause it does NOT PAY.  In the US, ALL citizens have the same rights and \nworth initially(unless incarcerated) and to discriminate based on some \nfairytale book (bible or qur'an) or on some silly idea not based on science \nis not American.\n\nHow damaged and pathetic must someone be to discriminate based on race, \nsexuality, sexual lifestyle or disability. Tell me how America would react \nif bills sprang up that discriminated against Christians and their access \nto services or goods?(and save it Xtians, please do not embarrass yourself \nwith saying they are) Like I said, this is based on ego and ignorance.",

The simple fact is \nthat the affordable care act is a series of concessions on both sides that \nrepresents neither well, and reflects both in a poor light. It does nothing \nto address systemic issues in US healthcare that, in part, stem from the \nhighly litigious nature of US society and the belief that any ill that \nbefalls any individual is, somehow, someone else's responsibility. I have \nheard of some fat fucker suing McDonalds for some perceived loss of dignity \nbecause they couldn't get their fat arse in the seat. I would have thought \nthe 'dignity' already undermined by the hulking fat arse. Another person \nsued because their hot drink burned them when they spilled it. I would have \nthought the hint was in the name 'hot drink'. Now McD's cups come advising \nyou that your hot drink is, in fact, hot. Now this is not wholly off-topic. \nMuch of the aggregiously expensive nature of US healthcare is due to \ninsurance costs and litigation risks. people are not held accountable for \ntheir choices hence the type 2 diabetes epidemic which is nothing more than \na series of 'lifestyle choices'. In New Zealand we have much better \naccessibility to healthcare through a public healthcare system. Litigation \nrisk is functionally nil and the cost of healthcare as a % of GDP is lower \nthan in the States. When we look at an issue such as this it is complicated \nby a suite of environmental factors but what I would say is that Obamacare \nis so much adulterated by concessions that it is a strawman. Equally, \nthe 'right' would typically spend without limit on foreign military \nadventures and leave US healthcare in a parlous state. On the whole a very \ndifficult issue that is not well-served by reduction to left and right. ",

You have to elevate your \nunfounded slurs, by giving us a basis for your moral judgement.  You have \nto either address how oral sex is an acceptable aspect of human sexuality, \nwhile being \"unnatural\" or you have to stop using that argument against \ngays.  You have to stop using words like abnormal, outside of the medical \nfield, or you have to go back to the 1800s.\n\nAnd I hate to brake this to you (not) but homos already see what \"the ppl\" \nthink of their lifestyle choice, and because of that, it's not the gays who \nhave to live in the closet anymore, it's the bigots like you have to live \nin the closet.",

                    "text": "+ChristianMission Actually you are very wrong, obviously you have issue \nwith reading comprehension. In science materialism provides answers, \nmetaphysics are not part of the method. So by saying they have a \ncommitments to materialism is the correct stance to have. To do otherwise \nlets anyone suggest as many Russel's Teapots as they want or to violate \nOccam's razor. This is especially true when an answer to a question is a \ncomplex concept which no one can observe or even defines properly. This is \nthe point raised, if you believe in a deity without evidence you will \nbelieve anything without evidence. The moment we concede a role for the \nsupernatural in scientific enquiry, however small, the process becomes \nfatally contaminated. You misunderstand science so you do not not \nunderstand Lewontin point. By removing parts of his comments which shows \nwhat he really thinks you are being dishonest, or your source is dishonest \nwhich is likely a creationist site you copy/paste your drivel from.\n\nThese days peer-review is key, it wasn't in Einstein's day. Also you forget \nthe fact that the theories of his which were correct were validated by \nother scientists, ie peer-reviewed. Do you think physicists just accept \nEinstein'ss work as a matter of fact? Or did they check his work. These \ndays people can publish all sorts of work and just post it on the internet. \nHow does some like yourself, a layman, analyse a piece of work as valid or \nnot? In regards to BAR I know exactly how you validate it's work. You \nconfirm it with your religious bias. It is arrogant to believe you, a \nlayman, are even capable let alone qualified to judge the if a paper is \nvalid or not. \n\nIt is acclaimed for being an armchair archaeologist magazine. It creates a \nfalse authority which allows people to create arguments from authority \nwithout realizing many of it's articles are not experts let alone \nauthorities in archaeology. Each articles it publishes needs to be reviewed \nby the reader.\n\nThe history channel is a joke, sorry to hear you think it is a credible \nchannel, let alone has anything of substance to say about the world. The \nseries on the Bible was not a historic documentary rather it was for \nentertainment. The channel runs shows like ancient aliens which is just \nnonsense from my experience. It just replaces \"God did it\" with \"Aliens did \nit\" by the fact you think the History channels has any credibility \nproves Lewontin point, you will believe anything.\n\nBibarch has creationist articles and links, hardly an unbiased site. Heck \nin its pages on the Exodus it states that most biblical scholars believe \nthe event happened yet within archaeology the event is doubtful, yet they \nmake no mention of this little bit of information. It's sources are to \npromote it's views of the bible, it omits information which counters these \nviews. BHO is the same drivel as Bibarch. As I said BAR is the only \ncreditable link. It's reliability and credibility varies from articles to \narticle. ",

What seems absurd depends on one's prejudice.
