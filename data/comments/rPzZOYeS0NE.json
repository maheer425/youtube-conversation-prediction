I can tell you some horror stories about \nbeing abused.* \"\n\nFuck off asshole. \n\nIt's all fun and games until you actually see results of abuse.  I had a \ndog in rescue that was so terrified of me, he wouldn't defecate or urinate \nif I was visible, because he was ruthlessly beaten whenever he did, because \nhis previous owners never house trained him.\n\nThey just viscously beat him whenever he went to the bathroom, to the point \nhe was afraid to do it.  He had no idea it was OK to go outside.\n\nHis skull was broken when I got him.  It healed, but irregularly.\n\nWhen I got him, I would take him outside, tie him to a post, and go inside \nso he could relive himself.\n\nThat's what people are like.  Not enough people, but plenty.\n\nI often regret not keeping that dog.  My actual dog hated him, because he \nbit me when I was trying to comb him out.  When he bit me, he immediately \ndefecated, expecting to be beaten near to death.  I gained his trust, I was \nfirst person he ever trusted.",

They adored me for \nthe only reason I wasn't cruel to them.  I was the first person in their \nlife to show them a human being wasn't a monster.\n\nGaining their trust that I wasn't going to hurt them was the most difficult \npart.  The second most difficult mission was to show them that their first \nowner was a freak, not a normal person - it was giving them trust in \nhumanity in general.\n\nThis is all giggles and laughs until you see the outcome of cruelty.\n\nThis is like making jokes about child abuse to me.  It's all abstract until \nyou realize there really are people like this.",

However, it is \nhuman nature that our curiosity often overwhelms our instincts, so here's \nsome steps to take in case you absolutely must know what the link leads to. \n  \n\n1) Turn your speakers/headphones off.  Shit's most likely going to get \nloud, inappropriate, or both.   \n2) DO NOT just click the link.  Right click it and hit \"Open Link in New \nTab.\"  This will give you a chance to read the page title and see if your \nstill curious.   \n3) If the tab you opened says \"Go To Sleep!\" Close it WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT \nand thank god you didn't have to hire a therapist.   \n4) If it says anything other than that, be wary.  Seriously, brace yourself \nbecause it's probably some other scary shit or the grossest most fucked up \nkind of porn imaginable.   \n\nNote:  If whatever you clicked on turns out to just be spam, thank god \nbecause it could be so, SSOOOO much worse\ufeff",
