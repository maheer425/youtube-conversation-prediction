We all know Butterfly \nresembles Yenny, so when she opened the door and the butterflies rushed \nout, they were like giving her signs. I'm pretty sure the sign that the \nroom that she's abt to enter is where the BF and the white chick at. So she \nstruggled at the stair, pulling herself out of coming up. And standing \nagainst the door, the green/lightky blue half and the red half represent \ntwo feelings inside her! Anger, furious for red, miserable, torn, \ncold-hearted for blue.... And her hand gesture at the end showed the \nhesitancy of opening the door. And it's like a movie with open ending, we \ndont know if she'd open it or not. The whole MV and album is just a work of \nart! Go Ha:tfelt!!!\ufeff",

                    "text": "The butterflies are symbolic but not of Yenny. In the lyrics she says her \nboyfriend is attracted to pretty girls like a butterfly is attracted to \ncolors. Breaking the container the butterfly is in as she begins walking to \nher boyfriend is symbolic that she's going to break their bonds too- \nletting him go.\n\nThat same line about colors is significant too. You'll notice the entire \nvideo was shot in a neutral palette- that is until we get to the the pretty \nthing the butterfly is attracted to. She sits in front of a bright red wall.\n\nWhen they leave in the cab we are back to neutral colors. The cab's roof ad \nfeatures the question going through Yenny's mind right as it drives by her. \nWe don't see color again until that deep red returns in her boyfriend's \napartment (literally shining out through the open doorway)- implying he's \nthere with the girl. \n\nMy interpretation of the final shots is that as she stands in the door \ndiscovering her boyfriend's indiscretions she realizes she too was just \nanother pretty thing he was attracted to. The butterfly coming out of his \napartment and landing on her being symbolic of that realization.\n\nThe 2nd to last shot is especially arresting. On one side we have the blue \nbutterfly and a blue background i.e. boyfriend. On the other side we have \nred lighting and a red background i.e. the other woman. Yenny finds herself \nsmack dab in the middle of this scene.\n\nAs the camera pans out we see her bathed in the color red. I suppose this \ncould be further read as her not being any different from the new girl he \nbrought home, or of her anger, or that she is completely done with the \nboyfriend (no more blue in the shot). Or you know, all or none of the above.",

The \":\" calls for a long vowel, only when she \npronounced it, it sounded more like /h\u0251t,f\u025blt/. \n\nPersonally I'm gonna pronounce it \"haatfelt\" with an extra long \"a\", but I \nguess the \"true\" pronunciation is whatever She dictates.

I can understand hating on hyuna, or sistar or in general every song \nreleased this year, but this is pure epicness. The song is a masterpiece. \nIt is something the kpop world really needs. Yenny (and i wasn't even a fan \nbefore this), step up the game and she released what i can say is the best \nsong of the year....\n\nShe pulled an adele if you ask me, she sat down and put all her pain in one \nsong, that shows a person's heart being crushed in every way possible. The \nsad and slow part shows pain and hurt, while the dubstep which still has \nthe sad feeling explains the part where you just want to scream, destroy or \nbreak everything, and cry and really feel like breaking down, when you just \nneed someone to hug you, and be there. I love how her voice breaks just \nbefore the chorus, and shows she is ready to break down, but then her voice \nbecomes powerful while she tries to show him that she loves him through \nthat. Amazing... AMAZING!!!\n\nI am very sad the song isn't slaying as much as it should, i was expecting \ntotal slayage considering sunmi's solo debut was successful, and even \nnetizens realised how good it is. Sad times for kpop if this song goes \nunnoticed.\n\nI am very happy i met you through your music Yenny, i feel the need to hug \nyou every time i listen to your songs. Keep producing awesome songs like \nthis for you and for everyone in JYP since you are the best producer they \ngot it seems (since miss a get stupid mediocre-at-best songs).\ufeff",

The lamp and heroin-chic \nexpressionless face gave it away from the start. Unfortunately, the self \nloathing and destructive mania conveyed in that dance arrangement were \ncompletely inappropriate for Park's song.\n\nAin't Nobody is a powerful piece and Park nails it. The narrative is about \nbeing emotionally ripped to shreds, yet rising to a new level of maturity. \nThe woman in the song's lyrics is not falling apart at all. She has \nrecognized an inner strength that she deserves to be loved as deeply as she \nloves her partner, who is an immature boy. He is the fool who doesn't \nrecognize that no one will love him like she does. The whole song is \nrhetorical.\n\nSia's song is about a woman filling her emptiness and low self esteem with \nalcohol, sex, and probably self-inflicted injuries. The woman in Sia's song \nwants to be used and abused because she wants to die.\n\nPark's song is about a woman who despite being crushed, still stands \ntriumphant and reflects on her relationship. The director and choreographer \nwere idiots.",

Uhm no, first, even if \nshe danced similarly, contemporary dance is not exclusive for that video. \nAlso, the settings you say? She didn't entirely film the video in the \nbedroom. Also, the bedroom is symbolic to intimacy/personal space. Where \nthe hell do you think will she film someting related to a lover she's \nlonging for? In a bathroom? I have watched videos of Chandelier and \nalthough they have similarities, I wouldn't say she \"copied\" Sia.\ufeff",

I don't like mainstream boy groups (EXO, Teen Top, BEAST or \nwhatever) and I really don't like much girls bands either. I focus on real \ntalents, and they are a few.\nAnd so I came here, not knowing about this girl (I just realised she's part \nof Wonder Girls, but it doesn't tell me a lot) and my mind was just blown \naway.\nFirst, her voice. Korean female tend to have pretty high pitched voices and \nthey all sound pretty similar. It's really rare to hear such low notes \n(made without an effort) and such warm voices. Second, the MV. The set is \nreally simple and her dance ... I love modern dance and the way she moves \nand is dressed shows really well how she feels. She's suffering a lot, \nalmost getting crazy.\nI don't know if she has other amazing songs like that but it was a great \ndiscovery for me.\ufeff",

But beside them, there are not a lot of \ngroups that i feel worth my time. Sometimes groups surprise me with good \nsongs, i also became a fan of Got7 and Winner because they kindda brought a \ndifferent sound and style that I liked. But then again they're quite \nexceptions these days ... New groups are talented in a way but their talent \nis not well exploited, what they come out with all look alike. I cannot \nenjoy kpop as much as i used to either, kindda miss the old days haha. And \nk-hiphop and k-rap iare for me excellent, artists in these fields come out \nwith songs that are so unique, mixing the underground hiphop sound and \nculture to the korean culture and language, totally love it.

I give MAJOR respect to \nBigHit for allowing Rapmonster (AND SUGA) to compose and produce their own \nsongs. I feel like a lot of people who become \"idols\" are restricted to \npursue their passion in music because of reputation and all. Which is sad \nbecause that pretty much kills the idol's passion and love for music. Too \nmany Kpop Entertainment restrict and sucks out the passion from most Idols. \n\"\n\nI've listened to almost every new kpop idol group (I've been following kpop \nsince 2011) and I've seen the creation of a lot of new epic groups. I was \none of the fans who watched every single EXO's teaser and tried to learn \ntheir names before their debut. But then ... I was pretty disappointed.\nI think it's a matter of taste, I just can't appreciate the whole thing. I \nget bored really quickly, and this made me search for those \"real talents\" \nI spoke about. Here again, it is a subjective point of view. Yes, some \nidols have good voices. But they can't really create their art because \ntheir agencies restrict them.\nThat's why I really love underground music, kpop hip hop and the artists \nwho are not that famous. Because they are still free.\n\nSorry if it was difficult to understand, I'm still learning english ;)",

FIRST: \nShe's a singer, she may dance but this song is about her singing skills. \nSECOND: Really? You want to compare her to Sunmi? Sunmi danced barefoot \nbecause she needed to step on the guy and she said that herself. Plus this \nsong has to show the hard time she's having, she's cryin and dyin inside, \nshe's struggling to survive from pain. Would you dance in high heels doing \ncute or sexy steps for a song like this? Thumbs up for her dancing like \nthat and singing like that. 2 thumbs up for the director of this Mv, it's \namazing! It shows what the song is about. \ufeff",

Yubin and yeeun came with idea of \nadding the clasical/tango kind -of -dance in \"24 hours\". \nAnd the reason people are associating her with sunmi is cuz sunmi used the \nbarefoot concept for 2 of her comebacks (and both of the song/choreo did \nvery well and so she's very popular/known for that concept). Thus a lot of \npeople relates the barefoot concept with her in k-pop (not saying she \ninvented it or that she was the 1st one to do it).\nEither way I don't think it matters nor do I think she is copying sunmi.
