And if you do need to go somewhere, you can take reliable public \ntransportation or a taxi.  Here, there is no such thing as reliable public \ntransportation. You (and I) don't need 715RWHP to get there, but the reason \nthis car is so expensive is because it's for a certain market segment. Not \nus.  However, the cost of the products here (like this E63, which I cannot \neven think about affording) comes cheaper than in **very** restrictive \nplaces like Denmark (known as one of the most expensive western EU places \nto live). In DMK, you get 3+ weeks paid vacation and public healthcare at \nsomeone elses expense. That's the law. What worldwide fortune 100 companies \nreside in DMK?  In the Silicon Valley (about 5 hours North of LA) there are \nmore global companies in one place than in most countries. This is a good \nreason why things are \"inexpensive\" here, more so than other places. I am \nnot defending the US prices, and in fact, I am sympathetic to the costs in \nDMK for your cost of living. It's how your people have voted, and now you \nhave no incentive to dream about a cool car like this (however you have a \nsafe, clean place that is efficient with what resources it has). I wouldn't \nconsider an AMG E63 at $500K US.  Its just not that cool. ",

                    "text": "+LongrunQBJK The SAE J1349 Certified Power is not a document. the SAE J1349 \nCertified Power is a standerd specifying how a manufacture should test the \npower and torque of an engine. Dyno rooms are different, so to make sure \nthat things are equal, SAE International has developed a standard for what \nthe air density (Elevation), barometric pressure, temp and other variables \nmust be, and corrected for if not so. If for example, the temperature of a \ndyno room and the altitude is different than what is specified in the J1349 \nstandard, the \"raw\" number of the dyno pull must then be corrected \naccordingly. The document I'm talking about, is simply a dynosheet \nverifying that the test was done in accordance with SAE J1349 Certified \nPower guidelines. Why I'm bringing this up, is because if what is known as \nthe J507 Land And Sea correction standard is used, the hp number the engine \nputs out, will be about 5-6% higher than if corrected by the J1349 \nstandard. I can't remember the correction factors off the top of my head, \nbut I remember that the temperature for a J1349 test should be corrected \nfor 70 degrees F and the J507 only for 60 degrees F. In other words, the \nJ1349 is more conservative than the J507. Some dyno shops even just use \nrandom correction factors, which basically makes the measured power number \ncompletely useless.\nIf you want to know more about the J1349 Certified Power and other similar \nstandards, read this.\nhttp://www.sae.org/certifiedpower/details.htm",

And since they don't tell us what correction standard they \nuse, we know exactly nothing about how it compares to stock. If you want a \ngood comparison, use the SAE J1349 standard. Then you know what the engine \nputs out, compared to just about any car out there, except for Volvo, as \nthey use another standard. If you make 850hp by the J507 standard compared \nto SAE J1349, you're only making 807.5ish hp SAE J1349. Unfortunately, a \nlot of tuners use the J507 correction standard, and I don't believe anyone \nwho can't produce a J1349 document. The only two Merc tuners I know of who \ndo, is Brabus adn Kleemann.",

All vehicle alternators use \nvoltage regulators, and an alternators maximum output as well as being \nrectified then regulated is connected to how fast the engine is turning, \nnot how much power the engine is putting out - so it makes absolutely no \ndifference if the car is tuned or not.
