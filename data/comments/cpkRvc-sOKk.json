Here I disagree. I think that the level of consumption that we \nmaintain in the developed nations is so much above the sustainable level \nthat it would be disturbing if we insisted on holding that standard.\n\nThe reason the so-called \"poor\" in our \"developed\" societies are unhappy is \nbecause they are pressured to participate in our consumption society and \nfeel bad that they can't. They are excluded from society because they are \nnot winning at the \"more\" game, to use the language of the video. Move \nanyone from our society into a \"developing\" society while keeping their \ncurrent income level and they will realise that what they are missing here \nis not more material wealth but a chance to participate in and be respected \nby society. \n\nOf course I am not proposing to move anyone. I am proposing that our \nsociety change its values.",

                    "text": "Many thanks for your answer, +Gustav Delius . I see that I phrased my \nstatement misleadingly. It is absolutely true that huge numbers of humans \nwere and are lifted out of poverty. \n\nWhat I am worried about is not the exponential distribution of wealth per \nse. What worries me is that I think (and hopefully, I am mistaken) that the \nevolution of this exponential distribution in developed nations currently \ndoes not anymore flatten out the tail. I fear that currently more and more \npeople in developed nations fall below a certain threshold. It is of course \ntrue that this is outweighed by the far larger number of people in \ndeveloping and second-world countries, who come out of poverty. But \nnonetheless it would be disturbing if developed nations cannot hold up a \nminimal standerd of a flattened out tail. \n\nThe second thing which worries me is that in very recent history the \nexponential distribution has started to evolve exponentially. That means \nthat accumulation of ever larger parts of the global wealth in ever smaller \nnumbers of individuals has sped up enormously. This is the exponential \nprocess I meant where I fear it cannot be stopped or reverted in a \nnon-violent way. And I further believe that this accumulation of wealth \ninto the hands of a very few cannot be good. Too much then depends on these \nvery few human beings having good values and good intentions. We are then \nback at the times of emperors on whose mercifulness the fate of the many \ndepends without a way to influence this very much.\n\nThe typical argument that the many make the market on which the wealth of \nthe few relies may loose its validity when the dominance of the pure \nfinancial sector becomes overwhelming. \n\nHowever, many of the thoughts you shared were very helpful to me and \nconvinced me that my point of view might be too pessimistic indeed.",

                    "text": "+Michael Flohr , I don't think the exponential tail in the wealth \ndistribution should be changed. I think it is very healthy to have some \npeople in control of a larger amount of capital. I am a capitalist in that \nsense. I just want the rich to get their satisfaction not out of using \ntheir wealth for consumption but from using their wealth to realise \nbenefits for society. I want them to get their high status not from how \nmuch they own but from how much they achieve for society. There are some \ngood things that Bill Gates can achieve that individuals with fewer \nfinancial resources could not. Or a better example: there are some things \nthat entrepreneurs like Larry Page and Sergei Brin have achieved that a \nstate-run economy could not achieve. It is not how much someone owns that \nis the issue, but what ideals are driving them.\n\nI am however concerned about a cutoff of the distribution at the lower end, \ni.e., I don't want anyone to have less than needed for a happy and healthy \nlive. Having rich people around does not hurt (after all, money is just a \nsocietal construct). The problem is that society currently still associates \n\"more\" with \"better\" and thus envy is created when the materially \"poor\" in \nour society see the materially rich, and thus in the current climate the \nexponential wealth distribution is creating problems for societal cohesion. \nI feel that the stoking of this feeling of envy towards the materially rich \nthat some parties engage in for short-term populistic benefit is very \ndangerous and influences society in exactly the wrong direction.\n\nI distinguish between those people that our society brands as \"poor\" even \nthough they have enough material resources to consume above the globally \nsustainable level and the really poor. So I would like to reformulate your \nquestion from asking for \"examples in human history, where exponential \nprocesses were stopped and changed non-violently and smoothly\" to \"examples \nin human history where huge numbers of people are pulled out of real \npoverty, thereby flattening the exponential distribution at the lower end\". \nNow that has happened in all developed nations, mostly in the 19th and 20th \ncentury and is happening at a rapid speed in India, China and many other \ndeveloping nations now. Billions are being pulled out of poverty. The only \nthing that could endanger that trend would be if people in the developed \nworld not soon stop to overconsume, depleting the globes resources before \nthey can be used to lift everyone out of poverty.",

                    "text": "+Michael Flohr , I am much more hopeful than you. I believe that societal \nvalues can change a lot over time. You and I grew up in a time when making \na lot of money was highly valued, so we are tempted to think that this is \nthe natural state of a society. We have difficulty thinking differently. \nEven your categorisation above was in terms of money. You categorised \nsegments of society by how much money they make. I think we need to start \nsegmenting differently, not by how much money someone makes but by how they \nlead their lives and by how much they are in a positive feedback loop with \ntheir community. \n\nWhat you say about those that are \"poor\" is unfortunately true. They are \nheld back by thinking of themselves as poor. Unfortunately politicians and \nmedia are reinforcing this a lot. Let's face it: everyone in Europe, even \nthe so-called \"poor\", are already consuming at a higher level than the \nglobe can sustain if everyone in the world achieved the same level of \nconsumption.\n\nSo it is really important that the \"poor\" are not told that they need to \nstrive to get \"richer\". Instead everyone should be measured by how close \ntheir consumption level is to the globally sustainable level. That \nimmediately removes the negative image that is currently associated with \nbeing \"poor\". And it puts a lot of burden and societal pressure on everyone \nto lower their consumption levels.\n\nThis change of view would remove the current culture of envy towards the \n\"rich\". Instead we would foster what the Germans know as \"Reichtum \nverpflichtet\". The \"rich\" would again be expected to make particularly \nstrong efforts of giving back to society. \n\nThere are examples that society's views can change. It used to be cool to \nsmoke. This was reinforced by a powerful tobacco industry through lobbying \nand through advertising. Now it is no longer cool to smoke. Society's view \nhas changed completely.\n\nBut it is still cool to consume. This general consumption is of course \nsupported by a much more powerful lobby. But I am hopeful nevertheless. \nThere are so many reasons to lower consumption. All the effort we currently \nput into consumption we could put into strengthening society, into \neducation, into health (mental and physical), into science.\n\n+Lukas Delius , am I unrealistically optimistic? Or can society change as \nmuch as I hope?",

                    "text": "The public is constantly brainwashed by a huge apparatus to believe that \nincrease of GDP is the only way that a more or less comfortable life for \neach of them individually can be sustained. This brainwashing is so strong \nthat it even manages to upheld this believe against the fact that an ever \ngrowing and by now disturbingly high percentage of the populations of most \nhigh tech nations cannot anymore participate in this comfortable way of \nlife. \n\nImho, the problem is that our society works like that: \n\n1) If you are poor, the system will make sure that your influence on it is \nnegligible. Since you are socially outcast it is difficult to join other \npoor people to join an alliance which could gain some weight. Most poor \npeople I know do everything to appear as \"normal\", i.e. sufficiently \nfinancially potent, just to not feel entirely as outcasts. And most of them \nbelieve, their hopeless situation is their fault, as they are told so \ncontinuously in many direct and even more indirect ways.\n\n2) If you are \"rich\" (above a certain level), you almost certainly will \nwant to keep it that way. You have a job in a company which goes to quite \nsome lengths to educate you to believe that you are a \"Leistungstr\u00e4ger\" and \nthus better that other people earning less. You deserve to live better and \nto be richer than these others. It's the fault of the poor ones that they \nare poor. You definitely don't want anything which lessens the gap. And \nhence you won't join the side which wants to change the goal from \"more\" to \n\"better\". I have experienced that often enough with people I know well. \nThis is a real issue. Needless to say that this group is currently the most \ninfluential in our society.\n\n3) You earn enough, but not much. Then you are either working for a company \non a lower paid entry level job and are just waiting to reach stage 2, or \nyou are one of these rare people like academics working at a university, \nfor whom money is not that important. In the first case, you long for 2 \nexpecting that your career will eventually get you there, and are already \nbrainwashed. In the latter case, you probably already know that the society \nand the forces reigning it are giving a damn about you. You can feel lucky \nif society is continuing to provide for you. You can only hope to become \nreally famous (win the Noble prize e.g.). In case you become really famous \nyou soon find out that you still have almost no influence, if you are \nstarting to tell anything against the official point of view.\n\n4) You belong to the top of group 2. Then you almost certainly are a \npsychopath and misanthrop. Your personality is such that in earlier times, \nyou would have become a war lord or great warrior, or a king. You believe \nthat you are superior to other people, and you believe that this gives you \nrights beyond ordinary rights for everybody, In particular, you believe \nthat you do not have to justify your decisions. Fighting and war are the \nnatural categories in which you think. The Ackerman \"v\" is just a harmless \nglitch, the truth is much much worse - in my opinion. As we have seen in \nthe last big financial crisis, it is almost impossible to touch these \npeople or to let them take responsibility (with real consequences) for \ntheir doings. \n\nDon't get me wrong. Such videos are great. There should be a lot more like \nthese. However, I have a very bad feeling that this system of pure \n\"more\"-driven economy cannot be changed peacefully and slowly. I fear we \nall will have to go through some cataclysm before there will be the right \nconditions to change the game. But if there is even the slightest chance \nthat the system can evolve non-violently, it surely is worth trying.\n\nIt is just my sad personal experience that people, formally my friends, \nwhich after starting a career in one of the bigger companies or banks, \nchanged beyond recognition in their character and their personality, that \nmade me write this rant. And I wish to close it with a more hopeful \nstatement, namely that I also know people who made (quite a steap) career, \nbut remained faithful to themselves and their ideals. ",

I know better than you do ! Think \noutside of the box, duh !\" - I hated that too), you would have found that \nwhat happened in Naples is the reason why we can't rely on a system to \nself-regulate and just tell people to put their bottle in the recycle bin.\n\nWe need people to be aware of that recycling chain, and care about it a \nlot, so the Mafia can't throw all these wastes in the water and get away \nwith it (at least not as much as now).\n\nSimply because corruption exist in governments doesn't mean we can't have \ngovernments. Corruption will always be there, in people's mind, in the \nglobal sense of morality - pretending it just affects the governments is \nfooling yourself.",

In the meantime, contemporary economic theory has \nignored actual working commons.\"\n\nI enjoyed the article though, it was well thought out. I think much of the \nconfusion between your views and mine can be attributed to the fact that we \ndefine the commons as two completely different things as explained in the \narticle:\n\" Hardin was not describing a commons, but rather an open access regime or \nfree-for-all in which everything is free for the taking without constraint. \nIn a commons, however, there is a distinct community of users who govern \nthe resource. The commoners negotiate their own rules of usage, assign \nresponsibilities and entitlements, and set up monitoring systems and \npenalties to identify free riders, among other acts to maintain the \ncommons.\" \n\nBut that being said, I still disagree with the feasibility of the commons \nas described in the article. I believe there are far too many idealistic \nproperties that must be met in order for the commons paradigm to work. Many \nof these limitations are nearly impossible to oust with the exception of \nthe internet. Here's a few Bollier talks about in the article:\n\"Inappropriate or ineffectual governance, bad leadership, and ill-advised \ngroup consensus can all damage the effective working of the commons, and \ncommoners may have disagreements and conflicts that cannot always be \nbridged...\"\n\nThe big exception is indeed the internet. Wikipedia is the example I liked \nthe best. Wikipedia CAN work as a commons because any changes to its \ncontents can be monitored.

It's \nall setup to get you thinking the way Lennox wants you to think, as opposed \nto how you might normally think.\n\nShe goes on for a long time about this game and rules and laws, and claims \nthat the problem is the goal ... completely ignoring the fact that the \nproblem is not the goal, but the people and the system which created the \ngame in the first place. If there was no game, there would be no problem. \nSo who created the game? The government, of course. They want you working, \nand they don't can about on what so long as they can tax you. You are \nnothing but cattle to them. You are the cow, and taxes are your milk.\n\nRemove government from the equation, and the problem solves itself. People \ndon't really want more. There's only so much one person can reasonably keep \nin their house ... which is why, rather than getting 20 televisions, most \nfolks just get one or two good televisions, because they really don't need \nany more.\n\nThe free market is all about BETTER, not more. It's about providing the \nbest possible product at the best possible price to the public. Those who \ncan offer the best product at the best price make the most money. This is \ngood for consumers.\n\nWhat we have now is nothing close to free market capitalism. It's \nCORPORATISM (also known as FASCISM). In this system the government picks \nwinners and losers and subsidizes those who feed it contributions. Those \nwho receive subsidies don't have to provide the best quality at the best \nprice because they're getting your money anyway, even if you don't buy \ntheir product because the government has taken it from you and given it to \nthem. The government also creates regulations which are billed as \n\"protection\" from the big corporations, but in practice only act to keep \nsmaller competitors out of the market so that the bigger competitors don't \nhave to produce better at a better price. They can offer worse at a high \nprice and you'll be forced to pay it because the government has suppressed \nany competition which may be able to offer you better.\ufeff",

                    "text": "+Jacob\nThe answer to your convoluted question is \"All of the most basic and \nfundamental principles of economics 101\".\n\nIn a free market, competition prevents prices from going above what the \nmarket can bear. If merchant A jacks up his prices, this creates an \nopportunity for merchant B to take market share away from A. If A and B \ncollude and bring up both of their prices at the same time, this creates an \nopportunity for merchant C to enter the market as an entrepreneur and take \nmarket share away from both of them. Competition always leads to the lowest \npossible price for consumers.\n\nSomething you've failed to realize in your question is that LABOR is just \none of many services offered in the free market. If A offers $2 per hour, \nand B is offering $3 per hour, employees will leave A to go to B for the \nbetter wage. A will see his workers fleeing for higher wages and offer a \ncompetitive wage to retain them. B, however wants to keep the very best \nworkers for himself, so he offers $4 to retain them. Wash, rinse, repeat. \nCompetition for labor always leads to the highest possible wage for the job \nin question. What is the highest possible wage? It's how ever much you can \nafford to pay in labor, and still earn the desired profit margin off of the \nwork the employee performs. If the job requires very little skill and \nlabor, the highest wage will be very low because a one armed monkey could \ndo it. However, if the job requires skill and a strong work ethic, the \nprice of labor goes way up because not only does the employer have to \nattract someone who can do the job, he wants to retain the workers who will \ndo the job the best.\n\nSlavery is only possible under a strong government which will enforce the \nright of slave holders to keep slaves. Brazil, for example, never abolished \nslavery, but there are none now. Why? Because rather than abolishing it, \nthe government simply stopped helping retrieve run away slaves. When the \ncost of keeping the slaves grew to be more than the value of having slaves, \npeople simply stopped using slaves. It was cheaper just to pay them a \nvoluntary wage.",

A corporation \nis a legal entity created by government to shield business owners from \nliability ... which is where we get the term \"limited liability\" ... which \nallows operators to do harm to the public and never suffer the consequences.\n\nIn a real free market, all businesses are operated in the market by \nindividuals and partners who are all 100% FULLY Liable for everything. This \nmeans it is never profitable to do harm because they will always have to \npay the full cost of damages, personal and ecological alike.\n\nThe system we have now IS NOT Capitalism and it IS NOT a Free Market. There \nare some free market aspects which linger, but the system itself is \nCorporatist (Also known as FASCIST), which is an unholy union of government \nand business which uses the government monopoly on force to create coercion \nin the market and pervert and corrupt incentives.",
