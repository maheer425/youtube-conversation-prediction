In Catholicism however, this \"Primacy of Peter\" is said to extend \nin perpetuity to the Pope over other bishops throughout the Church via the \ndoctrine of Apostolic succession (method whereby a series of bishops, each \nconsecrated by other bishops who were consecrated similarly in a succession \ngoing back to Simon Peter and the original apostles). This extension of \nPetrine Primacy to one chosen bishop is known as the Primacy of the Roman \nPontiff, also known as Primacy of the Bishop of Rome. This Catholic Church \ndoctrine holds that the papacy has authority, delegated from Jesus, \npreserved by Apostolic succession, chosen through the assembly of bishops \nand guided by god, to rule over the entire Church.\n\nAt least that's the story...I think its rather interesting.",

I experience much more discomfort \nfrom it now than when I did when I was religious. Mostly because when I was \nreligious I was sure I was right about my beliefs and anything that \ncontradicted it was easily shrugged off, because surely it must be wrong or \nnot completely correct.\n\nWhereas now I have a lot more intellectual honesty and if something \ncontradicts my preconceived notions, then I *have* to investigate which is \nmore accurate, my preconceptions or the new information. I don't have the \nluxury of just assuming that I'm right like I once did.\n\nAs for the Pope's nonsense, I'm referring to his smokescreen that everyone \nseems to be buying into. When the man says that the church needs to focus \nless on certain social issues, all he's really saying is that he doesn't \nwant those things to be as visible to the public, because he hasn't \nactually changed his position on gay marriage, abortion, etc he is just \nchanging what the church fights publicly. Neither the official church \npositions nor his own positions on these subjects have changed.\n\nThat and when it comes to the poor. He talks a lot about it and even puts \non a show, but it's not like he's actually doing anything more with the \nexorbitant wealth of the church. If that changes then so be it, but the \nchurch still has a LOT to answer for, like child abuse, their atrocious \ncondom policy, etc, and a few pretty words and some nice photo ops aren't \ngoing to make it go away in my mind. No matter how enamored everyone else \nbecomes with him.\n\nIt's all just a P.R. push to counteract the Catholic Church's falling \nnumbers due to the public's progressive shift on these issues.",
