                "text": "SATURDAY SHORT FILM (PROXiMITY)\nMy dear friends, sisters and brothers..... Saturday is a relaxing day for \nus mostly..... So I like to share this interesting short film for your \nweekend and spend it in a different way......\n\nToday's short film is called \"PROXiMITY\" It's full of action, mysteries and \nsome disturbing moments also (If you are so sensitive please be careful \nabout that), but it shows the way of our thinking according to the system \nin our lives. I think if situation is not good sometimes, we need to think \nout of the box (system) too. It's only 11 minutes and 03 seconds long, so \nwhen you feel free please watch it...... and share your thoughts about \nit....\nPROXiMITY (A Short Film by Ryan Connolly)\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Connolly & Film Riot....\n\nI hope you enjoy this short film in different way and have a great weekend \nto you all.....\n\nAayubowan ! (live long life)\ufeff",

Beyond how tense it was (and the atmosphere was really well done), \nthere's no information about who these people are. Are they convicts? Then \nthis seems like a really inconvenient way to deal with them. Maybe it's \nsome shadowy paramilitary group? Then why wait until all but one are dead? \nPlus, that means your numbers never actually grow. And if they are, why \ndon't we ever see them? A little insight into their plans would have made \nthe ending make a whole lot more sense, but presently I found it a bit \nweak.\ufeff",

Also you may have \nchoosen a low angle when the antagonist is leading, to make the viewer feel \nlike the underdog.\n\nPlot twist tiredness.\nRyan you're getting a bit predictable by having some bigger plot twist at \nthe end of your work. My problem with such things is when they are \nillogical and or are  totally unpredictable. This film's plot twist felt to \nme did not add fun or satisfaction. If you had your antagonist hint the \nviewer of for instance trouble of conscious, hesitating to do his killing \njob, then the plot twist would have made sense, and would be rewarding for \nthe viewer.\n\nI hope you find my critique constructive and helpful.",

As I said before everything \nelse was great. No one can argue with the quality of the film production. \n(yes I realize that story is part of the production ) You guys know your \ngood at this. \n\n I personally thought the premise was lacking in having a point. I've read \nbooks and seen movies where people are hunted. That part is golden, But \nthere was just this emptiness present. A lack of depth. I think if you guys \nwould have given just the slightest meaning to the madness it would have \nbeen much better. I feel that to much was left to interpretation and that \nthe after taste is vague. I think just one little hint to a greater picture \nin the world you created would have been a great boon. I think just a few \nseconds to tie some loose ends together even if it ended up raising more \nquestion would have been better.

(spoilers) Instead of showing us exactly what happened at the end \n(ie the prisoner shoots the guard), it may have been more effective not \nshowing who survived the end encounter. So then the truck arrives as a \nguard walks towards it (without showing his face). Arris (dressed as the \nguard) jumps off the truck and greets the other (who's face we still dont \nsee). They both pull off the new prisoners all the while the focus is on \nArris' face (literally). The other guard pulls off the hoods and the men \nrun off. Suddenly the other guard raises his rifle and spins round to Arris \npulling the trigger. Todd Bruno's character survived. He then runs to the \ndrivers side and hijacks the truck, making his escape. The end. (I dont \nthink its a better ending but its food for thought). Love your work guys \nand hope that \"Outsiders\" happens!\ufeff",

The story had little to no weight for \nme, I never felt involved in what was going on, or had any reason to root \nfor anyone. I assume it was meant to be mysterious, but it came off as just \na bunch of pointless violence. It definitely would've helped to have some \nmore context. The visuals did nothing for me either, drab and colorless. \nI'm normally completely on board for the whole washed out desaturated look, \nbut it's not working for me here. Also, what's with the ww1 era rifles, \nfelt very out of place. The acting was cool, and I can definitely \nappreciate how rough this must've been on the actors. \n\nIf this was some other channel, I wouldn't care. But I love your work, the \nskits, losses and tell were both fantastic, so this is kind of a let down. \nThis is only my opinion in the end, however objective I try to be, I hope \nyou don't take my words as mindless hate.\ufeff",

                "text": "My Thoughts:\nFantastic job at mimicking the film look. \nAnamorphic lens looked wonderful. Lens flares where subtle and pleasant. \nThe filter or color correction, in my opinion, was slightly to contrasty, \nshadows were harsh, although that could have been for styalistic purposes.\nDialogue was pretty good, with an impressive performance from the main \ncharacter. Your friends could use some work ;). \nFight scene looked impressive!\nCinematography and editing were relatively seamless.\nSound was great!\nThe film was scored excellently! Who did it?\n\nAs far as story, a few constructive things *SPOILERS*:\nWhy where the first two connected separately from the other two? Is it \nsupposed to be because, ideally, the two \"bound\" together would work \ntogether to win? If so, who is the man with the main character once he had \nbecome a hunter? Why did the  main character kill him? I imagine, based on \nstory, that he is in the same position as our main character? Although I \ndid notice that he was wearing a hat, just as the older, more square \nlooking man who our main character shot in the neck prior.\n\nThe stick in the ribs didn't even phase main characters physical \ncapabilities.\nYou should have had a bloodier mess when he smashed the guys leg off to get \nhis brace. I'm talkin' blood splattering on his face.\nWhy would the main character, who now just acquired the other man's brace, \nrun TOWARD a man with a rifle instead of trying to escape? Why did no ones \nface ever bleed from repeated punches? Did the main character get lucky \nfrom the neck shot he fired from his hip, while he was on his back or is he \ntrained? The guy with the sides of his head saved had a visible 2 on his \nankle in the beginning but a much larger \"2xx\" number when the main \ncharacter checks it later in the film. Why was this significant? The \nnumbers are whats confusing me. I feel they most obviously allude to the \nnumber of times they have done this or killed someone? But why did the main \ncharacter have such a high number as well?  It makes me think of thousands \nof questions trying to rationalize its context to the story. All of which \nlead to many more questions trying to rationalize a back story that doesn't \nnecessarily make sense with the situation you placed us in.\n\nCritically,\n\nI feel with the effert that seemed to be expended on realism, somethings \nwere just, well, relatively unrealistic.\n\nOverall though,\n\nExcellent independent production!\n\nHuge congratulations, and best of luck in the future!\n\nRyan,\nYou express your best skill as a DP.\ufeff",

There are some plot points that we simply didn't have \ntime to flesh out in a 10 minute film, but I may be able to clear up some \nof your questions: \n\nThe numbers on the ankles are identification, in numerical order according \nto when the candidates entered the program. The fact that the Hunter's \nnumber is \"244\" and Jake's number is \"246\" tells him that the Hunter was \ninitiated just before Jake was. \n\nIf a Prisoner survives, they move to the next level and become a Hunter in \nthe next round...\n\nWhen Jake runs TOWARD the Hunter instead of away, it indicates that he's \nthrough running. He's going to take the fight to the Hunter and end this \nfor good, one way or the other...\n\nHope this helps clear it up a little!",

It was an \namazing short film. \nAlso, do you guys travel a film festival circuit? Does the online shop and \nYoutube give you enough compensation to both live on and keep making cool \nfilms? Or do you have other jobs that fill in the gaps in salary?",

First at the prisoner level where you have to kill to \nsurvive, not because you choose to, but because you have to. If you survive \nyou enter into the second tier - becoming a hunter. Second test is: will \nyou hunt down and kill unarmed men? ...Why, and what all is behind it, I \nwont say. :)",
