First of we will start with your last statement, \"it's called \nfaith\"- faith by definition is to believe in something without evidence, \nwhich is why to understand evolution has nothing to do with faith. \nSecondly, you are aware that the reason its commonly refereed to as a \n\"theory\" isn't because it isn't fact, its simply a label we put on things \nbecause we don't completely 100% understand it to its entirety. That's why \nits called the \"theory\" of gravity, learn scientific terminology please. In \nreality, its actually \"Darwin's Law AND Theory of Evolution\". Evolution is \na fact, proved by evidence, you don't get to \"choose\" to believe in it or \nnot believe in it on the basis of whim or culture. Go back to reading your \nlittle book about some tyrannical sky genie written by a bunch of desert \ndwelling savages over two thousand years ago and leave the real science to \nthe educated people of this planet. Evolution has all been but proven, all \nwe're doing now is just figuring out the exact little details if it all.",

God's not Dead was just \ncompletely flawed in its depiction of Atheists and Muslims.

                    "text": "+TheBatmanNerd That I have to agree with you on. The movie was meant to be \ntold from a very singular perspective. But honestly, that's what it sold \nfrom the very beginning. Truth be told the concept of trying to prove God's \nexistence was never something that any individual could truly do. And \nwhether people cared for the argument or not, that's one of the main things \nthe boy acknowledged in the very beginning. That he couldn't prove God's \nexistence and the other side could not disprove it. So two sides were \nbasically arguing over something they were simply unable to be absolute \nabout. That to me summed up the entire point of most of the religious \narguments that happen. That's why most of the time people resort to just \nfighting with each other when they run out of stuff to use. So to me the \nmovie wasn't meant to teach us factual debates, but just represent how most \nof these arguments happen on a day to day basis in real life. \n\nBut in regards to the atheist and Muslim depiction that is also something I \nnever fully got. This movie does not speak for all Christians and it most \ndefinitely does not speak for all atheists and Muslims. No one should watch \nand think that just because someone of a specific ethnicity and ideology is \nwithin it that it speaks for every single person of that field. That's just \na wrong way to look at anything in general to be honest. This movie was \nshowing certain kinds of people. And the same way Christianity can have \nhypocritical Christians there can also be hypocritical atheists. And \nbelieve it or not people do break way from muslim culture to follow other \nreligions and they are persecuted for it. But just because it showed one \nfamily does not mean it spoke for the entire Muslim culture. \n\nIt's fine if you don't see the movie. I'm not trying to convince anyone to \ngo see it. I'm just saying there are other things to take from it. And even \nwhen somethings happened that I didn't agree with in the movie. There were \nstill things I could take from it. For me this movie doesn't really teach \nus something, but address things that I feel we should be more open about. \nIt's great you have friends of different ideologies. I have several myself. \nUnfortunately contrary to your relationship with your friends. The people I \nknow consistently challenge my religion. Most of them are atheists as well. \nSo I can't fully agree with when people say most atheists don't care about \nreligion, when the experiences I have them tell a different tale. \n\nBut don't misinterpret this as me accusing you of anything. And I'm not \nsaying that atheists are bad and that Christians are good. I'm just \nspeaking from my personal experiences. And I'm sure you've seen your fair \nshare of it as well. People are fighting with each other and it's not all \nharmless name calling. ",

God's Not \nDead depicted an atheist who was just mad at God, (so therefore not really \nan atheist), also the arguments for and against God were extremely weak in \nthe movie, not to mention it barely gave atheists an opportunity to give \nany logical evidence against God.\n\nI know it's a christian movie, but I thought the whole point of the movie \nwas to help Christians who find themselves in similar situations in a \ndebate against atheists, if that is so, the movie doesn't really help out \nChristians in any way, it just paints a bad picture of atheists and \nMuslims, (all atheists are just mad at God, and that all Muslims are scary \nand abusive).\n\nAlso, no professor would ever ask a student to debate for his religion and \nthreaten to fail him, it's just a ridiculous concept. Not all atheists are \nmad at God, in fact no real atheist is mad at God, we don't believe in God. \nMost atheists don't care what people believe in, we just don't like it when \nother peoples religion infringes on our lives. Again, I don't hate God or \nChristianity, (my best friend is devoutly christian) and while I don't plan \non seeing this movie, I have no problem with it, and actually think this \nmovie will be good for the christian community.

It seems to teach nothing of value and perhaps is even \ndamaging due to it's poor portrayal of faith. In Christianity a person with \nabsolute faith would only want what God wants anyways. They give their will \nover to God. Moving a mountain to prove a point is selfish and pointless \nand isn't a proper use of faith. If God wanted a literal mountain moved \nthen it would be done and if someone plays a roll in that it would only be \nbecause there was a specific purpose. Faith doesn't give someone super hero \npowers, rather it means someone has turned their will over to God and is \nmost likely manifested in service to others.",
