If I'm going to swim/surf/paddleboard, I really \ndon't want to be on a beach that allows glass containers, dogs to poop (and \nthey always do), driving, and people trying to put their boats out on the \nwater.  When I want to go camping with my dog, camping, drinking and and \noff-roading, I go to the beach that is designated for that.  They can get \nextremely crowded and there are many locals and non-locals alike so this \nhelps everyone get to do more of what they want to do.

Although they are loud, the frequencies of sound that travel \na long ways are usually muffed, and if you yourself are in a military \nvehicle like a HMMWV, that thing is loud as hell inside, also, they're \ncamouflaged.  Yeah, they're big, but theyre not that tall.\n\nFinally, and this is the big one, \"tank X-ing\" signs are usually FOR TANKS, \ndesignating the places where tracked vehicles are allowed to cross civilian \nroads.

Being an intensely hierarchical system with the supreme leader \nbeing expected to act by fiat to solve all problems means that voices of \ndissent, however well meaning, are viewed as hostile to the leader's \ninfallibility.  Totalitarianism immediately falls into the error of \nemploying loads of yes men and murdering dissenting voices as a threat to \nsocial order.  Similarly the useless yes men are also cast to the winds or \nkilled off if they fail.  We can see an example of this with Vladimir Putin \nrecently when his Ukranian adventure turned sour on him and he sacked 18 of \nhis yes man advisors.  In many ways Hitler represents a large step away \nfrom Clausewitzian theory in the German Military back to a more Napoleonic \n\"Great Captain\" model which badly undermined the purpose of the General \nStaff.  In short, Hitler's entire totalitarian model had a massive built in \ncatastrophe waiting to happen caused by silencing debate and dissent.  So \nbasically, Hitler couldn't really listen to his generals, it cut against \nboth his nature, his party aparatus and the entire totalitarian system that \nhe had built around himself, and he is not the only dictator fo fall prey \nto this.

An easy to repair sign gets damaged rather \nthan a dangerous crash into a bridge?\n10 - This isn't stupid as the \"stop\" sign is for \"here\" and the sign below \nis for the rest of the alleyway\n09 - this is pretty obvious but some people are stupid enough to not \"get \nit\"\n06 - Die ahead - photoshopped sign, (and the plural of DIE is DICE, not the \nother way around, Dolan.)\n05 - The mound sign was there before the dirt - for the road - coincidence \njoke.\n04 - the left lane is likely a fire lane.\n03 - Tank crossing - Come on!! Of course there's tanks crossing (near \nmilitary bases), and they are often unlit, or are poorly visible in the \ndark. There are also aircraft crossings, and trains so what makes tanks so \nsurprising? In Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK you have road signs warning of live \nfire ranges and explosives......\ufeff",

But believe me or not, tanks need to drive around \napart from combat situations and in those cases these signs make a lot of \nsence. Some of the roads fitted with \"No Tanks\" signs might simply be \nunsuitable for heavy vehicles due to not beind wide enough or the ground \nbeing to weak so that the road would sink in or be damaged in any regard. \nYou could ask the same question about any roadsign... Who's gonna prevent \nyou from not stopping at a stop sign or taking a one-way road the wrong \nway. Or who's gonna stop a truck from entering a \"No Trucks\" road? Exactly, \nnobody.",

When theres more traffic, the X's \nare the lanes that have oncoming traffic, the arrows are the lanes that are \ntravelling the direction of the sign that you're reading.  If you were \nheading in the direction of oncoming traffic, the X's and arrows would be \nthe opposite.  It makes sense, but its confusing at first glance. \n Basically the lanes on the road change according to the amount of volume. \n More people heading to work in the morning (eastbound lets say), they have \n3 eastbound lanes open, and only 1 westbound.  Then during normal hours \nthey have 2 lanes open each way.  Then at the end of the work day aka rush \nhour, they have 3 lanes open westbound, and 1 lane open eastbound....since \nmost of the traffic is going in the opposite direction now.  Does that help \nyou understand it?",

The form \"octopi\", as if the \nword were a Latin second-declension noun, is generally considered \nincorrect, but is in fact used, so that it is registered by the \ndescriptivist Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary, which lists \n\"octopuses\" and \"octopi\", in that order, and Webster's New World College \nDictionary, which lists plurals in the order: \"octopuses\", \"octopi\", and \n\"octopodes\". The Oxford English Dictionary (2008 Draft Revision) also lists \n\"octopuses\", \"octopi\", and \"octopodes\", in that order, labelling \n\"octopodes\" as rare and noting that \"octopi\" derives from the \nmisapprehension that oct\u014dpus is a second-declension Latin noun and stating \nthat, if the word were native to Latin, it would be third declension \noct\u014dp\u0113s (plural: oct\u014dpedes) after the pattern of p\u0113s (\"foot\", plural \nped\u0113s). The New Oxford American Dictionary (3rd Edition 2010) lists only \n\"octopuses\" as being the acceptable pluralization, with a usage note \nindicating \"octopodes\" as being \"still occasionally used\", and \"octopi\" as \nbeing \"incorrect\".\nRelated to the word \"octopus\" are the term \"Octopoda\" (the taxonomic order \nof cephalopod molluscs that comprises the octopuses) and the adjective \n\"octopoid\"",

                "text": "A lot of these are nitpicky or just plain misrepresented.  For example:\n\n15: It's a beach. There are a lot of regulations in place to keep it a safe \nand beautiful place to live.  There's no diving so people won't get hurt, \nno vendors because city permits won't allow it, no baseball because they \ndon't need anyone beaned in the head by a homer, no motor vehicles on the \nbeach, etc.\n\n13: Judging by the fact that this sign was placed on a wooden post, I doubt \nit's a legitimate road sign. It's easy enough to purchase custom road \nsigns, and this picture was probably taken to make a funny joke pic on the \ninternet.\n\n11: As a past trucker, I find nothing terrible, bad, or silly about this \nsign.  It makes perfect sense. Make an easily repaired sign act as a \ndefinite warning in place of the difficult to repair bridge (and truck)\n\n10: You're just being a retard with this one. The stop sign is at the point \nwhere you are entering the alley.\n\n9: Again, not silly, not bad, makes perfect sense. You might not be AWARE \nthat you are about to drive past a correctional facility.  It basically \ntells you, 'Hey, there's a correctional facility nearby, so any hitchhikers \nyou see may be escaped convicts.'\n\n3: It's a military base.  If it's a Tank Crossing sign that means there \nwill be tanks crossing.\n\n1: It's a sign WARNING you that should your car break down, there's a long \nway to go for an emergency phone.  It common to see these kinds of signs on \nlong stretches of road that is otherwise undeveloped.\n\nAll in all, Dolan, I find you videos rather forced in how you try to find \nhumor in one thing or another, and it all seems rather silly, but not in \nthe good way.\ufeff",

Number 3 is also a \nworldwide sign where the road law states that any slow moving vehicles that \nmay present a hazard or an obstruction to other road users must be \nhighlighted with signage such as tractors, plant machinery and even \nwildlife, would you rather that you weren't warned about tanks being in the \narea?

                "text": "These actually make sense, but they are unusual and funny.  Large bridges \nhave the lanes change from on time to another because traffic changes when \npeople are going IN to a city in the morning and coming OUT of that city in \nthe late afternoon.  The lane not used at all is there for the unexpected \ntimes of intense travel such as for a big ball game or world fair.  The \ntime zones are around schools, but why it can't just always be 25 mph I \ndon't know if I'd bother.  Just put in a road parallel so it's not an \nissue.  About Santa Cruz, it just means to enjoy the ocean from a distance \nand keep it clean.  Phone in 100 miles will keep a person from hiking \nexpecting to find one.  It should read, \"No phone for 100 miles\".  \nSurprises might be in a park with animalsl  Elk, sand, bison, rabbits. \nelephants, zebras.  Needing to stop for herds. Getting stuck in a herd. \nGetting followed by a herd.\ufeff",
