Also Mayweather \nis no way knocking out Amir, his last Legit TKO, was 8 years ago now \nagainst Ricky Hatton in 2007. Floyd is not a big puncher and will no way KO \nKhan , oh and Amir has arguably the fastest hands in boxing, and has never \nbeen outboxed in his professional career so if Amir and Floyd were to fight \nI'd put my money on Amir.",

Get it now idiot?\n\n'Below, blows your 99% theory out of the window' - you haven't proven shit \nLOL XD. The first article is centered around Thurman trash talking and they \nstill had Amir winning. \n\n-The second article is written by an UNKNOWN writer for the guardian. He \nstill never gave Diaz the win. You haven't proven shit moron. \n\n'if you feel Dan Rafael is credible then that's your opinion, he isn't to \nme' - hes more credible then anyone youve quoted lol. Who all still had \nAmir the winner lmfao and did not see Diaz winning the fight in any way, \nINCLUDING DIAZ HIMSELF. \n\n'You calling me an idiot doesn't prove any of your points.' - everyone \nscored the fight in Amirs favour, all you have to really back up your point \nis one article from the tabloids written by some unknown journalist behind \nthe screen, whos credentials clearly dont lye within the sport of boxing. \nIve on the other hand provided you credible sources. See the difference \nnow? Or is that too much information for you to digest?\n\n'I said I had Diaz winning' - which is why your a nobody.\n\n'most had it close' - most had Amir winning by which i mean 99% of people \nand a small minority had it a draw.\n\n'you're acting as if Khan won this fight easy, he clearly struggled' - no \nones denying that idiot, read between the lines. This was by far Amirs \nworst performance getting used to Virgils fight ethic but he did win the \nfight nonetheless and theirs no controversy surrounding that .\n\n'anyone with half a brain can see this' - is that the only half witted \nremarks you can come up with? well what do you expect from a numb brain? Oh \nyh not much lol. \n\n'Stop embarrassing yourself' - coming from someones whos just been exposed.\n\n'Khan's a good fighter but he struggled with diaz' - still beat him clearly.\n\n'he lost to prescott and didn't avenge it' - just like Pacquio never \navenged the earlier losses in his career to the likes of  Rustico \nTorrecampo, and Medgoen Singsurat by K.O i.e. put to sleep. What does that \nmake him?\n\n'Lewis avenged his loses' - at the end of his career.\n\n'floyd had disputed wins and rematched' - because he clearly lost to \nCastillo by like 4 rounds BIG DIFFERENCE. Many people also thought \nMayweather lost to De La Hoya, and he never gave him a rematch. \n ",

Let me tell you , first of all Amir \nKhan is British and secondly it is America who is giving him every \nopportunity to excel. What Pakistan have given him so far?. Also i must add \nthat  If you belong from a Non Muslim Minority then Pakistan is a Living \nHell for every Non Muslim. You are burnt alive and your are treated worse \nthan animals. But on the contrary it the Western Civilization that gives \nequal opportunity to all including the Muslims.\n  \nIf Amir would be in Pakistan then i am sure his father would remain a taxi \ndriver and he will be following his father's profession rather than chasing \nany of his dreams. \n So kindly come out of this ignorance. Kindly give the credit where the \ncredit is due. Britian is his home and without Britian in my view Amir is \nnothing. So learn tolerance, respect and dont try to hijack someone else \nachievement for your political benefits. Last but no least. I am not some \nWhite Guy andI have Pakistani Origins as well but i have the guts to speak \nthe truth. ",

Last I heard Joe Louis got KO'ed by Marciano, Pacquiao got put to \nsleep by Marquez and he is one of the best boxers of all time and many \nothers for that matter. Losing fights and getting KO'ed is a part of the \nsport if you don't like it don't be involved in boxing. You should be \nmentioning how Khan has come back after those losses, Garcia stopped Khan \nand it's Garcia who seems to have gone backwards struggling against Herrera \nand fighting Rod the lightening Salka lol, Don't hate, congratulate, Khan \nwill be in rings p4p list in the next year. Khan will beat Floyd and \nPacman, he has the style. STYLES MAKE FIGHTS, but that is to complicated \nfor you to comprehend.",
