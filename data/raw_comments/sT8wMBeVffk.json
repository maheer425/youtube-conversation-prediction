Yes, that was \nstill petty in it's own way, but if you compare it to other things it's not \nreally a big deal. Not only that, but Janice did say herself that she knows \nshe's mean, she acknowledges it while Cady had become rather dishonest \nthroughout the movie, flipping from one side to the other. It wasn't until \nthe whole fiasco with Regina taking Aaron back right in front of Cady that \nJanice came up with her plans, and was more out of trying to help Cady and \nlet Regina get what was coming to her and not out of middle school revenge. \nAnd even then, Cady had started to become increasingly obsessed on her own, \ntrying harder to sabotage them on nights where Janice didn't have anything \nplanned. It should also be realized that Regina had ruined Janice's life \nfirst out of her own arrogance, so you can't really blame her for being \nangry.\nHowever, I DO believe that Janice was still being too hard on her in this \nscene. While Cady had essentially become the new Regina, lied about a few \nthings, and needed some scolding, another thing to realize is that before \nthis Cady had been home-schooled. Of course she wouldn't have really known \nexactly what to do in her situation and probably more just wanted to fit \nin, flipping from side to side on the friendship bar. Being the new kid in \na high school is already stressful enough as it is, but even more so when \nyou've never been to a high school at ALL in the past.\nHowever, these are just my opinions and thoughts, everyone has the right to \nthink what they want, I am simply here stating my own opinion.\ufeff",
