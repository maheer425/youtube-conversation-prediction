It's so tiring :(.. \nEspecially when I SUCK at small talk and starting conversations. So I only \nsay hi to my coworkers and smile but it feels like I should say more?

(Like it's nice a nice gesture and all but FUCK \nTHT! Talking to a group of strangers without anyone you know...(shivers)\n\nWhen your friends are going on about some boring ass conversation that you \ncan't follow and you're so tempted to just stick your headphones on and \ndrown in the music.\n\nMeeting your friend's friends.\n\nWhen people tell you \"Don't be shy\"\n\nWhen people ask \"Why are you always so quiet?\"\n\nWhen you get caught trying to avoid conversing with someone.\n\nWhen you go to family dinners and you don't really get along with any \nfamily members your age so you just sit there at the dinner table with your \nheadphones in. And then when you tell your parent \"I don't wanna go to \nfamily dinners anymore.\" They force you to go even though they always make \nyou feel awkward, bored, and like they're are a waste of time if your not \nhaving fun. Just me? Okay):\n\nWhen someone continuously tries to talk to you EVEN THOUGH you have your \nheadphones on. (My mom does this ALL the time, omg it gets seriously \nannoying)\n\nWhen you get so pissed and yell profanities in the middle of a class (and \nreally loud), then everyone looks at you, bewildered that you even spoke \nlet alone yelled swear words. Actually this one I find funny. :D I love \ntheir shocked faces HA~!\n\nWhen you *want* to date someone but are too afraid to actually *go* on a \ndate with ANYONE so you just give up on love (waves forever alone flag~) XD \n \nThis last one might be just me but:\nWhen your forced to share your very personal (and very cheesy) feelings out \nloud to someone but once you do you get this feeling of disgust. Like your \ngrossing yourself out. I think I'm much like a guy in sharing feelings and \nstuff. Ugh I hate it, it's disgusting. And I know it's bad to think that \nway, but eww.\ufeff",

Stranger danger still applies to me, hell I go \ninto a panic attack when ever someone I don't know, so much as looks at me. \nAn as for keeping in thouch with people, unless you make the first move to \ncall me, we probably wont keep in thouch. (; ^ _^) Sorry guys, it's just \nthe way I am, unless it's important business that I have to get a hold of \nyour for, I probably wont call at all. Hell even important business \nsometimes isn't a big enough motivator. Not with strangers. \"xD But if you \ncall me, then I will make the time an I'm all ears.\n\nBut having said that, I'm also lazy and a talker. Being as lazy as I am, \nmeans I'm to lazy for long texting. I'd rather face a 5-20 min conversation \nover the phone then deal with hours, upon hours of back to back texting. \nNot cause I want to talk, but simply because I'm to lazy to talk/type for \nso long. Plus I can't stand ackward silences. So when it's quite or when no \none says anything, I start to panic so bad my mouth moves on its own. Next \nthing you know, I turn into this person who can actually talk to people, \njust cause I'm panicing so much on the inside I need something, anything to \nmake it stop. Then suddenly it's been a gap of time, I made you laugh quite \na bit and it's over. It's finally over and all I want to do is crawl back \nin a whole and hide.\n\nBut hey, if you can get passed that part of me, all the walls and awkward \nmoments, you will get to know another side of me. Someone more open and \nwilling to be the friend you need, even if it takes walking out of my safe \nshell to my own living hell. (Pubic places) I'm willing to do a lot for the \npeople I care about. Thank you to the people who put up with me. =D\n\n\n\nThe Ashdrew! (Squeal)\ufeff",

And social activities \naren't really my thing. They're fun tho.\n\nAvoiding conversation: I like talking to people at times. But their R times \nwhen I'm like \"ugh, my jaw is too lazy to make any noises!\" \n\nBooks: DONT LIE! BOOKS R AWESOME! \n\nWhen no ones home: it's quiet.\nJust you. Free to do whatever weird things u do alone.\nFree to eat the left over snacks. Free to watch the TV on any channel. And \nbest of all: no one will ever know . .\n\nHead phones: people talk about distracting things sometimes. Also they're \nvery comfortable, like earmuffs but future ear muffs ^_^ \n\nRain: it's very peaceful. Just the noise of the rain outside while you're \ninside reading a book. The smoking, soggy and foggy smell of water falling \nfrom the sky. And best of all. Dimming the lights, lighting a single \ncandle, grabbing a laptop, and watching a movie while theirs a relaxing \nthunderstorm outside .. (Also I cannot get to sleep in hot weather! Not \never!) \n\nHiding under covers: it's just so warm and dark! So comforting .. \n\n\nI can't be the only one who has these reasons! \n\n\n\n\ufeff",
