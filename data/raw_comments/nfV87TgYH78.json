If he blew a piston through \nthe block 1/2 way down the track, he wouldn't have finished keeping up with \nthat Supra..\n In the movie world, the Charger has \"900 horses of detroit muscle\".\nThe supra isn't ever specified, but in real life it has about 550whp, \nwithout nitrous. Add the 150shot of nitrous it was running, probably over \n700whp. Vs a 900hp car that just blew a hole in the block.\n\nThese movies are great, very entertaining, but the physics are just unreal.\nLike at racewars, where Jesse's Jetta (with a bolt on ABA 115hp 2.0 8v.. no \nmore than 140bhp without the direct port 150hp shot of nitrous. AND it was \nan automatic) almost beat a Honda S2000, with 240hp stock, a CR 6 speed \ntrans, and \"a hundred grand under the hood\". Such craziness.\n\nSame with the first race. Brian's Eclipse was just a 420a, you can see it \nwhen Jesse pops the hood. He says it has \"I see a cool air intake, a nos \nfogger system and a t4 turbo dominic, I see an AIC controller, it has \ndirect port nitrous injection.. and a stand alone engine management system\".\n Well, first of all, why is there a n2o fogger in the intake path if it has \ndirect injection? That makes no sense. A cool air intake (really a INJEN \ncold air intake) with a t4 turbo? That makes no sense. There is no \nintercooler. The intake manifold has the \"cool air intake\" attached, just \nlike a N/A 420a should. So the F&F Eclipse had ~150hp in real life. It was \nFWD.\nThe Integra GSR driven by Ja-Rule was just bolt on B18C, so no more than \n200bhp.\nAnd Dom was driving a TT RX7.. with a sneakypete nitrous system, a veilside \nexhaust, and more.. and the Eclipse keeps up? There's no way that ever \ncould have happened. There's no way the first scene with the Eclipse ever \ncould have happened..140mph in a parking lot with 150hp? No way jose.\n\nGood movies none-the-less. They're what got me into automobiles!",

I was really inspired by this movie and soon I started to play NFS \ngame seriously. After that,NFS wasn't just another video game,F&F wasn't \njust a movie,Paul wasn't just my favourite actor. He changed my live. Soon \nI started to dream about that I'll get my first car some day. I never had \ngoal in my life,I never had purpose in my life. Paul changed that. He is \nmore then just an actor. He is an Angel. He is my Hero. Thank you Paul. We \nwill all miss you. Today I'll be watching this movie again (second part \nalso).. Today I will play NFS again.
