Yet most of the people saying 1Punch having dreads or Caucasian \npeople doing hip hop is cultural appropriation, aren't even Korean yet \nthey're obsessed with Korean culture. Oh my!! So hypocritical. Plus, just \nbecause Samuel was born in 2002, doesn't mean he can't portray an image \nfrom the 90s or sing a 90s genre. That's like saying \"You can't play \nclassical music, because you weren't born in the 1700-1800s\" People are \nstarting to get really sensitive and dumb. It's 2015, people.

The Chorus sounds like the first two notes of the chorus of Nan \narayo - Taiji and boys. You have a short sample of Biggie's voice. A piano \ndance break, which is also very H.O.T. Addition of big, wide dance moves \nwhich was common in 90's KPOP coreography.\ufeff",

Like \nseriously, look at you...so pathetic hating on a little kid for no reason. \nYou criticize Samuel for his young age and yet...you're the one acting \nimmature and childish. I bet Samuel is even more mature than you. He's \nbasically sacrificing his childhood and will start working from such a \nyoung age. He will bear with all the hardships in the kpop industry while \nstill being a child (Do you even know how much shit kpop idols have to deal \nwith on a daily basis?). The fact that at his age he's already determined \nto deal with this resposibility shows that he's more mature than you.\n\nAnd please, it's just a music video. A lot of kpop groups release \nembarrassing/cheesy MVs, but then later on they come up good MVs/concepts. \nThere's no need to make so much fuss about it. You should be blaming the \ncompany not Samuel, he doesn't run the company and he most likely didn't \nchoose this concept nor his clothes. The company decides all that stuff.\n\nRegardless of how embarrassing this video is, it still showcases these kids \ntalent and potential. And that's what really matters. In this video we can \nclearly see that Samuel is a good dancer for his young age. And in his live \nperformances, he even tries his best to sing live despite the energetic \nchoreography. His live vocals may not be perfect, but then again, he's \nreally young and at least he's trying his best to sing live. There are \nquite a few other idols who are way older than him and still lipsynch most \nof the time, so...Samuel's effort should be commended *not* looked down on \nby immature people like you.\n\n\"By the time his balls even drop\" <-- Girl please...Samuel at only 13 \nfreaking years old is going to take on the *FREAKING.KPOP.INDUSTRY*. That \nlittle kid has got *WAAAY more balls* than anyone in this comment section \n(including me). I'm pretty sure *NO ONE* in this comment section would have \nthe balls to do what this kid is doing, let alone doing it at friggin 13 \nyears old. Do you even know how harsh/sketchy/dark/dangerous the Kpop \nindustry really is? You probably don't know shit about everything that goes \non behind the scenes in the kpop industry, so...you better start educating \nyourself so that you can understand why Samuel has got way more balls than \nyou.",

I mean, dang, I'm a green-horned 24, but I can \nstill greatly appreciate Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, JAMES BROWN (I \ncaught that sample in the beginning ^^) and the late miss Etta James RIP, \nto name a few. I'll never be able to relate intimately with the 70s music \nlike my dad or 80s music like my mom, but because they exposed me to the \njoys of both, I'm able to respect related music even to the point of having \na favorite artist or two.

People always assume. \nAssuming is really ignorant.. I mean for all you know, these boys here \nmight actually KNOW the history behind this hairstyle and so on. Also it's \nabsolutely ridiculous for you to compare this to nazi get-up or \nblack-face.. cmon girl...\nI just mean that just because somebody did a style first, such as this \nhairstyle, doesn't mean that someone of different culture cannot wear it. \nThese boys have no malice intentions. They are not racists or anything \nelse.  People need to lighten up. If we would get riled up over every \nsingle thing, no one would be allowed to do anything. No one would learn \nanything. Everyone would be scared of accidentally offending somebody \nbecause \"ohh maybe this color combination symbolizes something to this \ngroup of people\" when this person simply just likes the colors. This boy \nappreciates this particular hairstyle.\n If one identifies too much with a group, they'll lose their individuality.\nI know that there will always be people who get angry over something that \nthey find to be their own. It is a whole different thing to wear something \nout of malice, for example a nazi uniform than to wear a simple hairstyle \nthat has been around with many cultures. People need to chill out because \neverything has it's own history and deeper meaning. Also, I'm just saying, \neveryone is ignorant in something, even you. There is always someone in \nthis world to get angry to someone over a matter of just not knowing. I am \nnot saying that it's a good excuse to wear a nazi uniform but for example, \nif there was a group of people whose ancestors came up with the idea of a \nred mini skirt and it is tied with a horrible and significant history with \nthese people, would you stop wearing the skirt? (you can replace the skirt \nwith any other neutral looking thing that has been around and seen on many \npeople for some time now) and cases like these would keep coming up.. you \nare not allowed to wear it just because you are not them!\nIn my home country, there are SO MANY people who have this hairstyle. It's \nseen as a norm here. Also men tend to have super long hair in general here.\nLet's say that my white friend would get this hairstyle and knew about the \nhistory, then what? It's ok?? \nBtw,  Everyone's hair turns into dreadlocks if you never comb it, so \nprobably everyone had dreadlocks before combs were invented. Jamaicans \ndefinitely weren't the first people with dreadlocks. And by the way, many \nof us black women straighten our hair, Is that wrong too?\n\nAgain, my english is not good but I just hope to get you see some \nperspective with THIS issue with this hairstyle - NOT with a nazi uniform. \nsorry for long text ^^",

They could be wearing a Nazi get up, Native \nAmerican tribal clothes, black face, baggy pants and a tattooed tear on \ntheir face, and YES they have the right to wear and do whatever they want \ncause it's their own body.

They have a terrible or \nmeaningful history to them that no on who doesn't realize the repercussions \nshould appropriate. THERE ARE going to be people who will backlash you for \nit.

And actually, dreadlocks have only been \nknown prior to Jamaicans in Hindu yogis--diffused thanks to their \nenslavement when brought to the Americas, and Jamaicans were the only ones \nto hold them in such high regard and made them a religious thing. The \n'many' that you speak of is actually a false statement. Whether or not it \nwas spread, these boys are obviously wearing it/fashioned in it's urban \ntradition (the Rastafarian way), so that kills your argument of it being \ninfluenced from another culture.
