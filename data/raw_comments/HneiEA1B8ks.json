An \nobservable resistance to flow that causes gravitational lensing. Dark \nenergy causes space-time expansion and moves through space time like a \ncold, quantum fluid. This tidal force, like a current of water, affects the \nmovement of objects with mass. The greater the mass an object possesses, \nthe greater the resistance to flow.  Spiral galaxies are where dark matter \nis observed through gravitational lensing. The spiral arms do not fly apart \ndue to this resistance where they stay intact like hurricanes or leaves \nfloating in a liquid whirlpool. Scientists estimate that dark energy \naccounts for approximately 68 percent of what exists (matter and energy) in \nthe known universe. Could such a large percentage of energy be a sort of a \nuniversal engine of the cosmos, affecting everything in its path; and \ncreating motion, gravitational lensing, and dark matter? Dark matter \naccounts for approximately 27 of the mass-energy of the universe. Is it \npossible to have two unknown forces accounting for such a large percentage \nnot be two tied to each other through some cause and effect relationship? \nPerhaps force is a better description since we don't know dark matter as \nactual matter but can only observe its effects. Perhaps a force is the more \nappropriate description in the same manner as gravity.",

Dark matter is really just regular matter, with quarks and leptons \nand gluons to hold it together, its just that is only visible via dark \nphotons.

You have to look \nat the context of that story, if you are curious, you can check here \nhttp://christianthinktank.com/qmeanelisha.html. God punished not only them, \nbut their parents, who diverted from God and turned to worshipping many \nidols. They did not raise their children God-fearing and respectful to his \nprophets, and to other people. God cut their lives short also to avoid \ngreater evilness they would do if they grew up. However, that story \nhappened if the Old Testament, when people were different and other \nmeasures might not have worked, so such bitter lessons were taught. We live \nin the New Testament time, when the whole relationship between humans and \nGod is different. God does not need to appear like a punisher and have \npeople follow him out fear, like it was in the Old Testament, when people \nwere more primitive, but revealed his love to the world, and wants us to \nfollow him out of love.\n\nGod is never angry, God is  love, and everything he does is out of love. He \ndoes not want us to suffer forever in hell, that is why he uses different \nmeasures to turn us on a righteous way in our short lives, that will lead \nus to Heavenly Kingdom and eternal bliss after death. What kind of loving \nmother will feed her kid with sweets and chocolates to keep a child happy \nfor a while, if she knows it will lead to child's sickness and suffering in \nthe future? However, God cannot force anyone into Heaven. If a person does \nnot want, even God cannot save him.\n\nWith all that said, God's ways are miraculous and often are hidden from our \nunderstanding, because we do not see a greater scheme of things. We all \nhave God's voice within us, though, which is our conscience, and behave \naccording to how our conscience tells us to. We all look for beauty, \nkindness, love, fairness, forgiveness. Let's hope that everybody hears that \nvoice, and then our world will become a much better place to live, without \nwars, terrorists and immoralities.  ",

Just blow up a balloon \n(airpressure holds it up against the elastic force of the rubber) and \ncompare it to a balloon where you hold a hot item inside. See the \ndifference?\nWhy would you not know that? Do you even notice the world around you?\n\nHere is a slightly more physical explanation: pressure is force per area. \nTemperature is the average kinectic energy of the smallest particles in a \nmedium. So if you look at a hot plasma (low particles density, but very \nhigh energy) you'll notice that they are not the same (pressure almost 0 \nbut temperature very high), since you can compare it with high pressure \nwater (i.e. in the ocean depths) where there is very high pressure but low \ntemperature.\n\nThere is a relation between pressure p and temperature T though. For an \nideal gas:\np V=N k_b T\n\nThe Kelvin scale was introduced to define absolute 0 as the 0 on the \nmeasurement scale. So no.\nIt can be used for precision measurements today, but it also get's \ninaccurate below 20K or above 1300K ...\n\nYea, youtube is an accurate source of knowledge. That's also why all \nscientific discoveries are always published on youtube (as opposed to peer \nreviewed journals, books, conferences ...). And everybody knows that \neverybody who publishes their videos on youtube about physics actually \nunderstands what they are talking about. This is also why you should always \nsimply believe everything on youtube!\n\nWhat's wrong with you? Are you drunk? High on drugs? Do you have brain \ndamage? Did your parents drop you on the head? Or have you not figured out \nhow to use it?\n\nYea, I've never seen somebody so far removed from reality, as you ...\nAlmost nothing you claim is anywhere close to what we know about the world \n(with the exception of a half-sentence you quoted from wikipedia here and \nthere). Most of the stuff is plain wrong. You should have noticed that just \nby living!\nAnd knowledge is not the same as making stuff up and claiming it to be true \n(as you do).",

Every debate I've had, from my experience, has had every religious \nperson yell at me for being stupid and saying \"everything can come from \nnothing\" and all their answers trace back to faith. The word 'faith' is the \nbelief in something without evidence, which is something I'm not \ncomfortable doing. Now, back to my \"everything can come from nothing\". Go \nwatch TED-Ed's video 'What happened to antimatter?' That should explain it \nfor you. ",

This True Science you speak of, has \nbeen founded on Un proven Theories. Not Lab Tested Results. Plasma Physics \nand Lab Driven Tested, and Peer Reviewed Results have time and time again, \nPerfectly described what is seen in space.  These fools that tell you what \nto think, even tell you space is full of energy, but call it Dark Energy \nwhich is \"NOT Detectable\" yet, but with a few trillion dollars more, they \nmay be able to devise another theory that will describe that with more \nmyths that if you dont understand, well, you just don't get the \n\"Science\"... \n\nFact is Space is Not a Vacuum, but is dense with energy.  The Sun is NOT a \nBig Nuclear Explosion that is in a constant state of explosion.  Have you \never seen a Nuclear Bomb Tested? They dont self Sustain.   and when they DO \ngo off, they do not limit themselves in the size of the explosion. That is \ndirectly a factor to the size of the Fuel Source.  Thus if the sun was just \na Almost Everlasting Gobstopper of a Self Sustaining, Self Containing, \nNuclear Explosion, then maybe it is alive too huh?  \n\nGet Real. Think in terms of Electrical Components and Circuits, which by \nthe way, Birkeland Currents are extensively found in the \"VACUUM\" of space \nbetween nearly all bodies, from Stars to planets. One recent discovery by \nthose telling you the BIG BANG is it, and we are in Rapid Expansion, have \njust found the birth of MULTIPLE Stars in a High Energy String of Plasma, \nin what is called the SNAKE NEBULA.. This was just found only weeks ago.\n\nIt was also discovered over the last 5 or so years. that the sun has a \nelectromagnetic connection not only to the earth, but to every planetary \nbody in our solar system. It was further found that the Earth has a \nElectromagnetic Connection to the Moon.  These include a flow of of energy \nto and from each body.  They have also proven these Birkeland Current \nconnections between Saturn and its moons, Mars and Its moons as well as the \nother Bodies and the Moons that orbit them, as they themselves orbit the \nSun. Locked not in a Gravitic Orbit as proposed by these fools you let lie \nto you, but by the ElectroMagnetic Connections between them...\n\nYou are Far far behind the curve young man.  You had better get your head \non right and start looking at Plasma Physics and its Lab Tested Results \nthat prove without a Doubt, the Universe is not a Vacuum, but is filled \nwith Electricity called the Aether, just as Nikola Tesla proved at the turn \nof the 20th century, over 100 yrs ago now.... \n\n\nBesides, if you actually believe Einstein thought his THEORY(read that as \nNEVER YET PROVEN BY ANY LAB TEST OR ACTUAL TESTS IN SPACE) of Relativity \nwas all there was, you do not know Einstein.  He himself never like it, as \nit had to ELIMINATE the Electrical Nature of Space.\n\nEinstein was asked in the mid 1930s by a Reporter, \"Mr. Einstein, how does \nit feel to be the Smartest Person on Earth?\", to which Albert Einstein most \naptly replied, \"I do not know, you will have to ask the good Dr. Tesla for \nthat answer.\"",

What's that about?\nEither there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like \nyou provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly \nas we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind \nof energy driving the acceleration, and they called it <i>dark energy</i>. \nToday's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the \nuniverse is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the \nuniverse and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us.\"  \n\nIs it just me, or aren't the two options (an \"accelerator\" vs gravity not \n\"working the way we think it does\") mutually inclusive?  The acceleration \nfactor is exactly the element that is not being attributed to \ngravit[y]ational pull...or push.  Get it?  \"...just like [YOU] provide \nenergy to accelerate a car\"...adds an additional entity to the acceleration \nfactor being considered.  YOU.  It really is that simple.  But if it's not \ndifficult, then no one really gets famous, right? With gravity being the \nweakest BY FAR (as \"understood\") of the four fundamental forces (which I \nfind ironic, as compared/contrasted to the initially mentioned proposed \nfour physical elements), that the debate now centers around the mysteries \nof the weakest of four fundamental forces, and their interaction with an \ninfinitely possible number of \"string-things\", and their \"harmony\", whilst \nwe argue about the true strength of the \"weakest\" force - the one whose \ncharacteristics, now being questioned, have led to the proposition of \ncomplexities like \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\".  Does anyone out there \neven understand what I'm getting at?  Does anyone else even care?  Can any \nof you even wrap your head around what I'm really trying to say?  Peanut \nButter.  And JELLY.\n\nE=mc^2  Energy = mass x speed of light squared.  Sounds like matter and \naction, the \"goings on\" of experience, are tied much more to gravity, and \nthe forces, than to the mass of matter.\n\nIt doesn't matter.  It's all forced upon you.  Perhaps \"dark energy\" is our \nthoughts, and \"dark matter\" is what they're made of.  Everything else is \nbullshit leftovers, not the other way around.  This is why we cannot solve \nthe \"Problem of Consciousness\" or \"Dualism vs Naturalism\" - we are too \nengrained in it.  If conscious beings stopped thinking, the universe would \nstop expanding.  Our experience is what provides the vast majority of \n\"matter\" in the universe.  Shame on you if you are so short sighted to not \nbelieve that rather than there being a conscious being that created the \nuniverse, that at the very moment of the birth of the universe, a conscious \nbeing was created.  If life ceased to exist, just as the proverbial tree in \nthe forest, there would be no universe.  \n\nShort fairy-tale time:  God decides to come to Earth, but the twist, the \nturn of the screw, is that in order to become an Earthly being, it must \nforget that it's God.  What if God was one of us?  It wouldn't - couldn't - \nknow.  That's the rub.  Now pass the tanning oil.  ;)\ufeff",

To the others Who are so much more \nenlightened than to believe in \"Religion\", how are you able to believe so \ndeeply in a subjective ideology that stems from a very infantile rationale \nfor the conceptual reality of what may be represented in an infintie amount \nof ways as the conceptualization for the universe, but immediatley through \nout Religion? If you are truly a scientist than I want to see the imperical \ndata that leads to the proof or disproof of this theory that God does or \ndoes not exist according to your \"open\" minded rational. If there is \nliterally an ability to explain the conceptualization for the universe some \nwhere between Zero and infinite, then Danielle is no more right or wrong \nthan you are. The possiblity for an infinite being(s) is completely within \nthe rational of conceptualization for the explination of all things just as \nmuch as a single string creating all known forms at an anatomical level is, \nand who is to say that string is not a being rather then a string, or maybe \neven the string is the being?

God? no, dark \nmatter and energy. however you should have explained the big bang theory. \ndark matter picked up when they used the theory to predict the age of the \nuniverse. they where waaaay off (~1 billion years was a bit too young). so \ndark matter became a convenient smudge to readjust energy-mass equations. \nyeah.. but a wild guess is always a wild guess and reality is always a bit \nwilder that is why we have suns in our galaxy 4 times older than the big \nbang. i find hard to swallow both of them at the same time. dark energy is \nsomething exactly like dark matter. an easy explanation for something we \ncannot understand.\n\npoint being, dark matter and dark energy are like greek epicycles, fitting \nthe description of an earth centered universe. point, the big bang theory \n(the mathematical father of both therms) has failed every single prediction \nin it's initial form, no matter how much we modify it's equations the \ntheory and even the hypothesis is false.\n\nHubble and redshift: there are countless bodies out there which do not \nfollow the graph of Hubble which has trends of spectroscopic data in \ncorrelation with light intensity (i.e. speed and distance). the real data \nis big blob of points, no clear trend, Hubble constant. in my \nopinion Hubble down right forged the data (he got addicted to success). in \nany case, he still has a place in history.\n\napparent redshift: intergalactic particulate matter is good at filtering \nhigh frequency light, bad at filtering lower frequency. in fact that low \ndensity medium can be a conductor for low frequency EM radiation, you can \nobserve the same in acoustics via resonance studies of different materials \nat different lengths.\n\nCMB and the bang: microwave background radiation is contrary to popular \nbelief not a proof of the big bang. the big bang allows for it and that is \njust it. however, it is one of the first failure of the theory. static \nuniverse predictions ranged from 0.75 to 20K. bang prediction putt the \nradiation at about 50Kelvin. well, i will not point out the results, it is \nquite obvious. however, there are allot of re-estimations along the line, \nfitting the theory to the observations and new theories.\n\nfinal point. if a theory needs so many readjusting in order to fit the data \nthat it should be capable to predict then the theory itself is the problem. \nand at this point i seriously tend to think of cosmology as a religion if \nthe big bang does not fall soon. it is a too damn convenient idea. it has \ntoo much resemblance to most monotheistic religions. God created everything \nin 7 days - the big bang created everything in couple of minutes. i don't \nthink there is an able minded person out there who cannot draw a parallel.\n-\nso why do galaxies spin in a mysterious way? mostly because they \nare mysterious. it is frustrating not to know but that in itself is not an \nincentive to make educated guesses and consider it pillars of science. \nnearly 100% (because i am too damn lazy to type so many \"9\"s after the \n\"99.\") of stuff out there is plasma. so, i tend to think in addition to \ngravity, electromagnetism is the main force governing the motion and \nstructure of the universe. in fact, i go as far as to say it is the main \nforce.\n\nso, is the universe a static electromagnetic soup? i do not believe that. \neverything needs a stir to produce complexity, however, is is definitely \nnot as simple as firecrackers in the abyss.\n\n- do not ask for documentation, i am not a whore of other people's mind \neven if i let them inspire me\ufeff",
