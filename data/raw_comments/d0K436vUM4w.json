First, allow \nme to begin by saying I can see what was entertaining about this movie and \nhow it can be enjoyable among some in the audience. But not to the degree \nof greatness that some people took it. I never felt like I was watching a \nsuperhero movie when I was watching GOTG. It didn't inspire me or move me \nor make that powerful & impacting impression on me that the dramatic hero \nepics do. I'll give you Green Lantern & Superman Returns as being bad \nmovies, but I prefer the serious, dramatic, moving hero epics of the DC \nfilms. I'll take the Dark Knight trilogy, Man of Steel, and Watchmen films \nany day and they'll hold up well years from now whereas silly, lighthearted \nfare like Guardians won't. In my opinion, we will look back at GOTG years \nfrom now much the same way we look at the Adam West 1960s Batman TV show \nnow. The serious, inspiring, moving hero dramas will always stand the test \nof time where the lighter, comedy-driven hero pieces will only leave us \nlooking back asking to ourselves, \"What were we thinking?\"\ufeff",

And in addition to that, if you thought Guardians of the Galaxy was \nin no way inspiring or heroic, then you weren't paying attention. Just \nbecause it's funny doesn't mean it can't also be inspiring. There were \nseveral inspiring moments of heroic self-sacrifice. And its even more \ninspiring because these actions are coming from characters that otherwise \nseemed kind of self-interested loners. An idealistic paragon of goodness \ncontinuing to be a paragon of goodness is less interesting and less \ninspiring than seeing a greedy self-serving mercenary have a change of \ncharacter, and decide to risk his life to fight for the good of the people, \nwithout reward of riches. It sort of says, \"See, even this troublesome \nrascal can do the right thing and be a hero. Anyone can make the choice to \nstep up and do the right thing. You can too.\" How is that not inspiring?

That's why nobody ever heard of \nGhostbusters, Back to the Future, Pirates of the Caribbean, Men in Black, \nWayne's World, or all those forgettable Indiana Jones movies. Are you just \na pissed off DC-fanboy who has to find a reason to slander good movies \nbecause they're from Marvel or are you just the type who hates to laugh and \nhaving a good time and thinks brooding and being emo is the only thing that \nmakes a real hero? If so, thanks. You are one of the people responsible for \nDC movie makers changing the character of Clark Kent in Man of Steel into a \nbrooding emo guy instead of a larger than life hero who actually inspires \nhope and heroism in people like he SHOULD. Just because the Nolan-Batman \nwas such a huge success, now they think they have to turn ALL their \nsuperheroes into Batman for them to be cool. I shudder to think what they \nwill do to Wonder Woman. At least the Marvel heroes have diversity in \ncharacter and the movies don't take themselves too seriously. Guardians was \ngreat for what it was. It had good action, great humor and still had enough \ntime to give the characters some depth and some serious moments. Watched it \nlike four times since it came out and every time I was greatly entertained. \nWatched Man of Steel once and have mixed feelings about it. Watchman gets \ntedious and longwinded with far too much slow-mo after watching it twice. \nAnd among the Dark Knight Trilogy only the first two, or at least the \nsecond one holds up every time I watch it, mostly because of the awesome \nJoker-performance. The third just raises too many questions the more you \nthink about it. I like dark and serious movies as well as lighthearted and \nfunny movies. Both can be great and both can suck. But implying that one is \nbetter because it's more \"serious\" and therefore will be the only thing to \nbe remembered is just stupid.",

I'm \nreally not sure how Marvel / Disney can pull off something that insane and \nmake anyone other than long-time Marvel fans happy. At least this movie \nintroduces us to Cosmic Entities, albeit the skull of a dead one.\n\nI mean, how is a casual audience supposed to be interested when the villain \n(Thanos) is so powerful that he takes out half the life in the universe \njust by wishing it? When The Avengers don't even begin to present a \nchallenge? When the ultimate battle is between Thanos (whom we have only \nseen sitting in a chair thus far) and what are ultimately \"gods\" in the \nMarvel Universe? Marvel + Disney seem to have a great formula for pleasing \nfans and casual viewers alike, but I worry that they won't be able to pull \nthe conclusion to all of this off.\n\nThis actually makes the third Infinity Stone / Gem we have seen. The first \nwas in Loki's staff in The Avengers. Another in Thor: Dark World.\n\nOh, and one of the main characters in the Infinity Gauntlet was an Easter \negg that is easy to miss in this. Adam Warlock's cocoon was one of the \nthings in the Collector's gallery.\n\nLastly, does this mean that we're going to be getting a Nova movie or \nintroduction anytime soon?\ufeff",

But, is that it?\nAnd Rocket, an animal experiment who can talk. Honestly, with the hype, I \nthought he was going to be a spitfire character like Deadpool. Rocket seems \npretty angry for most of the movie.\n\nMaybe it's because I've never read Guardians of the Galaxy, and am not \nreally a Marvel fan, but it seems really cliche. I like how it has \nanti-heroes/enemies who work toward a common good, but it's always that \nsame reason; money. I think the Avengers is a better movie when it comes to \nanti-heroes/enemies becoming heroes.\ufeff",

Marvel has been at the top for a while, \nand now that it's owned by Disney, it's sort of impossible for DC to even \ncome close to matching it's abilities. We all know phase 3 will basically \nbring some of the greatest movies in years. I'm not saying DC's collection \nis horrible, but it can't compete with marvel (and I am only refering to \nmovies where marvel owns the rights to the characters, spiderman for \nexample is not part of this statement). The most valid argument I've seen \nso far as to why Guardians is not one of the best movies this year was that \nthe plotline was too simple. Let me use Star Wars as an example. The \nplotline to all six films is good versus evil. The dark side and the light \nside, the sith and the jedi, the empire and the rebels. It's a simple \nconcept, yet the Star Wars franchise has made millions, if not billions, \nbecause it doesn't involve a complicated storyline, and even children can \nunderstand the basics of the movie. \ufeff",

Why didn't Ronin just go \ndown in a random ship to the ground when they sent out their initial fleet, \nwhy would he hide behind a barrier if he's that powerful and can actually \nsurvive a crash if needed... 3. Why does every bad guy use a stun weapon, \neven the blue daughter, It was more of an annoyance to the green chick than \nactually murderous. Like seriously.
