A lawyer? A CEO? A rockstar?\n\n\nMy takeaway from this person's talk is that there needs to be more than one \npath for people to follow towards a happy and healthy life.

I tend to believe that \nthe private sector (assuming strong property rights) is less violent than \nthe damage government has done like wars, oppression of its people and \ncreating gross inequality. I know about Milton Freidman but I don't fully \nknow his position. Idisagree with his monetary policy. In a free market the \nones who are the most productive may be the successful but it doesn't come \nat a cost to other people. It actually does the opposite. Why I say this is \nbecause with more production comes cheaper prices. The wages for people \nworking for a low wage can buy more and life is less costly. A capitalistic \neconomy rewards people who provide goods that are demanded by people to \nimprove their life. A capitalistic economy encourages production of the \ngoods demanded in the most efficient manner because of the price system \nthat cannot be replicated in other systems. Unless you can replace market \nprices without a market, capitalism is a great system. Know that without \ngovernment stifling competition corporations have to be valuable to its \ncustomers or else they will leave. Customers have the power by voting with \ntheir wallet. Morally, free market capitalism has liberty and property \nrights unequalled as compared to socialism which ignores private property. \nTheir is more freedom and the working class benefits too.",

Fact is, if \nland owners only needed to work 2 hours a day to feed their immediate \nfamily members, that means they were not contributing  to any larger \ncauses. Like paying percentage of income to larger, more organized groups \nwho could think, plan and act further into the future. Who would have said \nthat such landholdings were being \"under utilized\". This was the logic at \nwork I think, and how terrain was settled in the past, by merging and \ncombing interests and wealth, to form central powers. Either by force, or \nby persuasion. Otherwise there would only be chains of self-interested \nsmall holders, that would run into problems when disaster strikes. Another \nolder word for this is of course called paying tribute (if not paying for \nprotection), especially because it would have involved giving up amounts of \npersonal independence and wealth to something larger. That's where the \nbrain versus brawn dichotomy comes in doesn't it? How to persuade other to \ngive up more of themselves, to be part of something larger than themselves?\ufeff",

This is a beautiful way \nto view the world, but unfortunately due to the massive growth in \npopulation because of technology, artificial food production, etc, the \nworld population is just too large for all of us to live this way. We all \nmake up one larger organism, and if you increase the availability and \namount of food, the survivability and health, and the means of \ntransportation to a ever-growing organism then it will continue to grow. \nFor me personally, that is where the real challenge arises. The challenge \nis that you must take the principles Jon discusses here and live by them in \nour modernized world. Why? Because there are many people out there that are \nborn into poverty in a system that does not allow them to go off and live a \nnatural life but rather continue to struggle in the system to barely \nsurvive. Where is a person of poverty going to move in New York to grow \ntheir own rice and build their own home? If we all begin to live and think \nlike Jon though, we could begin by making smaller changes. Maybe that means \nsimply buying food from local organic sources, or instead of buying the \nlatest gadget or new car you can use that money to make sure that a person \nhas a meal to eat. Instead of using your free time to endlessly surf the \nweb, dedicate some of that time to volunteer to local co-ops of any sort, \nor play a more active role in local politics. Again I agree with what Jon \nsays here, but it just is not realistic for us to all just move to the \nmountains and live a natural life so we must do our part within the system. \nHopefully in time the world will evolve to represent some of the ideals Jon \nspeaks of here.\ufeff",

I feel \nlike it's wrong\"\n\nHis questioning is actually related to capitalism itself. Capitalism is a \nvery good system in the sense that it gives every person a chance to \nimprove, regardless of who they are, as well as providing people with the \nfreedom to chose the way they want to live. However, we pay a very high \nprice to maintain it: this system naturally generates huge social \ninequality, which means that the enormous wealth of very few people is kept \nby the hard work of billions of people, structured in a very complex and \ngigant hierarchical network of job division across the planet. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I fully support a system that rewards the ones who \nwork harder. But capitalism as it is today is a complete joke: While people \nstruggle to have a decent life in the poorest parts of the world, suffering \nfrom every kind of disease from anything they eat or any water they drink, \nmultimillionaries struggle to make their first billion dollars, negotiating \nshares of stockmarkets, and making private investments in various bussiness \nacross the planet just for the sake of watching the numbers on their bank \naccount grow, as if it was a game. But it's not. It's mathematics: the \nworld has a limited amount of money, and if someone makes more, it's \nactually taking away from someone else, in this case, from the ones who \nneeded it the most, to the ones that didn't need it at all. \ufeff",

            "text": ". . . Jon Jandai was a happy child in the countryside of Thailand. He \nfollowed advice to go to the big city and get a good education. He found \nthe academic work ethic there put him on a path where he worked hard in a \nnon-sensical world for crazy goals, and little returns. He lived in squalor \nand discomfort trying to achieve the standard goals of the society. The \nbest achievers there learned how to \"pave paradise and put up a parking \nlot\" (Joni Mitchell). Eventually he decided to return home and live a \nsimple life which we have heard before from John Denver in the song: Thank \nGod I'm a Country Boy. Those who did better than Jon in the urban school \nbuilt a house in 3 months, like he did in the country, but his former \nclassmate (the supposedly smarter city kid with a good education) had to \nassume a 30 year mortgage. Because he did not have to do this, he figures \nhe gained 29 years and 10 months extra time to enjoy living. Jon Jandai \nsays that people have 4 basic needs: food, shelter, clothing, and health, \nand to obtain them you do NOT need to sacrifice and work so hard. He says \nit is possible to live a life of ease and leisure and work very little. He \nsays the modern, industrial mindset has made for the most crazy and \ninhumane working and living conditions. He says he has not purchased \nclothing for 20 years, and yet he is given too much clothing all the time, \nso he has to give it away himself. All of this Henry David Thoreau type of: \nSimplify, Simplify, Simplify talk is also reminiscent of Jesus's sayings in \nthe Sermon on the Mount: Behold the birds of the air: for they sow not, \nneither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father \nfeedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Consider the lilies of the \nfield, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say \nunto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of \nthese. Matthew 6:26~30. He declares that a bird or natural animal builds \nit's home or nest in a day or two. Human beings think they are so smart, \nbut they get in debt for 30 years to build their nests. He implies this is \nnot superior intelligence: it is crazy and stupid. All of this back to \nnature, simple, sensible country life advice is given by an appealing \ncountry gentleman with sincerity, charm, and a quiet, persuasive urgency to \nmodern mankind to save our lives from the hellish, non-sensical, endless \ntreadmills, human hamster wheels, and idiotic sacrifice of the conventional \nurban lifestyles of the uber-smart, upwardly mobile people we all admire to \nour great detriment. He urges that sacrificing health and most of lifetime \nfor relentless pursuit of money has left people impoverished. He says we \nlive in the most inhumane times because of that. He exemplifies and urges a \nreturn to a gentle, rural, agricultural lifestyle, and renewal of sensible, \nnormal human connection with family, friends, and neighbors.\ufeff",

You become \naware of your very perception. Its like being aware that you are watching \nyour life happen through a cinema screen, and you control the movie, except \nthat you don't know where the place is that you control it from. And you \ncan increase the resolution of the movie by meditating, and the effect is \nimmediate. The more I have meditated, the more I realize that the world can \nbe perfect If we only choose to see it that way. And being in this state is \ncomplete bliss, because nothing can ever be perceived as wrong - life can \nonly be seen as a fun game, and the so called 'evil' is merely a challenge \nto overcome in order to improve. And the funnest part of the game is \nfiguring out what the game is all about - analyzing the way the mechanics \nwork and how best to improve your control over your own character. Meditate \ndeep enough and you might even learn cheat codes, like supernatural \nhealing. Before I meditated, I thought that healing could be done, but only \nby special people with lots of experience. But now I see that anyone can do \nit, as long as they have faith. I can understand why people get scared away \nfrom the idea of spiritual meditation, but in the end you dont have to do \nit for spiritual reasons - but you will probably end up being spiritual \nbecause of it,",

Another problem is that \nmoney has too much power in certain decisions. In capitalism, it's a bad \nbusiness to make a very good product because people would buy that kind of \nproduct only once. Instead there is many forces that cause products to age, \nlike the only purpose of fashion is to make your old car or clothes look \ncrap and make you to buy a new item. Or house that isn't built to last. For \nexample a wooden house, technically can stand 500 years. Still normal \npeoples houses nowadays are build with so low quality that they must be \nrebuilt every 50 years. Indeed does great for economy and peoples jobs but \nvery much explains why we have to be all the time working.\n\nBut should still understand that if everyone lived like the man in this \nvideo, we would not have: modern healthcare, internet, comfortable homes \nthat are easy to live in, easy jobs in the office, as most hard manual work \nis now done by machines. Instead we might have a lot of free time. But \nbecause people are naturally active, they want to do something with their \nfree time. And in western countries it has went to that many people use \ntheir free time to increase their living standards.\n\nReason why houses are expensive in western countries is more that the \nproperty is expensive and there is very heavy bureaucracy in the building \nregulations, and third of course the law of capitalism here again demand, \neveryone want a house which forces the prices to increase. My grand parents \nand their ancestors mostly built their houses by themselves. Although here \nin the north it doesn't happen as easily as in the video, because it's -40 \nC in the winter, you need a good house. They were also farmers but to my \nunderstanding life is much easier now than then. Then all work was done \nmanually that can now be done by machines.",

They had \nmuch less free time that we do now and they had to work hard, physically, \nmuch of the day, maybe apart from winter time since they had stored food \nand livestock ready to be killed. It wasn't also that rare for people to go \nhungry or die from typhoid or influenca. Infant mortality rate was also \nhigh compared to nowadays. I think what Jon describes is idealized.

            "text": "+Herman Pienaar Listen carefully, and try to understand your peer, for he \nis not contradicting what you are saying. What I understand from him is \nthat TODAY, even if you don\u00b4t like it or disagree with it, land is owned by \nsomeone by law. That is not to say we approve or disagree, or that is bad \nor good: it is what it is. So I agree that is questionable  to carry on \npracticing the concept of ownership if we want a healthy society, but that \ndoesnt mean that private property does not exist (I wish it didn\u00b4t though) \nand that we should all take a piece of the earth for ourselves. We are 7 \nbillion people, I don\u00b4t think that an exponential system such as \ndemographics its sustainable in time in a relation of 1 house-1 individual, \nlet alone 7 houses 1 individual. Why he needs so many houses, when there \nare millions of homeless people?. I dont recall him saying he built those \nhouses for somebody else. Im not saying that some people should not have a \nhome because there is no room, on the contrary I\u00b4 m saying that our system \nits detrimental for several reasons, ownership its only one of them. So I \nthink its fair to question that point (where he got the land from), given \nthat its not explained in the video where the land he owns comes from.  I \nsuspect, from the story he tells, that its a family house: his family owned \nthe land and passed it on to him. But he still owns it. And many people on \nearth don\u00b4t even have food to put in their mouths or a blanket to cover \nthemselves on, let alone own some land. So life its not easy if you were \nborn in the streets without shelter and any food, lacking education (formal \nor non formal) and having nutritional deficiencies while you grow up, which \nwill condition you for the rest of your life, leaving your judgment \nimpaired because your brain did not develop properly. He never mentions \nthat some people dont have the cognitive tools to make a decision like he \nmakes, deep insights like his are not natural, they should be nurtured by \ngrowing in a healthy enviroment, like he said he had when he was growing up \n(away from dangers of the cities, addictions, stress, abnormal ideology of \nesthethics). Being poor in a city will condition your behaviour to a great \nextent, as far as where you can\u00b4t see that you don\u00b4t really need your job \nor your money, not because you dont want to, but because you never \nexperienced anything else. So, how can you go back to your country house if \nyou never had one and dont know what they are about? See, not everyone is \nhappy planting food and building houses, even if its as easy as he says. \nNow, im not saying that what he is doing is neither right or wrong: it \nseems to me that the life he leads is healthier than mosts. for him and the \nenviroment, but that doesn\u00b4t mean that everyone would be happy doing what \nhe does. Questioning everything, even something you think its cool like \nthis TEDtalk, its part of a healthy and curious mind, as well as an \nimportant part of the scientific method.\n As you said, laws are made by human, but their are made nonetheless, how \nand why its not for me to say, I dont think Im prepared to answer that \nquestion, but its probably rooted in the early begginings of ancient \nsettlements and agriculture. Is it bad? Is it good? I don\u00b4t know, its \nrelative, that is why in science they dont speak of bad or good. I myself \ndon\u00b4t think laws serve their purpose, but what Martin is saying its true: \nlife its not easy for everyone, if dont have a land: where you build your \nhouse? Where you plant your rice? I dont recall the part on the video where \nhe says he \u00b4\u00b4took\u00b4\u00b4 the land, its most probable he owns it. As a matter of \nfact, he admitted to sell his surpluss of veggies, which he planted in \nland....which he owned. Because today, owning its the only way of having \nland. Also I dont recall reading anything saying you cant take land. You \nprobably can, but then the state will come and ask for your papers, and \nkick you out if you don\u00b4t have them. Remember, its a 15 minute video on \nyoutube, do your best at questioning the shit out of it. ",

One could argue that we live longer, and to that I \nwould say, 'we toil away all of those extra hours and days'... Another \nargument could be that we have more technology, and are capable of \naccomplishing more, but I have to ask if that makes us happier as a society.\n\nThere have been studies done on depression. It is quite an epidemic in \nmodernized Western culture. Depression is, however, almost unheard of in \nthe native cultures that exist today. They are connected to their work, and \nthey are empowered in their own lives to live in a way that is suitable to \nthem. In our culture, the idea that we need more or that we aren't good \nenough is continually reinforced through the media, and through \nadvertising. Corporations profit off of your fears, anxiety, and \ndiscomfort, and they are quite effective at creating those conditions.\n\nI suppose the true point that I am trying to make is to ask, are we happy? \nI should take that a step further and ask, are we happier than we were \nbefore the industrial age? A very compelling case can be made to illustrate \nthe sad answer to these questions. The answer is a resounding 'no', and it \nis quite evident through statistical analysis, and mounds of anecdotal \nevidence.\n\nI am not saying that technology should be abandoned. Or that modern society \nshould be abandoned. I am saying that at this point in time, I think it is \npertinent that humanity change its mindset toward utilizing technology to \nincrease happiness. People have been mislead to believe that amassing \ncopious wealth will bring them happiness, however we are all very well \naware that this is not the case! So we should focus on what will, because \nthis rat race way of life should be left to rats. Sometimes I feel like a \nworker ant droning through the day. We shouldn't live like this.

Life can be hard and it would be \ndesirable to make things much less complicated. \n\nI would like a life like you describe \u2013 only working two months a year and \nhaving a much less complicated life. But before I follow your advice, I\u2019d \nlike to ask you a few questions.  Do those houses you built have running \nwater? I mean, can you take a hot shower in the morning?  How about indoor \nplumbing.  I\u2019d love to live an easy, uncomplicated life, but I\u2019d hate to \nhave to use an outhouse, plus you\u2019d probably have to spend a lot of time \nschlepping human waste to some kind of dumping ground \u2013 either that or keep \ndigging new holes to bury your poop. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to do that much \ndigging.  If you don\u2019t have running water, how do you wash your dishes or \nyour clothes? Do you have to go down to some river and wash them on a rock? \nI appreciate the fact that you only have one outfit, but you have to wash \nit sometimes, right? Otherwise you must smell like hell. If you don\u2019t have \nindoor plumbing, you have to get your water from somewhere? Do you have a \nwell or do you have to carry it from somewhere. Do you have electricity in \nyour houses? How about heat or air conditioning? Do you ever get to watch \ntelevision? If not, what is your form of entertainment in the evening? I \nthink I like what you said about getting sick \u2013 that is, you treat your \nsickness with water and earth. Plus it is a reminder that you\u2019ve done \nsomething wrong or unhealthy. But I have to wonder what happens when you \nhave an abscessed tooth, or your child wakes up with a painful ear \ninfection. What do you do then, just rub a little dirt on it? \n\nYes, I would like to make my life simpler and less complicated, but I\u2019m \nthinking that your suggestions would not make life easier. Indeed, it \nsounds like a lot of hard work that has to be done everyday to do the \nthings that are practically done automatically for people living in modern \ncivilization. I\u2019m sure that after a couple of months of living like a \nhermit, most people would gladly accept a few complications in their life \nin exchange for the modern amenities that we in the civilized world take \nfor granted. In fact, in reading your bio, I see that you, and I quote: \u201c \u2026 \ncontinually strives to find easier ways for people to fulfill their basic \nneeds.\u201d Continually striving sounds like the opposite of what you\u2019re \nsuggesting for the rest of us. \ufeff",

Progress on many fronts would come to a screeching \nhalt. We have gone from being less specific in our abilities to becoming \nmasters of abilities and disciplines. \n\nWhat I take away from this is to know yourself and know what you need, not \nwhat others tell you that you need. If you become more self dependent, then \nyour well being and happiness is not contingent on others as much. One \nthing that we have forgotten how to do thanks to a lot of things, but \nespecially in the western world, is to be well.\n\nI do not think that just because something is hard that it is not worth \ndoing. Accomplishing difficult things is the nature of our intellectual \nbeing. If we are constantly killing ourselves though, we cannot ensure we \nwill be available to conquer these ever important difficult things. \n\nWith all of the distractions of the modern world and the ability to fulfill \nnearly and desire when it rears it's head, it's becoming increasingly \ndifficult to know exactly who you are. We're constantly connected, making \nus more and more afraid of being alone, yet we are lonelier than ever. \nSomething has to change, and I'm not saying to throw the baby out with the \nbathwater, but instead to dig deep and think long and hard about what we \nneed, both as individuals and as a civilization, to push us forward on the \nright path.\n\nWe must work together to make the human race a well tuned machine of happy \nand well individuals. When you don't feel well, you seek ways to feel well. \nThe human race is no longer a bunch of groups of villages and families. \nIt's a complex organization of organisms, when we can realize this we will \nrocket ourselves through progress like nothing we can imagine. We need to \nrealize this soon. Otherwise, we are in trouble.",

(Video below)<br /><br />Part summary below:<br />- He moved to the big city and tried to follow success but found the harder he chased success the more complicated and harder life seemed to be.<br />- He thought back to when he was a kid. No one worked 8 hours a day all year round but they only worked for 2 months of the year, sow rice for the 1st month and harvest the rice the 2nd month. The rest of the time was free time.<br />- That&#39;s why they have so many festivals in Thailand! Free time.

I was going to post this a few days ago but \nreally wanted some quality time where I could do it. There are key \nfundamental principals here and I really hope people that come across it \ncan see them.\n\nThe way we are conditioned and hard wired I think is wrong. I think that \nmuch of our misery comes from having our minds set in a specific mold much \nlike 90%+ of the masses. We link our happiness to physical things but the \nresult is that you have to constantly chase things to fill that empty void. \nI think that our happiness and contentment is already within us. It's our \nthinking that needs to change in order to bring happiness and contentment. \nWe need to not complicate things so much. Like Jon said in the video, there \nare 4 things we need: Food, house, clothes and medicine (health). Pretty \nsimple. He also said that some people think he's crazy but he said that he \ncan not control what people think or do on the outside so he doesn't worry \nabout it, he can only control what he thinks, so he is happy anyway!\n\n+Visnja Zeljeznjak I love lamps too, I like the ambience they create.

My company \nowns the laptop and the smartphone I don't want to be without (luckily I \nco-own that company so it's not like anybody could take those two things \nfrom me). The rest, I only borrow and dispose of when it breaks.\n\nOk I do own one reading lamp. I like it because it lightens up my evenings \nand shines light on all the wonderful knowledge I want to acquire.\n\nI don't think it's that hard to live life as simple as Jandai describes. \nIt's easy, actually. There's cheap land all over the place (at least in \nCroatia). What is hard, is to untether from this existence we all live now, \nto make the decision to break away from it, to become a crazy weirdo \neveryone makes fun of (but everyone is secretly envious of).",

This is a great video \nand I also agree with the fellow in the video, my thinking is similar. \nThere are too many complexities and distractions in life that take people \naway from true happiness. Most of us are too busy working to realize that \nwe are missing out on the real valuable things in life.\n\nFor example along the lines of what Jon in the video said, he doesn't worry \ntoo much about fashion. I have friends that are always keeping up with the \nlatest fashion and even buying really expensive cloths like $500 pair of \njeans and things like that. Then they borrow big money to buy expensive \ncars. *But guess what? They never have any money and have to work all day \nevery day for this and even miss out on time with friends and loved \nones........for what? A pair of jeans that you could get for $50? A car you \ncould get at a reasonable price?*\n\nPeople need to think - Is what they do really worth it? And are they \nfollowing the right ideals and the right values?

At the same time, it is hard for people in general (and me) to contemplate - for me that is addressing the spiritual side to being human - because as he says the tv, media, etc tell us to be clever.
