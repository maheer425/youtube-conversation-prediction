You had to cross your arms across your chest like \na mummy, and cross your legs over each other. You were standing, and then \nafter a count down, the floor came away and you shot down. It was \ntranslucent, and I could see (before I myself went on it) people shooting \nround and getting out safely. A man twice my size and weight was fine, a \nchild half my size and weight was fine. Their shadows as they went round \nmimicked each other.\nThen I went. It was a head rush, then I got to about the top of the loop - \nand then, I felt myself sliding backwards. I was not going to be stuck in a \ntube while they tried to get me out after about half an hour so I freaked \nand stuck all my limbs out, wedging myself in the tube. I could lift my \nhead a little bit, and slowly began to crawl (feet first) across the loop \nuntil gravity was prepared to pull me back down. I wonder what people \nthought when they saw my shadow.\nAnyway, I got out, and the was another teenager, a boy this time (there was \na girl at the other end who assured me nothing had ever happened on this \nride, and that I was going to be fine) who sat on a chair. I went over to \nhim and said, I think there might be something wrong with the ride; I \nstarted to slide back down. He was only interested in whether or not I was \ninjured; since if I was, I could sue. \nI don't know what would happen if I had slid back down; whether the water \nwould reach over my head, or someone would see my shadow and say 'hey, \nthere's someone stuck in there!' but still, until these rides are managed \nby *adults* who can get someone out, I am not going near another again.\ufeff",

It looks \nlike the new one is near the top of the hill by the H2-Oh-No and the Surf \nHill. I'd say the only thing can still draw a bit of blood today now is the \nSurf Hill. You go down head first on the handled foam mats, and if you land \non the mat incorrectly, you can hit you chin or mouth on the handle pieces. \nI managed to cut the inside of my upper lip on it about two years ago.\n\nOh, and the walkway up to both rides on the top of the hill. I hope they \nrepaved it, but two years ago, it was still badly broken asphalt, and since \nyou can't wear your shoes up to any of the water rides, your feet would get \nall scratched and cut.\n\nThe Wave Pool is a lot safer now.\ufeff",

I went once, chickened out the second time(I \nwas 13 1/2), but random people cheered me on to go again, so I did, it was \na little bit more painful the second time because I back-flopped. when I \ngot out, there was this lady in her mid-20s who was cute, with a \nbelly-ring. she swinged, let go, and then belly-flopped. It sounded \npainful. when she emerged from the water, her face was pale white, then \nimmediately turn red like a tomato. she started to cry in pain. Her \nboyfriend, a Lifeguard, and I yelled OH SH*T! in unison as the three of us \ndived back in the water to help her up the latter, her belly started to \nbleed as the belly-ring was hanging off her belly. A medic came quickly as \nhe said, \"If she fell from a greater height, the ring could've ripped her \nbelly completely open, and as a result of that, her guts could've spilled \nout of her body.\" I said \"Holy crap Doc!\" you should close this Tarzan \nswing down for the evening.\" the lady Kissed me, her boyfriend, and the \nLifeguard for trying to help her. I walked back to the swing and explained \nwhat just happened to the other people watching. All the people who cheered \nfor me earlier cheered me on again. I felt like a f*cking Hero. and that \nhow I almost witnessed a death in Action Park, long, long before I knew it \nwas one of the most dangerous Amusement Parks. so yeah, I CAN'T WAIT TO GO \nBACK AND SAVE MORE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN NEED OF HELP!!!\ufeff",

And \nthere is a very good reason this design was not duplicated, there was a 99% \nchance of every rider exiting the loop with a concussion, and additional \ninjuries. I had the specs somewhere, but can't find them now. But I believe \nthe Cannonball loop had a 90 ft long 45\u00b0 drop into an 18 foot VERTICAL \nloop. Look at the video again at 2:56, and pause... this thing was huge. \nRiders had to be soaked with a hose at the top to be slippery enough to \nmake it through. And making it through meant you would be staggering like a \ndrunk with a smashing headache for the rest of the day, along with cuts, \nbruises and possible fractures. Not making it through likely resulted in an \nambulance ride.",
