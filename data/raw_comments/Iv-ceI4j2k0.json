I live \nin Palestine and go to one of the very few English-speaking schools in the \nWest Bank. I came across your books a few years ago, and since then have \nbeen spreading the word to my fellow Arabs. We now have a small community \nof your fans who proudly identify as nerdfighters.\nAs you know, we live under occupation, which seldom gives us any \nopportunity for economical, emotional, physical, educational, and mental \ngrowth. We are limited. We are denied basic human rights.\nDespite this, someone opened the first legit movie theater in Palestine \nless than a month ago. Just in time for TFiOS. I was ecstatic, and I loved \nthe movie (although I liked the book more and was pissed off that some \nlittle things were left out like the fact that we didn\u2019t hear Augustus\u2019 \nparents fighting with him, or the fact that Augustus and Hazel had their \ndate by a stream not a restaurant! .. although the restaurant was very \nbeautiful I must say).\nJohn, a lot of violence has been happening in this part of the world. \nInnocent children are being murdered, and no one is being held responsible. \nHundreds of Palestinians, young and old, are in Israeli prisons under \n\u201cadministrative detention\u201d. The Israeli soldiers came into my town just the \nother week and burst into a house and basically flipped it upside down and \nleft. Yesterday morning a 15 year old boy was taken by an Israeli settler \nand was beaten and burned to death. Yesterday night, a young girl was a \nvictim of an intended hit and run and is currently being hospitalized. \nThere is rumor of 3 Jewish boys being kidnapped and murdered by \nPalestinians in Hebron, but we haven\u2019t seen pictures of their identified \nbodies. All of the stories that I mentioned earlier can be backed up with \npictures all found on the internet.\nI know you are an advocate of helping people with cancer, but I was hoping \nyou could also be an advocate of social justice.\nI don\u2019t want you to feel burdened with all of this, but I was just \nwondering if you could make a vlog about this situation and mention \nPalestinians. If you could even do a little shout out to your Palestinian \nnerdfighters that would be amazing. We really love you John, and Hank too! \nThank you for sharing your talent with us.\nI guess I\u2019ll end with this: In a seemingly hopeless situation, they \nfashioned within their souls a creative optimism that strengthened them. \nTheir bottomless vitality transformed the darkness of frustration into the \nlight of hope.\nThat was from Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cStrength to Love\u201d which I\u2019m currently \nreading. And again John, thanks for being a little light of hope.\nI really hope I don\u2019t sound cheesy,\nFellow nerdfighter, \nRachel\n\nI commented that message in early July on one of your websites, and I guess \nyou don't check that website. When I saw this vlog, it reminded me of the \nmessage and I decided to find it and post it again. Hoping to hear from you \nthis time. \ufeff",

Sometimes you \nsay things I disagree with, and very rarely you say things that are pretty \nmuch not true, but unlike most other people in this world (including me \nmost of the time), when you're actually wrong, you admit it. I don't want \nto say that's \"amazing\" or \"great\" or \"incredible\" because it's makes it \nsound like you're superhuman when to me, you seem like a normal guy who \njust makes a really big effort to do good things, which is like the best \nthing you can do.  \ufeff",

I would love for you to have more time so that you can get \ninspired, work on new story ideas and get back to normal after the TFIOS \nextravaganza (although it might start all over again with the Paer Towns \nmovie).\nAnd yeah on the life crisis, I have to jump from university life into a \ngrown up job pretty soon, if I find one, because I'm about to graduate with \na literature degree and it is pretty scary, but a necessary step to take - \nso I feel you on that and won't stress you with the question what to do \nnow.\ufeff",

You said \nit yourself: \"A book is an imperfect thing written by an imperfect person\" \n(I really hope I'm quoting that correctly... my memory isn't wonderful, but \nthe point stands.) Of course every book will get critique, but I'd bet that \ninstinct people have to \"troll\" is because there's no way to improve when \nall someone gets is praise.\nAnd if that doesn't work, there's thousands if not millions of great \ncomments and reviews you could find out there.\ufeff",

I think that \"wants\" and \n\"feelings\" are simple impulses that are easy to determine and don't \nrepresent the reasoning potential of a human, whereas thinking through what \none should do, and what makes sense for one to do, is the true strength of \nhumans. It is why, I believe, humans are the dominant species on this \nplanet, but our strength is only present as long as we give more weight to \nour thoughts, and less to our impulses. Of course, I don't believe that we \nshould ignore impulses entirely; we're not machines, but I think that all \ndecisions besides the most basic day-to-day choices should be decided upon \nthrough thought and analysis of what affects the decision, and analysis of \nhow are impulses are affecting our own decision making.

This channel can \nbe defined as entertainment, but what a person desires out of entertainment \nobviously differs from person to person and this channel is unequivocally \nmeaningful, thought-provoking entertainment that can help ease our seeming \nplight of being human. The comments are literally doing that. So, yeah, \nstuff accomplished right there.\n\n2) What other people said: Please worry less!! I know you want to \naccomplish everything to the best of your ability and to the best of \nhumanity's benefit, but you also need to care for yourself and worrying \nabout things is not beneficial. Take the time you need to feel focused \nabout projects that make you the most energetic, and the least overwhelmed \n(And also obviously that are doing good things, but that's literally all of \nnerdfighteria's projects, so that won't be hard to find).\n\n3) Maybe you guys should discuss one of you taking a break, or at least, \ndeviating from the normal schedule to alleviate some of the aforementioned \nstress & worry. I personally would love to see other people on the channel, \nmore things of you guys just talking (unscripted), etc. Maybe during that \ntime, John could focus on his book, and being a Dad, and as Hank said \nsomewhereV, Vbros videos make him happy and energetic which is fabulous. \nEveryone wins.\n\n4) Another disclaimer: Anything you choose to do is trying to help other \npeople, so at this point, again, it's whatever makes you guys happy and \nleast stressed.\ufeff",

Besides the fascinating, informative, \nand entertaining videos I would like to note the difference in the \ncomments. When you read a comment's section on YouTube you often pull away \nfeeling like a waste of space and your faith in human severely damaged. \nPeople are always complaining, or accusing, or being vulgar for no sensible \nreason (if there is a sensible reason.) Even if the video is about being \naware of the problems in a culture there is still a negative aspect. But \nthen I look at vlogbrother comments and I see people who are supportive and \nI don't feel so awful anymore. To people who say \"YouTube comments are \noffensive. Get used to it\" we shouldn't be used to it. We have to hold \nourselves at higher standard. Once in a while we see a not-so-awesome-post. \nBut that's only once in a while.

Every \ntime I see you on the set of a movie, in front of a crowd of thousands, \ntalking to well-known people (even Bill Gates) it makes it harder to see \nyou as person. You become bigger than your viewers and detachment and \nresentment start to set in. If you never again mention that you're making a \nmovie, or selling books, or that people are asking your advice on being \nsuccessful that would be great. We could go back to thinking you're just \nanother dude with a camera.\n\nIf you want to maintain your individuality and stay connected with the \ncommunity you have to put the celebrity dampeners on full. There are forces \nout there who want to brand and sell you. Resist that or you and this \ncommunity will become a sold-out shell for someone else's profit.\n\nWe can do great things together.

It \nis understandable that there are simply so many opportunities to change \nthings that touch you so deeply that it is hard to say no. Also, doing only \none thing will probably not help you because people simply want to do the \nbest they can. But what makes you most happy? What makes you feel you? \nOfcourse, family and writing are important. By spending time with your \nfamily, people who accept you and keep you with both feet on the ground \nwill ensure that you have a good sense of who you are. Writing seems like \nbeing your main passion: by writing you can both strive for nerdfighter \ngoals, and creatively express yourself. Don't be to hard on yourself! My \nmain advise: go have a walk, go take a total break, for as long as you need \nto. Or go for a walk everyday, which gives you the time to think about \nlife, or just not think at all. You don't have to perform perfectly in this \nlife. What is perfect anyways. Yes, you can influence the lives of others a \nbit, please do so, but you are not responsible for all that is wrong.\n\nYou have probably guessed that this is what I tell myself when having \nexistencial questions, but I can tell you, they will fade away if you give \nyourself some rest, and your subconcience will help you with it. Also, you \nare not alone ;)\n\nLove,\nJessie\ufeff",

When \nyou think about it, if you spend every weekend with your family, and taking \nyour kids to hang out, then you'll find yourself cancelling everything that \ncomes in a weekend just so that you can the simple pleasure of making those \nyou love the most and yourself happy. It's all about moderation, doing the \nthings you should do, doing the things you love to do, and doing the things \nyou have to do. If you balance all three, you'll find yourself complete. \nBut that's coming from a 15 years old, I'm not really experienced so \nyeah...\ufeff",

What nerdfighters like or don't like is surely only a tiny \ningredient in the decision-making process.\n\nFor what it's worth, to me John's identity is \"YA novelist who posts really \ninteresting vlogs on youtube.\" All the rest is gravy.

In the summer, perhaps, John does a season of \nCrash Course and Hank does a season of Sci Show, and then we have an off \nseason, which could be without content or with a different host, or \nmultiple host, whatever works best. \n\nBut, like so many people have said, we want you to be rested and happy more \nthan anything else in the world. We love and support you so much. Thank you \nfor all that you do, but you don't need to do so much :)\ufeff",

Our poor friend probably feels guilty, \ntoo, for feeling overwhelmed by this because, as he said, these are good \nproblems to have. But they are still problems. I am biased, though. I worry \nabout Writer John more than any other John. ",

I am no luddite (I make my \nliving through YouTube videos, for gosh sakes), and I'm grateful that y'all \nhave been so open with us over the years, but I think there is much to be \nsaid for truly \"unplugging\" once in a while. I got this idea from Gwen \nBell's blogs on \"digital sabbaticals\" and also a TED Talk called \"Quarterly \nWeek off the Grid.\" Undertaking my own Internet-less periods or vacations \n(by literally giving my wife my phone and telling her to hide it from me \nfor X number of days) has helped keep me from burning out despite a fairly \nlarge workload. And as workloads go, I imagine that mine is only a fraction \nof yours.\n\nIf you guys even wanted to just take the occasional week away from \nVlogbrothers (either by not having a video, or by having guest hosts), I am \nabsolutely certain that we Nerdfighters would *not* respond with cries of \n\"Those Greens -- those lazy GREENS! -- remember when they used to be \nawesome?\"\n\nI understand and admire that y'all have followed the \"we only don't make \nvideos when sick or celebrating major holidays\" rules for so long. But it's \nworth noting that those rules were created at the very beginning of \nBrotherhood 2.0, when it was unimaginable that you would have to abide by \nthem for the next 7 years (and also when you guys had an easier time having \nprivate lives, and didn't have an \neducational/merchandise/charitable/conference enterprises to guide, and \netc. etc.).\n\nAnyway, tl;dr: I guess what I'm saying is that I love being a Nerdfighter \nwith y'all, and I want you guys to be happier, less exhausted people. Play \nwith Legos, veg out with the new Smash Bros., visit a beet farm for a week \n-- whatever. But take time that is truly for your selves and families. \nYou've given us all more time than we could have ever asked, and I think I \nspeak for many Nerdfighters when I say that we would love to return the \nfavor.\n\nYour pal,\nMike\ufeff",

I've struggled with depression for almost a decade, ended up \nfailing almost everything last year bc I just couldn't focus anymore, and \nam now on a study break so I can catch up & hopefully get into therapy (I'm \non antidepressants now too, which have worked almost unexpectedly well for \nme, but they're not perfect). I think one thing we have to realise is that \nit's ok to take time off. It's ok to be ill and focus on trying to get \nbetter before trying to finish your education - your degree won't mean much \nto you if you spend all those years suffering and hating life. If you \ngoogle \"online cognitive behavioural therapy\" you'll find a bunch of free \nresources that might help you cope until you can get professional help \n(I've just started looking into them myself, so I don't have anything I can \nquite recommend yet) - a lot of it is for pay, but there are some free \nresources as well - and 7cupsoftea.com seems like a good place if you need \nto talk to someone anonymously (it's another place that I've seen around, \nit's been recommended, but I haven't tried it out enough myself to really \nbe able to say one way or the other. But it's worth a shot, right?). I just \nneed you to know that you're not alone - far, FAR from it - and it WILL get \nbetter and we are here for you. It might be a bit finicky to get, but there \nIS help, and we CAN fix this. It might not feel like it right now, but it \nreally is worth the fight. I had completely forgotten what life could feel \nlike without a constant cloud of hopelessness tainting everything I did, to \nthe point where I'm still not sure who I even AM if I'm not depressed. But \nit's a good kind of confusion, like a whole world has opened up to me that \nI didn't even know existed. It's like, I'm not even actually well, I'm just \nless ill, but some days it feels like the world has gone from a grey scale \nto technicolour, when things are good. I lost the last seven years to \ndepression - a third of my life - and I know hope might not really feel \nlike an option anymore, but persevere. It really will get better, I promise.",

I know it \nmight feel like it and some people might see it as such but if that's what \nmakes you happy DO IT!! And keep at it because I guarantee those will be \nthe things that keep you going until you start to feel better.\nIf it still feels like a waste of time, use those activities as rewards for \ncompleting other tasks. For instance, I might use sewing as a reward for \ngetting the laundry sorted and getting a load going in the washer, or \nreading or writing as a reward for finishing a homework assignment. It's a \ngood way to give yourself motivation and set an achievable short term goal \nthat can help you start to power through.\nI would also recommend just going outside when it's sunny. Don't have to be \nactive or anything just go outside, get some air and some sunshine. If you \nhave it in you, take a walk around the block. Or do some yoga.\nAnd then just let yourself relax. Deep breathing helps. Depression is a \npainful, often stressful thing to live with. Suicidal thoughts and urges \neven more so. So just taking a breather can do wonders. Spend a day \npampering yourself with a bubble bath and spa things at home. Curl up with \nnetflix and your favorite cocoa or tea. Take time to focus on your \nwellbeing. The future doesn't wait but you have time to decide how you \nwanna take it on.\nI really hope at least one of these suggestions helps. <3",

It could also be a good way to continue \ndoing educationy things (a la Crash Course) by promoting critical thinking \nand reading of news sources and public events.\ufeff",

To be honest I've relegated certain things to 'do \nfor fun' status, and other stuff to 'this is what I want to spend my energy \non'. And in terms of writing a book, creative inspiration can't be forced, \nand you must never feel like you HAVE to write something. The frustrating \nthing with creativity is that you can sit there for hours and it won't \ncome, and then on the train or in a random conversation an idea will hit \nwhich you literally have to scribble down right there and then, and \nsuddenly it all starts coming together. \n\nI feel like I'm teaching you to suck eggs here, haha!

Because as someone who is \nattempting to write my first novel and a HUGE fan of your work, I'd love to \nknow some of your tips and secrets when it comes to writing so well. And I \nassume that many of the other Nerd fighters feel the same way. Thanks!",
