            "text": "A general energy drink deconstructed:\n\nA.  Water + Simple Carbohydrate's (Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup)\nThis will hit your stomach, and go into the intestines where is absorbed, \nand the sugar is rapidly processed into the blood stream with various \nratio's of glucose to fructose or no ratio, but typically with a higher \nFructose to Glucose   ratio. This means that the sugar can get into your \ncells extremely fast. The rapid dumping into the blood stream will   first \nshock the pancreas to spike insulin to deal with a bolus of glucose.  The \nfructose will directly enter cells without   any need for the presence of \ninsulin.  This effect results in a good energy source following the next \neffects. \n\nB.  Caffeine\nThis enters the blood and stimulates the release of Serotonin which then \ntriggers Dopamine which promotes a sense   of excitement, and mood \nenhancement.  The caffeine artificially stimulates the Adrenal glands to \nrelease Cortisol and   Epinephrine. This results in further blood sugar \nrelease into the blood, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, \npupil constriction, massive increases in ATP production, shutting off of \nparts of the gastrointestinal system, increased stomach acid production \n(Problematic for people who have GERD or Heartburn) and blood shunting to \nall vital organs including the brain, and most importantly the muscles. \nThis effect provides a person with the sense that   they are strong, ready \nto go, and could get a million things done.  For some people this effect is \nso strong, they may feel as if they could just keep going for days.  There \nis other stuff, but these are some of the main things. \n\nC.  B-Vitamins\nThis has numerous functions in the body including proper red blood cell \ndevelopment, and nerve function. Given that your muscles are dependent on \ngood nerve firing, B-Vitamins help with the excitability of the motor \nneurons.  Although it's questionable how effective they are given the dose, \nand time needed to really get any benefit out of it. So you could properly \nsay it's not that necessary in energy drinks. Niacin can also provide a \nflushing effect in some people but typically energy drinks use a form that \ndoes not cause this effect. \n\nD.  Herbs/Amino Acids:  (Ginseng, L- Arginine) \nDepending on what energy drink you get, some have various herbs or isolated \namino acids added which in theory help with the mental alertness, recovery, \nor energy boost. The problem is that credible research has not been done to \nshow that what they are adding actually is doing what they are saying it \ndoes. It has been found that numerous supplements that were put on the \nmarket in recent years did not even contain the primary ingredient they \nwere claiming to sell you.  So it should make you wonder if your even \ngetting anything at all. Furthermore, you have no idea of the quality, \nconcentration, or how long it can stay in the can before it's properties \nare even effective.  So this whole part of an energy drink seems more \ngimmicky if anything. It's not to say it can't work, but unlikely. \n\nThis is in summary the basic formulation to every energy drink alongside \nsome artificial flavors, other vitamins and perhaps some minerals. The \ningredients are dirt cheap, and the formulation is simple. This is why they \ncan market it so cheap. The star ingredients is simply caffeine and sugar. \n\n\n\nHow come I energy drinks don't work for me anymore? \n\nFor any person drinking an energy drink for the first time, your response \nshould follow a standard pattern.  At first you feel amazing, and with \ncontinued use they will become increasingly less effective.  The more you \ndrink them, the less they do for you each time around.\n\nThe problem is that Caffeine is mimicking a hormone called Adenosine. \n Adenosine binds to Adenosine receptor sites on motor neurons and other \nnerve cells which in turn tells the cells to slow down in excitability. \nThis is important because it helps you stay composed throughout the day, \nand helps you understand when it's time to go to bed.  Over the coarse of \nthe day, Adenosine production is increased like clock work and this makes \nyou more and more tired.  \n\nCaffeine hi-jacks these receptor sites and stops Adenosine from working. \n This then causes the nerve cells to become increasingly excited as if \nthere is no brakes to tell it to slow down.  This rapid firing then prompts \na stress like response which stimulates your adrenals to activate, \nprompting the entire response with your Adrenal Glands releasing \nCortisol+Epinephrine. \n\nWith caffeine blocking the Adensosine receptor sites, the body detects that \nAdenosine is not doing it's job, and increases it's production and release. \n This effect results in large amounts of Adenosine building up, and after \ncaffeine begins to break down, you are bombarded with Adenosine which \nrapidly slows down nerve firing.  This is partly why you have such a sudden \nCRASH and feel tired.  The rapid sugar high also has a hand in prompting a \ncrash FYI.\n\nOver time with frequent caffeine usage, the body will increase Adenosine \nreceptor sites, and by doing this it means that Adenosine can compete with \nCaffeine and bind, where previously it was unable to.  By doing this, it \nnegates the effects of caffeine and the effect of caffeine stops working. \n The only solution to get around this problem is to increase your intake of \ncaffeine.  \n\nThis is why you have people walking around that drink large amounts of \ncaffeine and it does nothing for them... this entire process has gone on, \nand their body no longer functions how it used to.  \n\nIf your one of those people that has never drank caffeine, and do not \nrespond to caffeine, then it's possible to say that your one of the small \nfew that may present features not typical in the structure of your brain or \nbody in general.  The possible answers to this will be for another day. \n This is already an ESSAY!  FUCK. Caffeine did it again. \ufeff",
