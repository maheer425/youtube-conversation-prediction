Pretty messed up huh?\nYeah I know, they might meant the \"beautiful\" as the inside, but if you \nreally want to complement someone's inside they you have better words like, \n\"strong, smart, clever, down-to-earth, brave, caring, inspiring, joyful, \nrespectful, powerful, succesful, unique, vivacious, etc\" \ufeff",

Pretty Helen \nGalsworthy was just 18 years old when she walked on to the tracks close to \nher home in Eastleigh, Hampshire. Suffering from depression and addicted to \ncocaine, she wanted to end her life. But she moved just as the train \napproached - taking off both legs below the knee.  Incredibly, Helen was \nconscious for just long enough to see her detached legs lying on the track. \nThankfully, a passing dog walker found her and she was rushed to hospital. \nNow, seven years later, 25-year-old Helen says she can finally talk about \nthe ordeal and coming to terms with being an amputee. And she is moving on \nwith her life after having a little boy, Thomas.\ufeff",
