And I agree that there are better books than \nLegend. But that is just my opinion and yours too. And it's not a rip off \nbecause everyone gets ideas from other work. There is stuffs in Legend that \nare similar in Legend to Divergent and other books. Divergent also has \nsimilar stuffs to Hunger Games and the Giver.But that doesn't make me not \nwant to read Divergent and that doesn't bother me.Legend also has a lot of \ninteresting characters the same way there is in Divergent. It is just a \nmatter of opinion on which is better.Just because Legend isn't as popular \nas Divergent or Hunger Games, that doesn't mean it's a wannabe. Everyone \nstarts from somewhere just like Divergent so id you could please just not \nhate a book series that you have no right to judge because you don't \nactually know what you're talking about, that would be awesome.

If \nyou're a reader who cares more about characters than plot, you might be \nunhappy with parts of the book. Yet, the rare point of view of TFIOS (that \nof a cancer-stricken teenager who's \"never been anything but terminal\"), \nher awareness that she isn't invincible, and her desire not to cause the \npeople around her further hardship due to her condition makes this one of \nthe most heart-wrenching, painfully joyous novels I've ever had the \npleasure of reading.\n\nI hope my brief review of John Green's *The Fault in our Stars* was helpful.",

That \nis what I wished you guys would highlight. Yes it is indeed a more mature \nread, I'm sixteen and I only got most, but not all, of the symbols John \nGreen put in the book, thus, I would not say it's a book for \"ages 12 and \nup\". I'm totally assuming John Green did this, but each character in the \nbook was designed a certain way, they all represented something, they were \nsymbols (not going to spoil anything) in which not everyone will understand \nunless they have experience. The book was way more than what you reflected \nit as. \n\nI am not disagreeing with anything, I'm just suggesting to give more \ninformation. Now, I'm not trying to put down this book review, I'm just \nwanting a more thoroughly analysed book review. Ask yourselves: Why would \nJohn Green write such a story, with such character and circumstances, with \nsuch storyline? What was he trying to say and teach? So, were you guys \ntruly doing a book review or more of a book recommendation?\ufeff",
