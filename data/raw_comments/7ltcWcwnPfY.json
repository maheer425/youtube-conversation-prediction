The cat talking \ncomes off as so convincing in this video, I almost could believe you could \nreally play it with a cat - if they could talk, that is :) also I think you \nreally nailed the personality of cats and dogs quite well in your videos! \nGreat job, and thank you for these videos, they're very entertaining!",
