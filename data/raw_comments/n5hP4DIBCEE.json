            "text": "Lol at your DNR tattoo.  In my state there is one form and one form only \nwhich is valid for a DNR.  It requires the signature of two physicians \nverifying that the applicant has a terminal condition.  If dispatch sends \nfire or EMS to your house and no one can produce the form, it is as if the \nform does not exist: you are getting CPR.  Also, your assertion that \"it's \nnot done right if ribs are not broken is also incorrect.  Perhaps your \nosteoporosis could result in breaks, but it is usually the cartilage which \nconnects the ribs to the sternum which dislocates and \"pops\" that people \ninterpret as a break.  A young person with flexible cartilage may not even \nexperience that.  For lay people (the target audience for this hands-only \napproach to CPR) there are laws to protect them, as mentioned above. But \nthanks for your unnecessary and misleading rant.  Who knew osteoporosis \nmade people that grumpy?",

You may freeze.  \nYou may have an extreme fear response.  You may shake.  You may feel sick.  \nYou may look around and hope to whatever gods may be that someone else in \nthe room will sweep in and know what to do to save the day.

After it got going I recognized the song. According to my \nWikipedia-YouTube research, that song is 44 years old. People that old are \nprobably the ones having the heart attack and can't stop to tell you how \nthe song goes. :)\n\nMy choice: Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" - 112bpm - which according to my \nWikipedia-YouTube research (see:not trustworthy at all) is within the \nacceptable range.\n\nFor anyone's sake, I hope I never have to give CPR. You may start sprinting \ntowards the white light.\n\nSo i started googling, and found other songs that are 100bpm that aren't \nhalf a century old. A quick few:\n\nRihanna - What's My Name (Feat. Drake) 100.00bpm\nAmy Winehouse -You Know I'm No Good 103bpm\nSystem of a Down - B.Y.O.B 102.98bpm (not the ultra fast part)\nMaroon 5 - Misery 102.99bpm\nLady GaGa - Starstruck (Featuring Space Cowboy & Flo Rida) 103.00bpm\ufeff",
