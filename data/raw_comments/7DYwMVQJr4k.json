Nature balances things out. When wolves \nmultiply by a lot, eventually they starve, because there is not enough food \nfor all.. and the balance prevails. Same for deer. Too much deer, wolves \nthrive and balance the amount of deer.

On average someone who swims in the ocean at least once a year \nwill be within 15 feet of a shark large enough to mutilate them. But it \ndoesn't. Why? Because they don't need to. They can find food and that's all \nthey need. Human beings don't need a majority of the bullshit they acquire. \nYet they do. Because they can. And the only thing that matters is them. \nDon't you think the bear cares more about itself than you?\n\n\nThe thing that is so fucked up about the extinction of thousands of species \nin the last 600 years is that it didn't need to happen. We would have \nsurvived and still thrived without the eradication of countless animals. \nSome of which are so fascinating and so rare that they live on only in \nmyth... when we could have seen and studied them in real life if we didn't \ndestroy their habitat and remorselessly hunt them down. Unlike some people, \nI can see all that nature has given us, and I think that by only paying it \nback with destruction is the same as biting the hand that feeds you. It's \nlow. It's more than low. Bite it enough and that hand will stop feeding you.\n\n\nHonestly I do sometimes wish a pack of rouge bears would come and eat \nentire towns so people could know what it feels like to be hunted down to \nthe last man.

If you think \nin it some way.*\n\nIts pretty much god damn idiotic, I mean, You can kill animals for meat, \nbut over killing is bad, you should produce them to have more babies, If \nthat one doesn't work then get another one to.\n\nWe are omnivores so we can eat vegetables and leaves.\n\nYou can't be a Carnivore, Or a Herbivore, Every Homo Sapien Is An Omnivore.\n\nThat's the way we evolved.\n\nAnyway, That's my speech, feel wimpy humans, for I am a Gingerbread Man.\ufeff",

Animals have just as much of a right to be here as we do, so why do \nwe need to kill them for our own purposes? Out of all the species in the \nworld, humans have the highest in population, and no it's not because we're \ntop of the food chain, or the \"Smartest\", it's because we're ruthless \nbastards that only care about ourselves, and not what going on with others, \nor other species. I think the human population really needs to decrease, \nonly then will everything be the way it should. The planet is way to over \npopulated by us, and we wonder why we have all these environmental issues? \nWe're morons.  \ufeff",

The same \ngoes for white tigers and many other mutations in other species, and even \nto an extent, specific breeds of cats and dogs.\n\nIf you're not aware, these pretty-looking color mutations only happen \nthrough selective breeding, and through selective breeding, bad things can \nhappen. Sometimes a mutation is SO rare that it has only happened in \nanimals that are siblings or close family to each other, so a brother and \nsister may be paired to mate, or mother and son, etc. Such disgusting \ninbreeding makes the mutation more likely to happen again, but it may also \ncreate an animal that is severely deformed or defected at birth, which may \ngive it a miserable life.\n\nThat is why people do not inbreed, aside from the morals that mark it as \nwrong. It thins out the gene pool, it makes you less diverse, weaker. A \ndiverse gene pool is a healthy gene pool. Unfortunately, this is also how \nmany purebred animals are birthed, such as chihuahuas, rottweilers, \nscottish fold cats and persians alike,\ufeff",

            "text": "+Dan A A large portion of all conflicts are resources and control. Politics \nplay a part of it but it's not the major player in it.\n\nPlease don't tell me that you believe what you're saying about companies. \nWho do you think is in control of the big corporations? There's a few \ncorporations in the world who control the smaller ones. Also that is not \nthe point I was trying to make. I was talking about the whole system of \n\"get up, go work, go home, sleep, repeat\". That's the big portion of ours \nlives in a nut shell. Well... The big majority of it anyway.\n\nWhat you tried to say about the hormones is entirely untrue. It's actually \nthe opposite. After cows started to get injected with hormones - their \nhealth got worse and the meat can cause countless health problems to those \nwho eat them longterm, but the cows produced a lot more milk so that's good \nfor business. It doesn't make them healthier in any way, shape or form, or \nyou... You really think that the ones who make those products think about \nthe quality of their products? That is really depressing... I'm sorry to \nbreak it to you, but there's only one thing people in that industry cares \nabout and you probably know what that is. If pushing toxic but cheaper \nproducts would be legal - they would do it. They don't give a shit about \nyou or anyone else who eats that meat. You should watch Documentary \"Food \nInc.\" it covers most of what I'm trying to say here and more.\n\nHow can you be so selfish? It's really hard for me to comprehend such \nscumbaggery... No one will stop you forcibly, but if it was made legal, I \nwould do more than stop you from hunting other animals.\n\nThat is the entire point. Money is what stops humanity from being something \nmore than mindless, fucking assholes like you. But I don't have time to get \ninto that discussion right now.\n\nYou need to wake up and smell the coffee, because I cringe at your utter \nmaterialism and selfishness. I really don't have anything else to say to \nyou, because I get worked up because of your ignorance.",

How can we support a \npopulation this size without finding ways to meat out of cows? That's why \nwe use steroids to make them bigger, and leaner. all the chemicals and \nhormones are for a better quality product so we don't starve to death. And \nuntil a way that comes across that is efficeint and ecomically sound, the \ncompanies will switch. \n\nYes, it does. We are on top, I can hunt animals, you don't like it? Too \nbad. You would have to forcibly stop me, which you can't. And threats and \ninsults don't work very well. \n\n\nIf you can provide a way that is economically sound, efficient and in the \nlong run saves the companies a lot of money, I think they will listen, and \nmight agree.

            "text": "+Dan A oh wow. Where do I even begin here.\n\nWe won't colonize other planets any time soon. We won't deplete entirely \nEarth's resources, because we will destroy each other before we can do \nthat. Look at the world right now. Worldwide conflicts brewing every day. \nWe are in a brink of world war 3 and you think that we will venture into \nspace some time tomorrow? Don't. Just don't.\n\nIt's sad that you think that without destroying your own planet you can \nonly wear \"leave pajamas\" and live in \"mud huts\". Your thinking is so \nsimplistic and one directional as it possibly can be. If instead of making \nproducts to control you - we made products to help our needs and the \nenvironment, everything would be infinitely times better. But it won't - \nbecause of people like you, who stay the way it is right now. We are \nevolving, but to what direction? People with higher power don't care about \nany of us or the world they live in. All they care about is how to control \nyou and me. You are saying things that they want you to say. Like we've got \nthe right to exploit our planet's resources and lives of other sentient \nbeings - humans or nonhumans. Electricity can easily be made with magnet \ngenerators. Everything has an alternative for the better of everyone, but \nbecause those things won't make a profit like the ones right now - no one \nwill do it. That is the point here.\n\nIn my opinion - we live in the dark ages. Just with a better technology. If \nyou think that technology alone shows how we are not in the dark - I feel \nvery sorry for you. Our ways of doing things have changed, but the purpose \nstayed the same and in most cases got even worse. For example - in \"the \ndark ages\" as you call it, our ancestors hunted to survive and to eat \nanother day, but in today's society - humans breed animals, inject them \nwith hormones that cause those animals enormous pain and suffering, \nseparate mothers from their cubs just so they wouldn't drink all the milk \nfrom their mother that was meant for them. Not only that, but keep them in \nmachines so their leg muscles couldn't form to produce more tender meat, \nthen slaughter them and keep doing it for the biggest profit. If this is \nthe direction we are evolving to, I want to part of it. No other animal in \nthis world will ever reach the level of cruelty of ours.\n\nLast time I checked, Benq, MSI and other companies don't cut any trees and \nit's not made of animal parts - so I doubt any animals had to be killed in \nthe process of making my computer. More so, how do you know what methods \nare used to make electricity in my city? There's different ways to run \ndifferent generators to generate energy. It brings me back to alternate \nmethods. Everything you state in your paragraphs can be made without \nharming environment, animals and humans. You just have to do some research \nabout them. No one uses those, because the ones that they use now brings \nmore profit. Everything around you is being run by greed of other people. \nPeople that don't want you to be free. Your whole life is about serving \nsomeone \"more important\" than you, but the fact is - no one is more \nimportant. Every person or living being deserves his way of freedom.\n\nSo the questions I want to ask is - Why can't we adapt our technology for \nthe better of everyone on the planet? Not just the people who are in charge \nor just people, but everything? Animals, plants and so on. We are so \nadvanced that we see ourselves better than animals, which by your opinion \ndoesn't care about anything else but themselves. So if we are more advanced \nand not like other animals - why focus solely on ourselves and see other \nbeings suffer just so you could have a more comfortable life? Didn't we \nreach a point now that we are beyond only survival? Does the selfish life \nof being On Top of The Food Chain fulfill you? Surely you say that Earth's \nresources are so vast and plentiful, so why not use it for something else \nmore than ourselves?",

And please do correct me if I'm mathematically or scientifically \nincorrect.\n\nOkay, so most of you pretty much hate the man race for doing such things to \nanimals. Some people might even go as far as to hope for the extinction of \nour own race. But I did some research and some math, and if there are \n100,000,000 different species on earth, and the extinction rate is \n0.01%/year, at least 10,000 species will go instinct each year. But keep in \nmind that scientifically, between 1.4 and 1.8 million species has been \ndiscovered. Now keep I'm mind that over 95% percent of the ocean is \nundiscovered, and the ocean makes up 70% of the earth. 80% of that 100% of \nspecies are still undiscovered. The fact that we still have not grasped \neven the most simplistic way of discovering half of those 80% of species, \nor half of that 95% of oceanic floor should make you think. The 1.4-1.8 \nmillion we have scientifically found, vs the 7.3-6.9 million species still \nyet to be discovered, making a total estimate of 8.7 million species in \ntotal, or maybe more since 70% or more of our earth is either undiscovered \nor unexplored. With this being said, estimating that the lowest would be \naround 100 million different species is true, then there are about 2 \nmillion species discovered/yet to be explored more in depth. . The the rate \nwould be about 200 - 2,000 extinctions each year. This is accounting for \nthe loss of our biodiversity, but there are too many variables to keep \ntrack of. As a pose to natural extinction rate which would be \n1,000-10,000'less that it is now. Though I hate to imagine how much \nbiodiversity we are losing while still maintaing the ecosystem services \nthat humanity depends upon. I wouldn't go as fat to hope we as a species \ndie, for there are a few out there who at least try to something instead of \nsitting watching this video and complain how 'humans are single handedly \ndestroying endangered animals'. The Convention on Biological Diversity \n(CBD) is actually trying to save them by starting the Biodiversity Action \nPlan (BAP) by identifying these animals and saving them.

You could say that we are the \n\"dominant\" species on the planet, like dinosaurs were millions of years \nago, and due to this, we a\nare proud.\n\nWe are proud of what we have achieved.We are proud of how far we have come. \nWe have increased our intelligence so that we can get a better life for \nourselves. To animals, this has been done to a limited state.\n\nWe should be proud of where we all live. We should be proud that we can \nview beautiful phenomena that occurs on our planet-phenomena that occurs \nno-where else. However we are wrecking this due to all of the pollution \nthat we are causing.\n\nWe should also be proud about the fact that we live alongside such \nbeautiful flora and fauna. If there was no poaching, then the earth would \nwork the same for us. Elephants are now growing without tusks to stop \npeople poaching them. We have removed some beauty from this plant. While we \nare not responsible for all the extinctions, we are the culprits for most \nof them.\n\nOverall. We need to be proud of this planet. We need to be proud of all the \nbreathtaking views, all of the wonderful phenomena, and all of the \nbeautiful plants and animals.\n\nBut it is obvious that we are not proud of them,because,if you were proud \nof something,wouldn't you take care of it?\ufeff",

Maybe not to the extinct on some \nbut hunting keeps population in check. And not really just for that \nspecies. We do take it over board though. I will admit that.\nHowever, for those saying the world would be better off of humans died. \nThat is false. Humanity is a large supporter of life. If our race dies out \nthen countless others will soon fall behind. Which leads to others. And a \nhuge chain reaction. Ecosystems suffer as well. The reason why is because, \nas I explained before, we keep populations in check. We are one of the main \npredators for some animals. If we die then they will reach their carrying \ncapacities and eventually hurt themselves. Then they will die and leave \nother animals without food and others will get out of control to. \nPlant life comes into affect when nothing is there to eat or maintain it. \nIt becomes overgrown and such, causing other plants not to get sunlight. \ufeff",

Food is food and money is food. \n\nThe world is messed up, but for only humans. At the end of the day, we, \nbeings of this planet, have to respond to Mother Nature in some way. Years \nago you would of told me something like this and I would of called you \ncrazy. The truth of the matter is; the planet is either going to die by an \nindeterminate natural cause or is going to be just fine long after the \nhumans, us, the plague is gone.\n\nNow, you may not realize it but, there is something ugly coming out for us. \nIf the theory of evolution is true and follow it's evolutionary course, \nsoon enough we are going to be the preys of some newborn predator or \npredators (and they don't have to be huge, they can be as little as \ninsects). And when that happens, no insect repellant will be strong enough, \nbecause we may think the world isn't changing but it is creating its own \ndefense mechanism. \n\nUs removing all those animals is our own doomed signature. We need those \nspecies to populate. Without the faun and the Flore something nasty is \ngoing to get to us.\ufeff",

For short, shut the fuck up and go back to \nschool and actually pay attention, you won't be sounding as retarded as you \nare now.\n\nI will continue this argument when you're actually able to put up one. Oh \nyeah btw, I would rather be a nerd and do something with my life instead of \nbeing a man who is homeless like you and having to live with their parents. \nIf I actually tried to argue with you, you will be embarrassed.  So I will \nbe ignoring your comments for now instead of arguing with someone who \nobviously dropped out at the age of 9.\n\nSo let me guess, your gonna say \"YES! I AM WIN ARAGUAMENT, BEAT THAT\" \nassuming you even got this far.",

Also \nshould the strawberry tiger really be on this list it is a color mutation \nnot a new subspecies. It serves no purpose in the wild and like white \ntigers, white lions, king cheetahs, stripeless tigers, and snow tigers they \nare horrible inbred and are only around for the entertainment of humans. If \nyou ever looked up the statistics on these inbred animals you would be \nhorrified just do a search for on the realities of white tigers most are \nborn horribly deformed the only way to get these tigers or lions is by \nbreeding babies back to their parents or breeding siblings. Deformed babies \nare put down as are normal colored siblings as they suffer the same defects \nas their odd colored siblings all white tigers are born cross eyed even if \nthey look normal they will still have defects you can't see. The golden or \nstrawberry tiger is the same way and the whole clay thing is not proven \nthey have only cropped up once in the wild and were  very isolated making \ninbreeding likely. They crop up in captivity in litters who's parents carry \nthe stripless and white tiger gene. If you breed two golden tigers you can \nget a mix of normal colored cubs, white cubs (probably stripless or very \nlittle stripping), and  golden tiger cubs like all inbred color mutation \nneonate mortality and deformities are likely. Whats more is that these \ntigers are not even pure bred they are a mix of Siberian and Bengal tigers \nmaking them useless for conservation if the severe deformities and \ninbreeding didn't already exclude them.\ufeff",

Animals \nhave ANIMALS to kill and eat, they don't need anything else, like clothing \nor houses, because they have fur, they have loads of food, and there not \nthat civilized to make anything else. So they wouldn't kill you, because \nthey wouldn't need to unless you did any harm to them. However, humans are \njust like \"FUCK IT I JUST WANT THIS RARE, ENDANGERED, ANIMAL SKIN FOR NO \nREASON AT ALL\" they could obviously live without it, but they get it \nanyways. Ever thought of the people out there with little food that hunt \nonly to use it, they make clothing from the skin, eat the meat, make \nweapons and tools out of bones, but US, the people with computers that see \nthis comment, just kill them, mabey eat like a third of the meat, then \nleave it there, to rot. The people out there that savor everything they \nhave, thank the heavens that they had a buffalo to kill, they can't just \nforget about it, they use EVERYTHING, as I said.

Sure, it's selfish not to give your food away, but where does \nit make us worse than animals? I don't see the big lion pride give food \naway to the poor starving loner because it's so sad. They don't give one \nshit about the loner. It have to fend for itself. That's just the natural \norder. A LOT of humans on the other side try to help poor and starving \npeople.

There have been *suggestions* that the tendency for \nthis coloration gradually developed in a small group of tigers living in an \narea of heavy clay concentration. The unusual colour would provide these \ntigers with extra camouflage. The theory remains unproven; however, \ninbreeding of a small isolated group of tigers could cause the recessive \ngolden tiger gene to emerge if at least one of those tigers carried the \nrecessive gene for the golden colour and bred with its own offspring.\"\n\nThat's all the clay theory is, is speculation.

Making it \nimpossible for anything to evolve, because that animal/person would die \nbefore 1 million years.\"\n\nDear god, I am facedesking so hard right now. It's not one single \nindividual animal that evolves, it's hundreds in a line of animals. \n\nLet me give you this as an example.\n\nThis is called natural selection:\nThere are two sets of bugs. One has a biological immunity to a certain type \nof poison that a farmer sprays, the other doesn't, this one is the control \ngroup. The farmer sprays the poison, and the control group dies, and the \nother goes on to mate with a group of females that weren't exposed to the \npoison. The immunity trait then gets passe don the children of that bug, \nand  a generation of poison immune bugs have just been made.\n\nThe idea of Natural Selection is often shortened to survival of the \nfittest. But Natural Selection actually states that those better adapted to \nthe environment will produce more offspring that will live, thus producing \nmore animals with the adaptations that allow them to survive. Whereas those \nwithout the adaptations will die off because they can not produce as much \noffspring.\n\nNow extrapolate this over millions of years, and you get the basis of \nEvolution.\n\nEvolution doesn't say we came from chimps, it says that chimps and Humans \nshare a common ancestor. A place in our history where we split and became \nthe original template for Humanity. However, we have yet to find that \nmissing link, the Father, or possibly even, Mother of Humanity. But that \ndoesn't mean it doesn't exist. As conditions for fossilization often don't \nexist. Or the fossil possibly didn't even survive up to this point.",

How can you actually prove it is that old? You \ncan't, unless we can time travel. Which is as of now impossible. All that \nhas been explained so far is only adaptation. Supposedly evolution takes \nmillions of years to take place. Making it impossible for anything to \nevolve, because that animal/person would die before 1 million years. If the \nenvironment changed from one moment to another, then all the animals would \ndie leaving this Earth barren. Unless evolution isn't true, then that would \nexplain a lot.",

The theory suggests that Humans, apes, monkeys \nand other primates share the same ancestor, and this is backed up through \ngenetic research.\nA lizard did not \"turn into a Tyrannosaurus Rex\". Evolution merely suggests \nthat reptiles developed earlier, and housed similar characteristics to \nthem. Dinosaurs in general are more attributed to birds based on the \ngenetic structure we've gathered, as well as bone structure, and the \ndiscovery that some dinosaur species house evidence of feathers and \nfeather-like appendages.\nAnother leaning towards the theory of Evolution is the eerily striking \nsimilarities between entirely species of animals when studying early formed \nfoetuses. I highly doubt a deity would go to the trouble to make an early \nHuman embryo look similar to one of a fish, right down to the evidence of a \ntail and gills!\nDon't laugh off Evolution as a fanciful delusion made up by Athiests. \nDarwin was a devout Christian who was trying to figure out how the world \nworked. And this isn't addressing the theory that he plagiarised the \ninformation from other Naturalists and his remark on how Aboriginals \n\"exhibit Human-like behaviour\".\nI probably got some information wrong, but I'm merely using memory based on \ninformation I've gathered over the years.

I'm sick of \npeople saying that human beings should not care about nature (because \nthey're belief should be everyone else's ) and I'm sick people saying \nhumans are evil (we make mistakes get over it) but most of all I'm sick of \nbeauty dying.

They're just like white tigers, who are in the same boat, and just as \ninbred.\n\nThe reason why they're rarely seen in the wild, is because due to their \ncoat coloring, they have problems hiding, and so can get spotted by prey \nand can't find any food. Most of them get abandoned by their mothers, \nthough,\n\nWhile tigers themselves are critiically endangered and should be met with \nconservation effort, Golden Tabbies, along with white ones, are ONLY bred \nfor profit, since they don't meet any conservation effort. I love your \nvideos, but that really needed correction, because the practice of \ninbreeding for profit is pretty cruel, and the species would be a lot \nbetter off if normal tigers were bred and returned to the wild.\ufeff",

It's not \nlike the vast majority of people today try to pollute, or destroy species \nand habitats, or disrupt ecosystems. It's pretty much what we were born \ninto. Our modern lifestyle is not currently sustainable without these \nconsequences. It's likely to get worse before it gets better with the \nexploding human population in undeveloped countries and their eventual \nspike in need for resources as more people afford to live a non-poverty \nstricken lifestyle. Heads up, if you're able to read this on your fancy \npants computer with electricity, you're probably part of these problems in \nsome way. Did you do it on purpose? I doubt it. At least we go to the \neffort of lessening our impact as time goes on, and make conservation \nefforts.

Yes, groups are both good and bad \ndepending on how you view things and the occurrences of events. Even in \ngroups or tribes, Humans ate each other. There are still some isolated \ntribes who still do Cannibalism. Just because we don't do it now doesn't \nmean we won't do it later on. In one scenario, having group is bad since \nthey are unable to provide the food and resources needed to survive if they \nwere Healthy enough. If you have a Healthy group then well, your able to \nsurvive. It depends on what happens. And being in a group is not the \"Only\" \nsurvival chance, it just means an \"Increased\"Survival rate. And by \n\"Outsiders\" do you refer to the Extinct species who did not live in groups? \nEven though those species didn't live in groups, they still managed to \nsurvive for maybe a few days to a thousand or more years. the conditions \nfor them to survive simply changed and the species could not adapt to the \nchange and therefore died out.

They also share food and don't really kill each other, \nUnless necessary, like a lion tried to kill them because he wanted to be \nleader or whatever and it's the only option, but usually they just back \ndown or walk away with a few scars if they get in a fight with they're own \npride.",

But \nthe ironic thing is our ancestors obviously ate each other. When you think \nabout eating a Human, most say, \"I won't do that\" but in a situation of \nsurvival and you are unable to get food right now and are starving and have \na baby or child or human with you. There will be a scuffle if both of you \nare utterly hungry and a \"Life and Death\" situation. In this Generations \nview of cannibalism we find it disgusting and inhumane although our \nancestors did it. Our species slowly adapted and formed what we call \n''Culture'' and \"Society\". From there we established rules as we slowly \nmoved away from our daily actions in the past to new things. It can be \nviewed as a psychological kind of thing but the instinct to eat one another \nis still there. This just my opinion from what I've learned.

            "text": "I do not defend poachers, and I don't defend those who exploit animals, but \nI do defend sport hunters and I defend a vast majority of the people \nenvironmentalists choose to strike at.\n\nPeople say there's no such thing as black and white, that there's gray in \nbetween.  In reality, a large group of people have forced many to believe \nin only a black and white, and that either the black or white must reign. \n In the case of many extremist environmentalists the black is the human \nrace, and the white is everyone else.  Ere go, the perfect world is where \nevery last human is dead and life lives on without us...which is incredibly \nself-destructive and in my opinion a crime against nature's laws itself \n(more on that later).\n\nPeople rail against hunters for hunting animals for sport.  A lot of people \ndon't know (or rather refuse to believe) that these same hunters are the \nreason why we have wildlife reserves and wildlife conservation in the first \nplace.  Hunters love their sport, primarily because it is a way of life and \na means to reconnect with our roots, where we didn't have massive farms \ndedicated to butchering cows for our Mcdonalds hamburgers, and we were \nforced to live off of the lay of the land.  Of course, naturally hunting \ncan't happen anymore when you're game is either gone or so rare it will be \ngone soon, so hunters solved this by giving back to nature what they take \naway.  Hunting seasons only occur when the level of prey like Elk or Deer \nis at a considerable level, and even then only certain genders are ever \ntargeted each year.  Once you do manage to bag and tag your buck or doe, it \nis considered against the law to waste your meat, so you essentially have \nto carry nearly the entire animal back with you for food, and the antlers \nand head are the sole reminder of your successful hunt.  It's not like in \nthe movies where people go about randomly killing rhinos and elephants and \nleaving them to die anymore.  Hunters really do care, and it's only the \nvery few (and very disliked and shunned by the greater hunting community) \nstupid ones who are ever caught on camera and added to the hype to get rid \nof them.\n\nNow I know what people are thinking; that this is a long bit of \nconversation written by a guy who probably either lives on a farm or in a \ncity and has only the internet to inform him on this.  Nope, I live in \nIdaho, which is almost hunting-controversy central.  We used to have native \nwolves that were hunted down by people who were careless and didn't think \nabout the consequences, thinking only about their businesses and the \nwell-being of their lifestyle.  Thanks to that purge of a vital predator, \nour entire ecosystem up north has been thrown into chaos, and it's only \nbeen recently that we've got new wolves back.  But these wolves are not the \nones we've wanted; these are Canadian wolves with absolutely no experience \nwith humans.  They are huge, they see us as food, and they are a problem. \n Sure, we got our ecosystem back up and running, but it is at the expense \nof much of our wellbeing, and there's a good chance that these wolves will \nmeet the same fate as the old Idaho wolf in the future.\n\nBy the way; the same people who authorized the killing of those wolves, \nthey're among the same people who now sponsor the supposed environmentalist \ngroups today, and who also brought in the Canadian Wolves up from the \nnorth.  They also authorized for vast amounts of salmon to be buried in the \nconstruction of the dams here in Hell's Canyon when the dams were being \nbuilt.  I know this because my grandfather worked on those dams, and was \namong the people who buried them himself.\n\nFood for thought, people.  The lesson; don't pick an extreme.  Do your \nresearch and benefit for the good of all, not just for the good of one side \nor the other.  We could all do with a bit of lesson learning in this day \nand age, that I promise you...",

Doesn't \n'killing many for the greater good of the few' sound like the morals \nof fictional villains like The Joker, Darth Vader etc.? Heck, Stalin and \nHitler had the same mentality. But some people try to justify it by saying \nthat 'humanity is superior'. I'm sure Hitler would have said the same thing \nabout the Nazis, and Stalin would have said the same about himself. \nLiterally, we're as bad as Hitler and Stalin, as we kill things just for \nour own enjoyment, as they are 'inferior'. It's so sad how Hitler is made \nout to be such a evil person, when in truth, everyone who's ok with animals \nbeing slaughtered by the millions just so we can have things like paper and \nwood is just as evil. Hitler was just a normal person, but believed in a \nsuperior race, instead of a superior species. Only those of us who believe \nanimals have as much right to life as us, are not evil and are better than \nHitler. Because tell me this: what gives us the right to wipe out thousands \nof species, but then when one shark kills 1 person, that shark is made out \nto be evil? The answer is nothing gives us the right. Until you can learn \nto live with animals in harmony, and not see them as a resource for us \nto use, you are evil.\ufeff",
