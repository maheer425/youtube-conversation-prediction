That's the GREATEST compliment you can recieve...even \nthough it's not ACTUALLY one per se.. more of a gesture (which to me) makes \nit even that much more special! I once took a little 4 yr old girl (being \ndischarged) out to her mother's car and before she got in, she threw open \nher arms for me to pick her up/hug her. She wanted me to come home with her \nand asked if she could come back to visit. Talk about tears!! It's a moment \nthat will FOREVER remain/define OUR work! ; )",
