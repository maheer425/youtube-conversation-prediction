Dry ice, however, is not as safe to the touch and I recommend \nnever holding it or even touching it. You can poke it, but it's a bit more \ndangerous. Also, when it sublimates, it turns into CO2 which is *not* safe. \nDo not inhale it directly or stay in a confined space with a lot of it. \nIt's not poisonous, but it displaces oxygen and will cause you to \nasphyxiate.",
