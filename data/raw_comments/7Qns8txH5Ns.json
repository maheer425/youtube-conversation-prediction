Or Harley, or Zaaz, or anyone else in that \ngroup who has proven to be a mass murderer, incorrigible, 10/10 will escape \nto kill again. \n\nThere's something to be said for the desire to rehabilitate rather than \npenalize, and I'm all for that, but not at the cost of innocents. The \nJoker's life, I believe, has great value, and if he could be convinced to \nchange his ways and submit to the law of the land, that would be \ngreat...but everyone knows he's never ever going to do that. And in waiting \nfor him to do that, Gotham is allowing him to kill more totally innocent \npeople. \n\nI value the lives of uncaring serial killers, but I care about the lives of \ninnocent civilians a heck of a lot more. \n\nTherefore, I strongly disagree with Batman's repeated refusal to kill the \nJoker, which I feel if he really valued the lives of innocents all that \nmuch, he would do. \ufeff",

Don't forget that \nJohn Stewart's black Green Lantern was the Green Lantern many kids \nincluding myself grew up with on TV.\n\nBut let's talk live action. Arrow introduced the well regarded character of \nJohn Diggle as Oliver Queen's partner. The Flash is set up to have a black \nWally West.\n\nThen film,\n\nPeople forgot that Blade the Vampire Hunter was a thing. And then there was \nWill Smith's utterly badass Hancock. We have the Native Hawaiian Jason \nMomoa set to play Aquaman, and African American Ray Fisher playing Cyborg.\n\nThough we still haven't gotten a South Asian superhero on TV or Movies. The \nbest we have is Wonder Black from The Wonderful 101 video game.\ufeff",

If I can circumvent the actual \nmessage of the video and speak on your criticism of Superman, I'd like to \nsay that it seems flawed based upon the assumption that both Batman and \nSuperman are simplified facsimiles of a collective \"us\". What Superman \nrepresents at his core, and has always represented is two things-- the \nchoice to do good, when you are so capable of doing bad, and the idea that \nyou are not less because you are different. Superman came onto the scene in \na world where many people, not just Nazis were obsessed with the idea of \nthe ideal \"Super man\". Then comes the story of this amazing person, the \nNazi \u00dcbermensch personified, who not only uses his powers to save the \ncommon man and help the oppressed, but is an immigrant to boot. \ufeff",

For example, recently, Marvel \nannounced Captain America is now going to be taken on by a black person and \nThor will be taken on by a woman and a new character is in part of the \nSpider-Man comics and she is a female Asian-American. The problem is, they \nwill keep on reverting back to the original after a period of time because \na lot of people can't accept the fact that the characters are changing; \nthey prefer the original characters as that is pretty much just human \nnature.\nThe comic books and movies *do* realise their problem and they *are* trying \nto change it, but if something's not popular (as in people can't get used \nto something, or the original is just loved too much) they will change it \nback.\ufeff",

I.e. he's an migrant both in \nbirth and by will- written originally by two Jewish authors after WWII, \ngrowing up on a planet that's both his own but also alienating, and the \neventual personal transition to metropolitan writer from rural background. \nWhile i can't say his comics are amazingly better written then batman, \noutside of his powers, he literally is the every man you were talking \nabout.

(And I know that I am oversimlifying and that that is \nexecatly what he is critizising ) But that's only partly true, only because \nwe can identify with Batman because we also do want the world to change in \na way that fits with our values and morals and are not able to do just \nthat, does not mean that we cannot deteste this (very human) behavior. \nBecause just as  pointed out we should know that in order to accomplish \nsomething we do need to work together and we should be aware (although we \nusually aren't) that our values are not the guidelines according to which \neverybody should act. Hank describes Batman as a personification of anger \nand frustration due to injustice and our inability to change things, but \nthis anger may sometimes be helpful and a motivator driving us to at least \ntry to change things but also sometimes clouds our judgement and then our \nhate may keep us from doing the \"right\" thing (which is of course also \ncompletely subjective, in this case regard the \"right\" thing as the thing \nthis person would do when forced to deal with the same situation but \nwithout beeing driven by anger, but by some more positive force ( this of \ncourse only applies if said person is not one of the people who just want \nto see the world burn or do not care about improving the world for anyone \nbut themselves)). We are able (if not suffering from antisocial personality \ndisorder or beeing blinded by ignorance) to understand other people, their \nvalues and motivaions (at least a bit) therefore we are able to make more \nrational decisions ( actual groups are even more effective) but when beeing \ndriven by anger and frustration these emotions replace our values and \ndestroy our ability to collaborate and thereby destroy our abilty to both \ndo the \"right\" thing and to do the more rational thing. Therefore it is \nperfectly fine to identify with Batman (especially due to his flaws) but at \nthe same time dislike these common flaws. Our ability to dislike our \nown charcter traits (or in this case the character traits we share with \nBatman) is the basis for our willingness ( and ability, depending on \nwheather you believe people can change or not) to change and therefore our \nability to improve and actually make the world better (which is by the \nway also one of the named things Batman supposedly stands for). So we might \nshould not hate Batman, because we are so similar that we are supposed to \nunderstand his Motivation, but we can dislike his behavior nevertheless \njust as we can dislike our own flaws.",

Their goals for governing the \nUK is only for the short term (until the next election) and while I'm not a \nfan of dictatorship, I think that reinstating the monarchy with their long \nterm goals for the UK could be cool. I mean the Queen is rad. Her grandsons \n(Will and Harry) do everything in their power to increase Awesome and \ndecrease Suck. Will flies an air ambulance and donated his salary to the \ncharity and Harry works to help wounded/debilitated servicemen.\nJust my thoughts. I agree that it's not binary and there is a happy middle \nground but the only thing that having politicians has given us recently is \nDuck Gate, and not a lot else as far as I can see. Oh, The Thick of It, Yes \nMinister and The New Statesman are also good things to come out of \npolitics...\ufeff",

We've watched this character forge alliances, friendships, and \nbonds to help him help others.  While there's this weird notion of him \n\"being a loner\", he was never alone.  In fact it was his relationships that \nforged him into what he is.\n\nAnd as for the \"issue\" of him being a white male, its not some default \nstatus, its the fact that this was a character created in the late 1930s. \nand the notion of things like \"diversity in the medium\" weren't a \nconsideration at all.  \ufeff",

Let's pretend every effort and dollar Batman \nspends battling super villains is, in Gotham's simplified reality, time \nwell spent. As you pose in your video. Batman puts an inhuman amount of \nrisk and of his personal life into solving the problems facing Gotham.\n\nNow, granted, he's a fictional character and can do things that are, well, \nunrealistic.\n\nBut even if you translate Batman's efforts in both risk, energy spent, time \ndevoted and money devoted to a realistic human scale in our reality, as \nagain you attempt to do in your video.. you are still not even close to \nBatman.\n\nDon't get me wrong, neither am I.\n\nBut Batman spends pretty much every waking moment battling crime, and \nbattling it directly at its inhuman heart, no matter the risk to himself, \nin the most sensible way to his reality. He doesn't placate evil, or put a \nband-aid over it. He punched it square in the jaw while it shoots poison \ngas at him. Again, in reality this is an ineffective way to battle crime, \nbut Batman's world is fictional and so is its crime, as you stated in his \ndefense.\n\nEverything about Batman's life revolves completely around battling crime, \nbut in the most humane and fair way possible. He doesn't use guns, he \ndoesn't kill. He lives up to his ideals 90% of the time even as they put \nhim at risk. He specifically battles evil with the intention to not become \nthat evil's replacement for a different team.\n\nEven Batman's public life is basically a charade to help his life as \nBatman. At this point, he's not Bruce Wayne posing as Batman to fight \ncrime. He's Batman posing as Bruce Wayne to get the bare minimal of food \nand sleep he needs to not die before he heads back to battling crime.\n\nHank as Batman, in our reality, wouldn't have time for conventions or nerd \nsongs or playing video games. You would be 100% your charity work and \neducation work about the world's problems. You wouldn't have time to tell \nus about neat scientific discoveries because you'd be busy only fixing the \nworld's problems.\n\nYou wouldn't be palling around with Bill Gates pretending sending water to \nEthiopia one time makes you a superhero in reality. You'd be there like, \n24/7 doing charity work.\n\nNow, I'm aware that, realistically you're not obligated to do this. And \nhonestly neither is Batman in his own universe.\n\nBut meeting obligations doesn't make you Batman. Going above and beyond \nthem doesn't make you Batman. Being Batman in our reality requires an \nalmost complete sacrifice of yourself to the pursuit of justice. No family, \nno fame, no you but doing good deeds. That's what being Batman would be.\n\nAnd probably none of us here, myself included are that.\ufeff",

After \nall, we cannot appreciate those who appear almighty, correct? Those with \nsome trauma behind their stories, i.e. going through depression or poverty \nor abuse or all of the above, garner more sympathy from the public and \nbecome hailed as standards for high status. It's almost shallow; it's a lot \nlike the simplification of human beings that John talks about so often. We \nprefer to see the pure greatness rather than the faults - and if we do see \nthe faults, they are \"in the stars\".\nPsychological: I don't know enough about the Batman story to know for sure, \nbut it sounds like he may take on something similar to Joseph Campbell's \nHero Myth. If you assume that his normal persona, Bruce Wayne, is the \nconscious while Batman is the unconscious . . . I mean, after all, he finds \nall of the bad guys in the night, when he is cloaked and masked. It is when \nhe struggles against them that he struggles with his own faults (or so I \ncan only assume - again, I don't know much about Batman, and this is mostly \nspeculation.)\nPhilosophical: again, certain values and ideals. He may also represent the \nvalues we want in ourselves, i.e. strength to prevail and the knowledge to \nknow that what we do is GOOD. It's not easy to know.\n...the only other thing I could add to this would be wish fulfillment . . . \nwanting to be heroes and therefore writing out the heroes ourselves. You \nmentioned something very similar to that, Hank, with the strong white male \nissue. Actually, you pretty much hit it on the head.\n\n. . . thoughts? Again, from a mythical standpoint, there's a lot of value \nto the Batman story, whether you hate him or love him.\ufeff",

Some might say I am taking this to close to the heart, but a fan \nhurts for the the things they love. When someone you respects trashes \nsomething you love your heart breaks a little. We can all get on board with \nhating he who shall not be named but to trash a hero who has been a hero \nfor 75years well its just a slap in the face. Hank thank you for \nacknowledging that Batman is more than what is seen on the surface.\ufeff",

He is a great character and I love that little guy.\n\nIn the long run, I do not think handing mantles over to minority characters \nis a problem (even if people throw fits). It is the logical and best way to \ndiversify your line up of heroes without having to go through the trials \nand tribulations of generating new heroic identities (which is almost \nalways a big miss (but when it hits, it is practically a home run)).\n\nWhat I think many people scoff at and take real offense to is the idea of \ntaking an established character, like Wally West, and making him black \n(even though the character has been white for decades). There is nothing \nfundamentally \"white\" about Wally West but it irks people that the official \nrepresentation of the character is now altered (perhaps irrevocably). I \nthink this differs from issues like making Sherlock Holmes Asian because, \noutside of the old novels, there is nothing \"official\" about Sherlock. That \n\"official-ness\" is really just code for \"only\". So the only interpretation \nof a character you will get is this new version (where as, since Sherlock \nis free to the world, any one can make a Sherlock story).\n\nThis is why I really like what Marvel did with Fury. In an alternate \nuniverse, he was black. The movies made the black version really popular. \nIn the main version of the Marvel Universe, Fury had a son who eventually \nrose up to become a prominent member of SHIELD, while at the same time the \nold (white) Fury is kept on the periphery and not given as central a role \nas his son. People who come into comics from the movies will see a black \nNick Fury. People who have followed comics for decades will see both Fury \nJr. and Fury Sr. It is an excellent compromise that satisfies almost \neveryone.\n\nHaving written that out, I now realize how much that resembles a passing of \na mantle.

A lot of other \ncharacters as well, including one that is basically intrinsic to Captain \nAmerica's character in the movies(And is getting her own series)? Are \nfemale. You say the movies underrepresent, but they really don't, and \nsaying they Do only serves to marginalize the parts that the non-white \nnon-male people play in these films, including Agent May, one of the most \nbadass non-white female characters in the Marvel universe, or Sif, a \ncharacter that may very well be getting a much bigger part coming soon, or \nRomanoff, a character that herself has a RIDICULOUS amount of backstory \nthat is being courted for her own film, etc. Also, it's really hard to say \nthat certain characters represent the default white man when they turn out \nto be not men at all, but aliens from another planet, and in many cases, \nnot white or black or whatever, but commonly Green or Blue, oddly enough. \nTo boil race down to skin color alone is a little bit racist, in a way, so \ncareful there. When we say White Male, we have to consider what that \nactually means. Do we mean White Males from the UK and the commonwealth? Or \nwhite males from America? Or White Males from Scandinavia? Poland? Russia? \nGermany? Italy? Because all of these countries have very, VERY different \ncultures, and to conflate them all as just \"White Males\" is itself a little \nbit problematic. \ufeff",

On \npretty much anyone who doesn't fit that stereotype. And even on those who \ndo, as they pretty much have a constant image of who they should be. Media \nhas a trickle down effect and a feedback loop relationship with our society \nwhich you cannot deny.\n\nAlso, don't you find all these perfect white rich dudes to be a bit boring? \nSeeing the same person with pretty much the same experiences over and over \nagain doesn't make for good media, irrelevant of the wider social \nconsequences.\n\nThat doesn't mean to say you can't love and enjoy these characters. Like, I \nagree with both John and Hank to a certain extent. But at the same time, I \nlove Batman regardless. He's a great character in that he actually has some \nflaws, he has cool gear and an awesome dramatic back story. And he goes \nagainst some great villains! But whilst I can enjoy Batman, I also can \nrecognise how shitty (and sometimes how great) the character is, especially \nin the context of our society and it's problems. Batman doesn't tackle \ninjustice, he tackles fictional injustice, glorified justice of beating up \nbank robbers who steal our hard earned money, and huge terrifying \nfairy-tale super villains who are fascinating in their own right. The \ninjustices of our time are not fought by Batman, the injustices of poverty, \nof institutional racism, of governmental discrimination, of corruption, of \nhuman rights abuse. And maybe that's because one person (even a \nbillionaire) can't tackle those things, however much he might try. Or maybe \nit's because batman is the same type of person as those behind the \nperpetuation of those injustices. Batman is great character, and one of the \nreasons why is because we can have these discussions and debates over him. \nBut remember! Critical doesn't always mean negative.\ufeff",

They \ndon't exist, so parents can't direct their kids to watch them.\n\nYou say that it's possible that some kids feel this way (wonder why the \nheroes don't look like them).

In other words, a black kid \nmight love Superman and his values, but still be bothered by the fact that \nno hero (at least in the past) was black. It can be demotivating. \"I want \nto be brave and all, but I see nobody that shows these values and also \nlooks like me...Does that mean that people who look like me cannot be like \nthat?!\" Kids sometimes think that way.",

Of course the \"changing the character!\" argument is pure \nracism. It implies that skin colour has any kind of bearing on \npersonality/story. It's like, if Bruce Wayne become a ginger or blonde in a \nfuture adaption of the story, would anyone give as MUCH of a shit if he \nwere black or first nations or a woman? Not even close.\n\nAnd I understand there HAVE been adaptions of comic books where well loved \ncharacters take on a different ethnicity. That's awesome. Would any movie \nexec at this point be brave enough to cast someone of a different ethnicity \nin a Blockbuster? Maybe. But they sure as shit haven't been brave enough \nyet.",

People who \ngain that power are unlikely to relinquish it.  These leads to stagnation, \nwhere the leader who had so many good ideas to begin with fails to keep up \nthe pace, and so ends up maintaining a new status quo (Look at Cuba.  many \nof the reforms of the communist government went a long way towards \ndeveloping the nation as a modern, industrialized center, but after a few \ndecades, the nation remains only revolutionary in 1960 terms).  It also \nmeans that the leader's efforts will be more and more invested in retaining \nthat power rather than reforming (Lenin's early organization of the Soviets \nwas seen by many socialists as a great step forward, but when the worker's \ncouncils started making decisions contrary to his own wishes, he used the \nparty to wrest all meaningful control from the soviets).  If a leader does \nleave power on their own, once they're gone, what's to keep their reforms \ngoing?  (Lazaro Cardenas, president of Mexico, made many reforms empowering \nlabor unions and organizing peasant self representation and land reform. \n However, he stepped down after his term was up, and the his successors \nused his union reforms to control the unions so they represented the state, \nnot the workers, and undid many of the agrarian reforms).  If power rests \nin one person, that person may not feel the effects of their own decisions, \nand so be unresponsive when policies don't work (Hugo Chavez and his \nsuccessor, Nicolas Maduro, doubtless had good intentions with their \ncurrency and price controls.  However they've proven disastrous \neconomically, but to change them would have clashed with their ideology, \nand so they remain).  \n\nPower should remain in the hands of the people, and they should put their \nfaith in ideas, not individuals.

If everyone were to simply strive do more \ngood than bad, we'd have a much more positive society as a whole I feel.\n\nAlso, about the misrepresenting. I personally do not care. I see nothing \nwrong with having predominantly white people. I would have a problem if it \nonly ever glorified white people. In America, they are a majority so I do \nnot mind them being represented as such. However, a complete exclusion or \nraces would not definitely piss me off. But when I see people wanting a \nfemale Thor for the sake of \"equality\" I have a problem. Thor is the Norse \nGod of thunder. HE is MALE. If you want a female heroine, then make a \nseries about Sif, she was already in the Marvel universe and has shown up a \nfew times. Problems with race come in for me when there is say a movie \nwhere the racial identity is important and it is not played by the correct \nrace. For instance, historically when actors would put on black make-up \netc, that would seem offensive to me. When elementary came out with a \nfemale asian Dr. Watson, to me it was very off-putting. It didn't feel like \nDr. Watson to me. If I saw a retelling of Mulan with all white actors, it \nwould definitely take away from the immersion for me. The discrepancy in \ndemographics for movies does not bother me, but when people purposefully \nchange/race gender for the sake of \"equality\" or it does not fit the story, \nit bothers me(the first much more so than the second)\n\nAlso, I've noticed that the majority of dystopian novels tend to have \nfemale leads, just a random note.\ufeff",

One could go down the list but I don't think it's \nnecessary, just consult your memory.  It's also false that every hero is a \nheterosexual white male.  Last and most importantly, it isn't true that if \na media production doesn't prominently feature people of color in their \ncast, or the struggle against sexism or heteronormativity in its narrative, \nthan this is a reflection of laziness on the part of the storyteller, or an \nabdication of social responsibility.  It is neither.\n\nIt isn't even as though other points of view are not represented by \nHollywood on either the big or small screen.  Some of the most popular \nfilms and TV shows showcase the alternative lifestyles and struggles of \npeople who are different from the norm, from \"Little People, Big World\" to \n\"Glee\", \"Gangland\" to \"Duck Dynasty\".\n\nFinally, if it is elites' responsibility to lead us rubes out of the \ndarkness and into the light, I wonder who's banner of progress we ought to \nbe marching under.  Differences in the nature and direction of social \nproblems and progress abound, and I'm sure there's as wide a difference \nbetween Bill and Melinda Gates' conception of the good and Charles and \nDavid Koch.

Like Dove is not doing their \"real beauty\" \ncampaign because they care about how women see themselves...altough I'm \nsure some of the people involved do. It happened because it's marketable \nright now, just like in the 70s. That's point number one.\nPoint number two is that's the biggest problem with capitalism when applied \nto things outside the strict, cold, hard, impersonal exchange of goods and \nservices. That it's a fantastic system for making money and for getting \nhigh quality products into the market in cases where quality is easily \nmeasurable. But in cases where either you can't really opt out of something \n(healthcare/schools) or where quality is subjective (art/media) it becomes \nproblematic and limiting. It forces people to think like corporations and \nonly getting money when it's not as advantageous.\nPoint umber three is it is a storyteller's responsibility to think about \nhow people see the world and ways to represent the average person. For \ninstance Spiderman is a hero all about people who are ignored and outcast \nor discriminated against so it would make sense to have something like a \nblack Peter Parker. You should be able to have a hero who's female in a \nstory and not have it be about her being female but about her being a \nperson. Every storyteller has the responsibility to say something that \nhasn't been said, to say something true, and to shape how people see \nthings. And for the most part movies have been using the same stuff over \nand over.\n\nBut that's mostly just my opinion.",

If we accept the \npremise that the media, entertainers, and other people in high places \nshould not just do their job well, but ought to practice some higher form \nof civic/social responsibility, the question then becomes \"of what sort?\", \nsince everyone has a different idea of what social progress means and how \nto bring it about.  This kind of hubris rubs me the wrong way in the same \nway all elitism does, where a self-annointed few claim the mantle of \nresponsibility in shaping the social structures the rest of us have to \noperate under, when nobody even asked them to... we just enjoy their \nproduct.

They owe society for allowing them access to the \nnation's land and resources. They owe their workers for shaping those \nresources into useful things. They owe their customers for paying for those \nresources. Even the basic idea that somebody has 'rights' or 'right to \nproperty' is something they owe society, because if society decided they \ndidn't have a right that property it'd be gone in an instant, and that's \npretty much precisely what happens when the state sues you or society \nallows a member to sue you.\n\nYes, if you direct or shape land and resource in a way that makes it worth \nmore, you should take a helping of that extra fat. But the idea that you \npounding the last nail into a project that is made of a million nails makes \nthat entire project yours and anybody that says otherwise can fuck off is, \nat best stupid and at worst dangerous for anybody but the guy that pounded \nthe last nail.\n\nBusinesses have a responsibility to society by both implicit legal \nagreements and subjective social contract agreements, and when it GROSSLY \nfails to live up to that agreement, you bet your ass that shit should be \nsnatched back up.\n\nBusiness didn't build the whole of reality and Earth to charge rent out of \nit. That the free market is given reigns by a lawfully appointed and \ndemocratically controlled state at all over the public good is subjective \non the idea that the free market can direct these goods in a profitable and \nmeaningful way for the betterment of the society (and its customers) as a \nwhole.\n\nAnd the day they forget it, as you seem to, and believe that they are \nbeholden to nothing more than their own feudal avarice as if God himself \ndirectly gave the world to them is exactly the day they should be *at best* \npolitely thrown out on their ass, and depending on the severity of their \ninability to with hold their end of the social contract (the one enforced \nby reality that basically states \"We won't kill you and suck the marrow \nfrom your bones for no other reason than the joy it brings my heart to do \nso, if you agree to similarly place nice with us in like turn\") probably \npunished or rehabilitated more forcefully.\n\nAs a member of almost every western nation, you, and every single other \ncitizen are legal owners of that nation. That's part of the \"government by \nthe people, for the people\" thing. You have a voice in its governance, and \nthat governance includes allocation of its resource. Yes, you don't have \nthe sole voice; you share it with every other citizen, not much differently \nthan any other organization or corporation.\n\nSo tell me, as a member of the effective corporation known as 'we the \npeople', if the only thing I'm beholden to is my own personal desires, why \nI should put up with businesses that feel like I'm their cattle? Because \nthe only reason you should is if you are.\n\nBecause they aren't magically any more entitled to shit than you are.\n\nReally this stupid ass rationalization is the core of why people continue \nto allow corporations and authoritative governments fuck them, because they \nfeel that the latter are entitled to the entire universe and they aren't. \nBest case scenario is you're fucking yourself.\n\nHonestly your own ideals don't even hold remote water legally anyways. You \nclaim back and forth that anybody with economic education would agree with \nyou while simultaneously showing you have or severely failed to comprehend \nany in both legal precedence or economic law.\n\nConsider the moment you open up a business to the public, you have to \nfollow laws like anti-discrimination law and the like specifically because \nbusiness operates at the pleasure of society and the customer, and not the \nother way around.\n\nAnd again, the moment you think otherwise is the moment you give up your \nown rights.\n\nAnd you might be in a hurry to surrender your and our rights together as \nfast as possible, but I sure as hell am not in a hurry to join you and I \nsuggest anybody with sense not follow you.",

But to summarize \nhere: pasta sauce used to only sell a single type - 'smooth'. Company A \nwants to beat company B so they ask a dude to make the perfect pasta sauce, \nDude realised that people are more or less split between chunky, smooth and \nspicy and tells the company to start making a variety of sauce, despite the \nfact that no customer ever said they even wanted chunky pasta sauce cause \nit *never existed* in the market before. Company makes lots of money. \nHuzzah! Business via diversifying products.\n\nIf you can't see how women are objectified in media and shamed when they \ntry to point it out (eg. the current flack a lot of women in the game and \ncomic industry are getting right now, just look up GamerGate) then I say \nyou're ignoring how the world works right now.

As there has not been a Wonder Woman (or comparable comic \ncharacter) movie of the same caliber, it is hard to actually proof or \ndisprove the claim that it would not get a similar level of surcess. Yet \nthat assumption is based on the idea that 'the market' - a highly undefined \nterm - would reject a female superhero, or at least not embrace her like \nher male counterparts. It doesn't matter whether this is true or not, \nthough - the idea itself is the sexist element.

You first say that Batman represents the anger and \nfrustration of all of us, in the sense that he serves as a personification \nof it.  That, I agree with.\n\nThe problem arises when you then use \"representation\" to mean \"how \nfrequently members of certain racial, ethnic, or gender groups are shown in \nmedia\", and don't clarify that you're using it to mean something different \nthan you did originally.  Because then you imply that (for example) it's \nimpossible or inappropriate for women or black people to identify with the \nfrustration or anger of Batman.  That's a bad idea, because a) it's false, \nb) it's widely-accepted (particularly in social justice circles), and c) it \npromotes exclusion and self-segregation.\n\nNow, to clarify; I definitely agree that we should be doing a better job of \nshowing ethnic and gender diversity in our media.  I just think if our \nreason for it is \"because people can't/won't/shouldn't relate to people of \na different gender/ethnicity\", we are promoting some *very* stupid ideas.\ufeff",

I feel that both different \nethnicity and socio-economic levels are represented evenly.  The only main \nline of thinking I see is that absolute power corrupts.  This is why large \ngovernment, military groups, and crime syndicates are always the ones whom \nthey are fighting against.  The biggest difference I'm seeing is in main \ncharacter personalities.  In the comics they may be been, like batman, \ndepressed and angry, but they led them to learn a higher sense of justice.  \nWith that they would defy all odds and risk all to do the right thing, \nsimply because it was right.  We see personal vendettas get in the way far \ntoo often in the movies in an attempt to humanize characters and make them \nmore relatable.  In my opinion, this kinda takes the super out of the \nhero.  This aspect is also what allowed normal citizens become, at least \nfor a moment, a hero.  It wasn't about the powers, it was about making the \nchoice and doing what is right.\n\nA side note:  A large problem with the movies now of days is that they are \nafraid to have evil people.  People who are just bad because they are bad.  \nHydra is trying to save the world.  Bane is equalizing justice and removing \ninequality even if he must constantly experience pain to do it or suffer to \nsave a child.  Loki is evil only because of bad choices and secrets made by \nhis father; the revelation of which broke his heart in addition to the pain \nhe felt of never being able to be king despite being a better candidate \nthen his pompous and immature brother.  In this sense, it's everyone's \nfault but his.  This concept separates common people from being better as \nwe've formed a line.  You can't have a large or powerful organization doing \ngood as it can become corrupt.  You can't step up as a senator or mayor \nbecause you become corrupt.  You can't fight evil because they have free \nwill and you stopping them or hurting them is evil.  You can't even always \nhelp out the hero because they break the law as vigilantes so they are bad \ntoo.  In the movies we create a subjective sense of what is right and \nwrong.  True, this exists in the real world, but why can we no longer \nsimply have an evil villain who is simply evil and the hero fighting \nagainst him simply because it's right?\n\nThe comics were never about representing a certain group of people or \ndemonizing others.  Comics were simple.  Good and evil.  Most super hero's \ncan't change the world.  Even if they could, they wouldn't.  (look up \nJustice Lords)  Evil was placed before them and did what they could to stop \nit.\ufeff",

We have our own peers \nand rivals and bizarre emotional or moral tangles to deal with. \nI felt I\u2019d really grasped the concept when I saw him as Everyman, or rather \nas the dreamself of Everyman. That \u201cS\u201d is the radiant emblem of divinity we \nreveal when we rip off our stuffy shirts, our social masks, our neuroses, \nour constructed selves, and become who we truly are. \nBatman is obviously much cooler, but that\u2019s because he\u2019s a very energetic \nand adolescent fantasy character: a handsome billionaire playboy in black \nleather with a butler at this beck and call, better cars and gadgetry than \nJames Bond, a horde of fetish femme fatales baying around his heels and no \nboss. That guy\u2019s Superman day and night. \nSuperman grew up baling hay on a farm. He goes to work, for a boss, in an \noffice. He pines after a hard\u2013working gal. Only when he tears off his shirt \ndoes that heroic, ideal inner self come to life. That\u2019s actually a much \nmore adult fantasy than the one Batman\u2019s peddling but it also makes \nSuperman a little harder to sell. He\u2019s much more of a working class \nsuperhero, which is why we ended the whole book with the image of a \nlaboring Superman. \nHe\u2019s Everyman operating on a sci\u2013fi Paul Bunyan scale. His worries and \nemotional problems are the same as ours\"\n -Grant Morrison, author of All-Star Superman\ufeff",

It would be foolish to deny the kind of \nlongitudinal insight into phenomena that could be derived from that \ninformation. What I am saying is that people and society change over time. \nJust because things don't match now, it doesn't mean it didn't mean \nsomething at the time (assuming that the research process itself was \nsound). So, discarding evidence because thats not how things are now isn't \na thing.  \n\nSecond, the conclusion is not final. It is still a hot topic in my field \n(criminology). I agree, and want to believe myself, that video games do not \nhave a negative effect. Research does tend to support that violent media \nand real world violence are not connected. We will see. It is difficult to \ncapture these concepts in a meaningful way through research, which is why \nso many similar studies need to be conducted for any given phenomena. \n\nThird, you have not taken the argument to its logical extreme. You have \ntaken it to be a statement about causality, which you then knock down in \nstrawman fashion. Their argument was a statement about correlation, not \ncausality. ",

The problem is that your assertions can e applied to all \nscience, and it has. The problem is that utility nothing is 100% accurate \nbut is usually tweaked to fit experience (ergo experiments and test) or is \ncompletely discarded for the fact that it no longer shows results that fit \nexperience.\n\nSo, the thing is that there is overwhelming evidence gathered that shows \nthat video games do not create violence in reality. Evidence gathered from \nmany different peer reviewed tests keep coming to the same conclusion. So i \nthink it is safe for me to stick to what i said.\n\nNow, like i said in my original comment, i am taking the original argument \nthat was made by Hank to its logical extreme but it is still sound. To me i \nfind it absurd that somehow, a first world country like the US that has a \ngovernment, society and laws that tend to point to the idea that sexisum \nand racism is wrong and then all forms of entertainment have some insidious \neffect that makes people sexist and racist? Problem is that these kind of \nproblems are at a all time low in all first world country.\n\nOpening my mind is one thing, but simply nodding my head up and down and \nand expect what im told without some evidence? No, i am sorry but that is \njust not who i am. I am a skeptic at heart, always have been and always \nwill be.

Scientific research into \nsocial issues revolves around the accumulation of evidence that suggests \nthat something is more likely to be true. Proof, however much it is spoken \nof in common language, only exists in math. \n\nI understand what you are saying about the media, but it is not the case \nthat the media has been discounted as an influence on individuals. On the \ncontrary, the notion that the media influences individual decision-making \nis widely accepted by social scientists. The degree of influence, however, \nis contested because there are so many influences converging on individuals \nat any given point in space and time.\n\nTo build on your example, if you take what I said above into consideration, \nthen it is hardly surprising that a causal link has not been found between \nviolent video game use and violent criminal acts. First, research into \nsocial issues focuses on the identification of correlations between \nphenomena. Second, only evidence, rather than proof, is accumulated. This \nmeans that no final conclusions can be made that would fully resolve a \ngiven issue. Third, all evidence is interpreted by the researcher, who has \ntheir own biases, which opens the possibility for mistaking it as \nsupporting something that it does not. So, violent media forms may or may \nnot still influence one or more factors that contribute to \nviolence. Complicated, right? \n\nThat's why we're here watching +vlogbrothers!
