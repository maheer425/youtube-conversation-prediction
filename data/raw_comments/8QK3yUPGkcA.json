Now when i brought this subject up with my mom, who is full korean she \ngot so angry and was like no, thats dangerous, your going to be infertile, \nits not natural, you could ruin your body. I think that because sexuality \nis such a sensitive subject in korea and that they dont really even have a \nmodernized sex ed program, they arent fully informed about everything, and \nalso its very traditional.
