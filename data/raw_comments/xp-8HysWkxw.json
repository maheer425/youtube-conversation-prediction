When you start to under stand science more and \nmore you start to understand the us humans, earth, your mother, father the \npeople you love, are only here by chance a 0.00X10000.01 chance of \nexisting. trillions of years of chance made us by combinations of atoms, \nelements and gases and everything in between some how mixed together and \nmade us.\n\nReligion can exist with science the way science explains the world around \nus could just be by products of magic and god like things, cause science IS \nmagic. We need to keep an open mind with all these things. Magic explains \nscience and science explains magic.\nIve always been a little...off put when people say god is a \"man in the \nsky\". God if such a thing is real, Is in space existing in a plane of \nexistence out side our own. a ghost realm you could call it.\nJust knowing there is no soul and you are just a strange by product of \ntrillions of years of elements mixing and your death is eternal is just \ndepressing.\n\nThe \"X\" in my post is not a \"multiply\" but a placeholder for a number \nrepresenting near infinity.\ufeff",

Reality and Logic \ncan turn impossible into real, it cannot reshape principles like God is all \nand all is God.The reason why that happens is because logic is based on \nmental condition and perception of a being and that differs from species to \nspecies and all those perceptions are defined by universal principles and \nthat is Alpha Reality. As for God appearance, he is is panentheistic being: \neverything is part of Him, the universe/nature and they are identical or in \na nutshell, are totally immanent in creation.

Although crossing the event horizon has enormous \neffect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally \ndetectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black \nbody, as it reflects no light.[3][4] Moreover, quantum field theory in \ncurved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with \nthe same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional \nto its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for \nblack holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.\n\ufeff",

Same basic thing without the \n2 impossibilitys under GR of the Event Horizion and Center Singularity .... \nThey have Apparant Horizions and the center can not become a singularity \nbecause it would take infinite time to create in GR.  Hence the Eternally \nCollapsing Object explanation where the center never actually forms and the \nHorizion is apparent rather than absolute.  The Eddington limit also keeps \nthe Singularity from being able to form .... The outward pressure of heat \nis an opposing force to gravity so it reaches equilibrium before the \nSingularity could form.  Added mass goes towards the center but never \nactually makes a center Singularity,  and as it grows takes longer than \nlonger for more mass to get towards the center for both reasons. \n\n The idea the center would be some tiny point or ring of zero volume is \nabsurd , at the least it would be an area where time became so slow that it \nwould be a cloud of very slowly moving energy (slowly to the center) moving \nslower and slower as it went to the center , slowing everything else behind \nit down as it went and being slowed by the Eddington effect never reaching \nzero.  The truth is the Black Hole model is really just very poor Math.\n\nThe Event Horizion Telescope should provide some observational evidence as \nto which Model is more correct in a few years or less. \ufeff",

Uhh..ok?\nWell like every single religious idiot before you, you have proven you are \nunable to argue the point using any actual facts so you bring up a bunch of \nlargely unrelated nonsense. \nYou understand that on a percentage basis that there are more non religious \n/non believers in the world than there is of any one religion right? Even \nthe worlds largest.Between 2005 and 2012 world religiosity decreased by 9 \npercentage points to boot so it IS going away. \n\nAnd even those other religions, only a few of them believe the same thing \nyou do. What if theyre right instead of your particular flavour? Hm?\nEven IF your assertion regarding \" most of the world\" was correct, ( but it \nisnt) it wouldnt mean anything.",

The lies and false prophecies, \nand also true ones, were only written and kept track of after the fact that \nevil became part of the earth in the form of man.  And much later on the \ndevil himself fell to earth and the world wars began because he wants to \nkill everyone and everything to be free of this planet.  (There may be \nothers like it?)  When god says so the first heaven and earth vanish \ninfinitely smaller forever taking this sea mingled with fires with it.  It \nis written in revelation that this p[lace is a great sea clear as glass \nmingled with fire with light shot through it as all galaxies have.  And \nwhen the Lord tells this place to vanish from his face it becomes a lake of \nfire instead of a vast sea mingled with it.  And there was no more sea... \n This is written in revelation.  SO you misunderstand the ways in which \nthis place is going to behave.  The thousand years is when satan is taken \nfrom earth and thrown into the bottomless pit or black hole.  And when he \nis released the knot is tied and then the whole place goes bye bye and \nNOTHING can hold it open and it will never stop getting smaller and hotter \nforever with no rest whatsoever.  Evil men and women will be judged and \nthose who upset god are to be given life, the tree of life instead of god's \nlife, so that they cannot die during the thousand years on earth where \npeople gnash their teeth and bite their tongues in pain.  No rest will be \nfound for them!  And it will be outer darkness in a knot in space time. \n For those who joined the first death and resurrection the second death \nwill have no power over.  But for the guilty it will be the lake of fire \nafter the thousand years have ended.  All these things are written in the \nbible in the end.  For someone to come and tell you this, I am the prophet \nand final prophet there will ever be, means that you should look for the \nsecond coming which came in ways you never expected them to.  I am not \nJesus but I know him very well and I know the truth very well.  NO ONE \nKNOWS THE DAY or HOUR that the angels come, one having the great sickle to \nbehead those who believed and stopped sinning g because of their faith and \nwere washed clean in the holy spirit which I now bring should you accept \nit.  You will feel horrible for the past things you have done and when it \nis time you will be forgiven and will never do these things again!  You \nwill be found dressed in fine white clothing and will be found innocent and \naccepted in the new heaven and earth.  There is a raising of the dead which \nis sort of like having amnesia from your past and no memories of such an \nevil place and will reign in heaven forever and never sleep and bliss comes \nin all sorts of shapes and sizes!  And this bliss grows and grows forever \nbecause god made the first heaven and earth to contain all sins and \nevilness so that they will never be again.  Imagine a yin yang being god \nbefore time was founded and god decided to rid himself of the darkness \nwithout using this darkness or else he would be guilty of condemnation \nhimself so he made things the way he did for the grand purpose of a new \nplace without evil or satan!  Jesus is the Lords only begotten son who \nSatan tried to murder before time was founded and so he became free of \nearth and this universe after he defeated sin and forgave sin so that he \nwas not guilty of sin by getting even.  The good Lord already won that \nbattle before it began!  And Adam and Eve were the first probably to come \nacross the tree of good and evil and ate it and sin, THE DEVILS POWERS, \nstarted being wound into space time leaving the devil more and more weak \nand without power so that later on the angel Michael could easily throw him \nto earth like lightning.  Jesus talked about the end days in the bible \nbefore crucifixion.  So the truth and the lies both exist in the bible \nbefore Christ.  Even the story of creation is misconstrued so that people \nwho see evolution and other types of things don't believe in god.  And the \ndays god took to create all things were not mentioned in man's measures of \ntime but the measure of the way god sees things.  So a day for us could be \nmillions of years.  God does exist and to see this now you see rapture \nalready occurring and it is mind blowing I know!  He told everyone in the \nrevelation I AM COMING SOON!  And he sure is!  In heaven the tree of life \nis given freely for the healing of the nations.  I see marijuana being \npieces of the tree of life but not the tree of life because god divided \nthat tree in every direction so men and women would not be able to get to \nthe tree of life and live forever by continually using it to be healed. \n And in heaven it is there for bliss and it is the clouds in heaven, \npossibly the smoke of her burning or vapors of her leaves and fruits?!  And \nbelow this post I see someone talk about other universes but before the new \nkingdom is created there is no such thing as outside of this universe!  A \nstraight line does NOT exist and if you could see far enough you may see \nthe back of yourself.  I don't know everything about the universe but I \ntell you that you cannot ever leave it once it begins closing and all the \nbottomless pits come together because god says so.

Or \n55,924,936,308 miles across.\nYes, the most amazing fact about Black Holes was left out again. The size \nof BH's is simple to calculate when adding them to each other, as their \nradius or diameter is proportional. So all I need to do to figure out the \nsize of any 2 colliding BH's is to just add the diameter of each to get the \ncombined size. AND that is the fucking most incredible piece of info I've \never come across in astrophysics.  Just calculate what that does to the \ndensity, it goes down 4 fold.\nProof: 2*2*2 = 8, add that to itself, 4*4*4 = 64: One would be expecting 16 \ncubic something but we get 64, a 4 fold decrease in density in something \nthat has no substances- lol.\nThe next calculation is to find the size of the BH that represents the \naverage density of the Universe... its been done and it is pretty much the \nsame.\n\nThe biggest Black Hole is the one we are living in!\ufeff",

            "text": "+Chad Gant You keep bringing up that science changes and referring to it as \na belief. This is so naive of you it's painful. So let me break it down for \nyou. Science has not changed. Science is a process by which you form a \nhypothesis and then gather data to prove or disprove your hypothesis. In \nwhich case, if successfully proven, your hypothesis becomes proven fact. \nAnd you bring up such childish examples such as the debate over Pluto. \nThere is a whole slew of reasons why it should or should not be labeled a \nplanet and it has nothing to do with actual science and everything to do \nwith preference for having a word describe things relatively neatly. Simply \nput 'Pluto aint big enough to be no damn planet.' \n\nNow. You also keep saying you aren't here to start trouble and everyone is \nfree to believe what they want, but then you keep throwing logical fallacy \nin a manner of insult at Science itself. \n\nEven stating something so false as to say that we have not observed or \nproven any evolution in man or other creatures, which is FALSE. Because we \nhave. Most of it is behavioral in animals and-... You know what. You like \nreading a book so much, research it yourself so YOU can turn around and \nclaim its all made up.\n\n\"His word has never changed.\" \"The Bible has never changed.\" Actually.. it \nhas.. more times than there are languages in the world. If I go to the \nchurch down the street, I'm going to get a different interpretation of the \nLetters to Corinth than I would get from the church downtown even though \nboth are labeled as Baptist. You say his word hasn't changed and yet you \nhave HOW many different denominations and all coming from the same book? \nFrom the old testament alone you have multiple faiths and interpretations, \neach fighting over one another because you have Judaism and Hasidic \nJudaism, and several other forms of a Judaism. But at least they only have \npretty much two main groups. Christianity however haves HUNDREDS. Even \nbreaking it down to the basic fundamentally different groups you still have \n7 different main denominations of Christianity. Hey! That's God's perfect \nnumber isn't it? Oh wait that's according to the numerology freaks that \nlove finding significance in numbers within the bible and think themselves \nscholars and mathematicians for doing so. Seriously though! Catholicism, \nProtestantism, Eastern orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, \nRestorationism and non-trinitarianism (technically this makes eight but \nthey're similar enough), and Church of the east. I'm also going to guess \nthat without reading about each and every single one of these you will have \nNO IDEA which one of these denominations your church falls under beyond \n\"Not catholicism.\" It is very VERY rare I find a 'Christian' that really \neven KNOWS the book they claim to love so much. so let me ask you thius, \ncan you really say that his word hasn't changed? If it hasn't been changed \nand all of the priests, scholars, etc are in perfect agreement with each \nother about the meaning behind the words in the bible, then how do you have \nso many denominations and disagreements about the meaning of ONE BOOK?! \n\nYour religion sways whichever way the wind blows around the man with the \nmost religious power and influence and politicians for centuries have used \nReligion, twisting its vague words as the means to their ends ever since \nand still do. Science changes according to discovery and advancement in \ntechnology and each new discovery and experimentation brings us further and \nfurther into our information and technological age. Which brings me to the \nfact you claim to believe in God over science and yet you have science to \nthank for that plastic thing your fingers keep bumping into to not make any \ntrouble on the youtubes and keep everyone lovin' jeebus. \n\nAnd for those of you who keep pointing out that Science cannot disprove \nGod, you're right, the concept of an omniscient being capable of \ncontrolling, changing and deciding everything if he so chooses cannot be \ndisproven. The very concept gives the believer a way out of any fact, \nexperiment or discovery and they can literally shoot down any argument they \npresent to them with \"Because God.\" It is the perfect unbeatable concept. I \ncan say \"Well we've proven the big bang theory,\" and a Christian can say \n\"Well God DID say let there be light and...so there was!\" Or I can say \n\"Well we've finally scoped and collected all the data ever on the entire \nuniverse and know everything about all the galaxies ever\" and they can say \n\"Awesome. God's clearly in Heaven which is not a part of this universe \nbecause that's how he designed it.\" So yeah... by the very design of the \nCONCEPT, God cannot be disproven. So stop feeling so proud when you say it \nlike it means something, it really means nothing more than the fact that \nthere's an entire book explaining a concept that has every way out of an \nargument ever in the simplest way possible as if it were created by a \nfive-year-old who was describing their newly made-up superhero. But I \ndigress. \n\nAnd this isn't to say I believe or don't believe in God or A God, I just \nthink how people present their supposed faith is moronic, illogical and \nconceptually misleading to the general public and that religion and morals \nhinder the progress of our race.\n\nQuite frankly I would love to meet a Christian one day, but I am now \ncertain it would require a little blue box and a custom-made screwdriver \nbecause my hypothesis is that a real christian has not walked this earth \nfor at least fifteen hundred years or so.

All scientific data is to \nbe revised at all times because our knowledge is not perfect. \n\nWe have only 5 senses according to physical science; the others can only be \nfelt, but are denied simply because we cannot prove them with scientific \ntheory.\n\nQuantum mechanics is currently delving into spirituality and esoteric \nsciences unconsciously, simply because of the fact that they're denying \nthat observation creates reality based on relative perception; which \ncompletely explains why things can exist and not exist at the same time.\n\nExistence itself is also an incomplete concept for many people. Plato \nhimself came up with the theory of forms, which pretty much explains that \neverything only exists as a form, as an idea in our mind, because all we \nsee is what we can give form.\n\nStop ridiculing spirituality and religion as if it's made to control the \nmasses. The Bible actually has some philosophically interesting things \nwhich people in the current age and time could learn VERY much from.\nAll religions have things in common which include the creation story.\n\nDon't generalize an entire people just because you have to deal with people \nwho misrepresent their religion, because religion isn't created by the \npeople who portray it.\n\nScience is more of a religion than any general belief, because it all \nhappens according to laws and facts; which is the thing science-lovers so \nvigorously hate and despise about religion, while conforming to their own \nstrict rules of conflict and their so called 'rationality'. If any of you \n'scientists' are so rational then stop DENYING religion and DENYING our \nbeliefs, playing the burden of proof card simply because you think fully \ninvestigating it isn't worth it.\n\nIf you're true to scientific theory and pursue obliteration of religion and \nyou think it's nonsense; \n\nwhy don't you test it in the way the spiritual people test it? Open minded, \nfeel things, ask how they do it instead of saying\n\"I SHOULD FEEL IT ALREADY BUT I DONT SO ITS NOT TRUE\"\n\nYou're all so hypocritical and cynical. \nStop calling people dumb while ridiculing them yourself, maturity comes \nwith rationality and laughing at people for what they believe in is plain \nrude and childish/immature.\n\nIf you want an actual discussion where religion coincides with science go \nstudy philosophy, you'll become way more open minded. People can fucking \nmove clouds with their minds, there are videos and all you do is try to \nprove them wrong instead of trying it for yourself.\n\nHOW FAR HAVE YOU STRAYED FROM NATURE, MY FRIENDS.",

For \nthat, it needs to loose it's orbital velocity, so something must slow it \ndown.\nI don't *think* that is something that happens.\n\nEarth started out as a few rocks, but eventually got hit by so many other \nrocks that it grew really big, until the solar system calmed down and \nbecame less chaotic with less free rocks flying around. Nowadays we rarely \nget hit by asteroids, and earth isn't really growing anymore.\nIn the same way, black holes start as a giant star collapses, and then \nsucks a lot of stuff in until the only stuff that's left are the things \nthat are in stable orbit around it, and then it won't grow any more.\n\nI'm just speculating, I haven't studied this specific question.

As far as I understand it bends the space to the direction \nit travels, Sun heads with its speed it bends the space which our planet \nfollows that orbit. Travelling direction of star where the space bended, \nthat is why our planet does not fall in to the sun. They say dying star \ncollapse towards inside that creates. I think not the collapse of the dying \nstar creates black hole, collapse of the star may trigger explosion so \npowerful it pushes the remaining mass at it's travelling direction so fast \nit breaks the light speed limit, no particle in space can reach the \nremaining mass of that star, space thorn apart, creates extra dimensional \nvacuum. Light can not comes out of black hole because it is faster than \nlight speed. Nothing goes faster than speed of light, maybe true, if \nsomething goes faster than speed of light it will create black hole. This \nalso put time travelling beyond anyone's reach; you may stop the time but \ncan not reverse it back if you go faster than speed of light that will \ncreate black hole to unknown.\ufeff",

In \nother words, this \"curving\" of spacetime is literally gravity. A black hole \nforms simply because there is too much stuff in a given region of space. \nFor instance, if you could compress the Earth down to the size of a peanut, \nit would collapse into a black hole, since the given mass is in an area \nhat's smaller than said the mass's Schwarzschild radius (any mass that's \nsmaller than its Schwarzschild radius becomes a black hole).

All \"evidence\" \nI've seen is garbage that has more holes in it than swiss cheese.\n\nEVERY single push of the Big Bang Theory seeks to supplant Creationism. \nEvery person I've ever encountered who fervently pushes evolution insists \nthat God didn't create the universe which means that they believe that it \nbegan by itself from that single point.\n\nFYI, this is the level that the average man pushes the subject from. If you \nlearned something more, than I can guarantee it isn't what is on the \nfrontline of the debate because the frontline is populated, traditionally, \nby the average man and the version I've heard is guaranteed to be the party \nline that the masses groove to. A document I encountered stated that the \nway of a politician is to 'understand the irascibility of the mindless \nmob'. So, I promise you that the 'mindless mob' is the heartbeat that runs \nthis nation's increasingly liberal foolishness AND the layman's version of \nEvolution. \n\nI have provided evidence of God's existence but maybe you can't see it for \nwhat it is, so I'll break it down: There are ONLY two prevailing arguments \nregarding cosmic origin. There is the belief that everything was made by \nGod, or a god depending on your belief system. And there is the belief that \nthere is no such thing as gods of any kind and that everything came about \non its own. Atheists don't believe in the existence of God in any form so \nyou're pushing the belief that the universe came about on its own by \ndefault. If that isn't what you're saying then what the hell are you saying?\n\nLogically, there are only two sides in this debate: Origin by divine \ncreation or by evolution. There is no third option, unless you want to \nargue that the universe only exists because we are here perceiving it to \nexist which is just ridiculous. As such, to disprove one is to support the \nother.\n\nAll my evidence comes STRAIGHT from what I was taught in school or what \nso-called \"Experts\" have stated. The rest is logical inference based on \nwhat I took in and considered. Besides, information is free to absorb and \nexpand on as it seems necessary. There is no point in paying $50K to go to \ncollege just to learn what some professor has learned from their professor \nwho learned it from their professor who learned it from their professor all \nthe way back to when such an idea I would be learning about was originally \nthought up and verified, all the while without being expanded upon in any \ngrand detail. Why should I pay $50K just to learn what amounts to written \nhearsay and earn a professionally bedazzled piece of paper that tells all \nwho see it that I know enough to parrot what I was taught?\n\nYou say \"Expert\" and that is what the word means to me given modern social \nfoolishness and assumations: A person who is validated by a stupid piece of \npaper that certifies that they know what those that taught them know. If \nthey were taught by someone who knows little to nothing correct on a \nsubject and they pass, they are an expert but they still know next to \nnothing on the subject.\n\nKeep your Bachelors of Science degree. It means nothing more than \"you know \nwhat they knew\" and it carries more weight professionally being a \nBachelor's degree but that doesn't mean that you're any more knowledgeable \nthan they were or that they knew what they were talking about, only that \nthey knew what those before them talked about. It also means that you paid \nmoney for what you know which, sadly, is more important than being \nknowledgeable these days. *That's what a degree means to me.*",

            "text": "+Monochromicornicopia Response is lengthy, but a lot is spacing to aid in \nfollowing so bare with me because it isn't fair to just expect you to put \nthe pieces together without explanation.\n\n\"You seem to think it is the atheists responsibility to disprove god. It \nisn't.\"\n\nAnd this argument again. You aren't the first to say that but at least you \naren't outright claiming that Evolution is correct by default and that it \nis the theist's job to disprove it. That is an improvement at least.\n\nI have tried to give ample evidence to the existence of God and most \natheists simply refuse to accept it and say that it doesn't make sense. \nBut, in the hopes that you will consider it, I'll restate:\n\n1) I've already pointed out the basic error in mathematics as opposed to \nwhat Evolution insists is true and why the numbers don't add up as it were.\n\n2) *Conservation of Matter* states that matter can't be created or \ndestroyed, only transformed. No matter how you spin it, the Big Bang Theory \n(BBT) insists that matter and energy came from nothing. Either dimensional \nplanes touched and generated the energy necessary for it (pretty \nfar-fetched considering the massive transfer of energy that would have \nrequired and the sheer coincidence of everything turning out THIS way) or \nall the matter in the universe was compacted into a singularity sized space \n(in which case the matter still wasn't really created but left over from a \nprevious form and had to come from somewhere else).\n\nThe first one notes a problem that was demonstrated in a graphic depicting \nan open dryer with all the clothes inside neatly folded and stacked. It \nstated: According to the law of averages, that should happen at least once. \nEver since the first dryer was made and put to use and after millions upon \nmillions of drying cycles, have you ever heard of that happening naturally \nor even coming closer than one jumbled mess?\n\nThe second one denotes a problem based on the rules of Time which states \nthat EVERYTHING bound by it needs to have its beginning and come from \nsomewhere. The BBT insists that there was nothing before the event \nmentioned. One atheist stated that the plane before the universe's \nexistence may have been capable of producing such an outcome but that is \njust conjecture and can't be proven.\n     *P.S.* I have been stuck on the notion of how God can exist without a \nbeginning as we know it. I have come to accept that, as the creator of \nTime, he isn't bound by it. Imagine if a clock became sentient and how we \nwould look to it given the rules on which its operation is bound: It would \nsee us and insist we are broken or illusions because it couldn't comprehend \nour existence.\n\n3) *This is thanks to Neil deGrasse Tyson regarding his statement on the \ntruth behind E=MC^2.* The equation's principle states that matter and \nenergy are interchangeable. If you turn energy into matter, you get matter \nAND anti-matter. You will not get one without the other as however many \nexperiments have shown. However, for every particle of matter in the \nuniverse, there is an instance where matter was made *WITHOUT* anti-matter \nbecause it still exists today. According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, the \nuniverse would have cooled billions of years ago and all matter would have \ncancelled with anti-matter leaving nothing but energy in the universe if \nE=MC^2 was absolute. If that weren't enough, scientists are baffled because \nthey *CANNOT* make matter without anti-matter and they can't understand why.\n\nThere is also the Schrodinger's Cat paradox but I can't accept it and won't \ninclude it in the list of undeniable reasons on principle. If I can't \naccept it, I have no right to expect you to and I believe that using it in \nsuch a way is an insult to the God I believe in. Those are my three \nreasons. As I have stated I will keep looking for more because three just \nisn't enough when there have to be clues everywhere to find. It doesn't \nfeel right to just assume that I've found the only three pieces of \nevidence. Three is enough scientifically to support a theory as a fact but \nthere just has to be more to find.",

When \nthe gothered energy reaches the limit, the black hole sends it back to \nspace. Considering that a black hole alone, which is only an invisible dot \nin the vastness of space, can't keep endless amouts of energy, makes me \nthink that the big bang is an imposible theory, because all the energy of \nthe universe cannot be contained in a bubble the size of a pinhead. The \nenergy jets of the black holes, tell us that there's a limit in with \nholding energy. So, science better come up with another theory of how the \nuniverse was made. \ufeff",

But now, in the universe far beyond our galaxy, \nthere's evidence of something far more ominous. A breed of black holes that \nhas reached incomprehensible size and destructive power. Just how large, \nand violent, and strange can they get?\n\nA new era in astronomy has revealed a universe long hidden to us. High-tech \ninstruments sent into space have been tuned to sense high-energy forms of \nlight -- x-rays and gamma rays -- that are invisible to our eyes and do not \npenetrate our atmosphere. On the ground, precision telescopes are equipped \nwith technologies that allow them to cancel out the blurring effects of the \natmosphere. They are peering into the far reaches of the universe, and into \ndistant caldrons of light and energy. In some distant galaxies, astronomers \nare now finding evidence that space and time are being shattered by \neruptions so vast they boggle the mind.\n\nWe are just beginning to understand the impact these outbursts have had on \nthe universe: On the shapes of galaxies, the spread of elements that make \nup stars and planets, and ultimately the very existence of Earth. The \ndiscovery of what causes these eruptions has led to a new understanding of \ncosmic history. Back in 1995, the Hubble space telescope was enlisted to \nbegin filling in the details of that history. Astronomers selected tiny \nregions in the sky, between the stars. For days at a time, they focused \nHubble's gaze on remote regions of the universe. \n\nThese hubble Deep Field images offered incredibly clear views of the cosmos \nin its infancy. What drew astronomers' attention were the tiniest galaxies, \ncovering only a few pixels on Hubble's detector. Most of them do not have \nthe grand spiral or elliptical shapes of large galaxies we see close to us \ntoday. \n\nInstead, they are irregular, scrappy collections of stars. The Hubble Deep \nField confirmed a long-standing idea that the universe must have evolved in \na series of building blocks, with small galaxies gradually merging and \nassembling into larger ones.\ufeff",

We would need the fossil that \nswam from one layer to another.  We would need evidence that the universe \nis not expanding.  We would need evidence that the stars appear to be far \naway but they're not.  We would need evidence that rock layers can somehow \nform in just 4,000 years instead of the extraordinary amount [of time].

Bring on any of those things and you would \nchange me immediately.\"\n\n-Bill Nye, debate with Ken Ham\n\n\n\u201cEvolution could so easily be disproved if just a single fossil turned up \nin the wrong date order. Evolution has passed this test with flying \ncolours.\u201d\n\n- Richard Dawkins, The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution\n\n\n\"However, the broad lines of descent are so clear that evolution would at \nonce be disproved if the skeleton of a man, a horse, or a bird were \ndiscovered imbedded in a coal seam.\"\n\n- John Haldane, What I Require From Life\n\n\n\"Scientists are usually careful to characterize the vertical status of \ntheir attempts to understand the world - ranging from conjectures and \nhypotheses, which are highly tentative, all the way up to laws of Nature \nwhich are repeatedly and systematically confirmed through many \ninterrogations of how the world works. But even laws of Nature are not \nabsolutely certain. There may be new circumstances never before examined - \ninside black holes, say, or within the electron, or close to the speed of \nlight - where even our vaunted laws of Nature break down and, however valid \nthey may be in ordinary circumstances, need correction.\"\n\n- Carl Sagan, The Dragon in my Garage\n\n\"...whatever I would tell you, where we would be in space or something like \nthat, is bound to be, through the arguments on the idea that unless we \ndestroy ourselves, overtaken by scientific ideas and technological \ndevelopments that I haven\u2019t a ghost of a chance of foreseeing.\"\n\n- Carl Sagan, \u2018Wonder and Skepticism\u2019 CSICOP 1994 Keynote\n\n\nWhile I do not have a specific quote from Darwin, both because he addresses \nthe issue over several chapters in multiple books and also because I am too \nlazy to page through his books, one of the tenets of his theory of \nevolution by natural selection is the heritability of traits (i.e. they are \npassed on from 'parents' to 'offspring').  Neither the mechanisms nor \nmathematical evidence was available to Darwin (he was unaware of Mendel's \nwork), so he spent the larger part of his latter years trying to discover \nthe evidence to support it.  Several times he expresses concern that \nevidence to the contrary (i.e. that select traits are NOT genetically \ninherited by offspring) would render his theory obsolete.  This can most \nclearly be seen in \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under \nDomestication\", in which he so *nearly* rediscovers the work of Mendel \nusing his own data.

OK, so run time back in \nyour mind and everything gets closer together and so denser.\n\nAt some point while the Universe is still fairly large, all material ends \nup above black hole density. Do black holes expand? Even you should be able \nto answer that one. Expansion ends at that point, so proving the BB wrong.\n\nHeard of the Dark Flow? Explain that using the big bang idea.\n\nI've been following the Higg's boson for a LONG time now. It started off as \na light low energy particle which one would expect from what it does. But \nthey couldn't find it within their limits so they upped the figures and \nstill could not find it. This went on and on and on till finally they were \nready to admit failure if it was not found within the latest guesstimates.\n\nThey finally found a particle. Or rather they got a trail on a plate. And \neveryone said this was it and a Nobel Prize was awarded. Evidence this new \nparticle does what is required of a Higg's boson? There is NONE. Not an \niota.

All that darkness around us is nothing but the black hole? but \nhow should that be ?. if black hole is present at north all that blackness \non north is the universes black hole. but what about all other directions? \nMaybe. The external Universe's Gap between other universes is different \nthan the gap we experience between galaxies because there is dark matter \nlike a liquid which is so fine that it passes right through everything. \nexcept gravity. So the External Universe's Gap relativity is different then \nthe relativity of Internal. Which means that the matter including light can \nonly pass alone the frequency this universe is  present in and no other \nmater or radiation or such stuff of external universe can pass... Really. \nInteresting, Thanks.\nHmm. Frequency and Relativity... Hmmm..",

To \nanswer your question, there may be a black hole in the center of the \nuniverse and there very well should be, (think supermassive but larger than \none can comprehend) but for us to see it we would have to wait almost an \ninfinite amount of time due to the fact that we are going away from the \ncenter of the universe!

And if we look into the past then we can see things that \nhave already happened or that will happen? When I said a star that we look \nat is already dead and it collapses and super novas but we just haven't \nexperienced yet but we will experience it soon? Hope that makes sense! \nAnother question is if we look into the past could we see the big bang? \nHaven't we already picked up radiation from the big bang?

But now, in the universe far beyond our galaxy, \nthere's evidence of something far more ominous. A breed of black holes that \nhas reached incomprehensible size and destructive power. Just how large, \nand violent, and strange can they get?\n\nA new era in astronomy has revealed a universe long hidden to us. High-tech \ninstruments sent into space have been tuned to sense high-energy forms of \nlight -- x-rays and gamma rays -- that are invisible to our eyes and do not \npenetrate our atmosphere. On the ground, precision telescopes are equipped \nwith technologies that allow them to cancel out the blurring effects of the \natmosphere. They are peering into the far reaches of the universe, and into \ndistant caldrons of light and energy. In some distant galaxies, astronomers \nare now finding evidence that space and time are being shattered by \neruptions so vast they boggle the mind.\n\nWe are just beginning to understand the impact these outbursts have had on \nthe universe: On the shapes of galaxies, the spread of elements that make \nup stars and planets, and ultimately the very existence of Earth. The \ndiscovery of what causes these eruptions has led to a new understanding of \ncosmic history. Back in 1995, the Hubble space telescope was enlisted to \nbegin filling in the details of that history. Astronomers selected tiny \nregions in the sky, between the stars. For days at a time, they focused \nHubble's gaze on remote regions of the universe. \n\nThese hubble Deep Field images offered incredibly clear views of the cosmos \nin its infancy. What drew astronomers' attention were the tiniest galaxies, \ncovering only a few pixels on Hubble's detector. Most of them do not have \nthe grand spiral or elliptical shapes of large galaxies we see close to us \ntoday. \n\nInstead, they are irregular, scrappy collections of stars. The Hubble Deep \nField confirmed a long-standing idea that the universe must have evolved in \na series of building blocks, with small galaxies gradually merging and \nassembling into larger ones.\ufeff",

Then the degradation begun. We know \nthat when matter and antimatter colides there forms an great energy release \nthat is for equal amounts of particles on each side,if not extra particles \nspared, we can also say that at the begining, in such a higher level of \nenergy state, those collisions or converstions release much much higher \nlevels of energy which will eventually degrade or form small states such as \nmatter and antimatter, which is we know unstable which will lead to chain \nreaction of matter, and antimatter whereever its possible to reach rather \nstable state. So to imagine this, lets throw 1 ton of bulk rock into a \nlake, that will make a great wave, and lets assume this rock when enters \nthe water, decimates into small rocks which will have their own, small \nwaves when splitting up. What we might see is the great rocks explosion, \nand on the way forming of matter and antimatter chaotically distuributed. \nAnd those 2 states, eating up eachother and the universe we know is the \nleft over of those reactions.\nThe main question remains tho, where does that energy come from or what \ntriggered it to explode.\ufeff",

A nebula, from \nwhich stars originally form from. If flying through said nebula, you \nwouldn't become trapped, its unquestionably a result of its incredible \ncompression. In fact, microscopic black holes exist, made from very little \ntotal mass. They evaporate, just as larger black holes do, but much much \nfaster. At any rate, you really can find the truth for yourself by \nresearching gravity itself. Its interesting to note that as you leave the \ncenter or an objects gravitational field, the strength of that field \ndecreases as the square of your distance. Its a direct function of \ndistance, so, if you are 2x further away, the field is acting on you with \nabout 1/4th the force. That equation works in reverse as well, so, the fact \nthat the force increases as a square, not linearly will explain why there \nseems to be that criticle mass/compression ratio for objects of all sizes. \nI know I probably should avoid generalizations such as saying, for all \nobjects, but, I think for simplicity's sake I'll use some in this example. \nThanks for the replays and if I'm wrong here, someone feel free to correct \nme.",

            "text": "you sir, though very close, need to do your research on how gravity works. \nOur galaxy would have less gravitational force if spread apart more, but \nonly due to the fact that the strength of gravitational force is inversely \nrelated to the distance between all the masses. Meaning that when the \ndistance increases by say double, the force of gravity is decreased to a \nquarter of the original. So saying that condensing something would give it \na higher gravitational acceleration is false. It would have the same \ngravitational acceleration, but with the more distance between you and the \nobject, in this case the black hole, the less gravitational force you feel \nbecause of, like I stated earlier, Newton's inverse square law, where the \ngravitational force on an object because of another object, is inversely \nproportional to the distance squared, and directly proportional to the \nproduct of the two masses and the universal gravitational constant(Which \nonly exists because everything in the universe has gravity and pulls on \neach other with their gravities, therefore the outside universe has gravity \nand is in fact, pulling on us with a force, though it is extremely small. \nNot small enough to be negligible, but small nonetheless)",

Stings vibrating a series of multi-dimensional loops - \n\"A Spherical standing wave structure in three dimensions.\"\nSince Dirac's discovery of antimatter positive electric charge E=+m.c2.. .  \n.The conversion is in fact, a ratio between opposite vectors interpreted as \ndistance and time, physical reality and spiritual reality, annihilation and \ncreation, matter and antimatter, mass and energy, or interference and \nresonance within an abstract arrow of time of Cnow at the centre of their \nown 3D ref-frames within the One Infinite Universe.. .  .\nAnd ever since these physicists are still wasting our resources and tax \npayers dollars only to smash these tiny buddles of pure vibration together, \nrather like a bunch of cave men smashing flint stones together, and then \ngiving names to the many individual sparks that fly off just to support \ntheir pay checks.. .  .\n\nWe make money through a process of energy exchange, but isn't it a bit \nridiculous that lies can make more money than the truth?  The Standard \nModel has become like a new religion and the big bang theory is the challis \non their alter.. .  .      Nobody has ever even seen a black hole with \nits magical pulling gravity sucking things inward from a distance.  . \n..That was imagined within grey matter, so they had to invent dark \nmatter surrounding only by many dividual animations of black holes.\"",

Religion was made initially to try and explain and \nrationalize spirituality and unfortunately, the perceived 'differences' \nbetween people were emphasized instead of what is common, and thus \nconflicts arose between the various religions .\nThe two should not be confused in my opinion. A static, retrogressive \nbelief system cannot move along with or adapt successfully to Change, the \nconstant universal dynamic.\nFew realize that before Religion, for example in pre-Dynastic Egypt, there \nwere only a set of Cosmic Ideals - universal guidelines, not fear-based and \nrestrictive rules and regulations; and personal and intimate relationships \nwith their own gods and goddesses, which personify the forces of Nature.\nTo my mind there is absolutely no contradiction in terms between science \nand individual, Nature-based forms of spirituality.\nThe ancients certainly never saw any distinction, as for example Astronomy \nand (original) Astrology were one discipline. The Sumerians worked with \nstar charts, and Thoth, the God of Wisdom, is responsible for introducing \nthe concept of cyclical time - without which, civilization would not be \npossible and really things would fall apart as we would have no means of \nreference to 'hold onto'. If one looks at the Native Americans, there was \nno organized religion, yet they are a very spiritual people in tune with \nthe currents of Nature.\nReally the only conflict I personally see between Science and Pagan Nature \nspirituality is some of the unnecessary and harmful methods used in \nresearch, for example with vivisection; and the wrongful use of technology \nto advance weapons and precipitate conflict between people..\nWe see all life as sacred, and certainly do not believe in either an evil \ndevil or jealous god of punishment.Viva Science and Nature!\nBlessed Be",

The second trick it has up its sleeve is to bend light \nand wether light is a particle or a wave or both wave & Particle the \ngravitational effect bends light so much that it does not stop going around \nthe BH. The fact that we can detect them is down to simple observation done \nby very clever people! If you are religious then God made these like you, \nif you are scientific then evolution made BH along with you and I. Just \nplain fact that they as we exist as do we.

            "text": "+streuthmonkey1\nFirst of all, you are correct in expressing that Tesla was an enormous \nasset to our understanding of electromagnetism and so I do not wish to \ndownplay his work.  He was truly genius and endlessly pursued each and \nevery of his ideas without hesitation, many of which he took no credit for \nand cared only for their impact on the world as a whole.  Despite this, we \nmust be careful not to downplay the contributions of those who chose to \nlook further ahead and beyond instant application.  These men and women are \nnot any less important to us simply because we don't understand or apply \ntheir contributions personally.  Einstein was a great thinker and so has \nproposed a relationship describing the world around and beyond us.  While \nwe use some of his theories today, others may only be proven far beyond our \nlifetimes but that does not mean they are any less important.  Recently, it \nwas confirmed to within 5sigma that extreme gravitational fields can \npolarize electromagnetic waves, as was observed with some that have only \njust reached us and date back to moments after the rapid universal \nexpansion we call the Big Bang had begun.  This discovery, as predicted by \nEinstein, is ground breaking and though we are far from the technological \nunderstanding that could use and manipulate this relationship, it has still \nhelped us to further understand the world around us.  This is the primary \ngoal of science.  It is for the engineers to apply this knowledge so that \nwe may improve our quality of life. \n\nSpeaking of which, as an Engineer myself, let me counter your \ncounterarguments:\n\n1) The time dilation between the satellites and earth is NOT constant and \nwould take far too long to determine by trial and error.\n\n2) When I said improvement of 'Semiconductor Optimization Techniques' I was \nspeaking of the unpredictable nature of electrons and the effects of \nquantum tunneling in which electrons defy potential energy walls and \nrelocate to where they aren't supposed to be.  The detriment of this effect \nmay have been noticed but it would have taken a remarkably bright \nindividual to derive the relationships that describe this as Einstein, \nHeisenberg and others did.  So, yes, technically and Electrical Engineer \ncould have discovered these properties of subatomic particles but then he \nwould simply have been the next Einstein.  For the most part, it is easier \nfor us to focus on the applications of what we know then to work in \nabstract theory, so we'll leave that to the savants.\n\n3) The LHC falls under the category of knowledge that adds to our \nunderstanding, though it many not be immediately applicable.  However, it \nis always worth the investment if there is something to be learned.  We \ninvested enormous sums in the space program in the 50s and 60s, and they \nsucceeded in landing us on the moon.  Just because the outcome of the \ninvestment is uncertain, does not mean the risk isn't worth taking.\n\nFinally, I'm not sure you understand that our understandings are built upon \nthe discoveries of others.  Neither Einstein nor Tesla could have \ncontributed anything if it weren't for the work of others before them, much \nof which was of no use at the time of its discovery.  Without the passion \nand vigor of those who dedicate their lives to endeavors that seem futile \nto most, we would be nowhere.",

Instead of showing Twain, the resulting \nimage showed the screw for adjusting the camera lens  Later, Tesla managed \nto obtain images of the human body, which he called shadowgraphs. Tesla \nsent his images to Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen shortly after Roentgen published \nhis discovery on November 8, 1895. Although Tesla gave Roentgen full credit \nfor the finding, Roentgen congratulated Tesla on his sophisticated images, \nwondering how he had achieved such impressive results. Moreover, Tesla \ndescribed some clinical benefits of x-rays\u2014for example, determination of \nforeign body position and detection of lung diseases (8)\u2014noting that denser \nbodies were more opaque to the rays\n5.

THE KINGDOM IS according to scripture, unexplainable. Jesus if \nHE is not of this earth, what is the word, MANKIND gives, for someone, not \nof this EARTH. Isn't it ALIEN., from another World. Another KINGDOM. Jesus \nused the terms Mansions, what is the difference between a tent, or home, \nbuilding, mansion something very LARGE. When we die, something inside us, \nis loose, it is called Soul, spirit, Heaven in the Bible is UP, Up is the \nUNIVERSE, and if we believe in God's Word, HE created everything and \neveryone, the power of Black holes, galaxies, etc, is powerful explosions, \nforming gases, Iron, etc. Whether you believe, or do not believe, we are \nall going to die, we are all spiritually going to live, for eternity. \nEternity knows no time, Everything, from our EARTH, SUN, MOON, PLANETS, \nStars, universe, is too perfect, everything is moving, and somehow, \nsomeway, everything is forming, something, could we, we is everything of \nmatter, are we forming, who are following his way, are forming, GOD...HIS \nword says, that HE and HIS believers, are ONE, we all unite. very, very \ninteresting thought.

Since mass has \ngravity it holds itself there which is what makes it so small. if something \nwere to enter the event horizon and gets \"sucked up\" it would just add to \nits mass causing it to get stronger. It is not really a hole in space. But, \nit is a hole in time. We do not fully understand the passage of time, but \nwe do know that gravity does affect time, more gravity = more time. That is \nwhy when something enters a black hole it appears to slow down when in \nreality they are accelerating. To us the object in the black hole would \ntake hundreds of years whereas to that object it would take merely a few \nminutes to reach the center since the objects perception of time is not \nchanged.

However, \nmodern telescopes are not able to see it because it does not interact with \nluminous matter, except gravitationally. Since galaxies spin through the \ncosmos, as well as move away from each other, they \u201cmust be\u201d bound by dark \nmatter gravity stitches, since there is not enough normal matter to account \nfor the mass that they must possess in order to behave the way they do.\n\nGalaxy clusters, for example, should have slowed down considerably over the \nlast few billion years of space-time expansion and not maintained such wild \nvelocities. Some galaxies, say astronomers, are moving so fast that they \nare hard on the heels of light speed.\nIt is often written in the popular press that dark matter makes up \u201c25% of \nthe Universe\u201d or that dark energy makes up \u201c75% of the rest of the \nUniverse.\u201d To anyone familiar with plasma physics, it is well known that \nplasma makes up 99.99% of the Universe. The amount of gravitational mass \ninvented to save conventional theories is the same as the ionized plasma in \nan Electric Universe that is overlooked.\n\nRecently, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Paranal, Chile \nannounced that there is \u201cno evidence for dark matter in a large volume \naround the Sun.\n\n...It is electric currents that drive galaxies and their stars. The \nmagnetic vortices between large-scale Birkeland current filaments create \ngalaxies. Birkeland currents have a longer-range attractive force than \ngravity, and diminish with the reciprocal of the distance rather than \ngravity\u2019s square of the distance. That alone could account for the \nanomalous movement of stars as they revolve around galactic cores.\n\nThe flow of electricity through plasma in space initiates the effects that \nare seen through space-based telescopes, confirming ground-based research. \nElectric currents in the cosmos and their associated magnetic fields should \nbe our focus and not the search for that which can never be found.\n\n\u201cPlasma cosmology can demonstrate with simple physical principles the \nelectrical formation and behavior of spiral galaxies and stars without \nrecourse to hypothetical dark matter and black holes.\u201d - Wal Thornhill",

Most--and \npossibly all--galaxies, including the Milky Wa y(see Sagittarius A), are \nbelieved to contain Supermassive black holes at their centers.\n\nDonald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees hypothetized in 1971 that the center of \nthe Milky Way galaxy would contain a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A \nwas discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce \nBalick and Robert Brown using the baseline interferometer of the National \nRadio Astronomy Observatory. They discovered a radio source that emits \nsynchrotronic radiation, also it was found to be dense and immobile because \nof its gravitation. Therefore, the first discovered supermassive black hole \nexisted in the center of the Milky Way.\n\n*Supermassive Black Holes Outside The Milky Way*\n\nIt is now widely accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a \nsupermassive black hole. \n\nIt is believed that black holes and their host galaxies coevolved between \n300-800 million years after the Big Bang, passing through a quasar phase. \n\nThe nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a \n(1.1\u20132.3) \u00d7 108 (110-230 million) solar mass central black hole, \nsignificantly larger than the Milky Way's. \n\nThe largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's neighborhood appears \nto be that of M87, weighing in at (6.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 109 (~6.4 billion) solar \nmasses at a distance of 53.5 million light years.\n\nOn 5 December 2011 astronomers discovered the largest super massive black \nhole yet found to be that of NGC 4889, weighing in at 21 billion solar \nmasses at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma \nconstellation.\n\nSome galaxies, such as Galaxy 0402+379, appear to have two supermassive \nblack holes at their centers, forming a binary system. \n\nBinary supermassive black holes are believed to be a common consequence of \ngalactic mergers. The binary pair in OJ 287, 3.5 billion light years away, \ncontains the previous most massive black hole known (until the December \n2011 discovery, with a mass estimated at 18 billion solar masses.\n\nA supermassive black hole was recently discovered in the dwarf galaxy \nHenize 2-10, which has no bulge. The precise implications for this \ndiscovery on black hole formation are unknown, but may indicate that black \nholes formed before bulges.\n\nOn March 28, 2011, a supermassive black hole (SMBH) was for the first time \nseen tearing a mid-size star apart. That is, according to astronomers, the \nonly likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden X-ray \nradiation and the follow-up broad-band observations.\n\nThe source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of \nthe outburst the galactic nucleus is estimated to be a SMBH with mass of \nthe order of a million solar masses. This rare event is assumed to be a \nrelativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant \nfraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. \nA significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have \naccreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this \nassumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the \nexpected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.\n\nInfo via: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole\ufeff",
