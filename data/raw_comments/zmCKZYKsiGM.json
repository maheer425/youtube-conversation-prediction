These people who insult me think I care what they say. They think \nI'm some dumb 'goyim'. Well, I'll tell you something. I don't watch one \nhour of TV a month. Not one fucking hour. I read, read, read. I read about \nhistory, politics, psychology, pharmacology, biology, everything you can \nthink of. I could destroy these self-righteous Jews in any intellectual \ndebate, but they're afraid of that, so they'll just stick to calling me \nnames (like I give a fuck what they think; think again) and wishing me \ndead. I'm so very afraid! Knowledge is power, and there are more \nknowledgeable people that understand what's TRULY going on now than most \nZionist know or are fully aware of. They think they have they entire world \nfooled and in the palm of their hands. Think again. The problem is, it's \nnot easy to make change with just knowledge alone. But it won't be \nnecessary, because they'll end up destroying themselves in the end. We just \nhave to hope they don't take everyone else out with them, but if they do \nthen it'll show their true colors even more. Look, all that matters in this \nworld is love, and karma, which is VERY real. I'm not religious, but I \nthink if any religion has the right idea, it's the Buddhists. These Jews \nthink they're so clever screwing and fucking people over using their money \nto influence things when they know nothing about how true nature really \nworks, which is why I don't care what they say to me. I just laugh at their \nignorance and stupidity. The stupidity of the Jew (not you, just most \nZionists and some other Jews who are sympathetic to the cause). Any \nsupremacist movement eventually falls in within itself. Jews have admirable \ncamaraderie and devotion to sticking together to 'stick it' to everyone \nelse, but there is always a breaking point, and we will reach that point at \nsome eventuality. Their arrogance and ignorance of the growing swell of \nknowledgeable people who know what's really going on will be their \ndownfall. I'm not worried about what will happen, not do I concern myself \nwith the average dumb Zionist. What goes around comes around. I see it \nhappen all the time, in the micro and the macro, in the context of humanity \nitself. I know so much more I could post, but I don't want to enlighten \nanyone. Knowledge is true power; not money or corporate power, or greed. \nEven love is stronger than such fools gold--and that's exactly what a lot \nof Jews and Zionists are: fools. Not you, apparently, and there are lots of \ngood Jews. There's no race that is 100% full of bad people. But the Zionist \nmovement is truly ugly and laughable.

There is significant propaganda in the Palestinian \noccupied territories against Israel and Jews. I invite you to look at their \nSesame Street ripoffs aimed at children. They are bone chilling. When Gaza \nwas returned to the Palestinian Authority there was significant \ninfrastructure there. Those pipes were almost immediately turned into \nrockets to be fired at local Israeli cities like Ashdod and Sterot. That \nbeing said, in many ways Muslim men and women in Israel are treated like \nsecond class citizens. At best, they live in a fragile harmony together. \nNot to mention the fact that during offensives in Gaza, neither Israel or \nEgypt will allow refugees to enter their states. Granted, Israel will pass \nover with flyers saying 'we are about to bomb this are' which is all well \nand good. But they are still being bombed. And these offensives only serve \nto galvanize Muslims and Palestinians against Zion. So what do we do? Does \nIsrael have a right to defend themselves? Yes. Should it be the level they \nhave chosen to do so? No. Do Palestinians have a grievance? Yes. Will \ngiving them their own state accomplish much? In my opinion, No. No one is \nright in this situation. As a Jew I am biased towards Israel and its \npeople. As a human I pray for peace. I just don't know how peace can come \nabout.

As much as it pains \nmost Jews, we have to give up the West Bank. As hard as it is to let go of \nthe land which was the home of \"The Tribe of Kings\" but we must do it to \ntake 1 step towards peace. But part of the Reason we occupy the West Bank \nand Gaza is because Hamas and other Arab nations speak the reteric of \ndriving the Jewish people into the sea which puts us on edge wanting to \ntake more land so such a thing can't happen.\n\nThere needs to be sacrifices on both sides, Yes we need to give up the \noccupation and let Palestine become a state and if they attack us, we'll \ndefend ourselves, and militant Palestinians need to let go of the belief \nthat you're going to defeat Israel using violence and get rid of Israel.\n\nI know I'm going to get criticised and insulted by both Jews and Arabs \nalike for this comment but fuck it.

I just want to ask some questions which you don't have \nto answer if you choose not to and I just want to drop some points.\n\nFirst question is are you a Palestinian who still resides in Palestine or \nhas been forced to move abroad? And do you have any grand parents that \nlived in Palestine before the Zionists entered or accounts from your great \ngrand parents of their lives during this time because if you do decide to \nput them out there for people to read they'll be good sources for both \nanti-Zionists like myself and Zionists to read to actually see what \nPalestine was like in the early 20th century.\n\nNow my two main comments wasn't me trying to show both sides of this issue \njust for attention but the first main comment was my views when I only knew \nZionist propaganda but my second main comment was me when I decided to \nactually read the Torah concerning the matters of the Promised land, and in \nit I found that we were commanded by G-d  never to have a state or any kind \nof sovereignty after the destruction of the second Temple by the Romans \nafter the failed revolt. Now for the time we were in exile all our \nreligious authorities observed and kept this commandment until the Atheist \nJews in the late 1800s decided to found the Zionist movement. So that's why \nI feel that there can't be an Israeli/Jewish state ever until we've \ncompleted our mission so I want to (metaphorically) fight for the total \nfreedom of Palestine and for there to be no Israeli/Jewish state anywhere \non this earth.\n\nYou as a people must stand strong but must reject violence as a solution as \nyour problems which you clearly do as well as other Palestinians. The \nZionists want to treat you like animals so you will react like animals \njustifying your humiliation and being occupied and that's why Hamas was \nformed, because they were pushed to the absolute limit and essentially \nsnapped.\n\nNow this is me speaking here but. I'm 17 years old and instead of indulging \nmy self in physically based pleasures that British society focuses on. I \ndecided to focus on being a good Jew and helping to complete the mission we \nwere given by G-d, for us to be the light to all the other nations. Now yes \nI could go and play victim hear and say yes we've suffered like no one else \nwould but in fact you as a nation has to an equivalent level suffered as we \nhave and I can't stand for that, especially considering it's being done in \nour name. I plan to dedicate my entire life it I need to, to see you gain \nyour complete freedom by letting Palestine exist. Not some ridiculous 2 \nstate solution or a shared state solution by for Palestine to be free.\n\nBut what we must remember is that there was a small Arab-Jewish population \nliving in Palestine before 1948 and they should be allowed to return but in \nmy eyes, the Askannazis should return to Europe and the African Jews should \nbe allowed to return to Africa.\n\nI thank you for reading this and I want to apologise for the late reply but \nasides from dreaming about Palestinian freedom I had my life to live. But \nagain thanks for reading this.    ",

Let me do mine. \n\nAs a Palestinian, some do play like victims and act like Israel is all big \nand bad only, but look to the Israelis and you certainly will find the same \ninnocent children and people we see in Palestine, under the threat of \ndeath, cults like Hamas pose.\n\nThe acts of Hamas aren't better than the acts of the Netanyahu commanded \nIDF (and even then, IDF soldiers are hesitant to do what they did in Gaza).\n\nDo I believe in a one state solution? Yes where Palestinians and Israelis \nare not Palestinians and Israelis but should be known as \nIsraeli-Palestinians and Palestinian-Israelis, as brothers. But the one \nstate should come after tensions settle in a two state systems where each \nside sees the other as equals and not occupants and occupiers or as \ninvaders.\n\nBut the reality is that a one state solution can only happened when we \nremove the hatred for each other, that means as Palestinians should pull \ntheir part of unity the same as the Israelis.\n\nAlso we need to stop this movement of hatred against Jews and even zionists \nin general, we need to stop thinking guys like netanyahu are the face of \nJews, the person does not make the religion, the original comment has shown \nthis. There shouldn't be a war on Israelis that people tend to say, it \nshould be a war on mistrusts and hatred done by people on both sides. There \nare even zionists (the definition of Zionism is the belief that Jews should \nlive in Israel, it does not state that they all should do it by \ndisregarding life and laws to accomplish the objective) who are not \ninterested in gaining the land with the same mentality of forcefulness but \nto come to a agreement on how to go about living on the land. \n\nSo i am speaking for the betterment of both sides, to stop overgeneralizing \neach other, the same way we are outrage when we hear people say all \nPalestinians are terrorists and deserve to be forced off our land, i \nguarantee the Israelis are just as outraged to hear that they are said to \nbe a land thief and the groups being called cancer. \n\nWhile it seems that Muslims and Jews hate each other, our religion should \nbe our unifying force, they are similar in more ways than it is with \nChristians.\n\nWe might not agree on all points (for example Jerusalem identity) but I'm \nwilling to work this out with the other side and spare death.\n\nI want the future land of Palestine and Israel to be like America (minus \nthe anti-Semitic and islamophobic side) where you know a person and can get \nto like them even before you know what religion they are. (for example, a \nvery good friend for two years, and only recently did I know he was Jewish)\n\nI wish to see people like you and like me to extend our hands and work \ntogether.\n\nOn the fact of the ground offensive, 85% might but that doesnt say if the \npeople who where surveyed where up to date on how effective was that ground \noffensive (for example results like actual militant deaths vs. civilian \ndeaths), propaganda and misleading does play a part in the results so i \ndont take those results to heart (its the same thing with the Iraq war, \ndissent about the war was high only after the results where shown that WMDs \nand terrorist connections did not exists)",

Yeah that helped during the Holocaust didn't it.   I prefer Israel \nagainst a Nazi threat, than Rabbi Shmojo. One reason why many Jews got on \nthe trains was because the rabbis told them it'd be OK. And if you pick up \na bible you'd see the Jewish people had scholar warriors. Not just bookworm \nscholars.  \n\nIf you want Jews to be the only people that cannot have a state then you \ndiscriminate against Jews. If you do that as a religious fanatic that's one \nthing.

            "text": "Living, process, politics and dissociation\n\nWhat do all these things have in common? \n\nWhenever we form a perception we should be mindful of the fact that there \nis a lag between our \"perception\" and our immediate felt experience. \nPerception is a \"content\" of awareness that follows a process which \n\"frames\" how we will perceive something. This is basic knowledge nowadays \nfor cognitive scientists, psychoanalysts and anyone else who works with \nmind and consciousness. \n\nLiving involves process. How we think, the way we respond, how we feel \nabout certain issues, can be described pithily as: \n\na) past experiences and ideas which you have already developed towards this \nsubject \nb) the interpersonal dynamics regulating awareness that are communicated \nsubsymbolically as affective - tone of voice, facial features, etc - \ninformation, taken in by the right hemisphere, so to speak. \n\nI just finished watching an interview on CNN in which the anchor, Don \nLemon, discusses the media angle of the Israel-Hamas conflict. He asks Alan \nDershowitz - streaming on skype - what his views are. Dershowitz basically \nsays that Hamas deliberately exploits western media coverage - and how it \ngenerally covers things - by endangering their own citizens. He then reads \na statement made by a Hamas official who said that \"we\" would need to form \nhuman shields between ourselves and the enemy. \n\nMakes sense. Why would you dispute this, right? \n\nWell, Don Lemon briefly disputed it, and then reformulated his views after \nDershowitz \"corrected\" a misperception he had had. And then the next person \nto speak, a woman....This is how she handled herself. \n\nAfter remarking (somewhat pettily) that Dershowitz was going off on a \ntangent, this woman, who has written a few books on the subect. simply \nrepeated all the facts that Dershowitz had collected. \n\nFirst, I noted that this was a highly demagogic response. She merely \nrepeated, in an addled voice, the surreality of the situation - but for the \npurpose of shooting the idea down. \n\n\"You say it isnt mother and children. So then its fathers. You're saying \nfathers are coming together and planning to kill their own wives and \nchildren, and you're saying that a society, a human being, could do this. \nThat is unbelievable\".\n\nNow, after hearing this complete bull#, obvious example of demagoguery in \naction, I thought to myself: does she actually believe what shes saying, or \nis she complicit? \n\nI'll ignore the latter concept and explain from a interpersonal-relational \npsychology perspective what happens when someone accepts a perspective that \nleaves out important pieces of information. First, why does this happen? \nWhy can people be so stupid - so stubborn - so immured from the truth, or \nthe reality, that may be conveyed by another person. What sort of process \nis in play? \n\nDissociation is a fairly normal and unavoidable fact of being human. We do \nit all the time. And just as colours or weight or any other sensory \nperception can bias consciousness, so can ones personal \"self\" history. How \nyou feel, for example, about yourself as believing \"this\" - this is coded \nin your brain and plays a formative part in how you perceive what is being \nsaid to you. And the catch is: it's complete unconscious. We are not \nconscious of it's occurring until after we see it happening. And then we \nstop it. If of course were mindful enough. \n\nAlthough I never got the opportunity to see how that interview was received \nby Lemon or conversely by what anyone else has known, what I do know is \nthat one group of people experienced dissociation in hearing the interview. \n\nDissociation separates \"self states\" from conscious awareness. For example, \nrejecting a piece of information which challenges a favored self state - \none which provides positive affect - would be dissociation in action. The \ndissociation works by shaping attention to focus on particular facets of \nthe issue. While \"screening out\" through a process of defense and deficit \nincompatible information. Our minds are simply torn away from an objective \nperception by a lack of awareness to how the information we take can bias \nand literally cause dissociation from a very relevant piece of knowledge.\n\nIn the above example, the very relevant piece of information being excluded \nis the fact that suicide bombings exist. Hamas terrorists - and Islamists \nin general - kill themselves ALL the time. We know this. This isn't a new \npiece of information. \n\nJust contemplate for a second what this means. For Hamas to act as they do, \nthey must be....different from us .. Yes, strange. Their minds must be \nconditioned by a different body of ideas. The knowledge they value - the \nQuran, The Hadiths, and theological writings - are nothing like our own. \n\nIn dissociating, whats partly happening is that you take a hyper-literal \nperception of Hamas. Instead of perceiving them as different, and as having \ndifferent views, feelings and perceptions - the woman who gave us that \nflorid incredulous response;: \"how could any human being do that?\", \nbasically makes a generalization derived from her society and culture and \napplies it to them as if the conditions and dynamics between the two were \nthe same. \n\nIt's really a simple matter. The suicide bomber kills himself because of a \nprofound religious and spiritual experience. Theologically, his mind is \nformed by the words of the Quran and major theological writers. \nSpiritually, he takes the duty of Jihad to be the ultimate expressionof \nsubmission - Islam - to Allah. \n\nNow, when understood within this obviously relevant perceptual framework, \nthe idea that Hamas literally endangers civilians lives for the sake of \nwinning a propaganda war - the value which comes from winning support from \nothers - should not be taken as implausible. It is merely applying on a \nlarger scale what we already know is done by individuals. \n\nIn the fervor of the moment, an IDF mission in Gaza can be perceived by \nsome Gazan families as an act of Shahid - for example, that they live in a \nbuilding where Hamas builds bombs or gathers. Or, conversely, if they don't \nrespond to the pamphlets that Israel leaves, Hamas may encourage families \nto stay put as an expression of support and solidarity. \n\nSo, it's not like Hamas speaks clearly about it. Perhaps it's just the \nprocess - the fervency of their religious conviction - that impels them to \nact as this, and not any particular \"concept' which they mean to exploit. \nOn the other hand, I am skepitcal that the more sophisticated Hamas \nofficials aren't aware of the value that a large civilian death toll can \ngive to their international propaganda war against the Israelis. \n\n\n-------- \n\nTo be on the wrong side - and many times there really is a wrong side (such \nas the current Russia/West situation) and not recognize the falseness of \nyour views implies an unrealistic idea about how our minds work. The \nunconscious constantly \"informs\" and shapes consciousness. And when a \nrelevant piece of information - contextual constraints - aren't being \nintegrated into your perceptual system, you need to really probe deep \nwithin yourself, and ask yourself why that is. Eventually, if you are \nhonest and do not subscribe to a purely subjectivist point of view (which \nwould be extreme: perception is constructive, i.e outside reality \nINTERACTING with inside reality. The two together forming a \"construction\" \nof whats 'objectively there) you will allow yourself to accept it without \nfearing the feeling of \"being wrong\".\ufeff",

So the last part completely \ncontradicts what you claim the sketch ment here.\n\nAs for you Apartheid comment, the Palestinian citizens of Israel enjoy all \nthe rights it's Jewish citizens enjoy, and since Apartheid is a racial \nbased segregation, this is, by definition, not Apartheid. The only place \nwhere Palestinians don't enjoy full rights is in the C parts of the West \nBank, but that is because the Palestinians their are citizens of the \nPalestinian Athourity and not Israel (since this is an occupied land). And \nagain, if Palestinians with an Israeli citizen decides to travel, live, or \nvisit those areas (And they do), they retains all their rights and they do \nnot lose it. So any segregation made in those areas aren't based on race or \nethnicity also, so again, this by definition isn't Apartheid, which is a \nsegregation based on race or ethnicity. (I do not support or condem \nanything, just pointing out the major error in calling it Apartheid).\n\nI do want to note to you, that I didn't even commented in my first comment \non any specific Palestinian-Israeli conflict related issue.

Even \nthe prohibition of marriage to non Jews is not racist because \ninterreligious marriages were forbidden on all sides. But, Zionism has \nchanged the equation. It has introduced political nationalism to the Jewish \npeople. A side effect of political Judaism is racism, and you see it in \nIsrael. The root of world racism is the neo liberal policies of today's \ncapitalism. Oh, yeah, Christians are racist if it is political \nChristianity. You must understand that Christianity is the most intolerant \nreligion in the world. Christians hated Jews because they were not \nChristians. Forced conversion is steeply ingrained in Christianity. \nCatholics even converted the Indians and Africans in the Americas. It is \nestimated that 20% of the people who come from the Spanish and Portuguese \nspeaking world are descended of Jewish converts. In the Spanish \nInquisition, at least 250 Jewish Spaniard were burned at the stake for not \nconverting. The Catholic Church were excellent record keepers. When the \nArabs conquered Spain, mostly Vandals and Visigoths converted to Islam and \nJudaism from Catholicism. In 7th century Islam, there was no surplus \npopulation for immigration to Spain.

My dispute is not \nwith the great Jewish people, but with the ideology that has been imposed \non that great people whom the overwhelming majority and no different from \nanybody else. Zionism, however, is a unique ideological political system \nthat encompases different ideological strains upon its people. But \noriginally, it incorporated ethnic identity (Ashkenazi). Zionism \nincorporated a colonial aspiration (settling Palestine) and a military \ncomponent (protection of colonial gains.)  The only presidents to Zionism \nwere the Puritan settlers in the English North America colonies and the \nBoers and English settlers in South Africa. The basis for all is genocide \nand ethnic cleansing. It is reasonable for the indigenous population to \nresist this project. This is a criminal project under any human criteria. \nBeing a persecuted religious minority does not give you any special rights \nto displace a population, kill and steal their land. This is the nature of \ncolonialism. These societies have very serious moral limitations. The \namount and intensity of racism is shocking in Israel. The intensity of \nhatred towards the African refugee who seek asylum in Israel is simply \nshocking. It is hypocritical for the Zionist to say that Jews need a place \nof refuge, yet they deny refuge to Africans is destitution because they are \nblack. Or the forced sterilization of Ethiopian Jews but not of Ashkenazi \nJews because they are European. Today, in Israel there is a moral \ndegeneration. It is because it is a logical result of a racist ideology of \nZionism. If you are not Jewish, and you are an honest person, it is very \neasy to understand this.",

What are they so \nafraid to keep from the general public, and to what ends do they wish to \ncontrol, not only public sentiment, but even the way people think. I can't \nsee things ending well. Money can buy you a lot of things, but in the end \nevery empire always crumbles, no matter how rich and powerful they are. And \nthose rulers heads get chopped off, and their people powerless for \nmillennia. When it happens, and it will happen because history tells us \nthis--history is the greatest teacher, the Zionists will tremble and live \nin the fear and chaos that they have themselves created.
