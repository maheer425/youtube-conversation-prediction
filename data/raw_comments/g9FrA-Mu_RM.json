I oppose federally run schools (we should \ntransition it with vouchers & school choice).  I tend to find TYT overly \nemotional and often very one-sided on a lot of issues, and they tend to \ndemonize Republican stances by cherry picking extremists (like religious \nnutts) or twisting things like \"oh you don't want men to be treated like \ngarbage, you must be anti-women\" etc.\n\nHowever, I am 100% on-board with legalizing marijuana.  I wouldn't use it, \nbut it's relatively harmless.  Treat marijuana problems as a public health \nissue (and maybe a potential social ill) - not as a criminal issue.  The \npolice state & the prison industrial complex does not solve all problems!\n\nTYT stop being so anti-Republic.  Let's get together based on specific \nissues (not party lines) and fight the police state.  We need good law \nenforcement who is accountable for their actions.  We need humane prison \nsystems that focus on rehabilitation and protecting us from people who are \nactually dangerous.  And we need to end the war on drugs - starting with \nthe complete legalization of marijuana.\n\nFinally let me add that the \"bust black kids\" garbage is leftist \npropaganda. Yes it's true that there may exist racism and injustice against \nblacks in the criminal justice system... But let's also not deny the simple \nfact that blacks do commit more crimes. Not all blacks, and this says \nnothing about any individual person who happens to be \"black\" (in fact, I'd \nargue that most of our common conception of \"race\" is based more on culture \nthan on biology). So TYT you can address the marijuana issue without \nspouting leftist propaganda and trying to turn everything into some kind of \nappeal to a demographic group like \"oh we want to help blacks because they \nare oppressed\". Guess what - non-\"black\" people (or people who are \npartially black) have their lives ruined by the drug war too! So don't sit \nover there and pretend like you have to be \"black\" to get your life ruined \nby the police state.\n\nIt breeds contempt for the law and disrespect for law enforcement - TYT you \nare absolutely right, and Miltion Friedman the great libertarian free \nmarket economist agrees. The way he put it was \"inimical to the moral \nfabric of society\". Milton Freedman gave the historical example of corn \nlaws in Great Britan causing an adverse effect on culture that caused more \ncrime and corruption. When the law is absurd, more people lose respect for \nthe law, and more people stray from being adult respectable responsible \nupright honest hard-working individuals, and some will even enter a life of \ncrime, and some they start a life of breaking only absurd laws but once \nthey are in that lifestyle they will break other laws too. It also makes \nthe USA government look bad to the USA public, and our credibility to other \ncountries.\ufeff",

Can't you see why it is \nwrong and immature to use drugs?? What parent would ever raise their kids \nto grow up and smoke POT? Didn't YOUR parents teach you any better than \nthis? Heck, my parents never even said anything to me about drugs and I \nsure never smoked pot. Nobody ever offered it to me or anything! And I was \na teen in the 70s! Same for my husband! And we sure don't know anybody NOW \nwho smokes pot, approves of it or knows where to find it!It is ILLEGAL! \nEven if it were legal, what a thing to do! People need to grow up and set \nan example and not use mind-altering drugs like marijuana or alcohol to get \nhigh, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \"fun\", enjoy life, celebrate, socialize, \netc. \n\nAND MUST YOU USE PROFANITY?? I have ranted against that for years online, \ntoo! Haven't you read a thing I have written? How can you be so crude??? \n\nTdot heisenberg\n \nOK cindybin smoking that mormon crack, your Mormon that explains why your \ncrazy and not all Mormons act like you , I know some great Mormon people \nwho don't do what your doing, I don't believe in religion I believe it's \nthe reason why they're is so much divide between people these days, anyway \nlet's get some shit straightened out here, you hate drugs because of your \nreligion right and don't tell me it has nothing to do with religion because \nyour god will hear you lying? Now I don't believe in religion so I don't \nhave to worry about burning in hell for getting high, also when you get \nreally sick where do you go? to the doctor for meds and what not, now when \nI'm in pain or i cant sleep I'll just smoke weed and I feel better,, what's \nthe difference??? now how bout someone who has cancer and they know they \nare going to die and they can't eat because of chemo, are we going to say \nno you can't smoke weed and get yourself a appetite so you can try to live \na normal life till you die, fuck that let them do what they want, if weed \nis so mind altering tell me how many overdoses have their been on weed? How \nmany people beat wives and kids high on weed? your arguments are useless \nwhen you have nothing to back them up, you and your husband must be cat \npeople or something, because what do you do with your spare time other than \npointless rebuttals people on YouTube , life is short, and if I want to do \nsomething that won't affect or hurt someone else , I'm going to fucking do \nit, guess what in Canada weed is decriminalized and I can smoke it whenever \nI want, it's a plant just like spinach or broccoli, and if you would do \nmore research you'd realise how amazing and life changing weed really is, \nPhoenix tears , research that and tell me why it's still illegal, it could \nsave lives and that's why the government doesn't want it to be legal, weed \nwould single handedly wipe out half the pharmaceutical drugs off the market \n, if your writing books try writing about pharmaceutical drugs, now those \nfucking dirty drugs are the real enemy and they are legal , go figure, \ngoodbye cat lady\n\ncindybin2001\n+Tdot heisenberg AARGGHHHH OH YOU PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Comments \nlike yours only make me angrier and MORE determined to speak up against \npot! I have said over and over how furious it makes me when you guys blame \nmy religion on my stance on drugs! I wasn't even religious in high school \nor college and I sure never smoked pot, and my husband is not Mormon and HE \nwouldn't smoke pot, and neither would anybody we know, religious or not! \nSTOP BLAMING MY RELIGION ON THIS! I don't say anything that any other \nparent wouldn't say! All I am saying is that we shouldn't use mind-altering \ndrugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \"fun\", enjoy life, etc. This \nis good morals and just plain common sense! And pot is ILLEGAL! You can get \ninto big trouble if you get busted! Parents HAVE to tell their kids to obey \nthe law! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?? What is WRONG with you people, putting me \ndown just for saying we shouldn't use drugs and that you can get into \ntrouble if you get busted???\n\nAnd you must be the 200th Internet person just this week to tell me that \nnobody has died or overdosed on \"weed\". I KNOW THAT! I KNOW THAT! I KNOW \nTHAT! The entire reason I have been forced to continue speaking up against \npot all these years is because of all you JERKS who always think that I am \nagainst pot because I think it's all dangerous and deadly and \"ruins your \nlife.\" NOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to you idiots that we are \nagainst pot because it's a mind-altering drug?? Pot smokers ADMIT to us all \nthe time online that they use it to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \n\"fun\", etc. And that is why we are against it! That is what makes it wrong! \nWe shouldn't use mind-altering drugs for these reasons! This is good morals \nand just plain common sense! What parent would ever raise their kids to \ngrow up and smoke POT?? And I say the same things about alcohol! I rant \nagainst alcohol all the time, too--even more than pot! A casual booze \ndrinker is no better than a casual pot smoker, except they aren't breaking \nthe law! CAN'T YOU SEE MY POINT???\n\nAnd then you bring up MEDICAL MARIJUANA??? MEDICAL MARIJUANA? Oh you have \nreally done it now!! Oh this makes me FURIOUS when you mean guys bring up \nmedical marijuana!!! Have you not read a THING I have written over the \nyears?? I have said over and over that I am NOT AGAINST MEDICAL MARIJUANA! \nThat is a totally different issue! I am a nice person and of course would \nnot want someone to suffer! If marijuana truly helps someone with a true \nmedical condition, then of course that is a good thing! I would use it \nmyself if I had to, if it worked and were legal for that! I have been \ntrying for YEARS to write an article on the BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA! \nBut I have yet to find a single decent person to interview to use as an \nexample in my article! All the casual users rave about the medical benefits \nin order to justify getting  high, and even the \"medical\" users I've talked \nto and seen online have been horrible like the casual users, cussing me \nout, threatening me with death and bodily harm, attacking my religion, my \nlooks, my sex life, making mean videos and websites about me, making fun of \nme for collecting dolls, etc. etc. etc. I have collected THOUSANDS of \ncomments and emails from \"medical\" users, supporters and growers who are \njust HORRIBLE. Now all I want to do is write articles and make videos using \nthese comments, to show what people are like! Doctors, lawmakers and the \nentire public needs to know!\n\nIt is just SOOOO depressing. I always thought MEDICAL users would be nice, \nthat surely they would agree that we shouldn't use mind-altering drugs \nrecreationally. What parent would ever raise their kids to grow up and get \nhigh on pot? At any age? And we shouldn't use alcohol, either! I say the \nsame things against alcohol! Alcohol is a drug! Just because it's legal \ndoesn't make it right! Can't you see my point?? All I am saying is that we \nshouldn't use mind-altering drugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \n\"fun\", enjoy life, celebrate, socialize, etc. This is good morals and just \nplain common sense!\n\nIf you told me NICELY that you are all about MEDICAL marijuana, I would \nhave gladly supported you and offered to interview you for the article I \nhave been TRYING to write on the benefits of MEDICAL MARIJUANA. But how can \nI support you after all you have said to me?? Now I have to add your \ncomments to my huge folder filled with all the other THOUSANDS of comments \nand emails from \"medical\" users, supporters and growers. It is just SOOO \ndepressing. I can't believe people are like this. Aren't there ANY nice, \ntrue medical users out there??\ufeff",

And now you're gonna tell me about \nall the moral pitfalls of being gay, I suppose.\n\nMs. Cindybin, there is nothing wrong with using mind altering substances. \n Since the beginning of time, man has always used substances to alter their \nmind.  Ancient civilizations even used mind altering substances as part of \ntheir religious rituals.  There is nothing wrong with taking your mind to \nanother reality.  As a matter of fact, it is healthy to take your mind away \nfrom the stress of everyday life.  Some do it with alcohol, some do it with \nsugar & sweets, some do it with a Fatburger.... I just happen to do it with \ndrugs.  It's all just the same.  Altering one's reality in a responsible \nway is not wrong or sinful; it is a natural state that man has always \nsought and always will seek.  That is why the war on drugs has been such a \ndisaster for America.\n\nSave yourself the effort and don't respond.  I'm done with you.  In all \nyour voluminous writing, you have yet to explain why you think drugs are \nwrong.  Other than to say people shouldn't be doing mind altering drugs, \nyou haven't given a valid reason as to why they are wrong, except that you \ngive your opinion as fact.  Just because you say it is wrong, does not make \nit wrong.  In order to convince somebody of your point, you have to give \nreasons that are more than just your opinion.  That is why with all your \nwriting, you still haven't convinced anyone of your argument.\n\nAnyway, I'm gone. Have a nice life.  Toodles.\n\nThat''s All.",

It's really not that \nhard to find a mental health counselor.  They have them at school \ndistricts, community colleges, and 4-year colleges, plus those who work \nindependently.  For someone who describes herself as an older woman, you \nseem out of touch with regard to finding a mental health counselor.  Heck, \nif you called the mental health department of your city, they would be able \nto put you in touch with a counselor.  It's really not that hard.  But I \ncan see that you are already trying to wiggle out of my proposition by \nmaking it sound like you don't know where to find a mental health counselor.\n\nAs for your other questions... I am 25 years old; my parents are at their \nhome (where else would they be);  they don't know that I'm specifically \n\"like this\" with you, but they do know that I have enough intelligence to \nquestion assertions when I disagree with them (like your assertions);  I \nhave smoked pot on a few occasions, but I didn't like the trip it took me \non.  I prefer to be up, rather than down.  So, I like crystal meth a lot \nmore because it makes me feel like I'm king of the world!  Plus, it's less \nexpensive than cocaine.\n\nAnd before you go on one of your rants about how drugs screw one up and \nthey are illegal, I'll have you know that I graduated summa cum laude from \none of the top 10 universities in the US and I have a MBA from one of the \ntop 5 business schools in the US.  So, drugs obviously haven't screwed me \nup.  As far as them being illegal, I don't care.  I know the risks.  I am \nsafe with my use so that I don't attract police attention.  And I'm \nresponsible for my own actions.  I don't tell others what to do with their \nlives and, conversely, I don't allow people to tell me what to do with my \nlife.\n\nIt is not for some meddling, doll-collecting, busy-body to tell me how to \nlive my life.  I know the risks all the way around and am willing to accept \nthem and, to date, my life has been spectacular.  So, stop trying to treat \nme and everyone else like you are their mother; you aren't.  My own mother \ndoesn't meddle as much as you do.  You are just a sad, mentally-touched \nwoman who has way too much time on her hands.  Get a grip.  Now I'm off to \nsmoke a bowl.\n\nThat's All.",

This is the entire reason \nI have to continue speaking up against pot, is because of comments like \nyours! You honestly expect me to say, \"Oh wow, you are right. I don't know \na THING about WEED, and I always thought it was dangerous and deadly and \nkilled people. But now I see your point that alcohol is the real killer! \nThat makes it okay to get high on POT!\"\n\nOh brother. YOU PEOPLE ARE DRIVING ME INSANE! I want my life back! I never \neven THOUGHT about pot before all this!!! But boy have you guys opened my \neyes! now I realize that we all need to speak up against pot and that it \nshould be illegal forever, with VERY STIFF PENALTIES! Not because of \nmarijuana itself, but because of the people who use and defend it! Like you!\n\nOh this makes me so mad. I type my fingers to the bone for TEN YEARS, \nwriting thousands of comments, tons of blogs, even a BOOK about why we \nshouldn't smoke pot or drink alcohol and how furious it makes us all when \nyou guys use the lame excuse that pot is safer than alcohol and when you \nall accuse us of being against pot because we think it's dangerous and \ndeadly and addictive!!! AND YET YOU ALL STILL SAY THE SAME THINGS! I wish I \ncould devote 24 hours a day to speaking up and EDUCATING you morons!! ",

Even after ALL I HAVE SAID to you, you \nwould still call me a \"troll\" and accuse me of having mental health issues? \nYOU ARE JUST HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't say anything that any other parent \nwouldn't say! What parent would ever raise their kids to grow up and get \nhigh on POT?? At any age?? Most parents try to teach their kids morals, \nvalues and common sense to know that this is wrong and just plain immature! \nAnd it is ILLEGAL! Parents HAVE to teach their kids to obey the law! No \nparent wants to bail their child out of jail and have them face a stern, \nharsh judge who treats them like dirt! No parent wants their child to lose \ntheir college scholarship or job opportunities! If you were a parent, you \nwould feel the same way! But even if pot were legal, I sure don't know ANY \nparents who would approve of drug us! And again, it IS a drug when you use \nit to get high and have \"fun\"! And we shouldn't use alcohol, either! I know \nmany of these same parents who would NEVER smoke pot because \"drugs are \nbad\" think nothing of using a mind-altering drug in the form of alcohol. \nBut they are hypocrites!\n\nOh this makes me so mad. I busted a gut to honestly and sincerely talk to \nyou, to HELP you, and you REJECTED it, and you still say that I am a \n\"troll\" with mental issues, etc. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???\n\nAnd again, YOU are the one who thinks that people are against pot because \nthey think it's all dangerous and deadly and addictive. You told me about \nhow it's safer than alcohol and cigarettes, etc. We all have to EDUCATE you \nguys who think this! So many pot smokers think this! They just don't get \nit! It doesn't even occur to them that we are against pot because it's a \nMIND-ALTERING DRUG! Not because we think it's all dangerous and deadly and \naddictive!\n\nOh I just want to cry. I can't believe it. I busted a gut to honestly and \nsincerely talk to you, and you REJECTED it. You are just HORRIBLE.

This \nmeans that these are substances which represent a high risk for addiction \nwith no credible medical usage.  He then goes on and continues to joke that \nany fool could tell you that cocaine and methamphetamine are both far worse \nfor you than cannabis.  What I find amusing is the fact that cocaine and, \nbelieve it or not, methamphetamine are both schedule II substances, meaning \nthat while they have a high addiction potential they have medical uses. \n Cocaine is actually a (rarely used) topical anesthetic and methamphetamine \nis used in the treatment of extreme cases of ADHD (much like ritalin it's \nstimulant nature helps the mind focus more effectively (when taken \nappropriately)).  Opium, furthermore, is still schedule II (cough \nsuppressant, opiates make excellent cough suppressants, codeine/guaifenesin \nsyrup being a particularly popular formulation); fentanyl, an opiate pain \nkiller with a potency roughly 100 times that of morphine (schedule II) and \n25 times that of heroin (schedule I).  Now this begs an interesting \nquestion: why is fentanyl, a far more powerful drug than heroin, schedule \nII compared to schedule I?  Now the argument could be made that heroin is \nproduced and used in less than clinical settings, while fentanyl is made \nand administered typically in a clinical sitting.  And while it is true it \nis not really an effevctive argument since fentanyl is very often used \nillicitly (it is one of the most popularly diverted drugs by medical \nprofessionals, for example)  and given adequate chemical know-how could be \nproduced in non pharmaceutical settings. Furthermore, meth is a schedule \nII, and anyone curious what backyard meth production and use looks like can \nsee hundreds of videos here on youtube giving a fairly good idea of that. \n The overwhelming majority of meth users in America were not prescribed it, \nsuffice to say.  So why does cannabis (an anxiolytic and appetite \nstimulant) and heroin (an effective pain killer, cough suppressant, and \nantidiarrheal) remain schedule I.  Stigma.  That is it, and that is the \nreasoning behind the scheule I classification.  Meth'd probably be on there \ntoo if it hadn't been scheduled prior to the meth boom.  Drug \nclassification is heavily heavily stigmatized.  Pure, simple, illogical.\ufeff",

            "text": "+cindybin2001 First off let me give a few qualifiers to the argument. I \nwill do my best to keep this short. I do not use Illegal drugs, I know you \nare also against alcohol (and at least in this you are consistent). I \noccasionally have a couple drinks, of this I will admit. So I am not trying \nto justify use of Marijuana, I don't use it and I am not pro drugs. I am \nsimply anti-drug war.  \n\nWith that out of the way let's take a step back on this argument so we can \nunderstand some of the principles that are at play and have a logical \nframework for which we can base our ratiocination (the flow of Logic) on. \nIf drug use and possession is illegal only one force (in worldly systems) \nhas authority over that. That would be the State. Notice I didn't say \nGovernment but State (I am not talking about the fifty states versus \nFederal Government). I am making a distinction here Between state and \ngovernment because these two are entirely different in their origin and \neffect. Government is by the people and for the people. State comes from \nthe primitive past when a conquering tribe takes over another for economic \ncontrol. This is a society of Hegemony (slavery) and is the enemy of every \nfree man. (based on ideas in \"The Law\" by Frederic Bastiat) Government \nhappens because People have a right to Life Liberty and property. Since \nthey have that right they also have a right to protect their Life, Liberty, \nand Property. They can also work with others (as a social Body) to ensure \nthat protection. This is where Government comes from. Men don't have these \nrights because of Laws existence but rather Law exists because men have \nthese rights. In other words, our rights do not come at the whim of \nGovernment but from God. As such I believe that there are 3 legitimate and \nproper roles of a Government \n\n1. The equal Protection of Life, Liberty, and Property under the law. (this \ncan include Police, firehouses, war, etc... it also includes the right of \nregulation on anything that falls under these 3. Hence a right to regulate \nsafety standards).\n\n2. The promotion and upkeep of Public lands.\n\n3. The power to tax only to fulfill those first 2 roles.\n\n(of course there is one qualifier that must be adhered to, that is equal \nrights to life Liberty and property. In other words, I and/or my rights \ncannot violate the rights of another. Hence the old adage \"First, do no \nharm.\")\n\nIn such a Government I cannot force my neighbor (through violence) to be \nlearned, economical, and sober. I can only force them to be Just (that is \nto say, to not violate another man's Life, Liberty or Property). As such \nhow can I delegate that right to force people to be learned economical and \nsober. I personally do not have that right I cannot delegate that right \naway to someone else nor can I delegate that right to the social body. By \nthe very definition of delegation alone it is evident I have to possess \nthat right prior. As such it is not government that takes force over \nsomeone else's vices. Only State can do that and what you are asking for is \nan evil far worse than someone's vice (you are wanting State). You are \nwanting people who think they have a right to take by force and control \nfree men and yet be free of control themselves. Hence you want special \nrights to groups of people and in this case to the controlling class who \nare but mere men. In this you have a logical inconsistency. What you are \nsaying is that Person A and Person B cannot own themselves but can be owned \nby or partially owned by persons C and/or D. Can't you see this is \ncompletely incompatible with a free people. Also, this is not Gods ruling \nif you remember he didn't want Israel to have a king over them because a \nman would be over them. He even goes as far as to say that Satan is the \nPrince of this World. This is not a mistake, it is a claim that Satan is \nthe one ruling over the Kingdoms of this world (hence why he could offer \nthem to Jesus if he only bowed down to him). What you want then is, Satan's \nsystem to perform (what you think) is God's will. This doesn't make any \nLogical sense. Let's use evil to accomplish good. No. If you doubt the evil \nof State look at the how State Steals, Kills, and destroys. Wasn't that the \nvery definition of Satan by Jesus himself?\n\nHow can you possibly think using State to force people to be sober and free \nof vices is a right you possess. If you agree with State doing this then \nyou have offered consent that you can indeed force with violence via the \nmedium of state to stop people from having vices. You do not have that \nright. If you did then it would be perfectly legal and moral for you to \nshoot up a bar or lock a drug user in a cage in your basement. You can see \nin this you clearly do not have such a right. But I digress, I have yet to \neven enter into the problems I have with the drug war (which far outweigh \nthose problems associated with the use of drugs). I will await your \nresponse before I even get into that part of this subject. I just wanted \nyou to have a logical framework to think about this subject in.  \n\nI will wait for your response and chat soon. Thanks :)",

A grown adult should be well past the age where they'd \nwant to light up a joint, smoke it and get high. What a thing to do. And it \nis ILLEGAL. You can get into big trouble if you get busted! You kids need \nto realize this! A judge won't care about any scripture!!! But even if pot \nwere legal, what a thing to do. People need to grow up and set an example. \nAnd what gets me is that I have ranted about this for TEN YEARS online, \nwriting thousands of comments, tons of blogs, even a BOOK about why we \nshouldn't smoke pot and about how furious it makes me when you guys quote \nGenesis in order to justify getting high! And yet you all STILL do it! \nHaven't you read a thing I have written over the years?? I thought I was so \nwell known online! ",

I have said over and over for TEN YEARS online \nthat I am against pot because it's a mind-altering drug! We shouldn't use \ndrugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \"fun\", etc. This is good \nmorals and just plain common sense! How hard is this for you to understand? \nAre you that empty inside?? Heck, my parents never even said anything to me \nabout drugs and I sure never smoked POT. You had to be a totally different \nperson to do such a thing! Nobody ever offered it to me or talked about it \nto me or anything! And I was a teen in the 70s! Same for my husband! And I \nwasn't religious back then, either. I wanted to be cool. But using drugs \nwas the farthest thing from my mind! \n\nAnd then after college I joined the Mormon church (The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter Day Saints) where we have The Word of Wisdom which is \ndirect revelation from God saying that alcohol, tea, coffee, cigarettes and \nmind-altering drugs like marijuana are not for the body. We are taught the \nmoral and physical reasons to avoid using these things. This HELPS us. It \nis GOOD to understand why we shouldn't use drugs to have \"fun\". That is not \nwhat TRUE fun is! We need to use our own minds, and have nice, wholesome \nhobbies and interests to relax and unwind and enjoy life!\n\nAnd it makes me FURIOUS that you guys always call me a \"troll.\" This has \ngone on for years, long before I came to YT. The bully immature pot smokers \non Yahoo always called me a \"troll\", too--in order to justify their drug \nuse. They have to make ME out to be the one in the wrong, in order to \njustify getting high. How sad is that?\n\nOh this makes me so mad. I type my fingers to the bone for YEARS, thinking \nyou guys will understand, and you all say the same ridiculous things. Every \nreply I make to you guys, I think it will be the LAST thing I ever have to \nsay, that surely you will understand! But then you keep replying back and \ntopping yourselves, and I think well if I just reply one more time, NOW \nthey will understand. And it goes on and on and on. It is SO FRUSTRATING!\n\nI never even THOUGHT about pot before all this! And I never think about pot \nin my daily life outside of the Internet! I've never even SEEN marijuana! \nBut boy have you guys opened my eyes. I wish I had a staff of thousands to \nspeak up against pot and educate and help you Internet people!",

I couldn't believe it! After ALL I \nHAVE SAID over the years about why we shouldn't smoke pot OR drink alcohol, \nand he has the AUDACITY to ask me something like that??? \n\nAnd THEN he accuses me of being \"brainwashed\" and avoiding marijuana only \nbecause it is illegal. AND, to top it all off, he tells me that people die \nfrom alcohol every day and that nobody has ever died from marijuana!!! I \nCAN'T BELIEVE IT!\n\nHere is the actual comment, along with my reply:\n \nJulianChristoffer: \n+cindybin2001 \nOk so my question to you is. Alcohol or cannabis?\nAnd you are brainwashed, because its illegal u decide to stay away from it, \nand people die from alcohol everyday. Nobody has died from smoking from a \njoint or a bong.\ufeff\n\n\ncindybin2001:\n \nAlcohol or cannabis? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I have said over and over we \nshouldn't smoke pot OR drink alcohol!

And it makes me \nFURIOUS that you guys accuse me of being against pot just because it is \nillegal! OH THAT MAKES ME SO MAD! I have said over and over that it IS \nillegal now! I did not make the law, I am just stating the facts! Parents \nHAVE to tell their kids to avoid drugs! No parent wants to bail their child \nout of jail and have them face a stern, harsh judge who treats them like \ndirt! No parents wants their child to lose their chance at a college \nscholarship! If you were a parent, you would feel the same way! But even if \npot were legal, it doesn't make it right! Can't you see that?? What parent \nwould EVER raise their kids to grow up and get high on POT? At any age? And \nwe shouldn't use alcohol, either! I know many of these same parents who \nwould NEVER smoke pot because \"drugs are bad\" think nothing of using a \nmind-altering drug in the form of alcohol. But alcohol is a drug! A casual \nbooze drinker is no better than a casual pot smoker, except they aren't \nbreaking the law! Just because it's legal doesn't make it right! Geez, how \nmany times do I have to SAY this? I have typed my fingers to the bone for \n10 YEARS online, thinking that you guys will FINALLY understand, and every \nday I get 2,000 more people just like you who haven't heard of me or read a \nthing I have written. It is just maddening! This makes me realize I need to \nstart making VIDEOS, just to save myself from typing!! And it makes me \nFURIOUS that you guys always tell me that nobody has died from marijuana! \nThat is the entire reason I keep speaking up against pot, is because you \nguys always think I'm against it because it's all dangerous and deadly and \nkills people. NOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to you guys that we \nare against it because it's a mind-altering drug??? \ufeff",

I have said over \nand over how horrible the war on drugs is! I speak up about that all the \ntime! I have said over and over to these pot smokers online, \"Think of the \npoor woman in prison for smuggling pot over the border in her car, planted \nin her car by the cartels. She can no longer raise her son, her life is \nruined, and all because of you immature punks who want to get high and have \nfun! You should be ashamed of yourself!\" I tell this to people all the \ntime, but do they listen? No. They blame the LAW for the drug war, rather \nthan themselves! It just makes us all sick! As the posters on Yahoo say, we \nall need to be OUTRAGED at the casual users who keep the whole illegal drug \ntrade in business and all the crime and violence by the cartels! Instead of \nbeing mad at the gangs and cartels, we need to be mad at our neighbor who \nlights up a joint on a Friday night to relax, we need to be mad at the kid \ndown the street who goes to a puff puff pass party, etc. THEY are the ones \nwho are the cause of all this \"drug war.\" But they don't even care about \nthat. They just care about getting high and having what they call \"fun.\" It \nmakes us all sick. We all need to speak up and talk some sense into these \npot smokers and help them understand why it is wrong and immature to use \ndrugs!\n\nAnd then think of all the people who are in prison because of this! It is \njust TERRIBLE. That is why I have said we shouldn't smoke pot! Nobody would \nhave to worry about being in prison if they didn't smoke pot! I sure never \nsmoked pot or had to worry about being arrested for this! I have never even \nSEEN marijuana! I never even THOUGHT about pot before all this! \n\nAND I AM NOT A \"PROHBITIONIST\"! Oh you people make me so mad, always \naccusing me of that! The more you all focus on the law and call me a \n\"prohibitionist\", the more I say that pot should be illegal forever, with \nVERY STIFF PENALTIES. Again, it is not because of marijuana itself, but \nbecause of the people who use and defend it!Like you! Do we really want \npeople like you walking around actually USING mind-altering drugs? Heck no! \nLook at you! Instead of being a nice, decent, mature guy and commending me \nfor saying we shouldn't smoke pot and trying to help all these Internet pot \nsmokers realize that there is a better way to live, you accuse ME of being \nthe cause of the \"drug war\", and accuse me of being a prohibitionist. OH \nBROTHER. I am not a prohibitionist. I don't want ANY laws against pot! I \njust want people to not smoke pot! And my whole point is that if people \nwould just grow up and not smoke pot, the whole legal issue would be MOOT. \nThere wouldn't BE any \"drug laws\" or \"drug war\" because people wouldn't \neven be THINKING about using drugs. I sure never did!! \n\nBut the more you guys keep bringing up the law and calling me a \nprohibitionist and accusing me of not knowing anything about pot, etc., the \nmore I realize that pot SHOULD be illegal forever. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?? \n\nAnd you must be the 200th Internet person just this week to tell me that \npeople will always smoke pot, always have premarital sex, etc. As I have \nsaid a billion times, just because OTHER people may do this doesn't make it \nright and doesn't mean YOU have to! Aren't you better than that? That is \nwhat I tell each and every pot smoker I see online. \n\nAnd yes, of course I realize that drug addicts need help. I have said over \nand over that I'd have more sympathy for a strung out junkie than a casual \npot smoker. At least the junkie has an excuse; they are addicted and \nhopefully will get help. But casual pot smokers, just like casual drinkers, \nhave no excuse. They can't even see why it is wrong and immature to use \nmind-altering drugs recreationally. And that is why we have to talk some \nsense into them! \n\nAnd when did I say I don't know anything about pot? Maybe when I was being \nsarcastic after you guys CONTINUALLY accuse me of not knowing anything \nabout pot, even though I have been saying for ten years online that I dare \nyou to tell me a thing I don't already know or say about pot that isn't \ntrue.\n\nAnd it is DRUG when you use it to get high and stoned and have \"Fun\". That \nis what makes it wrong. And if you get busted, it won't help to tell the \njudge it's a plant. Kids need to realize this! \n\nAnd then you say you will PRAY for me?? OH MY GOSH. What is it with you \nmean, immature pot smokers and praying? If you guys are all so dang \nreligious, praying all the time, then you of ALL people should know better \nthan to use drugs. A religion is supposed to teach people to AVOID using \ndrugs, not encourage them to get high on POT! Otherwise, what is a religion \nfor?? Heck, I wasn't even religious in high school or college and I sure \nnever smoked pot!! \n\nSo anyway, again, I totally agree with you about the drug war! It is a \nHORRIBLE thing. I have ranted about the drug war for years! And that is why \nI realize we all need to speak up and help these Internet pot smokers \nunderstand why we shouldn't use drugs! Casual users, by their sheer \nnumbers, keep the whole illegal drug war in business and all the crime and \nviolence by the cartels! That is terrible! They should be ashamed of \nthemselves.\n\nSo I hope you realize now that you should help me speak up and talk some \nsense into these Internet pot smokers. I was shocked when we got the \nInternet and I found all these pot smokers on it! I don't know ANYBODY in \nreal life who smokes pot, approves of it or knows where to find it! It is \nILLEGAL! ",

You have no clue the amount of damage the \nwar on drugs has caused. Do you know why it's your fault? Because you are a \nprohibitionist. You claim that you know nothing about the WoD, but insist \nthat drugs should be illegal with stiff penalties. This is EXACTLY what the \nWoD is. It has added an element of danger. Masses of people in Mexico and \nCentral America have died, and are still dying, because of the money the \ncartels make.\n\nNo, you can't say that \"if people just don't do them, then the problem \nwouldn't exist.\" Sorry, lady, that's quite simply NOT HOW THE WORLD WORKS. \nDo you know what kids still have premarital sex, even after being told not \nto? It is going to happen.\n\nDrugs are a public health issue. They should not be illegal. We should have \nprograms that help people heal themselves of the need to self medicate. \nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND. Lucky for me...  this \nis my area of expertise. You can't out smart me here. \n\nAND... FOR AT LEAST THE 2ND TIME... YOU HAVE FREELY ADMITTED THAT YOU KNOW \nNOTHING ABOUT POT. NOTHING AT ALL!!!\nYou simply state that \"drugs are wrong\". This shows that you don't \nunderstand either drugs, or the specific plant... cannabis.\n\nI've given you so many chances to have an adult conversation on the \nsubject, yet you behave like a 3y/o having a temper tantrum for not getting \nher way. I will speak to you as if you're a child from now on. Consider me \nthe stern parent. I simply cannot abide by you sending out fear and \nmisinformation.\n\nI feel so sorry for you. I will pray for you tonight.",

I \nHAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! I never even THOUGHT about pot before all this. \nI never smoked pot, I have never even SEEN marijuana!

I \nhave never even SEEN marijuana! \n\nAnd when I say this is the worst video I've ever seen, I am talking about \nvideos regarding drugs, can't you see that??

The entire reason I have \nbeen forced to continue speaking up against pot all these years is because \nof you guys always accusing me of thinking that people DIE from marijuana! \nNOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to you people that we are against \npot because it is a mind-altering drug?? Pot smokers ADMIT to us all the \ntime online that they use it to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \n\"fun\", enjoy life, etc. We BELIEVE them when they tell us why they use it \nand how it affects them! And that is why we are against it! That is what \nmakes it wrong! Can't you see that?? We shouldn't use mind-altering drugs \nfor these reasons! This is good morals and just plain common sense! What \nparent would ever raise their kids to grow up and get high on POT? At any \nage?? What a thing to do! People need to grow up and set an example and not \nuse mind-altering drugs recreationally! That includes alcohol, which is \nalso a drug! Just because it's legal doesn't make it right! \n\nAnd it makes me FURIOUS that people always bring up about Tylenol, etc. \nTHAT ISN'T THE SAME AT ALL! Of course there are dangers to pharmaceutical \nmedications! But most people are taking these things as MEDICINE, to treat \nan illness or condition they don't want to have in the first place, not to \nget high and stoned and have \"fun\"! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT? \n\nAnd pot IS a drug when you use it to get high and stoned and have \"fun\". \nThat is what makes it wrong! And if you get busted, it won't help to tell \nthe judge that marijuana is a \"plant.\" Where I live, the judge would laugh \nin your face and throw  you in jail for making excuses for breaking the law \nand getting high on illegal DRUGS. Kids need to realize this! You can get \ninto big trouble if you get busted, depending on where you live!\n\nAnd now you are bringing up about Mormonism?? OH BROTHER. My faith is \nimportant to me. I have been Mormon for over 30 years. I studied, pondered \nand prayed a long time before joining this church. I can't imagine being a \nmember of any other church.\n\nAnd again, it drives me NUTS when you all think that I am against pot \nbecause I think it is all dangerous and deadly and kills people. NOBODY \nTHINKS THAT. For the billionth time, we are against pot because it's a \nmind-altering drug! Just like we are against alcohol! A casual booze \ndrinker is no better than a casual pot smoker, except they aren't breaking \nthe law!\n\nThis is the main reason I have been forced to speak up against pot all \nthese years, to EDUCATE you people. You just don't get it! You all think \nthese WRONG THINGS. I never even THOUGHT about pot before all this but boy \nhave you guys opened my eyes. Now I realize that we all need to speak up \nagainst pot and that it should be illegal forever, with VERY STIFF \nPENALTIES. Not because of marijuana itself, but because of the people who \nuse and defend it!\n\nAnd what gets me is that I have ranted about this for TEN YEARS online! TEN \nYEARS! I have typed my fingers to the bone, writing thousands of comments, \ntons of blogs, even a BOOK about why we shouldn't use mind-altering drugs \nlike marijuana and alcohol and how furious it makes us all when you guys \nthink we're against pot because we think it's all dangerous and kills \npeople! Haven't you read a THING I have written?? This makes me realize I \nneed to start making anti-pot VIDEOS! Just to educate you guys and save \nmyself from typing!  ",

I want people to be sober at \nwork, sober when operating vehicles and machinery -- but on your own \npersonal time, do what you want.  I smoked weed for well over a decade \nnearly every single day, but I went to work sober, drove sober, or when I \nhad other responsibilities like babysitting, I didn't smoke up.  I think \nit's so vastly important to educate people on how to use it responsibly.\n\nI gave it up going on 8-years now.  I don't have a want or need for it in \nmy life at this stage.  I have progress on the horizon that requires me to \nbe sober and never have drugs detected in my system and I am perfectly \nalright with that.  Sure, I can drink on my own time, but I'm not a big \ndrinker.  I drink beer but not often.\n\nWith the massive burden on the prison system in the US, I think they really \nneed to go back and release everyone who was locked up for minor marijuana \ncharges.  Lift some of that burden on the taxes to run prisons, tax \nmarijuana sales and pay your fucking debts, you stupid fucking political \ndouchebags.\n\nIf you want to lock someone up for year for driving high, fine..  but \nwalking down the street?  You've got to be fucking nuts.  It's time the \nfederal gov't gets a fucking clue on how to run a country, to make money \nand pay their bills.  Issue marijuana receipts on bond paper and if someone \nhas marijuana without receipt, then you can fine them the tax.  Just define \na usage period, like a half q is good for 2 weeks from the purchase date - \nthen the receipt is no longer valid.  This way you can cut down some on \nillegal, non-taxed sales.  People that are growing weed illegally now can \nbe permitted to grow and earn and that gets taxed as well.  Provide \nlegitimate jobs while everyone makes money and people have their weed.\n\nPeople will argue with me that it shouldn't be regulated, but where your \ncountry is bankrupt, don't argue. ;)\ufeff",

They want them to \ncontinue questioning it and trying them so that they can continue profiting \nby creating  crime where before there was none. They don't care about the \nfuture of America or its' children. These people are traitors and our \nfounding fathers would have no less than hanging them for treason if they \nwere still around today. It's not right, it's not American, and it's up to \nus to put an end to it and see to it that our youth are properly educated \nabout the effects of drugs.\n\nIt's easier for a kid to buy weed than alcohol these days simply because \nit's so common. Eventually, if not already, it's going to become easier for \nthem to buy heroin as well. We have to tell them that we're not going to \nsupport the enforcement of victimless \"crimes\" any longer and if they can't \nstop being greedy assholes we'll just reform the entire system, then they \ncan become a bunch of heroin addicted hobos with maggots for legs.\n\nI am absolutely against public intoxication and driving under the \ninfluence, or even going to work while on drugs, but this shit has gotten \nout of control and it has to stop. It's our natural right to do whatever we \nplease to our own bodies so long as we're not harming others, but without \nproper education our youth are simply not capable of sound reasoning and \ndecision making skills. Yes, we should have restrictions on all drugs and \nlaws that protect others from being harmed by their users, even marijuana \nmust have a legal age to purchase unless it is a medical necessity.\n\nThere are studies showing that early marijuana use can inhibit the \nfunctions of the brain, but that's pretty much the only negative effect \nthat it can have. The other problems start when an inexperienced user \nconsumes a strain of marijuana that is very potent and has a high \nconcentration of THC, the compound in marijuana responsible for the high \nthat users receive, although none of these effects are long term the user \nwill have an overall terrible experience and the short-term psychosis and \nparanoia can cause them to behave irrationally. Marijuana is however 100% \nsafe when grown, processed, and used properly.\n\nTo any first time users of marijuana you should not be looking for a strain \nthat has the highest THC content you can possibly find or you're gonna have \na bad time. Start low and work your way up to the higher percentages \nslowly. If you're unfortunate enough to only be able to get your hands on \nillegally grown marijuana you can get a general idea of the potency based \noff what they call it. Dirt, schwag, and reg/reggie/regular are the lowest \npotencies that you can get your hands on. I recommend just starting with \nregular since the cheaper ones are basically glorified sacks of shit and \nwill likely give you bronchitis if you smoke them.\n\nAlways use a water bong if you're unsure of whether the marijuana has been \nproperly grown and flushed of all chemicals so that your smoke is filtered \nby the water, and don't put anything other than water in the bong, \nespecially anything that has a fat content as THC is fat soluble and it \nwill only steal what you lit up for in the first place. Never ever drink \nthe bong water under any circumstances as it is filled with all the \nimpurities from your marijuana, and it tastes just absolutely terrible \nanyways. You mind as well just dump a tray of ashes in there with it too if \nyou're gonna. It will probably actually make it taste better somehow.\ufeff",

Schizophrenia is also a highly \ncomplicated psychiatric condition, more than likely underpinned \ngenetically, and even though cannabis is suspected at possibly inducing the \ncondition earlier, is not directly linked to its cause. THC can also no \ndoubt inflame symptoms related to schizophrenia and psychosis, but it is \nknown than other cannabinoids like CBD are not psychoactive and actually \nhelp treat these symptoms. What does this mean? It is all relative to the \nplant genetics and chemical make up. Yes most recreational cannabis has \nbeen selectively bred for high THC, but this does not have to be the case, \nespecially with changes in legal status, more research and education to the \nuser.

This guy is an advocate for legalizing weed, a drug, maybe to some \na harmless drug, but then we get onto the topic of heroin, and he \nautomatically regards it as a horrible drug. Has this guy every snorted \nsome dope, maybe shot some up. Weed is a \"harmless\" drug right, because it \ncomes from a plant, right, isn't that everyone's BS rant. You know it's \nnatural and blah blah blah, and what of Heroin? You do know it comes from \nmorphine, do you not, which comes from the poppy plant, which produces a \ngum - opium... that is then manufactured into all of these drugs. But, hold \non 3rni3, heroin is made through conversions of chemical means, and \ntherefore it is not in the end a \"natural\" product - Well what of your \"man \nmade highly modified hybrid engineered weed\" that is grown so quickly and \nabruptly through fertilizers and chemicals and cross breeding and all that \nbullshit, would that also not eventually take the \"natural\" out of the \nequation. How about you all smoke some Swazi gold, weed that is grown \noutdoors, in soil, through the magic of the sun, and harvested months later \nwhen it should be. That to me would be the natural course to choose. Do \nweed and heroin belong in the same drug classification group?I don't \nnecessarily believe so, but I think drugs are classified on other factors, \nso that might be why they are grouped together. Heroin is not the absolute \npinnacle of \"THE WORST DRUG\" out there, in no means. Please further your \ndrug education and actually try the myriad of drugs out there before you go \ncomparing one to another and making up idiotic claims as to what is harmful \nand what is not. I'll tell you right now, having downed a bunch of LSD, and \nshot a bunch of heroin in my life, the LSD was a much more potent mix, a \nmuch more lethal concoction which I believe was seriously going to lead to \nmy death right there and then. The absolute intense rush and mental \ndiscombobulation it provided my person was way too fucking much to handle, \nand this way maybe in the first 10 minutes, I still had roughly 4 or so \nhours of a hard peak, and then another 4 or so where the effects slowly \nwore off, but nonetheless the entire 8 hours were dreadful, at times \nenjoyable, but without a strong mental structure a normal person might \ncompletely lose it, or die, just like that one dude died the other week \nfrom taking hallucinogens somewhere in SA. Heroin is nothing like LSD, or \nCrack for that matter, or Meth, or a bunch of other drugs, but if you are \ngoing to advocate for legalizing weed because you find it harmless, well \nI'd also like to advocate for legalizing heroin and cocaine. One helps me \nsleep good, takes my pain away, helps me with my anxiety, and depression, \nrids me of my anger issues, relieves me in many ways, and the other helps \nme focus, gets me going in the morning, helps me with my stamina and \nendurance, and so forth. If it's cool for people to smoke their weed, drink \ntheir coffee, pop their vitamins and ephedrine pills, get their gnc \nsupplements that aren't even FDA approved, and then get drunk as fuck after \nwork and smoke a ton of weed and jump in their car and smash into my best \nfriend's car, killing him, well I think it's only fair, I can wake up in \nthe morning, blast a nice 5 inch rail of some coke, have a coffee, smoke a \ncigarette, go to work, get off work, come home, and fix me up a 80cc rig of \ndope, and get high, and not hurt anyone, but my damn self, which is my \nright - is it not? After all, in the end no matter what drugs we argue \nabout, does all this not come down to \"IT'S MY RIGHT, I'LL DO WHAT I WANT \nTO MYSELF AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TO OTHERS\"? Yes, America, the land of the \nfree, and home of the brave, and one day, a legal haven for all drugs, not \njust hippie magic grass, and redneck moon shine.\ufeff",

Having smoked a shit ton of weed, and then moving on \nto much harder drugs, and then occasionally smoking weed again, and the \nstrong effects it has, I would be more so inclined to say I'd rather snort \na bag of dope, than clear a bong. This might be a ludicrous assumption to \nsome, but unless you've actually snorted or shot some dope, then shut your \nfucking mouth right there, and don't just go off your experience in smoking \na bunch of weed. Weed is nowhere on that low of a scale, somewhere between \nan advil and coffee, it does get you completely ripped, so much that it \ndoes cause paranoia, so much that you forget at times what you are doing, \nand so much that you can and possibly will hurt someone if you operate a \nvehicle. It's not like alcohol, or other drugs, but heroin is also not the \nworst drug on this planet, it is only known as such a horrible drug because \nthat is what everyone is spoon fed and the lies they digest which later \nthey believe to be the absolute truth, without finding out for themselves. \nI loved smoking weed, and I loved drinking a bottle, but after getting high \non some dope, I'll take the light effects it has, and not counting the \nadverse effects, but I'll take that high over weed and alcohol any day.\ufeff",

In \nparticular, genetics seems to play a greater specific role in addiction to \ncaffeine than in addiction to THC. That is, a greater proportion of people \nwould be likely to become addicted to marijuana if they smoked enough of it \nregularly, while a smaller proportion of people would be likely to become \naddicted to caffeine when consumed in more reasonable quantities. There is \nalso the somewhat arbitrary notion of equivalent doses between such \ndifferent drugs.\n\nIn any case, there is no evidence that smoking just a few joints a day is \nlikely to get anybody addicted, while people drinking just a few cups of \ncoffee per day of course can get addicted, again supporting the greater \naddictive potential of caffeine.\n\nThat does not however mean that cannabis is completely benign, just \nrelatively less addictive than the other drugs you compared it to. So if \nyour main concern with drug use is addiction, you should be more concerned \nwith coffee than with marijuana.

If somebody else presented the exact same \nstudies, you should give that person the same credence. Yes, I have smoked \nplenty of weed, but that just doesn't matter here.\n\nSecond and third are two simple lies in a row. Claiming that \nprocrastination is the only unwanted side-effect of marijuana is silly when \nyou think about it. At the very least, you should realize it can make you \nhungry, which is not always a desirable outcome. There are in fact dozens \nof other examples of fairly straightforward adverse effects. And claiming \nthat alcohol (ethanol specifically) is the \"only\" chemical that affects all \norgan systems is even more ignorant. What about glucose?\n\nFourth is the naturalistic fallacy. Yes, marijuana is a plant. So is \nhemlock. But I would not recommend consuming hemlock recreationally. On the \nother hand, LSD is semi-synthetic. Guess which of those two chemicals \n(cicutoxin and lysergic acid diethylamide) is more dangerous.\n\nFifth is impugning my name with suggestions that I have been \"bought and \npaid for\", despite now over a dozen posts to the contrary. Again, this \nshouldn't matter. It's simply an ill-concealed ad hominem attack.\n\nSixth is the attempt to use language to distance marijuana from \"actual \ndrugs,\" an apparently artificial category consisting of drugs you consider \ndangerous by some arbitrary criterion. Do you really want to argue that \nmarijuana is safer than melatonin? Tryptophan? Carbon dioxide?\n\nSeventh is the suggestion that legitimate uses for the drug negate any \npossible side effects. As if the world were black and white, and useful \ndrugs could never harm anybody. As a diabetic, let me assure you that \ninsulin is both necessary for life and can kill you from an overdose, and \nthe difference between the two is not that great. I am not \"demonizing\" \ninsulin by pointing out the risks. And I am certainly not \"demonizing\" \nmarijuana by pointing out the common (though of course not universal) but \nmild side effects and dependency it can cause.\n\nAnd eighth is the changing of goalposts between the POSSIBILITY of quitting \nwithout symptoms and the CERTAINTY of it.

It is NATURAL. No worse than all the many, many animals \nwho enjoy catnip, or magic mushrooms, or ETC.\n\nSquares and bought and paid folks have an agenda. Live and let live, it is \nnot.\n\nThere is NO comparison between MJ and other actual drugs, or alcohol.\n\nYou do not beat your wife on MJ. You do not drive irresponsibly on it, if \nanything, you drive slower, more cautiously. Not saying better, or advising \nanyone to drive on it, but this is a pure fact.\n\nAlso, almost universally, early in your smoking experience you find \nyourself seeing and speaking about all the up is down, black is white  lies \nand facades in our society. This is just another reason it is demonized.\n\nLeave nature alone. Leave ME alone. I practice medicine, and NO, I am not \nlying. There are so many LITERAL benefits to this plant (put aside the fact \nthere is a cottage industry of practitioners prescribing it for medical \nmarijuana in EVERY, easy to get a pot card sense), that ANY POSSIBLE MILD \nBS CHEMICAL STUDY AS TO DEPENDENCY IS A JOKE--yes, a farking joke.\n\nYou can stop after smoking for two years straight, all day, every day, and \nZERO symptoms. You MAY WISH you had some more, but it will not preclude you \nfrom doing ANYTHING.\n\nSo quite frankly, bugger off already, about the damn pot. In fact, \nstimulating appetite in anorexic patients (not for teen girls with \nanorexia, but folks WITHOUT APPETITE, i.e. from Chemo Therapy) ALONE is \nCOLOSSAL, as they just wither and die, poisoned from Western Medicines \ngreat plan to suck all your money out of your accounts before they kill you.\n\nPEACE",

I have talked to many \npeople who report the opposite, who say they cannot sleep without smoking \nweed. Why should I trust you over them? Because you use capital letters?\n\nI do not for a second believe you are licensed to practice medicine if you \nthink all studies cost millions or that they are all corporate funded. \nActual doctors spend years directly involved in the research process and \nunderstand how grants work.\n\nOne good (though slightly outdated) example of an analysis of cannabis \nwithdrawal syndrome is here: \nhttp://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177137. It \ncites numerous studies, including a double-blind inpatient three-way \ncrossover study from 1999. In this study, patients in two groups were \nalternately given pills containing THC and placebos. Neither the doctors \nnor the patients knew which group they were in, but during days when the \npatients were given placebos, they reliably reported anxiety, depression, \nirritability, decreased quantity and quality of sleep, and decreased food \nintake.\n\nCannabis withdrawal symptoms have even been imitated artificially by \nintroduction to CB1-antagonists, which effectively have the opposite effect \nof THC (and so elicit symptoms similar to THC withdrawal). (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717344/)\n\nThese were not funded by corporations and their authors did not state any \ncompeting interests. The studies were all published in peer-reviewed \njournals. But you have decided they must somehow be biased because they \ndon't reach the conclusion you expect. Who is really biased here?\n\nTHC and other cannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors in the brain and \nlead to receptor downregulation. It would be a great surprise if this \ndownregulation did not result in some form of withdrawal. It is well \naccepted that this is at least partially responsible for cannabis \ntolerance, and the existence of tolerance is also suggestive of withdrawal. \nSurely you do not deny these facts.",

Largely, this is owing to drug arrests.\n\nThis is no different, really, than Churches of old burning witches, i.e. \nwomen with knowledge of nature herbs and the like, healing. Hearst owned \nthe newspapers, did the Texans a favor demonizing weed owing to illegal \nMexicans smoking that to unwind, save jobs for Texicans. Reefer Madness \npropaganda flicks, i.e. Negroes would smoke weed and rape white women.\n\nWeed used to be legal, alcohol illegal. Do you think alcohol magnates want \nsomething that requires only dirt, sunshine and water to replace their \npoison, sold at you and your kids all day, everyday, and twice on Sunday, \nif a ball game is on? How about Big Oil, or Big Pharma? From the hemp alone \n(not the part that gets you high) all the oil based, plastic crap could be \ncheaply swapped out, naturally made things.\n\nFollow the money, friend. Your blanket statement, while likely well \nintentioned, from looking at your going nowhere friends who \"seem\" to need \nit, etc...is not well informed.\n\nJust like these guys on the vid say, or the Congressman...the propaganda is \nso THREADBARE to even marginally intelligent youth, statements akin do more \nharm than good, truthfully.\n\nDon't smoke it everyday, ONCE LEGAL AGE, IF YOU LIKE IT, would be my \nadvice. The one thing it CAN do is demotivate you, i.e. if you don't WANT \nto do a particular thing that day, easier to put on a smile, relax, put it \noff. Why I agree, decriminalize it completely, legalize or whatever, but \nput an age limit (adult, 18) on it, EDUCATE and LEAVE FOLKS ALONE.\n\nPEACE.",

If anything the data is skewed in the other direction. No one is \nsuggesting that Cannabis is completely harmless, it isn't. But it's vastly \nless harmful than alcohol, a substance that's been killing people, and \nruining lives for most of recorded history. Mr O'Reilly who you probably \nreally admire was putting forth a similar argument the other night.  He \nsaid that cannabis related driving deaths were up 30% in the last decade. \nWhat he failed to mention was the fact that they get these numbers because \nanytime someone involved in a fatal accident has cannabis in their system \nit is considered to be the cause. Bill failed to mention the other \nsubstances that were also involved, that wouldn't suit his purpose. He also \nfailed to bring up the fact that  unlike most other intoxicants, cannabis \nis detectable in your system for up to 4 weeks after being consumed. I \ncould have smoked cannabis last month, and nothing since, and if you tested \nme today I would still have cannabis in my system. I'm not saying that no \none has ever got all buzzed and crashed their car, that would be an \nunreasonable assertion. But so is saying that driving fatalities are  up \n30% in a 10yr period all due to cannabis . I think the  last numbers for \nalcohol related deaths in the US for a year were in the 25.000 people \nrange. This from a substance that's not only legal, but advertised to the \nhilt.  And don't even get me started on tobacco, the numbers are \nstaggering. What has you people so frightened about cannabis legalization? \nReally, if you do some honest research, and don't get all your information \nfrom Fox News, and outdated government propaganda. You'll realize cannabis \nis a reasonably benign substance. I'm not saying it's completely harmless, \nfew things are. But in comparison to alcohol, tobacco, and the vast \nmajority of prescription drugs it doesn't even come close. It is time to \nend this  inane, unneeded, horribly expensive war on cannabis. If you don't \nwant to use cannabis, don't. If you don't want your kids using cannabis, by \nall means, don't let them.

But out of \nall the addicts out there, not many are functional and they are behind much \nof the home invasions and general thefts that occur in this nation.\n\nWe need more liberal drug laws, regulate legal heroin for addicts \n(supervised IV shots) as it worked beautifully in Switzerland in cutting \ndown crime and HIV/Hep C rates.\n\nToo bad the DEA is going nowhere, it is a very powerful bureaucracy.",

Heroin as a \ndrug (pure heroin like in UK hospitals) is far less liver-toxic than \nalcohol or acetaminophen (Tylenol).  It is soft on the body, but extremely \naddictive... also it is the street adulterants dealers cut the dope with -- \ntoxic substances or other synthetic opiates like fentanyl/alpha-fentanyl.\n\nThe problem is, as true as that is... this mentality leads to addiction.  I \nhad to go to rehab myself and i know the addiction grabs your soul, but \nphysically heroin is not neurotoxic nor is it liver-toxic.  Tylenol and \nalcohol *literally are* worse for the liver than heroin.\n\nAside from physical addiction, heroin doesn't destroy the brains neurons \nthe way crack or crystal meth does.  In short, if you have enough money to \nmaintain your habit and have access clean dope... you can live as long as \nWilliam Burroughs (until 82) being a junkie most of your life.\n\nOverdose is by far the biggest risk but that is not because of the drug \nitself as much as the lack of regulations on purity. People don't know how \nmuch they are taking or how much their tolerance went down between \nbinges... and then they die.\n\nI am only answering in a matter-of-fact way.  Not endorsing heroin, but the \ntruth is that morphine, hydrocodone, heroin... the only opiate that is \nneurotoxic is Demerol and that is being phased out.  They are ALL wildly \naddictive tho and i learned that the hard way... so don't go doing the damn \nthing.\n\nBut regardless, facts are facts. Heroin is not liver toxic... \nalcohol/Tylenol are.

At that point I dashed to the \nconsole to turn it off. Then as I sat there for what seemed like hours \ngetting my body back to normal, I wept. I was so fucking mad that once \nagain my disorder got in the way of something I loved.\n\nFrom that day on I vowed to not let fear of having a panic attack give me a \npanic attack. I could talk for years about different methods and what not \nto help prevent and stop them, but just know it didn't happen over night as \nit's a mental and physical problem. I'm not saying you should smoke weed or \nanything. All I'm saying is fight the motherfucker. With every ounce of \nyour being. Meds or what not, doesn't matter. Don't let it get in the way \nof anything Period. \n\nAlso, as to not sound too much like a douche for down-playing Matt. My bad \npanic attacks consist of me on the ground in full body paralysis(except \nwith pain) where what feels like every muscles in my hands and legs are on \nfire. Think rigamortis or something. Everything lockups in such a painful \nfashion. Fun times. ",

What he describes is a very \nreal possible reaction to cannabis use, and one I have experienced myself. \n After smoking a large amount of cannabis after I had abstained for a few \nmonths, I had a panic attack.  I became disoriented, cold and sweaty, \ncramped muscles, and anxiety.  This was a very bad reaction to marijuana, \nbut is actually a reaction that can occur after smoking too many cigarettes \nwhen you are not tolerant to the nicotine.  Panic attacks are the body's \nnatural response to a wide range of drastic and unforeseen changes to \nneurochemistry, but what everyone needs to remember is that they are \ntemporary and harmless.  I am very well versed in mental health and \nneuroscience issues, so I knew what the symptoms of a panic attack were and \neven during the attack I was able to remain relatively calm and knew it \nwould pass.  Panic attacks do not cause long term anxiety, and cannabis use \ncannot create an anxiety problem where before there was none.  ",

Schedule I \ndrugs are the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with \npotentially severe psychological or physical dependence.\"\n\nThe lack of medical uses obviously isn't true of marijuana, heroin, or even \necstasy and LSD, yet they are kept schedule 1 despite several lawsuits \nbecause of their \"addictiveness.\"",

You are depressed, \nhere take these pills.\n\nBy the WAY...all these pills we are giving you have side-effects that are \narguably worse than the condition we are treating.  So we will need to give \nyou more pills to counter that.\n\nWhat, you want to use a drug you can NOT OD on, and you can't get addicted \nto (arguable I know)?

All other drugs here account for only \n15% of the cost of our health budget due to drug abuse.\n\nHaving said that, crystal meth is the drug causing most of the social \nproblems here and it is endemic in some areas like where I live. High \nunemployment, racism, few opportunities. It's taken over from heroin and \n\"speed\" meth. One in three adults in my suburb, one of the worser ones, \nwould be users. Petty crime, assaults, etc; all due to the psychosis' \ncaused by this drug or the need to feed a habit, the child neglect, etc; \nare becoming more common. I'm told places in the US are no different in \nthis regards.\n\nWe don't get pot heads roaming the streets looking for victims here. No pot \nheads doing house invasions. Bugger all pot heads thieving to support a \nhabit. Nobody is being knifed over a gram (or several) of cannabis. \nHabitual thieves that smoke pot may commit crimes, but not even close to \nevery, let alone most users in town. That's all being done by \"Ice Heads\" \nand to a lesser extent heroin addicts.\n\nThe thing about crystal meth is, according to SBS's Dateline a few years \nback (they broke the Abu Graib story),  there's only three factories in the \nworld, all of them in India that manufacture one of the key ingrediants \nreqired to bake crystal meth (Ice.). All that has to happen to close the \nwhole \"Ice\" trade is to close down those three factories, or update their \nfacilities to produce newer chemicals, and the whole trades gone.\n\nAdmitedly someone will come up with a newer chemical drug formulae for \ndangerous recreational use at some point, but the \"Ice\" problem would be \ngone. Then down to rehabilitation and recovery programmes to clean up the \nabsolute social mess it's left many areas of many countries in.\n\nPot.... bi-polarity, some forms of clinical depression, smoking it very \nyoung, yes, they all cause problems in some pot users, mostly treatable. \nCompared to the real costs socially, physically, economically, related \ndeaths, assaults, robberies, fatal accidents, incarcerations, etc; from \nharder drugs going \"hard on pot\" seems to lack critical prioritization. A \ncriminal triage process.
