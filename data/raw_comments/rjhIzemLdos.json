The Spanish \ndollar was the most valued and stable currency in the world, it was also \nthe most commonly used coin in trade. The Spanish dollar was widely used by \nmany countries as international currency because of its uniformity in \nstandard and milling characteristics. Some countries countersigned the \nSpanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.The Spanish \ndollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based. \nBecause it was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it \nbecame the first world currency by the late 18th century. Aside from the \nU.S. dollar, several other existing currencies, such as the Canadian \ndollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the Philippine peso, and \nseveral currencies were initially based on the Spanish dollar. \nSpain didn't have colonies, they had vice-royalties, which means that \nMexico, Peru, etc. had the same rights as the people in Spain, no other \nnation or Kingdom in the world ever did anything similar, Spaniards gave \nthe \"new world\", a language, Greek philosophy, superior technology etc. \nSpain built over 25 Universities in America, how many did the French, \nBritish and Portuguese built at that time in their colonies?\nIndigenous people never asked for Independence, they were happy with being \npart of the Kingdom of Spain, the people who instigated the revolutions \nagainst the Spanish Kingdom were all funded by the British Elite, this is \ncommon knowledge among historians (some of them British Historians), Simon \nBolivar was a free-mason and a lackey of the British Monarchy. The Spanish \nEmpire was once the most powerful in the world now it is divided into \nlittle third-world countries that have unpayable external debts. It's sad \nhow little people in Latin-American countries know about their own history, \nI've traveled to South America 5 times already and most people have no idea \nabout it.\nAll of what I've stated has been documented and I have the sources to prove \nit. People who want to know more and beginners should read the book \n\"Iberia\" by James Michener and V\u00e4rldshistoria (Universal History) by Carl \nGrimberg.\nThe USA only exists because of Spain, Spain owned Alabama, Florida, Texas, \netc. this would take a long time to explain, but how many people know that \nin 1777, Benjamin Franklin, American representative in France, called for \nthe aid of Spain obtaining by this means 215 bronze cannons, tents, \ngrenades, 30,000 muskets, bayonets and uniforms, musket balls and 300,000 \npounds of powder. Franklin, thankful for it, wrote a letter to the Count of \nAranda appreciating all the help, and subsequently received over 12,000 \nmuskets, sent to Boston from Spain. In addition, Spain gave him almost \n2,000,000 silver pesos.\n\n\n\"Americans great inadequacies is lack of knowledge of the whole SPANISH \ninfluence, Exploration, contribution and development of U.S. History \nstarting in the 1500's,which is a tremendous story!\" President John F. \nKennedy\n\"Oldest history of the U.S. is written in Spanish.\" Thomas Jefferson\n\nWhat once was the most prosperous Empire of the world is now divided into \nlittle countries with external debts that can never be paid. The same goes \nfor the US, once we were the greatest country of the world, a country built \nby immigrants, the US is now about to crumble, ever since 1914 all of the \nmoney in the US has been created and issued by an illegal method that will \neventually destroy this country. Did any of you guys know about the \nexternal debt of the US: 17,997,889,181,468.20 US dollars. Only a fool will \nrefuse to see the truth. Cui bono \"to whose benefit?\ufeff",

He joined the wise men of this century and made them think about \nit: as a result, the first human rights were born (\"derecho de gentes\", as \nJames Brown Scott said: \"I, James Brow Scott, anglosazon and protestant, \ndeclare fray Francisco of Vitoria, spanish, catholic and dominic monk, as \nthe true founder of the modern school of International Law\").\n\n-The first 8-hours work day was first enjoyed by native miners in Am\u00e9rica, \nas a law made by Philippe II, king of Spain, in the XVI century.\n\n-In percentage, died more spanish due to hard acclimatation and strange \nillness in Am\u00e9rica (50%) than native american due to european flu (20-30%). \n- Spanish colonies had democratic representation in Spanish Cortes \n(parliament), not as english ones.\n\n- Spanish inquisition could not judge native americans (nor pagans it was \nnot made for that neither catholics -they considered them as new faith men, \nwith more rights than peninsular spanish-). - Encomienda (social system of \nwork distribution), was made with some mistakes at first, but it ended \nbeing far softer than the analog sytem in Europe.\n\nI could keep going, but I preffer to recommend some GOOD history authors \nfor being read by interested ones: Philip W.

De hecho, al contrario de lo que se suele creer, los \nespa\u00f1oles nunca impusieron el castellano a los nativos. Fueron los propios \ncriollos independentistas, influidos por las ideas ilustradas del XVIII, \nlos que cuando consiguen la independencia de aquellas tierras imponen la \nense\u00f1anza del castellano. Cualquier libro de historia del espa\u00f1ol lo \nconfirma. (De hecho, los pasquines independentistas se editaron en lenguas \nind\u00edgenas porque eran la mayor\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n, la cu\u00e1l era cat\u00f3lica pero \nno ten\u00eda absoluta idea del castellano).\nPor supuesto, no voy a decir que los espa\u00f1oles de entonces no hicieran \nbarbaridades con los nativos.

Si as\u00ed \nhubiera sido, hoy d\u00eda no tendr\u00edan el aspecto f\u00edsico que tienen aquellas \npoblaciones. Comp\u00e1rese este aspecto f\u00edsico con el de los habitantes de \nEstados Unidos, quienes arrasaron completamente a las poblaciones de indios \nnorteamericanos hasta dejarlas reducidas a reservas.

Society is heavy \nmilitarized and religious.\n\n- The *SAME* year in which the war ends, America is discovered. Religious \nand military leaders are sent abroad. They find pagans cutting out hearts \nof other conquered tribes. I mean, what do you expect will happen? These \nare people who have been warring all their life, for dozens of generations, \nand are as Christian as you can get.\n\n- Goal: Liberate conquered tribes, destroy pagans, work the mines. They do \nit. The Queen passes a law that forbids from enslaving the natives and \ntells to treat them as Spanish, as long as they convert. 80% of the \ngovernors in the Americas ignore this. A few governors get caught, \narrested, and put to death (Colombus being a prime example; he wasn't put \nto death because of his services to the crown, but he was arrested and \nstripped of his titles and riches).\n\n- The general tone, however, is that common people marry and have children \nwith the natives, and it is common for the natives to marry a Spaniard to \nrise in the social scale. Once a native becomes Christian and learns \nSpanish, he/she is considered Spanish.\n\n- Some viceroys and nobles choose to obey the Crown fully, and black slaves \nare brought from Africa, since Native Americans are Spanish and can't be \nenslaved (Rennaissance logic, not much to say about that, but hey, our \nactual colonies weren't that bad). This is not common, though (as evidenced \nby the fact that there are not so many blacks in central and South America, \nespecially if you compare with the English Caribbean colonies, which are \nalmost fully populated by blacks).\n\n- The Spanish proceed to wipe their asses with Europe, with their \nnewly-acquired riches and millitary tradition of great generals, \n\"centuries-at-war\" hardened soldiers, and powerful tactics, very advanced \nfor their time.\n\n- Eventually, after 200 years, the Empire starts its decadence. Bitter, \nbutthurt enemies create the \"Black Legend\", an old \"Internet meme\" of some \nsorts about our country being evil in its purest form.\n\n- Their Empires fight wars against ours. Thousands of our American natives \nfight on the side of Spain to avoid being conquered by the British (I \nwonder why, since we were so terrible, right?). The British proceed to \nobliterate the North American indians, among other things, but in the end \nthey write history.\n\nNowadays:\n- General opinion: Spanish Empire, bad bad bad. British Empire, good good \ngood.\n- South American natives alive today (speaking spanish): 200 million, most \nof them mixed, with Spanish ancestry.\n- North American natives alive today: 3 million, in reservations.\n\nI rest my case.

The funny thing is, when we discuss this in my \nuniversity class on Spanish colonialism (attended by students from around \nthe world and taught in Madrid, mind you) people from all sides of the \nargument are able to discern the atrocities committed by the indigenous \npeoples to each other as well as the atrocities committed by Europeans. \nMoreover, we make it very clear to each other that we also respect and \nunderstand the positive contributions the meeting of cultures gave to the \nworld. History is not black and white. There are no heroes or villains in \nthe story of man. We are a people of grey morals who are capable of both \ngreat good and evil. Understand your fellow man, understand his \nperspective, and strive for a better tomorrow so that generations in the \nfuture can look back at us with some semblance of pride. \ufeff",

            "text": "Haha, so it was ok for the Incas to do the Mit'a, but it was not ok when \nthe spaniards did it? Talk about hipocrisy to satanize Spain's deed in \nAmerica. You say the unified \"Holy Roman Empire\" was not an empire. \u00bfWhat? \nit was \"Holy\" in the sense of having the support of the Pope (most of the \ntime though, Charles V had struggles with his contemporary Pope, which \nCharles won after the sack of Rome). Ok, I'll give it to you it wasn't \n\"Roman\". But it was an Empire. First let's define empire. In my dictionary \nI found this: lands ruled by single authority: a group of nations, \nterritories, or peoples ruled by a single authority, especially an emperor \nor empress. And the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy (DRAE in \nspanish) says: \"Conjunto de Estados sujetos a un emperador\", now you migh \nas well translate that, but it's basically the same definition.\n\nAnd yeah, classic that an anglo-centered historian talks about Spain's \nfailures, but \"inexplicably\" doesn't talk much of Spain's goals, as \nbasically defending Europe from the Ottomans at the battle of Lepanto. And \nalso you talk about english literature in a video about Spain? Ever heard \nof the \"Siglo de Oro\"? Or even Cervantes with El Quijote?\n\nIt also doesn't make any sense, you try to justify the sacrifices made by \nthe aztecs, which stopped after the evangelization of the indigenous \npeople. AND, it is proven that it wasn't a violent imposition, the \nindigenoud were excited about this religion which was new to them, and \nadopted it gladly. Now there were incidents obviously, but when talking in \ngeneral, now, I do make a point. ANd if you bring up the inquisiton, \nplease, compare the number of the inquisition to that of the human \nsacrifices.\n\nAnd the Viceroyalty of Peru wasn't as big as you portrayed it to be, there \nwere other two Viceroyalties there. The Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada \n(modern day Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador), and The Viceroyalty of Rio de \nla Plata (Modern day Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay I think). Also, \ngre way to go talking about the deaths of indigenous people, but not how \nthey actually mixed with the spaniards, thing that barely happened in the \nenglish colonies. Also Guatemala is more towards the southeast. Now we can \nsee here the stereotype of the United States' ignorance in geography.\n\nAlso it is great how you don't talk about how everything started with \nIsabel the Catholic, which unified Spain into one entity, instead you talk \nabout Elizabeth.. yuck. You also say \"Most of the silver mines in the \nAmericas went to Europe\". Seriously? The quinto real which was the 20% of \nthe wealth produced went to Spain, the other 80% stayed in America, the \nmoney was used to build roads, aqueducts, universities (Yes, you heard it, \nreal fucking universities, which FYI, only the Spanish did it in the \namericas long before the british), harbors, and forts, and permanent armies \nto defend the Viceroyalties, these last two made to defend from british and \nfrench pirates. Finally, get this, a Viceroyalty is not the same as a \ncolony, the viceroyalty is basically another part of the metropolis, and a \ncolony is merely seen as a fabric for goods.\n\nIn conclusion, this is just another way to satanize the spanish made for \nignorants who won't read history by theselves. You want to learn history \nfor real? READ BY YOURSELF. Aaaand, before you call me a spanish butthurt, \nI'm from Veracruz, Mexico. A city founded by the great Cortes, the first \ncity in mainland Am\u00e9rica. I'm proud of my hispanic heritage, proud of being \nan hispano, not a \"latino\" term invented by the french to divide even more \nus hispanics.\n\nPeace out.\ufeff",

Los dem\u00e1s estaban achantados, \nincluido el papa de Roma, al que le \u00edbamos recortando los poderes \ntemporales en Italia una cosa mala y nos ten\u00eda unas ganas tremendas, pero \nno le quedaba otra que tragar bilis y esperar tiempos mejores. Por aquella \n\u00e9poca, con eso de la expansi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, el imperio que crec\u00eda en Am\u00e9rica y \nlas nuevas tierras descubiertas por la expedici\u00f3n de Magallanes y Elcano al \ndar la vuelta al mundo, los espa\u00f1oles ten\u00edamos la posibilidad, en vez de \nmalgastar nuestra mala leche cong\u00e9nita en destriparnos entre vecinos, de \nvolcarla por ah\u00ed afuera, conquistando cosas, dando por saco y yendo como \nnos gusta, de nuevos ricos y sobrados por encima de nuestras posibilidades: \nYo no s\u00e9 de d\u00f3nde saca / p'a tanto como destaca, que luego dijo la \nzarzuela, o la copla, o lo que fuera. Y claro, la pe\u00f1a nos odiaba como es \nde imaginar; porque guapos no s\u00e9, pero oro y plata de las Indias, chuler\u00eda \ny ej\u00e9rcitos imbatidos y temibles aquellos tercios viejos ten\u00edamos para dar \na todos las suyas y las del pulpo; y quien ten\u00eda algo que perder buscaba \ncongraciarse con esos animales morenos, bajitos, crueles y arrogantes que \nten\u00edan al orbe agarrado por la entrepierna, haciendo realidad lo que luego \nresumi\u00f3 alg\u00fan poeta de cuyo nombre no me acuerdo: Y simples soldados rasos \n/ en portentosa campa\u00f1a / llevaron el sol de Espa\u00f1a / desde el oriente al \nocaso. Porque h\u00e1ganse idea: s\u00f3lo en Europa, ten\u00edamos la pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica \n(Portugal estaba a punto de nieve, porque Carlos V, encima, se cas\u00f3 con una \nprincesa de all\u00ed que se romp\u00eda de lo guapa que era), Cerde\u00f1a, N\u00e1poles y \nSicilia, por abajo; y por arriba, ojo al dato, el Milanesado, el \nFrancocondado que era un trozo de la actual Francia, media Suiza, las \nactuales B\u00e9lgica, Holanda, Alemania y Austria, Polonia casi hasta Cracovia, \nlos Balcanes hasta Croacia y un cacho de Checoslovaquia y Hungr\u00eda. As\u00ed que \ncalculen con qu\u00e9 ojos nos miraba la pe\u00f1a, y qu\u00e9 ganas ten\u00edan todos de que \nnos agach\u00e1ramos a coger el jab\u00f3n en la ducha. El que peor nos miraba, \nturcos aparte hasta con ellos pact\u00f3 para hacernos la cama, el muy cabr\u00f3n, \nera el rey de Francia, un chulito guaperas de quiero y no puedo llamado \nFrancisco I, cursi que te mueres, con mucho quesquesev\u00fa y mucho \nquesqueses\u00e1. Y Fran\u00e7ois, que as\u00ed se llamaba el pavo en gabacho, le ten\u00eda a \nnuestro emperata Carlos una envidia horrorosa, comprensible por otra parte, \ny estuvo dando la brasa con territorios por aqu\u00ed e Italia por all\u00e1, hasta \nque el ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol es un decir, porque all\u00ed hab\u00eda de todo le dio una \nestiba horrorosa en la batalla de Pav\u00eda, con el detalle de que el rey \nfranchute cay\u00f3 en manos de una compa\u00f1\u00eda de arcabuceros vascos a los que \ntuvo que rendirse, imaginen el di\u00e1logo, errendit\u00fa barrabillak (o te rindes \no te corto los huevos, en traducci\u00f3n libre: de Hernani era el energ\u00fameno \nque le puso la espada en el pescuezo), y el monarca parpadeando \ndesconcertado, pregunt\u00e1ndose a qui\u00e9n carajo se estaba rindiendo y si se \nhabr\u00eda equivocado de guerra. Al fin se rindi\u00f3, qu\u00e9 remedio, y acab\u00f3 \nprisionero en Madrid, en la torre de los Lujanes, justo al lado de la casa \ndonde hoy vive Javier Mar\u00edas. Pero bonito, lo que se dice bonito, y que \ntambi\u00e9n pas\u00f3 en Italia, fue lo del papa: \u00e9ste se llamaba Clemente VII, y \npodr\u00edamos resumirlo psicol\u00f3gicamente diciendo que era un hijo de puta con \nbalcones a la plaza de San Pedro, traidor y taca\u00f1o, dado a compadrear con \nFrancia y a mojar en toda conspiraci\u00f3n contra Espa\u00f1a. Pero le sali\u00f3 el \nchino mal capado, porque en 1527, por razones que ustedes pueden encontrar \ndetalladas en los libros de Historia v\u00e9ase Saco de Roma, el ej\u00e9rcito \nimperial (seis mil espa\u00f1oles que imag\u00ednenselos, diez mil alemanes puestos \nde cerveza hasta las trancas y marcando el paso de la oca, dos mil \nflamencos y otros tantos italianos hablando con su mamma por tel\u00e9fono) tom\u00f3 \npor asalto las murallas de Roma, hizo 40.000 muertos sin despeinarse y \nsaque\u00f3 la ciudad durante meses. Y no colgaron al papa de una farola porque \nel vicario de Cristo, remang\u00e1ndose la sotana, corri\u00f3 a refugiarse en el \ncastillo de Sant'Angelo.

Not that I'm saying ANY race or culture is better than \nthe other in truth but it was the Romans that made his Germanic barbarians \nlearn to read, write and organize into \"civilized\" society.

They lose their language and a new one mixed with Latin and vulgar \nGermanic is created and claim it is their own. They conquer the world with \nan organized military they learned from the Romans and claim it as their \nculture. They eschew their old gods Wotan, The Horned God,etc... and are \nindoctrinated into an ancient Middle Eastern religion called Christianity \npaint God white and claim it was their own all along.

It would be nice if they said, well this happened to us why \nare we doing it to others? But this is the nature of the putrid human \ncondition, we treat others how we were treated.

And I don't think any Hispanic (Latinos too) \ndenies that what Spain did was pretty fucked up. However, I myself am 1/4 \nIndian (I'm latinamerican) and I think that in a way, their reign resulted \nmuch better for the natives as in English colonies. Look at the U.S.: \nThere's almost no natives left anywhere, they live in scattered little \nreservations with little resources. Look at a country like Mexico: Yes, the \nnatives still do live in generally more poverty as the whites, but they're \nslowly being made equal. And look at all the mixed race people there, too. \nThey're also rising more and more to equality. At least they're still \nthere, and they were assimilated, but they're culture has in a way \nsurvived, though mixed with Spanish culture. Look again at any Anglo \ncolonial country: almost no natives, and the natives which are there have \nbeen pushed away from the white colonizers and their cultures have had \nalmost no influence on the culture of the now white majorities in those \ncountries. Now tell me again that the Spanish treated their natives worse \nthan the Anglos. They at least survived and were assimilated and now make \nup a majority in most latinamerican countries. The Anglos however, had a \nracist and xenophobic policy of killing every native they saw until they \nwent away. And yet most anglo countries simply don't talk about it, or deny \nit altogether. And the Australians as an example still treat their natives \nlike shit. So again before you Anglos want to insult us Hispanics and try \ndemonizing our ancestors as murderers and slavers, look back at your own \nhistory and see that what you guys did is just as bad if not worse.",

Te guste o no, la escritura es importantisima para \nla humanidad, nos permite registrar nuestra cultura, nuestra historia, \nnuestras historias (literatura) nos permite comunicar ideas complejas como \nla ciencia y la matematica a generaciones posteriores e incrementar asi \nnuestro conocimiento mas alla de lo que permite el tiempo de una vida \nhumana; sin escritura, una sociedad esta condenada a caer en la niebla de \nlos mitos, tradiciones orales y, eventualmente, al olvido de su historia, \nsus conocimientos y su propia existencia; si sabemos lo que sabemos de las \nsociedades andinas hoy, es precisamente porque los espanioles se dieron el \ntrabajo de registrar todo lo que veian y las historias que les contaban, \npor escrito (de los aztecas, por ejemplo, sabemos mas porque tenian su \npopol vuh en que ellos mismos cuentan  sus tradiciones) Acerca de su \narquitectura, eso se llama neolitico (lo que sigue al paleolitico, o era de \nlas cavernas), y es un periodo que  el resto del mundo ya habia superado \nhacia no cientos, sino miles de anios; no me parece poco lo que hicieron \nsin la rueda, lo que no me parece es que lo siguieran haciendo en pleno \nsiglo XVI. Y nada mas extremista que decir que los incas no mentian, si \nexistieron esas famosas 3 leyes (no seas ladron, ocioso, mentiroso), es \nprecisamente porque habia gente que robaba,  que no trabajaba y gente que \nmentia... Tienes razon, con extremismos no llegamos a nada; pero somos \ndecendientes de esas culturas y tambien de los espanioles, y sin que estos \nnos conectaran al resto del mundo, no conocerias ni la computadora por la \nque me escribes, de hecho no podrias ni escribirme, sino que estariamos, \ntanto tu como yo, construyendo nuestras casas con barro, piedra y caca de \nllama (no es broma, esos eran los materiales de construccion en los andes \npara la gente ordinaria, fuera de la ciudadela imperial).

Carece de objetividad academica y no tiene conciencia de la \nrealidad del momento historico (esto es, que ya pasamos la era de los \nimperios microcefalos, los pequenios paises Europeos jamas volveran a estar \na cargo del mundo)   ... Pero tambien abunda mierda ultranacionalista en \nlas respuestas que hablan cojudeces de grandes civilizaciones precolombinas \nque los hibericos vinieron a destruir y explotar. Es cierto, vinieron y \nexplotaron los recursos y a los indios; pero tambien es cierto que esas \nculturas eran primitivas, vivian en el neolitico en pleno 1500, \nadoradoraban del sol, no conocian el acero, la escritura (en los andes) y \nni la rueda siquiera. Y la verdad es que, sin ese contacto con Europa que \nnos conectara al resto del mundo (y que lo mismo da si hubiese sido, \nEspania, Inglaterra, China o Portugal...de hecho, menos mal fue Espania, en \nninguno de los otros imperios hubo un Fray Bartolome de las Casas que \ndefendiera a los indios y ninguna otra corona se preocupo siquiera de \ndiscutir la legitimidad de su dominio, es decir, con cualquier  otro de los \nimperios de entonces, habriamos estado peor)   seguiriamos en ese estado. \nNo somos incas, ni aztecas, ni chapetones, somos hijos de la historia; de \nnada sirve guardar resentimientos idiotas ni renegar de la circunstancias \n(buenas y malas) que tuvieron lugar hace 500-200 anios y nos trajeron a lo \nque somos hoy.

Are all of those myths, false \naccusations and exaggerations? Is stealing land from it's original \ninhabitants different from conquering it? The Spanish Empire may have not \ncommitted genocide to the native populace but their arrival did spread the \nBlack Plague which killed entire tribes. I'm not saying that other \nEuropeans didn't spread the plague as well, all I'm saying is that it is \ncaused by European interactions. Cultures (except for tribes living in \ndense jungles and high mountains) are either completely forgotten or \nassimilated with Spanish culture so much so that they are unrecognizable. \nThis video series does not deny any of the atrocities the other nations you \nmentioned did. It is merely discussed in his other videos. This statement, \n\"In fact, those things where all done by british in North America...,\" \nsounds like you're claiming that the Spanish Empire never did any \natrocities. The Spanish, like any of the colonial powers, did a lot of \nhorrible things to the natives in their provinces (European interests \nalways came first before the natives, that is the trend of this era). If \nyou are familiar with the Spanish Black Legend then you should also be \nfamiliar with the Spanish White Legend.\n\nJust because this video showed the negative ramifications of the Spanish \nEmpire does not mean that this video is an anti-Spain propaganda.  John \nGreen is one of the most liberal historian in YouTube (you will notice that \nif you bothered to watch his U.S. History videos) he's anti-imperialism be \nit American, Spanish or British. Seriously, what would be the point of \nmaking an anti-Spain propaganda video? History in it's nature is biased and \nmost of the time governments are the ones that decide which history are \ngoing to be taught in schools not the Board of Education or that nation's \nequivalent of it. This is usually done in order to increase national pride \n(As an example, President Marcos, ruled the Philippines from 1965-1986, \nchanged so much of the Philippines' history that until today historians are \nstill figuring which are false and which are true all in the name of \nnational pride.).\n\nColonialism had a lot of negative effects for those that got afflicted by \nit but it also left a lot of positive ones. All European/American colonial \npowers did horrible things to their subjects none exempted from that. Of \ncourse, it is mostly because of certain individuals and their ambitions \nthat drove them to do some horrible things. In order to truly understand \nhistory as it is you must look at it not as a Spaniard nor as an American \n(or whatever nationality you are) but as a historian. ",

Think of the Mita system, under Inca rule, as a way to pay \ntaxes through physical labor and goods that are made by the Mita system are \ngiven back to the people (the Incas are a welfare people). If people did \ndie of exhaustion, then they must be too few or too far in between. But, in \nthe end, the Inca's used the Mita system for the benefit of its people \nwhile the Spanish used/exploited the Mita system for the wealth of Spain. ",

Andrew \nJackson told Martin Van Buren - \"The Bank Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill \nme, but I will kill it.[6].\"\nWhen Andrew Jackson was the President of US, British Journalist & \nPolitician William Cobbett published a biography of Andrew Jackson called \n\"The Life of Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, London: Mills, \nJowett, & Mills. 1834\" which pushed forward the lie that Andrew Jackson was \nkilling Jews and Native Indians just like Holohoax.\nOn the frontispiece of Cobbett's 1834 biography of Andrew Jackson, there is \na picture of an Indian Chief, hanging to a gibbet,his tomahawk, scalping \nknife and horn on the ground. On the otherside, a jew, suspended in like \nmanner, and a bank note of five dollars lying in the same manner as the \nmurderous, but less destructive instrument of savage [7].\nAndrew Jackson is often portrayed as cruel to the Native Indians by the \nmainstream media.\nBut it must be noted that Native Americans who sided with British was a \nthreat to Andrew Jackson.\nNative Americans were on the side of British (who controlled Second Bank \nthrough Jewish Rothschilds) who tried to kill Andrew Jackson when he was \nthe president as mentioned above. For Example, in the War of 1812 between \nthe U.S. and Britain, a faction of the Creek Indians sided with the British \nand fought against Andrew Jackson and his soldiers in the Battle of New \nOrleans. After the War of 1812, a faction of the Creek Indians known as the \nRed Sticks (because of the color of their war clubs) attacked Fort Mims in \nthe Mississippi Territory on August 30, 1813, killing between 300 and 400 \npeople. Andrew Jackson avenged the attack in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend \non March 27, 1814, when the Red Sticks were trapped and killed, ending the \nCreek War. Fugitive slaves and Seminole Indians joined together to fight \nAndrew Jackson's forces in the First Seminole War between 1817 and 1819.[8].\nIt must be noted that Andrew Jackson gave a generous offer to Native \nIndians, because Indians were unwilling to submit to the laws of the States \nand mingle with their population.\nIn his 1830 speech on Indian Removal, Andrew Jackson said \"Rightly \nconsidered, the policy of the General Government toward the red man is not \nonly liberal, but generous. He is unwilling to submit to the laws of the \nStates and mingle with their population. To save him from this alternative, \nor perhaps utter annihilation, the General Government kindly offers him a \nnew home, and proposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and \nsettlement [9].\"\n\nhttp://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson",

Many of the things you state are biased \ntowards your viewpont; by arguing, you are not going to accomplish anything \nbut a trade of insults.\n\n\n1. There is real, irrevocable proof (if you aren't convinced, go research) \nsuch as letters, journal entries, paintings, primary documents that all \nprove that the Aztecs and Incas were conquered.\n\n\n2.

The U.S. \nfight for independence is in the eighteenth century, about two-thousand \nyears from this current point in time being addressed in this video. Second \nof all, this is world history, not U.S. history.\nThe United States had no debt at the time. It was under England. The French \nwere the ones that helped the United States fight the U.K. Spain actually \nrefused to get involved; by staying neutral, it would not provoke anyone's \nanger. France were allies with the U.S. while Spain was not involved. I \nsuggest that you watch Crash Course U.S. history to keep your information \nstraight.\n\n\n3. John Green is attempting to summarize the history of the world in a way \nthat is easy to understand. He cannot possibly address every single event \nor said word in the history of the world. Of course he will leave out some \nthings that he will address later, like the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. In \nfact, John Green said, \"More on that later.\"\n\n\n4. John Green explains world history in a way that is easy to understand. \nNaturally, he draws from sources that must be somewhat reliable, as he is \nsharing this information with the general public of people all throughout \nthe world. He teaches about what he has been taught; although he has \ncharacter and is indeed American he has no outstated bias toward any party \nor against any group. John Green most likely has a different outlook on \nhistory than you. You shouldn't complain about how his viewpoint is \ndifferent. Not everyone will agree with someone's perspective.\n\n\nJohn Green has put forth much effort in making these videos for the \nbeneficence of others, and you should respect that. If you don't agree with \nhim, don't watch his videos.\n\n\nThank you, and I trust that you will not respond with an insult, as to do \nso would be highly ignominious of you.\n\n\nSource: PhD in History",

Unintentionally, the \nSpanish conquistadors Pizarro and Cortes killed many Inca and Aztecs, \nrespectively, through infection mainly by smallpox. Through the turmoil \nthat ensued, already following deaths within both hierarchies, the Spanish \nwere able to conquer both empires with relative ease. Although little is \nunderstood of Cortes' motivations, Pizarro's motivations can be directly \ntraced to the apparent wealth of the Inca.\n\nFinally, Spain was in fact a fair part of the American Revolutionary War on \nthe side of the colonies.

Significant technological developments would still be possible. How? \nThrough trade, limited industry, invention, serendipity, stuff that humans \nhave always had.\n\nThat's not to say that in such a universe we would have had the Internet by \nthe year 2000.\nNor is it to say that, given a few extra centuries to develop, the \nhypothetical world would become like ours, with millions or billions of \ndevices, burgers, department stores, and suburban sprawls, all acquired at \nthe cost of the health of the biosphere; indeed, such a world requires \necologically dangerous levels of industrialization and corporatism, which \nin the previous paragraph I banned.\n\nBut there could be computers, and whatnot.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your post, you remind us that the current, mostly \nWesternized world, despite all of its \"modern luxuries,\" is flawed. You \nmention that there's still exploitation and a lot of economic inequality, \nand I'd like to add unsustainability to the list.

People were 'chosen' to be \nsacrificed. It was considered BIG thing even in those times. So, why the \nsacrifices?\n\n1. Celebrations - Sacrifice prisoners of war after winning a war - The \nbasic mentality behind this was to curb the chances of a future rebellion \nand as a side-benefit, you appease you war gods! A noteworthy thing is this \nwas human sacrifice on MASS scale. Hundreds and thousands would be forced \nto jump into fire or whatever...\n\n2. Cultural Beliefs - Sacrifice the slaves with the corpse of their \nmasters. (With the mentality that they needed to serve them in afterlife as \nwell)\n\n3. Agricultural profits - This was mostly animal sacrifices to appease the \n'Rain-Gods'. Animal sacrifices were also common after the completion of big \nprojects as a sign and wish for good luck; like building of a bridge, \ntemple, etc.\n\n4. Getting an impossible task done as a desperate measure - Sacrifices made \nwhen the society feels completely helpless. eg. You want to win a war where \nyou know you have absolutely no chance! Such were the cases when the \nsociety would give away the best of everything they had. This was also the \nsituations when the most beautiful and virgin girls of the place were \nsacrificed to make the gods favour them instead of their enemies.\n\n5. Rebels - Well, this is simple; you preach against the religion or \nleader, the priest blames you for all the evil happening around, wants you \ndead! Although this was more like a punishment sacrifice but it's still a \nsacrifice as it is supposed to bring order in the region by pacifying god.\n\nThe people who were sacrificed weren't supposed to be 'terrorized'; they \nwere either considered objects (like slaves) or they were sacrificed for \nthe higher good of humanity (read as higher benefit of that particular \nsociety). The basic idea of human sacrifice was to appease the gods. And \nyou just cannot justify sacrificing the priests or the \"God's Messenger\" to \nappease him. Right?",

It's pathetic.\n\nYes, the British Empire committed many atrocities against people within the \nempire, the Dutch apparently also did so, as well as the Portuguese, yet \nsomehow because Crash Course has dared to make an episode specifically \nabout the Spanish Empire all of a sudden it's 'hate' and 'anti-Spanish \npropaganda'? The Spanish atrocities can be excused because there wasn't an \nequal focus on other countries? It's an episode devoted to Spain and its \nempire, of course the focus is going to be Spain itself.\n\nI'm also willing to bet that when the negative aspects of other nations \nhistories, the Dutch or the British for example, come up in later episodes, \nwe won't see the Spanish apologists leaping to their defence, it's only \nwhen Spain comes up that the \"outrage\" must begin because someone has dared \nto talk about Spanish history.\ufeff",

My ancestors were still just as affected by \nthe advent of colonialism as any might be. On the other hand, I'm also part \nBelgian, so my ancestry also perpetrated the worst example of colonialism \non Earth. These influences have lead me to have to look into what \ncolonialism actually meant and its factors whenever I try to look at my \nfamily line.\n\nTo call the Sicut Judaeis PR, however, betrays an ignorance of the Church's \ninner workings since the Bulls were met with great opposition, and was only \none of several over the course of the Middle Ages. The Bulls were often in \nresponse to the abuses of the Jewish people by the monarchies of Europe \n(who liked to borrow money from the Jews and then expel them) or the \npeasantry (who were, as far as history was concerned, usually monstrous).\n\nThe Church also historically opposed the treatment of the natives for most \nof its history - the friar with Cortez had been trying to get as many \nnatives spared as he could. This has historically been the truth. The \nChurch may have indeed been paternalistic to the Natives, which is indeed, \nnot right, but they were certainly never hostile or malicious towards them. \n(by the way, the old Pope was a duffer for saying what he did about the \nnatives).\n\nNow, we come to the new Pope, Pope Francis I. The thing about the Pope is \nthat it's a political office as much as it is a religious one. That means \nthat there are certain limitations on the Pope's power that don't appear on \npaper. The Pope's best chance is not to try and strongarm the conservative \nmembers of the Church because that will breed reactionary sentiment and \nmake it far, far worse when the next Pope comes. What Pope Francis I has to \ndo, and what he is doing, is sewing the seeds of a more liberal, tolerant \nChurch that will be determined by those who, inspired by Francis' words, \njoin the clergy and those who are of a more moderate sentiment being swayed \nto his position. He can't just undo all the doctrine in a day because that \nwouldn't work, it would just be immediately undone, and that's why I feel \nlike your criticism of Francis I is unfair.\n\nThe Church is, and always has been, an organisation of fundamentally good \nintentions. I was born into a more or less Atheist household and converted \ninto it because of the good I saw in it. I'm biased, I admit that. But on \nthat note, I don't think Atheism needs to stand in opposition to the Church \n- Atheists have found the evidence lacking and thus religion is not for \nthem. That is a perfectly fair stance to take and no one should begrudge \nthem for it, but they don't need to further define themselves by \nspecifically opposing the Church which has, historically, tried to be a \ngood thing.\n\nGo ahead and keep calling it out, though. So long as it's from a good \nconscience that it's done, then I can't fault you. To treat the Church as \ninfallible is a terrible thing and frankly, it needs good people to notice \nthe bad and say \"Hey, whatcha doing?\" if only to keep it honest, which it \nneeds given the power it has over so many people. I merely seek to defend \nit from what I see as unfair criticisms, not all of them are unfair, though.",
