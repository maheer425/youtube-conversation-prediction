While they are \ndefinitely defacing priceless history it is hard to ignore the significance \nof graffiti in Italy.  Italy is covered in graffiti.  They rarely remove it \nbecause it is considered a form of art by most Italians.  This form of art \nin Italian culture predates the Colosseum itself by several hundred years \neasily.  So \"When in Rome\" is a valid argument here to a certain degree. \n Anywhere you look on the stone of the Colosseum you will see peoples \ninitials carved.  My personal opinion is that these girls didn't make any \nkind of real art, and I doubt they knew much about the history of Roman \ngraffiti.  I would imagine these are the real reasons for their being \narrested more so than it being a general act of vandalism.  Because as I \nsaid, Italy has been vandalizing itself head to toe for thousands of years, \nand generally accepts or ignores it. \ufeff",
