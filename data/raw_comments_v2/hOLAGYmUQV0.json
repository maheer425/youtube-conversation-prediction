There were no galaxies, no \nplanets, no life. Deep, impenetrable darkness was everywhere, hydrogen \natoms in the void. Here and there denser accumulations of gas were \nimperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing - hydrogen \nraindrops more massive than suns. Within these globes of gas was first \nkindled the nuclear fire latent in matter. A first generation of stars was \nborn, flooding the Cosmos with light. There were in those times not yet any \nplanets to receive the light, no living creatures to admire the radiance of \nthe heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy of nuclear fusion \ncreated heavy elements, the ashes of hydrogen burning, the atomic building \n materials of future planets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted \ntheir stores of nuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned \nmost of their substance back into the thin gas from which they had once \ncondensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between the stars, new raindrops \nmade of many elements were forming, later generations of stars being born. \nNearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear \nfire, droplets in the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. \nAmong them was a small world of stone and iron, the early Earth.\n\nCongealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water and \nhydrogen gases that had been trapped within, forming the primitive \natmosphere and the first oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed \nthe primeval Earth, drove storms, generated lightning and thunder. \nVolcanoes overflowed with lava. These processes disrupted molecules of the \nprimitive atmosphere; the fragments fell back together again into more and \nmore complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the \nseas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were \norganized, and complex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. \nAnd one day a molecule arose that quite by accident was able to make crude \ncopies of itself out of the other molecules in the broth. As time passed, \nmore elaborate and more accurate self-replicating molecules  arose. Those \ncombinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve \nof natural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And \nthe primitive oceanic broth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and \ntransformed into complex condensations of self-replicating organic \nmolecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had begun. \n\nSingle-celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food. \nPhotosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once \nfree-living forms banded together to make a complex cell with specialized \nfunctions. Chemical receptors evolved, and the Cosmos could taste and \nsmell. One-celled organisms evolved into multicellular colonies, \nelaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes and \nears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals \ndiscovered that the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, \nscuttled, lumbered, glided, flapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal \nbeasts thundered through the steaming jungles. Small creatures emerged, \nborn live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with a  fluid like the \nearly oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness and \ncunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered \ndown from the trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of \ntools, domesticated other animals, plants and fire, and devised language. \nThe ash of stellar alchemy was now emerging into consciousness. At an \never-accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, art and science, and \nsent spaceships to the planets and the stars. These are some of the things \nthat hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution.\"",
