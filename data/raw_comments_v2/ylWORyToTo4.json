How can ancient korean be chinese king, because korea is far \naway? According to archeological researches and many old chinese history \nbooks, chinese great wall or some area near chinese great wall was the \nborder between china and ancient korea[old \u671d\u9bae]. That is why it was possible \nthat ancient koreans crossed the border easily and made dynasties in china. \nJust look at chinese great wall in chinese map. It is almost in the middle \nof china.
