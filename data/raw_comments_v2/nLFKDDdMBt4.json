We are processes. \n Whatever solid identity you think you have is just a snapshot of a \ntemporary arrangement of vibrating energies, a rolling subset of everything \naround you and passing through you.  Ultimately, of course, everything is \ninformation-energy exchange; or, more immediately if you still insist on \nthinking of matter as made up of \"things\":  \"We are star-stuff\" (C. Sagan) \nor \"We are literally stardust\" (Neil deGrasse Tyson).\n\nHydrogen literally formed out of pure energy in the early universe.  All \nthe rest of the atoms in our bodies were made by quantum-tunneling and \nnuclear fusion in the heart of a star.  You are a living supernova \nincarnate!

            "text": "+SciShow Before I even begin to look at the comments here, which I am \ncurious about for several reasons, I want to mention something I was \nsurprised you didn't bring up at all, as I am guessing it is probably why \nthe question was asked. That is, the question of being partially \n\"genetically nacho\", whatever exactly that would mean. You see, I recall a \ndebate years ago in which a theist argued that a cloud missed being a \nwatermelon by 3%. The argument was of course a comparison to the \napproximate percentage of DNA sequence matching between the human genome \nand the chimpanzee genome.\n\nFact is, there is no DNA sequence for growing a cloud, so in that sense it \nmissed being a watermelon by 100%. The argument stated as a premise that a \nwatermelon was 97% water and a cloud was 100% water, but of course we know \nthat a cloud is not 100% water, and a chimpanzee is made of the same basic \nchemistry as humans are, as is a plate of nachos. Well, not the plate... \nbut the nachos. So one could argue that no matter whether you eat nothing \nbut nachos your whole life or no nachos at all in your whole life, you are \n100% nachos by that definition. It's simply a bad definition, because as \nyou pointed out, nobody in their right mind is going to call a bunch of \norganic mush nachos regardless if it used to be. think anyone \n\nOf course, if a cloud has any DNA in it, which probably every NATURAL cloud \nin Earth's sky does, it is incidental and would not stop the cloud from \nbeing a cloud if it was removed. Likewise, if there were a way to remove \nall the DNA from a plate of nachos without otherwise changing anything else \nabout them, while the result would be slightly less nutritious, I don't \nthink anyone sane would try to argue that the result was no longer \nnachos... although people who knew the procedure had been done may be \nhesitant to eat them.\n\nAlso, in the case of the claim about the cloud having missed being a \nwatermelon by 3%, I propose the following mental experiment to check the \nvalidity of the statement. Imagine a cloud in the sky having 3% of its \nwater removed. Would that make it a watermelon? If the only thing keeping \nit from being a watermelon is that the watermelon had 3% less water, it \nshould. What if you tried it with a bucket of pure water that weighed the \nexact same amount as a watermelon after 3% of its water was removed. Would \nthat make it a watermelon? Of course not. What if you removed 3% of the \nwater from a cloud or from a bucket of water and replaced it with an equal \nweight of something else... like for example watermelon cells... would it \nbe a watermelon then? Obviously not... although if you did it with pure \nwater and added watermelon seeds, the genome contained in the mixture would \nbe 100% watermelon genome... but the water itself would still just be \nwater.\ufeff",
