The scene was an \nemotional scene. Were you blown away from The Matrix? It was fake! It was \nCGI. But did you walk away thinking that it was fake and shout out on the \n\"Internets\". You walk away taking the emotion bestowed on you. Not that it \nwas fake, but that it touched a part of your soul that the \ndirector\\screenwriter\\whoever wanted you to bestow. It's hollywood...... \ntake it for what it is. If producers,writers, directors weren't using their \ncreativity, then you'd be less entertained as Russell Crowe, or Maximums \nwould say, \" Are you not entertained?!\" Think that actually happened? \nNo...but were you not entertained?
