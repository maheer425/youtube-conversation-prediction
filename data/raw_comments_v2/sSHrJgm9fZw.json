These are literally \nlittle sculpture that you wear and could follow you all your life or even \npass down to other people.\n     Sometimes it's just a stone in metal, not that artistic but the stones \nthemselves can be amazing.The diamond industry is horrible for so many \nreasons, plus diamonds are a little boring.\n     But you have other stones like alexandrite which changes color \ndepending on the type of light shining on it, raw tormaline crystals it's \nshapes and colors, moss agate's intricate patterns.To me it's amazing that \nsuch beautiful things exist in nature!\n\nI'm not saying you should want to buy expensive jewelry. People don't go to \nthe museum to buy art. I just want more people to think that jewelry can be \nart.\n\nSorry for the long comment, hope my english is easy to understand :s ",
