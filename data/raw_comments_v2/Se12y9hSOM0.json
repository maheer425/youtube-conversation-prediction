For example, the inevitable mixing of different types of plastics in \ncontemporary recycling is ultimately the cause of  lower quality plastics \nbeing produced, yet you frame bottling companies for it without citing \nscholarly articles or studies again. Seriously what even is water taste \ntesting. It's just water, when was this 'study' taken? what was the sample \nsize? you're just pulling (possibly) fake studies out of a hat to try and \nmake a point. Then you're also injecting personal opinion into your script, \nwhich is also a big no no. Don't believe everything you see on the \ninternet, just saying.\ufeff",

            "text": "Yeah, but things have changed. That ruptured nuclear plant in Japan is \nletting loose radiation across America and water accumulates it. The more \nwater travels over land in streams and rivers the more it accumulates. Even \njust sitting in lakes it is accumulating what is from the fallout. As it \ntravels over land as rain run off it is picking up that radiation that has \naccumulated on top of the ground.\nYou're bathing in it, washing your clothes and dishes in it, Do you want to \ndrink it too and really get a dose internally?\nThere are couple of ways around this problem. One is to move to a very high \naltitude and thus you are dealing with water that has traveled the least \namount of distance. The other way is to drink only mountain spring water, \nthat hasn't been above ground for thousands of years.\nBut here is a problem with bottled water. Nestle's owns Arrowhead Spring \nwater and there own brand name bottled spring water and Nestles is a Swiss \ncompany. The are bottling a lot here in Calif were there is an extreme \ndrought that experts are saying is going to last for many years and some \nare saying that it won't ever end, and that we need all we can get here in \nCalifornia. Nestles bottles it and ships it out of State and at a rate of \nhundred of thousands of gallons everyday\nThe CEO of Nestles recently stated that people do not have an inherent \nright to water.\nThat is presently true in Calif. because we are presently under \"English \nlaw\". Calif was under Spanish law when it was a part of Mexico and Spanish \nlaw says that every one has a right to fresh water even if it is own \nprivate property, But they can't bottle it as much as they want and then \nsell it.\nCrystal Geyser is wholly owned by the Japanese. \nCurrently about 1/7th of the United States is owned by foreigners and I'm \ntalking about land area here people and that includes its mineral rights \nand all other natural resources too.\nThe gov't run by the fat cats, start a war or try to repel an invasion but \nit's the middle class and the poor whose kids are sent off to fight it \nbecause we aren't going to let some foreign power take over. After the \nthreat is defeated, they then turn around and sell it to them from right \nunder our feet.\nWhat is wrong with this picture people?\nStop the selling out of America, nationalize all land holdings and mineral \nrights now.\nDrink spring water or move to a high altitude.\nStop foreign companies from bottling our water and selling it elsewhere, we \nneed every last drop we Californians have here in California and especially \nnow that the drought is predicted to last a very ling, long, time.\nThe feds aren't telling you about the radioactive fallout that the broken \nnuclear plant in Japan is dumping on us here in the States because they \ndon't want to deal with a panic. Everyone in California best get and stash \nenough bottled mountain spring water to last them six to eight weeks, \ncanned goods and any medications they need too as for reason it will only \nget worse and worse and the guys cleaning up the mess in Japan hardly have \na clue as what to do to clean up the mess in Fukushima\nGet wise.\ufeff",
