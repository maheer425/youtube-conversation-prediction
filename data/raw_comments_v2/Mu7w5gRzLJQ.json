It took a medical scanner to find the \ngland in *2009*.   \n\nWalter Auffenberg was the guy who started the bacteria myth in *1981* \n(without any data beyond observation that somehow the animals komodo \ndragons bite died and to his knowledge the creature had no venom). Mind you \nhe only threw a hypothesis out there and can't be blamed for the statement \nto be taken as fact without proper testing.\n\nNo virulent species of bacteria *that isn't found in any other carnivore's \nmouth* was found when it was actually tested (they actually had less than a \nmammalian carnivore). The bacteria that where deadly could be found in the \nmouth of any other carnivore and the study that had attempted to prove the \nbacteria hypothesis was flawed and got a likely false positive result in \n*2002* (and they only tested dragons for the bacteria at the time).  \n\nAlso keep in mind that if the Komodo dragon can get such deadly bacteria \nbecause of the nature of its teeth and diet wouldn't many monitor lizards \nhave the same ability (especially since the komodo dragon has no special \nadaptations to encourage the bacteria that its cousins don't have).\nYet the nature of the discovered venom matches what would be needed for the \ntask of hunting large mammals (deer or smaller specifically, native prey \nanimals where the wound's comparative size along with the effects of the \nvenom work in conjunction quickly) in its own right while those monitor \nlizard that lack the ability of that deadly bite have a much weaker venom \nor none at all depending on the species. Seems rather obvious in hindsight \nthat the venom is far more important than any bacteria found in the mouth \nof a meat eating lizard. Bacteria in the environment (mainly the filthy \nwater) and the dragon's mouth do help with things like buffalo (who run to \nthe filthy water and wallow after being bit on average) but only because \nthey would do the same thing to any such wounds from any carnivore \n(especially one who's venom will not let it heal as quickly as it could \notherwise).",

However, I haven't seen \nanything that indicates how much venom is secreted in a dragon bite. So, I \ncan understand them mentioning the venom, as it most likely is important to \nthe success of a dragon bite taking down prey.\n\nHowever, dragons also, as you mentioned, have up to 57 different strands of \nbacteria in their saliva, some of which are associated with sepsis. And \nwhile dragons are known to keep their mouths relatively clean (they \nactually try to remove any food debris from their mouths, for example), \nthey still have these bacteria growing in their mouths.\n\nI'm not an expert, and I have no intention of spending hours looking for \nstudies and info on this matter, but mentioning one of these systems and \nnot the other, especially when one system isn't even completely understood, \nshows little actual research and is poor reporting. My best guess is that \nthe venom is used to incapacitate or otherwise weaken the immune system of \nprey, while the bacteria use the opportunity to finish them off. However, \nwithout actual evidence or studies to go off of, this is only conjecture, \nwhich is why it boggles my mind that they used info from a single study \n(which simply proves the existence of venom and not the potency of amount \nused) as absolute fact, when we actually don't know the exact reason for \nthe effectiveness of a Komodo bite.\n\nAt the very least, both the bacteria and the venom should be mentioned, but \nit should have been mentioned that it's still unclear how effective each of \nthese systems is considering that they work in tandem. it's clearly not the \nbacteria doing all the work, and we don't know exactly how the venom \ncontributes, because as I already mentioned, there's nothing indicating the \namount of venom injected nor is there knowledge of exactly how potent the \nvenom is. Therefore, the safest statement would have been to say that both \nare dangerous and both are responsible for the potency of a Komodo's bite.",
