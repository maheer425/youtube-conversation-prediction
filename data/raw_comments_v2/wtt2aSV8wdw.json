Giving the government the \npower to regulate the internet is not a good thing does anyone think that \ngiving the government the power to regulate the net to be a good thing? \nJust look what Obama was able to accomplish with the IRS he used the IRS to \nprevent conservative groups from obtaining tax free status. the fact is if \nthey have to expand the bandwidth, that money has to come from those who \npay for their services, i.e you and me and everyone currently paying for \ninternet services, second if they are forced to provide the same services \nto everyone then they will have to charge everyone the same price. meaning \nthose currently paying a premium price will no longer pay a premium price \ngiven that doing so will not provide them with better service, and to make \nup for the loss of all those paying a premium price everyone will be forced \nto pay a higher price for their services. Example say you have 10 paying \nfor internet service. 5 pay $50/month 3 pay $200/month and 2 pay $500/month \nso $1850 total between the 10 people so for everyone to receive and equal \namount of service each person would have to pay $185 per month while the \ntop 5 would receive less band with. Now to increase the number of lanes you \nwould have to raise that now $185/month per person even higher to cover the \ncost of the new increased bandwidth, either through upgrades of servers, \nrouters, or physical lines such as cable or fiber optic.  \ufeff",
