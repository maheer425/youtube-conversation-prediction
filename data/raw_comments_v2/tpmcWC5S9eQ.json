Cruz is \ndeliberately advancing a position to defund ACA that only 25% support. \nThat's hardly \"noboby wants it\".\n\nOther outrageous Cruz lies:\n\n> insurance will be more costly. Not so. Premiums are much lower making it \naffordable to millions who could not afford it before. Already because of \nthe ACA, premium rebates (amounting to billions) for obscene portions of \npremium dollars that were scalped off for sales, marketing, and lobbying \nCongress, have been returned to insurance holders by the industry.\n> quality of healthcare will deteriorate. The quality of US healthcare is \nalready ranked 38th in the world and 50 million go without.\n> other universal healthcare systems are failing. Not so at all. All people \nare covered and per capita healthcare costs are half US rates, and service \nquality is deemed much higher than the US.\n\nThis kind of deliberate mis-information skulduggery is evil, and dangerous.\ufeff",
