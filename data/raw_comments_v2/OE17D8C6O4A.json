PMCs in Afghanistan are at \nmost 20,000 but now thesedays the Afghanistan military is the largest now \nat 352,000 now these days from what I can find but some sources vary show \nwe have 18-20,000 35,000 or 60,000 as far as we know from 2014-15. But any \ndata that I'm finding base on what they were showing 62% doesn't seem to be \nable to found for a few hours couldn't find a damn thing not sure if I have \nbad luck or is this data a lie. Sure in the 21 century right now we are at \na all time high after 9/11 but in reality PMC are still a minority in \nwarfare. \n\n2) Now it may seem uncomfortable when the idea of a PMC business turns on \nyou but that would be very bad for their business if no one who has money \ncan pay that company off. If You pay a group of guys that fought with you \nnow and now turns on you there's a risk that the person isn't giving you a \nenough money for your guys and company as a whole that could run you out of \nbusiness, along with the respect for that nation and military you turn on \nmay have a hard long time taking you back. Plus no PMC group can take on a \nworld power or a very strong nation both in terms of quality and quantity \nat most it would have to be with the weaker boys on the street and that \nalone too won't be easy let alone the response it will get globally.\n\n3) Although it is true that PMCs aren't very regulated in some ares but in \nother areas they are and some are base on morals and common sense not like \nthat good enough but however it has work. Even PMCs themselves support the \nidea of rules for companies like this to follow.\n\n4) I found the first 30 seconds to be a rather fuck you to soldiers, \nleaders and nations everywhere as painting it as we fight wars because of \njust money while in reality wars are fought over many other things much \nmore needed. Soldiers are ether drafted or freely join on their own will \nknowing what could happen to them.\n  \ufeff",
