And since most people lack \nthe space for an orchard, grafting several fruits onto the same tree seems \nlike a great idea.",

Grafting works, 40 seems extreme but 5 to ten seems like it \nwould work. the reason you do not just plant a tree from the woods, or even \nstart from seed, is the pollination factor. most trees at orchards come \nfrom one parent cutting, a clone, and that variety is then cut and cloned/ \nrooted again and again and again. that is how you get a constant true \nvariety every year and in many places. No telling what the taste and \ntexture will be from the seed. Now this is not a bad thing either because \nnew varieties or old ones can be renewed if you know the order of \npollination to achieve the desired end product, pending on if the dominant \nand recessive genes all hook up right, a huge if. But ta say you cannot \nfind the best apple from a pollination experiment is not possible is false, \nbut  def unless controlled you will never know how it happened.
