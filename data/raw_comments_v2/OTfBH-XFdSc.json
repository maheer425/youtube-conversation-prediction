Not too hard to follow even if you weren't \nfamiliar with the Star Trek universe which is nice but it also had \nreferences for those who can pick them out. The characters were nicely \nchosen and easy recognizable due to traits and similar features, it's easy \nto tell that they really worked hard to find actors who worked... And it \ndid. I felt attached to many of the characters on screen, for better or \nworse. It may seem I'm praising this movie very highly and I apologize but \nwhile I understand it wasn't the best, I can hardly say it was the worse. \n\nThe only unredeeming feature and complaint I have is the lense flares. Most \nof the time they were HIGHLY unnecessary. If they were just in combat and \naction scenes, hey, I could understand but they were everywhere. A \ncharacter would be talking and then, everything would go white and it would \nbe hard to see what was happening for a few seconds as your eyes tried to \nadjust. It was like the person in charge of that part of the effects team \nknew they were getting fired and just decided 'fuck it. I don't even care \nanymore.'\n\nOverall: It's not a movie I would recommend for those who are easy \ntriggered by sudden lights or have epilepsy. I had to pause the movie a bit \nto take a break, that's how crazy it got. But other then that, it was an \nenjoyable experience and it's now happily on my dvd shelf now.\ufeff",
