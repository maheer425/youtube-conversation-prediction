It doesn't really hurt when you get period. You just \nhappen to have slight pains in your stomach like stomach aches and Mood \nSwings may occur. So you may be a bit moody around friends and family. You \nmight also want to stay away from boys as doctors say there's a slight \nchance of getting pregnant. You can still play with them but you may wanna \nkeep you distance. Also, when you have period, you can feel water dripping \nfrom your... *cough cough*. You know what I'm saying? Just letting you know \nso you won't be scared when getting period.\n\nAnd one last thing. If you are big in size, you may get period around 10-11 \nyears old. If your smaller, it may happen when you're 12-13. Most people \nget period by that age of 11. That's all.\ufeff",
