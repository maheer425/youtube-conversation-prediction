On this point, your comment \nseems like the asinine one since you completely missed the point of the \nstatement of which you responded to...if there is take-off then judge \nlanding...it is that simple.  Also, if you have to get rescued from K2 or \nanother remote peak then you shouldn't get credit for a summit even if you \nmade it to the top.  Coming back down can sometimes be the most difficult \npart.  If you climb a tough rock route, fall on rope and then recover from \nthe point in which you fell, then you shouldn't get credit for climbing \nthat route.  A successful climb should only be counted if the climber never \nfalls on the route or has to use the assistance of a rope to complete a \nroute.
