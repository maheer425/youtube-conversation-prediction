Is just their personality \nmatches so perfect with the number's meaning.\n\nFor example, me as a number 3 I can NEVER get along with a personality 2. \nThat is my enemy XD Instead I get perfectly along with other 3s, 9s, 7s.\n\nMost people I know go into numbers 1 to 9. There is only one person I ever \nmet that is actually a 0 personality. But that is the ONLY ever person to \nbe a 0.\n\nIf I choose something(quiz / opportunity/ intership on the list/whatever) \nif I choose a 3, then that is the best option for me. There were times when \nI experiment and try to choose other numbers and see what happens, and 2 \nalways brings me the most awful choice from the list.\n1,4,5 are neither good, nor bad. They are neutral for me.\n\nFor example personality 8: goes along well with 2, 4, 7.
