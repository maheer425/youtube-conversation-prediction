In fact, I've read that he was asked straight out about it and \nresponded by saying no, it's just a children's story. However, the story is \na very close representation. Like, too much to be coincidence. I was \nwondering what your opinion was, as an author. I know that once everything \nis said and done, books belong to their readers, but do you 1)subscribe to \nthe interpretation of TWWoO as a metaphor for populism and the Gilded Age, \n2)do you believe LFB really did just write it as a children's story or was \nhe simply saying that so as not to attract criticism from his \ncontemporaries, and 3)is it possible to project our own  interpretations \nonto a story to the extent that we could potentially bastardize an author's \nintention? -Kellen\ufeff",
