What he said was that the \ncold virus occurs more often during the winter because you spend more time \ninside with other people that might have it. In fact, your point only helps \nto emphasize this even more; it's the sudden change from cold to warm when \nyou go inside that helps you contract the virus more easily. You also have \na chance of getting it if you hang around a lot of people when you go \noutside, but it's generally easier for a virus to get you inside because of \nthe amount of things people physically handle in their homes.\n\nSecond, he might have exaggerated a bit by mentioning the gold medal, but \nhe did cover the fact that you shouldn't go for a long or intense session \nof swimming after a meal. While it's fair to criticize him for not being a \nbit more clear about this, it should also be easy to follow his train of \nthought and assume that it's not going to cause you much physical \ndiscomfort to get in a pool and just chill after a big meal.
