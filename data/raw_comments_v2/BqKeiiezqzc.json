One of the \nseveral questions that I have is in the theory drawing there are poles of \nmagnet shown however when actually experimenting on diamagnetic stuff only \none magnet is showing effect. I thought the diamagnetic stuff should be \nplaced between two magnets, when I saw theory drawing. However as I am not \nscientist I must be missing something.\ufeff",

The \ndiamagnetic material just needs magnetic field lines to lie across, which \nexist near one magnet's pole or between two (and really there is basically \nalways a magnetic field of some strength present, even if it's very weak). \nThe only difference is that with \"one\" magnet the field lines \"start\" on \nthe north pole and loop around to \"end\" on the south pole of the same \nmagnet, whereas between two magnets, the field lines that \"start\" on the \nnorth end of one \"end\" on the south end of the other. The field lines \nthemselves, however, interact with materials the same way regardless of how \nthey are \"made\". Is that helpful?",
