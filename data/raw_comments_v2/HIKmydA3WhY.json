            "text": "+George Ven Hi George,  I agree this boat is stunning, as are the other \ntwo, I presume you have seen the pictures.  I have to beg to differ though \n- the Abattes were made with BMW's involvement and as I mentioned, BMW took \nthese two Abatte boats around Europe showcasing their wares.  Funnily, I \nhave also heard from BMW Classic about the Abatte boats and their \ninvolvement, so I suppose it's down to who you talk to.  I remember when I \nfirst heard the story about the first Abatte 507 boat, that was the only \none that existed and now we have three :-).  Like you, I found these boats \nreally very interesting, but my research was a long time ago and while the \nAbatte boats do not have the side grills, they do have many of the other \nthings you mention, including 507 clocks, tool kits etc.  At the end of the \nday, they are all very special boats and I am sure the owners know what \nthey have. \n\nYou are correct, most of the lovely 401/507 boat engines made went to \nindustrial use or as I heard, a few went into cars - with the necessary \nchanges of course.  I never have been really able to find out exactly how \nmany were made, although 80 - 85 seems to be the considered answer, but of \nthat sum only 3 were used for these wooden boats and I understand one went \ninto an Italian fishing boat - pretty interesting fisherman I am sure:-) ",

I spoke with the staff of the guys of BMW Classic department \nthere and they said this is the only one specially built for BMW AG.\nIndeed the 507 boat reference because on top of the V8 marine engine, the \nhull was also built with the steering wheel, radio and instruments and of \nthe 507... ohhh and the famous side grills!  \nI have made a hobby of learning about this lovely artifact since I saw it \nand no doubt this was a oneoff have prototype to test the V8 marine \nengines. Sadly some marine engines were converted to industrial engines and \nothers found their way into motor cars.      \nI understood that the Abatte boats  were build on behalf of private \nparties, even though they share the same engine, but not the accessories \nfrom the 507.\nI myself have a Fletcher BMW powered boat, its nothing that special but \nalso part of the amazing BMW Marine history!",
