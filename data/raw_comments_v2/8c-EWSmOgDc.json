For those of you who are unfamiliar, The Gonadal \nBody type is a  pear-shaped female, with curvy rear and slender upper \nbody. My birthday is coming up this April and I want a new body. I've \nalways wanted to be shaped like an Amazon: thick thighs, big booty and tiny \nwaistline, slender arms. I want the universal feminine physique:  The \nclassic Hip To Waist ratio of Fertility. I want the body of an Advanced \nEstrogenic Feminine Fertility Goddess. My physical Somatotype is a Female \nMesomorph (Adrenal- Apple Body) with broad shoulders and thick shoulder \nblades, included is a bloated hard belly with no hips. During puberty, I \nhad extreme stress and negativity. Consequently my Estrogen was suppressed \nwith the physiological stress responses-> Cortisol and Adrenaline, which \nhave put my womanly body to a complete halt. Don't get me wrong, my body \nmanaged to make enough Estrogen for Boobs but not enough to distribute to \nthe Booty and Hips lol. Periodically, throughout the month, I have these \nmini spikes in the \"Good\" Estrogen. However, depending on my diet and \nstress levels, my Butt increases in volume but STILL its too firm and hard \nlike a guy's ass. I want my Ass Soft, Jiggly and Teardropped NOT firm and \nsquare. In a nutshell, I strongly desire a slender upper body, narrow \nwaistline, curvier hips and soft glutes. Thanks Michio Kaku for any advice. \nThose of you who have advice or comments please gladly share with me. Love \nyou all . Happy New Year!!\ufeff",

For example,...the atmosphere contained a lot more oxygen then \ntoday, wich is one of the reasons why they could grow that big. With all \nthe polution we humans are pumping into the atmosphere, dinosaurs would not \nsurvive. Besides that...they've had their time, dinosaurs roamed the earth \nfor a period of about 150 million years, and i don't see us humans repeat \nthat piece of art.

So we can't say or predict that they were dumb as \nbirds, and why would they be, because they lived a far more time away ? \nThey lived more time than all of us, or any other animals (not includes \nreptiles such as crocodiles), time does not make you more inteligent.\n\nSo to me Dinosaurs were really smart, and if they would not have died, \ntoday i bet they would rule the world and be an inteligent race.",

Which would \nbe weird to be quite frank.\n\nNow, you talk about T-rex because all you knwo about him, is what you've \nseen in jurassik park or other movies, who makes him look deadly and \npowerful, and an eat-meat machine.\n\nSo for example look at lions now, they are quite the T-rex of today, but \nsome humans has made them not agressive, and they play with them, because i \nthink they feed them well, so perhaps if we do the same with a T-rex, he \nwould react the same, as soon as you don't forget to feed him with a cow \nevery 12 hours, you would be fine :)\n\nNow i really hope we are going to make a dinosaurs soon, and show it to the \nworld, but not in the Epigenetics method, but more with finding a DNA of a \ndinosaur, in their fossile bones, or soft tissues, and right there my \nfriend, would be a real dinosaur.\n\nMe too i want my pic with my T-rex.",
