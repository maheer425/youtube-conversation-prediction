Not just because this artist isn't that popular, I \nthink Big Bang should of done the same thing with 'Blue' too. Don't give \nthe western world anymore credit then they deserve. Use Koreans and push \nthe Korean music industry brand to a height where it can stand on it's own \ntwo feed without direction and/or appreciation from the U.S. \n\nThe song is really nice, though.
