Overpriced \nsugar was the only way for slavery to show a profit because slavery is a \ngrossly inefficient of doing things that requires large profit margins in \norder to support it. Likely the British would have kept slavery or at least \nexempted the colonies had they still a big income flowing from it. If not \nfor the invention of the cotton gin which once again made it marginally \nprofitable slavery probably would have gone away in the USAlund at the same \ntime as it did in England. Notably cotton prices were also starting to drop \n(due to increased Egyptian and Indian cotton production) at the time of the \nUSAlund \"Civil War\" making it likely slavery would have died at about the \nsame time no matter what as evidenced by the Confederate \"government\" \nbanning import of further slaves even before that war started.\nAnother note that while the victory in the seven years war was a major \ncause for the colonial rebellion you don't mention the anti-piracy and \nanti-smuggling patrols that the British fleet was thereafter turned to. \nColonialists couldn't reliably get decent manufactured goods from England \nat a reasonable price, were not allowed to manufacture their own goods, \nwere forced to do business exclusively with the English, couldn't sue \nEnglish companies in English courts when they failed to deliver, and \ncouldn't compel English companies to appear before colonial courts. This \nmade smuggling a lifeline for basic necessities like plows and shovels and \nwhen that was put under pressure a legal separation of the two bodies was \ninevitable.\nOther contributing factors often overlooked include all those rebellious \nScotts exiled to the colonies in the 1760s and fundamental religious \ndifferences held by the many dissenter colonists.\ufeff",

I've read several books and academic essays on \nBritish abolition and a smaller amount on Emancipation and I can tell you \nthat there is a lot of economic data suggesting slavery was becoming more \nprofitable when it was banned by Britain. According to the book 'Econocide' \nby Seymour Drescher this is the case. That being said Britain by the \nbeginning of the 19th century was beginning to invest more heavily in India \nwhere sugar could also be produced very cheaply (but without slavery) and \nwhere there was seemingly endless supply of land for agriculture, as \nopposed to Britain's smaller sugar producing islands. \n\nBritain probably outlawed slavery for multiple reasons. Slave rebellions \nrepresented a significant risk to slave owners and made slave plantations \nseem an unstable place to invest money. Soil erosion was taking its toll in \nthe West Indies making the slave industry less viable in the long term. \nBritain's overseas markets where expanding extremely quickly due to the \ngrowth of the Empire, this meant that slavery formed a smaller component of \nBritain's rapidly developing economic system.",

Unlike in Britain where it was business leaders trying to \nextract themselves from a dying industry to protect their bottom lines \nwhile not sacrificing a competitive edge - basically it was an agreement \nfor them to all get out at once. My point being that pure reason is often \njust rationalization of short sighted self interests and a supreme abstract \nmoral authority can be very useful in pointing out that sort of hypocrisy, \naka religion doesn't exist because of superstition, it exists because it is \nuseful to society that it exists. Yes, I'm calling out the \"Enlightenment\" \nas being the main driver for not only slavery's persistence but also for it \nbeing re-instituted by the British in the first place. The Church of \nEngland's support of slavery doesn't count because that was a government \nrun church, aka a government entity like the DOT. I also call out \ntranscendentalism for keeping the USAlund \"Civil War\" going for as long as \nit did but that's another topic altogether.",
