Some people criticized her for this, but the origins \nbehind the name are beautiful. I think that both of their names are \nbeautiful.\n\nThough, I agree with Hank in that you should be very careful when you name \nyour child. Choose something unique, but not TOO unique.\n\nAlso, if anyone here is a LIGHTS fan, I would love to hear. She's awesome \nand the rest of you should listen to her.
