Mass gets pulled outwards by centrifugal \nforce and mass gets pulled inwards by the rest of the object's mass.\n\nIf there is a strong gravitational pull from the outside, the shape of the \nobject will start to bend. Basically, the combination of inertia and \ngravity will cause the atoms to be pulled away from the center even \nfurther, but they will be pulled back in, once the rotation of the object \ndraws them away from the source of gravity. That's basically, what the tide \ndoes. As the whole object gets pulled by the outside source, there will \nalso be a part, where the gravity pull from the outside source will be the \nweakest. The place, which is the farthest away from the source. As the rest \nof the object gets pulled stronger, this part will also bulge outside by \nvirtue of not being pulled towards the gravity source as strong. As the \ncentrifugal force is only dependant on the distance to the center of the \nrotating object, the part with the lowest gravitational pull will bulge \nfurther away from the source, than the part slightly closer to it.\n\nNow, what happens, when the object disintegrates, is, that the gravity, \nwhich upheld its shape isn't strong enough anymore to hold it together. As \npieces drift apart, there will be less and less mass situated close to the \nfar side of the object. That part of the object will have less and less \ngravitational force pulling it towards the rest of the object, as those \nparts drift away and there is no single object to speak of anymore. This \nwill cause the whole object to fall apart, as the fragments will move \noutwads due to their inertia(or centrifugal force, which is a horrible word \nand shouldn't be used, when talking about proper physics, but I went ahead \nand did it anyway)\n\nThis whole thing only works for rotating objects(if they didn't rotate, \nthey would collide way too fast for any disintegration of the objects to \nmatter anyway) and whether fragments are thrown away from the source of \ngravity or everything gets sucked in depends entirely on how fast the \nrotation was and how strong the gravitational pull is.",

Never heard of heat-attraction \nstrong enough to pull stuff around by the way but I don't know everything. \nSo, obviously, tides are caused by the gravitational force of the moon and \nthe sun. The water won't ever leave earth though, since it's closest to it \nand gravitational pull, as we know, depends not only on the mass but also \non the distance between the objects pulled together.Still, the water tends \nto gather on earth's area that's closest to the moon and also to the sun, \nalthough the sun's influence is only about half as big as the moon's \nbecause it's so far away. That's also, why we have spring tide and dead \ntide. Depending on the positioning of the sun and the moon, their \ngravitational pulls add up or cancel each other out. As for that confusing \ntide on earth's area furthest from the moon, that is caused by the shifting \nof the terrestrial orbit through the moon's attraction. It's not just the \nmoon orbiting around earth and earth orbiting around the sun, since for \nevery force, there's an anti force. However, because force depends on the \nmass of an object, the same force won't have the same effect on every \nobject. So, the sun's acceleration because of earth's gravitational pull is \nridiculously small and earth's acceleration because the moon's \ngravitational pull is relatively small. We can't neglect it, though, at \nleast in the case of the moon. That's where centrifugal force comes into \nplay. Because there's a slight movement of earth towards the moon, after \nthe moon has circled around earth once, earth has moved in a small circle \nas well. The water (and the earth) furthest away from the centre of said \ncircle receives the strongest pull. Compare it to a fast spinning \ncarrousel. If you're on that carrousel and you stick your hand out, you can \nfeel it being pulled away strongly and you can feel your blood rushing into \nits fingertips. That's the common answer for the bilateral tides on earth.",
