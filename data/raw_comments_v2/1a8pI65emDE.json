Since we have no fossil data to guide our thinking, we are forced to \nrely on some clever experiments involving heating mixtures of simple \nchemicals that were very likely to be found in the early pre-biotic oceans. \nA creative graduate student named Stanley Miller. exposed a mixture of \nmethane, ammonia, hydrogen gas and water to electrical discharges \n(simulating lightning) and to his great surprise ended up with a brown \nsolution rich in amino acids and simple carbohydrates. His results have \nbeen supported by the chemical analysis of carbon rich meteorites found on \nAntarctic ice sheets (where they would be protected from contamination of \nterrestrial biomolecules). These carbonite meterorites, formed in outer \nspace, also contain the same amino acids (both left and right handed \nisomers; cells contain only left handed amino acids) that Miller produced \nin his experiment. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the \nmost important biomolecules. Short chains of amino acids (called \nproteinoids) have been made by heating dry mixtures of amino acids. \nProteinoids actually have some weak enzymatic activities, stimulating \nchemical reactions needed for cell metabolism. Similar work as shown that \nfatty acids and even the nitrogenous bases found in RNA and DAN can be \nformed in \"pre-biotic\" conditions.\n\nNow that we know that the ingredients of life could have formed and \naccumulated in the early oceans, how did the first cell originate? \nCell-like blobs called microspheres have been produced by boiling a mixture \nof lipids and proteinoids. These simple blobs are still a long way from the \ncomplexity (with over a thousand different kinds of proteins) of a \nbacterium.\n\nThis is as far as I can take it, but I should mention that there is \nevidence that RNA was the first information chemical (before DNA). \nRecently, RNA was shown to be able to act as an enzyme, performing precise \nchemical reations such as cutting and splicing RNA molecules at a precise \nlocation (these talented RNA's are called ribozymes). Also, RNA molecules \ncan be made from individual bases by first attaching to and lining up along \nthe flat, organized crystals of clay minerals. (Clay is covered with \npositive charges that would attract negatively charged molecules like RNA \nbases).\n\nWe may never know what caused the first bacterial (or pre-bacterial) cell \nto form; some people speculate that a bacterial spore drifted to earth from \na different planet (but that just begs the question of how that cell \noriginated) Christians such as myself who see the formation of life \nproceeding gradually by natural processes can easily see opportunities for \ndivine intervention to get the whole thing rolling (just as you need a big \nbang before galaxies, stars and planets can form). I suspect new insights \nconcerning the creation of life will emerge in the next century (perhaps \nbacteria-like cells will be found on Mars, which once had rivers and seas, \nafter all.)\n\nGeez that took really long to type.\ufeff",
