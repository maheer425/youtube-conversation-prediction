I maybe tried to read the trilogy a decade ago? \nAnd I felt the exact way. Now I've picked up the books again and am reading \nfrom the beginning. I'm half-way through Fellowship, and I completely \nagree--the first half of the book is very, very slow. Tolkien does not have \na great sense of pacing and spends entirely too long in the Shire (in my \nhumble opinion, at least). His poetry and songs can be mighty \nself-indulgent, and his descriptions, while thorough, are not entirely \nappealing, evocative or imaginative, although there are times when they're \nvery well done as well.\n\nHonestly, The Lord of The Rings is not a masterpiece in terms of prose or \npacing--but in thematic storytelling, plot and scope. It was really the \nfirst of its kind in terms of the scope of the world-building. The creation \nof the languages, the introduction of the various races and their \nhistories, the magnitude of the world and its geography--all from one man. \nI mean, Tolkien shaped modern fantasy as we know it. Our modern notions of \nElves as being tall, fair, immortal beings as opposed to Santa's \nhelpers--Tolkien's. Orcs being generally ugly, beastial, savage and tribal \ncreatures--Tolkien's. Dwarves being great miners, warriors and having a \nsophisticated but secretive culture--Tolkien's. Hobbits, half-lings, and \ntheir culture--solely Tolkien. He drew loads of influence from real world \nmythology and epic poems of the past, particularly Nordic mythology and the \nepic poem of Beowulf, but so much originality came from a single man. That \nwas a pretty astonishing achievement in the world of fiction at that time, \nand fantasy in particular, as everything before that was pretty much based \nin Arthurian legend and Knights of the Round Table and that ilk. Tolkien \nreally did something profound and gave us a world to share and explore and \ncreate in, and it's earned him an unbelievable following that's well \ndeserved.\n\nBut as for the books themselves, I can't say for certain how the Two Towers \nor The Return of the King will go, but after you get to Rivendell in \nFellowship, the book picks up. Or at least that's how it felt to me. Try \nand get through all three if you can, but if not, you can say you tried. \nMaybe try again after a decade or two? It seems to be working out for me. \nCheers.",

Then I read the \nthird book immediately thereafter. \nThe books have flaws; as a narrative of a story they can be very slow and \nstodgy.  But what inspires me about them is the awesome scope of the \nbooks.  They are epics, like Beowulf or the tales of Homer.  They are \nmagnificent sweeps of images, emotions and moments.  I think that's why the \nmovies are overall, better than the books.  The story is better off in a \nmovie which is better suited to passing on feelings and images.  When I \nthink of these books I am reminded of operas, fables, and old-fashioned \nHollywood epics like \"The Ten Commandments\" or \"Ben Hur\" or \"Lawrence of \nArabia\".  Especially in the case of the first two, they are an experience \nwhere the 'normal' movie features of character development and dialogue are \nsecondary; the point is the grand scenes and archetypes drawn from legend \nand classic mythology.\nAnd the orcs are pretty cool.",

It was one of the first great \nhigh-fantasy stories, and was less Tolkien trying to write a fantasy story, \nthan trying to create an entire mythos: His original plan was to create a \ngreat epic mythos, in the style of the Greco-Roman or Norse myths, but for \nBritain. He literally created a whole world, and a very in-depth one, with \nits own cultures, languages (which were all laid out and extensively \ndevised by Tolkien, he being a language professor who used to invent \nlanguages for fun when he was a child), creation myths, races, and all \nsorts of things the likes of which had never been seen before. Sure, \nnowadays high fantasy stories of trolls, orcs, elves and evil dark lords \nare a dime a dozen, but back in the 1940s and 50s when Tolkien was writing, \nit was still pretty rare.

Tolkien envisioned these complicated stories and \nworlds in ways no one had before. Like, before his stories the mythology of \nelves and dwarves was very different from what it is today. Personally, I \ndon't think the books are well written. He has a tendency to get bogged \ndown minutia that really has no bearing on the story. Also, he contradicts \nhimself. He sets up the Ring to be this force that will corrupt anyone, and \nright after that introduces a character (Tom Bombadil) that isn't \nsusceptible to it's powers. Now, I love Tom Bombadil, with his songs and \nwoodsmanship, but he doesn't do anything for the story, and kind of \nsabotages the whole plot. Later Faramir does the same thing when he's not \ntempted by the ring. Tolkien had great use of themes, and was wonderfully \ninventive, but not an entertaining writer. ",

Tolkien wrote poems and songs to go with his \nbooks, something that is hard to do. All the characters go through \ndevelopment throughout, making friends and enemies. Also, Tolkien created \nan entire language (Elvish) as well as several versions of it. He created \nan entire world with beautiful places and ugly ones.
