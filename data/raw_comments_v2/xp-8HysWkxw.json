So as eliminating a branch of the Great Ape family, and not creating \nand off shoot or 3rd regional species.. So why Oh why are we left with so \nmany suposed living relatives? Climate and Resources are often used to \nrationalize this fact.. But the proof is in the pudding, and other than \nOrangutan. Monkey, chimps, Gorrilas and ape all shared the same regions of \n3 continents. South America, Africa and Asia. Over lapping and challenging \nfor those same resources.. Not a Human trait, when we are mating and \ncreating new Hominid classes.. Mating with who? Obviously not monkeys, \nchimps, gorillas and Ape.. or Orangutan. Something just doesn't add up..\ufeff",

Never \nquestion a scientist and his theories or methods.[No leap of faith here] \nUntil he is proven wrong on his data, only because his new data shows that \nhe is now correct. Science has missed the mark so often, it's \nshould be coined STUCK.. Scientific Theories Under Current Knowledge.. Hey \nthat's good, Though to date not one fact in the Bible has been proven to be \nfalse, whether you believe in it or not.. I understand this concept, and am \nnot myself a STUCK person, it is possible to believe in God and also \nbelieve that Science has gotten us this far. The bible is the building \nscience of the soul, where textbooks are the building science of the \nUniverse[1st language is mathematics] though everything we know comes from \nbooks.This is truly a debate between spiritual and physical. Not about \nproving and not being able to prove. We would get into less debates and \narguments if people of faith would read the bible, especial where it says \nnot to judge people. Or casting that first stone. I like science and I am \nalso a person of faith, and also don't see a conflict of interest. Whether \nit was the big bang or not, you can't prove that God didn't create the \nUniverse..
