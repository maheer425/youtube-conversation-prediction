The only reason people are \ncomplaining and asking for a buff is because most of the meta champs today \nare much stronger, or they just don't know how to properly play Diana. (She \nis a tough champion.) \n\nRecently, in patch 5.3, Riot buffed the speed for Pale Cascade's rotation, \nwhich was sorely needed and a great buff overall.\n\nHowever, in higher ranks (Gold+) Crescent Strike will hit about 20% of the \ntime. The curve and the medium distance makes it easy to dodge unless \nyou're in melee range.\n\nToday, Diana is not played much as an assasin and more of a fighter. Why? \nShe has no escape. Diana is either you go all in, or you don't. To \ncompensate, Riot has given Diana Pale Cascade, a moderate shield to help \nyou survive in those all in moments. Unfortunately, that sheild is enough \nto kill the enemy ADC and live.\n\nSo? What do we need? Not much. She is a good champion, it's just that \ntoday's current meta doesn't call for Diana. I think a well rounded \nsolution would to simply be increase the range of her Q, but keeping the \nsame amount of cure, and also give Diana some extra movement speed when all \n3 of her orbs are popped. This way, she won't do too much damage or have \ntoo big a shield while building as a fighter, but will still be able to \nmove in and out of teamfights a little easier.\ufeff",
