This is obvious. We don't try to train road \nusers to the same level of expertise and proficiency we try to give combat \npilots, or pilots of sophisticated jet passenger or transport aircraft. The \npoint I was trying to make, is that driving a car and operating an aircraft \nare fundamentally different, just as driving a car and riding a unicycle \nare different. All 3 require lots of your attention, but they require it in \nslightly different ways. The unicycle requires reflexes. The Apache \nrequires mental skills. If your reflexes and multitasking were terrible, \nyou probably shouldn't fly it, but mostly what you do in an aircraft is a \nmental game like chess, or algebra & statistics.

Being able to ignore you \ninstincts and trust your instruments, is a huge one. Being able to \ncorrectly read and interpret those instruments, under pressure, is another. \nAircraft can be hard, but you have generally got a few moments to think. A \ncar or motorbike near the limit of performance & control, it has to be \nreflex. It does everything too quickly for you to think about, it has to be \nlike standing on one leg - you have to just KNOW what to do.
