            "text": "The wall\n\nThe wall at Jericho was an impenetrable force to any army that was trying \nto overtake the city. Before even dealing with the wall, the attacking \ntroops would have to navigate their way across a 27 foot wide 9 foot deep \npit that lined the outer edges of the city. Then there was the wall itself. \n17 foot high 5 foot thick pure mass of solid stone. If the attacking army \nmanaged to get this far without being shot down by archers, all that was \nleft was to defeat the well trained Canaanite army that was waiting within. \nThis was the reality for a young leader named Joshua and his ragtag \nIsraelite army. These Israelites, who had seen an entire generation live \nand die while wandering through the desert, were tired, hungry and facing \nwhat seemed like an impossible task. A hopeless situation. Now I haven't \nlived very long, but I've lived long enough to know this: that running into \nwalls is a part of life. And the bigger the wall the more hopeless the \nsituation can seem. The large walls of sickness, loss, divorce, addiction \nthey pop up all around us and they seem impenetrable. And just like the \nwall at Jericho, these walls rarely stand alone. The walls of our lives are \noften accompanied by a deep pit of pain, suffering and despair and all the \nwhile an army of hopelessness attacks us on every side. The question is \nasked all the time, \" if God loves us so much, and is so powerful then how \ncould he allow these walls to pop up around me?\" Now I don't pretend to \nhave the answer to any of those questions nor do I pretend to understand \njust how deep or dark your suffering has been. I simply want to suggest \nthat maybe God does his best work from seemingly hopeless situations. When \nI read the bible, I read about people and characters all who faced \nseemingly hopeless situations. In fact, I can't find a single person who \nwalked faithfully with God without first facing a hopeless situation.\nAdam & Eve ruined paradise by inviting sin and death into a perfect world. \nA hopeless case. Joseph was betrayed by his brothers for his pride and put \nin prison. A hopeless case. Moses was cornered on the banks of the Red Sea \nwith the most powerful army in the world breathing down his neck. A \nhopeless case. Gideon was 300 against 300,000. David stood across the \nvalley from a bloodthirsty giant. Esther was a woman trying to gain a word \nwith a prideful king. Daniel's roommate was a lion. His friends were thrown \nin an oven. Jonah sucked at his job and got stuck in a whale. Peter was a \ncoward. Paul was imprisoned. The 5,000 had no food. Lazarus was dead. \nTimothy was too young. Abraham was too old. The youngest son was too \nstupid. The walls of Jericho were to strong. And Jesus was humiliated, hung \non a cross and buried in a tomb burying all hopes of the revolution that \nwas hoped for for thousands of years. Now everybody was ready to close the \nbook on these stories. The end. Game over. But if there's one thing we \nlearn from the scriptures, it's that we can never place a period where God \nhas placed a comma. Because when all other options have been worn out, when \ncircumstances couldn't get worse, when everything has failed, get ready \nbecause THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE GOD SHOWS UP. Because Joseph became second in \ncommand. The Red Sea parted. Gideon won without lifting a weapon. Goliath's \nhead was on a plate. Esther spoke and the king listened. Daniel tamed the \nlion. The oven felt like room temperature. Nineveh repented. Peter became \nthe rock. Paul rejoiced. 12 basketfuls were left over. Lazarus was just \nkidding. Timothy built a church. Abraham built a family. The youngest son \ncame home to a party. THE WALLS OF JERICHO CAME TUMBLING DOWN. AND JESUS \nCHRIST PULLED OFF THE RESURRECTION, DEFEATING SIN AND DEATH. AND THE \nCREATION THAT HAD BEEN MARRED SO MANY YEARS AGO WAS NOW RESTORED FOR ALL \nTIME!! With God, what seems like a hopeless situation is not only possible, \nit's favorable. Because only God can turn a mess into a message. Only God \ncan turn a trial into a triumph. A test into a testimony and a victim into \na victor. His power is made perfect in weakness. So let us rejoice in our \ntrials and hold unswervingly to the hope we profess. Cause he who promised \nis faithful, was faithful and will Always Be faithful. No matter how \nhopeless the situation.\ufeff",
