            "text": "Dear Riot,\n\nI have finally decided to uninstall League of Legends from my computer and \nI have no plans of playing League ever again. I will also discourage people \nfrom playing this game. I will admit, I love playing LoL, the game play, \nthe art, everything about it is amazing. What I dislike about LoL has \nalways been it's community-- specifically the toxic players/flamers. I \ndon't even mind those that troll or go afk. Sure they are annoying, but \nthose players that flame at you and blame you for their deaths even if it's \nclearly their fault, those are the worse example of humanity. I was just in \na normal game today, and in champ select, these two guys wanted to duo at \nthe bot lane, even if I get the first pick and called for support. I told \nmyself, \"I'll be a team player and just go mid and let these two guys go \nbot lane.\". In game, the enemy mid laner kept roaming bot lane because I \nwas winning my lane. I have called mia on several occasions, roamed (maybe \nonce or twice), and even pinked their lane, but they kept dying (because \nthey obviously weren't looking at the map or were too busy to notice the \npings I have been sending out). Of course, I did not want to roam together \nwith the enemy mid lane because I wanted to focus on my lane as well, I was \nthinking I already provided them the wards necessary and pinged them, they \nshould know what to do. It would have been advantageous for the whole team \nsince I would be able to get the cs and xp advantage and maybe get a turret \n(after which I could roam myself), while the enemy mid laner would be \nwasting her time roaming. Of course, I was thinking my bot lane would play \nsafe since necessary warnings were already called (not to mention my pink \nward). \n\nSo after they have died a million times, my bot lane went agro on me \nbecause I fed the enemy mid lane. How can I be feeding when they were the \none dying all the time? They were saying nasty things to me, blaming me. \nI'm a patient person, but there are certain things people should not saying \nagainst me or else I will fight back so I did. I will admit, I did stoop to \ntheir level. I said nasty things to them too, and I feel horrible that I \ndid that. My point here is, your game, no matter how nice it is, it turns \ngood people into rude people. And you obviously have done nothing about it \n(especially in the OCE server). I don't ever want to say those things to \nanyone again. So I think it is wiser for me to uninstall the game. Again, I \nthink you did a good job with the game play, the concept, the art, \neverything about the game. It's your community that is the worse. I have \nplayed similar games before, I played DoTA and DoTA2, but your community is \nthe worse community. Honestly, I think (majority) of the people who play \nyour game are the worse example of humankind. I wish you change your \nsystem, but I will never play League again.\ufeff",

I began to ask where \npeople were from at champ select screen and if someone said \"PL\" (Poland) I \nleave the game at champ selection screen... In all my years of playing \nleague I saw JUST ONE person from poland who was actually GOOD at the game \nand he was the captain of our team... I assure you if Riot puts a poll for \nEUNE servers \"Should we create a LoL server only for Polish people, (move \naccounts from other servers to the polish one if your IP is polish and all \nthat)?\" more than 99% of the votes will be \"HELL YEAH, FINALLY!\" Sorry good \npolish players, i know you are there somewhere... but you are not a lot. \nRiot should put players with a good match history, who were not reported \nand etc. on one team and all the haters, flamers and etc. on another \nteam... or make them just 5 haters vs 5 afk-ers and so on... make bad \nplayers play with bad players... dont put someone with a flawless history \nin a team with 4 people who can barely use a mouse and can barely speak \nenglish... Do you even Matchmake, RIOT ?\ufeff",
