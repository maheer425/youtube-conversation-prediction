            "text": "+Dragonminer The late 80's was already OK for PC gaming. And the early 90's \nhad a lot of pretty decent stuff already too. IMO at least. It's a matter \nof tastes I guess. But not only in game catalog, the PCs were always \nsuperior in hardware capabilities. Considering the DIY factor (or mount it \nyourself) and the PC being upgradeable, as I said earlier. It's not the \nsame to buy a new console every 7 years, than upgrade your specs a bit \nevery 2 years. And btw, this is cheaper too.\n\nAlso from a developer perspective, It has always been easier for developers \nto develop for PC, rather than videoconsole. Well, maybe not that much in \nthe very early 90's or the 80's, like many devs used Apple computers (the \nNeXT, for example), rather than common workstations. But with the new APIs \nin the mid 90's, it became fairly easier.\n\nNowadays, consoles are basically PCs with \"limited\" features. More like \nmultimedia centers. So it's no wonder why so many people is turning their \nheads to the PC, when it offers more features and less limitations that a \nvideoconsole, while still looking good or even better than a console game. \nIt has nothing to do with the \"blast processing\" scam. It's just \nvideoconsole developers, digging their own grave because they are reaching \nthe limit, and they still dare to place fences around the field (a way of \nsaying they are limiting things they should not).\n\nNot to mention the consoles that are based on computers. Like the new steam \nmachines or alienware. Those are not alike computers, those are true \ncomputers made into a console, with a custom OS.\n\nThe only valid point for consoles against PC was back when you didn't have \nto install the games into the consoles, which now you do anyway. And you \ndidn't have to deal with drivers problems or compatibility issues. But that \ndoesn't seem to be so much of a problem anymore. So what's the point of a \nvideoconsole, against a PC now?",
