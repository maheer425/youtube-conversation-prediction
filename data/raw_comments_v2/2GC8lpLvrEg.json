Otherwise, correct.\n\n\"You are talking about a Communistic government without free trade in a \nperfect Utopia.\"\nNo, I am *not* talking about communism (and again, it is not a form of \ngovernment), as communism was based on human labor, while RBE is based on \nrobotic labor (primarily).\n\n\"Where everyone receives the same pay whether they work or not.\"\nNo, I am for eliminating payments altogether. In my view, everyone gets \nfree access to goods necessary or survival (because we already produce \nenough of these, so it is simply inhumane to deny access to these, and \nknowing this, if you argue against making the right for food, water, and \nshelter basic human rights, you are a monster).\nBUT, if someone wishes to get access to special goods and services, they go \nto work, and get specific vouchers to access their specific needs.\nAs you can see, this is not communism/socialism, where people indeed got \nsimilar payment simply for showing up at work. That didn't work indeed (it \nwas a flawed concept to begin with).\n\n\"This does not work in reality sadly, because this removes all motivation \nin the work force.\"\nWrong. Money is certainly a motivation for work, but not the *only* one. \nNote that people donate a lot of work hours yearly, workaholics aren't \nmotivated by money, creative people cannot even be stopped, and in the case \nof creative jobs, payment beyond a certain level has actually been shown to \nbe counter-productive.\nOf course, if everyone gets free access to goods necessary for survival, \npeople with sh*tty jobs (e.g. cleaning toilets) would suddenly stop going \nto work. But since almost everything can be automated nowadays (and it is \ngrowing exponentially), this is actually a good thing; machines free us up \nto enable us to do truly meaningful things (instead of cleaning toilets).\n\n\"This is the reason why SMart Communistic governments are allowing for a \ntotally free capitalistic market, countries such as China have allowed for \nFree trade areas in which some of the biggest cities in the world are \nlocated at currently.\"\nThere is nothing communist about China anymore; it has a capitalist \neconomic system, and a centralized government.\n\n\"Free market drives competition and individual motivation. without this \nyour economy is broken.\"\nFree market never really existed; market has always been influenced by \nlaws, and the market always moves towards its natural end result; oligopoly \nor monopoly (since producers wish to influence the market to secure their \nincome, and gaining larger and larger sections of the market enables them \nto have greater control over it).\nCompetition, just like war is a waste of resources. For this reason, I \nwould like to eliminate competition as well (it makes no sense in abundance \nanyway).\nIndividual motivation can be varied, but it should *not* be the need for \nsurvival in a world where we already produce enough food for everyone (FAO, \n2002). In a world like this, until the need for survive is kept as an \nindividual motivation to work, we cannot call ourselves civilized.\nAs for economy, a capitalist economic system may be broken without this \nmotivation indeed, but capitalism is *not* the only form of economy - and \nit is certainly not the best one we can think of either (RBE is better as \nits priority is human well-being, while capitalism disregards it entirely).\nBTW, do you really think we would still use capitalism 100, 1000, or even \n10.000 years later? People in the 1500s thought the same about feudalism ;)\nNote: capitalism is based on continuous growth (while wasting resources), \nwhile the resources of the planet are limited. The most likely breaking \npoint will be the year of Peak Oil (when you hear that Saudi Arabia and \nRussia - the biggest producers - both reach their peak production). We \nbuilt our (capitalist) economies on oil but it's a limited resource. \nMoreover, we have been wasteful - just think about the US and USSR gas \nguzzlers, not to mention tanks and cargo ships, which go back and forth \nbetween the US and China just because making T-shirts is cheaper (in money) \nacross the ocean - what an idiotic system. \n\nIf you are interested in a detailed model of an RBE, I could give you one \nnext time, and we could discuss it - you could point out things you don't \nunderstand, or anything that seems to be a mistake ;)",

That is entirely \nfalse, as of early 2014 the fusion reactor at the Laurence Livermore \nnational lab created the first nuclear reactor that outputs more energy \nthat it takes.\"\n*Wrong.* Even that article on Wired stated that only 1/200th of the energy \nof the lasers was imparted to the hydrogen fuel, which produced 1,7-2,6 \ntimes as much energy as it took up, meaning that the experiments actually \nproduced 0,85%-1,3% of the energy used each time they tried.\n\n\"Again, if you speak for our CURRENT needs, however our energy demands are \nexponentially increasing decade by decade. Again, let me stress this to \nyou. Solar is a great placeholder until the next big leap in energy \nproduction. Even when fusion power plants come solar can still used in a \nwide range of applications but it will never be the fore frontal method for \nproviding an entire countries energy needs.\"\nIf fusion power ever becomes a reality, then cool until then, solar is a \nshitty placeholder, because it only works during the day, but geothermal \nand fission power can be supplemented with it.\n\n\"Solar will never account for more than 10% of a countries energy sources \nnot even close, the method is just too costly and does not yield enough \nenergy even if you had 99.9% efficient solar panels which we are no where \nnear.\"\nAgain, forget solar panels. I am talking about a mirror-tower-steam turbine \ndesign. And solar power cannot account for 100% indeed, a combination of \n0-40% solar power and 60-100% geothermal power could power us until our \nneeds multiply by about 10.000 times.\n\n\"It is also extremely impractical because the amount of energy you get from \nsolar is based off 3 factors, the efficiency of the panels, or the \nefficiency of the solar tower, and primarily it is based off how much AREA \nyou can redirect sun light to energy. Again you need HUGE amounts of area \nto increase your energy output which makes it very impractical.\"\nAgain, forget solar panels, as I'm not talking about them either. But I am \nsaying this for the 5th time at least. What's your problem?\n\n\"How do you double the energy output of a solar tower ? Well you sadly need \ndouble the amount of mirrors covering double the amount of sun light area \nto your tower.\"\nEither that, or you build another power plant, since you might not want to \nexceed the melting point of the material that the heat absorber in the \nfocal point is made of.\n\n\"Solar towers, not a efficient way to produce energy for future needs, its \nonly a place holder for now.\"\nOf course, it depends on what happens in the future.\n\n\"Solar panels? Great for a wide range of applications that only yield very \nsmall amounts of energy, But will never account for even 5% of an entire \ncountries energy consumption, I will bet my life on that.\"\nI would say 6% just to piss you off. You are pissing me off already.\n\n\"The entire branch of renewable energy only accounts for Roughly 6% of an \nentire countries needs. Solar only accounts for 0.23% of USA's entire \nenergy consumption.\"\nAnd it is constantly growing. BTW, do you think it is so low right now \nbecause it is so inefficient? Did you know that nuclear plants can function \nfor decades, and coal plants could even function for centuries? Or did you \nthink that as soon as we invent something, we automatically replace almost \neverything?Also, have you ever heard about them stupid money constraints? \n(Its not like money would be justifiable today, but we still use it because \nit is hard to change the foundations of a functioning system on the fly)\n\n\"HAVE fun with convincing the world that solar can power the entire county \nLOL. You are living in your own fictional world.\"\nAgain, every hour, more solar energy hits the face of the Earth than the \nyearly consumption of humanity.

            "text": "+sztellanora \n\"\"\"fusion power may never even be a practical option.\"\"\"\n\nAgain, your information is entirely outdated. That is entirely false, as of \nearly 2014 the fusion reactor at the Laurence Livermore national lab \ncreated the first nuclear reactor that outputs more energy that it takes.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2014/02/fusion-power-not-yet/\nhttp://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/giant-leap-for-nuclear-fusion-as-scientists-get-more-energy-out-than-fuel-put-in/\n\nHowever the energy generated is still very small, Just like back in 1951 \nhow a fission power plant first achieved criticality and only generated \nenough power to light 5 light bulbs. Fast forward to 1970's and the first \n100 GW Fission power-plants were built, then 300 GW in 1980s.\n\nNow the question is how many years until a feasible Nuclear Fusion reactor \n? Logically anywhere between 1-3 decades, since technological advances are \nexponentially increasing, Advances are happening at much quicker rates than \nin the 1950's and that is for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\"\"\"I'm not pretending it; it can (more solar energy hits the surface of the \nEarth in an hour than we use in a whole year\"\"\"\"\n\nAgain, if you speak for our CURRENT needs, however our energy demands are \nexponentially increasing decade by decade. Again, let me stress this to \nyou. Solar is a great placeholder until the next big leap in energy \nproduction. Even when fusion power plants come solar can still used in a \nwide range of applications but it will never be the fore frontal method for \nproviding an entire countries energy needs.  \n\nSolar will never account for more than 10% of a countries energy sources \nnot even close, the method is just too costly and does not yield enough \nenergy even if you had 99.9% efficient solar panels which we are no where \nnear.\n\nIt is also extremely impractical because the amount of energy you get from \nsolar is based off 3 factors, the efficiency of the panels, or the \nefficiency of the solar tower, and primarily it is based off how much AREA \nyou can redirect sun light to energy. Again you need HUGE amounts of area \nto increase your energy output which makes it very impractical.\n\nHow do you double the energy output of a solar tower ? Well you sadly need \ndouble the amount of mirrors covering double the amount of sun light area \nto your tower.\n\nSolar towers, not a efficient way to produce energy for future needs, its \nonly a place holder for now.\n\nSolar panels? Great for a wide range of applications that only yield very \nsmall amounts of energy, But will never account for even 5% of an entire \ncountries energy consumption, I will bet my life on that.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"It could actually power cities, but you are making a straw man argument \nhere, \"\"\"\n\nThe entire branch of renewable energy only accounts for Roughly 6% of an \nentire countries needs. Solar only accounts for 0.23% of USA's entire \nenergy consumption.\n\nHAVE fun with convincing the world that solar can power the entire county \nLOL. You are living in your own fictional world.\n\nhttp://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&t=3\n\nOfficial EIA Energy consumption site.\n\nNo one said it was the only two methods, look at the Official EIA chart\nhttp://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&t=3\nHowever, we need something to replace Fossil Fuel Burning because we are \nrunning out fast, We need a massive energy production method that is \npractical and can be the main forefrontal method for providing an entire \ncountries yearly energy needs.\n\nIts either going to be Fission or Fusion. Hydro electric is another method \nwhich can be practical however, the problem is not everyone has a gigantic \nRiver running at their disposal, Even Chinas Three Jorges Hydroelectric \nMonster Dam 2nd largest in the entire world can only provide China with 14% \nof their entire yearly energy needs. And that % will decrease yearly as the \nenergy demands go up.\n\nThe problem with renewable sources is that they take up Massive amounts of \nspace its impractical.

Again  with solar, you are essentially only absorbing a fraction \n(the actual number is mind boggling much more than a fraction of a \ntrillionth) of energy from a Nuclear Fusion reactor 93 million miles away.\nSo basically what everyone wants to do currently is create a Fusion reactor \ninstead of absorbing a fraction of the amount of energy from one thats 93 \nmillion miles away.\"\nNo, what everyone wants to do currently is to have enough power with the \ncurrently available technologies (renewables, nuclear, etc.), since fusion \npower may never even be a practical option.\n\n\"Sure, but thats not the issue, Its the fact that you are pretending that \nSolar could ever meet the energy demands of our entire planet earth.\"\nI'm not pretending it; it can (more solar energy hits the surface of the \nEarth in an hour than we use in a whole year, which means its potential on \nthe surface of the Earth is 8760x as much as we currently use, and I'm not \neven counting space-based solar panels with wireless energy transfer). But \nsolar power (along with wind, tidal, etc.) would really be just a \nsupplement to geothermal power (its potential is 4000x as much as we \ncurrently use) and nuclear (preferably, breeder reactors or LFTR).\n\n\"You are essentially trying to say \"fusion is useless because we have \nsolar\" Completely and utterly wrong. Understand that as each decade goes on \nour energy demands keep multiplying and going up.\"\nI'm not saying that. I'm just saying that until fusion is even practical, \ngeothermal and solar energy are the next best options (currently the best).\n\n\"So we do need exponentially better and more efficient ways to produce \nenergy not just a temporary placeholder. Solar is a temporary placeholder \nand is extremely primitive in ways of energy production yeilding very low \nproduction. It might yeild enough for current modern day houses (again \nCURRENT this is a temporary placeholder instead of a solution) You cannot \nexpect solar to yield enough energy to power cities.\"\nIt could actually power cities, but you are making a straw man argument \nhere, as I don't count on solar only. Don't forget that besides solar, we \ncan also use geothermal, nuclear, wind, hydro, and other renewables, and I \nalready said this many times.\n\n\"Even if you had almost perfect solar pannels with a 100% efficiency rate \nthe energy production would still only be a temporary placeholder until a \nsuperior one that yields much more comes along AKA Fusion.\"\nThis is a false dichotomy; I keep pointing out that solar and fusion are \nnot the only options, but you make it seem as if it were anyway.

There is no way it \ntakes 6 liters of heavy water to replace a ton of coal in terms of \nenergy content, so I assume he was talking about the quantity of *heavy \nwater* in 6 liters of sea water... or about 0.18 grams of water \nconsumed, harvested from six liters of natural water.  (if my numbers and \nhis are otherwise good)  And we can forestall global flooding!  HA!\n\nIf it takes 20 years of development costs will it ever be up to the \ncompetition?...will it be cost effective?  In 20 years solar (indirect \nfusion) is likely to be everywhere and very cheap (given the trajectory of \nrecent decades), for one example.  Yes storage--batteries, capacitors, \nflywheels or whatever, may be a much bigger hurdle but likely to be \nsurmounted over 20 yr.s too.  I'm a skeptic as much as I'd LOVE to \nbelieve.  Fusion has been an *extremely* difficult project.  If they can do \nit, *lets see it and soon!*  Likely they would be inline for a Nobel \nPrize(s) as well as massive profits. \n\n((But I thought Lockheed predicted something like ten yrs?))\ufeff",
