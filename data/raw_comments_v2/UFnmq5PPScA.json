In Skyfall, Bond was shot off a train, and was falsely dead. They used \nthe element that was used in one of the old Bond plots, as \"You Only Live \nTwice\". When Bond was falsely dead, he doesn't pass the tests, because he \nlost some of his strength in himself for only just a bit, because he was \ntoo banged up.

Including how FBI operated Why? Because people who \nmade those movies did their homework and bothered to hire people who knew \nhow it was. Nicholas Pileggi was a journalist who wrote about Mafia and \nknew how they worked inside-out. This is why DeNiro, Pesci and Liotta \n\"often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from \nwriting the book\". Why? To REALISTICALLY portray the behavior of a memeber \nof outfit. This is also why DeNiro before the \"Raging Bull\" started \ntraining boxing - to look REALISTIC as a boxer. And he did. Realistic movie \nmade in HOLLYWOOD. Just as Casino: Heat, Insider (M. Mann); Wolf of \nWallstreet - in most of those movies you had bits and pieces of how the CIA \nworked. We're talking about fights, not how the CIA works - any Steven \nSeagal movie have more realistic fight sequences than what they did in \nBourne. It's simply a botched job, nothing else. It could have been done \nbetter. To summarize - I don't have a problem with Greengrass' portrayal of \nCIA and other intellgence agencies, such as MI% work - it's pretty much \nexact with what we know from whistleblowers (such as Ann Machon for \nexample). He also showed citizen invigilation in the US and Europe - again, \nvery accurate and even a bit \"prophetic\" as we didn't have Snowden \nrevelations back than and a lot of delusional film critics accused \nGreengrass of \"cospiracy theories\".",
