How many zombie apocalypse films have \nused that since Night of the Living Dead? It just seems like Cinema Sins \nand Honest trailers are labeling pretty much everything used more than once \nin movies as a cliche these days. If the goal is to eliminate all cliches \nand never EVER be repetitive in films in any way, shape or form, I'd say \nthat's kind of an unrealistic standard. By that logic, I could classify the \nnumber of extraterrestrial films involving people as the \"humans in a movie \nabout aliens\" cliche. Do you see how silly that is? While films ideally \nshould always try to be original and creative, they can still accomplish \nthat and have at least some things in common. There's nothing wrong with \ndemanding better from what we pay money for, provided it's within reason.\ufeff",

Have the series be the \ninterviewer going around and doing the interviews, each episode could have \nhim start one of the \"stories\" like the battle of Yonkers or the Satellite \ncrew and then fade into the actual episode as the the interview starts as a \nflashback.  They could have easily gotten a good two or three seasons of \none hour episodes out of that and it would have been long enough to fit \neverything from the beginning to end of the war and would avoid needing to \nhave some \"jammed in\" protagonist no one wanted.  At least that's how I'd \nhave pitched it...*sigh* but then no book to zombie story sticks to the \nsource material...look at Walking Dead, that comic kicks ass, but the show \njust went way the hell off after the first season and is barely \nrecognizable as a walking dead adaptation anymore.\ufeff",
