He tucked his tail between his legs and crawled toward \nme and fell on his back and wanted me to rub his belly. He immediately \nstopped being aggressive and just sort of hid behind my knees, and after a \nfew minutes he was able to calm down and started feeling safe enough to \nstart wagging his tail and trying to play. I was able to find his address \non his collar and walked him safely across traffic and take him back home \nbefore anyone could call animal control or he could hurt himself. He \nactually looked a lot like the lighter pit bull in this video - I can't \nremember his actual name because since it wasn't on his tag I started \ncalling him Big Mac, and that's what I now remember him as. I'm not saying \nthat what I did was smart or that people who are apprehensive around pit \nbulls are bad people, because it really could have gone a totally different \nway under certain circumstances, but it just goes to show that these dogs \ndo have flip sides, like every other animal they're capable of \nbeing dangerous but they can also be very sociable, and it's really not \nfair to judge them just because they sometimes resort to aggression when \nthey feel scared or feel like they're being backed into a corner.\ufeff",
