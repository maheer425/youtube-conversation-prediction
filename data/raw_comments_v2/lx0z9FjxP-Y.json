Kathy Bates is great here! I need to check out some \nof her other films.",

Most movies today (along with TV and most anything else that's \n\"mainstream\") just really lack quality and originality. It's all \nexplosions, fights, fast cars, sex and drugs. That's pretty much it. I like \nthe movies that actually have stories to them. And I love movies that make \nyou think about certain issues in the world and whatnot. Just seems like \neverything is so bland and stupid compared to things in the past :/",
