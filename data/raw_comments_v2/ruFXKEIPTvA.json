            "text": "+HollaJo3 I don't know if you've driven the F-Type Coupe R, but it isn't a \nvery good \"daily driver.\" I don't know what you would use it for, but the R \nfeels like it has way too much power and is incredibly loud, and there \nisn't a way to turn it off. Even with Dynamic mode off, it still screams. \nI'd go for the new 2016 F-Type Coupe V6 S with the new 6 speed manual \ntranny. It's almost perfect!\n\nJust my thoughts, but don't take my word for it, you should research \ncomparisons on forums and such before you make you decision. :)",
