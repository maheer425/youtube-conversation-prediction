            "text": "one observation! Isn't Laura of Italian descent? Why is she using cream \ncheese for the cheese cake? the best cheesecake is make from a combination \nof ricotta and mascarpone. for a typical cheese cake mix; 500 grams of \nricotta, 250 grams of mascarpone, around 150 grams of caster sugar and \nthree beaten eggs. mix the ricotta, mascarpone and sugar together and then \nmix in the eggs into it. it will give you a much creamier texture and it \ndoesn't taste as heavy as this 'cream cheese'  \ufeff",
