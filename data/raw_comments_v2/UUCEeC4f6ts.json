Some of the smaller islands are relatively \nfar from Taiwan, such as Kinmen and Matsu, the two islands very close to \nmainland China that are used as Taiwan's first line of defense. Some of the \nislands lead to a long term territorial conflict between Taiwan and \nmainland China, which is probably an important reason why Taiwan did not \nfull claim its independence yet. Set I have seen references stating that \nChiang Kai-shek wanted two \"Chinas\" (his point not mine, please don't \nargue) to become one (and that explains why he hasn't had a grave yet), but \nit is true that the newer generation of Taiwan tend to recognize themselves \nas Taiwanese instead of Chinese while the People's Republic of China claims \nthat Taiwan is a provence of PRC.
