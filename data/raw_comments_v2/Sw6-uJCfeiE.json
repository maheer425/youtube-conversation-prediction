He then admitted he was dating my \nsister and shot me.\nOnce the doctors had removed the bullet, sewn me up and allowed me to come \nhome I made myself a toasted sandwich. Unfortunately the grill didn't work \nand I had to eat a half toasted sandwich!\nIt was the most traumatic moment of my life!!!\nTomorrow I'm going to buy one of those toasted sandwich makers so I can \navoid this happening again.\n\n-- Chris\ufeff",
