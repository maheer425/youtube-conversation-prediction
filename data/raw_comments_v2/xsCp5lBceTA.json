Piece of trivia for you, the \nhousekeepers in Frozen are named Gerda and Kai, after the siblings in the \nsnow queen. The reason I was bringing up parallels between Elsa and Liss \nwas because of the similarity in animation (particularly the ice \nanimation), which really has nothing to do with Anderson's story.",
