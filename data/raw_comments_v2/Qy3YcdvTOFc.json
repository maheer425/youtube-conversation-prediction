Cops have killed over 1000 more whites from 99-2011 \nalmost double and black crime on whites is almost 10 times higher than \nwhite crimes on blacks. 320k to 38k from 99-2011. Even if they are racist \nsorry but blacks in general actually are far more racist against whites but \nseem to justify it over a history they and their family were never a part \nof anyways. In reality slavery is the biggest reason most black families \neven ended up here to begin with so I wouldn't exactly complain because \nmight not be alive if things didn't play out exactly how they did. Better \nthen and fixed now than happening recently and still fucked up. Other \ncountries are still conducting slavery. Only 1% of Americans ever owned a \nslave and that was at its highest which back then is only a couple thousand \npeople. Not as huge as it's made out to be at all. Even to today's \nstandards that's only 3 million of almost 400 million Americans. There's \nbeen more white sex slaves and probably run by more black males over all of \nhistory than whites that owned black slaves. For them being a minority by \nsignificantly lower numbers in population to whites they are statistically \nmore likely to be involved in a crime and yes jumping someone is a crime \nit's not just drugs and murder and robbery. Hell 3 blacks just attacked a \nwhite guy because he had no comment when asked about how he felt about the \nMike Brown situation. They really are a problem in this country they play \nthe role they swear is a racist stereotype but it's really not. Illegal are \neven better occupants of American than a good number of blacks I just hate \nthem because they don't pay taxes and even getting paid less walk away with \nmore at the end of the year and can still claim government programs for \nfree food and extra income because they don't claim while legal workers get \npaid more but after taxes and insurance walk away with less and can't claim \ngovernment help like illegals can. They make inner city blacks dropping out \nof school and living off the government look like lazy fucks.... well they \nreally are actually. Can't blame them, the government gives them every \nreason to be worthless to the economy and they would rather be worthless \nand exert no effort than work for a better life and many blacks have \nmillions more opportunities to a better life yet illegals are more likely \nto succeed at it and without help because they are illegal and can't get \nit. \ufeff",

Thats the \nwhole reason why they would give you shit assignments if you did not join \ntheir hate group...because they are trying to run you off.   After all, the \nless racist there are in a department, the less influence and power they \nhave over it. \n\nSecondly -- \"Because I like the neighborhood and I want to live there.\" is \nnot valid excuse for not getting a transfer.  You may want to live there, \nbut if your job forces you to pretend to be something you are not and go \nagainst your beliefs and ethics, then you are going to hate that job.  No \nmater how posh the department or the area you live is, its not going to be \nworth it to you if you have to be miserable every day. \n\nSo I dont buy into this whole \"boo hoo, woe is me.  I'm not a racist, I \njust pretend to be.\" bullshit.   If you a cop who gets busted for being on \nof the racists in a racist department, you had better have a stack of \npapers outlining a lot of retaliation against and a lot of transfer \nrequests that have been denied by 'your' superiors.

            "text": "There is one thing bugging me here, Cenk said that the neighborhood was \npredominantly African-American; so how did these guys, with their sane \nminds, decide to engage in these kinds of racist conduct - even if it is \nbetween themselves- when they know that the community they have and want to \nprotect is predominantly black. The only logical thing I can think of and \nthis is only an opinion is that their racist behaviors or inclinations was \nthere before they even got their jobs. So I just keep wondering about the \ncriterias and the entrance examinations that people applying to this job \nhave to go through. It seems to me to be very low standards of approval.\ufeff",
