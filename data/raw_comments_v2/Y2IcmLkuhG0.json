And they were right: in the case of the Native \nAmericans, it was genocide; in the case of the blacks, it was slavery.\n\nYour contention that the major mistakes were made by flawed \"left wing \npolicies, fixed by right wing policy and then f*cked up again by liberal \nleft wing policies\" is incorrect.\nMajor US involvement in Vietnam began with the Eisenhower administration - \na Republican President. The Eisenhower administration installed the Diem \nclient regime in South Vietnam in order to block the political settlement, \nwhich would have peacefully reunited Vietnam under a government elected by \nthe people of Vietnam.\nThere were peace talks scheduled to begin in November 1968, which were \nsabotaged by the then Presidential candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon convinced \nthe south to walk away from the talks.\nOnce in office Nixon escalated the war into Laos and Cambodia, with the \nloss of an additional 22,000 American lives, 600,000 Cambodian lives, \n350,000 Laotians slaughtered, before finally settling for a peace agreement \nin 1973 that was within grasp in 1968.\n\nBoth Republican and Democrat Presidents share the blame equally for the \nAmerican war of aggression in Indochina.",

I do not know \nhistory that well, but I do know this, if this, I've seen pro-American and \nextremely biased history lessons that paint US history as something that \nlimited faults and all freedom. In fact, until high school, my history \nlessons were dominated by these biased messages that are used to promote \nnationalism. However, to say that John Green is an extremely biased \npro-American is almost laughable.\nThere are a bunch of things to prove that this video isn't extremely \nbiased, but the main argument is his reaction to the information he \npresented. In most of his previous Crash Courses (mainly world history), \nGreen is extremely enthusiastic and even with the somber information, \nbrings a good light and good fun to it. He focuses on giving information \nwhile keeping his energy up in a way that entertains. However, I've noticed \nin most of the US history lessons that he does not give a lot of positive \ninformation since (in one of his videos. I forget which) there isn't a lot \nof positive information to talk about. Instead of inventing the good that \ncame from Vietnam by defending that they were fighting against communism \nand that made the fighting justifiable, he is able tell of the wrongs from \nthe war and the tragedies and millions of lives that were lost because of \nthe US's actions.\nHeck! Look at one of his last statements! \"Before Vietnam most Americans \ntrusted their government even when they knew it did horrible things, but \nafter the war... that trust was gone\"\nIf he was truly biased, he wouldn't have even mentioned the previous \nhorrible actions. The statement wouldn't have been as powerful, sure, but \nthere would also be a lot less negativity towards the United States \ncitizens.\nYes, as I've seen in the comments, John Green didn't say everything and \ndidn't beat the horrors of Vietnam in our heads, but he can't exactly give \nall the details in a  less than 15 minute Crash Course video. He gives the \nbasics that helps us understand the concepts, and some specifics to back up \nhis claims. Some things he goes in details, sure, but these details are \nnecessary for the classes that US history students need to take. Yes, \nthere are some biases, but that's because of who the main target audience \nis, students taking US history, which is biased from that point of view.\nTo say that John Green isn't biased in some ways is a lie, but to say that \nthis video is extremely biased is also a lie. To understand, just look at \nhis reactions to what he's saying. To me, he looks and sounds disappointed \nand exasperated at the US's actions, which to really, considering what \nwe've done and the horrors we've committed, who wouldn't?\nNote: this is just me and my opinions and a reaction in defense of John \nGreen who has taught me more history than my actual history teacher, and \nhelps me understand history in a fun, yet interesting way.

Aside from using some communist terminology and \na few of its founding members learning a little about it in France, none of \nthe members spoke of or demonstrated any knowledge of the substance, theory \nand analysis present within the ideology. No works by Marx, Engels, Stalin \nor Mao were ever published in Khmer as well at the time. The Khmer Rouge \nwere enigmatic in this way, but for those familiar with Khmer culture and \nhistory, one would understand that the racial aspects and nationalism \nrepresented by the KR were very much home-grown sentiments. The Angkar (the \nOrganization) only assumed the title and imagery of Communism for a few \nshort years in order to gain foreign assistance, but all its members, by \ntheir own accounts, believed that the ideology of the Angkar was a \npatriotic and ethnic one, first and foremost. They had no idea what \ncommunism was, who Marx was or any of it. The Angkar was a Khmer creation \nand its policies reflected this. \n\nThis is similar in some ways to the Vietnamese attitude to communism in \nthat many Vietnamese had little understanding of what communism was and \nprimarily viewed it as a patriotic, pro-independence and pro-liberation \ntheme consistent with nationalism. Of course, Ho Chi Minh and many, many \nother Vietnamese DID understand communism and were fighting for it, but \nthey blended it with their wartime priorities. China and Russia experienced \nsimilar things as well in their struggles to claim their respective nations \nunder communist ideology. But the Khmer Rouge did not have that; in fact, \nthe Khmer Rouge were a large, nebulous and loose coalition of several major \nfactions during the war years. The only communists among them were those \nthat had been educated via exposure to Lao and Vietnamese cooperation, but \nthose fled or were murdered following the war in the ensuing power \nstruggles. This too is reflected by Cambodians over 35 to this day; in the \nbloody years of the Khmer Rouge's nightmarish reign, there was no mention, \nknowledge or understanding of communism. There was only the Angkar and the \nrevolution. It was highly secretive and aimed and starting the nation over \nfrom the bottom-up without contaminating elements of other cultures, \nethnicities or ideas. And ultimately, it was an attempt to recreate the \nAngkar people and empire of old; retaking lands from the Vietnamese and \nre-awakening centuries old feuds about territory and race. Thus, the Khmer \nRouge were not, and cannot be accurately referred to as anything like \ncommunism. \ufeff",
