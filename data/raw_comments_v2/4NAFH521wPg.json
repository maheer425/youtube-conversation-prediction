            "text": "This one seems simple enough.\n\nWhy it applies to Marine Animals: Because the force of water on the body of \na creature is relatively similar in all directions, that is to say, gravity \nonly affects pressure and not the ability to stay upright, or indeed the \nseverely diminished amount of force it takes to move an object in \nwater(Resistance or not, water, with a little help from buoyancy, allows \nyou to move big things with much less energy exerted. Try lifting a stone \nunderwater versus above it). All of this is to say, the objects in water \nCAN grow larger, because they have the relative space to do so, over time, \nand unlike land creatures, the only diminishing factor in their growth is \nsurvival and nutrition. Now, whether that nutrition is increasing or not \nseems to be easy to answer, if the vast majority of sea creatures are \ngetting bigger, it stands to reason that creatures from all levels of the \nfood chain are, creating a fun little chain reaction of sorts. Krill get a \nbit bigger, things that eat krill suddenly get more nutrients from eating a \nbunch and can get a bit bigger, etc, etc. \n\nNow, why it doesn't apply to Insects? Well, a large part of this is due to \nhow insect bodies work. See, if you increase the size of a bug, you don't \nnecessarily increase the strength of its joints. Which is to say, the \nbigger the bug gets, the harder it is for it to move. Notice that some bugs \nmay actually be getting bigger(Slugs, for instance), specifically, bugs \nthat grow in a seemingly equivalent line between their propulsion and their \nbody mass. However, walking and winged insects probably aren't going to \nexperience such a burst in growth. \n\nAll that having been said, if I recall correctly, we Have seen periods of \ninsect growth, and these periods are almost always punctuated by periods of \nhigh oxygenation. I could be wrong on this part, but I seem to recall \nreading of large carnivorous insects that would have been far, far tougher, \nand due to the amount of energy they were getting from the air alone, could \nkeep themselves sustained far, far easier.\ufeff",
