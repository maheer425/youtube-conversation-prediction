I have an inflamed sciatic nerve which \nmakes it hard to walk even a few steps, and I'm bedridden in constant pain. \nIt's predicted to last up to a year. One particularly hard day, I hit \nbottom. I cried out \"God, if you are there, help me.\" I decided that a \npriesthood blessing couldn't hurt. Our bishop and my husband gave me a \npowerful blessing, in which I was promised I would heal, and I should take \nthe time to become closer to my heavenly father. I started watching these \nmessages on youtube. When I saw this message, I was brought to tears. The \nknowledge that I'm not alone, that God is mindful of me, loves me, wants me \nto be happy, and is using this experience to make me a better person... \nKnowing that there is a purpose to this time of suffering, makes it a lot \neasier to bear. The promises made in my priesthood blessing, that I will \nheal, has taken away so much fear. I have since watched hours of conference \ntalks on youtube, have returned to church (even if I can only stay long \nenough to take the sacrament) and now have my temple recommend! The church \nhas such a deeper, more personal place in my life now than before I left \nit. Thank you, Mormon Channel, for messages like this one.\ufeff",

The fire heats the steel up to almost its \nbreaking point.  Why? Because that is the only why for the steel to be \nshaped into the tool that The Master needs it to be.  Trials are not put in \nour lives to punish us, rather to make us better than we ever thought was \npossible.  Trials are designed to bring us nearer to God, not drive us \naway.  Everything that the Almighty does has a purpose who's impact we \ncannot even imagine.  I testify to all those who read these words that God \nwould not have a man run faster than he is able, nor would He have him \ncarry more than he has strength.  God gives us these challenges so that we \nmay help our fellow man, be compassionate, and to grow more Christ-like.  I \nleave these things in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\ufeff",
