More people know about \nIBS, but there are many people that think it isn't a real thing. It's \ninternal and you can look all normal on the outside. People are not very \nsympathetic about it, especially jobs. It's a major reason I have never \ntraveled much. However, I can deal with the pain better with meditation and \nother things. Thank you for sharing! I can't see any reason why someone \nwould vote this down - just mean people I think. Stay your awesome \nwonderful self. \ufeff",
