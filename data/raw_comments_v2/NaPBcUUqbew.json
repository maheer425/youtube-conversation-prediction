It's true that \nthe US has much more incarcerated people on average than the \"world at \nlarge\" but it's also true that much more people OUGHT TO BE INCARCERATED IN \nTHE REST OF THE WORLD. The problem with his comparison is that it is the US \nversus the World - some places in the world will vastly skew the numbers as \na result because lawlessness is OUT OF CONTROL there. Significant examples? \nMexico, India, many nations in Africa, the Middle East (how about the \nthousands of criminals in Al Queda, Hamas and IS), South America (Brazil is \nan easy eg.) and South East Asia. Some are worse than others obviously. \nIncredible lawlessness in the corrupt government itself is a problem in \nmany of those countries which is why lawlessness in the country outside \ngovernment is severe.\n\nThe fact is, we've decreased crime tremendously and people don't get away \nwith crime in the US NO WHERE NEAR as they could have 20-30 years ago. If \nyou murder someone, with enough time (usually a 48hr limit for detectives), \nthey will find you. Explanations for increased incarceration? Improved \ncrime investigation science (DNA, face identification software from videos \nindividuals etc) and government surveillance (technology etc).\n\nIf anything, increased incarceration is a news flash to many people that \n\"humanity\" is not as \"good\" as they wish it was.\n\nIf they want something to compare the US to, it must be a nation of similar \nsize and of similar resources to sustain law enforcement. Maybe one could \ncompare it to certain European Nations (or Australia) or multiple ones. \nPerhaps you should have a resource to size ratio. Many, many factors ought \nto be considered beyond this poor explanation.

            "text": "+Adam Satchwell\n\n1. both\n\n2. i do not care about incarceration rates.  i care about crime rates and \nre-offender rates.  Crime rates are on the decline which is good, but \nre-offender rates are on the rise, which i blame on the fact that our \nprisons are introducing more and more rehabilitation into the prison \nsystem.  which is why i would rather see a separation from the two.\n\n3.  having a family with addiction and drug problems, i can say for \ncertainty that Marijuana IS dangerous.  there ARE long term side effects, \nand it IS a gateway drug.  I would rather see the Marijuana plant wiped off \nthe face of the earth, but since that is unrealistic, i believe there \nshould be harsher laws against it.\n\n4.  I believe if a person truly could not control their actions, then they \nshould not be punished.  However, that does not mean letting them have \nopportunity to do those actions again.  People like charles manson however \nCAN control their actions.  Even if they are sick, and compelled to murder, \nthey still had the choice not to.  it is a thin line.  \n\n5.  If sexsomnia was a real thing and i had it, it would be my personal \nresponsibility to ensure i did not hurt other people.  If that means \nsleeping hand-cuffed to my bed, i would do it.  the problem is the people \nthat take no measures, commit crimes, and then blame their illness, \nexpecting to get off.  \n\n6.  You are really stuck on people with illnesses here, which is NOT the \ntopic of this discussion.  As far as people who are not sick, but still \ncommit crimes, every crime they commit is a violation of some other person \nrights.  It is obvious they have no regard for the rights of other people, \nso why should they be afforded any rights while they are being punished? \n Show them what they are doing to their victims.  empathy is a powerful \ntool.\n\n7.  yes we are using the word humane in different ways.  i am using the \nword as defined, while you are using the word as some hippy PETA activist \nwould.  I can humanely euthanize my sick and dying dog.  the dog dies \nquickly and peacefully in it's sleep, rather than living on in pain waiting \nto die naturally. Or i could inhumanely take the dog out in the back yard \nand beat it with a baseball bat until it finally dies.  do you see the \ndifference there?  you can humanely execute a convicted murderer, so that \nthey die peacefully and painlessly in their sleep, rather than living on as \na burden to the rest of the population.  that burden can be mental, in that \nthe victims of their acts can, and often are, mentally scarred and scared, \nknowing that the person that caused them so much harm is still alive, and \nmay get released some day.  that burden can also be financial, in that the \npublic has to now pay for this individual to live the rest of their lives \nin prison.  The burden can also be physical in that those individuals often \nkill again in prison, or are released eventually and kill again.  The world \nas a whole is better off without them.  \n\n8.  It is more important that people are punished for their crimes, even if \nonly as a solace to the victims of those crimes.  If somebody raped and \nkilled your mother, would you only want them to serve 15 years in a \ncomfortable room as long as they promise to never rape and kill again?  is \nthat all your mother was worth?  Besides, as i already pointed out, crime \nin the US is falling drastically.  this is mostly due to other factors \noutside of the prison system, so it is a non-issue in this discussion.  We \nare talking about re-offender rates, and i have already given my opinion \nseveral times about it.  Harsher prison conditions and a separate optional \nrehabilitation facility available to ex-cons once they serve their \nsentence.  ",

Do you think america would be better if it \nrelaxed its marijuana laws and had fewer people in jail? Or do you think it \nwould be better for all the other countries to becomes tougher on marijuana \nand increase their incarceration rates?\n\n\nDo you think its a good idea to punish people for things they could not \ncontrol? Can you blame someone for being sick if they had no control over \nwhether they became sick? And if someone is sick and would kill many \npeople, you dont punish them by making their life miserable, you try and \ntreat them as humanely as possible whilst restricting their ability to harm \nothers. This will probably involve removing their freedom whilst trying to \nmake their lives as cushty as possible and trying to treat them like \nindividuals rather than as a criminal (see: treating people humanely).\n\n\nLets imagine that sexsomnia is real and that you have it and you genuinely \nhave no control over what you do whilst you're asleep. It would be wrong to \npunish you for something you can't control. More importantly though we cant \nleave everybody else at risk of harm of being raped. So we would restrict \nyour freedom and liberties whilst not actually punishing you. Obviously \nhaving your liberties curbed is unpleasant so we try and make your life as \ncomfortable and normal as possible, and if you can be helped, try to \nrehabilitate you. \n\n\nIm not against the curbing of liberties if it is in everyones best \ninteresting. You don't let blind people drive you dont let 12 year olds \ndrink and you dont let psychopaths wander the streets, It doesnt mean any \nof them need punishing though, you only take away the rights needed to keep \neveryone else safe, you dont start taking away extra rights as a punishment \nfor something you could never control in the first place, and you certainly \ndont execute someone to solve the problem. It would be wrong to execute \nsomeone for something they didnt control, that is an inhumane thing to do. \n\n\nIt makes as much sense to say you can humanely execute someone as it does \nto say you can humanely rape or torture someone. Execution is not thing \nthat can be done humanely, not in the way you are suggesting: as a \npunishment or as an alternative to a life sentence with no chance of \nrehabilitation. We are using the word humane in very different ways I fear. \n\n\nWould you support 'rewarding' criminals if on the whole it produced less \nrape and murder in the world? Or would you rather a world where there was \nmore rape and murder and more punishment? If it was demonstrated that crime \nwould decrease if criminals were 'rewarded' (comfortable place to live, \nfree of charge) would you be OK with rewarding criminals? Or is it more \nimportant that criminals are punished rather than actually lowering crime. \n\n\nNote that Im using 'rewarded' in the way you were: giving some a \ncomfortable place to live, free of charge and removing their freedom and \nliberty. Im not talking about actually rewarding with money and job and car \nand freedom every time they commit a murder.",

            "text": "+Adam Satchwell no.  i won't spit statistics your way because there are far \ntoo many involved for a simple Youtube debate.  which has been my point. \n you can NOT just look at 1 or 2 statistics and use them as evidence that \nan entire system is flawed.  There are simply too many factors involved to \nmake such a stupid accusation.  \n\nI will explain what i mean in an easier to understand example.  \n\nImagine a police officer is assigned a territory in a major city to patrol. \n that officer makes arrests, and gives traffic tickets on a daily basis. \n One day, the police commissioner looks at this officers records and \nnotices that 80% of his arrests and tickets have been to black people. \n Using that statistic, he calls the officer in to his office, accuses him \nof racism, and fires the officer.  Does that seem fair?  Afterall, the \nstatistics clearly show the officer arrests FAR more black people than \nwhite, in a city where the population is 60% white, 15% black, 15% latino \nand 20% other races.  Seems like an open and shut case of racism to most \npeople.  The statistics don't lie right?  Except that there is more to \nconsider.  the fact that the officer was assigned a territory for example, \nso he was unable to make arrests anywhere outside of that territory, and \nthe fact that while the entire city has a black population of only 15%, \nthat specific area the officer was assigned to had housing projects which \nhoused 70% of the black people in the city.  So the cop was just doing his \njob in an area that was almost 3/4 black people, making it obvious that \nmost of his arrests would be on black people.  \n\nSo as you can see, listing of 1 or 2 or even 3 statistics and using them to \nform a wide sweeping conclusion about something as complicated as the \njustice and punishment system of an entire country, is STUPID at best.\n\nI never said there was something wrong with American culture, society, or \nanything of the sort.  I simply said there are differences between \ncountries, with no mention of one being better or worse than others.  You \nare trying to straw man me.  \n\ni also did not say that American culture creates more criminals that other \ncountries.  I was pointing out how the differences in cultures can lead to \nhigher incarceration rates, based on things like what laws people are \njailed for in countries.  I gave the example of Singapore.  Instead of \nsending people to prison, they whip them with a cane.  If Singapore did not \nwhip people, but sent them to jail, their incarceration rate would likely \nmatch or exceed that of the US.  There are also things like the US will \njail a person for possession of marijuana, increasing the incarceration \nrate more than countries that do not send people to jail for the same \ncrime.  With marijuana use widespread throughout the world, that alone is a \nhuge difference in incarceration rates.  and by cultural differences, i did \nnot mean America as a whole, but rather the smaller individual cultures \nthat exist within America.  Black culture in the inner city project housing \nis notorious for breeding criminals.  Latino culture in the southwest leads \nto other sorts of crimes simply because what they were doing was legal in \nmexico, but not legal in the US, and also because some latino cultures do \nnot get along with other latino cultures, leading to confrontations.  there \nare also white cultures that have their share of issues as well. \n\nI bet you would be surprised to learn that as a whole, the US has a lower \noverall crime rate than Britain.  \n\nAnd don't be stupid.  There are humane and inhumane ways of executing a \nperson.  It can either be over quickly and painlessly, or it can take time \nand be excruciatingly painful. \n\nAs far as rehab, i have already stated my position on this.  If you want \nrehab, then do it separately from the punishment.  the very reason the US \nhas a higher re-offender rate is BECAUSE for the last 50+ years the US has \nbeen trying to force rehabilitation into the prison system, and every year \nthe numbers get worse.  The prison system and the rehabilitation system \nhave to be two different entities in order to work properly.  \n\nCharles Manson and Jeffery Dhalmer are not sick.  they are evil.  I know it \nmust seem like they must be mentally ill in order to do the things they \ndid, but that is not the case.  they are just bad people.   And even if \nthey were sick, SO WHAT?  Of what benefit is it to ANYBODY to keep them \nalive?  they aren't going to ever not be sick, they will always be \nmurderers.  If you can't reconcile with executing somebody who has killed \n20+ people and would do it again, then how could you reconcile locking them \nin prison for their entire lives?  Either way it is punishing the sick is \nit not?\n\nI would rather live in a world where criminals are punished for their \ncrimes, and once they accept and serve their sentence, they can choose \nthemselves to go into rehab to better their lives.  But under no \ncircumstances would i condone a system that rewards a person with a \ncomfortable place to live, free of charge, and works to improve their \nlives, all because they killed or raped or otherwise infringed on the \nrights of another human being.

            "text": "+Adam Satchwell\nincarceration rates and conviction rates are entirely different things. \n Japan currently has a 99% conviction rate while the US has a 95% \nconviction rate.  This just means that more people who deserve punishment, \nwhether that be jail time, community service, or just a fine, are getting \npunishment.  Incarceration rates are the number of people who are actually \nsent to prison.  so yes, i was right about conviction rates. \n\nAs far as incarceration rates go, you can't just look at one statistic and \nsay \"well there's your problem!\".  countries are different.  Different \ncultures, different laws, and different ways of dealing with things.  Much \nof the US prosecutes and sends people to jail for buying, using, or selling \nmarijuana.  It is illegal.  But other countries do not.  That will affect \nincarceration rates.  In Singapore the incarceration rate is 1/3 that of \nthe US, but they also beat people with a cane rather than send them to \nprison, which in the US would be unconstitutional.  I imagine if we used \ncaning as punishment for our lesser crimes, our incarceration rate would be \nmuch lower.  Comparing countries on this ONE statistic and using it to say \none country is better or worse than another is fundamentally stupid.  \n\nabout re-offending rates..  allow me to clarify my statement.  \"*With all \nelse being equal*, 1st world countries with comfy prisons will have higher \nre-offending rates.\"  But as i just pointed out, all else is not equal. \n There are other considerations to take into account.  the nature of the \ncrimes being committed (for example, bicycle theft is MUCH more rampant in \nEngland than the US) time served for specific crimes, even the culture of \nthe people committing the crimes (much more peer pressure to re-offend in \nsome cultures) and any number of other factors.  All of which can be \ndeterred with harsher conditions in prison facilities.  \n\nI did not argue about the death penalty. I argued about cushy prison \nconditions.  there is a HUGE difference between living in uncomfortable \nconditions and being forced to work hard manual labor for 20 years, vs \nliving is relative comfort for 10-15 years then being humanely executed at \nthe end of it.  Also, the death penalty is not used in every case of \nmurder, only the more severe cases.  Most murders are a crime of passion, \nunplanned and committed in the heat of the moment with no time to think of \nconsequences.  Personally i am not a huge fan of the death penalty, only \nbecause on occasion an innocent person can be executed.  but for somebody \nlike Charles Manson, or Jeffry Dhalmer?  What purpose is there is letting \nsomebody like that continue to live? \n\nAnd i agree.  the US spends too much on prisoners.  \n\nYes, as i've pointed out already, there are differences between people in \nNorway and the US, cultural, geographical, political, social, and economic \ndifferences.  Not to mention things that always contribute to crimes rates \nsuch as population density.  Countries are different.  \n\nExplain how a cushy life in prison equates to lower re-offender rates. \n Don't just spit statistics that fit your preconceived notions either, \nactually explain the process.

            "text": "+Kur Norock\n\nYou claim that first world countries will have higher conviction rates due \nto having less corruption/better policing but this is just wrong. Iceland, \nJapan and Denmark are all first world countries but per 100000 only 44, 63 \nand 66 people are incarcerated respectively. In the USA it is 753 per \n100000. \n\n\nThe top ten reoffending countries list includes USA, Rwanda, Belize, \nKhazakstan, Cuba and Russia. So yeah, your wrong that first would countries \nwill just naturally have higher crime rates, it seems to actually be the \nopposite. \n\n\nAlso your idea that when people know they will be punished they are less \nlikely to commit a crime is wrong. For example in America states with the \ndeath penalty have 18% higher murder rates than states without the death \npenalty. \n\n\nAlso, you claim that for every one reoffender there are 'dozens of people \nwho never have to go back' but this is just wrong. Statistics suggest \nbetween 60-70% of prisoners in America reoffend. So actually for every 3 \npeople who never go back there are 7 people who do. \n\n\nAlso your idea that harsher prison conditions will result in fewer people \n'wanting' to go to jail is wrong. In Norway an average of 283 Euros is \nspent on each prisoner per day, more than America, and prisoners enjoy \ngreater comfort, food, conditions and amenities, there is no death penalty, \nno solitary confinement and no life imprisonment, with I believe a maximum \nsentence is 21 years (from memory might be wrong.) Yet the conviction rate \nis only 70 per 100000, compared to Americas 753 per 100000.\n\n\nThe American system is also costly, it costs on average 117 Euros per \nprisoner per day in the England, where reoffender rates are at 50%, \ncompared to 259 Euros per prisoner per day in the USA, where reoffender \nrates are at 70%. So you spend of twice as much per prisoner and have an \nextra 20% reoffend, winning. \n\n\n\nIn Norway statistics suggest that only 20-30% of prisoners reoffend, and \nonly 70 per 100000 are incarcerated. Compare this to Americas 70% \nreoffender rate and 753 per 100000 incarcerated. \n\n\nSo do you think there is some innate difference between Americans and \nNorwegians that just makes Americans more likely to commit crime and \nreoffend? Or do you think the way Norway deals with crime and punishment \nmight be the reason why so few reoffend?\n\n\nIf you want a suggest for how the number of incarcerated and reoffender \nrates could be reduced have a google into how Norwegians treat their \nprisoners. I suspect you wont be a fan, despite the fact that all the \nevidence suggest the Norwegian is better. Probably because you like having \nangry negative thoughts about prisoners because it makes you feel more \nsecure in your angry little oh no my street is closed world. \n\n\nSo: Americas system is costly, has the highest prison population, doesn't \nact as deterrent and has one of the worst reoffender rates= failed policy, \nOr Americas are naturally criminals. Somehow I blame the failed policy.",

            "text": "+Blake Gale Your entire comment would make me laugh if it wasn't so sadly \nignorant.  \n\nPeople that go to prison are still people.  they still have brains, they \nstill have a way to look after themselves when they get out.  It is not our \nresponsibility to punish somebody, and then hold their hand and guide them \nthrough life.  That's basically like saying \"hey, if you commit a crime, \nwe'll lock you up for a while, but them once you get out, your life is \nset!\"  You would have people rushing to commit crimes and get locked up \njust for the benefits that come with being released.  \n\nThe kind of prison system i want is the kind that punishes people that \ncommit crimes.  It doesn't have to cost $31k a year per prisoner.  that is \nwhat it costs now because of all the shitty failed rehabilitation programs \nand cable tv and internet access and everything else people like you have \nforced the government to provide for the criminals of our society.  There \nis no reason it shouldn't only cost $5k-$10k a year to house a criminal. \n they gave up their rights when they committed the crime.  they shouldn't \nget internet and TV and 3 meals a day. \n\nSo yes, i do believe the prison system would work MUCH better if it was run \nlike it was 100 years ago.  Make prison a place you DON'T want to go. \n these days prisons are almost as nice as summer camps.  It is no wonder \nthere are so many people that aren't afraid to go to prison.  There are \nrepeat offenders because it is no big deal to go back to prison.  I have an \nuncle (by marriage) that goes to prison on purpose because he doesn't want \nto have a job.  Every time he gets out, he gets a DUI on purpose just so he \ncan go back in and get free food and a roof over his head.  Maybe if prison \nwas a worse place than real life, he wouldn't be a willing life long \nprisoner.  \n\nand again, yes, going to prison is about being removed from society.. so \nyeah, take them from their families.  That is what visitation is for.  it \nisn't for the inmates, it is for the families of the inmates.  And hell \nyes, make the prisoners work.  all day long.  shitty menial tasks like \ndigging ditches and breaking rocks, just like in the old cartoons.  the \nprisoners that have lesser crimes can be put to work cleaning litter off \nthe roads, or whatever else.  \n\nand be hostile to prisoners.  Show criminals that they have no place in \nmodern society.  show them that if they want to act like animals, they will \nbe treated like animals.  Lock them in a cage, make them work for their \nfood, and if they get out of line, punish them for it.  \n\nAs far as i am concerned prisoners should only get one shower a week, (2 in \nthe summer) two small meals a day totaling 1800 calories (as bland as \npossible) only water to drink, and they should work hard manual labor for \n12 hours a day 6 days a week to earn their food and shelter. No pay,  No \nTV, no internet, no weight lifting equipment, no candy bars, no cigarettes, \nno personal items.  If they aren't working, they are in their cell with \nnothing to do.  One day a week they get \"free time\" (which can be taken \naway for any reason) in which they don't have to go to work.  during this \ntime they can read books, or go outside, that's it.  \n\nyou live like that for 2 years and tell me you are going to get out and \nre-offend.
