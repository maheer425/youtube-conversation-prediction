Darwin's own \"race\" he called Caucasoid were the supremely evolved \nones. At the time the world's most important real scientist, Louis Pasteur \nsaid Darwin's idea was rubbish not worthy to be even called a theory. It is \nstill rubbish today but it doesn't stop those who either want to keep \nracism propped up or just avoid dealing with God from making it the \nofficial religion of the day.

The stupid weed study is mentioend EVERYWHERE as evidence of racism. \nThat this is the best they can do, proves that liberals are desperate to \npoint to examples of racism. The evidence that Blacks use the same \nmarijuana amounts as Whites is based on SELF REPORTING, the most inaccurate \nform of getting information, of a 3000 person survey. With 30% of Black \nmales at some point of the correctional system, their chances of lying to \nthe census is atronomically higher. Also, documented studies show blacks \nare 6X more likely to lie about drug use than whites \nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1093/jurban/jti065\n3.)

Not only am i smarter than any full blooded white \nperson i have met i am also better looking. In fact the only people i have \nmet that are smarter than me, were native american. I just love the fact \nthat your white women salivate over me because i am mixed. Not only are you \nmaking white people look bad but you are making racists look bad. Jeez i \nthought you would at least have some good material but, no. What should i \nexpect form a white person though? Your whole argument is just going to be \nracist mom jokes and tired ole \"jewsdidit\" cliche's. I can already see it \nthe next thing you're gonna say is that i am inferior and i should \nsterilize myself, plus my mom is a whore and blacks are stupid. How cliche \ncan you be?\n\nEDIT: in conclusion White people are not the sole creators of modern \nsociety and only had a part in building the world around us, not only are \ncolder environments not harsher than hot ones, they may also even be easier \nto live in. I\"m waiting for the evidence that whites are superior? The only \nthing you have left is IQ scores and honestly those are the easiest for me \nto debunk.",

Yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white \nman showed him its glittering light. His land swarmed with powerful and \ndocile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart, or sled. A hunter by \nnecessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving \nbeyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an \nhour. in a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved \na block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud. With league on \nleague of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he \nwatched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf \non his beach, the howl of the storm overheard, gazed upon the dim blue \nhorizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a \nsail.\"\n\nSettles the case pretty nicely. But to add, the conclusion that Hitler shot \nhimself was drawn by the results of a single British investigator who \ndidn't even have access to the bunker. It's been widely discounted as \nfalse, Hitler's fate remains a mystery, as it was in the years following \nWWII.

I mean the way \npeople behave comes mostly from the circumstances in which they're raised \nand the way they're raised by their parents. So if a large portion of \nMexican families in America for example came from Mexico poor and living in \nthe \"ghetto\", then their children are likely to act like the people who are \npoor and live in the \"ghetto\" to. And most people of African decent in \nAmerica came from people who were brought from Africa as being slaves with \nno rights, and then had to deal with poverty and racism even when they \nweren't slaves anymore. They probably had to live in the \"ghetto\", and as \nsuch made their children more likely to act \"ghetto\" to.\n\nAnother factor could be that the people of African or Mexican decent in \nAmerica are still kind of living in the poor conditions their parents lived \nin. I mean it's not the easiest thing to get out of being poor.\n\nI\"m not trying to be racist here, I'm just throwing out ideas. Seriously, \nI'm DEFINITELY NOT racist, as some of the coolest people I've met are of \nMexican and African decent.\ufeff",

People are more prone to react to \"scandals\" like the former owner \nof the Clippers (I think it was the clippers, I don't really follow \nbasketball.) People got up in arms about it because there was a clear \nperpetrator of the \"racism\" and we were able to punish him because of it. \nAnd once the \"racism\" was defeated, we felt good because we had \"won\" and \nracism had \"lost\" even though, in the big picture, this was a minor \nincident and nothing had truly been gained from it. It's less a \"White \npeople hate black people, which is bad\" issue, it's more an issue of \nchoosing the wrong battles.
