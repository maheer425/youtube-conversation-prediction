I had a budgie named \nSam who was very untamed and was rescued with a very deadly illness, and we \ntried our best to treat it. However, being the first time owning a bird we \nwould \"naturally\" be uncomfortable around him, especially holding. So the \nfact that we had to give Sammy medicine from a syringe every day was \nrather- no, extremely frightening. Slowly, we saw life from his point of \nview. Think of it this way.\n\nYou've just been forced out of a cage with all your friends, slammed shut \nin a dark box with holes to breathe from, thrown into a cage with these \nreally large creatures with weird eyes in the wrong place and have four \nlegs, not to mention no feathers.\n\nI'd be pretty petrified too, and if I had to rely on my only weapon, say my \nbeak, I would. I think you'd bite whoever placed their hand in your home if \nyou were in this situation too.\n\nI soon learnt his little bites didn't hurt anyway, also finding out more \nabout the little guy as time went on. I pretty much just started off making \nhim calmer around me, my voice and the human ways, introduced my hand, let \nhim become calmer around my hand, soon he didn't mind it. Then, get a small \nCLEAN plastic spoon and put some seeds in it, offering it to him. Do NOT \nstarve him before this because, well, birds are never full -_- anyway, just \nmake sure she nibbles the seeds and he'll eat happily after a bit. Then, \nyour hand. This takes a lot of bravery and trust from both sides, just make \nsure you aren't petrified out of your mind, know that he won't attack. He \nmay be uncomfortable and jump away but that means he isn't use to your hand \nyet. Soon he'll eat and you won't be so nervous. Then, let him out of the \ncage... Yes, this is scary for both him and you. He'll be dying to come out \nthough after he realises there's a bigger cage outside his small one. Then, \nyou can calmly put him on your shoulder, knee, wherever. You'll see he \nwon't bite your ear or hurt you all. Just make sure you know the room is \nsafe.\n\nHope I helped :)",

Im not much for disturbing them in the cage, \nbut outside of the cage is my territory and my rules. Noticed when they \nkiss and love eachother they also fight a little?

They are social like when I take a branch inside the \ncage to make one sit on it and he keeps flying away then one of my other \nbirds get angry and jumps on the branch, the same when I try to take one \nout. I have a very light branch and its perfect for taming and disiplining \nbudgies. I even hit them with it, it doesnt hurt really and they get the \nmessage right away! After a few days even the most wild budgie will jump on \nit in a matter of seconds, it should get used to it, love it, bite it, and \nI read they should stay on your finger for 20 minutes every day and twice a \nday, the other two budgies are also not tame but used to hands, and when \ntheyre out of the cage I go for one of them until it jumps on it then on my \nhand filled with seed, then the other one and after a while they will begin \neating..
