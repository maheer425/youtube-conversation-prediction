I really hope I can find a way \nto deal with this, as I really want to help kids and not hold them behind. \nHowever, I'm really creative, so I always find something that will deviate \npeople from noticing how dumb I am, with my spelling. Another thing that I \ndo in order to \"sound smart\" in front of  people, is that I write down \nfancy words.Yet, just like my formula to remember my spelling, I forget \nwhat those words mean, in a matter of days.

I didn't care if I lived or died at that point. \nIt was January of 2011 and I almost over dosed on some ecstasy pills. I \nremember looking at myself in a mirror and asking God for help. I went to \nchurch that following Sunday and it felt so good to just be there. I \nlistened to the surmen and it hit home so starting changing my life from \nthat point on. I don't go to church anymore I think I just wanted to feel \nconnected to god and now I know that our creater is within all of us at all \ntimes. I feel like everyone has to go through some shit so that you can \nrealize who you truly are and that Is anything you want to be. You're only \nlimited by your beliefs but it's taken me years to get where I am today. \nReprogramming my mind with just positive thinking. Every day I repeat \nafermations that change all the years of shame, embarrassment and \nself-doubt. And Google has helped a lot too... lol the best advice I can \ngive you is to find the things that make you feel a live and do them as \nmuch as you possibly can.",
