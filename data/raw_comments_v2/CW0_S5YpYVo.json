I also \napologise in advance if the formatting is bad; YouTube has a stupid habit \nof deleting white space.\n\nGravitational potential energy is a type of energy known as 'potential \nenergy'. This energy is caused by an objects position in a force field \n(that is, a field that applies a force) \u2014 in the specific example of the \nEarth, that force field is gravity, caused by massive objects wanting to be \nnear each other. Your body is held together by the electric potential \nenergy of electrons and protons, and the nuclei are held together by their \nnuclear potential energy. The reason we don't go flying off the surface of \nthe Earth is because it requires energy to do so. Our position in the \n'force field' that is Earth's gravity gives us a potential energy (relative \nto infinity) of \u20136*10^7 J/kg. This means that we need 6E7 J to fling a \nsingle kilogram off the Earth (this is why space travel is so hard).\n\nHowever, all I've done is offload the question \u2014 the next reasonable \nquestion would be 'how does the gravitational force field work?', and the \nanswer to that would be 'because that's the way the Universe works.' It is \na property of matter that it attracts other matter, and while we have \npossible explanations for this ranging from the very fabric of space-time \nbeing distorted to tiny gravitons carrying a gravitational charge, \nproviding those answers only moves the 'because that's the way the Universe \nworks' back one step farther.\n\nOne can easily imagine a Universe where there is no gravity, or where \ngravity can be repulsive, or where gravity goes down by the inverse cube of \ndistance \u2014 gravity seems to work as it does as a fundamental property of \nthe Universe.",

In general this \nprocess takes energy.If you mean 'atom' in the sense of 'atomic nucleus', \nit depends on the nucleus! A large nucleus (generally larger than iron, \nwith some small exceptions) when pulled apart will release energy -- this \nis because it has more mass as a giant nucleus than the two smaller nuclei \ndo combined. For a *stable* nucleus smaller than iron, it will take energy \nto pull apart, because the individual pieces have more mass than the \ncombined nucleus. For *unstable* nuclei lighter than iron, it releases \nenergy for the same reason as the large nuclei.",

            "text": "+Palvan Bekdurdiyev There are two types of radiation, ionising and \nnon-ionising. The most common form of non-ionising radiation is \nelectromagnetic, and it can have various impacts on our body, ranging from \n'none' (e.g. radio waves), to heating us up (e.g. infrared light) to \nstimulating chemical transitions enabling us to see (visible \nlight).'Ionising radiation' comes in two general forms -- particle and \nelectromagnetic -- but both affect our body in the same way. They possess \nenough energy to knock an electron off an atom in our body, which makes \nthat atom incredibly chemically reactive. For some atoms (such as the ones \non the surface of your skin), this doesn't really matter, but if it's an \natom in DNA it can damage something important for cellular function and \ntrigger cell death or rampant cell growth (cancer).The ionising \nelectromagnetic radiation are ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays, while the \nionising particle radiation tends is either charged particles such as \nprotons, electrons or positrons, or neutral particles (neutrons). Charged \nparticles are much easier to stop because they're much likely to react with \nsomething (like the air or a sheet of paper) before they reach you.",
