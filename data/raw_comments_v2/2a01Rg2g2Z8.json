Bush is probably the most \nhated president in history at least recent history. I am not saying that \nAmerica is not at fault...I'm saying that \"America\" is not what you think \nit is. The \"America\" that invaded Iraq was haliburton, boeing, lockheed \nmartin, and yes those COUNTLESS OTHER COUNTRIES!

From the the Vietnam war to the 1973 military coup in Chile, funded \nby the USA, you americans have been blindly supporting economic motivated \nwars which have always ended with the deaths of countless civilians, and \nmore often than not accusations of crimes against humanity.\n\nYou're right, i meant ISIS, although the Taliban have sent fighters to \nsupport ISIS in Iraq. You can route for change as a nation, instead of \nignorantly supporting every foreign war that comes into sight. But then \nagain the culture in america is so backwards you can't even let go of \nyour second amendment bullshit.\n\nI am angry with my own government for allowing Blair to make a deal with \nBush to go to war. Many people in the UK campaigned against the war but \nunfortunately the greed of Blair and his buddies wasn't going to be \ndiscouraged.
