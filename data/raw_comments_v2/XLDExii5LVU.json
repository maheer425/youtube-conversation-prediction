They can easily snap \nif something like a bird flys through them and if your little Cookie \nMonster runs across the road you won't be able to pull her back.(well you \ncould but that could hurt her back real bad) Where I live you can get these \nspecial leashes called training leashes.They usually have an adustable \nhandle which converts to a strap that goes around your shoulder.They are \nvery strong and durable even if your pup chews the leash.It works well with \nmy 13 kilo pup!\ufeff",
