So \nthen at age 20 I started going out with my first girlfriend, Tang Shen, who \nwas totally gorgeous and then she married me. And Saki was like, weirdly \njealous of me. Like if I would blow him off to hang out with Tang Shen, \nhe\u2019d be like 'why didn\u2019t you train with me?!' And I\u2019d be like, 'Uh, why are \nyou so obsessed with me?' So then for my birthday party, which was an all \nHamato Clan party, I was like, 'Saki I can\u2019t invite you because I think \nyou\u2019re a Foot Clan Member.' I mean, I couldn\u2019t have a Foot Clan member at \nmy party! There were going to be Hamatos there in their training suits! I \nmean right, he was a Foot! So then his dad called my dad and started \nyelling at himself, because we both had the same dad, and it was so \nretarded. And then he dropped out of the Hamato Clan because no one would \ntalk to him and he came back in the fall for revenge and his hair was all \ncut off and he was totally weird and now I guess he wants to kill me.\"\ufeff",
