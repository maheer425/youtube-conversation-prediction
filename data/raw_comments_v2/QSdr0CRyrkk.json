Being a nerd fighter holds no age restriction. In fact being a nerd \nfighter requires being a grown up in ways of thinking and understanding \nsociety. When you said I hope \"I can still be a nerd fighter\" it brought me \nback to when you said \"if you want to be a nerd fighter, you probably are \none\" As long as you have a desire to make the world better you are a \nnerdfighter, even if you do injure your shoulder celebrating your video \ngame achievements. As long as you are yourself, even if you are old (which \nyou are not) you will forever be one the greatest nerdfighters of all\nI would say DFTBA, however I feel that awesomeness is intrinsic to your \nnature therefore forgetting to be awesome is not a problem for you.
