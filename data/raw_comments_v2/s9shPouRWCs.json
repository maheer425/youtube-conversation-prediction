Another \nsort of synonym, is the word \"s\u00f6t\" which means \"sweet\" and also \"cute\" \nwhich has sort of become the same way for me\n\nHowever, when I learned and used the word \"cute\" I associated this word \nwith other things, and thus making this word a word I am much more \ncomfortable to use, and will even if I shouldn't replace the word \"gullig\" \nwith \"cute\" even if I am speaking Swedish.  \n\nAnd in general I feel it easier to express myself in english then in \nswedish in various situations, but mostly I feel more comfortable with \nenglish, regardless of how good or bad I am at the language itself.\ufeff",
