The reason why he's becoming famous is, in my \nopinion, because of the music industry currently existing in Indonesia and \nthe people's outlook on music in Indonesia. Indonesia's music industry is \ncrap, for the most part. It's focused entirely on business only. Barry \nproved that he could change that with his limited knowledge of bass \nplaying. Barry also uses music styles that are unfamiliar to the Indonesian \npopulation's ears as a way of expressing himself. Barry also has a desire \nto let the talented Indonesian musicians shine in front of the people and \nlet them get the props that they deserve.\n\nAs an Indonesian bass player, I find that he's leading a revolution in the \nIndonesian music industry and the common stereotypes given to the \nIndonesian people, and that's what makes him worthy of a TED talk.",
