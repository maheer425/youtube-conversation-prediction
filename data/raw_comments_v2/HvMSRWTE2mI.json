            "text": "I'd love to know more about the Theory behind this method, and how it \nrelates to the Fermat test. In other words, how come it works, and what it \nsays about primeness. I've always liked the name of the Sieve of \nEratosthenes, because that's essentially what prime numbers are: unfilled \nholes in the whole number line. Think of a number line stretching to \ninfinity. It starts out unmarked. So you mark off 1 to get started. Then \nyou begin with the multiples. Mark off all the multiples of 2 up to \ninfinity. The next unmarked integer will be prime, in this case, 3. Mark \noff very multiple of 3 up to infinity. Again, the next hole in the line, 5, \nis prime. Mark off every multiple of 5. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Now, \nof course you can't actually do this mechanical thing (but possibly a \nquantum computer could do). So instead, by Eratosthenes' method, you \nattempt to divide each number by all the primes that precede it, and if it \nis indivisible by all the primes, it is prime. Now along comes Fermat and \nthis new test, which both still require divisibility to be tested, but they \nsignificantly enhance the process, but do they point to a possible \nalgorithm that could generate primes? For example, input the highest known \nprime, out comes the next prime... Sadly, no. I would be interested to \ndiscover whether it has been established that no such algorithm is \npossible, and if not, why not.\ufeff",
