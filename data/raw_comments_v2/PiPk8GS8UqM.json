When i Press the button on my Dryer to \nstart, He Literally, Perfectly mimics the exact frequency of the beep, i \nsometimes can't tell if it's the dryer or not, i've had times when i was in \na hurry i press the dryer button and i thought it was ON, i come back an \nhour later, the clothes are still wet.  LOL\nthen He Mimics the Creak in the toiler door,\ni then put some WD-40 on and fixed the issue, but i sometimes thing it came \nback, but , it actually didn't , Rocky (my Bird) feels the need to make the \nCreaking noise everytime you enter or leave the toilet LOL\nand then there's the air con,  When you press the button on the remote, he \nmimics the beep perferctly,  it really gets confusing\nthen.. He has copied the way we laugh (me and the wife), so sometimes when \nwe are laughing, so does he, and we can't tell if it's us or them, it all \nsounds the same\n\nAmazing BIrds,  You literally say something to him once, and he gets it,\nHe may not say it right away,\nbut.. in a few days it comes out.\n\nhe used to bite me hard when he was younger, and i used to point my finger \nand say STOP,  STOP ROCKY\nMy wife used to watch our arguments\nRocky has learnt to now say  STOP to me\nin a way it's good, because if he bites too hard, i say  STOP and now he \ndoes\nbut, if i play with him to long, he gets pissed off and bites gently, and \nif i don't stop he just comes out and says  STOP\nit's really cool\nLOL\nso.. after a pain staking experience , we now have a little language thing \ngoing on\nand he doesn't bite anymore\n\nI've lately taught him to take a shit in the morning IN THE TOILET BOWL, \nbelieve it or not\nand it works,\nHe actually, if he can't take a crap,, He actually tries really hard to \ntake a crap, because he feels proud to have done so in the toilet bowl\n\nsomes a very small drop comes out,\nbut hey.. You gotta praise him for it, He puts in so much effort to squeeze \nit out\n\nCute Little Bugger, But very smart indeed\ni recommend Rainbow Lorikeets to anyone\n\nbut.. keep in mind\nthey require  A LOT OF ATTENTION\nThey take a shit every 15 mins or so,  Literally  Every 15 mins (think \nabout it)\nso.. teach him to get on your hand and take him to the toilet every 10 mins\n\nYES.. EVERY 10MINS\nor .. Put him in the cage and let him take a crap in the cage\nand..\n they bite very very hard, I'm told they bite harder than most White \nCockatoos or Gallahs\nso.. be careful\n\nbut if you get through all that and you have patience, they are wonderful \nand a pleasure to have.\ufeff",

For example, keep \nthem on a perch or activity center, not in a cage, eat at the same time as \nthem and in the same room as them, tell them what you are doing all the \ntime \"mommy is making some food\" etc , and spend as much time as you can \nbeak to nose so they can feel the vibration of your words. Tell them \"I \nlove you\" at least twice a day, then give them a kiss. Birds Love \naffection, even more than toys and they need a lot of attention to stay \nhappy. Happy birds are talkative birds.\ufeff",
