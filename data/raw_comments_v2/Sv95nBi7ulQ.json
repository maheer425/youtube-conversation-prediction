Three of Four of his \nskills require or cause you to enter melee range. \n\nConsider this...\nIn an optimal scenario, you might have killed 300 minions.\nA soul drops about 33% of the time (This chance varies but let's assume \nit's 33%)\nTherefore you would have collected about 100 souls.\nEach soul grants 0.75 AP and Armour.\nThus, you would have about 75 bonus AP and 75 armor in an optimal scenario. \nThis is 13 pts higher than 62, which is the lowest possible BASE armour in \nthe game at level 18.\n75 armour isn't a lot and you'll probably die with that much, by entering \nmelee range.\n\nAlso, Thresh's AP scaling is crap. 50% AP for Q and 40% for E.
