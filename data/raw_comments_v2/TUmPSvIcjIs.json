He told my grandfather and his sister to only use one to help dig out \nthe basement. They took this as one each. They then proceeded to detonate \nthe caps nearly blowing out the foundation (the house still stands today \nXD) they were promptly spanked afterwards.\n\nA generation later, both my great grandparents passed away. During mourning \nthe family went through all the nicknacks int the basement. My grandfather \nthen found the old blasting caps which had at this point congealed into \nnitroglycerin. My grandfather called the sheriff who literally sped to the \nhouse, sprinted to the porch and asked for the caps.\n\nTo this day I think back to the fact that when I ate cream corn and ham I \nwas a few summer degrees away from an abrupt and explosive death.\n\noh and I almost forgot to mention my great grandmother was a cancan dancer \nin her 'rebellious' phase what her father being a preacher and all X3\ufeff",
