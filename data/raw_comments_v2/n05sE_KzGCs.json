The bees are \nkeeping me hostage because they want the flowers on my nails.  I don't know \nhow long I have left before they find out that the flowers are fake and get \nangry with me.  They have no use for a boy like me and they'll probably get \nrid of me after. plz send help.  These bees are definitely not the bees' \nknees.  They're very mean.
