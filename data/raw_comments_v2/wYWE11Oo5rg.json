And specs be damned why don't we play fair ball \nand force induce a V8 then see which is putting out better specs. Don't get \nme wrong i get it people want to have their cake and eat it to. I.E. Drive \na raptor with 35s and get 16mpg. That might be for some, but most self \nrespecting truck owners that buy these trucks to use them as intended would \nnever sacrifice that v8 roar for turboed v6 and automated sound.\n\nAll that said cylinder deactivation is netting me 18-20 here in the delta \n17 in the hills.

Second, the V6 ecoboost is twin turbo, both \nturbos are identical in size, shape, spool times, etc. They're running in \nparallel, one on each side of the V. What you described is known as \nsequential turbos, not twin turbos, and is not applicable to this \ndiscussion. Even in its stock form the ecoboost has a sizable intercooler \nfor the engine size and the truck can accommodate a much, much larger one \nthat any serious tower can and would upgrade to. FYI, I work with \nturbocharged cars all day, every day and I wouldn't hesitate to throw a \ntrailer behind an ecoboost V6. I would upgrade some things if I was going \nto do is every day, but if I was towing a heavy load every day I'd have a \ndiesel. As far as durability of the engines themselves, the V6 is actually \ntougher than the V8 is many notable ways, as it's a decreased displacement \nN/A engine with stronger internal components. But, to be honest, neither \nthe ecoboost V6 or the coyote V8 has been around long enough to be able to \njudge which is more durable in the long term... but since they're both \nincredibly complex with many, many unnecessary electronic components to \nfail, I doubt there will be much difference in the long, long term, as all \nmodern vehicles are essentially designed to be disposable.",

            "text": "+deimosian I feel inclined to post something here, as I have a bit of \nknowledge on this topic (though this thread is old). When you think of a \nturbocharged engine only producing high peak torque, and low power at other \npoints in its power band, you are thinking of an engine with a single \nturbocharger. Turbos have a rpm area where they work best, and typically \nthey are tuned to only kick in at high rpm so you only get the power when \nyou are pushing the car hard enough to rev it up. This is not the case for \nmany twin-turbo configurations, and the ecoboost is no exception. The \necoboost has a smaller turbo that spools up quickly to deliver boost at low \nrpm, and as the engine revs up and the power delivery offered solely by the \nfirst turbo falls off, a second, larger turbo has already spooled up and \nbegins boosting the engine to maintain a strong power curve throughout the \nrev. This is important in trailering situations where torque is needed at \nall points in the power band for a smooth, powerful feeling, and efficient \ndriving experience. However as someone mentioned earlier, turbos are a \ndouble edged sword. Due to the way that the ecoboost engine is almost \nalways subjected to boost, it is subjected to a lot more stress than a v8 \nengine would be while doing a similar amount of work. For this reason, the \necoboost in particular is known to run extremely hot under continuous \nworking conditions, and even break if subjected to a regular (I mean like \nover the years here) workload; ie pulling trailers every day. It is for \nthis reason that heavy duty twin turbo diesel engines always carry a \npowerful inter-cooler to manage temperatures, which the ecoboost f-150 \nnotably lacks. At the end of the day, despite the technological achievement \nthe ecoboost is, I would recommend a v8 to anyone who needs a long-lasting \nworking truck.",
