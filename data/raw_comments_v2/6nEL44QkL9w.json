I mean.. I've been more-or-less diagnosed with depression in \nmy teens and have been dealing with major anxiety issues but I simply don't \nknow what is going on with me. I tried seeking help but often left with a \n'don't worry you're fine'.\n\nIn the very rare occasions where I litteraly 'go outside', I dont *look* \ndistressed, I try to dress decently, erase myself, talk as little as \npossible and unconsciously put on an happy face which I guess inadvertedly \nfools the few people I interact with into thinking that I am just fine.\n\nBut I've never been able to gain enough confidence to pursue scholarship or \neven get a job ever since I dropped out of school at 16 (related to rural \nhomophobia) and I've had no social life whatsoever in the past 6 years of \nmy life.\ufeff",

I'm sure there's someone out there who would work well with me \nbut after so many crap visits wasting money I just threw my hands up and \ndecided to deal with it myself.\n\nJust because I have anxiety or depression does not mean I am a fragile \nlittle china plate with the comprehension abilities of a second-grader. I'm \nnot saying that having positive reinforcement is a negative thing but it's \nlike they were more concerned with patting me on the back and telling me \neverything was going to be ok than actually attempting to give me ideas \ninto how to deal with my problems. \ufeff",

First to project or assume \nwithout reason is declared the loser. I have no time to waste on people \nlesser educated than myself that loop in cognitive biases and fallacies.\n\n1.) Chemical Imbalance isn't even a theory, it's only a hypothesis \naccording to both the NIMH and the APA.\nThis is a solid, legally verified fact by their own paperwork. There have \nbeen zero, I repeat zero tests to prove chemical imbalances in patients.\n\n2.) There is zero data on the conceptual belief that \"behavioral \ndisorders/diseases\" are caused by any damage to the brain. They are defined \nby distress, which according to the award winning research of Steven Pinker \nis actually a good, positive, evolutionary reactionary trait when the \ndistress motivates people.\nStress only becomes a nuisance when:\na.) Environmental distress is not assessed, and it increases distress \n(usually ending in suicide - NIMH. Rosenhan)\nb.) Ignored environmental distress triggers hereditary reactions and it \nannoys others (Thomas Szasz, Rosenhan)\nc.) Distress is used as a coercive measure, such as in bullying or \nconformity demands (Thomas Szasz).\nAll three of these examples suggest that the origins or distress are not \ndiseases or innate imbalances, but instead manufactures by an environment \nthat causes distress and then ignores the cause for any number of reasons \n(egotism, laziness, self-serving bullying, etc...).\n\n3.) The idea that chemicals that sedate people or get them high therefore \ncombats chemical imbalances is no different than declaring that taking an \naspirin to cure a headache proves your brain has a negative imbalance of \naspirin. Sedatives help ease pain, but that doesn't mean the pain is \nirrational or part of a disease.\n\n4.) Finally, the fallacies you committed:\nA.) Argument from ignorance (claiming the chemical model is correct with \nzero information)\nB.)
