            "text": "Here is something guys:\n1. That's not Niko. During 1992, Niko would be in the war right now.\n2. When Big Smoke was talking to Ryder he was actually convincing him to \njoin the Ballas. \n3. They didn't make a GTA SA Stories because the VC Stories and LC stories \nwas only for some extra money and shit (I think.). Plus the introduction is \nalready a prequel to San Andreas. \n4. GTA SA was originally going to have three characters as the \nprotagonists. Which would make GTA SA the first ever GTA game to have 3 \nprotagonists. \n5. Those 3 ballas are actually or might be beta ballas models that were \nrecycled. \n6. When T-Bone was beating up the \"snitch\" the snitch's model looked \nexactly like Jose, Cesar's friend in the mission \"Cesar Vialpando\" but \nRockstar most likely re-used Jose's model.\n7. Something we always waited for, WHY IS CJ AND THE OTHER GUYS NOT IN GTA \nV? Because they are different universes. Some may say \"Love Fist, Lazlow \nand Cris Formage\" are in GTA V though. That's because they are minor \ncharacters and they aren't really important. Rockstar said that they will \nnever put a past protagonist in a new GTA game. Keep on dreaming kiddos.\ufeff",
