He simply needed to divide \nthe volume of the drop by the area of the pond and then speculate on what \nthat tiny thickness meant. That division was all that was needed to have \nmade Franklin one of the fathers of atomic theory!\ufeff",

Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics merge together \nvery well to make a very well understood theory (mathematically at least as \nno one intuitively understands it). Special Relativity works extremely well \non the tiny and it has been very successful and so has Quantum Mechanics. \nQuantum Field Theory (the full merging of quantum theory with special \nrelativity) scales up to the macroscopic VERY well. That is the limit as \nany system becomes large smoothly goes from quantum like to classical (as \nlong as speeds are much less than c).  \n\nGeneral Relativity is the less understood and odd one out. We haven't done \nthat many experiments on this one because gravity is so weak. General \nRelativity doesn't scale down to the microscopic very well and super strong \ngravity fields like blackholes don't mesh well with the quantum world. We \nalso haven't explained why particles have certain masses or why certain \nconstants are certain values. Or for that matter anything else that we \nsimply label \"intrinsic.\" Intrinsic (intrinsic mass, intrinsic spin, \nintrinsic charge, intrinsic baryon number, etc) is just another word for \"I \nhave no fucking clue.\"\n\nThe cool thing about science is at some point everything is based on \n\"intrinsic\" things we just accept as true but we will never know for sure \nif there is reasoning behind those \"intrinsic\" things. (All logic is based \non fundamental premises we just universally accept as true).",

He actually helped provide some \nof the initial research and was a huge proponent of there actually being a \nquantum world that acted differently then our own. Einstein wasn't \nreligious either. He was a Jew, yes, but did not practice the religion. He \nwas opposed to SOME of what quantum physics proposed because some of it \ncontradicted his larger view of physics that he spent his entire life \ncreating. The same view of physics we use today in general and special \nrelativity. But today physics is generally separated into two types: \nEinsteins macro version of the world in relativity, a world that can be \ncalculated and makes predictions in the real world...and then theres the \nquantum view of the world which deals with much less understood things. The \nproblem is that the nature of particles at a quantum scale doesn't really \nconform to how we see regular matter act on a macro scale. Quantum physics \nliterally breaks the rules of regular physics in some aspects, like \nparticles teleporting through energy barriers, or particles occupying the \nsame point in space, or particles traveling faster than light perhaps. And \nquantum physics was in its infancy when Einstein developed relativity. As \nyou can see in this video, he had no doubt there was an entire world \nexisting beyond our sight, the quantum world, and he knew it would \ncontradict his own theories even then, but he still helped promote it \nbecause he was genuinely intrigued. He was truly a scientific man",
