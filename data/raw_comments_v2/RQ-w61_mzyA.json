When you're so sure that something exists \nerasure is impossible, because the feeling that they were once here and \ntherefore still are in some eerie way is impossible to remedy.\n\n#3 *SPIRITUAL* Eternity is nothing for a god, and those in hell who realize \ntheir sins can still beg for forgiveness.  He's basically waiting on an \ninvestment to pay off so he can bring them back to the light.\n\nPersonally, any form of eternal unchanging existence sounds like torture to \nme.  If I had to say I worshiped anything it would be the chaos and chance \nthat is science.  Agnostic is my choice of word, because the only correct \nanswer is that we do not know.",
