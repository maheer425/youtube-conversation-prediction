They always have the same \nold story: his mother died / rejected him / abandoned him / couldn\u2019t feed \nhim, et cetera \u2026 They take them from their moms, feed them from \nbottles/spoons, and put them in cages (or sometimes they just raise them in \nprivate homes on these\u2026 cold floors...). I just can't buy those \n\"orphans-stories\" anymore\u2026! to me it seems strange\u2026 (Mothers NEVER reject \ntheir babies!... I mean: they do, but in a very very very rare or unusual \ncases!\u2026).\nA question: How come in the wild - mothers love and care their babies so \nperfectly, and in those zoos they just NEVER do so?... How come they just \nalways reject their babies so easily and so regularly??...!!\nI just don\u2019t really like all what they actually do to the animals there\u2026 \n(Looks to me more like one big lab experiments or something, I'm sorry\u2026).\ufeff",
