We all agree that \nNonTheistic things do exist. Sun, moon, carrots, etc. In dispute is whether \nthere is anything in the set called Theistic\u2026 or is the Theistic set \nactually a null set?\n \nArgument: NonTheistic things exist. If NonTheistic things cannot exist \nwithout Theistic things, then Theistic things must exist.  If the premises \nare true, then the conclusion must be valid. \n \nThe first premise is true:.NonTheistic things do exist. Sun, moon, carrots \nand people are NonTheistic. This is not in debate.\n \nThe second premise is NonTheistic things cannot exist without Theistic \nthings. Please consider the following arguments as proof that NonTheistic \nthings cannot exist without Theistic things.\n \nNontheistic things either 1) Had a beginning or 2) have existed for an \ninfinite period of time. There are no other possibilities. It is obvious \nthat either 1 or 2 is true . But the following arguments will prove that \nNEITHER can be true without the existence of Theistic things.\n \n1. NONTHEISTIC THINGS HAD A BEGINNING: If theistic things is a null set, \nthen everything is nontheistic, and NOTHING turned into EVERYTHING. This is \nimpossible. \n\n\n2. NONTHEISTIC THINGS HAVE EXISTED FOR AN INFINITE TIME: If nontheistic \nthings have existed for an infinite period of time, then the sun and stars \nwould have burned up by now (referring to 2nd Law of Thermodynamics). If \ntheistic things is a null set, then everything is nontheistic and nothing \nexists outside of the nontheistic set. The nontheistic set would succumb to \n\"heat death\" since it cannot perpetuate life sustaining temperatures and \nthere is nothing outside of the nontheistic set to act upon it to \nperpetuate life sustaining temperatures. \n \nSo, it is  impossible for NonTheistic things to have had a beginning \nwithout the existence of Theistic things. It is also impossible for \nNonTheistic things to have existed infinitely without the existence of \nTheistic things. \n \nSo, whether  NonTheistic things had a beginning or not, neither case can \nhave occurred without Theistic things.\n \nSummary: If NTH exists. And if NTH cannot exist without TH. Then TH must \nexist. \n\nIOW: If NonTheistic Things exist, and if NonTheistic Things cannot exist \nwithout Theistic Things, then Theistic Things must exist.\ufeff",

            "text": "+FireLight The obvious fallacy comes in your \"Myra is a cat\" example. You \nseem to think that the following argument is invalid:\n\nMyra is a Cat\nAll Cats are Moons\nTherefore Myra is a Moon\n\nThe problem, which you're failing to see, is that it actually IS a \nlogically valid argument. You are conflating validity with soundness.\n\nValidity within logic comes from whether the conclusion follows the \npremises, not whether the premises are true in real life. The conclusion \nthat Myra is a Moon is logically valid, and to say that Myra is not a moon \nwould be a logical falsehood.\n\nHowever, the argument is not *sound* because the second premise, as we \ndefine it in real life, is not true. We can check the truth of our \ndefinitions by comparing them against evidence. We classify moons and cats \nas different things, but even in real life it could be argued that by \nlaunching poor Myra into high Earth orbit she could become a moon.\n\nThis is how +NonStampCollector demonstrated that you can plug in anything \ninto your \"theistic things\" slot and still come up with an equally valid \nlogical conclusion. Moreover, polytheism and monotheism are mutually \nexclusive sets: if one is true, the other, by definition, is false. \nMonotheism is the belief that there is only one god. If you find out there \nis more than one god, *by definition* you cannot be a monotheist, even if \nyou only put your trust in one of the gods.\n\nOf course, this would be a lot easier if you 1) defined \"theistic things\" \nand 2) provided testable evidence of said things.",

Also I find it funny that Ashton B claims \nyou are a lost soul if you believe god exists in 2015, yet speaks of a \nsoul... which makes me wonder how you can believe in a soul, which is a \nspiritual belief, yet believing in gods is ridiculous? \n\n\nI find this mildly hypocritical. That said, nature and weather is NOT \nevidence for god, jesus's wife. As a matter of fact, I revere Nature, (not \nworship) as it is self evident and speaks volumes to me about the nature of \nLife, the Universe, and Everything. I do not think that all religion has to \nbe ridiculous. I think that having spiritual beliefs actually makes sense. \nJust as I find it ridiculous to believe we are the only life in the vast \nUniverse, I find it ridiculous to believe that in the vast Universe and \nworld of Existence there is only matter. Yes there is matter and energy and \nmilitant atheists will admit that, but they do not admit to the possibility \nof a spiritual realm. Which makes no sense to me. Why not? Why would this \nbe all there is? Why in the GENERATIONS upon GENERATIONS of humans would \nmost all of them be wrong about the existence of SOME spiritual dimension \nto existence. \n\n\nI'm not saying the christian one necessarily. But I do not think it is an \nunreasonable belief to believe in some spiritual dimension to existence. \nAnd the fact that most militant atheists not only don't believe in it but \nstate it as FACT, is just ridiculous. In a way I feel the christians are \nright with their argument of 'You can't prove it DOESN'T exist.\" They are \nright. You can't. Not yet anyway. I'm not saying that lack of proof of \nexistence is proof of existence, but I'm saying it is what it is. it is \narrogant to claim that there is no god. Why? Because you cannot prove so. \nIt is also arrogant to claim there IS a god. Why? because you cannot prove \nit. We cannot prove any of this. \n\n\nTherefore the only appropriate responses are curiosity and humility. Be \nhumble and admit it is a belief. Which it is, because you cannot prove it \none way or another. And be polite, and do not call others ridiculous for \ntheir beliefs. Because again, even if you think it is ridiculous, like I \nsaid, it can't be proven one way or another. So be humble and polite. They \nprobably think your beliefs are ridiculous too. \n\n\nIf you are angry at people like jesus's wife, attack what you are really \nangry about. For instance, what really angers me about her comments is that \nshe claims you are an imbecile if you don't believe the way she does. rude, \narrogant, and exclusive. She futher proclaims that nature and weather are \nevidence for her god. Also incorrect and flawed reasoning. She then pulls \nkarma into her religion, karma being a hindu concept. Normally I have no \nproblem with pulling concepts from many religions, spiritual paths, and \nphilosophies to create your own understanding. But christianity forbids its \nfollowers from touching pagan beliefs. therefore she is being hypocritical \nand sinning according to her own religion. She also said volcanoes and the \nEarth's core is evidence for her religion's hell. again flawed reasoning. \nMaking all these claims as facts, arrogant. Speaking as though she holds \nthe understanding to our existence: arrogant. \n\n\nThese are things most christians do that anger me. They speak as though all \nthese things are facts instead of beliefs, they tell others they wil go to \ntheir religion's hell for not being part of their religion, which is \ntotally stupid. It's like saying I will go to jail in India, for committing \na crime against Indian law, while it's legal in America, while being IN \nAMERICA. They want to force others to follow their religion in law, \nexamples being issues of women's and gay rights. It's like they want to \ndeny us our doughnuts because they choose to be on a diet. Not my problem. \n\n\nThese things anger me, and these are the things I attack directly, instead \nof making blanket statements about all religions, which are NOT all the \nsame, and counter claiming that I and MY group have the correct \nanswer/religion/not religion/philosophy/beliefs ect. \n\n\nI refuse to be arrogant like militant atheists and militant christians. I \nwill continue to be humble about my spiritual beliefs, and continue to be \nfierce in my assertions that behaviors such as those of militants are \narrogant, unbalanced, flawed, and not based in fact themselves.

People have to \nattack things they don't understand about God when he had given the law to \nmen because there is no fault finding in Jesus Christ. They base there \nideas on experiences they have had. When these experiences were never \noriginally intended to be had. Men wouldn't be such pigs if we weren't \nexposed to constant sexually imagery. The bibles slavery is just modern day \nemployment. Ones boss has complete control over a mans family and life even \nthought he doesn't \"OWN\" them.\n\nI have found in my many years of being a Christian and many years of not \nbeing a Christian it all boils down to people wanting to write there own \ncode of wrong and write. Basically accountability. Most of the same people \nwho hate God and deny he exist and created them. Would be fine with the \nidea of space aliens creating them because they would still get choose what \nthey want to be wrong and write. They would have no problem being created \nby them or thanking or worshiping them for making us.\n\nI personally don't understand how someone can look at the universe and this \nplanet and think that God is moron. Not to mention the fact that we are \nmade of DNA coded programed living software that streaches to the moon and \nback. Life is beautiful when people choose to live like Jesus and listen to \nwhat he said. Yet people CHOOSE not to and wounder why we have hell on \nearth. Gods not a moron he just gave us the ability to be morons if we \nchoose =0\n\nEvery person on the planet knows that they are important and not just a \nrandom process of zombie slim that started living millions of years ago and \nmutated into thinking,breathing, living beings capable of love, hate murder \nand kindness. This to me is truly silly notion yet Christians are the ones \nwho get made fun of? All i can do is try and be like Jesus to the best of \nmy ability and if Gods not real then cool. If he is even better and i say \nthis dropping all of my personal experiences because i have had many \nencounters that would be classified as supernatural. Yet it is up to every \nperson to choose there own path and walk out there own salvation with God. \nAll i can do is try and point the way.\n\nPersonaly i think everyone knows in there heart that life is no accident \nyet i can't go around calling people a liar who say they don't know. I \nthink it boils down to people not wanting to do as they are told. Kinda \nlike have good parents on earth. We don't always want to do as say. Yet \nwhat they are saying is best thing for us. I just hope in some way that i \nhave helped you see that the God i love. Is not a moron because some guy on \nyoutube makes a video about something he doesn't understand and doesn't \nwant to try and understand. Lots of love and God Bless.",

And who\u2019s favorite supernatural power was responsible? How about \nThor, Allah, Brahma or the Christian God? How is the existence of \nSupernatural beings proved in the first place?  \n\nLet\u2019s assume that there are no Supernatural beings. Are they really \nnecessary for the universe to exist?\n\nWe\u2019ll divide POSSIBLE EXISTENCE into the Non Supernatual Universe (NSU) and \nthe Supernatual Universe (SU). The Supernatual Universe (SU) represents \neverything supernatural\u2026 any deities whether real or imagined. This \nincludes Thor, Allah, Brahma, the Christian God, etc .  The Non Supernatual \nUniverse (NSU) is everything else. We are assuming that SU is empty, a null \nset.\n\nLet\u2019s consider what we absolutely know about the Universe:The Universe \nexists. Either 1) the NSU has always existed or 2) the NSU had a beginning. \nThere are no other possibilities. \n\nThis statement is true by logic alone. It\u2019s like saying that if something \ndoesn\u2019t have an end, it will last forever\u2026 only stating it in reverse.\n\n(1) runs into a problem with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, (Entropy): \nIf NSU \u201chas always been here\u201d then it has existed for an INFINITE period of \ntime. The stars would have burned out after an INFINITE period. The earth \nwould have stopped rotating, etc, etc. (Energy with sufficient utility to \nburn as a star would no longer exist after an INFINITE period.) As energy \nis used, it loses its ability to do work. To verify, Google \"An isolated \nsystem's ability to do work decreases over time\" If SU is a null set, then \nNSU is an isolated system\u2026 a closed system. If NSU is a closed or isolated \nsystem, the energy in NSU should have lost its ability to do work after an \nINFINITE period of time. \n\n(2) raises a question. If NSU had a beginning and if SU is the null set, \nthen there was \u201cnothing\u201d before NSU had its beginning. For (2) to be \npossible, then \u201cnothing\u201d must turn into \u201ceverything\u201d. If we are to take \nscience seriously, we cannot accept that \u201cnothing\u201d can \u201cPOOF\u201d turn into the \n\u201ceverything\u201d. After all, what can \u201cnothing\u201d do except nothing, since there \nis nothing in \u201cnothing\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d anything?\n\nSo, if SU is empty, neither 1 nor 2 is consistent with science. That would \nmean that all possibilities for the existence of the NSU are not very \nbelievable without SU. Without a Supernatural Universe, we are faced with a \nchoice: either nothing turned into everything or we must throw the 2nd Law \nof Thermodynamics under the bus. Hmm... Will the true creator please stand \nup? I hope it\u2019s not Thor!\n\nBut what if there is some unknown nonsupernatual something \u2026 that created \nthe NSU? The problem is\u2026 we must include that something in the definition \nof NSU. Something can\u2019t cause its self to come into existence. \nAdditionally, there can be no \u201cunsupernatual something\u201d that is outside of \nthe closed system of the NSU to inject energy into the NSU to make (1) \npossible. NSU, by definition includes all unsupernatual things. \n\nOne might say \"How did the SU (Supernatural Universe) come into existence \nor last forever?\" The \"Super\" in Supernatural means above the natural or \ngreater than the natural... not subject to the laws that govern the \nnatural. This is the heart of the issue. The deist argues \"Since the \nexistence of the universe doesn\u2019t make sense without the supernatual, there \nmust be a Supernatural explanation\". \n\nSo, it appears that there must be something Supernatural to explain what we \nknow about the Non Supernatural Universe\u2026 to explain how it has existed \nforever, or how it had a beginning.\n\nBut, support for the existence of any particular deity has not been shown \nhere\u2026 not for Thor, Allah, Brahma, the Christian God, etc. It indicates \nthat some supernatural power does exist\u2026\n\nBut who?\ufeff",

They've been loosely termed \"The Laws of Nature\".\n\nYou say \"...and our rational deductions point to the conclusion that \nnothing occurs in nature without a reason...\" Nature does not \"reason\". \nNature is, as I said earlier, the result of physical, chemical and \nbiological process. It has no goal or purpose and therefore cannot have a \n\"reason\".\n\nYou say \"a considerable number of scientists have a religious outlook...\". \nHow many is a \"considerable number\", and so what? Brown University's \nProfessor Ken Miller is a practicing Catholic. He was also the plaintiffs' \nstar witness in Kitzmiller v Dover, a landmark case in the Separation of \nChurch and State battle. He literally made mincemeat of the Intelligent \nDesign argument. What are your sources for the \"considerable number\"? Wait; \nI have some numbers:\n\n                               1914        1933   1998\nPersonal belief            27.7%    15%     7.0%\nPersonal disbelief        52.7%     68%  72.2%\nDoubt or agnosticism   20.9%    17%   20.8%\n*Edward J. Larson and Larry Witham: \"Leading Scientists Still Reject God.\" \nNature, 1998; 394, 313*\n\nAnd this is an old study. The numbers have almost certainly changed for the \nbetter (our better, that is).\n\nThe biggest problem I have with any Creator Deity is *why*? Why would any \ngod create this vast universe, most of which is implacably hostile, just \nfor little us?\n\nWe don't need god(s). Science works.",

I can see the logic \nof China's one child policy but I still think that's a bridge too far \nbecause I think there may be some benefits to growing up with siblings (not \nthat I've experienced this for myself).\n\nPerhaps a two child policy would be a good idea. Or if you need stable \nfinances to apply for a loan, why the same before having kids? I find it \nsurprising that in the abortion debate the pro-abortion side call \nthemselves pro-choice. In a different world the anti abortion side would be \ncalled pro-choice and instead of debating whether or not abortion should be \nbanned the two sides would be debating whether or not abortion should be \nmandatory for people who already have too many kids or people on welfare \n(not that I want to condemn people on welfare too much, seeing as how I'm \non welfare but then again I'm not a serial parent and I know that \nsuccessful parents tend to raise successful kids. I don't want to condone \nwelfare recipients even if I am one).\n\nI think it's great that the childhood survival rate has improved in Uganda \nbut I think they could get an even higher percentage if there were just \nless children there in the first place. It just seems to me paradoxical \nthat their solution to the problem of high childhood mortality is also the \ncause of high childhood mortality. Also I don't think having more children \nthan adults makes for a stable society.\n\nThe vast majority of 25 year olds shouldn't have kids? Well? At 26 I don't \nthink I'd know how to raise kids and I have no intention of trying at any \nstage of my life (though in my case it's for less noble reasons than you, I \njust don't want to face the work, stress and expense of raising kids) but \nif I think of my mother, being 21 years older than me, she didn't know how \nto raise kids. She learned quickly. There are first-time parents at 40 who \ndon't know how to raise kids. I think instead of debating whether they \nshould be parents at 20 or 40, my way of thinking is that first-time \nparents of any age much learn on the job. The only way your thirtyager \nfriends could learn parenting skills is by being parents.\n\nIt's true that 40 year olds are likely to have more money than 20 year olds \nand I don't want to see children grow up in poverty. But I also don't like \nto see children grow up with absent parents. While I fully support having \nwomen in the work place, a necessary consequence of this is that kids get \nless parenting. This could apply for twentyager parents or fortyager \nparents. 20 year olds will work towards success but once they succeed they \nas 40 year olds must work to maintain it. Duel income families earn a lot \nmore but are they still in the black if you account for the expense of \ndaycare? Depends on the job I guess.",

Why should I condemn some hypothetical person, without ever \nconsulting him/her, to the pain of adolescence, puberty, the daily grind, \nand finally old age.. just so that I could satisfy some narcissistic \ncuriosity about what it would be like to have a little copy of myself \nrunning around, or so that I could have someone to call me when I'm old and \ninfirm?

Now as standards of living improve (access to clean \nwater, healthcare, medicine, food, etc etc), the death rate drops \nprecipitously, but the birth rate lags behind. Eventually, in developed \ncountries, birth rates also tend to fall very low. Until you get to a point \nwhere the population is actually in decline (look at Japan or Germany, or \neven the USA if you discount the effect of immigration). But it takes five \nor more generations for cultural norms to adjust, and in the interim we \nhave dangerously exploding population figures. The light at the end of the \ntunnel is that some demographers think world population will peak at about \n10-15 billion.. and then eventually start to decline all over the world. \nThat's assuming standards of living can be maintained.\n\nI know my wait-until-40-to-have-kids thing is also kind of out there. I \njust personally feel that the reason most people think 12 year olds should \nnot be having kids (they are too immature) also applies to the vast \nmajority of 25 year olds. I'm currently 35 and still feel as though most of \nmy friends are not yet mature enough to really handle raising a child. ",

            "text": "+5179anonymous\nGood ideas but no kids until 40? I don't know. They'd be too old to keep up \nwith their kids. My (sinlge) Mum were in her 20s and we'd go on long bike \nrides, play soccer in the back yard, stuff like that. I think there could \nbe benefits to having parents that are young enough to be psychically fit. \nTrue she gave up having a career except that was never the least bit career \nminded to begin with.\n\nAnd Uganda? Sure they could do with \"less fertility\" but I think the \nUgandans should still take a bit of responsibility. They should use \ncontraceptives.\n\nI saw this other video of Stephan Fry vs the evil Ann Widdecombe. Stephen \nFry says it's bad that the Catholics make Africans think contraceptives are \na sin (agreed) but evil Ann Widdecombe says she was a missionary in Africa \nand then she says it's a good thing they each have ten kids even though it \nleads to a modest amount of food being divided among more kids because she \nsays there's no old age pension there so the parents need to have enough \nkids to ensure that one or two of them survive so they get supported in \ntheir old age. Except that their high rate of childhood mortality is caused \nby malnutrition. What kind of stupid Christian circular logic is that? They \nhave limited food resources and too many kids so their all starving and Ann \nWiddecombe thinks the solution to this problem is for them to have even \nmore kids? I want to kick her in her ugly face.\n\nAnd for the African parents? Do they think it's OK to have ten kids and \nhave eight of them starve to death and two of them starve and barely \nsurvive until adulthood just so they can have a more comfortable \nretirement? Is it right to inflict horrible suffering on ten people just so \ntwo people can have a more pleasant retirement? It would be better for two \nparents to die at 50 (from lack of retirement plan) than for eight kids to \ndie at 5. I find it hard to believe that any parents could be so selfish as \nto value their own happiness above their kids'. What kind of awful parents \nwould make their kids suffer so they can live in greater comfort? Sounds \nlike an Ann Widdecombe idea. Her politics are also based on the needs of \nthe few outweighing the needs of the many.",

            "text": "+Luke Beauchamp  well, NS Collector has some good ideas. 1. don't command \npeople to chop off a part of their body if they're going to be born with \nit. 2. create men and women with roughly equal sex drives. 3. kids can have \nsex that's probably fine (as long as society doesn't brainwash them into \nfeeling guilty and awful and neurotic about it), but they shouldn't be able \nto have kids until 25 or so. Actually I'd go older than that and say by \naround 40. 4. keep the testicles inside the body, producing fewer sperm \ncells if necessary, with a system of insemination that is more efficient, \ncompletely voluntary, and more likely to succeed if you want it to. and so \non... could come up with quite a few other things. But that's a start. It \nwould make people happier and healthier and society function better. Though \nit wouldn't be the best thing for creating lots and lots of people. Which, \nlike I said, is the only thing evolution is concerned with. You and I (and \nany reasonably realistic loving god) might look and absolutely \nthrough-the-roof fertility rates in countries like Uganda and find this to \nbe a cause for concern. It will lead to lots of suffering and lots of death \nand lots of people who leave short, miserable lives plus a depletion of \nresources that makes it more difficult for everyone else to survive and \nlead contended lives, as well. Evolution looks at the same situation and \nsays, \"great!\"",
