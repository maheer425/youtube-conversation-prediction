Don't forget the aftershave which costs \u00a36 (US$12). \nThat is \u00a329 (US$58) in total. If you shave everyday (which most men \neventually do) a pack of 8 razors will go in about 5-6 weeks. Which means \nfor the year, razor blades alone cost about \u00a3200 not including all the \nextras. Male razors have to be better because we are shaving our faces not \nour legs. Faces are sensitive. By the way, i occasionally shave my legs for \nswimming competitions so i have had it worse than any girl.

For girls are \nthe hot depilation strips which let your skin smooth and pretty.The \"Bic \neffect\" is just on the moment, the next day your face will be rough ...you \nbetter choose a twizzer to a Bic (even tho depilation strips are the best \nand'll always be) But thats not even necessarly (no matter the way) if its \nONLY fluff...if your brunette, yes , you have to.( \"You have to\" is too \nmuch said...you \"should\" sounds better;) :) ) So yeah .. shaving the facial \nhair is the biggest mistake a girl could ever make (ofc there are \nexceptions like those with hormonal problems or those girls with beards-for \nthose its perfect and its not a shame, we dont choose the way we born...) \nso mmyep , just my opinion , iam not hating on anyone, just saying... :) \np.s: If u think Im wrong comment or dislike or whatev only do not swear, \njust say it in a pretty way.^^\ufeff",
