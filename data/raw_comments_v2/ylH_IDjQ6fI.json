I \ncouldn't believe my ears, I thought it was the wind or something so I \nchuckled a little bit then asked him what he said and he repeated it. I ran \ninto this 7-11 right by the station, went to the restroom and tried to \ncatch my breath and breathe normally. I cried in that bathroom for about 30 \nminutes before I went out again, I missed my train and I had to wait for a \nlong time, people looked at me funny because I was trembling and couldn't \nstop crying. It was very cold and I literally felt like someone jumped me. \nI finally got home, I walked most of the way. I locked myself in the closet \nfor 2 days and could only think of suicide. A day later I had to come out \nand be \"normal\"on Christmas day with my family. I just told YouTube my \nbreak up story... I don't know why. But hey it DOES get better. I was \nsingle for a while and really had time to be okay with myself. The past \nyear and a half I've been with the most sweet, and amazing man I could ever \ndream of. If I hadn't been dumped over the phone at a 7-11 then I wouldn't \nbe able to have found my true soul mate, or even better understand and \naccept myself during the time that I was single. Good luck guys, I'm sorry \nif any of you have recently been through a break up. :/ (Hugs)\ufeff",

Have some self-respect and \npull yourself up to your feet. Set new goals, focus. Improve yourself. Try \nto look at the big picture. A good friend or two can help tremendously. \nYou'll be okay again. Not just okay. You'll be a new and improved 100%. \nLook forward to that day :)\ufeff",
