We shortened it (sounded easy until we figured the rear end is \nwider than the middle of the car). According to the rules of building one, \nyou must convert it into a pickup model, so that you have only 10 cm behind \nthe front seats. (No rear seats allowed.)\nThere was no engine in it, since that one was used for a v8 volvo \nconversion. So, we used a VW diesel i4 engine. To make it rear wheel drive \nwe turned it 90 degrees, and welded the drive shaft to one of the former \ndrive axles.\nIt was a lot of work, but turned out good. When I get old enough to drive a \nreal car, I'm gonna try some projects with a bit more HP and speed \ninvolved.\ufeff",
