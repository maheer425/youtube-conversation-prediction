            "text": "For over a century, the Oxford English Dictionary had improperly defined a \nsiphon as \"A pipe or tube of glass, metal or other material, bent so that \none leg is longer than the other, and used for drawing off liquids by means \nof atmospheric pressure, which forces the liquid up the shorter leg and \nover the bend in the pipe.\" This made headlines as the OED had attributed \nthe operative force in a siphon to \"atmospheric pressure\" as opposed to the \nforce of gravity. Atmospheric pressure is the same on either end, it's \ngravity that pulls the substance over the top hump\n\nWhen pointed out by an old scientist in 2010, an OED Spokesperson stated:\n\"The OED entry for siphon dates from 1911 and was written by editors **who \nwere not scientists** ... Our files suggest that no one has queried the \ndefinition before. We are revising that entire dictionary text now, and I \nhave copied your helpful comments to the revision file, to ensure they are \ntaken into account when the entry is rewritten.\"\n\nA dictionary does not supersede the creator, nor does it magically have the \npower to alter reality. If I created a product called gizzy and explicitly \nstated it's pronounced with a J like jizzy, an editor in a dictionary \ncompany does not magically have the authority to decide my product can be \npronounced jizzy or gizzy (with a soft g). Likewise, Steve Wilhite, who \ninvented the Gif file in 1987, told the New York Times that the word is \npronounced \u201cjif\u201d not \u201cgiff\u201d. This was also expressed in print in the \ninstruction manual released by his company. In fact, a very probably \nexplanation for the inclusion of both pronunciations is to avoid \ncontroversy (though ironically it merely perpetuates it).\n\nUsing the dictionary to justify yourself is what's called an **appeal to \nauthority fallacy**; a fallacy of irrelevance. X authoritative figure says \nY, therefore Y must be true. That is **only** reliable if X authoritative \nfigure is an **expert** on the matter; any reasonable person could see that \nWebsters or Miriam, et cetera is not an expert on digital formats, matters \nof science, et cetera, and their word is therefore not the be-all-end-all. \nMistakes can occur in the dictionary, and definitions do not always \naccurately reflect reality.\ufeff",
