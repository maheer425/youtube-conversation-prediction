We can only \nhope scientists will meditate, if nothing else than to re-humanize the \nseverely dehumanized. [See the cat's cradle... see?]\nDollars to donuts, what will end up happening is that they will create and \ncontrive highly technical and intricate concepts that will stand in the way \nof any kind of real understanding. That's doing nothing, but creating \nfurther games. So the next generation will gain only a pedantic knowledge \nof meditation--then students will \"study\" meditation instead of \nunderstanding or practicing it--just like every other subject in academia. \nAcademia \"studies\" so much, yet understands so little. Then years down the \nroad, this will become a religion and after many decades or centuries this \nknowledge will become so obscured by theory and corrupted with concepts \nthat it will be forgotten and replaced will dogmatic beliefs--since no one \nwill have any real understanding of it. Hasn't this same pattern happened \nseveral times throughout history already? The question is can man end this \npattern? Can man stop creating disorder in the world?\nHere we are 2,500 years later and we are just 'relearning' these \nthings--the ancient Greeks meditated sitting up with their hand underneath \ntheir chin.  What are you waiting for?  By all means do it, if it's so \neasy!  Go off and sit in a lotus position with your eyes closed, chant some \nbizarre words, and sit there not thinking--then see how long it will take \nyou to understand what it is you're supposed to be doing.

Be comfortable where you are, with limited distraction if \nany (I like to use guided meditations but you can also do it without music \nor guidance).\n\nThe basics are really this.\n1. Place your focus on a certain aspect that is always there. For instance \nyour breath. It can also be the sensation of just being there. Feel how you \nare sitting in the chair. Feel how your body has weight. Just the sense \nthat you are there, what is also called the persistent feeling of \"I am\".\n\n2. When focusing on that aspect you WILL be interrupted by thoughts. This \nis not bad at all, and a big misconception is that you're not allowed to \nthink at all. \nYou most definitely are, but you should try to keep your focus on that \nsingle aspect. So when you are drifting away in thought, gently nudge your \nfocus back to that aspect.\nSo the goal is really to detect when you are drifting away in thought and \nnotice it as soon as possible, and refocus on that aspect.\n\n3. Repeat until you're done. (I would advice not to use a timer unless you \nwant to set a specific time each day, mainly because it will jolt you into \na scare reaction, which is the opposite of what you are trying to achieve. \nBut will be a really really small one compared to when you're not in the \nmoment.)\n\nSelf-hypnosis is the same thing, it is also meditation but you're imagining \nthings at the same time and shifting your focus instead of keeping it at \none point.

            "text": "Hi Ethan. Yes, it is possible. You might recall that many famous scientific \nproblems have been solved when the scientist goes for a walk, or after \nthey've had a good nap, and they all of a sudden have a \"eureka\" moment.\nThat's because the mind is less distracted during those times, and so our \nsubconscious is able to work on the problem with higher degrees of it's \nfull capacity. Meditation is something like taking that effect, and \nmaximising it to it's highest potential. IIRC Thich Nhat Hanh from Buddhism \nsaid once that one way they consider the mind, is that it's somewhat like \nan iceberg: the conscious part of the mind is like the part above the \nwater, relatively small and powerless, while the store consciousness (or \nsubconscious) is more like the part of the iceberg submerged below the \nwater - even though we cannot see it, it is far, far more effective and \npowerful. If you leave a problem for it to solve, it will probably come to \nyou, and in a far more effective way than simply sitting and beating \nanswers out of yourself.\nBut of course, find what works for you and your book. Give it a try and see \nhow you go. :)",
