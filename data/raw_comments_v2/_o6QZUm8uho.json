            "text": "\"Noisey Atlanta displays almost perfectly the production chain of the first \ntype of music mentioned. The scene has a unique way of processing music: it \ngoes straight from the producers hands to the big strip clubs like Magic \nCity (Mike Will Made It specifically references this strip club when \ninterviewed). From there it goes to usual clubs and onto radio, and the \nmusic gains listening time in that way. In an odd way, the strippers have a \nlarge influence over the type of hip hop blaring from the tracks: to \nparaphrase Drake, the women are quite literally running the game.\" for the \nfull article, be sure to follow this link: \nhttps://nattyjahmsmusic.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/think-piece-the-dominance-of-atlanta/\n\ufeff",
