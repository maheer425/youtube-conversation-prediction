            "text": "+John Robenault This is gonna sound really weird but here it goes. Time and \nspace are infinite. While you only exist in the now, you dont exist in even \nthe next second or the past second, at least not in THIS exact time lapse. \nBare with me, I know its hard to understand. For example, I am 22. I \ntechincally have lived for 22 years, yet I no longer exist in the past, and \nas I'm writing this sentence I do not even exist before I type each letter. \nWE have no future or past really, but time does. All time traveling would \ndo is open portals to alternate time realities of either our past life or \nfuture. In other words, if you had been in a car accident a year ago, if \nyou time traveled back to a year, you wouldnt neccessarily be in that car \naccident. Who knows, in THAT timeline you might have died before or never \nbeen born at all. Same with the future. We all want to see our future, but \nseeing us in the future would only be a glimpse into an alternate reality \nof our lives. And, contrary to popular belief, if you fcked something up in \nyour past when you time traveled, it wouldnt affect your present life cause \nyour present life is just that...its the PRESENT. Past does not exist in \nthis realm. Debate is out on whether or not humans could time travel to a \nperiod from before they were born. Question is we dont know and wont till \nwe try it. Who knows, maybe in another realm you were born 500 years ago. \nIf not, some believe we wouldnt even be able to travel to time frames like \nthat. This proves that we dont control time, time controls us. If we try to \ntravel into an alternate reality where we arent yet born, we simply wont be \nable to go there. Likweise, if we tried to travel to a future where we were \nalready dead, we couldnt reach it. But the good thing is none of this would \naffect the life you live NOW, according to modern theories. The butterfly \neffect is no longer accepted by many experts because of this. So in essence \nwe always think that a tie machine would allow us to control time. Wrong, \nit allows us to control portals to certain time periods. If we dont exist \nin a certain time frame in a certain portal, one could not travel there. \nThis is why many time travel experts now believe portals to available time \nframes are now more important than creating time machines. What could is \nmaking a time machine if we couldnt travel through it? Some are even saying \ntime machines are going to have to be personalized to each user. We are \ngoing to have to figure out which time portals you exist in in the past and \nfuture and then make a time machine that can take you there, but only you \nsince it would just be your past and future. Point is, we are further from \ntime traveling than we thought. Alternate time dimensions need to be \nunderstood and studied more. I wouldnt expect it to happen in our lifetime. \nBut once it does happen, theoretically you will only be able to go into \nYOUR past and your future, not someone else's or the worlds in general. \nGood thing is since time is infiitie, its highly likely you exist in a \nmulitple time periods. In fact, since time is infinite, you are too really. \nBut time is split up into portals and sectors so we would have to find out \nwhere you exist in certain pasts and futures.",
