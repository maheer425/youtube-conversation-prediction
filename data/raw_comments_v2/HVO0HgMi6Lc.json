motion is 2pi spiral.. .  .And all direction is 4pi spherically \ncurved.. .  .\nVibrating sinusoidal spherical wave-fronts of only motion forms Einstein's \ncurvature of space-time.. .  .\n\nLight waves from all time dilating inertial ref-frames (within every \nobservable spherical region of the infinite universe) cascading downward \nfrom a distance radius combine forming the sinusoidal wave medium density \n(space) compressing and de-compressing two opposing vortices at each and \nevery point of space, or contracting and expanding virtual pair's popping \nout of existence.. .  .\n\nThe total amplitude formed by a rings series of inward spherical waves \ncoming into every point.  . ..Colliding at maximum compression points at \nwave crests and wave troughs always seeks a minimum.  . ..Are equally \nbalanced by opposite expansion at interchanging compression points.  . ..As \ntrillions of waves cancel the sum of opposite vectors mathematically is \nalways zero.  . ..Leaving space with an average temperature, or pressure \nstillness of the wave amplitude squared.. .  .\n\nThis polarized superposition of the wave amplitude squared is the reason \nfor entanglement for the symmetry or conservation laws in human physics or \nwhy, at the speed of C, time and space are zero due to length contraction \nand time dilation.. .  .Or why, the point of charge Q is the same for the \nentire surface of an expanding light sphere.. .  .Because the polarization \nbetween the crests and troughs will remain the same (sharing the same \nexpanding moment of time) no matter how large it becomes until acted upon \nby an external force.. .  .\n\nVibrating sinusoidal spherical wavefronts always transverse one unit of \nspace/ per one unit of time.  . ..Huygens wavelets forming the wavefronts \nare rather like drops of water into a pond dividing one unit of space/ \nmultiplied by one unit of time.. .  .Like the bits, or zeros and ones of a \ncomputer screen the Planck's constant is continuously forming a blank \ncanvas in a sense they are vibrations on the edge between space and time.. \n.  .As time unfolds light is simply space divided by time entanglement and \nnothing else.. .  .That implies a strict equivalence between time and space \nwith light as a constant conversion unit between the two.. .  .\n\nElectrical potential is the same as future potential imploding within a \nref-frame or object.  . ..And therefore the Lorentz contraction of time and \nspace is infinite in our universe within the active cores of galaxies.. .  .\n\nImplosive inward energy compression contracting time and space where the \nvirtual pair's formed by 4pi R2's cannot escape from being multiplied to \ninfinity t=0.  . ..forming an equal and opposite explosive de-compression \nof Cosmic ray jets and Synchrotron radiation expanding outward via the \npoles.. .  .\nA sort of fusion of wave and emission of new Cosmic rays.. .  .Cosmic rays \nare 89% hydrogen nuclei, 10% helium nuclei, and 1% everything else!!\n\nAtomic particles are really high wave amplitude wave centres of pure \nvibration from regions of intense wave pressure made of vibrating \nwavefronts called shells in particle physics, or spherical standing wave \nstructures over a period of time.. .  .\n\nAll particles are 3D wave centres of pure vibration!!.. .  .Their output \nwas the negation of their input: 0 goes to 1,1 to 0.. .  .the start of a \nFibonacci spiral.. .  .\n\nAll motion is 2pi spiral.. .  .And all direction is 4pi spherically \ncurved.. .  .\nVibrating sinusoidal spherical wave-fronts of only motion forms Einstein's \ncurvature of spacetime.. .  . \n\nAnd thereafter on another fractal level.  . ..Stimulated emission is a \nprocess by the way of which a higher energy quantum mechanical state of an \natomic particle absorbing energy +1=0 now is being converted to a lower \nlevel -1 resulting in the production of light photon oscillations, or new \nelectromagnetic vibrations.. .  .\nA sort of fusion of wave and emission of new quantized spherical wavefronts \nof electromagnetic radiation independent of the motion of its source.. .  . \n\nThe One electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous flow of vibrating energy \ntherefore light is a wave and it was time that was quantized.. .  .\nSpacetime was quantized into moments.. .  .Only the frequency now \nis relative at each dipole moment of time.. .  . \n\nBecause everything is formed by a locational 4pi spherical inward \nabsorption t=0 and outward emission of electromagnetic waves that's forming \nresonance antimatter matter annihilation forming positive and negative \nelectric charge and electromagnetic interference fields as time unfolds \nC2 transverses the inward acceleration or gravitation wavefront by \nwavefront as time unfolds.. .  .\n\nSpace is a division of solidity into entropy C2 the second law of \nthermodynamics.. .  .But also E2= a multiplication of volume at the expense \nof gravitational potential.. .  .\n\nThe fact that this tiny spherical region of the infinite universe has a \nlimited observable range as the waves come from a distance radius, now is \nobservable in the shape of an inverse sphere.  . ..4pi R2.. .  .\nAnd the fact that the electron is a perfectly round vibrating sphere.. .  \n.Are two sides of the same + and - coin!!\n\nThere exists only two combinations of these two spherical + and - \nelectromagnetic sine waves, or wavefronts multiplying inward =1=0 now \n-1 dividing at right angles from their sources.. .  .\nThey have opposite vectors and quantum spin forming the positron and \nelectron wave centre.. .  .4pi R2=/N pi Re2.. .  .\nOr \"the two dipole energy states of Qubit's\" in quantum computing which can \nbe such things as photons, trapped ions, atoms, electrons, and nuclear \nspins, made of vibrating wavefronts called shells in particle physics, or \nspherical standing wave structures over a period of time.. .  .Their output \nwas the negation of their input: 0 goes to 1,1 to 0.. . .the start of a \nFibonacci spiral.. .  .\nTherefore generation of \"any information exceeds radiation during the first \nhalf of the cycle +1=0 now radiation exceeds generation during the second \nhalf of the cycle.. .  . \n\nTime is inverse multiplying +4-0-4+- dividing like frequency and \nwavelength.. .  .\n\nTime is shorter at one's feet than at their head, because of the geometry \nbasically the greater the energy compression contracting spacetime=0 now \nthe shorter the expanding wavelengths dividing acceleration or gravitation \naway from its source in unison.. .  .\nThe amount of radiation compressing the wave amplitude reaching 1 meter, \nthen will be one-fourth as much at 2 meters, hence one-fourth the \nintensity.. .  .Thus objects just free fall towards the greatest energy \ncompression, or shortest rate that time flows.. .  .  \nSimply because generation of \"any information\" exceeds radiation during the \nfirst half of the cycle +1=0 now -1 radiation exceeds generation during the \nsecond half of the cycle.. .  .\nGravitational systems -1 are the ashes from prior electrical systems +1=0.  \n. ..as the surface of the light sphere increases with the square of the \nradius the strength of the gravitational field transverse Q inversely \nproportional to the square of the distance from the source of that constant \nexpanding light sphere.. .  .\n\nConcentrated spheres at right angles such as electrons, onions, the Earth \nand Sun, are surrounded by now slice layers of light of equal pressures.. \n.  .Clouds float around the Earth in them.. .  .The reason they float in \ncurves parallel to the Earth is because of these equipotential planes of \npressures which curve as the Earth curves.. .  .\nSpherically curved planes of pressures act as lenses to multiply and divide \nlight radially because everything is contracting and expanding a locational \n4pi spherical inward absorption t=0 and outward emission of electromagnetic \nwaves.. .  .\n\nAnd that constant outward division now from the Sun transverses the inward \nforce called gravity as time unfolds C2 takes about eight minutes to reach \nEarth.. .  .\nAnd likewise the constant outward momentum of the light from Earth forms \nthe inward acceleration in unison as time unfolds C2 from the continuous \nstimulated emissions.. .  .and contracting spacetime at the bare clay \ncentres within the solar vortex where the solar and planetary gravities \nmeet within the solar vortex.. .  .\n \nAs their individual light spheres super impose crests and troughs become in \nphase now, their space time line symmetries will synchronize, or amplify by \nmultiplying electrical potential along cubic dynameters compressing the \nwave amplitude +4-0-4+- now the shorter the expanding wavelengths dividing \nacceleration or gravitation away from its source in unison.. .  .\n\nAnd as all the light spheres from all the stars of a galaxy.. .  \n. eventually all their spheres will super impose as crests and troughs \nbecome in phase now, their space time line symmetries will synchronize, or \namplify by compressing the wave amplitude +4-0-4+- now the shorter the \nexpanding wavelengths dividing acceleration away from its source in \nunison.. .  . \n\nTherefore relative to the perspective of an outside observer at the centre \nof their own time line of broken symmetry, there is no dark matter!\n\nAnd as those vibrating sinusoidal spherical wavefronts propagate through \nextremely cold low pressure density regions of space acting upon the wave \namplitude the wavelengths simply become longer as they spread out over \nbillions of light years.. .   .Therefore the big bang never happened.. .  \n.And the cosmic microwave background radiation mainly comes from all the \ncold hydrogen at the centre of their own 3D ref-frames spherically \ndistributed around us.. .  .\n\nIn other words this an energy displacement called a redshift interpreted as \nreceding velocities of galaxies is actually a consequence of less energy \nexchange with distance, less wave interactions oscillating in between time \ndilating gravitational gradients with distance.. .  .And Doppler causes a \nredshift because light in a vacuum is a constant wave chain reaction from A \nto B.. .  .\n\nBut what if the big bang really did happen?\nLight emitted now from all matter, from the star's, and the galaxies of \nperpetual systems are forever passing out into the infinite ocean of Zero \nKelvin, of 'empty space' never to return and without ever coming into \ncontact with objects of that nature.. .  .\nThat kind of tiny finite island big bang material universe would be \ndestined to become gradually but systematically impoverished and the \nevolution of perpetual systems would never had happened.. .  .\nBut luckily for us our universe is not like this.. .  . Since Mach's \nPrinciple: \"All inertial ref-frames are determined by the composite matter \nof the universe\", was the basis for Einstein's theory of relativity.. .  .\n\nAll things come out from the One and the One out from all things.. .  .\n\nI only see becoming.  . ..Be not deceived.. .  .It is not the fault of the \nessence of vibration!!\nBut it is the fault of your limited outlook.. .  . if you see firm land \neverywhere within the oceans of becoming and passing.. .  .You need names \nfor things just as if they had a rigid permanence.. .  .But the very river \nin which you bathe a second time in the future.. .  . is no longer the same \nwater that you entered before in the past.. .  .\n\nVibrating matter is simulating rest and balance now through violent motion!!\n\nVibrating matter is a fine mixture of + and - electric charges coming into \nand out of existence.. .  .\nAntimatter positive electric charge and Matter negative electric charge \nforms a profound and perfect symmetry forming and breaking and when that \nsymmetry is broken forms the imperfect spiral symmetry of the Fibonacci \nsequence.. .  .\n\nEinstein believed out of the worlds religions Buddhism was the closest to \nthe truth!\nBuddha said a long time ago, that it was rather like looking a the waves \ncoming to a sea shore!! \n\nThe magnetic fields are always at right angles to the direction of the \nelectric current.. .  .And this is rather like a series of wavefronts at \nright angles coming to a seashore.. .  .\n\nAntimatter matter annihilation is like looking at the water receding from \nthe seashore (universe) +1 into the bass of each wavefront forming t=0 and \nbreaking at the crest of time p0p-1 resulting in the production of \nexpanding bubbles +4-0-4+- independent of the motion of its source.. .  .\nA wave comes +1=0 and breaks now, it withdraws or contracts as another wave \ncomes +1=0 and breaks now, it withdraws or contracts as another wave comes \n+1=0 and breaks now, it withdraws or contacts as another wave comes +1=0 \nwhich may contain much of the same water as before.. .  .Generation of any \ninformation exceeds radiation during the first half of the cycle +1=0 now \nradiation exceeds generation during the second half of the cycle.. .  \n. Only the two dipole energy states of an electron is a 3D wave centre made \nof vibrating wavefronts concentrically layered in shape, rather like an \nonion!!\n\nInput and output is a process of spherical symmetry forming and breaking.. \n.  .\n\nAll information is recorded electro dipole magnetically via two equal \npair's of opposite expression.. .  .Each of the pair cancels the other out \nin cyclic periodicities.. .  .Each of the pair then becomes what the other \nwas..  . .\nAs the frequency gets higher the Planck's constant will be multiplied by a \nlarger amount and the time period will slow down within that ref-frame.. .  \n.\n\nStimulated emission is a process by the way of which a higher energy \nquantum mechanical state of an atomic particle absorbing energy +1=0 now \nbeing converted to a lower level resulting in the production of light \nphoton oscillations, or new electromagnetic vibrations.. .  .\nA sort of fusion of wave and emission of new quantized spherical wavefronts \nof electromagnetic radiation independent of the motion of its source.. .  .\n\nBecause everything is formed by a locational 4pi spherical inward \nabsorption t=0 and outward emission of electromagnetic waves that's forming \nresonance antimatter matter annihilation, forming positive and negative \nelectric charge and.. .  . electromagnetic interference fields as time \nunfolds C2.. .  .\n\nThe Fourier Transforms actually proves that the big bang theory is wrong \nbecause time, is in fact, inverse multiplying and dividing like frequency \nand wavelength.. .  .\n\nTherefore It all started with a big bang output division.. .  . By tracing \ntime back to a point in the past was a huge misconception!!!\n\nSince Dirac's discovery of antimatter E=+m.c2.. .  .The conversion is a \nratio between opposite vectors interpreted as distance and time, physical \nreality and spiritual reality, annihilation and creation, matter and \nantimatter, mass and energy, or interference and resonance within an \nabstract arrow of time of Cnow at the centre of their own 3D ref-frames \nwithin the One Infinite Universe.. .  .\n\nAnd therefore the traditional assumption where space is three dimensional, \nand time plays the role of a fourth dimension is inaccurate.. .  .\n\nIf we would want to study the origin's of the universe we would actually \nhave to look \"forward,\" since Cnow's time input resonance vector direction \n+1=0 now is opposite to -1 the arrow of distance as time unfolds all the \ninterference from their sources that we then perceive as an expanding \nuniverse.. .  .\n\nSee: E=mc2 is wrong Sixty Symbols, and Quantum Atom Theory!\n\nThe Higgs bosons from Higgs filed are actually just photon oscillations, or \nelectromagnetic vibrations.. .  .Which is the same as the future \nprobability wave function in quantum physics.. .  . \nMilo Wolff called them Positron Waves from the Universe.  . .. And remember \nin 3D space there exists only two spherical waves at right angles \nmultiplying inward + and - dividing outward at right angles from its \nsource.. .  .\nWalter Russel called them Cathode waves.  . ..And the Master Minds of \nancient India where all our modern mathematics comes from called them \"Gift \nWaves from the Cosmic whole.\"\n\nThis zero point field gives us a starting point or concept of zero in \nmathematics.\n \nBecause everything is formed by a locational 4pi spherical inward \nabsorption +1=0 now -1 outward emission of electromagnetic waves.. .  \n.That's enfolding the organization process for the continuous \ndisorganization of statistical entropy as time unfolds.. .  .Their output \nwas the negation of their input: 0 goes to 1,1 to 0.. .  .the start of \na Fibonacci spiral.. .  .Spherical logarithms forming and breaking \nexponential spirals.. .  .Therefore Mass is a Constant De-compression.. .  \n. as the constant outward momentum of EMR repels like charged particles \nabsorbing energy compression +1=0 and emitting the density from the two \nprevious vectors spiralling out the Fibonacci sequence seen \nalmost everywhere in nature.. .  . from spirals of elements, to DNA, \nand billions of microfilaments spiralling out from the zero point field now \nwithin each neuron of the brain into microtubule lattice structures.. .  .\n\nAnd the human brain consists of approximately one hundred billion neurons.. \n.  .\n(Mans mind mirrors a Universe that mirrors mans Mind)\nEach neuron has a voltage which changes when ions flow inward and outward \nfrom a cell.. .  .\nOnce a neurons voltage reaches a certain level of subconscious energy \ncompression t=0 now it will consciously fire (C) a new electrical signal to \nother cells, which will then repeat the process.. .  .\n\nTherefore we all have free will to consciously project new electrical \nsignals as time unfolds.. .  .And depending which neurons gets stimulated \nthrough repetition, certain neural connections may become stronger and more \nefficient, whilst others may become weaker as time unfolds statistical \nentropy.. .  .This is called Neuroplasticity.. .  .\n\nThe mirror neuron dose not know the difference between it and others.. .  .\nBecause antimatter energy input is just the opposite phase represents the \npast, and is always instantaneously cancelled out relative to background \nwaves in the future, that must propagate non linearly at the central region \nproducing two coupling resonance.. .  .We then upon observing the outward \nwaves from their sources call that process of change \"charge.\" \n\nEnergy is vibrating sinusoidal spherical wave-fronts of only motion \nmultiplying inward +1=0 now 1 dividing outward at right angles from their \nsources.. .  .All motion is 2pi spiral.. .  .And all direction is 4pi \nspherically curved.. .  .Mass plasma field vector of every observable \nspherical region of the infinite universe +Mu acting upon every point of \nspace accelerating mass +/-m from a distance radius.. .  .Energy of \nGravitation =Eg= +m. +Mu G/r2.. .  .Gravitational systems -1 are the ashes \nfrom prior electrical systems +1=0.  . ..As the frequency gets higher the \nPlanck's constant will be multiplied by a larger amount oscillating photons \nwithin that 3D centred ref-frame the time period will slow down from that \nobject relative to an observer at the centre of their own time line of \nbroken symmetry.\"\ufeff",
