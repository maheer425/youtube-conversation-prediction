The worst thing that's happened to me on shrooms is I feel a \nlittle nauseous but it always passes and doesn't even ever happen anymore \nactually.\n\nI also had more experience with shrooms when I was young and care free and \nhardly knew what to expect so my happiest times were definitely on \nmushrooms. Mushrooms are what opened up me and my friends to this new \npsychedelic world. Not to mention I've gone much further and deeper on \nmushrooms than on acid. I'm sure you can go very deep on LSD I just don't \nhave any experience with high doses so I couldn't tell you what happens \nthen.\n\nI had good times on LSD but I got my hands on it after I had already done \nshrooms dozens of times so it wasn't \"too life changing\" or shocking but it \nwas still very profound. I think it's because when I got my hands on good \nacid was when I wasn't even a carefree kid anymore I was pretty much a \nyoung adult with shit to do so they had a different tone. I took acid at a \nstrange place in my life. \n\nI totally understand why some people like acid better and think bad trips \nare more likely to happen on shrooms but for me that's just part of the fun \nI guess. They seem to be more unpredictable than acid and have a lot more \ntricks up their sleeves and I suppose this strange 'presence' like it has a \nmind of it's own and it's trying to tell you something. Terence McKenna \nsays one of the differences between mushrooms and all other psychedelics is \nthat mushrooms have a voice and it speaks. Mushrooms also seem to have this \nlighthearted emotional bias to them that just makes me so happy. Also on \ndecent doses of mushrooms (especially at night) I get this 'coming home' \nfeeling like this place that my soul immediately recognizes. It's beyond \ncrazy and bizarre but it feels so comfortable and familiar like you've been \nthere many times before. Not to mention this \"place\" feels very ancient and \nalien. ",

The fact is that I find acid a much easier \nsubstance as I stated earlier. Acid hits the spot, no extra fuzz. But there \ncertainly exists the potential for bad trips with mushrooms if you are \nsensitive to toxins and don't have experience.  But I say this again, there \nis plenty of difference between different mushrooms, copelandia, one of my \nfavorites, hits you (me) hard and is quite energetic .. on the neutral side \nI tend to get odd experiences of something touching my body which may \ninterrupt your tripping for a sec. Although all the \"confusing\" (for me and \nall of who I know of) parts of the mushroom trips happens early on the \ntrip, it certainly has a strange twist compared to acid. But yeah, they are \nquite closely related, and I guess there would be a potential to fail a \n\"blind test\",certainly if one is new to the game or haven't done it for a \nwhile.",

            "text": "+daturave ya no FUCK acid lasts longer Einstein. I've tried many \npsychedelics and I do consider myself the connoisseur type when it comes to \nthis stuff, other psychedelics I've had are not even comparable to acid or \nshrooms because they are completely different even though they also have \npsychedelic effects so I damn well know how to tell the difference. I'm not \nsaying it just because they are both simply psychedelic come on now.\n\nI'll admit they are not exactly the same and do have small differences but \nthese differences are more qualitative than quantitative. In other words \none does not produce more than the other when it comes to things like \nvisuals. Sure the visuals are slightly different on some small levels but \none is certainly not 'more visual than the other'. For me the main \ndifferences are mushrooms seem to be more sedative and emotional and LSD \nmore stimulating. On LSD I also get more kaleidoscopic type visuals \noccasionally which I've never had on mushrooms and I also get time loops \n(time repeating itself) on LSD but never on shrooms. On LSD the colors also \nseem to be more runny and \"liquidy\" and on shrooms the colors seem more \nsaturated. Differences like these yes but the effects are still near \nidentical. The main difference is the head space but the head space of acid \nis not crazier than shrooms just a little different. On LSD i'd rather \nlisten to Jimi Hendrix or The Beatles but on shrooms I'd rather listen to \nJefferson Airplane or Led Zeppelin. Just different moods and tones. \n\nEven though they do have these various subtle differences they are still \nmuch MUCH more similar than they are different and the OP's comment makes \nno sense. There's no reason someone should be able to handle mushrooms fine \nyet consider acid \"a whole different ball park.\" That's COMPLETE and utter \nbullshit they are both crazy as fuck. If you don't think shrooms are crazy \nas fuck just like acid you're getting ripped the fuck off!\n\nSorry but it just annoys the shit out of me when people say acid is crazier \nthan shrooms, makes absolutely no sense. IMO nothing touches or comes close \nto the big three that being; DMT, LSD and Psilocybin Mushrooms. They all \nseem very high above everything else and they all feel very similar like \nthey're all cracking to the same place. Even mescaline and the 2Cs don't \ncompare on any level. There just must be a lot of people out there getting \nincredibly weak shrooms or something acid is not any crazier.",
