The droplet \nwill be forced by gravity to go to the lowest point, and if it is stable \nenough, and if the stove is clean, the droplet will start to spin around \nit's own axis. And it will spin really fast. Above some speeds the droplet \neven starts to oscillate through certain patterns, and there is a really \ncool star-shaped pattern that appears if you are patient enough. It can be \nseen from the side that the droplet is spinning amazingly fast.\nAlso, if the droplet is big enough a bubble will sporadically form in the \ncenter, not quite bursting through the surface-tension, but big enough to \nlift the drop and increase the rate it is spinning at. When the bubble \ncollapses it will cause the bubble to all kinds of things, ejecting \ndroplets, bounce up and down, reverse the direction of spin, or form the \nstar-shaped I mentioned.
