Fact: As you saw in the video its shows an \nexample of the visible light spectrum with red being on the lefthand side \nand blue on the righthand side. Now you might be saying, \"Hey wait, purple \nis on the righthand side not blue, I think you are colorblind.\", just to \nmake sure there are no misunderstandings (which I am sure there will be) I \nam speaking about the primary colors. With red and blue on the opposite \nends of the visible light spectrum, how do we see purple? Well purple or \nmagenta is and imaginary color. Yep thats right suprised me aswell, if that \ndidn't suprise you well it didn't. It has no wavelength so it is an \nillusion. Just like yellow with red and green mixed you will not \ndifferentiate the red and green colors, instead you will see yellow even \nthough orange is in between red and green. Yellow is not a primary color in \nthe visible light spectrum. It does have a wavelength because it is inside \nthe visible light spectrum. Purple does not because it it created by the \ntwo primary colors on the ends of the visible light spectrum. But yellow \nand blue make green even though red and green make yellow... this is \nconfusing.\n\nRods: The retinas 'motion' receptors, not night vision receptors. Some \npeople use a thing called averted vision by using your eyes periferals \nwhich have the biggest density of rods to see far away objects more clearly \nand see motion better.\n\nThe Tapidus Lucidum (correct me if I am wrong on that one.: This is what \nanimals like dogs have. This allows them to see in the dark because it \ncaptures protons in the retina and sends them back out. You can see this \neffect by using the flash mechanism on your phone and taking a picture of \nyour, for example, dog. The animals eyes appear to be glowing right, this \nis the tapidus lucidum at work. I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT THIS WILL WORK \nFOR EVERYONE AND I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM DONE TO ANY \nANIMALS OR PEOPLE, DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nIf I am wrong about anything I will accept corrections in the reply \nsection.\ufeff",
