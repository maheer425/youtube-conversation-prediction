First \noff, all that can really be known is that \"there is currently lead there.\" \n... variables happen.  Not everything forms the same and random events \naren't always predictably random. \n\nBut, assume that rock is 4.4 billion years old.  It, like much of our \nplanet could have come from meteors without the earth being that old.  Or, \nit could have been on earth that long without going against anything \nbiblical.    Yes, some fringe fundamentalists count back human history \n6,000 years and assume the universe is only 6,000 years old.   This is not \na logical or biblical assumption. The biblical creation account could have \nhappened over any length of time... perhaps instantly... or, based on what \nwe can observe, perhaps it happened over billions of years. \n\nThe idea that the speed of the earth's rotation should be used as a unit of \nmeasurement of time before the earth existed is a bit silly. \n\n\nSomeone also mentioned the \"can an omnipotent deity create a rock so big he \ncan't lift\" paradox.\n\n... the answer is no.  If something has no limit, the impossibility of \nreaching a non-existent limit isn't, in itself, a limit.   It's not even a \nparadox.  Just a poorly worded question involving a very simple concept \npeople overcomplicate.\n\nIt's like asking \"if the universe is infinite, where's the edge?\"  There \nisn't one.  Get over it. There is likely a finite area where matter exists, \nbut just because matter isn't in an area doesn't mean there isn't space \nthere for matter to eventually expand into. \n\nPeople need to stop being so afraid of the concept of infinite things.   \nAll the best stuff is infinite.\ufeff",

This is because half-lives are \nvaried, but tend toward a central mean over time.  For example, imagine \nflipping a coin.  If you have three flips, you could get 0, 50, or 100 \npercent chance of getting heads.  This has no central average.  However, if \nyou flip hundreds of coins, or have hundreds of half-lives, it averages \nout.  Still not 100 percent accurate, but a darn good estimation.\n\nFinally, I'm guessing you are a Christian.  I am also making the assumption \nthat you think God created the earth 6000-10000 years ago.  To this I have \none response: how do you know?  How do you know that God didn't spend a \nbillion years creating the universe, as there was no definition of a day \nbefore day and night?  How do you know Adam and Eve didn't spend millions \nof years in the Garden of Eden, as it was an era before death?  Heck, how \ndo you know God's not just trolling all of us by changing the proportions \nof radioactive isotopes, as he is omnipotent and mysterious?\n\nI admire your logical deduction here, but everything you are saying comes \nfrom a very surface-level and narrow-minded knowledge of your sources. \n Keep in mind that I am not contradicting your belief; I myself am after \nall a Christian.  I am just saying that you should look more into your own \nclaims instead of blindly following what people wail on about.",
