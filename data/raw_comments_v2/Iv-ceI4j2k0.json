I live \nin Palestine and go to one of the very few English-speaking schools in the \nWest Bank. I came across your books a few years ago, and since then have \nbeen spreading the word to my fellow Arabs. We now have a small community \nof your fans who proudly identify as nerdfighters.\nAs you know, we live under occupation, which seldom gives us any \nopportunity for economical, emotional, physical, educational, and mental \ngrowth. We are limited. We are denied basic human rights.\nDespite this, someone opened the first legit movie theater in Palestine \nless than a month ago. Just in time for TFiOS. I was ecstatic, and I loved \nthe movie (although I liked the book more and was pissed off that some \nlittle things were left out like the fact that we didn\u2019t hear Augustus\u2019 \nparents fighting with him, or the fact that Augustus and Hazel had their \ndate by a stream not a restaurant! .. although the restaurant was very \nbeautiful I must say).\nJohn, a lot of violence has been happening in this part of the world. \nInnocent children are being murdered, and no one is being held responsible. \nHundreds of Palestinians, young and old, are in Israeli prisons under \n\u201cadministrative detention\u201d. The Israeli soldiers came into my town just the \nother week and burst into a house and basically flipped it upside down and \nleft. Yesterday morning a 15 year old boy was taken by an Israeli settler \nand was beaten and burned to death. Yesterday night, a young girl was a \nvictim of an intended hit and run and is currently being hospitalized. \nThere is rumor of 3 Jewish boys being kidnapped and murdered by \nPalestinians in Hebron, but we haven\u2019t seen pictures of their identified \nbodies. All of the stories that I mentioned earlier can be backed up with \npictures all found on the internet.\nI know you are an advocate of helping people with cancer, but I was hoping \nyou could also be an advocate of social justice.\nI don\u2019t want you to feel burdened with all of this, but I was just \nwondering if you could make a vlog about this situation and mention \nPalestinians. If you could even do a little shout out to your Palestinian \nnerdfighters that would be amazing. We really love you John, and Hank too! \nThank you for sharing your talent with us.\nI guess I\u2019ll end with this: In a seemingly hopeless situation, they \nfashioned within their souls a creative optimism that strengthened them. \nTheir bottomless vitality transformed the darkness of frustration into the \nlight of hope.\nThat was from Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cStrength to Love\u201d which I\u2019m currently \nreading. And again John, thanks for being a little light of hope.\nI really hope I don\u2019t sound cheesy,\nFellow nerdfighter, \nRachel\n\nI commented that message in early July on one of your websites, and I guess \nyou don't check that website. When I saw this vlog, it reminded me of the \nmessage and I decided to find it and post it again. Hoping to hear from you \nthis time. \ufeff",

Try to think about some of the criticism, \nbut not all of it, because that's gonna make you feel like a failure when \nyou're not. (And if you know how to do that, do tell me.) I found out about \nyou because of your books and I still love most of them, but when I \ndiscovered this whole thing, it's what made me think of you as one of the \nmost commited and intelligent people I have ever come across. Sometimes you \nsay things I disagree with, and very rarely you say things that are pretty \nmuch not true, but unlike most other people in this world (including me \nmost of the time), when you're actually wrong, you admit it. I don't want \nto say that's \"amazing\" or \"great\" or \"incredible\" because it's makes it \nsound like you're superhuman when to me, you seem like a normal guy who \njust makes a really big effort to do good things, which is like the best \nthing you can do.  \ufeff",
