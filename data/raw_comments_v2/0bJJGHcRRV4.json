Then the music gets more and \nmore energetic for the next 15 minutes, the last 5 minutes of which I plan \non getting up. Then, in case that doesn't properly wake me up, I have a \nbuzzer alarm go off after 30 minutes total. I still hate getting up, but \nit's much nicer than being jolted awake, plus you get to hear some of your \nfavourite music.\ufeff",
