            "text": "+iloveursis \n1. Yeah, expensive housing in a place where the unemployment rate is \nliterally 1.9% from a 2013 estimate. In a city-state that's comparable to \nNew York or LA. Have you been to LA or New York? They have the exact same \nproblem as Singapore, which is a byproduct of having a nation with high \neducation and high commerce. Not even including subsidized housing, which \nmakes this a non-problem. Besides, why this and your non-problem of \"high \nminister salaries\" are not as big of issues as you make it out to be is....\n\n2. Its economic policies WORK. Who gives a shit that the minister is paid a \nlot? That has very little effect on the economy. DESPITE this, Lee Hsien \nLoong took a 36% paycut (\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2082124/Lee-Hsien-Loong-Singapores-Prime-Minister-earn-1-7m-36-pay-cut.html). \nAnd the news is very misleading. While the base salaries of these people \nare higher than that of Obama or other first world leaders, lobby money and \ncommission account for far more of Obama's salary than Lee Hsein Loong. At \nleast he's transparent. \n\nFurthermore, this cements the idea that your MERIT determines your worth in \nthe workforce. The average income of a Singaporean is $57,000 US dollars (\nhttp://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-money-do-the-top-income-earners-make-percent/), \nrounded a bit. It's actually a few hundred dollars higher. See the source. \nFurthermore, the government still supplements the income of low skilled \nworkers so they can still live fairly well off compared to migrant workers \nand low skilled workers in other first world nations. Income disparity is \nnot always indicative of poverty, though there is a strong correlation. \n\nRemember, also, that there are trade and labor unions all throughout the \nnation. \n\n3. Until you've been to the subways of New York, you have no right to say \nthat Singapore's train system sucks. No train system ever works 100% of the \ntime but I've heard nothing but good things about Singapore from tourists \nand residents. As for transport fares, it's again, a byproduct of living in \na city the size of New York, give or take. \n\n4. The mandatory conscription that you say is, \"cheap singaporean male \nlabor,\" is present all throughout Asia. While I disagree with the idea of \ngiving up higher education for 2 years to be forced to train for a few \nmonths and stand around with your thumb up your ass, it's not some uncommon \ntotalitarian policy. Furthermore, remember that nations such as the US do \nnot have this policy because they don't have neighbors that could invade \nthem at any time or terrorist cells in nations right next to Singapore. \nThat's why South Korea has this policy as well, despite being a democratic \nnation. \n\n5. Cheap labor isn't gotten from Singapore by gagging Malaysians and \nimporting them through the black market. They're gained because Malaysians \nWANT to work. Singapore has a surplus of jobs in the low skill sector and \nthe regional market is there to say, \"hey, I want some of that surplus. \nIt's low skill so I don't expect pay equivalent to a scientist or \nengineer.\" And Singapore happily obliges. \n\n6. In Singapore, I can watch any Youtube video I want, torrent a few \nmovies, watch Netflix, and browse any news story I want. I might be put on \na few lists but in this day and age, what nation on Earth DOESN'T have a \nlist? This isn't 1989. No nation can reasonably censor anything anymore \nanyhow. However, I do concede that even the policies that allow Singapore \nto do this existing is a problem but it's becoming less and less of a \nproblem. \n\n7. If I had to characterize Singapore in one word, I would say, \n\"Technocracy.\" Which is cool as shit.",

Our rail system is maintained regularly. Only \nonce in my 8 years of travelling by MRT did I encounter a breakdown. Buses \nwere immediately deployed to bring commuters to their destinations. The \nfare increases - of a few cents - are fully justified for the convenience \nand billions spent so far. For 2 years the army boys get free food, lodging \nand allowance while being trained. I enjoy reading the papers and watching \nCNA because of the wide - ranging coverage of world events. Im not \ninterested in the other channels so I can't comment. But the few times I \nhappen to watch the other Channels, I see local and foreign dramas. As for \nthe high ministers' salaries pegged to that of the heads of large \ncorporations, I feel it is fair. There is nothing to stop anyone from \ntaking over the reins of running this nation but are they capable enough to \nmaintain the momentum and even improve on it. If so, I believe Singaporeans \nare matured enough to trust their lives to them. The day 100% love to pay \nand pay for peace and security, you can say it is a police state but 60%? \n40% is under what state?\ufeff A police state where I walk around daily in \nfreedom to enjoy the order is power in every sense of the word.
