This is \njust an intuitive thought though, so those who have more in-depth knowledge \nplease correct me if I'm wrong. Here is my explanation:\n\nThe video is fantastic! But it does get one thing wrong. When the cat is \nstationary, and current flows in the wire, negative charges are not the \nonly ones moving. When you have flow of charge through a conductor you need \nto have equal and opposite flow of positive and negative charges in order \nto not have any charge buildup. This would be akin to having some system \nthat circulates water around, and for some reason the return pipe is \nclogged and pressure builds up as water flows in from the other side.\n\nIn reality, both the negative and positive charges in the wire are moving \nat equal and opposite velocities. They are appearing to contract from the \nstandpoint of the cat, but since they are both contracting in the same way, \nthey cancel, and there is no net force on the cat.\n\nNow push the cat and give it a velocity in the direction of the current. \nNow one of the charge velocities appears to be going faster, and the other \nslower (sort of like driving on the freeway where cars on your side appear \nto be going slower from your point of view, and cars to the other side are \ngoing freakishly fast since they are heading in the opposite direction). \nNow the length contractions differ, and not only that, but they work \nagainst each other and create a net contraction twice that of what you \nwould experience with a single line of moving charge. This creates a new \nelectric force that we call magnetism!\ufeff",

What you \nstated as shown below proves this.\n\n \"because if we compress electrons they will just force themselves apart\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"but the protons still bound them from wandering off away from the wire.\"\n\nTrue BUT the protons AND the electrical leads are at rest relative to the \nrest frame. You just proved the point I made before. The electrons are \nspreading themselves out equally relative to the rest frame. \n\nIF an ENTIRE bound system flies off at a high speed THEN the distances \nbetween the particles will contract. However, in the case of a wire the \nforces bounding the electrons are at rest relative to the \"at rest\" frame. \nThe electrons will evenly spread themselves out over the length of the \nstring of the \"at rest\" protons comprising the wire. What do you not \nunderstand about this?\n\nThe above will ensure that the wire is neutral in the \"at rest\" frame. The \nunique thing about the \"at rest\" frame is that the string of protons AND \nthe electrical leads are at rest relative to it. Therefore this reference \nframe is unique (relative to the system) and has no magnetic forces.\n\n\nNow onto the next problem. These two should be a given by now:\n\nThe electrons are moving in the ground state.\n\nAlso the charges cancel in the ground state. \n\nI showed these already multiple times.\n\nThe reason the magnetic force arises is because of the velocity addition \nformula in relativity and length contraction due to relativity.\n\nClassically: v1 + v2 = Total V\n\nWalking 2MPH forward on a cruise ship going 20MPH means you are going 22MPH.\n\nRelativity: (v1+ v2)/(1+v1v1/c^2) = Total V\n\nThe above is due to relativity.\n\nI can't make this any more simple than the two equations above. IMPORTANT \nPART: they aren't the same. \n\nThis means that although the charges cancel in the \"rest frame\" in the \nmoving frame the electrons and protons will contract different amounts.\n\nFor example: if the \"cat-ion\" is moving with the electrons the contraction \nwill be a little different for the electrons than for the protons.\n\nElectrons: (ve + V)/(1+veV/c^2) = Total\n\nProtons: V = Total\n\nWhen moving with the electrons the electrons will spread out, the protons \nwill contract, and the cat-ion will repel.\n\nWhen moving opposite to the electrons the electrons will contract MORE than \nthe protons (both contract) because of the velocity addition equation and \nthe \"Cat-ion\" will attract.\n\nWhen \"at rest\" the electrons AND the protons will be equally spaced because \nthe string of protons AND the leads are at rest in that frame. The \nelectrons will therefore spread themselves evenly relative to that frame.",

This thought experiment assumes uniformly moving \ncurrent.\n\nBOTH the electrons are the protons will be equally spaced in the rest frame \nas shown with the math below:\n\nxe = L/n/(1-(ve/c)^2)^.5*(1-(ve/c)^2)^.5\n\n= L/n\n\nxp = L/n\n\nThis describes the charge density of both protons and electrons. The \nelectrons will distribute themselves EQUALLY down the wire. If the \nelectrons were a rigid AKA bound object then the electrons would compress \nthe length between each electron. But they move independently so they \ncompress internally BUT do NOT compress the length between each other. They \nwill balance the forces between them making the distances between \nthemselves equal.

This would be the electric \nfield.\n\n This matches the following:\n\nF = \"gamma\"*(qE + V/c X B) (the B field would be determined by ve, qe, and \nthe distance from the charges). The X \"the cross part\" is also described\n\nSo yes this most definitely works.

They aren't pointing in the same direction \nand they aren't the same distance apart (AKA magnitude or strength).\n\nYes, a changing magnetic field does induce an electric current. A changing \nmagnetic field WILL cause a force. That is one of Maxwell's equations. That \nequation is:\n\nDel X E = \"rate of change of the B field with respect to time\"\n\nA changing B field will create a curling E field (a spinning current). \n\nIt will take force to pass a conductor (say a coil) through two magnets \nbecause the magnets will induce a current in the wire (which takes energy). \nThis is how an electric generator works. A magnet attracts a piece of metal \nwithout its own field by inducing currents in that metal. Those currents \nthen create their own magnetic field.\n\nIn a case such as two coils that have a current forming electromagnets \nthere's a loop of current. You can think of it this way: the charges in the \nother loop want to rotate around the first magnet's field lines BUT the \ncharges are moving and already continuously changing direction because they \nare traveling in a fixed LOOP (or spinning or have intrinsic spin like \natoms). That continuous circular motion constantly adjusts the charge's \ndirection of motion in both coils. This changing direction cancels out the \nrelativistic \"twisting\" effect. The magnetic fields of the two coils WILL \nattempt to induce a current in the other coil. If they cannot they will \nrepel. \n\nSo a uniform magnetic field will cause charges to spin around a field line. \nHowever, a magnetic pole which is caused by a loop of current (or many \nloops like a solenoid) has charges constantly adjusting their direction \nsuch that the force is ALWAYS towards or away (if lined up exactly with \nanother pole). \n\nInside a solenoid (or between to like poles) the charges definitely spin \naround the field lines because the field has a uniform strength. An \napplication of this would be a nuclear fusion chamber that uses magnetic \ncoils to contain super heated plasma that looks like a doughnut (another \nexample is a cyclotron used to study particles).",

            "text": "+Noah Williams and +Ciroluiro \n\nALL magnets work using the same physics. Electromagnets have currents \nmoving in circular loops (usually). Subatomic particles act like little \nelectromagnets with an intrinsic current caused by their intrinsic spin and \ncharge. There are tons of little current loops in a bar magnet formed by \natoms and there are fewer but larger current loops in most electromagnets. \nSpecial relativity and Maxwell's Laws work on all magnets. Special \nrelativity merged with quantum mechanics derives the equations governing \n\"intrinsic magnetic moments\" for particles.\n\n\"cat moved at the same speed but in the opposite direction?\"\n\nThe contraction would be equal but opposite. That is the electrons would do \nwhat the protons did in the video and the protons would do what the \nelectrons did. The Cation would move towards the wire.\n\n\"And why isn't the field drawn like an electric field, with the arrows \npointing outward instead of a circle around it?\"\n\nWell magnetic field lines aren't really a \"thing.\" They represent the \nrelativistic effects of an electric field. In reality a particle wants to \nspin around a magnetic field via the equation F = qvXB. There is an entire \nrelativistic effect not mentioned in the video at all which is a \nrelativistic twisting (expressed by the X which means \"cross product\"). \nObjects don't just contract as they move relative to another reference \nframe but they also twist.  \n\nSay the below is the wire doing the same thing as the video (where the \nelectrons are moving to the right but the charge density for a stationary \ncharge is neutral):\n\n++++++++++++++++\n--------------------------------\n\nA positive charge moving to the right would repel. One to the left would \nattract. That should make sense now. However, what about towards the wire \nand away from it? Well towards the wire via relativity and the \"right hand \nrule\" it would move to the right and away from it it would move to the \nleft. This is because of the twisting effect of relativity. If the magnetic \nfield is strong enough and the speed just right the charge will orbit \naround the magnetic field lines! This is why the field lines form circles \naround the wire. Regardless of the direction the charge is going when it \napproaches a wire at some speed v it will experience a force perpendicular \nto its direction of travel.\n\nIf mv^2/r = qvB you can orbit the magnetic field lines. Or mv/(qr) = B. *This \nis why the magnetic field is drawn as it is so this spinning around can be \neasily handled*.\n\nIn particle physics particles will make neat looking circular loops in \nmagnetic fields. The charge doesn't just repel as shown in the video \nbecause as soon as it starts moving away it changes direction which changes \nthe force the particle experiences (which then changes its direction). The \nEarth's and the Sun's magnetic fields do the same thing. Take the twisted \nfield lines usually found in/by sunspots and prominences. The plasma \n(charged particles) of the Sun will tightly spin around the field lines \ntightly outlining them. The Earth's magnetic field will get high speed \ncharged particles spinning around its field lines with many spinning \ntowards the north or south poles. If the field wasn't present they would \njust crash head on into the Earth. \n\nIn reality a constant B field does NOT increase the velocity of a charge \n(that is cause it to accelerate away only an E field [or a changing B field \nwhich creates an E field] does that) but rather it changes its direction! \nMinutephysics over simplified this topic.",
