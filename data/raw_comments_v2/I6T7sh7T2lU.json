Anyway, as \nbenign as balloons are, I'd have to punch Ellen in the face if she was \nshoving balloons in my face. I love Ellen and I'd feel really bad after \nthat, but it's just a natural reaction for me when people start trying to \nmake a balloon pop because they know it scares me. Love you, Ellen!!!\ufeff",

I never get what's to like about \nporcelain dolls (they look dead) or \"Archie\" puppets; that freaky doll in \nthe Karen Black \"trilogy\" and  \"Magic\" with Anthony Hopkins were bad \nenough, but strangely Chucky didn't scare me. Those creepy dolls look like \nthey belong in a Japanese broken-body ghost horror movie, however.\ufeff",
