I drove a 335i \nsport package sedan for 3 years before the F80 and I find that the F80 \nrides better in every suspension setting then the E90 335i and E46 M3. I \nwould say out of 7 BMW's that I've owned, including an E39 M5, the F80 \nrides the best. It has no body flex when turning into my driveway, it \nreminds me of the way a 996 or 997 feels. I guess I'm not sure what you are \ncomparing it to? Personally, if I wanted it to ride like an S-class, I \nwould have bought an S-class :)\ufeff",

Shorter-stroking engines usually \nmake their peak torque at a higher RPM.\n\nHowever, when comparing engines of similar design, the engine with greater \ntotal displacement typically DOES make more torque.  Of course there are \nmany factors involved that increase or reduce the force acting upon the \npiston.  I'm talking about a scenario where those factors are close to \nequal.\n\nEx.- Ford Coyote 5.0 vs BMW S65 4.0.  They make nearly identical \nhorsepower, but the 5.0 makes a lot more torque, and at lower RPMs.  The \nbasic design of the 2 engines is very similar.  DOHC, 4 valve heads, high \ncompression.  The 5.0 makes roughly 100 lb/ft of torque more than the 4.0. \n While there is a more complex and scientifically correct explanation, the \nsimple answer for why is that it has more displacement.  It's bigger.  Most \nof the added displacement happens to be from a much longer stroke (2.95in \nvs 3.65in).  Add a turbo to the 4.0, and of course the force acting upon \nthe piston becomes much greater, giving it more torque.  \n\nYou can have 2 engines that produce roughly the same peak horsepower, and \nare of the same displacement, but 1 makes more torque at low RPM. \n Typically that would be the longer-stroking engine.  (Ex- Ford Windsor 302 \n4 inch bore, 3-inch stroke (4 x 3) vs. Coyote 5.0, 3.63 x 3.65in.  \n\nUndersquare engines typically make more low-RPM torque when compared to \nother engines of similar total displacement.

The E92's V8 was only a 4 liter engine.  295 \nlb/ft is actually pretty good for a 4 liter n/a.  The LS7 is a 7 liter \nengine, hence the massive torque output.\n\nLong-stroking engines (undersquare) typically make more torque at lower \nRPMs than engines of similar total displacement that have shorter strokes. \n A larger bore, shorter-stroking engine (oversquare) will typically rev \nhigher, but it won't have the low-end grunt.  \n\nObviously there are things that can be done to a square or undersquare \nengine to make it fairly rev-happy.  Ford's Coyote 5.0 is slightly \nundersquare, yet it still happily revs over 7000 rpm.  DOHC valvetrain \ncontrol allows for that.",
