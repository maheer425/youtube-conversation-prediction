I don't personally have a problem with \nyour method but I think you just need to know that crate training isn't \ncruel when used appropriately. A puppy likes to have it's own private place \nwhich is its own territory. It's very useful for toilet training as a pup \nwon't make a mess in it's own sleeping place and it helps it get used to \ntravelling in crates. As long as it's never used as a punishment, it's a \nvery rewarding technique. ",

But if you don't \nwant to risk that, use cheese, that you can cut in cubes. Those are good \ntreats for dogs! I suggest you look info, if your not sure if your puppy \ncan lick/eat peanut butter. Plus, you can ask your vet about his teeth and \nwhat he can and can not eat. So your puppy doesn't use much time on the \nKong toy. You can put it's food in there or find snacks online",
