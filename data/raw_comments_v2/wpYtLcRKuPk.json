If I remember correctly you said the ancient Maya were in the \nstone age in the original video to highlight the technological difference \nbetween us and them, right ? I think that is an unfair and misleading way \nto highlight the difference between us and them.\n\nThe three-age system has been criticized for its f.e. narrow focus and for \nbeing Eurocentric (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-age_system#Criticism). \nThe societies of the world developed in different ways and when you try to \nclassify non-Eurasian societies (societies in Africa and especially in the \nAmericas and Australia) with the three age system you run into major \nproblems. You are then putting f.e. the Mesoamerican civilization (for the \nmost part, the Pur\u00e9pecha (see Tarascan state) people smelted copper \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha_people) in the same category as \nf.e. the early Stonehenge builders, while they were much closer to the \nbronze age and iron age societies of Eurasia in my opnion (not a \nhistorian)).\ufeff",

The Julian calendar had leap years every four \nyears.  The Gregorian calendar dropped 10 days to get the calendar evened \nup with the seasons again and added the rule that century leap years would \nonly occur if the century were divisible by 400.\n\nBritain and the colonies didn't adopt this calendar until 1752, by which \ntime the difference between Julian and Gregorian was 11 days, so they \ndropped 11 days out of September of that year, to the consternation of some \npeople.\n\nI belong to a church which uses the Julian calendar liturgically, and last \ncentury it was 13 days behind.

Every one of the \nmost developed scientific cultures in history has engaged in some sort of \nirrational behavior. In fact, war, imperialism and genocide under were \naccomplished more effectively with science in the modern era. If you \nbelieve that the Modern era was morally and rationally infallible, then you \nare, like the Mayans with human sacrifice, living a myth.\nYou mention 1000's of years - this contradicts your statements, as that \ngoes back well before the modern era, to when Europeans were as \"idiotic\" \nas you mentioned. The fact that you are willing to mention 1000s of years \nof accumulated knowledge, which you are implying that Mayans did not have, \nand in fact every civilization had, makes me guess that you are referring \nto European people. The common narrative is \"science started with Greeks, \npaused, then continued in the modern era.\" This is a racist and false \nnarrative.\nAlso, I never in any way said or implied that they were as well informed as \npeople today. You said that.\nIf you claim to believe in science, then look at science itself \nsystematically. You will find that it is much more broad and deep than the \ncommon myths of Modernity claims. Definition of science: \"the intellectual \nand practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure \nand behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and \nexperiment.\" You cannot create a pyramid without science. Mayans had plenty \nof them. In fact, any technology requires science, even the most simple \nlike clothing, cooking and pottery. It is as old as humanity itself. And \nevery civilization had to have science to even exist as a civilization, \nwhich requires systematic understanding and knowledge. To the degree that \nthere were dedicated scientists and active systematic study varied from \nplace to place, and that is irrelevant. This monopoly on science by Western \nand Modern Civilization is based on a deep seated notion of cultural \nsuperiority of the Whites and the Modern culture that they originated. If \nyou ask many people whether hunter-gatherers had science or Mayans had \nscience, they laugh or get agitated, especially many Western philosophers \nand scientists, whose bestowal of priesthood would be undermined. Like \nthem, I find that everyone here is simply stomping their feet and getting \nupset, because they don't like what I am saying, however reasonable it is. \nSo far everyone has tried to get around what I am saying, rather than \nactually engaging the idea and looking within themselves to seeing where \nthere could be something missing in the way you see the world and regard \nother cultures.\n\n@Monochromicornicopia\"... no, a human-sacrificing, stone-age society with \nneither wheels to pull carts nor glass to make telescopes, didn\u2019t know more \nabout science at the dawn of history than real scientists do today.\"\nI do not see how you cannot see that he is insinuating that they are \nconnected, when he mentions them in the same sentence, as if one has to do \nwith the other.

His \nvideos are in fact about *being* PC, defining something accurately and \nprecisely. If you did in fact enjoy this video, my comments are in fact \nhelping, because it is specifically about correcting mistakes, and I was \nbuilding on that. If you are concerned about PC-ness wasting your time, you \nshould not watch this video - \"Maya\" vs. \"Mayan\" for example is far more \n\"frivolous\" than my statements. And to respond to an actual assertion, \nQuarterMOA890, the Maya are not extinct, there are 6 million ethnic Maya \ntoday, and claim roots with the \"Mayan Civilization\" as a continuity, just \nlike ethnic Greeks do today despite also being railroaded and assimilated \nby Christian states. If this video were in Spanish, many people would have \nbeen deeply offended, but it speaks primarily to certain English-speaking \naudiences. People would have been offended if he insinuated the same \ncultural superiority over Native Americans, which the Maya technically are, \noutside the US. It is common that Americans relate to racism as purely our \npersonal societal experience as if it exists in a vacuum, without a wider \ncontext and a wider mindset and rhetoric.\nI respect CGP Grey, but it appears that he and you have no appreciation and \nin fact embody the the systemic biases and condescending attitudes about \n\"immoral\" and \"irrational\" and \"inferior\" non-Christians, non-Whites and \nnon-Westerners. It is completely over your heads and you completely miss \nthe point. Regardless of being extinct or alive, CGP Grey's comments were \nclearly offensive.
