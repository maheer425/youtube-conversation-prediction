Best case scenario he was incompetent or negligent for \nignoring the memo's. People tried to sweep that under the rug, but if \nsomething reaches the importance of being brought to the president's \nattention, there was a reason. It's reason was scapegoat.\nCole wasn't that long before, a memo stating the guy who did it is planning \nan attack, and instead of increasing security and investigations, there are \nseveral points where agents were informing superiors of things going on and \nthem being taken off whatever they were on, and nothing being done. John P \nO'Neill, being the most prominent, and ironic.\nBut to claim the biggest, intelligence gathering machine, the American \nmilitary industrial complex were caught with their pants down is ludicrous.\nOne of the biggest clues is their behaviour after.\nThe saddest part was watching all these people so opposed to the invasive \nreaction of Bush, snuggled up to it under Obama, the newest face, on the \nexact same product.\nThe true irony is watching two groups who can't look at history and see \nthemselves. There is nothing new under the sun. People are people as they \nhave always been people. This next line is likely to send most of this \ncrowd into a tizzy, but it can't be helped. If it makes your head explode \nyou might want to ask yourself why the vitriolic reaction? Rhetorically of \ncourse.\nBut the earliest ancient text, (blah blah Sumerian, Torah wasn't written \nuntil after Moses died, but was wrote by what was wrote before it. \nAccording to it, every prominent character overlaps creating the \npossibility of a clear passed down geneology Not sure but \"those\" people, \nkeep immaculate records.) lol, I can just hear you screaming at the screen \nin a useless rant.\nBut I digress, substantially, but the earliest text, has 1/4 of the \npopulation as murderers. The known secular history of man isn't any better. \nJust better ways of killing more. That's where most technology is advanced. \nDo you think they developed it so you can text mindlessly back and forth, \nand find a restaurant?\nAnyways, just pointing out that since man starting taking down it's \nhistory, people look at it, and because it isn't them, they can't see they \nare just the next contestants, so they play.\nOne group not realizing they are the oppressed, soon to be written about in \nthe history books, and the other the oppressor who never learns crime \ndoesn't pay.\nEvery single totalitarian regime, except the ones operating today, are dead \nand gone in usually bloody massacres. They never go away quietly into the \nnight.\nThere is a section in that book, that speaks about a place called Babylon. \nThey tried to create a one world rule. It is the first in that list of \nthose people who don't understand crime doesn't pay, in the long run.\nAnd ever since that place was destroyed, there has been a repeated \nbehaviour by some who try to take over the world and create a one world \nsystem.\nWe are going to try it again, but it looks like this will be the last one.\nDon't make any long term plans, unless they are eternal long term plans, \nand I fear that it is a must and urgent.\nGet your affairs in order, it's about to get bumpy.\nMy personal advice, get one of those free parachutes offered by that book. \nIt will make the landing softer, and will install eyes that see, and it \nwon't look so scary when it happens.\ufeff",
