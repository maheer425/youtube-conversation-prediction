The \nUK has experienced massive problems with its limiting of choices to \npatients in artificial hip replacement with thousands possible tens of \nthousands having to be reversed and replaced, causing pain and tumors after \npoisoning the blood with chromium and cobalt. You left out how giving a \nmonopoly contract and taking away health care choice from the patient \ncauses a lot of problems, sometimes fatal.\n\nHealth care isn't this monolithic good or service and to call the demand \n\"inelastic\" can be deceptive. It is only inelastic when it is life saving \nor critical.  People decide all the time in health care based on prices.  \nSometimes those prices are monetary, this pill costs X but I'm not hurting \nthat bad so I'll let it heal on its own.  But in other countries sometimes \nthat price is in time, ie, I have to wait 83 days for an MRI or 3 months \nfor a specialist or 7 hours for an appointment.   I can literally get in \nfor an MRI this afternoon in my hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky USA  \nwhereas the average wait time in Ottawa is nearly 3 months for a \nnon-emergency MRI.\n\nBut more importantly is a conversation about substitution.  Where I can get \nexpensive diabetes drugs in the US people in Greece substitute the less \ncostly (to the government) alternative of getting their foot amputated.  \nYes, we spend more but we also get better Quality of Life Years. Is it \nworth it?  Apparently so or people wouldn't be buying it.\ufeff",

You are right, much better to put decisions \nabout what products or procedures I may be reimbursed for to be put in the \nhands of a private corporation that would lose money by paying for them. \n Any government (which would actually benefit from having a healthy \npopulace financially) would be less likely to have my interests in mind? \n Please.  \"The government is so inefficient that It would become even more \nexpensive\"!  You think?  I doubt it, but would be willing to take the \nchance just the same.  Even if it did, if it meant that everyone had equal \nand adequate coverage, I would be OK with it.  Who says the government \ncan't \"lose\" money on healthcare (at least in the short run)?

Remember too that the VAST majority of drugs are developed \nlargely using government/public funding.  A lot of folks will say that drug \ncompanies need an ROI and lots of on hand cash to develop new \nbreakthroughs, which is partly true, and even more say that only America is \ndeveloping new therapies and such which is outright false.  If this story \nin the link below upsets you enough you have every right to write to \nBristol-Myers, your Congress, Senate, and House representatives (a few \nsentences expressing your displeasure is more than enough), and even the \nPresident's office.  They really do listen, and with enough voices asking \nfor a serious look at healthcare, they will be more than happy to oblige. \n Participation in YOUR and OUR government is needed to ensure we are all \ntreated fairly.\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/12/18/outrage-at-the-increasingly-high-cost-of-cancer-drugs/  \n ",

There's an age-old saying that goes \nlike this: \"He who pays the bills, makes the rules.\"  Americans don't want \nto give the government the power to set arbitrary limits on their \nhealthcare, such as saying that any cancer patient with a chance of \nsurvival of 5% or less can no longer get treatment (as is done, I'm told, \nin Britain).  We've just heard too many American-style stories of people \nwho either beat the odds, or were mistakenly assigned such low odds in the \nfirst place.\n\nAlso, there is a way in which healthcare is most certainly an industry.  \nI'm talking about the sense of the word \"industry\" that means \"hard work.\"  \nIt takes hard work to become a medical professional.  If you want to become \na doctor, here's how it works here in the USA:  You work hard for four \nyears, trying your absolute hardest to get your best grades while staying \ninvolved in extracurriculars, then go take an extremely difficult test \ncalled the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).  Maybe you even take a \nspecialized MCAT prep course.  Then, once you've gotten into med school (IF \nyou make it), your hard work is only beginning.  If you choose to become a \nspecialist, you may find that by the time you're finished with your \ntraining, you've cut off the first EIGHT TO TEN YEARS of your adult earning \ncareer when compared with your peers who went into other industries.  \nThey've graduated, got jobs, married, started families, and here you are \njust getting out of college and starting at the entry level in your \ncareer.  OF COURSE you want to get paid well, to make up for lost time and \nfor lots of hard work in medical school for which you were not paid at the \ntime.\n\nIf you want to become another type of medical professional, you won't spend \nas long in school, but you'll still have to take lots of classes that would \nbe considered \"hard\" by the average college student's standards, such as \nanatomy and physiology, organic chemistry, and the like.  People sacrifice \nquite a bit to become the highly-trained pros we have here in the USA, and \nthe Law of Supply says that the only way to have a good supply of people \nwho are willing to walk this road is to pay them well.\ufeff",
