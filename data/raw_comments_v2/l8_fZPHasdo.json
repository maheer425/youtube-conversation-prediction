But you are mistaken that a certain wavelength of light \nwill be \"green.\" I refer to Edwin Land's Retinex theory. Human color vision \nis not wavelength-dependent, as many clinical studies have shown. If it \nwere, then the colors of objects would change moment to moment as the \nillumination varied. Some patients with V4 lesions do in fact have \nremaining color vision that IS wavelength-dependent. And they show marked \nabnormalaties in color perception as expected.",

If I shine a red light on \nan object, I can get a different color.  A green laser emits 532nm \nwavelength electromagnetic radiation.  But, if I was talking about color, I \nmight say it has a green frequency even though we both know it's 532nm \nfrequency electromagnetic radiation.\nThe color we perceive is dependent upon the frequencies of light striking \nour cones and our brains perception of these signals.\n\nRemember the old saw..\"if a tree fell and no one was there to hear it, did \nit make a sound?\"  Perhaps a better question would be..\"is there color \nwithout a brain to perceive it?  In other words, color is not a fundamental \ncharacter of an object as it only exists when we look upon it.  Newton was \nright.",
