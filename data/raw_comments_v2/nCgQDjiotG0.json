Nice \nand simple, and allows people to switch phones at a reasonable rate. 3 \nyears seems very long. This is Apple's main product which ties the others \ntogether.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to buy the newest item, but that's no reason \nfor Apple to stop releasing them. I only started liking Apple this much \nwhen I realized how difficult it was to find a great Windows laptop.... I \nwant a portable computer and the PC laptops I've checked out all have \ncrappy keyboards and touchpads, especially compared to Apple's.\n\nI'm not sure what you're saying about developers, but I think Apple \nprobably wants to play to its strengths, and the kind of gaming done on PCs \nisn't one of them. I think PC gamers want to heavily tweak and accessorize \ntheir platforms for a very custom experience. Apple hasn't arranged their \nbusiness to work that way, and tempting gamers by offering the same games \nwould complicate things all around, perhaps pissing gamers off.\n\nYou can run Windows on a Mac.

Both employees and customers \nseem oblivious to computers :-/\n\nMy point is that Apple is trying to be the absolute best and is constantly \nworking toward being the best, playing to their strengths while constantly \nmoving outwards from those strengths. At least it's through trying to be \nthe best and connecting that quality to what people actually want, not some \nartificial dynamic like Microsoft had and has over the enterprise or \nupgrade cycles or networks or developers. An Apple laptop, I think, would \ngive a much more lasting satisfaction than any PC laptop, and that's \nbecause it's not frustrating to use. Microsoft hasn't clued into that.

I thought Google would attempt or was attempting the same \nwith its products, but I think now that Google has fallen back on old \ntechniques of using everyone as beta testers and only being a little better \nthan the competition.\n\nSo, instead of inciting excitement in interested parties like me, they're \nthe new Microsoft, content to release flawed or even purposely buggy \nsoftware for the sake of using everyone as beta testers. Currently, the \nOffline function on chromebooks can't be turned off or it doesn't stop \ntaking up local storage when disabled. This \"bug\" has been going on for at \nleast a few months and ~ oh my goodness ~ what a coincidence that it gets \npeople used to it *and* feeds Google lots of information on how it \nperforms, at least on chromebooks.\n\nI think Google is sleaze, but I do use their products. They're the Internet \nequivalent of the best PCs. Windows 8 and PCs basically suck compared to \nApple hardware and software, and PCs could, theoretically, be much better \nif anyone actually cared enough to put in the appropriate effort on \nhardware and software, but they're too busy trying to make money the way \nthey always have to do the job right or show some real initiative.\n\nHere's the difference, to me: the vast majority of what Google does is \nsoftware. And the vast majority of \"bugs\" they've shown that appear in the *user \ninterface* or are otherwise obvious to users are *completely unnecessary*. \nAnd if it weren't for how much forcing features ~ like an Offline folder ~ \non users benefited Google, it would be *easier* and *cheaper* for Google to \ntake the relatively *tiny* time and effort to fix them.\n\nI wish Google much ill. They've outlived their usefulness to me. If they \nwere to just drift away, the world would be better off because indie \ndevelopers would be more initiated and responsible... because there are so \nmany of them competing.\n\nAnd although Apple may not truly be perfect, it seems they've been pursuing \nsome kind of perfection in order to impress their customers, and that's the \nbest I see right now.\n\nApple should consider tweaking its browser to compete with Google's. If \nthey made it a priority, Apple could come close enough that I'd really \nabandon Chrome, too. And find a different e-mail service.\n\nI'll be wishing....",
