When one looks at average income as a percentage of \nGDP, they'll see that, here in 2013, we've turned \"oppressing the hireling \nin his wages\" into an art form! College costs no longer only ask your \nfirstborn child (figuratively speaking), they now want your entire progeny \nand most of your organs in payment. Then, once you get out of college, \nthere's a good chance you won't be able to find a job in your chosen \ncarrier path, or any job that pays more than minimum wage. The loans then \nhaunt you for the rest of your life, always threatening to take what little \nsubsistance you can eek out. This is the future may young people see ahead \nof them, so is it any wonder they don't venture out into a world where your \nrent will likely take over half your income? Then there's healthcare, which \nyou almost certainly won't be able to afford... Unless you want to work for \nthe big businesses and banks and become part of the system creating so many \nproblems. There are serious issues underneath this problem, issues that are \ncausing problems all over the globe. The issue is not just \"Oh, look at \nthose spoiled kids still living at home\". It is a MUCH more systemic \nproblem than that. Income inequality breeds greed, malice, crime, laziness, \nand whole brood of other problems. That's why we have D&C 49:20 (and I'm \nsure my familiarity with this verse has *nothing* to do with what is \nwritten 2 verses up... Me being vegetarian and all, I love the idea that \nwhoever forbids someone to abstain from meat - i.e. forbids someone to be a \nvegetarian since vegetarians, by definition, abstain from meat - is not \nordained of God). :) Anyway, even though I've studied some of the \nunderlying real world problems behind such trends, I still found the skit \nfunny. :)\ufeff",
