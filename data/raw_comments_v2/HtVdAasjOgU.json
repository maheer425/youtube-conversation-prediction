            "text": "+Ruben Fernandes Where is the immersion? Last time I went looking for it I \ngot lost in deepest pits of blend characters, badly written dialogues, \nfetch quests, boring combat and in general doing same things over and over \nin a world that feels so fake I couldn't understand why nothing has changed \nsince Oblivion. My biggest problem with Elder Scroll games is exactly how \nnot immersive they are. Immersion doesn't mean better graphics or sounds, \nthat's just a smaller part of it. Immersion can happen with much older \ngames, simply because the world you are in feels genuine and alive. \n\nIn Skyrim, you have to do everything, majority of your actions have little \nto no consequences, and majority of characters are completely forgettable \nand they don't register most of the things you're doing. Yes, there is a \nlot of concent and some of it is good, but the game itself is one of the \nmost overhyped ones I've ever seen. Only thanks to the mods I've been able \nto make this game feel more alive and immersive, especially with better \nNPCs that actually reacted to things I was doing, which blew my mind, \nbecause the vanilla NPCs will only shout generic nonsense at me all the \ntime and if something breaks my immersion, it's a robot that's doing \nsomething over and over despite me interacting with world he's part of.",

There are only a couple of choices where there's \nsome kind of consequences, like whether you destroy Dark Brotherhood or \njoin them, or the civil war questline. Some very important decisions have \nno consequence whatsoever, you kill Paarthurnax but nothing happens \nafterwards besides Greybeards telling you that you betrayed them. \n\nMemorable characters? Maybe, but just a handful of them, Cicero, \nPaarthurnax and Serana, that's really it. Can't remember anyone else. Most \nof them were really unmemorable and had no personality. While, for example \nin Witcher 2, one of the characters who was memorable to me is a fist \nfighting announcer. And that's only a trivial character, you can imagine \nhow memorable the main characters were to me...\n\n\nImmersive story and side quests? Story was clich\u00e9, mediocre and linear, a \nhero who will save the world from dragons blah, blah, blah... Side quests: \nthe miscellaneous quests were just a filler, retrieve that sword from this \ncrypt, deliver this ring to that guy, find the specific book, kill that \nguy... And there's about 5 of each of those quests in a game, it's lazy. \nFaction quests were mostly ok. The \"bigger\" side quests, which have the \nname, were imo the best quests of the game, I really liked some of them, \nlike the Forbidden Legend, Blood on Ice and Forsworn Conspiracy.\n\nOverall, Skyrim was a good game and an ok RPG, an RPG that doesn't have \nmost of its crucial components that I discussed about.

If you define \nan RPG as what it typically always has been defined as - a role-playing \ngame where you play a character and progress that character through a \nworld, it is definitely proper. It has leveling and a bunch of class \nprogression, it has a central plot that you affect through your actions, \nand it allows you to play many roles.\n\nSo, a role playing game.\n\nAlso, popularity most certainly does not denote quality - but then Skyrim \nis not low quality by any RPG standard I've ever seen. Even if it was, to \nargue something as not proper or defining due to it being low quality would \nbe similar to arguing that World of Warcraft does not define MMOs. It isn't \nimportant whether or not the core game is mediocre by genre standards \n(which themselves are poor for mmos), only whether or not people perceive \nit as good (IE, popularity).\n\nNow, if you want to argue Skyrim was over-rated, I can only agree, but to \nargue it wasn't a proper RPG or that it didn't define RPGs at the time it \nwas released (or even now still) is to be at odds with reality itself.\n\nIf any of you have particular reasons as to why I am wrong, I'm all ears \n(or eyes in this case), but honestly speaking two comments that respond to \nme but do not address any point I make won't get anyone far.",

About other witchers roiking2740 may be \nright but I wouldn't go above the number of 15 if we are considering game \ntime. So there are 3 main witcher schools according to Sapkowski's work. \nViper school is a game thing but we can assume there were 6 witchers living \nuntil the first attempt of killing Foltest (W1 ending misterious witcher is \nkilled by Geralt) then Auckes and Serrit died and at the end of the game \nLetho says that he knows of 2 remainning witchers from viper school. In \nwolf school after Geralt's death (end of books and beginning of games) as \nwe add content from game we know that there are 5 witchers from this school \n(Coen dies in books) - Geralt, Lambert, Eskel, Berengar and Vesemir. Leo \nhas not accomplished the trail of grass and is dead so we exclude him. \nBerengar is dead after the fight with Azar Javed (you may save him but I \ndon't think devs meant for him to survive). We don't have informations \nabout the griffin school as it is probably ruined but I guess it's safe to \nsay that there are maybe 3-4 witchers on path. Some may survived from \nwhatever happend to the school. We got to remember that witchers most of \nthe time wondered across many kingdoms looking for work and during the \nwinter they returned to their strongholds. About the cat school things may \ncomplicate a little bit because we can add new source - comics. But I would \nrather not complicate things. We can conclude from them that wolf and cat \nschool didn't like each other. Last book from Sapkowski confirms that as \nGeralt confronts Brehen - witcher from cat school. We can also say that \nthere may be about 5 witchers remaining from that school but they are not \nso noble as they brothers from other schools (as if all witchers were noble \n:P). Cat's witchers are considering murderers and spies. So my thought is \nthat in the game we will probably meet only 4 witchers - Letho, Eskel, \nVesemir and Lambert but hell this game is so huge and devs in CDProjekt Red \nare so full of new ideas and imagination that it might be possible that we \nwill meet new ones. As it goes for Witcher universum I think that the \nnumber of witchers could be between 10-20 but as we see and as we progress \nin games we can say that fewer and fewer witchers in this world and they \nare truly a dying breed.",
