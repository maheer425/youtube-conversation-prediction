So basically all the go-faster bits, but without the Black \nSeries aero that makes the car a bit too much boy-racer-ish. Especially \nthat mini GT3 fixed wing on the back. So again, the majority of the \nperformance Black Series bits (i.e. sans the aero bits, but with all the \nother upgrades) and the clean shape of a standard SLS AMG.
