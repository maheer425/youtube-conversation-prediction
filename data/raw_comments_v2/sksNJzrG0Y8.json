Moreover, if it weren't for its \nappearance in the drama, I would never know the existence of the song. \nTherefore, I don't think that Lee Seung Chul should be the one to blame.

            "text": "To all lee seung chul's fans you have the right to know why Xia Junsu's \nfans are angry because of LSC,  Lee Seung Chul received approval from the \noriginal composer, Jun Hae Sung, and original singer, Kim Junsu for \"I'm in \nlove\", which resolved the situation of this song. However, the resolution \nwas temporary. On June 4, Lee Seung Chul posted a comment on his fan caf\u00e9 \nwhich stirred up fans of JYJ again. He said, \u201cWith remakes, it\u2019s customary \nnot to mention the original singer. Moreover, making Junsu\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m in Love\u2019 \nnumber one and making it known to everyone is a much better way to go about \nthings, but asking a 50-year-old singer who\u2019s been in the business for 30 \nyears for a public apology without any sort of consideration or respect, \nit\u2019s a little upsetting.\u201d\nJYJ fans replied, \u201cThen you should earn your respect as a senior,\u201d and that \n\u201cThings have come this far because you disregard the opinions of the fans \nand think that whatever you say is right.\u201d\nOn June 16, Lee Seung Chul posted on his Twitter, \u201cIt was something I said \nwith a smile, but I don\u2019t understand what all the fuss is for. You\u2019re \nmaking it hard for me to ever see Junsu again. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d\nThis is a comment that I took from soompi.com from one of lsc's fans:\n\"They need to give credit where it's due. Releasing it as a 'new release' \nis a slap in the face, making it look like Junsu never sang this song. I \nlove Lee Seungchul as a singer, but he shouldn't get angry at Junsu's fans \nfor this. He should of had just apologized to the fans because the company \nhe is working for messed up. I understand he's a senior in the business, \nbut not giving credit to the original singer is not an example he should \nset. What if other singers asked to sing his old famous songs and released \nit as a 'new release'? Would he like that?\"\n\nSo as an international cassie I will say my opinion I will not truly know \nabout KPOP if not because of DBSK and will not falling in love with kpop if \nnot because of XIA JUNSU's great vocal that I hardly found around the world \non male singers, who is lee seung chul? i don't know him at 1st but because \nof this song I got to know him.\nIsn't LSC supposed to be thankful for Xia Junsu because people worldwide \nknow him because \"I'm in love\" is known internationally? \nYou think the answer by yourself.\ufeff",
