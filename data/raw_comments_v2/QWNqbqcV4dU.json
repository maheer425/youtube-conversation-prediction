Yes there were tv shows before the \"Rise\" of your \nbeloved MCU.\nBesides, what marvel has now are two shows about boring fucking agents. No \ndoubt daredevil is gonna be good. I love DD. But agents??? Really? AoS is \nstill on the air because it has the \"marvel\" on the title.\nAnd DC actually plan their shows on tv instead of just throwing miniseries \non netflix.\nI dont even care who is more popular.
