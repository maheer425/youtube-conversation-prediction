Do You see, what the problem is. If this will be, anyone \ncan say: x is a illegal number without saying, why, because then the secret \nwill be no secret more. Now everyone can say: x or y has not to be used for \nany purposes at all. It can't be, do You imagine why? Because then no one \ncan be sure that he use only legal numbers. And even with this example of \nthe number of \"Numberphile\" this will be so. But the next is: If You cannot \nuse the number then You cannot use the base itself. Also I cannot use the \nword \"numberphile\" itself. And then, if any othe say: \"bird\", or \"hunger\" \nis my word, You can't use the words ever. The same as the numbers. Then You \ncan't use any word sat all without being sure that they are all legal. The \ncomplete private possession of imaginations like numbers or words is - in \nmy mind - illegal itself. Despite of the fact that You can't punish all of \nthe people who use them, it's impossible. So there is not one number, who \nis real illegal.\ufeff",
