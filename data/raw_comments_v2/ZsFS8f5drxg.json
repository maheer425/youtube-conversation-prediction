According to a 2003 \nstudy by Steven Davis at Oregon State University, about six animals per \nacre, or 52-77% of the animals (such as birds, mice, and rabbits) that live \nin agricultural crop fields, are killed during harvest.\n\nEating meat is not cruel or unethical; it is a natural part of the cycle of \nlife. Vegetarians mistakenly elevate the value of animal life over plant \nlife. Research shows that plants respond electrochemically to threats and \nmay feel fear, so vegetarians are also causing harm every time they kill \nand eat a plant. Every organism on earth dies or is killed, at some point, \nso others organisms can live. There is nothing wrong with this cycle; it is \nhow nature works.\n\nWhat you put in your body is your business, but don't think you're better \nthan anyone else for not eating meat. Eating meat has been an essential \npart of human evolution for 2.3 million years.\ufeff",

And, as beef need great amount of soya, you need to import it from a \ncountry where the soya crops are a disaster for environment. (even if the \nsoya cultivated to make tofu or soya milk are often made in your country! \nBecause as you eat it directly, you don't need to produce great\namounts of it quickly)\n\nYes, I have done my homeworks.

I support \nmy local economy and eat healthy at the same time. Where does your food \ncome from as a vegetarian? Just guessing, but I bet you have no idea. When \nvegetables are out of season, where do you think they come from? I'm gonna \ngo out on a limb and say that they don't come from anywhere local to \nyou. This will be my final response to you as you don't deserve anymore of \nmy time. Do yourself a favor and research where your food comes from, and \nat what cost.",
