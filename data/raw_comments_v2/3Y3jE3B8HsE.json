This is a major question for \nthis kind of system because lets say the USA were to implement the system, \nwould you really think they would increase spending for education? They \nhave it already incredibly low and are cutting it down even more, this \nwould just encourage them to cut it down more in ways that favour them, and \nfor how much regulations, they would probably be dealing with a similar \nregulation problem as they have with regulating medicine and such, \nsomething that directly involves people's lives, since lobbying in favour \nof private schools would almost without question increase.\nThe best you could hope for a system like that to work would be in some \nplace where education is already highly funded (for example in Norway) but \nin those cases the proportional/stv system work fine due to an already \nhigher educated populace.\nThis can also be exploited if lets say education became more propagandist \nor politically biased.\nAlso, about saying them getting more voting power, then becomes the \nquestion just how much voting power is added?\nThen also what about an unemployed PHD guy, sure he got an education but \nshould he get more representation than a hard working but lowly educated \nworker who does back breaking work for minimum wage. See, it is easy to \nshow the problems of a meritocracy when you try to say something is a good \nmeasure of merit.\nAnd all that is not to mention the numerous different education courses you \ncan take, and whether they teach you how to better select leaders or not \nand how you determine that. For example should a doctorate degree \nindividual in engineering or something get more political say than someone \nwho got a masters degree in philosophy, economics, history, politics and \netc.\nAnd if you were to attempt to streamline the system you could possibly \nstagnate education and variety of teaching methods and subjects, and if you \nfavour a certain education course the you would have gluttonous amount in \nthat field because people want more representation in their government (we \ndo not need half the population being historians and philosophers, as an \nextreme example). Even saying that students wouldn't pass those courses \nbecause they would be disinterested in the subject both does not take into \naccount that it is possibly for them to cheat, and even if they couldn't \ncheat and would move onto something else it would still be a huge waste of \nresources, attention, time and effort, and may hurt the ones who are \nactually interested in the course in question.\nNot to mention discrimination from the school system in many countries (and \nI am not just talking about the USA, it is in bunch of countries), \nregardless of whether it is institutionalized discrimination or \ndiscrimination from powerful individuals (teachers, principals and etc.), \nwho can make things very unfavourable for those of other races or belief \nsystem or nationality or socio economic status or possible mental \nconditions or whatever.\nAs long as the educational system is \nflawed/broken/underdeveloped/corrupt/whatever the system you propose is \nweakened. Do not get me wrong, I would want some way to avoid bunch of \nidiots having huge control over the government, it is just the more a \nsystem has ways to discriminate against or for the more easily the system \nis to break. I personally like the idea of an enlightened \ndespotism/monarchy due to it being a system where an educated and \nintelligent individual controls the government, but I would never try to \nimplement it because I cannot insure that the despot/monarch is always \ngoing to be intelligent individual, especially since if we were to say \nothers would then pick the monarch we would have to ask how we can be sure \nthey are also intelligent and etc. and etc.",

Also, it wouldn't be such of a radical change, \nsince there are not so many people with high degree in education.. it would \njust bring some balance to system. Lets say there are 10% of people with \nacademic degree, there is probably around 70-80% those with high school, \nand the rest is uneducated or some low education.. system would just bring \nmore power to this 10%, but not total majority.. lets say just balance it.. \nbecause when you think about it.. and it might sound unfair, but why would \na dumb guy that watch reality shows and whole point of his life is to cheer \nfor his favorite football team have same influence on political power as \neducated human that know a lot more about most issues. How much educatioun \nshould be given for free? Well, just as in regular capitalist country.. \nthere should be some regulation brought into education itself.. to protect \nit from inflation, but isnt that what would be needed to be implemented \nanyway ?",

Your idea that it will push \nfor parties to educate their supporters fails to account that to get \neducation you could either go public or private, how do you measure the \nvalue of each other? Then on top of that, a party that has very rich man \nfocused policies will actually most likely cut down public education \nfunding to make it so fewer people can vote that aren't rich who can go to \nprivate schools. Not to mention that private schools will be much more \nexpensive then they already are since demand would go up regardless of \nwhether your country holds onto universal higher education or not due to \nthe value of education having risen.\nYour system also fails to account for geniuses who don't have formal \neducation, and if you just say \"Well they get an exception\" then you have \nto add a law onto that which gives strict and clear guidelines for those \nexceptions because you cannot just trust that people get their just rewards \nwhen the only thing that can enforce it is whoever has power and is not \nobligated to do anything for them, and if you do put in guidelines for \nexceptions, now you have to find good guidelines that aren't exploitable \nand do not on the same time overspecialize people or fall into the earlier \ntraps of rich people getting privileges\nThere are many more problems with the system but I do not have all day to \nexplain them, though do not get me wrong, I understand where you are coming \nfrom, it is just unfortunately too much filled with trap holes and possible \nexploitation of corruption to work properly.",

Have it so that it is based in a points system, where a 1st choice \nvote is worth 1 more than a 2nd, and so on. And if you like candidates \nequally, mark them equally and they all get the average amount of points. \nFor example, after choosing your 1st and 2nd votes, there are 4 candidates \nleft to rank, one of which you really hate. Mark the three you are \nindifferent to all as #3 (even though they will technically be filling the \n3,4, and 5 spots) and the candidate you hate as #6. The point system would \nlook like this:\n#1choice -> 5 points \n#2 -> 4\n#3 -> 3\n#4 -> 2\n#5 -> 1\n#6 -> 0\n\nHowever, since you ranked those three candidates equally as number 3 \n(taking up the 3,4 and 5 spots) they would each get the average # of points \n(3+2+1)/3 = 2 points for each of those while the candidate you hate gets 0.\n\nHighest point total among all candidates wins. \n\nSo you can still downgrade the candidate you hate without having to vote \nfor the other big party.

An example of this is UKIP (and \nyes, I know the irony of using FPTP parties to showcase the flaws in AV, \nbut anyway, let's continue).\n\nNow I don't agree with their views, but you do know exactly what they \n[UKIP] stand for, and you know what Farage's vision is for the country. \nHowever Conservatives and Labour don't have that. They don't have a \ndefinitive edge. If I vote either party in I have no idea what they'll do. \nThey just pander to anyone and everyone in the hope that they get more \nvotes. Labour targets young people, Tories target them as well. Tories \ntarget Businesses, Labour does the same.\n\nThey used to have distinct individual positions on different issues, and \nvoting for them meant something. But now they just try to outdo each other \nby using blanket policies that they think will appeal to huge swathes of \nthe population, but it actually just makes them look weak. By trying to \nappeal to everyone they end up appealing to nobody.\n\n[edit: sorry, I forgot the most important bit :P]\nAnother problem is that AV discourages parties from having strong views on \nthings, for fear of losing support of a certain group. Going back to UKIP, \neven they have started doing this. They previously announced that they \nwanted a cap on the number of immigrants allowed into the UK. Then they \nrecently said they wouldn't have it. Then they said they would again. \nParties U-turn all the time at the first sign that some of their potential \nvoters don't like what they're doing. The reality is that not everyone will \never like one single party. Not everyone will ever like one single person. \nParties should accept this and stop trying to pander to such a broad range \nof potential voters, because by doing so, they just become the same; \ncharacterless and dull; too afraid to advocate views some may not like.\n\nAnd this is just first past the post.

That means the \nmajority of the country would be flipping out and that is not good.\n\nWhat we need to do is separate the executive branch. Everyone agrees that \nPresidents have way too much power anyway and the other two branches of \ngovernment (Congress and The Supreme Court) have multiple members to make \ndecisions. It also doesn't make sense to have a President who can go to war \non a whim or get rid of our health care because he feels like leaving a \nlegacy.\n\nNo, we should have 3 Presidents. Yes, I just said that. We should have the \noption to vote for a leader of the Armed Forces, a leader of International \nDiplomacy and Finance and a leader of Domestic Affairs. These leaders would \nhave immediate decision making ability in their areas of expertise and \nwould defer to a three way vote on any issues that blur the lines of their \njob descriptions (like going to war which would effect all areas or \nchanging health care/adding illegals to health care). They would also have \nan equal say in veto powers and passing new bills. Or something like that. \nA Vice President(s) would also be elected or appointed by the people (maybe \nthe next in line as far as the voting went?) and would replace (if only \ntemporarily until a new election) any of the other three if something \nshould happen to one of them. This way no one party or  individual could \nhave absolute power.\n\nTo be honest, I am amazed that the founders did not think of something more \nlike this while writing the Constitution. It shows that even then, their \nthinking was still grounded in a one person at the top mindset.\n\nMine can't be the only solution to this problem, write your own and put it \nhere. Lets start talking about this stuff because all people deserve equal \ntreatment under the law and all people should feel like their votes mean \nsomething (more than war or a false sense of \"hope and change\").\ufeff",

Though the major parties have put two \ninteresting little rules in there and I more then a little suspect, that \nthey did this to further insure a leaning to either of the two major \nparties.\nFirstly we get two pieces of paper. You either use one or the other to vote.\nOne is a paper to vote for either of the main parties ...\nPut an X HERE, or an X THERE, then your finished, done!\nPainless... wasn't it...\nThen you can here the two major parties laughing at the stupid Australians, \nthat just gave them the majority.\nThe other paper is a long list of minor and independent parties, along with \nthe individual two major parties candidates. And draconian as it is, you \nmust fill in every box, or your vote does not count. If even one box is \nleft unnumbered or unreadable, then your vote does not count. There is \nmostly between 50 to 60 of these boxes, to number. So obviously most people \ndo unfortunately go for the quicker and easier option and fill out the \nmajor party paper and be done with it. Like picking the government that you \nwant to rule you for another 4 years is just not worth another 10 to 15 \nminutes, out of your busy lifestyle. Also the people are fooled into \nthinking that their vote for either of the minor candidatures, makes no \ndifference, because either of the two major parties will get into \ngovernment with a majority anyway. It does matter though, because enough \nminor and independent party candidates, do get into power and cause a \nheadache to the main parties and their plans for dominance. The balance of \npower is often held by independents and the major parties have to sometimes \nmake important concessions to get their bills through parliament.\nLike Bill form the \"Koala First Party\", that causes the government to cut \ndown a lot less eucalyptus trees to get their \"Road To Nowhere Bill\" \nthrough the Senate.\nActually it is the Senate that mostly has the most independents, that end \nup stopping bills going through, then in the House of Representatives.\nI am sure you understood the Aussie system better then I do anyway, but \nthese two differences try and push us further towards a two party majority. \nThough with a sprinkling of independents in the mix, it does make for a \nfairer system.\nThe United States really should have and Alternative voting system, as \nwell. It simply is a better and fairer voting system.\nLastly if you made it this far reading this comment. You Americans really \nneed to elect Ron Paul, the next time you get a chance. He is your only \nchance to save the US from falling, just like every other empire in \nhistory.\ufeff",

Further, in consideration of the C block being among the greatest \nindividual share of voters, even though their votes were redistributed away \nfrom their candidate in subsequent instant run-off results, their candidate \nstill won.  It's what I would consider democratically forced compromise n \nan otherwise split electorate.\n\nThis is just one possible outlines scenario, obviously, splitting might go \nvery differently, depending on the number of candidates and voter interest, \nand preference might not extend broadly enough to reach some tiers (say if \nsomeone only voted for one or two candidates in preference, instead of \nmore).  This could result in a less than 50% vote, should that happen in \nthe blended election, the results would immediately default to the original \nalternate voting scheme.   \n\nHow is this a good system?  For clear voting results, block voting will \nstill reflect the general trend of the country, while maintaining a \ndemocratic balance.  For close results, it forces a compromise system of \ngovernance (and far less partisan or divisive politics).   It's really a \nwin-win.\n\nThat being said, even the American two party system has a sort of political \nvalve that forces (although somewhat artificially) a balance towards the \nmiddle.  Primary systems unfortunately result in some very partisan \ncandidates, which can be very off putting for more centrally minded \nindividuals (especially closed primaries).  It is only towards the general \nelection that such candidates start to tack towards the middle, and away \nfrom their party platforms, trying to gain the middle ground. \n Unfortunately, this has the appearance of dishonesty and inconsistency, \noften leading to poorer candidates, whose main strengths may be how adroit \nand charismatic they may appear as they appeal more broadly to the \nelectorate.  \n\nAnyhow, these are my thoughts on the matter, and perhaps there are flaws \nwith my blended alternative voting method (please share). However, as far \nas the US goes, I think any system that helps to encourage participation \nand cooperation rather than feed divisive and partisan political viewpoints \nwould be an improvement.  There is far too much cynicism and vitriol \npolluting our political system, and I fear this only serves to weaken \nbroader democratic representation in our system of governance.\ufeff",
