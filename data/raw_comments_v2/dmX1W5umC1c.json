In principle it may be \npossible to accurately predict what will happen in the next 30 seconds for \nexample to a reasonable level for some things but the next 300 years will \nbe much less deterministic.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles all derive from the following two \nfundamental relations:\n\n\ndel E * del t >or= hbar/2\n\n\ndel x * del p >or= hbar/2\n\n\nWhere del is change in (uncertainty), E =energy, t= time, x = position, and \np = momentum\n\n\nAt anyone point you can know everything about energy precisely but know \nnothing about time or you can know momentum precisely but know nothing \nabout position. That is there could be 100% uncertainty in a variable. \nReally because \"particles\" are made out of wave packets there isn't \nanything more to \"know\" about the particle. I don't even like the word \nuncertainty because it's not that we don't know where the particle is its \nthat the particle itself is spread out. No one really disputes this. The \nkey unknown is how the wave-packet chooses to localize when something \ninteracts with it. How does it decide to localize in one spot over another \nwhen observed? Bell's inequality seems to show that it is random. \n\n\nMany everyday events like reflections off of glass have a high level of \nuncertainty. Will the photon tunnel through or won't it? That's a macro \nquantum effect. This randomness does add up overtime. For example quantum \nerrors add up quite fast in modern computers making it necessary for there \nto be data checks and redundancy. Modern solid-state physics and computer \nscience needs to be fully aware of quantum errors or programs wouldn't \nfunction. That is errors would accrue so fast computers wouldn't function. \nIf we can't even use and predict computer code without errors how the hell \ncan we predict the future? What about the random errors in DNA caused by \nsuch things as radiation? Little mutations lead to evolution (or cancer) \nwhich lead to huge amounts of change.",

            "text": "I want to agree with the Therm6000, who suggested that there must be an \nundiscovered basis about the randomness behind quantum uncertainty. I \nbelieve in an \"explainable\" universe. But on the other side, I'm also \nfamiliar with the idea of that every theory about the universe is correct \nuntil they fail to work so (this is rather a philosophical interpretation \nof the subject). Latter idea means basically that e.g. equations explaining \nthe free fall of an object work until the time the object rises instead of \nfalling under the effect of gravity (which seems to be highly impossible, \nbut no one can suggest that it will NEVER happen, since no one lived until \nthe eternity to prove it so).\n\nComparing these two, all you can say is, whatever we observe is true. This \nis the one and only axiom in science in my opinion (because if we start the \nidea of questioning whether our observations are true or not, things start \nto get very complicated). Other than that, every outcome resulting from the \nobservations (assumed to be true) are just predictions on the modelling of \nthe system behind the universe. With better observations we have better \nmodels, which eventually disproving the previous models.\n\nFor example, during the days, in which people believed the earth was flat, \nprobably it was never argued for some time (either 10 years or hundreds of \nyears). And everybody who heard about the theorem thought world is flat and \nnot in another shape, UNTIL some people came up with better observations \nand eventually disproved the idea (which was the reality for people). So by \nthat logic, no one can suggest that earth will ALWAYS have the shape of a \nplanet until the eternity (excluding the possibility of something \ndisastrous that can change its shape happening). That means, one day \nastronauts on ISS may wake up and see the earth is flat...\ufeff",
