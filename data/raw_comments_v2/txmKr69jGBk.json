This is working with aluminum which is actually one \nof the more neutral metals.  The important thing in both this experiment \nand the Hendo Board is that metal that is being repelled is a good \nconductor.  That's because the effect achieved is due to Lenz's Law (a \ncorrolary of Faraday's Law of Induction) that says when any current induces \na like current in another conductive object both the flow of current and \ntherefore the magnetic field will be in direct opposition of the inducing \ncurrent/field.  Point is, that could just as easily be a sheet of iron, \ncopper, gold, etc.  The only requirement is that the resistance is low \nenough that enough eddy current to form a strong enough field to repel the \ninducing field with enough force to lift it.  Which is what makes copper \nand aluminum the more likely choices, among the non precious metals they \nhave the lowest resistance.  There's a neat DIY demonstration of the forces \nat work here you can do at home with the right parts, find a dead hard disk \nand scavenge the actuator magnets from it, then get a piece of 1/2\" (or \nwhatever the smallest size the magnets will fit down is) diameter rigid \ncopper plumbing pipe, prefferably around a foot long.  Stand it on end and \ndrop the magnet down the tube.  It will take several  seconds to reach the \nbottom due to the effect of lenz's law creating a situation known as \"eddy \ncurrent braking\"  The falling magnet acts like a commutator in a generator \nand the pipe is the stator winding.  But instead of free running like an \nopen stator this is a shorted stator, much like the \"shorted winding\" \neffect of an AC induction motor commutator slug.",
