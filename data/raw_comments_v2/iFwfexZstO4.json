If you're traveling backward, Looking In The Mirror, if you want to \ngo to the place that's on the right, you turn the wheel to the right. \nExactly the same! When you understand that, and practice it, it's no big \ndeal. In both cases, you're turning the steering wheel toward the side of \nthe car that you want the car to go to. Instability is not an issue. (At \nlow speed. At higher speed, you get \"oversteer\", just like pushing a \nshopping cart backwards, but that's a separate issue.)Suppose you're not \nlooking in a mirror, but turning your head around. But then you're confused \nby your head and your body having different opinions of where \"right\" is. \nSo turn your whole body around, sit on the dashboard facing backward. (Have \na good friend work the pedals.) It's exactly the same as if you were \ndriving forward (except for the \"oversteer\" business if you're not going \nslow).\nOn the other hand, if you're trying to back up a trailer, it helps if your \nwheelbase is short, and the trailer's is long. Semi-drivers do that all the \ntime. But if the trailer's wheelbase is short, it's very challenging, as it \nwas when I was driving a tractor on a farm.\ufeff",

I have given demonstrations of driving \ndown country roads at 80 km/h in reverse. The instability you talk about is \nbecause of the \"tow in\" set on the front wheels. That is the left wheel is \nset to turn slightly to the right and the right wheel slightly to the left. \nThe result of this is the car has a tendency to naturally steer straight if \nyou let go of the steering wheel. However \"tow in\" going forward is \"tow \nout\" going backwards. So a car configured to be stable going forwards is \nhence configured to be unstable going the other way. Any car could be \nconfigured by a mechanic to be stable going backwards and not stable \ndriving forwards.\ufeff",

In other words, the elevators compete with the wings, \ninstead of adding to them.\n\nOn the other hand, canards (and bike and car front wheels) at a high angle \nof attack will normally stall before the wing (or the back tire). In a \nneutrally stable vehicle without a lot of angular inertia relative to the \nrotational drag, this is probably beneficial, but in other vehicles, it \nwill limit angle of attack.\ufeff",

Which is \nwhy your wheels automatically want to go strait when you drive forward. \nJust like the wheels on a shopping cart, except on a vehicle the wheels \ncan't turn all the way around. So, due to this caster adjustment, when \ndriving in reverse your vehicle will naturally want to go anywhere but \nstrait. Forklifts have little to no caster adjustment on their turning \nwheels allowing for easier forward and backward driving.\nI've only driven a forklift twice, but it was pretty much exactly the same \nas driving a car backwards while parking: the steering is harder in the \nsense that it is not stable (like balancing a pencil on your finger) but it \nallows you greater control over where the forklift goes when you are trying \nto make precise maneuvers. In both cases, it would suck to have to drive \nthat way at normal road speeds, but it is a great way of making maneuvers \nin tight spaces.",
