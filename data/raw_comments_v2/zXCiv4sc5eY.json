For in this video, as in many TEDx talks, a \nfundamental human emotion or characteristic is copiously explored. The \ncharacteristics under scrutiny here are patience and virtue. So when Conor \npresents the issue in the lack of these virtues, to provide analogy to the \nmarshmallow experiment, he gives us a single marshmallow, a glint of \nsuccess. He then proceeds to wallow about, seemingly aimlessly, and \"leaves \nthe room.\" Following this, all those who are assiduous enough to have \nwatched the full video received the second marshmallow in the form of the \nformula for success. I do believe that he committed to such an extremely \nplodding pace for that effect, only those willing to commit were worthy. \nFor under any other circumstances I do believe, based on his prolific \naffluence and intellectual merit, he could have candidly stated his \nexigence, candidly stated his findings, and candidly stated his conclusion.\ufeff",

If our focus is on \naccomplishments, we are not there for each other... and in my experience, \nclose, healthy relationships is what makes us happiest. If we are happy, we \nare better people, better citizens. Better citizens make for a better, more \npeaceful world. Humans seem so concerned with impressing others with their \nskills and achievements. But the truth is no one really cares about those \nmore than you do. My guess is that we do this to increase our social \nstatus, a natural impulse... But is striving for the best we can be really \nthe best way to live our lives and is it necessary?\ufeff",

For the record, my intro would have been: \"Conor Neill should \nconsider changing his name to Obi-Wan Conobi, because the man is a Jedi \nMaster of public speaking.\" That is, of course, until my editor would get \nhold of it and hurriedly red-pen the complement down to something less \ncolorful and/or skirting trademark infringement, something more \nlike...'outstanding speaker.'\n\nAll kidding aside, I've seen most or all of the TEDx talks on \nself-motivation (yes, including Tony Robbins) during a recent quest for \ninspiration, and this video is number one with a bullet in my book, both in \nsubstance and style. In addition to the presentation's overall excellence, \nMr. Neill also aced the most crucial element of such a talk (which, quite \ninexplicably, is often either given short shrift or even omitted entirely); \nnamely, providing the audience with the practical tools necessary for them \nto achieve long-term success in attaining each of the provided goals.\n\nAfter seeing this video, I checked out his YouTube video series/linked blog \non communication skills and personal achievement, which left me similarly \nimpressed; the videos are engaging and succinct (mostly 1-4 minutes, \nperfect for my ADD self), each providing excellent, practical tools and \nstrategies, and the blog posts provide additional quality advice and \nstrategies with similar brevity.\n\nMuchas gracias, Mr. Neill...here's hoping that we have you around to \ncontinue providing a positive impact and inspiration to others for many \nyears to come.\ufeff",
