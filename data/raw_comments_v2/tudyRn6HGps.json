He is a racist. It is easy to point the finger at white \nmales and leave it at that.\n\nWe all have to realize that of course there is racism. There always will \nbe. That is human nature. We all look at why we are better than \"them\". \nThey are fat, they are skinny, they like chocolate ice cream. And on and \non. Racism is color blind. Every race is guilty of it.\n\nSo go look at a totally non-white company/corporation/whatever and see if \nthere are racist emails there. You know you will find the same thing.\n\nMost of us middle class white males really don't care about all this. We \nwant stand up people who will pull their own weight. Skin color doesn't \nreally matter. Character matters.\n\nJon once again blows it by saying \"poverty is a choice\". He is obviously \nmeaning that it is not. Jon, for the most part it IS a choice. Fed by the \nfederal gov't. I have not seen anybody being barred from school or from \nwork sites forcing them into poverty. What we see is people being given \nhandouts to the point they refuse to work but think they are owed a nice \nliving by us who bust our butts everyday and pay taxes.\ufeff",

Iodinate react to the sun very well. \n :)  But i hear a lot about \"if you can say it I can say it\"  crap out \nthere and it has got to be the most racist and inconsiderate response that \nI can think of to an objection to that word being said by a white person. \n I just want to scream in their face \"well as soon as your culture has been \noppressed by another for CENTURIES in this country, you can pic a word that \nis only for you.  until then shut the fuck up\"\n\nSee white people have a problem in tis country.  We don't deal with guilt \nvery well and especially racial guilt.  And just like most people we try to \nminimize the guilt by \"equalizing \"tactics.  We will use the term racist \nagainst african americans as much as possible.  Because nothing minimizes \nguilt than you accuse the same behavior on your victims of from who you \nhave that guilt.  Just like when your kids come \"he hit me!\"  He hit me \nfirst!\"\n\nAnd like with this N word shit.  The more \"normal\" we can make that word, \nthe more numb we become to what it represents coming from the oppressors \nversos the oppressed.  \n\nMy only complaint is the number of times people say \"n-word\".  Every time \nits said guess what word pops in my head?  Yes you just made me use it in \nmy head and then I feel bad.  \n\nAll kidding aside, before you minimize the atrocity that has occurred and \nstill continues to occur in this country, don't automatically assume they \nfeel no pain from the past when you joke and do as they do.  Oppression has \npushed this culture into some unusual situations.  Situations that others \ncan have no hope to understand.  Before you go screaming \"Thug\", \"gangster\" \nand think that these people are doing it tho themselves remember what their \nculture and ancestors have gone through and what they are currently going \nthrough.  \n\nWould centuries of oppression cause you to be defensive and hostile to the \noppressors race?  Yeah\nWould centuries of oppression cause you to do things that are contrary to \nyour character?  Yeah\nWould centuries of oppression cause you to over-react when racial tension \nis high?  Yeah\n\n\nThere are many in this country that still think \"whats the big deal if we \nhave separate water fountains to drink from\" now we know what the big deal \nis.  ",
