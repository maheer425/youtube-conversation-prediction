This is actually VERY safe to \nassume, but if you didn't have any tools, harbor freight [or some similar \ncheap tool store] can get you in business with everything you need and only \nset you back thirty bucks, which means we've undercut your estimates by a \nwhopping $2,970 USD, also known as a crapton of money.)",
