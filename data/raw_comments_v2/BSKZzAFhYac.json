However, I live in Canada, where unfrosted Pop-Tarts aren't \navailable. \n\n2.  Pop-Tarts are packaged in pairs (within the box), and the wrappers \naren't re-sealable, so if you only want one, the other Pop-Tart in the \nwrapper goes stale.  This also discourages portion control, because \ntechnically, one Pop-Tart is a \"serving.\"\ufeff",
