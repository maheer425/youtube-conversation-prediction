Purgatory is not, as you said, Christian teaching in \nthe broad sense; it is Roman Catholic teaching. Purgatory was actually one \nof the major reasons for the 16th century reformation, and although I'm no \nexpert on Catholicism, the Roman Catholics I believe they are the only \nmajor denomination to accept the doctrine today. The reformers rejected the \ndoctrine as they felt it affected the ability for Christ to be a redeeming \nsacrifice once and for all, since they felt if even after Christ's death \nand resurrection human souls must still pass through purgatorial suffering \nit calls into question the efficacy of Christ's salvatory work.\ufeff",
