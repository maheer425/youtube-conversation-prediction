They were often Mimeograph machines (or \nstencil duplicator), which was a low-cost printing press that works by \nforcing ink through a stencil onto paper. because the mimeograph was \nlow-cost, it was widely used as the primary copy method for decades, \nespecially in public schools on tight budgets.\n\nwhen you held those freshly made copies in your hand, they would feel \nslightly \"damp\", due to the mimeograph fluid used by those copiers. and \nthere was a strangely attractive aroma of methanol in the mimeograph fluid. \nthat scent would typically remain present in newly made copies, for at \nleast several hours after being printed out, until the paper completely \ndried out, after all the mimeograph fluid had completely evaporated away.\n\nEVERYONE old enough to attend any schooling back in the 60's or 70's, \nremembers well, \"smelling\" their freshly copied paper sheets, that teachers \noften handed out during classes.  :)",

However, teachers like Mr Hand are what I grew up with , some as strict , \nothers strict just a little leaner but tough. What do we have today for \nteachers , nothing but Leftwing \" friends for mentors / teachers \" thus the \na reason why kids are worse than they ever were. Some of those older \nteachers were leftiwngers but many still demanded \" results \" , \" results \" \nis a dirty word , oppressive , mentally distressing si why requite \ncompetition and results anymore ! Thus Jeff Spicoli and his types are no \nlonger the \" few \" they are now the \" many \" , \" Fuck you teach , fuck you \nschool , duck you society !\nThe movie is a cult classic and I love it but at some point enough is \nenough , reality isn't a fucking joke its \" real \" ! Unless you want the \ngovernment taking care of you , go to school , even if you are average  \nlearn something and realize that there is more to learn in life , laziness \nand apathy are detrimental . Jeff Spicoli is the clown and the guy that \nmade us feel good and nothing wrong with that , but this is the way kids \nare right now !",
