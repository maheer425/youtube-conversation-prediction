An original \nHemi 6 pack equipped, 4 speed car I bought in 1972 as a one owner trade in. \nIt had the typical Mopar suspension problems of the era. Changing to all \nurethane bushings front and rear took care of those. Years later it went on \nthe rotisserie and had a ground up restoration, some frame work to stiffen \nit up and a full drive train reman., a few upgrades for a little more \npower, 656 HP up from the advertised stock HP of 425, which was actually \ncloser to 525. All of which can be reversed to stone stock easily.\nKomet163B; Non matching cars can be had for much less and be sure you check \nevery number even the hidden ones, many times they are trying to be past \noff as number matching cars. Dash and door plates can be changed, yes, it's \nillegal but you'd be surprised how often it's done. Same with the SS \nchevys. Most are not, but if you don't know what to look for you'll get \nstuck with a non match car or worse a put together clone, which is \nvirtually worthless. Matching numbers on cars like this is very important, \nwhether you think so or not. Same with vintage bikes like Harleys, Nortons, \nBSA's, etc. And gas is of absolutely no consequence to the point of \noriginality, nor do tires, belts bushing, wiper blades, brake pads and \nshoes, hoses etc., these are considered consumable parts, they will be \nreplaced as some point. The same as any other car ever made or will ever be \nmade. Just as the suspension and frame bushing on my car were upgraded does \nnot change the fact all serialized parts match and ARE original to the car.\ufeff",
