And to \nsay people have a choice these days?Well that right their is a total lie \nand it shows majority of people today are delusional and deceived because \nthe good has always been out numbered in this world because of mind control \nby people who force you to accept it and are surrounded by ignorant people \nwho does not know what respect actually means,which are pretty much \nGullible people who will laugh at all the wrong things and accept \neverything that is against what actually creates life, Because the popular \ncrowd does it, But they are calling people who believe in God and some of \nwhat the bible says stupid because you are trying to defend normal??But \nthey believe what is popular is considered normal? Oh yeah what about when \nHitler was popular and considered normal? Or how about the pagan parties \nwho allowed children to join in?? I mean seriously wtf ? You know like \nmonkey see monkey do? You got to be totally stupid if you don't see people \ngoing out and buying a i phones because everyone who is popular has one and \ndummies laughing at people who can't afford it or just don't want one,They \ncall them the losers? Are you going to call them the losers when they \ndidn't want to get that Iphone because it is almost close to a chip because \nthey can scan your phone for a purchase will soon be the people who will \neventually accept the rfid chip in your arm or head??? Are you going to \nalso than call them a loser too because they refused to take the mark??? \nHow about oh my neighborhood likes to sings about dancing on stripper poles \nbut even though it sounds wrong singing it with my children I will listen \nand learn the song to because it is in style? Even collect dolls that look \nlike voodoo dolls, that are dead dying teens, that look like prostitutes \nand you believe that shows a child morals by what they say and because it \nis popular ??? ? Oh please get over yourself when you think what you follow \nis right and people who believe in God is wrong,Look at what you allowing \nyour child to sing and think Simon says and people do monkey see monkey do \nand you call that a good thing? But than want to be hypocrites and call \nother people who are perverts that are only mimicking what you are singing \nand blasting and than you want to call other people sluts but don't see \nwhat you like to dance too? ...
