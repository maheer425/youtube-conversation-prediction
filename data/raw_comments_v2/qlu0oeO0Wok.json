And through all his \nadventures, he saw people in his mind with him--young, adventurous, \ndifferent--and he saw them living in the same world he was. And he wrote \nabout them, though different from who he is or the real characters in his \nlife. But he wrote them in the same frame of the world he knows. And maybe \nhe wrote them, because he can control them. He can control Margo Roth \nSpiegelman's adventures, and he can control Augustus Waters' non-smoking \nhabits, as well as the timing of his cancer. But he couldn't really control \nhis life or his adventures, because all he was was a man of imagination and \ncreativity and ideas. But he grew up with the people around him, like his \nbrother--no, especially his brother--who seemed to know how to control the \nrest of the world. His brother could take an idea for environmental \nadvocacies, and make a website. His brother could take an idea, and sketch \nit out on paper to be visible. His brother could make music, videos, \nshirts, designs, whatever. His brother could make conventions, and a music \nlabel, and everything else. While John is here, walking on his treadmill, \ntyping up words, because that's all he has. John is here, playing \nvideogames of a fictional football team. And the rest of the world gets to \nmake things real. When he made something outside of his books or his \nfictional team (let's say, when he and the Yeti made real kids, as an \nexample) John wishes he could control people. But he can't. He can't \nprogram the very interesting, different ways Henry has managed to see the \nworld, and he can only witness the way he can't control him. So this \nspecific moment where the one thing that doesn't seem to change despite him \nnot making some active way of controlling it--Hank's hair cut--finally \ndoes? That's it. He doesn't understand reality anymore, because his brother \ngot a hair cut.\n\nAlso, that hair cut looks really, really good on Hank. I haven't been \nwatching much, and I saw it just today, and wow. Hank looks really good.\n\nAlso maybe John is used to being the more likeable brother? More \ngood-looking between the two? Maybe he's just not used to Hank being \nuncomfortably near his level right now? ????\ufeff",

This is incredible story, the way that you (John) tied \neverything up from the beginning to the end, and the way that Q did \neverything he could to look for clues to find Margo, even the clues that \nweren't there was so beautiful. Then the way that you (John) talked about \nthe different ways one could look at death and the future the grass or the \nstrings really just touched me. Thank you (John) so much for creating this \nincredible journey for me. I don't care if anyone sees this but I just \nreally needed to say it. \ufeff",
