I understand that a large part of people's \ndislike for Shakespeare comes from their being forced to read it, and I can \ncertainly see how a teacher using outdated material is off-putting. That \nsucks. :/ I never hated Shakespeare, but I never understood why learning \nabout his works was so important...until I began studying theatre. Ha. \nGiven that he's a cornerstone of the theatre world/education...kinda \nhappens. But, I did not understand the language until I was IN a play. I \nplayed Hermia in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and one day the switch \nflipped on...and it was wonderful. I was so happy that I could suddenly \nunderstand everything that was written on the page and how to translate it, \nspeak it, perform it... I don't think teachers (at least that I've heard \nof) can really teach it outside of a theatrical context, unfortunately. \n\nI understand it's hard to overcome, but I still think you should try a bit \nharder...if for no other reason than to get a good grade in the class. Is \nyour main issue that you struggle to understand the language or is it \nsomething else? Have you used Sparknotes? I actually wrote *nearly* the \nsame essay this time last year for an assignment.\n\nMine was a bit more complex, though...it was a critical analysis of Hamlet \nand how it has influenced artists, musicians, poets, etc. through the ages. \nThe idea came about from Jim Morrison's poem \"Ode to LA while thinking of \nBrian Jones, deceased.\" It was interesting to write...definitely a \nchallenge but I felt pretty good about it. It does explore the theme of the \nOedipal complex as well. If you think it might help you, I'd be more than \nhappy to send it your way. :) \n\nI've only read a bit of HST, but my mother adores him, and I know enough \nabout his work to know he was brilliant. :) And everyone knows the \ndrugged-up/alcoholic/mentally ill fucked up artists are always the best \nones!! (Hence why I occasionally sit down and question how successful of an \nactor I can really be, since I've had a pretty good life...lol.) I don't \nbelieve I've ever read anything by Charles Bukowski, but the name is \nfamiliar. \n\nLastly, I don't know where you're from and if a lot of theatre happens \nthere, BUT if you ever get the chance to see the play \"Equivocation\" by \nBill Cain, please please PLEASE do so. One of the most incredible fucking \nplays I've ever seen. I would summarize it for you but I've already written \na freakin' book here, haha. But, it is about Shakespeare, to put it simply.\nAnd it's all in modern language. ;)\n\nALSO if you have time or are just bored one day, I highly recommend Julie \nTaymor's film of Shakespeare's tragedy  \"Titus Andronicus\" (this version \nonly titled \"Titus\") it was highly influential in changing my mind about \nShakespeare as well. The full film is on youtube, you just have to watch it \nin parts which is annoying but definitely worth it. :) Have a great night \nand best of luck on your essay! ",

I'd rather put \nforth efforts into reading Hunter S. Thompson, Charles Bukowski and other \nmore contemporary authors (of course, you could argue that Thompson was \nnothing more than a drug addled journalist and Bukowski was a sot, but to \nme they are a hell of a lot more intriguing than Shakespeare, not to \nmention more topical, relevant and, if I were teaching a literature class, \nI'd much rather have my students read the works of HST and Bukowski than \nShakespeare -- I reckon they'd find it more engrossing). Why am I here? \nThis year, I went back to college after being away for five years. The \nsemester is coming to a close and I need to write a proctored essay about \nHamlet and Oedipus Rex tomorrow. My extreme disinterest is so apparent. \nThis English class is online, and the instructor uses videos from the '60s \nand '70s and lecture videos of his own from 1997. It's... disingenuous and \nfails to engage the student. Now I'm getting off-topic. Whatever. I just \nwanted to rant! :)",
