But yes, i agree that a happy healthy marriage is the \npreferred type of marriage in terms of their children's health. \nunfortunately, that doesn't usually happen especially in a conservative \ncountry like korea because there's this strong cultural bias against people \nthat have divorced even if the divorce was better for the children. The \nreason why is because once a parent goes through a divorce, they can no \nlonger see their children nor associate themselves with them of the male's \nline of family (usually & discriminately the mother). idk which is worse. \nbut yes, i agree and understand that there isnt a perfect way. I was just \nstating how, particularly, korean society is with divorces.\n\n@coco pops im pretty sure i offended someone *cough* by saying some things \nthat they aren't familiar with... \"disgusting mindset\"... and im not sorry, \nits the internet.",

But saying that a \nlow divorce rate keeps families together (maybe in name yes, but in many \ncases not the way it matters) and doesn't ruin kids lives is a fallacy.\nYes in many cases it is true, but in equal or more cases still, it is very \nfalse. A happy, healthy couple is what makes healthy (mentally at least) \nkids and families.\nSo in those cases where the family is \"together\" merelly by societal \nimperatives, your phrase couldn't be more far from the truth. In fact, \nsometimes a non-traditional family where the couple is divorced may be \nbetter to the kids than seeing daily their sires fighting or ignoring each \nother.\nI'm just saying, let's not get hot headed and generalize, not to one side, \nnot to the other, what works and doesn't works is very particular to each \nperson and couple.

            "text": "+Coco Pops The stigma that comes with divorcing someone is natural. Much \nlike how theres stereotypes for a person. You can't get rid of it. Why? \nbecause stigma is something that is observed and individually judged to \nmake it generalized to be bad (in this case). I never said, kids will turn \nout to be bad if you divorce someone. Please read again. You cant be \nselfish and pretend your kids didnt happen, or neglect your parenthood \nduties to YOLO your own life. thats why most (if not all) parents from east \nasia (not sure about other countries) do not go through separation, \nregardless of what happens to them. Parenthood isnt something that is taken \nlikely. Once you have children, your life, your desires, your dreams are \nall gone. Being raped of course,... is a different matter that isn't \ninvolved in this argument. Once you have children through marriage, you \nlive for your kids. This is why the topic of marriage is an extremely \nimportant subject in asia moreso than the west and how people don't marry \nuntil their 30s compared to their worldly counterparts. There is even a \ncurrent problem atm because of this. Most younger generations (under 40) \nare not having kids because of the heavy responsibility and sacrifice that \ncomes attached to it, this is leading to a overpopulation of older \npeople:younger people. This mentality is not just mine. This is how most of \nasians from the mainland think. And if you don't accept this, then you're \nbetter off living in the west. Of course there are extreme cases of abuse, \nwhich part of the worlddoesnt have this trait? but should it define \nmarriage as a whole in asia? no. There are more abuse cases in asia than in \ntheir western counterpart because asia along with the middle-east are \nsocieties dominated by men. I'm not trying to be sexist or anything, but \nits a cultural thing that no one can change until the society gets more \ndiverse (which is highly unlikely).",

I \ndo know people who have mini arguments and then BOOM they are divorced. \nTHAT is stupid. It is happening more often. Other than that cheating is a \nmain cause.

Yes, but that happens even in Western countries. \nAmerican women still aren't paid the same amount as the men. There are \nstill statistics on this. As far as respect goes, that is arguable. I know \nthat in Korea, men are expected to act more conservatively. You rarely see \nmen catcalling women. That is considered low behavior. In some places in \nAmerica, that is considered normal. There are special parking spaces for \nwomen in some areas of Korea that make it more convenient for them. In \nAmerica, some people don't respect stay-at-home moms because they really \nthink they are unfeminist or lazy. Is that respect? I don't think so.\n\nStudies have shown that parents do best with a primary caregiver that is \nable to devote their time to raising them. Of course, a parent has to work. \nUsually, it is better for the man to do so because women are more natural \ncaregivers. If your mom was able to work, it was probably after you went to \nsleep or was sent to someone else or you were a child that could occupy \nyour own time for hours and hours. This may be possible for older kids, but \nnot very young children. A woman who works cannot provide as much time with \nthe child as a woman who is a devoted stay-at-home mom. That is a fact. \nUnless she does the work when the child is sleeping or at school, the child \nis going to miss out. Children deserve to have someone that is always going \nto be there.
