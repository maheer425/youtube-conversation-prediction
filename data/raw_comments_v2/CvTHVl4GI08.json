I am not a practicing Idol worshiping Hindu as of now but \nproud of my Religion and a proud HINDU none the less.. hope i could give u \nan answer.",

So, is this will be acceptable to God, when you \nignore or change his orders according to your desires? absolutely not!!! \n This is a test for mankind to determine whether they can find right in \nwrong or they persist with wrong, as to do the right thing isn't the simple \nthing to do now-a-days yet it is the simple to do.

So why should a God give only one group \nof people the right scripts and not only give an other none believes, but \nwrong ones?\nWhat is his intention then?\nDoes he want to confuse or mislead them, \nso that he has some people left for hell?\ufeff",
