The other problem is land mines throughout the whole \ncountry. But Lidar a new technology that archaeologists just did a few \nyears back changed the course of khmer history. They found A MASSIVE \nhydraulic city on top of a  mountain plateau  near the famous Angkor city. \nThis city has been recently mapped out which only covers 35 square \nkilometers and thats just the tip of the iceberg because the 8 kilometer \nhighway that runs through the civic center expands beyond the lidar imagery \nso this city is definitely much much bigger than this 35 square. Angkor is \nthe biggest city in the pre-industrial world. Angkor wat is the largest \ntemple complex int he world. People get confused between Angkor the city \nand Angkor Wat the temple. Angkor makes up of over 1000 temples which \nincludes Angkor Wat. The ancient city on top of the mountain is called \nMahendraparvata which was built by one king name Jayavarman II. This \nmountains city could be the biggest mountain city in all of human history \nas well. THERE ARE OTHER MASSIVE CITIES built by one king that are just as \nimpressive as Angkor and Mahendraparvata but those cities are yet to be \nstudied. The profile picture I have is King Jayavarman the 7TH who \ncommission the greatest building program in the history of the world. Thats \na fact.
