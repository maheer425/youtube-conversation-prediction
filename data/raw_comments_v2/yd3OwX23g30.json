Its aluminium block is 28kg lighter right where it matters: on the \nfront axle, and it also has more power, 193hp as stock. If you put an \nM50TUB25 single vanos air intake throttle body ecu afm so basically \neverything from an M50TUB25 engine onto the M52B28 and remap the M50's \nBosch 413 Ecu to give the more fuel needed for the extra 300cm3 you'll get \n230hp easily and the whole thing would cost less than 500GBP. You will be \nable to use the existing gearbox clutch flywheel, starter motor (only if \nthe flywheel is kept) propshaft, cooling system, (for using the oil cooling \nof the 325i you'll need an oil filter house from an S50engine but that \nstill isn't expensive) the rear part of the exhaust, etc. Btw you'll need \nan E34 M50 oil pan and and oil pump intake pipe.\nBenefits? More power, more low-end torque which is useful using a gearbox \nlike yours, less weight (on the front!), less ability to lose oil pressure \nwhen cornering hard or changing direction, easily remappable (let's say \nhome-remappable) Bosch 413 ecu...\nThat's the best way forward! Keep going! ;)\ufeff",

A MKII Syncro \n16V Golf would be awesome too and maybe more plentiful (I'm jealous) over \nthere.  A Celica All-Trac would be amazing.  There's one here in Oregon \nwhere I live and race (MKII Golf) and it's probably as close to a real \nGroup B car as I'm ever going to see on person, on track.  \n\n+qwkutiub That's likely an easy fix.  You just replace it with a locked \n50/50 unit (in fact it's just a set of cardanan/U-joints or a biased unit \nfor more rear application.  I've payed around with a lot of Diffs and LSD's \nand you can REALLY easily build a biased unit by just adding washers to the \nclutch springs on one side and none on the other to make the LSD \"tighter\" \non one side then the other.  Usually you wouldn't do this because you want \neven distribution side to side, but if it's oriented N/S then you just have \neither front or rear bias.  I know the R diff is likely not that easy to \nmod, and as I said above I don;t know how plentiful Golf R's are in the UK \nor how much he wants to spend to tear apart a desirable road car to beat on \nit as a rally car.  A MKII Golf 16V Syncro might be more plentiful and \nwould be an awesome chassis with MUCH cheaper and easier to do yourself \nmods.  ",
