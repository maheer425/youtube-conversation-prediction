I \nwasn't aware it was recommended to do it on slight inclines or to have the \nfront wheel turned towards/away from your lead foot. I just stood on \nhorizontal pedals (I find finer control/maneuverability esp at low speed \neasier if you're out of the seat), teasing them back and forth as necessary \nand if it was a long pause or I felt my balance go then a quick flick of \nthe handlebars (in either direction) would suffice. Staying in a gear one \nheavier than you'd normally stop with meant greater resistance and a more \npowerful pull away once it was green/flashing amber & clear.\ufeff",

In the video, the rider steers Left and pedals forward (Left) to \ncatch himself when his center of gravity is Left; he allows the bike to \nroll back and to the Right when his COG is to the Right",

A good rider can balance pretty \nwell on a flat at a red light even with a free-hub bike, but as you can see \nat the end of the video, the rider edged forward once or twice to keep his \nbalance before the light turned and he rode off.
