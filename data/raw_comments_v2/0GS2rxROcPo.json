If \nconsciousness itself IS the act of viewing or being mental states, then you \ncan always add one more, or change the whole set of states (implications \nfor personal identity). Why would we even try to quantify consciousness if \nit is defined by an infinite number or change? The system that \"contains\" \nconsciousness (in our case, the brain) can be simulated, but that doesn't \ntranslate into knowledge about what personal identity is (that \nself-referential voice which seems to be what we mean by the word \n\"consciousness\"). We already have a good intuitve grasp of what \nconsciousness is. We are conscious. The problem arises when we try to \nreduce consciousness to neural connections etc. in the brain. It's like \ndescribing a galaxy in terms of quantum mechanics -- or worse. \nConsciousness and mental states may not even be a \"thing\" in the world of \nempirical facts, and therein lies the irony: Even if we knew every physical \nfact about the brain down to the spin of the last elementary particle -- \nEVERY single fact, we will still only be able to understand what \"red\" and \n\"green\" means through first-hand observation and introspection.\ufeff",

What \npart do you think isn't?\n\nDo you disagree that DMT combines with certain receptors in the brain, \ngiving an altered state of consciousness and make you trip?  I would say \nthis is very well established.\n\nGive someone DMT, and they will trip for a predictable amount of time. Give \nthem water, they will not.\n\nMany people, upon sobering up from DMT, will claim they had \"Astral \nProjections\", Near Death experiences\", Psychedelic trips with significant \nmessages\"  Yada Yada Yada...\n\nThis shows us that these experiences are dependent on the DMT, at the very \nleast.\n\nFurthermore, we can get other chemicals which produce similar experiences, \nbut are different somewhat due to drugs producing different effects and \ndifferent trips...  we can then compare the two or more different \nsubstances and see brain activity.\n\nWhat we find is that brain activity in both are rather similar. Certain \nparts of the brain will experience significant decreased activity compared \nwith being sober, and others with significant increased activity. This \nshows that it seems that brain activity in certain regions produced from \nparticular chemicals produce these altered states of consciousness.\n\nWe can then use this information, to predict which parts of the brain are \nresponsible for the reactions people call \"astral projections\" etc...\n\nThrough other countless experiments and information collected unrelated to \ndrug trips, we have established what general function these parts of the \nbrain seem to have, and they seem to correlate strongly with the effects \nthey would produce if increased or decreased activity were to happen from \nsome chemical. In other words, the theory has predictive capabilities, \nwhich is essential in establishing its validity. Coincidence?  I think \nnot...\n\nThis is well established Neuroscience / Psychology, i'm sorry to say. And \nthe further we study this, the further we seem to understand this process \nand how drugs can trick people into having profound experiences which they \nmay claim is \"beyond this world\".\n\nThere is definitely more to learn, but this is the best explanations we \nhave and it is based on countless experiments and our modern understanding \nof the brain.\n\nSome random dude on the internet saying he thinks there actually is more to \nthis material life is just frivolous testimonial and doesn't compare with \nactual modern understanding of the brain through science.",

Upon questioning both \nmy college physics professors regarding Michio Kaku's representations and \nanalogies, they shook their heads and told me flat-out that what he's on \nabout all the time is this sugar-coated, overly simplified version of \nphysics.\n\nSo when Michio Kaku is openly declaring that time travel is possible, and \nmultiverses are a fundamental doctrine of string theory, and that \nwarp-holes could become reality in about a hundred years, or that he can \ntheoretically build you a lightsaber--please keep in mind that in order for \nyou to actually grasp what's going on here, you need about 8-9 years of \nphysic. Advanced physics (often with heavy calculus and \ntranscendental/linear algebra). If you don't have that, then please don't \nbe an anus and crap over everyone about how science trumps all or that it \nhas these magnificent properties or answers. Let's get real. 99% of the \ncow-brained atheists on this website couldn't tell their Gauss' Law from \ntheir Faraday Law, let alone Maxwell's equations. OR your religion. For \nPete's sake please shut the f*** up about your religion. If you really \nbelieved in it enough you wouldn't be quibbling about it on YouTube.\ufeff",

In the downside, the human brain doesn't seem \nto have as much storage space as a computer. So whenever it comes to \nacquiring stored information, we humans are forced to access information \nexternally rather than from inside our own brain.\n\nOn the goodside, our human brain has about the same memory as a computer \nwith 2.5 Petabytes (2.500000 GB) of RAM. So we don't need to store as much \ninformation either. It's stored in memory in bits and pieces and combined \nto produce the information we need.\n\nNeurons are also far better than transistors at communicating with \neachother. So when you're saying that a computer can run \"hundreds of \nprocesses\" simultaneously, I'm not particularly impressed.\n\nAlso process is not the same as a physical action done with a physical \nbody. It doesn't matter what you're programmed to do, if you don't have a \nbody that can obey that program.\n\nFurthermore, it's been stated several times that the work that the Mars \nRovers do in weeks on mars for instance, can be done in minutes or hours by \nhumans. The reason why we don't send humans (yet) is strictly because of \nmaintenance costs.

It is the one \ntrue guarantee that nearly every animal (save for a certain type of \njellyfish), no matter how well it is taken care of, will eventually die. \nTherefore, the removal thereof is immortality. It means transcending the \nlimits of age.\n\nHowever, as noted, the removal of the Hayflick limit results in the \nproduction of cancer cells. This is the primary reason why application of \ntelomerase in humans is not recommended. While it can reverse aging, like a \nfountain of youth of sorts, it would also almost inevitably cause the \nformation of cancer cells in the process.\n\nThe statement you quoted me saying is correct. There are cells that do not \nsuffer from aging-related deterioration, that is, they are not subject to \nthe Hayflick limit. They are cancer cells. And scientists have already \ndiscovered a way to engineer them within humans using telomerase. So, which \npart of my statement, exactly, was wrong?\n(Let alone \"silly\", as you tend to call Nobel-prize winning scientific \ndiscoveries)\n\nIt's nice that you're reading up on the Hayflick limit enough to post \nquotes.

For instance, relative to its size, \na mouse would have better land speed traversing through a maze, compared to \na human traveling a scaled-up version of the same maze. A human using \nwritten or verbal clues in human language would have a clear unfair \nadvantage over a mouse which doesn't use the same language (and, possibly, \nno language at all).

If we accept natural selection as \nthe means that determines reproduction, the act of finding a mate and \nreproducing is all about determining dominance as a more 'primitive' form \nof a hierarchy. Android, on the other hand, seems to be referring to an \nauthority structure of a hierarchy, which would be similar to government \n(and organized communities, maybe?). But if we do look at it from an \nanimalistic perspective, there's a social hierarchy throughout many species \nthat defines us as social animals, or needing others to help survive and \nthrive. This seems to bring up an interesting situation of whether we are \nsocial by nature or whether we became social as we became more intelligent. \nI don't know. Any thoughts?",
