If I am wright then increasing the length of the bar \nshould make it seem even lighter.\nNow here's a question for you: the energy stored in the giro effect( the \ndisc spining,)consumes?????,( the test would be to see if the disc spinns \nfor more time if beeing hold from a short bar then it would if from a long \nbar\ufeff",
