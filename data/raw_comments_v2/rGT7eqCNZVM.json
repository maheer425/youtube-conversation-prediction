A diesel, unlike gas, will continue to produce power running a \nvery rich fuel to air ratio. This excess fuel however will come out of the \npipe as soot and ruin your emissions. The soot, however doesn't go into the \nair but falls to the ground. Things like egr and def prevent any of these \nemissions even though they don't go into the air.\n\nPoint being: Upgrade boost (turbo), upgrade fuel (injectors), and get a \ntune to put it all together and you'll have your hp along with much more \ntorque.\n\nMy experience lies in american diesel truck motors (duramax, powerstroke, \ncummins) so while still applicable, these engines aren't an expertise of \nmine.",
