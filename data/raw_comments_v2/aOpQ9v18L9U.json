A weapon used to disperse \ndeadly radiation is in fact a WMD and radiation is invisible. What part of \nthis can you not comprehend? He was in the process of producing a weapon \nthat would emit deadly radiation in groups of Muslims. What part of this is \nfar-fetched? A high concentration of radiation is fatal. Creating a device \nthat disperses high amounts of radiation make them WMDs. Killing in the \nname of a political agenda is terrorism. Do you understand English?",
