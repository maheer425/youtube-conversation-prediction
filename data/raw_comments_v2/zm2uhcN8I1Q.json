At any other job, thry would be fired for \ntheir poor work. Yet, because of the protection of the teachers union, \nthese teachers continue leading their students down paths of bad study \nhabits and ignorance. \ufeff",

There are 4 (basic) choices witch are: \" Linguistic and \nartistic studies\" , \" Ecenomics\" , \"Physycs and biology\" and lastly \n\"Physics and technological studies\". All these choices have a diffrent \ncurriculum although all of them still have a base of classes thet must \ntake. Like Dutch, Englisch, one more language(frensh, erman or in some \nschools spanisch), and some form of social studies. Also a student can \nexpand these curiculums by doin any class off there choice that is not \nwhitin the set curiculum. This way the toolset is already diffirentiated at \na younger age and while it is intended to still go to collage after that at \nleast students can focus on the direction they want to go in a little \nsooner and don't have to cram stuff in to their heads thay have no interest \nin. This partly solves the only doing well on a test problem because \nstudents learn stuff that they want to know and are interested in. (sorry \nfor the bad spelling) ;)\ufeff",

Schools are mostly funded by property taxes, which is a rather \nbig problem for kids in low-income communities. More running, evaluating, \nand most especially funding of schools at higher levels of government tends \nto mean a more equal chance to get educated for everyone.\n2. College. When somebody goes into social movements 100 in order to get \ntheir gen-ed social science, it's helpful if they have a decent \nunderstanding of the Harlem Renaissance. Professors need to be able to \ncount on students doing a gen-ed requirement having certain universal \nskills.\n3. The toolkit. There are a few vital skills that every student should have \n(basic economics, sociology, political science, mathematics, \ncivics/government, physical and environmental science, logic, etc.), and it \nis vital that somebody make sure that students do, indeed, have them, and \ndon't get screwed over by where they live. \n\nThat said, I agree that the US system of standardized testing is screwed up \nin a variety of ways.",

Algebra especially. Algebra is something that you either understand \nor don't understand and the people that don't understand it get overwhelmed \nvery easily by it. I am one of those people. It's stressed me out to the \npoint of going into a panic attack on multiple occasions. It should not be \nmandatory for someone to continue to learn about something that isn't \nvaluable to them and stresses them out to that point. Science and history \nwere interesting as a child, but now they're just boring and annoying. I \ndon't need them for the jobs I'd like to go into, so they're useless to me. \nI think the school system should work as this: science, math/algebra and \nhistory should be mandatory until high school. In high school they should \nbecome optional classes so the people who are interested in them can \ncontinue them and the people that aren't don't have to be forced to \ncontinue to learn things they have no interest in. By high school \neverything has been introduced to you, even basic algebra, so you'll know \nif you want to continue learning about them or not. The required classes \nshould be things everyone needs like classes about how to preform basic \nfirst aid, sex ed classes that go into way more depth than they do, classes \nabout how to properly take care of a child since they always talk about \nusing a condom to prevent having kid but tell you nothing about how to go \nabout actually having one and taking care of it if you want one, a class \ndedicated just to laws and our human rights because yes they are taught in \nhistory, but it was brief and I barely remember any of it because I was \ntaught it at a very young age, classes about how money works, classes about \nif buying a house or apartment and if it's better to rent or buy and other \nthings. Stuff like that is what we should be required to learn. Not stuff \nthat isn't useful for everyone. And then they should still have other \noptional classes on the side for things that people actually want to do \nlike art, music, computer and acting classes. If the education system \nworked like that, people wouldn't be as stressed, overwhelmed and miserable \nbecause of school. Also I am sorry this is so long, wow, I am just really \npassionate about my views on how school should work, eheh... I am done \nnow. \ufeff",

One thing that people must \nrealize, is that the main purpose of the common core is to make schools \nteach. Before common core a school could say, hey I don't want to go \nthrough the work to hire a new science teacher, so were just not going to \nteach them science. While many see the common core as a bad thing in many \nways it holds schools accountable. My mother is a high school astronomy and \ngeology teacher so I've been able to see the difference common core has \nmade. Before it was put into action my mom had students coming into her \nclass thinking that the earth was the center of our solar system and that \nour core contained another world with dinosaurs. It's not that they weren't \nintelligent or that they had never been to school they had been going to \nschool since kindergarten like any other kid. Their elementary and jr. high \nsimply didn't want to teach it to them. Now, not all schools are this bad I \nrealize this, but there are places that are even worse. Common core isn't \nperfect but its certainly better than what we had. \ufeff",

I do think there are some problems \nwith uniformity in education in the U.S.\n\nAnother topic or topics that I think is also a weakness of the U.S. \neducational system is self-awareness and communication skills, things like \nassertiveness training, awareness of one's own thought process, and the \nrelationship between thoughts and emotions.  I also think learning about \nhow to express disagreement in respectful ways, could be helpful.  I think \nlearning about this sort of stuff could improve mental health (i.e. \nlearning skills like some of the things Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \nteaches) and also reduce group conflict.\n\nLastly, I think another big failure of the U.S. educational system is in \ngiving students freedom.  Students in the U.S. spend more hours in school \nthan students in Europe, and they often are programmed and scheduled \noutside of school.  As a result, I don't think they develop good time \nmanagement skills until college, and I think they also miss out on a lot of \nopportunities to take initiative and learn how to start and organize things \nthemselves.  These skills are critical for most jobs and careers, and \nespecially so for entrepreneurs, who are the driving force of the economy \nand key players in job creation, as well as in solving problems in society.\n\nSo I would love to see the educational system scale back the number of \nhours students spend in school, and scale back the amount of assigned work, \nand give students more structured time, more opportunities to do \nself-directed reading and exploration, etc.  I find it ironic that in most \nof my schools, in spite of being forced to be in school 7 hours a day, we \nwere not allowed into the school early, nor allowed to stay late.  So it's \nlike, we're not able to operate the way true scholars do, where you can go \ninto the library of your own initiative, or the science lab, or the \ncomputer lab, or a lounge, to discuss things with peers.  That's the sort \nof environment that I really want to see us start creating, and I think we \ncould even start at a very young age.\ufeff",

There a \ntons of for profit vocational colleges now because community college \ndoesn't offer vocational training anymore. That is just sooo ridiculous. \nThere already tons of people who are getting degrees who don't have jobs \nand perhaps we in this country OVER value education.\n\nHigher education is there so people can get jobs for there niche industry \nor subject. Not everyone is going to be a doctor, scientist, physiologist \nor social worker. :/ Jobs of the \"future\" might not all be high level jobs. \nWhat about the speciality mid-level jobs? I would argue that the job \ntraining for that is more essential.\n\nFor instance, the dialysis industry is going to grow because the prevalence \nof people with diabetes and high blood pressure in the country. So with \nthat in mind in my city the 4 years growth would be, 2-3 more nephrologists \nin the city but that equals to like 30 dialysis techs, 9 nurses and a \nsecretary. So basically it is 3 high level job for every 40 mid/\"low\" level \njob.  :/ The dialysis center I worked at HAD a classes for nurses and \ncertified dialysis techs in the Community College but was CUT because \"the \ncommunity college wasn't making money.\" Those people get hired after for a \njobs that pays $13-$15 (after +3 years experience... I think like $10 \nstarting) an hr + 1 1/2 after 8 hours and they work 12 hour shifts. They \nstill have classes but it is private now and the class is $6,000+ dollars. _; \nIt should have STAYED at the community college. <.<;\ufeff",

People will \nnot value the 2 years of college the same way they do not value the 12 \nyears of school people get because it is free.\n\nCommunity College is over crowded in my State. There is already a \nGovernor's waiver so people of a certain income get to go there free for 4 \nyears. The issue is that it is over crowded as heck. I hope somewhere in \nthat plan there is a plan to build more schools for all the people going to \ntake the 2 year courses because there is already going to be an influx. If \nthe budget is just to pay for the new people and does not go into \ninfrastructure, then there is an big problem!\n\nFor the hardworking people who plan to transfer to a 4 year college, I feel \nit is a good idea. 2 years of free school full of just G.E. is a total \nwaste for people with no intention to transfer. Associates degrees aren't \nvalued in terms of hiring, from what I hear. Maybe some G.E. and a year of \na specific vocation might be best for some people, whether they recognize \nit or not and that is the problem. Medical assistant, dental assistant and \nautomobiles is a respectable profession. Everyone doesn't have to be a \nsocial work or psychologist. <.<;\n\nA teacher I knew taught high school and while there are a few hard working \nstudents, some people are there because \"they have to be there\" and so they \njust use that time to hangout with friends. That holds the other students \nback. He felt like a baby sitter and had to divide the problem students \nfrom everyone else. One student just would spend the day pealing the top of \nthe table off the desk. I just hope the first two years of CC don't become \n13 and 14 grade. <.<;\n\nBut I generally like the idea and support education. ;D\ufeff",
