Consequently, whoever was \nelected in 2008 would probably be a one-term president, and would damage \nhis or her party, too. \n\nSo the GOP decided they didn't WANT to win the election.  They didn't want \nthe hate.\n\nIf they lost, they could wait until 2012, they'd win for sure then, the \nhard nasty stuff would have been done, and they could coast for the next 16 \nyears, at least, with no manure on their feet.  (It's called long-term \nstrategy.)\n\n\"So, who should we run?\"\n\"Why not John.  He's been trying for 16 years, and this might be his last \nshot, so how 'bout we let him have one full campaign?\"\n\"Well, ok, but he's popular.  War hero and all that.  What if he \naccidentally wins?\"\n\"Well, we can't allow that.  We'll have to torpedo his campaign somehow.\"\n\"How do we do that?\"\n\"We get him a special running mate.  A scary one.  A woman would be good - \nmake it look like we care about women, too.  There's this woman in \nAlaska.....\"\n\nKaboom!\n\nThey were much more serious about the 2012 campaign.  But so much for \nlong-term strategy.  They didn't know how to stop the torpedoes.\ufeff",

In the case of \nPalin's Africa blunder, there is some possibility that she thought South \nAfrica was referring to Southern Africa.

Of course, she MOST LIKELY said those things because she's \njust plain stupid, but there is at least some small possibility that she \njust misspoke or misinterpreted others (which would STILL make it her \nfault, but it wouldn't be quite as embarrassing).\nBachmann thinks that Muslim Brotherhood attacked the US during 9/11 and \nthat torturing people in Guantanamo led to the capture and killing of bin \nLaden. She accused a member of Hilary Clinton's staff of being associated \nwith the Muslim Brotherhood (even McCain was outraged by that).\ufeff",
