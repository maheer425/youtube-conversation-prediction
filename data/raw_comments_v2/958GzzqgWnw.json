He was breaking the laws he was supposed to uphold, and \nthat made him fair game, in Tony's view.\n\nTo draw a parallel, in the days of Al Capone's Chicago, a newsman named \nJake Lingle was murdered by some mobsters.  The public was outraged - \nkilling a newsman was something you just didn't do.   As the story leaked \nout bit by bit, though, it turned out Lingle was killed not because he was \nreporting on mobster activity, but because he was deeply involved in the \nrackets themselves.  Among other things, he fed Capone info on police \nraids, he spied on Moran's gang on the northside, and he was a big-time \ngambler.  He was dirty, and at some point, made the wrong people mad and \npaid the price for being dirty, just like any other criminal.",
