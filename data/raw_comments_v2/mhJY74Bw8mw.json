So, \nfor example, 4^-1 = 4/(4*4), which one set of fours cancels out, leaving \nyou with 1/4.\n\nWith zero, however, you get 0^-1=0/(0*0), which is undefined. It could also \nbe represented as 0^(1-2), which is the same as 0/(0*0). If you multiply \nthe zeroes together, then you get 0/0, which can be whatever you want, \ndepending on the angle you approach the origin of the graph with (and with \nwhat function, the slope of that line, etc.). It can be 1, it can be \ninfinity, it can be blue, it can even be the amazing wau.\n\nIf, however, you use this property first and cancel out the zeroes (and I'm \nbreaking math right now just by dividing zero by zero, but bear with me), \nyou can use the same property that I mentioned above to get any number you \nwish. 0^-1=1/0?
