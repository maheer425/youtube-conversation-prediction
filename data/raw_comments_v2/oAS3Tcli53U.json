            "text": "+Grisel Griselda I know this question isn't directed at me but I am moving \nout of the city in a few weeks and I am so happy about it!!! For me, I \ncan't deal with the smell and the dirtiness and the daily chaos. Smelling \nhuman feces everyday and sitting next to mentally ill people on the trains \nand having rats run over my feet is an interesting experience but not the \nkind of longterm lifestyle for me. I like people and I like to do a lot of \nthings but constantly being bombarded with people has just wore me out. \nPlus, I want to be around beautiful sceneries with gorgeous and calm \nlandscapes now.  All the concrete and buildings were cool at first but now \nI'm seriously needing some beautiful trees and lakes and mountains around \nme and Central Park is not enough. I'm very extroverted but I am also \nintrospective and I like to take time to myself to think, meditate, and \nclear my head. I find it to be bloody hell difficult to do that here in \nNYC. My apartment is too small and too expensive. The new apartment that I \nfound out West is twice as big with a view of the water and the mountains \nand its half the price. And Im doing the same work I do out here but \ngetting paid more money and the weather will be better. That being said, I \nhad a great time here, it was fun while it lasted, but for me...NYC is like \na summer fling, its exciting and passionate but we both know it isn't long \nterm commitment material.
