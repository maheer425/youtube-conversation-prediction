I generally struggle with charity videos because I \nknow that there are problems in the world and I know that I should put more \neffort into trying to help just a little bit in the smallest of ways that \ncombined with other people's small efforts make a big difference, yet when \nI see these types of videos (or commercials, or whatever) all it really \ndoes is make me feel really bad, and want to think about something else and \nnot get involved, for the simple reason that it makes me feel uncomfortable \nand guilty. And maybe that's an extremely selfish way of responding to \ncries for help, and maybe I'm being a disgusting privileged brat, and maybe \nI should feel ashamed of myself, because it's a really nasty way of not \ncontributing even though you can. But I think that the reason I, and many \nothers, respond like this, it is *because* we feel like disgusting \nprivileged brats, and because we *are* ashamed of ourselves, and shame as a \ngeneral emotion is extremely uninspiring. It's destructive, not creative, \nand it doesn't make you want to do the right thing, it just makes you focus \non the fact that you're *not* doing the right thing, and hence draw further \nnegative conclusions about yourself (or about the world or other people, if \nyou feel like pushing the emotion away and blaming it on someone else), and \nnone of these things make you feel empowered and happy to help others. It \nalso does not make you feel like you, specifically, are the one person who \nshould be helping, because it makes you feel like you're worthless at \nhelping, and thus the logical conclusion is for you to leave the helping to \nother people, people who are good at it and who aren't disgusting \nprivileged brats. \nWhat I'm trying to say here is:\n1) This video really didn't make me feel that way. And that inspired me.\n2) The fact that this video didn't make me feel guilty made me make the \nabove realizations, which was very nice and relieving. Next time I see \nsomething that would normally make me feel guilty, I'm going to remember \nthis and handle it much better. (because knowledge is empowering, hell to \nthe yeahs!)\n3) I might actually not be a disgusting privileged brat (although this \npoint is up for debate :P )\n4) Of course, I might be wrong in my conclusions, or at the very least, \nthey may not be true about anyone else's feelings of guilt and shame but my \nown.\n5) Thank you for a very nice video.
