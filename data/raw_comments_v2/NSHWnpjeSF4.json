Shame on you greedy Japanese who \nonce invaded our country (oh yes, and never even apologize) and now trying \nto declare that Dokdo belongs to Japan? Excuse me but historically IT IS \nPROVEN that it WAS and IS Korea's land. And you know, just claiming that \nDokdo is Japanese land in public doesn't mean it will come to you. I \npersonally have many Japanese friends and I do like Japanese culture, but \npeople like you just make me sick. Stop degrading your country and be \nmature. Shame on you.",
