The ONLY \"evidence\" I've ever seen people try to use as evidence of \nsexism is the tired old lie that \"women make 77 cents for every dollar a \nman makes\" - and this has been exposed as deliberate sophistry, and \ndebunked.  \n\nWomen DO NOT make 77 cents for every dollar men make for doing THE SAME \nJOB, which is what is falsely claimed in an effort to skew gender debates. \nIt's only true that women make 77 cents on the dollar IF you don't account \nfor education, positions, occupations, job tenure, and hours worked per \nweek. \n\n\nThe real \"wage gape\" is explained by common choices made by the genders, \nlike which college major they choose. NOT by \"mass sexism\" or any sort of \n\"gender inequality\"\n\n\nTop 10 Highest Paying Majors:\nPetroleum Engineering: 87% malePharmaceutical Sciences and Administration: \n48% male\nMath and Computer Science: 67% male\nAerospace Engineering: 88% male\nChemical Engineering: 72% male\nElectrical Engineering: 89% male\nNaval Architecture and Marine Engineering: 97% male\nMechanical Engineering: 90% male\nMetallurgical Engineering: 83% male\nMining and Mineral Engineering: 90% male\n\n\nLowest 10 paying majors:\n\nCounseling Psychology: 74% femaleEarly Childhood Education: 97% female\nTheology and Religious Vocations: 35% female\nHuman Services and Community Organization: 81% female\nSocial Work: 88% female\nDrama and Theater arts: 60% female\nStudio Arts: 66% female\nCommunication Disorders Sciences and Services: 94% female\nVisual and performing Arts: 77%\nHealth and Medical Preparatory Programs: 55% female\n\n\nClearly, women and men are free to choose whatever majors they want.   No \ncollege on the face of the earth would discriminate against female \napplicants.  If anything, being a female would increase your chances of \ngetting into the top 10 paying majors, since colleges are extremely \nliberal/pro diversity and are desperate to get more women into the hard \nsciences.  There just simply isn't this \"mass sexism\" that you talk about. \n I guarantee that anything you think is mass sexism can be explained \ntotally rationally by other factors.   Yet it's so easy to blurt out the \nmisleading bumper sticker type slogans like \"women earn 77 cents on the \ndollar\" and whip up a frenzy of naive supporters, because most people, \nquite simply, aren't smart enough to actually analyze situations with any \ndepth, and grasp the complexities of the world.  Easy, simple to swallow \nbumper sticker type statements are perfect for mass export to \nunsophisticated people.  It's how bad ideas (like this false idea of gender \ninequality with regards to salary) even get spread in the first place.",
