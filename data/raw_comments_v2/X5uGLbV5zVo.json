And it's probably because it's so \ninefficient. For example, if I only have clay pots but want fish. But the \nperson who has the fish, he wants bread. Then I have to find someone who \nhas bread ...\n\nBut agree that our current debt system is not so good. However, while it \nmay not be completely bad. For example, Japan has a massive public debt of \nover 200% of GDP. But the majority is indigenous and in their own currency. \nSo the state can create new money to pay off the debt and also collect \nmoney through taxes.\n\nPersonally I do not think local currencies like the Brixton pound is the \nright way. Not that it would not work, but it would be far too complicated \nto eg collect taxes, exchange currencies for multinational companies and \ntourists ...\n\nI think Debt Jubilee is an interesting idea. In biblical Israel where debts \nforgiven every 50 years or so. Not that it would be a complete solution. \nThen it also applies to not spend more than you have and have bad debt.\ufeff",

I can \nanswer that: The interest is paid with part of the total amount of money \nthat gets \"printed for real or digitally\" by the national bank, equivalent \nto the additional value created by whatever it is that the team/people \nasked a loan for.  I assume they had a great idea and proposed to the \nbank/venture capitalists etc;  \"Hey, borrow / invest money in us so we can \nbuy that machine so we can make this wonderful thing that saves everybody \ntime and that's why people will buy the products we can make with it\".  The \nidea even convinced the bank and the venture capitalists to get on board - \nboth who balance the risk with their knowledge and reserve funds.  And if \nit works out, customers will indeed go to their banks, get money from their \nbank accounts, and exchange it for the products made with the help of the \nmachine.  If at the bank of these customers, the reserve for cash money \nfall under a threshold, the bank manager will file a document to the \nnational bank to ask to print more money. The next day, you read in the \nnewspaper: the economy has grown by so many millions of \u20ac/$/\u00a5.  Let me know \nif you can poke a hole in my understanding of the financial system.",

So on the one hand he IS getting \neverybody on the right track! On the other hand, these \"revelations\" about \nthe nature of money also tend to misrepresent its role in our capitalist \neconomy. That's very unfortunate, because the opportunity to follow this \nthrough and see the big picture is a good one:\n\nFor example, you cannot really say that it's precisely \"interest\" which \nforces the economy to grow exponentially. That's because you cannot \nseparate the monetary system with its specific value-form (->interest) from \na complete analysis of capitalism. The \"root of the evil\" is already \ncontained in the way we humans perceive the general nature of commodities: \nProfit, rent, interest... all represent the same thing in a different \ndisguise! \nSo interest isn't some kind of evil scheme that Jewish bankers have \ninvented to screw us (a common line of thought known as \"structural \nantisemitism\"), but just one of the many ways in which surplus value makes \nits appearance.\n\nAnother way to illustrate this would be to point out that there's no way \nfor capital to reproduce itself in a global economy without some form of \ncredit (which by the way is the deeper reason behind the eternal cycles of \ndebt accumulation, crisis and monetary reform). \n\nConclusion: If you are against profit seeking(->exploitation) then you \nshould question capitalism as a whole. 19th century workers who witnessed \nthe transition to industrialized wage labor understood this perfectly on an \nintuitive level. It was the great ideological achievement of 20th century \nconsumer society to brainwash this nasty little insight from our collective \nmind. \n\nI invite you to put down your preconceptions and go read the first chapter \nof Marx's \"Kapital\".

So long as there's \ninterest, people are going to have to do more work to pay back the interest \nthan the things they wanted to buy with the loan. This is unavoidable. \nWhether a bank creates that money our of thin air or not is not a problem \neither, what's a problem is when they've let out so many loans that they \ndon't have even a fraction of the assets to back up those loans, and a \nrecession hits.\n\nThe real problem lies in people thinking it is fine for a bank to put a \nloan on their balance sheet as both an asset AND a liability, rather than \nhaving separate categories of assets and liabilities where the two \ncategories cannot be simply \"cancelled out\" against each other. A loan \nmight be considered a long term asset, but the moment someone defaults on \nthe loan, that long term asset goes to zero and the short term liability \nstays. What happens when an institution like this is leveraged 20 to 1 and \na recession hits in which 5% of the loans go into default? That bank's \nvalue drops to zero, that's what.\n\nHowever, if you simply put in a regulation that limits banking leverage, \nthey'll just find other clever accounting tricks to get around it and keep \ndoing what they're doing. There is simply no alternative to being vigilant \nand examining what's going on. If you as a saver refuse to deal with a bank \nwhich does anything other than protect savings and make loans to people of \ngood credit, and reject any which take on more than 2 to 1 leverage, that \nwould be a step in the right direction.\n\nIf you really want to figure out where all the money is going, multiply the \naverage hourly wage in your country by the size of the workforce and \ncompare it against the size of the annual budget of your government. You \nwill see that a large portion of your money is being consumed by \ngovernments, and what do you get for it? Lousy services and a bunch of debt \nin your name. THAT is where most of it is going.\ufeff",
