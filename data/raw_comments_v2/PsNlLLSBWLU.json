I did exactly what \nshe told me to do and now I'm brushing every day, no problems.  I watched \nthis video because I thought I had to brush the backs of the teeth too.  So \nglad I don't have to.  Okay, this is what my vet told me to do:\n1.  Once a day, get a small treat ready along with a blob of dog toothpaste \non your finger.\n2. Say to your dog, \"brush teeth\" in a happy voice and as you say it gently \nput the toothpaste on the dog's lips and very quickly give the treat.  It's \nimportant to do it at the same time (the catch phrase and the action).\nDo the above for two weeks until it becomes learnt that it's fun to hear \n\"brush teeth\" and to get the treat with the blob of toothpaste.\nTwo weeks later:\n1.  Take a piece of  kitchen swab cloth - those very thin cloths you may \nuse to wash the dishes with.  So cut a square of the swab cloth and put the \nblob of tooth paste on it, after you've covered your finger with the cloth. \n You're going to use your cloth covered finger as a toothbrush.\n2.  Do the exact same thing as above, but this time when you say, \"brush \nteeth\" and give the treat, you also start gently rubbing the teeth with \nyour cloth covered finger.  Do this for 2 or 3 weeks.\nLast step:\n1.  Do all of the same actions as above, except now you're using a real dog \ntoothbrush.  I can't believe it worked on my dog.  She wags her tail when \nit's time to brush her teeth and her teeth looks so much better.  Also have \navoided a huge vet bill to have her teeth cleaned while under anaesthetic. ",
