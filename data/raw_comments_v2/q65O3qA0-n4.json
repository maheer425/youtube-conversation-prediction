Apart from the conceptual baggage, the actual differences \nare negligible, the magnitude of the inaccuracy in WG84 is much bigger.\n\nFurthermore, even with the factors for how much the moon would pull in what \ndirection, the way tides work is actually different because the water can \nonly flow around land and at a certain rate, it wobbles and sloshes and \nwhat not, it's just not easily predictable. Instead we talk about these \ndata rich, observable changes in sea level with respect to our definition \nof altitude, and not the other way around, so that things stay simpler at \nthe levels of abstraction that we find convenient for experiencing the \nuniverse.\n\nThat doesn't mean people are ignoring the tides, they just have to if they \nwant to talk about them in terms of some fixed point, and the concept of \naltitude provides fixed points to relate to, and that they don't want to \ntalk about the tides and the moon phase every time they describe an \nelevation on a point of land.",

A \nrandom string of 1's and 0's would only be this flip-floppy about 2% of the \ntime (including more extreme results of flip-floppiness or streakiness). \n We humans tend to prefer flip-flops when looking for randomness because we \nsee long strings of the same value as non-random.
