If you say \"why no, ma'am, I find you quite \nfuckable regardless of your age,\" you are a troglodyte who thinks about \nwomen only in terms of their vagi-pussies. If you say, \"well, everyone \nbecomes unfuckable at some point, especially we men 50 and over with no \nhair or money,\" you are ignorant of the special angst afflicting female \nactreses, who are after all the most discriminated against women on earth, \nmore so even than genitally mutilated Somali teens. (Yes, I know, here is \nwhere you roll your eyes and say \"you just don't get it.\")\n\nVery funny skit though. Great delivery. Tina's facial reactions are \nbrilliant as ever. She really is the empress of the reaction shot. Women \ntruly are far funnier than men. And the macaroons are a nice touch. \n\nMust return to my poker game featuring 55 year old married dudes who do \nnothing but discuss their daughters' best friends' coozes. And I have two \ndaughters! \n\n\ufeff",

            "text": "This is probably one of the most insightful comedy sketches that I have \nseen in a long time. However this comedy sketch does not focus on one dirty \nsecret, which women don't want to fess up to That secret is that women are \nin large part responsible for perpetrating this double standard with \nrespect to age and gender. It is popular  among feminists to describe this \nas solely a  problem with a male run Hollywood and patriarchal media \nfostering this double standard, but out in real middle class America, many \nwomen tend to naturally aim for men older than them, especially because \nmany older men are wealthier than younger men and are far more emotionally \nmature and stable. The result is a natural expectation by both men and \nwomen, that if one gender is still desirable when they are older, it will \nbe men and not women. Secondly, men, when they take care of themselves, do \ntend to age better than women. This is an unfortunate fact of nature that \nonly the most delusional will deny. The higher testosterone levels that men \nhave, which give them skin that is more resilient and gives them muscle \nmass, while declining in their 40s and 50s, does not decline anywhere near \nto the degree that a woman's estrogen level declines - the very hormone \nwomen need to look youthful. Finally, it does make sense, from an \nevolutionary perspective, why men are considered to be far more desirable \nas they get older than women do at the same age. Men retain their fertility \nlonger. Most healthy men in their 60s, 70s, and even 80s can impregnate a \nwoman. A woman's fertility rate, after 37 years of age, drops \nprecipitously, and very few can have children after the age of 45 without \ncostly medical intervention. Hence, from a standpoint of species survival, \nit make sense that the gender with greatest longevity in terms of fertility \nwould also be the one that retains their desirability the longest.\ufeff",

Women are more flexible \nbecause they look for different things in a man (mainly resource gathering \nability to support their offspring) \nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/features/christian-rudder-dataclysm-okcupid/ \n and \nhttp://www.science20.com/news_articles/evolutionary_psychology_why_women_like_older_men_and_men_like_younger_women-145652",

It's a real shame that the point of contention shifted to the \neach of their personal sexual attraction instead of the message propagated \nthroughout the video. I guess, I've never found humor about gender issues \nreally to be funny; perhaps that's because they usually seem to come off \nmore as serious points of discussion instead of actually humor.\ufeff",
