You explained it as airparticles bumping into the wing, \nwhich is true to an extent, but because of the AoA the speed of the airflow \non the long side of the wing is increased thus creating an underpressure \n(and the resulting force is lift)\nSo in one sentence; the angle of attack influences the speed and pressure \nof the airflow over the wing relative to the speed and pressure under the \nwing.\nHowever, there is a limit to how far you can do this (maximum angle of \nattack)\nAbove AoAmax the airflow over the top gets distorted and \"leaves\" the wing \nin a turbulent flow instead of streaming to near the back of the wing, thus \nlosing most of the lift and that is what we call a stall.

(yes they're still just \ntheories, not absolute certainties yet)\n\nthe first theory is bernoulli's principle. the upper wing accelerates air \nfaster than the bottom wing, faster velocity=lower pressure, pressure \ndifference causes \"lift\"\n\nthe second theory, which i think is more true, is newton's third law. for \never action there is an equal opposite reaction.\n\nair molecules come into contact with top surface of wing, adheres to the \nsurface, follows the camber (curve) of the wing and is accelerated \ndownwards. the downward acceleration imposes a force equal and opposite, \nthus pushing the wing up which we call lift.\n\nthis theory can be tested by a multitude of ways\n\nsit in a shopping cart with bricks. throw bricks in one direction and u \n(and the shopping cart) will begin to move in the opposite direction\n\nalso\n\ngrab a spoon, turn on ur tap. holding the spoon at this rear tip vertically \nso that it's parallel with the water flow. now slowly bring in the back \nside of the spoon (convex side) so that it enters the water stream. most \nppl will think that the water stream will \"push\" the spoon away, but when \nin actuality the spoon will be \"sucked\" into the stream, similar to the way \nairplane wing's work\ufeff",

            "text": "+Soufiane Kharroubi   Well...  You're somewhat, sorta'  right.  You can't \n\"suck\" in air - that is only a oversimplified explanation, though by the \ncommon usage of 'suck' it actually is correct.   ...From the pedantic \nsociety:When you lower the pressure in one region, the higher pressure in \nsurrounding regions pushes air into the lower pressure region.   You must \nhave a pressure difference.  A vacuum cleaner uses atmospheric pressure to \npush air and dirt into the vacuum hose by virtue of the greatly reduced \npressure inside the machine. ...It turns out, much to the confusion of \nmany, that this part of Bernoulli''s Equation is nothing more than Newton's \nlaws.... it takes a force to accelerate a mass and that applys to fluids as \nwell.  The force is pressure and the mass is a mass of air just like any \nother mass....When there is more presure below the wing and less above, \nthis is a net force upward.  There is an increase in pressure below an \nairfoil, but it is a smaller contribution, as you say, to the difference \nthan the reduced pressure above it.  The fact that the lowered pressure \nabove the wing is a major contributor to lift is one of the nonintuitive \naspects of lift that confounds many amateur.  ...The other is this long \npropagated myth that faster air *creates* reduced pressure and it has \nbecome known as \"Bernoulli's Principle\".  Some like to say that \n\"Bernoulli's Principle makes lift\" without explaining what that means, what \ntheir understanding of the \"principle\" actually is, or how it comes comes \nto result in lift....Then as a flame shield for me......This pressure \ndifference (caused by several things going on around the wing) also causes \na downard acceleration of air behind the wing, called downwash, which is \nthe result of the necessary \"equal and opposite\" reaction force on the \nair.  I point to four major things happening around the wing and the \ndownwash as being the major phenomena of lift.-- Cheers, \nScienceAdviserStaveSecond vice charman of the N.E.

Turn on the tap then take a spoon hold it \nfrom the handle with two fingers (as if it is hanging). Now place it on the \nwater stream with the back in first. You will see the spoon moving in to \nthe stream of water!!!\nWHAT? But the stream of water certainly has higher pressure than the static \nair on the other side of the spoon!!!\nThe thing that makes aeroplanes fly (apart of money :) ) is the \naction-reaction. When the airstream at the top of the wing follows the \ncurvature, it is pushed down. The mass of air pushed down has the opposite \neffect to the wing (pushing it up) due to the above mentioned phenomenon. \nNow, why did I mention stall? Well, if that air at the top just stops \nfollowing the wing's top curve, then the wing is in stall state. That means \nthat it produces negative lift (pushing down) rather than the positive lift \nthat neutralises gravity. \nWhen does the airflow not follow the curvature of the wing? well, long \nstory short, when the wing exceeds a specific angle-of-attack then it goes \nin to stall state. That can happen in high speeds (crazy right?)\ufeff",

            "text": "+Alex Rantos   No.  The static pressure in the stream of water must be \nprecisely the same as the ambient air around it.  In order for the water to \nhave the curved path around the convex shape of the spoon, there must be a \nforce making it curve in that radial acceleration.  This is just like the \nradial acceleratin of an orbiting satellite that is caused by the force of \ngravity that accelerates the satellite radially inward, only changing its \ndirection and not (tangential) speed....A higher pressure on the outside of \nthe curve compared to the inside of the curved path.  In essence, radial \nacceleration....And are you sure that viscocity and wetting have nothing to \ndo with the water-spoon demo?  In other words, what about the boundary \nlayer of the water...And just what is that \"above mentioned phenomenon\" ??  \nWhat law of standard physics it is?...Then, if it is simply because the \n\"airstream at the top of the wing follows the curvature, it is pushed \ndown\", then why, pray-tell, does such a large volume of air, from far above \nthe wing, get shoved down so rapidly (abt 10 m/s for a real heavy) in the \nfollowing video  ...?See the GREEN video on one of these sites.
