I'm not here to make fun of anybody or laugh at anybody. \nI am just fascinated about the cosmology and philosophy and doctrines the \nfounders of the L.D.S. Church believed in. I did my own research. It seems \nJoseph Smith,his brother Hiram and Brigham Young were polygamists and a \npolytheists. Newer L.D.S. presidents / prophets / apostles since 1890 have \nchanged almost all of those 3 men's original beliefs on L.D.S. records. \nThis was in order to bring the L.D.S. Church in line more with Orthodox \nChristianity and to allow it to evolve / change with the times as a Church \n(just say the Roman Catholic Church does; it's the same thing with that \nchurch , too and many other religious organizations). Remember those 3 men \noriginally taught the following principles. \"The Adam God Doctrine\",that \nGod The Father / Elohim is a man in a physical (or humanoid) form in outer \nspace or a spirit realm and lives on the planet Kolob there (and has white \nhair a beard and blue eyes and is 6 foot 2 muscular Aryan Caucasian),their \noriginal principle that each planetary body in the universe has their own \nGod The Father (so many Gods and Goddesses), that a council of male gods \ngot together before earth's creation and voted Elohim as the ruler of \nplanet earth,that Satan and Jesus were brothers,that Satan suggested that \npeople on earth be forced to obey Elohim and have no free will, that Jesus \nsuggested that people on the earth that was to be created have free will, \nthat Lucifer / Satan rebelled against Jesus,Elohim and the Council of Gods \nand this caused Lucifer's downfall,that Elohim and his forces shut down \nLucifer's rebellion,that those Gods in the pre-existence that didn't take a \nside were cursed with black skin for their indifference and their spirits \nformed the souls of earth's African race and they were \"cursed\" because of \nthis so no black / African person was supposed to be Mormon of get any \npriesthood & that all good Mormons on earth will be rewarded after death \nwith their own planet or planets and solar systems and will be God-like \nspirit rulers like Elohim. Like I said. I'm not here to make fun of anybody \nor laugh at anybody. I HAVE MY OWN WEIRD BELIEFS ABOUT ALIEN CONSPIRACY \nTHEORIES,CRYPTOZOOLOGY CONSPIRACY THEORIES, HIP HOP CONSPIRACY \nTHEORIES,FREE MASON CONSPIRACY THEORIES, ECONOMIC CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND \nOTHER CONSPIRACY THEORIES. Mormonism is a good thing. Mormons seem like \nhappy, business-oriented,compassionate and productive community members. \nCan anyone ,whether they are non-Mormon, ex-Mormon or Mormon answer my \nquestions about the beliefs (I have mentioned in this paragraph) of Joseph \nSmith,Hiram Smith and Brigham Young on these matters ? Please be objective \nand only use facts.\ufeff",

People who become secular are considered \n\"inactive\" in the church and are not given access to Mormon temples.\n\nThere are many secular Christians.  One can see the problems in the news \nconcerning actions by the large percentage of Christian Fundamentalists. \n\nMost Mormons know the basics of their religion, and do not do any intense \nstudy of Mormon scripture nor history.   With the Internet, these things \nare searchable, and non-Mormons create web content that highlight conflicts \nbetween current Mormon status quo and past teachings/history.  People will \nstumble onto these things in their search results.  Future Web tools will \nprovide an even more cohesive search result, which will make these things \neven more visible.\n\nThis will undoubtedly affect the Church.   Church growth has remained at \nthe same levels for a decade, and the Church has been self-searching the \ncause.   I think it has only been recently that the Church has realized \nthat the stagnant growth, even when the number of missionaries has been \ngreatly increased, is due to people having been informed about imbalances \nin Mormon teachings, history and policy before the missionaries knock on \ntheir door.\n\nThese imbalances have not been formally addressed by the Church.  The \ndefault policy has been to let these things fade away by not repeating \nthem.  The Church may need to be more overt in their response to these \nissues.   What makes this difficult is that the Church needs to present \ntheir current status in such a way that it does not make previous Church \nLeaders look bad.   It is a serious offense in  the Mormon church to \ncriticise Church leaders, especially in a public forum.\n\nFor example, the implementation of Joseph Smith's polygamy is very \ntroublesome.  The only way to approach it sanely is secularly, to state \nwhat the records show and be honest about the embarrassing parts.   \nPolygamy in and of itself is concerning.  The records show that Joseph \nSmith was practicing polygamy while publically denying it, which is even \nworse.   When the newspaper called \"The Nauvoo Expositor\", funded and owned \nby disenfranchised mormons, printed it's first issue, which was about \nJoseph's Polygamy, Joseph Smith, as the commander of the Nauvoo Legion, the \ncity's local militia, told them to destroy the printing press.   This was \nthe reason Joseph Smith was detained in Carthage Jail, where he was then \nassassinated.   He denied people their first amendment rights.   Explaining \nthis away is very difficult.  Some members at this time considered Joseph \nto be a \"fallen prophet\".\n\nCurrently, when missionaries are asked about polygamy, they respond that \nthis is about another Church (implying the Fundamentalist LDS Church whom \nstill practice polygamy).  IN a sense, that statement is correct.   The \ncurrent LDS Church bares little resemblance to the Church in Joseph's day. \n  Reconciling this is difficult.\ufeff",

You do know that I was a Mormon right? I know their 13 articles \nof faith, I've read the book of Mormon several times, researched, pondered, \nand prayed several times to no avail. I'm not really interested in \nlistening to you tell me to go read an pray. It seems just like a lazy \nman's way to preach. If you've got something to tell me, tell it to me, \nbecause apparently I was doing the research ponder and pray part wrong.\n+Richard Holmes I've run into two or three anti-Mormon Christians, and I've \ngot to say, they are pretty annoying, and I think I know what you're \nreferring too. There is quite a bit of misinformation on Mormons in general \n(like the people who think they worship Joseph smith), and I'd guess a lot \nof it comes from ex-Mormon Christians trying to impress their Christian \nfriends with storytelling.\nConcerning the evidence you provided:\nI don't have any way to verify that your \"certain feeling\" was in fact not \na human emotion, or natural chemical reaction in the brain, and I don't \nthink you do either. Since you believe there to be supernatural forces, it \nseems highly likely that you could easily mislabel a human feeling as \ndivine.\nEverything picking back up where you left it doesn't seem like that big of \na miracle (unless time literally rewinded XD, but I don't think that's what \nyou're talking about). The event also doesn't seem to be related or infer \nLDS doctrine. There's nothing about it that specifically says or hints that \nit was a god's doing. If any human perceived coincidence qualifies under \ngood evidence, then that's a lot of opportunities for good evidence of a \nvariety of superstitions.\n\"Just this one example of what I'm talking about proves that that \nexperience back in 97 was of the divine!\" I don't see what quality about \nthis event proves that it's divine in origin. Many people of different \nfaiths have similar, and more impressive stories about their religion, so \nif you're experience qualifies for proof of your religion, why doesn't \ntheirs?\n\nLet's go back to an earlier reply you gave me. My question was:\"What \nreasons do you have to believe that your religion is correct as opposed to \nthe many others out there who believe theirs is correct\" Your reply was \nthis: \"As I said earlier!  It's not that there are not truths in other \nchurches!..it's that the Mormons do have the fullness!\"\nYou did not answer the question here, you either purposefully, or \naccidentally dodged the question by saying something almost every religious \nperson would agree on. Other religious people would gladly agree that other \nchurches are correct to some degree. The question I asked was what reasons \nyou have to believe that this particular Christian denomination is correct \nas opposed to the thousands of others you haven't even had a chance to be \nexposed to?\nJust statistically speaking, the odds seem incredibly low that you would be \nborn into/Happened upon (Don't know if you're a convert or not) the correct \nchurch. It also seems very premature to assume that you've found the one \nfull truth, when we know that billions of people claim the exact same, or \nsimilar thing and that a person's religious affiliation is mostly dependent \non their geographical location. E.g. If you were born into a Muslim family \nin a Muslim majority country, It'd be extremely likely that you'd be a \nMuslim right now claiming the same thing about full truth you are right now.\nTo believe a claim as large as that, knowing that billions of people are \nclaiming a similar stance on several different premises, with their own \npersonal stories of faith. I don't know, I just feel like you should have a \nwhole lot more evidence than \"Things picking up where they left off\" before \nyou believe a claim as large as that.",

That is it was almost as if NOT even \nas much as a moment of time passed from when I was a teenager to going \nback!  But rather IT ALL picked up FROM where IT ALL LEFT OFF!  One who I \ndebated on this said something to the effect of ''but a memory of a past \nevent can bring things back to your memory banks!''  Ya but not like this! \n Two in the church spoke of having a similar experience after returning to \nchurch after many years of experience!  I just don't lose sight of it! \n Just this one example of what I'm talking about proves that that \nexperience back in 97 was of the divine!  I don't know if it's G-D, \nJehovah, or what it is!

NOBODY else was WRITING \nscripture in the 19th century.  The reason 17th Century English was the \nscriptural vernacular is because the Bible was TRANSLATED in the 17th \nCentury.  Now, why would somebody living in the 19th Century \"translate\" \nhis book into vernacular that nobody had actively spoken in several \ngenerations?  The answer is MARKETING.  People are more likely to \"buy\" \nscriptural claims if they stylistically match already existing \nscripture...which is itself devoid of empirical support, by the way.\n\nAs for Native Americans' being, \"born of Egyptian gentile (woman),\" I'll \ngrant that the Human Genome Project and others like it have concluded that \nALL modern humans are descended and evolved from Central/North African \nancestors.  However, unless you can provide evidence, such as links to \npeer-reviewed Historical and/or Scientific research, then your claim of \nEgyptian gentile ancestry is false, as are your claims of Jewish DNA among \nNative American populations...and for the same reason.\n\nIn any discussion or debate, the one who claims, \"This IS,\" or, \"This \nexists,\" is the one who carries the burden of proof.  You want me to \nbelieve?  Fine.  Furnish evidence that corroborates the Book of Mormon OR \nthe Bible.  The only condition is that, as the rules of logic dictate, \nscripture cannot be self-affirming.  Corroboration must come from \nNON-scriptural sources.  I'll be genuinely happy to check out any relevant \nlinks you'd care to post.\n\nAs for the alleged Book of Abraham, when countless people who have \ndedicated their lives to the study of a particular subject say the \nconclusions of somebody with NO formal study of the subject matter are \nutterly erroneous, I'm inclined to believe the experts.  Either \nthose experts are all wrong, OR Joseph Smith was a gifted fantasy author.  \nI believe option #2, and if we were talking about anybody BUT Joseph Smith \nYOU would, too.  However, as discussed above, if you'd care to present \nevidence...other than that which Agrippa The Mighty has already \nrebutted...then I'd love to be as educated as possible about the subject.\n\nJust remember that the rules of logic prohibit acceptance of, \"The book is \ntrue because it says so in the book.\"",

            "text": "Due to pressure from outsiders, the Mormon Church put out an official memo \nabout Joseph Smith's 34 wives.   I did not hear about this memo from the \nChurch.   I did see a blurb about it on a news channel.  So I checked it \nout and went to the URL that was provided.  I was taken to lds.org, the \nofficial website of the Mormon Church, to a document that one can only find \nusing an alphabetic index, meaning you have to know the name of the \ndocument in order to find it.\n\nIn that memo, it listed all of Joseph Smith's wives.   I already knew that \nJoseph Smith had multiple wives, but that is all I knew.  The section of \nthe Doctrine and Covenants, the core scripture which contains modern day \nrevelation, is 132.  I knew that this section was written in 1842.  What I \nsaw in this memo was that Joseph's first plural wife was in 1831, 11 years \nBEFORE section 132 was made part of the D&C.\n\nI had to go outside the Church memo to learn more.  Joseph's first plural \nwife was Fanny Alger.   She was just 16 years old.   She had lived in the \nSmith household for 2 years.   There is a statement in the header of \nsection 132 in the D&C that says that Joseph Smith knew about the \nrevelation allowing plural marriage in 1831.   I could find no other \ninformation about when Joseph received this revelation nor when it had been \nfirst written down.   There is nothing written about who was first told \nabout this revelation.   The only thing written down is that Joseph Smith \nhad an emissary go to the Alger household and tell Fanny's Father that \nJoseph Smith loved his daughter and desired to marry her.  The father said \nyes, so the emissary asked the mother.   The mother said yes, so the \nEmissary asked Fanny.   Fanny said yes.   Joseph and Fanny were married \nthat day.   It is not known if Emma Smith, Joseph's first wife, knew that \nthis had taken place.  What we do know is that a short time later, Fanny \nleft LDS society and married a non-member by surname Custer and spent the \nrest of her life with him.  Fanny's brother asked Fanny about her \nrelationship with Joseph Smith shortly before her death, and she told him \nit was between her and God.\n\nAlthough it was common for young girls to marry men in their late 20s in \nthe early 1800s, I just didn't feel right about this.  I did not like it \nthat Fanny had lived in the Smith household for 2 years prior to this \nmarriage.  I guess what bothered me the most was that the record is not \nclear on what Emma Smith knew and how she felt about it.  The Church memo \nabout Joseph's multiple marriages did state that Emma and Joseph had a lot \nof conflict over this, and I assume that this was the reason that Emma \nSmith did not go to Utah with Brigham Young and the Saints.\n\nOliver Cowdery, a witness to the Book of Mormon (who claimed to have seen \nthe Angel Moroni) was very upset about this first plural marriage.   He \ncalled it a dirty, filty, nasty little affair.   Oliver was eventually \nexcommunicated from the Mormon Church because of this and other things.   I \ntried to give Joseph Smith the benefit of the doubt and not assume that \nJoseph had sex with Fanny before marriage.   What bother's me is that \nJoseph did not try hard enough to avoid the appearance of Evil.   If Fanny \nwas to live with the Smiths, he should have had a strict policy of hands \noff, like she had been one of his own children.   I was disillusioned by \nJoseph's behavior, which motivated me to look closer.\n\nI also didn't like how Joseph Smith married women who were already married. \n Joseph's marriage to them was for Eternity-Only, meaning that the marriage \ndidn't take effect until both of them were dead.  What I didn't like about \nthis is that it took away a man's wife forever.  When her current husband \ndied, he'd never see her again.  Worse, since he would be alone in the next \nlife, he would never make it to the highest level of the Celestial Kingdom, \ndamning the level of his eternal progress.  He would be a servant forever \n(unless he decided to have a plural marriage).\n\nSo I continued looking into other things.  The next big thing I found was \nabout how the translation of the Book of Mormon actually happened.  I won't \ngo into the details, but it really broke my heart.   And when I had learned \nabout all the changes that had been made to the Book of Mormon after it was \nfirst published, I was mad.   The Church continues to make changes to the \nBook of Mormon as needs occur.   One of the later changes to the Book of \nMormon was to change the phrase \"White and Delightsome People\" to \"Pure and \ndelightsome people\".   This is a big difference.  IMHO, it was done to \ncover up verses in the Book of Mormon which sound racist.\n\nSo I did an intense study for a week.   I skipped meals, I skipped sleep.   \nI found so much that I was overwhelmed by sorrow.   I was the Mormon who \nalways helped people move, who cared about other people's kids, and tried \nto teach the members how to be a good human being.  I feel betrayed by the \nChurch leadership over that last 2 centuries.   How could they do this?  \n\n I have not yet asked to have my name removed from the records of the \nChurch, but I will eventually, when my children and extended family are \nready for the shock.  I'll probably wait until my parents are dead.  In the \nmeantime, I have to figure out what I believe in now.\ufeff",

But these statistics belie the truth.\nAlthough 90-95% of Americans say they believe in God, most of them have a \nfaith that can only be described as extremely shallow.\nAfter World War II, 87% of those questioned said that they were absolutely \ncertain of God's existence (15). By 1964, the portion with no doubts had \nfallen to 77% of the population, and by 1981, to 62% (16).\nIn 1990, six out of seven said that it is okay not to believe in God (17).\nThe consensus that Jesus is God is also misleading. Many fewer now believe \nthat it is necessary to accept Jesus in order to be saved. In 1964, a bare \nmajority, 51%, still believed that Jesus is the only way. But the same \nmeasure slumped to 38% by 1981 (18). Since then, the measure must have \nslumped further.\nTwenty years ago, 70% identified the Bible as the word of God, but about \nthree sevenths of these also said that it contains mistakes (19).\nBelief in an afterlife remains prevalent. In 1990, 82% agreed that there is \nan afterlife including heaven and hell (20). But only 4% expected to go to \nhell, and 45% also believed in ghosts (21).\nAlmost a fourth of the populace accepts the occult to some degree. A full \n31% believe that some people have magical powers, 28% believe in \nwitchcraft, 24% in black magic, 20% in voodoo (22).\nA survey in 1990 looked at opinions on leading public issues. On no issue \ndid a majority feel that they needed religious guidance to the right \nanswer. On almost all issues, a majority did not even know what position \ntheir religion took (23).\nPerhaps the most dramatic proof that America is forsaking its Christian \nheritage emerges from the history of how the law views Christianity. In \n1892, the Supreme Court ruled that \"our civilization and our institutions \nare emphatically Christian\" (24). Today, the Supreme Court has gone so far \nin enforcing separation of church and state that, in the opinion of former \nChief Justice Rehnquist, it has become antireligious. In a dissenting \nopinion, he said that \"the tone of the Court's opinion . . . bristles with \nhostility to all things religious in public life\" (25).",

            "text": "Neofundamentalism and cultic fundamentalism\n\nThe segment of the church left behind as evangelicals drifted toward more \nliberal positions kept the name \"fundamentalist.\" But purity and unity \nwithin fundamentalism did not long survive all the divisive currents in the \nmodern church. As late as the 1960s, all fundamentalists could still \nassemble and feel that they shared a common identity. But then the \nfracturing process began. By the 1980s, two new movements had appeared, \nboth weighed down by apostate tendencies. One of these has been called \nneofundamentalism. The other I will call cultic fundamentalism.\n\"Neofundamentalism\" was originally a label that fundamentalist opponents of \nJerry Falwell pinned on his political action movement, known as the Moral \nMajority. The label is useful to signify churches and groups that have \nemerged from fundamentalism and acquired the following characteristics, now \nevident in many with no connection to Jerry Falwell:\nThey prefer modern translations of the Bible.\nIn 1950, Time Magazine, reporting on the revival at Wheaton College, spoke \nof it as bearing \"the stamp of its strict fundamentalist heritage: no \nmovies, smoking, card-playing, dancing or drinking,\" and it said derisively \nof the readers of Christian Life, a popular Christian magazine in those \ndays, \"Drinking, smoking, dancing, card-playing and movies they consider \nthe Devil's traps\" (1). These five prohibitions were for many years \nuniversally upheld by Bible-believing Christians. Christian institutions \nenforced them, and pastors denounced the forbidden practices as sin. Modern \nneofundamentalists may not openly reject the traditional standards of \nseparation, but they increasingly feel that insisting upon them is \nlegalistic.\nThey have adopted popular styles in sacred music.\nThey tend to be involved in politics, and in politics they do not hesitate \nto make alliances with religious groups that are nonfundamentalist or even \nunorthodox, like the Mormons.\nEvangelical churches display many of the same characteristics. So, it \nappears that except for their history, neofundamentalist churches are \nbecoming indistinguishable from evangelical churches.\nThe mark of cultic fundamentalism is its exaltation of one leader to \nspiritual supremacy. At least two fairly large cults have emerged in the \nlast twenty years, and more seem to be in the making. The first is the cult \nassociated with Jack Hyles and Peter Ruckman. The second is the Bill \nGothard cult.\nThe evolving distinctives of the first have clearly heretical tendencies.\nHyles and Ruckman teach that the King James translation of the Bible was \ngiven by inspiration.\nBoth men curry the adoration and total submission of their followers.\nBoth men are tolerant of divorce.\nBoth men promote ideas that verge on the bizarre (see the articles cited \nbelow).\nThe Gothard cult appeals to a different class of people, but is no less \ncultic in its suppression of individual soul liberty. The leader has drawn \nhis followers into a way of life that restricts their contact with people \noutside his control and binds them to his leadership for every decision \nthey make. What they believe, how they eat, how they manage their practical \naffairs, how they relate to each other, and what they teach their \nchildren\u2014all require attention to his teachings, some of which are clearly \nunbiblical. For example, he opposes (or at least many of his followers \nbelieve that he opposes) adoption, giving as his reason that a child of \nimmoral parents will inherit their moral weakness.\nExcellent critiques of these cults from an orthodox perspective are \navailable on the Web. By following the links, you will see informative \narticles on Bill Gothard, Peter Ruckman, and Jack Hyles. I do not agree \nwith every position taken, but the articles do well in exposing how far \nthese men have strayed from a sound Christianity. (Please inform me if any \nlink goes dead.)",

            "text": "Apostasy in the Church\n\nEvangelicalism and neoevangelicalism\n\nAt the turn of the century, the advances of liberalism alarmed true \nChristians and stirred them to action. They began to cooperate with each \nother in efforts to keep existing church organizations from going liberal. \nAround the time of World War I, a series of books called The Fundamentals \nappeared, defending at length the essential doctrines of Christianity. \nThese books were so influential that the new movement which had arisen to \nprotest liberalism took its name from them, calling itself fundamentalism.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, fundamentalists failed to oust liberals from control \nof the mainline denominations. In consequence, fundamentalism itself \ndivided into two camps. One warmly embraced the principle of ecclesiastical \nseparation\u2014the principle that a local assembly of believers must separate \nitself from apostate Christian organizations. The other took a less \nenthusiastic stance in favor of this principle.\nThe first camp left mainline denominations and began forming their own \ninstitutions, including schools, mission boards, and parachurch \nassociations. From them came the GARB, the Bible Baptists, the Bible \nPresbyterians, the IFCA, and other groups, as well as many strictly \nindependent churches.\nThe second camp included many who continued the battle of trying to purify \nthe mainline denominations, many (especially among the Southern Baptists) \nwho did not feel that liberalism threatened their own denomination, and \nmany who formed new churches but who maintained dialogue and cooperation \nwith more liberal elements in the church.\nIn time, largely as a result of patronizing the same religious media, the \nsecond camp coalesced into a distinct movement known as evangelicalism. \nThis movement has retained its cohesion even as it has forsaken its \noriginal identity and evolved into something more modern, tainted with \napostasy.\nIts chief error today is an emphasis on positives to the neglect of \nnegatives. Although an evangelical church may faithfully teach the basic \ndoctrines of Christianity\u2014the Trinity, the authority of the Bible, \nsalvation by faith, and so on\u2014it gives everything a wrong slant. It says \nmuch about the love of God, but very little about the judgment of God or \nGod's hatred of sin. It speaks often of heaven, but seldom of hell. Its \nmembers hear much about getting to heaven through a commitment to Christ or \nthrough being born again, but very little about repentance. They listen \noften to promises that the Christian life will make them happy, but seldom \nto warnings about the difficulties and demands of the Christian life. \nRather than burden them with negative rules and standards, their pastor \ntells them that they have liberty to live as they please, so long as they \ndo not break an explicit command of Scripture. As a result, they never \nescape a worldly lifestyle, because many modern vices were unknown in Bible \ntimes and the Bible says nothing against them.\nIn the 1950s a small group of Christian intellectuals spearheaded a new \nmovement that became known as neoevangelicalism. At the outset, the chief \ndistinctive of this movement was its desire to engage learned unbelievers \nin dialogue, seeking not only witness, but also an adjustment of Christian \nlanguage, traditions, and tenets to bring them into agreement with the \nestablished results of scientific and academic inquiry. Neoevangelicalism \nquickly gained the upper hand at institutions like Fuller Theological \nSeminary and Wheaton College. By now, its influence has been felt \neverywhere in evangelicalism, yet some clear differences between the older \nmovement and its spin-off remain.\nMost evangelicals are politically conservative, whereas many \nneoevangelicals follow trendy liberal causes. They tend to be pacifistic, \nto favor strong governmental action against social problems, and to support \nadvances in minority rights, including the rights of women and homosexuals.\nEvangelicals hold to the inerrancy of Scripture, whereas neoevangelicals \nreject inerrancy or else deny that the Creation accounts and other portions \nare meant to be taken literally.\nEvangelicals still oppose practices like drinking and smoking, and perhaps \neven rock dancing. Neoevangelicals have no such scruples, although they \nlook on smoking as unhealthy and inadvisable, and they endorse moderation \nin drinking.\nEvangelicals avoid fellowship with people in the liberal or neo-orthodox \nrealm, whereas neoevangelicals willingly interact and fellowship with \nanyone except a fundamentalist.",

The fathers of neo-orthodoxy \ninclude Karl Barth (called by Billy Graham one of the two greatest \ntheologians of our time, the other being Pope John the 23rd), Rudolph \nBultmann, Emil Brunner, and Reinhold Niebuhr. The essence of neo-orthodoxy \nis its claim that the Bible contains existential rather than factual truth. \nThat is, the Bible affords the religious man a valuable, time-honored \nframework for conceptualizing and describing his own personal encounters \nwith God (however he conceives of Him).\nNeo-orthodoxy permits a worshiper to mouth hymns and creeds that he does \nnot really believe. Thus today, if you visit a typical Methodist or \nLutheran church, you hear liturgies that seem to exalt Father, Son, and \nHoly Spirit, yet when you meet the ministers privately, they will (if they \nare honest) confess their unbelief that the historical Jesus was anything \nmore than a man. How do they justify their public affirmations of orthodox \nfaith? They regard the language of orthodoxy as simply a vehicle for \nattaining a satisfying religious experience. Subjective experience rather \nthan objective truth is, in their view, the foundation of religion.",

            "text": "Apostasy in the Church\n\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the church of Jesus Christ is sick \nwith apostasy, debilitating every missionary work, every Christian school, \nevery witness through the media, and every local assembly of believers. The \napostasy that now fills the whole church germinated in about 1800. Since \nthen, it has steadily grown and spread, with corrupting effects that can be \nclearly seen in two ways.\nChristianity has fragmented into ideological camps, all of which to some \ndegree reject Biblical faith and practice.\nWestern society as a whole, once composed of nations that prided themselves \non their allegiance to the Christian religion, has become thoroughly \nsecularized.\nThe sorry state of the contemporary church exactly reproduces all the \nprophetic pictures of the church in the Last Days, on the eve of Christ's \nreturn. According to prophecy, it would be a church riddled with corruption \nand crippled by apostasy.\n\nLiberalism\n\nBefore the eighteenth century, no one who considered himself a Christian \ndoubted that the Bible is true, and in European society there were few who \nwere willing to say that they were not Christians. But in the eighteenth \ncentury, the educated elite began to drift away from Christianity toward \nalternative world views conceived by speculative philosophy. The most \npopular of these was deism. Its core belief was that God created the \nuniverse as a self-perpetuating machine, operating according to natural \nlaws discoverable by science. This new world view denied the supernatural, \nas well as God's continuing involvement in human affairs.\nIn the early nineteenth century, doubt in the supernatural and in Biblical \nhistory began to infect organized Christianity. The Unitarians, prominent \nin New England, went so far as to reject the full deity of Christ. Under \nthe influence of the movement in literature and art known as romanticism, \nmany of them believed that God is a mystic oversoul transcending nature yet \nintimately in union with it. That conception of God was called \ntranscendentalism.\nAfter the publication of Darwin's Origin of the Species in the 1860s, \nimportant segments of the church accepted his ideas and abandoned belief in \nthe literal truth of the Scriptures. Then emerged a new form of theology \nknown as liberalism. Its basic tenets were these:\nAlthough the Bible offers spiritual and ethical insights, it is only a \ncollection of human writings. Many of them must be classified as folk tales \nor legends with no historical value.\nJesus may have been divine in the sense that we are all divine, but He was \nnot uniquely God. Nor did He exist before His birth. Nor was He born of a \nvirgin. Nor did He rise bodily from the grave.\nThe purpose of life is not personal salvation from sin, but salvation of \nsociety from the evils of poverty, ignorance, and injustice.\nIn some of its manifestations, liberalism came close to denying God \ncompletely, except as a human thought.\nBy the early 1900s, liberalism had gained control of all the Protestant \nseminaries and had won over many pastors, missionaries, denominational \noverseers, and college officials. Although the average churchgoer was still \nfairly conservative, his leaders were working feverishly to bring his views \nup to date.\nBut liberalism had an unexpected effect. The average churchgoer had enough \nsense to recognize that if liberalism is right, why go to church? By \nmidcentury it became obvious that the mainline churches where liberalism \nwas dominant were losing people. So, liberals in religious professions \nbegan looking for a more appealing theology that would still accommodate \ntheir unbelief. The new theology that they created is known as \nneo-orthodoxy.",

And next, that Mormonism happened in recorded history \n200 years ago. Well, 1800 years ago it was 200 years from Christ's time so \nby using the standard of the video there was a solid 200 years to refute \nthe gospel claims (which don't contradict) as this video refutes Mormonism. \nWhat I'm saying here isn't even a religious thing it's a logical thing. \nUsing the standard of Cenk's words in this video he refutes his attempt to \ndiscard the Bible. A paused 4:28 frame is really all you can say to this.\n\nAlso as Miki says we don't need the internet to abandon a false faith at \n1:30 . Totes.\n\nAt the end Cenk wants to be an authority on Mormonism and Islam, but at the \nsame time be funny, somehow respectable at his lack of knowledge of names \nand cavalier attitude toward the subject as a whole.\n\nIf you're not a religious person and you are reading this just know that \nthis type of inconsistency and lack of knowledge is not commendable.\n\nAlso, at the end Miki just looks uncomfortable. I know the awkward smile \nand laugh and look away move people do when another person is making them \nuncomfortable. Such as  6:22 .\n\nThanks\ufeff",
