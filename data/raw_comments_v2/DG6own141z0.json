            "text": "+skydyverjym I know exactly what he is talking about genius. Right around \n0:40 you can see straight into the slip adapter which is where the o-ring \nis seated. You can also see it at 1:28. It's *not* a groove. It's a \nstep *exactly* as I described. That's the step which is the thickness of \nthe wall of the pvc pipe which fits in there. That step is what allows the \ninner diameter of the slip adapter to that of the pipe itself so there is \nno loss or change in pressure.\n\nIf, insted of finding a flat step you instead are finding a sloped area \nlike in this picture: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318mWHLfIRL.jpg\n\nthen you are likely using a reducer and not an adapter. The reducer has \nsloped walls in order to convert the 3/4 in pipe to a smaller inner \ndiameter as in the example I provided which goes from 3/4 to 1/2 inch.\n\nIf that's the case then you could easily alter the plan to make use of a \nsimple 3/4 inch pvc clip coupling:\n\nhttp://www.irrigationsupplydepot.com/34pvcslipcoupling.aspx#.VURG2flVhBc\n\nBasically you would have the slip adapter attaching to a short piece of \npipe, about an inch and a half to accommodate the depth of both fittings. \nOn the other side of the pipe you attach the slip coupling linked right \nabove. On the other side of the step in that coupling you place the o-ring \nthen the marble then the piece of pvc pipe with the retention bar then the \nother threaded slip adapter.\n\nAlso, I found this bit rather amusing \"*i am not talking about the slip, i \nam talking about the groove he points out in detail and explains about \nwhere the o-ring sits. it is at the butt of the slip.*\"\n\nSoooo.....are you talking about the slip or not?\n\nLol.\n\nAnd by the way, I know what I'm talking about genius. I've laid out \nnumerous lawn irrigation systems and have done tons of plumbing jobs in my \nlife.\n\nBest of luck chump.",

When you \nslide the adapter over the non-threaded pipe the end of the pipe buts up \nagainst the step inside the adapter so the inner diameter is consistent. \nAll the o-ring does is get squeezed in between that step and the end of the \nnon-threaded pipe.\n\nMaybe you picked up something else but I picked up mine from Home Depot \neasy peasy.",

I had 3 check valves on 1 unit and \nit seems after a dozen or so flashbacks, the check valves stop working. I \nhad 3 valves on 1 hose that all failed from 1 flashback, blew into the \nbubbler and fortunately I had the hose on loose so the hose blew off rather \nthan the bubbler head. I think the problem is the gas explodes so fast, \nthat the flame passes through the valves before the actual air pressure can \nclose them. So I need to build some super heavy duty 100% fail proof check \nvalve. And I'm definitely not relying on this unit.\ufeff",

I'd slam it once, \nsee if I could breathe through, slam again, do a breathe test. I basically \nkept slamming till it took a bit of pressure to blow through the torch \nhead. \n\nHowever, with further testing I've found out that the way I shut off the \ntorch seems to be the main problem.\n\nWhen I shut the torch off, I slowly turn the knob off. And that seems to \nhave been the issue. Now I engraved a mark on the knob with my dremel. So I \nslowly close the knob on the torch, but I know after that \"dash\" I need to \nQUICKLY shut the valve. As in, I jerk my wrist as quickly as possible and \nnow it seems like flashbacks have stopped completely.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is you really need to be QUICK with the valve. \nIf I'm just a teeny bit slow I'll get a flashback. I'm new to this whole \nHHO thing and still can't get over how fast this gas burns. It's not even \nlike a \"burn\". It almost seems like the gas \"detonates\" if that makes sense.",
