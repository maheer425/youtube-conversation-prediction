Do you even call him that? \nHere in the UK, this mythical figure has always been called Father \nChristmas. He was the personification of Christmas (originally referred to \nas just \"Christmas\" or \"Sir Christemas\") He was generally depicted as a \njolly old man who brought joy and cheer at Christmas time. \n\nMost of the rest of Europe have different traditions. Some do the \nChristkind (Christ Child), which from what I gather isn't so much the baby \nJesus but a kind of spirit that brings presents on Christmas Eve. \n\nThen there is St. Nick also known as Sinta Klaus, which is where Santa \nClaus developed from. The reindeer, sleigh, the red outfit happened over \ntime. \n\nThis video goes into much more information - it is fascinating! \n\nOf course the real meaning of Christmas - the incarnation and birth of \nJesus Christ can and does get lost in all of this. \n\nSo, what will you be doing this Christmas? \n\nMerry Christmas! \n\n#Christmas \ufeff",
