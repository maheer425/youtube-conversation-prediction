Every species you catch and \nfilm is exhausted and generally injured in some way (while this one looks \nmore tame than anything else...you must have kept it in a hot box until you \nneeded him/her.  Camera tricks of the worst kind.  You never actually show \nthe catch or much of the abuse you perform. \nYou are an embarrassment to conservation and education and you, sir, are \n100% a fraud.  No wild freshly caught bird would ever act this way.  You \ntire out your subjects for the camera to make yourself look brave.  You are \noffensive and cruel.\n\nSince you seem to want fame so much, you'll likely get it, but for your \ndisrespect to wildlife and nothing more.  Like a poacher, only worse \nbecause they aren't pretending to be heroic. \n\nWant to prove your worth?  Show us the uncut footage next time.  Not the \nlie you want to portray.\ufeff",

Or because he seems \nto catch them rather \"too quickly\" for it to be true ?\n\nHere's one word for you \"Editing\".\n\nWhen an animal documentary channel shows a video footage of any \nanimal/plant species hunting in action, they must go through a ridiculously \nlong process of stalking and editing to capture the \"interesting\" part :\n\n1) They must gather intel about the subject (plant/animal), in order to \nfind it's location, his behavior and under wich circumstances it hunts, all \nin order to survey it.\n2) Finding the best camera angle and programming both it's settings and \nthat of the microphone, in order to get the cleanest sound/video possible.\n3) *waiting*.\n4) Getting the footage back to the studio and editing the *hours* of \nuseless boring video in loop until finding the \"interesting\" part, cutting \nit from the rest and editing it for the documentary.\n\nThat's video editing in the grand lines.\n\nI don't really get why \"finding\" animals and/or plants is perceived \nautomatically weird or suspicious when relating to a video footage - \nwhatever the footage for what it means. When you go on wikipedia looking \nfor an animal or a plant, you can easily get it's biography by just writing \nit's name and acessing it a single click. Of course it doesn't mean that it \nmakes you an expert on the subject, but those informations already manage \nto give you a considerable insight on it by telling you almost everything \nabout it : what are the perceptive senses on wich it rely the most ? Those \nthat he do not use ? When does he act ? Where ? At wich time of the day ? \nUnder witch meteorological conditions does or doesn't it move ? What are \nhis preys/predators ? How does he act in presence of those ? etc. etc. It's \na long process of collecting and treating datas accurately that, once \nprocessed, allows the hunter to develop and effective strategy in order to \ncapture the subject (plant/animal) he's hunting. *It is the same process \nthat allowed humans to effectively hunt absolutely ANY species on earth \nthroughout the millenars, and never ended being refined all along since \nancient time*.\n\nAs a matter of fact : *absolutely not a single species on Earth ever \nachieved to hunt so many other species, in both diversity and dangerosity, \nnearly as much as man*. Every single species accurately documented *has \nbeen hunted* at least a dozen times by humans from all regions across the \nglobe : *that is fact*.\n\nSo please, explain me, how in the unholy name of balls could anyone in it's \nright mind consider \"weird\" for a human being to find and hunt an animal in \nthe wild, when that is exactly what our ancestors did *FOR HUNDREDS OF \nTHOUSANDS OF YEARS* ?",
