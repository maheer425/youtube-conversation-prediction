Republic \nonly means the head of state is not hereditary. If we are to define Empire \nas state the rules over a diverse of subject people acquired via conquest, \nthen there's nothing keeping us from saying that from the 2nd Punic War \ntill Augustus, Rome was **both** a Republic and an Empire.\n\nMore importantly:\n2) There was no abstract idea of Rome to be loyal to. That is projecting \nmodern Nationalism back to ancient times. In a culture based on \npatron-client relationship such as Ancient Rome, the soldiers were loyal to \nRome by being loyal to the general. Once again these are not mutually \nexclusive. They simply believed the generals were the best person to lead \nthem in a time of strife, and they would be proven correct when the general \nwon battles, paid them bonuses, gave them land, and ended civil wars.\ufeff",

I think it's also worth mentioning that \na lot of the men in Ceasar's legions came from Transalpine and Cisalpine \nGaul, who had been assimilated, and so the new generations definitely \nwanted to prove their loyalty.",

Now, in the beginning \nthis commission was made up of only senators that usually were also the \ngovernors (since to become  agovernor you needed to spend a lot of cash and \nfavours). And basically they were always absolved even if they were bad \nadministrators, corrupted and ruined the provinces for their own interest. \nthis caused a long dispute with the \"knights\" that wanted to obtain places \nin that tribunal to judge governor.....for exemple Sulla gave back this \ntribunal (the qaestio de repetundis) tot he senators...\n\n\"Pleb council to keep the Senate in check\" not quite so..the assembly in \nrome were 3 : the curiate and the tribal assembly who ahd limited juridic \nand legislative power and were divided into curiae and tribes...and the one \nyou are probably talking about : the comitia centuriata..this was the MAIN \nassembly of the romans in wich everyone took part and wich was asked to \ndeliberate the most important decisions...the problem was that this \nassembly was divided into centuriae and the patricians had 80 centuriae, \nthe equites 18 and ALL the others (the biiiig majority) onyl had \n97...therefore the 2 highest classes ( the rich and aristocratic people) \nhad almost ALWAYS the majority in the vote.\n\nThe only tool the plebs had to defend their interests were the TRIBUNES of \nthe plebs....these guys could put a  veto on the senate and assembly \ndecisions.\n\nOr there was the Concilia plebis, an asssembly of only plebeans who decided \nabout plebean magistrates and such.\n\nStill the power was iin the ends of 3 things.the senate, the Centuriate \nassembly and the Consules.\n\nThe Tribal assembly was not as important as this 3. And it wasn't of the \nplebs only. EVERY roman was part of a tribe. And every tribe had a vote. \nTribes were not divided by census (richness) but by tribe: where do people \nlived, in what area, what were their parents.\n\nThis was a  minor assembly wich elected only the tribuns of the plebs and \nother minor magistrates such as (qaestores,aediles, tribunus militum) and \nhad legislative and judicial powers...but always minor stuff like judging \nadministrative crimes etc...\n\n\nI am a bit rusty on this stuff but I studied it 2 years ago at the \nuniversity ;-)",
