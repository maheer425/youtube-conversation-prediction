I have \na total of 11 lessons a week, excluding school and aftershcool. So every \nweekday, I get up at 6 am, school starts at 7 and ends at 3 pm. I get home, \ndo both lessons, shower, eat dinner, and barely start doing homework at 8 \npm. And for me, I have school homework plus homework for 2 lessons that I \nhave the next day. 2 of the lessons I have is 1.5 hours at 6 pm, but the \nteacher usually comes 10-30 minutes late, which means ending late, usually \nat 8 pm... This kind of lifestyle is taking a big toll on me, depriving me \nof sleep so I have bags under my eyes during school and lessons, and it's \ngetting more noticable that I am getting too little sleep. I tend to fall \nasleep in class and during lesson... now I just wish that the future would \ncome quickly when I am on my deathbed, without a care in the world \nanymore...\ufeff",

When I was \nin high school, I would fall asleep around 9:00PM or 10:00PM and wake up \naround 6:00AM or 7:00AM interchangeably. Now that I'm older, I fall asleep \naround 9:30PM or 10:00PM and when I wake up around 7:00AM for an entire \nweek, I progressively feel more tired. Nine hours of sleep is too much for \nme, so I sleep around 8 hours a day with a few naps in-between whenever I \ncan manage to squeeze those in my schedule. Needless to say, too much sleep \ncan be a bad thing, as well!\ufeff",
