The moral is to \"be on time and \nstay focused\", not slow and steady. The hare loses because he represents \nthe lack of care for a given objective and procrastination due to \nover-confidence in one's abilities. So yes, turtoise wins, but only if you \ntake the fable as what it is: an allegory. Of course, the hare would win in \nthe real world but that's not what fables tell. Still, I suppose your point \nstands as a way to see things differently and prevent misconceptions. And \nsince I come from a french speaking culture, maybe the fable has another \nmeaning in anglo-saxon cultures. Anyway, thank you for the videos and keep \nmaking things awesome.\ufeff",

A box turtle (the oldest \nmaking it to 138 years) can travel at a speed of .3 miles per hour. Now, I \nhave box turtles, so I'll use sleeping statistics from observation. In my \nscenario, both animals will sleep and then race, but that's all they will \ndo. My turtles wake up around 8 and are active until about 5. They also \nhibernate. While this winter they did not go under until November (anyone \nwant some turtle shells?) they usually go down in October and come up in \nMarch. That leaves 7 months, 10 hours a day. That is 149,040 miles in a \nlifetime. A hare is active from \"dawn to midmorning,\" but let's say 6 to \n10. But hares do not hibernate, they just become less active. So, for 5 \nmonths, they are only up for 2 hours, not 4. (I'll stick with 45 for the \nspeed and a lifespan of 5 years). That is 486,000 miles in a lifetime. \nObviously the hare wins and I am a total nerd. \ufeff",
