In the city of Leiden, they could practice their religion \nfreely. *One of the Pilgrim Mothers is direct maternal ancestor Obama. And \nthe brother of the Pilgrim Mother is an ancestor of Obama's predecessor, \nGeorge Bush.*\n\nIn Leiden is a plaque with the names of families who set out in 1620 with \nthe famous \"Mayflower\" to America. On the panel are also the names of \nThomas Blossom, his wife and their daughter Elizabeth. *Barack Obama's \nmother is descended from this Elizabeth.* Franklin Roosevelt also had \nancestors in Leiden, as the Bush family: Elizabeth Blossoms brother Peter. \nObama is now the eighth president who comes from the Pilgrims in Leiden.\n\nWhy the Pilgrims left Holland one day? At some point was even Holland them \ntoo liberal, they were afraid the wickedness in the land of dykes. And \nthat's why they dared in 1620, the crossing to America. And today will be \none of their descendants of the 44th President of the United States.\n\n*Hail the faith in democracy!*\ufeff",

The proof is in the regulation requiring the studies as every \ntransferal counts as a new business.\n\nBefore the Clean Air Act people forced polluters to fix problems through \ncivil laws suites and now they can't as the legislation that formed the EPA \nvested that power to the EPA and cancer ally from oil refineries in the \nsouthern states still exists due to the EPA only applying tiny fines and \napproving toxin levels.\n\nPolicing Wall Street is easy they make bad investments and they go out of \nbusiness and the public learns to pay attention to their investments \ninstead of blindly dumping money on Hucksters. But you Rewarded them with \nbailouts and quantitative easing so they have no incentive to stop their \nbehavior.\n\nOSHA can be eliminated by simply using the negligent homicide and assault \nlaws as they have far greater penalties and are readily enforceable.\n\nWork hours and wages is a simple matter that resolves it's self when \ncompetition is allowed IE workers are unhappy with 80 hours a week they can \ngo to a business that wants happier more productive workers that offers \nthem lower hours per week and it happened back in the 1900's those who \ndidn't like it Moved on and the factory owners had to import more workers \nwho then moved on in successive waves.\nWages rise when businesses have a limited labor pool and the only real way \nto shrink that pool is to increase the number of businesses drawing from it.\nYour 40 hour week has been destroyed by the Affordable Care Act given that \nin order to avoid the penalties hours are being cut to less than 29 per \nweek and that means many people will have to get two jobs  increasing the \nhours worked overall to above 40. It does give a nice illusion that the \neconomy is improving however due to the want ads to fill those new part \ntime jobs.\n\nCapitalism exists without government regulations Bitcoin and other \ncryptocurrencies for example.
