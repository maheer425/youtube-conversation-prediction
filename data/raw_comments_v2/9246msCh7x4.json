The troll kills five or six villagers and no one \nmentions them again, though their families were surely going hungry.  They \ndidn't speak with accents, they used modern phraseology and modern lingo. \n Hansel's repeating crossbow has a setting that makes it fire one arrow to \nthe left and one to the right - because such a thing is so useful in \nsituations where you are suddenly confronted with a witch on each side of \nyou but none in front of you - which I'm sure happens about once per week. \n Anyway, if such a situation just so happens, make sure the witches line up \nexactly right so they can both be simultaneously shot even though you're \nnot looking at either of them.\ufeff",

If you want a movie that you can \nlaugh *at*, not always *with*, then go ahead and take the plunge and invest \nyour hour and a half in this homage to inane blood splatter, which has as \nmuch to do with the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale as Charlie's Angels had to \ndo with law enforcement. Replay value very low. I know I'd never see it \nagain on purpose.\n\n\nOne big problem with liking this movie is that it isn't unique or special \nin any way. It specializes in slick but silly action and tossing off one \nliners, but there are many movies that do the same. There are no genuine \nheartfelt moments, no real character development, no complexity in the \ncharacters. For example, Heath Ledger's Joker was an outstanding character, \nas was Nolan's Batman. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark. Not \nenough blood? Check Quentin Tarantino's D'jango (\"The 'D' is SILENT, \nmotherfucker!!\"), Inglorious Basterds and especially Pulp Fiction; all of \nwhich have excellent characters, dialogue, and a whole lot of blood. I may \nwatch a sloppily made movie like Hansel & Gretel, but I wouldn't waste time \nwatching it again when I can watch some other slapped together claptrap in \nhopes that it is a diamond in the rough.",
