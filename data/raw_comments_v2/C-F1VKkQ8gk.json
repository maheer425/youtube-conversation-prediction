            "text": "The thing about the kinetic tiles is that walking on them will make you \nmore tired than walking on tarmac. This is because  they absorb your \nkinetic energy and as a result there is less of a bounce and thus more \neffort is required on your part. This can likened to trying to run on sand \nwhen there is no \"bounceback\" as the sand absorbs your KE so it is harder \nto run or walk. \ufeff",
