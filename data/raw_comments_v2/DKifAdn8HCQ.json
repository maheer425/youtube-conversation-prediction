However I understand reasons behind why women choose \nto have an abortion and on some reasons I agree. The thing I do not agree \nwith is using your religion to decide someone else's fate if a woman wants \nan abortion give her the f**king abortion do not let your beliefs cloud yor \njudgement because it can lead to devastating consequences. Furthermore \npeople using the bible as a reason  for being against abortion the bible is \napart of your religion it is not what decides your opinions and the actions \nyou take in life . Also maybe in the bible god said \"thou shall not kill\" I \ndon't know and personally I don't give two flying donkeys but using what \nyou believe in to make others who make decisions such as abortion feel \nlike crap is wrong. Maybe it makes you feel superior to people that don't \nshare your beliefs and so on  I don't know. But did you ever think that if \ngod really existed he would have known about the diseases that affect the \nchildren today people who believe in god say he is all knowing but if he \nreally was all knowing wouldn't he help us find a way to protect the \nchildren from these diseases wouldn't he at least try to help us?.\n\n\nAnyway this is just MY opinion on this situation and I would like to \napolgise to anyone who has took offense to my opinion I don't mean for \nanyone to take offense as you may have already guessed I am not a believer \nof god and what he stands for but  I am respectful for anyone who believes \nin him because that is their  chioce like believing in abortion is my \nchioce.\ufeff",

In fact when this \nheadline came out two years ago, everyone I knew agreed that it was \ndisturbing and utterly ridiculous that a woman died by being denied an \nabortion. The vast majority of Ireland, the middle aged to younger \ngeneration at least, feel oppressed by the Church-and-State archaic laws. \nWe are literally right next to the UK yet we are 30 years behind them in \nterms of progression and the modern era. I love being Irish but in relation \nto Irish laws, I'm ashamed. I hate that we are known globally as being an \nuptight and oppressed nation who blindly follow the Church. The thing is \nthat Ireland has become quite multinational in the past 10-15 years. Many \npeople are born and raised Catholic, yes, but by parents who don't even \npractice the faith. In other words, Irish people are notoriously known for \nblindly following the religion that has oppressed and bullied us, and \nsexually assaulted our children, for the past 100 years. Do I believe in \nGod? Yes. But the Catholic Church makes me sick. I was \"raised a Catholic\" \nbecause if you didn't baptize your child back in 1993, well firstly you \ncouldn't have gotten into any school, and secondly you would pretty much be \ndisowned by your family. I made the sacraments, communion, confession and \nconfirmation through no choice of my own but through my primary school's \nrules. My family and I are now proudly ex Catholics. And if/when I have \nchildren, I'll be damned if I get them baptized as babies against their own \nwill or take them to a judgmental church on Sundays. Irish people put down \nin writing that they're Catholic, but every year, fewer and fewer regularly \nattend Church. It makes me sick to be part of a nation dominated by \nreligion and appallingly disgusting laws.\ufeff",

They obviously aren't falling flat \nbecause you are stomping your christian footsies.

Again, stop getting upset, if \nyou didn't hate women then you would understand their situation.

Asides, sex is healthy, and makes up for a good \nemotional and physical balance.\n\nTwo things that astound me about this argument: for one, women who get \nabortions, for the most part, aren't these crazy sluts who go around \nsleeping with everyone without protection, getting an abortion every other \nday. for most women who get an abortion, this is a once-in-a-liftetime \nsituation, which is incredibly hard and traumatic for them to begin with. \nIt's not a decision most women would ever take lightly. As for the rest, \nstatistically theres a 2% abusers in every system whatsoever, so thats not \nan argument. \n\nsecondly, \"if my mom would have aborted i wouldn't be alive\". yeah, because \nyou are necessarily the best option for this planet. Personally, if my mom \nhadn't had an abortion long before i was born, she would have never \nfinished college, never gotten a doctors degree, never would've met my dad \nand never would've met me. I am now a balanced person with a wonderful \nchildhood and life, educated and with so many possibilities for my future. \nMy \"older sibling\" would've had nothing to start a life with. no father, no \nmoney to finance any further education after highschool. so yea, i am \ngrateful my mom had an abortion, because otherwise i wouldn't be here. This \nway, there have been two wonderful lives lived, her own, and mine, whereas \nmy \"older sibling\" would have ended her young career, and probably wouldnt \nhave had such a great life either.\n\nAnd even ignoring all the above. YOUR FUCKING BOOK OF ANCIENT FAIRY TALES \nDOESN'T GET TO MAKE LAWS. it's everyones own decision whether or not to \nhave a baby, plus there are laws in most countries (at least where i am \nfrom), that you cant have it past 3 months into the pregnancy or so, and i \nam pretty sure that there are good reasons for these time markers. so \nplease stop being butthurt, you don't know the situations of most women who \ngo through this, and for the most of them, it is not light hearted, but \nextremely difficult anyway. so don't be an ass and make it even worse.\ufeff",

That's part of why my ancestors came to Virginia from Ireland in \nthe mid-1700's. Most of family has been in the Lutheran denomination of \nChristianity for centuries. They hated the Catholic oppression. \n\nOur Supreme Court in the US needs to address these 20-week bans that are \nbecoming popular in many of the Bible Belt States.Like Ohio's, they are \njust as vague and we could have a case like Savita's here. It's already \nhappened when a woman has no choice but to go to a Catholic Hospital. The \nHospital System in my city is Catholic and we could very well have this \nhappen.",

I don't think you're \nhorrible. \n\nI get the same being pro-choice. I do not think that elective abortions \nshould be done past viability. Yet, I get pro-lifers assuming that I think \nthat way just because there are some people that are pro-choice do.\n \nWhen the topic of post-viability elective abortions comes up and someone \nmakes an accusation that I believe that a woman should be able to get an \nelective abortion at 9 months, I ignore because that's not me.

Ohio has passed HB 78 in 2011, which is a 20 week \nban that contains a exception for the mother's life in danger or if the \nmother is at risk of a major bodily impairment, but yet it doesn't really \ncite that many specifics. Sponsors of this bill were asked why it wasn't \nclearer and asked for clarity and the sponsor couldn't clarify what \nmother's life in danger or severe, bodily impairment meant. I bet the \nIreland law was and still is the same way and possibly still is. To violate \nthese bills means loss of a doctor's medical license, fines, and lots of \ntime in jail. Doctors play it safe instead of risk breaking a very vague \nlaw. It's understandable. That was the objection of a lot of OB/GYNs in \nOhio, who spoke at the 2011 HB 78 hearings. That they would leave, because \nthe law was too vague and didn't want to risk loss of their medical \nlicense, fines, and time in jail or prison.",
