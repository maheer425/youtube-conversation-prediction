He had to bear on his \nshoulders that he had killed one of the last of his kind (ICE-BREATH, \nICE-BREATH, ICE-BREATH). Really, it was just...not the Superman we \nknow...it wasn't even an enraged Superman or the classic super-powered \nalien Boy Scout we all know and love. It was because of Snyder, if you ask \nme, he does depressing films like 300...thank God this Superman isn't cruel \nenough to throw 'yo' mamma' jokes at Batman...I was hoping this would turn \nit wicked.
