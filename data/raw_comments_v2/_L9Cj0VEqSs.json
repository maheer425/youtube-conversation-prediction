I was super annoyed \nbecause I had been looking forward to it. My friend was like aw it will be \nfine you can just borrow a tampon, but I had never tried a tampon because I \nwas kinda scared. Anyway it was after school and I was at her house and I \nwas like, it's okay guys I'll just sit at the side, and they were all like \nawh hell nawh just put a tampon in, so I tried it and I couldn't do, it \nhurt like hell and it just wouldn't go up, I started panicking that my \nvagina was broken or something. So anyway I tried again and it just wasn't \nworking and they were all giving me support from outside the bathroom. I \nstarted to cry cause I thought that I probably didn't even have a vagina \nhole because it wouldn't go up and so we all watched some educational \nperiod videos and I like got through my friends entire tampon pack until we \ncame to the conclusion that it wasn't going to work but they convinced me \nto go in the hotub anyway with like five pairs of pants on and I was all \ngood. So that's my story, I have just officially embarrassed my self for \nlife im going to change my name to Rodriguez and move to Mexico \ufeff",
