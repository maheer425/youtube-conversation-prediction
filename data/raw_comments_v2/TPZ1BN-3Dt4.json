I don't care if you have a lot \nof experience, like I said any idiot can see that this bird is not in the \nshape it SHOULD be in. The video description says that these people handle \nrescue birds, so a simple conclusion would be that this is probably a bird \nthat was maltreated and started plucking, it's not the woman's fault.
