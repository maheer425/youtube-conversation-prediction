Additionally, with this type \nof system, you can't vary the valve lift like Honda's VTEC or Toyota's \nValve-Matic. Airflow doesn't like big lifts at low rpm.

The Scuderi engine in the USA is more complex, having a \ncamshaft and two compressor cylinders, and can also use the engine as an \nair pump. However the Koenigsegg approach, by eliminating a camshaft, which \ntakes power from the crank to turn and lubricate it, and reducing the size \nand weight of the engine by 25-30%, and acting as an air pump, would be \nsuperior to the Scuderi engine.\n\nDownsized it can be used as a range extender in an electric hybrid. Using \nlaser ignition & direct injection (The two go together) and eliminating the \ncamshaft a highly efficient engine (to current piston engines) can be \nproduced with fewer weighty cylinders as well - a heavy flywheel can be \neliminated when only turning a generator.  An efficient  2 cylinder range \nextender engine is possible - smaller in size and weight to stow out of the \nway in a car, and returning excellent fuel efficiency.\ufeff",

            "text": "OK take this further. Koenigsegg states that the SAAB engine can be a \nabout three quarters of the size and weight and that fuel efficiency, \ntorque and power will increase by 30%. Great. If it is reliable then go \nwith it. Then he says that the engine can be also used as an air pump \nreclaiming kinetic braking energy - great go for it. More gain there.\n\nOr use a supercapacitor to store electrical kinetic energy rather than air. \nWhy? Because further gains can be made by taking ancillaries away from the \ncrank which consume HP and making them all electric. \n\nHaving a variable speed electric water pump improves fuel consumption and \nwill run at full flow even at idle to cool the engine if needed.  Also an \nelectric clutch on the alternator, which disengages when accelerating \nwhen using fuel - It engages only when braking or slowing down or when the \nbattery is too low.\nAir conditioning can be the absorption system that operates on only heat. \nOr again have an electric clutch on it only cutting in when braking or \ndecelerating - great in city driving.\n\nEven a variable speed electric oil pump, which varies the pressure to what \nthe engine needs when running. A mechanical oil pump takes a lot of HP from \nthe crank and most of this is to just get oil onto the camshaft. The \nelectric pump can pre-charge the oil galleries before the engine turns to \nstartup, ensuring oil is at the bearings and no dry running. Having no \ncamshaft means an electric oil pump is feasible.\n\nIt is possible to reduce fuel consumption by 50% if all is done right like \nabove.  But Koenigsegg are tying to get only one aspect accepted first. I \nwish them the best of luck.\ufeff",

I was referring originally to the current range of Ferrari and \nLamborghini, which are in a different league compared to the superior range \nof Koenigseggs. Veneno is just a tuned Aventador (absolutely nothing wrong \nwith that!) and the LaFerrari is a 458/Enzo with a an electric motor. \nHowever the LaF does have KERS as its merit, which is cool. Only 3 Veneno \nwere made so that hardly counts as a \"series\". I just find the innovations \nthat Koenigsegg have done/been part of are more substantial than what other \nhave been up to. The Triplex suspension, 3G telemetry, Flexfuel system, \nfree valve technology. The thinking that goes into making a car go and stop \nfrom 281mph has to be innovative.",

But seen as you did not ask me, and in this case it would \nactually be very informative to know in which way, you think the Veneno and \nthe LaF sets themselves apart compared to Koenigsegg, when it comes to new \ntechnology? And just to get it out of the way, the hybrid technology \nimplemented by Ferrari is not new, and it was a choice from Koenigsegg not \nto go that route, not a could-not. And just to make it clear, this is not \nabout hating on the LaF, I'm very impressed with it and like it. I just \ndon't understand why you are saying what you are.",
