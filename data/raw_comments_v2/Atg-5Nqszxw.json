Why is it sometimes that \nlarge companies have higher chances to grow the larger they are only by \nbuying smaller companies or driving them to bancrupcy, like an organism \nthat gets bigger and bigger the more it eats. Souldn't we have an \neconomical system that also set companies a limit in growth, so that the \ngrowth of both the economy and the human population won't exceed the \nwildlife on earth? With our system we have nowadays we'll have huge \nenvironmental and bioeconomical problems because it is oriented on infinite \ngrowth without any limit. Of course this system will at some point collapse \nwhen there are no natural ressources anymore. But I think then it will \nalready be too late.\ufeff",

The key difference \nhere is that for the plant that over-populates this is inevitably a bad \nthings, but I don't think this is true of a big business. At no size does \nthe consumption of its resource become a detriment to itself. \n\nThat being said I don't disagree with your point about limiting the growth \nof companies, just not for any reason of being more similar to plant \ncompetition.\n\nBut limits on human population? That's a scary and apparently unnecessary \nproposition. The best way to fight overpopulation is to fight poverty.",
