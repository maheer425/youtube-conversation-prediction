They seem to have a real stalking \nproblem over there. Even getting a name for it.\nOh, don't worry. I'm the kinda person that agrees that unfortunately \nstereotypes exist and some people exemplify why some forms of racism are \neven around. Perhaps I just felt like \"Asian fans are so stupid\" was too \nmuch of a blanket statement.\nI only wanted to point out that there might be an underlying cause to it, \nthat Korean culture doesn't seem to care. Like it's the norm to have \nclearly mental teenage girls who need help because obsession is a very \nunhealthy behavior. Instead the industry just demands they take it with \ngrace and poise and they're fired if they don't. I think one other \ncontributing factor is the sheer amount of incredibly famous idols that \nexist. Justin Beiber is popular the world over and there's only about what, \n7 other really famous boy bands like that? Where as Kpop has far more, \nthere is more to focus and hone in on, not to mention many of them aren't \neven known outside of Korea. Basically, the asian specifically female fans \nare terrible more because of culture and the way kpop is handled, as \nopposed to simply being Asian, since Asian includes all other Asians, not \njust Koreans. I don't know if Japan, China, Vietnam and others have issues \nlike this with their idols.\n\nFor the record, I think a lot of closed off countries, like SK get a kind \nof attitude that foreigners are stupid unfortunately :( Not all of them of \ncourse, but clearly a large amount with in the kpop fandom.\nWe hate or fear what we're not apart of and don't understand. And that \nsucks.",

This is based off of my experiences and \nwhat I have seen. When that one guy who's name I've forgotten from Suju got \nmarried, the fans who were giving them hate mail were like 75% Asian. Yeah \nit's negative, but is it really racist? It's an assumption that has \nsomething to do with race, just because it's negative and involves race \ndoesn't mean it's racist. (BTW I hope I'm not sounding like a jerk or \nanything. I'm being sincere here and as a middle eastern Muslim I've felt \nracism directed towards me) In fact some Korean english speakers translated \nsome of the comments. I saw comments of people saying racist things towards \ninternational fans because most of the I ternation fans still supported him \nand they said stuff like \"They're too dumb to know what we're saying \nanyways\" there was also a fair amount of hate direction towards Saudi \nArabian ELFS I think? Don't know where that came from... but I think it \nwould be fair to say that most saesengs and other haters are Asian. Again, \nreally sorry if it sounds racist :/ Tbh with you though I have seen some \nwestern fans expressing hate over their relationships as well, but it's \nlike a once in a blue moon kind of thing.

Sure, there are those token \nartists who actually write their own music, but for the most part, Idols \nare money-machines for their companies. \n\nI\u2019m not going to explain it all here. For more solid figures on Idols\u2019 \nsalaries (which isn\u2019t much), you can just google it. This particular link \ntakes you to an article that tries to remain unbiased.

I had quit dancing, \nI had stopped singing and I was just having a really horrible time.  Kpop \nmade me remember that there ARE things fun in life.

I can't, to this day, think of a time before kpop that I was \nactually genuinely happy.  The music actually helped me. I have been around \nmusic my whole life, and I know how important it is to have music.  Since \nkpop helped me through the worst time in my life, I really want to make \nmusic and perform for people, and I hope that maybe, even if it's just one \nperson, that I can help someone realize that there's something happy in \nlife.  I have met such amazing people through kpop, and I can't imagine \nwhere I would be right now if I hadn't found the thing that finally made me \nhappy. I can't picture myself doing anything different.  I love singing. I \nlove dancing. I love performing. I love making people happy. It's hard \nbeing in the US and trying to do this, but if all goes as planned, I will \nbe in SK by the end of this year. I can almost fully understand Korean, and \nI can speak a good amount.  No matter what I hear about kpop and being an \nidol that may be negative, it won't ever change the fact that I seriously \ncan't imagine my life a different way and I really want to make people \nhappy and hopefully help at least one person to smile, just as kpop helped \nme.
