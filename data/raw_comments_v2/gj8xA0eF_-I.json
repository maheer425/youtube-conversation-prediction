One day the teacher introduce the new \ngirl in our class and straight away I thought she weird because of her bag \nafter the introduction she came over and sat next to me so I end up talking \nto her and she was really nice and we became best mates but then one day I \ngot suspend for fighting my seniors because they were so rude towards my \nteam but when I got back my new friend was being pick on by the whole \nschool all because she does not do sports so I snap at my classmates saying \nuse all had experience that they were victim of bullying as well this do \nnot solve anything then of course they will say I don't what it like to be \nbully because I am expert in marital arts which does not mean anything. I \nalso went off at my team and the ones younger and older than mean. Said to \neach of them what happen if she dies because of this and I said something \npersonally that I lost a lot friends from other school from bullying and I \ndo not want to lose another. So the next day they said sorry. But of course \nour seniors won't say sorry which me and her don't care but instead they \nend coming into our classroom and grab both of us by the shirt and push us \nagainst the wall and I said why are you like this what did we ever to you \nother in fact being real on how we feel or is that your scared then my \nsenior punch my friend and threw her to ground and I said to them let her \ngo or else I will snap u in half and I forgot she all so a judo expert so \nwas it got messing lol then I ask again why do this ? There nothing wrong \nbeing what you are or how crazy? Believe I use to be like you but I change. \nShe didn't say anything after that and just left in tears and everyone \nstarted clapping but I yelled at them saying there was nothing to be proud \nof hurting someone and I started to cry and said I am really no different \nfrom them my friend who got punch said u are different because u been there \nfor all of us. I took a few days off ever since, when I was shopping for \nbirthday gifts I saw my senior and she look so sad and i really can't \nbelieve I say hi to her and said u ok? Which deep down I want to beat her \nup again then she said sorry to me and she said to the others and I won't \ncome back to school and I said people talk, where u go it follows, but \nthere one thing you can is to seek help from outside of school because it \nreally serious what you did for all these years also don't hang out with \nthose people other wise I will you okay?. I never knew we will become \nfriends. Ever since my senior now goes around to school talks about how \nbullying can hurt a person, my other from actually decide to play soccer \nfor fun and now we be full of life hahaha \ufeff",

They are sometimes isolated for a reason (no I'm \nnot siding with the 'bullies'), either that person is annoying (comments on \neverything, by that I mean EVERYTHING, even the dumbest things), an a-hole \nback stabbing b**** who would brag, or no one really pays attention them \nsince they don't have any similarities. These examples are based from what \nI've observed or experienced. \n\nWhen we talk about bullying, everyone's the victim. Then who's the bully? \nBeing honest here, bullying is a tough topic. When you call someone names a \nfew times playfully without realizing it, you're labeled as a 'bully' or \nwhen you didn't invite someone because you are not close friends with them \nand you don't want them to interfere with your private matters (ex. \nbirthday party).\n\nMy friends and I don't really like this girl, she tries EXTREMELY HARD to \nfit in with us, but she have other 'friends' too. She can't keep her mouth \nshut about secrets, she steals stuff from us that she likes, shows off all \nthe time/bragging, seeks for attention when we are talking about an \nimportant topic, she uses you then throw you aside, and doesn't give \nanything up at all (she's always on the receiving side and EXPECTS you to \nshare with her). We DID give her several chances, but she just got cockier. \nDoes that makes us bullies? From an outsiders perspective, the answer \ndepends on you.\n\nEveryone probably have a wangdda phase. I passed through mine when I was \nyounger (ages 9-11), yes I was upset. But I changed my ways. I figured out \nwhat I was doing wrong, and attempted to fix that. I knew that I wasn't \nbeing true to myself and is sometimes annoying. After showing others who I \nactually am, some people doesn't like it while others likes me for being \ntrue.\n\nIn the end, it's really your opinion. I sound like a d*ck for saying all of \nthis, but it's based on my very small experiences (Currently, I've only \nbeen living for 13 1/2 years) You all know that in one point in your life, \nyou probably don't like a certain person very much. Sorry for the mean \nlanguage XD\ufeff",

After watching this \nvideo, I struggled to find out the reason why the bully acts like that and \nwhy this kind of accidents keep occured. In my opinion, It is all parents \nfault. Because many parents in Korea care only their children way to much, \ntheir children are also getting used to be given. So wrong way in the child \neducation made the children as antisocial personality disorder who can't \nnot understand others feeling. Educating their children strictly is the \nonly way to solve this bullying problem in South Korea.\n  \ufeff",

That bit about the ace student being a \nbully and the parents caring more about his reputation being protected than \nhim being a bully, that happens sooooooo often in China! And I know exactly \nthe mentality that went into that. It was *because* his grades are so good \nthat he is a bully. It was *because* he's a star student that his parents \nvigorously defend him from all outside criticism of any kind that doesn't \nhave to do with school work. It was *because* he's a star student that the \nprincipal of the school sided with his parents. Because having more ace \nstudents would make the school look good, and having one of your ace \nstudents being a bully makes the school looks bad. I don't know how bad it \nis in Korea, but it's a HUGE problem in China. I know of a boy who won some \nmath competitions, and then he's sooo protected by his parents and his \nschool, that he's now a totally unbearable, entitled and petty a$$hole.\ufeff",

If I had \nthat experience, I would be so afflicted at my school days when bullying \nproblems come out through news or this type of media. This problem is in \nthe news a lot more these days, and it is serious. \nTo students and teachers who have to face these situations, it is important \nto know how evil it is and how to handle it; however, I think they should \nrealize the importance of the problem from home education. Just like Simon \nsaid, there are so many ridiculous parents out there. \nI saw a picture in the past, and there are one boy with a big paper board \nand his mom watching him at the sidewalk in United States. The paper board \nsays \u201cShame on me for being a bully\u201d. The bully\u2019s mom was punishing him in \nthe way of feeling ashamed of his behavior.\nI read few comments that it could be harsh because he is still young, and \nhe doesn't have moral value yet. But I think\u2026 his mom did well. Because he \ndoesn't have moral value yet, he has to know what he did and how bad \nbullying was. I hope that home (which is the small society) can teach kids \nthink right, talk right, and act right! :)\ufeff",

To the point that koreans have the \nexpression \"they worshipped academic endeavors\"(\ubb38\uc744 \uc22d\uc0c1\ud558\ub2e4). There are many \nthird world countries out there in the similar situation korea was in 50 \nyears ago but not all of them put emphasis on education to cope with \npoverty.\n\nYes long ago the lowly people did not have access to education, certain \nclasses were forbidden to learn. However the nobles were expected and \nrequired to be always study endlessly in a very competitive \nenvironment/system. Now everyone has equal opportunity to learn everyone \nwants to be educated like the aristocrats back in the days.\n\nAlso both my parents are from traditionally well off families, esp. my \nmother's family. They were well off even during the war, but their families \nput high emphasis on education. So it's not just the way for poor to fight \ntheir way out of poverty. Generally I find richer families put more \nemphasis on education. Often poverty is passed down to generations because \nbeing poor, it's so easy to be short-sighted and to live life day-to-day \nbasis only. Also many uneducated do not understand the importance of \neducation. I think Korea was a special case where the majority of the \npeople were enlightened and eager to gain higher education.",
