Since I can't complain over \nthere I just clicked the first Colbert link from that page. \n\nSkipping my angry Anita comments for a sec, I'll ask a very simple question \nto start. Why, Colbert, are the comments disabled on the Anita video?\n\nFor as long as I can remember seeing your show, you've been a shining \nbeacon of humor and tongue-in-cheek political commentary. That video \nreminded me of Chris Rock's joke about Michael Jackson on 60 Minutes. \"He \ntried his hardest to make Michael look like a person...\" asking leading \nquestions to attempt to dignify his guest. You did the same, you gave every \nsolid question you could to lead Anita to giving an honest answer and \ntalking about an issue, but every time she just circled right around to \n\"But gamergate, and harassment, and people hate the womens!\"\n\nYour show has been a series of \"high points\", and that interview was the \nonly time I ever remember watching your show and being disappointed.\ufeff",
