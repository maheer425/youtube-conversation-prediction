Antimatter also has mass, and can be detected based on \ngravitation, but it happens to interact with conventional electromagnetic \nradiation as well, including light. But I suppose it is also theoretically \npossible that there is some other \"anti\" aspect to conventional matter and \nenergy, which is really what I was proposing in the first place--that \nenergy and anti-energy separated at the big bang, which was caused by \nwhatever caused it to occur in the first place.\n\nAnd yes, all theories are \"just theories,\" but having unsubstantiated \ntheories is not at all a bad place to be in, as long as you aren't \nsatisfied with them as truth enough--theories must be subject to scrutiny. \nAt the current moment, my idea is not supported by any evidence, so I'm not \neven claiming it as truth, only as one possible way to approach the \nquestion posed about the prevalence of matter.",

In the anti-universe \nthere is more anti-matter, white holes, the anti-photon and dark energy, \nand a deflating or collapsing universe. I picture the system as dual \nvortexes spinning in opposite directions. The anti-universe has a negative \nspin. ->=<+ The universe has a positive spin. I do not think anti-matter is \nmoving away from us. I think it is moving toward the opposite end of the \nBig Bang and being transformed into matter by the intense forces found at \nthe singularity. When our universe reaches max expansion and the Big Freeze \nour universe will transfer into the role of the anti universe and begin \ndeflating with a reverse spin as our anti universe then very small will \nexperience what we call the big bang and transition into an expanding \nuniverse with a positive spin. I call this concept Dual Vortex Theory. I \nwouldn't know how to test or prove it or illustrate it with physics or math \nthough.",

            "text": "+Tletna  Thank you, too ;) Yep, that is very true and the same concerns \nhave been raised in the scientific community in the past.\n\nHowever there are still some points in favor of an argumentation like that:\nThere is always Ockheim's razor. That means a simple explantion is always \nfavorable to a more complicated one. That is a very deep principle in \nlogic. Let's imagine you had some data from an experiment that can be \nexplained equally well by one model with only a few parameters and one with \na large amount of parameters. Choosing the the model with the additional \nparameters could means that you actually choose a model that is either \nunnecessarily complicated or, even worse, one that does not reflect the \nprocesses rather well, but compensates by having additional parameters to \ncorrect for that defect. And asking for different physics beyond the \nvisible universe to explain something that may be very well explainable \nthough the physics we use in here is always disfavoured unless experimental \nevidence clearly shows the simpler model is incorrect. It sounds very \ncomplicated, but this is the principle that distinguishes ideas like an \nelliptical orbit of the moon around the earth from ideas that say the moon \ndoes not exist when noone is looking at it.\nThere is also the point that you \"can also wash your dishes with dirty \nwater\". Meaning that you can always start at the point that everything is \njust as usual and see of it works out. If your initial assumption was \nincorrect, it'll be shown in the incorrectness of the predictions you make \nbecause of that. So you can actually test your assumptions.\nAdditionally, one can always speculate about everything. But in science a \nclaim without any evidence can be dismissed without any evidence. In this \ncase it would mean that unless you have any evidence that the physics \nbeyond our horizon are different to the one that seems to be exaclty the \nsame thoughout all of our horizon then there is no evidence in favor of a \nspeculation like that.",

There is definitely some rationale behind what \nyou're saying, but it is not logically sound.  We have no way of knowing \nwhat is beyond the observable horizon.  It is not actually safe to assume \nanything (nor is it unsafe).  And experiments do not clearly enough show \nsymmetry or lack thereof.  They show a tendency toward symmetry and do \ncosmological observations show a little consistency, but truthfully, we're \nfinding out new discoveries about space and physics every day.  So, I would \nhold off on making such grand assumptions, at least for now.  Just my \nopinion, but I think it is based upon more sound logic.",

            "text": "That are truely some excellent questions!  I'll try to give an answer.\n\nFor the first one: the universe, on a large scale, looks like it is \nisotropic and homogeneous (meaning it looks about the same in every \ndirection and from every point of view). So it looks like we are on no \nspecial place in the universe. Because of this, it is save to assume that \nthe universe beyond our horizon is similar to the stuff we observe inside \nof it. Additionally, one would have to come up with a process, that would \ncreate a preference for matter in our universe and, at the same time, a \npreference for matter somewhere else. So one would have to not only answer \nwhy we see more matter than antimatter here but also would have to test a \nprocess that only could be happening outside our cosmological horizon.\nOk, you might say: what if neither of these processes were taking place and \nmatter and antimatter just happened to sit at different places after the \nbeginning of the universe. The problem here is: if that simply way the \ncase, then the chances of finding a whole visible universe without any \nlarge amounts of antimatter are extremely small. One would expect at least \nsome areas filled with antimatter if the physics of today are a good \napproximation to what is going on in nature.\n\nFor the second one: the best way to explain the asymmetry of matter and \nantimatter is precisely that idea! In modern particle physics people are \nlooking for such a process that favours the creation of matter over the \ncreation of antimatter. But the search is very had, since it has been \ncalculated that a extremely tiny difference between how matter and \nantimatter interact would allow a universe full of matter.\n\nI hope that was a little helpful :)",
