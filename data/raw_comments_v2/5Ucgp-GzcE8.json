It can have the same \neffect on people as pepper spray does. Watery eyes, coughing, and even \ngagging. If accidentally shot in eyes, forget it. It burns so bad. Unlike \npepper spray, a skunks spray smell can linger for days and even weeks. A \nskunks spray actually smells like hot burnt rubber and rotten eggs together.\n\nRemoving the glands does no harm to the skunk. If they are someone's pet, \nthen they don't require their glands. Unlike say.. declawing a cat. Which \ncauses pain and suffering to the animal. So there you go. A pet skunk has \nno need for the glands and having them removed does no harm to the animal, \nand will make the bond between them and their owners stronger..
