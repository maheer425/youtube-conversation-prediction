In the book, she doesn't really show too much sadness after finding out \nher mother was dead. Either Humbert didn't want to admit to us that Lolita \nwas that heartbroken, or he refused to believe she felt anything except her \nlust for him. ",

He was constantly \npursuing Lolita and devoting his time and money to make her happy. But the \nfabulous gifts and fancy dinners didn't change the way the girl treated \nhim. Yeah i mean they did do some nasty things together, but that was \nsuperficial. She was never romanticaly attached towards him the way he was \ndriven to her. It really is a story about unshared love. Even though \nHumbert wasn't exactly the most decent man, he really cherished this girl \nand wanted her well-being. His love for her was so destructive that \nbreaking the law (both constitutional and moral) didnt pose a threat to \nhim. On the other hand i think that Lolitta was quite sinister. She \nprobably knew what was going in his heart and mind and promptly took \nadvantage of that. She basically pushed him into buying her all kinds of \nstuff and she knew that he would not refuse because he was afraid that she \nmight get offended  and  run away from him. So i find one more theme here. \nAnd that is that some girls use their irresistible looks to trick guys into \nspending money on them. Some guys treat women like royals.\nBut as we witness these girls don't love these man back.  They just keep \nthe relationship going with the purpose of fulfiling their needs and once \nthat is over they loose interest.\n Sorry if i made mistakes (This is not my native language) but i wanted to \nshare my thoughts on the book.

She has absolutely no one else. \nShe's a child whose father is long-dead, whose dead mother absolutely \nloathed her, has no experience of the world, no way to earn money, and is \nin Humbert's charge. She is totally at his mercy. He loved her in a sick \nway, and Lolita may have initially been infatuated with this older, worldly \nman, but she wants nothing to do with him sexually, and despises him by the \nend. She tries to hide from him in order to avoid having sex with him at \ntimes. If it had been about money, she would have gone with him in the end \nwhen he says he'll take her \"swollen with another man's child,\" instead of \nliving in abject poverty. This is a cleverly, brilliantly crafted tale by a \nman wanting to sway an audience (the \"jurors\" he mentions often) in his \nfavor. He desperately wants his story to be a tragic love-story where he \nends up the victim. He wants us to believe it, and he wants to believe it \nhimself. If he were to break it down into its parts, the story looks pretty \nabominable: he marries a woman because he wants to have sex with her child; \nafter Mother dies, he's ecstatic because he can do the darkest of deeds \nwith his now-daughter without any interruptions; he rapes her again and \nagain until she finally finds a way out; he hunts her down and tries to \nreclaim her; finally, he murders his daughter's lover, not because he finds \nQuilty's actions deplorable, but because he sees Quilty as competition. \nNabokov's ability to make us \"feel\" for Humbert is the true genius of this \nnovel.
