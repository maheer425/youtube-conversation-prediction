            "text": "I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEBODY ! ....\n\nGermany is a paradim to show, why MMP is horrible, too. :( Because there \nare so many more aspects, which matter. I can only name a few examples here:\n\nThere are 2 big parties and 3-4 smaller parties currently in the federal \nand state parliaments in Germany. That seems to be good and more \nrepresentative. Here is the reality: The big parties (CDU - conservatives \nand SPD - liberals on paper, not really) block one smaller party completely \ncalled the \"the leftists\". So Leftists have never any chance to have any \npower in any important decision. They get just ignored. The big parties \nprefer to pick each a junior partner close to their political agenda for a \ngovernment coalition. In the past it was either CDU + FPD (some sort of \nsoft Liberterians) or lesser times SPD + Greens. The junior partner gets \nalways screwed horribly by his big partner, has to compromise a lot and has \nto abandon his principles. So last election FPD didnt make it in the \nparliament, because everybody saw, they have no own program, they just want \nto be the junior partner of the CDU to get the money for gov. jobs. However \nCDU hates Greenies, so they formed a so called \"Great coalition\" with the \nSPD.\n\nThis is a nightmare on many levels.  They have together 80 % of all seats \nin the German parliament. They can change the constitution, whenever they \nwanted (75 % needed). The opposition has only less than 20 % (Green and \nleftists) can not even do all opposition work, i.e. if they wanted to start \na parliamentary commission to investigate something, they needed 25 %.\n\nAnother nightmare is the list. A candidate can lose in his constituency \nhorribly bad. If he is on top of the list, it does not matter and he comes \nin the parliament anyways via the list. Even Greens, who fuck up, go to \nparliament via the list, if their party gets over the 5 % barrier. This \nmakes it impossible to punish certain politicians. For example Frank Walter \nSteinmeier (SPD) lost as Chancellor candidate vs Angela Merkel (CDU) with a \nrecord low for his party of 23 % in 2009. He still came in the parliament \nvia the list. Now in the great coalition he is in the government again and \nminister of foreign affairs. Some polls say, he might have a chance as \nchancellor candidate against Angela Merkel, because there is no better \ncandidate in the SPD. WAIT WHAT? Yea, really. There is another guy, \nWolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, minister of finance. He is since almost 50 (!) years in \nthe parliament and most Germans, most of the world, hate him. But he is in \nthe CDU and they always win or make it in the parliament. He is always on \ntop of that list. Many politicians in SPD and CDU are professional \npoliticians, who lost votes, but it did not matter, the list saved them.\n\nThere was a couple years ago a poll: 70 % hated the goverment of the CDU. \nBut at the same time, the same 70 % said they like Angela Merkel (CDU), the \nchancellor of that same goverment. At this point - it is over. Propaganda \nwon.\n\nIn the last years, some new parties were founded, AfD and Pirates in \nparticular. But the CDU has appr. 100,000 party members everywhere in the \nexecutive, judicative and legislative and they controll the media. The SPD \nis simular. They have many times more money than these newcomers, are state \nfinanced and they get the most private donations by corporations. So the \nnewcomers just get trashed by media and PR campaignes. The pirates are \ndone, never had a chance. They cant do anything about it - unless they get \nbacked by big private doners like AfD. Americans know, where this leads to \nthen. It is not as bad as in the USA, but in Germany almost EVERY \npoliticians is corrupt. The next problem is called \"coalition discipline\". \nIf a member of say the CDU in the parliament does not do, what the bosses \nwant (Bosses are i.e. Angela Merkel or Sch\u00e4uble) - he will get no more \nmoney from the CDU for his next election campaigne, infact he will be \ndeleted from the list. End of his carrier in the party and end of his \npolitical carrier in almost 100% of all cases. This violates the \nconstitution, because a member of parliament should decide by his own will \nand conscience on what bill he wants to vote for and which not. The bosses \nof these parties dont care. They also violate the constitution by illegal \nuse of donations or they use their stuff for election campaignes etc.\n\nGerrymandering still happens in Germany, too. It has nothing to do with the \nvoting system. The CDU did it. The SPD also. Fortunately not as bad as in \nUSA. It is basically a 2 party system - for 70 years the same 2, since the \nbeginnig of the FRG after WWII - with some small dots around, who are too \nweak to matter in any big way. And it will stay this 2 party system, \nbecause these 2 are too powerful - unless some catastrophy like a financial \ncollapse from abroad washs them way. But even then. If they lost both in \none election on the federal level. They still can block everything for \nyears in the federal assembly with their state governments.\n\nSo this system is designed to remain this way with these 2 parties on top \nforever until it falls.\n\nps: I know, there is no real democracy in the world. Because there is one \nmore problem: if the constituency is too big, it becomes impossible to \nrepresent all interests. For example Germany is since more than 10 years \nwith soldiers in Afghanistan. 70 % of the voters do not want them there, \nbut on election day, they can not punish this, because they think, they \nhave to vote for which party is best for their wallets. Sad but reality. \nThe politicians know this and abuse it. Also democracy in Ancient Greece \nwas a completely different society system than in most democracies today. \nSwiss and Island are maybe closest to the democratic ideal - one of the \nreasons is, because they are small countries and politicians did not lose \ntouch to their constituency as it happens in imperial \"democracies\" like \nthe USA or EU.\ufeff",

A threshold of 5% also helps keep the number \nof parties down in our system, as they have to win an electorate (usually \nby makign a deal with a major party) or get 1 in 20 people to support them. \n\nAn example of how that has worked is the long legacy of socially \nconservative and christian parties in NZ.
