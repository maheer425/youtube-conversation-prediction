And of course this means the unhealthy effects of \nsitting is completely overated and overshadowed by the healthy effects of \nbetter living standards, foods, better medicine, science etc. To sum it all \nup, SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET PEOPLE SIT because they obviously have to, \ntheir jobs requires that. Start pending more time and resources trying to \ncure aging (like Google and SENS) instead. Trust me that would be much more \nproductive and have a much greater effect on the health of humanity instead \nof bitching about people sitting too much.
