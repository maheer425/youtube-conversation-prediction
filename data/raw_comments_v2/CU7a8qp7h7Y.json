Yes \nshe spend less than a year but then she spent 2 months in max with time in \nsolitary. I don't blame society because I think her story is worth telling. \nAll their stories are worth telling. The more we listen the more accepting \nwe can be and the more we can learn. The more we judge and tell society not \nto listen, the harder it will be to listen to others' stories. Other \nstories about falsely accused men have been made into films and featured in \ntv shows like The Good Wife. Maybe they should do what she's done. People \nwill listen. I've worked in publicity, and I'm an actor & currently work at \na news tv station. A good story is a good story. They could if they wanted \ndo. Maybe some just don't want to remember. I have a relative who spent 18 \nmonths in a federal men's prison for a crime he did not commit. It's not a \npicnic. He doesn't talk about it, didn't want anyone visiting him or \nsending letters, his wife filed for divorce while he was in, he has 3 \ndegrees that do him no good as a felon, and he got disbarred from \npracticing law. He's putting his life back together, is dating someone, got \na job driving medical supplies for a hospital, and is now in nursing \nschool.

You don't have the right to judge her. She's doing some good work for \nthe prison system. It's good that a former prisoner is now on the Women's \nPrison Association board. She's speaking specifically on non-violent \ncriminals in the system that shouldn't be there, something she knows about. \nAre you actually dissing the fact that she didn't go back to jail or commit \na worse crime? That should be commended that she didn't get dragged back \ninto a life of crime like so many do. Plus what does being white have to do \nwith anything? I'm gonna quote Morgan Freeman on this one. If you want \nracial discrimination to go away \"Stop talking about it.\" She was 23 when \nshe committed a stupid crime.

That is \nscary because the power of the almighty dollar is now really making money \noff people incarcerated in these privatized for profit prisons. Just about \nanything is a crime these days.She may be a total wasp and even a \nnarcissist, but what she is saying is true. While I have never been in \nprison.\n\nI have been locked up in the county jail and they would put four of us \ncrammed into a small 8 by 10 cell, two on the bunks and two on the floors. \nI was stuck on a paper thin mattress on the floor and the place was \ninfested with red ants, got all kinds of ant bites on my arms and shit. An \nwe would spend most of the time locked in our small cells crammed together \nlike canned sardines.\n\nThey would let us run out of toilet paper and we'd have to resort to using \nnews paper and magazines to wipe with, they did that shit to us a lot. I'm \npoor and white, I live in a trailer, so I guess you can call me trailer \ntrash, but really my trailer is not trashy, whatever. Anyway. I hate to \nthink of just how much worse the prisons are when I I have already done \ntime in jail more than once already. I know how fucked up it is in there.\n\nIn prison I know it's much much worse. I am not here to debate that with \nanyone who has had to do hard time. But I fear my government and feel like \nwe are just plain losing a lot of our freedooms as it is, an with \nprivatized for profit prisons where everything is about the bottom line for \na handful of corrupt people yes that is scary. I don't know what it's going \nto take to wake people up. I'm at least glad this woman is speaking about \nwhat goes on in our prisons and how some things need to be changed.\ufeff",

Was her \ndrug related smuggling crime considered a federal offense?  Is that why she \nwas in an actual prison or is she exaggerating her stay in a local jail?\n\nWith all that said, I did enjoy her story as told by the very entertaining, \nwell written, directed & acted program:  \"Orange Is The New Black\". \n Although thoroughly embellished, fictionalized & dramatized for \ntelevision, it was an excellent show.
