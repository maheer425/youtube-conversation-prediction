So I looked on a pyrotehnic forum and I found out how to make the \nslow-burning fuse faster, better, easier and safer to make (and even \nwithout cooking!). And this one really works !!!\n  First, mix 60% of potassium nitrate and 40% of sugar. Then stir well and \ntook a large piece of alu-foil. Cut the alu-foil into 3cm x 10cm rectangles \n(or more/less, as you wish). Then, just take the spoon and sprinkle the \nmixture evenly along the rectangle. Then roll the rectangle so your mixture \ncan't go out and make a fuse shape. Then, fold the both edges, so the \nmixture won't go out.\n  Then, put your fuse around 2 or more centimeters deep into a thing you \nwant to burn with a fuse and cut off the edge where you wish to burn the \nfuse (when you cut it off, you have to see your mixture inside). Then, just \nuse the lighter on this edge and wait until the fuse burns.\nGOOD LUCK AND I HOPE THAT YOU FIND THIS AS USEFUL !!!\ufeff",
