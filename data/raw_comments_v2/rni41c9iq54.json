Because they do not use \nmany of empirical method used in science. Psychology took over the place of \nknowledge where once philosophy and theology presided.Things that were used \nto describe the inner state of humanity like the mind, the seat of our \nidentity.People theories like Freud, Jung even Kinsey have been revised and \nparts debunk.There perhaps is less consensus as to methodology among \npractitioners today. It is possible to say they are less authoriatative as \nthey once were.Medicine is though to be a better approach to fixing \nproblems because is more prescriptive,the tests can be repeated among \ndifferent patients. However like you say it does dealing  with the \ncomplexity of memory and imagination and the problems that thoughts and \nfeelings about the present and past, affect our health. The therapeutic \npractice has grown out of a response to the vissititudes of modern day, \nwhere there is greater complexity in life and the traditional community \nwhere people had meaning and identity within the collective, has \ngone.Making it a science where you could study things and professionalised \nthe practice has been trend of occupations under modernity.\ufeff",

It sucks to know there's nothing you can do \nto change the cause of the pain.

Failure as well. \n* Break bad psychological habits. Interrupt negative pattern, e.g. circular \nthinking, obsession, rumination.... Take action. Shift your behavior.
