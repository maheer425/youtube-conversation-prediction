            "text": "Well do i have the thing for you!\n\nFire! It warms us, mystifies us, delights us, and sometimes terrifies us. \nOne thing\u2019s for sure: it would be hard to imagine a life without fire.\n\nOn cold nights, fires keep us warm and help us to survive. Without fire, it \nwould be impossible to cook the foods we love to eat. Sitting around a \ncampfire can be one of the most pleasurable experiences in life, but if \nthat fire sparks and catches a house on fire, lives and entire existences \ncan be lost.\n\nFire is one of the most important forces in our world. It has played an \nimportant role throughout all of human history. But exactly who invented \nit? How was fire discovered? According to the Greek mythology, Prometheus \nstole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Scientists believe humans \nand their ancestors had fire long before Prometheus, however.\n\nThe chemical reaction of oxygen and a fuel source we know as fire has been \naround as long as oxygen and sources of fuel have been around. In other \nwords, fire has been around for millions of years.\n\nIt\u2019s a natural reaction that didn\u2019t need to be invented. The earliest \ncreatures that predated human beings were probably well aware of fire. When \nlightning would strike a forest and create a fire, it probably intrigued \nand amazed them.\n\nExactly who first learned to create and control fire? And when did that \nhappen? These are questions that have no definite answers. In fact, they\u2019re \nsome of the most asked questions that scientists still study today and hope \nto answer definitively one day.\n\nObviously, matches and lighters didn\u2019t exist millions of years ago. \nHowever, it\u2019s certainly possible that early pre-human ancestors obtained \nfire naturally and kept it burning to use for various purposes, such as \ncooking and heating.\n\nOver time, these pre-humans may have also learned how to make primitive \nfires using sticks and flint. Learning to make and control fire was most \nlikely one of the earliest discoveries made by pre-humans that walked \nupright on two legs.\n\nToday, many scientists believe that the controlled use of fire was likely \nfirst achieved by an ancient human ancestor known as Homo erectus during \nthe Early Stone Age. Archeologists have uncovered evidence of what they \nbelieve to be the controlled use of fire in Wonderwerk Cave in South \nAfrica, as well as the Lake Turkana region of Kenya.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s impossible to know exactly who used fire in these areas or \nhow they used it, experts believe these sites show that the early ancestors \nof human beings controlled fire well over a million years ago. Evidence at \nsome of the sites indicates that the use of fire could date back almost two \nmillion years.\n\nIn addition to helping ancient ancestors stay warm and keep predators away, \ncontrolling fire allowed them to begin to cook meats and vegetables. \nHarvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham has suggested that cooked food \nallowed for greater brain development and evolution, transforming our \nancestors over millions of years into the human beings we are today.",
