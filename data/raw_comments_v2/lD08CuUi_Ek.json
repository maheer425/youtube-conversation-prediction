            "text": "Ok\n\nMy name is Maria. I traveled so far away from home, whatever home is, and, \nsomehow, survived more than hundreds of years, which makes me wonder. Why \ndo I still look young? Well, I'm afraid my life is about to end. I feel \nmyself getting closer to the black hole. There's no going back. I wanted my \nlast thoughts to be of home, but I lost my memory years ago. But, who is \nthis lady I saw? Was it a memory? Somehow, I feel like my memories are \nreturning. Now I see a man. Who is he? It took me time to figure it out, \nbut now I know who they both are. My mother and father. I have a mother and \nfather? I can even remember home right now, and my life as a child before \ngetting taken away, and losing my memory. What else happened to me? I can't \nremember. I began to cry a little, and since it was so cold the tears \nturned into ice. My face started to freeze. I was still getting closer to \nthe black hole. I'm surprised I even made in this far on a human space \nship. Well, my life was over a long time ago. I'm not a human, and maybe I \nshould die. Or maybe I shouldn't. I'm still going to die. Well, I'm not \nscared at all anymore. I don't even know what will happen. Only a few \nminutes left. Well, at least I was happy once. Now, I even got to see the \nstars, and ride in a spaceship. Thinking about it just makes my feel happy. \nIt was a bit hard for me to move, but I curled up into a ball with my back \nfacing the black hole. Then, I ask myself, \"what's going to happen?\". Soon, \nit finally happened. I felt a lot of pain. My last words were \"What's going \nto happen?\", and my last thoughts were of home. Right as I had 1 minute \nleft before it happened, I waved good bye to the world.\n\nSorry, it isn't exactly a story about a black hole, but a story about a \nperson dying in a black hole\ufeff",

They could be afraid of us. - They might be threatened by the fact we \nare quite the war machines, we have killed plenty of people as a result of \nwar.\n4. They could be at the same level or lower on technology - this is \nunlikely, but possible, they might be where we are trying to find out how \nto reach other planets.\n5. they might be planning an invasion - This could be possible, us being \ngreedy tyrants maybe they are like us just waiting until we think alien \ninvasion is impossible then they'll attack when we aren't expecting it.\n6. or we could be unique - yes this is possible, I doubt there is no life \nother than us, but us being the smartest beings could be possible.\n7. or they could simply not exist - also very possible, in this case it's a \ngood thing, it's a sign literally saying \"being civilization to other \nplanets!\" because there are billions of planets that are at least habitable \nif we terraform them.
