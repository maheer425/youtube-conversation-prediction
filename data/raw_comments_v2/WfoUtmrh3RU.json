            "text": "Well, it's ironic HK wasn't any democratic state up until early nineties, \nand even then the democracy was sort of introduced to the people of HK as a \nnecessity to somehow keep an important financial hub untouched by communism \n(or whatever China claims to be). People in fact responded very lazily and \nnot without suspicion to the first Legco elections. The voting activity was \nrather low. However if John Major wouldn't take a stronger line for \ndemocracy in HK at around 1992 (i think?..) we could see another Hong Kong \nnow, and well we love it as it is, so thanx to Britain for at least some \nkind of action before 1997. It's a fact that democracy of Hong Kong SAR is \nto some degree artificial, and it's civil society is very young to say the \nleast (the history of rallies/protest is not what makes the society of HK \n\"civil\", but the current situation is of course possible because this \nhistory). But the new generation has basically shown that there is indeed \ncivil society and it will stand for it's rights, essentially trying to say \n\"don't touch our new way of life\". This whole problem is a time bomb. Pity \nHong Kong never had a chance to become like Singapore, historically there \nwas some probability of this. At some point either China will displace this \ndemocracy of Hong Kong or it will itself become a democratic state with \ncivil society. They don't take a violent action just because the city is \nextremely important to the world's economy, being a third important \nfinancial hub after New York and London. Same reason China agreed on many \ncompromises before 1997. Summarizing, i think HKers should keep up the good \nwork and non-violent protests for as long as it's needed until China will \nitself look more like a civil society, and hopefully gradually they will \ndevelop some kind of social democracy or whatever. Maybe by 2046, judging \nby their speed of evolving from communist to capitalist state both by \neconomics and mentality.\ufeff",

However, \nalthough there is inequality and big corporation interests and so on and so \nforth in the West, governments in the West do not censor dissents (although \nsometimes they do and there is limits to free speech, but in China no \ndissent is allowed). The problem in China is that the government think ONLY \nTHEY ARE RIGHT, ONLY THEY HOLD THE TRUTH. So when you talk about democracy? \nTo them, what democracy? There is no need for democracy. And of course the \nhigh ranking officials eschew democracy so they could keep exploiting \npeople.\n\nBut what is really tragic is that the general public also think like this. \nThe Chinese are much less tolerant of different opinions than westerners (I \nsay this basing on my own experience). They above all do not think China is \nready for democracy, for the so called reason that \"without a strong \none-party government, China is going to fall apart.\" But this argument is \ncompletely groundless. Also, the big problem is not that China has a \none-party system (though the one-party system is a cause of many problems), \nbut that the government (and sometimes the people as well) do not value \ndifferent opinions and human lives.\n\nI feel like I am going off tangent here, but the bottomline is problems in \nChina are very complicated. And real change will not come until the public \nUNIFORMLY (intellectual unity is very important to any regime change) \ndemand change and democracy, which will not happen anytime soon.\ufeff",

But I think for me, this \nvideo only shows how little you understand about China. Some may say you \nhave caught the point of the problem but trust me, you really have not. I \ncan see your passion for freedom and democracy, and your support for the \npeople in Hong Kong, to whom goes also my very own support. However in all \nthese China-explaining videoes I've seen, there is one major problem, which \nalso lies in this one: Ignoring the rest 1.2+ billion ordinary Chinese \npeople and their thoughts and feelings as individuals. I can imagine whom \nyou have talked to and what information you have got from them, but trust \nme again, they do not represent the majority. I am not saying I speak for \nthe majority, but try to understand the country( and all the other \ncountries) in plural ways. I know you are trying your best, but I'll say \nnot for this video. It is true that it is hard to hear the opinions of the \nrest of the people who are whether silent or 'silenced', However if you \ndon't get to know the thoughts of the vast population, you cannot really \nunderstand what is going on. So it is really kind of a mission impossible. \nThings are much more complicated in China than you think. It seems that \npeople only cares about protesters in HK and politicians in Beijings, but \nwhat about all the other people in cities and towns you may never heard of? \nThe point is that I wonder where you got the confidence from, or maybe this \nlevel of understanding is enough for most of the people outside China. So \nknow more, think more before you explain some other places to people. It is \nan old video I know, I hope you are doing a much better job now. I really \nappreciate what you are doing. Good luck!\ufeff",

I suppose \"Mainlanders get out of here because we look \ndown on you\" is not a very internationally news worth title.\nNot too be too dramatic, but the situation in Hong Kong is like what in \nGerman at the beginning of WWII (well at least kinda). When facing a \nslowing economy, large unemployment and weak, ineffective governing body, \npeople generally tend to blame others who are different. In this case, Hong \nKong choose the Mainland, because, well, \"we are struggling and you are \nstill throwing money away like nothing, and we have been looking down on \nyou forever and now you seem to be doing better than us?! Unacceptable!!\" \nSound familiar? Blame every Mainlander (Jew) because their presence ruined \nHong Kong (Germany).\nAt one side, the protesters do have their merits for pursuing democracy. \nThe existing governing structure is not effective and does not seem to \nimprove their living standard. On the other hand, Hong Kong wanting to \neliminate all Mainland influence is a bit overkill. Traditional consumerism \ndoes show a strong demand is good for everyone (at least in the long run). \nWith out strong demand from mainland china, how can Hong Kong maintain \ntheir growth and economy?\nP.S.

Yes, our blood belongs to \nChinese, but after WW and the experience of reform, some Chinese realized \nthat China has had terrible totalitarianism and then tried to move to Hong \nKong to get rid of terrible freedom and human right. What I try to mean is \nthat, there must be Chinese, whether they were living in the history or the \nare living in the new generation, they wanted or want to get away from \nChina. In the past, they moved to Hong Kong. Nowadays, you can see Chinese \nare everywhere, in the US, UK and Canada. Over the years, there still are \nChinese who want to get away from China. Then you can learn why China is \nterrible. \n\nWe feel sorry if residents in UK, US and Canada are affected by Chinese but \nwe have no choice. Chinese people do judge Chinese who behave in bad, I \ncannot be excepted tho bc most of them are seriously bad and damaging. \n\nWhat I am looking for is that Chinese who move to somewhere else could \nbehave good and dun be rude to stop further damaging our reputation of \nChinese nation, so we still have a chance to immigrate until all around the \nworld may ban Chinese to immigrate\ufeff",
