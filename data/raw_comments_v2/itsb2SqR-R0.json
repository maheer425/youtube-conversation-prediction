            "text": "I loved Pokemon Emerald.\n\nI once had the fortune of capturing a Wailmer in Sootopolis and named her \nOprah. I trained it and once she hit level 40, she evolved into a Wailord. \nI taught her Surf and used her to beat the crap out of Tate and Liza's \nSolrock and Lunatone. I was like \"well cool\" and I had no idea what to do \nnext. My travels took me all over Hoenn, and I eventually found myself on \nthe outskirts of Rustboro. While I was running around, rematching trainers \nand whatnot, I ran into a Skitty. Having never caught a Skitty before, I \ndecided to catch him, and I did, and I named him Levin. Then I placed them \nboth into the day care and ran around. Oprah the Wailord I put inside \nbecause I wanted to give her a few levels, Levin I placed inside because I \nwas like \"what the hell, you can put two in anyway, I'll give him a few \nmore levels I suppose.\"\n\nI ran around nonstop for an hour and I came back. The old man outside told \nme that Oprah had laid an egg, and that she and Levin were getting along \nquite well. Mortified, I had no choice but to take it. After declaring \nignorance about their trysts, he watched as I ran outside, onto the \nVerdanturf road. Mortified, I had no choice but to take it. I wandered \naround, having no idea what to do with this information. Unlike the \nblissfully unaware old man, I knew what had happened. I knew what went on \nbetween Levin and Oprah.\n\nSuddenly, as I was zooming along on my Mach Bike on the eastern side of \nMauville, my game froze. I let out a quick curse. The damn thing's cut out \nagain, I thought. But then the screen went black. A green halo appeared in \nthe center. On it was their egg, the seed of their union. I had no idea \nwhat to expect. What would it be? Some horrible hybrid of feline and \ncetacean? One crack appeared. Then two. Then more. Then out of the egg \nemerged a Wailmer, so pure and so vulnerable, its childlike cry devoid of \nany reserve or discretion. Uncontrollable tears flowed from my eyes as I \nrealized that Levin and Oprah were now bound together by a force I had \nnever, and will never, fully understand. Hands trembling, I deposited the \nfruit of their love in the PC, went back to the Day Care and received yet \nanother egg. And I finally understood that, even though I will never \nunderstand what happened, something infinitely wonderful and magical, \nsomething that I had the duty to protect forever. \n\nThus ends my tale. The tale of two unlikely lovers: Levin the Skitty, and \nOprah the Wailord. In my mind, I can still see their first child, burbling \nand laughing with their parents. Then the scene cuts out to those fateful \nencounters, my first meeting with Levin, my first with Oprah, then to the \none I did not have the fortune of seeing, that when Levin and Oprah first \nset eyes with each other. Did they know the wonderful things that would \ntake place within the gates of that old house just outside Mauville? Or did \nthey gradually learn their fate, step by step, just as one learns to walk? \nMy questions are cut short by one last image, that of Levin and Oprah, her \nample body resting on the grass, Levin standing over her, squirting load \nafter load of his white Skitty cum all over that Wailord's round belly. \n\nI love Pokemon Emerald.\ufeff",

            "text": "Have you ever wondered why the DNA contains thymine, while the RNA contains \nuracil? Here's an interesting fact. A spontaneous process called \ndeamination (replacement of amino fuctional groups with keto groups) is \nfairly common in both DNA and RNA. As it happens, the product of \ndeamination of cytosine is uracyl, and it is the most common of deamination \nprocesses affecting the DNA. The product of cytosine deamination (uracil) \nis readily recognized as foreign in DNA and is removed by a repair system. \nIf DNA normally contained uracil, recognition of uracils resulting from \ndeamination of cytosine would be more difficult and that would in the long \nrun lead to a decrease in GC base pairs and an increase in AU base pairs in \nthe DNA of all cells. Establishing thymine as one of the four bases in DNA \nmay have been one of the crucial turning points in evolution, making the \nlong-term storage of genetic information possible. (Source: Lehninger \nPrinciples of Biochemistry)\n\nAlso, we commonly speak about introns as the junk which gets spliced \nleaving the ''important'' stuff for translation. Why do organisms have \nintrons at all? It has been shown that introns are responsible for boosting \nexpression levels of proteins up to 400(!) times (parts of DNA coding for \nintrons include regulatory elements involved in transcription), they \ncontribute to DNA packaging (chromatin formation), control the delay \nbetween gene activation and appearence of its protein product (which is \nespecially important in developmental processes) and are responsible for \nalternative splicing. This latter process is extremely important because it \nallows one gene to produce multiple proteins, thereby increasing complexity \nof organisms without the need for occurrence of thousands of new genes. \nAlso, many non-coding RNAs are actually products of spliced introns, such \nas miRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA, siRNA...
