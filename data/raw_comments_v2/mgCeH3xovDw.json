Substantively, I found out last weekend that the creator of +House of \nCards was a playwright, which really explains some of the unique creative \nchoices, Shakespearean language, and stylistic and narrative technique to \nhave Underwood break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience. It \ndoesn't hurt that the creator's college buddy and current Political \nconsultant is an actual major political operative either. Without spoiling \nit for new viewers, knowing what campaigns they worked on (especially the \nHoward Dean campaign) explains *a lot* about the show's commentary on \nidealism versus realpolitik in the public sector, why Underwood has his \nspecific party affiliation, and even the use of/commentary on digital media \n(which seemed rather dated and off to me) and the journalistic storylines \nand characters within the series. There's so much rich ground to explore \nwith this series, whatever your opinion of the protagonist. (Generally, I \nrespect the creative potency of the series, but am wary of Beltway folks \nthat lionize someone so ethically bankrupt). I'd really be interested in \nhearing what people thought of Frank -- having fully been (d)evolved into \nPolitics Personified -- systematically alienated everyone in his circle who \nwas long-term invested in his enterprise: Jackie, Remy, and finally (in \napparently the final straw of a season-long process) even his staunchest \nadvocate, Claire.\n\n It goes beyond just the usual arrogance and blithely throwing these people \nunder the bus - you saw the wheels turning behind their eyes in each of \ntheir final stand-offs with Frank, in such a way that there was a lot of \nsymmetry there between the disintegration of his core relationships with \nthe longtime associate/subordinate (Remy), the political protege/mentee of \nsorts (Jackie), and of course his rock, the other side of his coin, \nride-or-die Claire. It seems in House of Cards, like Washington in the \nflesh -- it's when the most loyal of a leader's folks just stop talking to \nthe 'Emperor' and no longer bother to air their concerns candidly, that he \nshould seriously worry.\n\n What's interesting is that someone who orchestrated the artificial \ndissolution of so many loyalties in seasons past (using essentially what \namounts to emotional manipulation on a basic 'high school' level - slowly \nsowing discontent, suspicion, distrust, fear, and among key \nallies/friendships and advisers...who never bothered to *communicate* with \neach other candidly enough to figure out who was the common rotten \ndenominator) -- well, Frank himself, just didn't see any of it coming with \nhis strongest trifecta of supporters willfully extricating themselves from \nhis fight. \ufeff",

Also, around the mid \n1700's is when factories sprung up all over the country employing vast \namounts of lower class people who were managed by the upper class in close \nproximity. That's when lower class speakers started to rise up through the \nranks into management alongside their upper-class peers and be respected. \nJust saying, it didn't start with the posh, or upper class. It started with \nthe lower class. I've always noticed that Cockney almost doesn't exist on \nthe radar in the USA when it was one of the most influential cultures, \nespecially of speech, in the world. Also, many authors made the language of \nworking class London interesting and cool to upper class readers.\n\nYou can listen to an accent from the 1700's on youtube. The closest to one \nthat's in existence today. This accent would have been similar to a South \nEast English, lower class Cockney accent, but still very different. You can \nwork out the differences by listening to a modern accent from that region \ntoday, and then listening to a Cockney accent from London today.

Remember that as an \nactor you take literary license when portraying a character. If we were \ntalking about a run-of-the-mill Hollywood actor then I'd perhaps agree that \nthe dialectal portrayal is based on ignorance, but Spacey is a highly \naccomplished theater actor (he's been the artistic director of The Old Vic \nin London for over a decade) as well as a Hollywood actor.
