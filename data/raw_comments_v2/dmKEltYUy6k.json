The entire story still takes place in a jungle and Marlon Brando's \ncharacter is named Kurtz after the antagonist of the book, and his last \nspoke words, \"The horror. The horror.\" are retained. Even the \"The Making \nof...\" documentary is called Hearts of Darkness: A Filmaker's Apocalypse.\n\nThere was even a Heart of Darkness TV movie that came out in 1993 (two \nyears after the docu Hearts of Darkness) that stars Tim Roth and John \nMalkovich. I'm guessing it's suppose to be a closer adaptation of the book \nitself, but I still prefer Apocalypse Now.",

Kurtz has the \ntemptation and lust for power, Marlowe doesn't, but I guess each reader \ntakes what he chooses to from the story.\nI personally like this book because it doesn't shy away from the \"evil\" of \nmankind, it confronts it, and tries to bring it to light; at least that's \nhow I took it. And I think that although the story singles out the evil \namong European imperialists of the day, the outlook can be applied to any \nempire or kingdom in history.",
