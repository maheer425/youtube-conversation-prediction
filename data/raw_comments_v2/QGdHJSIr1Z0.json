This protein is \nthe protein that has oxygen binds to for transport throughout the body. \nNaturally, hemoglobin is dark red when deoxygenated and bright red when \noxygenated. \n2. Depends massively on skin color, genetics, etc. Very hard to find a \naverage amount.\n3. Sunlight reflects off of the Moon and back to us. The position of the \nMoon in its orbit decides how what \"shape\" it is. You can look into this \nfurther if you want to.\n4. Yes. With the massive amounts of matter and energy in the universe, \nthere are bound to be other planets that are considered \"earth-like.\" \nScientists have found none yet, but we are getting close and there is still \nmuch of space to explore.\n5. Chemicals. Lots of them. Need I explain more? (Use Google for exact \nchemicals if you are really interested.)\n6. The Big Bang, by far. The Big Bang was about 14 Billion years ago. \nComparatively, the Bible is much younger (after all, there had to be a \nuniverse for the Bible to exist in anyway.)\n\nThat was all of your questions answered.
