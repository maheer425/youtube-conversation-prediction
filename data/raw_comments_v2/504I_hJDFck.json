Koenigsegg is my \nfavorite car.. hopefully one of these days before I'm either dead, or too \nold to enjoy it, I can buy one. I work my ass off, keeping myself, my \nfamily and my employees fed and in homes, that's my primary concern. My \ngoal, is to one day, ride in my own Koenigsegg. My absolute dream car. I \nstarted another company, working on patents and designs, and my goal is to \nmake the company thrive and take the profits from it and hopefully buy one \nof these some day soon. Until then, I can simply just dream.\ufeff",

Last i read about their \nfinancial state was that in 2012 (i think) they were borrowing huge amounts \nand were close to going bankrupt. So i suspect Koenigsegg are in some \nserious debt.\nI never caught onto the Koenigsegg hype, which really has spiked with the \nannouncement of the One:1 and that video of the Agera R vs. Veyron Vitesse.\n\nNo doubt i think they make great cars, in terms of build quality and \nperformance, but in my opinion none of their cars are comparable with the \nP1, 918 or LaFerrari. The technology in each of those three cars, far \nexceeds the technology in the One:1, or any of the Agera range. \n\nI just don't see why people are comparing the One:1 to the P1, 918 or \nLaFerrari when those three each produce about 400bhp less than the One:1 \nand are produced in far higher qualities. Even still, around a track, \nnamely the Nurburgring, i don't think the Agera R or One:1 will run as good \na time as everyone thinks. Too much power, most of which isn't usable \naround most of the course, and that was shown when the test driver even \ncrashed the car doing a lap.\n\nI was going to say they won't beat the 918 time, but that is irrelevant. \nFrom what i am told the 918's time wasn't the fastest, and the car is still \nbeing tweaked and updated and will continue to do so. \nMcLaren have already said the P1 will be getting updated as battery \ntechnology advances. Not to mention the time the P1 posted was already very \nquick. So whatever time the One:1 posts is largely irrelevant, not to \nmention i am not fully convinced it will post a quicker time. Even so, \ncertainly not as quick as the 6:30 claims Koenigsegg are making.",

I know the P1 weights are bang on, LaFerrari not so much.\nKoenigsegg seem to be honest, can't tell though. Watch Ferrari though \npretty sure a 458 Speciale weighs around 1400kg by Ferrari's claims, \nwouldn't surprise me if it was more in the region of 1450-1500kg.\n\nEither way although the One:1 is full CF construction, the car is pretty \nbulky design wise. Dimensions, the car is small for a hypercar, or at least \none of the smaller ones. The engine is pretty beefy, 5.0L Twin Turbo V8 \npushing out 1340bhp, or 1360hp.\nI was going to say the engine probably takes a majority of that weight, but \ntheir website claims the engine weighs 197kg which seems very light to me \nconsidering the power output. The chassis only weighs 72kg as well, so not \nreally sure if i am honest. Transmission perhaps? The Koenigsegg \ntransmission doesn't seem as smooth or quick as most i have seen, e.g. \nPorsche's PDK, Ferrari's Dual-Clutch or McLaren's.\n\nWhat i am trying to get my head around is that the Agera R's EU Kerb weight \nis only 1435kg... Personally i would like to see Koenigsegg start fresh \ninstead of reiterating the same design for the last 20 years odd.

The only accurate results you will get is from customers as Ferrari \nconstantly lie about the performance figures of their cars. \n\nAnyway, the LaFerrari owners manual states the cars weight is 1490kg. Not \nsure if that is dry or kerb, but if that is the dry weight then the result \nlines up well with what i calculated and what the owner recorded.\n\nThe LaFerrari is a bigger car than the P1. It has a 6.3L N/A V12, compared \nto a 3.8L TT V8. Even with the turbo's, the engine is likely to weigh more. \nYes, the P1's battery is bigger, but the LaFerrari fuel tank is bigger and \nhold about 20kg more fuel. P1 = 16.3 gals US, LaFerrari = 22.8 gals US. \nMultiply both by 6.2lbs which is rough weight of a US gal of gasoline and \nthere is about a 20kg difference if you convert from lbs to kg.\n\nPut it this way, that customer LaFerrari was weighed at 1675kg, that \nincludes a driver and i assume full fluids and tank. The P1 weighed the \nsame is 1615kg. Subtract the driver from both and we have 1600kg and \n1540kg. Now subtract the weight of fuel in both cars, P1 = 1495kg, \nLaFerrari = 1535kg. Weight difference of 40kg would seem closer, no?\n\nNow lets convert that back to EU Kerb weight, which is half a tank of fuel. \nP1 fuel tank = 45.8kg, LaFerrari = 63.5kg half both weights and add results \nto each respective car. Approximate EU Kerb weight for both cars:\n\nP1 ~ 1520kg, LaFerrari ~ 1570kg, equals an approximate 50kg difference in \nweight. Bare in mind yes, while heavier than a 458 Italia, the LaFerrari \nuses a bigger engine and a hybrid power train. I also it is heavier by \n100kg, guarantee if you weighed a 458 it is much heavier than any claims.\n\nQuite enjoying this, wish to continue? ;)",

The McLaren P1's EU Kerb weight is around 1520kg.\n\nThe LaFerrari was weighed at 1675kg with a driver, but apparently not \ncompletely topped with fluids. Not sure how much fuel, but assuming the \ndriver was 75kg, then the LaFerrari is around the 1600kg mark with what i \nassume is full tank and fluids. So, given LaFerrari fuel tank is a claimed \n86 litres or 22.8 gals US, and 1 gal of gasoline is 6.2lbs, we have: Fuel \nload = 141.4lbs = 64kg.\n\nThe LaFerrari's EU Kerb weight is going to be around 1570kg, which is \nsignificantly higher than claimed weight originally and is 50kg heavier \nthan the P1, if all assumed is correct.
