I've seen the southern European Mantis religiosa mating \nin the field several times, and have discussed with French entomologists \nwho have watched it dozens of times, and never has the female eaten the \nmale.  But this is common behaviour in captivity.  I wonder how much filmed \nbehaviour is an artefact of the animals being kept in small containers.  \nAll the more important then, for researchers to study behaviour in nature.\n\nThanks again for sharing, and for including a helpful and detailed \ncommentary.\ufeff",

Also layer in different sound effects on top of that i.e \nrustling, birds and general nature sounds. This is how It's its done in \nprofessional documentaries anyway.

I have learned a little since then of course and my \nsubsequent videos may be somewhat different.
