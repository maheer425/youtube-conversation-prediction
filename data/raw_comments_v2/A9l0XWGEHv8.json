Living alone, I don't get visitors or anyone \ncalling just to talk.  I feel like I'm in a retirement home as one of the \nelderly forgotten.  I don't even go anywhere by myself anymore unless it's \nto go shopping because things like movies, eating out, etc only reinforces \nthe feeling of being an outsider when I look around and see couples or \ngroups of people doing the same thing.\ufeff",
