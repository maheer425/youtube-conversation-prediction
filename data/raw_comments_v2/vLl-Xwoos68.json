People are beautiful and unique for what they do, for what \nthey think, for who they are and how they treat others not for how they \nlook in the outside, that's just like the packaging of an object, you can't \njudge how good a product is on less you try it, yes it may appeal more to \nsome people because of how it looks but maybe it's not as good or bad as \nyou think. And by now nobody is pure race, we are all just a bunch of mixes \nand it shouldn't matter. It's what we do and how we make others and \nourselves feel what should be more important. In her case, a singer's case, \nher voice and talent is what people should pay attention to, not how she \nlooks, you don't just make music with a pretty face, you are not a better \nor worst singer because of your skin color, she deserves much more \nattention, she is so underrated, I am happy to say that she is BEAUTIFUL, \ntalented and much more than others think. I wish the best for her, I hope \nshe can rise up and be recognized as the amazing singer she is! I hope that \nin the future people finally realize that it's not all about how you look, \nor what you have or wear but about how people is in the inside, how they're \nfeelings are. As for the company I have to give them props for debuting \nher, not any Korean company would do it, I just wish that they keep her \nactive and not just leave her because she is not getting popular. We are \nall beautiful in our special way, in the inside<3 Spread the love! No to \nhaters, be happy, making others smile always comes back in a good result to \nyou, doing bad just get things worst, this are the reasons why our world \nhas so many bad people because we concentrate more on the negative, because \nwe judge without knowing, because we always ignore the pain of others \ninstead of helping. Try each day to be a better version of beautiful unique \nyou as cheesy as it sounds it does good to everyone C:\ufeff",
