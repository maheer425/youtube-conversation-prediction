Everyone looks at each other and sees certain traits that fit \ntheir ideal of a healthy or beautiful person. It's similar to our forced \neugenics/selective breeding on dogs where we mate certain dogs together in \norder to achieve a dog with a certain trait. It's selective breeding at \nit's finest. Keep in mind this really is not all that natural, as the \ntraits that are found healthy or desirable are arbitrary and culturally \nbased, there is no ideal human outside your own culture.

But when one group of people is take take taking and never \ncontributing to the pool, it results in a net loss, which causes other \npeople to not want to donate to the pool since they feel like they never \ntake from it, so why bother contributing to it?

It \nis easy to see then that what this movie suggests -- that no guy goes for \nthe blonde -- is not a Nash equilibrium since EVERY player could do better \nby switching their strategy and going for the blonde. There ARE a few \npossible Nash equilibriums, these are when a certain guy goes for the \nblonde and the rest do not. Then anyone who did not go for the blonde would \nnot do better by switching since they would get nothing. The question then \nbecomes, how do we choose which of these equilibriums to go for?
