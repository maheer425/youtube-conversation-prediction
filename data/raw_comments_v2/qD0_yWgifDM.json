Tons of \nhomework, lots of tests to prepare for, we totally get it. That is where we \nstep in. Math Utility is a 4 day old account, primarily focused on \ndelivering our viewers with a easy to understand, less than 2 minute video \nabout topics in Geometry and Algebra I that could be very hard to \nunderstand. \n\nIf you ever need any help, or know of someone that does, PLEASE send them \nover to our page, not only for our sake, but for theirs too! They will gain \na quick understanding of the topic in the video, and will go into that test \nor homework assignment a lot more confident in their ability. Come check us \nout, and refer us to your friends!\n\nWe take ANY recommendations on math based videos, and will do our absolute \nbest to have those videos uploaded within 2 days!\n\nThank You and Have a Fantastic Day,\nYour Math Utility Team\ufeff",

In the State of New Mexico in the USA,,,, a group of people where \ntrying to grow the spiciest chili pepper ever ......and they succeeded.... \nIt was so spicy that those who eat it would have their mouth catch on \nfire,,,, they began to sweat and their eyes teared up...their nose would \nrun...steam and smoke would rise out of their hair and their head would \nlevitate about their shoulders ......... \n2.    One day years ago in Pattaya Thailand a bunch of guys made a bet as \nto who could eat the most Thai chili peppers.  I ask my friend if there was \nsomething we could eat to lessen the effect of the chili peppers before or \nafter the contest. He said to try eating chocolate. \ufeff",
