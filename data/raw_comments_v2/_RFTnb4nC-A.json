            "text": "ok you westerners, here me out cuz i have a revelation for you. you need to \nknow once and for all that, the first few times we south asians try your \nfood it makes us crap too much too, it's just what you call \"the body \ngetting adjusted to the new diet in its system\" whether the food is healthy \nor not. get it?!! cuz you have suddenly consumed something out the routine \nin terms of your regular diet for your body. so it's just what the human \nbody does. secondly,...jeeezz indian food is relatively healthier!!! yess!! \ndaaayyymmm! just like any other ethnic cuisine is. When it's comes to \nnutrition let me open your eyes that most indian food veg or non-veg is \nprimarily organic veggies/poultry that we shop locally, less processed in \nrelatively cheaper, and traditionally healthy ways(depending on how good of \na host you have) and is surely nutritious & healthy enough or should I \nrather say certainly better in some cases than the \nhighly-processed-additive containing-nutritionless synthetic western food, \npackaged, shelved, for god knows how long with preservatives, food that \nmost probably has mold and yeast from poorly managed food processing units, \nlong preserved packaged meats with tape worms and shit. :| Thirdly, when it \ncomes to matter of \"eating with hands\", even the wealthiest of wealthy \npeople in india have to eat certain food with hands, cuz that's just the \nproper etiquette and tradition, done hygienically by washing hands with \nsoap before and after the meal(part of our dining routine in an indian \nsetting), and whether it's a restaurant or at a friend/host's house our \ndining areas are equipped with a sink and some form of soap. So the next \ntime when the subject of Indian food and health comes up in your \nconversations remember this comment. ok?!! :) thanks and come again! bye \nbye! :)\ufeff",

They will never endorse meat eating.\n4 Just because My sir name is Sharma, does not mean I am a practicing \nHindu, I follow Naamdahri Sikhism which I took from my mother and maternal \nGrandparents who are  Sikhs.\n5 And yes Hindus are 80 % so we may say that majority of them are veg\n6 Bro as a Punjabi and a half Hindu (From Paternal side) and half Sikh \n(From my maternal side) I can say there is hardly any difference in \nlifestyle if you follow either religion. And the ultimate teaching and goal \nof both the religions is to improve Karma which you cannot do without \nabstaining form non veg.\n7 Ask any Muslims about there forefathers. Not even a single would agree \nthat they are descendants of Hindus, so until they change there stand I do \nnot believe that they can be called as a part of Indian culture, because \nwhat I presume to be Indian culture is the people who originated here like \nSikh, Jain, Hindus etc not from Saudi Arabia ",
