Action hero 101.\n- Gameplay is built for left-handed people, which is against smartphones \nstandards.\n- Aiming is done by tapping the target, which means that you can't both see \nand shoot your target unless you have extremely slender fingers.\n- Game concept originates on cats dominating the Internet but there's not a \nsingle meme reference.\n- You litterally empty your magazine faster than you reload it, which means \nyou have at least a 50% vulnerability time ratio.\n- No way to know how much cash each cat is worth.\n- Every die and retry mobilegame that implies an economic system, even very \nbasic, has a way to farm said funds easily.
