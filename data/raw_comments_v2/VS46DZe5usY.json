(...) In \nLakatos' model, we have to explicitly take into account the \"ad hoc \nhypotheses\" which serve as the protective belt. The protective belt serves \nto deflect \"refuting\" propositions from the core assumptions...\" \n\nhttp://philosophy.ru/edu/ref/sci/lakatos.html \n Imre Lakatos, Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research \nProgrammes: \"All scientific research programmes may be characterized by \ntheir 'hard core'. The negative heuristic of the programme forbids us to \ndirect the modus tollens at this 'hard core'. Instead, we must use our \ningenuity to articulate or even invent 'auxiliary hypotheses', which form a \nprotective belt around this core, and we must redirect the modus tollens to \nthese. It is this protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses which has to bear \nthe brunt of tests and get adjusted and readjusted, or even completely \nreplaced, to defend the thus-hardened core.\"\n\nBanesh Hoffmann is quite clear: the Michelson-Morley experiment confirms \nthe variable speed of light predicted by Newton's emission theory of light \nunless there is a protective belt (\"contracting lengths, local time, or \nLorentz transformations\") that deflects the refuting experimental evidence \nfrom the false constant-speed-of-light postulate:\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC \n \"Relativity and Its Roots\", Banesh Hoffmann, p.92: \"Moreover, if light \nconsists of particles, as Einstein had suggested in his paper submitted \njust thirteen weeks before this one, the second principle seems absurd: A \nstone thrown from a speeding train can do far more damage than one thrown \nfrom a train at rest; the speed of the particle is not independent of the \nmotion of the object emitting it. And if we take light to consist of \nparticles and assume that these particles obey Newton's laws, they will \nconform to Newtonian relativity and thus automatically account for the null \nresult of the Michelson-Morley experiment without recourse to contracting \nlengths, local time, or Lorentz transformations. Yet, as we have seen, \nEinstein resisted the temptation to account for the null result in terms of \nparticles of light and simple, familiar Newtonian ideas, and introduced as \nhis second postulate something that was more or less obvious when thought \nof in terms of waves in an ether.\"\ufeff",

We have no idea how our galaxy is moving relative \nto the universe, and we have no idea what to call the epicenter of the \nuniverse anyway. As you see, it's impossible to measure concrete velocities \nthrough space, because there is no concrete point of reference.

            "text": "+Andrew Carlisle\nAs a practical matter, even having it happen over 98 seconds instead of 1 \nsecond, you're still taking about an energy transfer (say, if all that \nobject's kinetic energy where given off as heat) that's equivalent to all \nthe energy coming out of 200 copies of the Sun for more than a minute and a \nhalf. In other words, the object is vaporized into a plasma. But let's \nleave that aside.\n\nIt's an interesting thought experiment. Some observations:\n1. Your scenario shouldn't include an observer pressing a button, since \nthat introduces of the issue of the time for that action to causally \ninfluence other locations in your scenario. Instead, declare that the \nentire slowing-down-mechanism was preset to activate so that it began, in \nthe lab frame, when B reached the origin (the tip of the barrel of the \ngun), and manifested a constant deceleration of point A, as measured in the \nlab frame, to where A came to rest in 98 seconds.\n2. You'll need some assumptions as in #1, because lab-measured deceleration \nof different points on the object is not going to be constant. The \ndeceleration mechanism must be applied along the entire object and with \ndifferent extents in order to achieve the lab-measured stopping of the \nentire object in 98 seconds. You can't make an assumption about applying a \nforce at one point and having the entire rigid body react accordingly, \nthese speeds are dwarfing the speed of sound through the object.\n3. With 1 and 2 in mind, the scenario remains set up so that, in the lab \nframe, A undergoes constant deceleration, from its initial speed to 0, in a \ncertain time, and that this deceleration begins at the same time (lab \nframe) as when B reaches the origin. So in the lab, at time =0, both A and \nB are moving in the positive x direction at velocity v, B is at the origin, \nand A is at x = L/gamma (where L is the object's rest length, and gamma is \n1 over square root 1 minus v-squared over c-squared). At time t=0, the \nstopping mechanism along the entire rigid body kicks in, and slows the \nwhole thing down so that:\ni) In the lab, by construction of the stopping mechanism, point A \ndecelerates uniformly from velocity v to 0 in time T.\nii) The stopping mechanism is designed so that object doesn't undergo any \ninternal change as seen by an observer riding the object. It isn't \nstretched or crushed according to an observer inside it.\nYes, that appears to me to be a physically valid gedanken experiment.\n\nSo here's the setup as in #3: Let t = lab time and xA(t) = lab position of \nA, and xB(t) = lab position of B.\nThen by construction, xA(t) = (L/gamma) + vt + 1/2 a t^2, where a = -v/T. \nAlso  xB(0) = 0.\nSo, xA(T) = (L/gamma) + 1/2 v T, and it seems that xB(T) = xA(T) - L, (the \nminus L is because the object didn't deform and is now at rest when t=T, so \nthe lab measures its length to be its rest length).\nSo it seems that xB(T) = (-1+1/gamma)L + 1/2 v T.\nQuestion #1: Find xB(t), and so xB(T). \nQuestion #2: If arrange numbers so that xB(T) = L(-1+1/gamma) + 1/2 v T < \n0, then B ended up to the left of the origin. Does this make sense? Is \nthere a contradiction there somewhere?\nProblem With Question2: If this is a physically valid scenario, the xB(t) \nwill be a smooth function. From xB'(0) = v > 0, xB(0)=0, and xB(T)<0, can \ndeduce from xB(t) being smooth that there exists some time t0, 0<t0<T such \nthat xB'(t0)=0 and xB(t0)>0. Why can't we just stop B at t0? Why,  in order \nto stop A, do we have to stop B, and then make B move the opposite \ndirection? It seems like that shouldn't be necessary in order to stop A.\n\nObservation #1: Condition ii, that an observer riding on the object sees no \ndistortion of the object, is the complicating factor. Ordinary special \nrelativity, with its nice constant velocities, makes everything into nice \nclean vector spaces and linear transformations between them. If I recall, \nCondition ii and constant acceleration of a frame change the coordinates \ndescribing where a point (event) is from being nice straight (if slanted) \nlines to being hyperbolas. In order to decelerate the object while not \ndeforming it, the lab-measured deceleration won't be uniform across the \nobject.\nObservation #2: As in #1, Einstein's Equivalence Principle says that an \nacceleration can be identified with free-fall under the effect of gravity. \nThus the math here is going to look like the math of General Relativity. As \nwith Observation#1, it means that you've got some complicated \"metric\" \ndescribing the math and the relation between the lab frame and the \naccelerating frame.\nObservation #3: I believe any accelerating frame of reference creates a \n\"horizon\" like the event horizon of a black hole (one whose consequences \nare so small-distant as to be ignorable for ordinary small speeds and \naccelerations). In your example, if we forget about the object for a \nmoment, and just consider point A, if you consider the gravitational pull \nrequired to stop an object initially moving at 0.9999c in 98 seconds, \nyou're talking about an incredibly strong gravitational pull - perhaps \nsomething like a nearby blackhole? And that suggests to me, in an \nunspecified & vague conceptual way, that some \"horizon effect\" of the \naccelerating reference frame might actually be relevant here. Perhaps \nsomething like this setup requires A and B be on opposite sides of the \nhorizon?\nObservation #4: The \"Problem With Question2\" might turn out to not be a \nproblem at all. When you look at the math, it might just turn out to be the \nway things have to be. The problem doesn't actually contradict anything \nother than my intuition.\nObservation #5: Algebraically, if I made no mistake, xB(T) < 0 requires \nbeta (v/c) be greater than 4K/(4+K^2) and less than 2/K, where K = cT/L. \nAnd that requires K < 2. (Note the limiting K = 2 case leads to v = c.). K \nis the ratio of how far a light signal will travel during that stopping \ntime, to the rest length of the object.\nObservation #6: I'd have to seriously read up on this to confidently solve \nfor xB(t), since that requires fully understanding what Condition ii \ndemands. I'm not going to invest so many hours unless the mood really \nstrikes me (which it could, but currently, no). So the details of solving \nyour scenario are beyond me at the moment - I'd have to seriously study up \non forgotten stuff, and learn some new stuff, to answer your question fully \nand confidently.",

Remember that it takes 100 seconds to see what's happening 100 light \nseconds away.\n3. 100 light seconds is a serious distance.

The persons \nwithin the elevator are in free fall, so it seems like the acceleration \nperfectly balances out the gravitational field.  Thus the common belief \nthat the acceleration is equivalent to a gravitational field.  But, place \ntwo balls as far apart as you can within the elevator.  As the elevator \napproaches earth, the balls are attracted to the centre of the earth, so \nthey move in two lines that are not exactly parallel.  These two balls will \napproach each other more rapidly than can be defined by the gravitational \nforce between them.  Given enough precision, enough time, a large enough \nelevator ( so the balls are VERY far apart), it would be possible to \ndiscern the actual existence of a gravitational object, and realize that \nyou must be in free-fall, and are accelerating.  \n\nMathematically, the curvature of space in an accelerating reference frame \ncan be reworked to an 'flat' space-time, whereas this cannot be done for a \ngravitational field.\ufeff",

Because 'apple' is a human concept, an apple being an \napple relies on the observer being human; English speaking even, because to \na French person it'd be 'pomme'. And even if the naming doesn't change the \nobject, an apple being an absolute would mean that even if there'd never \nbeen any apples, there would still have to be an transcendent idea of an \napple to attach to an atom cluster that might eventually appear having the \nproperties stipulated by the idea of 'apple'. This platonic view of the \nworld gets you in heaps of problems, for instance when to start calling a \ncollection of grains a heap.\nIt is in questioning the preconceptions on which we base our understanding \nthat we evolve our understanding.\ufeff",
