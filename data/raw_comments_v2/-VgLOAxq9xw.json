I think some people look at privilege on an individual level. \nThey look around and say \"hey my life isn't perfect I'm not privileged\". \nBut I will say this I'm an ethnic minority in America (I say it in that way \nto take the focus off myself but give a general understanding of my view).\n\nAlso, I love Jon Green books and I'm happy for his success. So I'm not \nsaying this from a place of hate at all, he does a lot of great things and \nworks hard. But when you look at all of the MEGA successful books, and \nauthors with huge followings most likely they are white, the characters are \nmajority white, etc. This doesn't mean all white people are racist, or even \nmost (I would hope) but it's one example of privilege. Authors of other \nraces that write about their culture usually do not have the same exposure.\n\nMOST white people (based on numbers here) are not going to buy a book with \nsay a Black person on the cover, or a Black protagonist at the same rate as \nbooks with white characters. It's subconscious for the most part, but \nthings like this are the reason why authors (or any person trying to appeal \nto the \"masses\" aka mainstream, aka white people at large) may whitewash \ntheir characters, change their book covers etc.\n\nTwilight series, all of Jon Green's books, Harry Potter, 50 Shades of Grey, \netc etc etc....yes MOST books, no matter who it was written by won't have \nthis level of success. But if you are not writing from a perspective that \nis comfortable for \"mainstream\" you're almost dead in the water before you \nstart. You CAN have success and can see books, but it most likely be at the \nsame level as a successful white author.\n\nThis isn't an indictment of white people. Other races need to embrace \nauthors that are out there too, white privileged runs deep.\n\nAnd finally, I'm an ethnic/racial minority but I am also an AMERICAN, and \nmiddle-class. I have privilege too. Most of us do, even if you're reading \nthis on the computer. But Jon is right, a WHITE AMERICAN, MALE, CHRISTIAN, \nSTRAIGHT, and MIDDLE CLASS + as it stands has the MOST priviliedge in this \ncountry regardless of people's opinions, and it's good that he spoke out \nabout how he is grateful and at least recognizes his position.\ufeff",

Simple.\n\nYouTube- Whites and Asians actually make up the majority of YT watchers, \ntherefore MOST uber popular channels are either by Whites or Asians. Again \njust from sheer numbers and people watching others that \"look\" like them, \nsimilar interests etc.\n\nI could go on, but basically what I'm saying is I think he realizes that \ndespite hard work, there is still some \"luck\" even at the beginning because \nyou're level of popularity or \"repeatability\" may be higher, exposure, etc. \nDon't get me wrong, I take nothing away from his success and own some of \nhis books but yes these things do count...and they do matter.\n\nAnd I'm glad that there is a push and (seemingly) a desire for more diverse \nbooks because maybe some \"others\" will be able to one day garner the same \ntype of enthusiasm from readers and grow their audience.
