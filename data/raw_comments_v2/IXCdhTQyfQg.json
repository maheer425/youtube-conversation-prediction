            "text": "There are some strange things I learnt about the human body from my korean \nfriends. Sort of old school remedies similar to chinese acupuncture.\n\n1) Every organ in your body is somehow connected to the muscles or nerve \nendings on the sole of your foot. By applying pressure to certain areas and \ngauging the ammount of discomfort you feel you can tell how healthy your \nliver, kidneys, heart, stomach etc are. Wierd but true.\n\n2) When feeling naucious (sick?) koreans prick the cuticle of thier left \nthumb nail with a pin and squeeze some blood out. The blood that comes out \nis almost black at first. They keep squeezing until all the dark blood is \ngone and red blood comes out. One of two things will happen then. Either \nyou will no longer feel sick in the stomache or you will vomit, and then \nfeel 100% better. I have had this done to me many times. It works!\n\n3) There is a pressure point between your thumb and forefinger that when \nmassaged, instantly relieves headaches. I have done this when suffering \nmigranes and the migrane becomes nothing more than a small headache, \neventually, nothing!\n\n4) Similar to the foot thing, facial muscles effect how the rest of our \nbody \"feels\". I have had some intence facial massages from my ex gf when I \ncomplained about feeling ill and you can't believe how great you feel \nafterwards. Especially when massaged around the synuses, temple and base of \nthe skull. I often do this to myself now when feeling run down or tired.\n\n5) This one is not so strange but people forget it. Massaging your muscles \nregularly helps to release deadly toxins that are stored there from fatigue \nor stress. The toxins are released into the blood stream, which may sound \nbad, but actually allows your liver and kidneys process and eliminate those \ntoxins. It also releases endorphins stored up in your muscles which gives \nyou a kind of euphoric high. Get regular massages people!\n\nIt just goes to show, homeopathic and alternative treatment is not all new \nage nonsense like most westerners believe. Think I might try acupuncture \nfor my sore back some time in the future ;)",

Over time, with all the damage done to you, \nyour body parts become so damaged that they could just fall off. But it \ntakes a bit of force to have it detach from your body.
