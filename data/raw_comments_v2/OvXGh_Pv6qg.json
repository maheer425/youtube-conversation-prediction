            "text": "Misschien kan je een kleine reis-statief meenemen, wel heb je dan het \nprobleem dat je geen hoge werkhoogte hebt.\nVerder is B & H Photo-Video een hele goede zaak in New York, het ligt \nvolgens mij aan de 9th Avenue, ik heb daar zelf een 16-35mm lens \naangeschaft. Service was goed, het was alleen wel erg druk. Maar ik denk \ndat het na de zomer niet zo druk meer zou zijn in die zaak. Het is een erg \ngrote zaak en het valt van buiten op door de donkergroene bordjes van de \nzaak. Als je daar geen GoPro vind dan zou het erg raar zijn, want het \nassortiment is echt enorm! Ik zou gewoon B & H Photo-Video op je mobiel \n(google maps) zetten en er daar op zoek naar gaan met behulp van google \nmaps. Heb namelijk wel de ervaring dat navigeren als toerist in New York \nerg moeilijk kan zijn, zelfs na 2 weken. Elke straat lijkt weer op elkaar. \nEen tip is om je zelf te navigeren rond de Empire State Buiding heen, die \nsteekt er namelijk wel vaak bovenuit als je in de buurt bent. Zelf zaten we \nin het Crowne Plaza hotel aan Times Square, dus we gebruikte meer het \nRockefeller center als ori\u00ebntatiepunt. Verder moet je in New York niks \nzomaar op straat kopen. Zo worden er bijvoorbeeld horloges of groot \ngedrukte foto's verkocht op straat. Vaak zijn de prijzen veel te duur, en \nproducten zijn ook nep op straat. In de winkels zijn de producten veel \nbetrouwbaarder en echt.\n\nAls je trouwens eens honger hebt, ga dan naar het Applebees restaurant vlak \nbij Time Square en bestel het Sparerib menu, Amerikaanse spareribs zijn \necht goddelijk!\nVerder zou ik ook uit de buurt blijven van Starbucks, want de ervaring \nleert dat je daar een half uur in de rij kan staan voor een koffie (in de \nzomer althans.)\n\nWaarom maak je niet iets van een Flickr. account of iets in die vorm?

            "text": "+OkeTV Hey daar, thnx voor je tips. Ik zal ze zeker meenemen. Sowieso wil \nik Times Square in de nacht gaan fotograferen met een langere sluitertijd. \nOok overdag een langere sluitertijd experimenteren met een ND filter. \nDaarnaast willen we ook nog een GoPro verslagje maken. Denk dat ik de \nkitlens van Nikkor meeneem dan heb ik toch nog redelijk bereik. Vooral de \ngroothoek 18mm(-105mm) is fijn, zonder dat je een fisheye effect krijgt. \n35mm i.p.v. 50mm, kan ik nog portretjes maken met wat meer speling, zonder \nal te croppen en oom nog wat GoPro fotootjes. \nBen van huis uit camerman/editor en fotografie was meer als hobby. Twee \njaar geleden uiteindelijk besloten om toch de Kunstacademie voor fotografie \nin Belgi\u00eb te doen. Foto's maken van NYC lijkt me echt awesome. Ik verwacht \ndat de stad heel veel indruk op me zal maken. Heel veel prikkels en dingen \ndie je ziet om vast te leggen. Dat wil ik juist voorkomen en selectief gaan \nfotograferen. Berlijn, London en Parijs heb ik al op de gevoelige plaat en \nnu NYC, te gek lijkt het me! Ik fotografeer sowieso altijd manual, \nautomatisme geworden. Echter ga ik 'ns kijken of ik half automatisch ga met \nde F-stand. Heb zelf de Nikon D90 en van werk uit gebruik ik de Canon 7D.",

            "text": "Leuk om te horen dat je ook gaat naar New York City! Naast Time Square is \nook het uitzicht van de Empire State Building adembenemend. Je kunt ook het \nuitzicht bekijken vanaf het Rockefeller center, dat raad in aan in de \nmiddag. Als het al donker is dan zou ik voor de Empire State Building gaan! \nVanaf bovenaf kan je hele mooie foto's maken. Ook is het leuk om naar het \nvrijheidsbeeld te gaan, er vaart een oranje boot naar het vrijheidsbeeld \nwaar je gratis in kunt. In de zomer was het daar erg druk, maar ik denk dat \nhet na de zomer wel wat rustiger is daar. Ook een mooie plek om naar toe te \ngaan en te fotograferen is bij het 9/11 monument. En als je daar toch in de \nbuurt bent, ben je ook direct erg dicht bij het nieuwe World Trade Center, \ndat is ook een erg mooi plaatje voor een paar foto's. Verder kent New York \nook nog een historisch district, als je met de grote rode New York Bus gaat \ntouren (zeker een aanrader als je niet lang blijft) dan rijd je daar \ndoorheen als je in de goede bus zit. Verder heb je natuurlijk ook nog \nCentral Park, nu weet ik alleen niet hoe het daar is in januari. Ook moet \nje niet vergeten de skyline te fotograferen vanuit het vliegtuig, ook als \nje op New Ark airport land heb je een erg mooi uitzicht om de New York City \nskyline vanuit het vliegtuig.\nAls je meer tips over New York nodig hebt hoor ik het wel ;) Ben daar \nafgelopen vakantie 2 weken geweest dus ik heb aardig wat kunnen oppikken \nvan New York. Ook ben ik 2 weken in Las Vegas en 2 Weken in Houston geweest \nom de vakantie vol te maken haha ;)\nVegas is misschien een aanrader voor de volgende vakantie!\n\nVerder nog een tip over de fotografie: Als je in de avond wilt fotograferen \nin New York moet je zorgen dat je camera instellingen wel goed staan, \ncompacte camera's raken snel door de war met de verhouding tussen de \nhoeveelheid lichtjes in New York en de donkere lucht. Zelf gebruik ik \nrelatief professioneel camera-apparatuur, als je ook fotografeert met een \nDSLR gebruik in de Avond dan een sluitertijd van 1/30 en een lage F/stop, \nIk zou de ISO nooit hoger zetten dan 3200.\nEn als je een driepoot statief meeneemt, zou ik de shutter speed ergens \nrond de 5 seconden zetten, zodat licht niet gaat overheersen.  Uiteraard \nmet een hogere F/Stop.\nDus als je met een spiegelreflex fotografeert, wees niet bang om hem een \nkeer op Manual-mode te zetten. Het geeft alleen maar uitdaging en je foto's \nworden erg mooi als je het goed doet!\nGoede spiegelreflexcamera's zijn bijvoorbeeld de Canon 5D mark 2, of de wat \ngoedkopere Canon 7D ;)\n\nDus als je meer wilt weten hoor ik het wel, ik doe het met alle plezier ;)",
