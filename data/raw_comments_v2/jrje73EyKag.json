I have done it on small \nscale with a magnifying glass but this would likely burn the panel \ninstantly . but likely make much more power before it does. it would also \nbe cool to see how quick it would melt snow in your driveway in the \nwinter...could also use it to focus energy inside the house by making a \nwall furnace in a window focus the light on the furnace but just make sure \nyou dont burn the house down lol\ufeff",
