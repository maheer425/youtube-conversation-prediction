The act of capital creation is the \nbenchmark that often should be met in order to be able to perpetuate a \nself-sustaining economy, community, group, whatever. If one can earn your \nmoney, one can earn another person's money. If one requires assistance to \nemerge or survive, one will likely require assistance to remain sustained. \nIf helping people is the goal, empowering them to improve their lives \n(absent your assistance) is the best way. That means earning your services, \ndollars, attention, whatever. Rather than donating, one should invest in \nbusinesses, projects, individuals and communities. (Simply reinvest the \ndividends and/or profits if you're concerned about benefiting from the \nmutual exchange of value.) Also, by taking on the expense as an investment, \nchoices become more prudent, and the consequence of loss provides the \nproper information to improve society as a whole. It's easy to throw money \nat the poor and feel good about the action, but it doesn't do anyone any \ngood if the poor don't have a means of sustaining what they've been given.",
