The \nmen and women associated with that establishment are incredible scientific \nthinkers, always asking questions and seeking discovery, yet they start on \nthe assumption that God created everything. Religion doesn't have to be a \ntool of the past or an end of scientific thought. Besides. Every theory in \nexistence pertaining to the past has a  considerable amount of assumptions \nthat the whole theory is built on. And, since we can't go back in time to \nobserve anything that happened, we can't prove 100% either creationism or \nsecular creation theories. In both we hold faith that the assumptions we \nbased our theories off of hold true, and from that we interpret the \nevidence we find to fit our beliefs.\ufeff",
