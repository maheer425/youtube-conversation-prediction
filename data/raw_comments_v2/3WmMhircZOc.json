You don't see white people going crazy when someone is killed do you? \nSpeaking about double standards is not racism so you can get the fuck out \nof here with that. \n\nMoreover , this was a fucking joke that got taken way out of hand, my \ncomment about the guy that was shot being a scumbag was true and absolutely \nnothing to do with the colour of his skin. He had been under surveillance \nfor many months previous to this, had been arrested for robbery, murder and \nattempted murder previously, hardly a fucking saint was he?\n\nFurthermore, American issues have little to do with anything that happened \nhere so bringing that up is just another pathetic excuse for the fact you \nhave no real argument. Also, I wouldn't go calling people uneducated when \nyour entire comment is about how I'm supposedly racist for admonishing \nsomeone over a bullshit comment. Because this guy happened to be black it \nwas automatically deemed as a racist attack despite there being absolutely \nzero evidence to support it, got what he deserved and it's because he's a \nscumbag, not because he's black.

You could \nspeculate the \"soldier vs soldier\" competition all day. You have no clue \nabout either country's tactics. You watch videos on the Youtube or hear \nstories from your friends about their gardener's, uncle's, cousin's \nbartender who served as deck swabber in the Navy or some shit.\n\nBottom line is that you never served, and being that you never served, you \nwould have really no idea of what your military's training and \neffectiveness is really like, let alone another country's. Hence the reason \nyou're just a some Brit fanboy who's no different then some country bumpkin \nhere screaming \"Murica\" at every turn. The Army is little girls?? Whatever \ncredibility you had for making me continue this debate beyond this reply \nwas just revoked. You're officially moron and make people from your country \nlook bad.\n\nOf course the US is going to have more friendly fire incidents than you. We \nhave roughly 2 million people serving in our military. You have less than \n250,000. Friendly fire and civilian casualties are an unfortunate part of \nevery war and on every side. We are obviously going to have more due to our \nnumbers. Im sure a dope like you can figure out the math on that one. \n\nNobody cries for your help with anything. Especially the US. We're allies \nand we go to war together. But silly me. Here I go again talking about war \nwith someone who knows nil on the subject.\n\nAmerican girls do like Brits because of their accents. Thers no lie there. \nHowever, thats a double sword my little Brit friend. I happen to know first \nhand that your girls love Americans. And not just their accents btw.\n\nThe one thing we can agree on is that Eminem was once a good rapper. Don't \ncare about the Beatles. It's not the 60's anymore.

When I was there, I saw plenty of fat \nasses. Get over it. You're a fat nation.\n\nI served in the USMC and we trained with live rounds all the time. Its not \na British thing. You don't know \"yank soldiers\" and you don't know combat. \nFor you to say, an I quote, \"a yank soldier is more dangerous to himself \nand others on his team than the enemy, pathetic\", is completely off base \nconsidering you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\nWould you like me to list friendly fore incidents involving British troops \non their own soldiers and us Americans?? I'd glad enlighten you.\n\nThe UK was powerful. WAS. You never had anywhere near the influence the US \nhas on the world today. You're troops are good, but they're not tougher, \nbetter trained, smarter, skilled, etc., then an American soldier or Special \nForces soldier for that matter. You try to maintain whatever deflated ego \nyou have by stating you train better, fight better or invented it first or \nwhat have you. This all you guys got so you hold onto it and then take to \nthe internet to voice your frustrations about Americans. This is the \nBritish M.O.\n\nThe US as a country and its military as a whole is levels above yours. Just \nget over it. You and the rest of the fat Brits in your country love to wage \nthis internet war with Americans as if you're going to make us see it your \nway. We are better than you. Period.\n\nI see by the videos you watch you're also an Eminem (an American \nironically) fanboy as well. There was a diss song to Benzino called \"Nail \nin the Coffin\", and a line at the end that song that you should apply to \nyour military in comparison to ours, your country being a bunch of fat \nasses too, and this entire argument in general where you have no idea what \nyou're talking about.....\"Let it go dog, it's over\".
