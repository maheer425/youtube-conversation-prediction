I always thought this song was just them \nrapping and having fun and it never really meant much. As time passed by, i \nlistened to more of their songs and i got to know bts more and more. What \neach member was like and the relationship they had with each other. No more \ndream was the first song i heard from bts. Every now and then i would hear \nit playing and each time i grew to love it. So i decided to watch the mv \none more time.... my thoughts about this song completely changed. The \nenglish captions were on and with each line they rapped/sang i realized \nthat this wasn't just another pre written song that was given to them with \nno meaning. It was a song with a message to open your eyes and dream and \nchase it. I realized from past videos of bts that the lyrics were from \ntheir experiences and feelings and thoughts put into a song. This song also \nmade me realize that i shouldn't let my parents dictate my life for me. Im \ngoing to chase after what i really want instead of lying to my self and \nsaying that i want to be a stupid lawyer with no passion. So basically, \nthank you Kim Taehyung, Jeon Jungkook, Park Jimin, Min Yoongi, Kim Seokjin, \nKim Namjoon, and Jung Hoseok for your amazing music and inspiration. Thank \nyou for making me realize thay its my life and no one else's. Thank you, \nand i love you all!\ufeff",
