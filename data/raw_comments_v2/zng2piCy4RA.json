But I also think  we should find a balance between dwelling with \nsinners and not being conformed, but upholding God's commandments. Jesus \nwas not quiet about sin, He often seemed harsh but was real to His \ndisciples-- \"if you can't carry your cross, follow me and deny yourself, \nyou can't be my disciple\" and scriptures say we are to expose darkness into \nthe light. As a church we should still uphold God's commandments in our \nhearts as this is what Jesus told us to do-- if you love me you will obey \nmy commands.We should not forget about mercy and compassion and live \nunconditional love, but also to keep the zeal and passion the Lord has, to \n\"proclaim\" the Gospel to all nations. we should be mindful not to make \nquick, tactless judgments on our neighbors but we should still preach and \nstand up for the truth about sin\ufeff",

They sit in church just so they appear normal. Appearing normal \nis the same as conformity to societies ways.\n\nPick and Choose: The practitioners that choose only to believe in some of \nthe ideals as laid out according to the Bible, while dismissing other \nideals as wrong or untruthful.\n\nGreed Only: People who claim to be Christian yet their actions demonstrate \nonly greed. Greed not only to monetary resources but greed to all \nresources. The ones who take more than their fair share of gifts we all \nneed to survive.\n\nMy Way or Highway: These are the Christians that truthfully believe that \ntheir ideals and values are the only ones worthy to God. This group isn't \ninherently evil but when taken to the extreme results in bigotry.\n\nEveryday: Those Christians who in general follow the path that Jesus wanted \nthem to follow. They try their best to be righteous with sincerity yet they \nalso realize that as humans they make mistakes and break the laws of God. \nWhile they may sin they actively seek to be forgiven and try better in the \nfuture.\n\nAltruistic: These are the followers that respect others yet follow the path \nJesus wanted to follow. They follow this path everyday and rarely sin.. \nThey are inherently givers and not takers. As a giver they respect everyone \nno matter their belief system.\ufeff",

Well, etc etc, I got pushed away from the church that my \nfamily founded some 150 years back. I came to then see that my problems \nwith the church ran deeper than just the people. I studied other religions \nand came to what I thought was a unique stand on religion: that all \nreligions were separate expressions of the same being (though I'm not sure \nabout the church of the flying spaghetti monster). As any good young \nscholar would, I discussed my thoughts with my peers, and quickly found \nthat they shared my thoughts. And yes this is just a long winded story to \ndiscuss the real reasoning for many people in this \"godless generation\" to \navoid church.

I completely disagree because I listen to Skillet. I would love to go \nback to church, if only they wouldn't focus on trying to tell me how to \nlive my life and allow me to have God show me whats right and whats wrong. \nI want to go to church for God's guidance, not to be looked as a target.\ufeff",

Although I believe there to be no god there's no doubt \nthat some people benefit emotionally and in other ways from religion and \nthat's great by me. If having a figure of a god makes them happy and fills \ntheir lives with purpose and hope then I can't say that they shouldn't \nbelieve. I really wish some christian people could, like me, step on \nsomeone's shoes and not make unfair assumptions about our lives and values \nand how we feel as atheists.\n\nIt really makes me feel bad when I get someone from any religion basically \npitying me for not believing. They feel as though something in my life is \nmissing and that there's no possible way that I'm completely happy without \ngod. They are entitled to think what they wish, that is their right and I \nwon't stand in the way of it. Although, I do wish people could understand \nthat the happiness, hope and fulfilment they get from god I get from \nelsewhere, and that's fine. Some people make me feel as though I am \npurposeless and just wandering around life if I don't follow a religion\n\nThe fact that I don't think that my life is ultimately relevant to the \nuniverse and that I'm not going to be eternal doesn't mean that my life is \nnot relevant to myself or that I'm going to live in the limbo after I die. \nIt doesn't mean that without the promise of some sort of Eden I'll be a bad \nperson. I'm a good person and have values because I understand suffering \nand that's not something I could possibly wish upon anyone. I love every \nsingle person and understand that everyone is a complex human being that \ncan't be labeled as good or bad. I believe we're all made up of chemicals \nand experiences that make us the people we are. And my belief shouldn't \ntrouble anyone, the same way other people's beliefs don't trouble me.\ufeff",

You call us fat and lazy but continue to \nfeed children pizza and cake and soda at parties. You wonder why there's so \nmuch suicide and bullying but maybe if you bothered to pay attention to \nyour kids and give them the love and guidance they need they wouldn't feel \nthe need to act out or bully other people.

Thou shall go forth to convince the human condition. \n Why must everyone be like you?  Perhaps when your 'mission' is no longer \nto 'convert' those who see differently- then you too can agree to disagree. \n It is OK for us all to be unique.  It does not matter 'how many' people \nlive as we ourselves do.  Live and let live should be a given.  Your poem \nwas well scripted and beautifully written.  The words did not directly \ncondemn the next generation.  But wait wasn't \"Godless' the name of your \npoetic creation?  Is it not then your point to say they are living \n'without' that which you have?  Life is a journey and not a destination. \n Perhaps be mindful of your station, sitting upon a well lit chair pointing \ncountless fingers in condemnation.  Put your finger down, breathe, turn \naround that frown.  Do you believe that God gave humans free will?  Perhaps \nthe mission should be to protect that gift and just...chill.\ufeff",
