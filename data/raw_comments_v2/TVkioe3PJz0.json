Single or chronic exposure can lead to berylliosis, an \nincurable lung condition.\"\n\nAnother article on Berylliosis shows that it causes \"the development of \nsmall inflammatory nodules, called granulomas\" in the lungs. This \neventually leads to restrictive lung disease. While incurable, the symptoms \ncan, in fact, be treated.\n\n\"In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the \nIARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be \ndirectly handled.\" So as long as the pink area containing the beryllium is \nintact, it's almost perfectly safe. I still recommend wearing gloves and a \nmask to prevent contact with or inhalation of the beryllium in case of an \naccident.\n\nThat's just my two cents on this whole Beryllium thing, backed by a few \nminutes of research. I'm no chemist, so if you want to confirm or disprove \nthis, then go ahead and ask one. You could try turning to NurdRage for \ninformation.\n\nAnd yes, I used Wikipedia to get my information. However, given that they \nhave a headquarters and strict quality control guidelines are enforced, I \ncan say that they provide good information.\ufeff",
