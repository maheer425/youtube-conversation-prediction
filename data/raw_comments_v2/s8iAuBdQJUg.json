Harry was always \nencouraging and almost daring Dorian to explore his darker nature. But, \nHarry didn't actually live that lifestyle himself. He lived vicariously \nthrough Dorian, using him to live out his own fantasies with no consequence \nto his own reputation or conscience. And I also feel that the idea that we \nwear our choices in our physical appearance is worth noting. Because of the \nportrait absorbing the physical consequences of Dorian's choices, Dorian is \nenabled to continue his scandalous behavior. When someone smokes their \nwhole life, or drinks heavily, or spends too much time in the sun, it is \nwritten on their face. You can tell by where wrinkles begin to emerge if \nsomeone has furrowed their brows perhaps too much, or spent a lot time \nsmiling. There's actually a whole Chinese medical science dedicated to \nfacial analysis. Anyway, that's just my humble opinion. I know you only \nhave about five minutes and you can't cover it all. Again, I love your \nvideos.\ufeff",

The book becomes like a holy scripture to \nDorian, and he begins to base his life and actions on it. Wilde was trying \nto portray how much of a damaging influence art can have over an individual \nand almost criticizes those who surrender themselves completely to such an \ninfluence.  The author advocates the expression of one\u2019s self and looks \ndown upon the action of sacrificing yourself to another person or to a work \nof art, (Dorian literally did this) and conveys how it leads to one\u2019s own \nself-destruction.\ufeff",
