If it was so racist, then how did many African American \nperformers like Eddie Murphey become #1 box office draws and the Cosby Show \nbe the #1 show.  People were happy and we all believed in \"United we stand \nand divided we fall\"  More people from different races, social statuses and \nwalks of life became millionaires.  It was the largest expansion of our \neconomy ever once we got that lame dick Jimmy Carter out of the White House \ncause he was a loser failure.  Not how it is now with you guys being told \nlies about how it was back then and that we were all racists who hated each \nother.  No one cared what race or color you were.  Yes, it was glorious.  I \nlived it.  And you know what else.  We hated communism back then.  Not how \nyou guys are now who embrace it's re-branded name \"Progressives\".  Not many \npeople were on psychiatric drugs cause not many people were crazy.  You \nactually learned real history in school and not this phony history they are \npassing along.  Our students were not so stupid that we ranked the bottom \nof the list like Millennials and kids of today are in world rankings.  It \nwas fucking awesome to have lived through it.  It was the most fun period \nto live in next to the 50's from people who lived in the 50's.  I was a \nteenager/adult then.  You guys missed out on the most fun/best time ever.\n \nUnlike how you depressing assholes now are having the old \"divide and \nConquer\" applied to them.  Oldest trick in the book.  Everyone is made to \nhave everyone now.  Women say all men are rapists (Not even true but you \nguys are believing that lie.  Race relations are the worst ever now.  A \ntown was completely burnt down on a made up lie of Hands up don't shoot.  \nEric Holder's DOJ even confirmed that it was all bullshit.  I guarantee you \nfuture generations are going to look on this time and this PC crap and call \nyou guys the dumbest generation ever.  What am I talking about.  They are \nalready doing it now.  Bid study 2 weeks ago shows that Millenials are at \nthe bottom of the list of nations when it comes to reading skills, working \nskills and basic problem solving.  Translations =  you guys collectively \nare dumb asses.  Congratulations on being the generation to hit rock \nbottom.  We couldn't even do that in the 80's if we tried.  And thank god \nMSNBC is doing so poorly ratings wise cause no one is believing that \ncraptacular channel anymore it is about to change it's entire format and \nmost everyone there is going to be fired.  You guys had your PC/progressive \ncommunist bullshit shot.  And like every time it was tried before, it \nfailed miserably cause it is built on a lie.  You guys are on more \npsychiatric drugs and committing suicide more than every in history of our \ncountry.  Your the lowest graduation and test scores ever.  Right now there \nare less people working then when Star Wars came out and we had 100 million \nless people (check it out.  It's called the Labor Participation Rate).  the \nactual unemployment rate is at 38%.  What does your generation have going \nfor you.  Nothing.
