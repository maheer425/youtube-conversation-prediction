I.e., certain levels of temperature and humidity dampen \nsound less due to how dense the air is as a result of temp and humidity vs \nother levels of temp and humidity. \n\nSay colder more humid air is very dense air. Sound will need to work harder \nto maintain a certain level of intensity. Compare that to dryer, more warm \nair. Sound in that scenario won't have to work as hard to maintain a \ncertain level of intensity. \n\nHopefully this made sense and if I'm incorrect on anything id love to hear \na correction.",

(in the same circumstances) i also wondered what a \nsupersonic explosion, or in other words, a detonation would be like, since \nit produces a schockwave faster than the speed of sound. i don't realy know \nfor sure whether this supersonic schockwave, is supersonic going through \nthe explosive material, and slowing down to the speed of sound when it \nexits. but i assume it remains faster than the speed of sound for a while. \neven outside of the explosive material. so if you were to be standing at a \ndistance of about 300 meters from a detonation. would you first feel the \nschockwave, and then hear the sound, or would the sound be carried with the \nschockwave. maybe when you are standing 3000 meters away from a detonation \nyou could feel and hear the difference, a bit better. i'm realy curious how \nthis works, can anyone explain this to me?     .     \nplease excuse my english, it is not my native language.\ufeff",

            "text": "There's a lot of complicated physics and math involved, but think of it \nlike this -- if you have a long row of dominoes lined up, and knock over \nthe first one, it doesn't much matter how fast or slow you knock over the \nfirst one -- once things get going, the speed at which the line of dominoes \ngo down depends on the properties of the dominoes (how tall they are, how \nheavy, how far apart, etc.) not the speed or force with which you knocked \nover the first one.  Even if you kicked the first one very hard and it \nslammed into the first two dozen dominoes at high speed instead of just \ngently hitting domino #2, eventually the initial force will stop mattering \nand the rest of the dominoes will be falling at the usual speed typical of \nthose kinds of dominoes.  The case of sound in air is a bit more \ncomplicated, but the same idea holds -- the mass and density and elastic \nproperties of the air molecules will ultimately determine the speed that \nthe sound disturbance propagates through the air, regardless of the speed \nor force of the initial sound-making movement.  The force of the \nsound-maker will determine how MUCH the air moves (like the height of an \nocean wave can vary), but won't have any effect on how *fast* the \ndisturbance from the noise gets from one place to another.  The \"ripple\" \nthrough air happens at the same speed, just like the falling dominoes fall \nat a constant speed.",

In this case, wether you're using smoke and \nair, or air and air, you will see both substances. When a smoke ring moves \nthrough air, it displaces air while it travels, and the air it displaces, \nalso displaces air.
