Libya, Iraq, Ukraine, \nand in the shadow of the death of thousands in a failed state created by \nObama Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and now Ukraine. US is in turmoil lost all \nmorals as Bush and his dad and Obama with the Clintons wanted to build a \ncastle on pillars of sand and it collapses as a country and society \ncollapses that built on lies. Obama? Gave democracy to Libya he was very \nproud after he bombed destroyed the richest African country and turn it \ninto a land of savages. Peace prize? War and Death prize. We lost Aaron \nSwartz and many others thanks to this man. Sorry for the people of US not \njust blacks, whites all americans as you are lied, tricked and used and \nyour fake leaders are giving a very bad reputation to you and destroying \nmany lives around the world causing great damage due to their violent war \npolicies. It is coming to catch up with you as you are weak to get united \nand serve justice and peace. You are weak and divided. I am sorry for you \namericans and also I am afraid of your insane leaders as they have their \nhands on dirty weapons that should not even exist. Obama? Bush? Poppy Bush? \nBandar Bush? Clintons? They all have no guts to tell you the truth about \n9/11 as the truth is so ugly and they afraid of the truth as the truth \nalways prevails sooner or later but they will be destroyed by their coward \nguilty silence and lies. No not one president should be name after JFK as \nthere was no president of the USA after JFK. These guys are crooks coward \nliars. Jet Fuel isn't it? Its an insult for me and the public to even \nassume that we are so dumb we believe all your stupid weak lies like Jet \nFuel fire... you should have known better that state such a ridiculous \nnonsense. Facts and physics never lies. CIA highjacked all for sale \ndictatorship country where all is nothing but profit is God. Matter over \nmind...see if that will work and for how long? I speak 5 languages and \nwatching these 5 nations Spain, Germany, England, Russia, Hungary. Its bad \nnews for liars in the US as we are not stupid and we know our history you \ncannot fool us. This game is not yet over but US already lost it, long time \nago. Money can't buy you love! And you don't need the weathermen to tell \nyou from which way the wind blows!\nIts a sad joy of knowledge and I am not happy to see what I see and will \nsee!\nGod Bless America, The Constitution and the Oath-keepers!\ufeff",

Stand up for what you believe no matter how \nunpopular, no matter how you are treated for it. Never sell out your soul \nfor popularity. Think, consider your fellow man and do not become victim of \ndehumanizing propaganda that turns us into puppets to the will of a \nmilitary industrial complex that feeds only itself.\n\nJust my take I suppose, but I listen to alot of Dr. West. You cant sound \nbyte him, his points are too deep. Listen to a whole lecture and learn what \nhe really has to say.\n\nAnd when Bush was president they were there even louder, sorry that you \nintroduced yourself to him so late, catch up!",
