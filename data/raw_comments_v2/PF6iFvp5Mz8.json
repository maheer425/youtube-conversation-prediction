That'll take time that could be \nbetter spent filling this response with bullshit excuses. Lol. Hope you \nrealize, by your own logic, you're whining like a child by asking me to do \nthis, but if you insist.. I'm not just talking out my ass, so I don't need \nto be convinced to validate my statements. \n-'ISIS's leader was released by Obama in 2009.'\n-'You're going to jails if you don't buy healthcare.'\n-'The science on climate change was \"fabricated\", and the scientists lied.'\n-'Benghazi.'\n-'The death panel.'\n-'Texas is considering removing mention of Christmas/the Constitution from \ntextbooks.'\nDo you need more? Those were just the ones that I (actually) had from \nmemory, I'm sure I could find plenty more. \"A real discussion\", don't make \nme laugh. They have guests on to yell over and bully; there is no \ndiscussion. And you honestly don't think FOX reports exclusively \nconservative viewpoints? The ONLY thing they do on their station is \nperpetuate false realities. You're so unbelievably hypocritical. \n\n\n",

Conservatives are more likely to watch the news and \nthey are more likely to watch it more often and for a longer period of \ntime, so that they have something to pound their drum about; so, of course \nthe ratings for conservative `news`, and I use the term loosely since \nconservatives, in general, do a fuckin' lot of fear, hate, scare, rumor & \nsmear mongering, on television and radio! Whereas liberals, by and large \nand especially in comparison to conservatives, are more willing to live & \nlet live, live & let die, let ppl to go their own way, agree to disagree. \nEtc.\n\nLiberal fundamentalists do exist. But, there just aren't as many of them \nbc, they have less of a reason to exist... I.e., liberals, by and large \nand, again, especially in comparison to conservatives, don't go nuts on \nreligion!

The lack of decent news casting \nwhere news is reported, rather than analyzed with a severe bias is nearly \ndead in our time. Fox isn't exempt from this issue but it isn't the only \naspect of the issue. Perhaps I wouldn't be bothered so much by what TYT \nsays if it wasn't for the severe amount of arrogance and sarcasm that comes \nwith there tone. They complain about hard right fanaticism when they \nhypocritically are supporting left wing fanaticism. They rarely take input \nfrom people with slightly apposing ideologies without labeling that person \nas \"ignorant\" or \"bigoted\", and it is for these reasons that I consider TYT \nto be filled with \"bullshit\" in its analysis and methodology of reporting \n\"news\".\nHave a nice day and as always \"Don't forget to be awesome.\" - vlogbrothers  ",

            "text": "+donsimusprime Before we continue, let us make sure that it is understood \nthat there is only one set of data, reflected on two charts, that the only \ndifference in the charts is the value of the bar and that this one set of \ndata on a chart is aired twice. The first airing of the chart is what I am \nreferring to. The first time Fox showed the chart, each bar is worth \n200,000 therefore technically the chart IS correct. The second time the \nsame data on a chart is aired, each bar is 1 million, which is what you are \nreferring to.\nFurthermore my comment was that \"technically the chart is correct\" - a \nperson reading my comment would assume that I was referring to the first \nshowing of the chart as the second showing came with an apology. There is a \nsaying that to assume is to make \"an ASS out of U & Me\" - but this blonde \njust passed class. Peace.",
