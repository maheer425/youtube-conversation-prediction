Women are so objectified in the media and in \nreal life also, just look at the music videos and the magazine cover's of \nwoman celebrities' \"hot bikini bodies\" or \"shocking cellulite\" etc. Woman \nnudity all over the rappers' (and in other genres') music videos, and the \nguys just sit there with their hoodies and caps, \"like a boss\", while the \nwomen just seem to be the decoration.\nSome women choose to be strippers. And so do some guys, like the ones \nplayed in this movie. And who am I to judge them for their decisions?\nBut what makes me so fucking angry, is that when ONE mainstream movie (this \nright here), that has male strippers, come to theaters, and women enjoy \nwatching it (I know I do), men start to whine about how objectifying it is.\nLike, boo fucking hoo :DD\ufeff",
