The \nidea was the same as it was during the first and second Triumvirate and the \nborder that was chosen was actually quite the same as it was during the \nsecond Triumvirate. And it was by far not uncommon for Greek culture to \nhave a huge influence on Rome because even though Romans despised Greek \npolitics they loved their culture and their art. Richer Romans actively \nlooked for Greeks as teachers for their children, they copied Greek \nsculptures and were heavily influenced by Greek architecture. No wonder \nthat the Eastern Roman Empire covering all of ancient Greece was a bit more \ninfluenced by Greek culture than the Western Roman Empire. Oh and by the \nway: Venice and other villages in the lagoon were actually outposts of the \nEastern Roman Empire in Italy when the \"Barbarians\" already conquered the \nrest of Italy and the former Western Roman Empire.\n\nAs it was said in the video: Roman Empire assimilated other cultures and \ncivilizations. They had no problems with different religions (as long as \neveryone also worshipped the state cult next to their own beliefs and those \nown beliefs had to be worshipped publicly - they were paranoid about \nsecrets and conspiracies). Still, there were lots of Roman citizens that \ndidn't speak any or maybe just little Latin in the provinces and yet they \nwere Romans.

Even though in some cases they were enough to leave \nsome traits, passed on to their progeny: that explains the unusual rate of \nblonde haired and green/blue eyed people in Sicily, for example, as it was \nconquered and held for quite some time by the Normans, which evidently had \nquite a few 'adventures' with the population.

            "text": "+Old Boris Rome fell because the whole economical system was based on \nexpansion and at some point the empire extended to its limits and was \nbarely governable. The problem lies deep inside Roman society. It all began \nwith a city state that grew in size and power. At that point it was no \ndifferent to the greek polis. It extended and gained power over cities \naround it and at some point over most of Italy. Yet Rome never changed its \nlaws or its political system. So they had a city state that ruled an \nempire. The problem became more and more severe the larger the empire \nbecame. No wonder actually as only Romans, meaning full citizens were \nallowed to vote and to influence politics. How can someone expect that \ncolonies would accept being part of an empire with a \"democracy\" barely \nanyone was allowed to take part in. There were riots over and over again \nand the Roman Republic became quite unstable (think of the Servile Wars or \nthe Social War between 90 and 88 BCE).\n\nAnd then there was Caesar. It was not in any way different compared to what \nwas said in the video: his soldiers were loyal to him and only to him. His \ninfluence grew and so did his troops in numbers. He gained popularity \nduring his conquest of Gaul and when one of his fellow members of the first \ntriumvirate died (Crassus) both Ceasar and Pompeius fought over gaining \npower over Rome. Well, Ceasar won but he was too direct. He was less of a \npolitician and more of a general. So he was murdered by Republicans. His \nadopted son Octavian, who later on called himself Augustus, was way more \nclever. He never really cared about the laws if breaking them promised to \nbe of advantage (i.e. publicly revealing Marcus Antonius' last will before \nhe died to discredit him as not being Roman due to his wish of being buried \nin Egypt - not a clever move, Marc!), but he was really good in pretending \nto have reinstated the Republic. Well - that was just a show. And he was \ntotally aware of him just being an actor. It is said that on his deathbed \nhe quoted the closing lines of Greek comedy (actually in Greek): \u00bbIf all be \nright, with joy your voices raise, In loud applauses to the actor's \npraise.\u00ab (see http://tinyurl.com/n5cen2v for full translation and original \nin Greek)\n\nEven though Augustus did reform the political system of the Roman \nEmpire/Republic and gave far more people in the provinces Roman \ncitizenship, he did not or could not change anything about the basic \nproblem: the centre of the empire was still the city of Rome and the Empire \nhad become far too big to be effectively ruled from Rome. It would have \nbeen necessary to switch to a federal system to actually keep everything in \norder. Maybe Augusts knew that this would have been too much for Rome to \ntake and he would have faced a similar fate as his stepfather did.\n\nIt all went well as long as the Roman Empire could expand and gain land and \ntreasures from the areas around it. That was the Roman idea: conquer the \nknown world! Well, too bad for them they actually encountered serious \nenemies at some point. Neither could they go past the Rhine nor could they \nhold the areas beyond Hadrian's Wall (well, there was actually also the \nAntonine Wall about 120km to the north). The west was conquered in total \nand in the east there were the Persians they could fight against but it \nwould have been a ridiculous idea to actually conquer all of Persia so that \nwas off the table as well. The Empire could not grow any further and \ntherefore it lacked the loot, the fresh servants and new cultivable land.\n\nSo basically it all comes down to one simple problem: their business plan \njust sucked and it had to fall apart at some point. Maybe the first startup \ndisaster in history \u2026",
