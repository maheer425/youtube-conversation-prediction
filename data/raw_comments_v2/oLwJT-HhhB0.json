John Green \ndiscusses here the importance and role of editors, which is much more than \nsplicing commas and trying to make us take out that 50 page monologue about \nthe way the sun sparkles on the water in high summer. I think editors \nprobably get a bad wrap from writers, including myself because we kid \nourselves that somehow we are the writers of beautiful verse and that \neditors want to hack and slice at the poetry until it becomes a 1980's \nElectronica remix that will ultimately be more commercially viable but ugly \nand plain. The reality is that editors do much more than simple grammatical \ncorrection or text de-beautification (yes that's a word now, I just made it \na word). Editors are essentials in assuring that the reader's journey is \nsmooth and the experience never takes them out of the insane and \nimaginative world that we have created. It's not just plot holes and \nsentence structure, it's ensuring that the themes and concepts beneath the \ntext are fully formed and make internal sense.\n\nIn other news.....Stormtroopers is one word.
