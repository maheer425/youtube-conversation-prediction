Get a few interior brushes \n(ive impovised too) and lots of decent microfiber towels.\n\nI used to own some kinda crappy cars and although I'd always keep them \nreally clean, actual detailing was the last on my list of interests or \nlikes... now owning a relatively expensive car, it is really nice to work \non the car to maintain it and learning techniques to do it.",

I use a good carpet cleaner in a spray bottle and scrub \nwith a brush then wipe dry with a micro fiber and avoid using water if I \ncan..a steam cleaner will be great for the job, Also look into using a \nOzone machine.. Also since its a BMW try replacing the cabin air cleaner, \nand assuming you have a 5 series with a sun roof make sure the sun roof \ndrip rails are free from clogs and water is not over flowing some place \nelse and soaking into the carpets during heavy rains. 7 Series cars are \nnotorious for water running into the glove box and soaking the passenger \ncarpet. Once you get the carpet soaked, it has dried getting the old funky \nsmell out is quite the chore to be 100%",
