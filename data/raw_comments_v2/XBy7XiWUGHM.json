Every day no matter how much time it might take I must ALWAYS \ndraw or I will curl up in a tiny ball, find the nearest cliff, and THROW \nmyself down to the rocks where I will face my doom. Also, sometimes in \nschool I know that it will probably affect my grades but I just draw \ninstead of learning or doing my work, but I have to bring my big pink diary \nto school so I can't risk the teachers catching me so I have to be SUPER \ncareful. Or other times, i'm in music class and I can't bring my diary with \nme so I search my folder, look for a piece of blank paper and draw whatever \nI can on it! Also, if I don't have to turn it in, whenever the teacher \nhands the class work to do I always sketch a little comic on it or anything \nI want! ERMERGERSH and you KNOW what it's going to be like when you have \nart class. So your just minding your own business like a normal human being \nwhen someone comes up to you and says, \"WHAT U DRAWING IM A STALKER AND I \nWOULD LIKE TO KNOW!!! :D!!!\" I mean seriously, I know your interested just \na little bit but I'm trying to do my own thing here. It also burns SO \nBAD!!! when your drawing or writing something extremely personal instead of \nworking, when all of a sudden the teacher says, \"Okay time to turn your \nwork into me just to let you know I will scan every bit of it and if you \nhave something abnormal on your paper I will come up to you, show it to the \nwhole class, read it out loud, and give you an F. No pressure guys!\" \nBLEAHH!!!!!!!!!!!! One time when I had finished my work, I flipped my paper \nover to the back and wrote about how awful one of my psychopathic \nclassmates are, how they literally tell people to commit suicide, scream at \nthem, punch them, and stab them with their pencil while the teachers see \nthis perfectly well, and see how kind he is bringing death and pain to \neveryone. My teacher looked at mine, and was like, \"Who's is this?!\" And \neveryone in the class says, \"IT WAS HERS J#KNJ$BFJKHFIJRIO#LRIO#HFKJ!!!!!!\" \nAnd so all the attention is on me now and I am just dying right in the \ncenter of the class wishing that I could shoot myself in the head or throw \nmyself out the window. AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI know this is really long, but I can't keep in a lot of things :p\ufeff",
