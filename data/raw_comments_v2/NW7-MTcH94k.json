I \nhad a car accident also 12 years ago and I had herniated disc on my neck, \nmy left hip dropped and my pelvis misaligned seriously. All my joints in my \nbody loosen up. And I had scar tissue all over my body. I also had somebody \npull out from intersection right in front of me. I am still working on \nhealing by Chinese adjustment and physical therapy in a very good gym by \nprofessional therapist. Keep up the good work. Nothing can stop your \npassion. I hope you will heal up fully and life a pain free life. I never \ngive up on healing, and I believe I will be healed one day. Recommend you \nto watch \"The Secret\" DVD, there was a man went through an small air plane \naccident and doctors said he would become vegetable. He couldn't even \nbreath on his own in the hospital. He kept telling himself everyday \"breath \ndeep and he kept vision himself could walk out of the hospital. Finally \nmiracle happened, he walked out from the hospital. He made it.\ufeff",

Was there \nanother car in front of him that he wanted to pass? Or was he just a \nbonehead? Did he check his mirror? If so, did he not see another vehicle \napproaching at speed? I don't expect any answers, considering we don't know \nanything about the other driver. People don't pay attention, they aren't \nmindful of their surroundings. They don't check their mirrors before they \nchange lanes, (or they see you coming and cut you off anyway, just to be a \ndick...) they don't use turn signals, they speed up to pass you and then \ncut over six inches off your front bumper and hit their brakes, and when \nyou cuss them out they look at you with this \"Duh?\" expression on their \nface... They pull out right in front of you, cut you off, swerve into your \nlane, and then beep at you as though you did something to them. I'm \nthinking this other driver was distracted, or preoccupied, or? Texting, \nmaybe?\ufeff",

One learns after a while that it's very \ndangerous with such high speeds and to have much bigger safety margins, for \nexample to slow down on overtake on Autobahns with few lanes. Or when \ndriving at very high speeds to have one free lane between yourself when \novertaking much slower traffic.\n\nI can understand why you think all blame is with the other driver. But you \nhave to remember many cars on German Autobahns are from neighboring \ncountries with little experience from very high speeds, or how fast a car \ncan catch you at those speeds. To overtake another car at 3 times their \nspeed without the safety of a free lane inbetween is to ask for trouble. \nSpecialty during summer months you see a lot of tourists crossing Germany \nand see a lot of incidents with people crossing over to left and forcing a \nvery fast Porsche, BMW or Mercedes standing on the brakes.\n\nNext time please leave a bigger margine and enjoy the high speeds of \nAutobahns safely.

I \ncan\u2019t understand a couple of things:\n \na.) why did you use a 2 lane (4 lanes in every direction)  road for a drive \ntest with (you said) such a high speed that you achieve a difference \nbetween you and other cars of factor 4? Only about 15km (about 10miles) \nthere is the Autobahn to Munich with 3 (6) lanes and there is no speed \nlimit also and looooooong straight parts\u2026 I do high speed runs on this \nAutobahn and not at the this Autobahn where the accident happens.\n \nb.) I drive this part of Autobahn every week and I know there is a long \nleft corner where other drivers can\u2019t see you If you travel with such a \nhigh speed \u2013 I never drive this long corner with more than 160km/h (about \n100miles/h) exactly for this reason! If you drive faster \u2013 the others can\u2019t \nrealize you early enough to avoid a change to the left lane. Why they \nchange to left lane -> take a look at c.)\nc.) about 250m after the point where the crash happens there is a Autobahn \nexit - cars have to slow down to exit the Autobahn and so they let their \ncoast until the exit is near them. This always slows the traffic in this \npart of the road especially on the right lane. Here you have to change to \nthe left (and you change to left if there is no car, because there is a \nleft corner you can\u2019t see cars with higher speeds early enough\u2026 -> see \npoint b.!)\nd.) About 300m after the point where the crash happens there is a speed \nlimit of 100km/h (about 60mph) \u2013 it makes no sense to drive this fast to \nhit the speed limit with 280-300km/h.\n \nDid you drive the road first to take a look at bumps, speed limits or other \nabnormalities?\nI bless god that you, your passenger and the other driver wont killed at \nthis accident!

It's almost as funny as whenever you say \nyou're religious *everyone* automatically thinks you're a Christian, even \nthose that follow a different religion. One of largest unknown revivals was \nthe emigrants of Soviet Russia, of which the main reason stated by nearly \n85% of them for leaving was along the lines of \"If they pushed *that* hard \nday and night - even at school - to 'teach' us nothing except that the \nChristian God didn't exist, then how obvious is it that He does? I couldn't \nstay in a country that outlaws worship to the one true Ruler.\" The Bible \nsaid it would all happen.\n\nANYWAYS, great to see you recovering Jessi, and I hope Bjorn and the \nopposite driver/passenger are all doing well!

We were driving a 1976 Ford Maverick and the only reason I \nprobably survived was from being asleep in the back seat. My femur bone was \nshattered (doc said in over a dozen places) and when I awoke from the crash \nmy left foot was up near my left ear so I knew it was broken. I also feared \nlosing my leg because back then medical treatments weren't as advanced as \ntoday. I spent almost 10 months in traction with my leg being pulled apart \nby weights, full-length casts, then another several years in physical \ntherapy so I feel for you and the ordeal you are suffering.\n\nI remember the tears shed from pain I had when the therapists would force \nmy leg to bend from the muscle atrophy that limited my bending ability to \nonly 10 degrees. It was the most painful, long-term thing I had ever \nexperienced and basically felt like re-breaking my leg each session. \nIronically, the best therapy for me was riding a ATC 90 each day as it \nrequired me to bend that leg for sharp cornering and I did not notice the \npain as much. It took about 4 years of therapy, custom shoes and lots of \nriding before I regained my full motion and I am thankful to still be \nwalking at an age of 50 now without any real limitation. I sincerely wish \nyou a speedy completion to your rehabilitation and get more therapeutic \ntime back on the tracks where working those pedals will be  huge mental and \nphysical help. Cheers to you and your recovery. \ufeff",
