I never wanted to be here and I'm doing this for u. No \nbuying dogs!]and saw a cute German Shepard/chihuahua and fell in love. When \nwe asked my mom, however, she said no. We came back the next week, but \nfound out that the dog had already been adopted! Of course, we know about \nhypo allergenic dogs, but those shed too much. We can't get a big dog. We \nwant a chihuahua. My dad doesn't like chihuahuas... What can I do!?? \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13\ufeff",

I know at \nyour age you must want one bad! however you should wait because... often \n(depends what breed of dog you get) dogs need space, so living in a small \nhouse may not be the best, also dogs need a LOT of attention especially in \nthe first few months of adopting/buying one so if you are at school  and \nboth parents work, the dog may become destructive! May I suggest that you \noffer to dog-sit a friends dog for a weekend and see how that goes, also do \nsomething nice to help the dogs/animals in the pet shelters around you \n(this will show your parents that you are not just in some phase of liking \ndogs!) An when you get a dog (eventually) DO NOT get it from a pet shop, \nget it from a breeder or from even from a dog shelter! REMEMBER you will \nknow when its the right time to get a dog! GOOD LUCK, but remember it is \nactually cruel to get a dog just because you want one if you don't have the \nright living standards of responsibilities, so as hard as it will be ask \nyour self is it really the right time for a dog... nothing breaks my heart \nmore than cruelty to animals! +Alex Alvarez and +Purple Hawaii Gurlz also \nmaybe to +toaha ali \n\nSincerely ME!\nSources: Many years of experience with dogs, pets, working at dog shelters1",
