Both in your consciousness causing \ndistress, but also in place of the ability to run your usual programs like \nsnapchat or skyrim at all. It is like the CPU on your brain is maxed, while \nsaying \"HEY I'M MAXED AND HERE HAVE HORRIBLE THOUGHTS AND HORRIBLE \nFEELINGS, ALSO GOOD LUCK BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. ESPECIALLY NOT \nTHINK ABOUT ME\".\n\nIt is a block that you feel you should be able to get through with effort, \nbut it's more a downed bridge. You have to turn back around, and figure out \nanother cognitive process to get around it. Sometimes simple things can get \naround it, sometimes unrelated things can get around it. But once you \nfigure out a way around it that is effective, and use that as your routine \nin place of what you should be using mentally, it is like the block \ndisappears. And you notice it in the most unexpected ways. You can see \nthings you couldn't before, like pictures on the wall you didn't notice, or \nitems right in front of you at the corner store that were functionally \ninvisible to you. You see far more detail in the world, hear far more \ndetail, and can think about more complex things more easily. It's then you \nrealise that a serious OCD block is fucking terrible and it clearly \ndestroys your ability to function at a basic level in every day life by \ntaking up so much resource you can't even process things you see and hear \naround you, and you don't know you can't.\n\nBut there's nearly always a way around the block, and if you can't find a \nway around your OCD block, tell someone you trust about it, and see if \noffloading the task to them temporarily is effective. Because it is a \nlegitimate strategy.\n\nYou can work your way back from a terrible crippling series of blocks to a \nlife that feels normal and happy, relatively. But it takes not direct \neffort, it takes you realising that all of that direct effort can't work. \nAnd you have to circumvent whatever the particular ritual is, or the block \nis completely. Even if that means offloading the task to the agency of \nanother person for some time to just test.\n\nObviously I'm speaking from experience. But these are things it took me a \nvery long time to figure out. I went from unable to leave my room for 2 \nyears, to working in my favourite field wildly successfully in relative \nterms to what you believe you could ever do, internationally only 2 years \nlater.\n\nI know I wish I could have read this 20 years ago. It would have saved me \nyears of lost time, and given me years of quality of life I lacked. And I \nnever would have believed it could be this good.\n\nSo don't give up, one person who reads this a month from now, or 5 years \nfrom now who has this subtype of OCD, maybe doesn't even realise it. This \ncould help you, because if it helps just 1 person, it was fucking worth \nsaving them from the unbearable mental drain and pain, and horrible quality \nof life. Coupled with the emotional baggage that brings.\n\nYou can realise one night, the stars had been invisible to you before, but \nyou can see them now. The real stars. And god its beautiful :)\n\n<3\n\n#DFTBA\ufeff",
