Have you ever played \nwith the rumble motors in a controller?If you remove the motors and hook a \nbattery up, you can make it spin. Remove the battery and spin the rod \nmanually. it should spin fairly easily.\nHowever, if you touch the wires together from the motors so they connect \nwith each other and try to manually spin them, there's resistance.\n\n\nThis is because electricity in coils produces a magnetic field. Conversely, \na magnetic field in a coil can produce electricity in other nearby coils. \nBasically, if you spin one motor rod manually and fast enough, you can \nactually generate electricity to power the other motor. It doesn't work in \nall motors. I can't remember off the top of my head what they're called but \nthere is a type of motor that does this and others that don't\n\n\nIsn't science fun? xD",

For example, you have so many turns of wire on your primary \nand you put 120 volts onto it. The voltage flowing through the wire will \ncause a magnetic field to be created, the magnetic field will then induce \nvoltage into the secondary winding. To step down your voltage you use less \nturns on your secondary than your primary. To step up your voltage you \nincrease the number of turns on your secondary compared to your primary. \nHowever when you step up or step down your voltage, your amperage also \nrises or decreases in a opposite manner. When you step up your voltage your \namperage is reduced, and when you step down your voltage your amperage is \nincreased. That's why, in the second part of this video, he can put 240v \ninto his primary windings (2 transformers) and have 37 volts out of his \nsecondary, but his current is as high as 200 amps.",
