Sucked because I couldn't remover shit all I Remember was starting \nto trip then the etizolam kicked hard I bet it was an awsome time tho \neveryone said I was talking in some strange language that I made up and \nthat I was stuck in my chair and started freaking out because I guess I \nthought I was glued to the chair. My friend said that he carried out like a \nhalf and hour conversation of just weird ass sounds lol. Ah the days when I \nuse to get high. It was always fun when I had drugs, but when they were \ngone I just couldn't live. If it was entirely for me getting to a clnic and \nchanging everything around ide be dead or in prison. I miss making the \nmoney I did tho, but my wife ended up pregnate and my son became more \nimportant than anything else to me.
