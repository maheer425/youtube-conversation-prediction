            "text": "Firstly, I love these \"HISHE\" videos... very funny - this one included :)\nBut I really am wondering: whether or not you buy the idea that some random \ncancer patient has the moral right to torture complete strangers to death \n(I don't - I'd say it's something commonly known as *murder*), is everyone \nwho admires the \"oh-so-clever-and-original\" plot of \"Saw\" so young that \nthey have never seen \"Mad Max\"? Has nobody else spotted what a shameless \npiece of plagiarism Saw really is?!\nSaw basically completely ripped off its entire central theme from Mad Max - \nan iconic film of the 1980s, for all of you Saw fans out there who \nevidently either missed it or weren't even born back then. (It was actually \nmade in 1979, but gained popularity a few years later.)\nSaw's central plot device - i.e., will the two men choose to saw through \ntheir own limbs (quicker/easier but horrifying), or try instead to saw \nthrough metal (slower/potentially impossible with a weak blade) - is stolen \n100% from the ending of Mad Max. At the end of that film, Max, the central \ncharacter, handcuffs his opponent (called Johnny) by the ankle to part of a \nburning car's chassis, gives him a hacksaw, and tells him that, although he \n*might* be able to saw through the hardened steel chain of the handcuffs \nwith the blade, it would take 10 minutes - i.e., so long that the car would \nprobably explode first and kill him. Max also states that, on the other \nhand, there *would* be time - about 5 minutes - to saw through human bone \nwith the same blade - *possibly* before the car explodes. He then drives \naway from the scene, and the film ends with a shot of Max, now far away \ndown the road, as the car explodes in the distance. The audience never gets \nto find out whether Johnny decided to saw through his own ankle and escape, \nor to try to cut the chain and fail, thus dying in the explosion. No \nexplicit gore is shown during the whole end sequence (or the entire film).\n\"Mad Max\" is a classic \"hard-edged\" post-apocalyptic movie (not a horror \nfilm). \"Saw\" is a pathetic rip-off which is only popular because it is full \nof sick violent concepts and graphically depicted torture. Take that out, \nand almost nobody would have watched it - or any of its increasingly gross \n(and also increasingly dire) sequels, either.\ufeff",

Do a quick \ngoogle search for \"Life or Limb Decision\". Whether the character is under \npressure for short time because of enemies approaching/some other form of \ndeath coming soon, or no time constraint giving the character the ultimatum \nof starving to death or getting gangrene.\nI'm sure Mad Max even stole their idea from another source. You don't think \nout of all of the wars we've had on earth that no soldier ever once cut off \ntheir own limb to survive? Maybe they were captured and thrown in some \ndungeon/prison where they were chained down, but they were able to get free \nby losing a limb.\n\nAlso, Hollywood is BIG about punishing people for plagiarizing \nmovies/songs/books. If the producers of Mad Max really felt that Saw stole \nsomething from their movie, then Saw would have been sued. No lawsuit, then \nSaw didn't plagiarize.",

            "text": "Never knew that honestly. But there are many people who really love this \nseries and find it entertaining to them. Some people like movies with a lot \nof shock value in them, and Saw definitely has that. Whatever you want to \nthink about the series is your own opinion. I personally love the series. I \nrespect your opinion, but take a chill pill. You may offend someone like me \nwho is a big fan of the series (Which I'm not offended so don't worry.)\nThink about it this way. Saw 1 was a very low budget movie that probably \ndidn't know what a big horror classic it would become. You can also think \nof it as Saw giving Mad Max a little bit of a tribute. Or maybe it was \naccidental, we'll never know. What I do know is that they have very good \nwriters for the Saw films. The endings for the films still blow my mind and \nmake me cringe still to this day. Plus an amazing theme song may I say ;). \nAgain whatever you want to think about the films is okay. But I just feel \nthat you should be careful about knocking someones favorite series. Be more \ngentle :)\nAlso as a little note that I forgot to write.. Saw 1 (at least for me) \ndidn't have that much gore. I think 3 and on went for that increasingly \ngross gore you're talking about which I agree with. After 4 the Saw series \nstarted to decline a bit. Maybe it was because they were trying to hard to \nmake it into a \"gore porn\" to get more people to the theaters. Also I'm \nguessing that one of your favorite movies is Mad Max? XD \n(OHH OHH OHH! And one more final thing. Cancer was not the only thing that \ndrove Jigg Saw to become the person he is in the Saw movies. I won't say \nwhat it was because of spoilers :p)",
