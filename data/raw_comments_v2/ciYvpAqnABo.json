So, yeah, I would love to have  maintained \nthe insurance we've provided our family for the past 6 years independently \n(and, at much greater cost, through an employer for the previous 10 years), \nbut under the ACA (which, by the way, I DID support and which, yes, has \nhelped lots of our friends) our rate DOUBLED to the price of a MORTGAGE. :(\n\nThere are lots of challenges at play here. Chief among them seems to be \nthat, in our region, there's an insurance monopoly. That's right, the \ngovernment has mandated health insurance even in areas where there IS no \ncompetition. So, what happens? Oh, the rates go up. Why not? Who's going to \ndrive the prices down? But what if we can't afford those rates? WHO CARES!? \nIt's the LAW, and if we don't comply by buying INTO that monopoly we are \nFINANCIALLY PENALIZED! Wait. WHAT?\n\nSo....since we can't AFFORD the health insurance we previously purchased \njoyously and within our budget, we will be FINED. WHO WRITES THIS STUFF!?\n\nFurther, the government is subsidizing health insurance premiums (yup, \nusing taxpayer funds to pay INTO monopolies - that HAS to be illegal, \nright?) for some, at the expense of those whose rates have doubled (or \nworse) using an arbitrary income level. Odd that the IRS, a federal agency, \ndetermines our taxable income (the amount the feel is expendable) based on \nONE line, but the ACA determines the subsidy based on a DIFFERENT line. \nHmmmmm...\ufeff",
