It has to do with exactly what you said, \nas the cold slows down movement which can result in more powerful magnetic \nfields.\n\nThis get's demonstrated when putting an aluminum ring on a coil.  When \ncurrent is introduced, the ring will fly upwards.  If you cool the ring \nwith liquid nitrogen and repeat the experiment, the ring flies higher up.",
