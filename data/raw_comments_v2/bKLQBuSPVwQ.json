He uses \nimagination to get answers to his problem . He focuses on the solution . \nImagination is not your Iq .. it is your Eq . So this old guy was psychotic \nbecause , I guess he abused it ... but a very smart individual indeed . And \nhe teaches Patch Adams to do the same thing ... to focus on the solution \nnot the problem . If you think about it ... it's the Law of Attraction at \nwork here . The old guy even mentions something ... that Patch Adams is \nabout to change just because he came to him . Hope it helped you buddy !! ",
