It is also said that because of the Dwarves' great reverence for \nAul\u00eb their language remained unchanged, and all clans could still speak \nwith each other without difficulty despite the great distances that \nseparated them. Due to their reverence for their cultural heritage, the \nDwarves did not learn Khuzdul as a cradle-speech, as this might mutate the \nlanguage over time. Instead, Dwarves carefully learned Khuzdul through \nreverent study as they matured, to make sure that their language was passed \ndown unaltered from one generation to the next. The changeability of \nKhuzdul versus other languages was compared to \"the weathering of hard rock \nand the melting of snow\".'   -sourcehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzdul\ufeff",
