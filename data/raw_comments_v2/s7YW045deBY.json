            "text": "There is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, \nknown as the North American Man and Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). This is \na child molesting homosexual group whose cry is \"SEX BEFORE 8 BEFORE IT'S \nTOO LATE.\" This group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades \nacross the United States.\n\nHomosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the \nUnited States, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, \nmeans that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 \nheterosexuals is a child molestor. (Psychological Reports, 1986, 58, pp. \n327-37)\n\nThe Kinsey study of 1948, which homosexuals often cite to say that 10% of \nthe population is homosexual, actually says that only 4% of the population \nis exclusively homosexual. This study involved a disproportionate number of \npeople who had been in jail for sex crimes (hardly a random sample of the \npopulation). Kinsey also did perverse studies involving young boys and \npedophiles.\n\nBecause homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting \nchildren. Homosexuals can be heard chanting \"TEN PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH, \nRECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT\" in their homosexual parades. A group called the \n\"Lesbian Avengers\" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. They \nprint \"WE RECRUIT\" on their literature. Some other homosexuals aren't as \novert about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into \npositions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young \nchildren (e.g., the clergy, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, etc.)  See the DC \nLesbian Avengers web page, and DC Lesbian Avengers Press Release, where \nthey threaten to recruit little boys and girls.   (Fields, Dr. E. \"Is \nHomosexual Activity Normal?\" Marietta, GA.)\n\nMore fun and real facts WITH references here!     \nhttp://www.liveleak.com/view?i=03b_1429459575\ufeff",

You talk as if they \nhave to sit through a gay sex fest every night when their parents are gay. \nNormal people won't do that to kids. (and yes I include them gays when I \nsay normal people) There are ways to raise kids without always paying \nattention to what or where their genitals are. \n\nNow enough with the rant. Did you make your choice yet? What would be your \nsolution for them gays? \n\nNow read that list again and picture your own child being gay, which one of \nthose choices would you pick then?",

Also, not everyone \nwho has had sex with a member of the same sex is homosexual.  Things aren't \nblack and white, and I've seen that probably the majority of people are \nborn Bisexual.  Society pressures people into things.

Every Disney Princess is a man-hungry girly-girl.  And every \nknight in shining armor has his eye on the fair maiden.  Every love song on \nthe radio is about straight relationships.  And entire movie franchises are \nbased around a teenage boy and a teenage girl being in love and facing X \ndifficulty for it.\n\nFor years homosexuality was illegal, and when they couldn't convince people \nthat religion was all that was necessary to make it illegal, they declared \nit a mental disorder.  It is still punishable by death in several \ncountries.  You're fine with gays being married just as long as every \nsingle thing is private.
