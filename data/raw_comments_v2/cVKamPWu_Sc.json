            "text": "+Igor Bajic Freeride boards are usually stiffer and you usually want it \nlonger because that means it will be more stable. They usually always have \na directional stance meaning that the stance on the board is set back so \nyour tail is shorter than your nose.  This helps keep your nose up in the \nair so that if your are riding in deep powder your board naturally points \nup keeping it from catching.  Freeride boards are meant to really only go \nin one direction although it doesn't mean you can't ride switch.  If you \nare going to stay pretty much on groomers and mountain trails I would go \nwith a Freestyle board cause they are pretty versatile. Freeride boards are \nnot typically for groomers they are used more for back country.  I \npersonally like an all mountain freestyle with a mid flex because I can \nhard charge and have fun carving and also do some natural jumps or man made \njumps maybe some jibbing. Anyway, Evo can really help you choose the right \nboard. \nhttp://www.evo.com/how-to-choose-a-snowboard-size-chart-and-buying-guide.aspx#shape\nAnd I use this website sometimes to get some opinions on gear but don't let \ntheir opinions decide for you. http://thegoodride.com/",
