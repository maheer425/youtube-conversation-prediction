            "text": "This is true for all animals! No animal wants to be pet harshly or have \nsomebody's heavy hand drag across their body... especially if they're small \nlike a cat, a puppy, a bunny, a bird, or whatever the hell you want to pet. \nSame goes with an animal as big as a horse or cow... if you're going to pet \nand animal, respect it. Don't wipe your hands over the animal to the point \nwhere its eyes are being pulled to the back of it's head. Be gentle.\nI own pit bulls. People tell me all the time, \"Aren't you scared? They \nattack for no reason\". No, actually people miss the signs the dog gives. \nWhen your child is climbing on the dog and squealing in its ear and petting \nit roughly, the dog is toughing it out. But it can't do it for long. That's \nannoying for any animal to experience on a daily basis... bad for your \nmental and even physical health. Then one day the dog \"attacks out of the \nblue\" and the owners get rid of it. It's a shame because the owner is the \nirresponsible one. Put yourself in the dog's place. First, everybody is \nagainst your breed, so not many people have faith in you to begin with. \nSecond, there's this child annoying the hell out of you, and you're \nexpected to tolerate it the REST OF YOUR LIFE? No. It's time for the owners \nto get the child to stop and to help release that stress by walking the dog \nand playing with it.\nAll of this is pretty similar to a cat. As the video explained, cats really \ndon't 'attack' for no reason... and that's also similar with all animals. \nYou think a wolf is attacking your livestock for no reason!? No way... \nfirst, that land was the wolf's before it was yours. Second, that wolf is \nhungry and your livestock is a tasty meal. Third, you are a threat- plain \nand simple- and that wolf probably has a huge pack to protect.\nAll I can say is, ALWAYS respect animals. Love them. NEVER blame the \nanimal. You can't beat mother nature. We as humans are very uneducated when \nit comes to understanding this world. Granted, I'm just a 15 year old girl \nmyself and I have a lot to learn but at least I'm open minded and I'm \nwilling to understand more about this world. Most adults have a mental age \nyounger than my real age.\ufeff",

You pet her, and she reward you with drippings from her nose. \nMy second cat reward you with a tiny bit of purring. It is a lot to ask \nfrom him, because he isn't easily impressed. Then, when he is finally \nhappy, he will grab your hand, hug it tight to his chest, rubbing his face \non your palm, and BITE. My third cat is very special. He doesn't like you \nto pet him. I don't know what his problems are, but his body is very very \nsensitive. If you just poke his back gently, that piece of skin would jerk, \nthen he would lick it a bit. But, every night he would purr like a \ngenerator, and watch you while you sleep. He likes it if you rub his face \nwith a piece of cloth.\ufeff",
