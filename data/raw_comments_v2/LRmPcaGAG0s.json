Be nice, I thought cooking is for having fun and \nenjoy something together.\n\nI started mixing everything not good very early because as Ur Papa said I \nended up with chewing gum if I wasn't carefully enough and pressed out  all \nthe air while mixing, and it will mix up later good enough. But every time \nwe ate Gnocchi on holidays in Italy they are extremely fluffy so you need \nthe air more than the egg. The egg is only for the colour and a bit for the \ntaste, not for sticking it all together, if it would be, you would use the \nprotein of the egg. But the amylum of the potatoes is enough to keep it all \ntogether, and the flour is there to absorb some moisture. So everything is \nvery logical and I think the results will proof him right.\nI always did it with a lot more flour, but I think it is better how he did \nit, I really have to try it out for dinner today.\n\nMy trust in traditions relating to food is very big, and I think that is \nthe reason why grandma cooks best ;)",
