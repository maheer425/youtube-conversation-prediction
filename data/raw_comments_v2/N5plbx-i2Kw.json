Genes do not determine if you will go \nbald or gain weight or get cancer. There is no fucking gene that does this. \nThere's only a fucking gene that says mAke hair, there's no gene that tells \nyour hair to fall out. lol lol. People can be really be stupid sometimes \nbut I still love y'all. Nature(genes) is one form of gene transfer, \nnurture(tradition) is the second form of gene transfers. The reason why the \nson is most likely to go bald is because he's taking in the same pattern as \nhis father. Eating habits, living habits, work habits get the idea??????\ufeff",
