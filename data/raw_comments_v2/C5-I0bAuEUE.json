Looking at the \ncomments, there are many others who are equally as confused as I was.  \nHopefully this helps clear things up.\n\n1.  This is part TWO of a two video series.  This video only explains the \nanswer, and does not specify all the rules to the game.  At the beginning \nof this video, there is a box linking to the original video.  That video \nshould clear up all the rules to the game.\n2.  The \"31 %\" is NOT the odds of any single person finding their bill.  \nInstead, it is the odds of there being no \"chain\" greater than 50.  THIS IS \nIMPORTANT since each participant only has 50 tries to find their bill.\n3.  Every participant belongs to one of these \"chains\". \n4.  According to this strategy, everyone STARTS at the box that corresponds \nto their number.  So if someone is looking for a bill with a 5 on it, they \nstart at the 5th box.  By doing so, they are GUARANTEED to be in the \ncorrect \"chain\".  This is explained at 2:30. \n\nIf there is a 31% chance of there being NO chain greater than 50 boxes and \nevery participant BELONGS to a chain, then the group as a whole has a 31% \nchance of winning so long as they start at the correct box and follow the \nstrategy.

You assign all destinations a random number, and you start at a \ndestination mapped to a number. Every time a successful delivery is made, \nit generates another number which can be used for the next delivery \n(through the corresponding number). This generated number continues a chain \nthat is actually quite optimal.\n\nBelieve it or not, 58% of the time, it's actually faster this way to \ndeliver packages to houses than simply going to the next nearest \ndestination. \ufeff",
