            "text": "Not long ago we bought our second cat. Because my first male cat was fixed \nbefore puberty, he never had his territory and didn't really care about \nanything as long as he had food and some toys to play with.(he was a year \nand a half) When we brought a second male cat home (8months, also fixed \nbefore puberty) my first cat was really curious. I did locked them in \ndifferent rooms and kept switching their toys so they can get used to each \nother's smell. My new cat was really scared of everything and always hid \nunder things. In about two or three days he became more comfortable and I \nlet my first cat out. At first they avoided each other but I started \nfeeding them near each other and giving them yummy treats while they were \nnear each other. Right now it's almost 5 months passed and its like they \nwere born to be together. They play together and chase each other and just \ncan't get enough. We got our second cat for free from another family \nbecause he was bullied by his cat parents and he was too playful and his \ncat parents weren't. I think that my first cat is really glad that he has a \nlittle brother now. They almost the same age so their level of playing is \nthe same (but the little one is more playful) my first cat doesn't seem to \nmind at all. He also became less aggressive and doesn't scratch me at all \nwhen I pet him. They sometimes take a time off from seeing each other, my \nsecond cat likes to sleep under my bed when he feels bothered, it's like \nhis little safety spot. He's not always there, just when he's nervous. They \nhave two litter boxes and they both go in each of them. I live in a one \nbedroom apartment so it's only two rooms. My super cat highway is the top \nof my kitchen counters. They like to get there by jumping on a fridge and \nthen jumping up. I have connected kitchen to the living room so they can \nsee everything from up there. Love them both to death. Thank you so much \nfor all of your tips and help. I raised my first cat from his kitten age \nand raised him on watching your show. Both of them are so spoiled now they \nhave their own toy box and different tubes in which they can hide all \naround the apartment. Thank you for everything <3\n\ufeff",

The siblings get along fine, \nbut they pick on the newcomer mercilessly. My husband and I watch My Cat \nfrom Hell, and I've sent him this video twice already, but he still has the \n\"let them work it out\" mentality, or worse, \"If she would just fight back, \nthey'd leave her alone.\" I think my husband is the real problem here. I'd \ntake over training myself, but I'm in a wheelchair, attached to a \nventilator, and I have extremely limited mobility. I need help training my \nhusband before we can make headway with the cats!\ufeff",

I've \ngrown attached to the cat and after trying to rehome it myself I couldn't \nbring myself to put him in a shelter. My two cats seem unhappy about the \nsituation and whenever one seems to be having progress the other ends up \nfreaking them out. I have tried the introduction process but they have not \nresponded at the same rate.

Often, when one animal \nhas a health issue the others will stalk and sometimes attack.\n\nIf no health issues, do a reintroduction following the techniques in \nJackson's video.  It is possible that the integration of Maya was done too \nquickly for her.  If all that does not help, I would have her in another \nroom shut off from the other cats when you are sleeping or not home, so she \ncan have lots of peaceful, stress free time.  You might also try to find \nher a new home as an only cat, or in a home with just one other cat that \nhas a mellow temperament, and where you instruct the new  owners on doing a \nvery slow introduction.\n\nIn addition, when you feed them, don't have them all bunched up together.  \nThat leads to many cats eating too quickly for fear the others will nudge \nin to get the other's food. Eating too fast can wind up causing stomach \nupset and regurgitation/vomiting.",

Watch for any aggression aimed toward Maya - \nheavy staring, stalking, growling, hissing, or chasing -- and give the \naggressor a 10 minute timeout in  a carrier or the bathroom.  Then be sure \nto redirect aggression toward toys to play-out those predatorial energies \nbefore Maya can be victimized again.

You \ndo the second part by visiting cat-owning friends with your pup on lead \ninside the house, ensuring no chase can take place.   Then, you review all \nbasic obedience commands to get your dog to ignore the cat and focus on \nyou.    Then you practice quiet, calm behavior while standing on your dog's \nleash.

We \npicked him up and brought him down, but he kept looking at the spot where \nhe met the kitten and went back upstairs. I'm worried because downstairs is \nwhere is food is and he has barely been eating , and also because i can't \nintroduce them correctly if he doesn't come down(the kitten is separate in \na room downstairs).Im concerned the older cat will always remember their \nfirst meeting and never get along with the kitten. How can I get my older \ncat comfortable with coming back downstairs? If anyone has any advice I \nreally appreciate it. \ufeff",
