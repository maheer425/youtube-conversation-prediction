This is what happens when you give monkeys the \nintelligence of a man to play with...relatively speaking. So when will \nphysics correct the symmetry in time Einstein reversed and accept his \nintuition that there are no dice as shown when you reverse it? Why did \nSLAC's E158 data 2.48e-5 in 453.6 miles (with .20e-5 reverse arrow comma) \nmatch CERN's neutrino data @ v-c/c=2.48e-5 in the forward arrow of time? \nWhy did SLAC verify the asymmetry in time a year later after CERN invented \na loose cable? Why do photons show the same asymmetrical gain in time \ncaused by the \"loose cable\"?  Maybe you should do another one hour physics \nvideo and slow down so you can look around and see what you are missing in \ncurrent events.\ufeff",

It always takes n + 1 satellites for n number of SPATIAL \ndimensions. It has nothing to do with time, or the fact that points could \nbe moving. It all has to do with geometry.\n\nTake a straight line for example - that represents 1 spatial dimension. If \nyou use only one satellite, how would a measurement go? Well, the satellite \nsends a signal, and your receiver receives the signal one second lighter. \nAll the information you have now is that you are 1 light-second away from \nthe satellite - but which direction? It could be left, or right of it on \nthis line. That's why you need 2 satellites - to cross out one possibility \nand narrow down your location.

Then it gets a crossing point, which shows its own position..\"\n\nUnder the section \"How GPS works\". I think the source 'ought' to be \nreliable, given it's owned and worked by the university of copenhagen\n\nBut that it takes four referencepoints and not three, to find a point in 3d \nspace, is right. Now that you're saying it, and after I've given it some \nthought, I can see the truth of it. And that has lead me to wonder.. Both \non how it can then be, that it takes three sattelites to find the crossing \npoint (as they describe it). but also how he in the video says it requires \n4 sattelites (given that he considers the space to be 4d - making it \nrequire 5 referencepoints).\n\nI don't know.. but I'm thinking, that if they take three sattelites, they \nshould be able to somewhat determine the true crossingpoint, knowing that \nearth is somewhat round in shape. Cause two spheres will make a circle of \ncrossingpoints and using a third sphere, will create two crossingpoints \nwith the before found circle of crossing points. This would then make two \npossible positions. But as the earth is somewhat round in shape, we should \nbe able to make approximations of which positions could be true (knowing \nthe center and avg. radius to the surface). So in other words, we could \njust consider earth to be our fourth sphere, though it isn't. If doing so, \none of the crossing points position could be determined a possible \nposition, and one wouldn't. But that would be a flawed approach for sure.. \nand that also raises the question, why not just use four sattelites for a \nbetter approach.\n\nSo I don't know, perhaps it really does take four sattelites, or perhaps \nthere's a better solution to doing this, using only three sattelites.",

I \nthink referencelists should be considered mandatory, for youtubers making \neducational videos.. Some claims are questionable, and in those cases it \nwould be nice to be able to review their sources.\n\nAs an example:\nThe claim that 4 sattelites are needed, was a claim that I would have liked \nto review. Cause from what I've heard and read, it only takes three \nsattelites and that also seem intuitively true. A user recieves three \nsignals, from three sattelites. Given the time it took for the reciever to \nrecieve the signals, the distance between reciever and sattelite can easily \nbe calculated as t*c. Now knowing the distance, you can create circles, \nfrom the point of the sattelite, with the radius being the distance. \nCreating three of these, you can triangulate the reciever, in our three \ndimensional space. But then there's special and general relativity, saying \nthat our measured times are different, so we got to take that into account. \nBy knowing the relative velocity between our inertial frames, the one we're \nin and the one the sattelite is in (orbiting earth), we could account for \nthe time dialation casued by the special relativity (t' = lorentz \nfactor*t). With the distance between the earth and the sattelite, we could \nalso account for general relativity - or at least as far as I know, cause \nI'll admit to not really knowing much about general relativity. But \nanyways, if these former mentioned are true, we should be able to 'convert' \nour time into their time (the GPS's time). And so, I do not see a reason \nfor the need of a fourth GPS and that creates an uncertainty of the \nvalidation of the information (at least I get uncertain)..\n\nBut it's just a general thing, that I don't understand why they don't fix \nIt. Cause it doesn't seem like much extra work.. And I feel fairly certain \nthat they do spent some time on researching before making these videos, and \nthat in itself should provide them with sources.. ",

Could get the \nsame general effect with mechanical clocks if you consider air pressure \nproviding resistance on the gear movement. (I reserve the right to be 100% \nwrong as this is 100% guess)",
