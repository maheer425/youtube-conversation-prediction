Brene Brown's book The Gift of Imperfection talks \nabout sharing shame with appropriate compassionate friends, because telling \nthe story of shame takes the power away from it. Shame festers and grows \nwhen it's kept secret. Sharing helped me, personally. Debilitating anxiety \nshowed up last September, and I was ashamed of it. I didn't start to \novercome it until I was willing to admit to those closest to me about what \nI was going through. When I tried to hide the anxiety, I was also denying \nto myself that it exists, and we can't overcome something that we're not \nwilling to admit is real. The more willing I have been to admit to the \nanxiety in public, especially in front of strangers who I would rather have \na good impression of me, the less power it has had over me.",

            "text": "I agree with your first point Adam - researchers do tend to study concepts \nthey don't understand, or perhaps lack themselves. Brene has admitted as \nmuch in her earlier TED talks. She said vulnerability didn't come naturally \nto her, and she suffered a breakdown when her findings contradicted her \nbeliefs. Her story was a confession that she was avoiding or protecting \nherself from vulnerability.\n\nShe shared this in a very public forum. By sharing this, she was BEING \nvulnerable. There she was, on stage, in front of hundreds of people, \nsharing her story, her life, her research, her vulnerabilities, admitting \nher breakdown - it doesn't get much more vulnerable and authentic than \nthat. \n\nSo, Adam, she was leading by example. She was being vulnerable while \ntalking about vulnerability. She was sharing what she had learned, from \nboth her research, and her life, so that others may also learn, appreciate \nand embrace their own vulnerability. \n\nClearly from everything else you have written, you are experiencing your \nown vulnerability brought about by the various issues that you are clearly \nvery passionate and concerned about. Clearly you are concerned with how \nvulnerable the environment is, and that is admirable.\n\nI don't believe your personal attacks and critical assessments of others \nare warranted or helpful, however they do suggest to me that you possess a \nnumber of vulnerability shields. Perhaps your concerns would be better \nserved by learning to lower your shields, sharing your concerns with other \nlike-minded people, and directing your efforts towards helping the \nenvironment, rather than directing criticism and abuse towards people.
