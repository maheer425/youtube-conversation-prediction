            "text": "I am so tired of hearing the \"something can't come from nothing\" rant, that \nI feel like i really need to clear this shit up.\n\nThe term \"something coming from nothing\" is misinterpreted by the vast \nmajority. Nothing is to be considered as a state of absolute zero, a \nbalance point of energy, like balancing something on the edge of a knifes \nblade, with an inclination of zero degrees. Like the object you are \nbalancing on the knifes edge, the singularity which was the state of our \nuniverse before the Big Bang, is a balance of energy; positive energy on \none side, negative energy on the other (don't take it all literally since \nit's an analogy). The positive and negative states of energy are \nrepresented in matter and antimatter, and we have observed what happens \nwhen matter and antimatter collide with each other, and the result is that \nthey both pop out of existence, and we have also observed matter and \nantimatter pop into existence. It is very probable that if you add up all \nthe positive and negative energy in our universe, it would reveal that it \nwould all amount to an amount of energy equal to zero. This means that we \nare basically still living in a universe which you could consider to be \n\"nothing\" - hence the laws of energy balance are not violated, and it is \npossible to explain how the universe came into existence.\n\nNow, let's clear up a few more misconceptions which I have noticed in the \ncomment section to this video.\n- The Big Bang was in fact not a bang, it produced no sound and it was not \nan explosion, it was merely a rapid expansion.\n- Time did not exist before the Big Bang, time is not a steady unit, it is \nmerely a term used to describe the way the human brain percieve different \nprogressions and different variations in states of matter in the universe. \nThe term \"time\" is not a single unit - space and time are one and the same, \nhence the term spacetime, and both time and space can be warped and \ndistorted (time can change speed, space can change shape), which we can \nobserve by looking at galaxies in telescopes, where light is warped around \nfor instance a black hole.\n- The Higgs Boson is not what gives particles mass. The Higgs Boson is \nmerely an exitation of the Higgs Field, and the mass of a particle is \ndetermined by how much it interacts with the Higgs Field. The boson is - as \nI just mentioned - an exitation of the Higgs Field, and it is the only part \nof the field that is currently measureable, which means that the discovery \nof the Higgs Boson confirms the existence of the Higgs Field, which \nconfirmes the standard model, and our theory on why and how particles have \nmass.\n\nThis comment turned out to much longer than I intended it to be, but I hope \nit answered some of your questions, and made you consider new things. :)\ufeff",
