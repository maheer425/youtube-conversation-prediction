Hence the name \"Pea nut butter\"\nStep four: You need bread so why not use a bagel?\nStep five: Put everything together (It doesn't matter what order, The jelly \ncan be on the outside and the bagel on the inside) and eat (If you dare).\nStep six: Ask your self if you can trust my recipes again.\ufeff",

            "text": "You can make a PB&J any old way, but it takes time (and possibly some \neffort and money) to make a really great tasting sandwich.   \n\nStep 1: Toast bread until lightly golden brown (this works best if it is \nfreshly frozen first) - I know that doesn't make too much sense, but think \nof fresh bread which has just been put into a largely open space in the \nfreezer, or just toasted for less time. It doesn't matter too much what \nkind of toaster you use, so long as you use good bread and get it right \n(for the amount of time). I recommend California or French Sourdough bread. \n   \n\nStep 2: Have all of your materials ready: Cascade, Smucker's Jam (or any \nother kind of jam with very little or no preservatives - organic, perhaps) \n- it works best if it is this way for the peanut butter and jam, or if both \nare homemade, and this works best not only for your health, but greatly \nimproves taste as well. DO NOT BUY MIXES IF YOU WANT YOUR SANDWICH TO TASTE \nVERY GOOD. I recommend Mara Natha Crunchy peanut butter, or you could put \nfresh peanuts (and yes, there is a great deal of difference between fresh \nand greatly stale) - on top of creamy peanut butter, or make it homemade \n(just grind the peanuts up with a very small amount of oil and salt). \n\nStep 3: Mix your peanut butters before hand if desired (if you have two or \nmore to mix) Same with the jelly (MIX SEPARATELY)\n\nStep 4: Immediately after the bread is toasted to your desired state \n(lightly golden brown recommended), remove the hot toast, put it on a \nplate, and lightly butter both slices with soft butter (Trade Winds \nrecommended). The oil separates the PB&J from the bread.\n\nStep 5: Spread the desired amount of peanut butter on one slice, and \nroughly the same amount of jelly on the other.  \n\n\nPresto! (well not quite so fast, but) we made a good sandwich.\ufeff",
