(Think: 12 = \n2*2*3, a product of 3 primes.)\n\nSo we generalize the notion of product to be for any finite set of natural \nnumbers (this works well because of the commutative and associative \nproperties of multiplication).  So this allows us to multiply more than 2 \nnumbers together at a time, but we also extend the definition in the other \nway.  A product of one number is that number itself, and a product of zero \nnumbers (the empty product) is 1.\n\nSo 2 = 2 is writing 2 as a product of primes.
