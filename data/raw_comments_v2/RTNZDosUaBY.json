            "text": "+Debbie .Taylor 1) I got the feeling that you meant religion by saying \n\u201censlaved to God\u201d, and lmfao. There is more evidence for the existence of \nGod than there is for yours such as the fact  that the universe had a \nbeginning and it\u2019s not eternal as it was once thought which means there \nmust have been a sufficient cause to bring the universe into existence. In \nfact, time, space, and matter all began at the big bang which means that \nthe cause is immaterial, eternal, and transcendent, a God. More evidence is \nthe fine-tuning of the universe. The fundamental constants are so precise \nthat if you changed them just a tiny bit, the universe would literally \ncease to exist. How precise? Take for example the cosmological constant. If \nit would have been faster by just 1 in 10^122, the universe would have \nexpanded too fast at the beginning of the expansion and would have \ncollapsed back onto itself, if it was slower by 1 in 10^122, the universe \nwould have expanded too slow to ever formed galaxies, stars, and planets. \nTo put that number into perspective, imagine a blind man and ALL the atoms \nin the entire observable universe. One atom represents the right \ncosmological constants, the blind man would have to pick that atom among \nthe trillions and trillions and trillions of atoms. There are about 10 more \nof these constants that are on a knife-edge to allow order and complexity \nin the universe.More evidence is the digital code in DNA. The chemical \nbases in DNA that code for functional proteins are running just like zeros \nand ones in a computer program or alphabetic characters in a written \nlanguage. When you see a message written in the sand beach, you wouldn't \ninvoke the ocean ties to explain it would you? You obviously would assume \nit came from an intelligence, yet there are more than 1000 books worth of \ninformation in the simplest living cell. All precisely arranged in \nmeaningful and precise sequence. Anytime we\u2019ve found specified information \nlike this and traced it back to its source wether it was in the form of a \nnewspaper article, a computer program,a hieroglyphic inscription or encoded \nin a radio signal, there was always an intelligent agent behind that \ninformation,<---------- Obliterating your argument.\n\n2) Are you really bringing up the already refuted argument from evil? \nLmfao. In order for free will to exist, evil has to exist. We are not \nrobots, God created creatures with free will. It would be a \nself-contradiction if evil didn\u2019t exist. A loving God has to be able to \nallow evil so that people can have free will and  also come in a loving \nrelationship with him as well. We are not God\u2019s pets. Your argument is \nlaughable at best, and you don\u2019t even realize that this argument enforces \ntheism and not atheism. Congratulations, you refuted yourself. Lol. Oops ;)\n\nTry again.\n  ",
