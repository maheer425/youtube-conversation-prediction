I was the first student to arrive, so I \ntook a seat in the front row of the classroom. I had been waiting at least \n45 minutes for someone to show up but still nobody had come in yet. It was \njust me sitting in there by myself. So to pass the time, I figured I would \nlisten to some music. I was listening to the song Justin Timberlake made \nfor SNL called \"Dick in a Box\", and because I had been waiting in there by \nmyself for so long, I kept replaying the song. By the third time that I \nreplayed the song, I had actually begun to sing along a little bit. \nNormally when I sing a song, I sing in a silly voice so it doesn't look \nlike I take myself too seriously. But because I actually like the song and \nfind it catchy, I was singing along quite passionately. I was using some \nreally good headphones that day too, so I couldn't hear anything but the \nsong. Due to the fact that I was sitting in the very front of the room and \nthe entrance to the class was in the very back of the room, I had failed to \nnotice that the room was steadily filling up with students behind me while \nI was passionately singing along to a song about presenting my genitals in \na box. It was only until someone sat in the desk next to me that I had \nrealized the error of my ways. After my classmate sat next to me, I \nimmediately panicked. I knew she had to have heard my loud singing. But she \nsaid nothing. Then I turned around to find a room completely full of my new \nclassmates behind me. Some of them were laughing, some of them stared in \nconfusion and slight disbelief. Needless to say, I had made the most \npriceless first impression ever.\ufeff",

            "text": "When I was in first or second grade I went to a summer camp at the place I \nhad gone to preschool. This was a camp in which there were both elementary \nschool kids and preschoolers. One morning I was standing with a girl I knew \nfrom school who was bent on informing me of the fact that the phrase \"I \nswear to God\" is akin to \"I promise.\" I, being a na\u00efve and not very well \nsocialized child, did not believe her, but later that afternoon tried it \nout anyway to sound cool. A girl of about 4 years of age happened to wander \nby at that exact moment, and, spinning on her heels, pointed a trembling \nfinger at me and screamed, \"SHE SWORE!\" To which I, being also an idiot, \nresponded, \"No, I didn't - I swear to God!\" Then she wailed at me for \nswearing again, and she started crying, and I started crying, and the \ncounselors, who up to that point had thought of me as the sweet \nkind-hearted soul they'd known for years, didn't really know what to do. A \ndecade later, I still have emotional baggage. And I have never sworn to God \nsince... This has been oddly therapeutic. Thank you, Hank!\ufeff",

            "text": "...I've blocked most of my embarrassing moments from my memory. I mean, \nobviously I've pronounced words wrongly (for years I misread \"enigma\" and \nthought it was pronounced, \"engima\"), but I never really got embarrassed at \nthat. I mean, one of my earliest memories is of sounding out some word from \na book I was reading when asking my parents for a definition, and getting \nit so horribly wrong that in the end I had to spell the word so that they'd \nknow what I was trying to say XD And occasionally I still do that (I don't \noften find words I don't know in books anymore). Probably most of the \nreason I don't really get embarrassed anymore is because I've come to the \nconclusion that I have my friends, and I like my friends, and they're \nallowed to laugh at me. And I don't much care what anyone who isn't one of \nmy friends thinks about me. So it becomes hard to get embarrassed about \nthings, 'cause I legit don't care if people think I'm odd or not.\ufeff",
