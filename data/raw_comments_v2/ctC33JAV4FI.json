Rather, they have showed that there are \ninfinitely many pairs of primes which are distance 246 (or less) apart. \n Just because there are infinitely many does not mean that all primes \nbehave this way.\n\nThe claim that primes get more spaced out is definitely true.  In fact, the \ngaps between primes can be arbitrarily large.  For any integer n, the list \nn!+2, n!+3, ..., n!+n is a string of composite numbers (n!+k is divisible \nby k, if k is less than or equal to n).  This string is of length n-1.  So, \nfor any positive integer n, we know there is a prime gap of at least length \nn-1.  And they do tend to spread themselves out as numbers get larger (but \nof course there are always primes that aren't very far apart too!).
