I would not take this much time on a lesser car and if I \nwas selling a lesser car I would not wast my time with someone wanting to \ndo all of this. When you buy any car factor in parts price. I was given a \nMitsubishi OZ lancer I love the car but I could build a Honda for cheaper \nthat could run with a Porsche or EVO. If it is an American car most were \ncheaply put together look at popularity before you buy. If it is a dream \nAmerican car (63 Split window Corvette) just plan on fixing all of it.   \ufeff",
