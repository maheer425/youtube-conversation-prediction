Between DRY fingertips, there is roughly 300-500 \nkohms (300,000-500,000 ohms) of resistance. Now according to ohms law, the \namount of amperage is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance...so \nsince we know this creates 2 volts, if you were to touch this with dry \nhands or wet hands which are about 100 kohms of resistance, regardless of \nthe 800 amps, the resistance of the body would only allow 1/250,000 of an \namp to pass through you which you wouldn't even feel. it takes a minimum of \n1 miliamp (.001 or 1/1000 amps) to throw off your heartbeat and kill you \nand that's if you hold onto both leads with seperate hands. \n\nWhy this WILL kill you......if he held the bare metal of anything, say two \nscrews in separate hands, then touched those two screws to the two separate \nleads, it would lower the resistance of his body to extremely low levels, \nroughly 500 ohms, thus allowing more current through. 2/500 = 4 miliamps, \nwhich still on a scale isn't a ton of power, the metal of whatever you were \nholding onto would get extremely hot though because there is a lot more \npower passing through it due to it's resistance being around 1 ohm. If it \nwasn't AC voltage and passing through your heart, it probably wouldn't kill \nyou. For example, DC voltage takes 30 mA to be considered deadly. \ufeff",
