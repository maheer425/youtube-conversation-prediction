            "text": "+andrew gilroy Here is how you can become the coolest person on the block \nby building a device to rain candy. I started this project with a trip to \nmy home improvement store for these pvc parts. I am going the hard stuff \nout of the way so I'll measure different lengths of schedule 40 pvc pipe \nand start cutting. I am mainly using 2 inch and one inch pvc pipe for the \ncannon and one and 1 quarter inch pipe for the detonator. A chop saw worked \nwell for me but I had to be careful because sometimes things like that \nhappen. The pipe is now out to the lengths I want and before I glue these \nprices in place permanently I'm going to to fit them all together to see \nhow they fit. My design is for two separate 12 inch air tanks joined \ntogether with one inch pipe and connecting To a inline sprinkler valve I am \nalso going to add a manual ball valve and an end cap that I will thread a \npneumatic adapter onto later this 90 degree elbow will be my base for a 2 \nfoot tube of 2 inch pvc pipe that will act as my cannon barrel it looking \nvery good and I am very happy with the design so it is time to glue it up I \nwill use some purple primer to get the pvc ready for gluing making sure to \nput a coating on all the parts that will be connected now I've finished \ngluing it back together using pvc cement and am adding some thread tape to \nthese connected nipples to ensure an air tight seal. I expect this system \nwill be pressurized around 135 psi and this should help prevent leaks it's \ntime for a pressure test I'm gonna start around 60 psi and test for leaks \nthen slowly make my way up over 100. I've closed off the manual valve and \ndisconnected the air hose and I don't hear any air leaking so I'm going to \ntest the sprinkler valve release by shorting it out on this 9 volt battery \nit is actually a 24 volt valve but a single 9 volt battery seems to work \nfine for this purpose and the valve works great so it's time to wire up the \ndetonator I will take the 1 1/4\" cap and drill a hole just big enough to \ninsert a momentary switch and then drill a 1/8\" hole in the bottom cap to \nfeed My wire through this is doorbell wire and I'll tie a knot to prevent \nit from pulling back through the cap again now I can add the 1 1/4 x4\" pipe \nbody to the base and prep the wires for a good connection I will wire the \nmomentary switch in series with the battery and sprinkler valve then give \nit a quick test to verify its all working correctly perfect it's all \nworking great so I'll secure the switch and tuck the battery wires into the \ndetonator body no I'm wrapping the wire around some scrap 1\" pipe it to \ngive it a neat coiled look then I'll get to work on a wad for the barrel \nthis is the price that will push the candy up and out and I'm going to make \nit out of this plastic cups I will cut the bottom quarter inch off the \nbigger and then shave about a quarter inch from the top of a 3oz cup when \njoined together they make a perfect 2\" barrel and when it time to load the \ncandy I'll push them to the bottom with a makeshift ramrod thee are super \ncheap and surprisingly durable but still gentle enough to convert this \ncannon into an epic water ballon launcher look for that in another video \nalright this system is looking pretty good but I want it to look amazing so \nI'll clean off the upc stickers with some adhesive remover and the spray \npaint it red and black every thing is back together and I'm really happy \nwith how this is looking the daunting question now is will it work or was \nit all for nothing? Time to test it out the plastic cups are in place and \nI'm using these jelly candies for practice it's ready to go in 3 2 1 fire \namazing These candies shot up around 100 feet in the air and completely \ncovered back yard making an exciting candy hunt for my kids and hit novelty \nat the birthday party well I will call that a epic success if you liked \nthis project perhaps you will like some of my others check them out at the \nking of random .com",
