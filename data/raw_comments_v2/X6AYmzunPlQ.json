The guy \nhas some issues for sure thats goes back further than the military, he \nsurrounded himself with shit bags also and that didn't help him. Its easy \nto blame the military and use it as our crutch for our violent behavior. I \nkept convincing myself of it but it just wasn't true. America is a war \nnation, a violent war driven society fueled by violent media and your \nchildhood environment is the culprit and the military just fuels the flame. \nThey are not helping him by encouraging him to act our his military \ntraditions. He is still so caught up in that illusion, stuck in his \nmilitary brain washing. It took a year or two for me to readjust to \ncivilian life but i got over my brain washing and resumed a normal civilian \nlife. I served in the Marine corp infantry from 2001-2005 and came home to \na nice peaceful life of farming which helped a lot in my readjustment \nphase. The Marine Corps infantry didn't make me violent, angry, bitter, or \nhateful. I sowed my youthful stupid lust for blood and war in the corps and \ngot out even more anti violence and anti war. I drank my fill of war and \nconflict, never again. Some guys just let it get to their head and take it \ntoo seriously, it takes much longer for these guys to readjust and some \nguys hold onto their military brain washing to a ripe old age. When you get \nout you're supposed to hang up your boots. When I got out I threw \neverything related to my military experiences in a box and try my best to \nnever open it again. I even avoid talking about my military experience, ive \neven gone as far as not listing it on my job applications/resume. Ironic \nthat im talking about it now though...traumatic experiences are best left \nlocked up in the closet. Ive visited several psychiatrist/psychologists and \none thing i learned is that a stranger can NEVER help you with lingering \nmental issues. As much as they pretend to care you are just another number \nto prescribe pills to. Thats when i found philosophy and it saved my \nlife...for the time being.\ufeff",

Notice the overall tone of the document, the terms are being \ndictated by the supposed \"loser\" of the war. Since when does the loser of \nanything dictate shit to the winner?\n\nIn the opening sentence you see the full title of King George, including \nhis notable possessions. Notice that the King serves as the Arch Treasurer \nof the Holy Roman Empire. That means he answers to the Pope. Now in the \nlist of notable possessions we see that France and the United States are \nstill being claimed as possessions by the King of Britannia.  I mention \nFrance because further along in the introduction of the treaty it says the \nKing put off signing this treaty until he concluded his peace treaty with \nFrance, I guess he won that war too. Didn't France provide the colonies \nwith money and other assistance to sustain the war?  Did King George \nfinance both sides of a bogus war?\n\nYou know the answer to that already. But let me make a few more \nobservations. The last few lines of the introduction lists the three \nrepresentatives from the U.S. whom were sent to Paris to negotiate this \npeace treaty. At the end of each of the three representatives titles (Ben \nFranklin, John Adams and John Jay) is the word \"Esquire\". An Esquire is an \nofficial position of distinction bestowed upon attorney's after taking \ntheir \"oath\" to the BAR.\nThe \"Esquire\" makes the title Noble, therefore \"Esquire\" is a Title of \nNobility. The United States does not recognize titles of nobility, nor does \nit grant them, their is no Noble class, no Royalty, no Kingdom, and \ntherefore no Title of Nobility can originate here in the U.S. That is \naccording to the Constitution, and the Articles of Confederation. And yet \nwe see that at that time, and down to today, attorney's all over the U.S. \nincluding the word \"Esquire\" in their title. \n\nBen Franklin & company didn't do the U.S. any favors by agreeing to some \nridiculous crap that no true winner of a real war would ever agree to . It \nmakes more sense when you see that the treaty was negotiated by five men \nwho were all on the same side. The King only gave up political control and \npersonal claims to property for him and his heirs. He maintained possession \nof the U.S. on behalf of \"The Crown\". The Crown is a corporation,  it has a \nKing, which is an Office of the Crown\nCorporation, not a person. Look at his title again, Prince George is the \nKing. Queen Elizabeth is currently occupying the Office of the King. And \nevery attorney in the United States with \"Esquire\" appearing in their title \nreceived that honor from her.",

Which is not a big surprise, considering that even DSM \nclassified it wrong until 2013. As someone who is about to make a living by \ncounseling veterans, I'll be more than happy to educate you, starting with \nbrain development related to the age of the veteran, then continuing on to \nthe actual neurological changes of those who have been in service depending \non the length of their service, and ending with the inevitable and \nirreversible neurochemical damage that in most cases requires medication \nand extensive counseling. \nThe days of 'shell shock' have long ended ladies and gentlemen, just in \ncase you haven't noticed, science has moved past narrow minded judgment and \nit's definitely time for you to do the same. Vietnam war resulted in more \nthan a third of its veterans committing suicide and more than 150K \nincarcerated. During World War II, those who suffered similar symptoms were \ndishonorably discharged and sent home with their names pinned to their \nshirts when they were too disoriented to communicate. Most of them died. \nIt seems horrifying until you go through this video's comment section and \nsee the evolution slide backwards in front of your eyes. These veterans \nlive through more trauma then most people could even imagine. They don't \nneed your judgment and they definitely don't need your excuses. It's not ok \nto beat someone to death, but it's equally not ok to refuse to acknowledge \nthat there's something wrong here, something that VA is obviously not \nequipped to handle.

If you remove the emotion from \nyourself in these type situations, execute in which you are trained, and do \nyour best to get yourself and brothers home; simply you have done your \nbest.  We've done a great job with returning people home from a decade plus \nof two wars in which over a million people deployed.

For all of the \nones that will comment negatively I encourage you to display your lack of \npurpose, principals, and moral convictions out here.  As I know what I did \nand the good I provided to a purpose that was selfless.

We \nare not weak nor ashamed of our accomplishments.  Give me and my brothers a \nchance to show you that we are better then most, and give us a chance to \nshine and formulate direction to accomplish goals.   We understand the risk \nwhen we sign and resign for more years.  We are not war junkies, and \nperhaps not all are cut from the same cloth.

Here is an article with cites to all the claims of \nthe movement of Chemical weapons included in the article, i could just copy \nand paste them here, but I believe you can look and see for yourself.\nIts a non opinionated article that just supplies the evidence and leaves up \nto you to decide with it as you will. \n\nhttp://mic.com/articles/62103/how-did-syria-get-chemical-weapons-did-they-come-from-our-old-friend-saddam\n \n\nAlso there has been cases of american troops getting severley sick and \nshowing signs of chemical exposure. As well we did find Chemical weapons \njust not to the extent that was thought previously, however please dont be \nmistaken that the Iraqies at one point did not have WMDs on a terrible \nscale. They gassed the Kurds and even used it on the Iranians during their \nwar with each other(though the US did seem to turn its back on that at the \ntime, oh well we are humans we make mistakes, and we should have condemned \nit at the time but in the context of time it is understandable as to why we \ndidnt condemn it as much as we should have.)\nHere is the evidence about US troops having symptoms of chemical exposure \nin the bombshell report by new york times\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/14/world/middleeast/us-casualties-of-iraq-chemical-weapons.html\n\nHere is the chemical attack on the Kurds, its a wiki page, but i mean \ndoesnt everyone know at this point about Halabja?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_chemical_attack\n\n\nAlso the the War for Iraq was not just for the Chemical weapons, but also \nthe US just wanting Sadam out of power, in fact we wouldnt have invaded \nIraq had Sadam just step down like we asked (more like threatened) and the \nreason why we wanted him to step down was because of (context of time) our \nfear that Sadam would aid the Sunni group known as Al quada (you know that \nlittle group that did commit one of the worst acts against americans in our \nhistory?) Anyways whether you agree with the Iraq war or not its pretty \nmuch known at this point that Iraq had chemical weapons at a point of time \nand the US was just doing what it had to in its own eyes to protect its \nself after the tragedy that was 911 two years prior to our invasion of \nIraq. Though you cana rgue that in higdsight it may have not been worth the \ncost of the war, you could also argue how fucked up it would have been to \nsee the Sadam regieme in power especially during the arab spring that \nhappened in 2011. Or even worse, his sons in power? Yea thats no bueno. I \nfor one think it was a mistake to leave iraq afrer 2011 and a bigger \nmistake to leave Iraq at a time when we decimated AQ only to see the fuck \nups of the shiite government that was put in place after Sadam. Especially \nwith the rise of ISIS in recent years, which are all just remnants of the \nshambles that was AQI. But hey im starting to get off topic, i just felt \ncompelled to reply now especially after i didnt see your post over 6 months \nago as the asian kid stated, which i thank him for reminding me of:)",

So the Army was a choice I don't regret but like this \nveteran, I too went through 2 tours and did what I did for a cause I \nbelieved in & also, as a warrior trained to fight and engage the enemy. \nAfter leaving the Army transition was very hard. Still to this day many \nyears later, it's never \"over.\" We're trained a certain way, especially \nthose of us who went infantry or some other combat MOS. Upon leaving the \nmilitary our skills are practically useless out here except for maybe \nbecoming a criminal cop who blindly follows orders to violate the \nConstitution/Bill of Rights in the name of enforcing any & all \"laws\", \nlegal or not. Sorry, my oath was to uphold & defend the US Constitution, \nnot break it & not terrorize American citizens just because I got a badge \non me. What needs to happen is all of us pissed off veterans need to unite \n& remove the police state/tyrannical govt from power and help to assist in \nreturning the country back to the people, end of discussion as far as I'm \nconcerned. Shit like what this judge said is common-place mentality with \nLEO's, ADA's, DA's & judges today. If you take notice, LEO's get a pass \nmost of the time when they break the law, murder someone, etc. If veterans \ndo something, we get screwed more often than not. We're a \"danger\" as this \njudge says, but to whom I ask? Dangerous to the power players? Dangerous to \nthe police state employees, aka, police & judges, corrupt bureaucrats & \npoliticians? Yes, we are. But not dangerous in the sense that they're \nperpetrating us to be. Most of us love our country & will honor & uphold \nthe Oath's we've taken & the Constitution. If nobody has ever seen this \nclip, it's on Youtube, 13mins long. The Battle of Athens, TN, 1946. See \nwhat happened when veterans & patriots stood together to restore the Rule \nof Law.
