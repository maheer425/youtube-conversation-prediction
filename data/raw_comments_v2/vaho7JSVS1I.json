The 1.25\" bushing i couldn't find with threads, only slip so i \nhad to just get another 3/4\" slip to thread and couple it.  no biggie.  but \nI also used all white, i bought some of the grey stuff he used, and it \nain't cheap nowhere.  i bought some and didn't use it, taking it back. \n however, i would still argue that an HVAC supply is more expensive on \neverything, i used to work at one, Coburn's Supply.  maybe cheap enough for \nthe regular guy, buy i am disabled and live on zero dollars a month.  i \ndidn't have the gas to chase parts all over town.
