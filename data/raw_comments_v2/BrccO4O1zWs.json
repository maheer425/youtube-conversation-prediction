Once they got their capital they immediately globalize \nthen furthermore created massive conglomerates like samsung.(good buy small \nbuisness creation0 The medium wage in korea is less than the OCED by up 20 \npercent(and they say they have a powerful economy). China is taking \neverything with the resources they mine out of their country and outside. \nAmerica was once like this as well. I can care less about the growth as it \ncan be heavily subsidize. Resources,small buisness creation, and company \ncreations are signs of a powerful economy not the education level. If you \ntaken economics korea is actually a bankrupted country with a tons of \npeople trying get in the very little spots(why do you think they want to \nget into the positions?). So they create generations upon generations with \nno skills and with the majority not even reaching to the top. Oh and they \ndont learn the education for improvement most of them do it BECAUSE THE \nSALARIES ARE HIGH AT MEGA coporation(the only thing they care about). As \nwarren buffett said \"other countries were always way smarter and hard \nworking but we created the system where the most creative suceeds(america \nsuceeds with the resources it has and is the land america is able to \npersist through the horrible wars/the worst economic breakdowns ). The \neconomy cannot be effected by the people;there has to be a cause and system \ncreated in order for a economy to suceed\". In a way america has become the \nnaruto uzumaki of the world",

Because of this, we spend \njust as long or longer (we end up with extremely time-consuming video \nprojects Asian students usually don't have to do because of this \n\"individualism\") at home or after school, doing this homework, and \neffectively studying just like our Asian school counterparts.

In the US \nit's culturally acceptable to  push young people to be unique individuals \nwho are passionate about what they do. That \"special snowflake\" mindset \ndoesn't really exist in South Korea, like at all. Many feel as though those \ncultural differences impacts our educational systems. \nSchool in South Korea was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The \nidea that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few is \npractically shoved down your throat. There isn't a general acceptance of \nuniqueness and the students are studying until 10/11 pm. They don't have \nthe same kind of Winter/Summer breaks that we do and I think that aids \ntheir ability to retain information. They're extremely tough and because of \nthat their suicide rates among students is off the charts but that kind of \nenvironment, while I personally think is stifling, produces some of the \nmost hard-working and determined young people I've ever seen. Of course \nthere are kids like that all over the World but there's a reason why Korea \nis constantly ahead of us in terms of educational score performance. The \nonly thing we really have on them is Universities. ",

In a charter school you have to bust your \ntusch if you want to graduate high school and go on to attend college. I \nthink we do have a negative of being overworked. If traditional North \nAmerican education is creative but without enough emphasis on curriculum \nand studying, and Korean education is all about school work, then I would \nsay the charter schools emphasize both with a negative of being spread to \nthin. We have to contend with AP classes and part time jobs at the same \ntime. However I wouldn't choose any other option.

(I.E. Chefs aren't known for their good food, but for \ntheir TV personalities - this happens with jobs all over America, and is \npart of the reason interviews are so important.)

I may be really good at singing classical music and you may be \nreally good at singing rock, and someone else is good at building robots \nand someone else at chemistry. But the emphasis is placed on discovering \nwhat we're good at instead of forcing people to be really good at one thing \nso that they'll know how to work when they don't want to. Both are \nimportant things to learn. I don't think one is better than the other.\nAdditionally, I don't think the reason Americans are entitled is because \nthey're taught that they're \"a special snowflake,\" but because of our \nmaterialistic culture, in which the focus is (when you're growing up) that \npeople will give you what you want when you want it. Parents spoil kids \nwith immediate gratification, so kids don't know that that's not how life \nworks. Not to mention most Americans are extremely privileged, so they grow \nup thinking that what they want matters most. But this is a small minority, \nthough it's our image to the world at large, kind of like how most people \nbelieve East Asians don't know how to \"question authority\" because they've \ngrown up in a Confucian society, regardless of whether it's true.\nI think it's possible we're both right, and we've just had very different \nexperiences in the world. Neither one of our opinions have to be right, but \nI think it's important to move from the realm of stereotype (what we *think* \ncertain countries do) to reality (what others can tell us their countries \ndo).",
