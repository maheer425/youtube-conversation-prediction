It may be a hazard to good content providers, but bad one have twice as \nmany, even all dislikes over likes! It helps keep constructive, and \ndestructive criticism going. If all we had were likes, how would we measure \nhow great anything was. More likes for better content, or worse content \nthat's been around longer? To really measure it, we need to keep up with \nmath. Divide the number of likes by dislikes. If it's greater than 1, you \nknow you have more likes. If it's below 1 or less, don't worry! As long as \nyour content is yours, and entertaining, just carry on! If you make mean, \nbad, or despicable content, go die in a fire!\n\nHave a lovely jubbly day! ~YourFriendlyYouTubeVeiwer!",
