That means if a brain \nconsumes X glucose, in a body that has body mass equal to 50 kg, the \npercentage is much higher than X in a body that has body mass equal to \n100kg. X represents the same quantity of daily glucose. \n\nMore exactly, a lower body mass means less resources, so a higher \npercentage of consumption is acquired. But only the percentage changes, \nwhile the quantity remains the same. For example, if you have two buckets \nfilled with water, one that contains 500 l, and the other 200 l, and you \nneed to drink 100 l to live; if you drink from the 500 l bucket, that means \nthat you used 20%, whereas if you drink from the 200 l bucket, that means \nthat you used 50%.",

I think you need a little more open \nmindedness to absorb and analyse their views. Different tasks require \ndifferent sets of neurons to fire and it is a highly inter-connected \nnetwork. Even if you are able to supply the brain with infinite energy or \neven just over-feed, it is of no use because you cannot simply force a \nbrain to work harder. When was the last time your brain was activated many \nfolds just because you ate too much food? You have to ask yourself whether \nactivating the whole brain is really necessary. Why would you want to drive \na car home and at the same time cook or to remember your nightmares, and \nmillions of other things? The perception will simply be too chaotic and \nwill lead to nothing but failure in what you had to do (i.e. drive home). \nMost multi-tasking would most likely involve some common set of neurons to \nfire. If there is a over-lap of inputs from two different tasks on the same \nneuron/set of neurons, the brain will automatically tag confusion and you \ncannot perform well. There is reason to how our brain has evolved in this \nway to be better efficient in one work at a time. I love the human brain as \nit is.

I would guess \nbased on the information on how the human brain works from this video that \nif 100% of our brain was active at any given moment, so as to say that \nthere was a current running though all of the billions and billions of \nconnections in the brain, we would lose touch with \"the real world\" as \nJonathan Lyng mentioned before me, but in a much deeper sense. I believe \nthis level of interconnectedness between the full scope of our memories, \nand the complete awareness of the present moment would greatly affect our \nsense of reality. I believe a brain of this type would begin to perceive \nthose parts of reality that are normally much too subtle to grasp, like \nseeing the effect of time in evolutionary theory. Perception of time for \nthat matter might change altogether with the person being able to \naccurately determine futures due to the combination of complete awareness \nbetween all their past experiences and present positioning.  In quantum \nmechanics there is an experimentally proven phenomena called the \nmeasurement problem, roughly speaking it describes how the act of measuring \na body at the quantum scale actually alters its state, classic example \nbeing a cat in a box that you can't tell is dead or alive unless you open \nthe box and look inside. In quantum mechanics, that cat is both dead and \nalive at the same time until you check, and I think a brain with 100% \nactivity would perceive the world in that way, it would have the capability \nto see the superposition of all the states of the universe.

Cytowic  First of all, I am honored that you find my idea \ninteresting.\nWell, I never actually thought about how to supply infinite energy as I am \nmore curious about what could we achive if we somehow do it. What would be \nthe capabilities or limitiations of brain in such a scenario.\nAnyway, I would try to answer your question to the best of my understanding.\nI dont think that applying infinite energy instantaneously (using \nelectricity etc) would do any good. The \"10% at a time\" limitation is \ninduced by nature so that the body could sustain energy hungry brain. But, \nwhat if we start overfeeding it. Brain feeds on glucose like the entire \nbody. An athelete needs extra glucose cause he consumes more. Same can be \nthe case with brain. If we supply increased amount of sugar in a controlled \nway and force our brain to \"exercise\", that is to activate more than one of \nregions at a particular instant, we might be able to extend the limits. I \nguess, what I meant to say is to force the brain to evolve. It would take \nyears to make changes, but I dont think that million years of evolution \ncould be reversed in seconds. The possible faults in the idea:\n1) altering glucose balance can be harmful.\n2) changes in an individual wont be transferred to its progeny, i.e. \neverything would need to be started again.\n3) Brain might not actually change.\n\nNow, if we are impatient and we want to do it in seconds only. Then, we can \nflood our brain with 'some' molecule which can act as an alternative source \nof energy for neurons and has the property of ~100% renewability based on \nenergy input from other source of unharmful energy. UV rays can cause DNA \nmutation, it might be possible to find a energy providing molecule which \nreplenishes itself using energy from, for example: ultrasound. ",

The more used the more Hz you got. Most \npeople are not capable of sustaining high levels because their tissues are \nnot charged enough. In chinese electricity of body is called chi. It is all \nthe same but we have yin and yang chi. We generate yang chi outside the \nbody when muscles are relaxed. With time it builds amd becomes concentrated \nlike gravity. Then it slowly goes inside the tissues and bone where it \nstays with the cells as 'background energy' or 'maintenence energy'. This \nis then yin chi. This is why young people when the ejaculate and loose all \ntheir yang chi they feel energised because yin or stagnated chi comes out. \nIt should come out through exercise and emotion not physical stimulus. Old \npeople with not much yin chi or 'energy reserves' get considerably tired \nfor the next few weeks!. So back ti brsin, it baturally needs more yin chi \nbecause of its active tissue.
