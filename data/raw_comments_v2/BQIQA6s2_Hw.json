Who even knows if he \nhad alot of time to be home? I know some doctors that basically work for \nover twelve hours, go home, sleep, and then head back. And then also we \nhave no idea how old the boys were. She was probably a housewife watching \nover Elementary school aged boys all the time. The mother probably was also \nthe type of person that would have been unhappy if someone tried to stop \nher. My mother is the same way. Whenever I go home from college, she \ninsists on doing things for me that I am more than capable of doing on my \nown. Sometimes we just gotta grin and bare it when people we care about \nhelp us.
