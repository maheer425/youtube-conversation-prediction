I had very watery diarrhea and then the vomiting \nstarted until i was empty and totally drained over next 1.5 hours. I slept \nso bad with almost continual cramps. Woke up this morning awful, body \naching, headache, abdominal cramps, dizzy, low blood pressure. I had no \nappetite so i took an imodium tablet on empty stomache. 30 mins later awful \nwretching until the disolved imodium came out bright yellow. I just spent \nall today monday in bed, sipping water and dry cream crackers. Texted my \nfriend but he said other guests didnt report a problem, he was fine too, \nthe beef was fresh from rancher supermarket. He said maybe rrom the coke \ncan but i,m not convinced.

The sight of food right now makes me sick. I've been drinking \nvitaminwater drinks, coconut water, eating a few oranges, and some orange \nJell-O. Hopefully, I will get to feeling better tomorrow. I've had food \npoisoning before, but it wasn't THIS BAD. Plus, it doesn't help that I'm \ngoing through my period at the same time of this food poisoning. Everything \nhappening all at once.

We are \nomnivores, which means we eat both plants and animals, our teeth are \nadapted to both, though our canines are much less prominent than most other \nomnivores and carnivores. Another example is us being able to eat dairy \nproducts which a long time ago we would not have been able to eat, but \nthanks to evolution, a long long time ago, people in the north of europe \nand other parts of the world where the sun shines less made our skin \nlighter in colour and made it so we can eat dairy products (most of the \ntime anyway) to make it easier for us when living in cloudy climates with \nless sun hours to get the optimal amount of vitamin D.\nAlso, meat from animals is a great source of proteins, some of the \nproteins/amino acids we get from animal meat is really difficult to come by \nthrough living a vegan life, of course its not impossible but there are \nessential amino acids, vitamins and minerals that we can not aquire from \nplants but only from animal products.\ufeff",

Does that mean our digestive systems cannot handle \nanimal products, or that we should not eat animal products? No.\n\nOur digestive system is of a configuration that allows us to consume both \nplant and animal products. Ours is in between that of a herbivore and a \ncarnivore. We have molars that allow us to grind our food, incisors that \nhelp cut up plant matter, but also canines that allow us to tear meat, but \nnone of these teeth are particularly pronounce over any other. Our saliva \nis alkaline, which means we are adapted to vegetables, but that does not \nexclude eating meat. The length of our GI tract allows us to digest plant \nmaterial, but again, does not preclude meat. We do not have any other \nadaptations to process plants material before food reaches our stomach as \nherbivores do, and this aspect is consistent with carnivores. I can go on \nand on, but for your reference: \nhttp://learningon.theloop.school.nz/moodle/mod/page/view.php?id=48128. As \nyou can see, human beings have some properties of both carnivores and \nherbivores, meaning we evolved to subsist naturally on a blend of meat and \nvegetables. It is down to personal choice, however, if you wish to become a \npure vegetarian or a vegan, it is not a problem, as a varied enough \nvegetarian diet will see that you gain all the nutrition you need. If you \nchoose to subsist on animal products alone, I would advise against it, \nsince meat lack dietary fibre, which will do harm over the long run.\ufeff",

Doc said it was a by product of \nmy body purging itself of the toxins.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is after the food borne illness is over. Do \nnot immediately resume your normal eating habits. This can (at least in my \ncase) cause your stomach to fail to empty, which meant a stomach pump in my \ncircumstance. Instead, start off with \"clear foods\" (broth, apple juice, \njello etc) gradually introducing solid foods over a two or three day \nperiod.
