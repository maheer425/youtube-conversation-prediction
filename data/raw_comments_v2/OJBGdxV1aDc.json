            "text": "LOL, a great one. Japanese are interesting. Let's them show us moar.... \nhahaha. Philosophically speaking it's interesting.\n\nMy answer:\n\nWhat you control is what you can destroy. What you destroy is what you can \nnot control anymore. What you can not destroy is what you will never \ncontrol. A thought you can erase it, a sketch you can erase it, a man you \ncan kill him. An idea you can not.\nThat's why their are people who love killing each others. That's the only \nway to show you control humans. The more you control humans the closer you \nare to protect yourself from them.\nEventually if you erase every humans from this world you are king of every \nhuman being.... hahahaha.\n\n\nFor example When Japan tried to control China they killed many Chinese \npeople without distinction, when USA decide to submit Japan they killed \nmillion of japanese without distinction.\nIn fact it doesn't matter who you kill, because killing is the only way to \nprevent yourself from being killed. So let's blood spread till the end of \ntime. Because that's exactly what will happen.\n\nThe other way is to let me handle everything. I will patch you when you \n born and decide of your future. I will be your god so you will do \neverything for me (it will become your goal) that's way I will bring peace \namong you and wealth for me.\nDon't worry there is a heaven for those who protect me, even if they are \npoor (in fact it's 100% sure for poor people) :)\n\nOh and of course I will kill you if you are not okay with that.\n\nIn fact I'm a little sad, I'm dissapointed too. If it's really a message \nyou want to pass it's not a good one. I believe your country history was \nall about living and dying by sword. A reason why you are here today is \nalso because your ancestors sacrifice themselves hundreds or thousand of \ntimes.... Because they believed in protecting your Empire and their lords \nand their way of living. But maybe it's not a message for your people, if \nthat's the case I'm okay with that.\ufeff",

Maybe I \nmisinterpret and you can say me that. (I wanted awnser to reply to)\n\nOr maybe people think they are smart and above this? Like \"Oh, I've already \nthink about it and you are totally wrong\" or \"yah that's life you are \nright\" blablabla....\nIn fact you can argue, say what you think about the lyrics, debate etc...\nWe are not superficial aren't we? Maybe you are misinterpreting what I say. \nSo if you have something to ask I will gladly awnser you.\n\nYou know It's not that I'm pro-war, but you have to understand that it's \nnormal for human to do it, It's normal for men to like it.\n\nI mean since childhood we play policemen and gangster games. We love \nChivalry etc... Maybe there is a reason.... Like being able to act in those \nsituations, saving your mates, killing those who threaten you etc... It's \nsituations we can all face.\n\nAnd since we are citizens of modern countries I think we are not communist, \nor extremists fighting for who know what... So why blaming us for liking \nwar? I mean it was always like that since the begining.... There are people \nwho stole others and kill them and threat them and there are people who \nfight to protect them, there family and they are not better because \nsometimes they do really \"bad\" things, but can we blame them?\n\nThose who really dislike war they are the worst killers of all human \nhistory.... They killed more than nazis and nationalist in fact. Because \nthey wanted to bring peace everywhere they had to find a way to be \neverywhere, in every minds.... and before they knew it they were at war \nwith everyone. \n\nIt's why I like story about defending you, your friends, family, country, \nideal and love at every cost.... What is important is to defend your own \nworld, whatever it takes. And when \"world collides\" then.... Let's fate \ndecide. Isn't it better to respect those who decide to fight and enjoy that \nthan blaming them for wanting to defend what they believe in?\n\nI respect everyone, even the worst man if he decide to protect himself and \nfight back for his own sake. There is perfection in everything even war. \nThat's why men like violent stories, that's why they want to know about it \nand are fascinated by it.\n\nWhy do we like horror show?(I for myself dislike it)\n\nThat's also an interesting question.... In fact we are fascinated by that \npart of us. We all have it. We both love and despise it at the same time. \nBut if we start only despise it then we are extremist, because we will have \nto \"erase every sins\" from our existence.",
