I mean, if there are nuances between European countries in the \nMiddle Ages - and there are! - then surely is ridiculous to talk about a \n\"common\" global history between regions that had almost no contact at all, \nif any! Instead history is obviosly different for every region before these \ndevelopments... actually as you said history is \"nuanced\" even inside \nregions more interconnected like Europe.\n\nSo, what does it really mean to talk about World's history? Such thing \nexists only inasfar it concerns events that have worldwide influence, which \nwere pretty few until the Industrial Age and the European colonisation that \npreceded it.\n\nIt's looking down on other civilizations to admit that European's \ncivilisation history *is* more relevant to modern geopolitics and future \ndevelopments than other civilisations?\n\nSo, to follow your example - and without any evaluation whatsoever about \nmerits - can there really be a discussion about what is more significant *for \nus* between the Greco-roman civilisation and the Indu valley one? To be \nmore \"Medieval\" and direct, which is more relevant for us to study: the \nInca Empire or the Spanish one?",

The end \ncertainly was (because of the Great Famine of 1315-1319 or the Black Death \nfor example), but the Medi\u00ebval Warm Period which had accured in the \ncenturies before wasn't all that bad at all, as new techniques made an \nincrease in productivity and population possible. The reason Europe sees it \nas a dark age, is because 1. it is certainly true for some parts of it, and \n2. Renaissance authors typically depicted the Middle Ages that way to \ndistinguish themselves from it, but the reality is certainly more nuanced.\n\nJohn Green could have discussed that in his video, I agree. I don't mean to \ncall you racist or make you feel guilty. However, I don't agree that \nEuropean history is more relevant than the history of any other continent. \nSure, European culture got spread all over the world either by colonisation \nor migration in the 19th and early 20th century, but we may ask ourselves \nwhether that makes European history actually more relevant, or whether we \nsee it as more relevant. Colonisation might have made people (at least in \nthe nineteenth century, when history was first approached in a more \nscientifically way) maybe look down on other civilisations? Or, when \nstudied, it was often with a view that was biased and romantical. This was \nwhat Edward Said argued in his famous book Orientalism.\n\nIt is only recently that the history of China or India or Africa made it \ninto school books (at least in France), and I don't think it is a bad \nthing. Students still focus mainly on Europe (which is logical as they live \nin Europe and it is most relevant to them), but I think that a few chapters \non other continents is very useful in a world in which China and India for \nexample are going to play a signicant role. We live in a globalised world \nin which borders or distance are becoming less and less important. We \nsimply cannot only focus on ourselves.\n\nYou are right that at some point in history, it cannot be denied that \nEurope played a very significant role. But as you say, in the Middle Ages, \nEuropeans and Chinese had hardly met, and Europe's role before the \n15th/16th century wasn't in any way much more important than that of other \ncontinents. It cannot be denied that in the Middle Ages, some parts of the \nworld were just more advanced. Or, to take a broader approach then just the \nMiddle Ages... Why for example would it be more relevant to study the \nRomans or Greeks than to study the Indus valley civilisation, which was \nvery advanced in some ways. This was LONG before Europe came into the \npicture in India. I mean, why, when studying ancient history or the Middle \nAges, would Europe need to have a significant role, when they did not \nactually have any significant role at the time, compared to other \ncivilisations?",

I actually think it is refreshing, as people \nalways actually focus on European history and learn that in school (I mean, \nI never learnt anything on let's say China). And lots of people are really \nbiased when it comes to the Middle Ages (which weren't even all that dark \nall the time or in every aspect in Europe either). I think that the idea of \nthe video was just to say: the Middle Ages might have been a bad time in \nsome aspects for Europe, but in a whole weren't all that bad.",
