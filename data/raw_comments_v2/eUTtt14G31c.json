The \"white man\" is representative of the human race \nwho has come to strip their planet of it's resources and the natives are \nnot equipped to deal with the invaders so it takes one of the enemy to lead \nthem in the fight to reclaim their land.\n\nIt's nothing to do with white or anything like that. And anyone who can't \nsee it is being pretty silly.\ufeff",
