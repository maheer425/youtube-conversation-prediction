Krishna was explaining to him through the Bhagavad Gita that it \nwas his duty to protect the whole kingdom from the evildoings of those \npeople, even if they were family. \n\nIn addition, as many comments have said below, Bhramins are NOT the highest \ncaste and the caste system is not as most people view it.

            "text": "Mr John, u have done fairly good job in describing brahmanism/brahminism \n(which some ppl today refer with misnomer term hinduism or sanatan) \nreligion.\nAlthough, there r few mistakes in it.\nMohandas Gandhi and likes did not work against caste system, they were only \ntrying to be leader of ppl while side by side promoting caste system. \nPresident in Indian democracy do not have much power, govt power resides to \nprime minister.\nUr definition of Buddhism is very wrong. Like Buddha did not take \nparivarjaka (i.e. start of ascetic life) on just watching 3 sights of sick, \nold, and death. There were other reasons for that as well which r indicated \nin jataka kathas and can be find little indication in start of \n\"Sutta-Nip\u00e2ta, Atthakavagga, ATTADANDASUTTA\".\nDescription of 4 noble truths r also wrong. It says that sufferings do \nexist, it do not say life is suffering. It is more about controling desire, \nnot extinguishing desire. Nibbana/Nirvana actually means get rid of \nsufferings and achieving happyness. Although, some ppl differ with it. By \nthoughtfulness (& 8-fold path) like dam, one sud control the crazy desires \n& attachments of kind of uncontroled streams of water.\nSome apologetics and mind washed from brahminism religion r spreading \nmissinformation here.\nCaste system is inescapable by-products of varna system.\nMahabharat is ever changing and expanding story, so it is not dependable \nthing regarding history.\nGita stress on not to change job, which can be translated as birth based \nvarna/caste system. Dharma in gita is like duty, while karma in gita is \nlike dutyful actions (not just action/deed).\nreligious and political camps r spreading myths that aryan migration theory \nhas beed discredit by dna study contrary to truth, by giving only partial \ninformation & witholding complete truth.\nAncient Indian at time of buddha had multiple cultures, religions, \nreligious movements. Samana/Sramana and brahminism was 2 major religious \nmovements among many others. Buddhism emerged within Samana tradition.\ndhayana/Yoga/meditation, Kamma/Karma, shiva, agnotism, atheism, materlism, \nsankhya philosphy, rationalism, preference of virtues over birth was \ndifferent things emerged within Samana tradition, though different ppl \ndefined them differently. These things later being incorporated in \nbrahminism religion also.\nAshoka primarily followed buddhism, but he also mixed elements of Jaininsm \nin it. Buddhism stress about love & firendship, it do not stress on \nnon-violence too much like jainism, it also do not stress on violence like \nbrahminism.\nBy the way \"chess\" game is also seems to be originated in India, which is \nnot game of luck.\ufeff",

Rebel spaceships, \n                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first \n                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\n                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \n                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \n                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough \n                    power to destroy an entire planet.\n\n                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \n                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \n                    the stolen plans that can save her people and \n                    restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\n               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \n               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \n               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \n               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\n               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\n               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \n               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \n               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \n               surface of an Art Deco design.\n\n               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Did you hear that? They've shut down \n                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed \n                         for sure. This is madness!\n\n               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \n               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         We're doomed!\n\n               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \n               only another robot could understand.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         There'll be no escape for the Princess \n                         this time.\n\n               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \n               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy \nequipment \n               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         What's that?\n\n               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\n               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \n               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \n               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \n               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \n               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \n               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\n               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \n               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \n               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel \nsoldiers \n               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \n               arms and faces.\n\n               An explosion hits near the robots.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         I should have known better than to \n                         trust the logic of a half-sized \n                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\n               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \n               around the two hapless robots.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\n               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \n               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \n               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \n               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but \nlovable \n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\n\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky \nmotions.  \n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments \nstudying \n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \n               tiny robot to follow him.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \n                         waiting for?! Get in gear!\n\n               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \n               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \n               madly.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n\n               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \n               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \n               in a frenzied panic.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \n               Artoo makes beeping sounds.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is \n               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel \n               soldiers can be heard in the distance.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\n\n               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and \n               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\n               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \n               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \n               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes \nadjusting \n               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the \nlittle \n               robot joins his companion.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         At last! Where have you been?\n\n               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         They're heading in this direction. \n                         What are we going to do? We'll be \n                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or \n                         smashed into who knows what!\n\n               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the \n               subhallway.

He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \n               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\n\n               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \n               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \n               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \n               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \n               narrow path.\n\n               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \n               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \n               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \n               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \n               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \n               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \n               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \n               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \n               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \n               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \n               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \n               the trail.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\n               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\n               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \n               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \n               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \n               is sucked into the giant machine.\n\n               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \n               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\n\n               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \n               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \n               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \n               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \n               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic \nwhimper \n               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \n               of the chamber.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\n\n               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \n               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \n               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic \nconversation, \n               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \n               out from the gloom.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\n\n               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\n               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \n               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \n               ridge.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\n\n               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\n               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \n               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\n\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\n                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks \n                         go off in this direction.\n\n               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand \n               and gives it to the first trooper.\n\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\n                         Look, sir -- droids.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES\n\n               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER\n\n               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \n               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Wake up! Wake up!\n\n               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \n               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \n               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer \nlights \n               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \n               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \n               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \n               odd assortment of robots.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         We're doomed.\n\n               A Jawa starts moving toward them.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Do you think they'll melt us down?\n\n               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this \n                         never end?\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\n\n               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \n               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \n               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \n               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \n               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \n               adobe block house.\n\n               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, \nstraightening \n               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \n               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \n               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and \nnostrils \n               should be.\n\n               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \n               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \n               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \n               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \n               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \n               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \n               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\n\n               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \n               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru \n               standing in the main courtyard.\n\n                                     BERU\n                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a \n                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         It looks like we don't have much of \n                         a choice but I'll remind him.\n\n               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment \n               for sale with the Jawa leader.\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         I have no need for a protocol droid.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                              (quickly)\n                         Sir -- not in an environment such as \n                         this -- that's why I've also been \n                         programmed for over thirty secondary \n                         functions that...\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         What I really need is a droid that \n                         understands the binary language of \n                         moisture vaporators.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Vaporators!

He is restrained \n               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\n\n               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two \n               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \n               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks \nwildly.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Uncle Owen...\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         Yeah?\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. \n                         Look!\n\n                                     OWEN\n                              (to the head Jawa)\n                         Hey, what're you trying to push on \n                         us?\n\n               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel.

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY\n\n               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and \n               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the \n               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the \nyoung \n               adventurer.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         There are two Banthas down there but \n                         I don't see any... wait a second, \n                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can \n                         see one of them now.\n\n               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his \n               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of \n               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a \nlarge, \n               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \n               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \n               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \n               down the side of the mountain.\n\n               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \n               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \n               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \n               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \n               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \n               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands \n               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible \n               shrieking laugh.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY\n\n               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in \n               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the \n               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the \n               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \n               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \n               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \n               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \n               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.\n\n               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \n               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \n               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \n               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \n               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \n               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes \n               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a \n               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Hello there!

Don't be afraid.\n\n               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and \n               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on \n               Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Rest easy, son, you've had a busy \n                         day.

Luke and \n               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \n               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\n\n               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \n               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until \nfinally \n               the mechanical man's systems turn on.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Where am I?

What kind of talk is \n                         that?\n\n               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little \n               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around \n               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \n               air.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.\n\n               INT.

Which reminds me...\n\n               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \n               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \n               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \n               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \n               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \n               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         I have something here for you.

The speeder stops on a bluff \n               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard \n               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A \n               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts \n               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where \n               Ben is standing.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Mos Eisley Spaceport.

Various strange forms of \n               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are \n               parked outside the bar.

TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA\n\n               The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow \n               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy \n               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \n               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \n               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, \nslimy, \n               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \n               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group \n               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender \n               stops Luke and the robots.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         We don't serve their kind here!\n\n               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many \n               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's \n               drift.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         What?\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         Your droids.

He notices several of the gruesome \ncreatures \n               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.\n\n               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Listen, why don't you wait out by \n                         the speeder.

His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\n               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \n               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \n               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \n               sight to behold.\n\n               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \n               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \n               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \n               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation \nbetween \n               Ben and the giant Wookiee.\n\n               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \n               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \n               or whatever.\n\n               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n\n               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \n               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \n               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \n               belligerent monstrosity.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         He doesn't like you.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         I don't like you either.\n\n               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \n               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \n               adventurer.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         Don't insult us.

I have \n                         the death sentence in twelve systems.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I'll be careful than.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         You'll be dead.\n\n               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar \n               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \n               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in \nbehind \n               Luke.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         This little one isn't worth the \n                         effort. Come let me buy you \n                         something...\n\n               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young \n               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through \ntables \n               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. \n               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked \n               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. \n               The bartender panics.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         No blasters! No blaster!\n\n               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \n               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \n               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \n               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \n               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \n               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \n               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \n               points the the Wookiee.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         This is Chewbacca.

I fear \n                         something terrible has happened.\n\n               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then \n               he fixes his gaze on Luke.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         You'd better get on with your \n                         exercises.\n\n               Han Solo enters the room.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Well, you can forget your troubles \n                         with those Imperial slugs.

Each side of the \n               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca \n               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- \n               covered arms over his head.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Now be careful, Artoo.\n\n               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his \n               stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures \n               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses \nChewbacca's \n               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. \n               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and \n               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         He made a fair move.

I suggest a \n                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee \n                         win.\n\n               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems \n               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his \n               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his \nmovements.  \n               Han watches with a bit of smugness.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force \n                         flowing through him.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         You mean it controls your actions?\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Partially. But it also obeys your \n                         commands.\n\n               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a \n               \"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with \nantennae, \n               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of \n               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a \nlightning-swift \n               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke \ndoesn't \n               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, \n               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood \n               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg \ncausing \n               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons \n                         are no match for a good blaster at \n                         your side, kid.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         You don't believe in the Force, do \n                         you?\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Kid, I've flown from one side of \n                         this galaxy to the other.

Don't \n                         trust them.\n\n               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker \n               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then \n               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly \n               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits \n               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful \n               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Stretch out with your feelings.\n\n               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes \n               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the \n               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original \n               position.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         You see, you can do it.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         I call it luck.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         In my experience, there's no such \n                         thing as luck.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Look, going good against remotes is \n                         one thing.

They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \n               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \n               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \n               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so \nfleeting \n               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \n               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.\n\n               INT.

The giant Wookiee and his two \nguards \n               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \n               are everywhere.

I'll have to clear \n                         it.\n\n               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \n               the information. There are only three other troopers in the \n               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \n               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \n               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\n\n               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \n               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Look out!

Luke and \n               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \n               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \n               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \n               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \n               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \n               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \n               system, which is screeching questions about what is going \n               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         We've got to find out which cell \n                         this princess of yours is in.

Ben gestures with his hand \n               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the \n               other hallway.

Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and \n               points out the window to the ship.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         You came in that thing?

Come on!\n\n               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the \n               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty \n               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are \n               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\n\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\n                         It's them! Blast them!\n\n               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges \n               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the \n               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down \n               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\n\n                                     HAN\n                              (to Luke and Leia)\n                         Get back to the ship!\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Where are you going?

Come on!\n\n               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for \n               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke \n               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is \n               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \n               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \n               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \n               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \n               moving into an attack position in front of the lone \n               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the \ntroops \n               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \n               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \n               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \n               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \n               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \n               the other way also.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \n               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \n               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \n               open hatchway.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\n\n               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \n               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into \ninfinity. \n               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \n               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \n               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \n               his arm and pulls him back.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                              (gasping)\n                         I think we took a wrong turn.\n\n               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \n               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \n               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \n               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, \nleaving \n               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge \noverhang.  \n               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         There's no lock!\n\n               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         That oughta hold it for a while.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Quick, we've got to get across.

Luke aims his laser \npistol \n               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \n               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \n               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \n               and grabs at his chest.\n\n               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \n               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \n               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Here, hold this.\n\n               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \n               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \n               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \n               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \n               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \n               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \n               of more troops.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Here they come!\n\n               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \n               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \n               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \n               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \n               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \n               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         For luck!\n\n               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss \n               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as \n               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the \n               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at \n               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into \n               the tiny subhallway.\n\n               INT.

He checks \n               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the \n               opposite direction.

Just before he reaches the \nhangar, \n               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not \n               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber.

Vader \n               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \n               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \n               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\n\n               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \n               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a \nserene \n               look on his face.\n\n               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \n               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. \n \n               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \n               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \n               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \n               and starts for him.

Kid!\n\n               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it \n               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers \ncharge \n               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \n               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \n               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \n               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \n               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship.

Run!\n\n               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns \n               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the \n               troopers and races into the ship.\n\n               INT.

The \n               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in \n               size as the Rebel fighters approach.

Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.  \n               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and \n               foreboding, is Darth Vader.

DEATH STAR\n\n               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up \ntheir \n               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew \nrushes \n               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head \n               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming \n               noise of the monstrous weapon.

Dodonna and several \nother \n               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is \n               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. \n \n               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He \n               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who \n               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled \n               troops, who all bow before them.

The caste system, as a historian you should have told that no one is \nborn into the caste, it was a choice at vedic times. So if you chose to be \na warrior you need to fight; because everyone excel at what they like this \nsystem would have been awesome. Same thing is shown in films like the \n\"Divergent\". And even now there are people who convert from lower caste to \nhigher caste(after studying vedas) <= for hindus reading this.\n2. your point about salvation in Hinduism being individual way is a nice \nobservation...and did you just hinted that buddhism was made for political \ncontrol. You should check out sakya clan.\n3. \"He had become the Buddha, the teacher\" - have you heard about anyone \nelse who became a teacher?? Jesus wanted everyone to call him rabi - \n\"teacher\" ;took disciples exactly like buddha ...check out \"guru-shishya \ntradition\" atleast in wiki.\n4. ohhh you didnt like chutes and ladders because it a game of luck and you \nwant logical game... why don't you try chess, its also from india :-P \n5. You gave the awesome explanation for the last part yourself. Hinduism is \na individual upliftment of self....which means unlike other religions you \ndont follow or praise the god, you develop yourself to the point that you \nbecome a part of him. So if you try to become like buddha the basic \nprinciple remains the same so it was gradually understood by them and lost \nits separate identity in india. Now imagine that in its basic level, in \nthose old days not everyone will understand these ideas so for entire \nsociety to develop there are gods and goddess that people can relate to. \nMore like all the saints church declares every year so that people native \nto saints place has someone they can relate too. Better these goddess and \ngods are associated with a particular character or a skill. So if you are \nsinger you relate to goddess sarawathi and obviously in time will become a \ndevotee. Now the best part is all the rituals associated with these goddess \nwill have something relating to singing, like you need to sing in front of \ntemple or a crowd or on a particular event, which keeps on increasing your \nskill. All ways lead to moksha unlike buddhism which focus only one aspect \nof human psyche (gauthama was a title given to philosophical sages in \nancient india -  the guy who wrote nyaya sutra was also a gauthama, gautama \nmaharishi wrote the dharma sutra...sooo)  :D...the psychological aspects of \nHinduism cannot be matched with anything else.\ufeff",

            "text": "The Buddha does not mean teacher. It means the Awaken One. \"The word Buddha \nis a Sanskrit word which means \"The Awakened One\", one who is awakened to \nReality, who understands true nature of the mind, the world, and all \nsentient beings.\" \n\nTo simply call the Buddha a teacher is a gross misrepresentation of what is \nwas and is for us all in memory and through the teachings in the Pali \nCannon and other sects of Buddhism. The Buddha was one who discovered the \nnature of reality and mind and conveyed that truth and practice and path \nleading to the knowledge of that truth called the Noble Eightfold Path. \n\nThere is another error in your statement, \"Buddhism argues the fulfillment \nof the self will lead to the order of the world.\" This was never taught by \nthe Buddha. The Buddha taught Anatta or \"Not Self\" in the 5 aggregates: \nBody/form, Feeling, Perception, Mental Formations/Fabrications/Sense \nConsciousness (consciousness derived and created by contact with the world \nand the mind). He showed us to look at the 5 aggregates and ask if they are \npermanent, subject to change and if things that are subject to change are \nstressful. The answer is yes to all these three questions and the question \nthat comes next is, \"Now is what is impermanent, what is painful since \nsubject to change, fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, this is I, this \nis my self'\"? \u2014 \"No, venerable sir.\"\n\nHere is the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta: The Discourse on the Not-self \nCharacteristic\n\nThus I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares, in the \nDeer Park at Isipatana (the Resort of Seers). There he addressed the \nbhikkhus of the group of five: \"Bhikkhus.\" \u2014 \"Venerable sir,\" they replied. \nThe Blessed One said this.\n\n\"Bhikkhus, form is not-self. Were form self, then this form would not lead \nto affliction, and one could have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my \nform be not thus.' And since form is not-self, so it leads to affliction, \nand none can have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my form be not \nthus.'\n\n\"Bhikkhus, feeling is not-self...\n\n\"Bhikkhus, perception is not-self...\n\n\"Bhikkhus, determinations are not-self...\n\n\"Bhikkhus, consciousness is not self. Were consciousness self, then this \nconsciousness would not lead to affliction, and one could have it of \nconsciousness: 'Let my consciousness be thus, let my consciousness be not \nthus.' And since consciousness is not-self, so it leads to affliction, and \nnone can have it of consciousness: 'Let my consciousness be thus, let my \nconsciousness be not thus.'\n\n\"Bhikkhus, how do you conceive it: is form permanent or impermanent?\" \u2014 \n\"Impermanent, venerable Sir.\" \u2014 \"Now is what is impermanent painful or \npleasant?\" \u2014 \"Painful, venerable Sir.\" \u2014 \"Now is what is impermanent, what \nis painful since subject to change, fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, \nthis is I, this is my self'\"? \u2014 \"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?...\n\n\"Is perception permanent or impermanent?...\n\n\"Are determinations permanent or impermanent?...\n\n\"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?\" \u2014 \"Impermanent, venerable \nsir.\" \u2014 \"Now is what is impermanent pleasant or painful?\" \u2014 \"Painful, \nvenerable sir.\" \u2014 \"Now is what is impermanent, what is painful since \nsubject to change, fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, this is I, this \nis my self'\"? \u2014 \"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"So, bhikkhus any kind of form whatever, whether past, future or presently \narisen, whether gross or subtle, whether in oneself or external, whether \ninferior or superior, whether far or near, must with right understanding \nhow it is, be regarded thus: 'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not \nmyself.'\n\n\"Any kind of feeling whatever...\n\n\"Any kind of perception whatever...\n\n\"Any kind of determination whatever...\n\n\"Any kind of consciousness whatever, whether past, future or presently \narisen, whether gross or subtle, whether in oneself or external, whether \ninferior or superior, whether far or near must, with right understanding \nhow it is, be regarded thus: 'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not \nmy self.'\n\n\"Bhikkhus, when a noble follower who has heard (the truth) sees thus, he \nfinds estrangement in form, he finds estrangement in feeling, he finds \nestrangement in perception, he finds estrangement in determinations, he \nfinds estrangement in consciousness.\n\n\"When he finds estrangement, passion fades out. With the fading of passion, \nhe is liberated. When liberated, there is knowledge that he is liberated. \nHe understands: 'Birth is exhausted, the holy life has been lived out, what \ncan be done is done, of this there is no more beyond.'\"\n\nThat is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were glad, and they \napproved his words.\n\nNow during this utterance, the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five \nwere liberated from taints through clinging no more.\n\nPlease Search the website AccessToInsight for the real teachings of the \nBuddha. \n\nMay all beings be safe and happy and discover for themselves the \n\"remainderless fading and cessation of desire\" which is Nibbana. \ufeff",
