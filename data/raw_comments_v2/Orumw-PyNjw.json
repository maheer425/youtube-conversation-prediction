A few friends and I are creating our own version of Crash \nCourse\u200b which we intend to call CrashCourse Student\u200b, but by this time you \nmight have figured out that this is Copyright Infringement. We were \nwondering if we could have written permission from you to use this name as \notherwise we could face legal repercussions.\n\nWe're not plagiarising your information, but we're using some of your ideas \nas basis for our episodes. For example, we're using the Mongol-tage \n(although we can remove that if you wish). We're also using the Open \nLetter. We're presenting information in a similar format. We're even using \nyour videos to research (although we are citing them), however most of our \nresearch is done on our own in our own time and most of our scripts written \nin our own words. Our entire team is really passionate about the subjects \nthat we intend to teach, and even if we're not a reputable source that can \nbe cited, we do want to teach people things that we feel are important and \noverlooked in history (and hopefully science and future shows that we \nintend to have). Two of the episodes in our first season, as John Green\u200b \nhas stated in his episode about Congo and Africa's World War in \nCrashCourse\u200b World History 221, intend to teach about Africa as most world \nhistory classes overlook these when teaching. And not only are we really \npassionate about history, but we're also the biggest fans of Crash Course \nthat we know of and we really want to honour you guys by doing the same \nthing and talk about the things that we know you really want to talk about \nbut can't squeeze into 30-40 episodes.\n\nIn conclusion, we're asking you to give us written permission to use the \nname Crash Course Student as well as any other recurring segments in your \nvideos such as the Mongol-tage and the Open Letter, and to let us use your \ninformation as long as we cite you in our references.\ufeff",
