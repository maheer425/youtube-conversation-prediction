You can also get shot glasses that have almost \nlike a separater in the middle so half your shot is one color and the other \nside is another. They.re pretty cool. Now, at \"participating\" liquor \nstores, they have already made shot using the plastic version of the glass. \nI bought a couple out of curiosity and they were gross but I did buy more \nso I can use them for a party.
