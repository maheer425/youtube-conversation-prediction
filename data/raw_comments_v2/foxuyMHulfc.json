            "text": "My worst job was a paid internship I had during my senior year of high \nschool. Initially, we had been asked to fill out a form about what careers \nwe were interested in. At the time, I had wanted to be a veterinarian, but \nthe closest the form had was health care. I selected that, but in a section \nto provide more information, I filled in specifically what I was looking \nfor. To my understanding, we were going to be partnering with professionals \nin the field that we were interested in, which would've been amazing! We \nwent through multiple workshops on how to do interviews, dress, ect...all \nfor the day of the interview to come and for us to find out that ALL of us \nthat had registered would be doing the exact same thing. Teaching food and \nnutrition to younger people.\n\nI'm overweight. And an introvert. And I dislike kids. Everything pointed to \nwhy I should not take the job, but...I didn't want to be close-minded and \nit was paid. I had just gotten my first cell phone and wanted to pay for it \nmyself. We were given a partner and each Friday, we didn't go to school, \ninstead going to the other school to teach. My partner and I were given the \ntask of teaching 7th and 8th graders. I thought this would be fine, as \nthey're older and I wouldn't have to oversimplify things. Riiiiiight. That \nfirst day was a mess. In fact, the entire thing was a mess, but that first \nday just set the precedent. We were supposed to catch a school bus in our \nneighborhood that went to the school we were to each at, showing an \nauthorized form to the bus driver. My partner's bus driver refused to let \nhim on and thus, I was at the school by myself, frantically waiting for \nhim, wanting to bail, but not even having transportation to do that. I \nfinally sucked it up and decided to keep it brief, explaining what I was \nteaching and that this wasn't going to be to judge anyone. Fat lot of good \nthat did, as I could still see the discreet glances the other students gave \nto the bigger kids. I tried to use myself as an example, that while I \nwasn't in shape either, I too was learning about better nutrition. Which, \nif nothing else, I did.\n\nMy partner was finally able to join me the next week but for some reason, \nhe was never respected. He...he was a push-over. Way too nice. Sadly, this \nis also what made me have a crush on him (even before the internship. \nLiking someone and then finding out things like you share the same bus stop \nafter moving to another part of the city, share at least one class \ntogether, a class that didn't have a lot of people, and that we had the \nsame last name too. You'd think someone was trying to give me a sign by the \ntime we were partnered together. I even timidly asked them to prom...just \nas the starting bell rang, drowning out my squeaking voice. I never got the \nguts to ask him out again). Anyways. Since they never respected him and \nonly kind of respected me, we were sort of sitting ducks.\n\nMultiple times, teachers would hear what we were doing when we took our \nlunches in the teacher's lounge, what class we were teaching next and would \nwhisper to us ominously, \"Good luck...\" The teachers came to view the hour \nwe were in their classroom as a much needed break...so many times I saw \nthem sigh in absolute relief when we came in. I did feel bad for them. I \ndon't mean to perpetuate the stereotype but some inner-city schools can be \na bitch. I knew, I too was attending one and you'd think my school was a \njungle of wild animals instead of an institution for learning (earlier that \nyear, I was invited to meet Laura Bush ((setting aside my political views. \nYou don't say no to opportunities like that)) who was visiting another \npublic school for her foundation. It was an elementary school where the \nkids were so well-behaved, it made me want to cry with how savage in \ncomparison my school was). But what I hated the most though was when the \nteachers would walk out when we came in! Don't leave me here with them!!! \nBecause that's when shit would really hit the fan...\n\nThe internship only ran from about March until the end of May, but it was \ncut short as we had to get ready for prom (which I did not attend) and \ngraduation. I most certainly did not complain. My patience with kids pretty \nmuch plummeted there and is probably what made me come to the official \ndecision that I want my tubes tied to be certain I don't have any.\ufeff",

Anywho...kind of digressed, lol. But yeah, since \nthe dynamic with the manager and nephew was so volatile at times and the \nnephew would leave us scrambling, I wouldn't want to do that to my \nco-workers if I could help it. As for the manager firing the nephew, it \nmakes it hard when the person also lives with you and has a criminal \nbackground that may hinder him from getting a job elsewhere. And that \nthere, people, is why you don't hire family. I was eventually fired for \nbeing too slow (good riddance) but had that boy not been the manager's \nnephew, he would've been gone LONG ago.
