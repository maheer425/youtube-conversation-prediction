            "text": "+stephen McLamb First of all, do some research about the big bang. \nExplosions don't always destroy things. The friggin Sun is an example of \nthat; fusion occurs in the core of the sun (basically explosions that fuse \nhydrogen atoms resulting in the creation of helium). Ramp this up to the \nscale of the big bang, and dozens of elements would be created.\n\n\nSecond, the big bang theory does not cover the the creation of life, so it \nobviously don't speak of the creation of monkeys.\n\n\nThird, humans DID NOT evolve from monkeys, as Joseph Donkin here said. \nMonkeys, Apes and Humans evolved from a similar ancestor. To explain how \nthis happens in an analogy, think of humans and apes/monkeys (I'm not \nsaying that apes and monkeys are the same) as cousins in the same species, \nhaving the same grandparents, and the apes/monkeys stayed in the place \nwhere their parents were born, whereas the humans migrated to an \nenvironment that had a lot of other animals competing for resources. The \nhumans would develop, let's say, intelligence to counter the competition. \nIn that environment, the smarter men would be more attractive to women, and \nthe not as smart men would be less ideal. Thus, the smarter men would pass \ndown their genes more, than the not as smart men. Eventually after \ngenerations, almost all people in the society or population are all \ncomposed of the men with the \"smarter gene\", since the not as smart men had \nless chances of passing on their \"not as smart gene\". This is NATURAL \nSELECTION. Eventually after millions of years, humans which had mutations \nallowing for larger brains - meaning more intelligence - meaning more \noffspring, would develop larger brains compared to their originally \nidentical ape/monkey counterparts in their original homeland. Basically \nafter millions of years of mutations and natural selection, the humans \nwould become a different species from the apes/monkeys - this is EVOLUTION. \nHumans and apes are related, there is no doubting this, the genetic \ndifference between individual humans today is about 0.1% on average - study \nof the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of \nabout 1.2%.\n\nFourth, \"its funny how evolution has NO evidence\" is totally wrong. It's \nfriggin happening before our eyes. Please do research prior to making \nclaims such as evolution having no evidence. Read this: \nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060714-evolution.html\nFurther more, fossils of early hominids are evidences of evolution, if you \ndon't count our DNA being 98.8% identical to that of chimpanzees as \nevidence.\n\n\nFifth, indeed the Piltdown man was a hoax, but how about about the \ncountless other finds of early Hominid fossils, such as A. ramidus and \nLucy? Plus, the Piltdown Man was found in the early 18th century, you can't \nreally blame them for not having a lot ways of finding out that it was a \nmix of contemporary human and ape bones. Further more, it was a skull, not \njust that of an early Hominid.\n\nI'm not attacking your views on creationism. Just please, make sure to get \nyour facts straight and do your research before making immature comments \nsaying evolution is \"this impossible thing some 4 year old made up.\", not \ndoing so simply makes you look much much less believable.",

I generally try to avoid this \ntopic, since belief is very subjective, but I'll try to explain how I see \nthings (not necessarily meaning they're correct, just a personal view)\n\nWhat's written in the scripture may be interpreted in a number of ways, and \njust like Rachel Kwan here said, \"a day\" could have been billions of years. \nThink of it as believing God created everything, and set everything in \nmotion. The extreme number of factors and events that made life, the \nexistence of the planets, stars, and etc possible is because of how God \nstarted it all. If you think about it, in a sense, He created the land, and \nthe seas, and the stars, basically the universe. He just put things in \nplace, and everything follows.\n\nHonestly, I try my best to not think of belief when science is concerned, \nsince it makes thinks more confusing. I know... If you think of certain \ntopics, they seem to contradict (science and religion), but don't stress \nyourself too much. Humans don't know everything yet xD\n\nWhen learning try not to delve too much on belief and such, unless if its \nreligion you're studying xD It helps to you be more open-minded on things \nand concepts.\n\nTo those reading this, again, this is a personal view.
