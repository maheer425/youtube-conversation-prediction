Mainly with storage of the gas into \nsome other form that's easier to store, such as in metal lattices. The \nother problems would be resources; there's a lot of platinum needed for \nthese fuel cells, which with asteroid mining (decades into the future as \nwell) would quickly become unsustainable as the demand for platinum \nincreases- hence the price of these cars.\nElon musk says \"The sooner we give up on hydrogen the better. This will be \nsuper obvious when time goes by.\" I however disagree- in part, Hydrogen \njust needs a way to be stored efficiently and that would be a massive \nbreakthrough. However i think that breakthrough will happen far too long in \nthe future...\nits a promising fuel, but rolling them out this early on when they run on a \ntank, with limited range just seems odd to me. Unless say, the battery is \nbigger, enough for a 400km drive. with a quick refill.\nThe Toyota Mirai also looks terrible. It's going to be another Prius, \nridiculed by terrible aesthetics and reviews from petrolheads and car \nenthusiasts such as myself, however the hybrids of this generation are \nlooking pretty good. Li-Ion batteries and the whole lot. And they're coming \nout to be very efficient.\nI'm not saying that this hydrogen era won't catch on, but It's definitely \ngoing to be slow. Real slow. I wouldn't buy a car that's only the \nfirst-step when there's more developed technologies such as Tesla's cars, a \nhybrid or just a standard ICE. However is still flawed, the charging times \nare too slow; its just the way they present the electric car is just so \nright.\nAnyone agree that Fuel Cells are currently far from being commercially \nviable?

The plumbing for the car, has to be \naluminum tubing and very well sealed, Running the hydrogen through a \nregulator using a computer program can regulate the hydrogen like gas is \nregulated through your computer system.ALSO the timing on the car has to be \nchanged, because hydrogen runs hotter and more efficient than gas.
