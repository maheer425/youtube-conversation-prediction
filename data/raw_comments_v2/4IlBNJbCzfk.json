Time variance gives rise to \nconservation of energy, but the universe isn't time-invariant - metric \nexpansion occurs, so a physical system today at the cosmic scale would be \nmuch different from a physical system tomorrow.

            "text": "+ByRTD yO\nBefore I adress any of that, your whole assumption is flawed. You say that \nvia random chance, there are x possible states the universe could be in \nright now, and the odds of it being OUR state is lower than the total \nstates, so it's impossible.\nBy the same logic, if a loterry has odds of 1 to a million, but only sells \n500 thousand tickets, it's impossible to win. This is obviously not true.\n\nAlso, you can't take a general possibility and cross it with a specific \ntime in the middle like that.\nSay you're in a crowd of 100 people hoping to win one of 10 new phones. \nThere are of course 10 possible winners. Now, they're handing out one phone \nevery 6 seconds, and it's been a minute. Right now, there are only six \npeople who could have a new phone, but there are 10 phones to be had! The \npossible states are lower than the odds of it being the right state, but \nthat doesn't mean it's impossible for you to have a phone, does it?\nYour 2000 enzymes are the same situation. Only one out of every x possible \nstate has all 2000, and as of now the universe has only been able to reach \ny states, and y is smaller than x. But the universe isn't over yet, \neventually y=x. Just like eventually, they'll pass out all 10 phones. Right \nnow, they've only handed out 6, but that doesn't mean it's impossible for \nyou to have gotten one, and it doesn't mean it's impossible for the \nuniverse to have reached our state.\n\nNow then, onto your pint.\n\nSorry, but \"total number of atoms in the entire universe\" isn't \ninterchangeable with \"weak ass guesstimate (based on things well known to \nbe wildly inaccurate) number of atoms in the minute fraction of a fraction \nof a fraction of the actual universe that we can observe\".\n1: The entire universe is most likely infinite, and if it isn't we pretty \nmuch have no idea how big it is, how full of conventional matter it is, how \nspread out said matter is, how much of that matter is even in the form of \nmatter, and what kind of atoms it is.\n2: The observable universe is a glimpse into the past. At the closest point \n(Earth itself) it's 0 years old, at the furthest (an estimated 100 billion \nlightyears in every direction) it's about 14 billion years old. Simulating \nwhat that would all look like today is pretty much impossible, so we \ngenerally assume that it looks sort of like local space, and then calculate \nhow many galaxies that would be, which gives us a number that could be \norders of magnitude off because we have very little idea how matter density \nhas evolved in the rest of the universe.\n3a: Galaxies come in all sorts of sizes. If we're going by amount of stars, \nthe biggest is IC 1011 with 100 trillion, I can't find THE smallest, but \nvarious sources say galaxies can have as few as 10 million. But most have \n200-400 billion, NOT 100 billion like you say, so if that's what we're \nbasing things on, your number of atoms has to be multiplied by 2-4.\nBut estimating the number of stars per galaxy and then the number of atoms \nper star is needlessly complicated. We estimate the number of stars in a \ngalaxy with the mass of the galaxy by the mass of an average star, and we \nestimate the number of atoms in a star with the mass of the star, the \nfraction of atoms in a star (it's not just hydrogen, the older a star gets \nthe more different elements it contains) and their respective mass. So \nwe're going from mass to number to mass again, and adding a bunch of \naverages and guesswork in the middle.\n3b: And because we estimate the number of stars by mass, things get even \nless accurate. You can't just divide a galaxy by the mass of an average \nstar and have the number of stars, because not every galaxy has the same \nstar makeup. And no, no one type is common enough that we can just use that \naverage.\nDepending on age, makeup, density, brightness, etc. of a galaxy, we can \nestimate what types of stars a galaxy is made up of, and estimate their \nfractions. Each type of star has it's own average mass, but then each star \nchanges size and brightness (but not mass) as it ages, further complicating \nthings.\nWhich is why you really should go straight from \"mass of average galaxy\" to \n\"atoms per galaxy\", skipping stars entirely.\n3c: Oh, and not all of a galaxies mass is stars. It was recently discovered \nthat Andromeda, although only slightly larger and with slightly more stars \nthan the Milky Way, is almost twice as massive, because of dark matter.\n4: \"A normal star is pretty much like our sun.\"\nOh god the ignorance. Even if that were true and everything I said about \nstar types up there wrong, it still wouldn't help us. First, the type of \nstar our sun belongs to is pretty big, it encompasses stars magnitudes \nlarger than ours. Second, our sun doesn't have a set amount of atoms. As \nyou may know, stars do this thing called fusion. That means a star that \nstarts with only hydrogen will end with a whole bunch of heavier elements. \nAnd the heavier an element, the less atoms it has for the same mass. If the \nsun converted all its hydrogen to helium, it would have half as many atoms. \nBut it doesn't just do that, it keeps fusing into heavier elements. \nCurrently, the sun is 71% hydrogen, 27% helium, the rest is traces. Let's  \nround that to 2/3 hydrogen, 1/3 helium. Helium has half as many atoms for \nthe same mass of hydrogen, so by assuming the sun is 100% hydrogen, your \natom count is off by 1/6.\n\nAlso, you're assuming there are only 10^101 \"events\" in the universe \nbecause (10^84) * (10^17)=10^101. That's great and all, but it just so \nhappens that a second is not the smallest unit of time. Most stopwatches \ncan tell you there are 10 milliseconds in 1 second. Many videogames run at \n60 frames per second. PC screens can refresh over 100 times per second. \nHigh speed cameras can record thousands of frames, and as I just found out \nthey built one that records 4.4 trillion frames per second (jesus christ).\nA yoctosecond is a septillionth of a second. It goes on and on, until we \nreach planck time. How long is that? Oh, just 5.4x10^-44 seconds.\n18,518,519,000,000,000,000,704,192,456,256,424,240,232,224 per second. An \n18 with 42 0s. 18.5+10^42.\n\nLet's fix your event equasion shall we?\nCalculating the actual number of atoms in the universe would take too long \nand be too inaccurate, so we'll take time for now. Instead of 10^17 \nseconds, we have 18.5+10^42 planck times. (10^84) * \n(18.5+10^42)=18.5+10^126.\n\nNow lets look at those enzymes of yours.\n\"You calculate this by raising 20(amino acids available) to the power of \n2000(which are the 2000 different enzymes found in the simplest bacterium). \nSo, 1/(10^20)^2000=1 in 10^40,000.\"\n\nThat assumes that\n1: enzymes develop one at a time, isolated from each other, in totally \ndifferent environments. Actually, their development is linked to each other \n(many enzymes are developments of a different enzyme, or are made possible \nby the existence of a previous enzyme).\n2: that they all had to exist, just hanging out in a barren void, until the \nfirst bacterion somehow popped into being and collected all 2000. That's... \nnot how it happened. Bacteria are thought to be the first lifeform, but not \nthe first organism (for reference, a virus is an organism, but doesn't \ncount as alive by standard definition). And it's a common known fact that \nbacteria evolved from simpler organisms, which in turn evolved from \norganicaly reproducing macromolecules, which in turn evolved from \nchemically reproducing molecules. It's a fluid process.\nWhat we actually need to find out is the probability of the universe giving \nrise to conditions under which the basics can start (we don't actually need \nthe conditions for the more complicated steps, because the simple steps \nMAKE those conditions). And those conditions are ridiculously easy. All you \nneed is a floating object with a few basic molecules (the most complicated \nbeing water, wich is basically everywhere) that's occasionally not frozen \nsolid. This can be caused by being close to a star (Earth, Mars), close to \na massive planet that causes tidal heating (that frozen moon of Jupiter's \nthat has a liquid ocean under the surface), a large amount of radiation...\nSo in this system alone, we have at least three places where it's possible, \nat least one of which actually did it (Earth), and one where we're getting \nmore and more evidence that it almost did (Mars). In other systems, we're \nfinding more exoplanets every day, many of which have been confirmed to \nhave liquid water.\nIt also assumes that there can only be one winner, like it's a lottery (as \nin, there's only one \"path\" that leads to THE victory condition [you get \nall the money], and many paths that lead to THE loss condition [you get no \nmoney]). In reality, every single one of the trillions of planets and \nquadrillions of non-planetary bodies in every single galaxy have their OWN, \nchance, completely unrelated to the chances of the others. There are \ntrillions and trillions of \"paths\" that lead to a victory condition \n(organic reproduction), and trillions and trillions of paths that lead to a \nloss condition (no reproduction).\n\nNow let's look around. Huh, looks like the conditions are met in lots and \nlots of places, just like they should according to random chance (as long \nas one understands random chance, statistics, and what chance we're \nactually looking for).",
