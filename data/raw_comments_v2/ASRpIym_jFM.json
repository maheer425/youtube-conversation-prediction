            "text": "+Stuart Hull Yes, you are correct ;) I don't know the answer, \nunfortunately. From what I understand about general relativity (or special \nrelativity) there is nothing in them that says that some observer has to \nexist for time to be \"happening\". The mathematical possibility of \nconstructing one is enough to determine a reference frame where time would \nbehave as we experience it.\nAs far as I can tell typical calculations in QFT without assuming masses \nfor the particles also work perfectly fine.\nIt basicly comes down to if time is something objective (as described by \nSR/GR ... as in: it only depends on your reference frame and not if someone \nis actually watching from it) or if it is completely subjective. If it \nreally is something completely objective then it wouldn't matter that in a \nuniverse without mass could have such an observer or not. There is also the \nquestion if \"no mass\" means only no rest mass for elementary particles (as \nimplied in the original question) or if also general relativity would not \nbe able to make objects massive. In the latter case I have no clue about \nwhat such a universe would look like.\n\nYes, I think most people will agree with your view. Relativity definately \nimplies it and, as far as I can tell, it is definately the least weird of \nthe ideas about it.\n\nUnfortunately it is not really known how time works (we can definately \ndescribe it well, but that's about it). I'm even aware of ideas that the \nuniverse is simply some higher dimensional object rotating or moving. Some \npeople also define time as a subjective quantity that comes from the \nentropy increase of the universe (however this is also considered circular \nby some, as the increase in entropy also needs causality, which in turn \nalready implies the existence of time). Some ideas also go as far as \npostulating universes with temporal directions reversed to ours (sometimes \nmeaning that the beginning of the universe would not even be a special \npoint in time ... but they still don't really explain time). There is also \nthe possibility of using complex time (that is definately implied when \ndoing certain QFT calculations, however you can always perform \nEuler-rotations to real time ... but it enables you to get around certain \nsingularities sometimes). But don't ask me how to interpret complex time :D\n\nAnd these are not even the crackpot ideas about it :D",

            "text": "+Schmidt975 I would probably say that I think of time as pretty physical- \nthat is to say, another dimension just like the others, but with different \nproperties. If I wanted answers, I would probably turn to the Minkowski \nprojection, producing something visual and graphical by reducing 3 spacial \ndimensions into one. The problem with such graphs lies in the relativity- \nthey can only work from a frame of reference treated as unmoving, and that \ncannot possibly work for a massless object. If you are familiar with \nMinkowski graphs then you'll see that if we use such a 'still' frame of \nreference but populate the graph only with massless particles, then they \nwill certainly travel in time. The question is, without this 'still' frame \nof reference, do they still do the same?\n\nI'm inclined to like your idea of time still existing as another dimension, \njust one that is not entered by any of the constituents of the universe. \nInclinations mean nothing though without evidence, or in this case, \nmathematics.

Without any time you \nwould expect no interactions to ever happen, while this is clearly not the \ncase for such a universe (just as massless particles interact in our \nuniverse ... see gluons for instance ... they most likely can even form \nbound states, called gluballs that have mass, but only from their binding \nenergy).\nYou can also imagine it like slowly changing the mass of the Higgs boson \nuntil nothing has mass anymore (\"nothing\" is not quite right here ... \ngeneral relativity would still make energetic systems behave as if they had \nmass).\n\nOr, if you prefer thinking of time as a geometric quantity, it's like \nliving on a 2D surface in a 3D space without the ability to actively move \nnormal to the surface, but still be able to measure the 3rd dimension ...\n\nThere is also the thought that time might really be something subjective. \nIn that case you would be right: such a universe would not have something \nequivalent to what be would call time.\n\nHowever: even in such a universe you could define something similar to \ntime, additionally to the spacial components. Just as in relativity, \neventhough proper-time is not a good quantity to parameterize the path of a \nphoton, you can construct other quantities that are (they are basicly \nlinked to the momentum of the photon) and for all intends an purposes \nbehave similar to a proper time. This basicly means that eventhough nothing \nwould ever experience the passage of time, you would still notice that \nthere is something else around ...\n\nI also know of simulations of lattice QFT that do not involve explicit \nmasses for the interacting fields. You still end up with a temporal \nevolution of such systems.\n\nBut that is an interesting thought indeed ;)\n\nMight I ask if you think of time as a geometrical feature or more as \nsomething subjective ... or even something else?",

As far as we know, gravity is \n\"simply\" curvature of the spacetime. In a flat spacetime, it's easy: light \ntravels in a straight line, but if you have a curved spacetime, there is \nsimply no longer any straight lines (just as in 2D there are straight lines \non a paper, until you bend it). The closest thing in a curved spacetime to \na straight line is a geodesic. You can imagine it like an instruction that \non a microscopic scale, where even your heavily curved spacetime appears \nalmost flat, it simply says: go as straight ahead as you can. This is also \nhow very large masses (like stars, galaxies or black holes) can act as \nlenses for light, since the bent spacetime makes the light-geodetic line \nappear bend to us.The same is true for close to the event-horizon of a \nblack hole. Every observer still agrees that the light travels at its \nnormal speed, but it is no longer very \"straight\", in terms of thinking \nabout a flat spacetime ;)I hope that helped a little ;)",

However for our purposes we can think of measuring mass \nby using Kepler's laws, for instance: move far enough away from the black \nhole such that effects from general relativity are small, and from the \ndistance and period you can calculate the mass. For this very special case \nthis very simple definition is actually equivalent to some other more \ncareful ways of defining mass, such as the Komar or ADM masses ( \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_general_relativity ).\n\nNow a black hole is different from a  photon because it's not just a \ntraveling, transversal wave like light is. It's a bunch of spacetime \ncurvature held together by its own self-interaction -- they're closer to a \nproton or more precisely to a magnetic monopole in that sense. An easier \nexample are KdV solitons, like in this video: watch?v=wEbYELtGZwI\n\nHere you have a water wave held together by its own self interaction. \nNotice how it doesn't spread out over time, like a normal wave would. A \nblack hole is a similar object. It's curvature held together by its own \ninteractions and that curvature can be interpreted as a mass because when \nyou move far enough away it generates the same effect that a massive \nmaterial object would.\n\nThe correct generalization of photons to gravity, which are gravitons, are \nmassless.

Now imagine you have some means of making the box's volume smaller, \nlike a set of pistons or something.

For \nthe electron, one such useful measure of size is its Compton wavelength, \nwhich is defined as the wavelength of a photon whose energy corresponds to \nthe electron's rest mass.\n\nYou can't really define a Compton wavelength for a photon though, since \nit's massless.

At the very least, \nobjects with mass cause a \"dent\" in the space-time fabric (STF), which \ncauses other objects to fall towards it if they enter the g-field. Since \nlight also exists on our plane, it is also affected by changes in the STF, \nbecause it is still travelling through the same STF as OWM, so it would, \nlogically, need to travel through the same \"bowl\" being made by an OWM. And \nof course, the denser the object, the harsher the curvature. But a black \nhole has *infinite density*, so if light strays across a black hole's \ng-field, it has to travel an *infinite distance* to get out and continue \nalong a non-warped path along the STF, which, of course, it will never do. \nThis, I believe, is why light and other particles/objects that pass the \nevent horizon do not come out.",

            "text": "+Red Ace \"My problem is how they seem to postulate the existence of a field \nthat exists everywhere in space\"\n\nRight, I think the problem you have there is with how the Higgs has been \npopularized. It is not exactly extraordinary from a particle physics point \nof view to postulate a field that permeates all of space: that is the case \nfor every known particle! The photon is just a ripple on the photon field \nwhich permeates all of space. The electron is a ripple on the electron \nfield which permeates all of space. And so on.\n\nThe only difference between the Higgs and these other particles is that the \nstate of lowest energy of the Higgs field is one where it acquires a \nconstant value everywhere in space, as opposed to the lowest state of say \nthe photon field, which is zero everywhere in space. That is to say, adding \nan electric field to a region of space costs you energy, and removing the \nHiggs field costs you energy. That's the basic idea.\n\n\"If that's the case, then why postulate that this field is what causes it \nat all?  Why not just accept that there is no good explanation for the \nmasses of particles at this time?\"\n\nBecause without the Higgs (or some mechanism like technicolor which in \neffect accomplishes the same thing in a different manner) you cannot have \nmassive elementary particles *at all*. The weak interaction has a crucial \nfeature: it sees particles of positive helicity (spin in the same direction \nas their momentum) differently than particles of negative helicity (spin in \nthe opposite direction as their momentum). If particles are massive, you \ncan move to a reference frame where their momentum points in the opposite \ndirection and flip their helicity by coordinate transformation. Major no-no \nfor the theory. On the other hand, if the fundamental particle is massless, \nyou can't ever flip its momentum by coordinate transformation and helicity \nbecomes a good quantity. A mass given by Higgs (or technicolor) is still \nokay, but a particle simply having a mass by itself is not.\n\nWorse, electroweak theory doesn't even make sense without a Higgs because \nthe W and Z bosons are massive. The gauge symmetry that *defines* the \ntheory requires them to be massless much like the photon. Spontaneous \nsymmetry breaking is the only way out that we know of, and if such a \nmechanism weren't found our understanding of these things would be shown to \nbe deeply flawed. We'd pretty much have to toss the entire thing away and \nstart over. ",

That would be a very interesting scenario because then you'd \nstill need the Higgs to make sense of the theory but now you also have this \nextra particle that nobody ordered.

We didn't know this originally: all we saw as a huge \namount of particles, the \"particle zoo\" from the 1960s. They seemed to be \nordered in a certain way but it wasn't clear how. With the Higgs data this \ndoesn't seem to happen: even if you consider that the technicolor scale \nwould be higher than the QCD scale you would still expect to see some \n\"technihadrons\" which we don't observe. Further, the technicolor energy \nscale would have to be very high in order to not produce corrections to \nknown data in the standard model, which would then raise issues of \nnaturalness about the small technihiggs mass.\n\n\" Didn't they observe that this particle decays into photons more often \nthan was predicted by the standard model? \"\n\nThey did, but it could just as well be a blip in the data that will go \naway.

This I understood a \nyear or so ago, and to my shame, I was not a truther beforehand.\n\nAs for cold fusion, I figured out a mechanism for it to happen around 2007, \ninner shells in heavy metals (Pd K-shell is 20KeV) can transfer momentum to \ndeuterium nuclei, and this is enough to produce a fusion, and the fusion \ncan produce K-shell holes, and this can produce a chain reaction (up to an \norder of magnitude, the rates are roughly ok, but there are details that \nare inconsistent with the experiments, but there are also complications, \netc, etc, it's a long story). Having an idea of what could happen in such \nthings, I then reviewed the experimental literature on cold fusion, out of \ncuriousity, to see what they saw.

            "text": "+gogerychwyrndrobwll You don't need to give references--- anyone can find \nthem today with a search engine, and you need to check the contents for \nyourself anyway. Regarding your complaints, they don't change anything.\n\nFirst, regarding \"classical spin\", that's stupid: there are two classical \nlimits for bosons, classical particles, and classical fields. In the \nclassical field limit, the spin states of the particle are just the same \nthing as the polarization states of the classical field, the particles make \nfields, and the spin states, when you make a field, are just the \npolarization states of the field. There's nothing strange about this.\n\nRegarding your points, mostly you are confused by thinking about photons. \nYou should start by thinking about pions (spin 0 bosons), because these are \neasier to think about:\n\n1. Yes, there is a returning wind whether you use position or momentum. It \nis always easier to use free-field momentum states, because you can easily \nmake an orthogonal basis of these, while position states in relativity are \nnot orthogonal states, not in the usual formalism, to do a position \ninterpretation you need a pure path integral formalism for free fields with \nsources, this is what Feynman constructs in his first diagram paper.\n\nThe lack of orthogonal position states was historically the major \ndifficulty in the particle interpretation. The key point for giving the \nproper particle interpretation is that the propagator G(x,y) can be written \nas the sum over all paths. In Euclidean space, G(x) is the sum over all \nBrownian paths of the probability of going from x to y by Brownian motion. \nThis is called the \"Schwinger representation\", it is described on \nWikipedia, formally, it's the very simple identity: 1/(k^2+m^2) = \n\\int_0^\\infty e^{{k^2+m^2)t} dt. The interpretation (when you Fourier \ntransform) is that the probability of going from x to y is the sum over all \npath-lengths of the probability of Brownian walking from x to y. This is \nthe main advance of 1950s physics.\n\nFor this case, scalar fields emitted and absorbed by sources, the particle \npicture doesn't matter at all--- the precise calculation for the Lesage \nwind is done by integrating over momentum states, not by doing particle \nreturn! The bias is momentum states that return, vs. those that go from one \nparticle to the other, this explicitly gives a \"returning wind\" which \nproduces attraction (generically, for same sign sources).\n\nTo do the calculation, you need to consider a free field theory coupled to \na classical source, and make two delta function-like bumps at position x \nand y. The action is the standard field theory action, plus J(x)\\phi(x) \nwith J(x) a classical function. The source J(x), in the Hamiltonian \npicture, is a sum of a classical function of space times a creation \noperator, plus the same function times an annhilation operator. These \noperators make transitions in the field theory which produce/annihilate \nparticles at all momenta k with a given amplitude per unit time, and absorb \nthe same particles also.\n\nThe result is that, to any given order of perturbation theory (or in the \nexact solution, which is the exponential of the second order perturbation \ntheory result) there are particle which are emitted with a fixed momentum, \nkeep this momentum until they are reabsorbed, and then are reabsorbed by \none of the sources. The exact shift in the ground state energy (in the \npresence of sources, the ground state energy includes the source \nattraction/repulsion) is \\int J(x) J(y) K(x-y) over all space (not time, \nstatic sources), where the kernel K is (for static sources) equal to the \nintegral over all time of the propagator K(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \nG(x,t) dt. The calculation can go through intermediate momentum modes, it \nproduces the same integral in Fourier transform.\n\nThe result for sourced free-fields is that there are three processes, \nparticles emitted at position 1 and absorbed at position 1, particle \nself-energy for the source), and also particles which are emitted by one \nsource and absorbed by the other. The net force between the two sources is \nequal to the net flow of momentum, as calculated in the momentum eigenstate \npicture, or in the field path integral, or in any formalism you like. It is \nalways the exact same Lesage wind, there is an imbalance in momentum for \nthe particles emitted vs. the particle absorbed, because of the presence of \nthe other source which produces a shadow on the emissions/absorptions of \nthe first source.\n\nThis shadow is attractive for the simplest case of a scalar field sourced \nby two classical sources of the same sign. It is also intuitive that it is \nan attractive force, the self-energy for perturbing bosonic fields is \nnegative. The more particles can get between the different sources, the \nmore the negative self-energy increases.\n\nThe force becomes repulsive when the classical sources have opposite sign, \nbecause of what I explained, the relative phase of the two sources produce \nback-and-forth paths that reduce rather than enhance the negative \nself-energy. You can see it explicitly on your own, it's free field theory, \nand you do not need to look at anything anyone writes. It is the original \nsource formalism of Feynman, and neglecting the sources produces lack of \nunderstanding.\n\nThe force also changes sign in the case of spin 1, but here there is a \ncompletely different sign issue. This has nothing to do with Pauli \nexclusion (these are always integer spin particles), but because of the \n\"negative norm\" issues, to make a particle picture for photons with a \ntimelike polarization you need to give the timelike photons a weird sign. \nThen the forces are repulsive for like charges. For spin 2, it flips sign \nagain, because of the doubly-negative norm of the 0,0 gravity component. \nThese sign-flips are what Baez is explaining, they are nothing to do with \nwhat I am explaining.\n\n2. The picture I gave does NOT run into any problems at all, you can do all \nthe calculations with scalar particles where there are no issues with gauge \ninvariance, and this is what I explained. Understand the scalar case \ncompletely first, and see that it is true, then you can understand higher \nspin by analogy.\n\nThe issue with ghost particles is just that you don't include them normally \nin a Hamiltonian formulation, because they aren't things you have in \ninitial or final scattering states. You also don't include timelike photons \nin a Hamiltonian formulation either. This means that when you go to spin 1, \nyou have a choice of a lot of different formalisms. But the issue of gauge \ninvariance is a total red-herring. In order to make the force be a \"Lesage \nwind\" you need a formalism which includes the intermediate states exchanged \nas dynamical! So it doesn't work to give a picture in cases where you chose \nthe particles that are exchanged to not exist in the formalism! It's a free \nchoice which fields you include, the only ones you are forced to include \nare propagating states which reach infinity, the S-matrix states.\n\n3. Nonrelativistic Feynman diagrams have no strange properties, they are \ntrivial. The reason is that the Fenyman particles always go forward in \ntime. The property of Pauli exclusion comes from the relative sign of \ncontributions with crossed lines vs. uncrossed, each permutation gives a \ncontribution according to it's sign in the case of Fermions. The reason \nthis \"seems to violate exclusion\" is only because of people being stupid. \nThis is much more trivial than the case of relativistic diagrams, you can \nunderstand both formalisms  from the page \"Schrodinger field\" on Wikipedia.\n\n4. Yes, so what. Of course this is true, you don't need particle exchange \npicture in classical field theory, you have classical fields! The whole \npoint is to give a DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING of how the classical field \npicture emerges, starting from particles only. The two pictures are dual, \nthey are not contradictory.\n\n5. The \"mixing\" of tree and loop level is simply not a mixing at all when \nyou are talking about a free field theory with classical sources, \neverything happens at \"one-loop\" (it's not really unambiguously one loop, \nit's just the only diagram in the theory--- source emission, propagation, \nsource absorption--- x----x in ascii picture, and it can be considered tree \nlevel, except you can consider the source to be the same at absorption and \nemission, and in this case it is interpreted as a loop. In any case, the \nvacuum energy has an integral over momentum in it, and the result is \ndefinite, even if the words you use might be ambiguous).\n\nThe \"mixing\" I am talking about only comes when you make the sources \ndynamical, so that they are also quantum fields rather than classical \nsources. In this case, particles which return are one-loop, and exchanged \nparticles are tree level. The reason is that you are also doing integrals \nover intemediate states of the sources, and these sources complete loops \nonly in those cases where the particles return to the same leg.\n\nThe question of whether you can define a particle picture is then simply \nwhether you can define a consistent method of particles spreading out \ndiffusively in a fake internal time, unrelated to real time. This formalism \nwas constructed by Parisi, it's \"Stochastic quantization\", and this is one \nway of making sense of particle picture non-perturbatively.\n\n6. You need to work out the free-field calculation for yourself, and not \nread so many sources. I am not going to read anything, because I already \nunderstand it perfectly well. I will not cite anything, because I really \ndon't care what other people think.\n\nRegarding the new methods, they are S-matrix methods in essence (sort of, \nthey are the analog of such methods for massless theories), and they are \nmaking sure the intermediate states are on-shell. This is hard to relate to \nthe exchange picture for forces between classical sources, because to have \nclassical sources you are not on shell, you are static in time. You can \nextract this from modern methods, but who cares, it's just meaningless \nirrelevant stuff.\n\nIt's true that Feynman diagrams are clumsy and opaque compared to \"Dixon \ndiagrams\", but it doesn't matter--- the question here is whether you can \nmake sense of particle exchange ideas, and the answer was correctly given \nas yes by Feynman, and there are still to this day people doing nonsense \npropaganda on the other side.",

Of course that this \nmeans really is that while the S-matrix is perfectly nice and physical, its \ndecomposition in Feynman diagrams is in general not. Speaking of Mattuck, \nmy approach to the subject is similar to his: I talk about the diagrams as \nif they were physical because it's convenient, but I constantly remind \nmyself not to read too much into them.\n\n4. Let's imagine that in a parallel universe Maxwell had miraculously \ndiscovered functional integrals before anyone had any idea about quantum \nmechanics. He would then just write down in Euclidean space (schematically \nbecause youtube isn't conducive to writing equations)\n\nZ = (path integral) e^(-S/a)\n\nWhere \"a\" is just a parameter that he would take to zero at the end of the \ncalculation (i.e., take the classical limit). He might then do the usual \nstuff and get Feynman rules, with the additional prescription that only \ntree level diagrams are to be kept. What you find then is a perfectly \nreasonable (if of dubious utility) description of classical E&M.\n\nYou can in principle do the same to other field theories and find the same \nrelationship between the spin of the force carrier and the \nattractiveness/repulsiveness of the interaction without mentioning quantum \nmechanics or self energies at all.\n\n5. This mixing between tree level and one loop doesn't appear \nperturbatively consistent, and happens differently in different situations. \nThe free theory example makes this very clear: the self interactions in the \nclassical sources are at tree level (indeed they must be since they \ncorrespond to the classical self energies in E&M, all \"quantumness\" is \nencoded in the functional determinant), but they're one loop when \nconsidering scattering between asymptotic states in an interacting theory. \nIt seems to me that what your picture is actually describing is screening, \nas is the usual interpretation of the self energies.\n\n6. There's been a lot of recent progress in this direction. I'll cite two \nlines of work.\n\nPeople like Dunne and \u00dcnsal have been discussing the application of \nresurgence to perturbation theory. The main idea is that to recover Borel \nsummability of higher orders in perturbation theory, low order \nnonperturbative saddle points must be included. Or, to flip that upside \ndown, high orders in perturbation theory somehow encode nonperturbative \nphysics. This seems to defy any simple explanation of Feynman diagrams as \nbeing physical processes and adds evidence to the idea that they're \nconvenient ways of expressing contributions to physical amplitudes.\n\nThe now famous work on amplitude calculations by people like Nima \nArkani-Hamed, Zvi Bern and the like shows that there is a compelling \nphysical picture behind amplitude calculations (to all orders) at least in \ncertain conformally invariant theories. This is a rapidly moving field and \nI'll refrain from speculating *too* much about what we will learn on the \nwhole, but at least for N=4 super Yang-Mills it seems that Feynman diagrams \nare very clunky and opaque when compared to the techniques they've \ndeveloped.\n\n(end list)\n\nThat being said however there is a definite way to calculate forces in \nterms of virtual particles that is very physical at least at tree level. I \nwill not reproduce the argument in detail here since it's a bit long but \nyou can look at Baez's masterful exposition. To summarize, the crucial \ningredient that the ordinary pinball description misses is the uncertainty \nprinciple. One ingredient of your description is still there -- the \nattractiveness or repulsiveness of the interaction is dictated by the \nsuperposition of the photon \"momentum space wavefunction\" (really the \namplitude for momentum transfer due to a single photon) with the \nunperturbed \"electron\" wavefunction. \n\nI must emphasize that this is still classical physics, just in a language \nmore appropriate to scattering experiments than static force computations. \n\"Uncertainty principle\" sounds quantumy but here it's just a property of \nFourier transforms. We're doing classical field theory with Bizarro \nMaxwell's formalism, that's all.\n\nSome references will follow in the next post, since google likes to \nclassify long posts containing links as spam.",

            "text": "I agree with everything you said about the video and Higgs mechanism, but \nyou misidentified the problem in the popularizations of Feynman.\n\nThe complaint you give: \"naively, Feynman particle exchange is always \nrepelling\" is resolved when you understand that the loop-expansion in the \nperturbation series is acausal, meaning that it requires the whole history \nto resolve. If you look in any decent Hamiltonian picture, you can't say \n\"the particle emitted a photon which is intended to only be absorbed by the \nsecond particle\", because photons don't come with a label. For all you know \nthat photon is going right back to the first particle which emitted it, in \nwhich case it would be part of the mass-renormalization and wave-function \nrenormalization for the original particle, rather than producing a force. \nThe force-producing things are just a little bit of perturbation on top of \nthe ultraviolet divergent self-interaction.\n\nSo when you are telling a Feynman story which pretends to be causal, you \nneed to say \"the particle emits a bunch of virtual photons at an amplitude \nproportional to its charge\", and then these particles quantumly \nrandom-walk, most of these photons go out and come right back to the \nparticle that emitted them, especially the ones that don't wander about too \nlong, the contributions with short Schwinger parameters.\n\nWhen you put another particle there, and it has opposite charge, you get \nthat some of the particles can go from particle A and get absorbed by \nparticle B, so never getting a chance to reimpact A, and this leads to a \nnet attraction, if you like from the \"Lesage wind\" of returning particles \non particle A, which is lessened because the ones that ended up on B.\n\nWhen the charges are the same, the interference properties make it that the \nprocess of emission and absorption leads to a net repulsion, because the \nones going back an forth make an opposite sign contribution for the return \namplitude. You can think of it as saying that the ones going from one to \nthe other are destructively deleted as compared to the ones that go out \ntoward the other particle and come right back.\n\nThis intuition is omitted from all books, even though it makes both \nattraction and repulsion intuitively comprehensible. Aside from authors not \nknowing about it, I think that the reason is because it isn't compatible \nwith the Feynman loop series expansion. The process of emitting and \nabsorbing the same photon is one-loop, while the classical \nrepulsion/absorption is tree level. The description I gave you above mixes \nthem up, when the contributions are separted in order. The reason you do \nneed to mix them up to understand the processes is because loop counting is \nover the entire history, you need to know what happens to every photon to \ncount loop order.\n\nSo at the end, when you do this acausal Feynman/Stueckelberg loop-order \nthing to describe field theory with particles, you end up reproducing \nattraction and repulsion at tree level, but it is only so because these \ntree-level things are embedded in a broader theory which inclues loop level \nevents.\n\nTo see that what I am saying is actually true,  consider a free field \ncoupled to a classical source, so free E&M coupled to classical currents, \nor a scalar field coupled to a scalar source. The same repulsion paradox \napplies to these sourced free-fields, you can make the same argument that \nthe classical sources must always repel (or attract). But this is trivially \nexactly solvable, and the energy times the total time is J(x) J(y)K(x-y) \nintegrated over all x,y where K is the propagator. When J is the sum of two \ndelta-sources localized at position a and b for all time, you get the net \nattraction/repulsion force K(a-b,t) integrated over all time t. This \nrepresents the particles going from a to b, and gives you both attraction \nand repulsion forces, depending on the signs of the coupling.\n\nBut you see that you threw away the back-and-forth contribution: \nJ(a)J(a)K(a-a,t) and J(b)J(b)K(b-b,t) parts, which are the (divergent for a \npoint source) self-energy of the source. The resulting repulsion or \nattraction is always relative to the base-point energy of the returning \ncontribution, and it can be bigger or smaller, according to the sign, so \nthere is no paradox in either sign for the energy or the force. Then it is \nobvious that the potential energy is due to particles emitted by source A \nand absorbed by source A, particles emitted by source B and absorbed by \nsource B (both divergent energy contributions you need to subtract out) and \nfinally particles emitted by A and absorbed by B, which depending on how \nthey interfere with the self-absorbed particles, produce repulsion or \nattraction, if you like depending on which way their perturbation alters \nthe \"gust of returning particles\" on the sources (but only if you imagine \nthe particles have momentum, and not position, so not in a \nFeynman/Schwinger path picture).\n\nThis picture is now completely accurate, but it mixes up tree and loop \nlevel mathematically, because the returning photons are loop level, and the \nclassical interaction are tree. So while there really is no problem with \nunderstanding attractions intuitively in the Feynman picture (attraction is \nactually more intuitive than repulsions), it is not compatible with the \nmathematically convenient factorization of the  S-matrix diagrams into a \nloop series.\n\nFor sure the billiard ball picture is inaccurate, because it is classical, \nit makes the billiard balls look ballistic, with both position an \nmomentum.  The net force is the gradient of the net energy, not the \nballistic returning momentum, but it can be considered as a suitable \naverage of returning momentum if you do an old-fasioned perturbation \nseries, pre Feynman, where you quantize the field in k-modes and sum over \nthese.",

So even though it ''bounces'' off at the end of the \nline, it is still going the same speed, but has simply just changed it's \ntrajectory, so while it's direction was positive [in reference to the \nobserver] the moment it bounced it would then be going in the negative or \nopposite direction, but still at the same speed.

I do believe inertia describes resistance to change speed but \nthis does not explain the question I have about going from negative speed \nof light, bouncing, and going positive speed of light. When you go from \nnegative to positive at some point in time you must go every single speed \nin the middle even if only a very short period of time, so during that \nbounce you must not be going the speed of light. Does this make any sense \nor is there some law or something i'm missing?",
