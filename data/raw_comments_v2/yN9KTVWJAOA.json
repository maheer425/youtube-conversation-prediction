And when people borrow it they touch the freaking glass! Like \nseriously?! can you not see the handles on that thing?! Oh yeah and about \nthat contacts I planned on giving it a try but...never mind! One day my \nfriend brought her contact lens,just for fun she doesn't have anything \nwrong with her eye. And i of course we all wanna try,just like methen I \nmade a gross theory that maybe once you put the contacts on it'll roll back \nat the back of your eye making them all cringe,but of course they ignored \nme, and it was fun not until a few days later. She brought back her \ncontacts and said she wanna to try it,bit its hard to put it on cause her \neyes are small and kept blinking. Once it finally got on her eye she \nblinked and asked\"did you guys even put it on?\" And all of us looked at her \nand NOT seeing the contacts in her eyes,we started panicking we looked for \nit if it fell somewhere cause we're not gonna make conclusions. And me I \njust panicked that what I just said came true,so my friend decided to look \nat my friend's eye,and to pur surprise...it was IN her eyes where you can't \nsee it anymore cause it's covered by the eyelids and what I said came true \nlike oh my god! I was panicking and shit! But luckily they manage to take \nthe contacts out of her eye while me and in the background\"nah...I ain't \nwearing none of that shit anymore\"....and that's when I stated to fear \ncontact lenses so I rather stick to glasses from now on...well maybe\ufeff",
