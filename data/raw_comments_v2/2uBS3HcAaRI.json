We only run it in open, clean water and never when there \nare other boats with open holding tanks nearby (or in muddy rivers).  We \ncarry about 1,000 liters so can go a week or two without needing to run the \nwater maker.  It is a big one and makes almost 200 liters per hour.

So here is a pretty basic list off the top of my \nhead:  spare belts (alternator and water pump for both main diesel and \ngenerator), spare salt water impellers, enough oil and filters for two oil \nchanges for both, spare fuel filters, spare timing belt, spare water pump, \nspare engine coolant, heat exchanger caps, bilge pump, plenty of water \nmaker pre-filters, spare fresh water pump, spare electric fan motors for \nhot air exhaust, dive compressor filters (and oil).  Plus lot's of random \nbits and pieces I've picked up over the years.  If you have any specific \nquestions on a particular system feel free to email at \nsvdelos53@gmail.com.

We're getting some really, really cool shots and will \nhopefully be working them into videos as we go.  Satellite is just too \nexpensive for us still so we buy local SIM cards and do pre-paid internet \nwhen we can get it.  Up this river where we did this video it took 3 days \nanchored in front of a small village to upload 15 minutes of video.
