If someone asks them whether or not they hold a belief in a god or \ngods, then \"Agnostic\" alone is not a proper answer.

You can do the same with the statement \n\"black people I see on the street after 6PM appear to be thugs\" and have it \nbe accurate based on your perception, your definitions and your setting. \nBut there are strong implications, and a vague generalization that doesn't \naddress the heart of the distinction between atheists and agnostics, or in \nthat case african americans and other ethnicities, doesn't really move the \nconversation anywhere useful.\n\n2) *\"Atheist: God doesn't exist\"*\n\nIf you had a particular individual atheist in mind that were you referring \nto, as opposed to attributing a general assertion to atheism as a whole \n(which actual atheists regularly contradict and correct), then I may have \nmisunderstood.\n\n3) *\"The point about the term Atheism and Agnosticism is really up for \ndebate and opinions can vary\"*\n\nIndeed, yes. All the more reason to avoid a wind-up Speak-N-Say approach as \ntoo many people like to adopt: The cow says Mooo, the chicken says Buckaw! \nI look forward to the day when atheism is a functionally unnecessary \ndistinction, and agnosticism is simply referred to as Common Sense or not \nreferred to at all since everyone takes it for granted.

Drawing \"correlations\" seems like a \npretense for adding definitions or attributes to a label where they have \nnothing to do with the concept being described. That's a very slippery \nslope.\n\n*\"I have never seen Agnostic individuals pertain to such acts.\"*\n\nThe \"act\" I referred to was telling atheists what atheism means, despite \nthe fact that they may say otherwise. Not only is that a daily activity in \nthis comments section, you actually did it *in your first post* by \nasserting what atheists claim... and in your subsequent posts in implying \nthere is some correlation between non-belief in gods and \nsocial/political/internet-message-board activism.\n\n*\"There are no labels for individuals who don't play Badminton or skii.\"*\n\nThis comes up often. That someone doesn't participate in a sport isn't \ngenerally relevant to much of anything.. primarily because it doesn't serve \nas a useful distinction from the people around them. If 3/4 of the world \nbelieved the moon was made of American cheese, you might find it a useful, \nrelevant distinction to say \"I don't believe that crap\". The term \nAgnosticism was coined because Huxley looked around and saw too many people \npretending to know things they didn't, or accepting something as true \nwithout justifiable cause or evidence. It was a distinction from those who \nlacked a reasonable epistemological method, AND to some extent a reminder \nand source of aspiration for those who previously hadn't given it much \nthought.\n\n*\"It seems like once you're declared a particular label then you're \nimmediately associated with any prior activities or miscellaneous \nconducts.\"*\n\nIt seems that way, but is that the fault of labels... or the boobs who feel \nthe need to make lazy generalizations? A label can server a very benign \npurpose, it can offer a general categorization based on a specific \nprinciple or attribute, and it can be *entirely accurate* in that \nrepresentation. Should we abandon the entire concept simply because \nignorant people misuse it and dump their baggage onto the pile?

Atheists and Agnostics are not the same whether you want to \nbelieve it or not.\"*\n\nAlmost everyone here understands that, almost no one here claims they are \nthe same. You could have gleaned that by reading even a modest subsection \nof the comments.\n\n*\"Atheists are constantly attacking and, mocking and making fun of \nChristians, Agnostics don't do that.\"*\n\nThis is a generalization based on your experiences with a small minority of \ninternet atheist activists. Making generalizations based on limited \nexperiences is lazy, and a lot of other uncomplimentary words I won't \nmention. In other words, don't do it. Agnosticism has nothing to do with \npoliteness, tolerance or being non-confrontational any more than atheism \nhas to do with the opposite of those things.\n\n*\"atheists are constantly trying to convince everyone that there is no God, \nand they are constantly trying to recruit people\"*\n\nYou're implying this is a trait common among all or most atheists, and this \nis *empirically* incorrect. Like most people who fire off this claim, you \noffer no proof.\n\n*\"there are many channels here on TY that do that, there are many books, \nand there are even websites\"*\n\nAtheism is a position on belief. It's human nature for those with a \nposition to attempt to argue that position if they feel it's important. A \nsmall percentage create videos or blogs on the topic, an even smaller \npercentage writes books and gives talks. \nThere are agnostics who actively promote philosophical skepticism, and \nwithholding belief until you have sufficient cause or evidence. They're no \ndifferent... they think the world would be better if people thought like \nthey do. (as it happens, they're right... and most atheists agree)\n\n*\"So if that's not a religious, I don't know what that is then.\"*\n\nReligions. Religions are a religion. It's really that simple. Calling other \nthings \"a religion\" is just poetic license, and generally meant as an \ninsult. Apparently you don't have a high opinion of religion, but you hide \nit behind a pacifist facade. \n\nA religion is an organized set of fundamental beliefs about the nature, \ncause, purpose and operation of the universe, usually involving rules of \nconduct or moral imperatives, usually revolving around a supernatural \nentity. Atheists don't necessarily agree on *anything* except that they \ndon't see any reason to believe in \"God\".\n\n\nTo sum up on your primary assertion: we understand Atheism and Agnosticism \nare not the same. No one with any credibility is saying otherwise. The \nargument is over the assertion that atheism and agnosticism are *mutually \nexclusive*. It has been argued extensively, and in my opinion \noverwhelmingly successfully, that this is not the case. You are not either \nmale or dark-haired. They describe different aspects of who you are.\n\n\nRe: science...\n\n*\"For example I believe in evolution but that still doesn't prove that \nthere is no God.\"*\n\nWho is claiming that it does?\n\n*\"The big bang if you analyze it deeply you get to the conclusion that \nsomething has to have existed before\"*\n\nNot really. If the big bang is the start of time, then the concept of \n\"before\" is incoherent. You can make the argument that the universe has \ntechnically always been in a state of expansion, because there was never a \n*time* when time was flowing but the universe wasn't in motion.\n\n*\" I mean nothing can just appear out of nothing.\"*\n\nWho is making this argument (barring equivocation on the term \"nothing)? I \nfeel like I'm asking that a lot.\n\n\nThere's a much deeper conversation going on here than the one you envision, \nOscar... it's been going on for quite a while and it's gotten very deep and \npermeated many aspects of science, philosophy and epistemology. It can't be \nsimplified and summed up in a few obvious admonitions, and it absolutely \nshould not be dismissed with erroneous and insulting stereotypes.",

Whether you entertain the possibility or not is irrelevant, any \nagnostic who doesn't believe in a god is technically an atheist, just like \nany bisexual is also technically homosexual. A lot of agnostics like to \nthink that they walk some imaginary middle ground, but the simple fact is, \nthey are agnostic atheists, just like vast majority of other atheists. They \nsimply don't want to be associated with that group because the in-your-face \natheists (i.e. gnostic atheists) are just as bad as religious nuts these \ndays.\n\nAs for why the word \"atheist\" exists in the first place, it's simply a \nmatter of it having been a minority in the past. In older times, belief in \na deity was more common or even mandatory, but as we grew more \nknowledgeable and capable of explaining events without having to rely on \nblind faith, the amount of people who choose not to believe in a deity is \nsteadily starting to grow.

Any athiest I know would welcome evidence for a god or deity, but \nuntil it arrives or unless it arrives, it stands no point into saying \neither \"maybe he exists\" or claiming that he does exist. Neil De Grasse \nTyson you can either be an active athiest if you want or not. Its like \nsaying \"I'm not Christian, I believe that there is a God and that the Bible \nis the word of God and Jesus is the prophet but I just believe, and I'm not \nout looking for debate thats just what I believe so I'm not a christian\"\ufeff",
