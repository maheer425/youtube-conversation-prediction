He chose to fight this on his own, and we only learnt of his \ndepression in the suicide letter he left us. I have only discovered this \nvideo since Cameron died. He was an animal lover and I am confident that, \nhad he seen it when he was alive, it would have encouraged him to speak up \nand ask for help. We so wish he had.\n\nThe \"Black Dog\" is a metaphor which was used by Winston Churchill (and \nperhaps others before him). Depression feels like a \"living thing\" to me, \none that I need to tame and manage. Use of \"black\" to describe low mood is \nwidespread; I have always thought this was about the night and fear of the \ndark, and not about the colour of skin, or fur. I find the \"Black Dog\" \nmetaphor helpful and have never once thought of it when seeing a real black \ndog. No slight intended on anyone or anything black, but I do see that this \nmay be an unintended consequence. I'd be happy to hear of a better metaphor \nthat still captures the \"living thing\" sense, but without any of the \nnegative connotations.\n\nMany thanks for the video.\ufeff",

            "text": "Focus on... Depression\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBelow is a lovely video on what depression is.\n \nDepression affects so many of us these days and for too many people it is \ndifficult to escape and becomes all encompassing. \n \nTalking therapies are hugely beneficial for many and NICE suggests that GPs \nuse either coun\u00adselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to treat \nmild depression. This has been shown to be more effective in the first \ninstance than medication for most sufferers with less troublesome \nsymp\u00adtoms, but unfortunately availability varies greatly throughout the UK. \nThis form of therapy can be extremely use\u00adful to help people change their \nsometimes negative way of thinking and such treat\u00adments can be life \nchanging, helping peo\u00adple regain normal function without a reliance on \nmedication.\n \nHomeopathy also has a place in treating depression. It can be used where \npatients do not feel that they want to see, or need to see a counsellor or \nther\u00adapist but nevertheless want some help to recover from their illness. \nIt is important to emphasise that homeopathy should not be used as the only \ntreatment in serious depressive illness where there are feelings of wanting \nto die or a risk of suicide, or in mental health problems such as bipolar \ndisorder (manic depression), schizophrenia or severe post\u00adnatal depression. \nThese are complex and potentially life threatening illnesses and need \nadvice from other healthcare pro\u00adfessionals too. Homeopathy may have a part \nto play as an additional or complemen\u00adtary treatment but NOT as a stand \nalone therapy in these situations.\n \nThere are so many homeopathic remedies that can be used to treat the \nnumer\u00adous symptoms of depression and anxiety and here are few key remedies.\n \nArsenicum album\nAn important remedy for those with all the symp\u00adtoms of anxiety with \ndepression, partic\u00adularly when there are gastric symptoms of indigestion \nand diarrhoea, combined with panic attacks.  Somebody needing Arsenicum \nwill probably be neat, tidy but restless. They may look anxious and drawn \nand tend to have a fastidious way about them, being able to give a lot of \ndetail to their symptoms.  They can be hypochondriacs and convinced that \nthey have a physical illness which is being missed because they feel so ill \nand may in fact end up having a num\u00adber of investigations and see various \nhealth professionals before finally accept\u00ading what is wrong with them. \nThey can feel that they will never be well again. Fear is a prominent \nsymptom, causing apprehension and dread, with an over\u00adwhelming feeling that \neverything will go wrong, and they despair of their recov\u00adery. These can be \npatients who are very hard to reassure.\n \nIgnatia\nWhere depression follows from bereave\u00adment, loss, or a shock, such as \nwitness\u00ading a fatal road accident, Ignatia can be useful. The symptom \npicture is typified by emotional ups and downs with mood swings and is \noften quoted in homeo\u00adpathic reference books as \u201claughter alter\u00adnating with \ntears\u201d. Often the sufferer can prove difficult for friends and loved ones \nto deal with as they are SO up and down, being resist\u00adant to sympathy and \noversensitive to well meaning advice, which may be wrongly taken as \ncriticism. Ignatia patients tend to \u201cbottle things up\u201d and cry and give \ndeep sighs during the course of their con\u00adsultation. It may be hard for \nthem to talk if they are overcome with their miser\u00adable situation and \nfriends can find it well nigh impossible to cheer up such patients. Poor \nsleep is common and so is the feel\u00ading of a ball or something stuck in the \nthroat, known conventionally as globus hystericus.\n \nNatrum muriaticum\nAnother remedy that can bottle things up, but reacts quite differently to \nthe Ignatia patient is Natrum muriaticum. This is a frequently used \nhomeopathic treatment for symptoms of stress, such as those typified by \nmild depression. It is very useful when a patient has never been well since \na shock or loss and feels as if they have a glass wall between them and the \nrest of the world. Often they have been unable to cry since bereavement and \nfeel that they have not grieved properly for their loss. They feel worse \nfor sympathy yet are very empa\u00adthetic people. They sometimes build up a \nbarrier emotionally and can appear somewhat cold and distant. They can \nworry about upsetting people uninten\u00adtionally by saying the wrong thing and \ncan themselves take things the wrong way.  They are the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d \ntype, having a strong sense of duty, but can find themselves being \noverwhelmed by the responsibility of their work, especially if they are \ncaring for an elderly or sick relative. Such patients can feel that they \nshould be doing more, not less, and feel they must \u201cjust get on with it\u201d, \nand yet feel more and more tired and low in spirit as time goes on. Grudges \ncan build up, with resentment. There may be an increased sensitivity to \nnoise; certain passages of music may move them to those long awaited tears, \nbut without relief from their low mood.\n \nSepia\nWhen all energy is drained and they feel unworthy of anybody\u2019s love or \nattention Sepia is a great rem\u00adedy which is also wonderful in menopause and \npost\u00adnatal depression. It is often needed for women who are sad, silent, \nsolitary individuals, completely lacking in zest. Tears are never far away \nand a feeling of having to keep emotions under control otherwise one will \nhave to scream is typical of the strain that such patients can feel. There \nis a wish to keep busy but with no incentive to do so and these patients \ncan spend hours sitting motion\u00adless in sadness. Sepia women say that they \nlove their husbands or partners but cannot manage the physical side of the \nrelationship, which they feel is starting to cause difficulties for their \nother halves. Sepia usually suits women who tend to feel chilly and they \ncan either feel incred\u00adibly hungry, being unable to ever feel full or have \nnausea at the mere smell of food. They often have a sinking, or \u201call\u00adgone\u201d \nfeeling in the pit of the stomach, espe\u00adcially when they wake, which is not \nrelieved by eating.\n \nOlder people\nDepression in this older age group (typically 75 +) can sometimes give rise \nto symptoms of forgetfulness and memory loss and lead to a mistaken \ndiagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It can take up to three \nmonths for conventional treatment to have a full effect, and a remedy to \ntry would be Alumina. This is a homeo\u00adpathic potency of aluminium and is \nindi\u00adcated where there is confusion about time (\u201ctime seems to pass too \nslowly\u201d), diffi\u00adculty making decisions, unease in the evening (\u201cas if \nsomething were going to happen\u201d), involuntary weeping without cause and a \ndazed feeling, making mis\u00adtakes in writing and speaking. All such symptoms \nare worse in the morning and tend to improve as the day goes on.\n \nAn alternative to try is Baryta carb which is especially helpful if \nsymptoms are worse with worry or come on after a stroke.\n \nReiki is also a wonderful treatment to turn to in depression and a \nbeautiful article on how beneficial Reiki can be in depression can be found \nhere.\n\n\n \ufeff",

            "text": "Fear not, I assume the vast majority have never suffered depression or had \nthe experience of someone close to them suffering with it. The video is an \nexcellent representation of the way it affects your life. I see some think \nthe negative comments would affect a person suffering with depression. For \nsome it will, for some it won't. For those that know they have depression \nthey will have medical advice. The key is you don't know you have it, until \nan expert tells you. Then you realise the world seems devoid of an \nunderstanding of it (including me some time back). Now I know the black dog \nas well as anyone, I found myself a little sad thinking back watching the \nvideo but laughing aloud at some of the comments. It confirms the complete \nlack of understanding and comforts those that suffer. As the author of \n'Curse of the strong' said (those that suffer it's a must read), if they \nhad called it by the name of the person that discovered it, and put disease \non the end, then it would capture attention. The fact is, and this is for \nsufferers, contrary to popular belief, it is the strong folk in life that \nare more likely to be hit, not the weak. The weak show emotion daily, so \nthey don't get the years of build up of pressure that sets the illness in \nmotion. The strong tend to help the weak, but sometimes they do too much, \nand the more help they give the more help is requested, Then one day, \nthings start to go wrong. Your memory starts playing up, facts simply don't \nembed themselves. Irritability creeps in, crying, anger, frustration and \ndespair. What the hell is going on?, you look for things in your life that \nare causing your mood change, work, marriage, anything to find a reason. \nYou do and say really strange things, emotionally hurting those close to \nyou. You avoid contact, but when forced work overtime to try and hide the \ntruth. The harder you fight it, the greater it takes control of you and the \nharder you fall (just like in the video). Then at it's pit, you feel like \nyou are sat surrounded by 4 walls with an infinite height, just you, and \nthe dark, with death as the only obvious escape. You either wish you could \ndie or contemplate ways to achieve that. They say folks that commit suicide \nare selfish, yet if you understand depression, then it all makes sense. \nThey are not selfish, they are desperate lonely people, trying to escape \nthe black dog which has become too unbearable, and is destroying them, they \ncan think of nothing else. We are deeply ashamed that we can no longer \nfunction and support those we love, we hate not being able to do that as it \nwas previously our sole goal in life. We drag them down too, they are \nunwell now, all we sought to achieve is in reverse, and the spiral \ncontinues down. The best way to help those we love is to release them from \nus, the burden, so they can move on in life. Selfish to commit suicide NO. \nMost of the time the intent is to help, cure yourself and lift the burden \nyou have created. It feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel, \nit just gets darker. There is light but just don't chase it, it can be a \nvery long road, but the light is there and it will find you. If you push to \nfind it, you will fail and the situation will become worse.\n\nSo if you find yourself crying for no reason, becoming irritable, and \nlooking for something to blame, visit your Dr, you are heading into \ndepression, or rather you have had the early stages for years and don't \nknow it\n\nAs one that understands it. I fully understand the posts where people have \nno clue about it. Black because when in the dark that is the only colour \nyou see, that's just nature. Who is supposed to be man's (or woman's) best \nfriend? a dog. So a black dog is perfect for those that suffer depression.\n\nAs for the comments about depression is preventable, how on earth can you \nbe aware of something you don't know you have got. That said someone who \nhas suffered or has training can spot it very quickly in others, in minutes.\n\nTell them that and you will hear  \"Depressed me. are you serious\"? That's \nfor the weak, I don't need to see a doctor\". \n\nYOU DO ... GET OVER IT.....OR IT WILL GET OVER YOU. \n\nWHEN IT DOES YOUR WORLD AND FAMILY WILL FALL APART. IT'S A VILE HORRENDOUS \nEXPERIENCE, AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST ILLNESSES OUT THERE. \n\nI FEAR IT MORE THAN I FEAR DEATH. DEATH IS A CURE, BUT SO IS LIFE IF YOU \nALLOW OTHERS TO HELP YOU.\n\nMAKE LIFE YOUR CHOICE AND SLOWLY WORK THAT BLACK DOG TO HEEL. THERE IS A \nPOT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THAT TUNNEL. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT IT IS \nTHERE, TRUST ME...\n\nBEST WISHES TO ALL SUFFERERS, AND ALL THOSE THAT CARE FOR THOSE THAT \nSUFFER, AS THEY ARE THE VICTIMS OF THIS DISEASE TOO, PROBABLY MORE SO.\n\nDON'T FIGHT IT, JUST HANG IN THERE, AND SEEK HELP.\ufeff",

            "text": "Those people saying that using a 'black dog' as a metaphor is wrong because \nin dog homes these are the first dogs to be put down. What is 'black' as a \ncolour being used to signify depression compared to 'red' being used to \nsignify anger? Darkness isn't a state in itself, it is an absence of light. \nBlackness is an absence of any colour, colour is usually a source or sight \nof vitality to many. To many of us who have been affected by the illness of \ndepression, this has been a wonderful use of metaphor, in fact, for me it \nwas a breath of fresh air, a new type of understanding into myself and the \npathways that depression affects me. The struggle still goes on largely, \nalthough it may not be every single day, it sweeps through when it is least \nexpected. Perhaps largely this is where the lack of understanding comes in \nbetween mental health issues and issues that are closer to peoples hearts \ni.e. caring for unwanted animals, rather than caring for their fellow human \nbeings. If we invested as much time into care for other species than we did \nto our own (granted we are an awful species ourselves, draining the earth \nof it resources) then perhaps mental health would be less of a stigma and \ntaboo in todays world than it is currently. For those fellow sufferers, \nfind someone you are comfortable talking to, a silent listener can mean \nmore than a thousand words. Keep believing, even in the hardest times, that \nyou can get through it. For anyone who can beat the disease depression, is \na thousand times stronger than before it ever hit. For me, the struggle \nstill continues, but I see that it is now achievable to make it through, \neven if in the darkest times it feels futile. \ufeff",

No \nse trata de una peque\u00f1a tristeza, sino de un oscuro abismo que puede llegar \na dominar por completo la vida de quien la padece.\nBuscar ayuda es el primer y m\u00e1s importante paso hacia la recuperaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn colaboraci\u00f3n con la OMS para conmemorar el D\u00eda Mundial de la Salud \nMental, el escritor e ilustrador Mateo Johnstone cuenta la historia de \nsuperaci\u00f3n del \u201cperro negro de la depresi\u00f3n\u201d, figura metaf\u00f3rica que utiliza \npara describir qu\u00e9 es y como se siente una persona con esta patolog\u00eda.\n\nMir\u00e1 este video, y si conoces a alguien que est\u00e9 en esta situaci\u00f3n y \ntodav\u00eda no haya recurrido a la b\u00fasqueda de ayuda hazle llegar este video. \nTambi\u00e9n si al verlo te sentis identificado, que est\u00e1s pasando por la \ncompa\u00f1\u00eda de este gran perro negro, busca lo antes posible a un psicologo y \nanimate a vivir de nuevo.\ufeff",
