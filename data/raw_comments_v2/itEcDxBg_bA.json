It's hard as hell, exhausting.\nRisk is high, ropes are long & strong and they're not elastic. Injury risk \ndue to falling off the skis/bike also is very high.  Speed - up to 60mph. \nJumps - up to 5m/15ft. You have to be a bit insane to do this, but it is \nAWESOME. Red Bull Twitch N Ride actually is the crown jewel of the season, \nother races are organized on flat fields without jumps. Altough this is \nhardest race in the season, I would (and I will) do it agin next year. \nCheers!\ufeff",
