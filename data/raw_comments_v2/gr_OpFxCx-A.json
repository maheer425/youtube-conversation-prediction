            "text": "BRAVEHEART Robert the Bruce (narrator): I shall tell you of William \nWallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is \nwritten by those who have hanged heroes. The king of Scotland had died \nwithout a son, and the King of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the \nLongshanks, claimed the thrown of Scotland for himself. Scotland's nobles \nfought him, and fought each other over the crown. So Longshanks invited \nthem to talks of truce, no weapons, one page only. Among the farmers of \nthat shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands. He had two \nsons: John and William. Malcolm: I told you to stay. William: Well, I \nfinished my work. Where are we going? Malcolm: MacAndrews. He was supposed \nto fess up when the gathering was over. William: Can I come? Malcolm: No. \nGo home, boy. William: But I want to go. Malcolm: Go home William or you'll \nthe back of my hand. John: Follow him, William. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMalcolm: MacAndrews; MacAndrews. Great Jesus! William: Ah! (screams) \nMalcolm: It's all right! William! John: William! Malcolm: It's all right. \nEasy lad. Dead Page Boy: William! (in Wallace's house) Campbell: We fight \nthem! MacClannough: Every nobleman who had the will to fight was at that \nmeeting. We can not beat an army. Malcolm: We do not have to defeat them. \nJust fight them. Now who's with me. Campbell (among others): I am, Wallace. \nMacClannough: Alright, alright. Malcolm: Ay. Malcolm: Where do you think \nyou're going? William: I'm going with you. Malcolm: Oh, you're going with, \nhey? And what are you going to do? William: I'm gonna help. Malcolm: Hey, \nand a good help you'd be, too. But I need you to stay here and look after \nthe place for me while I'm away. William: I can fight! Malcolm: I know. I \nknow you can fight. But it's out wits that make us men. See you tomorrow. \nJohn: Ha! Hamish: English! William: Get down! Hamish: With your father and \nbrother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm. William: It's up to us, \nHamish. Both boys: Ahhhh! (Throw rocks) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Da? Da? Campbell: William, come here lad. (Funeral) Priest: \n(speaks Latin) Argyle: William, I am your uncle, Argyle. You have the look \nof your mother. Argyle: We'll stay here tonight. Tomorrow you'll come home \nwith me. William: I don't want to leave. Argyle: You didn't want your \nfather to die either, did ya? But it happened. Did the priest give a poetic \nbenediction? \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee\"? William: It was in Latin. \nArgyle: You don't speak Latin? Well that's something we shall have to \nremedy, isn't it. Argyle: The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord cause \nhis light to shine on thee. The Lord lift up his continence upon thee. And \ngive thee peace. Amen. Dead Malcolm: Your heart is free. Have the courage \nto follow her. (Campbell plays bagpipes) William: What are they doing? \nArgyle: Saying goodbye in their own way. Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed \npipes. It was the same for me and your daddy, when our father was killed. \n(William looks at sword) Argyle: First, learn to use this (mind), then I'll \nteach you to use this (sword). \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert the Bruce (narrator): Many years later, Edward the Longshanks, King \nof England, supervised the wedding of his eldest son, who would succeed him \nto the thrown. As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen the daughter of \nhis rival, the King of France. It was widely whispered that for the \nprincess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That \nmay have been what he had in mind all along. Longshanks: Scotland, my land. \nThe French will grovel to anyone with strength, but how will they believe \nour strength when we can not rule the whole of our own island? Longshanks: \nWhere is my son? Isabella: Your pardon, my Lord. He asked me to come in his \nstead. Longshanks: I sent for him and he sends you? Isabella: Shall I \nleave, my Lord? Longshanks: If he wants his Queen to rule when I am gone, \nthen by all means stay, and learn how. Please. Longshanks: Nobles. Nobles \nare the key to the door of Scotland. Grant our nobles lands in the north. \nGive their nobles estates here in England, and make them too greedy to \noppose us. Advisor: But sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot. New \nlands mean new taxes, and they are already taxed for the war in France. \nLongshanks: Are they? Are they? The trouble with Scotland is that it's full \nof Scots. Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom. Grant \nthem prima noctes. First night, when any common girl inhabiting their lands \nis married, our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her \nwedding. If we can't get them out, we breed them out. That should fetch \njust the kind of lords we want to Scotland, taxes or no taxes. Advisor: A \nmost excellent idea, sire. Longshanks: Is it? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert the Bruce (narrator): Now in Edinburgh, gathered the council of \nScottish nobles. Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, the \nleading contender for the crown of Scotland. Robert the Bruce: I hear that \nLongshanks has granted prima noctes. Craig: Clearly meant to draw more of \nhis supporters here. Robert the Bruce: My father believes that we must lull \nLongshanks into confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing \nit. Craig: A wise plan. And how is your father? We missed him at the \ncouncil. Robert the Bruce: Ah. His affairs in France keep him long overdue, \nbut he sends his greetings. And he says that I speak for all the Bruces, \nand for Scotland. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: (rides home and smells air) (wedding celebration; music playing) \nWilliam: You dropped your rock. Hamish: Test of manhood. William: You win. \nHamish: Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train \nwith weapons, so we train with stones. William: Well, a test of a soldier \nis not in his arm, it's here (mind). Hamish: No, it's here (arm) (Hamish \nhits William) William: Hamish? Hamish: Uh huh. (drumming, rock throwing \ncontest) Campbell: Here you go, son. Show him how. Come on! Haha, my boy! \nWilliam: That's a good throw. Hamish: Ay. Ay, it was. William: I was \nwondering if you could do that when it matters. As it, as is matters in \nbattle. Can you crush a man with that throw? Hamish: I could crush you, \nlike a worm. William: You could? Hamish: Ay. William: Well then do it. \nWould you like to see him crush me like a worm? Crowd: Ay! William: Then do \nit. Hamish: You'll move. William: I will not. Campbell: He'll move. (Hamish \nmisses, William hits Hamish) Campbell: Fine display, young Wallace. \nWilliam: You alright? You look a widdy bit shaky. Hamish: I should have \nremembered the rocks. William: Ay, you should have. Get up you big heap. \nIt's good to see you again. Hamish: Ay, welcome home. Girl: William, will \nyou dance with me? William: Of coarse I will. (Horses ride in) English \nlord: I have come to claim the right of prima noctes. As lord of these \nlands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the \nfirst night of her union. Scottish man: By God, you will not! Lord: It is \nmy noble right. (They ride off with bride). Smythe: Ha ha. Ha ha. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(raining, outside of Murron's house) William: Good evening, sir. \nMacClannough: Ah, young Wallace. Grand soft evening, huh? William: Ay, is \nthat. I was wondering if I might have a word with your daughter. \nMacClannough: What do you want to have a word with her about? William: \nWell, ah, Murron, would you like to come and ride with me on this fine \nevening? Mrs. MacClannough: In this? You're out of your mind. William: Oh, \nit's good Scottish weather, madam. The rain is fallin' straight down, well \nslightly to the side like. Mrs. MacClannough: She can not go with you. \nWilliam: No? Mrs. MacClannough: No the no, anyway. William: No the no. \nMacClannough: No the no. We'll see you later. Murron: 'O the weather's just \nfine. It's hardly raining. Mrs. MacClannough: Did you no hear what I said? \nNow get-Murron. It's you she takes after. William: How did you know me \nafter so long? Murron: Why, I didn't. William: No? Murron: It's just that I \nsaw you staring at me and I didn't know who you were. William: 'O sorry, I \nsuppose I was. Are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with \nstrangers? Murron: It was the best way to make you leave. William: Well, if \nI can ever work up the courage to ask you again, I'll send you a written \nwarning first. Murron: 'O it wouldn't do you much good. I can't read. \nWilliam: Can you not? Murron: no. William: Well that's something we shall \nhave to remedy, isn't it. Murron: You're going to teach me to read, then? \nWilliam: Ah, if you like. Murron: Ay. William: In what language? Murron: \nAre you showing off now? William: That's right. Are you impressed yet? \nMurron: No. Why should I be? William: (in French) Yes. Because every single \nday I thought about you. Murron: Do that standing on your head and I'll be \nimpressed. William: My kilt may fly up but I'll try. Murron: You certainly \ndidn't learn any manners on your travels. William: I'm afraid the Romans \nhave far worse manners than I. Murron: You've been to Rome? William: Ay, my \nuncle took me on a pilgrimage. Murron: What was it like? William: (in \nFrench) Not nearly as beautiful as you. Murron: What does that mean? \nWilliam: Beautiful. But I belong here. Mrs. MacClannough: Murron, come in \nnow. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Sir, I know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last \nnight, but I assure you I- Campbell: MacClannough's daughter is another \nmatter. I've come to fetch you to a meeting. William: What kind of meeting? \nCampbell: The secret kind. MacClannough: Your meetings are a waste of time, \nCampbell. Campbell: Your father was a fighter, and a patriot. William: I \nknow who my father was. I came back home to raise crops, and God willing a \nfamily. If I can live in peace, I will. MacClannough: You say you want to \nstay out of the troubles? William: Ay. MacClannough: If you can prove it, \nyou may court my daughter. Until you prove it, my answer is no. William: \nNo? MacClannough: No Wallace, no. William: Didn't I just prove it? \nMacClannough: No. William: No? MacClannough: No. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Of coarse, running a farm is a lot of work, but that will all \nchange when my sons arrive. Murron: So, you've got children? William: Well \nnot yet, but I was hoping that you could help me with that. Murron: So you \nwant me to marry you, then? William: Well, that's a bit sudden but alright. \nMurron: Is that what you call a proposal? William: I love you. Always have. \nI want to marry you. Is that a yes? Murron: Ay, that's a yes. William: We \nbest hurry. He'll be waiting. Murron: Wait. William: Where are you going? \nWilliam: What's that? Murron: You'll see. William: Father. William: I will \nlove you my whole life; you and no other. Murron: And I you; you and no \nother forever. Priest: (speaks Latin) William: When am I gonna see you \nagain? Tonight? Murron: I can't. William: Why not? Murron: My dad's gotten \nsuspicious. William: Not as suspicious as you (?). When? Murron: Tonight. \nWilliam: Tonight? Murron: Ay. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSmythe: Look lively, sergeant. Smythe: Where are you going lassie? Oo, that \nlooks heavy. Let me help you. Murron: That's fine. Smythe: 'O, you remind \nme of my daughter back home. Smythe: Hello lassie. Soldier: Keep going, \nSmythe. (lots of screaming) Smythe: Ah, you bitch. William: Are you \nalright? Murron: Ay. William: Can you ride? Murron: Ay. Smythe: Come back \nhere, you bastard. William: Meet me at the grove. Ride. Smythe: They're \ngetting away. William: Murron? Murron? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMagistrate: All of you know full well the great pains I've always taken \nnever to be to strict, to rigid, with the application of our laws. And as a \nconsequence, have we not learned to live together in relative peace and \nharmony? Ha? And this day's lawlessness is how you repay my leniency. Well \nyou leave me with little choice. An assault on the king's soldiers is the \nsame as an assault on the king himself. (He kills Murron) Magistrate: Now, \nlet this scrapper come to me. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSoldier: There. (points at William) (fighting starts) Magistrate: Corporal, \nsummon archers on the tower, now. Hamish: Hold still, father. Campbell: \nAhh, boy! (William kills Magistrate) Campbell: MacClannough, MacClannough! \nCrowd of Scotsmen: MacClannough, MacClannough, WALLACE, WALLACE! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Murron's Funeral) Priest: (speaks Latin) Mrs. MacClannough: (crying) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCampbell: What cha waiting for, boy? Hamish: Here. You can do it. I'll hold \nhim down. Morrison: Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down. Campbell: Ay, \nstraight in, boy. I know it seems like a waste of good whiskey, but indulge \nme. AHHH. Hamish: Hold him! Hold him! Scottish man: Let him go. Sorry. \nCampbell: That will wake you up in the morning, boy. Watch guard: There's \nsomebody coming. Arm yourselves. Hamish: There's somebody coming. Campbell: \nMacGregors, from the next clan. MacGregor: We heard about what was \nhappening, and we don't want you armidants thinking you can have your fun \nwithout us. William: Go home. Some of us are in this. We can't help that \nnow. But you can help yourselves. Go home. MacGregor: We'll have no homes \nleft when the English garrison from the castle comes through and burns us \nout. And they will. William and Campbell: Welcome! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(William's army enters, dressed as English patrol) English soldier: Patrol \nreturning, my Lord. English Lord: So, what news? (William hits Lord) \nEnglish Lord: I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark. They will be \nreturning now. William: Were they dressed like this? Actually, it was more \nlike 50. Make it quick. Morrison: Do you remember me? Lord: I never did her \nany harm. It was my right. Morrison: Your right? Well I'm here to claim the \nright as a husband. William: I am William Wallace, and the rest of you will \nbe spared. Go back to England, and tell them there that Scotland's \ndaughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. Burn \nit. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(in English castle) Longshanks: Scottish rebels have routed one of my \ngarrisons and murdered the noble lord. Prince: I heard. This Wallace is a \nbrigand, nothing more. Longshanks: And how would you deal with this \nbrigand? Prince: Like any common thief. Have the local magistrate arrest \nhim and punish him accordingly. Longshanks: Leave us. Wallace has already \nkilled the magistrate and taken control of the town. Stand up. Stand up. In \nthe morning, I depart for France to press our rights there, and I leave you \nhere to quell this little rebellion, understood? Is it? One day you will be \na king. At least try to act like one. Prince: Get away from me. I will need \nmy military council. Nicolette: (in French) I hope your husband goes to \nScotland and meets Wallace and then you'll be a widow. English soldier: \nAfter them. English leader: No point resisting. You're outnumbered and \ntrapped. Now where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Father? Leper: Ah, come in, come in. Robert: A rebellion has begun. \nLeper: Under whom? Robert: A commoner named William Wallace. Leper: We will \nembrace this rebellion. Support it from our lands in the north. I will gain \nEnglish favor by condemning it, and ordering it opposed from our lands in \nthe south. Sit down. Stay a while. Robert: This Wallace, he doesn't even \nhave a knighthood, but he fights with passion and he inspires. Leper: And \nyou wish to charge off and fight as he did. So would I. Robert: Well, maybe \nit's time. Leper: It is time to survive. You're the 17th Robert Bruce. The \n16 before you passed you land and title because they didn't charge in. Call \na meeting of the nobles. Robert: But they do nothing but talk. Leper: \nRightly so. They're as rich in English titles and lands as they are in \nScottish, just as we are. Admire this man, this William Wallace. \nUncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage, so does a dog. But \nit is exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble. And \nunderstand this: Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit in \nthe thrown of England. And none of us, and nothing of Scotland will remain, \nunless we are as ruthless. Give in to our nobles. Knowing their minds is \nthe key to the thrown. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nPrince: Wait. Wait. Look. This is right and this is left. Carry on. Carry \non. Nicolette: (in French) When the king returns, he will bury them in \nthose new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending \nan army north. Isabella: (in French) How do you know this? Nicolette: (in \nFrench) Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. Isabella: (in \nFrench) He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed. Nicolette: (in French) \nEnglishmen don't know what a tongue is for. Isabella: (in French) Ah. This \nScottish rebel, Wallace. He fights to avenge a woman? Nicolette: (in \nFrench) I nearly forgot. A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he \nhad a secret lover. So he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight, \nand fight he did. Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted \nto take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother, and \nsetting an ambush at the grave of his love. He fought his way through the \ntrap and carried her body to a secret place. Now that's love, no? Isabella: \nLove? I wouldn't know. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: You know, eventually Longshanks will send his whole Northern Army \nagainst us. Campbell: Heavy cavalry, armored horse; shake the very ground. \nHamish: They'll ride right over us. William: Uncle Argyle used to talk \nabout it; how no army had ever stood up to a charge of heavy horse. Hamish: \nSo what'll we do? Campbell: Run, hide, the highland way. William: We'll \nmake spears. Hundreds of them. Long spears, twice as long as a man. Hamish: \nThat long? William: Ay. Hamish: Some men are longer than others. Campbell: \nYour mother's been telling stories about me again, ah? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nGuard: Volunteers coming in. Faudron: William Wallace, we've come to fight \nand to die for ya. William: Stand up, man. I'm not the pope. Faudron: My \nname is Faudron, and my sword is yours. I brought you this. Guard: We \nchecked them for arms. Faudron: I brought you this. My wife made it for ya. \nWilliam: Thank you. Stephen: (laughs) Him? That can't be William Wallace. \nI'm prettier than this man. Alright Father, I'll ask him. If I risk my neck \nfor you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? Hamish: Is your father a \nghost or do you converse with the Almighty? Stephen: In order to find his \nequal, an Irishman is forced to talk to God. Yes, Father. The Almighty says \ndon't change the subject; just answer the fooking question. Hamish: Mind \nyour tongue. Campbell: Insane Irish. Stephen: (pulls dagger on Campbell) \nSmart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man. William: That's my \nfriend, Irishman. And the answer to your question is yes; if you fight for \nme you get to kill the English. Stephen: Excellent. Stephen is my name. I'm \nthe most wanted man on my island, except I'm not on my island, of coarse. \nMores the pity. Hamish: Your island? You mean Ireland. Stephen: Yeah. It's \nmine. Hamish: You're a madman. Stephen: I've come to the right place, then. \n(everyone laughs) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Faurdon trys to kill Wallace, but Stephen saves him) Stephen: Sure didn't \nthe Almighty send me to watch your back? I didn't like him anyway. He \nwasn't right in the head. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nHamish: William, it's our runners. Morrison: The English are devising an \narmy towards Scotland. William: Will the nobles rally? Runner: Robert the \nBruce and most of the others will not commit to battle. But word is spread, \nand highlanders are coming down on their own. Morrison: Ay, in flocks of \nhundreds and thousands. William: Are you ready for a war? Mornay: Well, \nwhat news? Horseman: We're outnumbered, at least 3 to 1. Mornay: How many \nhorse, then? Horseman: 300, maybe more. Mornay: 300 heavy horse? Lochlan: \nWe must try to negotiate. Short soldier: What are they talking about? Tall \nsoldier: I can't hear, but it doesn't look good. The nobles will negotiate. \nIf they do a deal, then we go home. And if not, we charge. Mornay: 300 \nheavy horse; we have no chance. Short soldier: I didn't come here to fight \nso they can own more lands; then I have to work for them. Tall soldier: Nor \nme. Alright lads. I have no time for these bastards; lets go home. Lochlan: \nStop men. Do not leave. Wait until we've negotiated. Short soldier: William \nWallace? Tall soldier: Can't be. Not tall enough. Stephen: The Almighty \nsays this must be a fashionable fight. It's drawn the finest people. \nLochlan: Where is thy salute? William: For presenting yourselves on this \nbattlefield, I give you thanks. Lochlan: This is our army. To join it you \ngive homage. William: I give homage to Scotland. And if this is your army, \nwhy does it go? Tall soldier: We didn't come here to fight for them. Short \nsoldier: Home. The English are too many. William: Sons of Scotland, I am \nWilliam Wallace. Short soldier: William Wallace is 7 feet tall. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Yes, I've heard. Kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here \nhe'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of \nlightning from his ass. I am William Wallace, and I see before me an army \nof my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as \nfree men, and free men you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you \nfight? Tall soldier: Fight against that? No, we will run, and we will live. \nWilliam: Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while. \nAnd dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade \nall the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come \nback here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll \nnever take our freedom. (cheering) English lord: They seem quite optimistic \nto me. Maybe they do want to fight. Cheltham: Confrontation might be a \nforegone conclusion, my lord. But none the less, I think we should deliver \nthe king's terms. Lord: The king's terms will never live up to them. \nCheltham: My lord, I think-. Lord: Alright, offer them the terms. Craig: \nThey're coming out. Shall we go and meet them? Stephen: Fine speech. Now \nwhat do we do? William: Just be yourselves. Hamish: Where are you going? \nWilliam: I'm going to pick a fight. Hamish: Well, we didn't get dressed up \nfor nothing. Cheltham: Mornay, Lochlan, Craig. Here are the king's terms. \nLead this army off field and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, \nincluding hereditary title, from which you will pay-, from which you will \npay him an annual duty-. William: I have an offer for you. Mornay: \nCheltham, this is William Wallace. Cheltham: From which you will pay the \nking an annual duty-. William: I said I have an offer for you. Lochlan: You \ndisrespect a banner of truce? William: From his king? Absolutely. Here are \nScotland's terms. Lower your flags, and march straight back to England, \nstopping at every home to beg forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape, and \nmurder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you \nwill die today. Cheltham: You are outmatched. You have no heavy cavalry. In \ntwo centuries no army has won without-. William: I'm not finished. Before \nwe let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself \nbefore this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass. \nMornay: I'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to. William: \nYou be ready and do exactly as I say. On my signal, ride round behind our \nposition and flank them. Mornay: We must not divide our forces. William: Do \nit, and let the English see you do it. Mornay: They'll think we've run \naway. William: Take out their archers, and I'll meet you in the middle. \nMornay: Alright. Priest: (speaks Latin) English Lord: Insolent bastard. I \nwant this Wallace's head on a plate. Archers. (Scots scream) Stephen: The \nLord says He can get me out of this mess, but He's pretty sure you're \nfooked. Ah! (Scots scream) William: Ride! Lord: See, every Scot with a \nhorse is fleeing. Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Send the \nhorse; full attack. William: Hold! Hold! Hold! Now! (lots of screaming) \nLord: Send the infantry. Cheltham: My Lord? Lord: You lead them. (lots of \nfighting) Lord: Retreat! William: Alright. William: (screaming) Scottish \narmy: (screaming) WALLACE! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCraig: I knight thee Sir William Wallace. Sir William, in the name of God \nwe declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland and thy \nCaptains as aides-de-camp. Stand and be recognized. Robert: Does anyone \nknow his politics? Craig: No, but his weight with the commoners can \nunbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass so we must. Balliol \nsupporter: Sir William, Sir William. Inasmuch as you and your captains hail \nfrom a region long known to support the Balliol clan, may we invite you to \ncontinue your support and uphold our rightful claim. (screaming) William: \nGentlemen!, Gentlemen! Balliol supporter: Now is the time to declare a \nking. Mornay: Wait! Then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate \nsuccession. Balliol supporter: You're the ones who won't support the \nrightful claim. Mornay: Those were lies when you first wrote them. Balliol \nsupporter: I demand recognition of these documents. Craig: Gentlemen! \nPlease, Gentlemen! Wait! Sir William, where are you going? William: We have \nbeaten the English, but they'll come back because you won't stand together. \nCraig: Well what will you do? William: I will invade England and defeat the \nEnglish on their own ground. Craig: Invade? That's impossible. William: \nWhy? Why is that impossible? You're so concerned with squabbling for the \nscraps from Longshank's table that you've missed your God given right to \nsomething better. There is a difference between us. You think the people of \nthis country exist to provide you with possession. I think your possession \nexists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make sure that \nthey have it. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Wait! I respect what you said, but remember that these men have \nlands and castles. It's much to risk. William: And the common man who \nbleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? Robert: No, but from top to \nbottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance \nwith England. Its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both \nsides of the border, you'll end up dead. William: We all end up dead; it's \njust a question of how and why. Robert: I'm not a coward. I want what you \nwant, but we need the nobles. William: We need them? Robert: Ay. William: \nNow tell me, what does that mean to be noble? Your title gives you claim to \nthe thrown of our country, but men don't follow titles, they follow \ncourage. Now our people know you. Noble, and common, they respect you. And \nif you would just lead them to freedom, they'd follow you. And so would I. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRoyal Governor of York: Damn it! The sodomite my cousin the prince tells me \nhe has no troops to lend and every town in Northern England is begging for \nhelp. Soldier: Wallace rides! Governor: To which town? Soldier: To here my \nLord. Governor: Bring the food and provisions inside, double the wall \nguards, seal the gate, now! Soldier: Quickly, bring in the provisions, seal \noff the gate, NOW! Soldier: Sir, we can get you out if you leave now. \nGovernor: I am not about to tell my Uncle I've lost him the greatest city \nin Northern England. William: Come on! Scottish soldiers: AAAHHH! (lots of \ncheering, gate on fire) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(back in London) Soldier: Make way for the King. Philip: It's not your \nfault. Stand up to him. Prince: I will stand up to him and more. \nLongshanks: What news of the North? Prince: Nothing new, Your Majesty. \nWe've sent riders to speed any word. Longshanks: I heard the word in \nFrance, where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom. The word, my \nson, is that our entire Northern Army has been annihilated. And you have \ndone nothing. Prince: I have ordered conscriptions. They are assembled and \nready to depart. Soldier: Excuse me, sire, but there is a very urgent \nmessage from York. Longshanks: Come. Leave us. Soldier: Yes, sire. Prince: \nWallace has sacked York. Longshanks: What? Prince: Wallace has sacked York. \nAh! Philip: Sire, thy own nephew. What beast could do such a thing? \nLongshanks: If he can sack York, he can invade lower England. Philip: We \nwould stop him! Longshanks: Who is this person who speaks to me as though I \nneeded his advise? Prince: I have declared Philip my High Counselor. \nLongshanks: Is he qualified? Philip: I am skilled in the arts of war and \nmilitary tactics, sire. Longshanks: Are you? Then tell me, what advice \nwould you offer on the present situation? (Longshanks kick's Philip out the \nwindow) Philip: AAAHHH! (Longshanks kicks Prince) Longshanks: I shall offer \na truce and pie him off. But who will go to him? Not I, huh, if I fell \nunder the sword of that murderer that might be my head in a basket. And not \nmy gentle son. The mere sight of him would only encourage the enemy to take \nover the whole country. So who do I send? Whom do I send? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: I'm dreaming. Murron: Yes you are, and you must wake. William: I \ndon't want to wake. I want to stay here with you. Murron: And I with you. \nBut you must wake now. Wake up, William. Wake up. William, wake up. \nCampbell: William, a royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, with \nthe standard of Longshanks himself. Isabella: I am the Princess of Wales. I \ncome as the king's servant and with his authority. William: To do what? \nIsabella: To discuss the king's proposals. Will you speak with a woman? \nIsabella: I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight. \nWilliam: I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. Isabella: \nDid God make you the sacker of peaceful cities, the executioner of the \nking's nephew, my husband's own cousin? William: York was the staging point \nfor every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged innocent \nScots, even women and children, from the city walls. Oh, Longshanks did far \nworse the last time he took a Scottish city. Hamilton: (in Latin) He is a \nbloody murdering savage. And he's telling lies. William: (in Latin) I never \nlie. But I am a savage. (in French) Or in French if you prefer. (in \nEnglish) You ask your king to his face, ask him, and see if his eyes can \nconvince you of the truth. Isabella: Hamilton, leave us. Hamilton: My lady? \nIsabella: Leave us. Now. Let us talk plainly. You invade England, but you \ncan not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply. The king \ndesires peace. William: Longshanks desires peace? Isabella: He declares it \nto me, I swear it. He proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he \ngrants you title, estates, and this chest of gold which I am to pay to you \npersonally. William: A lordship and titles. Gold. That I should become \nJudas? Isabella: Peace is made in such ways. William: Slaves are made in \nsuch ways. The last time Longshanks spoke of peace I was a boy. And many \nScottish nobles, who would not be slaves, were lured by him under a flag of \ntruce to a barn where he had them hanged. I was very young, but I remember \nLongshank's notion of peace. Isabella: I understand you have suffered. I \nknow about your woman. William: She was my wife. We married in secret \nbecause I would not share her with an English Lord. They killed her to get \nto me. I have never spoken of it. I don't know why I tell you now except I \nsee her strength in you. One day you'll be a queen, and you must open your \neyes. You tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled, and nor \nwill any Scot while I live. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: Ah, my son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen. So he \naccepted our bribe? Isabella: No, he did not. Longshanks: Then why does he \nstay? My scouts tell me that he has not advanced. Isabella: He waits for \nyou at York. He says he will attack no more towns or cities, if you are man \nenough to come and face him. Longshanks: Did he? The Welsh bowmen will not \nbe detected arriving so far around his flank. The main force of our armies \nfrom France will land here to the north of Edinburgh. Conscripts from \nIreland will approach from the southwest to here. Prince: Welsh bowmen, \ntroops from France, Irish conscripts. Even if you dispatch them today they \nwill take weeks to assemble. Longshanks: I dispatched them before I sent \nyour wife. So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you. And while this upstart \nawaits my arrival in York, my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind \nhim. You spoke with this Wallace in private? Tell me, what kind of man is \nhe? Isabella: A mindless barbarian, not a king like you, my lord. \nLongshanks: You may return to your embroidery. Isabella: Humbly, my lord. \nPrince: You brought back the money, of coarse. Isabella: No, I gave it to \nease the suffering of the children of this war. Longshanks: haha! That's \nwhat happens when you send a woman. Isabella: Forgive me, sire. I thought \nthat generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. \nLongshanks: My greatness will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns \nto Scotland and finds his country in ashes. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nHamish: William, there's riders approaching. Personal escort of the \nprincess. You must have made an impression. William: Ay. Hamish: I didn't \nthink you were in the tent that long. William: (in French) Miss. Nicolette: \n(in French) A message from my mistress. William: (in French) Thank you. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nStephen: It's true. The English ships are moving up from the south. I don't \nknow about the Welsh yet, but the Irish have landed. I had to see it with \nme own eyes before I could believe it. Hamish: What the hell are the Irish \ndoing fighting with the English? Stephen: I wouldn't worry about them. \nDidn't I tell you before, it's my island. William: Hamish, ride ahead to \nEdinburgh and assemble the council. Order it. Hamish: Ay. William: Your \nisland? Stephen: My island! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMornay: This time our only option is to negotiate. William: My army has \nmarched for more days than I can remember, and we still have preparations \nto make. So I'll make this plain. We require every soldier you can summon. \nYour personal escorts, even yourselves. And we need them now. Craig: With \nsuch a force of raid against us, it is time to discuss other options. \nWilliam: Other options? Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the \nfield and barter a better deal with Longshanks before you tuck tail and \nrun? Robert: Sir William. Craig: We can not defeat this army. William: We \ncan. Robert: Sir William. William: And we will. We won at Stirling, and \nstill you quibble. We won at York and you would not support us. If you will \nnot stand up with us now then I say you're a coward. (Hamish swings axe) \nWilliam: And if you are Scotsmen, I am ashamed to call myself one. Robert: \nPlease, Sir William. Speak with me alone. I beg you. Robert: Now you've \nachieved more than anyone ever dreamed, but fighting these odds it looks \nlike rage, not courage. William: It's well beyond rage. Help me. In the \nname of Christ help yourselves. Now is our chance, now. If we join, we can \nwin. If we win, well then we'll have what none of us have ever had before: \na country of our own. You are the rightful leader, and there is strength in \nyou. I see it. Unite us. Unite us. Unite the clans. Alright. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: This can not be the way. Leper: You said yourself, the nobles will \nnot support Wallace. So how does it help us to join the side that is \nslaughtered? Robert: I gave him my word. Leper: I know it is hard. Being a \nleader is. Now son, son, look at me. I can not be king. You, and you alone \ncan rule Scotland. What I tell you, you must do. Not for me, not for \nyourself, but for your country. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSoldier: Make way. Coming through. Make way lads. Hamish: The Bruce is not \ncoming, William. William: He'll come. Mornay and Lochlan have come. So will \nthe Bruce. Longshanks: Quite a lovely gathering. Wouldn't you agree? \nGeneral: The archers are ready, sire. Longshanks: Not the archers. My \nscouts tell me their archers are miles away and no threat to us. Arrows \ncost money. Use up the Irish. Their dead cost nothing. And send in the \ninfantry and cavalry. General: Infantry, cavalry, advance. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Irish advance and shake hands with the Scottish Army) Longshanks: Irish! \nWilliam: Glad to have you with us. Watch this. General: Mornay, Lochlan? \nLongshanks: I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland and matching estates \nin England. Lochlan turned for much less. Archers. General: I beg your \npardon, sire. Won't we hit our own troops? Longshanks: Yes, but we'll hit \ntheirs as well. We have reserves. Attack. General: Archers. Longshanks: \nSend in our reinforcements. General: Send in the rest. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: Bring me Wallace. Alive if possible. Dead, just as good. Send \nnews of our victory. Shall we retire. (William hit by arrow) General: \nProtect the king. Robert: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! (William sees that Robert has \nduble crossed him. He is shocked) Robert: Get up! Get up! Get him out of \nhere. Stephen: Jesus! Robert: Go! Stephen: Ah! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCampbell: I'm dying. Let me be. Hamish: No, your going to live. Campbell: \nI've lived long enough to live free; proud to see you become the man you \nare. I'm a happy man. (Hamish cries) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLeper: I'm the one who's rotting but I think your face looks graver than \nmine. Son, we must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved \nthat. You saved your family, increased your land. In time, you will have \nall the power in Scotland. Robert: Lands, titles, men, power, nothing. \nLeper: Nothing? Robert: I have nothing. Men fight for me, because if they \ndo not, I throw them off my land and I starve their wives and their \nchildren. Those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk, they fought for \nWilliam Wallace, and he fights for something that I've never had. And I \ntook it from him when I betrayed him and I saw it in his face on the \nbattlefield, and it's tearing me apart. Leper: Well, all men betray. All \nlose heart. Robert: I don't want to lose heart. I want to believe as he \ndoes. I will never be on the wrong side again. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Mornay's dreaming) Mornay: (crying) Ah! (Wallace kills him and jumps out \nwindow) Scottish noble: Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay? Craig: Ay, \nWallace rode into his bead chamber and killed him. More a liability now \nthen ever he was. And there's no telling who'll be next. Robert: Maybe you, \nmaybe me. It doesn't matter. Craig: I'm serious, Robert. Robert: So am I. \nHaha! (Lochlan drops on table) Craig: Search the place. Noble: Lochlan. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Common towns people talking) Common Scot: William Wallace killed 50 men. \n50 in one. Commoner #2: 100 men, with his own sword. Commoner #3: Cut \nthrough them like Moses through the Red Sea. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: His legend grows. It will be worse than before. Hamilton: He \nrallies new volunteers in every Scottish town. And when he replenishes his \nnumbers, - Longshanks: They're sheep, mere sheep. Easily dispersed if we \nstrike the shepherd. Very well. Take a flock of your finest assassins and \nset a meeting. Hamilton: My lord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to \nsmell an ambush. Longshanks: If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct, he \nwarmed to our future queen and would trust her. So we'll dispatch her with \nthe notion that she comes in peace. Hamilton: My Lord, the princess might \nbe taken hostage, or her life be put in jeopardy. Longshanks: My son would \nbe most distressed by that. But if she were to be killed, we would soon \nfind the King of France a useful ally against the Scots. You see, as king, \nyou must find the good in any situation. Assassin: It's William Wallace \nsure. And he's given up his sword. Be ready. (lots of screaming, hut is \nburned) William: My lady. I received your message. This is the second time \nyou've warned me of danger. Why? Isabella: There will be a new shipment of \nsupplies coming north next month. Food and weapons, they will-- William: \nWhy do you help me? Why do you help me? Isabella: Because of the way you \nare looking at me now. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nStephen: Just when we thought all hope was lost, our noble saviors have \narrived. Off with hoods. Craig: Sir William, we've come to seek a meeting. \nWilliam: Well, what's the point? You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks. \nCraig: An oath to a liar is no oath at all. Every man of us is ready to \nswear loyalty to you. William: So let the council swear it publicly. Craig: \nWe can not. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Others think you pay the \nMornay's wages. So we (?) to Edinburgh. Meet us two days from now. Give us \nyour pardon and we'll unite behind you. Scotland will be one. William: One? \nYou mean us and you. Craig: No, I mean this. It's the pledge of Robert the \nBruce. Hamish: You do know it's a trap. Tell him. Stephen: I think if the \nBruce wanted to kill you he'd have done it already at Falkirk. William: Ay. \nStephen: I know, I saw. Hamish: I ain't leaving him aside. What about the \nothers? The scheming bastards couldn't agree on the color of shit. It's a \ntrap, are you blind? William: We've got to try. We can't do this alone. \nJoining the nobles is the only hope for our people. You know what happens \nif we don't take that chance? Hamish: What? William: Nothing. Hamish: I \ndon't want to be a martyr. William: Nor I. I want to live. I want a home, \nand children, and peace. Hamish: Do ya? William: Ay, I do. I've asked God \nfor these things. It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom. Hamish: \nThat's all a dream, William. William: A dream? Just a dream? What we've \nbeen doing all this time; we've lived that dream. Hamish: You dream isn't \nabout freedom. It's about Murron. You're doing this to be a hero because \nyou think she sees you. William: I don't think she sees me. I know she \ndoes. And your father sees you, too. (Hamish hits William) Stephen: Jesus?! \nShall I come with you. William: No, I'll go alone. Stephen: I'll see you \nafter. William: Right. Stephen: Sooner rather than later, I hope. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCraig: He won't come. Robert: He will. I know he will. Guard: My Lord, he \napproaches. (Robert sees trap) Robert: NO! Craig: Stay out of it, Robert. \nRobert: Get Away! Get Away! Craig: The Bruce is not to be harmed. That was \nthe arrangement. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Father! You fooking bastard. Why? Why? Leper: Longshanks required \nWallace. So did our nobles. That was the prize of your crown. Robert: Die! \nI want you to die. Leper: Soon enough I'll be dead. And you'll be king. \nRobert: I don't want anything from you. You're not a man, and you're not my \nfather. Leper: You are my son, and you have always known my mind. Robert: \nYou deceived me. Leper: You let yourself be deceived. In your heart, you \nalways knew what had to happen here. At last, you know what it means to \nhate. Now you're ready to be king. Robert: My hate will die with you. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nExecutioner: William Wallace, you stand intained of High Treason. William: \nAgainst whom? Executioner: Against your king. Have you anything to say? \nWilliam: Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to him. Executioner: \nIt matters not. He is your king. Confess, and you may receive a quick \ndeath. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? Do you \nconfess? Then on the morrow you shall receive your purification. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nGuard: Your Highness. Isabella: I will see the prisoner. Guard: We've got \norders from the king that no one-- Isabella: The king will be dead in a \nmonth and his son is a weakling. Who do you think will rule this kingdom? \nNow open this door. Guard: Majesty: Come on, back on your feet. (Guard \nkicks William) Isabella: Stop it. Leave me. I said leave me. William: My \nlady. Isabella: Sir, I've come to beg you to confess all and swear \nallegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. William: Will he show \nmercy to my country? Isabella: Mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live \nin a tower. In time, who knows what could happen. William: If I swear to \nhim, then all that I am is dead already. Isabella: You will die. It will be \nawful. William: Every man dies, not every man really lives. Isabella: Drink \nthis. It will dull your pain. William: No. It will numb my wits, and I must \nhave them all. For if I'm senseless or if I wail, then Longshanks will have \nbroken me. Isabella: I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it. \nWilliam: Alright. (They kiss, and William spits it out) Isabella: I have \ncome to beg for the life of William Wallace. Prince: You're quite taken \nwith him, aren't you. Isabella: I respect him. At worst he was a worthy \nenemy. Show mercy, O great king, and win the respect of your own people. \nEven now you are incapable of mercy. And you. To you that word is as \nunfamiliar as love. Prince: Before he lost his powers of speech he told me \nhis one comfort was he would live to know Wallace was dead. Isabella: You \nsee, death comes to us all. But before it comes to you, know this. Your \nplot dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your \nson will not sit long on the thrown, I swear it. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(crowd cheers) William: I am so afraid. Give me the strength to die well. \nCommon man: Here he comes! (crowd throws food at him) Executioner: Now \nbehold the awful prize of treason. You will fall to your knees now. Declare \nyourself the king's loyal subject, and beg his mercy, and you shall have \nit. (no response) Executioner: Rope. Stretch him. That's it, stretch him. \nPleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and \nyou will feel no more. (no response) Executioner: Rack him. Enough? (they \nput William on the cross, and begin disembowelment) (William in serious \npain) Executioner: It can all end, right now. Peace. Bliss. Just say it. \nCry out mercy. (crowd repeats \"mercy\") Executioner: Cry out. Just say it. \nMercy. Hamish: Mercy lad, mercy. Stephen: Jesus, mercy. Executioner: The \nprisoner wishes to say a word. William: FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM! (William is \nbeheaded) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert (narrator): After the beheading, William Wallace's body was torn to \npieces. His head was placed on top on London Bridge, his arms and legs sent \nto the four corners of Britain as a warning. It did not have the effect \nthat Longshanks planned. And I, Robert the Bruce, rode out to pay homage to \nthe armies of the English king and accept his endorsement of my crown. \nEnglish noble: I hope you've washed your ass this morning. It's about to be \nkissed by a king. Craig: Come. Lets get it over with. Robert: Stop. You \nhave bled with Wallace, now bleed with me. Craig: Ah! Hamish: Yea! (Throws \nsword; sword lands) Crowd: WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE. \nAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! (Scots charge) William (narrating): In the year of our \nLord 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the \nfields at Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like \nScotsmen. And won their freedom.\ufeff",

            "text": "BRAVEHEART Robert the Bruce (narrator): I shall tell you of William \nWallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is \nwritten by those who have hanged heroes. The king of Scotland had died \nwithout a son, and the King of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the \nLongshanks, claimed the thrown of Scotland for himself. Scotland's nobles \nfought him, and fought each other over the crown. So Longshanks invited \nthem to talks of truce, no weapons, one page only. Among the farmers of \nthat shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands. He had two \nsons: John and William. Malcolm: I told you to stay. William: Well, I \nfinished my work. Where are we going? Malcolm: MacAndrews. He was supposed \nto fess up when the gathering was over. William: Can I come? Malcolm: No. \nGo home, boy. William: But I want to go. Malcolm: Go home William or you'll \nthe back of my hand. John: Follow him, William. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMalcolm: MacAndrews; MacAndrews. Great Jesus! William: Ah! (screams) \nMalcolm: It's all right! William! John: William! Malcolm: It's all right. \nEasy lad. Dead Page Boy: William! (in Wallace's house) Campbell: We fight \nthem! MacClannough: Every nobleman who had the will to fight was at that \nmeeting. We can not beat an army. Malcolm: We do not have to defeat them. \nJust fight them. Now who's with me. Campbell (among others): I am, Wallace. \nMacClannough: Alright, alright. Malcolm: Ay. Malcolm: Where do you think \nyou're going? William: I'm going with you. Malcolm: Oh, you're going with, \nhey? And what are you going to do? William: I'm gonna help. Malcolm: Hey, \nand a good help you'd be, too. But I need you to stay here and look after \nthe place for me while I'm away. William: I can fight! Malcolm: I know. I \nknow you can fight. But it's out wits that make us men. See you tomorrow. \nJohn: Ha! Hamish: English! William: Get down! Hamish: With your father and \nbrother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm. William: It's up to us, \nHamish. Both boys: Ahhhh! (Throw rocks) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Da? Da? Campbell: William, come here lad. (Funeral) Priest: \n(speaks Latin) Argyle: William, I am your uncle, Argyle. You have the look \nof your mother. Argyle: We'll stay here tonight. Tomorrow you'll come home \nwith me. William: I don't want to leave. Argyle: You didn't want your \nfather to die either, did ya? But it happened. Did the priest give a poetic \nbenediction? \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee\"? William: It was in Latin. \nArgyle: You don't speak Latin? Well that's something we shall have to \nremedy, isn't it. Argyle: The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord cause \nhis light to shine on thee. The Lord lift up his continence upon thee. And \ngive thee peace. Amen. Dead Malcolm: Your heart is free. Have the courage \nto follow her. (Campbell plays bagpipes) William: What are they doing? \nArgyle: Saying goodbye in their own way. Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed \npipes. It was the same for me and your daddy, when our father was killed. \n(William looks at sword) Argyle: First, learn to use this (mind), then I'll \nteach you to use this (sword). \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert the Bruce (narrator): Many years later, Edward the Longshanks, King \nof England, supervised the wedding of his eldest son, who would succeed him \nto the thrown. As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen the daughter of \nhis rival, the King of France. It was widely whispered that for the \nprincess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That \nmay have been what he had in mind all along. Longshanks: Scotland, my land. \nThe French will grovel to anyone with strength, but how will they believe \nour strength when we can not rule the whole of our own island? Longshanks: \nWhere is my son? Isabella: Your pardon, my Lord. He asked me to come in his \nstead. Longshanks: I sent for him and he sends you? Isabella: Shall I \nleave, my Lord? Longshanks: If he wants his Queen to rule when I am gone, \nthen by all means stay, and learn how. Please. Longshanks: Nobles. Nobles \nare the key to the door of Scotland. Grant our nobles lands in the north. \nGive their nobles estates here in England, and make them too greedy to \noppose us. Advisor: But sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot. New \nlands mean new taxes, and they are already taxed for the war in France. \nLongshanks: Are they? Are they? The trouble with Scotland is that it's full \nof Scots. Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom. Grant \nthem prima noctes. First night, when any common girl inhabiting their lands \nis married, our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her \nwedding. If we can't get them out, we breed them out. That should fetch \njust the kind of lords we want to Scotland, taxes or no taxes. Advisor: A \nmost excellent idea, sire. Longshanks: Is it? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert the Bruce (narrator): Now in Edinburgh, gathered the council of \nScottish nobles. Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, the \nleading contender for the crown of Scotland. Robert the Bruce: I hear that \nLongshanks has granted prima noctes. Craig: Clearly meant to draw more of \nhis supporters here. Robert the Bruce: My father believes that we must lull \nLongshanks into confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing \nit. Craig: A wise plan. And how is your father? We missed him at the \ncouncil. Robert the Bruce: Ah. His affairs in France keep him long overdue, \nbut he sends his greetings. And he says that I speak for all the Bruces, \nand for Scotland. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: (rides home and smells air) (wedding celebration; music playing) \nWilliam: You dropped your rock. Hamish: Test of manhood. William: You win. \nHamish: Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train \nwith weapons, so we train with stones. William: Well, a test of a soldier \nis not in his arm, it's here (mind). Hamish: No, it's here (arm) (Hamish \nhits William) William: Hamish? Hamish: Uh huh. (drumming, rock throwing \ncontest) Campbell: Here you go, son. Show him how. Come on! Haha, my boy! \nWilliam: That's a good throw. Hamish: Ay. Ay, it was. William: I was \nwondering if you could do that when it matters. As it, as is matters in \nbattle. Can you crush a man with that throw? Hamish: I could crush you, \nlike a worm. William: You could? Hamish: Ay. William: Well then do it. \nWould you like to see him crush me like a worm? Crowd: Ay! William: Then do \nit. Hamish: You'll move. William: I will not. Campbell: He'll move. (Hamish \nmisses, William hits Hamish) Campbell: Fine display, young Wallace. \nWilliam: You alright? You look a widdy bit shaky. Hamish: I should have \nremembered the rocks. William: Ay, you should have. Get up you big heap. \nIt's good to see you again. Hamish: Ay, welcome home. Girl: William, will \nyou dance with me? William: Of coarse I will. (Horses ride in) English \nlord: I have come to claim the right of prima noctes. As lord of these \nlands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the \nfirst night of her union. Scottish man: By God, you will not! Lord: It is \nmy noble right. (They ride off with bride). Smythe: Ha ha. Ha ha. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(raining, outside of Murron's house) William: Good evening, sir. \nMacClannough: Ah, young Wallace. Grand soft evening, huh? William: Ay, is \nthat. I was wondering if I might have a word with your daughter. \nMacClannough: What do you want to have a word with her about? William: \nWell, ah, Murron, would you like to come and ride with me on this fine \nevening? Mrs. MacClannough: In this? You're out of your mind. William: Oh, \nit's good Scottish weather, madam. The rain is fallin' straight down, well \nslightly to the side like. Mrs. MacClannough: She can not go with you. \nWilliam: No? Mrs. MacClannough: No the no, anyway. William: No the no. \nMacClannough: No the no. We'll see you later. Murron: 'O the weather's just \nfine. It's hardly raining. Mrs. MacClannough: Did you no hear what I said? \nNow get-Murron. It's you she takes after. William: How did you know me \nafter so long? Murron: Why, I didn't. William: No? Murron: It's just that I \nsaw you staring at me and I didn't know who you were. William: 'O sorry, I \nsuppose I was. Are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with \nstrangers? Murron: It was the best way to make you leave. William: Well, if \nI can ever work up the courage to ask you again, I'll send you a written \nwarning first. Murron: 'O it wouldn't do you much good. I can't read. \nWilliam: Can you not? Murron: no. William: Well that's something we shall \nhave to remedy, isn't it. Murron: You're going to teach me to read, then? \nWilliam: Ah, if you like. Murron: Ay. William: In what language? Murron: \nAre you showing off now? William: That's right. Are you impressed yet? \nMurron: No. Why should I be? William: (in French) Yes. Because every single \nday I thought about you. Murron: Do that standing on your head and I'll be \nimpressed. William: My kilt may fly up but I'll try. Murron: You certainly \ndidn't learn any manners on your travels. William: I'm afraid the Romans \nhave far worse manners than I. Murron: You've been to Rome? William: Ay, my \nuncle took me on a pilgrimage. Murron: What was it like? William: (in \nFrench) Not nearly as beautiful as you. Murron: What does that mean? \nWilliam: Beautiful. But I belong here. Mrs. MacClannough: Murron, come in \nnow. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Sir, I know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last \nnight, but I assure you I- Campbell: MacClannough's daughter is another \nmatter. I've come to fetch you to a meeting. William: What kind of meeting? \nCampbell: The secret kind. MacClannough: Your meetings are a waste of time, \nCampbell. Campbell: Your father was a fighter, and a patriot. William: I \nknow who my father was. I came back home to raise crops, and God willing a \nfamily. If I can live in peace, I will. MacClannough: You say you want to \nstay out of the troubles? William: Ay. MacClannough: If you can prove it, \nyou may court my daughter. Until you prove it, my answer is no. William: \nNo? MacClannough: No Wallace, no. William: Didn't I just prove it? \nMacClannough: No. William: No? MacClannough: No. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Of coarse, running a farm is a lot of work, but that will all \nchange when my sons arrive. Murron: So, you've got children? William: Well \nnot yet, but I was hoping that you could help me with that. Murron: So you \nwant me to marry you, then? William: Well, that's a bit sudden but alright. \nMurron: Is that what you call a proposal? William: I love you. Always have. \nI want to marry you. Is that a yes? Murron: Ay, that's a yes. William: We \nbest hurry. He'll be waiting. Murron: Wait. William: Where are you going? \nWilliam: What's that? Murron: You'll see. William: Father. William: I will \nlove you my whole life; you and no other. Murron: And I you; you and no \nother forever. Priest: (speaks Latin) William: When am I gonna see you \nagain? Tonight? Murron: I can't. William: Why not? Murron: My dad's gotten \nsuspicious. William: Not as suspicious as you (?). When? Murron: Tonight. \nWilliam: Tonight? Murron: Ay. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSmythe: Look lively, sergeant. Smythe: Where are you going lassie? Oo, that \nlooks heavy. Let me help you. Murron: That's fine. Smythe: 'O, you remind \nme of my daughter back home. Smythe: Hello lassie. Soldier: Keep going, \nSmythe. (lots of screaming) Smythe: Ah, you bitch. William: Are you \nalright? Murron: Ay. William: Can you ride? Murron: Ay. Smythe: Come back \nhere, you bastard. William: Meet me at the grove. Ride. Smythe: They're \ngetting away. William: Murron? Murron? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMagistrate: All of you know full well the great pains I've always taken \nnever to be to strict, to rigid, with the application of our laws. And as a \nconsequence, have we not learned to live together in relative peace and \nharmony? Ha? And this day's lawlessness is how you repay my leniency. Well \nyou leave me with little choice. An assault on the king's soldiers is the \nsame as an assault on the king himself. (He kills Murron) Magistrate: Now, \nlet this scrapper come to me. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSoldier: There. (points at William) (fighting starts) Magistrate: Corporal, \nsummon archers on the tower, now. Hamish: Hold still, father. Campbell: \nAhh, boy! (William kills Magistrate) Campbell: MacClannough, MacClannough! \nCrowd of Scotsmen: MacClannough, MacClannough, WALLACE, WALLACE! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Murron's Funeral) Priest: (speaks Latin) Mrs. MacClannough: (crying) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCampbell: What cha waiting for, boy? Hamish: Here. You can do it. I'll hold \nhim down. Morrison: Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down. Campbell: Ay, \nstraight in, boy. I know it seems like a waste of good whiskey, but indulge \nme. AHHH. Hamish: Hold him! Hold him! Scottish man: Let him go. Sorry. \nCampbell: That will wake you up in the morning, boy. Watch guard: There's \nsomebody coming. Arm yourselves. Hamish: There's somebody coming. Campbell: \nMacGregors, from the next clan. MacGregor: We heard about what was \nhappening, and we don't want you armidants thinking you can have your fun \nwithout us. William: Go home. Some of us are in this. We can't help that \nnow. But you can help yourselves. Go home. MacGregor: We'll have no homes \nleft when the English garrison from the castle comes through and burns us \nout. And they will. William and Campbell: Welcome! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(William's army enters, dressed as English patrol) English soldier: Patrol \nreturning, my Lord. English Lord: So, what news? (William hits Lord) \nEnglish Lord: I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark. They will be \nreturning now. William: Were they dressed like this? Actually, it was more \nlike 50. Make it quick. Morrison: Do you remember me? Lord: I never did her \nany harm. It was my right. Morrison: Your right? Well I'm here to claim the \nright as a husband. William: I am William Wallace, and the rest of you will \nbe spared. Go back to England, and tell them there that Scotland's \ndaughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. Burn \nit. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(in English castle) Longshanks: Scottish rebels have routed one of my \ngarrisons and murdered the noble lord. Prince: I heard. This Wallace is a \nbrigand, nothing more. Longshanks: And how would you deal with this \nbrigand? Prince: Like any common thief. Have the local magistrate arrest \nhim and punish him accordingly. Longshanks: Leave us. Wallace has already \nkilled the magistrate and taken control of the town. Stand up. Stand up. In \nthe morning, I depart for France to press our rights there, and I leave you \nhere to quell this little rebellion, understood? Is it? One day you will be \na king. At least try to act like one. Prince: Get away from me. I will need \nmy military council. Nicolette: (in French) I hope your husband goes to \nScotland and meets Wallace and then you'll be a widow. English soldier: \nAfter them. English leader: No point resisting. You're outnumbered and \ntrapped. Now where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Father? Leper: Ah, come in, come in. Robert: A rebellion has begun. \nLeper: Under whom? Robert: A commoner named William Wallace. Leper: We will \nembrace this rebellion. Support it from our lands in the north. I will gain \nEnglish favor by condemning it, and ordering it opposed from our lands in \nthe south. Sit down. Stay a while. Robert: This Wallace, he doesn't even \nhave a knighthood, but he fights with passion and he inspires. Leper: And \nyou wish to charge off and fight as he did. So would I. Robert: Well, maybe \nit's time. Leper: It is time to survive. You're the 17th Robert Bruce. The \n16 before you passed you land and title because they didn't charge in. Call \na meeting of the nobles. Robert: But they do nothing but talk. Leper: \nRightly so. They're as rich in English titles and lands as they are in \nScottish, just as we are. Admire this man, this William Wallace. \nUncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage, so does a dog. But \nit is exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble. And \nunderstand this: Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit in \nthe thrown of England. And none of us, and nothing of Scotland will remain, \nunless we are as ruthless. Give in to our nobles. Knowing their minds is \nthe key to the thrown. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nPrince: Wait. Wait. Look. This is right and this is left. Carry on. Carry \non. Nicolette: (in French) When the king returns, he will bury them in \nthose new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending \nan army north. Isabella: (in French) How do you know this? Nicolette: (in \nFrench) Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. Isabella: (in \nFrench) He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed. Nicolette: (in French) \nEnglishmen don't know what a tongue is for. Isabella: (in French) Ah. This \nScottish rebel, Wallace. He fights to avenge a woman? Nicolette: (in \nFrench) I nearly forgot. A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he \nhad a secret lover. So he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight, \nand fight he did. Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted \nto take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother, and \nsetting an ambush at the grave of his love. He fought his way through the \ntrap and carried her body to a secret place. Now that's love, no? Isabella: \nLove? I wouldn't know. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: You know, eventually Longshanks will send his whole Northern Army \nagainst us. Campbell: Heavy cavalry, armored horse; shake the very ground. \nHamish: They'll ride right over us. William: Uncle Argyle used to talk \nabout it; how no army had ever stood up to a charge of heavy horse. Hamish: \nSo what'll we do? Campbell: Run, hide, the highland way. William: We'll \nmake spears. Hundreds of them. Long spears, twice as long as a man. Hamish: \nThat long? William: Ay. Hamish: Some men are longer than others. Campbell: \nYour mother's been telling stories about me again, ah? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nGuard: Volunteers coming in. Faudron: William Wallace, we've come to fight \nand to die for ya. William: Stand up, man. I'm not the pope. Faudron: My \nname is Faudron, and my sword is yours. I brought you this. Guard: We \nchecked them for arms. Faudron: I brought you this. My wife made it for ya. \nWilliam: Thank you. Stephen: (laughs) Him? That can't be William Wallace. \nI'm prettier than this man. Alright Father, I'll ask him. If I risk my neck \nfor you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? Hamish: Is your father a \nghost or do you converse with the Almighty? Stephen: In order to find his \nequal, an Irishman is forced to talk to God. Yes, Father. The Almighty says \ndon't change the subject; just answer the fooking question. Hamish: Mind \nyour tongue. Campbell: Insane Irish. Stephen: (pulls dagger on Campbell) \nSmart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man. William: That's my \nfriend, Irishman. And the answer to your question is yes; if you fight for \nme you get to kill the English. Stephen: Excellent. Stephen is my name. I'm \nthe most wanted man on my island, except I'm not on my island, of coarse. \nMores the pity. Hamish: Your island? You mean Ireland. Stephen: Yeah. It's \nmine. Hamish: You're a madman. Stephen: I've come to the right place, then. \n(everyone laughs) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Faurdon trys to kill Wallace, but Stephen saves him) Stephen: Sure didn't \nthe Almighty send me to watch your back? I didn't like him anyway. He \nwasn't right in the head. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nHamish: William, it's our runners. Morrison: The English are devising an \narmy towards Scotland. William: Will the nobles rally? Runner: Robert the \nBruce and most of the others will not commit to battle. But word is spread, \nand highlanders are coming down on their own. Morrison: Ay, in flocks of \nhundreds and thousands. William: Are you ready for a war? Mornay: Well, \nwhat news? Horseman: We're outnumbered, at least 3 to 1. Mornay: How many \nhorse, then? Horseman: 300, maybe more. Mornay: 300 heavy horse? Lochlan: \nWe must try to negotiate. Short soldier: What are they talking about? Tall \nsoldier: I can't hear, but it doesn't look good. The nobles will negotiate. \nIf they do a deal, then we go home. And if not, we charge. Mornay: 300 \nheavy horse; we have no chance. Short soldier: I didn't come here to fight \nso they can own more lands; then I have to work for them. Tall soldier: Nor \nme. Alright lads. I have no time for these bastards; lets go home. Lochlan: \nStop men. Do not leave. Wait until we've negotiated. Short soldier: William \nWallace? Tall soldier: Can't be. Not tall enough. Stephen: The Almighty \nsays this must be a fashionable fight. It's drawn the finest people. \nLochlan: Where is thy salute? William: For presenting yourselves on this \nbattlefield, I give you thanks. Lochlan: This is our army. To join it you \ngive homage. William: I give homage to Scotland. And if this is your army, \nwhy does it go? Tall soldier: We didn't come here to fight for them. Short \nsoldier: Home. The English are too many. William: Sons of Scotland, I am \nWilliam Wallace. Short soldier: William Wallace is 7 feet tall. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: Yes, I've heard. Kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here \nhe'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of \nlightning from his ass. I am William Wallace, and I see before me an army \nof my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as \nfree men, and free men you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you \nfight? Tall soldier: Fight against that? No, we will run, and we will live. \nWilliam: Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while. \nAnd dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade \nall the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come \nback here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll \nnever take our freedom. (cheering) English lord: They seem quite optimistic \nto me. Maybe they do want to fight. Cheltham: Confrontation might be a \nforegone conclusion, my lord. But none the less, I think we should deliver \nthe king's terms. Lord: The king's terms will never live up to them. \nCheltham: My lord, I think-. Lord: Alright, offer them the terms. Craig: \nThey're coming out. Shall we go and meet them? Stephen: Fine speech. Now \nwhat do we do? William: Just be yourselves. Hamish: Where are you going? \nWilliam: I'm going to pick a fight. Hamish: Well, we didn't get dressed up \nfor nothing. Cheltham: Mornay, Lochlan, Craig. Here are the king's terms. \nLead this army off field and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, \nincluding hereditary title, from which you will pay-, from which you will \npay him an annual duty-. William: I have an offer for you. Mornay: \nCheltham, this is William Wallace. Cheltham: From which you will pay the \nking an annual duty-. William: I said I have an offer for you. Lochlan: You \ndisrespect a banner of truce? William: From his king? Absolutely. Here are \nScotland's terms. Lower your flags, and march straight back to England, \nstopping at every home to beg forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape, and \nmurder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you \nwill die today. Cheltham: You are outmatched. You have no heavy cavalry. In \ntwo centuries no army has won without-. William: I'm not finished. Before \nwe let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself \nbefore this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass. \nMornay: I'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to. William: \nYou be ready and do exactly as I say. On my signal, ride round behind our \nposition and flank them. Mornay: We must not divide our forces. William: Do \nit, and let the English see you do it. Mornay: They'll think we've run \naway. William: Take out their archers, and I'll meet you in the middle. \nMornay: Alright. Priest: (speaks Latin) English Lord: Insolent bastard. I \nwant this Wallace's head on a plate. Archers. (Scots scream) Stephen: The \nLord says He can get me out of this mess, but He's pretty sure you're \nfooked. Ah! (Scots scream) William: Ride! Lord: See, every Scot with a \nhorse is fleeing. Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Send the \nhorse; full attack. William: Hold! Hold! Hold! Now! (lots of screaming) \nLord: Send the infantry. Cheltham: My Lord? Lord: You lead them. (lots of \nfighting) Lord: Retreat! William: Alright. William: (screaming) Scottish \narmy: (screaming) WALLACE! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCraig: I knight thee Sir William Wallace. Sir William, in the name of God \nwe declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland and thy \nCaptains as aides-de-camp. Stand and be recognized. Robert: Does anyone \nknow his politics? Craig: No, but his weight with the commoners can \nunbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass so we must. Balliol \nsupporter: Sir William, Sir William. Inasmuch as you and your captains hail \nfrom a region long known to support the Balliol clan, may we invite you to \ncontinue your support and uphold our rightful claim. (screaming) William: \nGentlemen!, Gentlemen! Balliol supporter: Now is the time to declare a \nking. Mornay: Wait! Then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate \nsuccession. Balliol supporter: You're the ones who won't support the \nrightful claim. Mornay: Those were lies when you first wrote them. Balliol \nsupporter: I demand recognition of these documents. Craig: Gentlemen! \nPlease, Gentlemen! Wait! Sir William, where are you going? William: We have \nbeaten the English, but they'll come back because you won't stand together. \nCraig: Well what will you do? William: I will invade England and defeat the \nEnglish on their own ground. Craig: Invade? That's impossible. William: \nWhy? Why is that impossible? You're so concerned with squabbling for the \nscraps from Longshank's table that you've missed your God given right to \nsomething better. There is a difference between us. You think the people of \nthis country exist to provide you with possession. I think your possession \nexists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make sure that \nthey have it. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Wait! I respect what you said, but remember that these men have \nlands and castles. It's much to risk. William: And the common man who \nbleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? Robert: No, but from top to \nbottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance \nwith England. Its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both \nsides of the border, you'll end up dead. William: We all end up dead; it's \njust a question of how and why. Robert: I'm not a coward. I want what you \nwant, but we need the nobles. William: We need them? Robert: Ay. William: \nNow tell me, what does that mean to be noble? Your title gives you claim to \nthe thrown of our country, but men don't follow titles, they follow \ncourage. Now our people know you. Noble, and common, they respect you. And \nif you would just lead them to freedom, they'd follow you. And so would I. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRoyal Governor of York: Damn it! The sodomite my cousin the prince tells me \nhe has no troops to lend and every town in Northern England is begging for \nhelp. Soldier: Wallace rides! Governor: To which town? Soldier: To here my \nLord. Governor: Bring the food and provisions inside, double the wall \nguards, seal the gate, now! Soldier: Quickly, bring in the provisions, seal \noff the gate, NOW! Soldier: Sir, we can get you out if you leave now. \nGovernor: I am not about to tell my Uncle I've lost him the greatest city \nin Northern England. William: Come on! Scottish soldiers: AAAHHH! (lots of \ncheering, gate on fire) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(back in London) Soldier: Make way for the King. Philip: It's not your \nfault. Stand up to him. Prince: I will stand up to him and more. \nLongshanks: What news of the North? Prince: Nothing new, Your Majesty. \nWe've sent riders to speed any word. Longshanks: I heard the word in \nFrance, where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom. The word, my \nson, is that our entire Northern Army has been annihilated. And you have \ndone nothing. Prince: I have ordered conscriptions. They are assembled and \nready to depart. Soldier: Excuse me, sire, but there is a very urgent \nmessage from York. Longshanks: Come. Leave us. Soldier: Yes, sire. Prince: \nWallace has sacked York. Longshanks: What? Prince: Wallace has sacked York. \nAh! Philip: Sire, thy own nephew. What beast could do such a thing? \nLongshanks: If he can sack York, he can invade lower England. Philip: We \nwould stop him! Longshanks: Who is this person who speaks to me as though I \nneeded his advise? Prince: I have declared Philip my High Counselor. \nLongshanks: Is he qualified? Philip: I am skilled in the arts of war and \nmilitary tactics, sire. Longshanks: Are you? Then tell me, what advice \nwould you offer on the present situation? (Longshanks kick's Philip out the \nwindow) Philip: AAAHHH! (Longshanks kicks Prince) Longshanks: I shall offer \na truce and pie him off. But who will go to him? Not I, huh, if I fell \nunder the sword of that murderer that might be my head in a basket. And not \nmy gentle son. The mere sight of him would only encourage the enemy to take \nover the whole country. So who do I send? Whom do I send? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWilliam: I'm dreaming. Murron: Yes you are, and you must wake. William: I \ndon't want to wake. I want to stay here with you. Murron: And I with you. \nBut you must wake now. Wake up, William. Wake up. William, wake up. \nCampbell: William, a royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, with \nthe standard of Longshanks himself. Isabella: I am the Princess of Wales. I \ncome as the king's servant and with his authority. William: To do what? \nIsabella: To discuss the king's proposals. Will you speak with a woman? \nIsabella: I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight. \nWilliam: I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. Isabella: \nDid God make you the sacker of peaceful cities, the executioner of the \nking's nephew, my husband's own cousin? William: York was the staging point \nfor every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged innocent \nScots, even women and children, from the city walls. Oh, Longshanks did far \nworse the last time he took a Scottish city. Hamilton: (in Latin) He is a \nbloody murdering savage. And he's telling lies. William: (in Latin) I never \nlie. But I am a savage. (in French) Or in French if you prefer. (in \nEnglish) You ask your king to his face, ask him, and see if his eyes can \nconvince you of the truth. Isabella: Hamilton, leave us. Hamilton: My lady? \nIsabella: Leave us. Now. Let us talk plainly. You invade England, but you \ncan not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply. The king \ndesires peace. William: Longshanks desires peace? Isabella: He declares it \nto me, I swear it. He proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he \ngrants you title, estates, and this chest of gold which I am to pay to you \npersonally. William: A lordship and titles. Gold. That I should become \nJudas? Isabella: Peace is made in such ways. William: Slaves are made in \nsuch ways. The last time Longshanks spoke of peace I was a boy. And many \nScottish nobles, who would not be slaves, were lured by him under a flag of \ntruce to a barn where he had them hanged. I was very young, but I remember \nLongshank's notion of peace. Isabella: I understand you have suffered. I \nknow about your woman. William: She was my wife. We married in secret \nbecause I would not share her with an English Lord. They killed her to get \nto me. I have never spoken of it. I don't know why I tell you now except I \nsee her strength in you. One day you'll be a queen, and you must open your \neyes. You tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled, and nor \nwill any Scot while I live. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: Ah, my son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen. So he \naccepted our bribe? Isabella: No, he did not. Longshanks: Then why does he \nstay? My scouts tell me that he has not advanced. Isabella: He waits for \nyou at York. He says he will attack no more towns or cities, if you are man \nenough to come and face him. Longshanks: Did he? The Welsh bowmen will not \nbe detected arriving so far around his flank. The main force of our armies \nfrom France will land here to the north of Edinburgh. Conscripts from \nIreland will approach from the southwest to here. Prince: Welsh bowmen, \ntroops from France, Irish conscripts. Even if you dispatch them today they \nwill take weeks to assemble. Longshanks: I dispatched them before I sent \nyour wife. So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you. And while this upstart \nawaits my arrival in York, my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind \nhim. You spoke with this Wallace in private? Tell me, what kind of man is \nhe? Isabella: A mindless barbarian, not a king like you, my lord. \nLongshanks: You may return to your embroidery. Isabella: Humbly, my lord. \nPrince: You brought back the money, of coarse. Isabella: No, I gave it to \nease the suffering of the children of this war. Longshanks: haha! That's \nwhat happens when you send a woman. Isabella: Forgive me, sire. I thought \nthat generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. \nLongshanks: My greatness will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns \nto Scotland and finds his country in ashes. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nHamish: William, there's riders approaching. Personal escort of the \nprincess. You must have made an impression. William: Ay. Hamish: I didn't \nthink you were in the tent that long. William: (in French) Miss. Nicolette: \n(in French) A message from my mistress. William: (in French) Thank you. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nStephen: It's true. The English ships are moving up from the south. I don't \nknow about the Welsh yet, but the Irish have landed. I had to see it with \nme own eyes before I could believe it. Hamish: What the hell are the Irish \ndoing fighting with the English? Stephen: I wouldn't worry about them. \nDidn't I tell you before, it's my island. William: Hamish, ride ahead to \nEdinburgh and assemble the council. Order it. Hamish: Ay. William: Your \nisland? Stephen: My island! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMornay: This time our only option is to negotiate. William: My army has \nmarched for more days than I can remember, and we still have preparations \nto make. So I'll make this plain. We require every soldier you can summon. \nYour personal escorts, even yourselves. And we need them now. Craig: With \nsuch a force of raid against us, it is time to discuss other options. \nWilliam: Other options? Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the \nfield and barter a better deal with Longshanks before you tuck tail and \nrun? Robert: Sir William. Craig: We can not defeat this army. William: We \ncan. Robert: Sir William. William: And we will. We won at Stirling, and \nstill you quibble. We won at York and you would not support us. If you will \nnot stand up with us now then I say you're a coward. (Hamish swings axe) \nWilliam: And if you are Scotsmen, I am ashamed to call myself one. Robert: \nPlease, Sir William. Speak with me alone. I beg you. Robert: Now you've \nachieved more than anyone ever dreamed, but fighting these odds it looks \nlike rage, not courage. William: It's well beyond rage. Help me. In the \nname of Christ help yourselves. Now is our chance, now. If we join, we can \nwin. If we win, well then we'll have what none of us have ever had before: \na country of our own. You are the rightful leader, and there is strength in \nyou. I see it. Unite us. Unite us. Unite the clans. Alright. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: This can not be the way. Leper: You said yourself, the nobles will \nnot support Wallace. So how does it help us to join the side that is \nslaughtered? Robert: I gave him my word. Leper: I know it is hard. Being a \nleader is. Now son, son, look at me. I can not be king. You, and you alone \ncan rule Scotland. What I tell you, you must do. Not for me, not for \nyourself, but for your country. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSoldier: Make way. Coming through. Make way lads. Hamish: The Bruce is not \ncoming, William. William: He'll come. Mornay and Lochlan have come. So will \nthe Bruce. Longshanks: Quite a lovely gathering. Wouldn't you agree? \nGeneral: The archers are ready, sire. Longshanks: Not the archers. My \nscouts tell me their archers are miles away and no threat to us. Arrows \ncost money. Use up the Irish. Their dead cost nothing. And send in the \ninfantry and cavalry. General: Infantry, cavalry, advance. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Irish advance and shake hands with the Scottish Army) Longshanks: Irish! \nWilliam: Glad to have you with us. Watch this. General: Mornay, Lochlan? \nLongshanks: I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland and matching estates \nin England. Lochlan turned for much less. Archers. General: I beg your \npardon, sire. Won't we hit our own troops? Longshanks: Yes, but we'll hit \ntheirs as well. We have reserves. Attack. General: Archers. Longshanks: \nSend in our reinforcements. General: Send in the rest. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: Bring me Wallace. Alive if possible. Dead, just as good. Send \nnews of our victory. Shall we retire. (William hit by arrow) General: \nProtect the king. Robert: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! (William sees that Robert has \nduble crossed him. He is shocked) Robert: Get up! Get up! Get him out of \nhere. Stephen: Jesus! Robert: Go! Stephen: Ah! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCampbell: I'm dying. Let me be. Hamish: No, your going to live. Campbell: \nI've lived long enough to live free; proud to see you become the man you \nare. I'm a happy man. (Hamish cries) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLeper: I'm the one who's rotting but I think your face looks graver than \nmine. Son, we must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved \nthat. You saved your family, increased your land. In time, you will have \nall the power in Scotland. Robert: Lands, titles, men, power, nothing. \nLeper: Nothing? Robert: I have nothing. Men fight for me, because if they \ndo not, I throw them off my land and I starve their wives and their \nchildren. Those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk, they fought for \nWilliam Wallace, and he fights for something that I've never had. And I \ntook it from him when I betrayed him and I saw it in his face on the \nbattlefield, and it's tearing me apart. Leper: Well, all men betray. All \nlose heart. Robert: I don't want to lose heart. I want to believe as he \ndoes. I will never be on the wrong side again. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Mornay's dreaming) Mornay: (crying) Ah! (Wallace kills him and jumps out \nwindow) Scottish noble: Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay? Craig: Ay, \nWallace rode into his bead chamber and killed him. More a liability now \nthen ever he was. And there's no telling who'll be next. Robert: Maybe you, \nmaybe me. It doesn't matter. Craig: I'm serious, Robert. Robert: So am I. \nHaha! (Lochlan drops on table) Craig: Search the place. Noble: Lochlan. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(Common towns people talking) Common Scot: William Wallace killed 50 men. \n50 in one. Commoner #2: 100 men, with his own sword. Commoner #3: Cut \nthrough them like Moses through the Red Sea. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nLongshanks: His legend grows. It will be worse than before. Hamilton: He \nrallies new volunteers in every Scottish town. And when he replenishes his \nnumbers, - Longshanks: They're sheep, mere sheep. Easily dispersed if we \nstrike the shepherd. Very well. Take a flock of your finest assassins and \nset a meeting. Hamilton: My lord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to \nsmell an ambush. Longshanks: If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct, he \nwarmed to our future queen and would trust her. So we'll dispatch her with \nthe notion that she comes in peace. Hamilton: My Lord, the princess might \nbe taken hostage, or her life be put in jeopardy. Longshanks: My son would \nbe most distressed by that. But if she were to be killed, we would soon \nfind the King of France a useful ally against the Scots. You see, as king, \nyou must find the good in any situation. Assassin: It's William Wallace \nsure. And he's given up his sword. Be ready. (lots of screaming, hut is \nburned) William: My lady. I received your message. This is the second time \nyou've warned me of danger. Why? Isabella: There will be a new shipment of \nsupplies coming north next month. Food and weapons, they will-- William: \nWhy do you help me? Why do you help me? Isabella: Because of the way you \nare looking at me now. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nStephen: Just when we thought all hope was lost, our noble saviors have \narrived. Off with hoods. Craig: Sir William, we've come to seek a meeting. \nWilliam: Well, what's the point? You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks. \nCraig: An oath to a liar is no oath at all. Every man of us is ready to \nswear loyalty to you. William: So let the council swear it publicly. Craig: \nWe can not. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Others think you pay the \nMornay's wages. So we (?) to Edinburgh. Meet us two days from now. Give us \nyour pardon and we'll unite behind you. Scotland will be one. William: One? \nYou mean us and you. Craig: No, I mean this. It's the pledge of Robert the \nBruce. Hamish: You do know it's a trap. Tell him. Stephen: I think if the \nBruce wanted to kill you he'd have done it already at Falkirk. William: Ay. \nStephen: I know, I saw. Hamish: I ain't leaving him aside. What about the \nothers? The scheming bastards couldn't agree on the color of shit. It's a \ntrap, are you blind? William: We've got to try. We can't do this alone. \nJoining the nobles is the only hope for our people. You know what happens \nif we don't take that chance? Hamish: What? William: Nothing. Hamish: I \ndon't want to be a martyr. William: Nor I. I want to live. I want a home, \nand children, and peace. Hamish: Do ya? William: Ay, I do. I've asked God \nfor these things. It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom. Hamish: \nThat's all a dream, William. William: A dream? Just a dream? What we've \nbeen doing all this time; we've lived that dream. Hamish: You dream isn't \nabout freedom. It's about Murron. You're doing this to be a hero because \nyou think she sees you. William: I don't think she sees me. I know she \ndoes. And your father sees you, too. (Hamish hits William) Stephen: Jesus?! \nShall I come with you. William: No, I'll go alone. Stephen: I'll see you \nafter. William: Right. Stephen: Sooner rather than later, I hope. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCraig: He won't come. Robert: He will. I know he will. Guard: My Lord, he \napproaches. (Robert sees trap) Robert: NO! Craig: Stay out of it, Robert. \nRobert: Get Away! Get Away! Craig: The Bruce is not to be harmed. That was \nthe arrangement. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert: Father! You fooking bastard. Why? Why? Leper: Longshanks required \nWallace. So did our nobles. That was the prize of your crown. Robert: Die! \nI want you to die. Leper: Soon enough I'll be dead. And you'll be king. \nRobert: I don't want anything from you. You're not a man, and you're not my \nfather. Leper: You are my son, and you have always known my mind. Robert: \nYou deceived me. Leper: You let yourself be deceived. In your heart, you \nalways knew what had to happen here. At last, you know what it means to \nhate. Now you're ready to be king. Robert: My hate will die with you. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nExecutioner: William Wallace, you stand intained of High Treason. William: \nAgainst whom? Executioner: Against your king. Have you anything to say? \nWilliam: Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to him. Executioner: \nIt matters not. He is your king. Confess, and you may receive a quick \ndeath. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? Do you \nconfess? Then on the morrow you shall receive your purification. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nGuard: Your Highness. Isabella: I will see the prisoner. Guard: We've got \norders from the king that no one-- Isabella: The king will be dead in a \nmonth and his son is a weakling. Who do you think will rule this kingdom? \nNow open this door. Guard: Majesty: Come on, back on your feet. (Guard \nkicks William) Isabella: Stop it. Leave me. I said leave me. William: My \nlady. Isabella: Sir, I've come to beg you to confess all and swear \nallegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. William: Will he show \nmercy to my country? Isabella: Mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live \nin a tower. In time, who knows what could happen. William: If I swear to \nhim, then all that I am is dead already. Isabella: You will die. It will be \nawful. William: Every man dies, not every man really lives. Isabella: Drink \nthis. It will dull your pain. William: No. It will numb my wits, and I must \nhave them all. For if I'm senseless or if I wail, then Longshanks will have \nbroken me. Isabella: I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it. \nWilliam: Alright. (They kiss, and William spits it out) Isabella: I have \ncome to beg for the life of William Wallace. Prince: You're quite taken \nwith him, aren't you. Isabella: I respect him. At worst he was a worthy \nenemy. Show mercy, O great king, and win the respect of your own people. \nEven now you are incapable of mercy. And you. To you that word is as \nunfamiliar as love. Prince: Before he lost his powers of speech he told me \nhis one comfort was he would live to know Wallace was dead. Isabella: You \nsee, death comes to us all. But before it comes to you, know this. Your \nplot dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your \nson will not sit long on the thrown, I swear it. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n(crowd cheers) William: I am so afraid. Give me the strength to die well. \nCommon man: Here he comes! (crowd throws food at him) Executioner: Now \nbehold the awful prize of treason. You will fall to your knees now. Declare \nyourself the king's loyal subject, and beg his mercy, and you shall have \nit. (no response) Executioner: Rope. Stretch him. That's it, stretch him. \nPleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and \nyou will feel no more. (no response) Executioner: Rack him. Enough? (they \nput William on the cross, and begin disembowelment) (William in serious \npain) Executioner: It can all end, right now. Peace. Bliss. Just say it. \nCry out mercy.

(William is \nbeheaded) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert (narrator): After the beheading, William Wallace's body was torn to \npieces. His head was placed on top on London Bridge, his arms and legs sent \nto the four corners of Britain as a warning. It did not have the effect \nthat Longshanks planned. And I, Robert the Bruce, rode out to pay homage to \nthe armies of the English king and accept his endorsement of my crown. \nEnglish noble: I hope you've washed your ass this morning. It's about to be \nkissed by a king. Craig: Come. Lets get it over with. Robert: Stop. You \nhave bled with Wallace, now bleed with me. Craig: Ah! Hamish: Yea! (Throws \nsword; sword lands) Crowd: WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE. \nAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! (Scots charge) William (narrating): In the year of our \nLord 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the \nfields at Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like \nScotsmen. And won their freedom.\ufeff",

These became the Irish, but because of their idolatry and whoring \nout to the \"queen of Heaven\", letting the Roman Catholic Church assert its \ncovetous dominance over their sacred Throne, God overthrew that line with \nyet another He'd planted in Scotland (overturn).  The Scots did the same \n(overturn).  So God, once and for all gave it to the English. \n\nThis became a United Kingdom of God's People, now known as the \"British\". \n\nThis line has, does and WILL sit on the throne of the English people \n(overturn no more) until the second return of Messiah who will take His \nrightful Earthly throne once more, truly being a Son of David. \n\nBrit Ish is Hebrew for Covenant Man. \n\nThis is not a coincidence.\n\nAs far as America, that was not an overthrow of the Crown, but a \"check\" \nput in place for it to remember, because God hates tyrants, especially that \nof His own People. \ufeff",

Britain actually grew much powerful after it \nlost its colonies in North America and basically lost most of its empire \n(and hence its power) during and after WW2. The colonies began to revolt \nand declare independence from the British Empire.",

The actions of this man prove he \ntruly is a hero and a good example for Americas children. Because he is \ndeeply religious and has strong moral convictions he's experienced so much \npersonal guilt and shamefulness about what he did- I believe he's truly \nsorry.  \n\nLet's examine a bit of his career and portfolio as well (compared to other \nHollywood actors and scumbags like Phillip Seymour Hoffman who get praised \nfor doing horribly perverse and twisted films). Mel Gibson on the other \nhand, most of his career has played and action hero who's looking out and \nsaving the innocent from forces of evil. His characters and career have \ninspired greatness from other people who have been persecuted (such as \nmyself.)\n\nI here absolutely everything he's saying in this interview and I believe \nhe's being very honestly and sincere- minus the prey of cowards like the \npress and other members of Hollywood.\n\nMel Gibson has suffered severe clinical depression as a result of this- \nquite frankly I'm worried about him 'cause I think the only dangers he \nimposes is on himself!\n\nNot that it matters, but quite frankly Jews ARE responsible for MANY \nconflicts and other things that have led to wars and bloodshed. Truth is, \nthis is obviously a sensitive issue. In a way, it took alot of courage to \nmake these comments and then explain himself. 'Cause he's NOT a real racist \nand bigot, that's absurd and his character proves otherwise.\n\nI live in Ventura County area and I have never met Mel Gibson, but I've \nbeen a strong supporter of his behind the scenes. \n\nMel If your out there, God bless, continue trusting your heat and standing \nup for what's right. Your movies will continue to grow and inspire people \nas you enter a new phase of your life.\n\nCaptain Community\n\nP.S. Hope it doesn't sound weird but I love Mel Gibson, always will.\ufeff",
