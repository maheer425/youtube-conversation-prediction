High school isn't about \nlearning and preparing for life. It's about knowing general education. Most \nimportantly, it's about preparing for college. It's about nor being \nignorant. People complain they can't learn about what they want to be in \nhigh school. Or that you don't learn, or you lose creativity. But that's \ncomplete and utter bullshit. That's what university is for. University is \nfor learning about what you want to be in your future, not his school.

It's as if the public school is being brought \ninto the home.\n\nUnschooling is an educational method and philosophy that advocates \nlearner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning. In other words, \nunschooling is where children are not taught any curriculum, but rather \nlearn what they want to learn from their curiosity. Therefore, unschooled \nchildren are not even homeschooled. For the most part, they stay home and \nare not encouraged to read or learn any type of curriculum. Parents allow \ntheir unschooled children to do whatever they want.\n\nI see no problem with homeschooling as long as it's done the right way. \nThere are a good number of bright homeschooled kids who do very well and \nexcel in life. \n\nThough, my opinion about unschooling is that it's the most complete stupid \nthing that has ever entered into the minds of individuals. Oh well. I say \nlet the dumb parents unschool their kids because there's always going to be \nmenial jobs and someone has to do them. \n\nIt's one thing to homeschool kids, but it's another thing to keep children \nhome and just let them learn what they want to learn out of their own \ncuriosity and interests. This is without a doubt child neglect. Children \nneed structure and discipline. Unless if a child has a HIGHLY motivated \npersonality, the child will be doomed for life with unschooling ... and I \nblame the parents.\ufeff",

Happy and healthy is probably all parents dreams, \nbut sometimes it's not as simple as many people think it is. My parents for \none didn't have the chance which is why like millions of kids, are sent to \na public school. Many people think that changing a school system to where \nthe focus is more on individual subject is easy, but it's not. What school \nteaches is mass majority and they also cannot exactly provide every single \ncare that homeschooling kids get. I'm not saying that school system \nshould't be changed, there's a lot of things that is wrong with the \nteaching system. And yes is should be changed, but it is hard to make the \nchange when the society's system relies on the people with simple jobs. \nTherefore, in public schools we are taught more to \"copy and paste\" more \nthan to think with a broader mindset. Because be honest, you only need a \nhandful of people to think and make innovative ways than the people who \nactually distribute them to the public. Even that is being taken away \nbecause machines are becoming more effective than people. Which is more of \nthe reason why we need to get our brains working. However, may of the world \nsystem does not realize the world is indeed changing and change needs to \nhappen. Not just in school system's but in the human mindset. Because more \nand more people are coming out of college jobless for the fact that \neverything they have been taught for 20 years or so is mostly rendered \nuseless because the world has changed. \nSo that's just it and this is probably the longest youtube comment I have \never wrote.\nThanks for reading all of this even though you might think it is gibberish.\ufeff",

            "text": "Brilliant talk...I always viewed home school smarter on some levels, but \nweird...having said that, my daughter brilliantly pitched being home \nschooled with bullet points..She is 13 and entering 9th grade...Proud to \nsay my husband and I are gonna home school her...She learned the basics and \nall she really needs to get out of school, bc she has no goal to be a \ndoctor, lawyer or teacher..well, not get paid for it anyway..lol...but she \ncan always take whatever courses she wants. The point is, life is short and \nit's hers to live how she wants to. I trust she will be happy and have the \nfreedom she needs for confidence and strength. I have faith she will go \nfar. I urge parents not to make the mistake of ruling out home schooling \nbec you thought it was weird as I have for so long. I think it's a great \nway to bond with your child and see them bloom! It is a great opportunity \nfor both parent and child. Of course, if your kid wants to go to school and \nthrives in that environment, then by all means they should continue, but if \nnot? Why not consider home schooling as an option? This kid/adult was right \non the mark!!! Great video~\ufeff",
