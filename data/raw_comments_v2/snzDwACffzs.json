But I'm skilled enough to keep my roommate \noblivious to my anger long enough to the point where I eventually let go \nand forget about it. It's very rare for me to actually get to the point \nwhere I 'unleash.' So far it's only happened once. I'm planning on keeping \nit that way.

Its a place to stay until you're \ndone with college, basically. You are NOT the only person who feels alone \nand insecure at the dorms. Just try to talk to someone. Everyone I've met \nis friendly.

I did finally try smoking it near the end of my senior year though. \nWhen I got to college though, that changed. My first semester, I smoked \nlike crazy but never drank. Second semester was both, but not too much. \nIt's probably because I had never done it, so I used it all in excess when \nI was finally able to. College changes you. It may not make you a drug \naddict but things will change and you might end up trying things you never \nin a million years thought you'd try. I have done many things that people \nwould never expect from the high school-me.

Once you have the necessary basic courses done, *take the harder courses \nwithin your first two years if possible* - if you\u2019re applying to grad \nschool they\u2019ll usually look at only the grades of the last two years. (In \nCanada, anyways - don\u2019t take my word on that for other countries!)\n\n2.*If your university has multiple campuses, don\u2019t assume courses are \ntransferable just because the campus is part of the same university.*  I \nknow, it makes no sense, but most of the time they don\u2019t actually transfer. \nCheck with your advisor first.\n\n3. *Always get everything your advisor tells you in writing.* That way if \nthe information they gave you was wrong you have a way of proving the \nmistake was not on your end.\n\n4. a) *If you can, take a course during the Spring and one during the \nSummer semester.* That way you can take one less class during the normal \nsemester and make your life a bit easier. You usually end up with a week or \ntwo between semesters anyway, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll have no vacation \nwhatsoever.\n\nb) *If you can, make it a class you know you\u2019ll need to take at some point \nbut you know you\u2019re likely to struggle in/have more work assigned;* that \nway you only have the one class to focus on and you can actually do well on \nit instead of barely scraping by.\n\nc) *Don\u2019t take more than one class per semester in the spring/summer \nsemesters.* One a semester is more than manageable. Two is insanity, \nbecause they\u2019re compressed courses. \n\n5. *Always save screenshots of any and all payments you make online, \nregardless of whether you get an email receipt.* If it gets sent to the \nwrong place or there\u2019s some internal error you\u2019ll have a copy to show as \nproof of payment.\n\n6. *Do your best on the little assignments.* They\u2019re a great grade cushion \nfor the big tests. If you go to a small university (or attend small \nclasses), it will also show your professor that you\u2019re a responsible \nstudent, so if you have a problem with handing in something on time in the \nfuture they\u2019ll be more likely to be lenient and understanding.\n\n7. *Back up everything. Always. Without fail. Don\u2019t put it off for even a \nday.*\n\n8. *Use resources available to you for help.* If your school has a writing \ncentre, use it. Even if you just want someone to help you get your essay \nplanning in order, look over your final copy of a paper, or to look over \nthe bibliography to make sure it\u2019s ok.\n\n9. *If you have the books or readings before class starts, get ahead on \nnotes and reading as much as possible.* \u2018Cause once the semester starts, \nain\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\n10. *Start on your essays as soon as possible, even if it\u2019s just choosing a \ntopic and doing preliminary research.* Later on in the semester when due \ndates and exams pile up it\u2019ll save you a world of grief.\n\n11. *Don\u2019t bother to make perfect citations as you write, but make sure you \nhave a way of knowing where the citation came from.* You never know what \nyou\u2019re gonna cut out in the end, so taking the time to make perfect \ncitations as you write your essay is a waste of time; but you need to have \nsome way of knowing where it came from so you\u2019re not having to hunt it down \nlater. I usually just use a keyword I know relates to a certain article (or \neven make a list of which keyword goes with what) and then go back in the \nend and make the citations.\n\n12. As much as I hate doing them, *essay planning actually helps*. It saves \non a lot of editing later. Dammit.\ufeff",
