            "text": "The reason the skits on Studio C are not geared towards LDS is to keep the \nhumor more relate-able to others outside our faith. When they were part of \n'divine comedy' at BYU, that was humor that really only LDS people would \nget. Since this is actually public and seen by more than just members of \nthe church, and to make it more appealing to the masses, they are keeping \nthe jokes neutral so anyone can enjoy and relate. Besides, it's all just \nsilly non-sense anyways and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Like you \nyourself said- just stop watching and don't worry about it. It's not going \nto impact your life if you don't watch it either way. =)",
