It's even more so for large \nequipment. Productivity is absolutely key in heavy equipment. They spend \ntens of millions on large mining trucks and heavy; they need to to produce \nas much every day as possible. A vehicle that breaks down or needs to stop \nworking a couple times every week for maintenance is an abomination. Having \nto stop and charge multiple times a day is the same. Switching batteries \nrequires time and facilities that cost money, while a diesel truck can just \nfill up a 1,000 gallon tank of diesel in the morning and go all day.\n  Yes, electric motors make a great deal of torque, but the energy storage \nis impossible with modern battery tech. That is why when they do use \nelectric motors they store energy as diesel fuel, convert it with a big \nturbodiesel engine, and then send it to electric motors in the wheels. \nThat's how most American locomotives work, and that's the way that the very \nbiggest mining trucks works. For anything smaller, it's not worth the extra \ncost, weight and complexity of having to fit an engine AND electric motors \ninto the vehicle. It's called \"diesel-electric transmission\".\nIn Europe, electric trains that take power off of an overhead line are most \npopular, but it's not so easy in the US. The US is much bigger, and \ntherefor it would require us to pay to lay down much more line to cover all \nthe main tracks. Second, transmission lines literally loose power over \ndistance, so it would require huge inputs to have sufficient power at the \nend of a long line, and you have to keep that line powered 24/7, in case a \ntrain runs over it. The expense is enormous. Most American rail lines are \nless intensively used than European ones, so it would take long for the \ncost of electrifying to pay off. Rail has been more popular in Europe, \nbecause the distances are shorter (less track laying and maintainance \ncosts), but particularly electric rail, because fuel has always been much \nmore expensive in Europe. In the US, electric trains don't make sense. But \nI've gotten off topic now...",

HP-second is a unit measure of work.   \npower is also Force x velocity.     taking a mass  and accelerate it to \n100mph will take a certain amount KE.  this is regardless If you take a \nyear to do it, or 5 seconds.    Both will take 2,000,000 J as an example, \n lets say.That's 2,000,000 watt seconds or 2,000,000/746 = 2600 \nHP-seconds.   this means, if you want to accelerate to 100mph , you need \n2600hp to do it in 1 second, or 260hp to do it in 10 seconds, or only 26hp \nif you have 100seconds.    you get the idea.    this is not something im \njust making up.  ITS THE FOUNDATION of the potential of a vehicles ability \nto accelerate and it has NOTHNG to do with engine torque,  and everything \nto do with rear wheel torque.  I don't care what gear you are in, or \nanything. if you have a certain level of HP available, it will dictate the \nacceleration potential.   And sure, you can use rear wheel torque but that \nis hardly ever measured or known and is much harder to calculate.dynos \nmeasure rate of change of KE, because they have the drum dimensions and the \nspeed change of the drums.    rate of change of KE = HP.",

            "text": "+Bone Daddy There are many ways to determine the \"efficiency\" of a vehicle \nwith an ICE. These types of motors put out a lot of heat, so by thermal \nefficiency standards, they are not very efficient. Mechanically, there is \nusually only about a 5% loss of energy in an ICE, due to friction and \nmomentum, etc. When electricity is generated at a larger scale, even if a \npower plant used a gigantic ICE, the friction and thermal losses would \naccount for a smaller portion of the total energy generated, due to the \nsmaller relative surface area of the walls of a larger combustion chamber. \nRemember, heat is transferred most efficiently through conduction, which \nrequires surface area. Combustion chamber volume increases a lot faster \nthan wall surface area as diameter increases (2pi(r) vs pi(r^2)). \nTheoretically, larger electric motors (generators) are more efficient than \nsmaller ones for the same reason. At the most basic, large power generation \nplants are more efficient than ICEs. You then get into power distribution \nand transmission and thats another issue altogether, but i'm not an \nelectrical engineer. So.. to settle your argument, centralized power \ngeneration is more efficient, due to economies of scale and thermodynamics. \nI'm just trying to spread some info, and yes, I am a mechanical engineer, \nor actually I will be in a few months (certs take time).",

This is considering the 400kw statement to be \ngross (makes gross tq 1000) , so a 15% loss would make 340kW at the wheels. \nWith horsepower peaking at 2350ish rpm, torque was already down to 760 \nftlbs. another clue: these motors have rated power figures that list the \nvoltage and amperes current draw.

This \nbattery design is like 3-4 years old. Now, presented in last year Mercedes \nSLS Electric has the same 60 kwh battery pack which weights twice less, 550 \nkg.\nBasically, take two SLS battery packs and combine it with Tesla drivetrain, \nand you have 600 km range car.
