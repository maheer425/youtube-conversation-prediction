Read my posts again because I think you have reading comprehension \nissues. Like I said, Egyptians were a *unique* group of people and no one \nelse can claim their history but them.\n\nHowever, I have to also point out that we are not speaking about mixing \nthrough \"invasions\". I am speaking of their passive mixing, how they \n*became* what they were. We're talking about the way the Egyptians depicted \nthemselves and what we know about them through DNA evidence. \n\n\"DNA studies have shown that only 15% of modern day arab speaking egyptians \nhave had their genetic profile affected by foreign mixture.\" - So I went to \nthe article. The writer links to a wikipedia page as evidence...and I \ncannot find that information on the Wikipedia page at all. It's not there. \nGo look for yourself. Find it and show it to me. \n\nNow, what you quote isn't what he said. He said that 15% of the DNA of \nmodern day Egyptians are from outside. Not that 15% of Egyptians have DNA \nfrom outside. Now. This is an average and averages aren't the best measure \nof central tendency. I could have 30% admixture, you could have 1% and now \nthe average is just about 15%. Speaking on that, though. Most African \nAmericans are only 15-25% European DNA. Most of their DNA is from \nNiger-Congo region. But here's the thing. In NYC, you can always tell that \nsomeone is *from* Africa, rather than Afro American. They look different. \nSo if Egyptians were mixed to begin with...then mixed some more.\n\nThe article he links to says the following:\n\n\"In 2013, Nature announced the publication of the first genetic study \nutilizing next-generation sequencing to ascertain the ancestral lineage of \nan Ancient Egyptian individual. The research was led by Carsten Pusch of \nthe University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany and Rabab Khairat, who released their \nfindings in the Journal of Applied Genetics. DNA was extracted from the \nheads of five Egyptian mummies that were housed at the institution. All the \nspecimens were dated between 806 BC and 124 AD, a timeframe corresponding \nwith the late Dynastic period. The researchers observed that one of the \nmummified individuals likely belonged to the mtDNA haplogroup I2, a \nmaternal clade that is believed to have originated in Western Asia.[33]\"\n\nAh. So the *maternal* line is from up North. Okay. Sure, but that's only \nhalf the puzzle. You see, it matters where in Egypt the mummy, and in \ntruth, modern Egyptians are from. \n\n\"A study by Krings et al. (1999) on mitochondrial DNA clines along the Nile \nValley found that a Eurasian cline runs from Northern Egypt to Southern \nSudan and a Sub-Saharan cline from Southern Sudan to Northern Egypt.[25]\" - \nGet it? \n\n\"*ABO blood group distribution shows that the Egyptians form a sister group \nto North African populations, including Berbers, Nubians and Canary \nIslanders.*\"\n\nOh? What's this? Go on...\n\n\"A DNA study Hawass at al. (2012) of two male mummies, Ramesses III and the \nother possibly his son Pentawere, from the 20th dynasty of the New Kingdom \nfound that they carried the haplogroup E1b1a.[16]\"\n\nHmm, OK. Let's find out where that group comes from.\n\n\"In human genetics, Haplogroup E-V38 is a human Y-chromosome DNA \nhaplogroup. It is the phylogenetic term for the series of unique sequence \nvariants on the human Y-chromosome. It is often found in African males and \ntheir descendants and is heritably passed in lineage from father to son. \nGeneticists study these variants in populations to find the evolutionary \nlineage to a common male human ancestor. *It can also be referred to in \nphylogenetic nomenclature by names such as E1b1a (although the exact \ndefinition of phylogenetic names can vary over time).*\n\nE-V38 has two basal branches, E-M329 and E-M2, the former is almost \nexclusively found in Ethiopia. The E-M2 branches are the predominant \nlineage in Western Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the \nsouthern parts of Eastern Africa.\"\n\nWell well well. Let's think about what this means. Ancient Egyptians are \nclose in blood to modern Egyptians. But guess what? So what? They are STILL \nmixed!! The reason we say there aren't anything and are unique is because \nthey were mixed from the very beginning.\n\nSo saying there's no *new* \"Admixture\" doesn't mean jack. That's like \nsaying that Dominicans aren't black or white. Yes, that's true. They are \nblack *and* white! From the very beginning. So if you compared the blood of \na colonial Dominican and a modern one, you'd find that there has been \"no \nsignificant admixture\". However, this does not mean they were not \n*originally* a mixed group. Peace. ",

I only said they could have developed their \nown comparable systems of mathematics, because they had the same brains as \nus.  The only difference would have been that their numbers probably didn't \nlook like our own numbers, they may not have used a decimal base, et \ncetera.  They still would have been able to do the same things with them, \neven if they didn't happen to call pi \"pi,\" and they didn't happen call the \ngolden ratio \"the golden ratio.\"\n\nAs for the meanings that the Egyptians attached to certain heavenly bodies, \nthat's just astrology, which isn't actually science, and doesn't really \nfigure into engineering monumental structures.  The reason I brought up \nD.C. is not because I was really so naive to think that no other \ncivilizations have ever been influenced by the Egyptians, but because our \ncurrent civilizations attach meanings to heavenly bodies in our own \ntraditions too.  So, when someone thinks its meaningful that -- for \ninstance -- the pyramids in the Giza necropolis line up with Orion's belt, \nand someone else thinks it's meaningful when the Washington monument acts \nas a sundial, the point of them having been built those respective ways is \nbasically the same.  It's just a way of bolstering their legitimacy in the \nminds of the governed by tying those things in with existing knowledge \nand/or belief systems.\n\nAll I'm trying to do is think of and discuss rational explanations for how \nand why the pyramids got there.  What is it that I should be conceding to \nexactly?  That the Egyptians got the technology from aliens or something? \n Just how would saying something like that be giving the Egyptians credit?\n\nNow, do I think it's an unsatisfactory hypothesis that the Egyptians just \nbuilt the pyramids to be tombs, and thus built them originally for \nreligious reasons?  Why should I?  Look at all those Gothic cathedrals in \nEurope, and try to calculate how many man-hours of labor and how much money \nin today's figures went into those, and ask me again if the tomb hypothesis \nsits well with me, when the people who built the pyramids apparently \nbelieved they were building them for literal gods.",

There was also a \npretty clear chronological progression in the size and degree of complexity \nreached by the tombs, which started out as fairly unimpressive 'mastabas', \nbut which gradually became bigger and more elaborate before the first \npyramids started being built; again, with the earlier pyramids generally \nbeing smaller and of more conservative design than the later ones.\n\nPlus, looking at pyramids from a commonsense economic perspective (which \nrarely seems to be done for some reason), once you start mobilizing and \ncommitting the kind of labor and resources necessary for building just one \npyramid, what are you going to do after that?  Just stop?  There would have \nbeen a bewildering number of economic activities associated both directly \nand indirectly with the building of pyramids and other monumental \nstructures, and if you just pulled the plug on all of them by choosing to \nnot keep building stuff, it wouldn't be very good for the local economy, to \nsay the least.\n\nIn addition to huge amounts of manual labor -- who, even if they were \nunpaid slaves, would have needed to be fed, housed and clothed, and would \nhave thus still created economic activities -- there would have also needed \nto be a large number of skilled and educated people working on the planning \nand engineering of those things, and doing so was probably their entire \nlivelihood.

I guess there were slaves for the 'heavy lifting' as \nI doubt all workers were paid quite so well.\nSlavery in ancient Egypt is debated; something that cannot necessarily be \nequated to our modern understanding of slavery since it is believed they \nwere treated exceptionally well compared to Graeco-Roman or modern slavery.\nTreating a slave well as a case of morality and, in Egyptian funerary \nliterature, one often swore they did not mistreat their slaves (which \nmeans, since they were inclined to say so, that some probably did.) It is \nevident, however, that slaves in elite households had a pretty good job \ncompared to other peasants.\n\nAlso, an inaccuracy with the writing systems mentioned; Hieroglyphics was \nthe original, decorative and a lengthy process to write, and used in \nfunerary architecture or any other stone inscription. Hieratic was then \ninvented from hieroglyphics for use in documents, notes, letters, doctor \nprescriptions etc. Demotic was not used until the Third Int.
