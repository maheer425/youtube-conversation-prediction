Unless you have educational difficulties, \nyou won't even notice if it was difficult or not to learn your native \nlanguage.\n\nSome languages prepare you for learning other ones (for example, polish is \neasier for any slavic root language speaker, while spanish will be easier \nfor other latin-rooted language speakers), that's why as you get \nprofficient with more languages, it will get also easier to learn new ones. \nBut a language with 5 genders, 17 ways to say the number \"2\", 8 \nconjugations...
