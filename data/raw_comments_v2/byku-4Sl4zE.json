It was all massive \nexplosions, ridiculous gadgets (invisible car anyone?) and oneliners. No \ndepth or dialogue to speak of at all.\n\nSo when Casino Royale came out I was really happy that they had decided to \ngo in a completely different direction. I think the reason we have such \ndifferent opinions on this movie is that I really enjoyed the plot (a few \nobvious holes aside) and the pace of the film, but that is of course purely \na matter of opinion and personal taste. I also think Daniel Craig's more \nemotionally troubled and flawed Bond is so much more believable (especially \nsince the story in this movie is supposed to take place before all the \nother movies), and because I believe in the character I got so much more \nemotionally involved in the film than I have with any of the previous Bond \nfilms. Previous films were of course not trying to get you emotionally \ninvolved, they were just trying (and largely succeeding) in being \nentertaining, but personally I prefer a story that I can feel more involved \nin.\n\nI'll agree with you that they might have moved too far in the other \ndirection from what it used to be, as you say the movie relies entirely on \nthe plotline and the acting, especially because it's too long (I didn't \nthink so the first time I saw it but second time it started to drag towards \nthe end.) I think the movie could've been made better by speeding up the \nstory a bit, there's a lot of content that didn't strictly speaking need to \nbe there. So I can see that if you don't enjoy the storyline it can get \ndesperately boring. But as I said, I really liked the story, and \nconsequently really enjoyed the film. It's also very well produced from a \ntechnical standpoint, good camera angles and cuts (as opposed to Quantum of \nSolace, which was just unwatchable),and great sound and music.\n\nBut anyways, personal opinions and all that jazz, sorry for the essay.",
