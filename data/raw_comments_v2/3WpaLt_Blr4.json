I am in not any way saying that I know \nthe magic number but just by looking at the last century we know that we \nactually don't know the number. Let's look at the smartphone as an example. \nWell, a 100 years ago the things you needed to have in order to make \neverything that an smartphone give you (everything achiaveble at the era) \nwas exponentially higher, meaning more resources spent on building the same \nstuff and that means that the number of people who could live in earth with \nthe same purchasing power was less than 3 billions (You just need to look \nat how computers were before) so, using this simple example I can go out on \na limb and say that maybe in 40 years we will find a way to copy \nphotosynthesis and make energy as efficiently as plants, computers could be \nhologram-like and spent a lot more less resources in making them (maybe \nplugging it in our heads from the get go, although that would be orwellian \nis you think about it) and fields and crops could be, through innovation, \nenhanced to be more plentiful than today. I am obviously getting out of my \nway making a lot of invented examples but, if we actually knew what we \ncould achieve 200 hundreds years ago, or even a mere 50 years ago, \ncalculations from these times would have been different.\n\nThe other is putting nuclear besides coal and oil, while nuclear energy is \ndangerous, a chemistry major can tell you that thorium reactor or other \ntypes of nuclear reactors are fairly stable and the risk is as manageable \n(even more so) than an oil spill. There are lots of pros in nuclear energy \nand while yes, it is risky, people is working to make it less so and there \nare ways now to provent fukushima-like disasters. Apart from the fact that \nfor example thorium reactors shut off instantly wand do not need pressure \nto function, giving then the advantage in nuclear energy,\n\nThanks.\ufeff",
