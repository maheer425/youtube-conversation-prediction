I don't know when it came or where it will be in 10 \nyears, but something changed the people's mind. The idea of a \"vegan\" or \n\"vegetarian\" lifestyle exploded and spread out everywhere. And the people \n(me included), who hadn't even thought 2 years ago about their lifstyle are \nstarting to recognize that there is a way (or the way) to life and eat \nhealthy. I'm a vegetarian for not a long time and I'm not that informed or \na specialist for vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, but I'm open for a change. And \nnot everybody has to change his whole lifestyle from everyday-eating-meat \nto vegan, but everybody has to be open for knowledge and new ideas. \nI really don't know what I wanted to say or what the intention of my text \nis, just my thought unorganized :) Laura, 14 years old from Germany \nStay fine \n\ufeff",

            "text": "This is what I call \"civilized retardation\".\n\nFirst, \"carnism\" is a bullshit word. We've been hunting and eating meat \nbefore civilization, before society. It is a rational choice made by human \nwho lived in a world where most of the nutrition sources cannot be digested \nby us. Pigs/hogs, cows/buffalo, we choose to eat them because they're \neasily-killed mountains of meat that outweight the risk of them fighting \nback. And the animals of choice are not similar around the world. Africans \nuse to kill elephants for meat but that's been outlawed due to the whole \nivory business. In China people used to never eat beef because they needed \ncows to plow their fields, which makes cows important assets. Same goes \nwith dogs. We derive greater utility from keeping dogs than from killing \nthem, and that fits out capability to compassionate and emotionally bond, \nsomething fundamental for us social creatures. Besides, a dog simply don't \nprovide much meat.\n\nAnyway, the point is we didn't start eating meat because it's some retarded \nideology. We eat meat because we had to choose between killing an animal \nand eating its corpse, and trying to gather fruits and grains from nature \nwhich may take hours to fill the stomach of one person. It is undeniable \nthat we harness joy from eating, which led to the food industry today that \nsupplies all sorts of food for us without us sucking the earth dry. Meat \nindustry is only a part of it, the only thing is that this particular \nsector is bloodier.\n\nSo if you choose to be vegetarian because that makes you feel better, go \nahead, but don't pull some ideological bullshit on me. My ancestors did not \nfight their way to the top of food chain by eating grass. There're theories \nout there that says eating cooked meat actually helped human brains develop \nand evolve. Think about that.\ufeff",

Well, you ll \nknow when you wanna be compassionate about whatever.\n\nI actually frequently say one of the reasons i dont really feel \"above\" \nanyone by being a vegetarian is because its just one of the several ways \nyou can choose to do less promotion to pain. Other ways are to stop buying \nthings produced by ill paid workers, and etc\n\nThe reason I am a vegetarian is because if I eat meat, I KNOW it was killed \nfor me (or well, someone) . If I see a shoe, it may or may not have been \nmade by underpaid workers.\n\nthe nice thing about being a vegetarian is that being against meat industry \nautomatically makes you help a lot of causes: if meat consumption stopped \ntoday, we \u00b4d have way mroe food to feed the world, we\u00b4d have WAAAAY less \npollution to the atmosphere (the main contributor to global arming is the \nindustry, which alone contributes more than all transportation worldwide) , \nwe would postpone the lack of drinking water several more years,we would \nSTILL be avoiding the deliberate pain and torture of millions of sentient \nbeings AND the most optimal way of eating uses ZERO trans fat (and all meat \nand dairy comes from trans fat (yeah, technically it IS better to be vegan \nthat vegetarian, obviously under al this line of reasoning) )\n\nSo when you tell me starving kids in africa I really just hear someone say \n\"if I cant fix everything, then I dont care about anything\"\n\nAnd as said previously, sure, there is no arguing against that. I certainly \ndont want a legislation. Against eating meat (it would be worst than \nalcohol prohibition quite obviously)\n\nSo I just want more of the average human being than your level of care, and \neven, than my current level of care (as I am a vegetarian, and not a vegan, \nand I take no concern as to from where my milk comes from)\n\nStill, the moment I know I went vegetarian, means I did SOMETHING , \ndeliberate, a CHANGE, a deliberate change to stand closer into what I \nbelieve in.
