Just thought I'd like to add a \ncouple facts that I've always considered highly pertinent (and pretty \nimpressive)\n- The Brothers Chaps made a decision early on that neither the website nor \nanything they sold under its banner would contain foul language or anything \ngrossly inappropriate like extreme violence or scatology. There could be \npiles of \"whatsit\", there could be beer references, there could be a \n*little* blood, but that's as far as they would ever push it. The reason \nwas simple: they didn't want another South Park. They considered \ngratuitous... well, everything beneath them. This not only made the site \nfar more kid-friendly than most Flash sites of the era (IIRC it even got \nrecommendations from some family groups), but prevented them from taking \ncheap shortcuts to get laughs. Two big reasons why the franchise has been \nso enduring (and lucrative!).\n- The reason they were able to devote so much time to the website was, \nwell, it was all they had. This was one of the few websites where the sales \nwere more than enough to make a living off of, and they did just fine. The \nbiggest changes were 1) getting noticed by bigtime studios and getting a \nchance to make even more money, and 2) starting families, thereby *needing* \nsaid real jobs. They never like to make a big deal out of downtimes, no \nmatter how long... maybe it's a few seconds of Strong Bad ripping away \npacking tape, maybe it's a short, but their world doesn't infringe into \nFree Country.\n\nBarring a successor of some kind, we'll almost certainly never see regular \nupdates again, but this is big and fondly remembered enough that it's \nunlikely to ever completely go away.\n\nP.S.
