They do this every so often because it's lacking in their diet. \nThe same way other wild species will seek out salt every so often. Not all \ndogs do this, which can be for a number of reasons: Some may not have the \ninstinctive ability to know that such an important ingredient is missing \nfrom their processed food, so they don't associate the small of certain \nblades of grass as the remedy for them feeling slightly malnutritioned. Or \nthey can't smell it in the grass. Or their bodies are better at processing \nand storing B17. Or they that B17 is abundant in their particular food \nproducts which could be varied. (Organic foods will have higher chance of \ncontaining B17 but possibly not in that particular organic source). I heard \nthat scientists were locked up and stripped of their credibilities in the \nUSA for trying to publish their research on B17. Not saying that's a fact. \nJust 3rd hand information. The information is on youtube and of course the \nweb as a whole.\n\nApparently nearly all Bears that live in zoo's develop cancer. With no \ncases of cancer identified in wild Bears. This is said to be because of the \ndiet bears are fed in zoo's. Where their diet in the wild contained rich \namounts of B17 and their captive food containing none or very little at \nall. And there's a Himalayas nation of a million people who not only have \namong the longest, if not thee longest life spans, but they have never had \na single case of cancer among them. They eat a nut which has the highest \nconcentration of B17 in the world.
