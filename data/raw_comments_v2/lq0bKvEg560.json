African nations have been asking for help from \nwestern nations for a VERY long time. they have been screaming. we WANT \ninvestment in infrastructure and resources but since western nations had \ntheir own particular motives. like, getting oil real cheap..they didnt \nbother investing. but theres a new player in town and everyone likes him.. \nhe never colonized africa and he is investing like a mad man in africa with \nno political attachments, china.. with africa as a partner china would \ncontinue to grow for decades and africa would be INDUSTRIALIZED too. \nwestern model of industralization has been turned upside down by the new \nplayers like india, china and brazil.. 200 years of western domination is \nover. europe is fractured and america is in debt and has moved 40 percent \nof its manufacturing industries offshore and is now addicted to imports \ninstead of exports. which was what made it great and spelled its rise in \n1950s after the WW2.\ufeff",
