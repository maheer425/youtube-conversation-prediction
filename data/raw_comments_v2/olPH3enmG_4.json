Friend C always \ndrives when we go somewhere and always pays.  Friend C texts me almost \nevery day and said when I visit since his work schedule is flexible he will \nescort me around Seoul one day.  Friend C also looked at where I was going \nto stay and wanted to know the exact location, how far it was from the \nsubway etc. and was very specific with where I should stay.

Friend B started sending me tons of \npictures and short videos of he and his nephew (super cute kid, love him!) \nHe also said if he couldn't get time off work when I visit he would quit \nhis job, possibly, since its close to time for him to go back to school. He \nthen said if he was able to go to the University near me he wants to be my \nroommate! I started thinking \"omo, this is serious!\" After that I \napproached him more cautiously. Friend C always questioned who I was going \nto see while in Korea. He would ask \"your friend, he or she?\" That threw me \noff and I wasn't sure how to answer. Friend B got gifts on Valentines Day \nso I thought everything was fine, were just friends. Then he told me he was \ngoing to stay with me a few days after I got to Seoul then I was going to \nstay with his family when I visit his home town. He'd already spoken to \nthem and it was settled. I was back to being confused. He asked for a pair \nof sneakers, saying he would give me the money when I get there. I said \nsure, then he picked a pair for me. They were the low top version of the \nones he wanted. Looked like couple shoes to me so I made it a point to \nmention the matching shoes, staying with his family and all that. I thanked \nhim for going to such great lengths. He said it was because he was Korean \nand he wants to make sure I have a good time when I visit Korea. So he's \njust being nice? Aigoo! I don't know! Friend C took me to a very expensive \ndinner his last night here and made sure I had his number in Korea and his \nKT ID so we stay in touch. He still pressed me about my friend asking he or \nshe LOL add to that friend C and I went to dinner every week. He would help \nme with my Korean after we ate, which is the only part of the evening that \nkept it from feeling like a date. I asked why he always drove, his answer \nwas \"in Korea the man always drives!\" .....I thought that was only when \ndating, or is that for everything? I'm so confused!

When I was a teen I lived in Atlanta, Georgia and there was a \ngirl from South Korea who decided that she and I were soul mates and she \nloved me and was all obsessive and creepy with out even asking me if I \nwanted to date her.  It was awkward because I had a girl friend already, \nshe was not happy about this creepy girl.  It was kinda crazy.  I remember \none day I was home sick and not feeling social, and the creepy girl decided \nthat she was going to visit me.....with out making sure it was ok first.  I \nwas not happy to see her.  She didn't seem to understand subtlety either. \n I tried to \"break up\" with her a few times, finally I had to say \"Look I'm \ndating so-and-so and not you.  I never wanted to date you. I'm sorry but \ndon't call me or text me again.\"  It sucked\ufeff",
