Silence gets us thinking about \nthings that matter and very deep thoughts. Occasionally, these thoughts \nlead to us becoming paranoid. I believe that silence scares us now a days \nis because we are focused living for now (which is not necessarily a bad \nthing), and when the silence creeps up it has us tricked that its all over \nand we shouldn't be wasting those seconds of our short lives. This is all \nreasonable thinking, but I agree with you John that we should all learn to \nappreciate the quiet a little more. In my opinion, it will lessen stress \nfrom our busy lives.\ufeff",

Like, really poor and the mentality of being frugal with my \nmoney has persisted into my adult life, despite having disposable income \nenough to spend without tragic consequences such as not eating. As such, I \navoid luxury items like iPods or MP3 players and for a long time, smart \nphones because neither of those things were things I could eat or things \nthat would provide me warmth in the winter. Compound this with not really \nhaving friends to begin with, I got quite used to walking here and there \nwithout \"noise\". This was especially true when I could still run -- when I \nwas doing 30-75 minute runs, it was the most peaceful time of my life, \ncontrasting all the bad stuff going on. Just me, the trail in the forest, \nfocusing on my breathing and taking one more step.\n\nFast forward 10 years and I'm walking to and from class and an alarming \nnumber of people have their heads bowed in reverence to their digital deity \nand/or have headphones/ear buds plugged into their ears, almost constantly \ntrying to avoid a moment of prolonged silence.\n\nSilence is fantastic. I feel like allowing myself time everyday to focus on \njust re-organizing my thoughts is like tidying up your office space or \nde-frag'ing your computer. I can reach out into my \"mind palace\", to steal \na phrase from Sherlock (although mine's more like a \"mind studio \napartment\"), and readily access the stuff I regularly take inventory of \nduring those moments of silence and it's what I think has helped me succeed \nas a student. At least academically. Again, I've probably failed as a human \nbeing in respect to being social.\ufeff",
