Now Spazz, for all \nintents and purposes is a Mojito Cat. She is the friendliest most outgoing \nfeline imaginable. (half-calico half something else. cute as a button. \nANYWAYS) my dad would come back and look at Spazz, she would meow and roll \nover and rub her back on the chair; the whole nine yards. Dad reaches down \nto pet her, she jumps down, tail up, and trots off. That, or just before my \ndad would sit down, \"Mrrreaow\" (You know, when they add that cute little \npurr into their meow) and bam, there's Spazz, tail up, looking at Daddy. \nThis went on for about thre hours, about twenty times before Dad just gave \nup and went to bed. Me and his cousin were convinced that Spazz knew \nexactly what she was doing and knew full well she was pissing him off and \nman was it FUNNY (Not to worry my dad thought it was the funniest damn \nthing in the world, too.) If you have any insight as to why she might have \nbeen doing that it would be appreciated. Love your shows and your channel!\n-Emily\ufeff",

My \nquestion is how long do you wait before you give good attention when they \nare in a middle of a crying session? I've heard him say as little as 10 \nseconds. Is that really all the time they need? (yes I realize they are \ncrying because they are bored or something is wrong, or want to play, and \nI'm trying to address that as well)\ufeff",

A mojito cat you could say. My brother comes down from college and \nshe loves him as much as she loves everyone else that comes into the house, \nbut she gets a little eccentric with him. By eccentric i mean she'll be all \ncalm and relaxed one minute with him patting her, but then she starts \nmeowing really loudly and chases after him, wanting him to pat her some \nmore. She's never done this with anyone else. Sometimes it frightens my \nbrother how much she wants his attention to go as far as chase him around \nfrantically and demand for attention. Now my brother does play games with \nher such as hide and seek where he basically runs away and hides somewhere, \ndrawing her attention to where he could be. So i am wondering if her \nfrantic behavior is something related to the games they play.\ufeff",

We moved into a new house 6 \nmonths. We used to have a problem with the cats peeing/spraying on the \nwalls in the old house. They really destroyed the carpets and such. The \nonly ones not fixed there were the 2 males that were 6 so before we moved \ninto the new place we had them fixed.

I have Comfort \nZone w/Feliway Diffuser in the wall and I have a toy called\nDa Bird and a laser I use to play with them.

He has his cup of food for the whole day in his room and some days he \ndoesn't touch his plate, some days he eats it all. I've tried changing the \ntype of food but he started throwing up all over the house so we came back \nto the old type and the throwing up stopped. He isn't fat nor too skinny \neither.\n2nd. He sleeps ALL THE TIME! I've tried to get him up and be active, I \ntried playing with him but he is so uninterested most of the time that even \nI get bored, throughout the day he runs all over the house as if something \nis chasing him! And then I get up to try to chase him and he runs as if \nplaying tag! It's hilarious but it's the most exercise he gets.\n3rd. He doesn't like being held! Or petted. I have family come over and he \nmeows at them when they get close to him and then if they try to pick him \nup he meows as if he were complaining. He doesn't do that with me because I \nguess he is used to me but he does seem to want me to let him go. And no I \ndon't pick him up or carry him around too much.\n4th. When we sleep some nights rarely he does the crazy running and also \nthe talking, goes around the house meowing as if he is either calling me or \nsomeone or just talking to himself. He also comes to the bed and finally \nsleeps right between my legs, which is about the only closeness I get to \nhave with him so I do the best I can to stay still and let him sleep.\nFinally, is all of this behavior normal??? He is antisocial but he doesn't \nhide, or stay mainly on the ground, he is usually up on something, couch, \ntree, bed, looking out the window or on the tallest box close to the \nceiling.\ufeff",

I got rid of my problem (i have like 4+cats and one male cat had the \nsame problem) when i bought 2 extra huge plastic boxes (i think its \n75cm*50cm). it is said that for a cat you would need +1 litter box. aka if \nu have 2 cats, then 3 litter boxes. but in my case the 2 huge ones worked \nvery well. also it can be the litter material itself. the extra clumping \nworks best for my case.\n\nAlso if it wont fix your problem, then i think you should get your cat \nchecked @ the doc, cuz she might have some bladder issues. but i dont think \nthis is the case right now.
