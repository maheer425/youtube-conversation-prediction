NASA is help up as the \ninefficiency of the public sector. Conveniently forgetting that Boeing and \nLockheed Martin are private companies and have been comparably bloated and \ninefficient at bring about a new usable rocket. Russian Space Agency have \nalso managed to build rockets for way lower cost that NASA. That is why the \nRussian got most of the world's launches. They did all of this on budgets \nless than 1 tenth of the NASA budget. They are public. So clearly it isn't \nabout public vs private but how each individual organization is run.\n\nSpaceX does well for many of the same reasons as any startup company \nusually does better than established behemoths. Startups are usually full \nof dedicated people eager to make a difference and open to doing things in \na new way. \n\nAnd one might wonder what sort of failure NASA really is as they are not so \nmuch developing rockets as they are managing money and providing expertise \nto various private contractors. The failure is just as much with these \nprivate contractors as it is with NASA. Ultimately I'd say the problem is \nNASA being hamstrung too much political meddling. The answer isn't to close \ndown NASA or privatize it but to make it independent and not subject to the \nwhims of politicians.\ufeff",

For \ninstance, they are using newer fabrication techniques from the airline \nindustry, improved computing technology to do complex tasks (landing the \nfirst stage), and in general approaching this as an opportunity to cut \ncost. A smarter idea would NOT have been for NASA to use their subsidies \nmodels as they have done for half of a century, but to instead set cash \nprizes for people able to create the product they wanted. THAT would have \nbeen a more efficient use of resources, if instead private industry were \nthe ONLY entity involved than space would be cheaper anyway as that is \nnecessary in order to fly.\n\nYou repeatedly say that the costs are worth it, but I have found no \nevidence supporting that.
