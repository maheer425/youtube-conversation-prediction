If you want to \nfind a text file (Word, Open office, libra office etc) or a picture, you \nask the harddrive to get it for you. The old harddrive spin when it is \nsearching for that file. That uses power instead of SSD. SSD sends out \nelectrons in a matter of ms (milliseconds). If you cut out that power, you \nlose data. However what he forgot to mention was that flash disk or drive \n(whatever you want to call it) has two gates. The one he spoke about was \nthe \"control gate\". That gate controls the flow of electrons by giving out \nvoltage (power, electricity etc). The other gate is called \"floating gate\". \nThis is where data is stored. This is where non-volatile comes in. \nNon-volatile means \"data that is stored in a chip and does not disappear \neven if the power is cut off\". Those data stays in the floating gate. What \nhe was talking about was transistors in general. \nMore info: \nhttps://howflashdriveworks.wordpress.com/how-does-flash-drive-work/#comment-93",

The problem is that you don't really go into depth about what causes \nthe attraction/repulsion of electrons despite the fact that there's an \nequal number of electrons and protons. If the net charge of the object is \nneutral, then how the hell can current flow?\n\nTurns out the answer is that atoms (NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBATOMIC PARTICLES, \nbut ATOMS), as a whole, tend to attract MORE electrons than what they would \nactually need to match the number of protons they have. This is called the \noctect rule and is what you refer to when you talk about \"holes\". It's very \nvery important not to miss this fact. It's not the charge of the \nnucleus/electrons but the valence shells around the entire atom that drives \neach and every one of the billion transistors in your laptop.\ufeff",
