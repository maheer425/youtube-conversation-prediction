If you're actually racing then the Cayman would offer better \nrollover protection but most Porsches that even see the track are not there \nto race. The Boxster has no weight at all on top, thus it has more grip at \nevery corner. This allows for more options to on selecting the racing line \nthat offers the most grip---> fastest lap. \nThe Cayman is more rigid but contrary to popular misconception it is not a \nnet benefit as the platform was designed not to have a roof from inception. \nWhich is why the GT4 has a bespoke body shell that none of the other \nCaymans have, to reduce the weight on top penalty without sacrificing \nsafety. Additionally the Caymans R and the new GT4 both require a rear \nspoiler to keep up with the Spyders that can be quick with just a duck \ntail. If we in fact see a Spyder GT4 it will be faster than the Cayman GT4 \nif all other things remain equal. If we were talking about Cabriolet where \nthe roof was hacked off like on the 911, then the coupe would be quicker.",
