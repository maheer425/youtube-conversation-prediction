            "text": "I  PET MY CAT,  AND  IT ATTACKS! WHAT'S GOING ON?\nCats are fun, mischievous and they have cattitude. What do I mean by \ncattitude? It\u2019s not just them acting like they are better than you, its \nabout how they express themselves to let you know how they are feeling in \nthe moment. \n\nLoving one second, and then biting or scratching the next can be really \nconfusing for any cat owner. Their attitude  probably leaves you wondering \nwhat did I do to deserve the bite or scratch?\n\nOur family cat Sawyer has always wanted her attention on her terms. I would \nlay down on the bed and she would come over and rub up against my hand and \nthen curl up along the side of me. While I watched television, I would pet \nher and rub her head. Then out of nowhere she would bite my hand very hard. \nOUCH! I would yell and she would slowly saunter away looking back at me \nwhile swishing her tail back and forth. What did I do to deserve that I \nwould say to her as she  would jump off the bed.\n\nWhat I missed while I was watching television were her visual queues \nletting me know that she did not want me to pet her anymore. She gave me \nthe signs through visual signals, but I was not paying attention to them \nand I paid the price with a hard bite on the hand.\n\nWhat are some of the signs you should be looking for that will let you know \nthat your cat has had enough?\n\n\u2022 Fur on the back twitching\n\u2022 Tail beginning to swish side to side. This may be a small movement side \nto side at the tip of the tail and then become a more aggressive movement \nas time goes on.\n\u2022 Whiskers moving back along the face\n\u2022 Ears moving to a back position\n\nWatching for the visual queues your cat makes can prevent an unwanted bite \nor scratch and improve your overall relationship with your cat. Remember, \nIf you are getting cattitude, maybe you didn't see the visual signs of what \nyour cat was trying to tell you.\n\nIn the video below, Jackson Galaxy reviews cat body language and explains \nin more detail what they are saying to you.\ufeff",

(he taught himself watching our dog).  so has wrecked \nour screens on the bottom and trim around the door.  he's always been very \nhealthy. recently, i made him wait to go outside because he just came in \n(he has kept us up and down at times), so i told him to wait a while (i've \nbeen trying to keep him in during the day and out when most neighbors are \nsleeping).  this time, he ran to the litter box. i felt really bad and his \nschedule was moving fine for a few years and now i can't get him back on \nit.  i'm a little afraid to not run  to his beck and call now - am i over \nthinking this?\n\nalso, ignoring dale will get our walls sliced up bad...i really hate \ngetting up at 3/4/5 am, any other suggestions?  i've tried putting him out \n30-60 min before wed, sometimes this works.\n\ni have also been thinking about the electronic collar/invisible fence for \nboth of them.  i would like to know your thoughts on those for cats.  we do \nnot have a way, nor are we allowed to build any fencing of any kind on our \npatio, it's totally open and has to stay that way.  at this point the \nyearling has not been outside at all.  \n\ni also want to know what you think about walking cats on a leash.\n\nhow do you keep a cat from climbing the face of curio cabinets?\n\nhow do you use the horn, sticky tape in places that are super hard or not \nable to set them up in - like the second he would jump on the shelf it \nwould fall with everything else, so it doesn't seem that he would learn \nfrom those devices.\ufeff",

You've probably seen the same thing when your friends come over and \ntry to pet your cat.\n\nLesson: Showing the belly is NOT an invitation for a belly rub, unless your \ncat trust you 110%.
