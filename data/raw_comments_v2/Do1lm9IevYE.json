You can apply the electric field to both wires, \nyes. But that doesn't mean current just instantly starts flowing along the \nentire length of the grounded wire. Rather, you've just sent a pulse \nthrough both wires that pushes charge carriers slightly forward until they \nmove too close to the ones in front of them. Then those charge carriers get \npushed forward, bump into their neighbors, and so on, (and this is how the \npulse travels forward) until the pulse reaches the end. Up until now, there \nhas been no difference in the wires. Only when the pulse reaches the end of \nthe wire can the charge carriers in the grounded wire escape into your \nground. Meanwhile, the pulse in the non-grounded wire terminates and the \nentire wire remains at a non-zero potential. Only then is it really \npossible to tell the difference between the two wires.

The right \nequation is E=\u03b3mc2, where \u03b3 is Lorentz' \nTransformation: \u03b3=1/(sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)). If you expand \u03b3, you will be left \nwith an equation looking like this E^2=m^2*c^4 + p^2c^2. p is momentum! But \nyour question remains, right? If momentum is dependent on mass, then it is \nstill 0! Well, if mass is 0, the the first term (m^2c^4) disappears and we \nare left with E=p*c. Funny thing is, using Planck's formula to calculate \nEnergy: E=h*v, where v is frequency, we do it like so: h*v=p*c (=) \np=(h*v)/c and considering that c=v*\u03bb (where \u03bb is wavelength) 1/\u03bb=v/c, which \nallows us to arrive to the very simple equation p=h/\u03bb.
