This will be fun; my critique!  Okay, first, Julianne, you made a \ntiny step error at the beginning of the routine, but you recovered quickly, \nalthough I have to consider that in my score for this dance.  The routine \nwas awesome, quick and you and the dance team were all in sync, with the \nexception of the time when you were waiting to be picked up by the guys, or \nwhen you were being twirled around and your legs were apart. The timing \nduring that move was too slow, and it was strange & awkward from a viewer's \nperspective.  Derek, you are always amazing, quick and seemed to be in \nperfect timing with your moves and your partner, Julianne. Other than \nnoticeable hesitation from the \"group team dancers,\" Julianne & Derek, you \nare both going to rock the crowds as the amazing, talented dancers that you \nare!  I also did not care for a look of running shorts under the dress, but \nthen again, I have seen some very creative costumes on DWTS, so I am being \npicky. Otherwise....keep moving and God bless you all!  SCORE: 9   :)  \nP.S.  Julianne, you should leave the judge position and join the dancers \nagain on DWTS next season!\ufeff",
