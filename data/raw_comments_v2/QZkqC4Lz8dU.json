They \nfeel rushed and lack in character development. Marvel has a few cool heroes \nlike Cap and the Hulk, but I've always felt like they rip off of DC. \nExamples: Quicksilver is just a slower Flash, and Hawkeye is a rip off of \nGreen Arrow. The X-Men were kinda neat, but to simply blame everyone's \npowers on \"mutations\" feels kinda lazy. I wish Marvel would put together \nsomething more....paced like DC does, and DC would try being a little less \ndark all the time.\ufeff",

DC could do amazing and things if they just \nthought out of the box.\n\nLike make a movie about the Batfam instead of just Batman. Bring in Wonder \nWoman. Make a Green Lantern movie that's actually good. Just shake things \nup a little bit.\n\n\ufeff",
