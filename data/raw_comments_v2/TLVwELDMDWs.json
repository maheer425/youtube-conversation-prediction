So \nyou have let's say 500 characters times 8 bits, the amount of bits for an \nASCII code. The precise numbers are not at all important. So you have maybe \n8*500=4000 bits. How many combinations are there possible? Something along \nthe lines of 4000 factorial. Since 2 factorial is 2 and 15 factorial is \nmany many billions, you can see how fast this grows. If you had a computer \ngenerate every possible combination, every possible string of 1s and 0s in \nthis 4000 bit string, it would take it.... probably multiple times the \nduration of the universe to make all possible combination. Most of those \ncombinations will be gibberish, but some will be coherent. Some might even \nbe this comment I'm writing, or a brilliant piece of poetry etc. \n\nNow, evolution doesn't have multiple times the duration of the universe. \nBut what it does have is millions and millions of years. Natural selection \ncan't produce spectacular things in 1 year, or 2 or a hundred. Well, it can \nfor bacteria and small insects and such, but only because they reproduce \nvery fast. Natural selection does become effective at a ridiculously large \nnumber of generations. This is how it makes sense. Many combinations, but \nalso a lot of time to try them all. ",
