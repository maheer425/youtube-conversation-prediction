Look it up if you don't believe me.  The energy \nfield as described by the force and \"Luminous beings\" is actually the \nresult of Bio-photons. Forms of Kinesis (Special mystical powers) have been \nfound in many religions.  Anybody can do them if instructed properly. There \nare real people that can start fire with there hands.  There are videos on \nyoutube that show you how. For more understanding of Buddhism, my \nfavorite teaching comes from Alan Watts. Kinesis power can be found by \ndoing a extensive online search.
