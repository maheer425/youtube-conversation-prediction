Erin was just \nsticking up for herself and saying yes I may not have a law degree but I'm \nnot dumb like you see here. The other lady was severely rude and implied \nshe was this and that. Erin could have avoided swearing but everything else \nwith the phone numbers and everything else she did in the movie was needed. \nShe just added her pizzazz to it which made it even better. People like me \nwith no self esteem could only dream to stick up for ourselves like that. \nThat's one of the reasons I love this movie. She's badass and she gives me \nhope and strength. She's one I could look up to to be strong when I need to \nbe. She's quite awesome. :)",
