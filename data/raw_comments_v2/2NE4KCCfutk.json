Stay in doors, an infestation of Spencer broodlings \nhas been reported to have landed in Wyoming just a few hours ago.   Money \nstill exists.   There is lots of money in all sorts of places.   Some \npeople have more money than other people.   Oh, someone just got more \nmoney.   Nevermind it's gone now.   Swimming deemed unsafe for anyone in \nany circumstance. Any violators will be stunned on site.   Landon G. has \nrecently successfully discovered a cure for the great Pokemon virus that \nhas been spreading across the globe. It is love and larger Pokeballs. \nLittle did we know, all those guys needed was a little more living space. \nThe Monocles R U just peaked as the highest grossing business loan of \nhistory, never to be beat by any business that has ever existed in the \nlifetime of the Earth, at all. It is not likely that it will ever be beaten \nby anyone for as long as Earth is turning and time is continuing in a \nforward flow of endlessness. Co founder Christian H. says that he has the \ngreat invention of glass to thank for his extreme, unbeatable successes, \nbut is Arch Nemesis Jerome Newsman has something else to say about the \nmatter.\ufeff",
