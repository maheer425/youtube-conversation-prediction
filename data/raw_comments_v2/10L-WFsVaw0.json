It corners so well, it's hard to believe something corners \nbetter, but I guess torque vectoring must. Does the new ST have a different \nsteering rack than the base models? mine does to give high speed accuracy \nbut it makes the turning circle pretty average. Torque steer seem fine on \nmine though it has less power, it certainly does like to wander at high \nspeeds at full throttle.\n\nYou are on second set of tyres already?\n\nmines just going on it's third set (bought 2 khumo ku22's to do highway \nmiles on) seems a waste to wear out pirelli's or re002's on the highway. If \nyou ever get a chance to drive your colleagues ST I'd love to hear a \ncomparison.",

A colleague at work has that, I've \nhad a ride in it (no drive yet) and it's a much 'rawer' car, very \nmechanical - I liked it a lot.\n\nI also have the problem where it cuts power if I'm too aggressive letting \nthe clutch out. It's really embarrassing because it looks like you almost \nstalled ;-) You have to modulate throttle carefully above 3000 rpm - if you \nkeep it pinned, the turbo torque just spins the wheels! Short shifting \nthrough third gear is best for damp days.\n\nTorque steer is present a small amount on very uneven roads, but only if \nyou're really giving it some off the line. I'm very surprised how little \ntorque steer there is with this car.\n\nTramlining with the factory tyres is way more noticeable, the Bridgestone \nsidewalls are so stiff! I currently run Hankook Ventus Evo 2 K120s all \nround and it's a much more supple ride (still jiggly at low speeds, but \nnowhere near as twitchy, still loads of dry and wet grip).\n\nTorque vectoring is AMAZING and has saved me more than once. It doesn't \nfeel artificial - the car just pivots really happily around its centre \npoint and you quickly go from gentle understeer to nailing the corner in a \nlovely arc.\n\nYou can take sharp corners unbelievably quickly, and I'm sure it helps on \nfaster corners (e.g. tightly curved exit and entry ramps onto motorways), I \ncan do them at least 20 mph faster than I think I should be able to with my \nfoot on the gas.\n\nIf I know I need to disappear quick off the line, I always hit the Sport \nbutton. Anything more than 'moderate' departure results in it cutting \nthrottle.\n\nIt's also easy to make the TC light flash just with an 'enthusiastic' shift \nthrough first and second gear, you can get a brief bit of wheel chirp even \nin the dry. To be honest I've begun turning Sport on at every set of \ntraffic lights just to avoid the engine thinking I'm about to spin the \nwheels, it's way too conservative.",

I'm \nassuming they have improved the electronics a lot. Mine has no traction \ncontrol so it's often spinning, can be a bit of a nightmare in the wet in \ncity driving. Problem being if It spins while cornering it harshly cuts \npower to the engine.\n\nSo if you are pulling into a busy road and have to floor it while right \nturning into traffic, it will cut engine power for a second infront of \noncomming vehicles. So after having the stability control nearly kill me \nseveral times I turn it off in city driving.Does the new ST's still have \nany of these issues?\n\nQuite curious about the vectoring also, My ST doesn't have it, does the new \nST have no torque steer because of it?",
