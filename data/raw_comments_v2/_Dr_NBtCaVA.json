Your argument is I'm \npicking on halal and kosher for slaughters animals in a torturous way while \nconscious - originally, you deny evidence of people doing it, now you deny \nit occurs at all. Here is the wikipedia entry on halal and kosher. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Islamic_and_Jewish_dietary_laws#Similarities. \nHere's a news article on the fact it occurs, and with growing and not \nshrinking frequency \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/growth-in-slaughter-of-nonstunned-animals-is-unacceptable-7715790.html. \nHere's halal advocates, a website supporting halal meats. \nhttp://halaladvocates.net/site/our-issues/stunning-animals/ They state \nlittle halal meat exists in north america (which MAY be true as there are \nfar less muslims here then overseas, and I do only notice about 5% of the \nmarket near my location as selling meats labeled halal and kosher - but \nthey back no facts or statistics and everything else I found was court \ncases striking down bannings on non-stunned animal slaughters as being a \nform of religious discrimination). Notice however at the end, where they \nSPECIFICALLY advocate that all muslims try to get all meats killed without \nstunning.\n\nThis is the issue here. You basically closed your eyes and yelled \"No no no \nyou're wrong they do stun animals!\" when it is extremely evident that they \ndo not. The reason I said go see the video is because it shows you how \nhorrible a non-stunned slaughter is (Again, I'm personally against all \nforms of meat eating, but I believe that the worst forms should be banned \nwhile others should be only discouraged). Now. For yet another time. They \nDO keep animals unstunned. What the hell weird defence are you going to \ncome up with next.\n\n2) \"if I can't explain to you why your logic is false then there's no point \nus talking.\"\n\nPlease. Please tell me how my logic that killing an animals while it's \nawake by bleeding it to death isn't a horrible way to kill the animal when \nwe can knock it unconscious right away. Your entire disagreement with me \nwas founded on your uneducated belief that halal meats are stunned - which \nby everything I see from all the laws specifically saying you don't need to \nstun halal meats and the fact that halal certification in most countries is \nonly handed out if the animal is not stunned, makes no sense.\n\n3) \"Just try to lay off the discrimination by repeatedly mentioning halal \nand kosher over other kinds of slaughter,\"\n\nI'm being discriminatory in the same way saying \"Murderers have killed \npeople\" is being discriminatory. Sure, I'm saying everyone who killed \nsomeone has killed someone, lumping everyone who's killed someone with \neveryone else who's killed someone. . . But yeah, it's a factual matter and \nnot a discriminatory matter. I'd be opposed to none-religious people who \nslit their animals' throats while conscious too, as that's my objection to \nhalal and kosher - not the praying over it (which is just insult to injury \nin my opinion). And since matter of fact statements aren't discriminatory, \nI'm therefor not being discriminatory.\n\n4) \"I shouldn't have to repeat myself but they now knock the animals \nunconscious before carrying out the slaughter,\"\n\nActually, you should say it again. Reality needs to beat some sense into \nyou a bit more, because you're obviously delusional on this subject matter.\n\nNow watch you not read anything I said and scream about how I'm the idiot \nagain.",

What statistics? The process of halal and \nkosher slaughters are exactly what the videos show. Every halal and kosher \nshop follows this because that IS halal and kosher.\n\nThis is an emotional appeal you idiot. You're counter argument doesn't make \nsense. This is like you arguing that waterboarding isn't torture even \nthought it's describe as torture, the US has admitted to doing it, and the \nvideos show you how bad it is, because you argue the video doesn't prove \namerica does it - you're missing the point.\n\nWhat's your argument then? That halal ISN'T defined as slicing an animal's \nthroat and letting it slowly die over 5 minutes? That's the definition of \nwhat it is - go see the video to see how disgusting it is and WHY you \nshould be against it.\n\n3) \"STOP USING EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.

Halal's process \nis horrible on paper, you just see how much WORST it is when you see a \nvideo of it. That's the difference here. You're, again, basically arguing \nthat cigs cartons shouldn't have pictures of people who got sick from cigs \non them because that's emotional blackmail. It is. It tells you exactly how \nhard cigs will hurt you - that part isn't made up, it's just you never see \nit.

I wouldn't \nchange my opinion just because a (rightfully) hated person has that opinion.\n\nExplain to me how criticizing something that no-one can really deny is \ntorture (picture for two seconds if someone did this to a human and explain \nto me how that's then not torture) is causing people damage.",
