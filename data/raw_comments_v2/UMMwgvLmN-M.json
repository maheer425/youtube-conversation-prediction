Research indicates that an\nassortment of plant foods eaten over\nthe course of a day can provide all\nessential amino acids and ensure adequate\nnitrogen retention and use in\nhealthy adults; thus, complementary\nproteins do not need to be consumed\nat the same meal (8).\n[...]\nAlthough some vegan women have\nprotein intakes that are marginal,\ntypical protein intakes of lacto-ovovegetarians\nand of vegans appear to\nmeet and exceed requirements (12).\nAthletes can also meet their protein\nneeds on plant-based diets (13).\"\n\n\"In addition, some studies\nshow that the ratio of dietary calcium\nto protein is a better predictor of bone\nhealth than calcium intake alone.\nTypically, this ratio is high in lactoovo-vegetarian\ndiets and favors bone\nhealth, whereas vegans have a ratio\nof calcium to protein that is similar to\nor lower than that of nonvegetarians\n(39). Many vegans may find it is easier\nto meet their calcium needs if calcium-fortified\nfoods or dietary supplements\nare utilized (39).\"\n\n\"High protein intake, especially animal\nprotein, can produce increased\ncalciuria (167,174). Postmenopausal\nwomen with diets high in animal protein\nand low in plant protein revealed\na high rate of bone loss and a greatly\nincreased risk of hip fracture (175).\nAlthough excessive protein intake\nmay compromise bone health, evidence\nexists that low protein intakes\nmay increase the risk of low bone integrity\n(176).\"",
