I know this might \nsound really stupid and might even annoy some hardcore Jevice fans but I \npromised that I would support T-ara forever including any member that left \nthe group. I honestly love Jevice and I've only known of them for a day, I \nwish I knew that Jiae... Sorry, Hana was here earlier. They are both so \ntalented. I know she could have naturally gotten older but, out of \ncuriosity, did Hana have surgery? Not that there's anything wrong, I \nhonestly couldn't care less but she looks so different.  But then again it \nwas many years ago so, it's not necessarily surgery. What are Jevice fans \ncalled? Sorry for making this so long and asking too many questions, I'm \njust so excited and happy to be able to listen to Hana-noona! :3 \ufeff",
