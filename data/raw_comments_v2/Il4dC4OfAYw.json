I mean you dont have bazillion restrictions on stuff . And \nif you do sin there is confession . Just go to church and you erased the \nsin . By a report from a ukrainean nurse that died and revived 3 days after \nshe saw hell , heaven and purgatory . In heaven she saw her father and \nother relatives and atmosphere was nice . She tried to see God but her \nangel turned her head away as noone is allowed to see the face of God . \nPurgatory is dim dark and smelly . its the first circle of hell and sinners \ngo to there to be judged by god . if they sinned a bit and minor sins but \ndid good deeds they go to obviously heaven and if they sinned alot they go \nto hell . Weird thing is that neutrals that didnt sin and didnt do good \ndeeds go to hell also . That makes no sense but ill continue on . In hell \nthere is constantly rock and heavy metal music , demons torture sinners , \nits so hot that your skin dries out , many disturbing things are there . \nThe last circle of hell is in the centre and is by far the worst and the \nmain devil , Lucifer dwells there and does stuff that other devils do and \norders them around . Her aunt was also in hell because she cussed people \nconstantly so she burned to ashes just to reapear and repeat the process . \nYou cant die in neither of places so its really buggy if you are in hell to \nbe tortured forvever . She saw only christians in both of places so there \nis a possibility that afterlife of people is what they believe in . All \nreligions get their own afterlife and even atheism which is not a religion \nbut however they do die so that counts .",

            "text": "+Hussein Haji yes , but the biggest difference is that christian bible has \n2 testaments , the old one which tells about happenings before jesus christ \nand new testament which tells about jesus's life and deeds . Islam and \nJewism dont celebrate Jesus while christians do . He was born by virging \nMary and very little is told about his childhood except his birth and minor \nhappenings . When he grew up he was the teacher to 12 apostles which \nfollowed and listened to him . But was later betrayed by Judas and hanged \non a cross . When he died the was around 3 hours or so of darkness . he was \naccused because he healed a man (he could heal on touch or even ressurect \npeople like in case of Lazarus ) on saturday ( jewish holy day ) and since \nhe was a jew ( christianity didnt exist until he resurrected ) they accused \nhim . 3 days later he ressurected and when he went to his apostles they \nwere all stunned and one of his apostles Thomas thought he was a ghost so \nhe asked to touch him as he did . 50 days later he went to heaven to judge \nwith his father Jehovah . While he is a bit included in jewism he was just \na prophet in their religion . To Jesus and jehovah , human life is the most \nprecious thing on the world and murder is a deadly sin , not in some \ncircumstances , like protecting your land in war or being forced to invade \nanother country , while agreeing to invade a country kills count as sin . \nThis is all catholic information so dont think this is mandatory for all \nreligions . And God is forgiving and jesus died to clear the sins ( in \ncatholic religion ) so confession became an option . Due to similarities in \nreligions I think that just one and only God is involved but was \nrepresenting to people in different names ( Jehovah , Allah ....) and minor \ndifferences that do matter but are not critical . And the big flood was \nmentioned in alot of religions not just cristianity , jewism and islam but \nin one case the saved one was a king rather then Noah so its not a 100% \nchance that it covers the same event .",

Satan (no \none really said that he was disguised as a serpent) didn't directly tell \nAdam and Eve to eat from the tree, but planted the idea into their thoughts \nthat God didn't forbid them to eat the fruit, so they forgot the warning. \nFrom Chapter 20, verses 121-122 in the Quran, Alla narrates, \"Then they \nboth ate of that tree, and so their private parts appeared to them, and \nthey began to stick on themselves the leaves from Paradise for their \ncovering.  Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.  Then his \nLord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness and gave him guidance.\u201d\n\nI don't know how you guys got the story differently. Allah is all seeing \nand all knowing. You can't hide from God by assuming that he's human-like, \nonly can focus on one thing, or he \"rested\" after he created the universe. \nHe is God, the One, the Absolute.

There was a certain tree in Eden God ordered them not \nto eat from , and another tree , the tree of life from which they could eat \nif they wanted too aswell as other tree's . Once a snake (satan in disguise \n) tricked eve to eat an apple from the tree and that she'll get God like \npowers . She did and it was tasty and she showed Adam to eat from it too . \ngod was walking around in Eden and Adam and Eve hid from him because they \ntought he wouldnt see them doing againist his will . After eating from the \ntree they figured out they are naked and made something to cover them up \nfrom leaves . God was angry at them and banished them from Eden and tree of \nlife was forbiden for them to eat . That was the first sin and with it came \nplague , death and all bad things that happen today . And the \" god like \npower \" was sentinence . people figured out how to build , make clothes and \nstuff . In the case of devil , he was fiorst created as an angel , and even \nbecame an archangel along with two other . However he was jealous at God's \npower and turned againist him and managed to turn 1/3 of heaven againist \nGod . He banished Lucifer to hell and while falling in hell he struggled to \npull as many of souls with him . ",
