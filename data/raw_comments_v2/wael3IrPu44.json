The limiter activates in 6th gear. It works by \nsensing the gear and the speed signal from the final drive (countershaft). \nOn the Hayabusa and other Suzuki models, the limiter works by retarding the \ntiming on one cylinder thus capping the power output and any further \nincrease in speed. That occurs at 299 kph or 186 mph indicated speed but \nthe speedos are nearly always optimistic. You can see numerous Youtube \nvideos that show stock superbikes reaching 299 kph on the speedo. On some \nother bike brands the revs seem to continue to rise but I don't know if \nthat means the bike goes beyond the displayed speed. The 1999 Suzuki \nHayabusa was unrestricted. It had 154 hp at the rear wheel. It was timed at \n317  kph (196 mph) to enter the Guinness BoR as the fastest production \nmotorcycle. All subsequent Hayabusa's were restricted to 299 kph, although \ntheir power has increased with each new model. There were some early claims \nthat the 1999 Hayabusa had been clocked at 323 kph (200 mph) but I don't \nknow what conditions that was under (following breeze, cool etc) or if it \nwere GPS recorded. there are many magazines that have tested the Hayabusa's \ntop speed. \nThe latest Hayabusa has 172 whp so it doesn't take a rocket scientist to \nunderstand that a derestricted 2014 Hayabusa with a slight change to the \nfinal drive ration could reach 200 mph under ideal conditions.

Weight produces down force via \ngravity, which increases the frictional load on the tires (I'm sure you \nknow this but these guys seem clueless). \n\nBikes are aerodynamic bricks, relative to their size. While the frontal \narea is small, things like exposed tires, a flat radiator face, etc give \nthem an aerodynamic profile similar to a 3x6 barn door. \n\nIt's funny when the bullshitters, who have no education on such things and \nare painfully ignorant try to argue with people who have some knowledge \nbase in the subject. They have gathered their information from the myths of \nother ignorant people and lack the knowledge to separate fact from fiction. \n\nI had a guy tell me his Gixxer 750 went 180. I showed him tests where it \ntopped at about 167, I explained to him fluid dynamics and frictional \nlosses. I even took the time to explain to him why motorcycle speedometers \nare nothing more than a rough estimate because the tire diameter shrinks \nconsiderably as the tire wears. He didn't care, his speedo, on his well \nworn and flattened tires, read 180 and he was convinced he was right... He \ncouldn't even grasp the day, basic information to why he was wrong...\n\nWhen people are confronted with logic and knowledge, they simply ignore \nwhat is over their head and go into sheeple mode. \n\nOn a side note, why type of Duc do you ride?

I know at least 9 people who have S1000RR, who \nspend most of their time on race tracks, who have at least 5k invested in \naftermarket parts, and they would all agree that Seth doesn't have a clue \nwhat he is talking about. Funny, BMW has sold about 60,000 S1000RRs, which \nmeans there are (according to Seth's logic) 60,000 experts... However \n59,999 disagree with him... lol.. You are also spot on on. No literbike can \npush much past 200, it took about 215 whp to get a ZX-10R (along with a lot \nof areo tricks). It's funny how people who really know this stuff, who live \nit, breath it and ride it can see right through the bullshitters who can \npass their BS over other people. Seth, quite frankly, you are full of shit \nand it is VERY obvious (like you aren't even close) to anybody who rides \ncompetitively. ",
