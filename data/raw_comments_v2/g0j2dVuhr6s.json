But I didn't. if I were a \nracist, I would have come right out and said it. And, if you watch the \nspecial features on the Airplane! DVD, both the Zucker brothers and Barbara \nBillingsley explain how they formulated the Jive dialogue. They both worked \ntogether with the actors that spoke the Jive talk, and it was something \nthey all agreed on. Certainly, if the actors playing the Jive men thought \nthere was anything negative or offensive, they would have said so to the \nZucker brothers, but they didn't. The Jive guys came up with the dialogue \nthemselves, and it was agreed between them and the Zucker brothers that the \ndialogue would be in the movie.",

This country cannot handle this today \nbecause people are too ignorant and have gone too far, so that's what \nhappens when America turns a pleasant environment (like that of the 1980s) \ninto a mean spiteful environment (the Millennium). No , we can count on \nNEVER enjoying that kind of camaraderie, and remember, it took 70 years \njust for folks to earn that right to play like that...by 2001, folks \nBACKWARDS in disrespecting others in reality and then it became WAYYYY too \nracist,violent and shitty and so the \"right\" to play like that was gone. \nYou had to be there anyway, it was a better time all the way around. If \nanyone was born after 1985 you will never, ever, ever understand the entire \natmosphere of the 1980s. People MOSTLY respected one another for who they \nwere and that just isn't happening today. Just look at the YOU TUBE \ncomments across the board. It did not even have anything to do with \n\"political correctness\", it simply had to do with treating others the way \nYOU want to be treated. Too many freaks who want to stir up the shit pot \nagainst others. SO we ALL may as well enjoy it on film (and leave it at \nthat) because those days will NOT be back at all. Count on it. The country \nshould not have gone out of their way to reverse the way things were. No no \none can be trusted any more. Can't say as I blame any one, either. The \nclimate was a better climate in those days for every one and not so damned \nstupid as it is today. People have taken things way too far now and that's \nthat.",
