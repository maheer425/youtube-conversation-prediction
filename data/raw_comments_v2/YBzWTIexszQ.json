Depending on how old she is, this woman might have tens of \nthousands of undeveloped eggs in her body.  I suppose you could imagine a \nfuture technology which would allow all those undeveloped eggs to be \nextracted, matured in a lab and then fertilized.  You could imagine the \ncontroversy over doing this to the only woman in the world who is fertile. \nIf they had that tech, and if they took the risk in using it, they would \nstill need at least some of the wombs of other women on Earth to be \nfunctioning normally, to accept the fertilized eggs and nourish them. If \nthe wombs of other women aren't working, then you'd have to imagine yet \nanother sci-fi technology like an artificial womb to carry the fetuses to \nterm. As far as I remember, there was nothing in the book or the movie \nabout tech like this existing.",

All I see is a ridiculous rant that looks \neerily similar to the type of things you hear coming from meth addicts. \n It's hardly the Christian's fault that the Jews are persecuted, but they \nhaven't exactly followed their own teachings in terms of welcoming the \nstranger, turning the other cheek, et cetera.  It also just baffles me that \nyou keep going back to the diaspora.  \"They must have done something to be \nmassacred at every turn\" sounds a lot like, \"Well, she must have *done \nsomething* to be raped\".  It's victim blaming 101.  When the Romans burned \ndown Jerusalem and they were forced to leave Judea, they took their movable \ngoods and wealth.  Judea was rich in gold and other physical wealth, which \nthen allowed them to set up money lending outfits in the places that they \nsettled.  Seems to me everyone's just butthurt that they did the best with \nwhat they had.  It could be anyone handling the money, but if they're not \nwhite everyone will lose their ever loving shit over it.  The number of \nJews on the Earth is negligible, so if you have a problem, go borrow money \nfrom somewhere else.

There is lots of background story \ninto age category, did you just suddenly think that the youngest people on \nearth would not be celebrated? they're a sign of life, of course they're \ncelebrated. You just decided to start an argument with someone who knows \nmore about this movie, its story, and the novel its based on, then you, \ngoodbye.",
