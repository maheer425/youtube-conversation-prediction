And both Dem and Rep are being \nvery uncooperative and acting like children when placed in situations with \neach other. Obama veto's everything the now Republican congress says, and \nCongress does the same to Obama. It's sad. I believe in what's best for the \ncountry as a whole. One of my biggest issues with Obama is he has more \ncompassion and focus on other countries than he does our own.

But he still better than Biden. Most recently, it's his \narrogance that's drives me up the wall. He wants to take credit for the gas \nprices being down. Not at all his doing. This free college thing. Everyone \nloves that idea and him for it. Also, not his idea or doing. Gov Haslam of \nTN originally introduced and perfected it. Saying he should know because he \nwon both elections at the STOU was a childish thing to say and I don't \nthink it's true. There is too much evidence to back the presumption that \nthe 2012 election was rigged. People worship him like he's the best \npresident we've ever had, when in fact, he's done very little to help this \ncountry and has made us a joke to other countries. He pulled troops out of \nIraq too soon and now terrorists/ISIS are multiplying like rabbits and he \ndoesn't seem concerned at all. Health care is even worse than it was 10 \nyears ago. (Nobody thought that was possible...) He's committed several \nimpeachable acts with no recourse. His wife won't quit screwing with the \nschool lunch system when she gets on her \"health kicks\". The saddest part \nis he refuses to acknowledge he's done anything wrong and continues to be \npraised like he's the messiah.\n\nNow with that said, I'm not Republican, nor Democrat. I am that weird place \nin between  that never gets elected. I also can't say that someone like \nRomney would have been any better in the house than Obama. All I can say \nis, Obama is a screw up and it needs to be acknowledge. We can't run around \ncracking cheesy jokes and playing golf and pretend as if everything is fine \nand he's done a good job. Now bring on the blind Obama worshipers! Ya'll \nare worse than Beliebers!",
