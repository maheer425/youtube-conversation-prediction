It gives the car the \npower to match its looks, and goes faster than say a Golf GTI now.\n\n+ Even better fuel consumption than standard while cruising.\n\n+ Harder/snortier engine note.\n\n\nCons:\n- The extra pressure created caused several air leaks in the turbo piping \n(my car was only 4 years old with 60k miles) and more than a \u00a31000 pounds \nlater trying to get it fixed at various garages.. a leak still pops up \nsomewhere after a few days.  The leaking air causes power losses and car \njerks under acceleration.  I'm depressed and have given up trying to fix \nit, I just don't accelerate the car hard many more.  And no one wants to \nbuy it now.\n\n- The Revo remap only runs on RON 98+ Super Unleaded fuel.\n\n- Black smoke through exhaust.\n\n\nCONCLUSION: Just buy a fucking BMW 330i or M3!\ufeff",

            "text": "I love this episode, I follow this channel and it is the first car channel \nthat takes a look at aftermarket mods.  I currently have a flashed mk4 1.8t \nwith 150k miles on it and it is still to this day is plenty quick because \nof a REVO flash/software.  With that being said, I have your next episode! \nand would love to see this brought to forwishen, come to think of it \nactually it would be a two part episode, and because of this involving \nREVO, they may possibly help sponser/jump aboard for this episode.  I would \nalso like to see this episode because I'm a recent graduate of a masters \nprogram and will be looking for a new car in the sometime near future (so \nhopefully I will be able to afford cars in this price range). I currently \ndrive a GTI 337 model with revo flash, mk4 r32  interior, wheels and koni \nsuspension.  Always been a fan of the GTI and enjoy tuning them because you \nmake them very fast cars at a very affordable price. Or here's the kicker, \nI've always loved the VW R models especially the R32 3.2 L V-6 but have \nnever owned one, hich are become collector items but  at 240hp need a \nmassive turbo upgrade to hang with todays current sport cars. As the new \n2015 VW golf R is going to be in the same price range and have the same MQB \nchassis as the new Audi S-4 I would love to see those two vehicles compared \nstock, and then compared after both have had a revo software upgrade. I \nthink would make for an exciting episode as well as see what these \naftermarket companies are doing. You can compare both vehicles with either \ntheir six speed manual or DSG transmissions, doesn't matter to me. but \npersonally I will say I'm getting a little tired of how Volkswagen has \nstuck with his 2.0 16 valve turbo since 2008 and am missing how it \nfeels/sounds to have a little bit more displacement, so I had been leaning \ntowards the S4 V6T ?! If neither car suits me just have to buy something \nand  build it myself as I've done in the past (my first car was a VW MK2 \n with a 2.9 L the 12v V6 engine)  or by piece of crap and hold out for an \nold-school Porsche 911 or BMW E30 ; ) 0h well!! enjoy your channel and \nChris you have a dream job! take care and thanks...\ufeff",
