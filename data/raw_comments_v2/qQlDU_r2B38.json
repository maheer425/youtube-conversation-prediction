He \nusually will take the oldest dog (10+ years old) for walk first, because it \nneeds to walk slowly, then one day when he was walking with his oldest dog, \nan unleashed, violent dog running from its owner and run around the old \ndog, barking crazily and it seems like it wants to attack the old dog. \nSoon, my dad's friend scold at the owner to mind his dog, but the owner \njust ignored him and said \"this is my dog, I will do what I want to do. You \ndon't have any say on it\". My dad's friend was so angry that he brought the \nold dog back to the house and came out walking with his pit bull (according \nto my dad, as I don't have much knowledge about dogs, they are an American \nbreed and they are fighting dogs, very good at combating). Again, the \nviolent dog run and bark crazily at the pit bull, its owner still ignoring. \nThe pit bull sat there doing nothing for a while when that violent dog was \nrunning around it, then suddenly, the pit bull attacked that dog in a very \nfast speed and that dog finally stopped and whining, and the owner was \nyelling to my dad's friend to mind his dog. He said \"this is my dog and I \nwill do what I want to do. And I'm just doing what you have done.\" The \nowner had nothing to say and left, simply because he had his ass kicked!\ufeff",

That means theyre desperate to get animals out of the \nstore enough to knowingly give a living creature to a family that probably \ncant afford living costs for said animal.
