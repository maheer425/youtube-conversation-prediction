Science gives overwhelming evidence for God such as the \nfact that the universe had a beginning and is not eternal as it was once \nthought which means that it requires a sufficient cause to bring it into \nexistence. In fact, we now know that matter, time, and space began at the \nbig bang which means that the cause is immaterial, eternal, and \ntranscendent, a God. Also, the extreme fine-tuning of the fundamental \nconstants of the universe are also irrefutable evidence. How fine-tuned? \nTake for example the cosmological constant. If it would have been faster by \njust 1 in 10^122, the universe would have expanded too fast at the \nbeginning of the expansion and would have collapsed back onto itself, if it \nwas slower by 1 in 10^122, the universe would have expanded too slow to \never formed galaxies, stars, and planets. To put that number into \nperspective, imagine a blind man and ALL the atoms in the entire observable \nuniverse. One atom represents the right cosmological constants, the blind \nman would have to pick that atom among the trillions and trillions and \ntrillions of atoms. There are about 10 more of these constants that are on \na knife-edge to allow order and complexity in the universe.  \n\nMore evidence is the digital code in DNA. The chemical bases in DNA that \ncode for functional proteins are running just like zeros and ones in a \ncomputer program or alphabetic characters in a written language. When you \nsee a message written in the sand beach, you wouldn't invoke the ocean ties \nto explain it would you?

All precisely arranged in meaningful and precise \nsequence.

For the starters, it's a philosophical \nargument which is in contradiction with itself, the Principle of \nfalsifiability is itself non-falsifiable. Although philosophers deal with \nsuch a things on a daily basis, in science such self-contradictory \nstatements are paradoxes at best which should be carefully used, avoiding \nthe sloppy like one I can see here.\nYou are only partly correct. Multiverse is an idea and there are different \ninstances where it is invoked. Bubble universes, super-horizon Multiverse, \nMultiverse of string landscape are either different regions of (extended) \nspace-time, which can interact but their interaction scale is currently \ninaccessible to us. But in principle, they make falsifiable claims. Can we \never test it? No one knows. There are some hopes that it might have left \nimprints on CMB, that's what we are currently doing right now.\nThere are some models of multiverse such as parallel universes of Quantum \nmechanics, which do not interact by their definition, hence \nnon-falsifiable. But don't assume you got it right.

If one is going to go down from our \ncomfortable \u2018place\u2019 in scale to the Plank limit(s)or also up from our \ncomfortable scale to the same size limit (as we went down to the Plank \nlimit); then why the problem? We call the Plank limit the boundary where \nall measurements break down and become meaningless\u2014if we (scientists) can \nsay that going \u2018down\u2019 in scale is OK, then too what not \u2018up\u2019 in scale? \nScience is supposed to be testable and falsifiable\u2014I do not see this as \npossible (with multiverse talk). So then we need to rename the \u2018talk\u2019 as \nphilosophical meta-physics--a belief, like too is religion. We can \nwonder\u2026just like many religious folks also wonder (in awe) of just what in \nthe heck is going on and what we are?      \nOne point science seems to know is that what we are and what is in our \nreality is\u2026it is all energy.  Matter is energy; matter is \u2018frozen\u2019 energy; \njust as ice is frozen water (an attempt to analogize by common \nunderstanding).   We walk around not realizing how absolutely strange this \nsituation is (that we are in). Once more if ya can blow off that strange \nconcept then how is it that \u2018we\u2019 (as an individual) have conscious \nunderstanding of ideas such as fairness, numbers, perfection, love, and \ntime etc etc etc (all the abstract thoughts are not \u2018solid\u2019 matter \ndefinitions and so cannot be defined by science).  We do not seem to be \njust biological bugs\u2014meat robots, but rather conscious observers and moral \nagents\u2014this is weird! To deal with the understanding of infinite regress \n(to multiple universes) such knowledge leaves our infinite understanding \nbrain. We have a brain that can understand those \u2018things\u2019 that seem \ninfinite but that we struggle to rationalize as such. We want a situation \nwhere what begins has an end.  That could be because we see too much of \nthat around us\u2014at our comfortable scale\u2026that begins and then ends.  Put \nthis into google \u201cscale of the universe\u201d load the program and move the \nslider to grasp the scales down and also up. Although the depth of the \nscales boggles the mind; the scale, itself, had a beginning and has an \nend\u2014and you can understand it. If ya dig into the quantum world then you \nmight conjure there is an infinite set of universes but then if one can \ndefine a set of universes does that make it infinite? Isn\u2019t infinite (by \nits own definition), undefinable; immeasurable? But what about the \nknowledge of it; of any\u2019thing\u2019 or pattern or symmetry? \n                       \nWe know there was a beginning to matter but we do not know what was, \n\u201cbefore the beginning\u201d (sounds a bit like an oxymoron). But that\u2019s not \ntotally correct\u2026we do know something about what was around before the \nbeginning\u2026we know that matter was NOT around before the beginning, and \nneither was space or time. What is left? ANS:  Is it nothing\u2026that is left?  \nANS: What about information; Code; Intelligence? If there was order written \ninto the energy to code it into form (like life is coded into design by \nDNA) then that intelligence could be linked in some manner to what it is we \nare (and how it is that we can think\u2026and conjure up some strange odd and \nabstract thoughts and then garner from our testing the basis of scientific \nthought?).  One thing could be certain, if there is any credence to this \nidea then if it is true and we could discover and communicate with such \nenergy then to call it deity would not sound weird or unreasonable (we like \nto be\u2026reasonable).  I don\u2019t want to necessarily wiggle religion into the \ncracks that our education endures, but darn it something that is not a \nthing is going on and whatever it is, it is beyond the science aspect (or \neducation) for science deals only with the material (matter) of reality\u2026but \nwhat is going on here has gone past that, and up in scale or down in scale \nto the edge of the understanding that our brain seems able to deal with and \ndesires to have knowledge of.              \ufeff",

As odd as this might sound, it is the \"fabric of space \ntime that is expanding faster (or at) the speed of light\". Speed is \nrelative! and so if the 'fabric' is moving faster than the speed of light \nthen relatively those 'things' in that fabric are not moving faster than \nthe speed of light. Example: if you are standing on a flatbed-car of a \ntrain and (let's say the train flatcar is moving at the speed of \nlight--that it represents the fabric of the universe) and then you run from \nthe end of the flatbed to the front of the flatbed...in this case you do \nNOT add the speeds of the flatbed (train/fabric) to your own running speed \nto figure out your total speed. Why not? because motion is relative as \nEinstein's formula states of General and Special Relativity states. So \nalthough we are being carried through space by an accelerating fabric or \nspace/time we are NOT moving in that fabric faster than the speed of \nlight.  This is also happening when you move...even the simplest times \nthroughout your day it is just that we move in such a small amount of the \npercentage of light speed that we do not cognitively comprehend this. And \nso in our 'world' we add speeds to get a total speed...but get close to the \nspeed of light and instead of increasing in speed, time slows down and \ndilates and space warps and lengths of 'things' shorten...AND I believe \nthat somewhere in all this (high speed) matter has to revert back to \nenergy!  \n\nThere is also the problem of dark matter, that in this, case helps. Dark \nMatter is known to exists because of the great rotational speed of galaxies \nat their outer edges. The speed is too fast...if there were no dark matter \nto hold the galaxies together then the outer 'objects' would fly away from \nthe great rotational energy they have. Instead something holds them AND \nthen the whole unit (the galaxy) moves at an accelerating speed!  \nGlue paper dots from a paper punch to a stretchy rubber sheet, then pull \nthe rubber apart from two opposites ends with EVEN speed. notice that the \ndots move, but the dots themselves do not stretch, ONLY the spaces between \nthe dots stretches. Also notice that if you focus your eyes on only one dot \nthen all the other dots look to be moving away from it...faster and faster; \nthen focus your eyes on another dot and re-stretch the sheet and then that \ndot will look like IT is the center and all the other dots including the \nfirst one are moving away...and the dots that are furthest away look to be \nmoving even faster than the closest dots...the dots seem to be accelerating \nfaster and faster away from the dot you see to be the center...the dots \nfurthest out are moving faster than the dots closest in!  Making the fabric \nlook to be accelerating even though when you pull on the rubber sheet \nevenly you are NOT accelerating the pull!!!  This analogy according to some \nis fraught with some problems just like also the idea of redshift is \nanalogized to be like the Doppler shift but there is really a bit more \ngoing on...even so, the analogies seem to help...until some-thing better \ncomes along.

Or just modify or \nexisting definitions, which maybe easier.  I would change universe to mean \neverything within our space-time causation.  The difference between other \nuniverses, they don't appear to effect our space-time causation or detach \nfrom our space-time causation.\nI'm coming under the idea based on holographic universe idea-essentially \npoints to 3 dimensional space-time arising from a 2 dimensional \nsingularity, we're on a singularity which has moment to breed its own \nspace-time- we decouple from reference frame of the singularity's time \noutside its locality. To it, we're imaginary time, and to us its imaginary \ntime unit.  To me, the idea makes sense of how the Higg's field is \neverywhere throughout the our universe and has a value consistent with more \nthan 0, unlike other fields like EM field which has a 0 value until a \nparticle excites the field. Singularity we're on is allow our temporal \nprojection to have energy to excite the Higg's field-- is the only \numbilical cord that has any effect on our universe from the singularity. As \nwell as making sense to why space appears to be flat, essentially space is \n2 Dimensional-- field energy is causing a projection that expands space 3 \ndimensions.  And it fits observation that the expansion of the universe \nhappened everywhere-- if we're on a singularity, the emergence of our space \ntime would have to be everywhere.  \ufeff",
