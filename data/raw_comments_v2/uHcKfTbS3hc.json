However, the 2015 has an MSRP starting \nat $32k-$36k depending if it is a Premium or Standard. I'd imagine if a \nSupra were sold today it would probably MSRP around $88-92k.\n\nI'm just pointing this out because it's good to consider how the car \ncompares to today's new car market to have a perspective how expensive a \n$50k car actually was in 1995. It had to compete with the likes of the \nCorvette ZR1 that had 405hp and only cost $36k.
