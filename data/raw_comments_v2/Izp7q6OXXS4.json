But I'll admit that humanoid depictions of aliens always annoy me, \ntoo. It's also true that aliens in movies often all too easily adapt to \nEarth conditions such as lighting, gravity chemical composition of the \natmosphere etc.\n\n2. Indeed, many animals are not territorial and aggressive and I sure many \nalien race aren't, either. But I'm also sure some are, and I guess there is \nthe chance that we meet that kind first. It does make for better movies.\n\n3. The cat analogy is a common misconception. Yes, cats mark you with their \nscent and the evolutionary explanation is so that other cats know that they \nare expected to stay away. But that's not necessarily their *personal, \npsychological* reason. They don't rationalize the benefits of owning \nterritory or humans or other cats. They just follow their instincts, and \nthe instinct they follow when doing it with humans or other cats may well \nbe affection. Just like with us, cat affection is an evolutionary tool.\ufeff",

You \nare trying to project a human logic of reasoning for a species that is \nlikely to be exponentially more intelligent than we are. \"Chimpanzee and \nHuman DNA are 98% alike. That 2% mainly accounts for the differences in the \nway we look and partially in the differences of our intelligence. If we met \nan alien species that had a difference of DNA of just 2% that accounted for \njust intelligence, those aliens would look at us like we are chimpanzees, \nif not even lower.\" -Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Cosmos. Chimpanzees could not \ndefend against a attack/war by humans, we are substantially more advanced \nand not only that, but they couldn't predict every thing we do. We wouldn't \nhave to study chimpanzees to eradicate them. Just like the aliens Michio \nKaku is talking about wouldn't have to study us, to destroy us. Plus the \nfact remains, we have never found another intelligent form of life in our \nuniverse. We have even found other inhabitable planets, but have no other \nintelligent life, and it's likely we wont even be able to travel to these \nplanets for a while. If Aliens had the capacity for knowledge over us to \nyield the technology to reach our planet, that in itself should be enough \nto understand that they could have the capacity to see the future. \nMathematics is literally the ability to predict and theirs would be \ninconceivably more advanced.",

So coming to attack a \nspecies that has done mass murders and mass suicides to avoid murder also \nwilling to destroy their own habitats/living locations just to push the \ninevitable further, would be an entirely new thing for them.

It is so \nobvious and maybe that is why no one seems to notice it, yet it is always \nhere. Only when the mind interprets this now, it divides it up into past, \npresent and future.

The 'past' only \nexists in my head as thought and so does the 'future'. Just because almost \nthe entire human population believes that the 'past' is a real thing and \nthe 'future' will arrive someday, doesn't make it less ridiculous.\"\n\nTime is found in space. Or rather, it is found in the relation of one \nmoving object in space compared to another moving object in space. Time, \nthen is a function of space, and not a dimension in the way of dimensions \nas we normally think about them (trajectories of movement within Space, ie \n3D Space).\n\nThat time exists as such is easy to establish. Simply observe an object \nmove from 'A' to 'B', measure the distance travelled, then calculate the \nspeed of the object by comparing the distance with how long it took the \nobject to travel it. And thus one can imagine time being stopped locally \nwithin a black hole, or in regions of space where temperatures equals \nabsolute zero. In these Places there are no movement, and so there are no \n(internal) time. There is still outside-time, obviously, as time is \na general function of the universe in it's entirety. \n\nYour argument is valid, since it touches on the notion that time \nshould have dimensional properties - ie the fourth dimension - and it does \nnot. As you very correctly point out to other posters in this thread, one \ncannot travel in time except by virtue of the mind (remembering past and \nprojecting future). But your argument is also very much philosofical, since \nyou also write off the very real nature of time as being the way to \naccurately express the speed of movement. The notion of past, present and \nfuture (beyond their applications within natural science as reduced, \nsimplified events) are firmly lodged in philosofy.\n\nSo, to sum up, time is an integral, defining function of space. Arguing \nthat time-epochs does not exists as actual 'places' is only valid inside a \nphilosophical discussion.

To prevent this, the group would need to apply \nsome sort of \"resource violence\", purposefully starving the individual. \nThis is similar to how we use violence to apprehend criminals. They would \nsimply create a system of resource trade and resource law, exactly as we \nhave.\n\nAs for the speculated life, it was a long time ago when I've heard it, so \nfinding a link would be difficult. I can mostly give you details. It was \nafter some non-Earth-like planet was discovered somewhere, and it was \nspeculated that despite being non-Earth-like it could still sustain an \natmosphere, and hence, life.\nHere are the basic environmental details: The planet has some sort of \nrotational lock, so that one half is permanently frozen, while the other \nhalf is constantly exposed to the sun. At the center of this exposed area \nis a never-ending tornado. I don't quite remember what causes this tornado \nto exist. Something about the planetary rotation? Or the radiation? Not \nsure.\nAnyway, the planet lacks some ozone layer, or some other protective field, \nso solar flares hit it with extreme radiation that could kill land animals. \nIt was speculated that there would still be sea animals, and amphibious \nanimals. Also, there would be plants with large canopies at the top, \ncapable of swaying around, sort of like water lilies or something, so as to \ntrap as much radiation as possible when it arrives. And finally, it was \nsuggested that there could be a carnivore which, in addition to the normal \nfacilities, has a large eye on the top of the head or body used to detect \nincoming solar flares. Upon detecting such, the creature would head for \ncover, in a cave or under a tree, to protect itself from the radiation.\n\nThis is as much as I can remember. Maybe if you look up some of the \ndetails, you can find a more complete article on the internet.

This planet has 3 sun ( each in a very specific orbit and \ndistance ) which makes for very interesting seasons, and there is only 2 \nhour of night time for 52 hour of day time.\n\nThese conditions are very different from our own planet earth, and so the \nplants, in order to survive, as most other species on this alien planet, \nevolved to withstand huge amounts of radiation/uv and climate changes. \n\nWith continuous amount of light and uv, mutations and growth were \ninevitable. These plants could take Co2 from the air, isolate the carbon \nand rearrange them in a very specific way to make a shell as strong as \ndiamond. So they were not prey anymore, in order to survive and dominate \ntheir surrounding they did not need to kill other species, they were \nstronger than any other herbivore who would want to eat them, needless to \nsay they were not concerned about predators.\n\n\nMillions and millions of years passed, most of the species that walked the \nsurface of the planet were no more. Because you see, it is a very \nunforgiving planet, with its extreme amount of radiation due to 3 suns, its \nvolcanic eruptions, and solar storms capable of burning alive any creature \nand plant on the surface once every few million years, boiling down the \noceans. Only our little species with its shell hard as diamond and its \nmetabolism craving for radiation and uv could survive this long in these \nharsh conditions.You could almost say these plants were meant to live in \nhell.\n\nThey saw 7 extinction, and survived them all, they were left alone in the \nplanet. \"The chosen species to survive.\" With all other plants and animals \ngone, they were able to spread through the surface of the planet.\nThese plants need very specific minerals all around the world in order to \nlive but their root can not be everywhere, so they evolved to take of their \nroot and walk far away distances ( very slowly ) those who could not take \naway their root were doomed because it is not radiation or volcanoes that \nkilled them, it was hunger.\n\n\nIn order to survive, these moving plants shared their minerals, water, life \nstock. They lived in some kind of plant harmony if you want. Even if from \ntime to time some violent mutation occurred, they did not survive because \nit was not \"each for his own\" as on earth, they needed one and other in \norder to survive, if they were not helpful to each other they could not \nlive, so only the pacific genes remained. Also they were always strong and \nindestructible by other species, and they did not need their meat or \nanything, they just wanted to live, live and grow as long as possible.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about a life form like this ? Tl;dr : Their consciousness \nwill be very very different from humans or any other animal we know. They \ndid not need to be smart and predator-like to evolve but they did evolve \nnonetheless because of extreme mutations due to radiation and they evolved \nto be \"good\" and not territorial and aggressive because in order to survive \nthey needed to be helpful to each other or else their species would have \ndied.",

One such mutation may have a \"violent \ngene\". And without some force to prune out such a mutation, it is likely \nto, instead, prune out the more benign specimen of the same species.\n\nThe benign version must therefore have some method of self-protection from \nsuch mutant versions of itself in order to survive long enough to create \nspace flight and reach our planet.\nWhile having a tough enough head to survive the age-old rock-to-the-head \nmay work initially, it's a lot easier to find a bigger rock than to evolve \nan even tougher head.

However, I was talking in \nbroader terms, like, why we are territorial.\n\nThese behavioral patterns have appeared and reappeared before and after \nmass extinction events, in practically all genus. And the simple reason for \nthat is that they are not motivated by any specific environment or genetic \npath. They are required for practically any type of creature to exist in \nany universe.\n\nAs noted above, the only practical way to avoid the need for violence, and \nthe engrained violent instinct that would result from such a need, is to \nout-reproduce any external threats. In a way, this is similar to how flies \nwork on our planet. Due to their high reproduction rate, they don't have a \nneed to attack other creatures or protect their territory.\n\nYou offer a similar suggestion in the form of immortality. However, that \nsolution is not workable. It suggests the existence of a truly \nindestructible creature. And that requires the physical impossibility of a \ntruly indestructible object. Even diamonds can be cut, and even black holes \neventually dissipate. Nothing in this universe is completely immune to \ndamage. Entropy always wins.\n\nYour second suggestion, a super-intelligent race, does not preclude violent \nbehavior. Sure, thanks to our technological advancement, we live a life of \nluxury, without daily struggle against the elements. But this was achieved \nby trampling the environment around us beyond recognition. These \nsuper-intelligent creatures would necessarily need to, and will, use their \nsuper-intelligence for purposes that do not involve being at harmony with \ntheir surroundings.\nSure, they can eventually become so advanced, that very little in the \nuniverse is an actual threat to them (Except, perhaps, others of their own \nspecies). But by then they will have spent generations upon generations \nremoving everything that did threaten them. And that sort of instinct \ndoesn't just up and poof one day. Evolution has a sense of inertia. Those \ndestructive instincts would remain.\n\nOne possible alternative is actually the non-natural one: A benevolent race \nthat was engineered by a superior non-benevolent one. It's not entirely \nfarfetched for members of a violent species to prefer engineering a \nnon-violent one which would not threaten them.

While there may be a chance that all of those people \nwill live very happy lives, extinction would arrive within a generation. \nThey may prefer it, but nature would not, as they are expelled in favor of \nspecies that focus on survival and reproduction instead.\n\nOf course, if you believe race continuity is a higher value, you may \ninstead opt to optimize reproduction beyond what our instincts dictate, and \nconsider this to be \"enlightenment\", from a point of view. On some level, \nthis is a sacrifice of individual happiness in favor of, shall we call it, \n\"the greater good\".\nBy contrast, the view that it's okay for the species to become extinct so \nthat you can live a full happy life is equally valid, just not maintainable \non a grander scale (Since you deny any potential descendants the same \nopportunity, and this \"way of life\" would disappear along with you and your \nspecies).\n\nMyself, personally, would pick the 1000 years, but only because that's part \nof my, shall we call it, \"faith\". Or perhaps a better word is \"ideology\". \nUnless that misery comes from tolerating an undesirable, in which case I \nwould pick removing the undesirable even at the potential cost of life. But \nthat's just my personal way of life, which I would not so much as recommend \nto others.",

            "text": "+Saar Korren The problem with text, chat, youtube comment, etc. is that you \ncan't tell the tone of the person. You misunderstood when I said \nreproduction can override survival. I was pointing out the PROBLEM that \npart of our flawed construction as humans is that we are biologically \ndriven to reproduce with more urgency than to take care of necessities. We \ngenerally don't succumb to this completely but unwanted pregnancies and \nSTDs are far too common. As for my ending being wrong, are you saying \nquantity is better than quality? If so, how would you like to live 1000 \nmiserable years or 100 happy years?",

            "text": "+Jeremy Booth\nYour initial premise is so right, that it almost literally (almost) hurts \nme that your conclusion is so wrong. Especially since you had successfully \nproven me wrong.\n\nI'll admit I hadn't considered this possibility. A species can survive and \neven thrive without having to resort to violence, simply by out-reproducing \nany external harmful force. I don't know if this is what the people above \nwould call \"enlightened\" but it's a workable solution: A species completely \ndevoid of violent instincts, yet focused on reproducing, and, by proxy, to \npositive interaction with others.\n\nThe down side is that such a species would actually be WORSE for us than \nthe violent conqueror. Arriving in massive amounts, they would act like \nlocust, bringing a message of peace, while, at the same time, consuming our \nresources at a rapid rate. While attempts to eliminate them would be met \nwith little to no resistance, they would remain futile, as their sheer \nnumbers would be simply unmanageable. And, when they arrive on our planet \nthey would be interested in only two things: Testing the possibility of \ncoupling with members of our species, and attempting to get resources, \nhaving exhausted those of their own home planet, and every other planet in \ntheir path.\n\nAnd the best part of it is, we'll be the ones who look like the evil \nviolent race, when we try to do some \"population control\" on the incoming \npeaceful horde.",

            "text": "+Saar Korren An unfortunate thing that a lot of science-minded and \nreligious people do is view life from a closed-case perspective. One thing \nabout being alive is understanding that your body is essentially \"using\" \nyou and your consciousness to achieve its simple goals; survival and \nreproduction. Considering that you could produce a virtually unlimited \nnumber of offspring, your drive to reproduce can override you drive to \nsurvive. Your drive to survive can override your drive to be happy. Since \nwe know that we are held hostage by our flesh and that we all experience a \nvivid life and can feel great pain or pleasure it can make for a much \nbetter present life to treat love as the top priority. If you try to live \nwith the constant idea that you and your species are damned if you fail to \nsurvive best, you will live in a state of fear and strife. That's just \nwrong to do to yourself not to mention the other people you effect. And \n\"wrong\" is a valid notion if you keep your perspective at \"eye-level\" and \nnot try to think beyond your means. If you truly care for the future of \nyour species you will consider the QUALITY of their life not QUANTITY.",

It happens via nature \"trying\" a whole bunch \nof random possibilities, then \"keeping\" the ones that work. Even if, at \nsome point, a race is alone on its planet, its own members would be subject \nto mutation, which is one of the driving forces behind evolution. In other \nwords, it would naturally spawn subspecies. If a \"violent\" gene appears in \njust a handful of specimen, if the original species has no means of \nopposing violent individuals, it would cause it to be exterminated by the \nfew errants.\nAt the very least, in order to survive, the species must have a way of at \nleast dealing with violence, so that it doesn't become an extinction event \nthe moment they encounter a violent person.",
