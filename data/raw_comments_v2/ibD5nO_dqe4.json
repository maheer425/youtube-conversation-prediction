That is how a lot of their complaints go. If you know \nanything about feminism you know that. Second thing I want to say is that \nall of them are fucking hypocrites. Coming from the same people who say \nthat women shouldn't be generalize you hear \"Oh yeah right! There's no way \n18% of men don't masturbate\" and \"Well this means that 18% of men are \nfucking liars!!\" This bothers me because the men are basically saying \"Oh \nhell naw!!! I'm weak and can't control myself so I know that you're the \nsame way!! I'm a chronic masturbator so I know every man must be chronic \nmasturbators. And for the women to think this way is even worst IMO because \nthey act like the know what the urge is like. They talk like they are men. \nAlso you hear a lot of women saying \"eww\" to masturbation, so this means \nthat they think that all men are disgusting. Buzzfeed feminists are the \nbiggest hypocrites. When I was a sophomore in high school, there was a girl \nwho I made some sort of deal with. I forgot what it was, but when I reached \nout to shake on the deal she told me \"oh no. I don't shake guys' hands \nbecause at this moment in life they masturbate.\" I'm chuckled and said \"no. \nI don't do that shit.\" Then she argued with me up and down just saying \nthings like \"why don't you just admit it. I KNOW you're lying.\" The key \nword being \"know.\" She was sexist because she just treat men this way as if \nwomen can't masturbate, and because she generalized the entire male gender. \nJust as Buzzfeed did. I can't be the only one who notices this.\ufeff",
