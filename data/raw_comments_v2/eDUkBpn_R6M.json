They all got \ncranked up with smog and safety regs, and none of them were better for it. \n But that's not Datsun's fault.  The world was becoming a smog shitehole, \nand the smog regs were needed.  Personally I think the extra weight of the \n5mph bumpers on all cars was a much greater sin, perpetrated by insurance \ncompanies to allegedly reduce parking lot trauma back to the consumer and \ntheir deductible.  If you bother to look 1970 had light, split bumpers on a \nlot of cars, which was super clean and didn't carry much weight.  But by \n1975, everything was changing in a way that destroyed many clean designs. \n This weight as an asset would become a problem in years to come, as the \nIIHS would reward a generation of heavy SUVs and cagified sedans better \nratings while ignoring the fact that the heavier vehicles became a greater \nliability to the safety of light cars.",

Get over yourselves, and stop being \ndicks.  \n\nAnyway...\n\nTwo similar cars taken in very different directions, one is more focused on \naesthetics and the other almost entirely on performance.  \n\nVery much like the interior of the sons, with the custom quilted door \npanels, similar to original but nicer transmission tunnel quilt, and \ntasteful touches throughout.  Need those cracks on the dash repaired \nthough, heh!  Also like the mirrors on it, different, but not too \ndifferent.  I don't recognise that front air dam, anyone know who makes it? \n Nice deep dish mesh wheels on it too!   \n\nWould have been nice to hear, or even see, more of what the father has done \nto his Ratsun.  He mentions almost everything being new under the skin, so \nit would have been interesting to see how far he has taken it.  I obviously \nsaw the triple Webers, which is always a worthwhile and intoxicating \nupgrade.  Nice, wide, Watanabe wheels with R888's tucked under ZG arches, \nvery nice.  Wanted to see more though, instead of artistic close-ups that \nshow almost nothing.  Interesting car, but this was just a tease...\n\nPetrolicious:  Making this video 2 minutes longer and having some of the \nusual exterior parked shots would have been nice.  \ufeff",
