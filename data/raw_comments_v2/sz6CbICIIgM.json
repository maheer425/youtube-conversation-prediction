That said, I suppose looking back my \nbiggest beef is that knowing their limitations in the materials.

It feels to me the limitations were \nknown and someone on high with less knowledge about the situation said. \n\"Fuck it, smash some stuff.\"\n\nAlso, it weighed in around 34 pounds, with solid chunks of metal, I'd wager \nthat if the molds were carved out from behind somewhat, and put into a full \ncast as opposed to the corners they were, it would be significantly \nlighter. And while yes, bronze is more likely the easiest thing to cast out \nof, but other tougher metals like iron or steel do exist, that would have \nfar less of a problem bending over, even with reduced materials.\n\nNot saying in a million years this thing could be made to historical or any \nrealistic standards.

HEMA practitioners will mostly agree that \nanything above eight pounds is just too heavy and unwieldy, even for \narmor-piercing weapons. \n\nOn to making me repeat myself - they had to use bronze, because you cannot \nhammer steel into such shapes that the mace of Molag Bal has. Unless, of \ncourse, you want to try. You can, however, cast bronze into a mould as they \ndid and it will not be shitty. Bronze does not get nearly the same work \nhardening benefits that steel does, but it is much easier to make bronze \ntools as you just melt the bronze and pour it into a mould instead of \nhammering it. \n\nTHAT is why they used bronze. There were no other viable options.",
