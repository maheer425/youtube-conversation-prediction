That means, in addition to minority rule, 60% of \neveryone else's votes have been, for all intents and purposes, rendered \nmoot, negated. They get *no* say at all, so why bother to vote? \n\nEven if you support A, your vote is still wasted, and here's why: \n\nLet's suppose that all four parties run, and we have a voter turnout of \n1,000,000, for the sake of easy mathematics,. Let's suppose A gets 40% \nagain. \n\nThis means A got 400,000 votes. How's that an issue? Well, A needed a \nminimum of 250,001 votes, in that scenario, to claim victory. So, even if \nyou support A, this means that 149,999 votes, which you'll recall, backed \nthe winner, are also effectively meaningless. That's over 50% of the total \nvotes for the winner, negated by victory conditions. \n\nScale this up to higher numbers of voters, and landslide victories, and the \nproblem gets even worse. \n\nSo, even if you support the eventual winner, your vote can be statistically \nuseless.\ufeff",

This means that you can nominate \nwhich party your vote goes to if the party you initially voted for doesn't \nget 50+% of the vote.  Counting votes is an iterative process - eliminating \nparties with the least amount of votes and adding the preferred votes to \nother parties until one party has 50+% of the vote.\n\nYou choose who your preferred vote goes to.  However, this can mean, in \ncertain elections, having to rank 130+ candidates in order.  Only \nalternative is let the party you vote for pick where your vote goes, if \nthey drop out.  Needless to say, most people let the party decide.\n\nThis system sucks.  \n\nUnless you vote for one of the two main parties, your vote could go to a \nparty you don't agree with.  Vote for one party, somehow that vote ends up \ngoing to another.  Sounds pretty suss, doesn't it?  Makes you think, why \neven vote if my vote goes somewhere else?\n\nCompounding this problem is that people are forced to vote in Australia - \nif you don't vote, you get fined.  So you are forced to vote in a system \nwhere your vote potentially goes to a party you don't care about.  Awesome.\n\nThis causes some bizarre results in certain elections, as minor parties \npreference votes are courted by the two major parties, possibly in exchange \nfor their preference votes.  This results in joke parties, with a \nnegligible % of votes, getting into parliament, through a tit-for-tat \narrangement with major parties.\n\nAs if we needed any more reason to hate our politicians, we get that sort \nof crap.  I'm at the point where I am not going to vote for anybody.  Just \nhand in a blank vote.  No fine - I still \"voted\", by ticking my name off, \njust didn't vote for anyone.  Ideally I would like to vote for a joke \nparty, to make a statement as we're screwed no matter which of the two main \nparties are in power, but that vote will end up in the hands of a major \nparty anyway.  So only thing for it is to not vote at all.\ufeff",

For one thing, most legislation is of great importance to a \nfew, but little importance to most, so it's not worth the majority's effort \nto lobby.  (Spending and tax incentives often help one industry, company, \nclass, or individual at the expense of everyone else.)  For another thing, \nthe majority is just plain wrong in many cases-- especially when it comes \nto complicated science. And it's often easier to mislead the public (which \ndoesn't pay much attention to the issues) than professional legislators \n(who do.)\n\nSo democracy is a blunt instrument, but it's better than the alternative, \nnamely violent revolution when (a) things go really wrong, and (b) the \ngovernment lets its guard down.\n\nOne thing that would significantly improve our system is multiple-choice \nvoting, such as instant-runoff voting.  It captures opinions more \naccurately and removes the incentive to vote for the guy you don't like but \nseems more electable.

Most \npeople vote thinking that although they may like the 3rd party, the Liberal \nDemocrats (probably stuck in between the other two parties, but sometimes \nstraying to the left of Labour), they can't win and they don't vote for \nthem for fear of the other getting into power. If you live in a \nconstituency where the party you like/support has no chance of winning then \ninstead of voting for them you vote for the party that is the one you don't \ndislike out of the two big parties. At present the Lib Dems did hold the \nbalance of power at the last election and we have a Con-Dem \n(Conservative-Liberal Democrat) government, but at the next election the \nLib Dems will be destroyed for betraying some of their campaign pledges. \nLike in the US most of the seats are safe Labour or safe Conservative, that \nis apart from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where apart from Labour \nin Wales they have their own nationalist parties that get a small number of \nseats in parliament. The marginal constituencies are the only places the \nparties really campaign hard as that is where the election is won or lost. \nIt is sad that it is this way and I think because of this turnout is low \nand getting lower. People feel disenfranchised. There is UKIP who I have to \nmention, who are more right wing than the Conservatives and blame all the \nills of the country on immigration and think we need to leave the EU. In \nthe current economic times they are the protest vote and have won a few \nby-elections recently, but whether they will win many seats at the next \nelection, next year, remains to be seen. They will get quite a large \npercentage of the overall vote (maybe as high as 15-20%), but this may not \ntranslate into seats in parliament. Lastly as part of the current coalition \ngovernment the Liberal Democrats forced a referendum on AV (alternative \nvoting system). Whilst I'm not a huge fan of this system the current system \ndoesn't work and only a few people in the country hold the power to change \nthe government, whilst the rest feel ignored if they don't agree with the \npeople in the area in which you live.",
