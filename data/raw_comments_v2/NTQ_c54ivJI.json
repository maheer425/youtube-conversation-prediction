            "text": "I feel like some of the comments kind of miss a few things, but here's my \ntake on it: I'm American. Now, your average American girl might really like \na rich guy, a guy who's thin and works out a lot--nice abs, a decent trust \nfund, fast car, a good job, pretty smile, curly hair, dashing and daring, \nquick as a coursing river, etc etc.\n\nSome of these things are general--like I'm totally cool with the pretty \nsmile and curly hair, but the quick as a coursing river is entirely \noptional. Communication and an openness and willingness to share with me \nhis thoughts and ideas are far more important. I feel like those things are \nunspoken but wanted ideals in any mate, for any person. For specifics for \nme, I'm very into the arty types who love books and as much as people mock \nhipsters, I'm totally cool with guys that can their own strawberry \npreserves and use beard oil.\n\nI would say compatibility varies for a lot of people though, and in the \nlong run and interest in each other and a willingness to work for that \ninterest is the most important thing.\n\nBut yeah, when people say \"korean women want so much.\" I'd say that out of \na survey if 40 women say they want a guy who works for Samsung, LG, or \nKia--then that goes on the list, meanwhile the 1-5 women who would totally \ndate a coffee shop owner don't really get mentioned because it wasn't a top \n5 answer. Likewise, I assume women are answering the question based on an \n\"ideal\" fictional mate, which doesn't exist. Say you could \"order up\" the \nideal spouse, what would s/he be?  The reality for myself is that after \nbeing very close to someone, the ideal spouse is someone who enjoys my \ncompany and makes passing the time a pleasant thing. For others, they never \nreally experienced a relationship like this and mostly just think of things \nthat would make their personal lives better(money, status) rather than the \nintangible things that require a lot of fancy work to express. So \"He makes \nlots of money\" is a natural answer for someone who believes that will lead \nto happiness.\ufeff",

Primarily because for instance that's a very accurate \nlist of \"what makes a perfect man\" whereas polls over here show hugely \nvarying ideas of an ideal partner in physical terms, height, shape, colour \netc. etc. but that the ones that stay the same are generally what goes in \nin the mind, ie. Intelligence, a sense of humour, stepping in to help a \nwoman etc.\n\nAlso not supporting your argument is the very open culture of desiring \npeople who your views would suggest are unattractive and yet millions \nopenly admit to, chubby chasers etc.\n\nThe truth is that in western cultures for quite a while and increasingly so \nnow, things like those seem trivial in our cultures. We all may lust after \nsomone because their bodies are very nice and admire that but it doesn't \nmean that it factors into your ideal partner.",
