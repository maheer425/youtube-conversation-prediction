            "text": "Lol the guy at the end I can feel and agree with 100 percent. About 5 years \nback when I was 21 a girl who was a friend/manager of mine called me into \nthe office at my work. We just bullshitted and talked around like normal \nthen all the sudden out of nowhere, she reached over and shut the door. I \nstill to this day swear I heard the door fully shut but lock but anyways \nthe friend/ girl (who was about 28-30 looked at me and said \"do you want a \nblow job?\" I then looked at her and laughed jokingly (basically hoping she \nwas joking because her current husband she just had a kid with was the \nbrother of my best friend whom just got out of prison for his second \nviolent felony.)  Anyways I looked at her and laughed nervously as if she \nwere joking. She then looked at me and said \"come on Austin...\" She then \nstarted to unzip my pants started to pull it out. I then heard a knock at \nthe door and using that for my excuse I stopped and backed up and said \" I \ncant do this... I don't feel right about it being a friend of Mikes and his \nbrothers best friend. Well basically later on since I was at the time using \nany and every drug I  could get especially opiates. Crystal (the girl \nmentioned earlier) mentioned she had a full bottle of prometh and codeine. \nIt wasn't premo but it was better then a kick in the nuts and it would keep \nme well and if lucky a little bit high. So I showed up and drank it while \nsitting in front of her husband. She then left to go get some beer.  My \nluck being the way it always is, Mike her boyfriend got a text from the \nother line cook at work. He was the same guy who apparently started \nknocking on the door. Crystals husband had the same phone and he shared it \nwith Crystal. This moron whom apparently had been snooping and listening by \nthe office door decided to text her phone.... at that specific time... \n\"Since you gave Austin head can I get some too?\" So there I was standing in \nfront of this two time violent, crazy, full blooded, Irish felon. All he \ndid was look up at me and say \"be honest with me right now! Did my wife \nsuck your dick dude? Just tell me the truth? I wont hurt you. Just be \nhonest with me. Petrified, even though I knew I was telling the truth I \nspilled the whole story in front of him. And although for a few minutes he \nlooked like he was going to shoot or stab me, by the time I got to the end \nof the story he basically said  \"Ok I believe you and I trust you. Thank \nyou for being honest with me. I don't hate you but I hate Brian for texting \nwhat he did and I hate my wife for doing what she did.\" Basically he \nbelieved me because I told him that if I would have really let his wife do \nthat I would have been much more secure and safe about it and went out to \nmy car in the back parking lot and that I wasn't stupid and that I would \nnever do that because he was my best friends brother and he was a friend \ntoo. But yeah that shit scared me that night a little bit. I basically \nwanted to share that story because I can relate to the last guy in the \nvideo with being a younger guy in his early twenties and being manipulated \nby slightly older, married women.\ufeff",

            "text": "\"People with a healthy self esteem, who love and respect themselves, who \nlove and respect other people, and who place a high value on loyalty would \nnever cheat on a lover or spouce, even if they are unhappy, because it is \nnot honorable or the right thing to do. They simply will end the \nrelationship when they are unhappy instead of looking for fulfillment \noutside of the relationship. When a relationship ends, they take time to \ngrieve and develop a sense of peace within themselves before they start \ndating again. People who cheat tend to be insecure, selfish, narcisstic, \nunhappy and have a low self worth. Since they have a low opinion of \nthemselves, they project this on to other people and often feel no remorse \nor regret for hurting other people. Therefore, people who have a history of \ncheating, deception and a total lack of concern for the feelings of other \npeople, should never be considered potential marriage partners, \nrelationship material or someone to be in an exclusive relationship with. \nHowever, they can make great sex playmates, friends with benefits or people \nto have an open relationship with\" ~ Coach Corey Wayne.\ufeff",
