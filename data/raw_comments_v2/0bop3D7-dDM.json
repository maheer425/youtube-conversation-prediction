            "text": "+Beate Lund T\u00f8rud \nOkay so first off, this isn't a comment meant to attack you. Just my two \ncents:\n\nParents can't always control every situation. As bad as I know some of \nthese junk foods to be, I don't even want it touching my child's lips. But \nhere's the thing, my son also has grandparents and aunts and uncles who \nwill inevitably babysit. So, while I personally am never going to cave in \nto buying him any of that crap, it's pretty much guaranteed that he will \nstill be exposed to it. Everyone knows that grandparents spoil their \ngrandchildren, and many times it's with food. I completely agree that \neducation is the best defense, but I can't convince every person who will \never take care of my son and feed my son of how awful some of these foods \nare. A lot of people in my own family would prefer to stay ignorant, and \ncommon sense tells them that \"if it were really THAT bad for them, it \nwouldn't be sold.\" So while even the average \"healthy\" person won't eat \nthese foods EVERY day, they see absolutely nothing wrong with having them \nevery now and then. I, on the other hand, do. Obesity is not the only \nhealth issue that arises from some of these foods. Actually, it's the least \nof my concern regarding my own child. I plan on packing my son's lunches, \nbut I can't guarantee that his grandparents will only ever feed him what I \nsend. I guess I could always threaten to not send him over with whoever \ndoesn't listen to my strict rules about his diet though, right? Hmm, I \ndon't know about that one.\n\nWe live in a society that still considers CapriSun to be juice and gives \nGatorade and Pedialyte to kids to hydrate them when they're sick and where \nteachers can reward your child with candy. If you're lucky, maybe they'll \nbe rewarded with \"healthy\" NutriGrain bars. Our society as a whole have \ndifferent interpretations of what is healthy, and this is largely due to \nthe marketing LIES told by these food companies. LIES that are teaching \nsociety that non-fat foods are healthy when the fat is simply replaced with \na whole bunch of sugar to keep a good flavor. There are many false health \nclaims that are marketed such as \"non-fat\" and \"real fruit\" and the list \ngoes on. These foods are heavily processed, full of additives, and \nunfortunately, nutritionists on a government pay-roll are teaching them to \nbe acceptable. I know this first-hand because my aunt is a nutritionist at \nWIC. Our whole country is highly misinformed about food, which would \ninclude our own naive children. I intend to do everything that I can to \nhelp my son enjoy eating a balanced whole food diet with as little \nprocessed garbage as humanly possible. With the struggle I'm already going \nto have getting my own family to cooperate, the last thing that I need is \nfor Scooby-Doo to undermine my efforts. ",

Not all have the time to incorporate all this into their \nschedules when the food industry is still there to f their brains over. \nSimilar to smoking--okay, we've done a ton of educating on how deadly \nsmoking is. Can you smoke in \"moderation?\" There are even warning labels on \ncigarette packages that specifically say \"smoking can cause a slow and \npainful death.\" Some people are still ignoring it and others give in to it \nnot because they want to but because that's just not a matter of willpower. \nThere are more complications because our brain is complex.
