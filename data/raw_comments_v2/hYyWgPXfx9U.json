Hackers usually look for \npeople who are depressed, think bad about themselves and stuff like that. \nFor example, if I was like \"Oh no, by girlfriend just broke up with me! :'( \n\" You get it. Hackers in that situation may be all like \"How dare they! You \nare SO handsome!\"\nThey compliment you, butter you up until you are so comfortable with them \nthat they start asking personal information like where you live and things \nof that nature. If you keep up the good esteem, you are less likely to be a \ntarget for Hackers. This also is good for bullying, I think. Emphasis on 'I \nthink' by the way... I'm not sure, but be positive and look on the bright \nside of everything nonetheless. Bye!\ufeff",
