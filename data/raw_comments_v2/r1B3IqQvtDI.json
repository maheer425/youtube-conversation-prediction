I don't think there are differences between the \ncountries concerning the acceptance or requirements.

For example, tomorrow I have 2 hours of \nJapanese, 2 hours of History of China in the morning and then after lunch \nanother 2 hours of History. This course really exhausts you but I'm used to \nit, I'm used to study a lot.  \nPlus, my japanese teacher, as for the attendance, she is like the teachers \nin Korea. You cannot arrive to the class at 9h02. I'm in my second year so \nI'm used to it but the first year students seem not understand that yet, \nand for example, in high school, I always arrived the classroom 15-20 \nminutes before the class starts. So I guess that's not really \"shocking\" \nfor me! :p  \nAnd, this year I got level 1 on TOPIK. Self studying during the summer \nvacations, and when the 2nd year started, oh boy....what a nightmare the \nfirst semester was! T.T Studying 3 languages at the same time, it was \ntiring but damn, I feel proud! \nAfter 3 years, if I don't get a scholarship to do my masters in China, \nwell, focus on Korean and try to find some scholarship or to do masters or \nto do a Korean language program in Korea. :D :D \n\nI love your videos guys!!!
