How many days does it take to upload something to YouTube?\nWith a slow connection and regular PC 20 minutes to an hour.\nHow many hours has it been so far since Deep Space 69 supposedly aired on \nFusion?\n\n\nI am starting to think that Mondo Media sold the programming rights for \nDeep Space 69 to Fusion (which is partially owned by Mondo Media) with some \nkind of 'no uploading' clause in the contract (which is typical).\n\nIt would make sense to do this so Mondo Media can get the show on a \ntelevised network with advertising so they can make money off of it.\n\nHowever, if you compare the amount of dirty humor in Media Media's \nprogramming (Deep Space 69 is a prime example of it) Mondo Media is far too \ngraphic for any main stream TV networks.\nThis is why Deep Space 69 ended on on a wanna be start-up network (Fusion) \nto begin with and not USA, Nickelodeon, or Spike.\n\nAnd what sucks (worse than a 60 year old toothless whore) is that when Deep \nSpace 69 fails to bring in enough ratings on Fusion (regardless of who's \nfault it is) Deep Space 69 will get canceled, completely.\n\nThen a month or two to a year later we'll get a pirated version of the \nremaining episodes of Deep Space 69 on YouTube and that will be all she \nwrote for Deep Space 69.\n\n\nAnd really who's hair brain idea was it to form a network between Disney \nand Mondo Media?\nCan anyone name a single element in commonly found is Mondo Media's \nprogramming that is even remotely relate-able to Disney's programming other \nthan 'the cartoon element'? (Now, that was a rant!)\n\n\nAnd I ask you people this:\n\nDoes anyone have access to Fusion through their TVs?\nAnd if so, did the 25th episode of Deep Space 69 air as they claimed it \nwould?\n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI know that cartoonists and media companies both seek to make money, but \nquite that desire for money leads the people in charge to make terrible \ndecisions.\n\nPutting Deep Space 69 on an advertised network was a bad call and is likely \ngoing to lead to Deep Space 69's cancellation.\n\nIf we want Deep Space 69 back we need to petition to keep Deep Space 69 on \na non-advertised network.\ufeff",
