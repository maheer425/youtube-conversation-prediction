I \ncannot claim to understand this fully -- we're cyclical people - everything \nfor us (EVERYTHING!) has a beginning and an end.  So, like I said, it's \nnearly impossible for most of us mere humans to \"wrap our brains around\" \nthat concept (well, at least for me it is).  But I do know this:   every \nsingle thing about creation and our physical world points to His \nhandiwork.  Indeed, it practically \"screams\" it.  I'm not a lemming and I'm \nnot delusional. . .but I'm also not blind or deaf. . .    If I listen to \nthe sound of a baby (in the womb), I know it was HIS miracle.  If I look at \nthese constellations. . .I know it was His artwork.   If I think, even for \ntwo seconds, about the absolutely PERFECT synergy between our plants/trees \nand humans (they take in C02 and emit 0 - we take in 0 and emit C02 - how \ndang groovy is THAT?!), I cannot help but be impressed by His \nthoughtfulness. . . .   And you are correct:  there are many questions \nw/out answers. .  .  but I'll trust Him anyway -- because I've simply seen \ntoo much over the course of my own life to doubt Him now.

Well, my \ntheory is that it expands at the speed of light, and seeing as nothing can \ntravel faster than the speed of light, it's impossible for anything to be \noutside of the border of the universe. Hence, just a  vacuum.\n\nSo, what is that vacuum, hmmm? Well, we're inside a black hole, the edge of \nthe universe is simply the edge of our black hole. \n\nNow, I hear you ask, LOGIC EVIDENCE, SOMETHING? Ok, I shall indulge.\n\nWhen we look at the similarities a black hole has to our universe, there \nare quite a few:\n\n1) It had a start (Big Bang). Our universe started with a massive \nexplosion. How does a black hole start, ah yes, with a massive explosion, \nwhen the star dies and turns into a supernova. \n\n2) Seeing as a black hole is created from a large star, you would think if \nthe universe was a black hole, it would contain many of the same things as \na star. Iron, Hydrogen, tick. Two of the main components of our universe \nare shared by every star.\n\n3) Black holes start because the remnants of the star's core collapse into \na singularity, a single point. Since we're assuming the Big Bang theory to \nbe true, we know that our universe also started in a single point.\n\n4) Our universe is expanding, black holes also expand.\n\n5) If our universe started as a single point, where does all the space come \nfrom? Something doesn't just come out of nothing, this massive amount of \nspace, iron, hydrogen and everything else must have come from somewhere, \nright? So, my answer is that everything in our universe has been sucked in \nto it by the black hole which is our universe, from another universe, of \nwhich our black hole is a part of.\n\n6) Dark matter, we don't know what it does right? Well, how about this. It \nisn't reactive to light. Black holes are the only thing powerful enough to \ncapture light, so in my opinion dark matter is the residual energy that's \ncome through the entrance to our black hole.\ufeff",

We don't. We know the \nuniverse exists and we know black holes (probably) exist. We know \nabsolutely nothing more because we are such an undeveloped civilisation. At \nthe end of the day, that makes my theories as good as yours and yours as \ngood as mine. It makes both our ideas as good as 'top scientists', because, \nthey know nothing more than we do about the cosmos. This isn't arrogant, \nit's simply a fact, because as a race, we know very very little. Most of \nyour points seem to include the words, 'there is zero evidence for', and \nmost of my counter-points would similarly contain the words, 'there is zero \nevidence against'. The one thing we can agree on it seems is that there \n(probably) was a Big Bang, which started of the universe as we know it. \nHowever, you do raise some interesting points, which I'll now respond to.\n\nYou say, quite rightly, that the rate of acceleration of universal \nexpansion is increasing, but with current knowledge, this cannot continue. \nWe believe light to be the fastest thing in the universe, so surely the \nuniverse cannot expand at a speed faster than light? Eventually, it's \nacceleration will plateau, I suppose.\n\nI suppose my main problem with the single universe theory is the question \nof what lies outside its boundaries.

Firstly, because 'universe' implies everything there is. \nSecondly, because I cannot think of a reasonable answer to the question of \nwhat lies outside universal boundaries. Or indeed what those boundaries \nare. Is there just a sudden physical block, that seems unlikely. If there \nisn't though, what would hypothetically stop an object from crossing that \nboundary?

While there is nothing \narrogant about pointing out inconsistency, there is arrogance in assuming \none has it right. That's your department, not mine. The universe is what it \nis. Making the analogy between the universe and a black hole is simply \nwrong. A great deal is known about both the universe and black holes. They \nare hardly similar.\n\nWhile the big bang theory (actually a hypothesis) is likely the most \nplausible explanation of the beginning of our universe there are other \nideas that are equally plausible. I say equally because so far, there is \nnothing to distinguish between say, the Ekpyrotic hypothesis of Steinhardt \nand Turok (a possibly endless cyclical universe with no conceivable \nbeginning or end) and the big bang hypothesis. All predictions made by both \nhypotheses are so far confirmed which means there is nothing (so far) to \nrule in or out either of them. A careful and very detailed analysis of the \npolarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background will do that but it is not \nyet complete.\n\nJust because the universe contains (in the form of normal mass) mostly \nhydrogen and helium (not iron) hardly means the universe is a black hole. \nIt's actually excellent reason to exclude the universe being a black hole. \n(Every property of a black hole does that as well.)\n\nThere is nothing to back up the idea that the universe started as a single \npoint. It may have started as a singularity but they are not equivalent. A \nsingle point has no volume and thus cannot contain any mass/energy. Quantum \nmechanics tells us that a single point is a mere mathematical construct. \nThere is no such thing as 'nothing' in nature.\n\nPoint 5 cannot be properly responded to as it is gibberish. The universe \ndidn't start as a single point, it doesn't show any reason to accept that \nall the mass/energy in it came from somewhere else and while I'm at it, \nkindly explain 'somewhere else' or 'some other universe'. The idea that \nother universes exist is interesting but there is zero evidence for them.\n\nThe fate of our universe is to expand forever. At least, there is nothing \nto suggest that it will end it's expansion and then collapse into it's \noriginal state. While that idea did have some traction in the early 1990's, \nit was done away with by the results of the late 1990's studies which \nshowed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (not \ndecelerating).\n\nAs there is zero evidence that the universe is the result of mass/energy \nentering from a black hole, there is also zero evidence that dark matter is \n\"the residual energy that's come through the entrance to our black hole\". \n(Please look up just what black holes are all about and more importantly, \n*not* all about.) Do I know what dark matter is? What part of \"the exact \nnature of dark matter is not known\" don't you understand?\n\nI'm not being a smart-arse.

Our solar \nsystem is part of a galaxy that we call the Milky Way. Our galaxy consists \nof more than two hundred billion stars and their planets. There are more \nthan a hundred billion galaxies in our expanding, 156 billion-light years \nwide universe, which would suggest that there are trillions of stars, \nplanets, and moons.\nObviously, these numbers are only extremely rough estimates. We will never \nknow exactly how many galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies \nthere are in the universe. But the fact that we are talking about hundreds \nof billions should be sufficient to amaze us and overwhelm the capacity of \nour minds to even begin to comprehend the vastness of creation. Consider \nthe possibility that there may be more than one universe. Entertain the \nnotion that there might be many parallel universes.\nNow, try to imagine the Earth from the perspective of outer space. \nVisualize it quietly orbiting the Sun. Visualize the Sun and our solar \nsystem tucked away among billions of other stars and their solar systems \nwithin our galaxy. Stretch your imagination further and try to visualize \nour galaxy among a seemingly endless mass of billions of other galaxies.\nIf you think of the Earth within the context of the universe(s), it is \ndifficult to cling to any certainty you may have about the significance or \nuniqueness of our planet, and thus the degree of specialness we like to \nattribute to its inhabitants. It is not only that the Earth gets lost in \nthe numbers, it is that our beautiful planet in reality is no more than a \nspec of dust in the universe.",
