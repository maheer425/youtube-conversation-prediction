Speaking \nobjectively...Boston is one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been to. \nBoston Public Garden is essentially a miniature Central Park. I loved \nriding the swan boat. Boston Public Library is also nice. There's the \nunique looking Zakim Bridge.  Boston has a Chinatown. It's not as large as \nNYC's Chinatown, but it's worth a stroll.\n\n4:39 The team that I love to hate. Home of the PED-abusing Red Sox. I've \nnever been to a Red Sox game, but I went on a Fenway Park tour. The Green \nMonster didn't seem as big in person.\n\n4:43 I'm surprised the Sox honored Babe Ruth, given all of the misery he \ncaused their franchise\n\nWhat's with the narrator's accent?\ufeff",
