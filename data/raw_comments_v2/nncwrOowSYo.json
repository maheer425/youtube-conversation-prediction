Having just spent two months majorly in Singapore you tend \nto notice that areas like Singapore, Korea and Japan have a cheaper \nlifestyle. As you said, I wouldn't expect to get a good meal for under ten \ndollars (it's almost tear-worthy if you do). The idea behind produce, and I \nonly state this from my experience in Singapore, is that they don't have \nthe resources within their own country and therefore outsource the \nresponsibilty to able countries they have trade alliances with and that's \nwhy it may sometimes be more expensive. Also, as I was visiting, due to the \nfloods occurring in Malaysia, one kind of crop could not be available and \nwould significantly change the relations between Singapore and Malaysia as \nwell as for the people of Singapore whom, if lucky enough would get it at \nan inflated prices. \ufeff",

Yet on weekends they \nleave those SAME schedules intact with epic schedules that never end full \nway from/to both stations!!! They have done cut backs like that with a lot \nof buses!!! The line I mentioned was metro's Q bus line. The price for me \nis reduced to about half due to my disability smarttrip ($0.90 two buses as \nyou get a free ride if you use the transfer in an hour). The regular cash \nfare is like 1.70! For me between stops with my card due to disability \nmetro rail can be anywhere from 1-3+ between stops and same, if not more \nfor anyone else! Stops are you get on and off and that's end of the line, \nyo do not have to pay to transfer color but for rush hour and non rush the \nfares crazy. It's a MESS!!! You are lucky you just have buses!",

That's why produce and meat is so cheap in \nAmerica.\n\nKorea's extremely high tariffs don't make any sense.  Why put such high \ntariffs on fruits like mangos, pineapples, limes, lemons?  It's not like \nKorean farmers can grow those anyways.  \n\nA lot of the high prices in Korea also have to do with distributors and \nretailers trying make bigger profit margins.  That's why many Koreans now \nshop online and they can purchase name-brand clothes, shoes, and \naccessories for 50% less than what they're sold at Korean department \nstores.  Even Korean electronics are about 50% less overseas, so many \nKoreans order their electronic appliances from foreign companies online and \nthen have it shipped to Korea.",
