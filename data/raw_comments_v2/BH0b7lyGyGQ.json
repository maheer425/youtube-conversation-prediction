They still have a \nstrong socialist party, the New Democratic Party (NDP) which instead of \nabolishing capitalism sought to reform it.\n  He may have been motivated by socialism in the beginning, but if you \nbother to look at what constitutes as socialism, Pol Pot completely failed \nin that regard as it's supposed to be a cooperative endeavor, not something \nforced down someones throat.  At that point it does become a totalitarian \nstate and not a socialist one.\n   China is CURRENTLY facing massive environmental and social issues.  \nWhatever system is in place in China does NOT behave like a socialist, or \neven Marxist communist socio-political system.  The problem with ANY \neconomic, social and political systems is that if you have them in extremes \nyou see atrophy and abuse.  If they exist on a spectrum you need to find \nthe right balance between one form and the other.

Bullshit.  Both systems have no opinions on the matter because \nthey are simply tools for providing structure.  It's when you introduce the \nhuman element and let it run rampant that you get instances like in \nCambodia or the ever growing gap between the wealthy and the poor in this \ncountry.  Instead of demonizing an entire system, why don't look into, \nfigure out what COULD be useful when integrated with another system and \nthen discard the rest?\n   This conversation started from two points; your initial assertion that \nCanada, Scandinavia and Australia were represented as PURE socialist \ncountries and the erroneous connection O'Reilly made between human rights \nlaws and political system ideologies.

Those people suffered un-imaginable torture and execution \nto \"cleanse\"  the capitalist.

Stalin's purge of non-Stalinist Bolsheviks?  \nExecutions outside of the Gulags?  The USSR killed most of its victims \noutside of the Gulags, not in them.\n\nSo... if a government forces people into a career they are non-educated in, \nforces them to use methods that are ineffective, then takes the food from \nthem and leaves nothing for them, that is not the governments fault?!?  The \nUkraine famine is the best documented example of this.  The Soviet \ngovernment organized and controlled the farming, confiscated all of the \nfood, and then control the rail stations and roadways to control who and \nwhat could exit and enter Ukraine.  The Soviet government ate VERY well \nwhile the Ukrainians starved and this was repeated by all of the other \nCommunist governments.  You never see Lenin, Stalin, Mao, or the Kims \nhaving missed a meal (and their soldiers were fairly well fed also).\n\nThe \"historians\" you list all show their own lack of competence (and your \ngullibility) in their statements.",

He gives the number of \nBolsheviks in October 1917 as 2,000, which is a ridiculous underestimate. \nHe quotes from a letter of Lenin to Aleksandr Shliapnikov and gives the \ndate as 17 October 1917; the letter could hardly have originated at that \ntime, since in it Lenin talks about the need to defeat the Tsarist \ngovernment, and turn the war into a civil conflict. He gives credit to the \nAustro-Hungarian rather than the German army for the conquest of Poland in \n1915. He describes the Provisional Government as \"elected.\"\n\nand:\n\nHistorian J. Arch Getty noted that famine accounted for a significant part \nof Courtois's 100 million death toll. He believes that these famines were \ncaused by the \"stupidity or incompetence of the regime,\" and that the \ndeaths resulting from the famines, as well as other deaths that \"resulted \ndirectly or indirectly from government policy,\" should not be counted as if \nthey were equivalent to intentional murders and executions.[20]\nMark Tauger disagrees with the authors' thesis that the famine of 1933 was \nartificial and genocidal. Tauger asserts that the authors' interpretation \nof the famine contains errors, misconceptions, and omissions that \ninvalidate their arguments.[21] However, the historian James Mace wrote \nthat Mark Tauger's view of the famine \"is not taken seriously by either \nRussians or Ukrainians who have studied the topic.\"[22] Moreover, Stephen \nWheatcroft, author of The Years of Hunger, claims Tauger's view represents \nthe opposite extreme in arguing the famine was totally accidental.[23]\n\nyou don't have to get bogus statistical information from religious sources \nfor it to be incorrect.",
