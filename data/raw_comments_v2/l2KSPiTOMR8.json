And there\u00b4s no excuse cause she was an \nactress, so the local media knows her... This applies the same to Gwen, \nalthough she died.\nThe trilogy did have many mistakes, specially the one called Spiderman 3, \nhowever it also stands as a great example of the super hero genre (the \nfirst two films) and it even had some few symbolism and philosophical \ndilemmas. Amazing 1 is, in parts, more faithful but it isn\u00b4t that great, \nwhile Amazing 2 is just awesome. A great Spiderman, a great Goblin, a great \nsoundtrack and Electro was far more menacing that Venom, Sandman and The \nLizard. The swing scene at the opening was just like a sequence of panels \ninside the comic. The Rhino wasn\u00b4t even a character so it doesn\u00b4t count and \nthe ending was PERFECT.\nI really hope Marvel makes things right!!\ufeff",
