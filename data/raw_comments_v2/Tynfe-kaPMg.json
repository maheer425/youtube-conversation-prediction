Ethiopia's population may be maxed out based on 2000 per hectare. \n They make 6000 will they not be in the same boat in no time but only with \n3 times the population?  I have 40 bucks a month on my CC going to help a \nchild in Bangladesh.  I was told educate a girl and she will have 2 \nchildren as apposed to 5...that is math I like. If an aid organization \nfocused on feeding what is there in the third world and keeping  birth \nrates low....very low.  I'm guessing money would pour in.  \ufeff",

Want to help \na third world country? While these are some very broad strokes, do these \nsteps IN ORDER:\n\n1. Promote a stable security situation. You can't do anything if it isn't \nsafe and it's unclear if the government is in control.\n\n2. Help install a working government. And by \"working government\" I mean \none which can control it own borders, has an effective monopoly on force, \nand can effectively implement infrastructure improvements, agricultural \nreforms, etc.\n\n3. Assist opening up the country up to the world market, including foreign \ninvestment, free trade, and tourism. This is to be done to encourage \nentrepreneurship, capital formation, and the establishment of successful \ncompanies and brands. Avoid protectionism unless it is to counter specific \nexamples of foreign protectionism (and even then use it sparingly), avoid \nthe temptation to bloat the bureaucracy to reduce unemployment (you'll get \nthe best and brightest trying to be mailmen instead of starting \nenterprises), avoid import substitution industries (which make crappy \noverpriced goods and pay their too numerous workers too much for their \nshoddy products) and above all, don't try to inflate the currency to pay \nfor government expenses.\n\n4. Promote education. While this should be done to an extent while steps 2 \nand 3 are going on, a good education system needs more money than what can \nreasonably be accomplished before step 3 is achieved. Healthcare should be \npromoted in step 4 as well, but only after education is funded.\n\n5. Encourage higher-value added products, more sophisticated exports, and \npromote the country's brand name when it starts to gain some traction on \nthe world markets. The country's brand needs to start gaining traction on \nits own before government promotion, not the other way around, or else the \nattention will end when money for the PR campaign dries up.\n\n6. By now, the economy should be quite developed, but to prevent \nbacksliding (like Argentina), a country has to keep inventing new products, \nmaking new innovations, pressing into new industries, or better yet, \nstarting new industries (like the US did with the invention of the \nsemiconductor), or best of all, revolutionizing pre-existing industries, as \nHenry Ford did. Ford didn't invent the car, but he made it accessible to \nthe masses. Much like how Edison did not invent the light bulb (Swan did \nthat), Ford was able to take advantage of an established product and make \nit practical. Had cars been invented along with Ford, people might not have \nbeen convinced of the practicality of buying them, and his business might \nhave failed. Remember, smart people invent things, but geniuses \nrevolutionize things!\ufeff",

His \noverexcited, overwhelming display of uncertainty, helplessness before what \nhe described as \"immensely complex\" task. Listen closely at what he is \nsaying. His key fraise is \"....the truth about [how to contribute to \nsolving agricultural problems] is complicated and messy, and *any easy \nnarratives* you may hear are 'TOO SIMPLISTIC' in my opinion\".\n\nWhat I think he meant by \" easy narratives \" are principles. If someone \nwould attempt to show him a set of principles by which you can simplify \nsolving this particular problem he would immediately dismiss it as being \n\"too simplistic\". This is the symptom of pragmatism which is, \nunfortunately, the main method of solving issues today. \n\nNo wonder he looked stressed. Pragmatism leads you to believe that there \nare no principles or real solutions. There is only random, helpless, range \nof the moment reactions or attempts to randomly plug holes in a leaking \ndam. Pragmatism is the rejection of principled solutions in favor of short \nterm, range of the moment, knee jerk, fighting small fires as they occur \nand dismissing the *cause* of fires as \"too simplistic \". *Pragmatism is \nthe fetish of complexity*.\n\nThis video is a prime example.\nNote that his goal is not to show you how to simplify the problem and \nattack it more effectively. His goal is to show you how complex the problem \nis and how terribly difficult or even hopeless it is to even begin solving \nit. And if someone attempts to show you a general pattern or a principle \nyou must immediately dismiss it as being \"not complex enough\" or, in other \nwords, \"*too simplistic*\". This nonsense is a typical result of today's \ndisastrously wrong approach to most problems. \nThe right approach is the principled approach. We must look at what is the \ncause of fires before fighting them. In this case, as he mentioned, we must \neliminate the irrational laws propped up by corrupted Ethiopian politicians \nwhich ban the export of corn to give people the incentive to have excess \nproduction of corn. Also, the lack of the basic principles of human rights, \nsuccessful women farmers are *forced* by the tribe (collective) to \nsurrender all profit to the husband. This tradition is old and very \ndestructive.\nAnother thing, because the US/EU was supplying corn for free anyway, there \nwere less incentives to produce it. \nCharity and relief should be very short term help to any country that \ndeserves it, so we must make it clear that mooching is not a sustainable \nstrategy. Decades long UN/US/EU \"relief\" programs are a big part of the \nproblem and not a solution. Showering them with aid is wrong and it needs \nto stop gradually within a a few years. Only when Ethiopian government \nunderstands that they cannot hide behind foreign aid and need to liberate \nthe economy to allow market forces to operate unobstructed, only then \nEthiopia will begin to rise from the ashes of tribal primitivism.\n\nThe cause of the agricultural problems in Ethiopia is not lack of our help, \nbut lack of appreciation of the importance of principles. \n\n\n\n",
