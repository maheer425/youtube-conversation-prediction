Where I come from, the bodies of these idols \nare deemed too thin (to the point where some people I know would term them \n\"sickly\" and \"unattractive\"), and the body type that is considered ideal is \none that has some meat to it (ie. zaftig and voluptuous). I guess it all \nboils down to the perceptions of pulchritude of different cultures. I'm an \nandrogynous femme gay guy living in an Asian community, and because K-Pop \nis a huge deal here I find myself being shoehorned into this ideal because \nit almost seems to me that in my community, you're only a drool-worthy \nAsian man, worthy of a relationship, if you look like a Greek god, or if \nyou're as \"pretty\" as the female K-Pop idols. \ufeff",
