His particular theory didn't foresee the agricultural \nand industrial revolutions,  but that doesn't make population growth less \nof a problem.\n\nChina was was clever in inttroducing new techniques into a traditional \nagrarian society that could finally afford to feed more people.  Well, \nChina got more people.  And what is China doing now?  Enforcing a one-child \nper family policy.  And why?  Because they can count, even if they have to \nuse an abacus.  They're clamping down on population growth now because \nthere is a two-generation lead time for control measures to take effect, \nand they don't want to wait until the problem becomes obvious and people \nare starving.  They're the only country in the world that's seriously \naddressing the problem.\n\nGreen actually does mention a useful analogy but only once, and in a single \nphrase.  Land is a finite resource.  (Any arguments?)  Oil is a finite \nresource.  (Questions?) \n\nFinite resources get used up eventually.  Right now, much of the world is \nat war because of oil.  Ten years ago, deep water drilling was pushing the \nenvelope at a thousand feet.  Now we're down to 5,000 feet and still \ncounting.  And there's shale.  That's all temporary.  Technological advance \nisn't going to solve the problem if our need for oil continues to increase.\n\nWe'll eventually find an alternative energy source -- wind, tidal, solar, \nnuclear -- because we'll have to.\n\nBut what is the alternative to growing crops on land?  Where is the \nalternative to land?\n\nRight now there is a strong movement afoot in the US to curb any means of \npreventing conception for moral reasons.  It's a step backwards, which I \nhope we won't take too long to realize.  Can anyone imagine an earth in \nwhich every square mile of land is filled with people standing shoulder to \nshoulder?  Because that's the direction we're headed in -- except maybe for \nChina.\n\nI remember watching LBJ crowing to the press about the growth of America's \npopulation.  Behind him was a huge population clock ticking off the \nincrease.  When the clock reached 200 million, Johnson's speech was \ninterrupted by applause.  Now America's population is roughly 320 million.  \nIn the wake of that increase we've seen urban sprawl, habitat destruction, \nspecies wiped out with unknown consequences, problems with energy and with \nwaste disposal, crowding, crime, high rents, and other dysfunctions.  I \ndon't count whatever spiritual quality has been lost in our natural \nlandscapes, now strewn with garbage, condos, and giant windmills. \n\nIn the end, Malthus' general point was right.  We are like rabbits.  \nWhether we're any smarter than rabbits remains to be seen.\ufeff",

The \nresources may be finite, but the value that can be extracted from them can \nbe multiplied.\n\nEventually there may be a limit on how much value can be extracted from \nresources, work from energy, and food from land.  But by the time that \nlimit is reached another factor comes into play - human population ceasing \nto grow geometrically.  Not only do we have the technology to limit \nreproduction, but families have the incentive to do so.\n\nThis incentive is in two parts.  Firstly, whereas before a child could \nstart becoming a net economic asset to the family as soon as their work in \nthe field offset the food, clothes etc they consumed, now they have to \nfinish an extensive education first.  Children are expensive.  Secondly, \nlabour saving devices in the home have not only greatly reduced the \nproportion of the population who either are, or employ, domestic servants, \nthey have also (when combined with the first incentive, i.e. fewer \nchildren, and those children at school much of the time) enabled more women \nto become wage earners outside of the home.\n\nThere are two groups who will counter the trend to smaller families.  \nFirstly, in countries that provide welfare systems, those who have \npsychologically adapted to being on welfare, who gain an economic benefit \nfrom having more children (to the extent that the alternative is being on \nwelfare with fewer children) and/or need children to bear the lack of \ncompanionship on the part of women whose infantilised partners show little \ncommitment.  Secondly, cultures which try to preserve a tradition of \nwomen's place being in the home.\n\nThis does not mean that civilisation will be destroyed by an increasing \nproportion of uneducated and aggressive people.  With regards to welfare, \nwelfare systems may be reformed to be less psychologically destructive, and \nrising countries that do not have western style welfare systems will never \ndevelop destructive models of them.

Sounds good.  We're currently using about 11% of the world's \n36% possible arable land, so we might be able to support the sheer numbers \nof our growing future populations.  Except with all the new farm land you \ncreate by clearing for crops like wheat, corn, etc., you reduce \nbiodiversity, contribute to climate change, and reduce the quality of the \nsoil to exhaustion with every harvest.  If one inch of rich top soil takes \na thousand years to form (or at least according to Al Gore and James \nMartin), the fact that we've gone from 3 billion to 7 billion in the short \nspan of half a century should be cause for some concern.  If we keep adding \na billion people every fifteen years, we'll reach 10-12 billion by the end \nof the century.  We may be able to sustain those populations, but we're \ngoing to have to get creative with regards to supplementing their diets. \n Relying too much on the mass production of a few food sources leads to \nmalnutrition.  I'm a big believer in extreme technologies that make \nresource scarcity a non-issue, such as affordable, scalable purifiers \nmaking salt and waste into drinkable water and electricity, but it will be \ninteresting to see how smoothly and equitably we apply those advances to \ndeal with our rising populations.  \n\nThe other big thing I think you may have left out of the population \nequation is the inverse relationship between rising standards of living / \nenergy consumption and fertility rate.  Yes, the more a nation rises up the \neconomic ladder - better technology, healthcare, education, jobs, etc., the \nless rapidly its population grows (the United States on last count \nproducing 1.9 children per woman compared to 6.7 in Somalia, circa 2012; \nfifteen years ago, the numbers in America were more like 2.2, so we're \nmaking progress).  The downside is that the amount of resources consumed \nshoots up (the U.S. being the most advanced, and thus the biggest guzzler, \nutilizing 1/4 of the world's resources with only about 4.5% of the world's \npeople to satiate; granted, we are the world's third largest nation, but \nthat's still a hell of a disparity between population and consumption; if \nChina's growing populations were to consume resources at the same rate, we \nwould apparently need at least two planets; granted, I think the Chinese \nhave historically had more experience with this whole benignly stable \nempire, mass agricultural management thing).  If we can ramp up the \nstabilization of nations, the demand for food, energy, and raw materials \nwill still grow, but the rate of growth per person won't necessarily be as \nextreme.  The idea that we can permanently wipe out things like species \ndestruction and world hunger for 30 billion a piece by stabilizing such \nrepeat offender conflict zone nations is a bargain compared to the $4-6 \ntrillion we've already spent applying temporary freedom band aids to \nimpoverished nations by deploying the obligatory 20,000 troops every couple \nof years just to raid their dirty resources and continue a vicious cycle of \neco-energy destruction.\n\nNational security, usable land, resource consumption, and technological \ninnovation all play roles in the growth rate and size of our populations. \n So, you're right.  The situation is complicated.  And the way that you \ntackle complex problems is by slowing down the time of contact with the \nproblem and breaking it down into more manageable chunks (huzzah for new \nfrontiers in pedagogy!).  To my mind, the more ordinary people, \nparticularly younger people, are exposed to these things as common \nknowledge, the better able they are to treat them as changeable variables \nin a huge human equation as adults, thus making things like policy changes \nand coordination between diverse groups of people very doable.  It helps if \nyou can engage everybody by thinking of these things like a huge video game \nor a movie.  Next thing you know, everyone's saying sh-t like \"when I was a \nkid, changing the world was as easy as playing a game.\"  I wonder who in \nacademia has already made such simulations ...\n\nHey, we do like our challenges, right?

Amplification has already \nbeen debunked in the 90's. Look it up.\n\nBut, for the sake of argument, let's say climate change does exist so......\n\n2. Is climate change caused by man?\n     Probably not. Ice caps on mars have been receding rapidly in the past \ncouple of decades. Point being that climates are changing on other planets \nand as far as I know no one is driving there SUV on other planets. Unless \nthe mars rover comes with a hemi.      Besides, CO2, the gas pinned as the \nculprit for climate change, is a naturally occurring gas that allows life \nto exist on our planet which has an atmosphere that is 78.084% N2, a gas we \ndon't even breath! In fact our atmosphere only contains .0345% CO2. Heck at \nleast Ar is on the board with a solid .934%.\n\nBut, for the sake of argument, let's say climate change is caused by man \nso....\n\n3. Is man made climate change the result of unregulated capitalism and over \npopulation?\n     Definitely not. The poorest and oft times the most over populated \nplaces in the world also have the lowest carbon foot print.\n     So it's not overpopulation so it must be unregulated capitalism right? \nWrong! In fact the western industrialized world does a fantastic job of \navoiding environmental disasters and cleaning up the environmental \ndisasters they inevitably do cause.\n     I argue that ownership of property instills an incentive in the owner \nto maintain that property and protect, conserve, and even replenish its \nresources. I argue that it is centralized economies, restrictions on trade, \nhigh taxes, and over regulation that mitigate innovation and economic \ngrowth and it is innovation and economic growth that will allow us to make \nthe transition to cleaner energy sources. For instance in the US we have a \nsomewhat free market where our power companies have developed clean coal, \nbut the environmentalists said \"coal bad\" and proceeded to shut down 36 \nclean coal power planets in texas. This is relevant because 36 dirty coal \npower plants have recently came online near the US/Mexican border.\n\nIn conclusion:\n     If, the black smoke and tar belching out of those Mexican smoke stacks \nshould congeal into a Disney inspired super villain with a sassy baritone \nand proceed to attack the rain forest; then, this could stand as a proof \nthat the real culprit of man made climate change is bad government policy \nlegislated by the same people who profess the existence of climate change \nand directly benefit form it, for the end result of climate change in the \npolitical sphere is; increased tax rates, expansion of government programs, \nbroadening the authority of government agencies, and the ever growing \nintrusions by the government into our lives and mother earth gets butt \nraped anyway.\n\n                                                        ~THE END~\ufeff",
