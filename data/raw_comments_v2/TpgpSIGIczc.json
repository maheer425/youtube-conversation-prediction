The study from 1993 \nwas discredited over a decade ago. I'm actually about to give a \npresentation in about an hour to undergraduate students on recent research \nin the way alcohol affects the adolescent brain. There are several \npublished studies finding direct causation between ethanol and neural cell \ndeath. In the dentate gyrus, one of the only two areas that continues to \nexperience high amounts of neurogenesis into adulthood, ethanol exposure \nresults in significantly higher levels of caspase-3, which is a protein \nmarker for apoptosis, or programmed cell death. There are multiple \npublished reviews by the National Institute of Health pointing out the \nplethora of studies demonstrating brain cell death as a result of ethanol \nintoxication. High BAC results in neuronal death in multiple limbic \ncortical brain regions as well as the entorhinal cortex, which relays \ninformation to and from the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus. Also, the \nhippocampus suffers severe gray matter loss during blackouts, as it is one \nof the areas most strongly depressed by alcohol. Alcohol also causes death \nof neuronal stem cells and impairs neurogenesis, the process by which new \nbrain cells are formed, significantly retarding our ability to learn and \nremember.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that the brain cannot completely repair itself \nfrom alcohol exposure. Multiple studies have found that neurogenesis is \npermanently impaired in the dentate gyrus following chronic ethanol \nexposure (even after only a handful of drunk episodes), and behavioral \nstudies have found permanent cognitive deficits in those with a history of \nbinge drinking, even following prolonged abstinence.\n\nPlease take this video down because you're spreading information that \ncompletely contradicts the neuroscience community's consensus. I mean, \nthere's literally thousands of published studies and reviews over the past \ndecade finding neuron death as a direct result of ethanol exposure. I'm not \nsure why the hell you would cite a study from 1993 without doing more \nrecent research.\ufeff",

Neuroscience is the \nnewest and most poorly understood of the biological sciences, and so we \nDON'T understand why ethanol causes brain cell death, but we have hundreds \nof studies showing that it does.\n\nHere's a fantastic book co-written by a neuroscientist here at Duke about \nhow ethanol affects cognition and the brain.

Just because \nthey counted the same number neurons in the brain samples of \nalcoholics/control group doesn't conclusively prove that alcohol doesn't \nkill brain cells. You guys are smart enough to know that correlation \ndoesn't prove causation. You're ignoring the fact that the brain contains \nstem cells, which could in theory differentiate and replace brain cells \nkilled by alcohol.  Alcohol can certainly kill brain cells!!! The mechanism \nexists and is well studied... It's called glutamate excitotoxicity. When \nyou drink alcohol your NMDA receptors are upregulated and your GABA \nreceptors are downregulated. NMDA excites, GABA inhibits... When alcohol \nwears off, your inhibitory synapses no longer inhibit your excitatory \npathways, and in turn your excitatory pathways fire off too fast. This \nquickly overwhelms the cell, leading to diminished redox status, and in \nturn causes the cell to undergo apoptosis. Don't believe me? It's called \nGoogle Scholar... Also, the studies were done on alcoholics, which \nrepresent a finite portion of the population, which is a major red flag as \nto how this should be applied to the rest of us humans.The reason they're \nalcoholics in the first place is their bodies break down alcohol extremely \nefficiently without much damage. They become alcoholics because for many \nyears these people never get hangovers or get sick from drinking.... Also, \nhow the hell did you guys leave out alcohols metabolite acetaldehyde? This \nsubstance is extremely carcinogenic and toxic and you guys simply left it \nout.  You implied that ethyl alcohol is directly converted to acetate, \nwhile ignoring the intermediate rate-limiting step, which is the conversion \nof acetaldehyde to acetate. Anyway, I know all this because I'm half asian \nand I suffer from 12 hour long hangovers. Anyway protect your brain!!! \nHangovers are an indication that brain cells are dying!!! Check hangover \nproducts found on Amazon.com that prevent said brain cell genocide. I can \npersonally vouch for Hangtech and Drinkwel, but there are at least ten \nother products that can help... \ufeff",

That is why ethanol can act so \nquickly: it acts on the targets of neurotransmitter molecules in the brain, \nthus changing brain signalling. Also the damage that is caused to the liver \nand some other tissues if you get really drunk on regular occasions is \ncaused not by ethanol itself, but by Acetaldehyde. The correct pathway is: \nEthanol -> Acetaldehyde -> Acetate. So the damage effects of alcohol depend \nnot only on how we metabolize ethanol, but on how we metabolize \nAcetaldehyde and the latter is actually more important in this sense. Slow \nmetabolism of ethanol results in a stronger effect of alcohol (get drunk \nwith less alchol) and a high risk of getting an alcohol dependance. Slow \nmetabolism of Acetaldehyde leads to more health problems after drinking \nalcohol.\ufeff",
