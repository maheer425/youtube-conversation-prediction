Just Wayne's \nfacial reaction, the delivery of his response and his charge into battle \nmade the scene so effective, funny, and exhilarating at the same time.\n\nWith the 2010 version, it just felt like something was missing, but overall \nit captured the spirit and intentions the original book was going for.\ufeff",
