I can't join sports, be in sunlight for long, be outside in cool or \nwarm temperatures, sweat, or cry. it's also hard for me to take showers, \nswim, or eat/drink cold/hot things. I was diagnosed a couple years ago, \nwhen I had an anaphylactic reaction to cold. some of my symptoms can be \nsimilar to those of severe food allergies. since I do have breathing \nproblems sometimes, I have to carry an epi pen with me all the time. I am \ncurrently taking medicines 7 times a day. because of all this, I haven't \nbeen able to go to school in the past 6 weeks. (AKA: a ton of homework).

I have gone through this and have fond treatment that works!  \nI have suffered from endo since age 16 (I am now thirty) I have had two \nsurgeries to remove the endo cells they migrated to through my uterus, \nincluding around my lower bowel. Because they pooled there, I had extreme \npain having bowel movements, as well as during sex and menstruation \n(vomiting and double-over-cramps included). \n\nBUT, I have  an amazing gynecologist that suggested after my last surgery \n(age 21) that I take birth control on a continuous basis. This would \ninhibit you from ovulating every month, stopping menstruation that forms \nthe endo cells which attach them self to other areas in your body. When you \nmenstruate, these cells are \"told\" by hormones to inflame and \"shed\", as \nthey are supposed to in your uterus - but as you know, when they attache to \nother areas of your body, it causes blinding pain and complications. Take \nthe pill continuously = no menstruation = no no new formation of endo cells \n= no more PAIN! I have had numerous ultrasounds since, and no new \nendometriosis has formed since. I have  now been put on a three month on \npill, 7 days off to have a total of 4 menstrual cycles a year, and they \nhave been very manageable.

My buddies would come over, wrap me up & take me to \ntheir place for days, The  'miracle' treatments of the day (1980's) was \nsteroid hormone, major pain medications that I needed special authority \nfor, hysterectomies and laparoscopies - where the offending cells are \nlasered (burnt) wherever they might have gone a-wandering. I did all those \n(9 laparoscopic treatments in all). Things were  great for about 20 years. \nAt the beginning of my 50's, I started having episodes' similar (in that \nthey were episodic, but the pain was 'different')\nBy 55 I was living with daily chronic pain from those laparoscopies and the \nendometriosis - they both leave scar tissue which are adhesions much like \ncement that develop over time and can get worse with passing years. If they \nare 'band type adhesions' there is relief through surgery, but it will come \nback. If its 'cobweb' type, they cannot be removed surgically. There only a \nfew treatments out there, IMS, high-concentrations of vitamins injected \ninto trigger points and the only one that has worked for me 300 mg slow \nrelease opiate combined with 60 mg cymbalta everyday. And for keeping big \nflares down, IMS. And for getting my brain to hep instead of hinde, a TENS \nmachine, This get s me 4-8 hours a day of tolerable (as long as I dont \nengage is triggering activities. )I spent literally $10,000 on every \nconservative, alternative, & complementary treatment out there - and i live \nin a major city, diet, chinese medicine, homeopathy, yoga (ha!), infusions, \nACT massage, Shiatsu, I could go on & on. Activities got harder and harder \nto do - try and think of an activity that doesnt involve your abdomen or \npelvis. No cycling,playing tenni,  long walks, no dancing, no fencing no no \nexercise to get your hreat rate up. SO depression sets in, you may have to \nleave your job (I did) and its hard to maintain friendships because you \ncant do much. Grocery shopping, cooking and eating of food is herculean, so \nmany of us just dont. It can get to the 'granny diet' of tea & toast if \nyou're not careful. At present, there is no 'cure' or real research (that I \nknow of) as\n1) Its a womans health issue and 2) health authorities dont want to fund \nanything chronic at all - either physical, mental or emotional.\nI was an out-going, vital woman who loved her job - it's been a horrible \nblow and I am still working on it so dont have many words of wisdom or \nanything, but I'll tell you - Keeping friendships alive is the most \nimportant. Isolation is walking with the black dog. Do what you can when \nyou can. Be important/of benefit to another human being (volunteer or work \nif you can). A good therapist is a treaure (if you can afford one) - and \nsupport groups can be great places to offer/get support & share info.\nAnd remember it ok to get mad sometimes - at the illness or lack of medical \nsupport- but not at yourself. YOU didn't cause this.\ufeff",
