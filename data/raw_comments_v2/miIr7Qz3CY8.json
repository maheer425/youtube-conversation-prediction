Hours later in a different appartment, \nTed is telling his friend (we'll call him.. Bill!) about an idea for \nsomething. He mentions how guns are involved and tells his other friend \n(who is preparing toast) to remind him to get some guns. While distracted \nand looking away at Ted, he puts a gun in the toaster. So Ted picks up an \nunloaded gun (still acting out the idea from earlier) and tells his friend \nto stand up, knocking over a cup of water onto the outlet that the toaster \nis plugged into. With Bill standing up he puts the gun to his chest and \nacts out a person killing him (\"So then he's like 'YOU SON OF A BITCH!'\"). \nAt that moment, the toasters gun pops out and the electricity from the \nshorted out outlet ignites it. Shooting Bill in the process. Meanwhile \nanother friend playing video games (how about Jason?) hears Ted yelling \n''YOU SON OF A BITCH!'' and starts running over to see the dead body of \nBill, with Ted and Toaster Guy both acting like they killed him.\ufeff",
