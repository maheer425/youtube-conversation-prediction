And this is \nthe most developed we have been so far. In the future, how many things will \nhave developed and changed.\nWe are currently living in 2014, which is a long time away from 1 AD, yet \nso close. It has only been the 2000th year, how many more will there be?\nWe look back at (in no order) the celts, victorians, time of shakespeare \netc. and feel like those times were many many years ago, but they were only \nsomewhere in the 1000s and were in the 2000s. What about 3000s 4000s 5000s \netc. but how far away, or how close exactly are we to the beginning and end \nof life.\nSomeone in my class (im in seventh grade) told me that when the sun stops \nusing carbon dioxide as fuel, it will start on hydrogen, and i dont \nremember how, but somehow after this, the world will come to an end. He \nsaid we have aproximately 12000 years left, but i dont know how accurate he \nis.\nSo think about it, if people will live until the 12000s, we are actually \nquite near to the beginning of live, and they will think of us as old. And \nthinking about how much we have progressed and developed in 2000 years, \nimagine how much it will have changed in the 12000s. How will our lives \ncompare.\n\nAnd what will happen after that.\n\ufeff",
