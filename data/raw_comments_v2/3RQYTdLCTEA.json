            "text": "Although I love Jesse's videos and all, I did find evidence of this being \nfake. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't know how I feel about this. Jesse walked \nup to his mom and said he was apologizing for how he acted, unless \nabsolutely nothing happened in the last week and a half, she just \"went \nalong\" with it being about Thanksgiving and mentioned it herself before he \ndid. I'm skeptical about this since if I did this a week and a half ago, it \nwouldn't be the first thought in my mom's head if I came to apologize \n\"randomly\", anybody else find that weird? Or am I just too drunk/high atm?\ufeff",
