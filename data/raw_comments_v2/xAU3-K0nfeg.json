He just has so much fun \nflying around (once he even landed on my back, he sometimes tries flying \nonto my head - I won't take it as an insult that my head looks like a \nbird's nest). After a few days, he already let me carry him back to his \ncage using a stand he was used to (it's actually a small, flat cat \nscratching post - the surface is resistant, but cozy like a nest, and he \nloves taking naps on it). Once he got sleepy (lazy more like), I went to \nhim and used the stand, and he immediately got onto it. He is not used to \nhuman hands yet. He won't eat out of the hand, he doesn't want pets. I also \nhave no treats for him yet (they are not sold around here, so I'll have to \nmake some, once I learn how). So if you want to carry your bird around, \nright from the beginning, first place some flat surface, or a longer perch, \nnext to his cage that he can get onto. Once he gets comfortable with it, \ntry getting him to stand on it. You should NEVER wave it next to his head, \njust simply insert it below him, motioning upward to his feet. Use any \nqueue word you like. Or don't. I don't yet. I simply gesture to him. He \ndoesn't really listen to words yet. But he understands gestures.\ufeff",

You can keep your bird fully flighted as \nwell, IF your house is safe for it to fly around. Cover windows with \ncurtains, mirrors too. Close the toilet lid (it might fall in it and \ndrown). If you let it in the kitchen make sure there's nothing that it can \nget hurt in (a pot of boiling water might look like a nice bath for it, \nfumes coming from non-stick pans, oil can get on its wings and then it \nwon't be able to keep its body temperature at a proper level, etc). Make \nsure not to have any poisonous plants in the house. See what plants and \nfruits (avocado) are poisonous for Cockatiels. Make sure it has \"perches\" \n(furniture) that it can easily land on. So it has where to fly, otherwise \nit will hit the wall and probably crack its beak. Keep in mind Cockatiels \nare not vertical fliers.

One was old, \nand died a few years later, but the other was in the cage for like 6 years. \nMy parents and I felt really bad about leaving it in there for so long, and \nI constantly asked to let her out, but we never could because our new dogs \nwould kill them or they would shit all over our new furniture. A couple \nmonths ago, I convinced my dad to let me take her out. She was terrified, \nwe had to end up cornering her and pushing her out of the cage where she \nlanded on the floor, then she would go on our hand. She didn't want to be \npet, and everytime you tried to get her onto your hand she would bite you. \nA few days later, she began to open up and lightly wanted to be pet. About \n2 or 3 weeks later, I would stick my hand in her cage and she started to \nhesitantly come on it, without throwing a bf (bird fit). Now she loves to \nbe pet, she's always out of her cage (mostly by me, no one else really \ntakes her out) and she willingly climbs onto my hands, and sometimes \ndoesn't want to go back into her cage. She's opened up so much, it's \namazing.\ufeff",

Usually, bird will fly into walls and stuff, then \neventually learn how to fly. If you have a small cage in which they can't \nfly, of course they will get hurt. That's like living in a household and \nnever being able to talk and then someone telling you to talk. My bird is \nable to fly around safely, because she has a big enough cage that keeps her \nflying and us big enough for her to fly. Please do your research. Oh and \nsomeone said they will fly into ceiling fans? Why would you 1: have a \nceiling fan going even if your bird is just in the cage 2: why is the door \nopen so your bird can get hurt by the ceiling fan?",

It can happen so easily and quickly, the amount of rescues and \ntrainers I deal with that have had flight related injuries is unreal, cut \nand bruised ceres, broken beaks, broken necks, broken wings, not worth it. \nI'm quite happy to keep a bird free flighted wherever possible, like the \nlighter birds. Like I say I take my birds out with me, and although they \nare clipped they can still fly and keep a fairly good height, clipping a \nbird so badly it can't even catch itself when it falls is worse than \nleaving it free flighted, at least free flighted they can catch themselves \nif they fall, but clipping the ends of the first four primaries just stops \nthem picking up speed, it doesn't stop them flying completely, that is \ncruel I agree and dangerous.\n\nI just know that once you have a bird you love that much die in your arms, \nand you have that pure terror and dread running through the pit of your \nstomach and spend days crying your eyes out like the world has ended, you \nwould do anything in your power to prevent it happening again.",

My smaller \nbirds....the budgies....are fully flighted, as they bounce off the net \ncurtains and other covers on windows and mirrors, the bigger birds don't, \nI'm not losing another one to a broken neck, and if the choice is clip them \nand allow them to fly slower and lower around the house clipped (clipping \ndoesn't remove ability to fly as that is also dangerous when the bird \nplummets straight onto their keel bone), or have to keep them in their cage \nall the time to keep them safe in case they break their neck, I'd rather \nclip them and let them be free around the house. I also take my larger \nbirds out with me in harnesses, and if the harness fails for some reason \nI'm not risking them flying off and being eaten by a hawk.\n\nWhen you buy a larger bird and bond to it, they become your family, not \njust a pet or companion, and there is nothing worse than the soul \ndestroying event of losing a pet you love so much to terrible injuries when \nit could so easily have been prevented by clipping. I've seen bad clips \nwhere a lot more than the first primaries were taken and these should never \nhappen. I certainly prefer to keep a bird fully flighted where it is safe \nto do so as they do enjoy flying so much, but I will never forgive myself \nfor allowing my bird to die through being so irresponsible, you don't think \nit will happen, you don't think clipping birds is right so you don't clip, \nthen you watch your bird die a terrible painful death through your actions \nand you soon change your mind I can tell you, never again!",
