Then I had revelations how DC just kind of abandons a lot of \nits fans. Most humans liked TDK trilogy. But no, since Marvel is now a \nthreat, DC just has to start from the ground up so it can unite all of its \nheroes. This is not a bad thing at all, but that Batman has to start \nover... again! Why not just use the Nolan one that everyone loves? Why \nraise fan controversy with Ben Affleck? I don't hate the guy, but most \npeople do. So why choose him? Also, why not give each hero a movie? Why \nthrow them all into one movie with little to no development? Why stylize \nthe entire movie now, Snyder? Man of Steel tried so hard to make earth \nbelievable and realistic, but now it looks like Halloween Town. Sharp \nangles, odd colors, and I can't see shit. Is Batman's armor really \nkryptonite? That's retarded! Why can't it be a legit battle where Superman \nwins instantly? Why do Batman fantards always give him the stupid penalty \nof \"If he had enough prep time, he could beat anybody!\" If hanyone had \n\"enough prep time\" they would win, and it is not a real fight! Why can't \nSuperman just lazer-eye Batman's mouth area? Why is Wonder Woman here to \nadd to the fuster cluck? Why is the Joker such a miserable design? Snyder's \nmessing up everything, but he's proud of it! *LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS* \nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Zack_Snyder.jpg\ufeff",
