Usually \nafter birth the herd will try and get the newborn on its feet and it \nusually takes 30 minutes to an hour if the calf is strong. If it takes many \nmany hours the herd sadly has no choice and very difficulty decides that \nthe calf isn't strong enough and is putting the herd at risk because Lions \ncould pick up their scent and be on to them so they have to move and leave \nthe newborn.\n\nHumans can intervene because the Elephant population is so small that these \norphans if cared after and put back into the wild could help insure the \nintegrity of the species. Instead of having the elephant count drop lower \nthis helps create newer generations.",
