I always thought about drawing and math being \nrelated to architecture only. All these drawings look so realistic and 3D, \nand one doesn't have to be an artist to be able to draw these, one must \nonly know math techniques! This video really shows how curvatures, patterns \nand some geometry can lead to very cool visuals. By connecting the \ncrossings and making them distinct, it can lead to interesting shapes. \nAlso, the drawings relate to math in that these processes work every time. \nI also really like how you present three different \"doodle games\" that are \nrelated to math. However, the doodling was a little hard to follow. I tried \ndoing some drawings like this myself, but it was very hard to do what you \nwere doing because you went really fast. A question that I had when I was \nwatching this was whether the Olympic rings were created this way, as with \nmany other symbols we have today. Overall though, I really found this video \neye opening because it introduced a variety of mathematics to create \nappealing visuals. \ufeff",
