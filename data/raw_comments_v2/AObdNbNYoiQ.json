In this, \nit says something about 'made it over the mountains' and 'east german \nsweets', plus the witches outfit - so we can presume that they are in \nBavaria (south east Germany) right now. So far so good. Now, the entire \nseries takes pace in German speaking regions, so we must presume, although \nit is peresnted to us in English, that in-universe, they are speaking \nGerman with each other. (Like, in Lord of the Rings, everyone is speaking \nWestron, but it is presented to us as though Westron were our language, \nbecause no one wants to read a book were every single thing that is said \nneeds a translation footnote.)\n\nSo, this gets broken here, because the baker Lady clearly speaks English \nwith a German accent (I'm not counting previous butcherings of Karnstein as \nbreaking, bc I know they can not help it) and throws German words in - \nwhich she can't pronounce to save her life and it is amking my ears bleed \nand I am not forgiving that because this could have been avoided. And now, \nbecause they have broken the assummtion that the charekters are speaking \nGarman to oneanother, that raises the uncomfortable question of why they \ndon't. Laura is British in the book sure, but surely, if this school was so \nfar from her home it would have come up? And she would have strated to \nspeak German as well, after a few months there, anyway. And they can't all \nbe from forgein countrys, because that sure wasn't a super prestigious \nschool, worth moving to a different country to visit.\n\n... really, what I'm saying is the German Accent in her English makes no \nsense any way around and the English Accent in her German is unbreable and \nit was the worst decision, that this show ever made.\n\n....now that I think about it, saying that this accent is the worst thing \nabout the show, is probably a compliment at the end of the day.\ufeff",
