For someone who thinks calling someone \na \"girl\" is an insult, I could simply say that a man follows his words and \nthat'd be giving you a huge bitchslap, but as much as I love adding injury \nto insult, I've already stated previously that you're a bitch so this has \nalready been stated.\nMoreover trying to call me corny when you've been pulling everything from \nthe book CoD kids use to insult people is just being a hypocrite, then \nagain I've already called you on it.\nNotice a pattern there? I've long been predicting what you're gonna write \nbefore you do. That's how used your shit is. You literally can't come up \nwith anything new, yet still feel the need to keep it up as if you needed \nto prove something. You've even resorted to imitating me, which if you \nhaven't noticed (and I bet you haven't), means you accept that my responses \nto your pathetic attempts at offending someone are far superior to anything \nyour under developed brain could imagine.\nI didn't even comment on your \"this ain't even fun no more\" line \npreviously, but since you want to insist, OK. That's the classic response a \nbutthurt little crying kid gives when trying to pass off as a troll that \nhad a great time, when in reality he's raging like a teenage girl who \nwatches a Bieber critic video.\nNo I'm not calling you a teenage girl, just like I'm not calling you a 9 \nyear old boy. There's mental similarities but that's about it. Still, if \nthe shoe fits, and it does, wear it.\n\nINB4 another \"joke\" pulled straight from the CoD guide on how to make fun \nof people's family and/or sexual identity.\nI'd also say INB4 a kill yourself comment but you already added something \nlike that.",
