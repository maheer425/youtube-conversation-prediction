I'm sorry this is on such an old video, \nbut I have a question and it seemed to be the best place to ask: how \nsocially acceptable/unacceptable would it be to use training chopsticks \noutside of the home in Korea and Japan? I'm fairly proficient with using \nchopsticks, but I have carpal tunnel in both of my hands. Sometimes I can \ngo a whole meal without a problem, but a lot of the time I have to stop \nhalfway through a meal and transfer to a fork because I can no longer hold \nthe chopsticks properly. My \"training devices\" are a bit more discreet than \nthe ones in your video--they're just little, dime-sized clips that attach a \nfourth's way down the wide side of your chopsticks so they're affixed at an \nangle--but I can't seem to figure out if they'll be any more or less \nfrowned upon than just bringing a fork and spoon for those situations. It's \nnot really discussed in \"etiquette\" articles or videos (they usually just \nsay \"be sure to learn how to use them\" and leave it at that), but I want to \nknow ahead of time before I go abroad next year.\n\nThank you so much :)\ufeff",
