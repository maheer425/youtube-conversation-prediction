In what way is Muscovy not a Kievan state? \nIt was part of Vladimir, was founded by Daniel, son of Alexander Nevsky, \nwho was the prince of Vladimir and Novgorod; its people were East Slavs who \nspoke Old East Slavic, its law, Russkaja Pravda, was the same as the rest \nof the country. What is it about Muscovy that seems to scream \"I'm not \nKievan Rus\" to you?\n\n\nIn Ukraine, the old Rurikovich royal house lost power and the land became \npart of Poland, with a whole new government, official language and set of \nlaws. The Ukrainian nation today goes as far back as the Cossack Uprising, \nwhich saw the creation of an independent Ukraine. How exactly was this \nUkraine related to the principalities of Galicia, Volhynia, Chernigov and \nKiev? It's laughable of you to claim the Kievan legacy as yours, let alone \ndoing it on behalf of Belarus, which is even more far-fetched.\n\n\nCome on, you folks have given us Sergey Korolyov, Nikolai Amosov and Taras \nShevchenko. Why are you still so insecure about your national identity that \nyou feel the need to make up history and \"facts\" about your neighbours? \nIt's just ridiculous what some of you Ukrainian nationalists do, and I'm \nnot even Russian.",

Normans really played a huge role in the \ncreation of the state and gave rise to the Rurik dynasty.\nThe second most important theory of the origin of the name of the state and \nthemselves Rus is a theory which states that the name comes from the river, \na tributary of the Dnieper, called Ros. Rosie called inflow tires. On the \nterritory of Volyn in Ukraine there is a river Roska ... Consequently, \nRussia could be named after rivers.\nScientists from the US Pritsak advanced the theory that the Khazars founded \nKievan Rus. But why then was separated from Rus? After all, the state of \nthe Khazars was as large as Russia.\nThe history of Kievan Rus has a lot of facts that are simply forced to \ncreate their own state of Rus. First of all, historians believe that it was \nthe emergence of feudal relations contributed to the creation of the state, \nas in all other European countries. Then it must be said that our ancestors \nhad to defend against enemies, most important of which were the Khazar \nKhanate and Byzantium. Joint ethnic origin only united Rus more. The \ndevelopment of trade also made to establish a state of Rus. As for Kiev, he \ndue to economic and geographical position has come to play an important \nrole in relations with other states.\nScientists say that formed around Kievan Rus in the 9th century AD. It was \nthen and there was a state with its center in Kiev. The heyday of Russia \ntook place in the period 978-1054 years, when Russia has significantly \nexpanded its territory and reached both political and cultural development. \nThe third period is characterized by the disintegration of the state into \nseparate principalities.\n\nRussian remember this tragedy because 300 years have had to endure the \nMongols. Western Russian principalities lost their independence and lay \ndown under the Lithuanians and Poles. This part of Russia until 1992 never \nhad independence. They broke away from Russ but did not become an \nindependent state and independent nation. Eastern Russian principalities \npreserved state and the army under the presence of the Mongols. First save \n.... then chased Mongolia and strengthen and expand Russ. The western part \nof Russ (UKRAINE) consolidated and expanded only due Combined with RUSSIAN \nAND RUSSIA.",

But \nlets be honest, no nation is safe from them, assholes are everywhere; \nincluding Russia. But the worst part is that most of the government are \nassholes, and that's a soft word to describe them. In Russia, the \ngovernment is extremely corrupt. But the reason Russians as people support \nthe government is because they cannot see that it is corrupt. Russia is \nstill mostly isolated from any other countries, maybe not literally but \nculturally. Over all the years that people have been trying to conquer \nRussia we've earned a kind of distrust to people other than our own. The \ngovernment uses that to their advantage through heavy propaganda. Since the \ninternet is mostly censored (maybe not directly, but it is) the only source \nof information about anything around them is the TV which is controlled by \nthe government. They make up fake news, stories and don't forget to praise \nour government as 'saviors' and 'heroes'. When that sort of information is \npoured into someone everyday, they become brainwashed into fully trusting \nthat everything is right with Russia and there is everything wrong with \nother countries. The genius part of the propaganda is that Russians believe \nthat everyone else is brainwashed to think that Russians are brainwashed. \nSo if you try to reason with someone thats brainwashed, they will think YOU \nare brainwashed. And well, the same propaganda tells us America is bad, \nplus the government really doesn't like it since America is pretty much an \nequal to them, and they don't want equals they just want to be better than \nthe rest. Which explains why pretty much on every war and conflict around \nthe world today, you can see Russia and America on opposite sides. Sorry if \nthat was a bit long.",
