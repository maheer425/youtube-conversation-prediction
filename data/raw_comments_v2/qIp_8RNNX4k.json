To clarify, i think animals \nshould be treated as well as we can. But when it comes to food, we have to \neat. I work on a ranch and have worked on many farms.\n\nWhen dealing with cattle, me and my fellow ranch hands treat them well, \ntake care of them when their sick, and make sure that their comfortable. If \nthey go to the slaughter house my hope is that they'll be well treated \nuntil their slaughtered, and when they are, its as quick and painless as \npossible.\n\nThe fact is animals aren't humans, even if we are a part of the animal \nkingdom. It is morally wrong to hurt an animal for no reason in my books, \nbut killing animals for food is not. Animals kill animals and eat them. \nWe're just doing what is natural, the only diffrence is we've got the \nability to breed animals for food instead of just hunting them, and grow \ncrops for food.\n\nAs for my hunting, lets say i decide not to kill a deer. Whats going to \nhappen to that deer is its going to grow old, get slow, and be mauled to \ndeath by another animal and eaten anyway. When i kill it, its instant and \npainless, when another animal kills it, its gonna be a lot more painful.\n\nAm I saying that the way that animals are treated when their being grown in \nslaughterhouses doesn't need to be looked at? Not at all. But at the end of \nthe day, comparing that to the holocaust or any genocide is disrespectful \nto the people who suffered and died.",

All exploitation of beings, idiotically justified by the \nexcuse that they are \"lesser\" or \"different\" from us (which is what the \nnazi's said about the jews, blacks, etc,) is yet another example of \ndiscrimination and murder.

More than \n10,000 Jews arrive there daily. March 20, 1941, deadline for entering the \nGhetto, Eddict 44/91 established a closed Jewish district south of the \nVistula River. All Jews from Krakow were forced from their homes and \nrequired to crowd into sixteen square blocks. The Jewish people thought it \nwas a refuge until later they would be sent to the furnaces and their \nbodies would be burned and laid in huge graves.\nThe Jewish council comprised of 24 elected Jews were personally responsible \nfor carrying out the orders of the regime in Krakow, such as drawing up \nlists for work details, food, and housing.\nLiquidation of the Ghetto occurred March 13, 1943. Jews sick in hospitals \nwere poisoned right before the German\u2019s came in and started shooting them \nas they lay in their beds, they knew they were going to die. So many were \nhiding, children were many even hid in the outside latrines in fear of \ntheir lives. Men were told to stand in a line where they were shot from \nfront to back. Both women and men clothes were removed and ran naked, heads \nwere shaved before they would enter the doors where they were gassed to \ndeath. Chujowa Gorka, April, 1944 Department D orders goeth to exhume and \nincinerate the bodies of more than 10,000 Jews who were killed at Plaszow \nat the Krakow Ghetto Massacre. \nSchindler made a list of over 800 Jews which he wanted to save to work in \nhis factory. The men made it safely to his hometown, but the women were \nsent to another concentration camp at Auschwitz. When Schindler got wind of \nthis he drove there to try to get his Jews returned to him, and he did. He \nmade laws that there would be no executions, no interfering with factory \nworkers or German soldiers would be imprisoned. For the seven months the \nfactory was operational, Schindler\u2019s Brinnlitz Munitions Factory was a \nmodel of non-production. During this same period he spent millions of \nReichmarks to sustain his workers and bribe Reich officials.\nThen the day came when United States President Eisenhower declared the war \nwas over. The German war was at an end, so Schindler announced to the \nJewish people who survived after midnight they would be free. He also told \nthem that he would be hunted because he used slave labor to make money. \nMany tears were shed by him because he wished he had saved more Jews.\nAmon Goeth was arrested while a patient in a sanitarium at Bad Tolz and was \nhanged by the neck until he was dead at Krakow for crimes against humanity.\nOscar Schindler failed at his marriage and several businesses after the \nwar. In 1958 he was declared a righteous person by the council of Yad \nVashem in Jerusalem, and invited to plant a tree in the Avenue of the \nRighteous.\ufeff",
