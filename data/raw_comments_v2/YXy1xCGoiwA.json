So student council will give the proposal to school , Of \ncos we need to do a proper proposal like what the purpose of the event and \nhow we going to make it and of cos how we get the fund. I was one of the \nthe student council member on my 2nd year. What I remember the events we \nheld are\n1. Valentine days : we invite kids from 3orphanage, and share some love. \nWeeks before we try to socialize our event to entire student, collect lots \nof loves from students that wants to share in any kind of way. Can be goods \nlike books or toys or blanket, or event performance so they can be happy \nand enjoy the days.\n2. we had 'pensi' which is almost the same with the one martina show in \nthis video, but we open the gate to public and selling the ticket. So \nfriends from other shool, parents or family can come.\n3. Prom for the 3rd year. Yes the student council(normally 2nd year and1st \nyear) prepared the party for the senior who will leave the school and start \ntheir whole new world out there.\n4. And evry time student council needs money to support some clubs that \nneeds to compete out there and of cos it needs money, we do some commercial \nevent as in we held bazaar, make some booth, prepare some space. Student \ncan rent the booth and sell food or merchandise like collector stuff, there \nis one student event rent a space to do exhibition of his stamp colection. \nIn this event u can order some song and dedicates the song for someone \nelse. It can be your crush, ur bffs, or fave teachers and the broadcast \nclub will read your msg. Of cos u need to pay for it ;). Its almost the \nsame like pensi.\n5. We had sport festival. Each class have to send their delegates to join \nand competes in varies kind of sport. \n\nIt was fun!! Damn i want to go back to those time.\ufeff",

At my school, the \nteachers aren't friendly and some don't even try engaging the students.  \nIt's awkward and it's one of the reasons why the American education system \nis going backwards.  Some students in the U.S. feel like school is the \nenemy esp. if they don't have a good teacher or don't have the resources to \nsucceed.  Also, American students have a bad attitude towards learning in \ngeneral.  I hope it will change someday.\ufeff",

            "text": "You have to find something to work for, something that encourages you. Like \ntake a challenging class, or join the band or a club. Can't find something \nyou like? Make one! You need something to motivate you such as passing an \nAP test or learning a new instrument. \nFind people who support you and who make you feel good being yourself. \nSounds cheesy and phrases and cliche, but it's so true!\nMost importantly, remember that high school is ONLY 4 years of your ENTIRE \nlife. In the long run, what happens in high school usually doesn't \ndetermine your entire future. They really make it seem like it might, but I \nreality things like not passing a class or being bullied, there's always a \nway around everything. Obviously, keep yourself out of trouble!! Young \npeople always think they're indestructible, but we're not. Small mistakes \nand bumps may not hurt your entire life, but other things can. So be \nsmarter than that! If it something feels wrong, then most likely it is. If \nyou want to get anywhere in your life you have to make the right choices or \nat least understand that EVERYTHING has a consequence- some are good, some \nare bad. You have to think about the results of things before you do them \nbecause some things can really sting and close a lot of doors for you! Of \ncourse, like I said, if you mess up its not the end of the world. Just own \nyour mistakes, don't be discouraged and work around it. It's going to be \nokay. :)\n[ I hope I'm making sense...]\n\nLISTEN TO YOUR ELDERS! And by elders, I mean teachers, and mentors and your \nparents. They DO know what they're taking about trust me. They've been \nthrough more than you have, not just in experience, but in education. They \nknow what they're doing! You may not. So trust those who are there to help \nyou. Find a teacher or counseled you can trust and they'll help you. Asking \nfor help doesn't mean you're stupid. It's actually the smartest thing to \ndo! Asking for help means that you want to do better and that you're trying \nto improve- and that means a lot! Successful people have NEVER made it on \ntheir own! They've always had some help to become who they are- so you need \nsomeone to help you through too, we all do~\n\nHigh school is NOT about popularity, or being cool, or just having fun. It \ncan be fun, but you have to remember the most important part of it. its \nabout work! It's about preparing yourself. Because after those 4 short \nyears, you're going to have your entire life left! And you have to be ready \nfor a thise years you have left! That's why you can't waste your precious \ntime. Find something to work towards. If college/ university isn't a \npossibility or your thing, there's no shame in going for a community \ncollege or vocational career. Or about going straight to work in something \nthat you're passionate about. Success isn't always about money. Sometimes \nit's about simply doing something you love or doing something that make you \nand others feel good. There's lots of options out there, just be smart \nabout it! ;)\n\nI'm honestly not the greatest at giving advice. But as a high school senior \nwith three weeks to graduation and a few months to going to dream college, \nI thought I'd share a few things that helped me get by. Don't lose hope. \nAnd if you do, talk to someone. There will always be someone out there who \nwill listen. I understand, I've been the cynical skeptic teenager who \nthinks NO ONE UNDERSTANDS! But someone out there does. \n\nBe who you think you should be, and don't let other people put down your \ndreams. If you think you can do it, work for it and you can! But that's the \nbig part- WORK. That's the only way you'll achieve anything- you have to \nput blood, sweat and tears into it, no matter what you do.\nI hoped I helped even a little, and good luck in high school and beyond! ;)\n\n- with love also from California, C \u2764\ufe0f",

Get the conservatives out of prison \nagain!\" and then they changed the system in a way that makes it really hard \nfor a second party to get established which gives the Japanese the choice \nbetween weird conservatives and incompetent other options (because \neverybody with some political talent will join Abe's party). So you've got \na government that is elected because it's the only acceptable option and \nnot because the people agree with that party.\n\nSo you've got the Korean government in arresting Japanese journalists for \nno real reason and you've got the Japanese government being general dicks \nand denying 2nd or 3rd generation Koreans living in Japan citizenship which \nmakes the dicks in Korea (the government) going even more crazy. Japan has \na better relation to North Korea than South Korea for that reason. Because \ngiant dicks don't get along with giant dicks and the Kim dynasty is more \nabout sucking giant dicks and being a little (fat) dick.\n\nAnd that's all we see in the news. And then we might also see the internet \ncrazyness where Japanese people are racist dicks on 2chan (like we are on \n4chan) and the Koreans on whatever they use for such things.\n\nBut I don't think that the Japanese legitimately hate the Koreans or vice \nversa.
