Once seated you cross your arms across your chest. You \nthen SLOWLY bend over like in the crash position they tell you to get in \nwhen a plane is going down. Once bent over as far as you can you hold your \nbreath and GENTLY squeeze your stomach muscle for a period of 2-5 seconds \n\"like your trying to squeeze the air out\" then release and breath out \nagain. Do this two or three times then SLOWLY raise back up to a seating \nposition. Everyone I have shown this technique to has see their hiccups \ndisappear instantly. Please be advised I AM NOT A DOCTOR so do this \ntechnique at your own risk and care should be taken if you have any illness \nthat can prevent you from bending over or holding your breath.\ufeff",
