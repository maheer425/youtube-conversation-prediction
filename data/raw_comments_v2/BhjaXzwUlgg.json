The honda has much less torque down low until \nyou wind it up just like a period 4 cyl Honda MC. It sounds great too! The \ntorque curve on the boxer Toyota is much flatter with good HP over a wider \nrange. It sounds growly like a BMW MC. The Toyota won the first ever 24 \nhour Fuji endurance race and many more after that besting the Hondas whose \naerodynamic design could not reach the top speed or get the fuel mileage at \nclose to 100mph as needed. Weighed less too. Both great period cars. I will \ntell you that the Toyota engine is much much simpler and easier to keep \nrunning right and to rebuild it. It was a lesson in a flat engine sitting \nlow under a low hood making it slippery in the wind. Scott",
