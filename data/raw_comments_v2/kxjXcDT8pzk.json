Low or no taxes hurts schools, emergency services, \nhospitals, road crews, police, farmers, water systems, and all other forms \nof public services. These are the things that the people need to maintain a \nquality lifestyle. This is why Republicans lower taxes to take that stuff \naway from the 99%. You also say unemployment is low in 16 out of 20 \nrepublican states. Those states are probably also right to work states as \nwell. Unemployment is low in those states, because welfare pays better than \nthe average job. Why would you look for a job when you can't do better than \n$10/hr? Since the taxes are little to nothing, school districts can't \nafford to hire good teachers. This creates bad schools with a less \nintelligent populous which creates no demand for good paying, skilled jobs. \nSince those states have no taxes they cant use tax incentives to lure those \nbusinesses either. The republican states don't really want to cut spending. \nThey have to, because all the welfare recipients cause those states to be \nnet loss to the taxpayers. They are in a downward spiral that can't be \nstopped, and the rest of the country is being drug down with them. You also \nmentioned the deficit. That will always go up. The number doesn't matter. \nWhat matters is how much is being spent in relation to the size of our \neconomy.
