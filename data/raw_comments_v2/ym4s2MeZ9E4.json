Rather, the thing they should be testing is health effects of both. \nThe reason people are against GMO isn't so much because they don't like the \nidea of genetically modified plants so much as they know that pesticides \nare toxic and artificial growth hormones/ripening agents can have adverse \naffects. I hear that Oranges aren't always orange, sometimes they have to \nbe artificially treated to get that color. People don't like that kind of \ndeception, or having those chemicals it's treated with get into the food. \nBy the way, pick a different text color so they don't blend in with the \ncolor of the table.\ufeff",
