We would like very much to \nhave exact reports of the experiments made at Bagatelle and hope that you \nwill draw up for us a correct list of the trials and give us a description \nof the flying machine and a drawing of same.\n\nWe had already seen by the picture in the New York Herald that the airplane \nrests on three wheels and we deduce from this that Mr. Santos Dumont, in \norder to effect his take-off, has first to make a run over a long level \nfield. With the aid of the starting-off pillar that we use, Orville and I \nspeedily go right up into the air in a much more practical fashion.\n\nNow, in view of the fact that the French consider a 220 meters flight in a \nstraight line over the ground to be a \u2018sensational performance\u2019, we are \nsure to find a lot in our favor if we come to exhibit in France; but the \nvoyage and the transportation of the machine and the pillar cost much more \nmoney than the two poor mechanics can afford to spend; also, dear Captain \nFerber, if French experts, under your management, desire to come to Dayton, \nwe will give them a demonstration of the machine in a neighboring field, \nflying for five minutes in a complete circle and let them have an option of \nthe performance and release of the machine, for $50.000, cash down.\n\nYours truly, \n \nWilbur Wright.\u201d\ufeff",
