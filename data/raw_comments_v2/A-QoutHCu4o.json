Other mathematically-minded people use the term \"non-countable\". \nCompare that to the set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...). This is not a \n\"stacked\" infinity - if i were to cut the set into two different sets, one \ngoing from 1 to 50, the other from 51 to infinity, one of the sets is no \nlonger infinite. Again, to reiterate, if I do this to the set of all real \nnumbers between 0 and 1, I get two, new sets, both of which are infinite in \nand of themselves.

If you want x+1>x for all x, then you can divide both sides \nby x to get (x+1)/x > 1 for all x. But if you take the limit as x \napproaches infinity of (x+1)/x, you can either cancel an x or use \nL'hopital's rule. The limit equals one, so then we get that x approaches \nx+1 when x approaches infinity (and, if it were possible, would reach it at \nx=infinity). This can be done for any x+a compared to x, where a is an \narbitrary number.",

Rather \nthan drawing lines to random decimals lets do this: Count every tenths \nplace number, then every hundredths place number, then every thousandths \nplace number and so on. Start with 0.1 then go to 0.2, 0.3 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, \n0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. Now that we have run out of tenths place decimals to \ncount, go to the hundredths place. 0.01, 0.02, 0.03...0.10, 0.11, 0.12, \n0.13.....0.98, 0.99. Then just go to the thousandths place and so on. I \nhave just counted all the numbers between 0 and 1. Therefore the infinity \nhe describes is \"equal\" to the infinity of every real integer. I could also \ncount all rational numbers between 0 and 2 this way, except I have to \nalternate. So I would go 0.1, then 1.1, 0.2, 1.2, 0.3, 1.3, and so on (or \nsomething similar). The infinity that is ACTUALLY larger is if i were to \ncount all rational numbers between 0 and infinity. It's hard to explain but \nlets use the alternating method. I go 0.1, 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1.....and \nso on. The problem is by the time I get around to doing 0.2, I've already \nused up my infinity because there are infinite integers that I have to \ncount the tenths place for. This means I need an infinite number of \ninfinities to count EVERY rational number.\ufeff",
