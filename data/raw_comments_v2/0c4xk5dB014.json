Even if they reached 100% efficiency they would still not \nproduct as much as that which is wasting energy. Point being it's not just \nabout how efficient something is but how much power it can make. Solar \nlooks like the best solution, but I am not sure how long solar panels last, \nand if they last 10 years that means the source of electricity is materials \nand sun, and then getting these materials should be factored in too. Long \nstory short if solar panels last a long time than they will use less \nmaterials than other forms of electricity, and if they can be designed to \noutput great volumes of energy than as far as I can tell they are the best \nenergy source. But if they produce very low amounts of electricity than \nthis is not a solution long term unless ways to improve the output is \nfound. Point is it's not just about efficiency.\n\nA lot of the reasons machines running on steam are designed to only be 25% \nefficient is because if they were running at full power the machines would \nliterally rip apart due to the speed. Now I am all for change, don't miss \nunderstand me. I just think we need a clean way that uses very little \nmaterials, creates no pollution, and needs little to no maintenance, while \ngenerating a lot of electricity.

There's at least half a dozen promising nuclear \nreactor designs that are far safer and far more efficient just waiting for \nthe right bureaucrats to give them the okay for full scale testing.\n\nI also wish you wouldn't call solar panels 'non-polluting' the materials in \nthem are extremely toxic just like the materials in nuclear reactors are \nextremely radioactive. You could say that's different because we can just \ncollect and properly dispose of the solar panels, but we already do that \nwith nuclear materials so you'd look kinda of hypocritical.\ufeff",

Reactor use of \nTh requires irradiating it before use. Although we might be able to process \nprotactinium-233 to avoid U-232. But that produces U-233 which could be \nused in nuclear weapons!

That is the time of day where solar shines. \nYou are off base on your other points as well. 99% of Solar for residence \nand commercial is tied to the grid (the energy is NEEDED and used \nimmediately by the grid.) A homeowner or business excess power is exported \nto the grid during the day earning a credit and the homes/business imports \nenergy (charge)  when their panels are not producing like at night.  In our \nstate solar rates are much cheaper than the utility company rates.  We save \nmoney, lessen our footprint and help reduce our states dependence on coal, \nfossil fuels and nuclear.  \n\nThe planet lives because of the sun, winds, tides and currents - those are \nthe sustainable and intelligent choices for energy.  \n\nAs far as solar efficiency, the system on the space station has solar \ntechnology with incredible efficiencies. However,  economics and project \nneed dictate the use of the least expensive solution to do the job (such as \npowering a home). Things will continue improving and the future will be \npowered by the sun.     \ufeff",

You certainly want your energy source to \nbe as efficient as possible, but comparing the efficiency of the energy \nconversion, and then concluding that one source is better than another \nbased on that is bullocks. \"Look, this plant wastes less sunlight than this \nplant wastes chemical energy from carbon\". What does that even mean? \n\nIf it turns out that solar power is more cost efficient, or area efficient, \nor something like that, you can really claim that it's better. You \ncertainly want more efficient solar panels to get there, but you don't do \nit by comparing energy efficiency. \ufeff",
