I \nallow the momentum of my car to keep me going through the turn, but using a \nbit of gas to maintain speed is fine. Reason is when your car is turning, \nthe tires must prevent your car from going in a straight line, thus \nexerting a centripetal force. The tires have plenty to do just to keep you \nfrom spinning out. By accelerating, you stress the tire grip even more by \nforcing the tires to both hold your car in the turn at a faster speed and \ntransmit engine power to the road. On slippery roads that is how you can \neasily spin out.",

If you haven't had to stop (say for example on a curve), then you \nshould slow down before you turn and then 1/2 way through the turn begin to \naccelerate.  \n\nIt's important to slow down enough to make the turn\u2026 if you're going too \nfast while in the turn then accelerating will only make it harder to keep \nthe turn.
