When \nlaning with Vayne you have to play careful and make sure you don't fall too \nfar behind so you can be more useful to your team later than the enemy ADC \nsince you're simply stronger than them with equal items.\n\nLucian is one of the strongest (if not THE strongest) ADCs during laning \nphase along with Corki and Caitlyn. He works with just about every support \nand should generally dominate his lane opponent (unless its Corki, who can \nmatch his early game harass, or Caitlyn who simply outranges him) He has a \ngapcloser/escape and good burst damage and is more of an allround adc. You \nreally can't go wrong with Lucian.\n\nTL:DR: Lucian for a very strong laning phase and mid game, falls off \nslightly during late game compared to hyper carries like Vayne, Kog'maw or \nTwitch. Vayne if you don't mind playing safely early, scaling very well \ninto late game and wrecking the enemy team with your overwhelming damage \noutput.\n ",

He may have been a bit too safe \nfrom his release state to patch 4.12. He may have been a tad bit broken in \n4.12, but since 4.13 even with the mobility increase having a range of 500 \nis just too low. too easy for almost every marksman to have auto dominance. \nAnd now with patch 4.18 they gave his mobility a manna cost, making him a \nshort range ADC who's means of working around this go OOM way to fast. I \nhave two main suggestions I want Riot to consider. The first, what feels \nlike a necessity, is for his auto range to be increased to 525. This is on \npar with Graves, and many other ranged champions such as Twisted Fate and \nOrianna. The second, more along the lines of hopeful thinking, is a more \nbalanced way to bring back his slow removal. What I propose is that the \nslow removal is tied to his passive, and can be triggered by his E every 12 \nseconds and this time can't be affected by CDR. Summoners, we can't sit by \nand watch a great champion be completely gutted. He needs some kind of \nhelp, we need to say something\ufeff",
