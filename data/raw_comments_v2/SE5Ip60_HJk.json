Sometimes it's not that easy.\n\nYou've got depression that comes on due to vitamin deficiencies. That can \nbe really difficult if you don't realize where it's coming from. It can be \ndifficult to figure out, though often a doctor can help you pinpoint that.\n\nYou've got chemical and hormone imbalances, and those can be the worst, \nespecially if treatment fails you. I had an ovary removed and for months \nafter I would cry without provocation. I didn't know how to fight it \nbecause there seemed to be no real cause. I talked to people, to doctors, I \ndownloaded apps on my phone that sent encouraging steps for me to take \nagainst depression.\n\nYou might say, \"oh well, you had a reason didn't you? Major surgery, that's \nunderstandable.\" But the thing is: it doesn't just come from nowhere. \nEveryone has their reasons. Just because you don't understand it doesn't \nmake it less real. \n\nIf you've always been able to fight it, then congratulations. That's \nwonderful. But expecting that everyone's mental state is like yours and can \nbe handled if they take the exact same steps you do is the very definition \nof being self centered, being unable to see things from another's point of \nview. I'm not saying that you have an obligation to take care of such \npeople, or even to be their friend. But don't lash out at them just because \nyou don't understand.\ufeff",

            "text": "Explaining Depression To Those Who Just Don't Get It.\n \nIn terms of where misunderstandings arise, people are trying to understand \ndepression within the limits of their own experience and what they can \nimagine what\u2019s happening to themselves, the chief difficulty with \ndepression is that people tend to confuse depression the emotion & \ndepression the illness. Because everybody knows what it\u2019s like to feel \ndepressed they assume they can imagine what it\u2019s like being depressed, or \nthey make a link between the two which doesn\u2019t exist.\n \nThe chief difference is; depression the emotion will come up like any other \nemotion then go away- emotions are fleeting they don\u2019t last, you will feel \nan emotion in response to something and after a while it will go away cause \nyou\u2019re going to respond to something else or something new will come up and \nyour emotions will change in response to that.\n \nEmotions to a certain degree you have control of, like actors get paid to \ncontrol their emotions. There are certain things you can do to influence \nyour emotions say if you\u2019re feeling really sad or down in the dumps there \nare things you can do to make you feel better, like someone telling you to \ngo for a walk or take a bath, the things they would do if they are \ndepressed, the trouble is that doesn\u2019t work for being depressed, because \nbeing depressed is a state of being- it\u2019s something that is continuous and \nit lasts a long period of time, to be diagnosed you have to be depressed \nfor 2 weeks or an extended period of time & it\u2019s not something that you can \ncontrol through your own volition , you can try to influence it to a \ncertain degree & it\u2019s true going for a walk might be quite nice & do you \ngood for a while but the effect will not last.\n \nPeople have a neutral state of being, a normal feeling of contentment, \nimagine a graph  where happy is high and average[neutral]is the middle & \n sad is low, most people are in the middle where they are going along, they \nsometimes go up or sometimes go down but they will always come back to that \naverage, that neutral state in the middle.\n \nSomeone with depression as an average which is much lower than what a \nhealthy person would be feeling, So say when a healthy person gets upset \ngoing along the middle line they do something to make them feel better and \nbrings them back up to that standard and they carry on. Someone with \ndepression is going along at this lower level and something happens to make \nthem sad they go down even further, and if they do something to try and \ncheer themselves up like go for a walk or reading a book, it might lift \nthem up even over their standard but in the end they will always come back \ndown to that low standard and carry on.\n \nWhat you can\u2019t do with depression to raise your standard[low]just by doing \nthings you enjoy although it may alleviate some of your negative emotions \nyou\u2019re getting, it won\u2019t have a lasting effect. The standard you come back \nto is still going to be lower than somebody who is healthy and that\u2019s \nsomething a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate. I\u2019m not saying that you do \nsomething you enjoy or find relaxing won\u2019t help, it may last a while after \nbut if you have depression the illness you will come back down to feeling \nrubbish, inevitably.\n \nIf you want to change the way that you are, normally it\u2019s either therapy, \nmedication or both. It\u2019s true that depression can arise as a result of \nsomething and that is like the emotion depression, in the same way the \nemotion depression can happen as a result of an event & you feel crap for a \nwhile. That won\u2019t cause you clinical depression; if an event does cause \nclinical depression than by default that event would be significantly \ndistressing because you don\u2019t get clinical depression from a broken \nrelationship, if you do then it certainly means there was an underlying \nproblem to begin with and it was bound to surface sooner or later, It just \ntook that event to set it off. \n \nAlso its true that environment and circumstances plays an important role \nbut everyone is exposed to that and not everyone gets clinical depression; \nthere as to be a predisposition  if you\u2019re going to develop it. The main \nthing you need to stress for somebody to understand this is there is a \nclear distinction between depression the emotion and depression the disease \n[illness]. Depression the emotion which will come and go to a certain \ndegree you can influence it, depression the illness is a constant state of \nbeing and it\u2019s something you cannot choose to stop feeling, you can try and \ndo something to make you feel better  but it won\u2019t last.\n \nPeople are often dismissive of depression telling you to \u201cPull your socks \nup\u201d, \u201cGet over it\u201d, \u201dStop wallowing\u201d because they think that what\u2019s \nhappened is you have a healthy level of being which is normal or neutral \nand that you dropped down for whatever reason and your trying to keep \nyourself there like your just wallowing in your misery, self-pity & \nindulging in attention seeking, & that your keeping yourself down, whereas \nif you just \u201cSnapped out of it\u201d you would go back to your normal state, but \nthe fact is if you have depression your norm will not be in the middle \nbetween happy and sad, your norm [neutral] is going to make you feel like \nrubbish, you can try to make yourself feel better for a while  but you\u2019re \nalways going to come back to feeling miserable and it\u2019s not something you \ncan change through will power.\n \nYou cannot snap out of depression no more than you can snap out of the flu \nbecause it\u2019s much more serious than a temporary alteration in your \nemotional state. If you wanted to change you have to address the \npsychological issue that might be a co-existing mental illness or your \nreaction to a certain trauma or a biological issue that\u2019s causing it, for \nexample your brain cannot regulate your emotions in the way that it should \nor both, in any case it is perhaps influenced by a traumatic event or \nstressful circumstances or a biological disposition to develop it, \ndepression does run in families and there is a certain genetic influence \ngoing on there.\ufeff",

You were at a bad spot in life and you were able to \nget out of it through hard work and determination. That's great for you. \nHowever, by assuming that all depression is like yours you only perpetuate \nstigmas about mental illness and especially TRUE (for lack of a better \nword) depression (clinical depression). I have have been diagnosed from \nmany different doctors over the years with having major depression as well \nas a host of other, serious mental health problems. I could tell you my \nwhole story, but all you NEED to know is that you should NEVER tell someone \nwho is clinically depressed it's \"all in your head\" or believe that, like \nyou, they can \"snap out of it\". Those things are NOT true for clinical \ndepression. NOT. AT. ALL. Saying those things will only make you sound \nincredibly ignorant and can make the person feel worse. It takes me about \n1.5-3 hours EVERY morning to get out of bed. And that's if I actually CAN \nget out of bed that day. It takes me 1.5-3 hours JUST to get mentally \nprepared to deal with how much of a struggle it is to just do daily tasks \nlike take a shower, eat, brush my teeth, etc. Then,when you add on going to \nclasses and having to socialize (I also have severe social anxiety that, \nthanks to the right medicine and therapy, I am able to block a lot of it \nout) it can become such a high, insurmountable wall that simply getting \nover it takes ALL the energy you have available to you that day. So you \nimmediately go home and get in your bed and/or stay in your room the rest \nof the day. Just because you used all your allotted energy for the day \ndoing just the necessities.\n\nClinical depression is much different than the situational depression you \nexperienced. I hope that my post will help you realize it. The only way to \nend the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental illness is through \neducation. Please, do some research on your own into what major depression \nis and how it effects the person suffering with it, as well as learning the \nbest ways to help, and how to approach talking about it with, the person \nwho suffers from major depression disorder (clinical depression).",

What the teacher said I honestly didn't think was that bad. \nI've had teachers do way worse and it never made me want to stand up and \npreach to the classroom. And even though I'm not in High School anymore, \nI'm still in college and I just felt that this video was not realistic to \nme. NOT that it has to be, but I felt like that was the direction they were \ngoing. I've had teachers humiliate me for being late, and honestly I would \nof appreciated it a lot if they did what the teacher did instead of what \nthey've done with me. They made me stand up in front of the class and \napologize to the class and I had to write my name on the board, stay after \nclass. You know that type of teacher that would say you're grades out \nloud... Just every humiliating thing you can possibly do that I don't want \nto go into right now but they would do this shit to the quietest fucking \ngirl in the classroom because they knew she wouldn't say or do shit. And \nyes I got the message I just felt like they could of done a better job at \nmaking it more real. ",
