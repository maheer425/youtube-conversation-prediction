And how would he know how to input incredibly complex \nequations so quickly on a prehistoric computer even if he knew how to type? \nEven today 98% of drivers don't know how to drive stick shift. Why? Because \nthey don't need to! So why does an engineer know how to type so well? I \nknow, I'm just having fun. I love this movie but that always bugged me. \nThat and the fact that a Bird of prey landed in a park and no one bumped \ninto it or saw a helicopter lowering huge sheets of plexiglass into it.  \ufeff",

Yes, there some differences in memory architecture, and the \noverall package included in the box differs slightly. Options on one are \nsatandard on the other, blah blah blah. But 95% of the systems are the \nexact same. So let's say that the hardware is equal.\n\nThe PS4 is $100 cheaper. Even if you buy the (optional) camera, it's still \n$50 cheaper. Public reaction to the PS4 has been overwhelmingly and \nemphatically positive. People love it; they love the games; they love the \nsocial media tie-ins; and they love the quality of playstation plus.\n\nGamer reactions to the XBone have been that it is an improvement over the \n360 but maybe not a $500 improvement. The XBone appears to be a great way \nto watch TV with voice controls (throw away your remote). And the reviews \nof the voice controls have been either that it is the best thing since \nsliced bread, or that it doesn't work AT ALL. So even that isn't guaranteed.\n\nIf you're buying it for games, get a PS4. If you're buying it for \nhand's-free TV watching, wait a year for a non-gaming voice control box \nthat actually works in 2014 for $150.",
