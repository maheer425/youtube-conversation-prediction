They mentioned that \nhe died by being eaten alive by a Grizzly Bear, and that his death was \nrecorded in audio form; Herzog is shown listenig to the audio in the \ndocumentary, and is disturbed. For some reason afterwards I felt a really \nintense morbid curiosity, wondering what that would actually sound like, \nand despite the fact that I told myself repeatedly it would be a bad idea, \nI found it anyway. I listened to only a few seconds of excerpts and had to \nturn it off. I had felt tired, but now I felt wide awake, my heart was \nbeating faster, I felt nauseated, but somehow slightly wiser, because it \nwas the first time I had heard something so terrifying. I warn you, DO NOT \nlook for it. I listened to only a few seconds and then looked for this \nvideo to justify to myself why I would ever seek out something so horrible. \nI don't think I'll sleep well tonight.\ufeff",

Once your curiosity \nhas visualized what you anticipated prior to not knowing whether or not you \nwanted to, your perception of the curiosity diminishes over time.\nSo for instance, \nYou see a zit popping video on YouTube for the first time. Gross, right?\nAfter some time, that itch in the back of your head to watch it again \ngrows. So then you become \"desensitized\" by the images, causing your \ncuriosity to make what you see not as bad.\nI feel this way about a lot of things. It may seem impractical to say this, \nbut I've seen so many gruesome, disturbing videos on the internet, that \neverything doesn't seem as bad now.\nIt's completely irrelevant to seeing something in person though. Seeing \nsomething happen in front of you leaves you in a feeling of shock, but that \nitch of morbid curiosity always says \"turn around and look again\"\ufeff",
