He had the whites \nand blacks marching together against the bigoted police systems, government \nvoting systems(IE Government), and the world was seeing it. YOU HAVE THE \nNERVE to say that blacks commit more crimes against whites? You should be \nashamed of yourself.

Everywhere they reside in high numbers, crime \nrates go up. This is not racism or hate talking, the statistics speak on \ntheir own. Degenerate black youth commit crime early in life, end up in \njail, with a criminal record. Therefore, they can no longer work a normal \njob, and have to resort to stealing from those better off than themselves \nto support their lifestyle/family/drug habits. I firmly believe that the \nentire prison/court system needs to be reworked. It's a shame that a 18 \nyear old kid can ruin his life (criminal record) because of one stupid \nchoice, then be forced to either turn to a life of crime, or beg employers \nto hire them.\n\nTake Detroit, for example. The Motor City, one of the most iconic, and \n\"white-bred\" cities in America. Most of the law abiding people fled once \ntheir neighborhood became a cess pool of robbery, theft, intimidation, \nfrequent distant gun shots and murder, leaving the thieves/drug \naddicts/gangs free reign. I'm not going to state their skin color, but take \na guess. Watch a youtube channel called The Shea Show to see what happened \nto Detroit after 5 more years of O-dictator in charge. Crime is so bad in \nDetroit that, according to police, an break-in is not even considered a \npriority unless there was personal injury.\n\nThose hate crimes being done to the people you mentioned are terrible, \nunforgivable things. But you have singled those two out, when in reality, \nBlack people have killed off more of their own kind, and more white people \nthan the other way around.  All of the black-on-black, and black-on-white \ncrime seems to be brushed under the rug, hidden by the media, etc...,but \nwhen the tables turn, it becomes a HUGE, widely covered media event, for \nsome reason. Not to \"go there\", but do you know how many \"treyvon\" \nsituations happen every day, but with the skin color reversed? Probably \nnot, because they NEVER see the light of day. Just FYI, there was a white \nperson gunned down by a black guy 1 county away from Ferguson, DURING the \nriots, etc...., but the media didn't give a single shit.\n\nWhat white society did during the slave trade many decades ago was utterly \nappalling, but why does the present-day white population deserve to be held \nresponsible? If all of these decades of hate, bitterness, and false \njudgement continues (in both directions) I fear that it will cause a REAL \nrace war, which, once it starts, will spiral out of control.",

She \nwas looking after her siblings are both of her parents decided to split and \nnot face their responsibilities like real adults should. They can't be that \nloving if they're going to do that to their own flesh and blood; they're \nactually better without them if that is the case.\n\nBut the main concern about this case is that girl's family could have \neasily been split up and placed into foster care, where they'll suffer \nthrough years of uncertainty and possible abuse. Their future could very \nwell be damaged beyond repair by a system which doesn't give a flying shit \nabout their humanity or their rights. \n\nThe fool judge should be commending her for looking out for her siblings. \nIt was a mature and noble thing what she did, and if the judge can't see \nthat, then perhaps those who can should shove his gavel where the sun \ndoesn't shine and refuse the stupid cunt painkillers so he can see the \nerror of his retarded ways.  \ufeff",
