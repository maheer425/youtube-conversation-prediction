If you \nscrape the glass with just the corner of the blade it will mar up the \nwindow. If the scratches are not too deep, you can try polishing with an \nactual glass polish that contains cerium oxide. For best results use a \nmachine polisher. Be careful however not to overheat the glass as it can \ncause the window to distort. DA polishers are recommended as rotary \npolishers are more aggressive and heat the surface up faster. If you \noverheat the window and it does distort it is done- the only fix at that \npoint is to replace the glass.",
