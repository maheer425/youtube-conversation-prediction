However, the Sun Drop sold \ninternationally won't have this orange pulp.\n\nJust to clarify, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Drop\n\nThe reason I ask is, with the pulp of the oranges, would the ice crystals \nform on the pulp.  Similar to the way purified water is required to super \ncool water, since the impurities in the water act as a source for the ice \ncrystals to form.
