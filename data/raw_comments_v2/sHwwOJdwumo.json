It's nearly \nimpossible showing that you are \"proud\" being a german or enjoy being one \nwithout being depicted as a nazi OUTSIDE of the World Cup... that's like \nthe only time where german can show something that has the colours \nblack,red and gold... and in the last WC some people ran around breaking \nthose car-window-flag-thingys (if you know what i mean) saying things like, \n\"thats just not right\", \"thats dangerous nationalism\" and so on... It just \nmakes me sad... :( Only because many of our ancestors f*cked up big time \n(and that's still kinda soft-said), it feels like germans are not allowed \nanymore to be proud of their country like everybody else of theirs... Just \nto make sure... I came here for football, not for crying around in the \ncomment section... it just made me think of this stuff so I had to post it \n:/\nHave a nice Day/Night :)\ufeff",

No one here at least can \noverthrow this argument.\nIf you have the empathy, you should also understand or imagine e.g. (assume \nJohnny Starr is a Brazil fans) how disappointing that is to see Brazil \nfailed that badly, that Luiz shared an un-negligible responsibility, that \npeople have rights to feel angry towards him.\nIndeed everybody (can say) is righteous to feel angry towards an overrated \nperson who receive many goodness for his overrated position, but turns out \ndid not contribute what - should be expected from him.
