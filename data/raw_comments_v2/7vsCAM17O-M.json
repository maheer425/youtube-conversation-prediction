It could customize the \ninformation that you are interested in and provide you with more of this, \nbut schools don't exist for this or actually should not exist for this. \nSchools should teach children more important things, like social skills \nthrough working in teams with \"live\" people, respect for the other people, \ngreater values like freedom, peace, democracy through, for example, solving \nissues among their team members and, of course the mental tools, like \ncritical thinking, to process all the information that they get. Working \nwith other people, researching your surroundings together, teaches also \nself awareness. You are able to define yourself, what you want and what you \nwant from other people, forces you to express you thoughts and your \nfeelings and learn the results of your actions, how you affect other people.\nThese things can't be taught by a video, or any fancy interactive or \nmulti-user technology, these things are taught through experience through \nliving in the real world. Don't get me wrong, technology can be a part of \nthis kind of school, where teachers and students cooperate and learn \nsimultaneously how to live in a society.\n+CGP Grey  I think that in this video, you think of school just as a \nprovider of knowledge, which is not or it shouldn't be, for example in \nFinland is not. Definitely, humans are social beings and need more than a \ncustomised provider of knowledge.\ufeff",

With the use of virtual reality learning \ncould become very interactive and engaging. Imagine being given a 10 min \nvideo to watch and your homework would to go play a game.\n\n As an example imagine you have to create your own world for geography, you \nget given a blank grass plane and, much like age of empires/ dinopark, you \ncan drop a mountain in the map. If you want to unlock storm clouds you have \nto watch the storm cloud video and answer a few short questions. If you \nwant to add animals you can join a biology coarse and then unlock the \nanimal kingdom by learning about it. This idea can be carried over to other \nsubjects like maths and science where if you want to play the racing game \nyou can learn how the engine works. This is a very simple illustration but \nthe point I want to bring across is that people love being creative, not \njust arts and craft but also creative problem solving, and if you have to \nlearn about things before you have access to them in the virtual reality \nyou can see how things work immediately and not have to see how the example \nyour teaches gives is applicable to whatever it is you're trying to do. \n\nI'll agree that at first the lion and zebra video will be watched and kids \nwill want to make things kill each other/ burn/ break but thats the whole \npoint. They will see the implications of their choices and with time will \ngrow bored of that. The possibilities for constructive creativity are \nendless where as destructive and violent choices will generally have the \nsame result. \n\nWe may just be able to teach kids to think about the far reaching \nconsequences of their choices long before they appear in the real world.\ufeff",

Sure, the program \nmay know the student better in an academic way, but understanding the \nsocioeconomic status or the cultural background of a student and using \nthose to teach students about being active in their communities are things \nI don't see machines being able to adapt to any time soon (and I understand \nthat some schools don't teach this but it's definitely a way I plan to \nteach my students about applying the things they learn in my classroom).\n\nAnd even so, I still don't think that the machine would do this well \nbecause it is important that people be exposed to things that make them \nquestion the world around them. They need to be exposed to things they can \nrelate to directly and they need to be exposed to things that are similar \nbut require a little more abstract thinking in order to make the connection \n(sorry, I'm coming from a humanities perspective as I am an Language Arts \nteacher who is becoming increasingly frustrated at how little attention and \nimportance people are placing upon \"soft\" subjects like mine). I just don't \nsee how an algorithm could do something like this, like exposing a student \nto something they can relate to and get them familiar with one way of \nthinking and then start turning that on its head or exposing the biases \nbehind that way of thinking.\n\nThis program could definitely narrow the achievement gap, but schools are \nnot just day care centers... they also provide a space for social growth \nand a space to practice the things that their personal tutor is working \nwith them on by providing the materials necessary to put the skills to work \n(for example, if a student was learning how to sew, they would need a \nneedle and thread or a sewing machine to practice with).\n\nSchools will need to exist in order to simply provide access to the \ntechnology that would be necessary for a student to have this personal \ntutor, because access to the internet may be getting cheaper but minimum \nwage is still pretty damn low, so poor families are still not likely to own \nor have regular access to a computer. For the same reason public libraries \nexist, public schools exist in order to give everyone \"equal\" access to a \n\"good\" education. As things currently stand, it is glaringly obvious that \nnot all schools are created equal, but I definitely believe that we are \nheading in a direction for a stronger and fairer system of education and \ntechnology is certainly one of the reasons why that's happening. :)\ufeff",

Kids drift more, not less in these situations. Part of the \nproblem is that kids don't control the videos and they are not customized \nto them, but another big element of this is that students are genetically \nprogrammed to pay attention to PEOPLE that are paying attention to them.\n\nOn top of that, good teachers or tutors are constantly doing things like \nmonitoring the students body language, health, environmental factors, \nsocial relationships, tone of voice and on... No one has yet designed a \npiece of software that comes even close to this level of sophistication. We \nmay routinely now process terabytes of data vs the kilobystes we did when i \nwas a kid, but out algorithms are not growing in sophistication and \nsubtlety by moore's law, they are barely smarter than they were 30 years \nago.\n\nSiri is not Aristotle and good luck getting educational pundits to come \ntogether and produce something half as what apple can do.\ufeff",

The point of the \nteacher is not to understand the student, the point of the teacher is to \nteach. Cgp Grey is totally right when he says that the teacher in a \nclassroom full of students cannot teach all the students individually as \nwell as a computer personalized to each students could. Most of the \nstudents fall behind, and some are too far ahead to learn everything, and a \nsmall fraction is actually learning at a good pace. As we've seen for \ndecades teachers can't teach everyone the way they need to be taught to \nlearn the most\n2) \"A computer cannot teach language\" Your forgetting that computers do \nteach language. Although they are just as bad as public school a whole lot \nof students already take digital classes and learn from them, from \neverything from language to programming to math digital classes do help \npeople learn(although what Cgp is suggesting here would be way better then \nthe digital classes we have today)\n3) \"A computer cannot teach discipline\" It is not the computers job to \nteach discipline its the parents job, and you have to remember that large \namounts of discipline are required in normal schools today, but if everyone \nhad a digital Aristotle and did school at home while some discipline is \nneeded to keep the student on course there isn't nearly as much involved \nand to some extent computers can teach discipline even if they aren't as \ngood as teachers\n4) \"I wouldn't want me or my children to be taught by a mindless robot \nmonster\" This program is not aimed to be a mindless robot monster. Modern \nTV and video games often show computers like this but remember all your \nsocial media including the one that's allowing you to comment on this video \nright now is run by \"Mindless Digital Monsters\" and you don't care. Modern \nprogramming isn't some mindless digital monster droning something into your \nbrain. You must have noticed that modern social media adapts to your tastes \nand sees what you like, well an educational tool like this could do that \ntoo.\n5) Throw as many arguments as you want at this, but step back and look at \nour modern educational system. Its horrible, broken in almost every way and \nits only ideas like digital Aristotle that can change that.\n\nI could go on and on with this but I've made this so long that not many \npeople will bother to read this already, but I am in full support in all or \nmost of the things mentioned in this video! I am one of those students that \noften finds classes boring because I'm ahead, and you really really do feel \nlike your being held back.\ufeff",
