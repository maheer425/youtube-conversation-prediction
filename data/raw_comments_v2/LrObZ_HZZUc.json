Among the \nmost famous are the great independent cities of the ancient world, such as \nAthens, Sparta, Carthage, Thebes, Corinth, and Rome\n\n3) A city-state is an independent city \u2014 and sometimes its surrounding land \n\u2014 which has its own government, completely separate from nearby countries. \nMonaco is a city-state. Today, there are only five city-states that are \ntruly self-governing, but in the past this was more common.\n\n4) A sovereign state consisting of an independent city and its surrounding \nterritory.\n\n5 Wiki) Additionally, several cities enjoy a high degree of autonomy \ndespite formal subjection to the sovereign rule of another country and \ntherefore function in large-part as city-states, and have been identified \nrecently as representative of modern city-states. Hong Kong and Macau, \nalong with independent members of the United Arab Emirates, most notably \nDubai and Abu Dhabi, often are cited as such.[7][8][14] Also Washington, \nD.C., Berlin and Hamburg enjoy a high degree of autonomy within their \nstates.\n\nSo, evidently I am using a broader concept of city-state than you would \nprefer, but, just as obviously, I am not abusing the term.",
