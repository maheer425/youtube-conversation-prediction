If we start teaching kids \nYOUNG then they won't find STEM as difficult as they do.\nImagine you waited until your Junior year of high school to write your \nfirst book report.. yeah that's essentially what we do to kids in math and \nscience. The truth is *the average 4th grader can probably handle high \nschool algebra fine*, but they aren't introduced to it until their 7-10th \ngrade years so the entire foundation for learning is shaky to begin with so \nwhen they get into Calculus II in college that's literally the first time \nthey've ever seen that material and there's no wonder why they have a hard \ntime grasping it in only a semester. They're already so used to going over \nthe same information repeatedly for 2-4 years so when you cram everything \ninto 4-9 months yeah... they're gonna have trouble grasping the concept.\n\nWhat we should do is stop spending so much time on review and spending more \ntime on building. I have a friend that homeschools her kids and she told me \nthat pretty much every year is a review of the last which is why she can \nhave a 14 year old working on 11th grade material with no issues on his \npart. Her son isn't a super genius.. they just spend much less time on \nreview than traditional American schools do. I don't think it'd be a \nstretch to say that out of the 9 months of any given school year 4-5 of \nthose months are based purely on *review* while you're only learning about \n4-5 months of new material.

As a huge influx of college \nstudents began going to college so did people obtaining degrees in very \nlucrative careers. Doctors, architects, engineering, accounting ect.\n \nAn influx of to many people in these careers devalued the careers, which in \nreturned threatened the compensation for these careers. As a result doctors \nbegan placing barriers of entry into the medical field. These practices \neventually found their way into the education system and other \nmath/sciences that are purposely used to \"weed out\" potential competition \nin the career. As a result people who became educators in math and science \ntaking these same classes learned to teach these subjects in the same \nobscure way that places much of the burden of learning on the student.   \n \nThis is why many people think that you either have an aptitude for these \nsubjects or don't. 3-4 generations of systematically indoctrinating \neducators to not teach these subjects but instead providing basic \nintroduction and then forcing students to extrapolate beyond the \ninformation provided.

I \nstarted loving computer science when I wanted prettier armour in Skyrim and \none thing kind of lead to another.  THOSE are ways that you get addicted to \nmath and science, and learn to love \"solving difficult problems.\"\nBeing locked in a room with seventy other students and forced to listen to \nan instructor drawl about methods with no perceivable application, then \nrequired to go home and spend several hours drilling yourself on these \nabstracted representations of nonexistent scenarios (lest you be punished \nwith failing grades and a lecture about how terrible your work ethic must \nbe) is not how you get addicted.  In fact it's a good way to end up tired \nand resentful and wanting to get as far away from the subject as you \npossibly can.  By the time I was sixteen, I'd begun keeping my psychology \nand anatomy studies a secret because I'd learned that the second teachers \nand parents get their hands on my favourite subjects, they suck all the fun \nout of it.  I STILL have a hard time sharing what I'm up to with people I \ndon't trust.\n\nI'd also point out that maths and sciences have a serious lack of visible \nrole models.  Growing up, Bill Nye was literally the only scientific \ncelebrity I could name--and I it wasn't until I was well out of high school \nand stumbling around on facebook and youtube that I found out he was \nactually a real scientist, and not just a character portrayed by an actor. \n I think that it's because there simply aren't enough maths and science \npeople who utilize media to share their stories and their passions and show \npeople what it looks like to care about science.  It's hard to follow in a \ngreat scientist or mathematician's footsteps if you don't even know who \nthey are.\ufeff",
