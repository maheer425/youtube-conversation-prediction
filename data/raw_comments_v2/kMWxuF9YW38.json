I'm not \nagainst it or anything (you can be gay, IDGAF) but I'm tired of people \nusing science to prove/disprove homosexuality. If anything, the video is \nagainst homosexuality. Sure, many animals have different sex determination \nsystems, no where in it that says that male ants or whatever species are \nfucking one another or something. If they are, chances are they don't have \nsex assigned to them yet or their sexes can change/determined later in \nlife. But male and female homo sapiens clearly have their sex determined at \nbirth and their sexes are not naturally changeable at all. Unless if you \ncan suddenly change sex naturally and be able to carry out role of the \nother (females with breastfeeding/gestation for example), then this video \nis clearly not supporting homosexuality in any way. If you want to be gay, \nyou're free to do that, just don't drag science along.

In essence this seems like the same thing but it \nstarts becoming a mental illness when people cut of their limbs to become \nsomething that they are not.\n\nI'm currently taking a Sociology course because i'm interested in the \npsychological aspect of peeps but i really hate a lot of the social science \nconcepts like social constructions because they tend to lampshade anything \nscientifically based and go off on their own tangent on topics like gender \nroles and come to conclusions instantly(which just makes them seem like \npretentious douches) without providing any substantial evidence for their \nclaims.
