I would like to say I have more testosterone then my peers because \nI have full body hair (head to toe) and a beard. I can stare a woman and I \nfeel nothing. Maybe this aura of wonder and aw but never a lustful feeling. \nSame goes with men and everything else. I defiantly get way less of that \nfeeling with males but I can see the difference between an ugly person and \na cute person. I don't get \"turned on\" by anything. I might feel a urge for \nhugging or cuddling but I don't want to have intercourse. Kissing makes me \nwant to throw up and any sexual contact repulses me. I don't feel \nuncomfortable talking about it or seeing it. It just bothers me thinking \nabout me and another person. I hate when women play hard to get. It makes \nme less attracted to them and actually angry and impatient. You don't play \nhard to get when you meet a co worker or schoolmate. So why the hell would \nyou waste time on a potential partner? Again, I'm not like a lot of people. \nSo I don't assume you would ever fully understand my frustrations with a \nvery over sexual world that thinks you have a mental illness if you are not \nconforming.\ufeff",

The definitions of love itself are usually \nvague or at least expressed by individuals according to their experiences \nand beliefs.\nFor example, one of the four loves described in the Bible is known as \n\"agape\" and the most used form of love in the text. This love is strictly \nnot an emotion, not a feeling, and therefore not related at all to \nchemicals. Agape love is defined as a longstanding care for another person, \nand is characterized by the constant searching for the best in that person. \nThis love is a chioce and a commitment which can be extended to anyone. By \nthis standard of love, you can love friends, family, strangers, and \nliterally everyone in existence.\n\nObviously, love as a human word and concept is not so easy to pin down ;)\ufeff",

Which is why when a \nman takes care of a woman, he knows he's secure in protecting her. But \nafter she decides that she wants to get a job too, that security goes away. \ni.e. love. She is not secure if she decides to get a job as well, pretty \nself explanatory.
