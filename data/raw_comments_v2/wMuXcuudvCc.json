Pair this with \n\"luxury\" taxes added to every single medical device and you're looking at a \nminimum 10% increase in costs (because any sane business is going to pass \nthis cost onto their customers). \n\nOur government has no incentive to change this because they receive \nBILLIONS in donations from these companies or they own in part or in whole \ninsurance companies within their state. It's not unreasonable to see that \nan Oil Baron would attempt to deregulate or otherwise help out his oil \nbusiness through legislation. It's no less true about insurance. \n\nWake up people and stop buying into the Liberal nonsense about equality in \nthe market and how much better they are for you than Conservatives.

America has a \nmuch larger population spread out across a much larger country, which I \nbelieve is a more difficult part with dealing with more patients. \n\nAnother point that comes up is to cut military spending and it will solve \nall the problems. The problem I see with this is that we kind of pay for \nmany other nation's defenses. Making up most of the world's military \ncapability and also with our hundreds of bases in Europe. If those \ninstallations were to disappear the nations would have to build their own \ndefense forces to have the same protection. In turn increasing their own \ntaxes. That is where I estimate they are able to sustain this healthcare \nsystem. Without the burden of a large military of their own, they can \nafford these expenses.\n\nI don't believe healthcare is a right either I was born an American and \ntaught to work for your life. I may sound heartless or greedy, but is it \nreally my obligation to pay for others. I mean you know when you are yelled \nat to do something and then it instantly turns you off the idea, I think it \nis the same thing. I would definitely donate money to certain causes but if \nI'm forced to pay it through taxes I feel like is what throws me off the \nidea. \n\nSo in summary it's just that America isn't the same as the others. With \ndifferent spending priorities, a much larger population, and also an \ninternational community that depends on our defense force I just don't see \na healthcare system controlled by the government to work as it is just more \nmoney burning on our ever lasting burning supply of our credit card bills. \nI feel a free market system would work better with competitive pricing, \nmaybe it's just my backwards conservative ways, but what can you do in a \nworld of conflicting ideologies where compromise seems to only make the \nmoderate idea that nobody wants anyway.\n\n\ufeff",
