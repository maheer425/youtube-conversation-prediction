If someone were to graph this, it would be a sine wave \nwith y-axis being the final answer and x-axis denoting the number of terms \nin the function. If you choose x-axis to be the actual numbers (1 or -1), \nthen you would get an oscillation between (1,1) and (-1,0).

There is no \"answer\", this sum isn't equal to a number.\nA different, but similar looking sum is sum((1-1)) from k=1 to infinity. \nThis sum has the same number of 1 and -1 for every k and thus is equal to \n0. We always have an even number of summands.\nAnother sum is sum((1-1)) from k=1 to infinity -1. We have an uneven number \nof summands and for every k an excess -1. The result is -1.\nAnd the final one 1 + sum(-1+1) from k=1 to infinity. Also uneven number of \nsummands, with an excess 1. The limit is one.\nKeep in mind that we are interested in the limit.

The problem truly arises though, when \nyou stop after that second minute ends, and you get half. Half on half off. \nImagine the switch you use to turn the light on or off, I assume if you \nstopped at that exact instant, you'd stop in the middle of the process of \neither turning the lights on or off. This again, doesn't really work in our \nphysical reality, cause even if you stopped with the switch half on, half \noff, the light would still be either on or off and not both at the same \ntime. \n\nUnless we consider spiritual reality, where the sum of all moments that \never took place in physical reality, is treated as one moment. The mighty \nnow. But in that case conducting this whole experiment would be a waste of \ntime, yet without wasting  a single nano second, feel me? ;-)\ufeff",

Some time \nbefore the 2 minute mark, the intervals will become so small, that not even \na switching instrument/device which could operate at the speed of light in \na vacuum, will be able to keep up.  Technically, it would be possible to \ncalculate exactly the point in which the specific switching \ninstrument/device being used, could no longer keep up with the depreciating \nintervals.  Therefore it could be calculated exactly whether or not the \nlight would be stuck on, or stuck off, at the 2 minute mark, once all \nlimitations of the switching equipment had been accounted for. Actually, \nnow just realizing while typing this; in order for the light to be 'stuck' \non or off, the control circuit need to be program controlled to an already \npredetermined limit, otherwise it may just keep switching on and off at \nit's maximum rate. Not even the world's fastest super computer could \nartificially run this test. So yeah, anyway, clearly his 'real world' \nquestion is pointless.\ufeff",
