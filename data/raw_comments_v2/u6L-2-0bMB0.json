            "text": "+Caitlyn Cooper. thanks for your reply, However I disagree with a lot of \nwhat you said.\n\n.\n\n \"no dog breed is specifically more dangerous than the next.\"\nan interesting claim. how do you back it up.....\n\n\"Some have more powerful jaws and aggressive breed traits\"\n... oh, that's how. But wouldn't \"aggressive breed traits\" make the dog \nmore inclined towards violence, and thus be considered \"more dangerous\"?\nI would really like you to clarify your definitions here, because as far as \nI can see you are contradicting yourself.\n\n.\n\n\n\"hereditary disease do not guarantee suffering.\"\nI agree that they do not *guarantee* suffering. but they certainly increase \nits likelihood.\n\n\"Banning an entire breed over common health problems is overkill.\"\nA subjective opinion. why I disagree with this opinion is explained below\n\n\"It is improper breeding that caused the problems, and proper care and \nselective breeding can prevent them.\"\nit is improper breeding that caused these *breeds* in the first place. And \n'selective breeding' in this case involves a panel of experts being hired \nby the government to conduct a multi-year long survey in order to 'select' \nwhich dogs should be breed and which shouldn't be.\n\n.\n\n\" but it should still be the right of the person to chose what breed to \nallow in his life.\"\nthey can choose, but only from a limited list of pre-approved breeds.\nAnd before you get all indignant, and start saying how 'western countries' \nhave more freedom; Don't western countries also have laws about what type \nof animals can and can't be had as a pet? (the answer is yes, they do)\n\nI am sure you would be allowed to have a big dog living in a crowded city \n(despite the dog being unsuited to the city), But why not a trained pig? \nshouldn't the people be allowed to choose from ANY animal?\nwhy do you need a license to own a snake? (I am not sure about the US, but \nthat is certainly the case in Australia)\n\n.\n\n\"she is still the kindest, most docile dog you will ever meet, and all \nbecause I trained her properly\"\ntry training a fox.\n\nthe whole nature vs. nurture argument is pointless.\nthere are very good reasons why Tibetan Mastiffs are bred for guard dogs \nand why Labradors are bred for family pets. Because instincts will ALWAYS \nplay a role.\n\nTrue, with adequate training you *might* be able to override the \nanimals instincts. but at end of the day, the instincts are still there for \nthe next generation to inherit.\nit is better to breed quiet docile dogs than it is to breed yap-yap \nannoying dogs or violent territorial dogs (unless you want a guard dog, in \nthat case breed a Tibetan Mastiff).",

Some have more powerful jaws and aggressive breed traits, but all \nbreeds can be trained properly to prevent danger. That's what domestication \nis. Also, hereditary disease do not guarantee suffering. Banning an entire \nbreed over common health problems is overkill. It is improper breeding that \ncaused the problems, and proper care and selective breeding can prevent \nthem. And it's all good and well that China wants to help provide their \ncitizens with ideal companions for their lifestyles, but it should still be \nthe right of the person to chose what breed to allow in his life.\n I have a siberian husky, a breed bred for physical activity, while living \nin the suburbs. Even though she is not getting the same exercise that she \ncould in a more rural area, she is still the kindest, most docile dog you \nwill ever meet, and all because I trained her properly.
