I feel Canelo landed the more effective \ncombinations and power shots which made a huge difference. Lara used a \nstyle of boxing that is very defensive, which didn't allow Canelo to \nengaged like he wanted to. But as much movement as there is in that style, \nthere has to be more punches. Lara had many opportunities to counter but \ninstead he pushed himself away from the fight. I think if he would have \ncounterpunched more and threw more combinations that would have really \nimpressed the judges. When you fight a guy like Canelo I think you have to \nshow the judges you can really outbox him. Perfect example, Mayweather, \nstayed in the pocket, threw combinations, backed Canelo up, counter punched \nhim, which Lara did neither of those. They're really wasn't anything \nimpressive about Lara besides his left hand and his jab. If he would have \ncommit to his attack a bit more, he would have won the fight.\ufeff",

But when a guy is unwilling \nto fight, what can you do?\nSure lara got a few great counters and straight lefts in. But that's it.\nCanelo got some great bodyshots in that you could tell hurt lara, even if \nhe did deny it. By the end though, neither fighter seemed particularly \nworse off.\nDidn't really have a problem with this going either way. Canelo didn't put \non his best performance ever, and lara ran. (what mayweather fans will call \n'schooled canelo')\n\n117-111 by that mexican judge is just disgusting. He should never be \nallowed to judge again. Depending on what you think scores points, this \ncould have went either way by one or two rounds\ufeff",

I think that Lara will look at the fight and see the mistake he \nmade, I think the fight was really close and I think Canelo did enough to \nwin but not enough to say that he's BETTER then Lara because right after \nCanelo basically said Fuck no to a rematch... Because, Lara basically let \nthe fight slip away, it wasn't Canelo who imposed himself and won the fight \nwith his skills it was because Lara stopped throwing and mentally I know \nCanelo didn't feel like the winner because he was getting out boxed early \non and edged out a decision only because Lara made a mistake. \ufeff",
