People who achieved \"succes\" for themselves at \nthe expense of all others are not to be glorified. That's the ultimately \ndisgustiung part of capitalism indoctrination. Glorifying fraud and theft \nwhile only extremely few eventually are better off with it. And you are \nmade to believe you can as well. Small hint, the success of Jews and \ncriminals in business isn't merely through fair work and respect for the \nsociety and the fellow man. Petty criminals, organized crime is what it is, \nnothing more. But they will keep stuffing the \"American dream\" down your \nthroat making you abandon the interests of society, yourself and your \nfellow man in favor of a greed that is promised but can and won't ever be \nfulfilled but for the people that spread that illusion and have tools like \nyourself as support. Like slaves supporting their master in promise of \nfreedom that never comes. Meanwhile stepping over each other and destroying \nthe weaker ones, sabotaging each other all in the illusion of a promised \nfreedom that will only ever exist for the masters (being the extremely \nwealthy that put the blame for poverty or slavery with the laziness of a \nfew of the slaves, making the rest agree to harsher treatent for these \nslaves as well as themselves, there is no other way they say). This type of \nextreme, undeserved wealth is a huge part of what is wrong with the world. \nWe need big redistribution of wealth and birth right. And need to crack \ndown on the scum exploiting fair businesses, labour. Wall street needs to \nbe regulated beyond any possible fraud. It's far too important for society \nto be left at the mercy of criminals. And money has to be banned as a \nfactor in politics and media. ",
