It is produced \nfrom mitotic cell division of spores, which are produced by meiosis in \nsporophytes. Gametophytes produce haploid male or female gametes (or both), \nby mitosis.\n\nThe female and male gametes are also called, respectively, egg cells and \nsperm cells. The fusion of male and female gametes produces a diploid \nzygote, which develops by repeated mitotic cell divisions into a \nmulticellular sporophyte. Because sporophytes are the product of the fusion \nof two haploid gametes, these sporophyte cells are normally diploid, \ncontaining two sets of chromosomes. The mature sporophyte produces spores \nby a process called meiosis, in which the chromosome pairs are separated \nonce again to form single sets. The spores are therefore once again haploid \nand develop into haploid gametophytes.\n\nIn bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts), the gametophyte is the \ndominant form and thus the most familiar phase of the life cycle. The \nsporophytes are attached to and dependent on the long-lived \ngametophytes.[1] Moss gametophytes originate from the germination of a \nspore. The initial phase of growth leads to a filament of cells (called the \nprotonema). The mature gametophyte of mosses produces the gamete-producing \nstructures, archegonia and antheridia.[2] In gametophyte dominant \norganisms, such as bryophytes, specialized structures or even whole \nindividual plants that produce gametes are sometimes called gametophores.",

It represents the juvenile gametophyte. While the protonema is \ngrowing by apical cell division, at some stage, under the influence of the \nphytohormone cytokinin, buds are induced which grow by three-faced apical \ncells. These give rise to gametophores, stems and leaf like structures \n(bryophytes do not have true leaves (megaphyll)). These gametophores are \nthe adult form of the gametophyte.[1] Protonema are characteristic of all \nmosses and some liverworts but are absent from hornworts.
