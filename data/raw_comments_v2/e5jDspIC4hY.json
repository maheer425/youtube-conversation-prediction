Its a free to play game but also pay to win, although there is no \ngoal. The replayability is just bad. You can play the game just once and \nyou have no safe-spots, or save-points. For the balancing: as mentioned \nbefore, the pay to win system really makes differences between the player. \nWhether you have no Reallife currency or you just dont want to spend it for \na game doesnt matter.

            "text": "But if a game is with other people does that mean single-player games don't \nexist because they are impossible? That for example the elder scrolls games \naren't actually games, but puzzles? Or do non-player characters (NPC's for \nshort) count as people? From the NPC view yes they are people, they have \nemotions that although we think is just line of code, is real enough for \nthem. They have lives and loved ones and jobs and income and Eustress and \nDistress like any human or partially intelligent life from. However from \nsociety's view, it would be potentially dangerous if they were considered \npeople (society considering them people being giving them human rights like \nthe right to vote) because there thoughts are not their own, they are pre \nprogrammed by another human, a developer, that NPC's God. For example, if \ntwo people were running for president (lets say guy 1 and guy 2) and 100% \nof the population was going to vote for guy 1 because he was kind and \nhonest and knew how to run a government, but guy 2 was greedy so guy two \nprogrammed billions of NPC's that had human rights and they all wanted to \nvote for him, then guy 1 wont become president although he should have. So \nNPC's should not participate in our world, and just stay in theirs. But \nwhat about us? If there is a god does that mean the same logic applies? Are \nwe not allowed to interact with our god? When NPC's die in a game, they \ndon't magically appear in our world so does that mean that even if there is \na heaven, are we allowed in it?\ufeff",
