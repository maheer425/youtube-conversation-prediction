Breakfast is very important. Skipping breakfast slows your metabolism in \nthe morning and leads to bad habits. \n3. Eating a big dinner is not good. Your putting food in your body before \nyou go to sleep and stop digestion.\n\nMy guide to losing weight:\n-drink plenty of water\n-eat lots of fruits and vegetables\n-stop eating fried foods\n-stop eating simple carbs and reduce complex carb amount\n-drink less dairy\n\nI recommend that if your an athlete and/or still a teenager that you not \ncut out carbs and dairy.\ufeff",

Sure, eating 20 potatoes is neither \nvaried nor balanced, but all he did was eat enough to maintain his weight \nor created a calorie deficit and lost weight. He was eating ~500g of carbs \na day and lost 20lbs and majorly reduced his cholesterol and blood \npressure. And okay, if you wanna talk about the difference between complex \n+ simple carbs, look at the guy who lost 56lbs eating only McDonald's \n(while sticking to a calorie amount of 2000 with light walking). Calorie \ndeficit = weight loss. NO EXCEPTIONS. \n\n\n2. \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/06/05/skipping-breakfast-may-not-be-so-bad-for-weight-loss-study-finds/ \nA study of 300 overweight and obese patients shows that eating breakfast \nhas almost no affect on the amount of weight you lose.\n\n\n3. There is ZERO evidence that shows that eating right before bed or large \namounts late at night will cause weight gain. If you OVEREAT AT ANY TIME \nyou will gain weight. It all comes back to calories in vs. calories out. If \nyou eat a 1000 cal meal in the morning or at midnight there will be no \ndifference in how it affects your body.",

They do expand and how much they expand \nis actually not known because you skin will burst first before the fat \ncells will. Is it true that obese children under 2 years will have more fat \ncells than a regular person and will have a harder time losing weigh later \nin life. So you NEVER gain fat cells, they just expand. They only way to \nlose fat cells? Liposuction. Also, having breakfast starts off you \nmetabolism. Not eating will cause you body to go in 'distress' and whatever \nyou eat will be immediately stored by your body because it fears it will go \nhungry again. See your body as a stove that you have to give enough wood to \nkeep it burning and at regular times. If you don't give it enough wood, it \nwill not really burn anymore... :)\ufeff",
