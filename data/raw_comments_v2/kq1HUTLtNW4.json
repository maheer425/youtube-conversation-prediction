However being everything all at once is extremely \nboring, because there's literally nothing you can interact with but \nyourself so eventually the ultimate being decides to commits suicide by \ninstantly expanding all of itself outwards into a new universe, a new big \nbang.\n\nThus we see that life is potentially the answer to avoiding the eternal \nstagnation of a universe so old that all it's energy is dispersed into an \nhomogeneous infinity. instead, it could be a cycle! And to do all of this, \nthe very first required step we need to take is to create a self concious \nbeing capable of manipulating matter and energy at will in every way \nconceivable with 100% efficiency, including ways that we cannot currently \nconceive because of the limitations of our senses and imagination.\ufeff",
