Because of socialism. Yes that is factually \naccurate! That was a period with the largest amount of wealth distribution \nin our country's history. The rich were taxed up to 90%  and it was \nredistributed through the GI bill to pay for college and housing and job \ncreation.

In the '40's, we kind \nof bombed Japan, made Germany pay reparations for decades, and the rest of \nthe developed world was center stage of this whole conflict. If all your \neconomic competition is either 1) dying from nuclear radiation, 2) \ncompletely broke from being held liable for the war or 3) having to rebuild \nvast swaths of the countryside after intense fighting had occurred, then \nyes, I could see how the US would be enjoying relative economic success. \nDon't you think the outcome of WW2 has maybe a smidgen to do with why we \nwere so economically powerful in that time?",

            "text": "+Dinner with Mariah But your entire historical premise on why the U. S. \nmanufacturing economy boomed in the 50's is a fiction. American workers \ndidn't do so well in the 50's because there was some magic in the air, much \nless because of socialism. You are putting the cart before the horse. The \nreason they did so well was because so much of the manufacturing capacity \nof the West had been blown all to hell in this little skirmish called WWII. \nThe reason the U. S. was doing so well was because we had the only game in \ntown. Capital goes where it is treated best, and that was here. The only \nlarge, stable, functioning manufacturing base left was ours, so we could \nafford to pay our people most - there was no competition, and moving \noverseas at the time was foolish. And our relative economic strength \ndeclined, not because of the Koch brothers or the evils of capitalism, or \nbecause we dropped the tax rates from 90%, but because the rest of the \nworld developed quickly and was able to compete again. Tax revenues \nactually increased when the rates were dropped from 90%. And not because of \nsome trickle down foolishness, but because what rational person is going to \nincrease their workload to only get 10% of their pay? If you worked for a \nrate of $100/hour at a tax 35% rate, but when you hit 40 hours a week that \ntax rate went to 90%, would you work extra? For a take home of $10? Hell \nno! \nWhat did result from that wealthy time was corporate complacency, which has \nhurt us. The reason companies like Toyota and Honda were able to suddenly \ncompete with and at times surpass U. S. car companies was because many \ncompanies here never stopped to notice that the world had changed, and they \nweren't changing with it. Japanese companies developed many new operation \nand management ideas that allowed them to blow past us. Heard of \"just in \ntime\" manufacturing, or \"kiazen,\" or lean manufacturing? Japanese ideas \nafter WWII, much of it pioneered at Toyota.  \nFinally, did you know that we now manufacture more in the U. S. than we \never have before? Despite all the companies going overseas, all the \nsupposed tax breaks they get for going, despite the higher wages that our \nworkers demand, we make more stuff here than ever. Do you know why that \nhasn't translated into more jobs? Automation. Unless you plan on smashing \nup machines like some neo-Luddite, those jobs are just gone. Machines do \nthem better, cheaper, and faster. \nYou can't put that egg back together again. Unless you are expecting a \nlarge portion of the world's manufacturing capacity to be blown to bits, \nand yet again we come out unscathed, it's a pipe dream. The 50's and 60's \nare long gone, and dreamy socialism isn't going to bring it back. \nRead some history, take some business, tax, and econ classes. ",

WAY more money than all the \nsenators got combined. so when you have republicans and democrats voting \nthe same way, not because they both agree a bill is bad, but because \nthey're both getting paid by a bill's enemy, we've got serious problems. \nwhy do they agree the bill is bad? because they're getting paid by the same \npeople. campaign contributions are an insurance policy for elites. it costs \nthem small money, to save them big money in the long run. the kochs will \ngive $880 million to save $5 billion in the long run, and so will the \npeople donating to the democrat party. it's all the same. parties mean \nnothing, except on the small issues like religion, same-sex marriage, \nabortion, and gun rights. the leftists will raise taxes... but not on the \nelites! the republicans will lower taxes... but especially for the elites! \nthat's how it always goes. it's not because of their ideology. it's because \nthey are buddying around with the same people, but they have to pretend to \nbe different, otherwise the american public will realize that they're not \ngetting any choice in who to vote for. as long as they seem different in \nsmall ways, the average voter will assume that voting for one party is \ndifferent from voting for another party. that way, they feel like they have \na choice, and they don't revolt. but do they really have a choice? the only \nthing you can choose for is whether you want gay people to get married, or \nguns to not be confiscated. vote red, and you can have your guns. vote \nblue, and gay people can get married. it's really the only difference. your \nwallet is gonna be in the same condition either way: empty. personally i'm \nnot gay, and i think marriage is a really stupid decision for anyone, so \ni'd rather vote republican. i think they're catering to a bunch of \nreligious fucktards, but who cares? they're not going to sell out my guns \nto the elites, so that we couldn't even start a revolution if we wanted to. \nand i can't see why anyone would want to get married when divorce is at \n60%, and will cost you your house, car, and money... including gay \npeople... so i don't see why it matters to me. i don't feel bad denying \nmarriage to other people, even though i feel that they should have equal \nrights. it's like giving gay people the \"right\" to be robbed blind by a \nbunch of criminals. yes they should have the \"right\" to be fucked over, but \nwho cares? i don't even want the right to get married myself! i'd much \nrather gay people have the right to own a gun than have the right to get \nmarried, since getting married *sucks*, and owning a gun will save your \nfucking life and possibly this country.\n\nkeep it in mind for 2016...",
