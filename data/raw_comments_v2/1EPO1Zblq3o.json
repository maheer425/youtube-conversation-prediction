I discovered your channel 3 years \nago by mistake because I remember clicking on one of your videos when I was \ntrying to click something else and it was the best \"mistake\" ever. I rarely \ncomment because I never know what to type but this video reached out to me. \nI think it's because I relate to your love story. I was miserable and alone \nand always looking for happiness in the same wrong places; then on day I \ndecided to search where I knew I would never look and I found the most \namazing person I've ever met. Moving in together and sharing this life with \neach other, fighting and struggling makes the journey worthwhile because we \nstick together. For the past few months I have been feeling really \ndepressed due to work stress which ultimately got me fired. Starting a new \nlife with someone and planning things and then having the rug being pulled \nfrom under me just made me feel worse. A few days ago I found myself \nwatching and re-watching your videos because they are light, caring, and \nalways make me laugh. This video in particular made me realize that this \ndoes not have to be the end of something, but maybe the start of something \nnew. You and Martina struggled but turned your life around because you had \neach other. Your words on what may seem like a regular fun EYK video spoke \nvolumes to me, so I decided to type this very long (most likely boring - \nTL;DR) to thank you. A very warming Thank You from this Portuguese fan of \nyours. ~ Ana \ufeff",
