Yes Batman \ndoes have Kryptonite, but this is when Batman and Superman first meet so \nchances are he wont have them on him. Whats going to end up happening is \nits going to be a draw between them and/or someone going to break them up \nbefore the fight is settle. Sometime I don't understand what the debt is \nall about anyone should be able to figure out whats really going to happen \nin the movie, or if there was an actually death battle just comparing there \nstats (again no moral, just going all out doing what you have to do to kill \nthe other hero).

            "text": "Batman is the best superheroes in my humble opinion but there is no way \nBatman will ever win against well, a god-like creature like Superman \nrealistically. I'm no comic reader but i'm pretty sure that everytime \nBatman 'win' in a battle against Superman, he have the upper hand. Mostly \nSuperman is under villain or some substance's control that render down most \nof his abilities.\n\nin an ideal fight, both in tip top condition, Superman will encounter every \nattack from Batman even with all of his gameplan ready and \ncryptonite-powered gadget available on his utility belt. Lets forget the \ncomic universe and see Batman's options on this fight:\n\nBatman use fear to intimidate his opponents but how can you scared a being \nthat almost never lose in a battle? Darkness won't help him while bat sonar \nwill only make Superman laugh\nWe already know that any physical attack from Batman will be only a \n'breeze' for Superman so we can eliminate Batman's taijutsu and other \nmartial arts he mastered, even with his powered fist it will have no effect \non Superman. Close quarter combat will be the end for The Dark Knight\nBatman have ninja-like abilities to hide his presence but Superman can see \nthrough everything, Batman can't do surprised attack, and even if he find \nan opportunity and flank Superman, the guy will just move as fast as light \nand encounter Batman with one fatal fist. And one other thing, Superman can \neasily destroy any hiding or cover place for Batman, he can level the whole \nfighting ground to make it harder for Batman to hide.\nBatman have range weapons to hit Superman from safe place but Superman also \nhave this. With his laser Superman can melt Batman with ease and he doesn't \nhave to reload it and it have unlimited 'ammo'\nLet's go all out, Batman use all of his arsenal including Batplane, \nBatmobile, The Tumbler, Batpod, and other awesome vehicles he possessed and \nhave all of them fight Superman...we can see how this is gonna end right? \nSuper fast move, super blow, super punch, super kick, super strength, super \nlaser eye, ect.\nLast important thing, Superman and Batman are friends and they know each \nother so much. It's logical for Superman to never, ever underestimate \nsomeone like Batman so he will never overconfidence, he will never do that \n'yeah-go-ahead-shoot-me-and-see-how-it-will-affect-me' attitude against \nBatman. Superman also know that Batman knew and possessed his weaknesses \nand will use it against him so he won't let any bullet, smoke bomb, \nbatarang or any form of Batman's range attack touch him. Batman might be \nsmart but you can't underestimate Superman either. He don't become the \nleader of Justice League and last this long just because he have brute \nforce.\n\nVerdict, in an ideal condition, Batman have no opportunity to win. All of \nhis 'superpowers' will be nothing against Superman. We all love underdog \nstory, we like David to outsmart Goliath, we like Leonidas's 300 taunt \nXerxes, we like Iron Man go head to head with Captain America, that's why \nBatman will mostly win against Superman in any form of storytelling, but in \na realistic world with both in peak condition (both mental and physical), \nBatman will never ever challenge The Man of Steel, he's too smart to \nexercise in futility.\n\nAnyway, great and entertaining video!\ufeff",

Before 2011 what was The Avengers? A batman rip \noff no one knew about till 2008, a green behemoth that had two bad films \nbefore, a civil war vet 90% of the other people thought was a guy with a \nshield, a long-haired norse god who is still questionable as a superhero, a \nRussian assassin who should be in jail rather than on the front lines to \nsave the world, and a guy with arrows. You talk like DC doesn't have a plan \non its own when starting March of 2016 we get two films going in an \nentirely different direction than Marvel. Just saying, you should probably \nresearch your stuff before using strong terms like 'ended the era of \nsuperhero movies'.",
