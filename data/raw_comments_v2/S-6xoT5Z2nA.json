And the way to tell what is your \nfavourite movie doesn't have much to do with how well you think the actors \nacted or how good you think the script is, or how well you think the movie \nis directed. It's more basic than that. If it's on television will you stop \nwhat you're doing and watch it? Will you watch that regardless of whatever \nelse may be on? By that standard, Scent of a Woman or Amadeus, or even \nGoodfellas (a movie I would never consciously pick as my favourite!) has to \nbe my favourite movie.

While filming in the hotel room, \nhe tripped over a rug and fell onto a glass topped table damaging an eye \nsocket. Filming continued while he recuperated, and his physician remarked \nthat he fell just like someone who was (blind) or otherwise partially \nsighted. An indication you'd think of the mans total commitment to the role \nof Lt Col. Frank Slade U.S Army Rtd. Alan Silvestri's score is absolutely \nsublime, utilised beautifully by Dir Martin Brest. James Rebhorn does \nreally well as Headmaster Trask, and a special mention for Ferrari dealer \nFreddie, who touches the heart, as his grey ghost speech resonates.\ufeff",
