I have read many books that ruin movies. It's different after you've \nseen the movie, then read the book, then re-watch the movie, because you \nnow notice everything you didn't notice before. For instance, Trainspotting \nis a great example of this. Specifically the scene after he comes off of \nheroin and meets the girl and they go back to \"her\" place. The movie makes \nit seem awkward, but you don't realize just HOW awkward that scene truly is \nuntil you read the book and then re-watch it and realize that they excluded \na smallish yet hilarious detail. If I had read the book first, I probably \nwould have hated the movie for messing up on so many things. But I didn't, \nI watched the movie, which helped me figure out the scenery that I wasn't \nfamiliar with and the language, and then re-watched the movie every single \nopportunity that I can.\ufeff",
