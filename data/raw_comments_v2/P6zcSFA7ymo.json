When I had my baby things didn't go \nexactly according to plan and  I ended up not being to go home straight \naway... after the doctors broke my waters, gave me hormones, etc etc, over \n24 hours later my baby was finally born! I don't what it was but I just \ncouldn't sleep but finally towards the end of the day I started getting \ntired and sleepy. Now... my partner wasn't allowed to stay at the hospital \nwith me, so after he went home I finally closed my eyes... only to be woken \nup by my baby! I did what I had to do and put him down to sleep again.. but \nhe kept waking up! After trying so many times (4 hours laters) I decided to \nbring him to my bed but again... I couldn't sleep! I was afraid because I \nwas so tired I'd fall asleep deeply and hurt him without noticing. I kept \nforcing myself to stay awake and if I fell asleep it was never for long.. \nit was like my head had its own alarm clock.. Well, hours and hours passed, \nthe staff started to give breakfast and my partner arrived \"where did time \ngo?\" still.. I couldn't sleep!! Every time I was sleeping really well, I \nwas interrupted by some doctor wanting a blood sample, or a nurse giving me \nmedication or doing obs :( After a while I started to feel really energetic \nbut very light headed and felt some numbness... even my tongue was numb.. I \ndon't know how things went, all I know is that all of a sudden the numbness \ngot worse, I could walk fine but at the same time I couldn't feel my legs \nproperly, I started having twitches with my eyes, mouth, tongue, then arms, \nlegs and eventually having full body spasms (they even thought I was \nepileptic).. I still felt like I didn't want to sleep though.. apparently \nbecause I was so tired after labour but my sleep was interrupted all the \ntime, my brain decided to go all weird and act as if I needed to sleep but \ndidn't send the message to tell me I was sleepy. I needed pills to teach my \nbrain how to sleep again but now, 4 months later I still get twitches \n(mainly just with my eyes and mouth) if I start getting really tired and \nhad a few more episodes of full body spasms when I was really stressed!  \ufeff",
