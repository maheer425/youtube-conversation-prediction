Kill Kim Jung up and his 13 year old wife and that \nwhole communist shit hole they call a country! Or instead of killing \ninnocent people... We invade them! No wait we our focusing on people \ncommitting crimes and getting shot and the cop is the bad guy so people \nriot and protest! Or we are focusing on Bruce Jenner becoming a women. We \nneed to Focus on ISIS, Russia, China, and North Korea. I love America, but \nif we don't focus on the \"enemy\" and we focus on complete bullshit that we \nshouldn't give a shit about. Okay if you shot a cop in the face, that can't \nbe tolerated. Trying to take a gun of a cop, that shit can be tolerated \neither! What is America coming to when we can't focus on chinks bombing us! \nWhat will we do wait until Kim Jung un bombs us! Will we wait until ISIS is \nsawing off someone's head saying \"death to America!\" Oh wait ISIS is doing \nthat! Don't forget about a modern day Stalin. I'm sorry I criminal that \ntries to steal a cops gun dies! We should of done something to ovoid 9/11, \nand Pearl Harbor. Trying to stay out of it is bad. The deaths of 4000 \npeople could of been avoided! \ufeff",
