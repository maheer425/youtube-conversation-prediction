Here's an exert to justify their reasoning:\n\u201cSmall questions are by their nature less often asked and investigated, and \nmaybe not at all. They are virgin territory for true learning.\n2.  Since big problems are usually a dense mass of intertwined small \nproblems, you can make more progress by tackling a small piece of the big \nproblem than by flailing away at grand solutions.\n3.  Any kind of change is hard, but the chances of triggering change on a \nsmall problem are much greater than on a big one.\n4.  Thinking big is, by definition, an exercise in imprecision or even \nspeculation. When you think small, the stakes may be diminished but at \nleast you can be relatively sure you know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nSo this all sounds great in theory, but does it really work?\nWe\u2019d like to think our own track record says yes.
