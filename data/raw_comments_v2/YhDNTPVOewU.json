I'm 22 years old now, I was \ndeclared a \"Gifted Child\" when I was in the 2nd Grade when I scored in the \n99 Percentile on my Standardized Test scores. They put me in Advanced \nclasses when I was very young, because my intellectual needs are different \nfrom \"general\" people at my school.\n\nThis set me up to \"develop\" my smartness with video games, computers, and \ndays upon days of sifting through Wikipedia articles. But along with this \ncame many many hours of isolation from a social environment. I believe the \nsocial skills I have are not meant to cope with the \"General\" public's \ncapacity. I believe people like you and I are in this Elite group of \nRegular nerdy guys, who's brains are so packed with stuff and stimuli that \nwe'd rather logically analyze our problems.\n\nIf you're like me, sometimes you're spending hours upon hours googling \nsolutions to just one of your problems and somehow find a solution to 17 \nother problems, while never solving the original problem. So I ask you \nthis, Hank, what is it that all of this science is helping us achieve if \npeople like you and I cannot be in an environment where abilities like ours \nare allowed to flourish.\n\nI graduated High School with a diploma, but I come from a drug/alcohol \naddicted and disabled poor family. I qualify for all sorts of Pell Grants \nand Loans, but in the State where I live, none of the Universities cater to \nmy philosophical interests. I feel like people like us can make a \ndifference without a degree or a peice of paper saying we know something \nabout something, when you know something, I feel like you adapt your life \naccordingly to the new information you recieve. So, in a way, Universities \nand current institutions the way you and I know them are a limiting factor \nin what humans can achieve.\n\nThis is a new era where communication is dominant and transparency has \nbecome a demand. But at the same time, were I feel like I'm in an era of \ndissillusionment, because I've been able to change my situation. With all \nof the knowledge and skills I have, I don't have enough money to rub \ntogether and start a fire if you understand what I mean by that. But I do \nhave knowledge, if the countless hours I've spent wasting my life away on \nyoutube videos like scishow, vsauce, minutex, you name it, it has to count \nfor something. But how can we transcend from learning to actively doing \nthings for the greater good. That is my life goal, if I can die on this \nplanet and know I left behind a footprint that at least steered a few lumps \nof atoms in the right direction, then at least i'll know my pursuit of \nknowledge was not in vain.\n\nSo, Hank and John, please keep doing what you do, keep inspiring us out \nhere. Even if i don't see a bright future in my local community, it doesn't \nmean I don't see the bright future of the greater good. If there is \nanything I can do to help, I am free and willing to quit my day job as a \nStagehand and figure out a way to help galvanize the pursuit of knowledge \nand happiness in other people like ourselves. You've already helped me so \nmuch I'm jumping at the chance to give back!\ufeff",

It really freaked me out and eating only six teaspoons \nof sugar in a day(RDA for girls) is really hard, especially living in NYC \nwhere around every corner is something yummy.  Now, whenever I pick up a \npackage I can't help but feel the evilness of the -um everything- because \nall the RDA's are there except there's none for sugar. It's just missing \nand I never noticed it before.  Errg, how did I miss that?  I am a huge \nlabel reader.  I'd really be interested in what you think, Hank, bc of your \nUC, which I wonder if all of our health problems are related to the insane \namounts of sugar in everything. Sock it to us! You rock! PS. I am on my 7th \nday of trying to eat only 6 teaspoons and well...I am nearly delusional at \nthis point with desire.  TRY IT! SO HARD! (boys are 9)\ufeff",

I can tell you why I watch your videos...\nIt's because you're not \"special\" or \"unique\"... but then, who is? It's \nbecause you're a normal guy, who did something - which got the attention of \nthousands of other normal people (or abnormal, in their own way). And as a \nresult of that, you ended up - accidentally - becoming some sort of \nfigurehead for the \"normal people\" out there - the ones who actually care \nabout the world, and people, and things. The people who often don't stand \nout - or at least, don't stand out in the way of changing the world (ok, \nperhaps some stand out a little when Comic-Con comes to town, but that's a \ndifferent thing). What makes you stand out (and not. At the same time.) is \nthe fact that you are still you: a normal guy: even with people watching \nand paying attention. And that makes a difference. Consider it a \"force \nmultiplier\". Instead of you being able to just help 1 person; you can help \nthat one person - AND point out an easy way that another thousand people \ncan help another thousand people. People want to help other people. People \nwant to know what's really going on in the world. But today, advertisers \npay for the news. Political parties and news networks team up. Sometimes \nwhat we think is a charity ends up being a \"scam\"; or doesn't really make a \ndifference. And people are busy. And what they really need is someone to \nhelp them think about things the right way, help them make a difference, \nwhere it matters most.\nAnd that makes a difference.
