It's all about the mentality of the \nowner. I won't say all Americans, as one can't account for all based on the \nactions of many, but a lot USA culture revolves around guns (pun intended) \nin many aspects, especially their ever-known \"freedom\". It's this mentality \nthat leads people to believe it's okay to shoot at teenagers on their lawn \n(witnessed this on a few different occasions in both the south and north \nand have heard about it plenty more) or just about anyone, many times \njustifying it by saying that \"they have/had a gun (as well)\" or \"I have a \nright to protect yourself/property\" (which you do, but certainly not by \nkilling people). Living in a country knowing that not everyone I pass on \nthe street is likely packing heat is a comforting thought, I can't imagine \nfeeling safe in a place where I felt it necessary to have a gun. Not to \nmention if you have a gun for self defense - no matter your justification \nin my mind - you are willing the accept the potential of intentionally \nkilling someone. And that's something I personally could never do.\n\nSo if anyone who carries a gun around for self defense has read this far, \ncan you please explain to your friendly Canadian neighbour why you think it \nokay to take such drastic measures? Hopefully I haven't offended you; I'm \nnot calling American culture stupid or anything of the like, I just cannot \nunderstand this mentality and how this could ever be seen as \"normal/to be \nexpected\". So if you disagree please explain, thanks!\ufeff",

For starters, there is no such \nthing as an accidental shooting (not that they made mention of it), but \nthere is negligent shootings which account for all \"accidental\" shootings. \nSuch as what happened in this video when someone who had nearly no firearm \nexperienced was handed a loaded firearm and it \"went off\" before he was \n\"ready\". \nThis isn't his fault, but the fault of the safety guard or aka Range Guard. \nThese guys should have underwent a 3 hour training class before touching \nthese firearms if they have zero firearm knowledge or have never fired a \ngun. \n\nI also take issue with the thought of guns are meant to kill, and only do \nso. \nI say this as an eight tour former EOD Tech who served in both Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. \nFirearms are not made to kill, they're made to send a bullet [projectile of \na cartridge] down towards what it [the firearm] is being aimed at. Nothing \nmore, nothing less. \nTo say the gun is intending to do anything is just not true. If you set up \na piece of string in front of a doorway, you can't say that it was the \nstrings intentions to be there. Nor that the string is automatically going \nto trip someone who may walk by. That is determined by the person who sets \nup the string. \n\nThat being said, as a Combat vet, a gun owner and a range owner, I take \nextreme offense to the employee/[possible] owner who said \" you can die \nhere today\". While thats true, they could die if they mishandle the \nfirearm. \nYou NEVER say something like that, that comment was made literally to haze \nor scare them. \nIf I walked into a range and was told that I would demand to see their FFL \nand I would call the ATF. \nBut hey, that's me. \n\n[Ret.] U.S. Navy \ufeff",
