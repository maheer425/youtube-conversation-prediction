This is known electrical fact.\n\nQuestion: What would the results of such a back-spike would look like?\nAnswer: After the initial MASSIVE ELECTRICAL LASHING on a scale of nobody's \nbusiness (so bright, you'd see if from Earth), it would leave LARGE DEEP \nDENDRITIC CHANNELS etched in the surface RESEMBLING canyons & channels as \nworn by water, with scalloped edges. There'd be 'blueberries' everywhere, \nespecially in the presence of large available deposits of iron (Mars IS \nred). Half the surface body mass would be vaporized away & so would be at a \nlower altitude (you know, the hemisphere with hardly ANY craters left, \nprobably coz they're all vaporized away with the surface) while the other \nhemisphere would have the dendritic welding etch marks. We'd even see the \nstrange 'wave marks' on the bottoms of craters. Over time, we'd see the \natmosphere all but gone with only heavier gases hanging long enough to make \nan appearance as they leave the surface on their way into space. EXACTLY AS \nWE ARE OBSERVING ON MARS RIGHT NOW.\n\nYes, Mars did have water on it at one stage, but not near as much as the \nscientific community is assuming. We have NO REASON to assume that Mars had \nas much water as Earth originally coz 80% of Earth's water doesn't match \nthe rest of the planet's atomic signature anyway - it came later & from \nsomewhere else.\nEVERYTHING that we're seeing on Mars which is confusing us right now is the \nDIRECT RESULT of a MASSIVE BACK-SPIKE FROM WHEN THE PLANET'S \nELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD COLLAPSED.\nAnd before anyone does a knee-jerk refusal of this, go watch 'The Lightning \nScarred Planet Mars' by Thunderbolts Project on Youtube. Their origin \ntheory is different to mine but their evidence is compelling - these guys \nhave truly done their research but I fear the community doesn't listen \nbecause of FUNDING FIGHTS...\ufeff",

But which is impossible with idiots like him \naround, probably a 10 year old kid who finally got internet and some 5th \nglass grade school knowledge and now armed with his pathetic knowledge and \nan internet connection he thinks he can be a big show off on the web. Sorry \nbut not with me.\n\nAnd idiots like him will be simply treated accordingly: With a smack on \ntheir heads and some goddamn basic grade or highschool knowledge hammered \ninto them. Sorry but in a different manner those people will never learn. \nThe best way is to show them is:  By both: What stupid idiots they are, and \nalso what pathetic looser and wannabes in realife, since this guys are \n\"wannabe GANGSTAS literally.\n\nAnd yeah the best way to convert a \"gangsta\" back on the right path is by \nshowing these pathetic apes real gangsta, in a much more smart and refined \nway.\n\nIt is pathetic, but that is how our society works. The youth will look up \nto the \"cool one\", the \"gangsta one\". And I personally have found a golden \nmiddle by showing these pathetic kids some real gangsta but some real \neducation to. After that they will think twice about beeing a dumb criminal \nfuckhead from the block. And they would rather become a smart and educated \nrebell then a fucking, stupid, criminal, wannabe gangsta. It is not much, \nbut that already is a great help.\n\nEspecially I am a good rolemodel to those pathetic wannabe monkeys of \ngangstas.\n\nSorry I am pretty pissed right now(gee I wonder why eh?). But in anyway, I \nhate to say that but in this case: Yes you need some social ability, \nunderstanding and solidarity to. However there are cases like this wannabe \ngangstas, that cannot be dealt with with words or logic or arguments, to \ncrush them you need to use both: Logic/arguments combined with a heavy and \n\"cool\" rhetoric. Works fine, and gets that stupid monkeys lined up..... I\u00b4d \nwished they\u00b4d be more sociable people though, however at least they are \nstarting by reading some more and avoiding beeing owned by an intelligent \nperson like me or others out there.\n\nYes it is only a small step, but hell: At least these wannabe gangstas \nstart to use their goddamn braincells, and thus slowly and eventually shift \naway from a life of crime and doom towards a decent life, still beeing \n\"cool\" but not a useless criminal piece of shit anymore either. Yeah as \nsaid I know it is only a small step but it is better then nothing,\n\nAnd sorry but if you actually wanna reach the youth(and considering that \nlike 50% of the youtube users are under 18 for example), your fancy \nschmancy talk is not going to be of any use. I know it is sad, and \npersonally I cannot stress how pathetic this is, but that is our current \nreality. And that is the only way to reach out to the youth. Although nazis \ntry that to.... with limited success, unfortunately with success still... \ntotal nutcases will always be drawn towards intolerance and fascism \nunfortunately.... Has always been so and I fear this will never change.\n\nAnyway also if you wanna keep the youth from extremists groups like nazi \ncells: In your sorry but fancy schmanzy peace, love and light talk you are \nnot going to reach any teenager, let alone an aggressive and violant one \nlike a nazi, okay I know these guys are extreme, but they really only know \n1 language: Violance and monkeylike behaviour, sorry but it\u00b4s true.\n\nAs said, I know it is sad, but once again with your fancy schmanzy peace \nlove and light you will not get throught to them. You can try though, good \nluck. Should you succeeed let me now, though I doubt it. But as I know  t \nwell: what 1 human can\u00b4t do or I can\u00b4t do, can be done by other humans. \nGiven my knowledge of NLP and psychology I doubt it thugh as said. But hey \nif you want: Try your luck, and if you succeedd in such a goodie goodie \nmanner let me know, since I would definitely want to learn from you(if you \nactually succeeed that is).",

The volcanoes appear to be completely inactive. Mars was \nprobably exactly like the proto-Earth, early on, but cooled more rapidly, \nand evolved through a tectonic stage as it cooled. Tectonic movement \ncorrelates also to a robust magnetic field. And during this stage, there \nwas probably plenty of liquid water as the evidence suggests. But I think \nthis was a brief stage in martian history, since Mars can not generate \nenough heat to maintain active movement in its mantle. I am not an \nastro-physicist, but I think it's reasonable to assume the weak magnetic \nfield that remains, is just a magnetic remnant in its iron core... like a \npermanent magnet. Without a magnetic field to protect it from the solar \nwind, the sun literally eroded (blew away) almost all of its atmosphere and \nwater. If Mars had been larger, I believe it would have produced enough \npressure and heat to maintain a robust magnetic field, like Earth, and also \nsustain a thick atmosphere, perhaps including bodies of water on its \nsurface.",

            "text": "+BizzyIzzy87\nOnce again let me see, specially compared to a kid hiding in his parents \nbasement like you:\n\nRe-done my middle school grade with 19 whilst despite that working part \ntime in a callcenter.\n\nWorking as a freelancer in financial consulting since my useless parents \nrecommended it. Since I had absolutely 0 talent or success in that I gave \nup.\n\nThen did some small jobs here and there, flipped burgers, carried out \nletters, stuff like that.\n\nThen went for what I wanted to(science). And started studying, all was \ngoing well, except for the fact that the welfare institute took themselves \na fancy 6 months to finally pay my well deserved(and actually from the \nfirst day of starting study, not 6 months later) students welfare, only to \nrealize I have been lied at and ripped of at the jobcenter and welfare \ninstitutes --> I had less then before, because I had to fill in a seperate \napplication. No one told me, despite the fact that I have *extra asked* if \nall applications and papers were in order and correct. I was always told: \n\"Yes\". Well bullshit and rip off, I have had to fill in an application for \nwhat we call here \"Wohnberechtigungsgeld\".\n\nResult: I have already paid EVERY studying material from my own standard \nwelfare pocket(despite as said should have had students welfare from the \nstart and not 6 months later). However since after 6 months I had *even \nless* then before --> I simply couldn\u00b4t pay for study anymore and this was \nkicked out, after I ripped open my ass more then half a year.\n\nThen once again I tried to go for part time jobs(since unless you earn at \nleast 1100\u20ac netto it makes no sense to work full time, since you will \nreceive the same as under social welfare, despite working. A fucking joke \nthis is).\n\nWell the jobmarket has since become so dire and worse, I can\u00b4t find a part \ntime job that pays me at least 1100\u20ac netto, or at least find a part time \njob(yeah the state and jobcenter will take away anything except 100\u20ac extra, \nsince that is not enough to pay rent, neccesities, electricity and \neverything else). Electricity for example you always have to pay, welfare \nor not. However add up the costs of rent, electricity, food/neccesities and \neverything else. No way on earth can you pay this with a 300 to 600\u20ac part \ntime job, which is why you are on welfare.\n\nBut as said, you at least get to have 100\u20ac extra from the regular welfare \nif you work a job that is not enough and you thus need welfare.\n\nWhich is why a fulltime job is utter bullshit(you need tickets, or even if \nyou have a car gasoline costs for driving and getting to work), you need \nmore papers, must shower more, since you work full time and are single and \nstressed you may here and then want to get some fastfood(expensive --> \nextra costs again), you need more showers(costs for water, specially hot \nwater, more soap). Etc. etc.\n\nYeah I know aaaall small sumsm but *a LOT of small sums. Add alle these \nsmall sums up and your 100\u20ac extra are for naught.*\n\n\nWould you work fulltime for a the same as social welfare? Rofl^^ Course \nnot. Same here. Which is why I want a part time job. But guess what? Since \nmillions of other people in the exact same situation as me in germany, want \nthese part time jobs, and since the job market has since then become worse \nthen ever: I can\u00b4t find any fucking parttime job.\n\nAnyway after the failed attempt to study, thanks to my welfare system: I \nswore myself never to take a training/study that requires welfare again.\n\nProblem: My areas *all* require studying and welfare: \nScientists(bio-chemist in my case), historian, political scientists, \nsociologist. And even worse: Except bio-chemist(you always find work in \nthat area), all other areas are dying professions. We got tons of students \nhere who studied 3 years or more, did their bachelor or even master, and \nare now ranting in our studentforums because they can\u00b4t find a job and are \nstuck to social welfare! Despite studying for so long.\n\nWelcome to harsh reality kid, and welcome to our job market. But yeah a \nfucking kid like you who lives in hotel mama and has never worked or wrote \nonly 1 job application in his pathetic life of course wouldn\u00b4t know about \nthe dire situation of our jobmarket.\n\n\nThe only alternative training that would pay me(low, but better then \nnothing and enough to survive full time until I am fully trained) would be \nthe IT area(system electrician, and after that I may directly go for the \nsystem administrator, or probably not and stick to electrician which pays \ndecently already).\n\n\nProblem: This is the only area that rejects me, I got an A+ in english, but \na D in maths. IT training requires at least a C in maths. Despite the fact \nthat I did an internship in IT in my teens in school, and solved this with \nan A-, and despite all my knowledge and experience(I am one of the few that \nmastered linux, and *alone* and in a short time to, 7-8months), no one \nwants to give me a chance and an IT training.\n\nI can\u00b4t find a decent part time job at the moment either, all taken, I \neither get rejections or in most cases(70 to 80%) no answer at all.\n\n\nTo the rest: I write poems, I even got 1 in english. I write theories, I \neven created a new economic system(I call it \"Peoples economy\") as an \nalternative to the archaic planned economy and the capitalist ridden social \nmarket system.\n\nI engage in demonstrations, activism etc. I teach people what I know, I \nread tons of books and articles, watch documentaries etc.\n\n\n\nSo... Now you fucking neanderthal wannabe gangster hiding in your parents \nbasement. Tell me please: *WHAT have YOU eve DONE in YOUR PATHETIC AND \nLEECHING LIFE....?????*\n\nTell me you piece of leeching shit! I am waiting.

Yes a generally a larger size leads to more mass, however, as \nyou actually should know from 10th grade physics:\n\nThe mass is heavily dependant on the atom structure.

Water merely *transmits \nheat* but does *not* trap it, this what the atmosphere does, this is done \nby gases like by our own atmosphere, and our atmosphere is made up of O\u00b3 \nmainly and CO2 as well einstein and not of H2O(water).\n\n\"Also you didn't address the fact that CO2 follows increase in heat so it \ncan't be the factor involved in the increase in temperature.\"\n\nSimply because even a kindergarden kid knows this, but obviously this is \nhigher knowledge for a simpleton like you already. Also: You basically \ndenied this in your last comment, and now you admit it? Hahaha rofl^^\n\nThat\u00b4s why I \"love\" conspiracy theorists like you, always talking bullshit, \ncontradicting themselves and changing their minds like a grasshalm in the \nwind.\n\n\"The temperature increases in the last hundred years are less than 2 \ndegrees as those have been proven to be falsified data.\"\n\n* Beep beep beep good morning retard * Care to go up and look what I wrote? \nI said *exactly*: By 1,2 degrees(which is less then 2), or are you not even \ncapable of kindergarden maths? Obviously either that, or you are incapable \nof reading(which is equally as worse). Congratulations, I recommend less \nconspiracy theories and more science and actual books for you.\n\n\"In the 70's the same scientists that are predicting doom and gloom about \nwarming were predicting another ice age dickless.\"\n\nAnd I give a fuck about what some experts say, I simply go by logic and \nfacts that are logically and make sense, besides number 2: That you pull \noff a stupid argument like this shows me 2 things: A: That you base your \nknowledge on pseudoscience(aka conspiracy theories, thanks for proving me \nright) and B: That you yourself follow exactly the same kind of gurus you \nblatenly criticize me to do, only that your gurus are called \"david icke\" \nor \"alex jones\". And when it comes down to this: I would rather listen to \nan expert in physics then to some nutcase then david icke or alex jones, \nbut first and foremost I would trust me own analysis, logic and \nexperimenting. Unlike you, who blindly swallows what some other conspiracy \ntheorist just regurgitated.\n\n\"Temperature varies.\"\n\nOh really einstein? Wow I didn\u00b4t know that! You just won a nobel \nprize!(irony modus off)\n\n\"The earth warms up and cools down. Man has nothing to do with it. It's the \nsun moron.\"\n\nHahahaha^^\n\nFirst of all: Yes and no. The earth does not simply cool down and heat up \nlike in some fucking magic fairytale, there are deep and complex reasons \nfor this, and more then I mentioned. Which is why scientists are still \nresearching in great depht and detail what exactly causes these swings in \ntemperature. 1 thing is however sure: The atmosphere plays a great role in \nit.\n\nSecondly: Wow^^ You are contradicting yourself(*again* btw, makes the \nsecond time now), in your last comment you preached something totally \ndifferent. As said I love how conspiracy theorists just blindly regurgitate \nwhat some conspiracy guru wrote, and just change your mind like a grasshalm \nin the wind.\n\nThirdly: Yes and no again, the sun is not the only factor. If it were so \neinstein, there would be *no swings in temperature at all.* There would be \nno ice ages or warm times, there would only be winter and summer, and that \nwould be it. But obviously even this level of grade school physics is to \nhigh for a brainwashed conspiracy theorist like you.\n\nAnd lastly:  Hahahaha^^ Man had nothing to do with the last warming or \ncoolings, since man could not produce things like emissions(which CO2 is \nonly a part of btw). However thanks to modern technology we can, and thanks \nto modern technology it is undeniable that these emissions thicken our \natmosphere, and not only on our earth but countless other planets to, it is \nclear that the thicker the atmosphere is, the more heat is trapped inside a \nplanet, the opposite happens vice versa. There are tons of data that prove \nit, by today more then 1000 examples thanks to the examination of far more \nthen 10,000 planets.\n\nBut once again: For a simpleton like you this ton of data is not only \nbeyond your understanding, but as always some cryptical and stupid \nconspiracy to. Congratulations.\n\n\n\"I hate it when you retards read one article and think you know shit and \nthen ignore everything else.\"\n\nHahahahahaha Ahahahahahaha^^\n\nOnce again that is why I love conspiracy theorists like you: Always \ntwisting around reality xD\n\n*YOU* are the ones that read 1 article(written by david icke) and think you \nfound the holy grail of knowledge, and then dare to attack and criticize \npeople like me who read countless books, articles and studied those \nsubjects in countless classes.\n\nReally the nerve of you people is unbelievable, as well as your sick twist \nof reality.

            "text": "Mars: World That Never Was\n\nDid Mars long ago develop far enough for life to arise? If so, does \nanything still live within Mars' dusty plains, beneath its ice caps, or \nsomewhere underground? \n\nIn 1964 the Mariner Four spacecraft flew by Mars and got a good look. What \nit saw looked more like the Moon than the Earth. Then, in the mid-1970's, \ntwo lander-orbiter robot teams, named Viking, went in for an even closer \nlook. The landers tested the soil for the chemical residues of life. All \nthe evidence from Viking told us: Mars is dead. And extremely harsh.\n\nThe mission recorded Martian surface temperatures from -17 degrees Celsius \ndown to -107. We now know it can get even colder than that at the poles. \nThe atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, with only traces of oxygen. And it's \nextremely thin, with less than one percent the surface pressure of Earth's \natmosphere.\n\nAnd it's bone dry. In fact, the Sahara Desert is a rainforest compared to \nMars, where water vapor is a trace gas in the atmosphere. On Earth, impact \ncraters erode over time from wind and water... and even volcanic activity. \nOn Mars, they can linger for billions of years. \n\nEarth's surface is shaped and reshaped by the horizontal movement of plates \nthat make up its crust driven by heat welling up from the planet's hot \ninterior. At half the width and only 11% the mass of Earth, Mars doesn't \ngenerate enough heat to support wide-scale plate tectonics. \n\nNor does it have the gravity to hold a thick atmosphere needed to store \nenough heat at the surface to allow liquid water to flow. Nonetheless, some \nareas that looked to Viking-era scientists like craters and volcanic areas, \nwere later shown to be riverbeds, lake bottoms, and ocean shorelines. \n\nIf water once flowed on Mars' surface, where did it all go?\n\nThis was the scene at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in 2004. The twin rovers \nSpirit and Opportunity had just bounced down on the Red Planet. When the \nexcitement died down, the rovers were set off on one of the most remarkable \njourneys in the history of planetary exploration. Missions like this could \none day pave the way for a day when we'll view images from a real \nastronaut's camera.\n\nOpportunity had come to rest in a small crater near the equator, at a spot \ncalled Meridiani Planum. Here, in plain view, on a nearby crater wall, its \ncamera revealed exposed bedrock, the first ever seen on Mars. Not far away, \nthe rover found layered rocks on the face of a cliff. On Earth, they \ntypically form as sedimentary layers at the bottom of oceans. \n\nAnd at every turn, Opportunity rolled across tiny, smooth, round pellets. \nThey became known as \"blueberries\" because they appeared purplish-brown \nagainst Mars' rust-colored surface. Initially thought to be volcanic in \norigin, they turned out to be iron-rich spherules of the type that form \nwithin cavities in the mud at the bottom of an ocean. \n\nDrilling into rocks, the rover inserted a spectrometer to read the mineral \ncontent. The readings showed significant amounts of sulfate salt, a tracer \nfor standing water. That wasn't all. Spirit's broken wheel, dragging behind \nit, exposed soils saturated in salt. \n\nClearly there once was water on Mars' surface, but how long ago? And, if \nthere is anything left, where would you find it? One possible answer: the \nNorth Pole. From orbit, this region seemed to be covered in frozen CO2 - \nwhat we call dry ice. But was there water ice below the surface?\n\nEnter Phoenix, a lander that touched down near the North Pole in early \n2008. Radar readings from orbit, taken by the Mars Express mission, hinted \nat the presence of ice just below the surface.\n\nThe Phoenix lander's descent thrusters blew away the top layer of soil, \nallowing its camera to snap pictures of what looked like ice. Scientists \ninstructed the robot to conduct a simple experiment: reach out and dig a \ntrench, then watch what happens.\n\nAs expected, clumps of white stuff appeared. A couple of days later, it was \ngone. Vaporized. That means it can't be salt or frozen CO2, which is stable \nin the cold dry temperatures of the Martian pole. So it had to be water, \nthe first ever directly seen on Mars.\n\nThere are indications that the North Pole was actually warm enough in the \nrecent past for water ice to become liquid. The Mars Reconaissance Orbiter, \nor MRO, used radar pulses to peer beneath the surface of the ice cap. These \ndata reveal that the ice, just over a mile thick, formed in a succession of \nlayers as the climate alternated between warm and cold. \n\nOur planet avoids mood swings like this in part because its spin is \nstabilized by a massive moon. Mars' spin is not, so it can really wobble, \nwith the pole tilting toward the sun for long periods. New observations by \nthe MRO spacecraft show that these wobbles can lead to dramatic releases of \nCO2, and warming periods due to an increase in the greenhouse effect.\n\nby Space Rip\n\nLength: 25 mins\ufeff",
