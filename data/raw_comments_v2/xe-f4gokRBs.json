This is something you have to think about when welding, and \nengineers have to calculate the stresses induced by welding.\n   If a weld has been done properly the welded unit never fails at the weld \nitself. The fracture happens NEXT to the weld, due to the stresses induced \nby the welding process.\n  In structural welds you never let the metal cool too quickly (by \nquenching it) but when you're learning to welt you'll put a bunch of welds \non the same piece of scrap. Quenching is common because these welds aren't \ngoing to be used for anything. I was surprised here because the glass bulb \ncontinues to glow for a lot longer than steal would. But then steel is \nquite a lot better at conducting heat so the heat in the steal moves into \nthe water much more quickly than it would in glass.\ufeff",

I get \nthe idea, however I've done some more reading on the subject and must \nreserve judgement as it gets into quantum mechanics. I can't be bothered \nwith more than a passing curiosity.\nOh, and C is defined as \"the speed of light in a vacuum\" and is 299,792,458 \nm s\u20131. In water light's speed is around 225,000,000 m s\u20131. In glass light's \nspeed is around 200,000,000 m s\u20131.\nMy memory from high school physics was not in error.

The speed of sound is much \nless than the speed of light in any case, this is why you see the flash of \nthunder before the clap. The speed of light is constant, and you're also \ncorrect that light takes more time to travel through different mediums, \nhowever the reasons behind this are extemely complex and mathematical, and \nin reality aren't the same as taking a longer route. It's late and so it's \nthe perfect time to have a go at explaining this. In reality, the beam \nlight is still traveling at C, however the light clusters together as a \nthing called a wave packet, and this wave packet moves slower than the \nlight does. It's the wave packet that you observe as your light traveling \nthrough the material. Imagine a line of people running forward at C, the \nguy at the front is carrying a bottle of light with a parachute attached, \nas he is running forward the wind pulls the bottle back, but  he is not \nable to slow down, so he has to pass the bottle back. If you were to \nmeasure the speed of the guy, it's C, but the light bottle is moving \nslower. Different mediums ie glass, water, air, have a stronger wind \nblowing on the bottle, so the light bottle will move at different speeds, \nbut only ever slower than the guys/ under C. The guys are the light, and \nbottle is the wave packet. What's a bit odd is in reality, once the guy has \npassed the bottle back, he'll dissapear, so err maybe it's a bottle of \nlife, I dunno.
