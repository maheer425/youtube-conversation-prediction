Did you ever show any to \nyour students when you were teachers? Are they as popular as k dramas in \nAmerica? And I also noticed that I haven't seen any fantasy, action, horror \nor sci-fi k dramas. I've seen one about spies, but there was hardly any \nviolence and no gore, and I know that gore is shown on TV in America (like \nThe Walking Dead or Game Of Thrones, for example). I know that a lot of k \ndramas focus on romance, but there must be some other genres? I'm pretty \nnew to k dramas so I haven't seen very many yet so maybe I haven't been \nlooking in the right places. And I've noticed that k dramas seem to be very \ninnocent (from what I've seen) and don't have any nudity and that they \ndon't seem to be very sexual, but I haven't seen very many yet, so I could \nbe wrong.\ufeff",
