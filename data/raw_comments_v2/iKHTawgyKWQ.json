Your career will be automatically decided by your soul, than \nby your conscious relentless desire to 'succeed'. gregor mendel never had a \ncareer and as he died, he was never recognised and neither was vangogh. i \ndon't think that the key is in trying too hard and not stopping due to the \nfear of failure. the key is infact NOT TO STRUGGLE!!! all great works of \nscience, maths and art were achieved by people when they truly 'enjoyed' \nwhat they liked. and i guess unnecessarily struggling doesn't qualify as \nenjoyment.\n\nlife is for enjoyment and experience and NOT FOR STRUGGLING. iF YOU PUSH \nYOURSELF TOO HARD< YOU MIGHT JUST END-UP KILLING YOUR NATURAL PASSION.\n\nhad davinci not experienced the thrill while painting the last supper, he \nwould not have even begun the work..\n\nHence, i suggest exactly the opposite. NEVER STRUGGLE to reach your dreams. \nGo to sleep, whenever you need to. Do the hardwork...without the struggle. \nif you have slept well, your work will be as good as 'hard work' (but \nwithout the struggle).\n\nif you fanatically keep chanting that 'i want to become great'; that will \nnot lead to anywhere. follow your heart... go without the struggle... go to \nbed on time (and if you are passionate, you will automatically draw energy \nand efficiency from your passion as well as your sleep)... and yes, you \nneed not be very passionate for 'success'...not necessary... life is just \nfor 'experience'... so first live well!\n\neveryone's experience is unique and equally 'great'.\ufeff",

(this can take years \nto figure out, so the earlier in life you find and perfect these the \nbetter). the reason why, this is back up.\n\n3) as you get older and are wanting to start your carrier, eventually \nnarrow your passions. And become an expert on 2-3. Make sure 1 of them at \nleast is good pay, and realistic in getting employed (example of a good \nchoice, a script writer and an intern for a set design, notice the script \nwriter is the challenging passion, the intern for a set design is more \nrealistic and will eventually pay, this will fuel the script writing). too \nmany people have one passion, they try it fail and end up working in \nsomething completely different, then live a bitter and sad life, all \nbecause one passion failed. \n\nThe important thing you need to take, is you need to fuel your passion. So \nfuel it with something you love also. The most annoying thing about most of \nour passions, is they dont pay well, unless you make it big. we are told \nfind your passion, we often start, then life gets in the way and we realise \nwe are doing somthing completely different than we aimed as the passion \ndidnt work out thus feeling we failed. Find more than once, it will improve \nyour skill set and if one doesnt work out you do the other with out feeling \nlike a failure.\n\nI know many people will say, dont have a plan b, but honestly you will be \nmiserable. I designed for a company, loved the job. but my other passion \nwas music. which is slowly becoming a way i can make a living. they fuel \neach other and it means i dont rely on music to live. these are two \npassions. and its worked(ing) for me.\ufeff",

Not for yourself.\n\n Your Masters breed you to freeze in panic, paralyze in fear when it comes \nto your own desires. \n Your Masters condition you since childhood to serve them. They present \nthemselves as your Fathers. The Fathers of the Nation and of the Country \nand Economy and Institutions and the Family and Life.\n You are being conditioned to be ready to die for a false notion such as \nthe nation.\n\n Your true self is being violated, imprisoned, denied existence, \nhumiliated, manipulated, abandoned, forsaken into a prison cell. Everything \nthat is YOU, is to be erased. Another self is to be installed in the place \nof your true self. A monstrous entity who is wired to obey and accomplish \nhis Master's volition.\n\n You are being replaced with a Slave.\n\n It is not your fault. That's what the Master wants you to feel. Like it's \nyour own fault.\n\n The clueless mouse in this video, is just another prisoner, just another \nSlave, just another jester, spewing the hateful ideology of his Masters. \nThat it is the Slave's fault for being enslaved.\n\n It is not.\n\n Your salvation comes from becoming conscious about reality. That you have \nbeen mentally castrated, chained.\n What you have to do now, is to decondition your brain from blaming and \nhating yourself, to blaming and hating your Masters. You have to \nrecondition your brain with new behavior, where Action leads to Reward.\ufeff",
