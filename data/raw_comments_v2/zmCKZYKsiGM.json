These people who insult me think I care what they say. They think \nI'm some dumb 'goyim'. Well, I'll tell you something. I don't watch one \nhour of TV a month. Not one fucking hour. I read, read, read. I read about \nhistory, politics, psychology, pharmacology, biology, everything you can \nthink of. I could destroy these self-righteous Jews in any intellectual \ndebate, but they're afraid of that, so they'll just stick to calling me \nnames (like I give a fuck what they think; think again) and wishing me \ndead. I'm so very afraid! Knowledge is power, and there are more \nknowledgeable people that understand what's TRULY going on now than most \nZionist know or are fully aware of. They think they have they entire world \nfooled and in the palm of their hands. Think again. The problem is, it's \nnot easy to make change with just knowledge alone. But it won't be \nnecessary, because they'll end up destroying themselves in the end. We just \nhave to hope they don't take everyone else out with them, but if they do \nthen it'll show their true colors even more. Look, all that matters in this \nworld is love, and karma, which is VERY real. I'm not religious, but I \nthink if any religion has the right idea, it's the Buddhists. These Jews \nthink they're so clever screwing and fucking people over using their money \nto influence things when they know nothing about how true nature really \nworks, which is why I don't care what they say to me. I just laugh at their \nignorance and stupidity. The stupidity of the Jew (not you, just most \nZionists and some other Jews who are sympathetic to the cause). Any \nsupremacist movement eventually falls in within itself. Jews have admirable \ncamaraderie and devotion to sticking together to 'stick it' to everyone \nelse, but there is always a breaking point, and we will reach that point at \nsome eventuality. Their arrogance and ignorance of the growing swell of \nknowledgeable people who know what's really going on will be their \ndownfall. I'm not worried about what will happen, not do I concern myself \nwith the average dumb Zionist. What goes around comes around. I see it \nhappen all the time, in the micro and the macro, in the context of humanity \nitself. I know so much more I could post, but I don't want to enlighten \nanyone. Knowledge is true power; not money or corporate power, or greed. \nEven love is stronger than such fools gold--and that's exactly what a lot \nof Jews and Zionists are: fools. Not you, apparently, and there are lots of \ngood Jews. There's no race that is 100% full of bad people. But the Zionist \nmovement is truly ugly and laughable.

There is significant propaganda in the Palestinian \noccupied territories against Israel and Jews. I invite you to look at their \nSesame Street ripoffs aimed at children. They are bone chilling. When Gaza \nwas returned to the Palestinian Authority there was significant \ninfrastructure there. Those pipes were almost immediately turned into \nrockets to be fired at local Israeli cities like Ashdod and Sterot. That \nbeing said, in many ways Muslim men and women in Israel are treated like \nsecond class citizens. At best, they live in a fragile harmony together. \nNot to mention the fact that during offensives in Gaza, neither Israel or \nEgypt will allow refugees to enter their states. Granted, Israel will pass \nover with flyers saying 'we are about to bomb this are' which is all well \nand good. But they are still being bombed. And these offensives only serve \nto galvanize Muslims and Palestinians against Zion. So what do we do? Does \nIsrael have a right to defend themselves? Yes. Should it be the level they \nhave chosen to do so? No. Do Palestinians have a grievance? Yes. Will \ngiving them their own state accomplish much? In my opinion, No. No one is \nright in this situation. As a Jew I am biased towards Israel and its \npeople. As a human I pray for peace. I just don't know how peace can come \nabout.
