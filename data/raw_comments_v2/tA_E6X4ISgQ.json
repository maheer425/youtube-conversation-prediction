When I put the engine in \nthe run position, the pressure would jump up to the correct psi but then \nimmediately drop. I would see if you can figure out how to check the O2 \nsensor and see if she is running rich. The bank 1 O2 sensor will have a \nhigh voltage at near .9v if it is running rich. If so, you might have a \nleaking injector. I would also see if when you rev her up, she pops. ",
