I can't even \nwatch NCIS: LA because of that stupid roll as Robin; and that show is \nsupposedly really good. :/ And Ahnold Schwarzenegger --- really, wtf? -_- \nUma Thurman isn't even that sexy --- so why her as Poison Ivy?  There are \njust so many things about Batman & Robin that made me say: Goddamit...Adam \nWest's Batman did a better job than this crackpot of a movie. and the chick \nwho was Batgirl --- what's her name again? the whole movie is a Joke.

Scharwzenegger has propelled himself to legend \nstatus with this movie. Films like \"The Godfather\" can't even match up to \nthe profound truth spoken by Mr. Freeze when he said, \"The only certain \nthing in this world is that everything freezes.\" I was moved to tears.\n\nThis deep character study is highlighted with excellent action scenes. I \nwas on the edge of my seat the entire time. When Batman and Robin pulled \nout their Bat-Skates, I was truely transported to another relm of pure \nimagination and delight.\n\nHowever, I must stress that this movie isn't for kids. The mature adult \ncontent may be too much for them, and even some adults. The profound \nemotional impact of this movie is timeless.\n\nI highly suggest that anyone who loves for life should add this masterpiece \nto their collection. In fact, get the widescreen version too so that you \nmight appreciate this perfectly crafted tale of love, and justice the way \nthe brilliant director intended for it to be.\n\n\n\ufeff",
