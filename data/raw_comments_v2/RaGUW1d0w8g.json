They obviously call it the \"Fosbury Flop\" because \nwhoever came up with the term was aiming for artistic alliteration, both \nwords beginning with \"F\". If they named it after his first name \"Dick\" they \nwouldn't have called it the \"Dick Flop\" because it's not alliterative. They \nmight have called it the \"Dick Dive\". Luckily he had both a first name and \nlast name that could be used alliteratively in his particular sporting \nevent. If his name had been \"Jones\" they would have called it the \"Jones \nJump\".

            "text": "Jumping backward has to do with both biomechanics and physics. You need to \nrealize that according to high jumping rules the athletes need to jump on \none leg. In order to achieve maximum jumping height the athletes approach \non a diagonal, slightly curved track to gain maximum momentum. In order to \ntransfer maximum momentum from running speed, the athlete will extend both \nhands and the free leg upwards raising his CM upwards in a circular motion.\n\nSince the athlete's body is extended, not retracted flopping backwards \nprovides many advantages, such as a smooth kinetic chain from extension - \nflop - clearing the bar. Also, since knees bend backwards - not forwards, \nyou can achieve a much cleaner arch of the whole body jumping backwards, \nnot forwards.\n\nFront flipping would be much more difficult, seeing how 1) it's very \ndifficult to front flip on one foot and 2) you would end up having to \nstraighten your legs over the bar after torso has passed, instead of a \nwiggly 'whiplash' movement you can do when jumping backwards\n\nSomething else that needs to be said about the flop, is that there were \ngenerally lots of different height jumping styles being tried out at the \ntime and during history. At the time of Fosbury Flop, thicker and softer \nmattresses (compared to sand pits and thin mattresses previously) had been \nintroduced to high jumping, leading the jumper not needing to be concerned \nabout a clean landing, giving much more leeway for pushing the envelope for \ntechnique.",
