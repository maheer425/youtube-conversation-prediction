This guilt/ call of conscience (as anxiety did) exposes \nDasein to his own being as finite. And Dasein as 'truth'/ unfolding/ \ndisclosing. Understanding this call of conscience/ guilt represents a \n\"conversion\" in Dasein (Religious language deliberately used, reference \nKierkegaard) what allows him to take a particular stance towards death; \nanticipatory resoluteness. This particular mode of being toward death of \nanticipatory resolute disclosedness is what Heidegger calls an authentic \nmode of being.\ufeff",

Follow the cause and effect of your beliefs to the very end. \nUse the facts you can observe and or have already been proven to the best \nof ability, (there are facts by the way; if there were no facts then we \nwouldn't be texting on this electronic device because we would have no \nfacts to use to manipulate matter into this state).\n\nI suggest face the facts that nobody knows what life is, period. Then we \ncan all start asking the right questions.\n\nWhile we go on experiencing awareness in this complex micro-biological \nsymbiotic state, let's be reasonable, stern but empathetic, and have grand \nintentions for the future forms of life to come.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nEvery 10 years people discard of 90% of their physical matter and replace \nit with different matter. Those particles are recycled and used again in \nother complex life forms. We have no choice; this is what happens. Here is \nan analogy to make this one point more clear. Captain Kirk gets teleported \nfrom one place to another; in order to do this he is first destroyed, (he \nis now dead and that life form no longer exists). Now we take all those \nparticles and put them back together. We now have created an entirely new \nform of life; this form of life doesn\u2019t know the difference. The new life \nform is comprised of particles; those particles are what experiences \nawareness.\n\nEven if you looked at the \u201chuman\u201d as an individual; when you look hard \nenough, you will see mitochondria, (which have a separate DNA). \nMitochondria produce the energy for our cells, without them we would never \nbe in this form; we are in symbiosis on a cellular level. Down to the very \nfabric of our being and on the all scales of size in the entire universe so \nsort of give and take symbiosis can be observed.\n\nThe thing that makes you an individual is the lies you tell \u201cyourself\u201d. The \nconcept of death having total lack of understanding has corrupted our \nthinking with fear. We fear death so we construct coping mechanisms. The \nsoul and religion are some of them.\n\nIn nature plants eat the stars; we eat the plants and spread/fertilize the \nseeds, (when we die the human body breaks down into the nutrients that \nplants eat); bees pollinate the flowering plants, (without bees we die); \nbirds fecal matter helps to keep soil of the forest fertile, (without the \nforest the nutrients of the soil degrades and we all die); without birds \nand the forest we all die; period. Facts! Not opinions! If you doubt it, go \nresearch it!\n\nBest think very hard about what all this means; strive to understand the \ncomplexities of our environment/reality. Nothing is as simple as we would \nlike and filling in the blanks is reckless. Reality is extremely complex; \nwe must strive to understand the depths of this complexity. Without \nunderstanding we are reduced to children running with scissors.\n\nOur perception of individualism is the biggest perceptional problem for \nhumanity to overcome next. If we do not get our egos in check and shed our \nexcessive individualism, the psychological damage will continue and destroy \nwhat we have built. Then it's back to a simple and more reactionary state \nof existence. Taking steps backwards doesn't seem logical.\n \n \n \n \ufeff",

Ok whatever.\n\nWe also believe ourselves to be separate from nature and each other!!??\n\nSome great thinker said people do the best they can with their level of \nawareness.\n\nWell how aware of reality do you really think you are?\n\nHow much do you truly understand?\n\nHow great is the probability that you really understand your own \nobservations?\n\nConnectivity and tribalism: The self no longer exists? Individualism should \nbe questioned in general. We are also addicted to the tribalism that the \ninternet gives us. Perhaps this is more evidence that we're one massive \ncomplex life form; that craves to be connected to its other brain cells of \nthe universe. I'm not sure; just saying that we should consider the \npossibility.\n\nHas individualism gone too far? I say yes. We are as much of an individual \nas the hairs on your arm. Just like the hair on your arm you get different \nsensory information; due to your physical position in space and the cause \nand effect around you but you\u2019re still part of the body.  We are the fruit \non the end of the branch of the tree of life.\n\nNow apply that to life forms on this planet as the sensory organs of the \nEarth. We are the hair follicles of the earth; or perhaps a little more \ncomplex; the eyes, ears, and brain cells of the universe.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s true and individualism is totally false. I\u2019m saying \neveryone assumes we are individuals; under what facts? If you really \nexamine the big picture; you can find evidence to say we part of all life; \nmore so than we are individuals. You just have to look at the world with \nbigger and more complex scope of view. It\u2019s not easy but its necessity for \nhumanity to adopt these principles if we want to survive, be happy, and \ntreat other life with respect.\n\nIf we had these views throughout history and education; we would never \nabuse a fellow life form in the ways we have and are right this minute.\n\nI can relate all the roots to this problem from the perception of reality \nwe are given by religion and creationism myth.\n \n1. The concept of being created by god in his image; what is the affect on \nthe mind? Well the mind then believes itself special and separate from \nnature and everything else. Hence individualism is born.  We see where that \nconcept has utterly failed; with ease. Greed, hate, creation of borders and \nterritory, (which creates war), and picking on the ugly kid at school, \n(focused on someone\u2019s appearance rather than their ability or other true \nbeauties).  All created by individualism.\n\n2. The brainwash of children at an early age when they are very susceptible \nto that sort of conditioning. Those children then grow up with the \npsychological brain wash of automatically taking everything on faith; that \ncomes from the points of authority; damaging to any society that needs to \nkeep its business and government in check.\n\nI also find it to be child abuse to lie to kids about something that big. \nMaybe tell them the whole god thing for the same ages that enjoy Santa, \nthen, tell the kid the truth when they are ready; that we are all scared \nand nobody knows what life is.\n\nThink about it; a child knows nothing, they look to an adult/parent to give \nthem good information so they can better survive; teaching them to fill in \nthe blanks when you really don't know is teaching them to worship opinions \nand make up imaginary friends instead of facing reality and their fears.\n\n3. Another psychological effect. The concept of good and bad; heaven and \nhell; led to black and white. This black and white thinking model is the \nbiggest problem we faced when trying to convince any person of any truth. \nThey always look at it as right or wrong; black or white. When the reality \nis that it\u2019s more of a grey area; there is no black and white. Things are \nalmost never as simple as that thinking model.\n\n For example; nobody really knows what life is at all; period. Here is some \nactual science and blatantly logical facts for everyone to ask what it \nmeans.\n\nEvery 10 years people discard of 90% of their physical matter and replace \nit with different matter. Those particles are recycled and used again in \nother complex life forms. We have no choice; this is what happens. Here is \nan analogy to make this one point more clear. Captain Kirk gets teleported \nfrom one place to another; in order to do this he is first destroyed, (he \nis now dead and that life form no longer exists).\n\nNow we take all those particles and put them back together. We now have \ncreated an entirely new form of life; this form of life doesn\u2019t know the \ndifference. The new life form is comprised of particles; those particles \nare what experiences awareness.\n\nEven if you looked at the \u201chuman\u201d as an individual; when you look hard \nenough, you will see mitochondria, (which have a separate DNA). \nMitochondria produce the energy for our cells, without them we would never \nbe in this form; we are in symbiosis on a cellular level. Down to the very \nfabric of our being and on the all scales of size in the entire universe so \nsort of give and take symbiosis can be observed.\nT\nhe thing that makes you an individual is the lies you tell \u201cyourself\u201d. The \nconcept of death having total lack of understanding has corrupted our \nthinking with fear. We fear death so we construct coping mechanisms. The \nsoul and religion are some of them.\n\nIn nature plants eat the stars; we eat the plants and spread/fertilize the \nseeds, (when we die the human body breaks down into the nutrients that \nplants eat); bees pollinate the flowering plants, (without bees we die); \nbirds fecal matter helps to keep soil of the forest fertile, (without the \nforest the nutrients of the soil degrades and we all die); without birds \nand the forest we all die; period. Facts! Not opinions! If you doubt it, go \nresearch it!\n\nBest think very hard about what all this means; strive to understand the \ncomplexities of our environment/reality. Nothing is as simple as we would \nlike and filling in the blanks is reckless. Reality is extremely complex; \nwe must strive to understand the depths of this complexity. Without \nunderstanding we are reduced to children running with scissors.\n\nOur perception of individualism is the biggest perceptional problem for \nhumanity to overcome next. If we do not get our egos in check and shed our \nexcessive individualism, the psychological damage will continue and destroy \nwhat we have built. Then it's back to a simple and more reactionary state \nof existence. Taking steps backwards doesn't seem logical.\n \n \n \n \n ",
