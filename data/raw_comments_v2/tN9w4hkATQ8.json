So he asks to go to the bathroom, and my teacher says yes. About 5-10 \nminutes later my teacher says, \"Student's name*, are you still in there?\" \nHe sticks his head out of the bathroom door and says, \"I'm taking a poopy.\" \nAll of us had turned, and when he closes the door again, we all start \ngigling. Then my teacher yelled at the class. So yeah, that's what happened \nin first grade. \ufeff",

I left it to the last minute and told \nsomeone to watch my stuff and whatnot and tell me what happens after i come \nback. So i power walk to not look stupid to the toilets. Luckily there is a \nfree cubicle and i race in. I was so desperate as i went in i closed the \ndoor whilst taking my trousers and whatnot down, lock the door and because \nthis was a public toilet i was so desperate i couldn't put toilet paper on \nthe seat to prevent diseases and all that bad stuff. So i squat over the \ntoilet and start pooping. Little did i know both the toilet seats were down \nso i pooped ON the toilet seat. Once i was done i turned around and \nrealised so i kinda swept the poop behind the hinges for the seat and where \nall the water goes and never spoke of it until now... \ufeff",

About 50 to 100 feet from the scene a guy comes from \nin front of me, we pass, and as he goes up to the scene, I hear 'OH, WTF \nDID THIS SHIT!!!' He was LIVID!!! So all of a sudden something came over \nme, I started to haul ass cause I knew I did it and didnt want to get \ncaught. As I flew back to the school, I got off the trail, ran up a street, \nand look back. Sure enough the guy must not have thought it was me or didnt \nwant to pursue me because I didnt even see the guy after that (Nor did I \never see him after as the track/cross country team ran on that stretch of \ntrail often)\ufeff",

I didn't want to go to school that \nday because my stomach was still a bit iffy so I made excuses and I got to \nstay home. Lucky I did because I ended up sharting myself 4 more times.

I had to \ntell my ex that it came out. I had to hold my ass so my poop won't fall off \ncause i wore a dress. I still had more poop and my stomach really hurted \nand i asked my ex to hurry. He looked disgusted and i felt humiliated. We \ncameback to my house and i ran to the bathroom and told my ex i got this. \nand he can go. While i'm dirreahing like it's '99, My dad took his phone \nand thew it on the floor and let me talk to the girl who found my phone. \nShe was from my school. I tried to hold the poop in the coverstaion, But it \ncame out and it was really loud AND SHE HEARD IT AND DIDN'T SAY A WORD FOR \n10 MINUTES. my dad drove there to takemy phone and she never talked to me \nagain.\ufeff",

I would routinely go a week, week and a half in \nbetween bowel movements and then skip using the pain killers for a day and \nhave the whole week's worth of poop come out of me all at once. Now, my \ntoilet has problems and it clogs at the drop of a hat, so the first time I \nhad one of these gargantuan craps I had already flushed once, sat back \ndown, filled the toilet well above the water line again, so I got up to \nflush a second time, and to my horror, the toilet had clogged. It not only \nclogged, but it got stuck running, so it overflowed as well... while it was \nfilled with a mound of shit the size of my head. Mind you I still had to \npoop, but that was the least of my worries now. At this point there was \nshit/piss water all over the floor and I was desperately trying to unclog \nmy toilet. I had already removed the back part and stopped it running. So \nhere I was, elbow deep inside the toilet, having given up on the plunger \nlong ago, completely naked, covered in freezing cold shit/piss water \nstanding in the grossest puddle you can imagine. Finally after 20 minutes \nof struggling I managed to tame the mighty clog and the toilet finally \ndrained. So I remounted the toilet and filled the bowl with shit 2 more \ntimes. Thankfully the toilet didn't protest these last 2 times. When I \nfinished, I cleaned up the awful mess in my bathroom and then proceeded to \ntake the greatest feeling shower I've ever taken in my life. To this day I \nuse buckets filled with water to flush my toilet just in case it decides to \nget clogged again.\ufeff",
