Sure, \"care\" \nisn't grammatically correct, but I am willing to let it slide. If you think \nI am just making this up, look up the eng subbed version of the video. \nEverything really ties into the theme of a sheltered, kind person going \ninto the world for the first time and pretty much freaking out, realizing \nhow cold and cruel people have come to be. How does this not make sense to \nANYONE else?\n\nThe into, on the other hand.....it just needs to go. End of discussion.\ufeff",
