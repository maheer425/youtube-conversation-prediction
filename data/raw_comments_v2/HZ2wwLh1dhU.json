Last and not Least, in 6th grade a girl pushed me down while playing \nsoccer (in PE) and I tried catching my self, but sadly snaped my hand back. \nTo this day I get teased at school (by my friends T.T) that I got my hand \nbroken by a girl and after I had gotten my cast off I'm now very scared to \nplay some sports that could hurt me. ;-;\n\nThat's 7 thing about me :D \ufeff",

I'm not what you call a healthy \nperson, and being lazy as fuch does not help in that regard\n\n2) Extremely introverted. In my psychology class at school we took a test \nto check our personality type, and i was INTP (which is, according to \nwikipedia, possibly the same personality type as Albert Einstein)\n\n3) Fear of dolls... Even now when I'm at my grandma's the room i'm assigned \nhas a creepy doll in it. due to this, i cover it up with my luggage, and \nclothes...\n\n4) I am smart... In school we took an IQ test (though this just one on the \ninternet, but it was on Mensa's official page.) and i ended up having an IQ \nof 131 there(top 2% of the population(atleast in Norway :S))\n\n5) Officially, I'm a christian, but it saying that \"believe in only one \ngod\" or something like that in the bible, or something. I'm not really too \nmuch of a Christian. I'm quite into a lot of religions, and mythologies, \nespecially Shinto, and Japanese mythologies... and thus I don't think that \nChristianity fits my bill...\n\n6) Musical talent, I used to play accordion, and in 2009 i won a \ncompetition thingy contest... thing...(at the time, i was 11, the day \nbefore my 12th birthday, lolz) I play guitar, and I've played bass since \n5th grade. I got 2 flutes, which i play on sometimes, and until my keyboard \nbroke, I think i could consider myself good, or at least decent in that too.\n\n7) The things i care about is weird, I can be truly upset with trivial \nstuff... Watching a movie with me is like watching Cinemasins' \"EWW\". And \nmost other, more serious stuff, i truly don't give a fuck about...\n\nBONUS) In most cases, I'm really slow. I work slow, I write slow, and most \nof all, I eat slow. However my head's not slow, i do think quite fast, I \nlove thinking, and thus can be stuck in thought... wow, that feels weird... \nbut thinking about stuff, visualizing, n'stuff... y'know... or some shiz...\ufeff",
