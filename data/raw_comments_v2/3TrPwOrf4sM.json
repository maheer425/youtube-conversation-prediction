Being excited to \ngo, we jump in the car and head out downtown till I can see the shimmering \nlight of the neon blue sign as we got closer.\n\nGetting out of the car, walking up the sidewalk, reach out and open those \nglass doors to be greeted with a plastic aroma in the air. A semi quiet but \nrelaxing atmosphere in a plethora of movies surrounding me. Walking in past \nthe security detectors, I walked row by row and seeing a cutout of 'Honey, \nI shrunk the kids' next to the comedy section.\n\nI would explore the Sci-fi section for the latest Godzilla movie I haven't \nseen yet (I was allowed to pick one movie for myself). Then after me and my \nmom picked our plastic boxes, we head to the check out stand, ring up, \nreceipt out and ventured back home.\n\nLater in life, I would go with a couple friends to check out a local \nHollywood video on a Friday night. It was an awesome feeling renting a PS2 \ngame for the weekend after a long, hard week of school. Discovering new \ngenres of entertainment like Anime (my first being Akira).\n\nToday, I simply tune in on a few apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and \nRedbox if I feel the need to watch the newest release. I will dearly miss \nthe feeling of walking through a library of films and their fantastic box \nart.\n\nHeh, I never would of thought of judging a book by it's cover, but it \nhelped me make my decisions even after reading the back side of the empty \nbox. Now....I simply look at the ratings on a virtual screen without a \nsecond glance.\n\nI'll truly miss those days. Goodbye, Blockbuster.\ufeff",
