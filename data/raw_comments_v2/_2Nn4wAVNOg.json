Stunt Pilot ethnicity and specific plane \nmodel availability are the two things that cannot be considered, since you \nfoolishly brought one of these factors up, I checked you  with the other.\nLet me school you on a few things\n1--Wrong insignia to be the USSR, It's not like it was hard for a major \nmovie to use the right national insignia or other war movies were not using \nactual soviet insignia to represent fictional soviet hardware.  YOU HAVE NO \nRESPONSE TO THIS\n2--The country in question considered part of the Indian Ocean their \n\"territorial waters\".  That means they border on the fucking ocean retard, \nnot a thousand miles away with non-aligned nations between them and the \nactual ocean.  Oh and a Soviet declaration of the Indian Ocean belonging to \nthem would be an act of war itself.  That's like Canada trying to claim \nsovereignty over the fucking gulf of Mexico.  BASIC GEOGRAPHY DISAGREES \nWITH YOUR PREMISE, YOU HAVE NO RESPONSE.\n3--The Russians did not have nor did they need French Exocet missiles, they \nhad much better anti-ship missiles of their own design.  Many poor \ncountries during the cold war bought hardware from Russia and then bought \nsoftware and missiles from France since it was much, much better than \nexport model Russian stuff.  USE OF FRENCH MISSILES DISQUALIFIES THIS \nADVERSARY BEING THE USSR, YOU HAVE NO RESPONSE TO THIS.\n.4--Soviet doctrine, just like American doctrine was about doing anything \nto avoid flagrantly attacking the other side's planes or ships in \ninternational waters, which could lead to major conflict or nuclear \nexchange.  Soviet pilots doing some shit like that would have been executed \nif they survived the fight and they know that.  FOR YOUR PREMISE TO BE \nTRUE, THE SOVIETS WOULD HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR DAMN MINDS.\n5--In both the Korean and Vietnam war, the absolute most advanced Russian \nfighters were sent to these client states to fight the west (Mig-15, and \nMig-21 respectively), they were export models though.  HISTORY PROVES YOU \nWRONG, PART 1\n6--During the Cold war, there were DOZENS of small actions like this \nbetween US or Soviet forces and some shitty little client state of the \nother, THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED IT THE COLD WAR, it was fought by small proxy \nwars all over the globe.  This action being a fictional Soviet client state \nfits in perfectly with what actually went on during the cold war.  HISTORY \nPROVES YOU WRONG, PART 2\n7--\"New\" aircraft is a relatively flexible term, they are \"new\" to us \nbecause we hadn't seen them up close before.  During the Cold war, each \nside often had weapons systems operational for several years before the \nother side really knew much about them, in fact it was usually encountering \nexport models of said equipment sent to client states that first contact \nwith such weaponry was made.  Again, this fits perfectly with the story \npresented in Top Gun as the \"first time anyone's been that close before\".  \nHISTORY PROVES YOU WRONG PART 3.\n\nSeriously, are you retarded or are you 15 or something?  Rarely have I \nencountered a person who tries to speak with such authority about shit he \nOBVIOUSLY knows nothing about.",
