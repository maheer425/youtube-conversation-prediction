            "text": "+carmine Saying that you shouldn't be questioned or criticised because \nsomeone else did something worse is like saying that a murderer shouldn't \nbe prosecuted because someone else is a murderer and a rapist.\n\nGermany paid dearly for what her governments did during the First World War \n(wich they didn't start, by the way) and the Second one; both the french \nand british empires have been almost completely dismantled (the british \nstill have to give back the Falklands, but that's an issue between them and \nus) and the spanish and portuguese empires are virtually nonexistant. Since \nMao's death, China is a generally moderate, not-so belligerant power (even \nregarding their most intense conflicts) and Russia has so far stayed close \nto it's borders (still, it sucks to be their neighbour).\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, is the most active and belligerant \nempire still standing as such. Not to mention that it's the main \ndestabilizer worldwide. Take Latin America: At the begining of the 20th \ncentury, almost every country was growing (at different pases); some doing \nreasonably well, while others were stuck; and the ones doing worst were the \nones closest to the US, except for Mexico. By 1950 you alredy have several \nproxy dictatorships in central and south America, and some other \nnationalistic, somewhat anti-US governments. By 1975 almost every state is \neither in the middle of a political crisis, a civil war, or a proxy, pro-US \ndictatorship. By 1995 the US-sponsored (read \"imposed\") Washington \nConsensus (aimed at scrapping all latin american welfare and protectionist \nstates, completely opening latin markets to foregin import and global \nfinance, indexing their national monetary systems to the US dollar and \nprivatizing everything, including basic social services) had brought every \ncomplying latin nation to a full economic, social and political crisis \n(virtually every country in south America had at least one president being \noverthrown) and by 2005, even thou Bush kept insisting terrorism was our \nmain concern, the biggest problem was apalling levels of misery, global \ndrug cartels and economic stagnation.\n\nAnd all this was a direct, empirically proven result of US intervention in \nthe region. There are vast amounts of evidence showing how the US killed, \nextorted or bribed key latin figures and financed rivaling parties to \npromote conflict and instability and subordination. And again, keep in mind \nthat we're talking about a region that by the middle of the 19th century \nadmired you, tried to emulate your political achievements and sought you \nfor guidance. Latin America was your ally, and you treated it like garbage, \nand now you wonder why you're so hated and why latin americans complain so \nmuch about you.\n\nThe closest you ever got to trully acknowledging your past \"mistakes\" (read \n\"horrendous atrocities\") was with president Carter, who had the guts to say \nyour previous policies were both wrong and contrary to your national \nprinciples, and would ultimately lead to a worsening global scenario, and \nyou sacked him to put a guy who happily promoted an increased in US \nmilitarization and aggresion. So that's basically why we focus on you \nrather than Russia, China, (the defunct) Nazi Germany or Britain: because \nyou're still killing us, be it directly thru military intervention, or \nindirectly by promoting internal conflicts and crisis.",

Thank you for a wonderful teaching example: in addition to \nbeing informative, you've also given us an understanding of some of the \nhistoriographical debates taking place in a way that is mercifully \nunderstandable. I see in the comments below that others have already \noffered some critiques, but I think this is wonderful. I may end up using \nsome of these vids for classes in future, if that would be acceptable.\ufeff",
