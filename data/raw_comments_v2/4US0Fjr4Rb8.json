I can see Wahlberg's character (who can't land a ship to save his \nlife) going back in time at the end, but how the hell did his small scout \nship make it all the way back to Earth...randomly?  And how did the ape \ngeneral make it back to Earth (presumably sometime in the 1700's or 1800's \ngoing by the Lincoln memorial?)  There were no more flyable ships.  Unless \nthe apes figured out how to repair/build spacecraft.  And wasn't he deposed \nby the end of the movie?\n\nEven if he did go, he would have ended up in a traveling circus or \nvivisected, not the leader of a nation.\n\nAny similarity that ending had to the novel's ending was happenstance.  Tim \nBurton just wanted his own twist ending to \"match\" the original.\n\nBTW, if Marky-Mark had ended up stuck on the planet, who else would have \npreferred he end up with the ape scientist instead of Estella Warren?",
