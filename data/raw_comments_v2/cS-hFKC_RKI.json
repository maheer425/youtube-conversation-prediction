The city is a spectacular matrix of villages, towns and cities, \nstrung together by a super-efficient rail system.\nTradition, ritual and respect are the hallmarks of Japanese society. This \nis a place that cherishes its children, reveres its elderly, and treats \nvisitors like honored guests.\nBegin your Tokyo journey in the ancient town of Asakusa, home to the city\u2019s \noldest temple, Sensoji. Then head to the suburb of Harajuku, renowned as a \ncenter of youth culture and fashion and home to one of Tokyo\u2019s largest \ngreen spaces, Yoyogi Park.\nJust to the north of Yoyogi Park, is Meiji Shrine, dedicated to the father \nof modern Japan, Emperor Meji.\nAt Shibuya, cross one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world, and \nat Ginza explore huge department stores and tiny yakitori joints and beer \nhalls around Yurakucho Station.\nStroll down Marunouchi\u2019s wide tree-lined avenues, then explore the anime, \nmanga, electronics stores in Akihabara Electric Town.\nRelax in Shinjuku Gyoen National Gardens, then ride the elevator to the \nobservatories of Tokyo Tower and Mori Tower for views across Tokyo Bay and \nto Mt Fuji.\nTokyo is filled with award-winning restaurants, but for the freshest sushi \nand sashimi, head to the Tsukiji Fish Markets.\nThe historic port city of Yokohama is only a half hour train ride from \ncentral Tokyo. Another great day trip is Narita, a fascinating window into \nold Japan.\nExpedia\nhttp://www.expedia.co.jp/\ufeff",

Most cities in North America are kind of new(I mean cities but not \nbuildings, lol), there was no any buildings before European immigrants went \nthere, it made it very easy to make new buildings in order. But in cities \nlike Tokyo, with hundreds years of history, (1200+ years for Tokyo, used to \nbe called Edo/\u6c5f\u6238/\u3048\u3069), new buildings need to be built in old city's \nstructures, which basically means new stuff can only be made after old \nstuff had been partly removed. (Is my explanation clear enough? lol, I'm so \nbad at English) And if you look specifically into each blocks or \nneighbourhood, it will be very ordered, organized and clean. (Tokyo is only \nof the most clean and safe cities in the world) and actually, lol, Tokyo \nhas one of the best infrastructures, such as its transportation system. It \nhas the most complex subway/metro system, and, have you ever heard Japanese \nbullet trains?",
