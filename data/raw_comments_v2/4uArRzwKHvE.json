I remember 1994 \nwell. The US was still heavily engaged in mopping up the Gulf War, \nprotecting the Kurds in Northern Iraq and defending the No-Fly Zone (a \ncomplex discussion in itself), attempted to organize support for UN \npeace-keeping action in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the capture of Slobodan \nMilosevic, the list goes on.  The US was directly involved with resolving \nthe Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Haiti, not to mention the concern over \nBin Laden's activities.  At the same time, congress was pressing \nlegislation to cut military spending, disbanding USSR tracking operational \nsites, BRAC, and countless other defense spending cuts.  One of the popular \ncatch phrases asked by Americans (but not ONLY Americans) at that time was \nthe rhetorical question, \"Should America be the world's police?\"  As for \nthe Congo, the lack of direct action was not impotence on the part of \nAmerica, but on the part of the UN, as it was the Clinton administration \nthat believed - as did most foreign policy advisers/scholars - that this \nshould be a UN joint effort as was the Balkans.  I would not debate \n\"impotence,\" but it was impotence by the UN security counsel.  And guess \nwhich country in that group was apposed to intervention in the Congo and \ncaused delays UN action?  Hint: It wasn't the US.  This \"...often as an \nexample of the impotence of America in the face of post Cold War problems\" \nis not something you just say in a media forum like this and not qualify \nit.

Looking back, \nI think I'm beginning to understand what the prof meant during that lecture \nfinally. To put it simply, IMF's loan policies don't work because the \nenforced austerity measures degrade the living standards of countries it is \nenforced in (via putting the country's efforts into paying back a loan that \ncannot be put towards public spending, i.e. development of hospitals, \nschools, and other infrastructure, and instead into \"resource development\", \na polite way of saying \"resource and labour exploitation\"), until that \ncountry is functionally enslaved to this cycle of loan->resource \ndevelopment (mining, fisheries, logging)->loan payoff (the interest rates \nof which ensure that this cycle doesn't end until that country's situation \nis so insurmountable that it can be \"pardoned\" a la post-WWII Germany). \nThat lecture had focused on the situation in Greece, but this appears to be \nan even older example of the same thing, but in the Congo. Is there any \nexample of when the IMF shelled out a loan with policies like this that \nworked?

Belgium, the United States (via the CIA), and the \nUnited Kingdom (via MI6) have all been accused of involvement in Lumumba's \ndeath.*\n\nAccording to Democracy Now!, \"Lumumba's pan-Africanism and his vision of a \nunited Congo gained him many enemies. *Both Belgium and the United States \nactively sought to have him killed. The CIA ordered his assassination but \ncould not complete the job. Instead, the United States and Belgium covertly \nfunneled cash and aid to rival politicians who seized power and arrested \nLumumba.*\"\n\nBoth Belgium and the US were clearly influenced in their unfavourable \nstance towards Lumumba by the Cold War. He seemed to gravitate around the \nSoviet Union, although according to the opinion of Sean Kelly this was not \nbecause he was a Communist, but the USSR was the only place he could find \nsupport in his country's effort to rid itself of colonial rule. The US was \nthe first country from which Lumumba requested help.\n\n*Lumumba, for his part, not only denied being a Communist, but said he \nfound colonialism and Communism to be equally deplorable, and professed his \npersonal preference for neutrality between the East and West*.\n\n*According to David Akerman, Ludo de Witte and Kris Hollington, the firing \nsquads were commanded by a Belgian, Captain Julien Gat; another Belgian*, \nPolice Commissioner Verscheure, had overall command of the execution site.\n*De Witte found written orders from the Belgian government requesting \nLumumba's execution and documents on various arrangements, such as death \nsquads*.\n\nAccording to Adam Hochschild, author of a book on the Congo rubber terror, *Lumumba's \nbody was later cut up and dissolved in acid by two Belgian agents*.\nOn the afternoon and evening of 21 January, Commissioner Soete and his \nbrother dug up Lumumba's corpse for the second time, cut it up with a \nhacksaw, and dissolved it in concentrated sulfuric acid. Only some teeth \nand a fragment of skull and bullets survived the process, kept as \nsouvenirs.\ufeff",

Because of the Belgian history in Congo, we get lessons in history \nabout Congo to make us aware that we really did such awful things and not \nto hide it, the proof is there.\nI really like that you make a video about that, though you are wrong in \nsome places. So is the first elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who \nwanted to push the west away. King Baudouin I wanted to keep Congo close, \nfor its own good and ofcourse personal reasons such as profit. But because \nLumumba was so anti-Belgium (understandable) he didn't want to do anything \nwith Belgium. Baudouin I said \"fine\" and then did the cowardly act of \n'stealing' away most of the infrastructure (factories moved back to \nBelgium, stolen all the gold out of the treasury, retreating all the \nteachers back to Belgium,..) which was the cause of the economic crisis in \nCongo. Lumumba was later assassinated by the CIA because Congo contacted \nthe USSR for help (If the West wont help you, go to the USSR, that was the \nlogical thing to do back then). So not only is Belgium and Congo itself \nresponsible for the downfall, so is the CIA, in other terms, so is the USA. \nBAM, pulled in!\n\nAlso, the main reason why China is interested in Congo, is the reason why \nthere is war in the resource valley. Coltan. Coltan is an element that you \ncan only find in Congo and it has a very low resistance, which makes it an \nexcellent conductor for technology (phones, computers, consoles, TVs...). \nChina goes to Congo so they can get there hands on it to lower the costs of \ngetting it to China, in turn to increase the profit. \n\nIsn't the world a lovely place?\n\nNext time, use more then 2 citations and do beter research, you're giving \nthe people a wrong idea. \ufeff",
