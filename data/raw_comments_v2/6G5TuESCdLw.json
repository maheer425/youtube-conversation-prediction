It makes me sad since it was inevitable for me to see some of \nthe fans, leaving the fandom since they've seen how the concepts of these \nboys had changed. \n\nWell, it's normal don't you think? A lot of KPOP groups (even your favorite \nones) are changing their concepts, and sometimes they (the fans) don't give \na damn about it. But why is it that when NU'EST changed their concept (a \nlittle), a lot of you were saying that you'll leave the fandom and were \nlike disappointed with them and how they changed? \n\nYou know, if you're a real fan of NU'EST, you will accept them for who they \nare and not by just their looks, talents or even concepts, in which it \nseems like a lot of fans were digging into (but I have to admit that TALENT \ncounts). Ans not even about how you want them to do a concept like FACE and \nAction, or even Ren's blonde hair. \n\n\u201cDon't be sad because it ended, smile because it happened.\u201d\u2015or so to say. \n\nYou guys should be thankful since NU'EST are always doing their best to \nmake US fans happy. \nAnd I know that somehow, they are facing a crisis with their promotions, so \nwe should cheer for them, and not neglect them, and leaving their fandom, \nwhich is not ACTUALLY helping them.\n\nAnd yep, I know that I'm just a new fan, and new fans 'don't know anything \nsince you're just a newbie or whatever', but I could tell you that I knew \nalready and I'm aware and greatly concerned about NU'EST, since I love them.\n\nThey might not be that much popular (no offense), but we'll just have to \nwait and support them, and maybe in the next few years, they will be one of \nthe most popular groups in South Korea. Nothing is impossible, only believe \nit, and it will.\n\nNU'EST \u3134.\u3147.\u3145.\u314c. jjang~!\ufeff",

            "text": "+Bea Carreon Totally agree. I like them because they do not stick to one \nconcept. They are willing to try new ones. For some groups, we can expect \nwhat kind of songs will come with them, NU'EST surprised me everytime. They \nare really very hard-working. Just take Minhyun as example. His vocal \nskills has improved a lot and from the collaboration with a female singer \nFromm in her recently relased album, Minhyun is so good. (Fromm - \"The \nAftermath\" feat. Minhyun). Also. their upcoming 2nd Japanses \nsingle\"NA.NA.NA.Namida\" is very nice (I really hope that there will be a \nKorean version). (p.s. The full version of the MV has not been officially \nreleased but has been shown on a Japan TV program, so, if you want to take \na look, try this link: www.dailymotion.com/video/x2opshi )Although it's a \nbit sad that they are not popular in Korea, I hope one day they can and \nthey will.",

In short, self-harm. I just didn't get why \nMinhyun represent that thing. Maybe he experience that kind of thing and \ncame up with that suicidal thing? Who knows, and I hope he's not :/\nAnd in Jr's scene.. The fish represents their success(which I've read of \nmost of the comments). You see, at first Jr can't catch the fish but \nsooner, he got it and ate it. I assume that even if they failed, from time \nto time they'll achieve their success. \n\n\nYou can check: \nhttp://nuest-stuff.tumblr.com/post/91246907287/the-meaning-behind-good-bye-bye \nfor better understanding :)",
