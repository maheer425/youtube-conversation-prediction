The thought being to use the panel you \nhave, focus it on a boiler which delivers steam to a small steam engine \nwhich in turn uses a drive shaft/belt to deliver the energy to an \nelectrical generator?  Would be a cool experiment (pardon the pun).  My \nonly concern would be the pressure associated with the 2000 degree cooker \non the boiler which was addressed by governors well over a century ago.  \nHave heard of people using parabolic mirrors to focus the beam on the \nboiler, but those look spooky to me as the hot water is up in the air and \nfocused skyward rather than downward as your cooker shows.  I could see \nplacing the magnifying lens of your cooker on a gamble that would track for \nthe angle of the sun ensuring a consistent heat on the boiler.  If you used \ndistilled water, you would recirculate condensed water back into the system \nto be reheated reducing deposits in the boiler and piping.\ufeff",
