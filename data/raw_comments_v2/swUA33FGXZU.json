The  US military strategic \ncommand twice requested a nuclear strike during the war of aggression \nagainst Vietnam and Korea. The only reason it was put off the table was \nbecause the public outcry would literally see the public jump the white \nhouse lawn and storm that government building. \n\nThe definition of what is a considered a \"conflict\" has been so convoluted \nand ambiguous, that to singularly use the term \"war\" in a conclusive \nnarrative is mute. These countries are giving a generalized definition of \nwhat they considered an attack to be. India and Russia reserved the right \nto deploy a first strike strategy should any military action is taken \nagainst them. Russia pulled out of this agreement because they are \nwitnessing the continuous expansion of NATO literally to their door step. \nAs a military strategy to implement a first strike solution is perhaps \ntheir only security measure from what is a full European invasion. To show \ntheir lack of fear against any Russian threat. NATO has continuously \nviolate treaty after treaty without any reprisal. \n\nBritish military strategy is that if a Weapon of Mass Destruction is used \nagainst their \"troops\". Again, this is ambiguous. Weapon of Mass \nDestruction is so vaguely defined by both the United Nation and the British \ngovernment. Weapons of Mass Destruction could literally include anything \nthe British government deeds a weapon of Mass Destruction. Also, \"troops\" \nnot troops at home, But, troops, which could included troops stationed \nanywhere or deployed anywhere.\n\nThe US reserved the right to use their nuclear weapon as a deterrent. A \ndeterrent is also so vaguely defined that the deterrent could be as the \nBritish policy have it an attack against their troops at any of their 700 \nbases across the globe and deployed almost equally.\n\nWe delude ourselves to assume that the lunatics in other countries are \nsomehow different from the lunatics in our countries. These individuals are \npoised with their finger over that button ready and willing to press it at \nany given moment and your presence or existence as civilians annoys them to \ntheir core and more so despise the idiots you elect to tell them what to do \nand when to do it. \n\nEach day is another day to give thanks.\ufeff",

Rather, the threat of \nSoviet Invasion loomed over them, as the Soviets stormed Manchukuo (also \nknown as Manchuria), preparing for invasion. and the United States couldn't \nallow the Soviets to gain that amount of power, and control over the \nJapanese Islands. Therefore, the nuclear bombings were to force a surrender \non US terms, as opposed to a surrender on Soviet terms. Even during World \nWar 2, the Western Allies (US, France, Britain, etc.) and the Soviets were \ntrying to gain the upper hand on each other. Another example of said \nconflict between the Allies was Operation Unthinkable. Look it up, I'm too \nlazy t say what it is.",

Some have contributed to end these problems.\n\nThe British constantly went in and out of the Middle East claiming \nterritory, and the Arabs (mostly) were mad that they had control of what \nthey thought was their territory (foreign control is a huge problem to \nextremists, and this terrorist organizations are created). Not to mention \nthey promised both Israel and the Arabs a homeland which they did not keep. \nThe Balfour declaration stated that Jews could have a homeland in \nPalestine. The UN kept backing Israel in wars and this angered the Arabs. \nChaos and terror groups created\n\nWhen USSR (Russia today) invaded Afghanistan in 1979 for the sole purpose \nto spread communism, the Afghans were infuriated and thus the rebel group, \nthe Taliban, was created. They wanted to drive USSR troops out of \nAfghanistan, but thy still exists today terrorizing. They claim they want \nto get rid of foreign control still. Most Middle Eastern nations also faced \nthe wrath of the USSR during the Cold War.\n\nWhen Saddam Hussein lead Iraq to invade Iran and used chemicals warfare \n(humans right violation) the hole purpose was to gain oil. He tried to get \ncontrol of the Suez Canal. Hussein also invaded Kuwait which had tons of \noil. He wanted to gain control so he could take Kuwait's oil and transport \nit to Iraq. The thing about oil is, when one petroleum exporting country \ncannot export oil (which Iraq prevented), the the price of oil increases \neverywhere. This hole crisis led to many many countries and the UN imposing \neconomic sanctions on Iraq to weaken them. The U.S. would later capture \nHussein and British and American troops led a coalition to prevent nuclear \nweapons which Iraq may have acquired (but they didn't).\n\nToday, the hole purpose the U.S. (And MANY other countries; but led by the \nU.S.) are in the Middle East is to eliminate terrorists. There are an \nincredible amount of countries that have joined the fight against ISIS, \nbecause our world is seeing that human right violations, terrorism, and \ngenocides are NOT acceptable, and this is why we all can be proud to say we \nstand strong.",

In \nthe '80s Argentina military started to consider arming nuclear weapons \nafter the UK carried tactical nukes to the South Atlantic during 1982's and \nthe fear that they might have bombed Cordoba city if a carrier would be \nsunk in the conflict. So Brazil followed to make nuclear warheads to \ncounter balance Argentina if that scenary makes real.\nIn the late 1980s, ealry 1990 Argentina and Brazil created a binational \norganization to control the nuclear programs of each other and signed a \nresignation to further persuit in nuclear weapons but keeping the complete \ncicle for making the bombs. So today Argentina and Brazil are nuclear \ncapable countrys with mines, enrichment plants, technology and capabilitys \nto make nuclear warheads but have self resigned to make em, but they can \nactivate em in case of inminent danger from extracontinental menaces if \nneeded in a short period of time.\nThe International Agency of Atomic Energy DOES NOT controls both countrys \ndirectly as in the rest of the world, instead each country controls the \nother and submit reports to it.\ufeff",
