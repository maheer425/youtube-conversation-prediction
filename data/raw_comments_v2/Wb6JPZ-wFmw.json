I don't really care about \nboobs or anything, I just find that fat girls get me turned on. I like \ngirls that have a bigger belly, especially if it jiggles when she walks.\nI also find it attractive when girls eat a lot, especially if they eat \nsomething besides a salad or something.\n\nDONT JUDGE ME ITS WHO I AM!\nEveryone is just born with certain preferences.\ufeff",

Is dangerous, cuz for young girls this sort of \nreinforcement make them want more compliments - because, let's face it who \ndoesn't - and they all end up just searching this crazy perfect looks that \nthey will never get because perfection is a stupid illusion.

It really comes down to the relative cost of \nsexual reproduction for each sex, sperm are cheap pregnancy is not, so (in \nthe scenario that no laws prevent it) men are able to mate with many women \nbut a woman can only mate with so many men before she becomes pregnant. \nThese behaviors are reversed with the advent of anti-polygamy laws and \nmodern contraceptives, but their inherent influence still remains prevalent \nin society in what each sex finds desirable.\ufeff",

Let\u2019s take for \nexample 2 people who are in most other ways similar but one is male and the \nother is female. One of the noteworthy ways these two are similar, however \nunfortunate, is that they both by the standards of our society are fairly \nugly. The female in this case has an incredibly wide array of options to \ndeal with this that are absent for the male in the form of cosmetics. In \nthis light one could argue the counter point that it is unfair that men \n\u201ccan't\u201d wear makeup. One thing that makes this complaint by women sound so \nhallow to me is that they already have monumental advantage in the \nparticulars of the social circumstance that this video is referring to and \nthat is attracting the attention of a potential mate of the opposite sex. \nJust to be clear I would totally be willing to trade a little extra time \ngetting ready each day for the all of the privileges women have in this \nsocial situation. What privileges do I mean you ask? Most notably is the \nability to enters a social setting, sit down and wait for someone to \n approach taking all the risk of rejection onto them self and very likely \nmaking offerings of sustenance and entertainment for the opportunity to win \nyou over. Yes I would make that swap in a heartbeat. One last thing on the \nsubject of girls basing self worth on being attractive to boys and \nwell.....a similar phenomenon exists for us also over here on the male side \nalso, especially at younger ages such as during high school, our self worth \nmay be measured in large part by our successes with the ladies.\ufeff",

            "text": "Not all boys, like this one making this comment, are attracted to females. \nThat will probably change, as bodies continue to go through pub, not the \nbar, I mean growth. Still in the middle of it. I have seen 7th graders who \nlove each other then, and 10th graders starting to be attracted to each \nother. Also do not find it weird that say a 9th grader is attracted to an \n8th grader, think about it, your mom and dad might be a couple years apart. \nCouldn't 13 year olds do the same with a 14 year old? Enough about that, \nbut parents should probably not be using the slogan just don't have sex, \nthat is probably not enough, especially to 17 year olds, who have \ntransportation, a very independent mind and a body just out of pub that \nthat is ready to reproduce, or at least preform the actions to do simulate \nit without actually making a child. Instead, try saying that 1/4 of birth \ncontrol methods other than actually doing something like clamping the tubes \nfrom the ovaries to the womb, therefore making it impossible to make a \nbaby, they fail, which may release not only sperm cells, but also STD. \nPerhaps show a picture of someone with syphilis. That would be pretty \ncreepy, maybe list the symptoms. Romantic behavior is not always bad, as \nlong as the relationship, is not one of domination or with either one \nfeeling bad about it, then again, some may be embarrassed to have one, but \nI mean bad about being in a relationship because of the other party. It is \nfine to be open, and while I haven'y felt what is feels like, the teachers \nalmost certainly have, I heard it is like your legs are almost literally \nmade of jello, or that you feel compelled to draw the face of the crush all \nday, and can't concentrate on anything else, which may be a problem in \nschool, so maybe the school should try to work with that, adding it to any \nindividual programs, like my school board has something called Individual \nProgramming plan for someone with anything that could make a problem in \neducation, and because of autism, I had a goal of raising my hand a certain \nnumber of times per week, but I really didn't care about that part because \nwhen it was in effect, I did not read my IPP, it was pretty much only \nrelevant to the teachers and two parents, my own, involved. They didn't \nflat out tell me: Ok, raise your hand X times per week or something else \nwill happen. They just monitored and tried making questions they knew I was \neager to answer. Teenage bodies are designed to attract those of the \nopposite sex, just like other animals. Male peacock feather displays, \nbelieve it or not, try to attract female peacocks to mate. Humans have \nother things, like lips and hair, styled to make others want to be with \nthem. Same with breasts and pecs for men, I have friends who are growing \nmustaches, and a primary purpose of them is to attract. You know the \nMyth-busters, the TV show? They put Kari in various sized things I forget, \nD size, C size, I don't know what they are referring to, but it was on the \nepisode on laws of attraction. She made more money, pretending to be a \nbarrister in the D size than the c size because they apparently made her \nmore attractive. Some things humans do exclusively for the purpose of \nattracting one another. Humans celebrate Valentines day the the purpose of \ncelebrating love, and people dedicate their lives to studying it. \ufeff",

Sure, it's technically still a choice, but if there are negative \n(and, depending on your location and career path, sometimes severe) \nconsequences being imposed on a particular choice, it's not exactly a free \nchoice.\nI mean, most of us would love to not care what society thinks and go to \nwork in our pyjamas with no makeup, but a lot of us need to care if we want \nto get a promotion, and I think that's important to take into account when \nyou're talking about why women wear makeup, and if they should.",

            "text": "+Schnappi fckingcrocodile That depends on your understanding of coercion. \nStudies show that women who don't wear makeup are less likely to be hired. \nThey're less likely to receive assistance from others if they need help or \nmake a mistake. They're less likely to be perceived as responsible, less \nlikely to be perceived as intelligent, and less likely to be perceived as \nfriendly. Women who wear makeup do better--objectively--in their careers \nand social lives because people perceive them and treat them better. So \nyeah, there is kind of an ultimatum to wearing makeup.\nNot to mention, there are definitely workplaces (especially administrative \ncareers--trust me, you won't find a female CEO that doesn't wear makeup) \nthat require women to wear makeup. Shit, I've even worked in offices where \nwomen were not only required to wear makeup, but required to be skilled in \napplying it, and they would be pulled aside and talked to if their makeup \nwasn't blended well enough.",
