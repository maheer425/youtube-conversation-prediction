Only in some part of Iran \nyou can get to, But seriously, In Tehran (the capital) You CAN'T!!! But you \nmight in Shiraz (another place in Iran) It seems also IMPOSSIBLE to get to \nYouTube!!! But you ask how I am able to reach YouTube? Well, I live in \nAustralia in WA, So yeah, Actually, If you ask me, The Iranian Government \nand Public have blocked alot of websites down, It's so annoying!!! I can \nbarely even REACH YouTube!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Plus Like or Comment if \nyour from/are/in Iran!!\ufeff",
