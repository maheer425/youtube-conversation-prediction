First of all u must stydie \nchristian history, and everything, god didn't said that people who don't \nbelieve in god will burn and will suffer by Satan (Amin), if it's like that \nwhy did he let us think like we want? He could have programed us like we \nprogram computer, so that we would believe in God. Atheist people are rude, \nthey don't know religion, they make jokes and laugh about God and Jezus. Is \nthat okey? They stand on wall and do like Jezus. And when we christians say \nthat not believing in God is bad u ppl think we are \"the bad ones\". I have \na bitch teacher an atheist when i said i believed in god she and my \nclassmates made jokes about my religion and they tried yo pull me to \ndevil.(amin) they tried to say that God doesn't exhists and that i must not \nbelieve in God. You ppl are idiots. Some christians aren't christians. And \nppl like this man who insults ppl who don\"t believe in God will go to hell, \nhe is just making us, christians look like bad ppl. If u r atheist and u \nhelp ppl from your heart, u will go to heaven. Doesn't matters if u believe \nin god or not, it's about what you do. The God will say where you will go, \nto heaven or to hell, and god didn't make hell for bad ppl. Read the bible \nand then u will understand everything. You know why many ppl believe in God \nen the Son of the God Jezus, cause all stories have deep taughts which some \natheist and also christians don't get it. This is the truth, it's about \nwhat you do in your life, if you believe in God, it is better (i saybit \ncause i believe). So it's your choice because God gave us choice, to think \nas we want and to live like we want.and if u laugh at our old religion, u r \nbad person and u r the 1 who is bad person and not us(christians) when we \nsay don't believing in God is the wrong path. Don't tesg God, by that i \nmean falling expres from a building and waiting that God will save you, God \nwill save you when you don't do it expres and don't test him. 90% of \natheists around world are laughing ar our religion and joking about Jezus \nwhen he was sufferd to save us from the dead. So, first learn about \nreligion and then do the talkie walkie. By the way sorry if my english is \nbad/orbi spell wrong.\ufeff",

When theists stop pretending that they are \"holy\" some how or always \nright, maybe perhaps these discussions will level out on the playing field \nutilizing more logic.

What's \nworse, is that most who claim to be atheist are those that oppose the \nBible. It is fine to oppose the Bible, but the alternative is not \nnecessarily atheism.

There is the very unlikely possibility Isaiah was \nreferring to Hebrew, which is technically a Canaanite language. However, \nHebrew was also never adopted by the Egyptians.\n\nI can do this all day, but I will move on to the next part.\n\n\"I will never have any kids that will do any of those things you mentioned \nbecause I will seek God before I get together with my wife\"\n\nThat's not an answer to the question I asked. I asked, are you going to \nteach your child the entire bible, and your answer is basically that you'll \ndo the impossible and have children that never disobey. It seems to me that \nyou are cherry picking the parts of the bible that you like and doing away \nwith the rest. Which Jesus (according to the bible) addresses people who do \nthat in Matthew 5:19.\n\n\"People have to humble themselves and pray and seek Gods face and turn from \ntheir wicked ways then God will her from heaven\"\n\nI donate to cancer research every month, I do charity work weekly, and I'm \nalways really quick to help people whenever I can. If that is \"wicked\", \nthen I'd rather be wicked over what the bible tells people to be \n(unintelligent, immoral pawns).",

For people that are smart enough they will find out that the \nbible proves its self to be the truth. Like the prophecy that says 1000 \nyears before it happends that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem. Isiaiah did \nprophecy that Jesus would die betweeb 2 ungodly and he did. He was \ncruzified with those 2 criminals on his sides. And Isaiah 53 also \nprophecied that Jesus woul be placed in a rich mans grave and that did also \nhappen. So this is just some few examples on that the Bible proves its self \nto be the truth but if your mind is messed up, confused and full of \nunreasonable doubt you want believe the truth to be the truth but is into \ntotal confusion.\nI will never have any kids that will do any of those things you mentioned \nbecause I will seek God before I get together with my wife and she will \nseek Him together with me and we will agree on in prayer what kind of child \nwe want and not an idiot or a person that will go to hell because it is \nstupid or weak of mind or what ever. People have to humble themselves and \npray and seek Gods face and turn from their wicked ways then God will her \nfrom heaven, forgive their sins and heal their land. God will give them \nreal off spring and not a plague and disaster. ",

If religion is the opiate of the people, then atheism is \nthe laxative of the people; it provides nothing but SH*T !!!\ufeff",

            "text": "+Jazzy Fizzle Christians try bringing religion back into schools, politics \nand law. They want to replace evolution class with religion class, yet they \nwant taught only the stuff they believe in. Mormonism or Islam or any other \nreligion should not be taught, of course. Allah, Ra, Zeus, Kami-no-Kaze, \nShango and the thousands of gods that billions of people believe \nin...Christians are so full of themselves, they would kill in order to keep \nthose things out of schools.\n\nReligious people try shoving their wicked world view down the throats of \neveryone else while they demand respect from others.\nReligion does not deserve any respect at all. I always insult religious \npeople. Not because they disagree with me, but because of what they believe \nthey know about reality and, more importantly, what they are doing with \nthis knowledge. If religion was just that...a belief, I would have no \nproblem giving you people all the respect you want, in the same way I \nrespect someones dress-sense or the decor in their home. Even if I found it \ntasteless, I would respect them enough not to say so.\n\nBut religion is more than just belief. Religion wants to impose a universal \nmorality, which is why it has always attracted the kind of person who \nthinks that other peoples private lives are their business. And giving \nrespect to this mentality is exactly what got us into the mess we're in. \nWe've given religion ideas above it's station and we've persuaded it that \nit's something it is not. When the truth is, faith is nothing more than the \ndeliberate suspension of disbelief. It's an act of will! It's not a state \nof grace, it's a state of choice. Because without evidence, you've got no \nreason to believe, apart from your willingness to believe.\n\nSo, why is that worthy of respect any more than your willingness to poke \nyourself in the eye with a pencil? And why is faith considered some kind of \nvirtue? Is it because it implies some depth of contemplation and insight? I \ndon't think so. Faith, by definition, is unexamined...so, in that sense, it \nhas to be among the shallowest of experiences. And yet, if it could, it \nwould regulate every action, word and thought of every single person on \nthis planet. Because let's not forget, even an impure thought is a sin!\n\nWell, I think the belief in god is an impure thought. It pollutes our \nunderstanding of reality; it gets in the way! And it brings out the worst \nin the best of us. So that we're even prepared to stoop so low, as to \npoison the unformed minds of those we love the most - our children. By the \ntime they're old enough to think for themselves, it's too late. They've \nbeen well and truly hypnotized.\n\nI'm sorry, but there is no nice way to say this. If you fill your childs \nmind with images of Satan and the horrors of hellfire, you're a sick \nindividual and you are mentally ill. And the only reason you don't know \nthis, is because you've been indulged for far too long by people and \ninstitutions that really ought to know better. The truth is, your beliefs \nare infantile, your scriptures are lies and your gods are illusions. And I \ncan say that will all due respect, because no respect is actually due! And \nbesides, anyone who has to demand respect automatically deserves ridicule.\n\nIf god exists, I want him to tell me, not anyone else. And in case you're \nwondering, that includes you. So please, don't quote any more scripture at \npeople, stop evangelizing others and stop scaring little children. I really \ncan understand why people are drawn to scripture and religion. Because it's \nso easy. It's all laid out for you...all the thinking you ever need has \nalready been done - you don't have to lift a single brain cell. How very \nconvenient!\n\nYou Christians don't even have consensus with your fellow Christian friends \nabout what is right and wrong...they all have different interpretations of \nthe Bible. You try evangelizing non-believers by using scripture and \napparently call them 'close minded' if they don't want to hear any of this. \nNow, being called close minded by religious people is a bit like being \ncalled yellow by a bunch of bananas.\n\nI'm so close minded that I'm only prepared to engage with reality. I know \nit sounds unreasonable but when something isn't real, I find I got an \nin-built automatic prejudice. In fact, I'm so close minded when it comes to \nabsurdities that, you won't believe this, I actually require proof. That's \nright, copper-bottomed proof, that would stand up in a court of law. A real \ncourt of law, not some fancy human rights commission. And I think we all \nknow that your scripture is not gonna furnish that proof if you talk from \nnow until the end of times.\n\nYour deeply hold beliefs are just an accident of birth. The parents that \nyou happen to be born to and the stuff they happen to believe in, is now \ndoubtless the stuff that you believe in. Had you been born elsewhere, you'd \nbelieve other stuff, stuff that you would consider heretical and false. \nYet, in both cases yours would be the only true religion. How are you not \nembarrassed?\n\nClaiming that evolution and atheism are just other belief systems is like \nsaying that 'off' is a TV channel, or 'bald' is a hair color. Atheists do \nnot 'believe' in stuff anything other than maybe we believe that it will \nrain tomorrow. We know stuff. We know facts because they are proven to be \ntrue. Religion is not on par with science. It's not two sides of the same \ncoin. Your scripture does not go on the same shelf as my science. Your \nstuff goes over there, on the shelf with Thor, Krishna, the Kraken and Orcs.\n\nSo no, thank you, I don't wanna hear about your beliefs and I don't give a \ndamn what your scriptures have to say about anything. Sorry to be so close \nminded. I'm gonna spell it out for you as clear as I can, just to avoid any \nmisunderstandings: I don't care if you've got a written formula for \nconverting lead into gold. Keep it to yourself.\n\nEvangelizing people who don't want to hear it is such a tasteless thing to \ndo - it's like exposing yourself in public. Whatever happened to good \nmanners? It's not that we don't even know the pitch...God knows we've heard \nit thousands and thousands of times and it doesn't get any more convincing \nin the telling, but that doesn't seem to register with you guys. If \nsomebody tried to sell me a car and I decided I don't want one, I wouldn't \nexpect that person to returning the next day and try to sell it to me \nagain. Especially if it was an invisible car :)\nYou see, I'm not in the market for a car...any car. I decided to walk. \nThat's gonna take me where I'm going because I'm going where it takes me \nand I'll be happy to get there. In fact, I already am.\n\nI don't need to hear about anybodys god or saviour or prophet or scripture \nor any sort of supernatural hokuspokus voodoo mambo jambo or any fancy \nvariation on that theme...half man, half god-kind of arrangements...I'm not \ninterested. I've heard it all before and I think it's all lies; insulting, \ndegrading nonsense that contaminates everything it touches. In fact, \nwhenever I'm exposed to religion, I feel dirty. I feel contaminated by the \nvileness of the platitudes that are passed for wisdom. The naked \nmoneygrabbing, the controlling rhetoric devoid of any humanity or \ncompassion. Are you kidding me? The supercilious hectoring tone, the \nconstant intrusive demands for privilege and the absolutely unforgivable \nviolation of the minds of young children. I think the people who made a \nprofession of religion are the scum of the earth and if Jesus turned up \ntomorrow, he would agree with me. So...let's hope he does.\n\nAnd by the way, I think Jesus undoubedtly made it very clear that his \nfollowers should do as he did and walk the earth, do good and give all \npossessions to the poor. I would figure that only a tiny part of his \n\"followers\" are actually onto the quest.  Ask yourself, are you one of \nthese \"Christians\" who are browsing YouTube on their high-tech computers, \njudging other people, telling them how your god will punish them? You are \nnot a follower of Jesus. You are just a fan. Who'll end up in hell. So, see \nyou there!",
