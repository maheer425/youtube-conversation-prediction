The USSR wouldn't allow that, because while they are not \nbreaking the law, they are tricking people. \n\nI hate it when capitalists hate communism and fascism despite having NO \nidea what the difference is between these three systems. You fools.\n\nBottom line for you morons, don't believe everything you are taught, \nhistory is written by the victors, hence why capitalism is praised so much.\ufeff",

China have their own intersts.\nChina's support of North Korea is a very strategic move that also involves \nhistorical influences.\n\nHistorical:\nChina has been NK's ally for so long that it cannot just abruptly decide to \nstop supporting it. This is similar to how China still claims itself to be \na \"socialist country with Chinese twist\", even though the economy is \npractically capitalist.\n\nStrategic (the most important reasons)\nShield to Japan. North Korea has been publicly against Japan, and as recent \ndisputes involving oil-drilling and territory claims in the Pacific between \nChina and Japan arise, it is crucial to have a country between China and \nJapan so that Japan thinks wisely before it does something. Recent military \nreports indicate that Japan views North Korea as its primary military \nthreat, not China. This is because although China is a lot stronger, it is \nalso burdened by its international reputation, and that it has to at least \npretend to go by the international rules. For example, it cannot just \nrandomly declare war on Japan and shoot missiles. On the other hand, North \nKorea is so isolated internationally that even if it fires a few missiles \nin Japan's way, they will have a lot less consequence relatively.\nShield to the US. Although China has been supporting North Korea, it is \nvery unlikely China will publicly supply North Korea weapons should it go \nto war with South Korea. It may do it secretly, or do it publicly and \nblatantly deny it, but it cannot do it directly. As a result, almost all \nanalysts will agree that should the war start, South Korea, with the \nsupport of the US, is bound to win. If this were the case, the US military \nwill have access to all of the peninsula, and can drive its troops all the \nway to Chinese borders. This is perhaps the biggest reason why China \ndoesn't want Korea to unite.\nRefugees from NK. If the war occurs between North and South Korea, millions \nof North Korean refugees will flee across the border to north-eastern \nChina. This will cause great social disruption to China, and China \ndefinitely does not want it to happen.\n\n\nChina believes its best interest is served by keeping North and South Korea \nunstable enough that they cannot cooperate fully, but stable enough so that \na war doesn't happen. If North and South Korea seems to be on the way to \nunite peacefully, China will definitely do everything it can to stop it \nfrom happening. Contrarily, if North and South Korea seem to be on the way \nto war, China will also try to prevent that. Keeping the unstable yet \nstable status quo yields the greatest benefits for China.\ufeff",

When we sent them trucks of \nfood supplies, they just used it on the military and on building missiles. \nWhen we cut them off and warned them, they threatened to start a war and \nsent off missiles everywhere. Fact is, nothing can change as long as the \ndictatorship remains. There has to be something, a political dispute, a \ndisagreement, a chance for the young generations to speak out. This \ngeneration or the next might just be the one to do it - they have a lot \nmore access to Western and South Korean media and are a lot more aware of \nthings outside of NK and Kim Jong-Un is actually kind of frowned upon at \ntimes for his reckless actions...\ufeff",

South Korea- as a country is no longer on any \nlist as \" 3rd World \", but now has a thriving economy and is getting \nexpensive too.  Unfortunately, for the N. Korean folks, this is not the \ncase; one party, selfish, uncaring and deliberate, in control of the fate \nof an entire country and watching their own people starve to death.   The \nN. Korean people are taught from birth that we, American people are the \ndevil and should be killed on the spot- Some day soon, we need to end all \nof this, open the DMZ- which I have visited on many occasion myself.  Even \nfor this hardened soldier, being on the DMZ can put the fear of God in your \nheart- when I looked across into N. Korea from the South, I could actually \nfeel the devil at play!  For those of you who have not visited the DMZ., I \nwould strongly recommend a visit!  I'm sure when you leave the DMZ you will \nfeel as I did- a new feeling of freedom and being a very proud American. \n We need to set those people free- as we did in Germany.  S. Korean's fear \nreunification- there will be an uncontrollable flow of N. Korean's seeking \nrefuge in the South- economical issues will exist for sure, but it can be \naccomplish and I hope it happens during my lifetime- My dear wife of 34 \nyears if from S.

The fluoride in toothpaste is also a compound, as it the \nfluoride in the water (outlawed in most every single country in the world \nexcept for the USA, Australia, and parts of Canada).  \n\nYour insinuation that I would believe everything I read or heard on the \ninternet is silly and insulting.  It also exudes your own thought process \nin how you approach the world.  If you cannot think on your own, you \nshouldn't be insulting others that do.  It's not about 'belief'...it's \nabout facts.  Whether I 'believe' that 2+2=4 or not is irrelevant.  As \nwhether or not I 'believe' the fact, the fact is true.  Belief does come \ninto play for those that cannot think for themselves.  For those poor \nbuffoons, 2+2=5 because someone told them it was true.  And they have no \nchoice but to 'believe' what they've been told...because they cannot think \nfor themselves or reason it out.  Understand the difference?\n\nIn regards to cyano groups, I cannot know what their effect is in the human \nbody, nor could anyone else until experiments have been conducted to study \nit.  But certainly, statistical analysis can shed some light on the issue, \ntake for example, the increase in vaccination schedules and the lockstep \nincrease in cases of autism.  I will not take a supplement which contains a \n'cyano' group.  The one good example of this is cheap vitamin B12, which \ncontains cyano-cobalamin.  The stuff has been proven to break down in the \nbody into its constituent parts, i.e...cyanide and the rest of it.  The \ncyanide corrodes the brain cells.  But this is not as dangerous as fluoride \nhas been proven to be since the 1930s.  \n\nFluoride has been put in our water supply for a reason for sure...but it \nhas nothing to do with the reasons claimed.  It is a chemical pacifier. \n And fluoridated water has been shown conclusively to soften bones, cause \ncancer, kill brain cells, damage heart muscles, and cause rapid tooth \ndecay.  The American Dental Association makes big cash off of the fluoride \nindustry.  The tooth decay has been proven in research conducted in Canada \nbetween the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, where one province gave \ninto the lobbying pressure of the fluoride industry and began fluoridating \nits water.  At the moment of its inception, the tooth decay \n'hockey-sticked' upward.  \n\nWake up, you have been deceived.  ",

            "text": "+John McClure The organic constitution was lost to us well before most of \nour great grandparents parents time.  Replaced by a corporate constitution \nby the bankers in 1871 (to satisfy these rapacious financial criminals for \ndefaulting on the debt of the war of 1812).  The important distinction \nbetween that organic constitution and the corporate constitution was that \nthe wording was slightly changed, and some omissions (to allow lawyers to \nhold public office).  The critical change was this...\"The constitution for \nthese united states\"...changed to \"The constitution of the united states\". \n Before this, it was well understood that each state was an independent \ncountry unto itself.  And the common law ruled the People.  Since then, \nthis 'common law' has been largely abrogated in favor of maritime law (also \nknown as contract, Roman, public, and statutory law).  Before we lost this \nlaw, based on over 800 years of case history, the claimant ruled the \ncourts...the judge (magistrate) was just a powerless administrator.  Our \nZionist controlled media has spent billions over decades insuring that the \nsheople of America never find out what we lost.  Though, it may be argued, \nthat we still have the common law available to us.  The problem is that \nmost courts refuse to hear cases based in this jurisdiction, because \nmaritime law is a never-ending cash cow for the state.  The rights of the \nindividual are superseded in favor of this (many) hundred billion dollar \nindustry.  And this is one of political Zionisms linchpins of control over \nthe once proud and well informed People of the republic.  If you can't get \nyour fair day in court under well established law...you aren't free.  You \nare a subject.  \n\nThe water you drink is poisoned with fluoride.  The food you eat is \npoisonous and loaded with preservatives, chemicals, and other cancer \ncausing additives, the money you use it debt based, the taxes you pay does \nnothing but impoverish you and stress you and eat your life substance out \nat the core (and they follow you around as an American 'citizen'), the \nhealthcare industry is the worst blight upon any people in any age, your \ngovernment lies to you on a daily basis and is bought and paid for by \npolitical Zionism, the media you watch is owned by political Zionism and if \nit's to their advantage, they'll let you see some propaganda...but \nvirtually everything else is just a fat disgusting lie.  \n\n1868 - 14th amendment passed to enslave the People as a new class known as \n'citizens'.  \n1871 - The original united states defaulted on the 1812 war debt and the \norganic constitution was changed into a corporate constitution with \ncritical freedoms removed, while the D.C. entity was bankrupted and \noverhauled to form a 'banker's corporate charter, making the citizens the \nshareholders and assigning them the debt.  \n1913 - 16th amendment passed (but never ratified) during a late night \nholiday session.  \nThe Federal Reserve Act, passed later in the same year under similar \ncircumstances.  This is the most calamitous act ever passed against the \nPeople of these united states, giving control of our currency (and our \ncountry) to foreign Zionist bankers.  \n1919 - League of Nations and Women's suffrage passed (to double \nRockefeller's revenue collected)\n1924 - The Maternity Act passed to convert every man, woman, and child born \never thereafter into Rothschildian securities, i.e...cattle.  \n1929 - Wallstreet lays an egg under the easy money of the federal reserve. \n1933 - Depression, FDR communism, banker bailouts.  1st Statutory law \nenacted.  \n1937 - Complete abrogation of common law.  \n1939 - WWII...Another banker's war, launched against Hitler's Germany \nbecause he was printing is own currency.  Millions killed worldwide for \nZionist banker profits...controlling, raw materials, politicians on both \nsides, munitions production, public opinion, and most importantly...CASH.  \n1948 - Israel carved out of Palestine as Rothschild's backyard.  Though, \nHitler had already sent hundreds of thousands to Palestine and set Israel \nup for the Jews in 1933 to get them out of Germany.  This done to \nfacilitate the printing of his own German currency.  \n1954 - UCC codified, to take advantage of the abrogation of common law.  \n1955 - First US city Fluoridates water supplies.  Hitler and Stalin were \nlong noted to have fluoridated water in concentration camps and Ghulags to \npacify the prisoners.  The Nazi's claimed it was their number one method of \ncontrolling the camp inmates.  \nPolio vaccines launched countrywide.  Thousands killed outright, thousands \nmore paralyzed.  Dangerous Green Monkey cancer causing virus' intentionally \nlaced into vaccines.\n \nSomewhere along the way, agency government was enacted (mostly during FDR's \nearly calamitous ventures into socialism).  The CIA, FBI, DOE, DOD, DHS, \nATF, BLM, IRS, EPA...on and on it went and on and on it goes.   The \ndepartment of education ensures the minds of American children are \nthoroughly sanitized and brainwashed into the state's idiotocracy, as \npermitted by the Zionist master puppeteers.  The TV does the rest.  \n\nEverything we've been sold is a lie...spoon-fed to us by criminal agents of \na foreign banker elite.  And America is nothing more than an Israeli \ncolony...in all but name alone.  \n\nWake up, you have been deceived.  ",
