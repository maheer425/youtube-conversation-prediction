In the 911 Turbo \nthe limits are high, but if you crosses the point of physics you have lost. \nThe GT3 warns you that he is becoming unstable by shivering, but the 4WD \ncan break out immediately without a warning, if you are over the physical \ncapabilities.\nSo race driver or driver who go to the physical limits prefer this \ncommunication with the car, wich the GT3 delivers.

I noticed that first with mobile phones (using a \nmobile phone in public was frowned upon, nobody saw the need for it and \nlook at us now...). I believe the reason PDK-like gear boxes are so \ncontroversial is that we are used to using our right (or in the \nUK/Japan/etc left hand) to shift gears. It feels different and hence weird.\n\nBut what if it is factually better? I mean: nowadays automatic gear boxes \nactually improve on fuel consumption and they can shift faster than any \nhuman being could. We don't double clutch anymore, we left air-cooled \nengines behind, engines are run by computers now, and so on, and so on...\ufeff",
