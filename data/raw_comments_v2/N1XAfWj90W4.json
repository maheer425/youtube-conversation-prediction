If \nthe train is in a tunnel, the driver then must walk through the \npossibly-crowded train to reach the alarm to reset it before being able to \ncontinue. On newer trains this is not a problem since the drivers are able \nto override the brake application after talking to the passenger - but it's \na much less clear message for adverts to explain the differences between \nstock to people than it is just to say to always wait for the station ;).\n\nEDIT: Actually, I might be wrong about this - my memory might be playing \ntricks on me. Hmm.\ufeff",

So how is this better? I \ncan't see a reason for not pulling the alarm in-between stations when \nsomeone's health is at stake. Serious question, would love a reply. \n thanks.\ufeff",
