My budget is \n$2/day, I'm getting about 100 or more likes per day. I'll have to closely \nmonitor engagement. If Facebook is actually using link farms, how long can \nthey get away with this. Another thought I had was, I've never \"Liked\" \nanything on face book that I didn't engage with first or at the very least \nknow what the page was about. For instance, I \"Like\"  a musicians page \nbecause I do Like her music. My Point is HOW can you sell \"Likes\" using a \nsmall picture of the page in an add?. The assumption then is that the 100 \nor more \"Likes\" I'm getting must have looked at my page. I'm guessing this \nisn't the reality.\ufeff",
