So being aware of that is always important. However don't let a \nbad experience ruin your studies. For every few people who look down on it. \nMany others appreciate your efforts. Communication or there lack of can \ncause you a lot of headaches. Which can shape your opinions you may have of \nthat country. \n\nFrom my experience in dealing with Japanese for example. They have very \nsimilar feelings about foreigners speaking their language. However they \nbecome even more annoyed. When you try to speak native English. As most \nwill just run away or avoid you all together. Not really helping your \nsituation any is it. I find that most comes from their own inability to \ncommunicate. \n\nIn a way which allows them to save face. Without embarrassing either party. \nHowever i found that once Japanese knew i wasn't a threat. That we were \nbetter off communicating in Japanese. They opened up a bit more knowing \nthey could talk freely. It is always good to know your place though. As to \nwhen and when is not the best time to speak. In my case i leaned out of \nnecessity.\n\nHowever i am happy i have that experience under my belt. As it has opened \nup a lot of doors for me which i didn't have otherwise. So never be afraid \nof how people may react to you. Korea i would imagine is similar in some \nrespects. As they are just not used to seeing many foreigners speaking \nKorean. They may be somewhat specious of your intentions. \nIt's just strange to them. As they might not see why we would bother. \n\nPushing oneself beyond one's limitations or abilities. Might seem a waste \nof time to some. However for others it's a road less traveled. But one \nwhich gives meaning and purpose in their lives. Personally the benefits far \noutweigh the negatives. Even if some Japanese, Koreans, Chinese or whoever \nelse have a problem with it. Stay true to yourself. :)\ufeff",

I \nmean, when you go to a foreign country, do you want yourself to be expected \nto speak the local language well by local people or you want to receive \ntons of compliments even if you don't speak well. I will take the latter \none. Moreover, it is not like one person keeps giving you compliments \nwhenever you open your mouth. Probably, you get compliments from many other \npeople.\nAnother problem is that these guys used just one example to show that they \ncan not get into a deep conversation in Korean because of excessive praise \nof Koreans. First of all, I want to ask them whether they speak Korean good \nenough to have a deep conversation. I have seen many people who speak both \nlanguages perfectly engage in conversation with Koreans without feeling \nfrustrated because of overpraise. Their sample size is simply too small to \njustify their claim.\nFinally, do not forget that Korea has been a very homogenous society for a \nlong time and their culture was unknown to westerners until recent years. \nSo from the eyes of Korean people, it was a rare occasion to see foreigners \nspeak Korean whether they speak fluently or not. Actually, it is not a \nmatter of Korean people. If you go to Japan and they know that you are \nGaijin, they will pour you with compliments whenever you speak Japanese.   \n \ufeff",
