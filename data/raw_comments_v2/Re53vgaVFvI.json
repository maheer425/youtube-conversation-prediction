It's not the industry who's racist it's us. A \nlot more chinese models are popping up due to larger consumer demands in \nChina. As a model you are a self employed as business woman and only the \nsmart survive a highly competitive industry.

Look at the beginning of \nthe video when she hasn't changed, pause it, and examine her. What \nimpression do her and her outfit give you? What kind of person do you think \nshe is? If you guys went to school together, would she hang out with you? \nAsk yourself these kind of questions, all based on her outfit, and what her \noutfit makes you think of her. Now fast forward it and pause it again. Try \nto look at her as if she were another person and ask yourself the same \nquestions. Now, did her change of image make you change your perspective of \nher? If it did, then then her main point was accomplished, she showed you \nhow an image is both powerful (because it made you think a certain way of \nher) and superficial (because it was extremely easy to alter). \nThat's what you can put as symbolism. The powerful impact of an image and \nits superficial identity. \nHope it helps! ",
