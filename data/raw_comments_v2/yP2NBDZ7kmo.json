I started to think what went wrong, \nand then i realized that when i make golden syrup, i bring the sugar to \n125\u00b0C, and it's still pourable. So i guess you should correct the \ntemperature in your written recipe and in your video. I hate to waste food, \nso i'm trying to figure out how to fix it. By the way, generally your \nrecipes are really good with useful details, i guess this one wasn't meant \nto be. :-(\ufeff",
