So the more \nchildren a queen had, the greater the risk to her life. (A king never had \nto fear death by childbirth--if his wife died, he could simply replace her \nwith another and carry on.) But radfems will tell you that it was because \nmen were meanieheads who didn't want icky girlz in their Clubhouse of \nPatriarchy. Or something like that....

Not really anything to do with the Tudors.It was all \nabout the fights within the House of Stuart. The ruling came in because \nJames VII of Scotland and II of England converted to Catholicism then had a \nbaby, James Stuart, the future Old Pretender. The baby had two older \nProtestant sisters, Mary and Anne, but because he was male he was heir to \nthe throne so both Scotland and England looked like having a Catholic royal \ndynasty restored. Mary and her husband (William of Orange) were invited by \nsome in England to restore the Protestant throne so William invaded England \nand James fled. Once he lost his English power base the Scottish parliament \nbranded James a traitor and offered the Scottish throne to William and Mary \ntoo. They later died without heirs so the younger sister Anne Stuart took \nthe throne but she had no heir either so the most obvious next monarch was \nher nephew the exiled James Stuart the Old Pretender. The Scottish \nparliament had passed a law saying that the Scottish monarch needed to be \nboth of the Scottish Royal Line and Protestant which paved a way for James \nto return were he to convert from Catholicism. The English Parliament \nlooked to exclude James altogether so they passed the law which not only \nexcluded Catholics but specifically stated that the future English monarch \nwould be Sophie of Hanover and her descendents. Sophie was the daughter of \nPrincess Elizabeth of Scotland the elder sister of Charles I. While Anne \nwas still alive the union between Scotland and England happened and the \nHanovarian Succession was one of the articles of the said union treaty \nwhich created the new united kingdom called Great Britain. In fact that is \none of the major reasons union came about. The English parliament wanted to \nensure Scotland chose the same monarch as England. Sophie was already dead \nprior to Anne dying herself so Sophie's son George I became monarch on \nAnne's death.",
