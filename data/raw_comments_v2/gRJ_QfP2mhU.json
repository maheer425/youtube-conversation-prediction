            "text": "This is so disappointing and offensive. If our society can now accept \nhomosexual desires as something that can be innate (I say can because I \nhave seen multiple cases where people claim they changed their sexual \npreference, similar to how this guy is claiming that watching porn can \nchange what you want from sex, which is true to an extent) why are we still \nshaming those who are members of the kink community? This entire video \npresumes that only men would be interested in the genres of porn such as \nrape, public shame, double penetration and so on, which is just wrong. I \nand many other women that I know watch this genre of porn because those are \nthe fantasies that we've always had. Although it may seem like the woman is \nbeing taken advantage of, these scenes involve consent and respect out the \nwazoo. When done in real life, the two consenting adults will agree on all \nthe things they are willing to do and come up with a safe word so that if \nany point they are uncomfortable they can say it and immediately their \npartner will stop and make sure everything is ok. Even after these scenes \nthey participate in \"aftercare\" where they double check that everyone is \ncompletely comfortable and satisfied with what happened, what could be \nimproved, etc. For the most part it is the same with porn. It is true that \nsome women are taken advantage of by the porn industry but they're the rare \ncases, unlike what this video suggests. And its just a terrible lack of \nresearch to claim that this is the only kind of porn people can watch. \nThere is a genre of porn for every single fantasy people have, trust me if \nyou search for it you will find it. And plenty of porn is romantic for \nthose that only want to watch that sort of thing, and it certainly isn't \nonly women. This is another qualm I have with this video, the assumption \nthat only men will want \"abusive\" sex and only women want loving, \ncompassionate sex. It's this kind of ideology that perpetuates the \nincorrect idea that women don't enjoy or want sex the same way men do which \nis WRONG and is really harmful to women. This stereotype leads to slut \nshaming since the women who have lots of sex are viewed as abnormal even \nthough that behavior is applauded in men. Our society needs to wake up and \nrealize that the gender binary system we have is outdated and needs to be \nchanged. There is no quality, beyond our physical differences, that is \npurely found in only one gender and this obsession with gender roles is \nharmful to both men and women. There are also benefits to porn, as someone \nearlier in the comment section mentioned. It actually has been at the very \nleast correlated with a low rate in sexual crimes. Not to mention it helps \nmany couples with their sex lives, whether it be because they find new \nthings that they would like to try or they're having trouble with dryness \nor getting it up, which can be caused so easily by things like changes in \nmedication or just aging. The bottom line is that while it's true that some \nwomen are taken advantage of by the porn industry, they are the minority, \nand even though some people get addicted to porn it is not a legitimate \nargument to get rid of it (which would never happen anyway) since you can \nget addicted to any number of things.\ufeff",

Let's face it....if you're a woman, how many times have you had a \nguy ask you if you wanted to \"try\" anal (clearly not thinking once that it \ncould be his anus getting fucked) or how many wished they could finish in \nyour face or mouth?
