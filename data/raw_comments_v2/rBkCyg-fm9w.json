He was the most \nsuccessfull trainer in the history of the sport and said adonis was one of \nthe best natural fighter he ever saw. Many would say he was old, out of his \nmind and praised many other fighters at the time. Emanuel hosted stevenson \nin his house when he was in Detroit so i'm pretty sure he believed a lot in \nhim. He is massively underrated it's not fair the guy as a 1 punch knockout \nlike none , incredible reach of 77\" for a 5'11 fighter is very unusual. His \ndefense is pretty underrated and he is very ellusive. His straight punchs \nare no match to any fighter in my eyes because of that reach and power. He \ndosen't have a hook like Kovalev or a Prime Roy jones but He is fast \naccurate and strong . Way more agile than you may think. 1 left cross like \nhe did to gonzales and it's over for any fighter. Kovalev might probably be \nthe best and I respect him a lot as a boxer and a man. He is doing what \nevery boxer should do fighting any fighter at any given time in any given \nplace, you have to respect that.\n \ufeff",
