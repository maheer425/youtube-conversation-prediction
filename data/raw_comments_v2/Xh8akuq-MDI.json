However, after his men cannot face the \ndragon, Beowullf decides that only he can kill the beast, leading to his \ndeath. It is Beowulf's denial of his own age that is representative of his \npride. As for the fact that he ruled the Geats for fifty years, Hrothgar \nhad a similar reign of prosperity. However, Hrothgar knows better than most \nthat in the end, one must accept the ravaging of time, and not let pride \novershadow wisdom: \"O flower of warriors, beware of that trap.\nChoose, dear Beowulf, the better part,\neternal rewards. Do not give way to pride.\nFor a brief while your strength is in bloom\nbut it fades quickly; and soon there will follow \nillness or the sword to lay you low,\nor a sudden fire or surge of water\nor jabbing blade or javelin from the air\nor repellent age.

I don't \nthink it invalidates it, but I think we have to look at the bigger \nhistorical picture to fully understand. Yes, it is based on an original \nScandinavian tale that was then sung by scops (bards) for a a long, long \ntime until a monk wrote it down sometime around the 700's. We really can't \nsay with certainty what the bards actually sang, because when the monk \nwrote it down, he added, embellished, and changed things. For example, we \nknow that the Norse gods would have been important to Beowulf's people (the \nGeats), but \"Beowulf\" has a serious amount of Christian allusions. Where \ndid that come from? The \"author\" aka the monk who wrote it down. Thus, he \ntook the bones of a Scandinavian story and altered it to fit his own \nculture. We know from other historical pieces what the Anglo-Saxons valued, \nand with that background, we can see things that were probably added or \naltered to appeal to the audience of that time and place, i.e. the \narrogance of the hero. \nThanks for the conversation!
