The \nshows most standout feature is Ellie Kemper she is such a loveable \ncharacter as Kimmy Schmidt and anytime her and Tituss Burgess share a scene \nits always the highlight of the episode. Really just felled like a \nunsatisfying ending wrapping up the introduction to the series rather than \nshow any sort of character development for Kimmy who's status didn't change \nsince episode 1 , same job , no boyfriend (wtf happened to that tutor she \nkissed & broke up with then he vanished like smoke for the rest of the \nseason) and still trying to build her life. best I could give it was 3/5 \nyou'll get hooked into binge watching it and falling in love with the \ncharacters but it really is sitcom writing where everything is established \nin episode 1 and all problems get solved by the next episode with little no \ncarry on story arch.\ufeff",
