I happen to find \nloneliness a place of focus and centeredness, I do not regard it as \nsomething terrible and harrowing as most people seem to make of it. I find \nit to be a stance of oneness with yourself, almost like a passive \nmeditation going on constantly. Humans are social animals, and they develop \nsocial hierarchies like many other mammals in the animal kingdom. It's just \none example that humans cannot escape their intrinsic nature, so don't \nblame yourself or anybody for segregation. It's just one of the things \nhumans are good at doing, and as we all know it causes quite the chaos. \nSince humans are social animals, they need social interaction, because as \nmany of you might relate, loneliness can leave you hanging on the edge of \ninsanity. Many times I question my sanity, but I think we are all insane, \nand this isn't just a clich\u00e9 or something that has been instilled in me by \nany one, when I look at humans speak, express themselves, eat, breathe, \nmove, sleep, I find it totally and completely strange, I feel dissociated \nor desynchronized to what is happening before me, therefore I have a hard \ntime understanding humans and everything around me, so I find it hard to \nkeep relationships with people. Don't worry though, most people will offer \nnothing but headaches and fruitless gatherings, you don't need people, just \nlearn how to drift by them, learn how to co-exist with them, but don't be \ndependent on them. Learn how to live with loneliness, many of the world's \ngreatest vanguards have been isolated people, almost anti-social even \nmisanthropists. Don't spend so much energy complaining about loneliness, I \nthink loneliness is a magnificent learning experience. Remember, having a \nlot of people around you doesn't necessarily mean you have company.",

When they started \nletting us work from home at my old job, I noticed that if I worked from \nhome for two days straight & I didn't really do anything socially, I \nstarted to get lonely.  It was really weird because when I worked at work & \ncame home, I didn't have this phenomenon even if I didn't bother to go out \nthat night.  Just having people around you at work seemed to cure \nloneliness.\n\nSo anyhow, what I started doing to fix this situation is that I'd go out \neach evening to restaurants or bars or both. ALONE.  It was very seldom I \ncould get any old friends or work buddies to show up anywhere.  So I just \nsaid fuck it.  I'm going to learn how to socialize on my own.  It was very \nweird at first doing the \"Table for One\" all the time, but after a few \nmonths, it didn't bother me at all.  I even looked forward to it.  I would \nend up making a few friends here or there, a few guys & a few women.  And \nwhen new faces show up that I see, they usually want to reach out & talk \nsometimes.\n\nNow that I'm out of work I feel very isolated.  Again, I'm already using \nwhat I've learned to go out & run around & socialize where I can.  Even if \nnobody talks to me, just having people around seems to help.  It used to \nannoy me if I left a scene not having talked to anyone, but over time, you \njust realize that sometimes other people don't talk.\n\nThe other thing that I wonder about is that I've heard old people have \nfewer & fewer friends & have huge periods of loneliness & yet they're not \ndead or have lived very long.  I'm guessing that the true loners are those \nhermit type folk who don't want to be around anyone.  However, I don't \nthink they realize it, much less care to change it.\ufeff",

Find out what other sorts of similar events are in the area, and \ngo to those as well. Over time, you'll start to see the same people, and \nyou can start to initiate friendships.\n\nVolunteer work is also a good place to meet new people.\n\nYou can often meet interesting people in community college - see if you can \naudit courses. (I'm assuming you've finished college already.) This can go \nhand-in-hand with 'getting a hobby'; try taking a music, painting, or \nphotography course.\n\nOnce you have a few people you can call friends, start initiating group \nactivities. Invite a group of friends over to play video games, or invite \npeople to go bowling, have a birthday party, etc. (If you're an artist, \ninitiate group sketching sessions; a photographer, initiate photography \ntrips; for a musician, initiate a jam session.)\n\nBasically, try to create the kind of social environment you want to have, \nso that you can form a growing community of friendships. That way, you'll \nnot only help yourself get over loneliness, but help others as well.\n\nThis podcast is for artists, but I think it contains some relevant info: \nhttp://chrisoatley.com/critique-groups/\n\nAlso, don't mix up romantic relationships and friendships; too many people \nseem to be looking to 'get laid' instead of looking for lasting, lifetime \nfriendships. Real, deep friendships take time to develop. If you try to \nrush things (sharing too much too early), you're very likely to kill the \nrelationship. Just create a pleasant social environment, and let things \ndevelop on their own.\n\nOne more thing: try to balance your emotional state with healthy diet and \nexercise instead of socializing. People can enhance your life, but you kind \nof need to be a positive person first if you want to attract good people.\n\nGood luck!",

In our culture we see lonely people as \nweak/pathetic...\n\nAlso if we are socially oriented creatures, and if evolution is 100% \nresponsible for our neurobiology then why hasn't evolution eradicated \nanti-social emotions like pride?\n\nThe simple answer is evolution isn't 100% responsible for our neurobiology, \nit's around 70%. I would argue it's unclear how social emotions work.\n Depression is anti-social, and lonliness is more pro-social, but can often \nbe anti social too.\n\nevolutionary psychology seems sketchy to me. I also think you can be \ncompletely lonely and healthy. It depends whether you feel lonliness or \nnot. Some people don't feel lonliness when they are alone. What is their \nmortality like?\ufeff",

Otherwise, you're likely to attract other 'lost' \npeople simply become more lost in the social world.\n\nStep 3: Study the way you interface with the world. At night, before going \nto bed, think through and write down everything you did that day, and how \nyou felt about things. (Note: this can take hours every day; I think it's \nworth it.) Over time, you'll start to see patterns in the way you think, \nfeel, and act. Then, you can start making decisions about who you want to \nbecome, and intentionally form habits to become that person.\n\nStep 4: Start living the life you want to live, and invite others along on \nyour journey.

I believe, much of the problem, lies in that, what we are as \nmodernized mankind, trying to find fulfillment in, has very little to do \nwith our own natural and traditional makeup, as human beings. We think that \nif we can manage to leap \"to the moon\" and somehow \"attain it\" then we have \nfound ultimate fulfillment. When, in reality, we are going after a \nfruitless endeavor, just because we saw somebody else, heard somebody else \nor where told by somebody else, that we need to go after that, particular \nthing, in order to be satisfied. This is really the problem with the whole \nindividual identity topic, within modern society. We have to tear down so \nmany misconceptions, stubborn ways of thinking, of doing things and false \nascertainment biases, before we can even begin to see what our true desire \nfor fulfillment, really is.\n\nThis advice is not easily given, was not easily arrived at and took \ncountless false endeavors of seeking after self fulfillment, to discover. \nSometimes only, in disappointment, can we find true revelation of purpose \nand direction. I have found, many times, that the things I thought I \nwanted, in life, later on turned out to look like disasters, I'm relieved, \nto have never succeeded in acquiring. \"The grass is always greener, on the \nother side\" mentality, has to get shattered, before you can really get a \ntrue grasp of real purpose. People in our lives always have advice for us, \nanyone with relatives and family, knows this well. And not all of it is \ngood advice. I've learned to take criticism and over bearing emotional \npressure, from family, with a grain of salt. And separate the helpful, from \nthe hindersome. And not just dismiss, all critical advice, as \"jealousy\" or \n\"mean spiritedness\". Which we usually tend to do, all too often. I know I \ndid.\n\nThis has been my experience, in life.

We live in a \nculture that is violent, decisive, exclusive, predatory, competitive, \nvindictive, warmongering, class alienating, obsessed with only engaging \nwith the \"beautiful\" and \"smart and rich\" people and we wonder why we are \nfeeling lonely?  REALLY?  Why should this be a shock?  Of course people are \nfeeling lonely when the qualities of most (not all) people are one step \nabove being a total prick and yet WE are the ones constantly being told by \nfriends, family, the media, some crackpot dating site or online boards that \nWE have the problem.  We're the ones left wondering if we're the ones with \nthe problem when given the choices, we'd rather stay home and work on the \ncomputer than to put on a happy face and go out into the social jungle. \n Quite frankly, who wants to socialize with a bunch of psychotic \nself-absorbed social sharks??  Even networking events have turned into a \nsort of \"what can you give me\" game. \n\nFurthermore (not to sound paranoid), you either have people who are out to \ntake advantage of you in any way possible or have people who are so \nself-absorbed in their own suffering and \"misery\" that they are what I call \n\"emotional vampires\" who could suck the energy out of a super nova in one \nbreath!  Their only concern is how YOU can make THEM feel better.  Every \nexchange is one-sided about how bad they have it, how horrible their lot in \nlife is and yet 5, 10, 15, 20 years go by and they haven't done a damned \nthing but expect you to give, not lend, your support and compassion not to \nmention your energy.
