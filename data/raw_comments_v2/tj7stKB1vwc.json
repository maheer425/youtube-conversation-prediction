Grass fed saturated fat actually gives the body \nimportant nutritious elements like Omega-3 Fatty Acids and, like you \nmentioned, Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT). These fats are important for \nmetabolic processes, your body's natural anti-inflammatory and anti-stress \nsystems as well as the reduction of bad cholesterol (LDL) by increasing the \namount of good cholesterol in your body (HDL).\n\nNote: I'm not saying you should go ahead and drink this \"buttered coffee\" \nanyway, but merely pointing out the fact that there is such a thing as good \nfats out there.You should always consult your doctor or physician before \nyou make drastic diet changes.\ufeff",

Well I'm Cuban and a popular practice in our \nculture is to put a pinch of salt in the coffee; NO WAIT, hear me out. It \nmay sound weird but anyone with a culinary background will tell you a small \namount of salt with a relatively large amount of sugar will render a \nslightly buttery rich sweet flavor akin to butterscotch. It's delicious. \nDon't take my word for it Google any recipe for cookies or cake. They all \nhave salt as an ingredient for the very same reason. Salt makes sugar taste \nbetter. Seriously though just a pinch. No one likes salty coffee.\ufeff",

The studies that show they are bad for you are \nOUTDATED and HAVE SINCE BEEN PROVEN FALSE! TRANS FATS and POLYUNSATURATED \nFATS are the bad fats! Also, the concept of calories is FALSE! Fat doesn't \ncause blood sugar spikes and therefore insulin resistance and weight gain, \nSUGAR does! Fat is used as a building block - fat helps joints move, helps \nabsorb vitamins, helps the brain develop, and only THEN is fat used for \nenergy. Protein is used almost exclusively for building the body - very, \nvery little is converted into glycogen and used for energy. SUGAR is NOT \nused as a building block - it is only used as fuel. With this being said, \nthe idea that all calories can be measured equally regardless from the \nsource is absolutely LUDICROUS. So is the idea that somehow arteries work \nlike pipes and certain types of fat can just cling onto them. And as far as \ncholesterol... SAME story - it's an essential building block. The body \nactually manufactures most of it's cholesterol. If you eat \"too much\", \nguess what happens - the body makes less. It's that simple. And if you \ndon't eat enough... the body overcompensates and makes way too much. Guys, \nstop believing in bullshit. Seriously. Just because the government tells \nyou something is true... doesn't mean it's true. And if any of you are \ngoing to reply and say \"wut lol staurated fats n colesterall is bad fer u \nman, wer did u git ur sorces from?\", guess what? I don't give a shit. I'm \ntired of bullshit, and that's all I have to say.\ufeff",
