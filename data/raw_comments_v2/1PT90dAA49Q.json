If you don't agree, then you don't agree. \nThere is not much I can do. The discussion would turn into me shouting IS \nSO! and you shouting IS NOT!\n\nWhat was new to the discussion was that you started applying a debating \ntechnique that, in my eyes, was unfair and kind of childish.\n\nAnd for the record, You never went ad hominem. Ad hominem would have been: \n\"You are a jackass with a dumb name and an ugly face and your parents \nprobably divorced\". You never did that even though it seems to be common \npractice on YouTube.\n\nBut anyways, I also wish you a nice life.",

As if all the \nthings you clearly insinuate are not insinuated...\n\nIt's like saying \"Cows are supreme to sheep, they give milk, tasty steaks \nand they make nicer sounds\" And then when somebody says: \"You think cows \nare better\". you say: I never said that! Dude, then why start the \nconversation?\n\nClearly, you started this entire argument, because you thought it holds \nwater to claim that Britain could be considered separate of Europe and that \nit could be considered just as big as the rest of the planets continents.\n\nBecause if you go back to the original comment, you will see that I merely \npointed out a scale inconsistency.\n\nAnd you definately said: \"It's Britain and the rest of Europe\"... Look at \nyour first comment.. So now you are even playing dumb about that, even \nthough the words are literally right there in the top comment.\n\nThis is your way of debating. You are like a chameleon. If you get called \non something you said, you blatantly claim that you didnt... In a real \nconversation, nobody could proof that you said it... So im geussing you get \naway with it a lot in real life debates. But it's sanctimonious.\n\nSaying things like: \"I never said that...\" and \"That's your interpertation \nof my words\". And also turning the argument around. As in this argument, \ni'm telling you that you are disrespecting the cultures, and then you turn \nMY argument towards ME... As if I am being the one that is disrespecting... \nSanctimonious.\n\nThat is a horrible way of debating man. And I expected more from you. And \nthis is a never ending debate, because you can keep applying this technique \nuntill the end of times. \"That's not what I said!!!\" and reply to my every \ncomment with a \"No YOU!\" kind of reply. We can keep doing this for ever and \never and ever...\n\nBut the fact remains as simple as this. Great Britain is part of Europe... ",

It's almost like the Young-earther phenomenon in \nAmerica.Thousands of people with full access to the internet and free \neducation and yet have such little understanding of the workings of the \nworld,not one inkling of basic grade school history.\n\nReally,if you can't figure out how English got to be the language of the \nworld that's disturbing. You've never heard of the British Empire? It's \nsimple,in the end,vote or no vote,Anglo culture spread faster and more \naggressively than the others. It's *realpolitik*\n\nThat \"vote\" had no meaning. It had no political power in the end. The \nstruggle between English and German as official languages was resolved \nmerely by numbers.English-speakers outnumbered the others.It was as simple \nas that.\n\nAnd even if that mattered,you'd still have to explain Canada and Australia.\n\n\n\"German is more difficult.\"\nThat's arguable. You may be right but like I suggested before,English comes \nnaturally to you. You'll never know what it's like to learn the \nhomophones,pronunciation (hardest of English),emphasis and of course the \nconstant struggle between the different types of English which you don't \nget in German or Dutch (save for Flaams).\n\n\" Cultural differences between Germanics and Saxons are minor\" \nThat's an awful disrespect for cultural diversity you're showing there. \nThere's a close link,sure but they're not the same.\n\n\"I hate when people say one country is better than the other\"\nNever said that.\n\n\"You have an inferiority complex\"\nThis sums up the argument. \nThe whole reason why you're getting butt mad is because you never learned \nwhat a *value judgement* is.\nWhen I talk about colonialism,spreading of influence from the British \nEmpire,linguistic supremacy,I'm not making a value judgement. It has \nnothing to do with what I like. English came to be the language of the \nworld because the British Empire acquired technological and military \nsupremacy over the world,enough to assert it's idiom all over.

Because you would NEVER \nhad said \"It's Britain and the rest of Europe\".\n\nOr well, you could also have an inferiority complex. But i don't think you \nlive in Europe.\n\nAnyways. In English you have the word \"The\" as only possibility... In \nGerman it can be Der, Die, Das... that's 3 times more, so 3 times more \ncomplex.\n\nIn English you have the word \"Walk\" and it stays the same in every form. I \nwalk, You walk, We walk, they walk...\n\nIn German and In Dutch too, that word \"walk\" changes in EVERY instance. ich \nlaufe\ndu l\u00e4ufst\ner/sie/es l\u00e4uft\nwir laufen\nihr lauft\nsie/Sie laufen\n\nIn English you just say \"mine\".. In German, it depends on the sentence... \nIt can be mein, meine, meiner, meinem, meinen and meines...\n\nAnd you even THINK that English is not easier? This is not a point of \ndiscussion. English is SIMPLY easier. THAT is a great reason for Europe to \ntake English as a trade language. And IT is the reason why it was voted to \nbe the language in the US. Because they were also thinking about making \nDutch the language in the US, but they went for English in the end. Yes,, \nthere was a vote for that... It was not because of power or rule.\n\nAnd now you translate your book into English to sell it to the west... \nBecause we agreed upon that language... If you want to sell your book in \nRussia, you have to translate it to Russian cause your English version is \nnot gonna sell well.. Same goes for China and India...\n\nAnd if you are so knowledgeable about the Dutch and the Germans, then you \nwould know they have practically the same culture as the Britsh. Some minor \ndifferences, but in essence, they are the same. And the Brits have NEVER \noccupied the Netherlands OR Germany. There is no conquest involved, we have \nbeen trading and talking for centuries and we \"grew up\" together. \nNaturally, we have the same kind of tradition and the same kind of habits.\n\nI have no white guild, but i'm a big Europe proponent... And I HATE it, if \npeople start pretending that ONE country in the EU is dominant, supreme or \nbetter then the others. It is simply not true.\n\nAnd Dawkins isn't doing that, but YOU are. ",

My native idiom is Portuguese and it seems it is you \nwho is unaware of the dynamics of global culture.\nYou see,it's difficult for you Brits (and Americans as well) to see how \nmuch of your culture is exported sometimes because you're living in it.

It's a factual \nclaim that can be attested.

English is not \neasier than the rest.I can speak German and Dutch so I can tell. It's \nbecause the British Empire expanded it's influence to global proportions. \nIt wasn't a decision by some \"big shot\".

Gods used \nto be the reason for droughts and earthquakes. Now we know they're caused \nby weather patterns and tectonic plates respectively. Now that practically \nevery one in the 1st world has a camera on them at all times the sighting \nof angels doesn't happen any more.\n\nReligion and science aren't totally incompatible but every discovery of \nscience renders supernatural explanations less likely and impotent. God is \nremoved from his traditional place as a concerned and active participant in \nthe world to the watchmaker of deism. The defining aspects of god become so \nvague it leads to a troubling state of credulity where anything can be \ninterpreted as god, it's so vague that it becomes functionally meaningless. \nAs example would be in the past it was commonly believed God and heaven \nwere located in the clouds.

I read most of them but got tired since it \nwent on so long. I just wanted to get my say in since I believe I have a \nvalid argument and debates are fun.\n\n\"Killing Jews was a benefit to German Soceity in the 1940's, going by what \nyou said, you would support this.\"\n\nI have actually argued this before and tell people Hitler was neither a bad \nperson nor evil. We would be hailing him as a hero had he won the war and \nwe were born in his society. Killing Jews may have benefited Hitler and his \nfollowers but it does not benefit me in any way so I do not support it.\n\n\"Do you decide what is a benefit and what is not a benefit?\"\n\nActually, yes. It is impossibly difficult to know what truly will be best \nfor society so what is best is up to every individual. I would even argue \nthat terrorists are \"right\" in their own sense. Assume what they believe in \nis true, then them killing people truly is what would be best for society \nas a whole. Now assume they are incorrect, which you probably already do \njust as I do, then them killing people is a terrible burden to society and \nwe should do everything we can to stop them. \n\n\"You will feel pain, fear and dread, they are emotions, but they exist and \nare factual and need to be considered in this topic.\"\n\nThey can be considered but should they? What effect does a single human's \npain have on society? And for that matter, what is best for society? We are \nrapidly approaching overpopulation with the exponential growth of humans so \none less human would help us in that regard. Do your personal feelings \noutweigh the actual benefits of various actions? Yes, I do try to weigh \nhuman life in a numerical way because emotional value is no real value at \nall as can be seen in all too many places. \n\n\"Finally, To point out the fallacy you are making regarding DNA.\"\n\nWhat is the fallacy and where am I wrong?\n\n\"And you clearly dont understand DNA, if you fertalize a human egg, do you \nget a Penguin?\"\n\nUm, no.

            "text": "Sorry for the late reply, I'll try to reply to your points in the order \nthat you stated them in. Firstly, you said there are now living theoretical \nphysicists who are Christian. Well, there are some and you can pick and \nchoose however much you want, but 96% of all physicists are atheist and \nthat's gotta show that physics and religion don't go so well almost all the \ntime. Also, I like to think of religion as sexuality. For example, I'm sure \nboth of us can agree that heterosexuality and homosexuality are complete \nopposites and contradict each other. A heterosexual man cannot be a \nhomosexual man and vice-versa. However, you can be a heterosexual, for \nexample, that supports homosexuality. It's the same for science and \nreligion. You can be scientists who is religious, but the 2 ideas are still \ncontradictory. This is because religion for the most part is belief without \nevidence (the definition of faith). Most religious people believe what they \nbelieve because a book or some scripture says so. When somebody opposes and \ncriticises their religious beliefs, they hide behind their right to hold a \nbelief. On the other hand, science does not take its knowledge from ancient \nbooks or scriptures. It aims to find out the truth about the universe. It \ndoes not accept the most probable answer, only the correct answer. For \nexample, the fact that life is so complex yet beautiful most probably means \nthat it was made by a creator. However, for science, just because it's the \nmost probable answer doesn't mean it is the answer. Science tries to find \nexactly what causes life and perhaps life's purpose. When somebody \ncriticises scientific knowledge and beliefs, scientists are open to it and \neven encourage criticism so that they can improve on their research and \nfindings.\n\nYou said god's laws/ commandments apply to the behaviour of people, and not \nnatural laws. Well, that's not what the Bible and many Christians would \nthink. The Bible claims to understand and explain natural things, such as \nthat god created Earth, the Universe and life. Many such claims about the \nnatural world have now been refuted by science. Also, the Bible says no one \nshould work on the Sabbath. Anyone who does should be stoned to death. If \nyou really want to follow the Bible as it is, see whether you can follow \nthat \"Law\" as stated in the Bible. In fact, it's not god or anything divine \nthat gives us our morality and understanding. It's really just our brain. \n\nLet me explain a scenario to you. Let's say that recently one of your loved \nones passed away, and you are immensely depressed and don't feel the will \nto do anything anymore. When you go to a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist \nsays \"The solution is simple. Just believe that the person didn't die, and \nyou won't be sad that he died anymore.\" There's an obvious problem with \nthis solution. The thing is, even though believing that the person didn't \ndie will restore your psychological health, you know that he did die. So, \neven though it's useful to believe that he didn't die, it's simply \nimpossible to believe such a thing because you know the truth. Similarly, \nwhile it may be useful to believe that a god exists, what matters most is \nthe truth, and the truth is that no god exists. You cannot hold a belief \nbased on its utility. Beliefs are based on evidence. I believe a table is \nbrown because I see it to be brown, and so do others. It's the same thing \nfor a god.",

Those laws apply to the \nbehavior of people towards each other (and even towards\nanimals on the Sabbath...) in other words, if we do these things for the \nright reason, the problem of 'X' will sort itself out with -or without your \n'box'.\nOne more thing;..the shared belief that we are coexisting as God would have \nus, is a powerful psychological component when we use science to go\n' where no man has gone before '.

However, there are other theories in \nscience such as the theory of evolution, the Big Bang theory, the black \nhole theories, etc that indirectly reject the existence of a creator, \nbecause these theories in a way replace the need for a creator. Think of it \nlike this: There's a small box in front of you, and you don't know what's \ninside. It could be anything . One day, you open up the box and see that x \nis actually inside, and you know that x cannot coexist with any other thing \ninside the box (in the same way that the scientific theories cannot coexist \nwith the idea of a creator). Thus, although you cannot directly disprove \nthat something else exists in the box, because x exists in the box, it's \nhighly unlikely that anything else can.

It feels good to \nhave confidence in something that you yourself can test instead of just \nhaving to rely on someone else's words.\n\n\nWe also don't have to be \"anti-religion\" so strongly like some atheists \nare... We just have to become \"scientists\" again.. We don't need a degree \nto be a scientist.. as Carl Sagan once put, we are all natural born \nscientists! As babies we test and try things all the time.. That is how we \nlearn. We are taught religion.. so, we all just need to remember our \nearlier methods =)\ufeff",
