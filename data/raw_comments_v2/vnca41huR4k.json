This one time at a tryout I saw a \nkid for the first time due to the fact that he was new trying out for my \nlocal club but he didn't make it. Funny thing is he was the best player \nduring the session. He was playing striker , and I guess you could say he \nwas competing for the position in the team against one of my teammates (Who \nwas already in the club but after all you need to tryout every year). In \nthe end my teammate got his spot back, but the new guy who was clearly \nbetter didn't even get a spot on the team. This is why sometimes I feel \nlike coaches at times disregard a players ability but most importantly why \nthe its usually the same players picked every year for the squad and it \njust doesn't feel right in my stomach.\ufeff",
