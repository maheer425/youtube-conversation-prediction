These are \nnot particularly rare diseases, min you, but common ones that don't affect \nfirst world countries or diseases that governments have declared that \nsufferers should get free medication for. One big example is Tuberculosis, \na disease that kills has been given EPIDEMIC status by the WHO and yet into \nwhich little to no research funding goes into. These are the WHO's key \nfacts for it:\nTuberculosis (TB) is second only to HIV/AIDS as the greatest killer \nworldwide due to a single infectious agent.\nIn 2013, 9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from the \ndisease.\nOver 95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and it is \namong the top 5 causes of death for women aged 15 to 44.\nIn 2013, an estimated 550 000 children became ill with TB and 80 000 \nHIV-negative children died of TB.\nTB is a leading killer of HIV-positive people causing one fourth of all \nHIV-related deaths.\nGlobally in 2013, an estimated 480 000 people developed multidrug resistant \nTB (MDR-TB).\nThe estimated number of people falling ill with TB each year is declining, \nalthough very slowly, which means that the world is on track to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goal to reverse the spread of TB by 2015.\nThe TB death rate dropped 45% between 1990 and 2013.\nAn estimated 37 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment \nbetween 2000 and 2013.\ufeff",

I watched this episode when it came out in August, and it would \nmake sense that a problem of sanitation (regarding Ebola) wouldn't effect \nthe United States because of out constant cleanliness, even outside of the \nhospital. Now, unfortunately, there is news that a man has brought Ebola \ninto the country (around Dallas) and the media is making a pretty big deal \nof it, mostly because of the fact that he was contagious when the doctors \nfirst say him, and then decided that he was healthy enough to be sent away.\nI feel like this would be a chance to reintroduce the topic in a video and \naddress that risk, now that your example is kind of a reality. How worried \nshould Americans be about this? And is the media having an appropriate \nreaction?\ufeff",

Not addressing it leaves \nthe field open to conspiracy nuts. My 2 cents: our system needs the \npopulation to be kept in constant fear, so it creates institutions that do \nthat by applying penalties to truthful journalism (e.g., the real dangers \nof malaria, reporting on which results in fewer clicks and less ad dollars) \nand rewards to fraudulent journalism (e.g., Ebola and ISIS are coming for \nyour children!!!).
