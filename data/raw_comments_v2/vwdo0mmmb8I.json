America has an obsession with cats and dogs, \npreferring to ignore the mass human suffering around the world. \n\nThe amount of money in food, toys and medical care lavished on pets in the \nWestern world is astonishing when you consider how many fellow human beings \nare living in abject poverty and misery. It just seems like escapism to me \nthat we lavish so much time, care and money on animals that aren't as \nnecessary as they are.\n\n I believe having a pet is great, but Westerners in particular have more \npets than any other part of the world. It's not just about having a pet, \nbut multiple pets, and it's not just a few people who own them but the \nmajority. It just seems that humanity's priorities are seriously misplaced. \nAnimals are a joy and they are absolutely wonderful to love and be parts of \nour lives, but we've also forgot that there are literally tens of millions \nof human beings at this moment living lives none of us would want to live \nourselves.\n\nBUT we've got tens of billions of dollars to blow on fluffy cuteness. Also \nkeep in mind that we have turned these pets into dependents (rather than \ntaking care of our more serious needs in our society) and there are \nunscrupulous individuals profiting off of breeding these pets at ridiculous \nrates all for profit. Just some food for thought.\ufeff",
