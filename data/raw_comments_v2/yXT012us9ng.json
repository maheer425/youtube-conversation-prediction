Instead there is just the absence of heat.\n\nLike if there was an area of space that was at the true absolute zero, \nmeaning no observer, no radiation of any kind, just complete emptiness \n(reminder; such an area in space is highly theoretical), since nothing is \nthere, there is nothing to \"giggle\" and zero heat is the state of such a \nplace. But as soon as ray of light, or an observer, or something along \nthose lines is present, heat is something that is now in the area. So \nagain, like I learned back at university in a physics class, there really \nis no such thing as cold. Just the absence or lower amounts of heat. We \ncreated cold as an adjective to describe the opposite of heat, but in \nreality if there was a bar graph involved, the bar on the x-axis would \nrepresent heat, and on the y-axis, which cannot go negative, there would be \nmeasurements like absolutely positively zero heat present (like in that \ntheoretical part of space), and then climb up in whatever increments you \nwant to represent how much heat is present.\ufeff",

Last I heard they found pieces in a \nweird place in the ocean, but other than that, I have no idea what the \nlatest is. But it did go down in a strange way, I think even turning off \nthe transponder (suggesting hijacking) but who knows? Maybe China saw that \nit had been hijacked and thought it might be headed their way to do a \nChinese 9/11 and brought it down? If something like that is the case, they \nwould have sent up fighters, but instead of using cannons to disable the \nengines and do other damage which would cause the plane to crash in such a \nway that it would be easily seen that it was brought down by a fighter, \nthey would have used the Chinese equivalent of the U.S. AIM-7 Sparrow, \nwhich would have left little bits to fall out of the sky over a vast area \nof the sea. That's an out there theory, but who knows? (Well the U.S. knows \nbecause we have active sonar units all over that area which can not only \ndetect a sub or a boat, but just by the sonar return, can identify exactly \nwhat model of sub it is or what model of ship it is. So the sonar \"nets\" \nwould have picked up the sinking debris, but the U.S. would never come out \nand say it and give away knowledge of our systems. They know we have them, \nthey just don't know where they are.) So again, your guess is as good as \nmine.",
