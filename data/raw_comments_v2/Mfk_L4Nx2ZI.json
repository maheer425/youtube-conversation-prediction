It turns out the answer, which is \nanother widely-used formula, is n! / (n - r)!.\n\nTo see this, say we have 7 objects and are arranging 3 of them. For the \nfirst object, we have 7 choices. For the second, we have 6 choices, and for \nthe third, we have 5 choices. Therefore, there are 7x6x5 ways to arrange 3 \nobjects from a group of 7. This is equal to 7! / 4! because of the \ncancelling and stuff.\n\nSo, when r is a positive integer less than or equal to n, there are n! / (n \n- r)! ways to arrange those r objects. \n\nWhat happens when r = n? Then the question is, we have n objects, and how \nmany ways are there to arrange all n of them? According to the formula, \nthere are n! / (n - n)! = n! / 0! ways to do so.\n\nBut we already know the answer. There are n! ways to arrange n objects. \nTherefore:\n\nn! / 0! = n!\n\nHence, 0! must be equal to 1. It can't be equal to any other number. It \nalso can't be undefined due to that equality.\n\n\nAlso, 1 isn't a prime number. It's not prime by definition. But the \ndefinition I'm talking about isn't the one you know. I'm talking about the \nmore general definition of what a prime element is, and prime numbers in \nthe integers are just a special case of these general prime elements. \nUniversity-level abstract algebra is required to fully explain what I'm \ntalking about, but just know that 1 is not prime by definition.",

Then the question is, we have n objects, and how \nmany ways are there to arrange all n of them? According to the formula, \nthere are n! / (n - n)! = n! / 0! ways to do so.\n\nBut we already know the answer. There are n! ways to arrange n objects. \nTherefore:\n\nn! / 0! = n!\n\nHence, 0! must be equal to 1. It can't be equal to any other number. It \nalso can't be undefined due to that equality.",

            "text": "+nailuj100 You are right in that there is a lot of vacuous truths involved. \nHowever, there is only one permutation of the empty set.\n\nIf you wish, we could define n! to be the number of permutations of a set \ncontaining n elements. If you've ever taken abstract algebra and seen the \nsymmetric groups, this will come as no surprise.\n\n\nThe permutations of a set S are simply the one-to-one and onto functions \nfrom S to itself. For the empty set \u2205, we can use vacuous truths to show \nthat there exists a unique one-to-one and onto function from \u2205 to \u2205.  This \nwould show that there is one permutation of a set with 0 elements and would \nsuggest that 0! should indeed be 1.\n\n\nWe define f: \u2205 \u2192 \u2205.  Since \u2205 has no elements, we don't have to specify \nwhere any elements go.\n\n\nIn order to prove that f is well-defined, we just have to show that if x = \ny are elements of \u2205, then f(x) = f(y).  This is vacuously true, so f is \nwell-defined.\n\nIn order to prove that f is one-to-one, we just have to show that if x and \ny are distinct elements of \u2205, then f(x) and f(y) are distinct elements \nof \u2205.  Again, this is vacuously true, so f is one-to-one.\n\nIn order to prove that f is onto, we just have to show that if y is an \nelement of \u2205, then there exists an element x of \u2205 so that f(x) = y.  This \nvacuous truth shows f is onto.\n\nIn order to show that there is only one permutation of \u2205, we have to show \nthat for any other permutation g of \u2205, f = g.  To show this, we just need \nto show that if x is an element of \u2205, then f(x) = g(x).  Again, this is \nvacuously true, and so there is only one unique permutation of \u2205.\n\nI guess the natural question would be... can't we also prove that if x is \nan element of \u2205, then f(x) does not equal g(x)?  The answer is yes, we \ncould prove that.\n\nHowever, in order to show that two functions f, g: S \u2192 T are distinct, you \nmust show that there exists an element x of S such that f(x) does not equal \ng(x).  You cannot prove this statement for S = \u2205 because you would be \nrequired to prove that there is an element in \u2205, which is false.\n\nSo even though the functions disagree on every element of the empty set, \nthey also agree on every element of the empty set, so they are the same \nfunction and are not different functions.",

I see a lot of evidence, but nothing actually \ngot proven here. \nAs was demonstrated, the pattern as it was described here does not work. \nNot only that, but no law or definition of factorials says that this \npattern must be complete all the way to zero. If they do, I'm calling those \nlaws or definitions out. Aside from the complicated math which was casually \nleft unexplained here, all these rules for determining factorials lean on \neach other in suggestion that 0!=1. One wasn't even mentioned when the \nsuggestion began to form (I still remain entirely unconvinced that a proof \nexists at all). The one I refer to is the classical definition, which is \nalways used to introduce factorials. This is that \nn!=n\u2022(n-1)\u2022(n-2)\u2022...\u20223\u20222\u20221. Even this definition is circumstantial, and \nmust be bypassed when determining numbers such as 3!. But by this method of \nfinding factorials, which is taught as a default, one *MUST* have a number \nthat is both positive and greater than 6. \n\nIf you then get down to a better and more generic definition, which is that \nn! is n multiplied by all non-zero integers less than itself, and n>0, you \nrun into trouble once more. First when calculating 1!, because 1 has no \nnon-zero integers less than it. This is not covered well in the original \nmodel either, although it is always assumed that one can make the logical \njump to find that 1!=1. 1! cannot be calculated unless you choose to make a \nspecial case specificaly for 1!, dictating that 1! Is equal to 1\u20221, or \nsimply 1 if you don't feel multiplication is necessary in a \nmultiplication-based function. If you don't specify this case, you have no \nway at all of knowing what 1! is, because as I previously stated, the rules \n(without relying on other *PATTERNS*) do not give a method for calculation.\n\nThe problem with 0! should be obvious by now, as it is exactly the same as \nthe problem with 1!. There is no method for the calculation of 0! which \ndoes not rely on mehods whose reliability may or may not extend all the way \nto 0!. So once again, we have an answer defined by flawed logic, which is \naccepted *UNIVERSALLY* in the mathematical community. I have a problem with \nthat.\n\nIf someone would like to get in touch and explain the infinite integral and \nhow it *RELIABLY* proves both 1! and 0!, feel free to pm me on youtube or \nsend me an email.
