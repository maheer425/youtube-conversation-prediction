The SPI protocol, which is used for digital devices to communicate with \neach other, has a MOSI and a MISO pin, which stand for Master-Out-Slave-In \nand Master-In-Slave-Out, respectively.\n\n#3. In the Parallel ATA interface standard, which we used in the past to \nconnect hard drives and disk drives to our computers, the terminology is \nused to refer to two devices functioning on the same bus. There is a master \nand a slave drive, and they use different timing.\n\n#4. When a device uses multiple clocks, there is one master and many \nslaves. The master clock is used to synchronize all of the slave clocks.\n\nIn general, the Master/Slave terminology is used to refer to unidirectional \ncontrol.\ufeff",

In this verse, Allah charged the Banu Qurayza Jews with \nsupporting the Quraysh of Mecca ' from their strongholds '  against \n Muslims in the battle of Trench (627) . Based on this unsubstantiated \naccusation, Allah commanded that some of the Jews, the adult males, were to \nbe slain, and the rest, the women and children, enslaved. The false-Prophet \nduly complied with this supposedly divine command. He distributed the \nenslaved women and children among his disciples, himself acquiring \none-fifth of them. The young and pretty ones amongst the female captives \nwere made sex slaves ; The false-Prophet himself took beautiful Rayhana, \nwhose husband and family members had been slain in the massacre.

Within the \ncontinent itself, local exchanges among adjacent peoples fit into a greater \nframework of long-range trade.\n\nThe merchants from Britain, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands who began \ntrading along the Atlantic coast of Africa therefore encountered a \nwell-established trading population regulated by savvy and experienced \nlocal rulers.\u201d\n\nAfrican progress has been stopped by slavery and colonialism because we \ndidn\u2019t have guns when the europeans came.\n\nSlavery and colonialism ARE NOT Africa History, They have interrupted it!\ufeff",
