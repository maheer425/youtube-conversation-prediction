I'm not saying those things \ndon't happen, but you're in control of the play and pause button and you \nchose the take you decided to put online. \n\nOtherwise it just epitomizes the parrot industry in general. People with a \nbarely half working knowledge of how to take care of parrots thinking \nthey're \"trainers\" because they've had a parrot for two years and giving \nnew pet owners crappy advice, then hoarding more animals than they can \nhandle and calling it \"humane\".\ufeff",

When he is biting \nsomething he is not supposed to, I've heard you need to give him \ndistraction. Something he can chew instead, since that's probably what they \nlack. They could also be bored and don't know the rules. Don't yell or be \naggressive, it'll make them stress out and anxious (not saying you do that, \nbut in case you don't know!). Does he have parrot toys? Have you done \nresearch on the internet about the parrot you have?\nAlso, when he goes somewhere he isn't allowed to (curtains he poops on), \njust calmly move him elsewhere. He may learn that way it is not a place for \nhim to sit on. Have also places for him to go, such as parrot stands ( \nhttps://www.google.fi/search?q=parrot+tree&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=zAZtU_8rpovJA9qxgNAE&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=643#q=parrot+stand&tbm=isch&imgdii=59n2D2G_9diEsM%3A%3ByBbwAq2iCVOd5M%3B59n2D2G_9diEsM%3A \n) where he'll learn to be and chill. Only on the cage gets really boring.\nBut yeah, I'm really no expert, I'd suggest you google some ring neck \nparrot sites where their general personalities and needs are listed, and \ngiven help and information to the owners!",
