The political effects of WW1 were the only \ntopics covered in this video. I can only guess as to why that is\u2013 That our \ninvolvement on the battlefields in 1918 didn't produce a decisive outcome \nas much as it provided the Allies the rejuvenation that Germany didn't get, \nthus exhausting the Central Powers more than demonstrating Allied \nsuperiority. My overall impression of WW1 is similar to a 12 round \nheavyweight boxing match where no fighter has proved better than his \nopponent so far and no real winner is obvious. But when it came time to \nstart the final round, the Allies had just enough stamina left in them to \nstart the 12th round whereas the Central Powers didn't, so they were TKO'd \nfrom the fight for not getting up off the stool to greet the round.\ufeff",
