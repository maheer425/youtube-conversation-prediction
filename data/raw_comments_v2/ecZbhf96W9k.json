If everyone were to try and have a vegan diet they'd be killing \nthemselves because they would be starving their body of necessary nutrients \nand such. Most of today's generation have adapted to being omnivores and \nmost likely aren't able to revert back due to this and the preference of \nhaving many food options to choose from. Though to those who are able and \nhave bodies that can tolerate such a diet I applaud you, I have tried meat \nand dairy-less diets in the past and I just could not keep up with them due \nto feeling sick/lethargic/faint all the time.\ufeff",
