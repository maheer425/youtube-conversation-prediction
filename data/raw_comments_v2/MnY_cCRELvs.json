For example, vegan-friendly maxipads, medicine, \ndildos, or whatever. In some parts of the world people can't afford this \nstuff, so they either hunt or grow their food. Of course, growing certain \nfoods can be quite difficult in some places so it limits their options \nquite significantly. I love almond milk; I think it tastes better and \nsettles with my stomach better than regular milk, but it's too expensive to \npurchase regularly. Regular milk, while I can't stand to drink it on its \nown, is just a more convenient purchase. Almond milk is just something that \nI treat myself to on occasion.\n\n\nMaybe they need to stop making healthy foods and alternatives so expensive \ncompared to what people generally buy. Also, don't we eat a lot of the \nfoods we eat BECAUSE we want to? People can survive on raw vegetables \nalone, sure, but you and I both know you're going to have a desire to \nenhance it so that it makes it more appealing.",

There is no biological emperitive for us \nto eat meat, so one should not be used as an excuse to do so.\n\nPeople who eat meat do so because it is enjoyable and pleasurable to them, \nand they put that pleasure above the right of those animals to live out \ntheir lives without being food.\n\nThat is a personal choice, and people should own the responsibility for it, \nnot try and shove it off onto biology. It's a false justification.\n\nThis isn't an attack or moral judgement, I eat meat myself; it's just a \nstatement of logic and fact. I can admit I eat meat because It's \npleasurable to. It is a choice, not a need. IMHO, it's disrespectful to the \nanimals we eat to pretend otherwise.",

This set showcases an array of bug-eating plants, \nfrom the Venus flytrap - beloved of children the world over - to the Cape \nsundew, which lures insect life in with drops of sweet-smelling fluid on \nthe highly-adhesive tentacles that line its leaves. Surrounding tentacles \nthen move to further ensnare the insect, before glands on the leaf start to \nrelease digestive enzymes - liquefying the insect's internal organs and \nallowing them to be digested by the plant. \n\nVideographer / Director: Francis Chee / Sinclair Stammers / SPL\nProducer: Thomas Midlane\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the \nLike Barcroft TV on Facebook: http://goo.gl/7ayYgY\nFollow Barcroft TV on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9\nBarcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp\ufeff",
