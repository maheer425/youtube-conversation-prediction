I understand.\nDIRECTOR: Mr. Bob-san. You are sitting quietly in your study. And then \nthere is a bottle of Suntory whiskey on top of the table. You understand, \nright? With wholehearted feeling, slowly, look at the camera, tenderly, and \nas if you are meeting old friends, say the words. As if you are Bogie in \n''Casablanca,'' saying, ''Cheers to you guys,'' Suntory time!\nINTERPRETER: He wants you to turn, look in camera. O.K.?\nBOB: That's all he said?\nINTERPRETER: Yes, turn to camera.\nBOB: Does he want me to, to turn from the right or turn from the left?\nINTERPRETER (in very formal Japanese to the director): He has prepared and \nis ready. And he wants to know, when the camera rolls, would you prefer \nthat he turn to the left, or would you prefer that he turn to the right? \nAnd that is the kind of thing he would like to know, if you don't mind.\nDIRECTOR (very brusquely, and in much more colloquial Japanese): Either way \nis fine. That kind of thing doesn't matter. We don't have time, Bob-san, \nO.K.? You need to hurry. Raise the tension. Look at the camera. Slowly, \nwith passion. It's passion that we want. Do you understand?\nINTERPRETER (In English, to Bob): Right side. And, uh, with intensity.\nBOB: Is that everything? It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.\nDIRECTOR: What you are talking about is not just whiskey, you know. Do you \nunderstand? It's like you are meeting old friends. Softly, tenderly. \nGently. Let your feelings boil up. Tension is important! Don't forget.\nINTERPRETER (in English, to Bob): Like an old friend, and into the camera.\nBOB: O.K.\nDIRECTOR: You understand? You love whiskey. It's Suntory time! O.K.?\nBOB: O.K.\nDIRECTOR: O.K.? O.K., let's roll. Start.\nBOB: For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.\nDIRECTOR: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! (Then in a very male form of Japanese, \nlike a father speaking to a wayward child) Don't try to fool me. Don't \npretend you don't understand. Do you even understand what we are trying to \ndo? Suntory is very exclusive. The sound of the words is important. It's an \nexpensive drink. This is No. 1. Now do it again, and you have to feel that \nthis is exclusive. O.K.? This is not an everyday whiskey you know.\nINTERPRETER: Could you do it slower and ----\nDIRECTOR: With more ecstatic emotion.\nINTERPRETER: More intensity.\nDIRECTOR (in English): Suntory time! Roll.\nBOB: For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.\nDIRECTOR: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! God, I'm begging you.\ufeff",
