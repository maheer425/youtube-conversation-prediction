The beauty \nof this book is Billy jumping through different parts of his life and the \nstrange metaphors he uses.

Narration would remove the kind of intimacy you have with the \ncharacter: Billy's crazed life draws you in and forces you to see horrors \nhe speaks of, and if Billy is telling the entire theater about his \nfeelings, it just feels like a letdown. Some things can't be spoken out \nloud; they can only be thought. \nP.S. This is also why I don't want there to be a Fahrenheit 451 movie.
