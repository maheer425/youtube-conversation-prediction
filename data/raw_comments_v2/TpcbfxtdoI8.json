            "text": "+Shrek Ogreton I have already made my answer to your question quite clear. \nI understand what you're saying but, aside from the logical flaws I have \nalready pointed out, there are other problems with your statement. I notice \nthat you provide no logical rebuff of my argument, and that is because you \ncannot. The fact that you did not respond to my question about having read \nthe Koran indicates to me that you are simply a reactionary led by the nose \nof the Western media into blind hatred of a religion you have never \nsufficiently studied. You brushed it all aside because you are determined \nto stick to your guns, which indicates that this is not a debate, but this \nis just your forum for promoting your ethnocentric, bigoted viewpoint \nwithout consideration for facts or reality. Nevertheless, in the hope that \nless entrenched ogres might benefit, I will provide further validation of \nmy thoughts and of reality.\n\nLet's explore.\n1) Buddha is considered the perfect human by Buddhists and, although \ntechnically Buddhism HAS NO GOD, Buddha is often treated as a God, which \nputs him in a higher position than Muhammad, who was only one of a long \nline - and the final - prophet who spent his Islamic years trying to \nprovide the best example he could to the various peoples of that area - an \narea rife with problems. We might choose to follow in his footsteps and do \neverything he did, which would be starting with a highly hedonistic \nlifestyle for at least 2 decades, followed by a long period of ascetism and \nstudy with hermetic gurus, leading to the period in which he supposedly \ngained enlightenment. While some stories about him downplay his abilities, \nand he just seems like a wise old guy, other stories (particularly Chinese \nones) paint him as being supernatural and engaging in battles with his \nopponents in a most unpacifistic way, and employing supernatural skills \nthat make the best stage magicians like Copperfield and Angel look like \nless than rank amateurs, and even possessing skills that make the stories \nof Moses, Jesus and others pale in comparison. I don't particularly care \nfor those stories because they seem to violate some of the principles he \nstood for, and I suspect that Buddhists who seriously review his life and \nprinciples would turn away from such stories. Nevertheless, these things \ncould be used in the same way the story of Aisha STILL IS in some \ncountries, much to the detriment of Islam and the rights of females.\n\n2) Christ is considered not just the perfect human by Christians, not just \na prophet by Buddhists, Muslims (Isa) and Baha'i, but he is by most \nChristian sects also considered either the Son of God, the living avatar of \nGod, the embodiment of the Holy Spirit, and/or God. That puts him in a \nvastly superior position to Muhammad and Buddha, and he is also looked to \nas an example of how to behave. Any stories that represent him in a less \nthan sterling light have been suppressed by the Christian sects and people, \nand such stories were removed either at the time of the assembly of the \nBible, or by later scholarly councils. Any effort to suggest that he might \nhave married (Mary M. or another) is quickly squelched for reasons that are \nunclear to me, and this image of him being, I guess, a virgin as a reason \nfor Catholic priests not being allowed to marry, despite the fact that for \nmany centuries Catholic priests married and had kids. Actually, the \nhistorical reason for the change was due to the fact that inheritances were \nbleeding money and property out of the church into the hands of priestly \noffspring (legitimate and otherwise). It was at that point that the \nviewpoint of Christ as an unmarried and saintly man seems to have been \nheavily promoted to discourage those men of the cloth from further fun with \nfamilies. The point? That the Christian religion has done exactly what \nyou're complaining that ALL Muslims do (but many don't actually), times \n100. Many Muslims accept the Hadists and/or the Sunah in part, but there is \na great deal of debate about which of the individual stories are reliable \nand which are false, as John Green tried to point out - kind of like the \nChristian Apocrypha. There are a number of Muslims who only accept Al \nQur'an and ignore the Hadists and Sunah entirely because they believe they \nare either irrelevant, non-holy or false. While there are still countries \nthat look to the story of Aishah as proof that men can do what they want to \nwomen and girls, and there are indeed entire Muslim nations in which Muslim \nwomen are treated like chattel, this is not true throughout the Islamic \nworld, nor is it even the dominant viewpoint. However, for bigots like Ogre \nS., it is a convenient launching point into diatribes on what happened over \n1000 years ago as if it were today and, thus, I encourage Muslims to \nrealize that what was done then by Muhammad doesn't mean that everything \nMuhammad did then was right or guided by God (which is, by the way, the \nEnglish word for Allah, just as Allah is used to describe the Gods of \nvarious religions in the Arabic religion, as John Green tried to point \nout), and that they should be prepared to abandon examples provided in such \nstories - especially ones with poor references and/or which violate human \nrights.\n\n3) History does matter. If people died when they were in their 20s and 30s, \nthen it became critical for them to marry VERY young and start procreating \nas soon as possible as as to be able to raise their kids to the age of \nmajority before kicking the bucket. This is a matter of both biology and \nsurvival of the \"species\" in a given area. You can deny this all you want \nbut, had you been born 100 years ago, this wouldn't even be an issue to \nyou. You and I and, indeed, many Muslims, are not happy that this was the \nnorm of the time, but it doesn't erase that such a necessity existed then - \nno matter how much of a tantrum you have. To say that what someone did \n1,000 or 10,000 was wrong and we need to change to be more civilized (yeah, \nwe're so civilized that we're destroying each other and the entire planet \nover paper money) now is a great thing - history is to be learned from so \nthat we can be better people - but to summarily judge people of the time, \nwhose lives and the forces that influenced their decisions were radically \ndifferent than now, is completely unfair. They were trapped within their \nown context and, not so unlike today, in many places trying to take a \nbetter moral position resulted in bad things happening. Lots of prophets \nand other people who tried to reform areas ended up being murdered, or \nbeing locked up, or otherwise being mistreated. Look at Joan of Arc for \njust one example - her end was not a pretty one, nor was Braveheart's (the \nreal one, not the Hollywood one.) Today, in the nation with the greatest \nfreedoms on the planet - the US, talking about religion, politics, sexual \norientation, abortion, and a few other topics can end up in violence and \neven murder - how's that freedom when one religious group violently \nsuppresses particular individuals and groups because THEIR 2,000+ year old \nbook says it's not right, yet they don't allow other religions the same \nrights? That's hypocrisy. Now, don't get me wrong - I don't agree with the \nBible saying \"murder the homosexuals\" any more than I agree with the story \nof Aishah being used to force little girls into marriage and sex in this \nage. What I don't agree with is one group condemning another group for \nsomething while that first group does the same sort of thing. I doubt \nyou'll get the similarity - ogres rarely understand things like this, since \ntheir brains are full of muck. They're never as smart as Shrek - I should \nknow since I used to read Tolkien and play AD&D and thus I am an expert on \nthe topic (smirk). (Just as a note, this is not an ad hominem attack on \nShrek - for that to be possible s/he would need to stop hiding behind the \nalias and reveal him/herself to us. I can only have fun with the name, not \nthe person, until that happens. Hopefully, \"Shrek\" has a delightfully \nsupportive name that lends itself to his/her defense.)\n\n4) A large number of Muslims around the world do not strictly adhere to the \nHadists and Sunah which promote behavior that is no longer socially \nacceptable or biologically necessary to carry on the species. When a Muslim \n(IMHO fraudulent) cleric in Indonesia attempted to marry (not for the first \ntime) a 12 yo girl, there was a massive protest from Muslims in Indonesia. \nIn the end, the cleric went through with his marriage with the support of \nthe family of the girl (who benefited financially as this particular cleric \nis obscenely rich, thus raising them up out of poverty), despite various \ngovernment and private individuals trying to convince him not to, and he \nwas jailed, where his fat ass sits now - deservedly so. It is my hope that \nthe guards do not accept his bribes to make his stay comfortable, and that \nviolent prisoners visit his anus daily because he is a blemish on the \nreligion of Islam.\n\n5) The story of Aishah has various vagaries - different versions assign \ndifferent ages for when she was married (6-9) and when she and Muhammad \nconsummated their marriage (9-12) as was required by law (and still is as, \nin some religions, an unconsummated marriage is not considered valid). \nAgain, you may not like this, but law is law and failure to follow the law \n- at least when seen by the public and authorities, could be dealt with \nvery severely - look at what happened to Jesus.\n\nI think I've wasted enough of my time on this. Hopefullly someone learned \nsomething.\n\nNote: ISIS members are not Muslims. Reports from victims who survived being \nhelp by ISIS indicate that they neither sholat/shalat/salat (prayed), nor \nspoke to each other in the manner of Muslims, nor did they observe the \nrules of Islam in other regards. In any event, even if they are some sort \nof Muslims, they have strayed so far from the path of Islam that only \nutterly ignorant people like them would say they're Muslims.",
