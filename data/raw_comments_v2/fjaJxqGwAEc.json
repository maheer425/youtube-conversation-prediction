I \nfelt completely fine afterwards, but the pain on the first day when the \nanesthesia was wearing off was horrible. The taste of my blood and the \nsmell made me vomit (which freaked me out). I have no idea why but my \nsaliva was extra thick and slimy for the first day and a half to the point \nwhere it almost felt stringy. After the bleeding stopped the afternoon \nafter the surgery though the pain alternated from almost nothing to \nmoderate and my nausea went away. Today i moved onto semi-solid food, which \nis nice and the pain in my jaw is alright (feels equivalent to someone \nhaving punched my jaw hard an hour ago). I had little swelling in my face, \nmostly in the left side of my face now. I hope my stiff jaw doesn't last \nlong though... i want to bite into some actual food. :)\ufeff",
