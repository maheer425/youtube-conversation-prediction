After locking the 2 zipper tabs \ntogether, one can use a pen to penetrate the zipper seam elsewhere. Once \nthat hole is open you can manually open/unzip the bag and then close it. \nZipping the zippers to the end of the bag and back again until the zipper \nseam is closed again. Customs often does this to look in bags at the \nairport.\ufeff",
