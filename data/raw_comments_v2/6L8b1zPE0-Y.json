Jedi master. I understand that for his character \narc he had to be a selfish little shit, but honestly the way he was \nportrayed never felt right to me.\n\nHe should've been the poster-boy who gave in to temptation and fell from \npower. It's just like RedLetterMedia said:\n\"In the prequels we hear Obi-Wan mention how he was 'a good friend' but we \nnever get to see any kind of friendship between them, the entire trilogy \nshows them bickering and Anakin acting selfish and impulsive.\"\n\nBefore seeing the prequels, I'd always had the story in my head that \nObi-Wan and Anakin were comrades, not master and apprentice. They were \nbrothers in arms but the events of the Clone Wars ended up leading Anakin \ndown a darker path.\n\nObviously this is all just my opinion, and I understand we both may have \nmisunderstood each other.
