Vaccines are considered \"inactive\" \nversions of the virus. However, with a poor enough immune system said \nvaccine could do the opposite of what it's intended to do, since the virus \ncould potentially \"reactivate.\" \n\nBefore anyone losses their mind, I have nothing against vaccines (just the \nflu one, but that's personal); I just hate it when people say, \"it's okay, \nit's a dead version of the virus,\" because that's a lie. \ufeff",
