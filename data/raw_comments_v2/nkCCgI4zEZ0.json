Tbh that's not considered forbidden love if fans are just \nagainst the relationship. That is what we call \"so called forbidden love \namong jealous and in denial fans\". Yeah company doesn't allow it until they \nreach a certain age but they did that for a reason. And I think idols \nunderstand that too. \n\nIt leans more towards same gender love. \"Don't Look At Me Like That\" don't \nlook at her as if she's abnormal and disgusting. Idols don't go out \npublicly and people won't even have the chance to look at them lol xD \nreporters just report and stuff. Netizens judge them through internet, not \ndirectly in front of them. \n\nA lot of you refer to baekyeon but meh. They were (mainly) hated because \nthey broke their promises. Only a couple of them hated on them bcs they're \ndating xD (p.s. idc if they are dating orz)\n\nAnd homosexuality gets cursed very straightforwardly tbvh. Even in public.\n\nSoo- tadahhhh.
