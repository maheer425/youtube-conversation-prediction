She is blind to the consequences of not \ngetting betrothed and bitches at her mother for only doing her fucking job!\nShe is so oblivious to the blatant like the fact that her mother could've \nDIED from eating the cake she got from that witch. All she ever cares about \nis changing the laws and doesn't give two shits about anything else. She \nnever develops as a character, she never does anything meaningful and she \nis just a pain to watch.\nShe refuses to grow and mature and at the end of the day just makes Mater \nfrom Cars look like Mr. Potato Head!\n\nThat pathetic excuse for a main character was the big ass nail that shut \nthe coffin in an instant.\nIf that wasn't enough, the story is complete, unoriginal shit, the morals \nare confused and forced and the title of the film is a fucking lie! What \ndoes this story have to do with being brave?! NOTHING!\n\nBrave is, and shall be, one of the worst animated films ever made. It does \nnot deserve any attention or awards in the slightest.
