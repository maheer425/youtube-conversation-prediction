I do think the guests should \nhave more of a role in cooking the food. I guess in the same way Ben from \nsorted food gets the others to do the cooking, but without stealing their \nideas. \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to consider having a collab with Sorted food \nwith maybe a Masterchef theme or something. \n\nI think its a fabulous idea that you have got a range of chefs on this \nchannel as well. Jamie likes to look after the little man lol.\n\nI really enjoy being able to look on youtube for short good cooking clips, \nfor recipes or entertainment. Personally I'd enjoy it more if you toke this \nchannel a bit out of the box to the regular cooking shows on tv and really \nplay on the youtube platform. But I get how that could be risky or unliked.\n\nAnyways love all your stuff! Was in the mood to give away feedback lol\ufeff",
