I \nlooked around for the designated shoe storage, but I saw none. I stood at \nthe doorway like a dog whom was hesitant about going inside, and I slowly \ntip-toed onto the hardwood floor. I felt so weird and uncomfortable. When \nmy friend and her family all came into the living room, I could not allow \nmyself to step on that carpet with those damn shoes! So I would take them \noff and leave them right on the hardwood where it meets the carpet. I did \nthat every time I came over, and my friend started noticing it and doing it \ntoo, so she would leave her shoes next to mine. \n\nI once saw her mom lay on the couch with her shoes still on.

It's certainly not all Americans that wear shoes in \ntheir house, TV definitely isn't accurate in this regard.
