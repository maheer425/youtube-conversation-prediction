I usually get it to 65\u00b0C, \nthis way it stays A LOT more juicy. 80\u00b0C is something I'd expect from the \nabsolutely nuked store grill chicken.\nIf you're worried about bacteria:\n\"Essentially, the red line in this graph indicates how long a piece of \nchicken needs to be cooked at a specific temperature in order to be deemed \nsafe for consumption. So, for example, we see that at 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), the \nchicken is safe pretty much instantaneously (hence the 165\u00b0F minimum \ninternal temperature recommendation by the USDA\u2014they are being very \nconservative and assuming you will bite into it the second it reaches that \ntemp). Whereas at 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), the chicken needs to be held for 35 minutes \nto be safe.\" So if you're measuring the thickest part and it's 65\u00b0C, the \nrest of the chicken is way past that temperature for quite some time \nalready. No health hazard there, but a lot more moisture and flavor.\ufeff",
