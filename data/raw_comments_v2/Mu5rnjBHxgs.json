A reflexive reaction supporting NSA spying \nbecause it is somehow improving U.S. security is easy to buy into, but that \neffect hasn't been shown and there is no hard evidence that this kind of \nactivity has had that impact. However the real concern is that this kind of \nactivity raises deeper questions about privacy and associated ethical \ndilemmas, personal and group identity, freedom of expression, freedom to \ndissent and exercise civil disobedience, freedom to challenge the status \nquo, an open and trustworthy political system etc etc. These are the rights \nof a free and open society, and are directly challenged by the NSA \nactivities that Snowden has shined a light on.\n\nDoesn't it bother you that parts of these programs have been found to be \n\"almost certainly\" unconstitutional? Doesn't that concern you at all? If \nyou're serious about protecting the US, I'd suggest you take breaches of \nthe constitution seriously too - threats to the US aren't just external. I \nfor one don't want my elected government spying on what I do. Not because I \nhave anything to hide, but because I maintain that I have a right to \nprivacy and freedom of expression without government meddling, oversight, \nor spying.
