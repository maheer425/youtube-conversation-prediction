            "text": "The Doomsday Argument is fallacious, or at least contentious (certainly not \nas \"simple\" as you make it seem). Imagine two universes, identical in every \nway from the big bang until vsauce. In one, doomsday occurs in 2015. In the \nother, population expands for many thousands of years. Can vsauce really \ntell which universe it is in? The Doomsday Argument, I think, is \ntantalizing due to the \"illusion\" of self.\n\nLet me pose a counter-thought experiment to illuminate what I mean by \n\"illusory\"... One day man invents a teleportation device. Since humans are \nassemblages of atoms, this machine works by scanning the exact atomic \nstructure of your entire body in its current state, then disassembling \nthose atoms, and ultimately re-assembling your body with different atoms \n(like a 3D print) from the template, but in another location. That's \"you\", \nright? Your self, after all, is contained in your brain, which is part of \nyour body. All hopes, ideas, memories, worries about Doomsday, etc. are \ndetermined by the state of your material brain. Now suppose the machine \nbreaks, and it does not destroy the original \"you\", but still reconstructs \n\"you\" elsewhere. Which \"you\" is \"you\"?\n\nThis relates to my point about the Doomsday Argument for the following \nreason. The idea that you \"could have been\" a person born in another time, \nsay the future, is a non sequitur: it separates self, an illusory brain \nconstruct, from the objectivity of human brains, as if one's self could \nhave equally been birthed into the brain-like shell of a different human \nbeing.\ufeff",

Countries like Japan and Germany do not have a natural positive \ngrowth of the population. A lot of scientists predict a stopping of growth \nfor humanity at around 15billion people in the next 50-100 years.\n\nI saw a nature documentary about the struggle to survive a while back and \nsubordinate clause really got me. It said something like \"and the next best \nthing to imortality is to produce offspring\".\nMaybe it is just that. That at some point in evoulution a species \n(unconsciously) chooses to not grow anymore but instead just stay in a \nquasi immortal state or even slowly die out.\n\nWe are still driven by inborn behaviour and instincs. But given the power \nof will and also the fast development of ways to alter natural limits and \nprocesses that may change someday.\ufeff",
