They can have a bad trip from it, have a heart attack \n(if they have heart problems) and die. Also I wouldn't want to live next to \nsomeone in an apartment who smokes weed and have it go through a hole in \nthe wall or something and get either my kid high or me high if I'm doing \nsomething productive. With alcohol people can't get drunk off of it in the \nair with weed you can slightly. So therefore that's the other reasons why \nthey don't make it legal guaranteed. If anyone does not have anything nice \nto say about this then don't waste your time commenting. It'll do you no \ngood.\ufeff",
