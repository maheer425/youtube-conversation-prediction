Think about it: if time travel WAS possible, in some \npoint in the future someone would have traveled back in time and find \nhimself in the era whe live in now, prehaps someone might have traveled to \nthe time i started writing this comment to prove me it DOES exist, but that \ndidn't happen cuz i already posted it. And because of this argument. I can \nnot only say it doesn't exist now, but it will absoluteley NEVER EVER EVER \nEVER exist..\n \nOn to my second point. If the argument above is false and time travel will \never exist.It will be a funny scenario/paradox.\n If you would want to travel back in time and plan on getting back to \nyou're own time aswell....every time you are about to step in to the \"time \nportal\", if you look back, you'll see a copy of yourself running in to do \nthe same thing, why? Cuz if you go back in time and after a while travel \nback to the momment before you stepped in to the portal. You would again \nsee yourself but this time infront of the portal. And the \"new\" copy of you \nwill look back at you...remember? You did the same thing when you \n\"originaly\" went into the portal yourself, not youre copy. You looked back \nand saw you're \"copy\" but now technicaly you are the copy since you are the \none behind \"yourself\". So every time basicaly if you are in front of a time \nportal you'll constantly see yourself running to the portal in a endless \nloop.

            "text": "Einstein's 1905 false constant-speed-of-light postulate was not supported \nby the Michelson-Morley experiment. Actually, in 1887 (prior to FitzGerald \nand Lorenz advancing the ad hoc length contraction hypothesis) the \nMichelson-Morley experiment unequivocally confirmed the variable speed of \nlight predicted by Newton's emission theory of light and refuted the \nconstant (independent of the speed of the light source) speed of light \npredicted by the ether theory:\n\nhttp://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/kursarchiv/SS07/Norton.pdf \n John Norton: \"These efforts were long misled by an exaggeration of the \nimportance of one experiment, the Michelson-Morley experiment, even though \nEinstein later had trouble recalling if he even knew of the experiment \nprior to his 1905 paper. This one experiment, in isolation, has little \nforce. Its null result happened to be fully compatible with Newton's own \nemission theory of light. Located in the context of late 19th century \nelectrodynamics when ether-based, wave theories of light predominated, \nhowever, it presented a serious problem that exercised the greatest \ntheoretician of the day.\"\n\nhttp://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/2/Norton.pdf \n John Norton: \"In addition to his work as editor of the Einstein papers in \nfinding source material, Stachel assembled the many small clues that reveal \nEinstein's serious consideration of an emission theory of light; and he \ngave us the crucial insight that Einstein regarded the Michelson-Morley \nexperiment as evidence for the principle of relativity, whereas later \nwriters almost universally use it as support for the light postulate of \nspecial relativity. Even today, this point needs emphasis. The \nMichelson-Morley experiment is fully compatible with an emission theory of \nlight that CONTRADICTS THE LIGHT POSTULATE.\"\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC \n Relativity and Its Roots, Banesh Hoffmann, p.92: \"There are various \nremarks to be made about this second principle. For instance, if it is so \nobvious, how could it turn out to be part of a revolution - especially when \nthe first principle is also a natural one? Moreover, if light consists of \nparticles, as Einstein had suggested in his paper submitted just thirteen \nweeks before this one, the second principle seems absurd: A stone thrown \nfrom a speeding train can do far more damage than one thrown from a train \nat rest; the speed of the particle is not independent of the motion of the \nobject emitting it. And if we take light to consist of particles and assume \nthat these particles obey Newton's laws, they will conform to Newtonian \nrelativity and thus automatically account for the null result of the \nMichelson-Morley experiment without recourse to contracting lengths, local \ntime, or Lorentz transformations. Yet, as we have seen, Einstein resisted \nthe temptation to account for the null result in terms of particles of \nlight and simple, familiar Newtonian ideas, and introduced as his second \npostulate something that was more or less obvious when thought of in terms \nof waves in an ether. If it was so obvious, though, why did he need to \nstate it as a principle? Because, having taken from the idea of light waves \nin the ether the one aspect that he needed, he declared early in his paper, \nto quote his own words, that \"the introduction of a 'luminiferous ether' \nwill prove to be superfluous.\"\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/QED-Strange-Theory-Light-Matter/dp/0691024170 \n Richard Feynman, \"QED: The strange theory of light and matter\", p. 15: \"I \nwant to emphasize that light comes in this form - particles. It is very \nimportant to know that light behaves like particles, especially for those \nof you who have gone to school, where you probably learned something about \nlight behaving like waves. I'm telling you the way it does behave - like \nparticles. You might say that it's just the photomultiplier that detects \nlight as particles, but no, every instrument that has been designed to be \nsensitive enough to detect weak light has always ended up discovering the \nsame thing: light is made of particles.\"\ufeff",
