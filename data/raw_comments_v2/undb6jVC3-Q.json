I didn't say you shouldn't pay for anything, I just simply stated that \nif you want to really learn something, you can. \n\nFor example, years ago, I was told that I shouldn't try to rebuild the \nengine in my car and I should just pay to have someone do it for me which \nwould cost roughly around 6k as quoted from one of my local mechanics. I'm \nsure we can all agree that if your car is about 10 years old, it's just not \nworth having it professionally done unless it has some sentimental value. \nSo instead, I decided to take the initiative, and learn a skill. I spent a \nheck of a lot less rebuilding that engine than what I was originally \nquoted, and it has been running great ever since. Now I may had to purchase \ntools, an engine hoist, and a few parts. In the long run, now that I know \nhow to fix my own car. I will continue to save a lot of money till the day \nI die... The only price I really pay is my time. But for myself, I really \nenjoy working on these sort of things so time is not a factor for me. Also \nwhen it comes to PDR, while yes I agree with you, it will probably take 5+ \nyears to be an \"expert\", expert level really has to do with the ability to \nhandle just about any dent which you gain through experience, but the most \ncommon dents are ones that are quarter-sized. Which in my opinion, doesn't \nrequire a huge amount of expertise. There are tons of ways to practice in \norder to get real-world experience. But in any case, I'm sure you don't \ncare, and you will continue to bash my dreadful grammar. I wish the best of \nluck to you.",

By the logic you used in your comment, nobody should pay for anything, \neveryone should just become experts in everything.\n\nYou want coffee? Better start cultivating the beans.\nYou need a greenhouse to cultivate? Better learn how to manufacture glass, \nsealant, and fittings.\nYou need fertilizer to cultivate? Better learn how to synthesize ammonia.\nYou need a thermostat and humidifier to cultivate? Better learn how to \nbuild circuitry and program.\nYou need materials for that circuitry?
