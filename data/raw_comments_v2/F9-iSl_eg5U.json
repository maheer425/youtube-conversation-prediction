            "text": "Great vids CGP. FYI: the Lemmings myth is from a Disney documentary that \nwas filmed in my home province of Alberta Canada in the 70s I think. \nLemmings are not native to our province and the film-maker has been said to \nhave paid Inuit children north of Alberta to capture the Lemmings for use \nin his film. He then used tight camera angles and other video trickery to \nmake a small amount of lemmings seems like many and then he pushed them off \nthe cliff from behind. This was because he truly believed in the myth of \nsuicidal lemmings but couldn't capture the behaviour on film. His solution \nwas simply to fake his belief. As I understand it, the original belief in \nlemming suicide was based on some accurate field observations but as more \nobservations of lemming were made it became apparent that they do indeed \nhave population explosions and many of them to venture out into new \nterritory and this has on occasion led to situations where a pack of them \nare close to a ledge or something equally deadly and the pushing from the \nback of the crowd pushed the front lines to their deaths. No indication of \nthem just being suicidal. Just a bunch of mammals pushing into one another \nlike when we humans go to sports stadiums. Put the stadium's edge on a \ncliff with no walls and the guys pushing to the bathroom would cause other \nhumans to fall to their deaths in the same manner. That's what I've heard \nhere in Alberta where it was filmed and Snopes says almost all the same \nstuff. I'm pretty sure this is where the myth was born. Cheers.\ufeff",

Great film - really \npoor judgement (by the film makers - not he lemmings!!!)\ufeff",

While most venom are complex protein that get \nbroken down in your stomach, rendering them harmless, some venom will kill \nyou, or  at least make you violently sick if eaten. Compounds like \nTetrodotoxin are venom that's way more toxic than Cyanide. It will kill you \nif you ingest it.\n\n*\"Poison that isn't Venom isn't only dangerous if you ingest it. There are \nmany Poisons that are easily absorbed through the skin.\"*\n\nThat is absolutely correct. poisons can be inhaled, absorbed through skin, \nor injected as well. It is not at all dependent on the delivery medium.\n\n\nIt is very confusing because people think venom and poison are two \ndifferent things, which is not true. The difference between venom and \npoison is their classification. They are classified by two different \nmethods. Classification of poison is - If it is toxic for you, it is a \npoison; regardless of whether you ingest it, inhale it, absorb it via skin, \nor inject it in your bloodstream. Venom is exclusively classified by the \ndelivery medium, so venom is a poison that an animal directly injects in \nyour bloodstream.\n\nEdited: to add more information.",

            "text": "There's one little misconception you missed out on with the Daddy Long Leg \nanimal misconceptions. \n\nIf Daddy Long Legs were poisonous, no matter how big their fangs, and no \nmatter how able to bite you they could be, they would be as harmless as a \nperson biting you. Why? because a poisonous animal is deadly to be eaten. \nThey are poison to those who ingest it. Therefor if they were the most \n\"poisonous 'spider' \" eating them would be deadly.\n\nVenomous is the term attributed to animals with, you guessed it, venom. \nThey will hurt, maim, or kill when you are bitten by them. But technically \nthey are totally safe to eat as long as you remove their venom. This is \nillustrated with the Lionfish.\n\nThe Lionfish is an extremely invasive species in the Carribian and many \nother parts of the world. It has many spines across its back, tail, and \nunderside which all are venomous. But the second you cut them off the \nLionfish becomes a tasty human snack. 100% harmless, and 100% delicious. \nProblem is its impossible to convince the avarage idiot that venomous is \nnot the same as poisonous and many people refuse to eat it because they're \nafraid it will kill them with some invisible neurotoxin embedded in every \nfiber of its being. Therefor the Lionfish is wiping out indigenous and \nendemic fish species across the world outside of its natural habitat since \nfish havent evolved to view it as prey and the predators havent evolved to \nview it as their tasty snack. Including humans, the biggest predator in the \nworld to local fish populations.\n\nSo in conclusion\n\nOne; Daddy long legs can be as poisonous as they want to be in any \nhypothetical scenario. As long as you don't eat it you're safe (in this \nparticular scenario) \n\nAnd two: Learn to like eating lionfish because soon theres going to be no \nmore staple fish in the sea between human over fishing and lionfish caused \nextinctions. \ufeff",
