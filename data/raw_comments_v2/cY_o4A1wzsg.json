So I wouldn't call that an alternative teaching method \nfor him.\nThe reason I said to examine your ego is because you're projecting what \nyou're thinking onto Derek and interpreting his laughter as something \nnegative. He's clearly not laughing at the participants in a mocking way. \nQuite the opposite. He's creating a light hearted atmosphere in an attempt \nto make people comfortable with being wrong. He's often laughing when he \nacknowledges that something is counter-intuitive or difficult to grasp. At \nother times he's laughing because the respondents are actually so close to \nthe RIGHT answer that he knows they know it deep down inside.\nLastly, these videos are intended to educate people on the internet. Not to \nsay that he doesn't want to educate the people he interviews on the street \nbut they are also a means to that end. There will always be room to improve \nhis delivery but I feel that the people offended by his videos are the ones \nwith the greatest egos to protect.",

I called him a \ndouche because of *how* he reveals their lack of knowledge about a subject \nthat the average person would have no clue how to answer properly. I \nsuggested there is a better way*\n\nFrom what I've seen He asks a difficult question. Then he proceeds to smile \nand laugh in their face and they answer incorrectly. Later he posts their \nincorrect answers on YouTube for millions of people to see. Now if you \nunderstand basic human psychology, if someone claiming the a doctorate in \nphysics authority in a subject laughs at your answer to a question in the \nfield he specializes in you would probably feel pretty bad about your \nanswer. When you insult someone's intelligence directly like this you hurt \ntheir confidence in themselves. Now I've read a few well recommended books \non human psychology that all agree that when you insult someones character \nthey \"shut down\" you could say they become defensive. When someone's in in \na defensive mindset they are not likely to accept new information, instead \ntheir brain goes straight to working on how to justify their answer to \nreclaim credibility. No one wants to be seen as \"stupid\". Have you ever had \nan argument with someone who isn't listening to your side? Maybe Politics? \nReligion? These subjects heavily reflect this pattern people become very \ndefensive when it comes to these topics, and unless you're an extremely \nunderstanding person whom is very open to new information when someone \ninsults your \"beliefs\" no matter the subject chances are you become angry \nand defensive and the discussion (soon to be argument) often leads nowhere \nfor both parties.\n\nInstead try a supportive approach that uses praise to build up the \nlearner's confidence in their attempts to analyze the situation from the \nknowledge basis of the average person.\n\nHow about.... you smile, say \"Not a bad answer, I understand why you would \nthink that way, and many do. It turns out I'm a physicist and have access \nto current research on the topic and can explain how the actual process \nworks. It turns out that the actual solution is more like 'this' because of \n'these reasons', but you were on the right track, nice job.\"\n\nPlease *explain* Kobayashi, how my response is a reflection of my ego? I \nwas angry at how his approach to learning is partially destructive for the \nsubject in question and how he chose to justify it. I'm looking to bring to \nlight what he's trying to avoid.",
