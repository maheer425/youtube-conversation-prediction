I was told \"It would be the only set of tires I would need\"  well, \nlet me tell you... that is not the case... Stopping distances suck, going \nup snowy hills sucks.  The \"all season\" tires do only slightly better than \nsummer tires, but fall WAY short than what winter tires can do.

Once the temperature drops below freezing around late December, \nwe don't see a temperature above 32 for the next 4 months...  I own a house \nup a steep road and I could never make it up the road with the \"all season\" \ntires.
