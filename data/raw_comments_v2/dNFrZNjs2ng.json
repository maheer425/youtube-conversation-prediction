Can it get any better than this? Well that's just it,  \nit cannot, it only gets more defective with people being curious and \nexploring. OUR GRASSLAND NEEDS TO HEAL, alright. It can only recover in \ntime. So please adventurers deferment, let B.C have a rest. May we give \nthis beautiful British Columbia a break, please!\n\n I  glanced at someone's  comment saying, come see us now while it is still \nhere. Because it won't be like this for much longer. ( btw that was a 6o \nyear old business man ) That must've been the most abominable comment 've \never grasp mentally.  You know seeing is believing and seeing this land in \nbelievable, right. Well  we need to  believe our land WILL make it.  IT \nWILL FIGHT THROUGH THE POLUTION IT BREATHS AND EVERYTHING ELES \nTHAT PRESENTS IT WITH HARM.... It's all in our heads.  If people continue \nto make nasty comment that begins with our thoughts. it wont make it! Its \nthat simple cause we didn't have faith. We'll be at fault because not many \nof us hoped for the best, not many of our actions were use to help make \nthis a better place.  The population on this earth is only growing \nbigger while our little world, in a growing galaxy, stays the same.. We \nneed to change. Let us start suffering now! As many of us already are. But \nwhy not let the ones, living life to the fullest,  with all there money \nthey worked for,  suffer as well. Cause correct me if I am wrong those are \nthe ones doing the most harm....\ufeff",
