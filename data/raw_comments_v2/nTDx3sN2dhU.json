In the past, forge welding and other \nmethods were used to join metal.

As a result, it ended up being associated with the name \n'arc' welding. However, in today's plethora of available welding methods, \nit is an ignorant term. Other welding techniques common to the industry \ninclude: 'Gas metal arc welding' (Which is also broken into sub \ncategories), 'Gas tungsten arc welding', 'Flux-cored arc welding', and 'Gas \nshielded flux-cored arc welding'.
