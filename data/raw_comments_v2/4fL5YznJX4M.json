Jk jk. But \nanyway, we went to study in Central Auckland. We saw every young Asian \nwoman looking like they're about to go to a photoshoot and I felt like a \nfailure of a young Asian woman. XD They looked so cute! Every day! They \nbother! And I felt insecurities I didn't know existed! (This is just me, \nnot everyone reacted like this but yeah I developed a skill of putting on \neyeliner in 50 seconds flat just to not feel completely ugly.) But \neverytime I went back to our hometown, I feel overdressed for even a smidge \nof makeup and I go back to my old bare face ways ahaha. I think that \nhowever you are as a person, you will adapt to the social norm. If let's \nsay you moved to a city full of people who bother, you will eventually \nbother. For how long? dunno, hasnt ended for me yet. :O Depends where I am \ntbh.\ufeff",

Now, I pretty much \nwear it every day haha It's nice to put effort into how I look though \nbecause it really helped me build my confidence when I started trying. The \ncomment about the pressure for Koreans to fit in but not so much foreigners \nwas interesting and I noticed that a lot during the two times I've been to \nKorea. I think that's partially due to the fact that in America, where I'm \nfrom (as well as some other countries) we grow up surrounded by people who \ndon't look like us (note: THIS IS NOT ME SAYING ALL KOREANS/ASIANS LOOK \nALIKE BECAUSE THEY DON'T AND I KNOW THIS SO IF YOU COMMENT ABOUT ME SAYING \nTHIS, THIS IS MY PRELIMINARY ACT OF STICKING MY TONGUE OUT TO YOU XP). But \nfrom an early age, we are exposed to multiple different cultures and races \nand the only way to \"conform\" or simply live in such a diverse society is \nto accept differences (a good thing, in my opinion). But if you grow up and \neveryone around you is the same race as you, then the mentality of \"fitting \nin\" - combined with a history where cultural values are heavily influenced \nby Confucian values from the next-door neighbor (China) - may be simply \nmore natural. It's easier to accept the foreigners will always be different \nbecause no matter what, as someone who is 100% of North-Western European \ndescent, I am not going to look like I am from Korea. Doesn't mean I can't \nlove the country or the culture though :)\ufeff",
