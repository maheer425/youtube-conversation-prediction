While it might not be \nthe most beautiful, scenic city out there - even though the many lakes and \nbike trails are fun - the reason that Berlin flourishes is its unique \nlifestyle. Berlin is very young, dynamic, open-minded, \"artsy\" and \n(sometimes sadly) even hipster. It is also called the \"clubbing capital\" of \nthe world: impulsive and extensive nightlife is a huge part of the cities \nidentity. While possibly mind-blowing for an energetic and cosmopolitan \n20-30 year old, some things might leave a bad taste to more conservative \nand cozy travelers. The rich and fascinating history and the city itself \nstill make a trip worthwhile nevertheless of course, but it's an aspect \nthat is left out of the video entirely and is worth mentioning!\ufeff",
