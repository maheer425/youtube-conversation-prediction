Many families destroyed, many good people lost lives. \nGandhi might have been a good showman, but he was neither a good manager \nnor anyone listened to him in the British Parliament nor in the Congress. \nHe played a good distraction during the freedom struggle of India. Nehru & \nJinnah secured their positions in the newly emerged power centres. Gandhi \nhad to be shown the way out. Firebrand leader Subhash Chandra Bose was \nexiled from India due to the conspiracy plotted by the British govt & \nGandhi-Nehru played pimps. Even Gandhi supported the death sentence of our \nbeloved martyr Bhagat Singh & his comrades. \n\nBritishers promised to give India's demand of total freedom, if the British \nIndian Army could fight well in time of deep trouble of England during \nWWII. Discontent rose up in the ranks of British Indian army who had won \nthe WWII for the British & no matter how loyal they were, it was time for \nIndia to break the shackles of colonisation.\n\nBritishers played with the lives of innocent people of India & none of the \nso called great leaders like Gandhi nor Nehru stepped in to stop the \nviolence.\n\nCommoners were forced to leave their ancestral homes of hundred years, in \nboth sides of the borders. It was a total chaos. No territorial force was \ncommissioned to look after the security of the people. Rather force was \nrallied to escort the British elite from India & to safeguard Indian \nCongress elites. \n\nMany common British citizens also suffered due to the lack of \ntransportation provided by the British govt for the return journeys. \n\nThe provinces which gave India the most number of martyrs - Bengal & \nPunjab, were split in half during the decolonisation & their populations \nthe most affected in the process.\n\nThe decolonisation process left the deepest scar in the face of India, with \nthe seeds of communalism, half worked constitution, most importantly the \nNehru family in the centre of the power. No matter how the western media \nuphelds Gandhi, he is loosing his fakester image very rapidly even in \npublic. \ufeff",

It's \na common misunderstanding that these peoples were different tribes, while \nin all actuality they were different classes created by the Belgian \ncolonists.\n\nThey granted the Tutsi's, who were often richer (they owned cattle, that's \nalso where the word Tutsi is derived from) more rights and privileges. That \ncreated a class system which made it easier for the Belgians to keep the \npeople under their thumb.\n\nLater, when Ruanda became independent, the Hutu's would rise up against the \nTutsi's, who were still in power. Because the titles \"Hutu\" and \"Tutsi\" \nwere hereditary, the distinction is still made today, even though there is \noften no difference in wealth anymore.\ufeff",
