Jetta's were damn economy cars originally, the S2000 was \nlike a $30,000-$40,000 sports car when this came out even if it was an NA \n4cylinder. Racing the S2000 against a guy you know has a huge bankroll for \nmodding cars, would have been a fools errand if Jesse knew much about \nracing cars. And then if Jesse knew anything about Chan's violent history, \nrunning from him and not giving him his car was a huge mistake. Even though \nChan is kind of the bad guy in this film, I feel for him in this scene in \nthat he wins a race legitimately, and then the guy squelches on the deal \nand runs off in his Jetta which is humiliating, he goes to Jesse's closest \nfriend to get him what is \"his car\" to rectify the situation and he gets \nhis ass kicked in front of a shit ton of people. On top of all that, SWAT \nteams raid him and his business and don't even find any criminal shit on \nhim. He really got dicked around by the \"protagonists\" in this film. I \ndunno, maybe I'm thinking deeper than the director intended.\ufeff",

They can hold the brakes and since the front \nbrakes were deactivated it helped them spin the tires more for a more \ndramatic launch.  They usually don't do much to these movie cars to \nincrease power.  That means they need to use other tricks to get them to \nsmoke the tires like that.",

(He was \nmarried by the way, and we were at a wrap party in Burbank, and he, and she \ngot into a huge fight) Anyways,@0:15-0:20 seconds thats me in my BMW M3 \nblack. Notice how in editing they screwed up. They the guys passing me, and \na second later show me, and them again. We shot this at the San Bernardino \nairport for one week, in about 115 degree weather. Which turned the shoot \ninto a wet t-shirt contest, which turned into a no t-shirt contest. Some of \nwhich actually got on film. By the way I filmed on this for over a month \nand a half. From Downtown LA, to El Segundo, to this nasty hot airport. The \nfilm was actually going to be called Redline, but when I went to the \nproducer's and told them that the name had been used for a car product, \nthey changed the name to Fast and the Furious. On set we had water bottles \nwith labels made up with \"Redline\" on them which I still have in my \ncollection of stuff. I was also one of the stunt drivers for the scenes on \nEl Segundo Blvd. It is the scene in which you see all the car's bailing \nout, and a helicopter shot from above at $100,000 dollars an hour. You may, \nor may not know this but the movie was low budget, and used a lot of \nunknown's. Hell i made more than some of the principal actors. That scene \nwas done in one take, and we were being chased by real city cops. In one \nscene you see this guy come up with a pizza box. Well that was actually the \ndirector of the movie. LOL They saved money wherever they could. I could \ntell u so much more, but i would have to kill you. For example: The \ncolorful cars everyone wanted back then with the emblems all over them. You \never look at the rotors on them, they look real huh? Nope! they were round \npieces of wood, that had holes drilled in them to make them looked slotted. \nAnd then spray painted. Yep thats low budget. i'll never forget we had all \nwalks of life on this shoot. One of them happened to be a hard hitting gang \nbanger. He whipped out his laptop on El Segundo Blvd, I will never forget, \nand started showing me photo's of his weapon arsenal. This guy could have \nstarted a war with what he showed me. needless to say those of you against \nguns. Don't be! because guys like this will always have them, long after \nyou have made them illegal for everyone else!\ufeff",
