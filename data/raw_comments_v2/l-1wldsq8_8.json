I loved this movie and I \ncan rarely find much problems with it. However I did nitpick Frozen so i am \nbeing a hypocrite. I've noticed it more and more nitpicking and saying a \nmovie is terrible. I notice it's with movies like this, Professional \ncritiques love it, others didn't and decided to tear it apart and make it \nseem like their right and everyone else is wrong. I mean i may nitpick but \nI don't make a movie seem terrible, Frozen wasn't terrible. I did see it as \na good movie just not as good as everyone made it out to be.\ufeff",
