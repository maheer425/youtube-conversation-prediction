The older version of himself, causing all this turmoil, \ncould have never been send back in time to get killed - simply because he \nwould have never existed.\n\n(Something BttF did right - Marty's parents not meeting in the past would \nhave resulted in him bever been born, for instance.)\n\nAnd \"older friend\" watching in terror how his fingers disappear?
