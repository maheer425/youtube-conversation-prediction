We only saw \nDarth Maul fight twice (but I gotta say, the Naboo reactor fight has to be \nthe best stuntwork in the entire franchise). Jango Fett had some prominent \naction but had an underwhelming death. General Grievous was supposed to be \nthis Jedi killer, collecting all their lightsabers as trophies and whatnot, \nand he gets killed by a couple blaster shots. And Dooku, I really thought \nhe was going to be the Vader of the prequels, but look how easily he got \ndispatched by Anakin in Revenge of the Sith (I know by this time Anakin is \nsupposed to be one of the best Jedi Masters but Dooku's death was too \neasy). \n\nBesides the overly used CGI, the poor character & actor choices (Jar Jar, \nHayden Christenson, and Jake Lloyd, etc), and some of the poor dialogue (I \nhate the sand), I thought the prequels were at the very least entertaining. \nThey weren't these horrible movies that people had to labor through to see, \nat least for me..horrible in terms of Star Wars quality, but an \nentertaining film is still entertaining nonetheless. \n\nSpeaking of \"I hate the sand\", that whole quote sounds sooo cheesy when \ntaken out of context. But when you think about how Anakin used to live on \nTatooine, a desert planet, it's easy to understand why he talks about it. \nIt's still cheesy but when taken out of context like in a short clip, wow \nit's bad. Wow.\n\nBut seriously, \"People sitting and talking, standing and talking, walking \nand talking, one person standing and talking while another is sitting and \ntalking, people standing and talking then taking a seat for more talking\" \nLOL\ufeff",

But \nall those scenes (especially in prequel) of frontal warfare where two sides \narmed with freaking automatic ray guns just walk towards each other, mowing \neach other down, gets on my nerves. No tactics, no effort put into it so it \nwould look realistic. Back to sequels, attack on Rebel base on snow planet \nis totally meaningless too (using hyper-tech weapons in WW1 style warfare) \nbut again, that was sequels, made in time modern warfare wasn't so close to \nadolescent public.
