This whole \n\"superheroes should *NEVER* kill\" bullshit sends a bad message to kids. \nThat no matter what, one can show mercy and that will make things better \nfor both sides. Mercy is how we let ISIS get so bad. While we should always \ntry to be merciful with our adversaries, after a certain point, there \nshould be no mercy.\n\n\nSuperman killing Zod was the most respectable response. Someone with his \nzeal would never stop, so the only two choices would be to kill him or let \nhim get his way. And no-one wanted the latter option.\ufeff",
