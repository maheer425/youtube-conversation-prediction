Jeremiah \nWright), whom Obama described as a mentor. On March 18, 2008, Obama gave a \nspeech in which he said \u201cI could no more disown Jeremiah Wright than I \ncould disown my own grandmother\u201d and \u201c[Wright\u2019s church, Trinity United] \nembodies the black community in its entirety.\u201d Now Obama tries to pretend \nthat Jeremiah Wright doesn\u2019t exist, and that his extremist anti-white \nphilosophy didn\u2019t influence Obama\u2019s worldview.\n\u2022 Increased the percentage of Americans dependent on food stamps to \nunprecedented levels (now over 15% of the nation\u2019s population).\n\u2022 Militarily intervened in Libya in 2011 without the Congressional approval\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\nrequired by the War Powers Act \u2014 technically an impeachable offense.\n\u2022 Before he entered politics, Obama worked as a lawyer suing banks in \nlandmark cases, forcing them to give home loans to unqualified minority \nborrowers \u2014 a practice now understood as one of the primary initial causes \nof the eventual housing bubble and market collapse.\n\u2022 Handed out over 1,200 waivers to politically connected donors exempting \nthem from the onerous requirements of Obamacare.\n\u2022 Greatly expanding the number of unaccountable \u201cczars,\u201d which essentially \namounts to unilaterally adding new federal departments with no \ncongressional oversight \u2014 leading to a true \u201cbureaucracy\u201d in the original \nsense (rule by unelected bureaucrats).\n\u2022 Using taxpayer dollars to bail out the private pension funds\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\nof autoworkers\u2019 unions at GM & Chrysler.\n\u2022 Illegally ending the welfare-to-work requirements passed by Congress.\n\u2022 Doling out $800 billion in stimulus cash for \u201cshovel-ready\u201d jobs that \ndidn\u2019t exist \u2014 the money just evaporated with no measurable economic \nbenefit.\n\u2022 Alienating and isolating Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East.\n\u2022 Apologizing to Islamists and terrorists for offending them.\n\u2022 Under Obama\u2019s watch, for the first time in history America\u2019s credit\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\nrating was downgraded, due to his poor economic policies.\n\u2022 Stopped American oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing other \nnations with worse environmental records to drill instead \u2014 thereby \nmanaging to both weaken our economy and damage the environment \nsimultaneously.\n\u2022 Proposed in 2008 to intentionally bankrupt the coal industry \u2014 and now \nlies to voters and workers in coal-producing regions about his true intent.\n\u2022 Pretends to be concerned about skyrocketing energy prices, when in fact \nhe vowed to increase them on purpose (so as to make alternative energy \nschemes more competitive\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\n.)\n\u2022 In a primary debate against Hillary Clinton in 2008, Obama said he would \nnever force people to buy health insurance\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\n, since those without it couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. Less than two years \nlater, he rammed through Obamacare, which does indeed force people to buy \nhealth insurance.\n\u2022 During the 2008 campaign, Obama repeatedly promised that if he was \nelected \u201cNo family making less than $250,000 will see any form of tax \nincrease.\u201d This promise was broken over and over again\nimage: http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png\nonce he was elected.\n\u2022 In 2008 Obama vowed if elected to increase security along the \nU.S.-Mexican border \u2014 and then in 2010 stopped construction of a \u201cvirtual \nfence\u201d on the border and re-routed money earmarked for border security to \nother projects.\n\u2022 Cash for Clunkers, which doled out taxpayer money to anyone who wanted to \nreplace their old cars, but which mostly only ended up subsidizing the \npuchase of foreign-made cars by people who could have afforded them on \ntheir own anyway; meanwhile, the traded-in cars were all destroyed, \ncreating a shortage and thereby increasing the cost of used cars, hurting \nthe pocketbooks of poor people.\n\u2022 Violated the U.S. Constitution by authorizing assassinations and drone \nstrikes to kill American citizens abroad \u2014 without due process.\n\u2022 Was caught on a \u201chot mike\u201d promising the President of Russia that he \nwould cave in to their demands for a weaker missile shield \u2014 after he was \nre-elected and no longer had to keep up the pretense that he sought to \ndefend America.\n\u2022 Appointed Van Jones, a former avowed communist who supported a \u201c9/11 \nTruth\u201d petition, to be \u201cGreen Jobs Czar.\u201d\n\u2022 Appointed Anita Dunn, who said Chairman Mao was her \u201cfavorite \nphilosopher,\u201d to be White House Communications Director.\n\u2022 Appointed John Holdren, who perviously entertained the notion of forced \nmass sterilzation to stop overpopulation, to be Science Czar.\n\u2022 Appointed Steven Chu, who openly advocated an artificial increase in \ngasoline prices to $10/gallon (and similar increases in other energy \nprices) to be Secretary of Energy.\n\u2022 Appointed Kevin Jennings, who led a group that promoted X-rated \n\u201csex-positive\u201d textbooks for 13-year-olds, instructed teenagers at a \nconference how to perform \u201cfisting\u201d (anal penetration by fists), who \nrefused to report instances of statutory rape, and who expressed admiration \nfor a member of NAMBLA, to be America\u2019s \u201cSafe School\u2019s Czar.\u201d\n\u2022 When states voted to enforce the federal immigration laws which the \nfederal government refused to enforced, Obama sued to stop them.\n\u2022 Blocked continued construction of the Keystone Pipeline, thereby \nintentionally reducing energy resources for the US and forcing Canada to \nsell more of its oil to China.\n\u2022 Repeatedly changed his position on gay marriage over the years, depending \non what was politically expedient at the moment and which intended audience \nhe was addressing.\n\u2022 Before he was president, Obama staunchly opposed raising the national \ndebt limit \u2014 but once elected, he insisted that it be raised.\n\u2022 When giving a 2009 speech in France that he must have assumed Americans \nwould never hear, he described the United States as \u201carrogant\u201d and \n\u201cdismissive\u201d (while also criticizing Europe elsewhere in the speech).\n\u2022 When states tried to stop election fraud with voter ID laws, Obama sued \nto prevent them from doing so.\n\u2022 Instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to stonewall any investigation \ninto the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panthers.\n\u2022 Promised in 2008 that once elected he would officially recognize the \nArmenian Genocide; but to this date he has still failed to do so, caving in \nto threats and pressure from Turkey.\n\u2022 Vowed to end the influence of lobbyists in Washington, but under Obama\u2019s \nwatch their influence has only increased.\n\u2022 When he was first running for President, Obama promised, \u201cI will not sign \nany non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to \nreview and comment on the White House website for five days.\u201d Needless to \nsay, he has broken that promise with almost every bill he has signed since.\n\u2022 Aided and abetted the \u201cArab Spring\u201d which deposed existing secular \ngovernments across North Africa, leading to a regional power vacuum which \nwas filled by Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other hardline \nIslamists.\n\u2022 Refused to provide assistance or support the the earlier secular Iranian \ndemocracy uprising, allowing them to be crushed by the Islamic \nfundamentalist Iranian regime.\n\u2022 In his first months in office, Obama bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia, \nthe president of China, the Emperor of Japan, and President of Mexico, \namong others.\n\u2022 Ordered NASA to make one of its top priorities not space exploration or \nscientific research but \u201cMuslim outreach.\u201d\n\u2022 Used Obamacare as a pretext to greatly increase the size and power of the \nIRS (which was given 16,000 new agents and additional mandates to penalize \ntaxpayers for noncompliance).\n\u2022 Used the IRS to harass conservative businesses.\n\u2022 In the GM bailout, he illegally shortchanged investors who according to \nbankruptcy laws were first in line to be recompensed; instead, he gave \ntheir share to the unions.\n\u2022 Shut down oil drilling in the US, but then turned around and lent $2 \nbillion to Brazil to support their government-controlled oil-drilling \neffort \u2014 and then promised the US would become one of Brazil\u2019s biggest oil \ncustomers.\n\u2022 Sued Boeing in an effort to control where businesses could locate, kowtow \nto the unions, and block the creation of 1,000 jobs in South Carolina, a \nright-to-work (i.e. no forced unionization) state.\n\u2022 Adopted a longstanding Socialist political slogan, \u201cForward!\u201d, as his \n2012 campaign motto.\n\u2022 Sent insulting form letters to the familes of dead SEALs.\n\u2022 Neither disavowed nor distanced himself from anti-Romney campaign ads \nwhich threatened or implied violence against Republicans.\n\u2022 Shortly after the recent eruption of anti-American violence in North \nAfrica, Obama went to Las Vegas to do his debate preparation in a \nhotel\u2026with a romanticized North Africa theme.\n\u2022 Said in an interview that the Muslim call to prayer was \u201cone of the \nprettiest sounds on earth at sunset.\u201d\n\u2022 Union boss and far-left activist Andy Stern has visitied Obama in the \nWhite House at least 53 times, at last count \u2014 greater access than any \nother private citizen.\n\u2022 Hosted at the White House many Islamist members of groups associated with \nHamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc.\n\u2022 Sponsored performances by and attended fundraisers with radical rappers \nlike Michael Franti and Common, both of whose lyrics have in some cases \nbeen anti-police, anti-white, and anti-America.\n\u2022 Hired Timothy Geithner, who is documented as cheating on his own personal \ntaxes, to be Secretary of the Treasury.\n\u2022 Told Joe \u201cthe Plumber\u201d Wurzelbacher that it was good to \u201cspread the \nwealth around.\u201d\n\u2022 Told small business owners nationwide in a 2012 speech that \u201cyou didn\u2019t \nbuild that\u201d \u2014 implying that they should not claim credit for their own \nsuccess, since taxpayers (i.e. themselves and other business owners) had \nfunded the national infrastructure.\n\u2022 Insulted the British people by rudely returning to them a bust of \nChurchill which previously had been a ceremonial gift on display at the \nWhite House; when later confronted on this inexplicable action, he lied \nabout it.\n\u2022 Canceled plans to complete a missile defense shield in Poland, a move \nwhich was highly praised by Russia \u2014 the very nation whose missile threat \nwould have been neutralized if the shield had been completed.\n\u2022 By loudly publicizing (for personal political gain) the identity of exact \nSEAL teams who had killed Osama bin Laden, Obama made them a target for \nreprisals by Islamists; a short time later 22 SEALS were shot down and \nkilled in Afghanistan, their worst loss of life ever.\n\u2022 Established an extra-Constitutional top secret \u201ckill list\u201d of people \n(including Americans) Obama claims the right to kill on sight, and then \nbragged about it publicly.\n\u2022 Set up a special email account, \u201cFlag@Whitehouse.gov,\u201d to which Americans \nwere supposed to inform the government of anyone they heard spreading \n\u201cdisinformation\u201d about Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. (This was the first of \nthree different \u201cspy on your friends and neighbors\u201d programs.)\n\u2022 \u201cAttack Watch\u201d was Obama\u2019s second Big Brother attempt, a Web site on \nwhich you would report \u201cattacks\u201d on Obama\u2019s proposals and ideology; it was \nquickly shut down due to outrage and mockery.\n\u2022 Finally, Obama set up the \u201cTruth Team\u201d program which encouraged citizens \nto report to the government any friends or relatives they hear repeating \n\u201clies\u201d about Obama. The Truth Team site still exists.\n\u2022 Twisted the arms of defense contractors to not issue layoff notices in \nearly November, so as to avoid causing bad news for Obama right before the \nelection \u2014 even though federal law (the \u201cWARN Act\u201d) requires such notices.\n\u2022 After the attacks on American interests in North Africa on September 11, \n2012, Obama gave a speech to the U.N. and declared \u201cThe future must not \nbelong to those who slander The Prophet of Islam\u201d \u2014 transferring the blame \nfrom the attackers onto the makers of a film trailer that supposedly \n\u201coffended\u201d the Islamists.\n\u2022 Repeatedly snubbed and got into public tiffs with Benjamin Netanyahu, who \nas the leader of Israel is supposed to be Obama\u2019s closest colleague in \ninternational affairs.\n\u2022 On May 19, 2011, Obama told Israel they must return to the 1967 borders \nas a pre-condition for continuing talks with the Palestinians \u2014 even though \nthe status of the borders was the main issue the talks were supposed to \naddress.\n\u2022 Encouraged politically biased hiring practices in the Justice Department.\n\u2022 Soon after taking office, Obama rescinded the \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d which \npreviously had banned NGOs which are supported by American taxpayer funds \nfrom using those funds to perform abortions in foreign countries.\n\u2022 Attempted to force returning veterans to pay huge increases for their \nhealth coverage\u2026as a way to generate more funding for his Obamacare \nprovisions.\n\u2022 In June of 2011, he anointed his own underage daughters as \u201csenior staff \nmembers\u201d so that their vacation to Africa would be paid for with taxpayer \nmoney.\n\u2022 Interviews with high school classmates revealed that Obama was a heavy \nand frequent user of marijuana in his teenage years (not to mention his \nself-admitted cocaine use in college).\n\u2022 Played over 100 rounds of golf during his first three years in office, \nmeaning that he was on the links close to 10% of the days he has been \npresident.\n\u2022 Voted to allow post-birth abortions (i.e. facilitating the deaths of \nbabies who survive late-term abortions) not just once but three times in a \nrow as an Illinois state senator.\n\u2022 The pastor whom Obama selected to give the national benediction at his \n2009 inauguration recently declared that \u201call white people are going to \nHell.\u201d\n\u2022 Sided with Hugo Chavez and the Castro regime regarding the Honduran \nConstitutional Crisis of 2009, the first time ever that the U.S. formed a \npolitical alliance with socialist governments in Latin America.\n\u2022 Obama Administration OKed the nomination of Chas Freeman to chair the \nNational Intelligence Council (which coordinates intelligence reports from \nall government agencies), despite the fact that he was openly hostile to \nIsrael and strongly favored Arabist goals. (He later withdrew under \npressure.)\n\u2022 Chinese pianist Lang Lang played an offensively anti-American song at a \n2011 White House dinner where Obama hosted Chinese president Hu Jintao, to \nthe delight and amazement of the communist Chinese visitors, while Obama \njust sat there and smiled (the song\u2019s Chinese lyrics describe Americans as \n\u201cwarmongering jackals\u201d).\n\u2022 There was a great deal of (still unverified) suspicion that the company \nLightSquared received favorable treatment from the Obama administration for \napproval of its broadband technology which interfered with the GPS system; \nan Air Force general claimed he was pressured by the Obama administration \nto downplay his criticism of LightSquared\u2019s technology in sworn testimony.\n\u2022 Obama\u2019s Department of Energy awarded $529 million to Fisker Automotive to \nbuild their Karma hybrid electric cars \u2014 even though they are manufactured \nin Finland, cost over $100,000 each, and tend to explode.\n\u2022 When Inspector General Gerald Walpin discovered during a 2009 \ninvestigation that one of Obama\u2019s political allies (the mayor of \nSacramento) was misusing government funds for personal gain, Obama \nunceremoniously fired Walpin \u2014 even though rooting out fraud was the job \ndescription of the Inspector General.\n\u2022 More than once Obama made so-called \u201crecess appointments\u201d when the Senate \nwas not actually in recess, which directly violates Constitutional rules \nabout how appointments must be made; in each case it was his way of getting \nhis political allies into certain key positions without them being vetted \nor approved by the Senate, as required.\n\u2022 After Nidal Malik Hasan massacred 13 people at Fort Hood while shouting \n\u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d so as to become a martyr for Islam, the Obama administration \nrefused to classify his action as \u201cterrorism\u201d and instead deemed it merely \n\u201cworkplace violence.\u201d\n\u2022 Despite the fact that the Falkland Islands have been part of Great \nBritain since 1833 and that Great Britain is supposed to be our strongest \nally, Obama essentially sided with Argentina in its new claim on the \nFalklands, not only by adopting the Argentine position that their status is \nopen to negotiation, but even by (attempting to) refer to the islands by \ntheir Spanish name (Malvinas).\n\u2022 Convened the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform \n(a.k.a. the Simpson-Bowles commission) in order to address a major economic \ncrisis\u2026and then summarily dismissed and ignored their recommendations.\n\u2022 Criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s legal reasoning (about the Citizen\u2019s \nUnited decision) during a State of the Union address, which many considered \na dangerous precedent as it appeared to place political pressure on the \ncourt, violating the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers; but his bullying \nseems to have later paid off, when the Supreme Court apparently altered its \nObamacare decision so as to not ruffle any political feathers.\n\u2022 On April 27, 2009, Obama\u2019s staff (possibly at his direction) ordered Air \nForce One to make an unnecessary very low flight over part of Manhattan and \nthe Statue of Liberty, which many residents mistakenly assumed must be a \nsecond 9/11 attack in progress; turned out that it was just a stunt to get \na photo op of Obama\u2019s plane next to the Statue of Liberty.\n\u2022 Obama somehow managed to insert mentions of himself into the official \nbiographies of earlier presidents on the White House Web site \u2014 even \npresidents from the 19th century. After public outcry, the narcissistic \nObama mentions were quietly removed without comment.\n\u2022 Intentionally misquotes the Declaration of Independence in speeches, \noften leaving out the words \u201cby their Creator\u201d in the famous passage \u201c\u2026are \nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\u201d which Obama \ninstead has recited as \u201c\u2026are endowed with certain unalienable rights.\u201d\n\u2022 In June of 2009, Obama\u2019s Solicitor General (and now Supreme Court \nJustice) Elena Kagan filed a legal brief to prevent the families of 9/11 \nvictims from appealing their lawsuits against the Saudi royal family for \nfinancing the 9/11 attacks.\n\u2022 The 2009 National Christmas Tree in the White House was decorated with \nornaments depicting Chairman Mao, a drag queen, and a picture of Mount \nRushmore that included Obama\u2019s own head next to George Washington\u2019s.\n\u2022 Compelled Catholic and other religious organizations to provide health \nplans with free contraception, even though such requirements violate their \nrights of religious freedom and conscience.\n\u2022 It was revealed only after Obama became president that during the 1990s \nhe was a leading member of the \u201cNew Party,\u201d a socialist-aligned far-left \nradical group in Chicago.\n\u2022 Lied about his close associations with former Weather Underground \nterrorist Bill Ayers; pretended the two barely knew each other, when \nmultiple sources document they were friends and close colleagues for years.\n\u2022 When Obama was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2009, he at first \nflubbed the oath of office, so he had to re-take it behind closed doors for \nhis inauguration to be valid. He did so, but during this second, true \ninauguration in private, he purposely failed to place his hand on a Bible, \nas is traditional \u2014 the first president ever to not swear the oath of \noffice on the Bible.\n\u2022 Obama\u2019s own author bio in his literary agent\u2019s catalog and on their Web \nsite stated for 17 consecutive years that he was born in Kenya; this claim \nremained intact despite other portions of the bio being altered and updated \nrepeatedly. It was only in 2007 after he decided to run for the presidency \nthat the \u201cborn in Kenya\u201d claim was taken down. The original info must \nnecessarily have come from Obama himself; some theorize he likely falsely \nclaimed foreign birth in order to gain admission or scholarships in \ncollege, and never bothered to fix his lie.\n\u2022 After winning the 2008 election but before being sworn in, Obama \nbombastically concocted the official-seeming \u201cOffice of the \nPresident-Elect\u201d as if it was some kind of real government department; in \nfact, it was just a self-congratulatory title he made up to look important \nbefore he actually became president.\n\u2022 Obama administration came up with the bizarre euphemism \u201cman-caused \ndisasters\u201d to describe acts of terrorism \u2014 because he wants to downplay \nterrorism as a significant political issue.\n\u2022 For three years in a row his official budget proposals to Congress \nreceived exactly zero votes \u2014 not even a single vote from Democrats.\n\u2022 Relied on an Islamic fundamentalist militia group called \u201cThe Martyrs of \nthe February the 17th Revolution Brigade\u201d to provide security at the \nAmerican mission in Benghazi \u2014 and they not only failed to prevent the \nattack but perhaps even joined in on it.\n\u2022 During the debate over Obamacare in 2009, Obama bluntly stated that \ndoctors like to perform amputations rather than practice preventive \nmedicine for no other reason than that they make a greater profit from \namputations. The American College of Surgeons demanded an apology, which \nnever arrived.\n\u2022 Since 2008 the Los Angeles Times has been in possession of a videotape \nshowing Obama honoring and praising anti-Western anti-Israel academic \nEdward Said, but they have steadfastly refused to release it to this day, \nfor no discernible reason other than their belief it would damage Obama\u2019s \nreputation.\n\u2022 When the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe recently \nheld a conference on human rights, Obama sent an American representative \u2014 \nSalam al-Marayati, a Truther who blamed Israel for the 9/11 attacks and who \nalso praises Hezbollah and Hamas. To the nations of Europe, al-Marayati \nspoke for all Americans on the topic of human rights.\n\u2022 Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security specifically warned that \nAmericans who are \u201cdedicated to a\nsingle issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration\u201d are potential \nterrorists, as are libertarian-minded voters who \u201cfavor of state or local \nauthority\u201d over centralized power. These \u201crightwing extremists\u201d (who hold \npolitical beliefs shared by a majority of Americans) are deemed a greater \nthreat to the nation than actual revolutionaries or jihadists.\n\u2022 While campaigning in 2008 Obama declared that it was \u201cunpatriotic\u201d that \nBush had increased the national debt at a rate of half a trillion dollars \nper year; but under Obama the rate of national debt increase has \naccelerated to almost three times the Bush rate ($6 trillion in new debt in \nunder four years) \u2014 yet Obama has never apologized nor declared himself \nunpatriotic.\n\u2022 For decades, every president has attended a \u201cdaily intelligence briefing\u201d \nwhich updates him on critical world events each morning. Obama has skipped \n60% of his daily intelligence briefings, including the ones leading up to \nthe attack in Benghazi.\n\nRead more at \nhttp://investmentwatchblog.com/the-complete-list-of-barack-obamas-scandals-misdeeds-crimes-and-blunders/#VdFvQkkqr2ELbyDG.99",
