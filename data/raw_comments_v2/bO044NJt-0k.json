Gay supporters: We all have to understand, that even \nthough gays are supported more, EVERYBODY else doesn't HAVE to support them \ntoo. Let homophobes be homophobes. If they're not killing, or hurting \n(emotionally, physically) anyone because of their sexual orientation, then \nI don't see anything wrong, live and let live. This isn't a religion, do \nnot try to shove you're beliefs down people's throat expecting them to \nchange their minds (pardon me, hehe). This can very easily compare to \nreligion or race. Personally I don't like (insert race here) \nstereotypically, I don't go around telling people \"why do you like them?! \nYou need to stop! Just stop it!\"\n\nNow homophobes: Though I don't understand your \"fear\" of homosexuals, I do \nwant to say this. Like I said before it's like race or religion. If I don't \nlike a certain race I will not go around killing them, hurting them, etc. \nI'll just live my life and let them live their lives. \n\nI don't think it's hard to have peace, even though there are different \nbeliefs. But then again, there are those...extremists..I think they're \ncalled, who believe that only their beliefs should be. We are all different \nthat's okay, don't try to change it to \"we are all the same.\" It's like \nsaying being different is bad, but it isnt. It's when those differences are \nused as a reason to hate one another it turns into something. \n\nNow let's think about that. Hehe this was fun, but peace out!! \u270c\ufeff",
