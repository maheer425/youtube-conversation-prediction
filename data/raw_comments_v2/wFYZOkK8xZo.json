If hair is unhygienic, why do most of you still have eyebrows, \neyelashes, and hair on your scalp? Also, why don't we hold men to the same \nstandard of \"hygiene\"? \n\nThe reason is because it's not an issue of hygiene. It's purely aesthetic. \nIf you wash yourself often (every day for most people in the USA), there is \nnothing unhygienic about your body hair. You are just succumbing to another \nsocial norm like shaping your eyebrows and getting french tips. If you like \nthat sort of thing, great, but please don't make others who don't do those \nthings (because of culture or personal preference) feel dirty because they \ndon't participate.\ufeff",

As an adult, I don't shave, legs or underarms, and it distresses \nher to no end. She calls it filthy and ugly and cries if I go out in public \nwithout being hair free. \nAltering the way your body is naturally is not 'just the way things are' \nthat makes no sense and with a little comprehension and critical thinking \nI'm sure even the worst of you can understand why women who don't shave \n(aka women who just live their lives and are not actively concerned with \nbody hair on a daily basis) are not even making a statement we're just NOT \ndoing something. If you want to shave fine, but recognize why you make the \nchoice to do something to change your appearance and are offended when \nothers don't make the same choice that you do.\ufeff",
