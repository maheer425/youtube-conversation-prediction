The cute \nlittle doodles were very relatable as often boredom causes students to \nbegin drawing mini masterpieces. The video was able to take the Apollonian \nGasket and apply it to infinite series. I had never heard of an Apollonian \nGasket until this video and the concept is neat, and one I will probably \ntry. Circles had always been unique especially in geometry and \ntrigonometry, but the idea that you can create an awesome doodle out of \ntheir properties is fascinating, especially as the example of using \ntriangles fails. However, the triangle example also fits the question of \nthe camel. Thus the idea becomes related to doodling circles with the \nApollonian Gasket. My only confusion is in the concept of infinity. Its \nhard to grasp the idea that you can draw infinite amount of circles, \ntriangles, camels, etc. Overall though, this video was amazing and I \nenjoyed watching it. \ufeff",
