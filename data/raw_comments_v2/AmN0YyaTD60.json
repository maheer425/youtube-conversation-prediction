But I got lucky and there were no mishaps.  I needed \nsome three-sided signs so I could indicate three different statuses \n(stati?).  Most signs have only two sides, and thus can only differentiate \nbetween two stati.  Like a sign in a store window that says \"OPEN\" on one \nside and \"CLOSED\" on the other.  But what if you need to indicate three \ndifferent stati?  Well, you can solve the problem however you like, but I \nchose to use hexaflexagons.  Mine aren't as pretty as Ms. Hart's, but as I \nsaid, they were for a more utilitarian purpose.  What was that purpose? \n Well, it's really not that important and would take to long to explain and \nwould probably completely boring to at least 86.6025404% of you.\ufeff",
