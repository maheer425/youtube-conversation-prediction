Maybe it's hard to follow some references he's throwing \nat you, but his talk makes a lot of sense.\n\nI don't know if I can simplify and convey it, but according to him (maybe \nI'm wrong or he's wrong) TED or society in general, believe that some guys \ncoming up with ideas can just change the world. For example, a guy travels \nto India, sees the shit on streets and decides that people need to be set \nup with portable toilets and Indian sanitation problem (at least this \naspect of it) will be solved. \nBut then it turns out that this doesn't work, because Indian culture says \nthat it's not right to sh** indoors on such a toilet, and when you're \noutdoors, nobody uses the toilets because they can just sh** on the street. \nIt's not that they're dumb people, but their view of the world is \ndifferent. And that's much harder to change than just give them some tech \nsolution. \n\nThe same with drones and automated manufacturing and new technologies... \nPeople think that actually IN CAPITALISM AT ITS CURRENT FORM we'll be \nbetter off with all that, but we won't be. They'll either 1) make us lazy \nand complacent 2) kick us out of our jobs. We need to tear down the old \nsystem, at least question it more, and I also don't know the magic formula, \nbut whatever we have now will not help us to correctly distribute the \nbenefits of information age to everyone. \n\nHe said it correctly- when people on TED talks talk about something they \nhave invented, they usually just brush past any cultural, politic, \neconomic, social etc. implications of it. They just say ''well, it can be \nused both in good and bad way, but I'm sure we'll all be ok, because this \ngives us XYZ etc. benefits''. People hype Google Glass, only to realize \nthat people still want their privacy badly and can even beat you up because \nyou have a camera face. People invent Bitcoin and say ''oh this will change \nthe world'', only to stumble with hacks, thefts and government \nregulation.... \n\nAll the ideas and hard work won't help you, if society is not on the same \npage with you. We co-opt technologies, we don't disclose their and also our \npotential. For example, why the f*** a person living in India cannot access \nthe same Netflix Americans can? Cause society, regulations, distribution of \nrights- it's not a technological problem. It's our problem as society. With \nlots of things, the problem is not our lacking of technology, the problem \nis culture, politics etc. Why Mexico and India are poorer than USA? And do \nyou think that if we teach them code or farm, they'll be better off. Hell \nno! Why? Because centuries of fucked up political and cultural shit, that's \nwhy. There needs to be a cultural shift. If culturally people of those \nplaces changed overnight, they wouldn't need any aid or help from outside, \nthe same for Africa. Transplant any working part of democratic \nparticipatory society in poorest corner of Africa, and if it will not \nthrive, it will at least be the most developed corner in the continent. Not \nbecause racism, but because these people will have completely different \ncultural and political background. I mean, look at Israel and its \nneighbours. It's not that Arabs are worthless people and Jews are just that \ngood. It's also not a religion thing. It's political thing. Fu** up any \nWestern country's political systems enough (increase corruption a few \ntimes, destroy trust to justice system, private property rights and free \ncompetition) and they'll be right where most of Africa is. No drilling of \nwells can help the big picture, if a local villager who sets up his own \nbusiness is shut down and bankrupted because some president's right wing \nman is his competition... Sure it happens in West too, but these are \nexceptional cases, not everyday realities.\n\nThe essence of the long rant is just that THINGS... ARE... COMPLICATED. \ufeff",

The main reason is precisely \nthe whole point of the talk, people need to be pitched a sale.

The problem is 99.999% what gets all the \nattention is pure gibberish hog wash products that have no real value to \nthe poor in the world.

TED is an example of something that once it has a network \neffect, is hard to destroy. TED could really be a platform where people \ncould be able to get the necessary funding to do the dirty work, but \ninstead all the money is going to the Tony Robbins of the world, that do \nabsolutely nothing but inspire pie in the sky thinking. I know some folks \nlove to dream Utopian worlds, but as for me I could careless. I want \nsolutions that work in the real world.

IN \nan effort to \"think outside of the box\" we are still thinking inside of \nthat box. Its funny, but all those supposed innovation is more of the same \njunk.

I \ncalled this talk out as being an idiotic and assholish rant not because I \nwish to defend TED but because the rant is idiotic and the ranter is an \nasshole. Apparently very few people can see the fallacies that saturate \nthis talk, so allow me to enumerate them:\n\n\"Have you ever wondered why so little of the bright futures promised in TED \ntalks actually come true?\"\n\nNo. I haven't. You know why? Because I know that discussing ideas about how \nto change the world is very different to actually changing the world. I \nknow that actually changing the world is a very difficult thing to do, so \nmany of the ideas discussed will ultimately fail. I also know that many TED \ntalks are not about promising a bright future. Some are about music, art \nand entertainment (you know, the 'E' in TED). Some are about discoveries. \nSome are about the problems we face. I also know that many past TED talks \nhave actually come to fruition and changed the world.\n\n\"My TED talk is not about my work\"\n\nThat's a great lie. His talk is almost word-for-word a recitation of an \narticle he wrote called, \"Why TED is a recipe for Civilizational Disaster\". \nThis talk is no different then when Malcolm Gladwell paraphrases what his \nlatest book is about.\n\n\"The first problem is oversimplification. Now, to be clear I have nothing \nagainst the idea of interesting people who do smart things explaining their \nwork in a way that everyone can understand\"\n\nReally? That's interesting because he then goes on to recite an anecdote \nwhere some idiot demands that an astrophysicist explain his work like \nMalcolm Gladwell, but instead of slamming that particular individual as \nbeing one of the many idiots that inhabit this planet, he slams Malcolm \nGladwell who's very job description is \"explain the work of interesting \npeople who do smart things in a way that everyone can understand\". This \nshould be the very first hint that Mr. Bratton is completely full of shit. \nWhat does he even mean by \"a journalist who recycles fake insights\"? Are \nthey recycled because Gladwell didn't conduct the experiments himself? How \nare the insights 'fake'. Let's go on. Maybe Mr. Bratton will explain why he \nresorts to petty name-calling hidden behind flowery language...\n\n\"This is not popularization. This is taking something with substance and \nvalue and coring it out so that it can be swallowed without chewing.\"\n\nThat's just a flowery, cynical description of paraphrasing. Apparently Mr. \nBratton thinks paraphrasing will bring about the downfall of civilization. \nLet's hear him explain why.\n\n\"TED is a proposition. One that says, 'if we talk about world changing \nideas enough then the world will change'\"\n\nWow. I thought this guy was against paraphrasing and 'oversimplification'. \nApparently when it serves the purpose of building a shitty straw man, it's \nOK. I thought he was OK with the goal of letting experts share their ideas \nwith the public, but now it sounds like doing so could end all of \nCivilization. I'm still unclear on how that works, so let's listen on.\n\n\"TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. To me, TED stands \nfor middle-brow, mega-church, infotainment.\"\n\nMore petty name-calling wrapped in hyperbolically cynical language.\n\n\"The key rhetorical device of any TED talk is a combination of epiphany and \npersonal testimony.\"\n\nI can think of dozens of TED talks that don't follow this stereotype (or is \nit an 'oversimplification'), however, if you're going to explain an idea to \npeople, it often helps to relate how you arrived at said idea which often \nreads as personal testimony leading to epiphany. So what's wrong with that?\n\n\"What does the TED audience hope to get from this. A vicarious insight. A \nfleeting moment of wonder. A sense that it's all going to work out after \nall. A spiritual buzz.\"\n\nHere is the set-up to his main argument. A wonderful stereotype of the TED \naudience as a gaggle mindless dullards. Another straw man. Apparently the \nTED audience isn't made up of individuals with their own reasons for \nwatching TED talks. He's enumerated all the possible reasons. I must just \nwatch TED for the spiritual buzz it gives me. Right. What's his evidence \nfor this so far? He once heard an idiot mention Malcolm Gladwell.\n\n\"Well I'm sorry, but that's not up to the challenge of the problems that we \nare ostensibly here to face. Their complex and difficult and not given to \ntidy, just-so solutions. \"\n\nOK. So the goal of 'facilitating the spread of ideas in hopes of bringing \nabout change in the world' has now become 'solve all of the world's \nproblems' and Mr. Bratton is upset because TED is not enough to solve all \nthe world's problems. Is his complaint \"TED is horrible because it won't \nfix the world\"?\n\n\"[the world's problems] are complex and difficult and not given to tidy, \njust-so solutions. They don't care about anyone's experience of optimism.\"\n\nAh, so the real problem goes back to the dummy audience who apparently is \njust in it for the high and doesn't realize there's more to solving \nproblems than just talking about solutions. Stupid audience. What a bunch \nof dummies.\n\n\"Given the stakes, having our best and brightest waste their time and the \naudiences time dancing about like infomercial hosts is too high a price. \nAnd it's cynical\"\n\nSharing ideas in a paraphrased manner is a huge waste of time? Apparently \nif I go to someone with an interesting idea and say, \"do you want to share \nyour thoughts in a concise talk.\" I'm actually asking them to dance about \nlike an infomercial host. Mr. Bratton laughably uses the word 'cynical' to \ndescribe such an act while he himself apparently loves hyperbolic cynicism.\n\n\"Plus it just doesn't work. [tangent about TED discouraging science-woo]. \nThe corollary to placebo science and medicine is placebo politics and \nplacebo innovation, and on this count TED has a ways to go. [gives Konny \n2012 as an example]. You see, when inspiration becomes manipulation, \ninspiration becomes obfuscation. And if you're not cynical, you should be \nskeptical.\"\n\nThis is not an example of TED not working. This is an example of why people \nshould approach new information with skepticism, because TED, like all \nother forums of discussion, is not perfect. So, the real take away of the \nKonny 2012 anecdote is not that TED is fundamentally harmful to society, \nbut that accepting information without critical thinking is a bad idea. \nThat has nothing to do with TED. The only way Mr. Bratton has so far tied \nthat lesson to TED is by building a straw man of both TED and the TED \naudience.\n\n\"Technology: We're told that not only is change accelerating, but the pace \nof change is accelerating. In terms of the computational capacity, this is \ntrue. But at the same time, (and in-fact the two are related) we're at a \nmoment of cultural deceleration. We invest our energies in futuristic \ninformation technology including our cars, yet we drive them home kitch \narchitecture copied from the 18th century.\n\nThe future on offer is one in-which everything can change as long as \neverything stays the same. We'll have google glass but we'll still have \nbusiness casual. \n \nThis timidity is not our path to the future. This is incredibly \nconservative and more gigaflops will not inoculate us because if a problem \nis endemic to the system then the exponential effects of moors law also \namplify the problems. It's more computation along the wrong curve.\"\n\nNo single person or even group of people can offer what Mr. Bratton demands \nof Technology-oriented TED talks. A complete vision of the future including \nall of the social, artistic, and technological changes in one cohesive \nview. Is it surprising that one person talks about the single aspect of \ntechnology that they are focused on and another talks about the work that \nthey are doing without also talking about how 'business casual' and \narchitecture will change. There's a reason society follows the 'timid' \ntrajectory and it's endemic to our limitations as a species. Our inability \nto track every social, political, and technological implication of every \npossible change in trajectory. Moors law is featured in some tech-oriented \nTED talks, but there are plenty that don't. There are plenty that talk \nabout changes in architecture and society that must take place.\n\nI'm bored analyzing this shitty talk. He's mad at TED for not being \nsomething it never purports to be and for his stereotype of the audience \nbeing so stereotypical.",

If he \nis right, why should it matter how it makes you feel?!?\n\nI am often seen as negative because I focus on the things that are wrong \nand on understanding what exactly is wrong with them. What people don't \nseem to get is that, at least for me, the focus on the things that are bad \nstems from a genuine desire to really make things better, not just to feel \ngood for a fleeting moment. I truly believe that it is NECESSARY to really \nput our finger on what is wrong and to ACT in accordance. While I too feel \ninspired and love the feeling of optimism that I get watching TED talks, \nI'll gladly give that up if a less enjoyable conference can achieve more.\n\nLook at the world we live in. We have known for decades about - to name a \nfew! - the massive deforestation, the freshwater problem, the energy \ncrises, the disappearing corals and fish stocks, and the threat of \nresistant bacteria. We have been warned that we're headed straight into a \nwall and had ample time to verify that indeed, it seems we are. But what \nhave we DONE about these things? In every single one of the areas I've \nmentioned, every one of which is hugely important, we are in a worse \nposition now than 30 years ago. Basically we have decided to head faster \nstill towards that wall. \n\nI for one believe that the culture of positivism and using social \nstigmatization to stop people from voicing their concerns, so we don't have \nto feel bad, is the MAIN problem - it is the one common factor that is \nworking against us in dealing with ALL of the absolutely MASSIVE challenges \nwe are facing. There is no way you can know that his saying TED is cynical \nis \"a projection of self-identified traits\". You can disagree, think that \nhe's wrong, and explain to the rest of us what exactly makes him wrong. But \nall you did was knee-jerk react with anger at the man that made you feel \nbad, seemingly without even considering whether he had a point. THAT scares \nme.\ufeff",
