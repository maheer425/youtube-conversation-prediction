When we work \ntogether my children we can avert disasters worldwide.\nNever forget the importance of my most holy Rosary because when you say it \nevery day you can help save your nation.\n\nSatan\u2019s power is weakened when you say my Rosary. He runs away in great \npain and becomes powerless.

Yet, by asking \nfor my help I can bring souls right to the Sacred\nHeart of my Son, Jesus Christ.\n\nMy Son, Jesus Christ, is your saviour children and He will never reject \nsinners no matter how blackened your souls are.\nIf you feel sorry for having offended Him just call out to me your loving \nMother and I will take you by the hand to Him.\n\nMy Son is preparing to come to bring all his children together so you can \nall join with Him in the New Paradise on earth. Only pure and humble souls \ncan enter.\nYou must start your preparations now. Start by reciting my Holy Rosary.\n\nSo important is this prayer that it must now become a Crusade Prayer in its \nown right.\n\nCrusade Prayer (26) \u2013 The Holy Rosary to the Virgin Mary    \n\nFeel the peace children when you meditate on my Rosary.\nAs the graces are poured over you after reciting it you will then know that \nthe deceiver has moved away from you and, in its place, will come love. \nLove comes from my Eternal Father.\n\nWhen you feel love in your hearts you will know that you are winning the \nbattle to defeat the evil one. \n\nYour beloved Queen of the Angels\nMother of Salvation\nDownload \u2013 How to Say The Rosary \u2013 PDF    goto: http://mybookoftruth.com\n\nHow to Pray The Rosary Page\n\nFREE download  SEE here:    \nhttp://mybookoftruth.com/files/book-of-truth-all-messages-and-prayers.pdf\n                                                            +      +\ns's[sp\ufeff",

Cutting taxes down as low as possible, and the size of the \ngovernment to as small as possible, to a size where it can effectively do \nwhat it needs to do, and not give it the power to infringe on freedom with \nover regulating our markets, and lives. Corporatism is where the \ngovernment, through corporate welfare, and giving unnatural power to the \ngiant corporations, allows the corporations to control everything, as we \nsee now, through the government. There will always be corporations, it's a \ngood thing to have successful people and companies, but under capitalism, \nthe government doesn't give the corporations a unnatural power, and boost. \nListen to Ron Paul, he's really good on this topic.\ufeff",

In fact, until around 2005, the only way to run for office, even at \nthe lowest level, was to be a member of the Communist party. However, now, \nyou can even be a candidate against the party and still run for lower level \noffices, such as mayor. The amount of executions in China is also \ndecreasing. Back in the 1990's, China executed around 25,000 people a year \non average. By 2005, it had decreased to around 10,000. Today, the annual \namount of executions is around 2,000. The amount of executions in China has \nbeen falling by around 10% every year for the last several years. In 2006, \nChina even made a law that says that all death sentences have to go before \nthe Supreme Court, and nearly 20% of death sentences that go to the Supreme \nCourt are commuted.\n\nInterestingly, China stopped executing juveniles nearly a decade before the \nUSA did. China stopped executing juveniles around 1997, while the USA only \nstopped executing juveniles in 2004. However, I doubt that China will ever \nbecome \"Western\" in the way we perceive the definition. China, in about \n15-20 years, might become \"Western\" in the sense that some people consider \ncountries like South Korea, Japan and the Philippines to be Western, but I \ndoubt that China will ever get any closer than that. \n\nApparently, a few years ago, the Chinese government has even started a \nprogramme to end homelessness. Their solution is to give a sort of stipend \nfor low level individuals and families, and give them small apartments to \nlive in. Right now, there are millions who live in slum neighbourhoods, but \nthe government is working on a solution for it. Remember too, there are now \nMillennium generation Chinese joining the government, who tend to have a \nmore moderate view on society. They will also likely have an influence on \nchanging the government in China. And while about 75-80% of older Chinese \nstill favours the death penalty in China, most younger Chinese are either \nagainst it altogether, or think that it should be used less frequently.",

If you would look at the USSR when it existed, \nyou will see that even in that \"Union\" the countries were vastly different \nfrom one another.

As the Catholic Church, they're \nsupposed to speak out and say that indeed homosexuality is a sin. \n\"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of \nGod? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor \nadulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality\" 1 Corinthians 6:9\nAnd Jesus in John 2:15 makes a whip and chases the money changers out. I \ndunno how many there were but I'm guessing He was out-numbered, considering \nthe plural and multiple trades.\nJesus wasn't some \"turn the other cheek\" wimp when it came to sin! He was \nvery outspoken against it. As should the Catholic Church be!\nThat, and Christians don't follow the Pope.\nI'm thinking by the very sarcastic tone you had that you may be an \nunbeliever? Jesus Christ can be verified in history. He is the way the \ntruth and the life.\nSure, it's hard to get into heaven when you're rich. That is because you \ngain a love for the world when you have more stuff and you store up \nworthless treasures instead of treasuring the true treasure, the Lord Jesus \nChrist.\n\"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust \ndestroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves \ntreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves \ndo not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart \nwill be also.\" Matthew 6:19-21\nIf your treasure is in this world, you'll perish just like this world is \nbound to.\n\"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the \nfirst earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.\" Revelation 21:1\nI can only present facts, it's the Holy Spirit that convicts and saves, but \nseriously.

They happened, the bible records the history of the \nJews and other nations.\nIt's to be expected, right? We see these things today and sadly people \nstill do them. If I told you that some guy named James Holmes killed a lot \nof people in a movie theater, that's not me endorsing his actions; that's \nme telling you the facts.\nThe bible explicitly says that fornication is forbidden! That's why \nSolomon, David, and Israel of Jeremiah's time were punished severely! Many \npeople died at the hand of God for their unholy acts of murder, rape and \nadultery. Either died or had the sword enter their family but those \nbehaviors are explicitly forbidden.\nGenocide did happen, it was how Israel got into the promised land. It was \nfrom the hand of God, He saw the great wickedness the lands that they were \nabout to go into had committed and it was God's judgment that was declared \nupon them through his people, the Israelis.\nGod also cast fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah for their \nwickedness of sodomy, God does not endorse sin or take it lightly; in the \ncase of the people who inhabited the fertile crescent, God sent people to \ntake them down.\nAs for the dark ages, ignorant Christians did some ignorant things. I can't \nsay that is what true Christians ought to do, we ought to learn more about \nGod and the world around us. I can't make up for what they did, but I can \nsay it was wrong! And so were the Crusades, and so was the Spanish \nInquisition!! When Christians break the word of God they aren't much of a \nChristian, rather the object of God's wrath and boy did it end badly for a \nlot of those people. I mean let's face it, they're an example of why you \noppose Christianity, obviously their actions yield consequence.\n\n+Chilltoad That's true. I don't doubt God's created other inhabitable \nplanets out there. Planets we can't get to so we may as well not concern \nourselves with it at current. Maybe someday we'll be able to explore them, \nbut that day is not today so drop it.\nThere was a worldwide flood, don't you think that messed up the environment \njust a little bit? Scientists are right when they say there was a Pangaea \n(one landmass) even the bible claims that. The flood caused catastrophic \ndamage to the Earth we know and love, that's why people don't live to be \n700 years old anymore; this world is even more broken than it was after God \nhad inflicted a curse on it in Genesis 3.\nGod made the stars and the heavens to declare His majesty, His ultimate \npower! He didn't make them so we could go live there, I'm sure He \nanticipated us wanting to move out of this planet and made it quite \nimpossible for us. Even if we could get light-speed travel it would prove \nuseless cause we wouldn't be able to reach these supposed \"inhabitable \nplanets\" in our lifetime; and considering Revelations doesn't mention \nHumans living on another planet, I don't think we'll ever be able to move \nanywhere else.\nLike I've said before, we live in a fallen world. Yes, there's going to be \nearthquakes; \"We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the \npains of childbirth right up to the present time.\" Romans 8:22 If you fear \nthe uncontrollable Earth, then you do good to fear! For you have little \ninfluence or control; even secular sources say that our sense of control is \nbut an illusion!\n\n\"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather \nfear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\" Matthew 10:28. Do you \nthink this world is all there is? There's a greater promise of Heaven that \nawaits us and God has said it! He is faithful all through eternity! This \nworld is broken! But one day He will renew and make perfect the world once \nmore!\n\n\"The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is \npatient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should \nreach repentance.\"\n2 Peter 3:9",

I will give them a read if you give this a read.\n\nScience can most definitely observe how the Creator works in our world. \nScience uses the fact that our laws of physics and how the world operates \nis unchanging. This is a God-driven principle that God is faithful and \nnever changing, He will always make gravity fall at a rate of 9.8m/s and \nmake the sun rise.\n\nBut can it tell me where gravity comes from? Where does instinct come from? \nHow do the birds know which direction to go according to the stars? How can \nthey swoop down at super fast speeds and pick up food without smashing on \nthe ground successfully? What drives these forces? Simply put, science can \nobserve but it falls short of giving us answers to WHY.\n\nSo, point #2 I'd like to point out. The universe is ever-expanding. It's \nbeen expanding at a steady rate, which is why people think that proves \nthere was a big bang and there will be an expanding and eventually a \ncontracting (probably billions of years after we die supposedly).\n\nI'm not going to go into the big bang but what I will tell you is this: in \n1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding. This was a \nhuge discovery! Now we humans could grasp the fact that the galaxies are \nstretched like a garment. (Source: \nhttp://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929)\n\nBut... There's writers who lived thousands of years before we humans could \nobserve this fact. (you can agree the bible is an ancient manuscript, \ncorrect?)\n\"He alone stretches out the heavens\" Job 9:8\n\"The LORD wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the \nheavens like a tent.\" Psalm 104:2\nAnd many more! If you want to read the list I pulled this from: \nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/nave-html/faithpathh/stretch.html)\n\nBefore Humans had the technology to observe the stars and the workings of \nthe universe, we were told by God how He works! He stretches the heavens \nand the bible declares this thousands of years before we could observe this \nfor ourselves.",

According to the Malachy Prophecy, this is the Last \nPope....THe signs are all here for Christ's second coming. The BIBLE \ndemands us to take note of the \"signs\" of the last days. We have them all : \n\"terrorism, moral corruption, godlessness...\" St. Paul tells us that 2 \nthings must happen first before the end comes: 1. THe Apostasy---that seems \nto be happening everywhere! 2. The Antichrist---He has not made his \nappearance yet, but be certain, he is in the world already.....These 2 \nthings must happen....and we are closer to Christ's second coming now more \nthan ever! MANY of the SAINTS tell us in their prophecies that the CHURCH \nand the WORLD will become one. Bishop SHeen stated that \" the Church will \nsplit into two...\"\nQuote from BISHOP SHEEN:::\n\"The Antichrist will not be so called; otherwise he would have no \nfollowers. He will not wear red tights, nor vomit sulphur, nor carry a \ntrident nor wave an arrowed tail as Mephistopheles in Faust. This \nmasquerade has helped the Devil convince men that he does not exist. When \nno man recognizes, the more power he exercises. God has defined Himsel as \n\"I am Who am,\" and the Devil as \"I am who am not.\"\n    Nowhere in Sacred Scripture do we find warrant for the popular myth of \nthe Devil as a buffoon who is dressed like the first \"red.\" Rather is he \ndescribed as an angel fallen from heaven, as \"the Prince of this world,\" \nwhose business it is to tell us that there is no other world. His logic is \nsimple: if there is no heaven there is no hell; if there is no hell, then \nthere is no sin; if there is no sin, then there is no judge, and if there \nis no judgment then evil is good and good is evil. But above all these \ndescriptions, Our Lord tells us that he will be so much like Himself that \nhe would deceive even the elect--and certainly no devil ever seen in \npicture books could deceive even the elect. How will he come in this new \nage to win followers to his religion?\n    The pre-Communist Russian belief is that he will come disguised as the \nGreat Humanitarian; he will talk peace, prosperity and plenty not as means \nto lead us to God, but as ends in themselves. . . .\n    . . . The third temptation in which Satan asked Christ to adore him and \nall the kingdoms of the world would be His, will become the temptation to \nhave a new religion without a Cross, a liturgy without a world to come, a \nreligion to destroy a religion, or a politics which is a religion--one that \nrenders unto Caesar even the things that are God's.\n    In the midst of all his seeming love for humanity and his glib talk of \nfreedom and equality, he will have one great secret which he will tell to \nno one: he will not believe in God. Because his religion will be \nbrotherhood without the fatherhood of God, he will deceive even the elect. \nHe will set up a counterchurch which will be the ape of the Church, because \nhe, the Devil, is the ape of God. It will have all the notes and \ncharacteristics of the Church, but in reverse and emptied of its divine \ncontent. It will be a mystical body of the Antichrist that will in all \nexternals resemble the mystical body of Christ. . . .\n    . . . But the twentieth century will join the counterchurch because it \nclaims to be infallible when its visible head speaks ex cathedra from \nMoscow on the subject of economics and politics, and as chief shepherd of \nworld communism.\n \n(Fulton J.
