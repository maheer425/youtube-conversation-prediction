It sickens me in \nthe same way his swearing in on MLK's bible sickens me.\n\nThe eminent scholar Cornel West put it best when he referred to Obama as a \n\"Rockefeller Republican in blackface.\" Once the novelty of a biracial \npresident who is an amazing rhetorician wears off, any mildly inquisitive \nperson comes to see that his word means nothing. He is every ounce the \nwarmonger that his predecessors were. He continued the absolute worst of \nthe Bush doctrine and added his own flairs such as the NDAA. Executive \nshredding of our Constitution continues unabated. Indeed, Obama was the one \nwho finally convinced me:  Democrat, Republican -- just two sides of the \nsame corporate-controlled coin. And now a scientific study from Princeton \nproves it: the US is no longer a democracy, it is an oligarchy. And Obama \nis another one of those careerist, power-thirsty loyalists to corporate \ninterests. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI continue to despise the deeply ingrained racism that pervades those \n\"conservative\" elements of society who protested Obama before he even had a \nchance to have a seat in the Oval Office. But I GLADLY take up a place \nbeside them calling for his ouster. He is just as culpable for his \ncriminality as all the white men of the past few decades who preceded him.\ufeff",
