And since Gravity is \ndependent on mass and the Electron and Neutrino are hilariously tiny, that \nleaves the Weak Force. The Weak force is divided into W and Z bosons, the W \nis further divided into +W and -W, which can affect the Flavour, and the Z \nwhich carries Momentum. So in summary, a Neutrino knocks an Electron by \ngetting close enough to exchange a Z boson and transfer momentum, thus \nenergy. Does that help?",

Light \nis an electromagnetic wave, I'm sure you understand that. When light \ntravels through water or glass for example, the electromagnetic wave \nproduces a varying electromagnetic field. This field affects the particles \nin the material ie. making them produce their own varying electromagnetic \nfields. This varying field is what slows the light down. If light \"bounced\" \noff particles as you were suggesting, the light would have a chance to do \nweird things from that collision, internal reflection when it isn't \nexpected to, however, as we know that doesn't occur.

My old friend Professor Vernon Graham, the late-great \nMathematician, though not a professor of Physics by trade, you still need \nto complete his courses to become one. Explained to me while comparing Bach \nto Godel,as I was teaching him Bach theory. In one of his many theorems, \nanything can be explained with simple math equations, (Simple for him \nperhaps,) He showed me that light was not a constant, C, but a variable and \ndoes not = time. The physical laws apply to general relativity as a model, \nbut rather time (physically observed by the human eye), closing speed of 2v \n> c. Example, Times moves much faster at Disney-Land and slows down when \nsitting through a boring lecture, \u201cTime fly\u2019s when having fun.\u201d But the \nproperties of light can be governed the elements of matter. So traveling \nfaster than light, which is not always going to be C = which is 299,792,458 \nm/s (in a vacuum). slowing or accelerating light, or other particles, will \nnot alter time. \n(Example B.) My awesome friend, Physics Professor and Cosmologist, Jo\u00e3o \nMagueijo. \u201cThe key to finding something is knowing how to look for it.\u201d \n Author of \u201cFaster than the speed of light\u201d In his book he demonstrates How \nand Why the commonly accepted model of relativity is wrong because many \nfactors are overlooked to produce theory of special relativity. He says, \n\"The neutrino's been the bad boy of physics and, basically, putting \nphysicists out of their comfort zone. A lot of unusual things have been \nrevealed by the neutrino.\" Check out his lectures, his accent is heavy but \nhis knowledge is immense\u2026 as well as entertaining. \n (Example C)  (Conversations about Science with Theoretical Physicist Matt \nStrassler) Thousands of trillions of neutrinos passed through several \nneutrino detectors on earth, and of these a tiny handful \u2014 about two dozen \n\u2014 hit something on their way through.  These collisions were recorded over \na period of about 13 seconds. No one was paying particular attention at the \nmoment that this occurred, but after the supernova was noticed, \nexperimental physicists went back and found this flurry of neutrino \ncollisions in their data.  The flurry occurred about 20 hours before the \nfirst observation of the unexpected star in the Large Magellanic Cloud. \n This discovery represented the birth of neutrino astronomy, now an active \nfield of research.  Meanwhile, a look back at older photographs revealed \none showing visible light from the supernova that was taken only 3 hours \nafter the neutrinos had arrived on earth. Since the shock wave from the \nsupernova blast had to make its way out of the exploding star before the \ndebris could begin to shine, whereas the neutrinos from the explosion could \nsail right through the star unimpeded, a delay of a few hours between the \narrival of the neutrinos and the arrival of the light was expected.\n(References) Fernando Ferroni, president of the Italian Institute for \nNuclear Physics.

Like I said, I write as a ghost writer for some of \nthe greatest scientific minds of our time, they come to me for my \nperception in the art of writing. But divulging their names would go \nagainst my code of ethics, which they confide in me. But if you wish to \ndiscus this in private, outside of an audience, I will happily give you \nreferences, and share information that will freak you right the fuck out. \nBut you chose the route of trying your hardest to disrespect and discredit \nme so therefor I retract my offer. I thought you had potential but I now \nrealize that you are only perusing this conversation to establish yourself \nas a grand know-it all. Swallow your pride kid and stop acting like a punk. \nI have interviewed scientists from Kaiser Wilhelm Society to cold war \nphysicists who worked of top secret military operations all around the \nworld. I have sat and discussed things with people you only read about in \nsci-fi magazines. I try to share my knowledge with young aspiring \nscientists who I feel have potential of carrying out their work, I thought \nyou had that potential. But I was wrong, your just a smart ass punk trying \nto impress your friends. I am a collector of knowledge, I don't have long \nto live in this world and I intend to share certain things with people I \nfeel are worthy. You disappointed me. I still think you have that \npotential, but your skepticism is all to common for a kid your age. \nRemember that things are not always as they appear, and don't believe \neverything you read, and your future will be unlimited. Or you can just \ninsult me and think of me as some old fool who knows not what I say. But \nthat's totally your lose. There are many others Id rather discuss the \nsecrets of life with. I cant understand how you could let your immense ego \ninterfere with reality, its frightening to think of you as someones teacher \nsome day. Its like arguing with a 3 year old, you explain where to poop \ngoes when you flush the toilet but it just freaks them out and they keep \nasking why? why? over and over again. Its redundant. So consider this \nconversation over, you simply refuse to step outside of your bubble.  And \nthat's sad. And please don't take it personally, Its just the way you are \nfor now, and I'm shore that you will change as you grow older and wiser and \nrealize that not only does life itself change, but science and theorems \nchange as well because we are constantly learning new things and developing \nthe technology to discover the truth about what we thought we new. It is \nabsolute ignorance that I have no tolerance for, I'm not calling you \nignorant, so don't get defensive. In fact I'd rather extend an olive branch \nby referring to you as a very bright you man, with the potential to become \nsomeone great, someday, but just not now. I know this message is long, but \nas I said before, I love to write, which is why people seek me out to write \ntheists and essays and articles for them because I can make it a little \nmore interesting. Which makes them look better. Perhaps you would someday \nutilize my services, if you could only develop a more serious attitude \ntoward your contributions. In my line of work I get to meet the most \nincredible people, I would never disrespect them to try and make myself \nlook superior in front of others, that would be absolutely incomprehensible \nby any standard. You currently lack the maturity to consent to my \nexplanation of things, but perhaps you may read about it tomorrow in one of \nmany journals of medicine and/or science. And then you'll say that its true \nbecause you read it in a scientific news print. And though my true name may \nnot be associated with it, due to the fact I write under pen names, \ndepending on the subject, as most authors do, you will finally see the \nlight. I can not continue these discussions any more with you because its \nbecoming redundant, you ask me a question, I give you an answer, and you \nre-ask the same question. Its tiring.  I've said all that I can and I hope \nthat it soon sinks into your resilient bubble. I'm not tying to present my \nself as a super intellect, only a vesicle or clear voice for those who are. \nSo anyway, as this conversation began, as I recall, read my latest novel \nManner of the Sundog, and embrace it. I think you will enjoy it. It may \ntake some time to perceive but I have enlightened you, contrary to your \nnext reply, and I will smile when I see that in you.

My only \ndesire is to share that with aspiring scientists, but I learned that you \ntube and Google is not the place to do that, because there is always some \nwanna-be know-it-all who has to challenge what is real with his presumed \nassumption of what he/she learned somewhere in a high school classroom. As \nyou said if previous conversation, you are no expert, neither am I, but I \nhave learned from experts with first hand knowledge. I am only trying to \neducate people with the latest innovations and discoveries of science, \nmedicine, paleontology and politics. That is what I have spent decades \ndoing. And why the experts call on me to write about their theories and \ndiscovery of scientifically proven facts. You however are just trying from \nall sorts of angles to somehow discredit me, for shits and giggles. But as \nI said, and this is a fact. If you are indeed serious about learning what \nmany others cant even fathom, than please go back and re-read what I told \nyou, investigate for yourself before replying with some juvenile smart ass \nantidote. Because in the long run, you'll only discredit your self. I only \nwrite and teach what is fact, and the idea of some you tube blogging smart \nass who has to get the last word to appease his own superiority complex is \nbeyond comprehension. I've seen the fact, the data, the research results \nand watched them repeated before my own eyes, and what I saw was real. I \nthought it impossible myself at first but I was amazed at seeing it with my \nown eyes. As you will too some day. Now I wish not to continue this mundane \nargument with someone who refuses to believe the truth. Its like arguing \nevolution with the creationist religious fanatics. I'm only gonna say it \nonce more for the intelligent people. Despite what you have learned in you \nout dated high school text books. There is a new speed king in town, and it \nis called a neutrino. Please indulge yourself in the applications of \nquantum physics to understand this. (That ONE guy excluded). who continues \nto hold onto early 19th century ideology of outdated science. And refuses \nto believe the earth is round, or the earth orbits the sun. Now I know your \njust gonna ask again, where did I get my facts? why do I think I'm so \nsuperior in my knowledge?  But I have told you already, but its not that \nyou don't understand, its that you don't wanna admit that you understand. \nThe future grestly depends on the learning of new information in order to \nproceed with a higher understanding of how the universe works and what more \nwe can understand. I hope the young minds of this generation will \ncomprehend the idea that science is not written in stone, but we learn new \nthings everyday. And I will try to keep you informed, regardless of what \nsome ego-eccentric sanctimonious kid, who refuses to keep up with modern \nscience has to say.",

I have some background in \nquantum mechanics, multivariable calculus, a little tensor analysis, and \nsome general relativity, but I am by no means an expert on any of it. I \nasked you where you got your information and why you thought that so that \nyou could walk me through it and we could have a conversation about it but \nyou're not in the mood for that apparently. Neutrinos do have a mass, which \nis why they can not move faster than the speed of light. I have no clue \nwhere you heard otherwise but that's a simple fact. Neutrinos can move \nfaster than light in a specific medium, yes. This is because of when the \nbeam of light enters the medium it can be said that it is carried by a \npolariton instead of a photon, and this polariton causes the light itself \nto travel slower in the medium. A neutrino will not interact with the \nmedium very much, and therefor travel though the medium faster than the \npolariton, producing Cherenkov radiation. this does not however mean that \nthe neutron is moving faster than light does in a vacuum. In the sun, \nnuclear fusion occurs in the core which creates light and neutrinos. these \nneutrinos do not interact with matter very much and reach Earth in just a \nfew minutes. The light emitted at the same time as the neutrino interacts \nwith the matter, and therefore takes longer to reach the surface of the Sun \nbut once there they propagate at the speed of light. I feel like those are \nthe two things you are confusing for neutrinos being able to propagate at \nand past the speed of light. If you're ever interested in learning some \nfactual information just let me know and I'd be happy to walk you through \nit. Maybe one day you could stop acting like you're smarter than everybody \nbecause you believe in pseudoscience and you could teach someone something \nfactual.\ufeff And stop asking people to email you.",
