(Soccer Mom Trucks) You can get them fairly cheap and they to make \ngood off road vehicles,  I picked up a 2005 with 170,000+ miles that had \nnever been off road as I could tell.  Installed a quick lift kit all 4 \ncorners, 265 70R 17's buckshot mudders, front tow hooks, and have been \nusing it  driving around the farms, and off road in field roads, trails, \ncreek crossing, up and down hills, etc.  We don't have the mountains but we \ndo have some pretty hairy trails.  And our mud does get very very slick, \nand deep. Mine has a 5 speed automatic, would love to have found a 5 speed \nstandard, but they are far and few between.  The 4L has lots of power, and \ndoes very well in low range.  The 4.6L would be a beast.  Do a late model, \nhigh milage  FORD Explorer, and even a Chevy Blazer.
