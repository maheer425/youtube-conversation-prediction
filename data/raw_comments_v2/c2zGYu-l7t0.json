Met a LOT \nof Swedes (SKOL Tami faarn!!!- or however you spell it-) in Australia of \nall places and I;m just dying to get up and see that part of the world.\n\nThe studs are likely Ti for not only were resistance compared to \"civvy\" \nAlu studs, but for corrosion resistance when they;re drying out too (not \nimaging they use much salt on the roads but who knows) and the tire tread \ndesign is a HUGE factor too, those \"voids\" that he's asking about eject \nsnow and don't pack up.  I'm inter rested to hear his say \"they're too \nwide\" though as they look fairly narrow which is what you want for everyday \ndriving in normal conditions to get the tires down to something to bit on. \n WIDE tires are really only good for float and taking PSI off the contact \npatch (in the snow and mud).  It;s funny cause a LOT of the same tech goes \ninto making good muddng tires for 4wd's where collection of the mod on the \ntread block means reduced traction.  The long \"channels\" he's talking about \nare to clear standing water and snow from he contact surface of those \n\"alternating\" tread blocks.\n\nAll season (read heavily sipped) \"winter\" tires alone do SO MUCH for a car \nin the snow as well as tire compound that I wasn't surprised when he \npointed out the truly \"magical\" tires as it were..  My \"Rally-prep \ninspired\" Fox Wolfsburg took me up and down Mt. hood for 2 years of \"ski \nbum\" life/work and were almost better then when I put on chains in terms of \ngrip and control.  That little FWD VW did better then most 4wds on the \nhill, largely down to driver confidence, but it was just magical with those \ntires on it... \ufeff",
