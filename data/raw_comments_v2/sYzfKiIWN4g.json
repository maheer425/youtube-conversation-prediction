Vatican City citizens (not sure if there's a denonym for \nthat) still use Latin, but even if they got rid of it as an official \nlanguage, studying Latin allows historians to continue to uncovering \nhistory of Ancient Rome. Western countries such as the United States, \nUnited Kingdom, and the majority of the European Union get the structure of \ntheir government, symbolism, and language directly and indirectly from the \nRoman Empire and Latin Language.\n\nLatin has also been used in media and pop culture - for example, Pink Floyd \ndid a dark side of the moon concert in Latin before, social media websites \nlike Facebook offer Latin as a language to use the website in, highly \nsuccessful video games like \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"The Binding of Isaac: \nRebirth\" have songs with Latin lyrics.\n\nThere's a lot you can do with Latin. The first, of course, being that you \ncan speak it, you can use it to study history or progress organization in \nscience, you can also study it to include it in media, and you can also \nstudy it to build a foundation for learning the five languages that stemmed \ndirectly from it, as well as getting a better understanding of English \nwhich indirectly comes from Latin.\n\nAs a Latin Scholar, I can safely say that you also will learn a lot of \nhistory, as well as ancient religion/mythology from learning it. That being \nsaid, it is an elective, so if Latin is not your cup of tea, don't take it, \nbut it certainly is worth being provided as an option.\n\nOf course you can't make as much use out of it as you could Spanish if \nyou're looking to be bilingual. Spanish is a very dominant language in the \nworld. The reasons that motivate people like myself to study Latin are a \nlittle different, but these reasons are certainly not nonexistent.",

The Incas developed a very interesting system of knots for \nmathematical operations and possibly for some kind of record-keeping. When \nColumbus found the American continent, there were native cities bigger than \nMilan, Madrid, Lisboa or other big cities in Europe(both continentes, \nhowever, were vastly dwarfed by China at the time, that was a bastion of \ntechnological development through much of history while Europe was busy in \na cultural mosh-pit of frenzied killing and raping).\nWhat did the tribals do with their discovery? Well, they, huh, populated \nit? There is evidence that in less than a 1000 years they spread over \n13.000 kilometers from Northern Montana, just south of the Ice Sheets \ncovering Canada at the time, to the tip of Patagonia, at the other side of \nthe globe. They formed actual complex societies, trade routes, developed \nagriculture not one but two and possibly three times independently(if you \nwant to know, once in the Mississipi valley, once in Mexico and possibly \nbut still debatably in the Amazon valley; compare that to *no* times \nagriculture was discovered in Europe: it was actually first developed in \nthe Middle East and other parts of Eastern Asia, such as Anatolia and \nEgypt, then later independently created in China, then still later on \nindependently in Papua New Guinea and possibly twice but certainly once in \nSub-Saharan Africa), they had advanced engineering, mathematics and \nastronomy. You make them out to be a bunch of rock-banging barbarians that \ndeserved to be \"civilized\", when they were not.\n\nAnd lastly, about the vikings. Their colonization was not widespread \nbecause there was one giant bottleneck between their relatively poor \nkingdoms in Scandinavia and Iceland, and the Americas: Greenland. It was \nhard to navigate near Greenland, when it was possible at all, the \nagriculture there was utter shite so it couldn't sustain a big population, \ntrading trips from Iceland and Norway were pretty rare so they needed to \nmake do with what they had(and even then a big part of it was sent to \nEurope, mainly walrus tusks and bear skins, to be traded for gold), and \neven without those factors Iceland was pretty damn isolated from the rest \nof Europe. They just didn't have a whole lot of casual contact with anyone \nnot from Norway, so that's why word didn't spread. They didn't have the \nmoney, the people or the time to do it. To add insult to injury, the \nnatives they found there were either hostile like in Greenland, or just \nplain disinterested in the vikings.",
