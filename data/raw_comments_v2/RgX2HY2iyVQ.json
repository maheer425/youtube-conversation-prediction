I am a huge fan..\n\nAt first I was annoyed because I am very small and petite so I felt like \nAmy was making jokes only at the expense of thin and \"pretty\" girls. No one \nshould be targeted as the expense of a negative joke whether FAT or SKINNY \nor YOUNG or OLD or whatever. \n\nBUT  I am also very sarcastic like Amy so I understand that her jokes about \nbeing heavier in LA vs being small are just jokes (with real premise).\n\nI am tiny (5.1) and forever anxious about my height and always wearing \nheels, but I never used to take it seriously when anyone bigger had self \nimage issues.  LIKE: who cares if you're bigger at least you are taller \nthan me!\n\nSize for any woman is a huge concern in today's society thanks to high body \nimage pressure and standards, but hopefully the movement towards healthy \nand fit instead of skinny will overcome these issues.\n\nAmy is so funny and real about female insecurity in today's business and \nsocial environments and I cannot wait to see what she has to say next!\ufeff",
