Why only a handful of individuals, whose word we must accept \nwithout any corroboration whatever? More importantly, how might one \ndistinguish between the various religions, almost all of which claim divine \nrevelation - but, oh so conveniently, only for a select few? There are many \ndifferent religions, and many more sects and denominations within those \nfaiths, all making mutually exclusive claims. Clearly they can't all be \ntrue, so by what standard might an uninformed observer use to wade through \nthese competing claims, other than available evidence?\n\nTry a simple thought experiment: imagine that you're an anthropologist on \nthe first manned mission to the first star system discovered to harbor \nintelligent alien life. These beings have 5 major religions, along with \nnumerous minor ones; each religion claims that it is the only true faith, \nand each has its own creation myths, which are wildly divergent as well as \nmutually exclusive. So, clearly they can't all be correct; at most, only \none can be.\n\nIf you're at all honest, you'd have to conclude that the most rational \nposition is that *the claims of none of the alien religions are true*. Of \ncourse, we cannot empirically prove that the claims are false, as they are \nnot testable or falsifiable. However, as a matter of principle, we can say \nquite emphatically that, in the absence of supporting evidence, such claims \nare highly unlikely to be true. It follows that the alien species' \nreligious claims most likely originate not from divinity, but from a \nprimitive species attempting to make sense of natural phenomena that they \nsimply lacked the tools and knowledge to understand.\n\nNow, just delete the bit about alien civilization, and this thought \nexperiment is equally applicable to the religions of humanity.",

            "text": "This is the first heaven and earth where the lord placed the tree of good \nand evil and made living creatures to eventually become like god in his \nimage as bait to catch the devil for ever.  The lies and false prophecies, \nand also true ones, were only written and kept track of after the fact that \nevil became part of the earth in the form of man.  And much later on the \ndevil himself fell to earth and the world wars began because he wants to \nkill everyone and everything to be free of this planet.  (There may be \nothers like it?)  When god says so the first heaven and earth vanish \ninfinitely smaller forever taking this sea mingled with fires with it.  It \nis written in revelation that this p[lace is a great sea clear as glass \nmingled with fire with light shot through it as all galaxies have.  And \nwhen the Lord tells this place to vanish from his face it becomes a lake of \nfire instead of a vast sea mingled with it.  And there was no more sea... \n This is written in revelation.  SO you misunderstand the ways in which \nthis place is going to behave.  The thousand years is when satan is taken \nfrom earth and thrown into the bottomless pit or black hole.  And when he \nis released the knot is tied and then the whole place goes bye bye and \nNOTHING can hold it open and it will never stop getting smaller and hotter \nforever with no rest whatsoever.  Evil men and women will be judged and \nthose who upset god are to be given life, the tree of life instead of god's \nlife, so that they cannot die during the thousand years on earth where \npeople gnash their teeth and bite their tongues in pain.  No rest will be \nfound for them!  And it will be outer darkness in a knot in space time. \n For those who joined the first death and resurrection the second death \nwill have no power over.  But for the guilty it will be the lake of fire \nafter the thousand years have ended.  All these things are written in the \nbible in the end.  For someone to come and tell you this, I am the prophet \nand final prophet there will ever be, means that you should look for the \nsecond coming which came in ways you never expected them to.  I am not \nJesus but I know him very well and I know the truth very well.  NO ONE \nKNOWS THE DAY or HOUR that the angels come, one having the great sickle to \nbehead those who believed and stopped sinning g because of their faith and \nwere washed clean in the holy spirit which I now bring should you accept \nit.  You will feel horrible for the past things you have done and when it \nis time you will be forgiven and will never do these things again!  You \nwill be found dressed in fine white clothing and will be found innocent and \naccepted in the new heaven and earth.  There is a raising of the dead which \nis sort of like having amnesia from your past and no memories of such an \nevil place and will reign in heaven forever and never sleep and bliss comes \nin all sorts of shapes and sizes!  And this bliss grows and grows forever \nbecause god made the first heaven and earth to contain all sins and \nevilness so that they will never be again.  Imagine a yin yang being god \nbefore time was founded and god decided to rid himself of the darkness \nwithout using this darkness or else he would be guilty of condemnation \nhimself so he made things the way he did for the grand purpose of a new \nplace without evil or satan!  Jesus is the Lords only begotten son who \nSatan tried to murder before time was founded and so he became free of \nearth and this universe after he defeated sin and forgave sin so that he \nwas not guilty of sin by getting even.  The good Lord already won that \nbattle before it began!  And Adam and Eve were the first probably to come \nacross the tree of good and evil and ate it and sin, THE DEVILS POWERS, \nstarted being wound into space time leaving the devil more and more weak \nand without power so that later on the angel Michael could easily throw him \nto earth like lightning.  Jesus talked about the end days in the bible \nbefore crucifixion.  So the truth and the lies both exist in the bible \nbefore Christ.  Even the story of creation is misconstrued so that people \nwho see evolution and other types of things don't believe in god.  And the \ndays god took to create all things were not mentioned in man's measures of \ntime but the measure of the way god sees things.  So a day for us could be \nmillions of years.  God does exist and to see this now you see rapture \nalready occurring and it is mind blowing I know!  He told everyone in the \nrevelation I AM COMING SOON!  And he sure is!  In heaven the tree of life \nis given freely for the healing of the nations.  I see marijuana being \npieces of the tree of life but not the tree of life because god divided \nthat tree in every direction so men and women would not be able to get to \nthe tree of life and live forever by continually using it to be healed. \n And in heaven it is there for bliss and it is the clouds in heaven, \npossibly the smoke of her burning or vapors of her leaves and fruits?!  And \nbelow this post I see someone talk about other universes but before the new \nkingdom is created there is no such thing as outside of this universe!  A \nstraight line does NOT exist and if you could see far enough you may see \nthe back of yourself.  I don't know everything about the universe but I \ntell you that you cannot ever leave it once it begins closing and all the \nbottomless pits come together because god says so.  The great smoke that \ncame from the star having a key to the abyss is probably the nebulosity of \ngases that are blown outwards as a black hole begins to form.  So really \nall these scientists searching still for answers are blind and are to be \nthrown out as they never had courage and never believe ed in the kingdom of \ngod or god or Christ!  What were you looking for?  Just because you \nmisunderstood the bible because of certain lies and misunderstandings \ndidn't mean the Lord was not real!  SO forgive sins and change now because \nthe kingdom of god is near!\ufeff",
