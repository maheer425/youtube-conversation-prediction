For \na full scene with the entire family at dinner, he would place Tennis Balls \non sticks and raise them at head level. Placing one of them at a time on \neach spot where each member of the family sit in. He would then dress up as \none of them at a time and look at each tennis ball stick as if he were \nlooking at Cletus or Granny and say the lines he's supposed to say, then \nfinish the pattern until all klumps are accounted for. Each individual \nscene was then put into the computer and with the effects software they had \nat the time and simply cut and paste each one and edit it so the timing was \nright between them. In the first movie whenever one was talking to the \nother and both had to be present, a body double was used whenever one's \nface had to not be shown. The only thing I don't know is how the hell they \nmanaged to pass food to one and other in the scenes where all faces were \nshown.",
