So much more i could remember about the \ngame, one day i just want to start up my old account and see what i had in \nmy bags and remember the things i was doing on my twink and 45 night elf \ndruid.\n\nThis game is literally the best game in my life, i will play it until the \nday it ends and play the next warcraft game to come.\ufeff",
