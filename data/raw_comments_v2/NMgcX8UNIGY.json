I mean don't get me wrong we \nare very smart in the modern world but we still question reality!! Did u \nknow that a group of scientists successfully teleported some particles?? \nDon't believe me? Look it up!! Science is on the brink of discovering \nsomething big!! Energy is everywhere and we just skip it as nothing that \nconnects with us!!! Here's a good way of explaining my theory!! If you take \nan atom and break it in half it would still be connected through energy!! \nThis has been proven!!! This is the same with hole atoms!! All of them are \nconnected with us and energy!! So if we could just move these energy \nparticles in a way that we wanted to?... Then we could push or pull an \nobject!! It's not magic at all!! It's just the connection and use of \nenergy!! Another cool FACT is that when these scientists teleported these \nparticles they thought to them selves what was stopping them doing it on a \nbigger scale!! We'll nothing!! In fact there is no law of physics stoping a \nperson breaking down into atoms and we'll teleporting!! There's a big \ntheory with facts that u can read up on which explains this in better \ndetail!! But telekinesis is possible!! And anyone can do it!! Again if u \nthink about it there is no law of physics stopping someone using energy \nparticles to there advantage!!! Just look this stuff up before trying to \nmake a vid like this!!!!!!!\ufeff",
