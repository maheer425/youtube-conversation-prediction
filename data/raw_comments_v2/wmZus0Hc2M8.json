            "text": "So, that's what a dumb list looks like!\n\nHere's a real list:\n* Gas goes \"bad\" after a while.  It's good to run your car through most of \nyour gas once every couple of months.  Do this by knowing how much fuel \nyour tank holds (which most people do not know) and occasionally make sure \nthat when you refill there is 1/4 gallon or less fuel in the car.  There's \nno need to run yourself totally out of gas to make this happen.  As you get \nmore familiar with your car you'll get better and better about gauging when \nthis happens.\n\n* Higher octane than recommended by the car manual doesn't do anything for \nyour car or increase fuel economy.  Your car requires a certain minimal \namount of octane to prevent engine knocking (which happens when fuel \nignites at unintended times during the 4 stroke phases).  If you meet that \nminimum octane you're fine.\n\n* Accelerating rapidly is one of the worst things you can do for your fuel \neconomy.  Make a point of accelerating a little more slowly, and if you \nhave a manual transmission, shift gears earlier in the rev range.  Do this \nand you'll notice a significant improvement in fuel economy with any kind \nof stop and go driving.\n\n* Maintaining a high rate of speed is another of the worst things you can \ndo for your fuel economy.  The aerodynamics of your car make it function \nlike a plow moving aside air.  The faster the car is moving the more fuel \nit will require to push all of that air out of the way.  As an example \ndriving a 2014 Toyota Camry at 75 is like paying 15% more for each gallon \nof gas instead of driving that same car at 65.  A more aerodynamic car (in \ncar stats it's referred to as Cd) will burn less extra fuel for traveling \nat similar speeds.\n\n* Leaving a truck bed door down makes a truck less aerodynamic.  Placing a \ncover over the bed is one of the best ways to improve a truck's \naerodynamics.\n\n* Oversteer is when you try to turn a car and the rear of the car breaks \nloose and slides out in the turn.  In effect the car will turn/rotate more \nthan intended.  \n\n* Understeer is when you try to turn a car and the front fails to turn as \nmuch as you intended.  In effect the car will turn/rotate less than you \nintended.\n\n* The majority of a car's ability to brake comes from the front tires.  If \nyour front tires lock up you're losing traction and your ability to brake \ndecreases.  This will also mean that under heavy braking you will have less \nability to turn because you're diverting traction to slowing the car and \nhave less traction to divert to turning the car.  This means if you want to \navoid an accident locking your brakes and turning your wheel will leave you \ngoing in a straight line and braking poorly.\n\n* Unless you have a car that is track ready from the manufacturer your \nspoiler is just for looks.  Of the spoilers that are functional, most \nspoilers don't provide and significant down force until at high speed (a \n2004 WRX STi spoiler provides about 60 pounds of downforce at about 100mph \n- so most major car audio systems will technically provide more downforce \nthan even most functional spoilers).  Some race cars produce enough \ndownforce to effectively drive upside down (because the air moving over the \ncar exerts more force than the gravitational pull of the planet). \n\n* Not placing your seat belt in your lap properly in a major cause of \nprolapsed rectums in car accidents.  Yeah, have fun looking that up.\ufeff",

Almost every car has this option on the \nkey fob so you can do it while walking to your car. Even in very low wind \nthe car is cooled faster than flapping the door. If there is no wind, let \nit 30 sec with windows open, get in and just drive with them open for 1-2 \nminutes, the best part is that you can start the A/C during this time, and \nby the time you close the windows the A/C is already cooling.\n\nRemember: A/C System on every car works way better when the car is moving \nbecause the radiator is cooled better by natural airflow than by the fans \nit is supplied with.\ufeff",
