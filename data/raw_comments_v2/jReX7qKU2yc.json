I have made few analogies that fit so \nperfectly for a claim so difficult to support.\n\n\"can you not imagine that science is rediscovering and renaming these \nphenomenon that ancient Israelites labelled as gods and elohim (think of \nthe fundamental forces)\" When Theists do not understand a particular \nphenomenon they say God did it, when Atheists do not understand it they say \nit is fundamental. This does not mean God does not exist just as it does \nnot mean there is nothing fundamental. It is also the composition fallacy \nto think that since there are things that were first thought to be miracles \nthat are now known not to be, that therefore all things are not miracles. I \ndo not think the discovery of laws rules out God, rather that it suggests \ningenious order. When I was fourteen I asked myself \"Why did God create the \nuniverse over seven days? Surely he could have done it instantaneously\" At \nthat time I played a game called minecraft where you can go mining and then \nusing that stone to build stuff. On it, I built a castle that required \n50,000 stone and took two weeks to build (I spent all day on it) and once I \nhad finished it was very rewarding. A few months later they released \ncreative mode, a mode that gave you an infinite amount of stone and other \nresources. However when I created buildings on it, It was not rewarding as \nit became too easy and I chose to use the other mode instead. From this I \nrealized that this was why God didn't create the universe instantaneously, \nhe chose to do it the long way, following the laws he had created. For \nexample when he created Adam and Eve he did not create them from nothing, \nhe used dust, converting every atom to carbon and rearranging the atoms to \ncreate every complex structure of the body. He decided to create these \nthings in an orderly fashion. Then when I was seventeen I thought back to \nthat idea and asked \"If God chose to create the universe in an orderly way, \ndid he also choose to create the laws in a orderly way?\" From this I \npostulated that the laws are based on intuitive principles that are most \nlikely simple. When learning about the four fundamental forces I assumed \nthey were different manifests of the same thing before I even heard of \nunified field theory. I think almost all laws are related and the \nrelationships between them will be so ingenious that it will be what \nmathematicians think of whilst masturbating. I also think this ingenious \norder will be true with the designs of organisms. From an evolutionary \nperspective we would expect life to be simpler than first thought, from a \ncreation perspective we would expect life to be more complex than first \nthought, so complex that you would think such design would require the \nengineering of - quite literally - a god. This one theological argument is \nthe butterfly effect of my life, my interest in philosophy has now extended \nto theoretical physics. I now spend an abnormal amount of hours each day \nthinking of hypotheses (Admittedly, this also includes morality and \ntheology) and aim to become a Theoretical Physicist.\n\n\"Look at all ancient cultures, they had a similar narrative\" From a \nbiblical world view these cultures have these gods because the original \nstory got mythologized after the tower of babel (that is, after the \nconfusion of languages and God's command for people to migrate the earth \nwhich I will talk about when I create the next message) a bit like a game \nof telephone. However, there is also a possibility that its origin is from \npeople deciding to worship other gods. We cannot know so its pure \nspeculation.\n\n\"Yet these archetypical stories are so universal that one can't possibly, \nlogically say that any scripture has the authentic \"written from the hand\" \nprint of the word of the one.\" The difference between Abraham's trio and \nother religions is that they were created through visions. In those cases \neach testimony is equally valid. However the bible can be \nvalidated/invalidate through its recording of historical events and people. \nAs mentioned before there are legends of a global flood all over the world. \nThere are also a few legends that are similar to Adam and Eve and the tower \nof babel (I will give specific examples when I get to those points of the \ntimeline). There have been many times archaeologists will accuse the bible \nof mentioning a city that doesn't exist and then that city is later \ndiscovered (this also happens with people mentioned in the bible). Also \neven if Christianity was based on visions I could still believe it to be \ntrue because I have been healed before. One night I woke up extremely sick, \nI called out to my mum but I was so worried I would vomit that it was \nmerely a whisper. My dad came instead and prayed for me. As he prayed he \nspoke in tongues and as soon as he spoke tongues the sickness vanished. It \nwasn't just kind of gone either, it was completely gone. Most Atheists I \ntalk to who aren't retarded (the ones that are retarded say it went away \ncoincidentally the moment my dad spoke in tongues) argue that it was the \nplacebo effect that made it go away. I think this is a fair argument, \nhowever the placebo effect has not been shown to work instantaneously and I \ndid not think I would be healed either and the placebo effect requires you \nto believe the claimed outcome.\n\n\"Science is trying its best to find the unmolested truth, evolution is a \nproduct of that effort.\" *Evolution is an interpretation of the science. \nDubstep quoted Neil Degrasse Tyson \"The good thing about science is that \nit's true whether or not you believe in it.\" (referring to people who do \nnot believe in evolution) It just goes to show how scientists can't even \ndistinguish fact from interpretation. Even Richard Feynman, a great mind, \ndid this with quantum mechanics. He was doing a lecture on how the \nprobability of light reflecting off glass from a 90 degree angle is just \nfundamental and has no reason for it and he said \"Its too bad if you don't \nlike it, it is how the universe works!\" (just in case you do not see the \nproblem with this, saying it is fundamental is an interpretation and he \nstated it as if it were fact) What is worse is he just finished explaining \nhow it is pointless to ask philosophical explanations about what we observe \nand to just accept it. He then does a bait and switch and says accept this \ninterpretation.\n\n\"for it is a bit of a truism to tell people that the universe began\" You \nasked for a narrative, what did you expect? You even said start from the \nvery beginning lol.\n\n\"its a bit arrogant to tell people you know what began it.\" As mentioned \nbefore, I do not claim to know truth, I only think what I know is true. I \neven said \"This is of course metaphysics, so the explanation is purely \nphilosophical.\"",

In this one I will \nstart from the very beginning - or more accurately before that (Even before \nisn't exactly accurate)\n\nBefore 'the all': \n\n In this message I will explain the nature of God as that was all that was \nthere before the all. This is of course metaphysics, so the explanation is \npurely philosophical. The bible begins with \"In the beginning God created \nthe heavens and the earth\" The reason it says beginning is because this is \nthe beginning of time. As incomprehensible as this is, God is timeless, \nhaving no past nor future. There was no before the universe. For God there \nis just the present. Think of God like a photon. Relative to us, the photon \nhits our retina, relative to the photon that just hit the retina, all \nthings have happened, even if time is infinite. In a way all things remain \npresent to the photon too, as the time it hit the retina happened just as \nlong ago as any other point in time. Why? because there is no time to the \nphoton. As a ten year old kid I remember trying to imagine what it was like \nbefore everything. I imagined God as a spiritual human floating in space, \nhaving a language for no reason, a body for no reason and floating in space \nfor no reason. This is not the case, God only chose to take the form of a \nhuman in heaven. He is not restricted by that form. This reminds me of the \ntrinity and how many people have a problem with how God could be multiple \nentities at once. I would explain it myself but this video does it \nelegantly, using logic (not the layman 'logic') making the argument almost \nirrefutable.\n\nwww(dot)youtube(dot)com/watch?v=bUy-H5MmeGU\n\nGod has created absolutely everything, matter, space, time and possibly \neven mathematics (there is disagreement about the latter, mathematics could \nbe absolute or we  maybe unable to comprehend how mathematics may not be \ntrue for all things since we live in a universe that is ruled by \nmathematics). \n\nA common question asked about God is why does he exist? We do not know. \nHowever this question could be broken down further to why does anything \nexist? This is the golden question of metaphysics and there are two \nresponses to this. The first is 'why does there have to be a reason?' and \nthe second is that the answer is probably beyond our comprehension. When we \nask questions they usually lead to more questions, this suggests we know \nnothing. If we struggle to understand the nature of our own universe, how \ncan we expect to understand what is beyond it?",

Why else do you think Physicists talk so dogmatically about the \nmultiverse? There is a common saying that it is either God or a multiverse. \nThe conclusion is made through reason, not observation.\n\n\"The multiverse hypothesis is generally based off the ideas of M-brane \ntheory\" M-brane theory has no tangible evidence to support it. It does not \ndeserve to be called a theory. It is like many worlds 'theory'.\n\n\"Creationism is a hypothesis, based usually on several ideas\n-the inherent order in the universe is the result of intelligent design\n-nothing has effect without cause\n-humans are too rare to be the result of a random process of evolution\" \nThere are far more 'ideas' to it than that and the ones you listed aren't \naccurate. I will address each point respectively:\n\n-Fine tuned laws suggest design (I know of two counter arguments to this \nand I have counter arguments to those counter arguments)\n\n-Everything that begins to exist has a cause\n\n-Certain systems of organisms cannot be any simpler aka irreducible \ncomplexity \n\nNow those are philosophical ideas we have there is also evidence against \nevolution such as genetic entropy, finding blood vessels, bone matrix and \nelastic tissue in dinosaurs, lack of transitional fossils (with just a \nhandful of disputable once), the ridiculous amount of modern birds in \ndinosaur strata etc\n\n\"Bacteria have been shown to become resistant to anti-biotics over the \ncourse of (their) generations due to mutations and natural selection. This \nmatches the hypothesis of evolution and thus is considered proof of it as a \ntheory.\" Creationists do not argue with natural selection and speciaton (In \nfact rapid speciation is more important to the creation model than it is to \nthe evolutionary model) This just shows how ignorant you are of creationist \nliterature. For an organism to be able to evolve from single celled \norganism it requires beneficial mutations that increase the information of \nthe genome and create a new feature. Bacteria becoming more resistant is \ndue to losing control of an enzyme's production. There is no new feature \nadded. \n\n\"This matches the hypothesis of evolution and thus is considered proof of \nit as a theory.\" If we observed a new feature added to an organism that \nwould only prove that evolution is possible (if we ignore genetic entropy \nand abiogenesis). To prove it occurred requires finding a series of \ntransitional fossils showing the development of a new feature. \n\n\"There is no similar proof for the hypothesis of creationism.\" Creationists \naccept that we cannot use science to prove the past as it is beyond what \ncan be observed, it also requires assumptions of the past and the \ninterpretation of evidence can become philosophical. However we like to \ncreate dilemmas for evolutionists who believe science can do so. ICR has \nfound an excessive amounts of C14 in diamonds, dating them under one \nmillion years (that's as low as it could record). The problem is diamonds \nare said to have formed one billion to three billion years ago. If this was \nthe case there should be no C14 left. You cannot say it has been \ncontaminated either like you do with dinosaurs fossils (they are frequently \ndated under 50,000 years) because diamonds are the densest naturally \noccurring mineral on earth making it the least likely to get contaminated. \nThere is a saying that a diamond is a creationists best friend. Also \ncivilizations around the world have legends that are very similar to Adam \nand Eve, the great flood and the tower of babel. This may be considered \nproof that these events occurred.",
