As well as the human story to it; \nhow it's survival of the fittest, but what's interesting about the cordycep \nidea and what makes it different from your typical zombie story, is that \nthese people are simply infected, they don't die and then come back alive; \nthey aren't necessarily the living dead.\n\nIn fact, throughout, it makes you aware of that as they sometimes mention \nit. So it brings up the question of morality really. You can actually think \nof it as the people are just extremely ill, and while dangerous here, with \nany other illness, would you kill someone because of it? What if there is a \ncure? Could you willingly kill it as if it were like a zombie, when it is \nin fact not? It's just something I thought about as I played it recently. \nObviously, survival comes to mind, but I'm curious to know how many people \njust see them as the typical zombie, or realize it's different than that; \ndifferent than the dead that crawl out of their grave.\n\nAlso, what if with the infection, there is no 'too far gone', and you can \nactually cure them so they are no longer able to infect another, and no \nlonger violent? They'd perhaps not be who they were before they became \ninfected, after a cure, and forever mentality disabled, but they'd still be \nhuman, and then you realize that all those ones that had died before were \nactually murdered. Genocide. A lot of people, when I've seen them play or \nhear them talk about it often say 'zombie', when it really isn't that.\ufeff",

It is, however, highly vulnerable to \ninfection by the hyperparasitic fungus during this maturation period, so a \nlarge proportion of the mushrooms become infected and prevented from \nsporulating. Mature mushrooms, by contrast, likely have efficient immune \ndefences that protect them against infection.\"\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/may/03/zombie-ant-parasitic-fungus\n\nThe fungus has it's own downfall. Only a marginally small amount of fungi \nbecome mature enough to develop healthy spores. It's been said that these \nspores do not carry through air very well, and since it is a fungus, it \nprefers more humid, temperate areas.\n\nI was reading about this not too long ago. While it is something to think \nabout, Cordyceps is an ancient fungus. It was dated back to around 48m \nyears ago.\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus\n\nAs far as studies have shown, the ant don't become violent in any way and \nthe don't usually die within where the colony is. The ones that shown signs \nare usually taken away by some other worker ant to keep the colony safe. \nWorst case scenario, they move.\n\nThat's not to say humans won't become violent because of the fungus \n(considering our violent ways), but we most likely won't even find this \nout. Especially since the fungus has been used in medicine for years, more \ncommonly in China.\n\nAnother interesting link: \nhttp://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis\ufeff",
