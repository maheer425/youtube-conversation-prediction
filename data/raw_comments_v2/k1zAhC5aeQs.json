            "text": "+MonkeyNoob Sorry for the long comment. I'm a writer at heart. :P\n\nThey removed Force of Nature because of the way it worked, which didn't \ncoordinate to how a champion is supposed to be played. As you probably \nknow, Force of Nature was similar to that of Sword of the Occult and \nMejai's Soulstealer, in the fact that you gain 2 stacks per kill, and 1 \nstack per assist, each stack giving a stat depending on which item. \n(Soulstealer gives AP, Occult gives AD, and Nature gave health) Upon \nreaching the maximum possible stacks, 20, you also got a bonus stat \ndepending on the item. Soulstealer gives 15% bonus CDR, Occult gives 15% \nbonus move speed, and Nature gave a massive 15% reduced damage. Considering \nthe low cost of these items, it's not so much about getting the item that's \na problem, it's about not dying. Each item, no matter which, will lose 1/3 \nof it's current stacks upon death.\n\nThe reason Force of Nature was removed was because it didn't coordinate \nwith how the tank role was supposed to be played. In a proper League game, \nthere will be at least 1 tank for a team, a person who soaks damage for \ntheir allies and tries to make the Marksman and Mage very scared. Their job \nis, ultimately, to die for their team. When they had a maxstacked Force of \nNature, they were to afraid to play as a tank and played more defensively \nsince they didn't want to lose stacks. As a result, tanks would leave their \nteam in the middle of a fight so they didn't have to lose stacks. Riot then \nremoved the item because of it's massive imbalance on non-tanks as well, as \na mage would just build all three stack items and never die. It disoriented \nteamfights and mislabeled a champions playstyle, which overall made it an \noverpowered and underpriced monster of an item.",
