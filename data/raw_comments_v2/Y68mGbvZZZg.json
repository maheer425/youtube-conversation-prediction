However, there is difference between good fundamental criticism \nand useless criticism.\n\nFor instance, questioning the existence of a God, whether morals are \nobjective, or the relativistic importance of an issue is good fundamental \ncriticism.  It allows us to better find the point from which further study \nand debate may begin.  Questions like these grant the philosopher an axiom \non which to build further.\n\nBut, when looking at Nietzche's attack, we see that all he has done is \nconfound the matter without approaching the truly important issue.  Instead \nof asking whether science has purpose (as he assumes religion does; which \nscience does, btw), it would be far better to ask whether knowledge and \nwisdom can amount to any meaning or purpose whatsoever.\n\nDoes the world have meaning?  Can knowledge be purely objective?  If \nscience could achieve such an end (pure, objective, universal meaning), is \nit one we should necessarily pursue?\n\nInstead of getting the man's opinions on these matters, we get this mundane \nBS.\nThat said, I do really like Nietzsche's \"Parable of a Madman\", so, he's got \nthat going for him, which is nice.\ufeff",

Why are do the atoms have the electronegativities that they do? The \nstructure of the atom, number of protons and neutrons. Why? We can get into \nsubatomic physics. Why? We can delve deeper. But yeah, eventually we don't \nknow. Why did the big bang happen? We're working on figuring that out, but \neven if we do, do you think people won't ask why whatever that answer is \nhappened? What caused whatever caused the big bang? Science not having \nevery answer does not mean you can put it on equal footing with religion \nwhen you're talking about truth.\ufeff",

The Greek word rendered \n\u201ctruth\u201d denotes that which conforms to fact or to what is proper and right. \nJehovah has preserved spiritual truth and has made knowledge of it \navailable to us in ever-increasing abundance. (2 John 1, 2) Our \ncomprehension of the truth steadily becomes clearer, for \u201cthe path of the \nrighteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter \nuntil the day is firmly established\u201d! (Prov. 4:18) Of course, we fully \nagree with Jesus, who said in prayer to God the words of today\u2019s text. \nGod\u2019s written Word contains \u201cthe truth of the good news,\u201d which consists of \nthe whole body of Christian teachings. (Gal. 2:14) In part, these include \nfacts about Jehovah\u2019s name, his sovereignty, Jesus\u2019 ransom sacrifice, the \nresurrection, and the Kingdom.\ufeff",

Anyone who thinks otherwise should look up \nthe Naturalistic Fallacy. \n\nLet's say science says humans can't run a mile under 4 minutes because the \nbones can't handle it, a real thought prior to Roger Bannister breaking it. \n\nLet's say observations thus far say humans can't stay awake, and perform \ndifficult activities for a week straight. Well every man who has ever \npassed the SEAL's Hell Week would contradict that.\n\nScience is a collection of averages. Science is arbitrary data points. \nScience is not an ethical compass or a predictor of the future.\n\nEat shit you fucking kittens.",

Same with science. It's a tool, but concluding that it's its \nown end is an error.\n\nYou sense this as an artist.
