            "text": "I would describe what I am seeing this way.  When the first break occurs in \npure bending (tensile failure on the outside of the curve) the free end \nsprings back becausde of the stored compression and tensile forces, in a \nwave that starts at the break.  Near the break, this is just a reease of \nenergy, but that release gets converted into kinetic energy that causes the \nfree end to rebound away from the curve, until a reverse curve and reversed \ntensile and compression forces are stored. \n\nAt about the point where the reverse bend is about6 the same as the \noriginal bend, the bending is replaced with almost pure shear (equal bends \nin two opposite directions must meet at an inflection point of no bending, \nbut pure shear force).  And the failure there produces much higher \nseperation acceleration at right angles to the strand, like a shear fault \nbreaking, than the original break did.\ufeff",
