The photographer \nbought the camera and film, arranged for it to be in the right place at the \nright time, removed same and developed the images (assuming film - \n\"downloaded\" if it's digital), and there's no other entity involved who can \nreally contest his copyright by asserting their own. Now - I'm not a \nlawyer, but the wikipedia legal position that the public owns the image \nbecause they think maybe the photographer doesn't simply doesn't match \ncommon sense - it's clever clever, but not compelling. \ufeff",
