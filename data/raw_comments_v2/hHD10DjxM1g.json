Your 1-3/4 blue buckets is \nactually only 17.5 cups (not 21) and would still overflow the bucket by 3 \ncups. I ended up with a lot of left over cement. Similarly, 20 cups of \ncement would fill the 5 qt bucket to the brim, resulting in a very thick \nlid. It appears your half recipe would be more like 5 cups each of sand and \nplaster and 3 cups of water. This would make a 10 cup lid, about half the 5 \nqt bucket that is shown in the video.

I cut the tops off with a recip saw, but a grinder \nwith a cutting wheel works just as well, if not as clean of a cut.\n\nI also took some expanded metal grate from a local steel supplier had in \ntheir scrap pile and made a small platform for the crucible to rest on, \nrather than resting directly on the coals. It rests in the void via \nfriction fit against the sides of the void.\n\nI installed a pair of bolts in the top of the crucible, then made a lifting \nhandle out of a short length of flat steel bar that hooks around the bolts \nwhen I want to pour into my sand cast. Tongs are simply to likely to slip \noff of the crucible, and the prospect of splattering molten metal \neverywhere is thoroughly unappealing.\ufeff",
