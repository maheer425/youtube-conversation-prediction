In case you're wondering who he is, \nJean Chretien was then the Canadian prime minister.  He really likes golf.\nAlso, about the fight, in case you haven't read Bob Barker's book, he \nmentions the only part of the fight he didn't do was rolling down the \nhill.  Those were stuntmen who did that portion.  Everything else was Adam \nSandler and Bob Barker.  I believe that fight won them an MTV movie award.\ufeff",
