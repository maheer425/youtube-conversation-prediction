Once you establish that the Avengers are all part of \nthe same cinematic universe, any stand alone hero movie is going to seem \ncheap. Why aren't the others there? Why aren't they reference? Another \nthing is that Captain America doesn't hold up as a fun superhero when you \nput him in present day settings. This movie just seemed to be a more amped \nup version of the new James Bond films or the Bourne trilogy. It just \nwasn't fun at all watching Capt being shepherded around by Black Widow \nsearching for clues like god damned Scooby Doo. Unless they were fighting \nBlack Widow pretty much held his hand thru the entire film. What fun is \nthat?\ufeff",
