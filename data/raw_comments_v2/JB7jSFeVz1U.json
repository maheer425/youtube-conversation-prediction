My high school Anatomy teacher was the one that got me into \nscience, but I wouldn't say he was even close to Feynman,  Also, Neil's \nversion of Cosmos doesn't hold a candle to Sagan's. You should really watch \nSagan's if you haven't already. How old are you btw? Assuming you're pretty \nyoung if Neil's Cosmos is what got you into science.
