That's essentially what is \nhappening by the time the falling object reaches the center.  There is no \nreason for it to magically stop in the center.  By the time it gets there, \nit has built up 8km/s of velocity, so it has all that kinetic energy to \nreach the opposite side of Earth.\n\nThink of it this way :\n\nIf you were standing on the surface of the Earth, and you had a friend \nclimb a ladder and drop a rock from the top of that ladder 100 meters above \nthe surface, and then you were asked to measure the velocity it has when it \nhits the Earth, you would find that if you threw that rock back up toward \nyour friend at the top of that ladder with the same velocity it landed \nwith, it would have just enough energy to reach the exact height your \nfriend dropped it from.  The same concept applies to this mind experiment.  \nThe object falling toward the center of Earth will have some velocity when \nit reaches the center.  The moment it passes the center, it is as if it was \nthrown back up the hole with the same velocity it had when it reached the \ncenter, ergo - it will have enough energy to reach the same height it was \ndropped from - and on a perfectly spherical Earth (which is assumed here), \nit would perfectly reach the other surface \"lip\" of the Earth.",

In other \nwords, the centripetal and centrifugal forces would be a little over 2 \nNewtons - one in each direction of course.  The apparent acceleration would \nbe about .03 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThis is no different than centrifugal force is right now on the outside of \nthe Earth.  A 75kg man weighs about a half a pound less at the equator than \nhe does at the poles, so to answer your question - nothing DIFFERENT \nhappens.

The Inner Sun at \nthe center of Earth is the mysterious power source behind the Earth's \nmagnetic field.\nThere are entry caverns all over the Earth, where interactions can take \nplace. Only some are currently open. Nikola Tesla, the genius inventor of \nelectrical technology, is now living inside the Hollow Earth. He began to \nreceive information in the latter part of the 1800's and discovered that: \n\u201celectric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive \nthe world's machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas or any other of \nthe common fuels\u201d. In the 1930's the tunnel entrances and passageways were \nclosed off by the Hollow Earth civilizations because \u201ccorporations\u201d at that \ntime were misusing Tesla's technology to gain entrance into the Inner \nEarth. The Hollow Earth's two main Portals are at the Holes at the Poles, \nwhich were closed off in the year 2000 because our governments were setting \ndetonations at the Poles to blow open entrances into their world. They have \ninstalled a magnetic force field around Earth's polar openings to further \ncamouflage the entrances. This way, the openings are protected from air and \nland sightings. In the past there were entrances to the Library of \nPorthologos on the surface. One such entrance was the Library of \nAlexandria, which was destroyed by fire in A.D. 642.\ufeff",
