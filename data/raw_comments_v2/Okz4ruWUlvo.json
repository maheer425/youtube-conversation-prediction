That's probably because I worked in retail selling \nthem; so I'd say something about that in order to ease the customers mind \nwhile they are paying for it. \n\"If you wear it twenty times then it only cost a dollar.\"\nI think it was something you could wear that many times--easy.\n\nAnyway, I myself have a hard time spending money on myself when it comes to \nsomething fun. Sure I can drop cash on nearly anything experience related; \nbut when it comes to video games, artist programs and other such \nthings--it's just hard. I guess because I know I need experiences to grow \nand learn, which is important to me, but I don't technically NEED the other \nthings if I can get something similar for free. At the same time I am \nactually missing out on certain experiences because of that.\n\nSo really...I need to think about the cost of not buying an item and \nwhether I'm losing something important because I just don't want to shell \nout the money. It's obvious that the cost of a Superbowl ticket would mean \nnothing to me because the experience would be priceless--especially if the \nteam I root for was playing. It is also more about who I am with. Then why \nis it so hard for me to buy a video game that was marked down to ten \ndollars? Just because it's not an event doesn't give it less value. I've \nplayed a type of game before; but that one would give me a different \nexperience just as much as a trip to a country that I haven't been to \nbefore.\nMaybe it is related to how much weight I actually put on a particular \nexperience...I'm going to stop typing out my thoughts now. haha\ufeff",

Video games have become an excellent medium for \nnot only storytelling, but also for expressing ideas, morals, (in)equality \nstruggles, differences in culture, I'm sure we could go on. The best two \nexamples I can think of instantly are Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed. \nIn Mass Effect, if you do, as you say, explore all the content, you will \nlearn about many cultures and their morals that, while fictional, may or \nmay not have real world origins or at the very least real world \napplications. Also the ongoing decisions, many of which put you in \nsituations where you must decide between the needs of the many, few, or \nself.\nAssassin's Creed is one of my favorite franchises and one of the main \nreasons is because, while you start off with a very clear distinction of \ngood guys vs bad guys, as your character converses with their dying \nenemies, you learn that many of them have noble intentions and goals; some \nof them even just happen to be on the wrong side and just don't realize it. \nWhile this doesn't tend to be true for the higher ranking Templars, the \nlines between right and wrong still quite often become extremely blurred.\nOn the other side of this topic are books, and, again, while I agree that \nmost books SHOULD be more enriching, as another commenter pointed out, \nthere are a LOT of bad books out there these days. That's not to say there \naren't bad games, but it is easier and cheaper to write, publish, and \ndistribute a book than most other entertainment mediums; bad content will \nfilter through by volume alone. Admittedly I'm not a huge reader so I don't \nhave any readily available examples, but I'm willing to risk YouTube \ncomment flak on the assumption that plenty of people would not disagree.\ufeff",

            "text": "Two things to note.\n\nOne, the publishing of books has pretty much always been that way, with way \nmore crap than good stuff. The thing is, if you're reading anything \nactually prominent for its time period, it would have sifted through all of \nthe crap and climbed into the upper echelons of the best books available \njust to be worth noticing for literary purposes in the modern era. You \ndon't read crap from the 1800's, the crap is sitting unread in dusty \nshelves while you're reading some of the best stuff able to be produced \nduring that period.\n\nTwo, it's really hard to moderate book quality, because everybody has \ndifferent standards of quality. Which is, in my own humble opinion, not a \nbad thing in the slightest. Books like Twilight receive a mixture of large \npopularity and large hatred because (\n*coughpeoplehavenoliterarystandardscough*) different people have different \nyet valid opinions on the book's quality. Some people see it as badly \nwritten, shallow, and meaningless, while others consider it a masterful \nexample of how primal and vain the thing teenagers refer to as \"love\" truly \nis. There are no objective standards of quality, at least not when it comes \nto how well a book was written, and to be honest, even as somebody who \nstrongly rejects the idea that falling into certain habits based on their \npopularity is a good idea, it is also very difficult for me to agree with \nsomebody who says that an incredibly popular book is truly a bad book. The \npurpose of a book is to inform, entertain, or influence in a certain \ndirection an audience. If you've done any of the above to a large degree to \na large number of people, then how can that book really be considered a \nfailure? That vagueness as to what qualities contribute to a book being \ngood, and the fact that even clearly defined rules pertaining what one \nperson may consider good don't provide a whole lot of help telling what \nsomebody else will think is good, combined with the necessity to experiment \nwith things that might not and often don't work in order to avoid writing a \nbook somebody else basically already wrote, result in a system where the \nvast majority of books will, by necessity, be considered totally awful by a \ngood portion of the people who read them. This doesn't mean they're \nnecessarily bad books, nor does it mean they're necessarily good books, nor \ndo distinctions between bad and good even exist beyond a certain point in \nliterature. There are objectively bad qualities in a book, but most of that \nhas to do with the writers making distinct errors in literary theory and \nhave nothing to do with the intelligence or creative writing capacity of \nthe author.\n\nSo I say, keep releasing books I hate. I know a few gems will appear in the \ntidal wave of crap.",

The enjoyment of a book, as you \nmention, tends to lay in the reflection upon what you've read rather than \nthe fact that you are reading.

If you learn a lifelong lesson or fondly recall a book \nfor the rest of your life, or it introduces you to entire new concepts, the \nvalue is obviously incredible but has nothing to do with how many pages \nlong it was or the amount of time you spent on each paragraph.\n\nCompare this to a book which you have mostly forgotten that you've read a \nmonth or two later.  You essentially got no value out of reading it and \nyour time was wasted, you could have spent it doing any number of other \nthings including reading a better book.

Yes, if you \nread more quickly (but not to the point where you miss things or don't \nremember what you just read, as you mentioned), you can then access more \ncontent within the same amount of time, and as long as all that content is \ngood, the amount of enjoyment per unit of time will generally increase \nassuming you draw pleasure strictly from the reading of content (rather \nthan from things that might slow you down, like taking a few minutes to \nreflect on the meaning of what you read). However, the idea here is less \nthat reading the same book more slowly gives you more enjoyment, but rather \nthat reading a longer book with a proportionally greater amount of \nenjoyable content for the same price as a shorter book is a better \ninvestment. Keep in mind, a book isn't like one big packet of one thing, \nit's a mesh of things and you receive new (hopefully enjoyable) content \nfrom paragraph to paragraph if not sentence to sentence. It's much like \nyour example of enjoying extra content in a game; if you receive the same \nenjoyment per minute reading one book as another book, and this enjoyment \ndoes not increase or diminish substantially over the course of the book, \nand both cost, say, $30, then would you rather read the one that's 450 \npages long, or the one that's 800 pages long? You're getting more content \nand longer-lasting enjoyment for your dollar out of the second book. \nGranted, some books are better left shorter, so I might consider both books \nequally good after the fact; but while I'm reading them, I get to enjoy one \nlonger than I get to enjoy the other, and the enjoyment is the same \n(preferably high) per minute no matter which book I read, so I'd rather \nread for longer.\n\nIf that makes any sense.

I even might lose some \nenjoyment, because I would not be immersed in the world the book creates \nfor as long. (Which is the best part of any fiction at least.)
