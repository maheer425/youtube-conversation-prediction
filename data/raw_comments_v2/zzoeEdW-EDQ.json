But, \nsense Yavin was a gas giant, would it have really needed a fully powered \nshot to destroy its core?  What if Yavin only required a half powered shot \nand the other half could have been used on the moon?  How big was the \nmoon?  Could it be destroyed with 1/10th of a fully charged shot?\n\nWe would need to know how long it takes the Death Star to fully charge, and \nhow much of that charge it would take to destroy the two bodies.  \nOtherwise, we're all just shooting into the dark with random ass theories.  \nIt just seems to me that the center of a gas giant and a moon, even back to \nback,  wouldn't even take a fully charged shot to destroy; as a solid large \nplanet would.  But, again, without the above information, I'm just guessing.\n\nAlso, none of this matters.  The fact of the matter is that destroying the \nbase would have done absolutely nothing to spare the Death Star after the \nX-Wing Launch.  Luke used the Force to time his shot, so there was no need \nfor targeting input or radio chatter.  Most people besides Luke and Han \njust seemed to serve the purpose of dying so we could see ships blow up and \ncreate tension.  But did any of the X-Wings need the base to communicate, \nor can then communicate between themselves?\n\nGranted, there would be no base to fly back to; couldn't Han just dock the \nX-Wing to the Falcon and bring Luke in?\n\nHehehehe......  :-)\ufeff",

If they wanted to they could have deployed \nenough to stop any escape from Yavin 4 by the small rebel band. If the \ndeathstar didn't have the ability to launch near unlimited amounts it was a \nwaste of opportunity and space. Any battlestation that large should act \nsecondarily as a mothership to be able to protect itself in a battle as it \nbecomes a target. Tarkin I can imagine would have made sure it had whatever \nforce was necessary to stop anything, even an entire planetary fleet, maybe \nmore. Your planet destroyer isn't much good if a planets ships can blow it \nup before you destroy the planet.\ufeff",
