It \ncould have been 3 days, and then resurrected only to live on earth for the \nrest of his days.\nIf I'm not your friend, then I''m clearly your enemy. My God says to love \nyour enemies, to wish them well, to pray for them, to bless them.\nI just prayed for you.

Imagine God at that point; his son says \n\"don't kill these people, let me die, I'm the evil one;\" and in the \nprocess, is made to be the carrier of all sin ever committed by man. A \nparent had to turn away from their child in disgust at the evil it had, and \nkill it.\n\nThat's quite a sacrifice on God's part; and it must not be fun to have your \ndad spill wrath on you.\n\nBtw, some scholars say that Jesus spent those days before resurrecting in \nhell. Idk, but if that's the case, then that's pretty amazing, considering \nhell is supposed to be the most evil, the cruelest thing imaginable.
