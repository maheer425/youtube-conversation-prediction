If you didn\u2019t understand that \nphilosophy before, let me show you this video! This will explain it in a \nway you\u2019ve never seen before.\n\n\n\nPlato\u2019s allegory of the Cave is the story and metaphor for our awareness of \nthe reality we live in and our prospective of it. Many find it accurate to \nportray the reality we have perceived is akin to just shadows dancing on a \nwall, and everything we have previously believed to be true is simply a \nfraction of the experience of what is really going on in the bigger picture \nof things. With reality shown to us this way we can begin to understand how \nthere are larger forces of being at play that govern the phenomenon that \ntake place in this realm as well, just like the shadows in the story.

We can be still be critical and have \nopinions, but we should all remember in the forefront of our minds that we \ncould all be wrong. \n\nSo many stupid people out there delude themselves by justifying their \nstupid ideas or denying their sins or convincing themselves that they are \nauthentic human beings despite the fact that they follow the herd. You can \nargue with them all day long and they just can't conceive the possibility, \nnot even accept a 0.001% that they could themselves be \"living in a cave.\" \n\nThis is why philosophy was created by brilliant men like Plato, in order to \nopen the minds of men like these. This makes the world a much better place. \n\nUnfortunately, philosophical ideas are usually complicated, and even \ngeniuses like Plato, despite their best efforts, have trouble simplifying \ntheir admirable ideas to the extent the majority of the world's idiots can \nunderstand them.

Again, \nif they cast a shadow, sooner or later they'll experiment and realize to a \ncertain degree what a shadow is, in which case the analogy won't hold. \nIncidentally, I think this thought experiment is even nicer because the \nstupid prisoner will keep thinking the shadow is an \"object\" in itself \nwhile the smart prisoner will use all available pieces of information (e.g \nhis own shadow) in order to form a more accurate worldview.

Secondly you are \nreading into his words too literally. \n\nRight off of the bat, notice how in the video it doesn't show the \nreflections of the prisoners? Even if it did, it wouldn't matter since I \ndon't think a person in their circumstances we be able to reasonably \nconclude that the shadows are merely shadows as we know shadows to be. \nHowever this point is completely irrelevant to what Plato is saying so lets \nignore it. Lets pretend that the fire and sword or above them, or set in \nsome position that no shadow is cast of the prisoners, but a visible shadow \nof the sword is cast. Assuming that, we can get to the main point. Now this \nmay confuse your feeble mind so try and pay attention.\n\nThe prisoners see the sword's shadow as a real object in itself. Having \nlived their life in a cave, they have no concept of what a shadow is and \nwould not be able to reasonably expect that the sword's shadow is merely a \nreflection of the actual sword. \n\nNow, we, as the viewers on the outside, can recognize that the shadow is \nnot an object in itself but merely an \"imperfect copy\" of a real thing. \nLikewise, we understand that the cave is not the whole world, or the \"whole \nof entire existence\" as the prisoners would likely perceive it. The \nprisoners are so sure of themselves that the cave they live in is the truth \nof the world. It would be easy for us to laugh at them, to think the \nprisoners naive and uninformed. \n\nHowever just as how the prisoners are certain of the world, yet incorrect, \nhow do we know that the we are not incorrect in what we perceive to be the \nwhole of existence? We can view that what the prisoners see as universe is \nmerely a cave that is part of a much larger world. How do we know that our \nworld itself isn't merely a \"cave\" that is part of an even larger world, or \nanother plane of existence? \n\nAnother plane of existence may not existence. But we don't know for sure, \nso for the sake of argument we assume there is a higher plane for now. So \nfor the shadow. If we can't be certain that we aren't just as dumb as the \nprisoners, and we can't be certain that our world isn't also merely a \nsmaller sub-world within a larger universe, how can we be sure that what we \nsee as the sword, the \"real object,\" isn't also a \"shadow\" that is being \nreflected from that larger world? \n\nI mean shadow in the metaphorical sense of course. What I mean is, how do \nwe know that the sword we see isn't also an \"imperfect copy\", \"flawed \nreflection\", or distortion of an object resting that higher plane of \nexistence? \n\nShort answer, we can't.

Criticism is a powerful too when accompanied by a better \nsolution.\n\nLet's take your onion analogy for example, where you a acknowledge the \npresence of the other layers but fail to have any motivation to explore it \ncause you assume boundaries with the hope of simplifying things by making a \nchoice. Once you make a choice that the only layer in which you exist \nmatters to you, finally resulting rejecting other scenarios just because \nthey are irrelevant for you currently.\n\nIf all the human kind was just content with living in reality we would not \nhave had telescopes/microscopes to understand the vastness of the universe \nor mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nScience is a mere tool to answer giving solutions and explanations, and \nphilosophy has always been about asking questions, Questions that force you \nto think beyond the visible reality but still addressing our existence and \nrelevance as life . .\ufeff",
