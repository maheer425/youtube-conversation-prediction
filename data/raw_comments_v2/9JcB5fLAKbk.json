If you're the type of person that's project-oriented, and doesn't \nlike interruptions all the time (which may be why you're not a fan of kids) \nthen getting a puppy or kitten will drive you nuts. But an older cat just \nwants to hang out and see what you're doing. Main issue is you inherit what \npast owners have done to the pet. Our dog was 3 when we got him, and \nprevious owner must have hit him. When he hears someone raise their voice \nhe goes and hides. Plus, he changed hands a few times before us, and has \nabandonment issues. I think people moved and couldn't afford pet deposits \nat apartments, because when we moved twice he was very anxious. Probably \nthought we were gonna dump him off to a new person. Even our kitten is a \nbit abandonment. He and a sister were found as strays. Not sure what \nhappened to mother cat. A lady fostered them, then adopted them out at \nshelter. His sister was adopted first, then we adopted him later that day. \nHe lost his mom, his sister and his foster parent. We notice that if my gf \nor I leave, he's quick to go snuggle with whoever is still at home.\ufeff",

She has a couple of \ncompanion stuffed animals she grooms. Alice is so sweet, purrs so much and \nloves to be petted. My other cat was adopted out to someone else after her \nowner died. She was abandoned when the other person left town. I tracked \nher down at the shelter and she is a joyful companion. Lots of purring, \nbirdwatching together and pleasant comaraderie. What a lucky lifetime for \nme to have these blessed four legged pets. When I think of senior cats for \nme it is about quality of life rather than quantity of life.

She had \na history of shock collars, which left a scar on the side of her neck and \nmade her meow sound more crackly and gravelly. She also has larger fangs. \nMost of my friends are terrified of her, until they really get to MEET her. \nShe is the most loving, adorable and awesome cat I've ever had. She loves \nto sleep on feet, loves getting belly rubs (usually only from me, until she \ngets to know others), loves to just be a lap cat and watch television.\n\nAlright, moving on a couple years. I adore her, play with her daily, giving \nher everything I can.. but she starts getting lethargic and slow moving. \nShe sleeps a lot more, and isn't nearly as cuddly. I figured, why not try a \nfriend? We introduced her to three other cats, an older female, an younger \nfemale, and a teenage female. All of which she didn't get along with, and \nall of which found better homes where they weren't constantly fighting with \nthe queen of the house. I decided, enough is enough, we'll just have to \nfigure out something else. Now, all of the times I was introducing the \nfemales to Kali, I was doing it the 'proper way' that I was told to- \nseparating them, slowly introducing them to each other, and then trading \nout different smells of one another.\n\nNow, normally I don't want a kitten. They're noisy, messy, (adorable, yes) \nand high energy. I didn't want a male cat because I was scared he would \nspray. But just one more time, my wife says, just try it one more time. So, \nI agreed, but under one condition- try a male kitten. To me, this sounded \nlike doomsday, but I had an odd feeling. Craigslist was offering a kitten \nat a local trailer park, and upon meeting him, he instantly went over to me \nand wouldn't leave without me. I took him home, and started setting up the \nusual separation barriers, before I paused. It hadn't worked the last few \ntimes. I took a chance, and opened up the carrier, and to my surprise, Kali \nwent right over to him. She instantly started to clean him, and he started \nplaying with her. I named him Charlie, and he is Kali's best friend. She \nstopped being lethargic, she stopped being secluded. They play together, \neat together and sleep together. It's been almost a year and six months \nnow, and they're still just as close. As for me, I love Charlie. I didn't \nthink I could handle a kitten, but I found out I could. He doesn't spray, \nand is the 'man of the house'.\ufeff",

I feel like I won the cat jackpot. I adopted my cats \n~8 years ago when a friend discovered two litters in her NorCal barn. She \nhad ~12 kittens running around her property and was determined to find good \nhomes for them all. I took two. I had gone to visit over Memorial Day; they \nweren't yet weaned. Over Labor Day I brought them home. In the meantime, as \nI had never had cats before, I decided I needed some practical cat handling \nexperience, so I went and volunteered at the Seattle Humane Society. I \nlearned a lot about cat behavior and how they differ from dogs (I had an \nelderly Akita/Lab mix at the time). Through that volunteer experience I met \n\"Mama\" Chloe, a Russian Blue, who was a bit older and had a calm demeanor. \nAfter a some internal debate, I decided I had to bring her home. I must \nhave encountered dozens of cats during that time but I really connected \nwith her. She essentially trained the kittens. I almost feel like we \nco-parent them. I've never had a behavioral problem with any of them. They \nall came home at about the same time and they adore each other. I was lucky \nthat the senior volunteer I worked with at the shelter taught me a lot of \nthe things you teach on your show and through other media like Cat Mojo. \nThat experience really prepared me for life with cats and made all our \nlives richer. I would recommend that anyone considering a first time cat \nadoption spend some time volunteering at a shelter. It's invaluable \nexperience. And yes, if you have the resources, there are great older cats \nthat would so appreciate a loving home. Cheers, Anita\ufeff",

            "text": "Yes, most definitely! We adopted one of our cats when he was 16 human years \nold and his owner didn't want him any more. We were lucky to share his life \nfor just under 4 years before he died. We were told he was an outdoor cat \nwho would refuse to come indoors, yet for us he never wanted to go outside. \nHe was a lap cat, for the first time in his life, and he used to sleep \nabove our heads. I remember laying in bed the first night all our 4 cats \nwere allowed to be together.  He was on the floor at the side of the bed, \nmiaowing because he was the only cat who wasn't on the bed with us but he \nsimply daredn't jump up because of how he had been treated before. My \npartner lifted him up and he immediately stopped miaowing, cuddled up \nbetween us and started purring loudly. He was so happy that night, like his \ndreams had come true. His personality changed and he blossomed into a \nfriendly, loving cat who adored being with us. He followed us around \neverywhere in the house and even used to sit at the side of my head when I \nwas having a bath! The only time he stopped purring was when he slept.\n\nHe died in October 2012, and we still miss him every day, but we know that \nhe enjoyed his life with us - we made him the centre of our world and he \nthrived with such attention, and paid us back a thousand times over.\n\nI honestly think you get more back from adopting an older cat. The ones \nyou've lived with since they were kittens have only every known happiness, \nthe older ones might have experienced hardship, unhappiness or a lack of \nlove. They respond so positively when they finally get to experience the \ngood things in life, and they pay you back with lots of affection. \nObviously, some cats are more reserved, you simply have to make sure the \nshelter knows what sort of cat you're looking for and they will advise you \naccordingly.",
