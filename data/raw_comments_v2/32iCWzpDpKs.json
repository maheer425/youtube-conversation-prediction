The U.S. prevented a coup from the Tudeh (Soviet Backed \nCommunists) by backing an extremely liberal National/Monarchy based front. \nThe \"democracy\" wasn't legitimate anyway, as the tribal leadership and \nvoting in most rural zones was cut out in favor of the more progressive \nurban centers. Which is why the Tudeh ended up co-opting the government, \nand which pushed the U.S. into action.\n\nIran was going to become someone's puppet--regardless. The U.S. used the \nking to make it America's puppet. It should be noted--the king was VERY \nliberal. And promoted education for women, more workers rights, religious \nfreedom and tolerance. By the 1970's, Iran was very westernized and \nwealthy, actually. Unfortunately, the U.S. also tried to shut out the \ntribal leadership (Which we had used to gain us power in the first \nplace)--and that tribal leadership is where you find the real hardcore \nIslamic elements, which eventually took over the country. But, in 1953? Our \ncoup was definitely the \"better\" of the two--considering the Soviets were \nin the middle of their purges at the time, and killing millions. \n\nSo, in short--usually when America supports an asshole (And we have--oh we \nhave. South Africa, Timor, Argentina ect)...It's because America is trying \nto fuck an even bigger asshole. Since we are only one dick, we have to \nprioritize which asshole is going to produce the most shit.
