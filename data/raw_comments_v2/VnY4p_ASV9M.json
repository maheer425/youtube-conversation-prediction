That movie was so spectacular and \nloaded with so many layers of depth, symbolism, and religious & \nmythological allegories that a lot of the airhead fans of the competition's \nsuperhero movies don't have the sophisticated eye to see the deeper subtext \nwhen watching Man of Steel. Instead, they went into MOS looking for reasons \nto hate it & bash it, so they reach for weak arguments like the amount of \ncity destruction and not enough comedy. This is Superman for God's sake! \nThis is modern day American mythology. It's not supposed to be funny or \nlighthearted. That stuff waters down the material and says both you & your \naudience don't take this seriously. To all you hipsters out there\u2013 Comedy \nin superhero works isn't brilliant; it just says you're so lazy & \ndistracted that you have to have cheap laughs to keep your attention \nfocused and that you can't even take this type of stuff serious for long \nenough to see the layered depth you have to mine the text for. Sorry to go \non a rant like this, but I've been reading comics since the early 90s and \nI'm disturbed by the lighthearted direction I'm seeing the genre go. The \nlast time we did that we got the Adam West Batman show and for many decades \nafterwards we asked ourselves, \"What were we thinking?...\"\ufeff",
