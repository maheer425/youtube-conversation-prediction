Their deaths were not reported because they held low-profile, \nstandard operating jobs.  Thousands of military personel were lost in those \nwars too -- but their deaths were not reported on the news.\n\nSo why did Fox News report (\"hype\") the Benghazi story?  They reported it \nbecause an international assassination had occurred -- it was a 'target \nkilling.'  A US Ambassador is a very high-profile position, plain and \nsimple.  Only five other Ambassadors in American history have ever been \nassassinated, making the Benghazi story an enormous story.  The \ninternational community certainly knows this.\n\nTom Ricks might as well complain that America was shell-shocked by the JFK \nassassination -- but weren't EQUALLY shocked over the Americans who \nsuffered from the Agent Orange disaster.\nIn a very simple way, one life holds far more gravity than the other lives.\nThat is not to say that, \"one is more important than the other\", but a \npolitical leader holds more significance & implication than a 1st \nLieutenant in the Army.\n\nCommon sense, people.

In a new poll from Boston's Suffolk \nUniversity, more than a quarter of the nation says Fox is tops when it \ncomes to who they trust the most, and O'Reilly is the most believable.\n\n\"The key finding is that network news is dying. Some 28 percent of likely \nvoters say that they trust Fox News the most, followed by CNN at 18 \npercent. After that, the trust in TV news nose dives. NBC was third, at 10 \npercent, MSNBC fourth at 7 percent, CBS and ABC tied at fifth with just 6 \npercent.\"\n\nViewer Demographics:\nFox News: 39% Republican, 33% Democratic, 22% Independent\nCNN: 18% Republican, 51% Democratic, 23% Independent\nMSNBC: 18% Republican, 45% Democratic, 27% Independent\ufeff",
