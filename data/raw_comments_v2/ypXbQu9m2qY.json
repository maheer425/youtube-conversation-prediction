You don't have to eat \ninsects whole if you find that too disgusting, at least until you've gotten \nused to them.\n\nWell, they have actually eaten bugs before. Just not intentionally. It's \nimpossible to produce some/all plant foods without some insect fragments \ngetting into the product. There are actually rules stating the maximum \namount of insect fragments allowed in, for instance, chocolate or flour.\n\nI've intentionally eaten mealworms and crickets and I really liked the \ntaste of the crickets (mild taste, similar to nuts or popcorn, crispy \ntexture). The mealworms were crispy thanks to the way I cooked them but \nthey were rather tasteless because I didn't use any spices.\ufeff",
