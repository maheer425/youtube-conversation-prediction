A period actually creates a turbulent atmosphere to kill \noff weak eggs that may have survived otherwise, because really, the process \nof giving birth is really dangerous for women and babies so if we are to \ngive birth we want to know the baby to survive and honestly your body \ndoesn't even want babies.
