After they were engorged with food and sated with \nwine, Capone henchmen jumped them on a prearranged signal and tied them to \ntheir chairs. Screaming furiously, Capone produced the bat and beat the \nthree almost to death; they were each finished off with a gunshot to the \nhead. Their bodies were left on a deserted stretch of road outside of town.\ufeff",

However, \nDe Niro, here, apparently, neglected to interview top batters in baseball \nas well as some gangsters who have actually used bats in their chosen \nprofession.

And it \nwouldn't have mattered whether De Niro used a proper batter's grip or not \nbecause what's important is what Al Capone would have used. Although \nCapone's face bore a slight resemblance to Babe Ruth's, the baseball \ncomparisons end there and Capone didn't have much knowledge of baseball \ngrips and such either. Capone would have used the grip that would have \n\"done the job,\" just as De Niro used in the movie.\n\nI should also point out that the story of Capone and the use of a baseball \nbat at a dinner actually involved Tony Accardo striking three individuals \nat the table who Capone determined were traitors. According to the \nstory, Accardo didn't kill actually them from the blows, and they were \nfinished off by gunshots from Capone's assistants. I believe that Capone \ngave Accardo the nickname \"Joe Batters\"--although most used the nickname \n\"Big Tuna\" for Tony, as I don't think Tony like the \"Batters\" nickname. \nTony Accardo went on to become the Boss in Chicago--where he maintained a \nmuch lower key presence than the Chicago bosses before or since. And while \nruthless, he ruled with remarkable business acumen. Of course, history \nmostly \"remembers\" the flashy Dons, and not the brilliant low key ones like \nTony Accardo.",
