You wait until it dries, which should take 10-20 seconds or \nso, then you apply cement and immediately fasten after cement application. \nYou can pretty much prime the entire project before you cement, which is \nmuch easier. Although, you also probably shouldn't allow the parts to sit \naround forever after being primed as the PVC needs to be chemically active \nin the specific spot you are cementing and rather unfortunately the primer \nwill just continue to diffuse and no longer be \"working\" where you want it \nto.\n\nNow for the science behind WHY this is the case. The primer is made of \nketones and partially of cyclohexanone. The ketones loosen up the long \npolymer chains of PVC and softens it via swelling and partially via \ndissolving, which also makes a rough surface and more surface area. The \ncyclohexanone acts as a lubricating solvent. The primer is supposed to \ndiffuse through the surface layers of the PVC and make the surface ready \nfor the cement. The cement then takes these now loosely packed polymer \nchains and dissolves them further with the same ketones and more \ncyclohexaonone. Once the ketones dissolve what you applied it on, the PVC \nfractional content of the cement starts to cure alongside the dissolved PVC \ncontent. The two parts mix together and , after curing, you now have a \nfully bonded PVC piece that, in theory if everything was done perfectly, is \nonly ONE solid continuous PVC piece rather than the two or more pieces that \nyou had originally.\n\nThe way you describe what is happening makes it sound like you think primer \nand cement are the two parts of epoxy, which is a VERY wrong way of \nthinking about how this reaction works. You might as well not even apply \nprimer as you aren't giving it enough time to work its way through the PVC. \nIf the primer is still wet to touch, then the PVC isn't actually chemically \n\"wet\" yet as the primer hasn't saturated anything yet.\n\nTL;DR;\nYou are wrong Robert Karas. He is right. You might want to actually read \nthe instructions next time. <.<",
