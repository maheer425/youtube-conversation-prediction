I mean \"without intelligible words to some extent\" is a \nlaughable comment.  Also, the nonsense about the dangers of the song \nbecause it wasn't meaningful -- implying this is some sort of new ominous \ntrend of today -- is hilarious as well.  Pop music comes up with \nmeaningless big hits constantly.  MairzyDoats, from 1944, anyone?  (\"Mares \neat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy. A kid'le eat ivy too, \nwouldn't you?).  \"Bird bird bird, bird is the word\" (1963) anyone?  A long, \nrich tradition of absolute nonsense that has hurt no one.  It's not ominous \nor a statement on society, it's \"fun\".  What a concept.  Also, the \nassumption on the part of these wagging tongues on Fox, that absolutely \nnobody has a clue as to the satirical \"meaning\" of the song, such as it is, \nis as relevant and trenchant as O'Reilly pointing out that he's known lots \nof \"Sy's\", and none of them look like this \"little fat guy from Yong Yang\" \n- it's not so much offensive as so damn \"FOX\"-y.

And their explanation is that people, \nand most of the people who liked the song are non-korean speaking people, \nwant songs that don't try to have a deeper meaning. And that this is why a \nkorean song with a good beat and a chorus that is catchy even when you \ndon't understand it, could become so popular. I further think that they \ndon't take care to mention that they are talking about non-korean speaking \npeople because, as you probably know, Fox News does not care about anyone \nexcept english speaking americans. I'm not really sure if Bill O'Reilly, in \ngeneral, really is stupid; or if he is just willfully ignorant and lies a \nlot; but I do think that believing that he does not understand that the \nsong is in a different language is underestimating EVEN him.\n\n+Ovo124  I'm not really sure what you are reacting to. All I said about \nsongs in a different language was that people seem to like some of them \ndespite the fact that they do not understand the lyrics.
