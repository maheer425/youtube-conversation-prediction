(I like Declan) And I sat there, finishing my project, and crying. She \ndidn't even notice. She just sat there laughing with her friends while I \ncried. I was dying inside. She always says stuff like: \"Oh don't worry I'm \nhere for you! I'll be here, and you shouldn't be sad.\" And then she leaves \nme to go with her friends...ugh. There's 15 other people who do this to me \nand break my heart.\ufeff",
