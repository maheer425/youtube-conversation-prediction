These games are paid \n(here is the main site if you want to try http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/), \nbut since it is nearly impossible to buy them outside of Japan, here is a \nsite with downloads of many Touhou Games: http://moriyashrine.weebly.com/\n\nRemember, Easy Mode is for kids. Stay away from it if you want to evolve \ninto Touhou, or it may get you into some bad-habits like not using Bombs :P",
