I like organising those, more than 10 years of experience, and \nI would like to do something for Nerdfighteria. \nThe idea is that everybody pays a small amout to take part for the whole \nseason, e.g. 10 dollars (we'll decide as a group later), then we give the \nlion's share of that money to charity, e.g. the P4A (also, of course, group \ndecision) and use the rest either simply as prize money or to buy an actual \ntrophy. I will use a page like payitsquare or groupay (feel free to suggest \nbetter) to collect the money so that you can see at all time how much money \nthere is and where it is going, not a cent will go to me\nThe game itself is simple. You predict the results of upcoming Premier \nLeague games, if you pick the correct winner/draw you get points, if even \nyour result is spot on, you get more points.\nI would probably do it through a German site called kicktipp.de, because \nit's free and easy and has multiple language versions. But tell me if you \nthink you know a better site.\n(John and Hank, if you join, I bet you another 20 dollars for the charity \nof your choice that I'll beat you!)\nTell me if you're interested via comment or PM. And tell other people!\nI will post this message on quite a few videos now, so that many people \nwill see it. Sorry for the spam.\n\nDFTBA\nHenning aka Nabend1402\ufeff",

I've been \nin an almost 2 year battle/struggle againsf a rare sarcoma, I've done the \nconventional treatments... 3 different chemo regimens tried \nconsequsatively, ie 1 trwatment fails or makes cancer worse, change to next \ndrug on the list... after the 3rd failed chemo... well it worked, but I had \nan allergic reaction to it. :( then 6 weeks of radiation, which sucked in \nwas I can't explain and the worst part was the fact that it had slim to no \nresponse.. talk about severe disappointment! I decided to take a few months \noff from doing active treatments... you get to a point where you lose the \nreason behind the fighting so hard... at the end of my brief break, my \ncancer startex growing again and my options where just about nil... save \nfor 2 treatments... the first being a clinical trial and the otber being a \nreally tough cytotoxic chemo combo.... I did a ton of work and pleaded my \ncase with the study doctors and I got in! <- That is what donations for \ncancer research looks like and clinical trials exist for all kinds of \ndiseases.... I just want you and my fellow nerdfighters know that donations \nto places like the Sarcoma Alliance or the American Cancer Society really \ndo a *LOT* of good!\n\nThanks to everyone for being awesome! <3 <3 <3\ufeff",

There's a good chemo \nprotocol established, but they need more research about what to do after. \n It seems like everywhere you look people are trying to help with breast \ncancer (and that's awesome), but it's important not to forget the other \ncancers out there.
