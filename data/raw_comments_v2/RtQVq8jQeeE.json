The truth is, these questions do get asked by white people. The \nquestions stem from stereotypes either put in place by other races or black \npeople themselves. Growing out around my white friends, I did get asked \nsilly questions like \" Why do all black people hold their guns sideways?\", \nwhen I did not own a gun or if I was in school and a black man happened to \nbe around for whatever reason, I would be asked if he was my dad or \nbrother. Instead of negatively reacting, Scooter has turned this into \nsomething funny that we all enjoy. Maybe you didnt like his impersonations \nof white people. But there is no need to start disecting racial history or \ncategorizing what type of black or white you are. Its just not that serious \nand if you think it is then go watch a documentary on race. For the white \npeople who watched this video and immediately said something racist about \n\"niggers\" or going back to Africa or blah blah, can you honestly say that \nyou haven't asked any of these questions? If you have, then its ok. We all \nbleed red. \ufeff",
