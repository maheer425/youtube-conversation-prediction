Or even dislike there choice, but still \nlove your child and let them be who they are?.\nWould you rather a person kill themselfs, when they have not yet have \nexperienced life for who they are? It is not a choice to be gay or \nbisexual, but who you are really. Now imagine if you were in there shoes? \nHow would you feel if your mother or father or anyone hurt you nearly every \nsingle day for being who hou are? Yes there are people lile that in the \nworld. But do theu honetly deserve it? Being beaten down, beimg called a \nnussiance to the world.
