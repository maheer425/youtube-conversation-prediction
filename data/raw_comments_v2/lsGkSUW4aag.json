What laws would those be? Are you \nreferring to having a kid? Let me make one thing very clear to you fuck \nstain, having a kid DOES NOT make you a better person than anyone. It does \nnot make you smarter, nor do you help out the species as a whole. Also, do \nnot confuse my not wanting to sleep with a woman because I'm not attracted \nto them, with not being able to reproduce. I can do that just fine. So \nagain, you aren't special because you forgot to use a condom.\n\nAnd no, I don't WANT to be gay, I AM gay, there is a difference and I hope \nyou get that. I did not choose to be gay, nor did you choose to be \nstraight. And no its not bullshit, it is indeed normal, you are just the \nignorant one.\n\nDid you just compare homosexuality with a mental disability? Really? It \nsounds to me you went full retard. Almost EVERY scientist and Doctor in the \nworld doesn't believe that homosexuality is a mental disorder. But hey, I'm \nsure you have spent YEARS studying up on the minds of homosexuals and \nbacked your idiotic opinion with piles of research that will change \neverything science has learned about homosexuality, right?  \n\nNo you don't give us rights. Hence the whole having to fight for our right \nto marry bullshit. That is not a right for you to give anyways. That is our \nright to have simply for being a law abiding, tax paying citizen of the \nUSA. You don't get to take that from us just because you don't think its \nnormal. Asshole.\n\n\" Without the support of the 97% (normal), you'd all be strung up.\" Oh that \nsounds an awful lot like a threat there boyo. You sound really big hiding \nbehind that computer of yours, you bitch. What are you fucking Hitler? You \ngoing to start rounding us gays up like the Jews? But hey, if that is going \nto be your course of action, I say, bring it on. Over 60% of people in the \nUSA side with Homosexual rights. The other 40% has a majority of people \nover the age of 35, and I'm liking those odds.\n\nAll the semen in the world when injected into a vagina will not produce a \nbaby. Its only when the semen fertilizes an egg, which is produced by the \novaries does a child conceive. A lot of women over the age of 40 CAN'T have \nkids, no matter how much you fill her with your baby gravy. So again, \nhaving a kid does not make you special. And side note, thank god.\n\n\"This means that the asshole is not a sexual organ; it's the place the body \nexcretes waste.\" You know that sounds familiar. What else excretes waste? \nOh right the Vagina and Penis! That is so weird! Isn't that weird guys?\n\nUmm, no that comparison is wrong. The Sexual stimulation of the G-spot can \nnot be compared to a punch to the kidneys. That's like comparing a massage \nto a beating. I thought we agreed we weren't going full retard.\n\nIts' one thing for hetero's to justify their sexual orientation; it's \nnormal for people to want to feel normal. It's a whole different level of \nretard to try to convince homosexuals that the attraction between a male \nand female is somehow normal.",

We give you \nyour rights, and let you exist among us, but stop trying to pawn your \nbullshit off as what's normal. Yes, I said we give you your rights...

At any time, if \nsociety decides to start blaming certain groups for all of our social ills, \nhomosexuals are going to be at the top of that list. Think about that for a \nminute before you decide to start telling people what sexual normal is. \nNow..all of the semen in the world injected into someone's asshole will not \nproduce a baby. You can not procreate through anal sex. This means that the \nasshole is not a sexual organ; it's the place the body excretes waste. \nYou're uninformed reference to the male \"g spot\" is actually the prostate \ngland, where semen is stored. Pushing on it will produce semen in the same \nway that punching you in the back where the kidneys are, will produce blood \nin your piss. It's not a gland inside the rectum, in the same way that your \nkidneys are not on the outside of your back.
