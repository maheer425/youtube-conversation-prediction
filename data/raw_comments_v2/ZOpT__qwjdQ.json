Singed is mostly passive with one main goal: to roam around \nhis opponents and fleing with them behind him. A rework i came up with \nmakes him focus more on where and when to place his abilities and what to \nprioritizeand how.\n\nq: singeds next basic attack deal bonus damage and apply a poison trail on \nthe target for 5 seconds, enemies within this trail take damage and the \ncooldown is 5 seconds. If singed DOESN'T hit an enemy it will cause a cloud \nof smoke come out on singed current location that is as big as cassiopeias \npoison, if singed leaves this cloud he will have a poison trail after him \nfor 7 seconds, cooldown starts once he leaves the cloud and is on 15 \nseconds.\n\nw: his slow is as usual but if he land his e on an enemy who is on the slow \nthen they will get a overtime burn on them for 3 seconds.\n\nhis e stays as it is.\n\nhis ulti stays to.\n\nThis playstyle makes singed think of not only one way to damage but also \nwhen and this makes opponents think to either run into the slow and take \nburn when thrown or to just wait and get thrown. His new q allows him to \napply his trail on multiple opponents and roam as usual from target to \ntarget but need to think on who to place the trail on. This makes opponents \nnot only to not chase their allies but also watch out to chase singed when \nsomebody is already chasing who is carrying the poison trail, or Singed \nsimply wait and cause a big damage cloud during team fights that allow him \nto use his normal poison trail afterwards when he usually run away or \naround. He wait for his q to pop and it deal damage during fights and while \nhe runs the trail is still on for 7 seconds so some still feel like Singed. \nAdapted to more action gameplay rather then passive like Heimer was and it \nstill main the poison trail as his main damage tool only more expanded to \neither apply to the area and himself or to spread the joy to his enemies so \nthey can share it with their allies when fleing.\ufeff",
