She will end up holding it in, no matter how long we are outside, \nthen going toilet as soon as we go back inside. She will even hold it in so \nlong that she gets agitated, and clearly wants to go, but refuses to. When \nshe gets agitated we will usually give in and let her in.\n\nHow can we encourage her to go outside rather than in? At the moment she \ndoesn't go outside at all so can't treat or reward her when going outside \nto teach her that this is the right behaviour.\n\nThanks\ufeff",

Don't \njust let her walk around the yard.  Take her to the spots you want her to \ngo.  \n\nAnd, no matter what, NEVER scold her for peeing in the house.  If you do \nthat, she will fear pottying in your presence.  Another thing you can try \nis taking the potty pad outside (if you use them at all).  When she goes \noutside...treat and praise like she's won the nobel peace prize!\n\nYou can also put her back in the crate for 5 mins if she doesn't go outside \nand then take her out again.  By letting her come in, you are reinforcing \nthe behavior of potty inside.",

I do walk my dog 2 times a day and my \nmother or sister will give him a short walk at some point in the day. I \ntake very good care of him in training, playing, grooming, socializing, \netc. I also regularly volunteer at a dog rescue and have worked on training \ndogs there, although the inconsistency of having a bunch of different \nwalkers at once makes the process more difficult. I also trained my \nneighbors dog and walk him with mine. They rarely seemed to walk their dog \nand didn't want me to take him because he is a strong puller but I worked \non it with him and now he's fine. I'm only watching this video to get a \nrefresher on potty training because while my shelter is moving they need \nfosters and I figured I would work with the pup when I foster her. So I \nguess that is my \"expertise\" although when you say that I assume you mean \nprofessional which I have none of.

If you want him to stop, try to \nget him to pee/poop on like a potty pallet and try as hard as you can to \nget rid of the smell (the areas he has pooped/peed at) and once you've got \nhim to pee on the pallet, have him use the pallet a few more times (use 3 \nabout for he doesnt miss) and then take the pallet outside and place it \nwhere you want him to always pee near.

I \ntook him outside about every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and after the second day he \nbegan to go to the door when he needed to pee or poo. I gave him a treat \nwhen he pooed and showed him how to scratch at the door. I had newspaper at \nthe door for a couple of weeks in case I couldn't get there in time but \nstill had only one or two pee accidents and he's never pooed in the house. \nDon't know what she's talking about it taking weeks to train. All it takes \nis consistency and patience on the part of the owner.",
