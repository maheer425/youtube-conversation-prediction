            "text": "This royal sycophant laughably attempts to substantiate their claim with an \nabsurdly pro-monarchist clip on Youtube, in which a \u00a3160 million a year \n\"net benefit\" to the UK economy was claimed. That's the figure I'm going to \nconsider in this article.\n\nBefore I get around to discrediting this \u00a3160 million figure as the \nnonsense that it is, lets first assume for a while that it is true. \u00a3160 \nmillion may sound like a lot of cash, but in perspective it's a piddlingly \nsmall amount given the enormous assets at royal disposal and the size of \nthe UK economy. To put this alleged \"net contribution\" into context:\n\u00a3160 million is just 1.2% of the Queen's estimated net worth.\n\u00a3160 million is just 0.01% of UK GDP (which was \u00a31.54 trillion in 2012)\n\u00a3160 million is just 0.02% of UK government expenditure in 2012 (\u00a3682 \nbillion)\n\u00a3160 million is just 0.007% of the total UK national debt (which stands at \n\u00a32.33 trillion if financial sector bailouts are included, as they should \nbe).\nThe Queen is by far the biggest landowner in the world with 6.6 billion \nacres to her name (the next biggest landowner in the world is King Abdullah \nof Saudi Arabia with 830 million acres, just 12% of the Queen's land \nportfolio). In the UK, the Crown Estates' 384,000 acre landholding is \nestimated to be worth at least \u00a38-10 billion, whilst the Duchy of Cornwall \n(another separate estate which has been run since 1377 for the benefit of \nthe heir to the throne) consists of 133,000 acres, now worth an estimated \n\u00a31.5 billion. Aside from the Royal property portfolios, vast swathes of the \nUK are still owned by the descendants of the aristocratic classes that were \ngifted huge tracts of stolen land by the royal family over the centuries \n(but that's another story).\n\nIf all the royal estates are added together this gives the royal family the \nthird biggest land holding in the entire country after the Forestry \nCommission and the Ministry of Defence. This property portfolio includes \nsome of the most potentially valuable buildings in the entire country and \neven half of the UK coastal seabed (which comes in quite handy if the \ngovernment decides to pay you heaps of cash to build a load of offshore \nwindfarms there).\n\nDoes it not seem a little odd that the royalist crowd are trying to cheer a \npiddling net contribution of just 1/5,000th of current UK government \nexpenditure, from what is undoubtedly the largest private landholding in \nthe country? Is it not even remotely possible that the Crown Estate, the \nDuchy of Cornwall and the various other property assets in the royal \nportfolio could be put to much more efficient economic usage than they are \ncurrently? \n\nAnother factor worthy of consideration before I get around to discrediting \nthe claimed \u00a3160 million \"net benefit\" is that the only people who could \npossibly be convinced that a contribution of just 0.02% of government \nexpenditure represents a good deal, are those that are fervorent supporters \nof the institution of monarchy. Other people that are capable of putting \nthis supposed contribution into context and considering whether the \nmaintenance of such anachronistic inequality have social costs that \noutweigh the claimed financial benefits, are less likely to consider this a \ngood deal. Put simply, people that cite this kind of fabricated evidence \nare the kind of people that know the price of everything and the value of \nnothing. \n\nIn order to generate their \u00a3160 million figure, the royal apologist likes \nto add income generated from tourism into the mix, however they carefully \nexclude the possibility that tourism revenues could actually be massively \nincreased by opening up the royal palaces to tourism (making one of them \nthe most uber-exclusive hotel in the entire world perhaps). The Palace of \nVersailles is the single most lucrative tourist attraction in France, it's \nhard to imagine that it would generate quite as much revenue if it were \nstill a private monarchical residence.\n\nImagine if the Crown Estate were privatised; carved up and sold off to the \nprivate sector like so many of our (actually quite useful) public services \nhave been over the last three decades. How much do you think might be \nraised through the sale of over half a million acres of land, all those \ncastles and palaces, and all that treasure? If just 1% of it per year were \nprivatised, that would raise far more than this imaginary net contribution \nof \u00a3160 million.\n\nAnother factor that the royal apologist neglects to include in their \ncalculations is that the royal estates are not subject to inheritance tax \n(like the assets of most wealthy people are). Surely the vast amounts of \ninheritance tax that the royal family will avoid when the Queen dies should \nbe subtracted from the pie-in-the-sky \u00a3160 million figure? The net worth of \nthe Queen is estimated to be \u00a313 billion, so the \u00a35.2 billion in \ninheritance tax bill they will avoid (around \u00a387 million a year for every \nsingle year of her reign to date) should surely be subtracted from this \nsupposed royal \"net contribution\".\n\nAnother factor to consider is the secretive powers the royal family have to \nmanipulate government legislation to their own advantage. The Guardian \ntried for years to reveal the truth about these anti-democratic \ninterventions but their Freedom of Information requests into what kind of \ninsidious influence the royal family have had over parliamentary \nlegislation were quashed by the Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve using \na rarely used power of veto and the absurd justification that the contents \nmust remain secret because they could ruin the public perception of Prince \nCharles' political neutrality and \"seriously damage his future role as \nking\"! So according to Tory party logic, the public mustn't be allowed to \nknow how the royal family have undermined democracy to further their own \ninterests, because if they did know, they would be so outraged by the \nrevelations that the royal family might fall as a consequence!\n\nOne must wonder what a secretive veto over parliamentary legislation could \nbe worth in financial terms. It is clearly impossible to subtract the \nfinancial benefit of a secretive legislative veto from the supposed \"net \nbenefit\" the royals provide, since the government won't even disclose what \nlaws have been tampered with, let alone in what ways. If it is impossible \nto know exactly how the royals have benefited from such anti-democratic \nmeddling, it's also impossible to estimate how much financial harm may have \nbeen inflicted on the wider UK economy simply in order to appease royal \nwhims.\n\nIn January 2011, shortly after the ridiculous decision to veto disclosure \nof these anti-democratic royal interventions on the most spurious of \ngrounds, the Tory party introduced new legislation to exempt the royal \nfamily and their staff from the Freedom of Information Act entirely. Even \nif disclosure would clearly be in the public interest, the Tories have now \nhidden the royal finances and their political interferences behind an \nimpenetrable veil of secrecy. Here's what the former member of the Public \nAccounts Committee Ian Davidson said:\n\"I'm astonished that the Tory led Government should find time to seek to \ncover up royal finances. When I was on the PAC, what we wanted was more \ndisclosure not less ... Every time we examined royal finances we found \nextravagance and indulgence as well as abuse of expenses by junior royals \n... Everywhere we looked, there were savings to be made for the Government. \nThis sends the wrong message about public disclosure and accountability.\"\nOne must wonder why such a conspicuous veil of secrecy over the royal \nfinances is necessary. If the royal family really are the \"net \ncontributors\" that royal sycophants endlessly claim that they are, then \nsurely they should be proud to demonstrate their \"net contribution\" in an \naccountable manner, rather than deliberately hiding it from public scrutiny.\n\nGiven the exemption from inheritance tax, the extremely dubious \"increased \ntourism\" claims, the secretive powers to influence parliamentary \nlegislation and the cloak of official secrecy over the royal finances, I \nbelieve the only people who would actually be taken in by the fantastical \n\u00a3160 million \"net benefit\" figure would be intellectually lazy ideological \nroyalists in search of some big looking numbers to feed into their personal \nconfirmation biases.\ufeff",

So certainly there is some \ninjustice when your system of government requires you to keep a precious \nold white lady and her spoiled-rotten kids in comical opulence while a \nthird of your country has substandard living arrangements, if not no \nhousehold at all.  Ironically, said 33% *pays the Crown* money.  And that \nfew coins CGP put in his illustration?  That's just the Crown's private \nsalary.  That doesn't include a multitude of the other expenses of \nmaintaining a monarch, like the 102 million dollars a year in security that \nfollows the queen and all her relatives, the cost of royal visits, etc. For \nmore information check this. \nhttp://republic.org.uk/sites/default/files/wortheverypenny.pdf  The \nmonarchy doesn't make the UK money, it robs it.

They go because Harry Potter happens here, or Doctor Who, or \nbecause of the White Cliffs of Dover and all the kinds of scenery you dont \nget in America, or because they want to eat in a chip shop and find out \nwhat a cheeky Nando's is.  People like Britain for Britain, not it's system \nof government.\n\nAlso, claiming the crown doesn't have any real power is a bit untruthyish. \n While I agree that the crown doesn't use much of the power that it COULD \nuse, it still has LOTS of unofficial influence (if the queen walked into a \npie shop you bet she could get all the pies for free) and it is commander \nin chief of the armed forces!  Plus, it *really is the principle of the \nthing.*  Feudalism should've ended with the signing of the Magna Carta. \n You can dress it up as a constitutional monarchy all you want, but in the \nend you still have a particular family that is put on a pedestal above the \nrest of the population, not because of merit but because of bloodline.
