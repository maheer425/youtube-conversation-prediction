She is graduating high school \nin a few weeks and needs to do a chemistry demo for her AP chem class.  I \nwas wondering if you could suggest one for her?  That would be a really \ncool surprise for her.  Also wanted to mention she will be attending the \nUniversity of Scranton as a Bio major.  When we went for our tour, they had \nHank's videos playing on a loop in the Science building all day.  She got \nsuch a kick out of that.  Thanks\ufeff",
