When I got him as a kitten, he already had nerve damage \nto his left front leg which made his paw bend like the end of a golf club \nor hockey stick. It sure doesn't slow him down any, he can get around with \nno problem and loves hanging out on top of my fridge, but since he couldn't \ncontrol those claws he kept getting them caught in his scratching post. \nSometimes he'd wind up dragging his post across the floor before I could \nmake it to him and help get his claws free. I was worried getting stuck \nlike that wouldn't be good for his leg, so I had that one paw declawed and \nhe hasn't had any trouble with his post since then. Due to his disability \nTimothy's an indoor cat, but just in case he ever manages to get out he \nstill has three good clawed paws to work with if ever he needs to defend \nhimself.\ufeff",

My cat was feral before we got her with time and handling we no \nlonger had to take her to the vet to have her nails clipped I could do it \nmyself. If you're worried about your furniture they have scratching posts \nas well as double sided tape that can help discourage clawing furniture. My \ncat kept doing it to my moms favorite chair so I bought a vertical scratch \npost and set it against the spot she always clawed and as she started using \nthat I gradually moved it away from the couch. People who declaw are \nlooking for an instant solution or they don't know better. If you're scared \nof handling your cat yourself one you need to work on trust between \nyourself and the gag and two you can take the cat to the vet to have them \nbathed and clipped by people who know how to safely handle aggressive cats. \nWe did that with my sisters cat too because we couldn't handle her with my \nsister being gone in the military and it want expensive. \ufeff",

He wasn't my cat at the time, but I knew \nhim, and I think in this case, it was probably the best option. He lived \nwith two older cats with declining health, both declawed, during his \nadolescence in a mostly unsupervised home. He laid such a beating on the \ntwo of them and they, having no claws, were basically defenseless. I can't \nthink of another way to have solved that problem without having to confine \none or all of the cats all day. The real answer would have been not \ndeclawing the other two cats, but their owner didn't have much education on \nthat. He did have some minor litter box issues, but he's well past them \nnow, and I'm doing my best to make sure the rest of his life is as happy \nand painless as possible.\ufeff",

But \nas far as de-clawing and spaying/neutering being equally wrong, I don't see \nhow the two are comparable at all. First of all, de-clawing directly \nimpacts the quality of life for a cat, whereas the spaying and neutering of \nan animal, as far as short term physiological and psychological effects \ngoes, only stops their yearning for genetic propagation and the obvious \nability to do so. It's definitely a topic for discussion, but comparing \nde-clawing to spaying/neutering can both downplay how destructive \nde-clawing can be, and makes spaying and neutering seem equally deplorable \nas de-clawing.",

            "text": "Us against declawing will not be berated into agreeing with a Pro-Declaw \nstance. We have no issues holding a respectful discussion and exchanging \nfacts. However there is a certain point where reasoning between both sides \ndoes not happen. Your opinion for declawing has been heard. That is why \ncountries still do this. Just because your cats have not had issues that \nyou are aware of does not mean it should be accepted. Just look to history \nto realize some of the most barbaric, inhumane actions that have shown \npartial proof of success were still accepted by society for many years.\nSome points we would like to address:\n1. Banning declawing will raise the rate of homelessness, displaced, \nabused, abandoned and euthanized cats:\nYes it is true some people do not like cats scratching their furniture. But \nthere are alternatives to declawing. There are thousands of declawed cats \nin rescues and shelters across the United States alone. Apparently being \ndeclawed did not save them from this fate. So how is this a valid point of \na Pro-Declaw stance? If someone is going to abandon an animal please know \nthat any excuse will do. \nA majority of people who own cats do love cats. When getting a cat you \naccept things. The same can be said of any animal. Animals can be trained \nand behavior can be changed. And honestly even when behavior is not changed \na majority of us will accept this \"fault\" because we love our animals as a \nwhole. Once you begin to allow changes to an animal you bring so much in \nquestion. If we accept this than we believe any alteration to an animal \nthat is beneficial for the owner is acceptable with no regards to the \nanimal. If you want a particular kind of animal that does not do certain \nthings there are many other options. \nIf you medically need to own a declawed cat, which in some cases elderly \nand people with weakened immune systems or thin blood, may feel it is the \nonly choice then please adopt one! There are so many out there waiting for \nyou and that need a home.\nIf someone is going to abuse an animal for doing something that comes \nnaturally then anything the animal does may leave them opened to abuse. \nClaiming one thing will lead to abuse is not acceptable. An abuser will \nabuse without reason needed because they are abuser.\n2. Spay/Neuter surgery is on the same level as declawing.\nSpay/Neuter is not only beneficial to you and the pet population but it is \nalso beneficial to your animal. Animals that are fixed not only live \nlonger, but they are less likely to get certain diseases and illnesses. \nDeclawing is truly only beneficial to one party. It is an unneeded surgery \nthat puts your cat at risk. And yes there are risks with any operations, \nhowever in some surgeries the benefits outweigh the risks.\n3. The horror stories you hear are such a small percent of declawing, \ntherefore the majority of declawing is successful and needed:\nSo as long as just a few suffer this is ok? The mentality of this argument \njust does not make sense. It is more than a few cats that suffer after \nbeing declawed. And we go back to why risk it when there are alternatives \nwe can use to avoid it?\n4. My Vet says it is totally safe:\nGet a new Vet as soon as possible. If your Vet is not upfront with the \nrisks and possibilities of issues your animal may have for ANY procedure \nthen they care more about your money than your animal. A good Vet will be \nupfront with you, voice any concerns, go into details and be realistic with \nyou. If your Vet does not do this then you are cheating your animal and \nalso yourself. A good Vet will care about the well being of your animal. \nAnd in some cases actually be cheaper than a Vet who is only in it to make \nprofit.\n5. Declawing would already be banned everywhere if it was truly barbaric \nand inhumane:\nAgain please refer to history. So many tragedies, injustices, and \nill-informed procedures were considered the normal until someone stood up \nand spoke against them. Once more just because things are accepted by \nsociety does not make them right.\nWe can go on and on addressing points we consider true myths of declawing. \nHowever it is up to you as a human being to make an informed decision. We \nhave chosen compassion over convenience as our stance. And at the end of \nthe day we can live with our decision. If you end up being one of the \"few\" \nthat mutilate, disfigured, maimed or scarred your cat for life can you live \nwith yours?\ufeff",

It has been banned in \nmy country and the countries around it, and I really wish every other \ncountry would do the same. And no, cats in shelters here are not euthanised \neither, so even if a person gets rid of their cat, the shelter will find \nthem a good home with sane owners, even if it takes a year (I know, I owned \na shelter cat and some of the cats were there for a year, leading \nrelatively good lives. Last time I checked all of them had been adopted!). \nThat's a different matter though, sorry for going off topic.\n\nCan't stand your cat acting like a cat? Get an ant farm or something.\ufeff",
