I loved it there just as you loved getting foos there too... Different name but same favorite gathering... Love the co-winky-dinks! I played video games and had pizza there, you had your favotitefood there... I felt so close to you. It&#39;s such a good feeling... I love you Jas... \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude19<br />I just saw your page online letter and I&#39;m so confused. My mom and sisrter have a way of confusing me (they think they are so much better?). I am really so confused. One day they tell me so many lies ablut you, that you are not my daughter and say I&#39;m a fool for believing the 9 to 14 tests i took... ALL PROVING my paternity... Now my sister is pregnant... That may be a clue to me. She hates me when she is pregnant... But my mom it seems is suffering just as your grandmother, from i dont know what its called... Forgetfulness... Brain chmicals turning off... She is so sure of one memory and its wrong... Anyway. My mom and my sister try to steal you from me and make me feel bad fkr using your mom... You understand how your mon used me... So much nicer than how she used you. And then recently I was at my sisters house and she and my mom sere acting as if you guys were best friends... I&#39;m so confused. My parents and brother and sister are abandoning me it seems... Similar to what it sounds like you went through... Family wise... It feels strange our similarities in life...<br />Ok bottom line, I have heard many different stories from lunatic mom and psycho bixch Jamie... About first you staying in college and mastering aloadof classes no major. Then how you were on your last semester and thinking about marriage and kids and ... And annother story next time... I love you. What are you doing now or soon or for as long as you can? Its wierd, but you and i seem to have so much jn common.   I raised you the same way i was brought op... We were left on our own and our loved ones have used us but we tried tocounferact and go under cover... Its same for. Me. You are SO COOL!!! <br />Ok main questikn as i have talked around... Whats&#39; up? School? Marriage? Library work? Marriage? Him going to school you mom? Friends/enemies Jamie or my mom? Can you please. Me the truth? <br />I LOVE YOU JASMINE LEA. I love you.

For a while last year and the beginning of this year, I suffered \nfrom depression. For a while I was self-harming and I wasn't in a good \nmental space. I was scrolling though youtube looking for videos that might \nhelp me feel better, when your video on Middle School Misery popped up. \nNow, I, like you stated in this video, was bullied constantly. I was forced \nto eat alone at lunch and someone actually carved 'jamie is a lesbian \nhooker' into my desk at school. (lets move onto the happy stuff). What you \nsaid about how 'everyone telling you that it does get better, you don't \nwant to believe it because it isn't getting better the moment you are \nliving it' is incredibly true. You made me understand that all these people \naround me were doing what was best for me, I was just too ignorant to see \nit.  Watching you and Hank every Tuesday and Friday were the best moments \nof my week. One night when I was particularly upset, I watched your Esther \nday. It gave to the strength to tell my parent what was happening at \nschool. They allowed me to switch school, leaving me the happiest I have \never been. (You probably aren't that interested in my personal life so here \nis the over-all: you kept me alive and I can not thank you enough for \nthat.)\ufeff",

They are perfectly acceptable for \nanyone who hasn't been bullied, but those who have, recognize the amount of \nbaloney that they are. Im not going to get into the number of reasons why, \njust the point that this was a convenient time to re-watch this because the \nlessons were this week and it has been on and off of my mind since. Im a \nSenior in High School now, but on and off until 10th grade I was bullied, \nsome grades it was pretty bad, I spent most of 5th grade hiding from my \npeers in the bathroom, reading. Im glad to have grown from it though, and \ngained experience, because I also met one of the best friends I could ever \nhave, because she defended me.  During the second set of lessons a girl a \ncouple seats in front of me decided to share her voice that the Victims, \n\"just need to suck it up\", and even that \"Its their choice to be bullied\" \nBecause they don't avoid it or change or defend or whatever. We ended up \n(peacefully) going back and forth for a while. One of the points later \nbrought up was \"Why is it any of our business\" and I realized how much \nnerdfighteria has influenced me. Its our business because we are a society \nof human beings, it is our job as a society. Because our conscience  is one \nof the things that separate us as humans. Because no one deserves to hate \nthemselves, and no on deserves to feel like their only way to gain \n\"respect\" is the cruel ways the bully's gain it. This didn't exist then, \nbut I wish I could send this video to 5th and 9th grade me. The words seem \nto live on forever, even after you realize the reality of them.\ufeff",

Most of my other \nclassmates aren't really bullying me but are all doing little things that \nbuild up and make me feel like I am worth nothing. I am not worth nothing. \nAnd neither are you. Talk to someone. Your mother, father, or any family \nmember. Or one of your friends. Or the school counselor. Or maybe some \nstranger you trust or have something in common with on the Internet. \nSomeone. Anyone. Talking may be hard, but it helps. It really does (See? \nI'm doing it now and it is helping me). I got into fights in middle school, \nand trust me, you do not want that. Find a group of kids in school that you \ncan relate to. No matter how small. Find a way to relieve stress (just as \nlong as bullying others or fighting isn't involved). Whatever you do, don't \nthink that now is the best time of your life. You have 60 or more years \nahead of you. Embrace those years. Life is too long for you to think you \nwill amount to nothing.\ufeff",
