The pharaohs may or may not have been worshiped as god kings, \neither way it's irrelevant, because the tombs (pyramids) weren't meant to \nbe a symbol of their divinity but rather a symbol of their status and power \nas well as a \"portal\" to the afterlife.\ufeff",

He's not pro-war, or \npro-money.

If you just spent a ton of money on micro-technology you would \nhave microprocessors etc... Next... let's just say you are right... Lets \nsay you really do need space exploration for a laptop... well guess what... \nmy broken arm is a much larger issue than having a laptop. Lastly it \nprobably isn't profitable. It costs billions to launch 1 rocket. At this \npoint in time it's still a million times easier to dig deep in earth than \nlaunch a rocket.. + you gotta add the cost of all the equipment needed to \nextract stuff.\n + rockets crash. I would say space exploration would be a worthwhile \nendeavor BEFORE we learned there is no nearby intelligent aliens, or super \nawesome planets we could live on. But it's not worthwhile anymore. If you \nwere on some island it's worth exploring, but if all you find is just water \nfor a million miles, and you don't have a boat that can go any further it's \nstupid to waste time exploring",

Mars actually has all of the natural resources needed \nto construct a viable human civilization.  Did I mention that there IS in \nfact water on Mars?  There was water on Mars before there was water on the \nEarth, that means it probably had life before we did.  Experts say the \nchance of finding life on Mars is over 50%.  Europa, and Enceladus both \nprobably have liquid water on them, which also means they both probably \nhave, and can sustain life (so we might be able to live there)  \nIt's true, investments in other fields of science could be more effective, \nand lucrative now, but space is revolutionary.  Do you know how many things \nyou have in your house that were at least somewhat a product of the space \nrace? Your smoke detector was originally made for the space station, \nlaptops were invented so astronauts could move more freely with computers, \nnow you like TV, right? Thank the space race for your Satellite TV.  You \nwere talking about healthcare? Ever heard of Telemedicine? Space race. GPS \nSpace Race. I'm just pointing out that going to space has huge byproducts. \n Back to your original comment: \"space is dumb...\", \"..let's just forget \nabout it.\". I don't know how space could be smart (although some people are \ntheorizing that the universe is actually a consciousness), so I don't think \nit could be dumb either.  We should not forget about space, but lets say we \ndid: lets not send anymore sattelites up there, so you can have nice \ndirections to wherever you want to go, because no more GPS, lets just \nignore the Moon (which helps tidal cycle)  Let's just ignore what might be \nout there.  There might be primitive life on Europa or Enceladus, heck some \nscientists have even proposed the existence of life in the clouds of \nVenus(where it isn't as hot).  You don't wanna know where everything came \nfrom, what might be out there?

This produces a \nproblem in the U.S. today, because Republican ideas forbid a government to \nmake money off anything or \"own\" anything, but they also don't want a \ngovernment to have taxes and they also don't want a government to have \ndeficits. In short, republicans only want governments to give money to big \nbusinesses, but they forbid the government to make money from any source. \nOf course this is unreasonable, but it's what they really want.\n\nA practical government in the 21st century should own solar and wind farms. \nI said \"own\". Not lease or give permits. By cutting out the middle-men of \ncapitalistic energy corporations, the government could provide cheaper, \ncleaner energy at a lower cost, and still make \"tax revenue\" in the form of \na 10% profit margin. The total cost to consumers would be less, and such \nenergy farms can grow exponentially through re-investments.\n\nThis is what a practical civilization would do, and it in no way violates \nhuman rights.\n\nAn acre of solar panels can collect as much energy in 3 days as is \ncollected in Ethanol from Corn in an entire growing season. Yet our nation \nwastes nearly half of it's farmland on producing Ethanol...\n\nIf the U.S. government bought up land and made solar farms, it could \nproduce so much energy we could profit by exporting energy at no long-term \nresource cost. instead we import oil by the billions of barrels.\ufeff",

The general consensus is that the \nscientific \"gains\" of the space program were hardly justified by the money \nbudgeted to the program.\n\nScientific study and exploration is extraordinarily important; so is \nproviding a reasonable standard of living for citizens.

I remember watching the Apollo 11 moon landing in \n1969. Where were you? As a kid growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, the space \nprogram was a source of wonder AND pride that my country had landed men on \nthe moon, and that human beings had been there, walked around, and \nincreased our knowledge of the universe in many areas of science. But the \nApollo program was more about nationalistic pride and outdoing the USSR, \nthan scientific exploration. We might have learned a bit, but even \nscientists will tell you that the amount of scientific knowledge gained was \nhardly worth the billions spent.\n\nAND we got Tang in the bargain as well.\n\nBut if you've worked for the NYC Dept. of Education, and had to deal with \nthe lack of materials and resources as a teacher (including science \nteachers having to purchase their own materials out of their own pockets), \nyou might think differently.\n\nIt took 2 billion1969 dollars to land men on the moon, at a time when tens \nof millions of people right here in the US lived in grinding poverty. 45 \nyears later, it is even worse. Going to the moon is impressive, but it \ndidn't solve any problems here on Earth.\n\nWe need to solve the issue of poverty, ignorance, and environmental \ndestruction here on Earth; otherwise, we will just take all those problems \nwith us to the moon, Mars, and the outer planets.\n\nUnmanned missions and probes are far less expensive, far less dangerous, an \nprovide far more scientific knowledge than sending people.\n\nI appreciate the caps on words like IGNORANT and LEARNED, but I'm hardly \nthe guy you want to be shouting at.
