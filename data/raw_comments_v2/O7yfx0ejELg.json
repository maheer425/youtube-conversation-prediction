Humidity in a sauna is typically \nhovering pretty close to 100% (maybe 70-80%) as well at a temperature of \n60-80C, and you can without much of an issue stay in there for an hour. \nDeath would occur not due to drowning but dehydration, but it'd take hours \nbefore you'd pass out. There has to be another explanation for why the cave \nis dangerous to be in than simply \"heat and humidity\" - or is the \ndifference between 80% and near-100% humidity just that critical?\ufeff",
