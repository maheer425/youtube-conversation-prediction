This is why when unknown figures appear in their house they \nwill growl and bark . It is instinct to protect the leader of the pack , \nwhich is you . So , try this method. 1. Try to reward your dog whenever he \nDOESN'T bark with a treat or a pat or a compliment. This will encourage the \ndog to behave that way as dogs tend to avoid acts which give them a \nnegative reaction. 2) When having activites , do it with both dogs. Such as \nwalking , playing , eating time , etc. This will create a bond. I hope i \nhelped",
