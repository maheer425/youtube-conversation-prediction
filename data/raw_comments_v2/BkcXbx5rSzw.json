The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different \ndirections. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you \nlook, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue \nlight from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.\n\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To \nreach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it \ngets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your \neyes.

Yes, that is said quite often that any cure would only be available \nto the rich. As for over population, scientists say this could be overcome \n(don't know how though!) . I do still think though that aging can be cured, \nits just my opinion, I even held that opinion as a small child. As I \nmentioned in one of my previous posts, aging does not happen by magic \n(there's a reason for it), if it did, I would say yes, it cannot be cured. \nAs it stands, there is a reason it happens, so therefore I believe it can \nbe stopped or controlled.\n\nI have my opinion though and I respect yours.

Natural resources will run out in no time \n(this is if the cure was in mass production and available for everyone) and \nthe over population will force people to start populating other planets \n(Mars).\nBut if we think logically, a cure will only be available to the high class \nand rich citizens of western countries and only powerful people from the \nrest of the world. It won't make a difference. And say even if the cure was \nbeing considered to be mass-produced, economists will strongly be against \nit because of the reasons I mentioned earlier.\n\nNo matter what way you look at it, its a lose-lose situation.

You simply cannot tell me aging is \nunavoidable. You don't know that for certain. I personally DO think it is \navoidable and so do many others. There are already scientists who say they \nknow what aging is, so that is a good start to be able to cure it.\n\nAnd no, im not afraid of death, if I die, I die, but I just think there \nwill be a cure for aging eventually. They are making new discoveries about \nthe aging process all the time. Imagine the discoveries they will be able \nto make in 60 or 70 years when technology is a lot more advanced.

So no, aging is something that is \nunavoidable.\n\nNo offense but I think that telling yourself a cure for aging will be found \nis just a fancy way of telling others you're afraid of death.
