There's only \ntwo ways you can get fissile material out of it. You need to refine the \nUranium 235 which is found in less than 1% of uranium.  You need a certain \namount to even produce an explosion (critical mass), the smallest nuke took \n56kg. You'd need next to a ton of the ore in order to produce a nuclear \nwarhead. The other is synthesizing plutonium from the uranium 238.  Neither \nprocesses are small undertakings.
