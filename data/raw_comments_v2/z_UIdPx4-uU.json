Teen angst, disillusionment, and alienation is well-covered these \ndays--we even have angsty and troubled teen werewolves and vampires...but \nI'm pretty sure that in Catchers time[1951], there wasn't much out there \nanything like it.\n\nThe book was written in a frank, conversational style that seemed unusual \nback then, concentrating on the feelings and inner thought processes of the \nnarrator, the inner world, more than the actual events of the story. [This \ncaused many to label the main character as 'too whiny']\n\nThis makes it a very personal first person narrative where the author is \nlaying it all out.\n\nThat's the best I can do. I read the book maybe 25 years ago--maybe in high \nschool, I don't remember.\n\nI hope this isn't some weird kind of spoiler in case you aren't done \nreading it, but...\n\nWhat I do remember is the part toward the end where Holden is walking along \nthe street worried about 'disappearing'....when I read a novel, that is \nwhat I look for or look to feel, the feeling I got in my gut when I read \nthat...I can't describe it...just like a relation to the material on a gut \nlevel\n\nI guess in this case, I could relate to his fears of not being able to come \nback and integrate himself into society in any meaningful way, to \n'disappear' and become nothing and nobody\n\nas far as the time it was written, 1951, people objected to the idea of a \nbook representing young people using foul language, rejecting societal \nconventions, wanting to buy prostitutes, etc etc...I think that's why \npeople freaked out, was the youth of the character\n\nIt's been a long time since I read it, so that's the best I can do for you.
