To start off, you cant use baking chocolate, which is what I \ndid and it ended up just not melting (that was really confusing at first!). \nSo I went out and got some normal chocolate which worked out fine with \nmelting. But then, after I put it on the wax paper and placed the second \nsheet on top, it came off really unbalanced and just not useable anymore. \nThat ended up with three bars of wasted chocolate, and a useless bar of \nbaking chocolate. I think the only flaw in the actual recipe is the part \nwhere you have to peel off the second piece of wax paper. \ufeff",
