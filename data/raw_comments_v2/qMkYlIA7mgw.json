The only British thing we have in our \ncountry is that the Queen is our monarch, so basically she gets to be on \nour coins and our 20$ bills. Before you comment about a foreign country, \ntry educating yourselves first. Maybe if schools down there taught more \nthan just American history you would all have better understandings.... \ufeff",
