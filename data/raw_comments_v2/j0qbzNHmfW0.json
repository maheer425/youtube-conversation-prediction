But an increasing hostility on \nthe part of the non-slaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery has \nled to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General \nGovernment have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The \nStates of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and \nIowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render \nuseless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive \nis discharged from the service or labor claimed, and in none of them has \nthe State Government complied with the stipulation made in the \nConstitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in \nconformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of \nanti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render \ninoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of \nCongress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave \nhas been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have \nrefused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with \ninciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the \nconstitutional compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the \nnon-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is \nreleased from her obligation.\n\nThe ends for which this Constitution was framed are declared by itself to \nbe \"to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic \ntranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, \nand secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"\n\nThese ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which \neach State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its \nown institutions. The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving \nto free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to \nrepresent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their \nslaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by \nstipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.\n\nWe affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted \nhave been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of \nthem by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have \nassumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic \ninstitutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen \nof the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as \nsinful the institution of Slavery; they have permitted the open \nestablishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb \nthe peace and to the property of the citizens of other States. They have \nencouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and \nthose who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to \nservile insurrection.\"\n\nNot about slavery huh?",

Caroline away(do to slavery) and \nthe other Southern states were inspired. The North, angry because they were \nlosing power, started the war.'\" isn't perfect in terms of grammar. Firstly \nyou can't tell someone something in any particular direction such as \n'straight,' but you can tell someone something 'directly.' Secondly it's \n'due to' not 'do to,' and high-school and middle-school aren't proper nouns \nso they shouldn't be capitalized. Also the Confederates technically started \nthe civil war by bombarding the ill-supplied Fort Sumter, so don't bring up \nthe whole \"The Union started it,\" stuff. Also before I continue I would \nlike to note that the civil war wasn't the \"North's\" or the \"South's\" \nfault. It was the fault of the people who brought it about, not their \nrespective regions. That's like saying Germany ordered ethnic cleansing in \nWWII. Germany didn't but a German named Adolf Hitler did, but I digress. \nBack to the matter at hand, I'm not sure that a high-school teacher is some \nkind of supreme authority on American History. +The Republic of Hensonesia I'm \nnot even going to start with you. What I said to B.O.B applies not only to \nhim but the entire conversation at hand. One thing I want to note is that \nthe war didn't start as an effort to abolish slavery. Lincoln wasn't even \nan abolitionist. \"In a three-hour speech in Peoria, Illinois, in the fall \nof 1854, Lincoln presented more clearly than ever his moral, legal and \neconomic opposition to slavery\u2014and then admitted he didn\u2019t know exactly \nwhat should be done about it within the current political system. \nAbolitionists, by contrast, knew exactly what should be done about it: \nSlavery should be immediately abolished, and freed slaves should be \nincorporated as equal members of society. They didn\u2019t care about working \nwithin the existing political system, or under the Constitution, which they \nsaw as unjustly protecting slavery and slave owners. Leading abolitionist \nWilliam Lloyd Garrison called the Constitution \u201ca covenant with death and \nan agreement with Hell,\u201d and went so far as to burn a copy at a \nMassachusetts rally in 1854. Though Lincoln saw himself as working \nalongside the abolitionists on behalf of a common anti-slavery cause, he \ndid not count himself among them.\" -Sarah Pruitt History.com Also from the \nsame article comes this little tidbit, \"Though Lincoln argued that the \nfounding fathers\u2019 phrase \u201cAll men are created equal\u201d applied to blacks and \nwhites alike, this did not mean he thought they should have the same social \nand political rights. His views became clear during an 1858 series of \ndebates with his opponent in the Illinois race for U.S. Senate, Stephen \nDouglas, who had accused him of supporting \u201cnegro equality.\u201d In their \nfourth debate, at Charleston, Illinois, on September 18, 1858, Lincoln made \nhis position clear. \u201cI will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in \nfavor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the \nwhite and black races,\u201d he began, going on to say that he opposed blacks \nhaving the right to vote, to serve on juries, to hold office and to \nintermarry with whites. What he did believe was that, like all men, blacks \nhad the right to improve their condition in society and to enjoy the fruits \nof their labor. In this way they were equal to white men, and for this \nreason slavery was inherently unjust.\n\nLike his views on emancipation, Lincoln\u2019s position on social and political \nequality for African-Americans would evolve over the course of his \npresidency. In the last speech of his life, delivered on April 11, 1865, he \nargued for limited black suffrage, saying that any black man who had served \nthe Union during the Civil War should have the right to vote.\" Lastly I \nwould just like to note that Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation\" didn't \nfree ALL slaves. It didn\u2019t apply to border slave states like Delaware, \nMaryland, Kentucky and Missouri, and it didn't apply to all of the \nConfederate States either, which I believe shows that the civil war wasn't \nreally just some big grudge the USA had with the newly-formed CSA or \nvise-versa. Honestly, this was a big waste of my time, but I figured I'd \ncontribute to the end of this argument. Don't bother replying.",

I was alluding to the fact of Greek accomplishment. ;I \nwasn't dismissing Greek ingenuity, nor European, I am just letting you know \nthat there are humans outside of Europe :)\n\nEurope did take over a lot, and they were a dominant power, I will admit \nthat. Though even before the Europeans were relevant, there were already \nbrilliant people running the show, the Sumerians, The Indus, The \nmesopotamians, The Egyptians, so on. Also Asians and Africans helped \ncontribute to the rise of Europe, their rich nations allowed Europe to \nstrategically get a foot hold. Remember that Europe came last to the race \nof history, and they reign is somewhat still there. Though we must not \nforget the legacy of Europeans.\n\n\nI assume that you are Hispanic, if \"ortiz\" doesn't give it away, I am \ncorrect?

European powers had influence from Asia to america, and the \nglobal culture we live in today is european. Why do you think everyone \neverywhere in the world learns english?

West Asia (Middle east)? West Africa? Yea... I never had either... \nDumb Eurocentric filth! Greece was a great learning center.. If you were a \nGreek LOL. Did you know the Greeks had learned from the Middle easterners \nand Africans? The Greeks are brilliant, don't get me wrong, but you guys \nweren't just \"learned\" on your own.  Don't worry, all people learn from \nothers.... It's human nature... Well if you are European, it's not, since \nhuman nature and humanity doesn't flow their way...\n\nOh the Roman Empire, what a glory of an Empire (truly was though), but if \nyou are a western European... Then you don't count, because the Roman \nthought of your people as BARBARIANS! They felt that A LOT of people were \nbarbarians, but Germanics in particular were very \"special\" to them. They \nowned the most Germanic slaves out of ALL people, and even the Greeks felt \nthe same way about Western Europe. Not feeling so \"superior\" and \n\"important\" now.\n\nOh yea and btw, only the mediterrean (or how ever you spell it) was the \nglobal power of the time, NOT ANY WHERE ELSE IN EUROPE. The Greeks are \nolive, not white, the Romans were white, but wanted nothing to do with the \nrest of their \"brethren\". The roman empire, as powerful as it was, only had \nso much control.. Africa and Asia were the major powers of THAT time. Axum, \nChina, Persia, rivaled with and against rome for a good long time. When you \nRoman empire fell, and fell into bunches of barbaric states and shit holes, \nGhana Empire, Mali Empire, China, Turks, Abbysids, Swahili states, Egypt, \nSoutheast Asia, India, Mongols, and many more were in charge of MAJOR trade \nroutes and wealth. Stop trying to put yourself on top of EVERYTHING, you \nhad your light in the 1750s, NOW ACCEPT. The enlightened periods of the \n1550s -1740s were nice, but it wasn't \"Europe's height\" Even my own country \nof Japan had more significance to play in in the world then than Europe! \nLOL, and My country wasn't the most strongest like China.\n\n\nGot any more to say?
