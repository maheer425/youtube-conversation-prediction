If you're interested in reading it for yourself \nI highly recommend checking it out; Though as a warning it is something \nthat consumes your life and everything becomes horrible, you will cry, you \nwill get angry at Hussie for everything he is making you feel with the \ncomic but you will also enjoy it and not be able to stop reading, and then \nmeet wonderful people that understand you because we are all crazy in our \nown way and understand each other. This is no joke either. The fandom is so \ncrazy and wonderful, but at the same time horrific and terrible. \n\nHere is the link to the first Panel of Homestuck if you would still want to \nread it: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6\n\n\nIf you do start reading it and get into it, PLEASE, for the love of all \nthat is good in this messed up world, DO NOT SKIP ANY ACTS OR PANELS. I'm \nnot just saying this because it is generally good, but if you skip over \neven a single line you will regret it in the later panels as everything \nholds useful information to the story line.
