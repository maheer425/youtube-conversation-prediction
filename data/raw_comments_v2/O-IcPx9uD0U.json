Benjamin Franklin is listed as the \norganization's first fireman, in 1790.\nNow for the reader, this would be considered true which is meant to reflect \nthe level of ignorance maintained by a government that bans reading of \nbooks and is free to revise history as they please. No one reading this \ncould have actually known by 1790, Benjamin Franklin was 84 years old and \non his deathbed. Nor could they have known that this founding father was a \nfireman who prevented fires, not in the 1790s but in the 1730s.\nWith this example, its clear to me that something reputable and real as a \nbook is not to be treated lightly. Even in Brave New World, the Bible was \nstowed away from the eyes of society because it was decided \"unnecessary,\" \n\"confusing,\" and \"obsolete.\" The message is that we are able to know so \nmuch, but only if we are willing (As is said by Granger by the novels end).",
