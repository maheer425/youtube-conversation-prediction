She gets so much goddamn flak from people who have \nseen the movie. It's like they tuned out completely at the normal human \nexperience just because they think Forrest is adorable.\nJenny didn't think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was \ntaking advantage of him the same way her father molested her.\nFor fucks sake, Forrest is retarded. Jenny, out of everyone who's ever met \nhim, knows this best of all. She knows that her closest friend and only \nloved one is a fucking idiot. Imagine that. Imagine for one second that the \nonly person who was always kind to you was someone who didn't know any \nbetter. Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you \neither as a victim or as something disgusting, but that one man doesn't.\nAnd it's because he's retarded.\nJenny doesn't think that way at the start. As a kid, she just thinks he's \ndifferent and is just glad to have a friend. But as she gets older, \nespecially as a teenager, she realizes that her closest friend will never \nmature like she does. He loves her like he would anything and everything \nelse, so long as its nice or cuddly, like a pet or a sibling, at least in \nher mind. Her father treated her like shit, and there was no way in hell \nothers didn't do the same when they found out she was molested. She would \nhave wanted to feel loved.\nThat's where she gets the abusive relationship crap. She wants so much to \nbe loved that she doesn't understand that they are taking advantage of her. \nShe thinks that as long as they aren't forcing her to have sex, that's \nnormal. Getting beat on, pressured to drug addiction, and dragged around \ninto whatever dangerously extreme political bands they're into is just \nfine, as long as they don't rape her. That's why she's so shocked when \nForrest defends her from harm. Why would anyone do that if what they're \ndoing to her is normal?\nShe keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he \ndoesn't really love her. She convinces herself that his affections are \nshallow, since he would never be able to really understand love either. I \nmean really, how many of you honestly think someone who is that mentally \nchallenged could understand the complexities and nuances of love? There's \nno way they could. What they have is something simple, and Jenny doesn't \nthink that could be real.\nAnd even IF she believed he could, even IF she got out of that abusive \ncycle, she knows better. FFS, if that scene with Forrest and her in her \ncollege dormroom had the genders reversed, people would be so fucking \nuncomfortable about that scene because it'd be inching so close to rape. \nJenny knows that. She realizes that. That is why she shuts off her feelings \nfor Forrest, above any other reasons to stay away: she thinks she is \nmolesting him. She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and \nthought holy fuck, what the hell am I doing?\nCan you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment \nthat you turned into the father who molested you? How the fuck can you love \nyourself after doing that to your best friend, when you know what that's \nlike? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really \ncared about them?\nSo Jenny kept running away. Every time Forrest gets close and saves her, \nshe runs off before she falters. She won't let herself get near him, and as \nthe movie goes on, she fails a little more each time. First she blows him \noff after the strip club, telling him to stay away. Then she walks with him \nin DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his \nhouse and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.\nWhen he tells her he does know what love is, and asks her why she doesn't \nlove him.\nShe finally gives in and does sleep with him, but can you imagine thinking \nafterwards? Would you, in her shoes, with absolute and unwavering \ncertainty, think you did the right thing? Or would you be afraid that you \ndid exactly what you had been avoiding because you do actually care that \nmuch about him?\nSo she runs away. She hides her child from him, because she thinks he \nshouldn't have to worry or pay for something he can't handle. She thinks \nshe's wronged him, and the least she could do is set things right by \nraising a good child, without dragging him down.\nAnd then she gets sick. Doctors don't know what it is, but she's going to \ndie. Her kid is only a few years old. Can you imagine struggling with that \ndecision to tell your victim that they have a kid and now they have to take \ncare of it because you're going to die? That's what she struggles with \nbefore coming to terms with the fact that she's happy with him, and he's \nhappy with her, and that's what love actually is. It's something simple and \nunconditional, and even Forrest can understand it.\nIt takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that \nsimple, and she dies months afterwards. She realized she had been running \naway from what made her happy, and it isn't wrong, and she only gets so \nmuch time together before it's over.\nAnd instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story, people \njust bitch about how Jenny is such a slut, but she won't even love the only \nperson who cares about her. Jenny always loved Forrest, during the whole \nfucking movie. She loved him so much, she thought she was taking advantage \nof him and ran away for his sake. She didn't realize she was wrong until it \nwas almost too late.\nFuck, that's depressing.\"",
