Soon all the polar bears with \nless webbing on their feet will not do as well, and it will be harder for \nthose polar bears to become old enough to pass on the \"small webbed feet\" \nonto their offspring. Now the only polar bears that are alive have lager \nwebs on their feet, and as they do more and more swimming, the polar bears \nwith bigger and bigger webs will do better and better until eventually the \nwebbed feet are so big that we consider them to be flippers, and now they \nspend more time in the water. Tada! Your polar bears now live in the water, \nand rarely go on land. Maybe they have mouths that are slowly higher and \nhigher, to help them breath, and maybe a hole on their back too. The ones \nthat are slimmer are more streamlined, so they reproduce more too. Then the \nones that have larger tails reproduce more. Sounding familiar?
