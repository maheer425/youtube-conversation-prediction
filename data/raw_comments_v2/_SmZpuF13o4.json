There's also the \nstrain on your lungs, it is a foreign body entering your lungs - the only \nthing that's meant to really be in your lungs is oxygen and carbon \ndioxide... So that is going to have an affect. \n\nI'm not saying weed is worse than other substances such as alcohol and \ncigarettes, but I'm just informing people that there are possibilities that \nit could be bad, it's common sense at the end of the day. \ufeff",
