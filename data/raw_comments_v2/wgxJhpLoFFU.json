If you're interested in learning more, you should probably study \nparapsychology or occult science.\nI don't really believe in divination, since there's no solid proof or \nscientific backing, but I'm not one to talk, since I'm obsessed with fate \nand stuff, haha\uff5e",

They could be the smallest parts of me that \nreject the most key parts of myself and so, are with, and without (if I may \nquote F. Scott Fitzgerald), they are a manifestation of my most distant \nparts, created as such to appear as someone who is not me. So am I able to \npress these characters for information so that I may better understand \nmyself, and for that matter, if I am aware of it, will it affect the \noutcome? Could I simply hear what I most want to? That I am kind and brave, \nmaking myself believe so, because, after all, I heard if from a \nmanifestation of my own self? Or will that manifestation of my \nsubconscious, THAT me, not realize who I am, that I am me? If so, will I \nreceive the answer that a stranger to that part of me would receive? And \ncould I take that answer as a sign that my smaller parts are so different \nfrom my main self, or so distant from my main self that I could not even \nrecognize myself? Am I only subject to myself in my dreams, can my brain \nfind no true inspiration?\n\nIt would be amazing to dream and for the self to completely reconfigure \nitself and to be someone not YOU, you, the first person character \nexperiencing the story, are not yourself, merely a projection of your \nsubconscious or maybe even a representation of how you believe others act, \nor how someone in particular acts if you become them in your dreams. Or is \nit that human nature has basic guidelines that are preordained and thus you \nARE in fact capable of unbiasedly fabricating a person whom with you do not \nshare a piece of your mind with.\n\nUgh...questions questions and NO answers.
