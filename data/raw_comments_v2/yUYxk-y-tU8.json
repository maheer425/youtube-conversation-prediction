The best secret is to start with sticking \nthe ingredients separately into a ball mill, adding only water, and then \nmicrowaving, stirring every 35-40 seconds, until a golden brown. Then \nadding sulphur.\n\nLarger the batch the safer, because it takes longer to heat up and less \nlikely to get thermal runaway (aka fuel catching fire)\n\nThe largest engine of this I made had 65 pounds of fuel in it.
