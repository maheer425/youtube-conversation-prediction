Placing a cookie-sheet \nunder it can help catch any batter drippage during cooking.\nPre-heat oven to 200\u00b0F.\nSift together flour, baking powder and salt.\nBeat eggs thoroughly. Whisk in sugar, milk and oil.\nAdd liquid ingredients to dry ingredients and mix gently until combined. \nDon't overmix!\nSpray both surfaces of your waffle iron with cooking spray.\nLadle 4 to 6 oz (\u00bd to \u00be cup) batter on the iron and close it. It's not \nunusual for a bit of batter to seep out of the edges of the iron. If \nthere's excessive leakage, use less batter for the next waffle.\nCook until the waffle iron's indicator light shows that cooking is \ncomplete, or until no more steam comes out. The finished waffle should be \ngolden brown and crispy.\nLift the waffle out of the iron with a pair of tongs and either serve right \naway or transfer it to the oven to keep warm\ufeff",
