I got to spend the entire half of the day \nwith my bestfriend and my family, to eat at an all-you-can-eat buffet for \nhours, to get some new pair of shoes, to get a new cute stuffed toy, and \neven see an awesome band. Everything was fine until my friend pranked me. \nThe prank really made me feel sad but It was a prank so I didn't heed to \nit. I wanted to get her back so I pranked her that I was gonna prank her in \nschool. She started swearing at me and started hating me. She told me she \nhad anxiety and I could've killed her. I told her sorry but then she \nstarted saying mean stuff at me. I told her that I'm sorry again and that I \ncouldn't do anything (which I am also sorry about) because we were chatting \nthrough the internet and that I don't know how to help her. She didn't \nstop. She kept swearing and swearing at me and she kept saying mean things \nabout me.\nThank you for making me feel better :)\ufeff",
