However, this time, I find myself \nconsidering adding a second one later. A kitten as a 2nd would be best I \nsuppose? I would think two adults is much harder, even if you try to find \ncompatible minds.\n\nThe way you did it was really sensitive to the species and impressive. I \nfind myself paying much more attention to cats among themselves as well. \nFun to see, and yet so educational. And people are absolutely right, you \nhave a wonderful voice. Would love to see more of their capers :)",
