Countries like Japan and Germany were still farming countries \n(mercantilist) that needed room to farm to feed their burgeoning \npopulation, while countries like Great Britain and America were more \ncapitalist, and weren't going to start a war of expansion for farmland. \nThis is because they traded their capitalist industrial goods for food, or \nhad capitalist farming that provided all of their food needs.

However, as we \nsee, the extent to which a country had embraced industrialized capitalism \ndictated how well fed they were, how likely they were to invade a foreign \ncountry for farmland, and how likely they were to win the war. Capitalism \nprovided a flood of food and weapons to overwhelm the enemy. Through one \nlens, WWII was a story of capitalism defeating mercantilism.

Generals like Patton did not want the bomb dropped because \nthey believed it was dishonorable (the Japanese would have agreed), but \nothers believed saving military lives was the right thing to do. The choice \nof a civilian target was a tactical one, as it would destroy moral. Japan's \neconomy had already tanked, so bombing a military target would not have \nmattered. It wasn't black and white on the Japanese side either. Yamamoto \ndid not want a war against the US because he knew the Japanese would lose. \nHe wanted peace as soon as possible. Others wanted peace after hearing the \nthreat of an apocalyptic bomb. The militarists trusted Japanese tenacity \nenough to believe taking the bombs face first and continuing the war was \nthe right thing to do because there was a small chance Japan could scrape a \nconditional surrender.\n\nLook at Hitler and Stalin. Hitler didn't do anything he did because he was \nthe spawn of Satin like short minded people like to believe (which is why I \ncompare him to Attila the Hun because he was also viewed as the spawn of \nSatin, the \"Scourge of God\" in the immediate future after his exploits). He \ndid what he did because he believed it was the right thing to do. If you \nhonestly believe your economy is being sabotaged by one race, you kill them \noff. It makes sense, until the notion that their belief was wrong comes up \n(likewise just because someone believes something doesn't make it actually \ngood, as 6 million Jews and 12 million Russians would agree). Stalin's \nGulag system was also under the belief that everything he did was right, \nand if you think logically under the assumption that you ARE infallible, \narresting any opposition IS the right thing to do. He had Russia in his \nmind first.\n\nGood intentions pave the the road to hell, and there should be more \nforgiveness for those who WEREN'T politicians as they were put in extreme \npressure. However, people should just stop worrying who the bad guys and \ngood guys were in WWII and worry more about doing the right thing today, \nespecially when decisions will still be very difficult to make. Do you drop \nthe bomb to save your own men, comrades, friends, and family, or do you not \ndrop the bomb to save the innocent lives of your enemies civilians?",
