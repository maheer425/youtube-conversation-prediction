Is there anybody in the UN to expose the nature of human rights \nviolations suffered by RNF....LGBT are to be protected..niggers are to be \nprotected..immigrants are to be protected BUT none of the RNT to be I say \nwhy? Aren`t they human? look  bisexual and transgender are humans and poor \nracist and nationalist are not then??!...it is unfair and unjust and \ninhumane!!

            "text": "Of the adverse social effects of homosexuality none is more significant \nthan the effect on marriage and home. The normal, God-given sexual \nrelationship is the procreative act between man and a woman in honorable \nmarriage. It was so expressed and commanded to the first man and woman on \nthe earth in Genesis. \n\nThe institution of marriage is further elevated in the 132nd Section of the \nDoctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord makes clear that only through the \neternal union of man and woman can they achieve eternal life. As an \nexample, he says that the wife is given to the man to multiply and \nreplenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfill the \npromise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, \nand for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the \nsouls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be \nglorified. Such references of course relate to celestial marriage.\n\nIn this context, where stands the perversion of homosexuality? Clearly it \nis hostile to Gods purpose in that it negates his first and great \ncommandment to multiply and replenish the earth. If the abominable practice \nbecame universal it would depopulate the earth in a single generation. It \nwould nullify Gods great program for his spirits in the heavenly world \nwithout the chance for the opportunities of mortality and would deny to all \nthe participants in the practice the eternal life God makes available to us \nall.\n\nMany have been misinformed that they are powerless in the matter, not \nresponsible for the tendency, and that \u2018God made them that way.\u2019 This is as \nuntrue as any other of the diabolical lies Satan has concocted. It is \nblasphemy. Man is made in the image of God. Does the pervert think God to \nbe \u2018that way\u2019? . . .\n\nBut let us emphasize that right and wrong, righteousness and sin, are not \ndependent upon man's interpretations, conventions, and attitudes.  Social \nacceptance does not change the status of an act, making wrong into right. \n If all the people in the world were to accept homosexuality, as it seems \nto have been accepted in Sodom and Gomorrah, the practice would still be \ndeep, dark sin.\ufeff",

If something exists, doesn't that equate to being \"natural\" \nbecause if it didn't it wouldn't exist at all. \n\nFor example it is not natural for humans to digest titanium, it is not \nnatural for humans to fly (I'm talking about biologically, yes we design \nequipment that helps us fly, but we cannot fly ourselves with the bodies \nthat we were born with.) \n\nHowever is it does exist, then how is it still unnatural? From what you \nsaid, yes apparently it is natural for a human to have sex with another \nspecies, is it morally questionable, absolutely since it can be categorized \nas rape and animal abuse. Regardless, it is possible therefore it exists in \nnature, therefore it is natural. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is defining something to be \"natural\" or \n\"unnatural\" is not a very good way to make your claim, because the \ndefinition can vary from person to person, on top of that, the definition \nitself is very vague and holds no absolute values. \n\nBiologists use the term \"natural\" as a simple verification on whether or \nnot something exists in nature or not (ei: rocks are not natural, but \nplants are), and this to me seems to be the best possible way to define the \nterm \"natural\" since it can be easily differentiated with a yes or a no.

            "text": "Human beings are social and cultural living beings whose cultures and \nsocieties have been constructed historically, that means by the \nconfrontation of different social-political forces who want to rule the \npower. It is just like that how discrimination and repression against \nhomosexual sexuality originated. Everybody can easily realize that reading \nthe very well documented (with factical arguments, not with idealistic \nnarrow-minded analysis) book \"History of sexuality\" by Michel Foucault \n(1976). \n\nTo go deeper about the \"natural\" and causalist usage of body. At first, \nnothing made by human beings can be considered \"natural\", because the word \n\"artificial\" means etymologically \"human made\". By the way, do not forget \nthat \"normal\" is an statistical concept that means \"the most repeated \ndistribution\"; not exactly the best or the right one. So, we are not \nimpulsed by our nature to use our genitals for reproduction (Butler, 1997; \nPreaciado, 2003), but for satisfying our sexual desires (Freud, 1995; \nLacan, 1957). Actually, clitoris is an organ that works just for satisfying \nwoman; it has no reproductive function. Thinking timeless and not \nhistorically as causalism and naturalism do, as in the story of Adam and \nEve, nobody orders us to use our biology for reproduction. So reproduction \nis a cultural aim (Bohannan, 1996), and a political one (Foucault, 1976) as \nit is used in Demography to control the number of population and their \nproductive distribution by contraceptives. \n\nThe only one reason why homosexuals are condemned is because they go \nagainst the political-economic system which wants our maximum production \norganized as productive and reproductive families. And it is not God who's \njudging and discrimination homos, but conservative and narrow-minded \npeople; or is God maybe punishing homosexuals nowadays? No, and the case of \nSodom and Gomorrah hasn't been proved archeologically yet as actual. Do you \nnot know how many suicides of homosexual teens and unhappiness of many \nrepressed older homosexuals have caused those ideas, allegedly disseminated \nby God's people? Please read the statistics. \n\nBeing homosexual does not cause any harm, but discrimination - social and \npolitical unequal treaty - does.

Personally i dont care if you are \na fag, lesbo or plastic deformed it, but dont parade in front of us, dont \nmake your self so special by putting counter to your pass situation where \nyou head some morality and shame and your feelings were hurt. Dont get your \nself special right while asking for equal rights. Dont show in peoples \nfaces that you are gay, cause other people have feelings and those feelings \nmight be shameful towards your gay orientation, don put your self in \nposition to criticize everyone just cause you are \"ill\"/\"special\"/fag! Dont \nbe like Izrael, dont give your self right do do what ever you want just \ncause you got hurt and oppressed in pass. If you are for caring about \npeoples rights and feeling than dont hypocritically care accepting those \nyou like and discarding those you dont, accept and care for feelings of \npeople who are against your fag promotion!\n\nI consider faggity not normal cause everything in this world have its \npurpose and reason, and i think that human purpose is to give another live, \nour body is physically created to do that beside other life functions, and \nfags and other mentally ill people cant do that with their sexual \norientation. I know you fags usually adopt homeless child and make another \nfag out of him (i know most of you dont do that on purpose but your \nchildren learn first from you), so one good deed minus one bad deed and \nthere you go you are on zero.\n\nAnd above all else am sure that UN and other world organizations could \nspend money not on attention seeking fags but to feed and help billions of \nhungry and sick children and people around the world. I am against LGBT \ncause all of you are selfish attention seeking, for example fags demand im \ncountry that capital city spends 5 million eouros each year so a LGBT pride \nparade could happen. Even so leaders of LGBT are high educated people they \ndont care that there are more than 15000 sick people that cant save their \nlives due lack of operation money, 100 000 students that cant go to college \ndue lack of money, parts of crucial urban infrastructure like hospitals and \nschools that need emergency repairs but stand at risk of demolishing. Fags \nonly care about other fags.\n\nDont ask for special (\"equal\") rigts, ask taht people dont care if you are \nfag, just like people dont care if some one likes more dark or white \ncoffee, when you get to the point when people say \"oh you are gay, okay \n(awkward) what am i suppose to do with that information?\" than everything \nwill be at its place, but as long as you demand that people say \"oh you are \ngay, how wonderful, nice going on you being so strong and secure of your \nself, here have some free stuff and extra credits and discounts!\" than you \nwill all be sick fags and earn nothing right for you selves.\ufeff",
