I particularly liked the scene where Walter was \nalone in the desert, after essentially killing his brother in law, with 11 \nmillion dollars in a barrel. All those money and yet he was pitiful and \nalone and his family that he claimed over and over that he wanted to help, \nhated him so much they wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. Really a \ngreat show and it's funny how you go from rooting for Walter to questioning \nhim and in the end hating him and getting sort of depressed from how he \nends up.\ufeff",

            "text": "Check this out: Walter White uses the name Heisenberg as an alias. Werner \nHeisenberg was a physicist who came up with the Uncertainty Principle. The \nUncertainty Principle is regarded as a theoretical obstacle in the pursuit \nof achieving the transportation of matter, or teleportation. There is also \nsomething known as The Matrix Interpretation of the Uncertainty Principle. \nIn the film The Matrix, they use telephones to transport themselves between \nthe matrix and \"the real world\". In both Dr. Who and Bill and Ted's \nExcellent Adventure, they also use telephones as a mode of transportation \nthrough time and space. In Breaking Bad, there's a scene where Walter White \ncomes out of nowhere to flatten the two drug dealers that Jesse intends to \nshoot. Mr. Garrison from South Park looks like Walter White. In one \nepisode, Mr. Garrison invents a new mode of transportation which is \na circular, and requires the user to engage in homosexual activity in order \nto use it (exclusivity). He states that his mode of transportation has the \nbenefit of not needing to \"go to the stupid fart-faced airport\". The word \n\"airport\" in this case is most likely a euphemism for sites such as Menwith \nHill near my home town of Ilkley. There is a video right here on the \nYouTubes of a man in China riding across a junction on a moped, with a \ntruck coming the other way. Just before the truck hits the man, he vanishes \ninto thin air, leaving the truck driver to get out and look in confusion. \nWhen the footage is slowed down, there is a freeze-frame of the moment just \nbefore the collision, and there is a guy in a circle in a casual walking \nstance, seemingly about to retrieve the man from his moped. When I shared \nmy theory on the possibility of this being a technological phenomenon, \nthere was a video posted shortly afterwards, dismissing the video as a \nhoax, and having been shot for some film or other. I'm not convinced. Then \nthere's IBM's research into teleportation, which they declared to have been \nresearching sometime back in the early 90s. IBM have also come under \ncriticism for their involvement in the holocaust, which was subject to a \ndocumentary by a man called Edwin Black. I don't think that it is a \ncoincidence that in the game Half-Life 2, there is a character called \nWallace Breene that resembles Edwin Black, and is portrayed as an evil \ntyrant. It would also make sense that the creators of Half-Life 2, Valve \nSoftware, would also release the Portal series of games, where the player \nuses a teleportation gun to solve various puzzles. In an episode of Top \nGear, Jeremy Clarkson talks about Lexuses. I can't remember the exact \nquote, but he associates Lexuses with golf and Freemasons. I think he uses \nthe word \"golf\" as a euphemism for the use of technology at sites such as \nMenwith Hill (known locally as \"The Golf Balls\"), implying that The \nFreemasons are granted access to the secret technologies available there, \nfor their own personal use, perhaps in exchange for money. There is an \nepisode of The Simpsons where Homer is inducted into \"The Stonecutters\" as \nthey believe that he is a figure that has been prophesised to be \ntheir leader. After a while, the Stonecutters get sick of Homer and set \nup a new secret society known as the \"No Homers\" club. I believe that  this \noutlines the different groups with their separate technology. Clearly \n\"Homers\" are not allowed to be \"Stonecutters\", and as such, Mr. Garrison, \nwho is a \"Homer\", invents his own form of this technology.\ufeff",
