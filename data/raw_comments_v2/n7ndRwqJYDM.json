Is there any \nrelationship between this race and indus civilization? Well I can assure \nyou dravidians are very good at scientific stuff, they make most of the \nscientists here and even 80% of indian scientists in rest of the world also \nvery good with trade and mathematics, now also. The later eras shows vast \ntrade from south india than north. Even the language is not related to \naryan languages. Even the constructions done after settlements in inner \nindia, showed south indian buildings had a marvel to it; bigger better \nstructured...and also they had the characteristics of a suppressed society, \nie people goes to extreme ends when they get suppressed (like jews making a \nawesome israel) all the great empire in india from ashoka to mughals \ncouldn't conquer south india; though temporary victories were there no one \ncould keep it. Again the battle of 10 kings shows like dravidians lost that \nbattle and were pushed down to south and aryan kings who lost was pushed \nwest to iran and rest of the aryans who won settled in the ganges plain and \nformed kuru (14th century BCE) same time indus started declining. I think \nit was a major drought in the subtropical high which made migration to \nequator areas and the only place where water will be available is in \nHimalayan glacier. \ufeff",

C. but modern day Indians \nand Europeans have have? no one in south eats wheat and drink milk but they \nare widely consumed in both Europe and North India.\n3. Why we us word Adivasis to refer tribals? It means \"Ppl who were living \nbefore us\".\n4. Why Sanskrit is holly language of Sanatan Dharm/Hinduism and not Tamil?\n5. Why North Indians can pronouns European words properly but southies \ncan't even learn Hindi?\n6. Tell me any thing other then religion we Have in common? In this way \nIndonesian were Indians too? and Persians are Arabs?\n7. Why A German will be befitted if India got divided? A British may have \nreasons to do so but not a German.\n8. Were our great great..... grand parents fool to refer them as Aryans?\n9. Why was Vedas written in north west region of Punjab and then moved as \nWide as Assam to Maharashtra? What location you will get if you will rewind \nmigrating even before Punjab.\n10. Southies don't even know what Indian mean before Britishers introduced \nthe term to them\n11. Ever seen any south guy joining army? or Any of them who fought for \nIndependence?\nThey only want to have an American citizenship and we are better without \nthem.\n\nWe simply can change History to save union of 2 entirely different world. \nThey are not even Indian.
