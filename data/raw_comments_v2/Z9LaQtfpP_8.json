For someone who is a Political Science and \nGender Studies graduate, she obviously isn't aware of the bigger facts on \nwomen and porn (and for the record, I'm not defending porn or even saying \nit's right for people to watch it): despite porn being made for women and \nBY women, most women who watch porn watch the same kind that men do and \ngenuinely enjoy it. This is a fact that the media isn't too keen on making \nus aware of, so you have to do your own learning through the Internet. \nHowever, even with these, the reports still try to say that a low number of \nwomen watch porn when in fact many more watch it than just 8%, that's just \na number from surveys, not including millions of other women they don't \ntalk to. I myself have talked to many, many women on social networking \nsites who will openly tell you that they do watch porn and find it fun or \narousing, not necessarily for the guys sake as articles also try to tell \nus. Many women also like watching lesbian porn, which is just as gritty as \nstraight porn meant for men, so you can't say they like lez porn because it \nagrees with women and their desire for softer, more emotional, meaningful \nsex.\n\nThis woman, and others like her, is trying to convince us that porn is \nstill a fun-go land that only entertains men and demeans women and \ndisregards their sexual needs. Not trying to sound like a hater, but that \nis the kind of message to be expected from a self-proclaimed feminist, \nyeah. The anti-porn objective by folks like her is to zero in on how porn \nis a man thing that hurts women, all the while trying to keep you from \nknowing the real facts that women are not really as injured or offended by \nit as she says, but are indulging in it just like men, and having no \nproblem with it. The game is about perpetually portraying women as injured \nparties from men's entertainment, so that you're not supposed to notice \nwomen's own part in it. I've done my homework, she hasn't.\n\nThese may be of some use to anyone who wants to know the truth:\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/women-and-porn-survey-ann-summers-sex_n_4297183.html\n\nhttp://www.alternet.org/gender/what-kind-porn-turns-women\ufeff",

When I've watched porn \n(hetrosexual male), on balance I'm left with the idea that it's all about \nthe woman being the receiver of sexual pleasure.  It looks all rather macho \nand more about her receiving pleasure.  Ok 'he' ejaculates, but often it's \njust the production of seamen than an expression submitting to orgasm: and \nthat's about all you see.  Sometimes there seems like there's very little \nactual connected with this outward display.  Interesting that folk can \nwatch porn and yet see different thinks in it!

Jesus feminists, can we stop \nmaking everything into a political/social movement? Porn was catered to \nmen, because it was mostly consumed by men, basic economy 101. Same \nhappened in the fashion industry. In the earlier days (like 40-50 years \nago) nearly every dude looked the same, because the industry did not \nconsider men to be interested in it. Now a significant part of fashion is \nfocusing on menswear, because men's mentality changed (significantly for \nthe last 20 years). Did you see Men's Right Activists starting an uproar \nback then how the fashion industry is being sexist and portraying men as \nlumps with no taste in fashion? No, because not a single fuck was given by \nmen. We showed our interest, the industry reacted. The End. No \nsocio-political movement was needed, nothing.

One got nearly \nanything covered, except for pedophilia and partly rape (which is a good \nthing, wish zoophilia wouldn't be covered as well). There is BBW (big \nbeautiful women, even the name is actually nice, considering how we men are \nbeing portrayed as assholes at the moment), there is petite girls, you can \nwatch \"romantic\" porn, older guys, younger guys, \"female friendly\" porn, \nsmall dicks, many dicks, different ethnicities, whatever tickles your fancy.\n\nAnd the porn industry is changing, because there is a huge influx of female \naudience (which I think is a good thing) and the industry is trying to \nplease (no pun intended) this audience too. You'll automatically see the \naverage porn change into an even more diverse branch. If anything, the porn \nindustry is the least discriminating media of all. There is no \"one body \ntype\". They've got straight porn, gay porn, transsexual porn and all before \npeople even started talking about sexuality. I dare to say that porn made a \nlot of today's progress in form of sexuality possible. Does it need to step \nup it's game? Sure, progress is always good.\ufeff",

            "text": "+halafradrimx First: \"Manning up\" is the fault of patriarchy... I also \ndon't like it when people say that and it is especially boys who say it to \neach other. I believe men should be themselves and just have respect for \nother people.\n \nSecond: I also hate quota. I want to be selected for my qualities, not my \ngender. But hey, nowadays men are mostly chosen for their gender and not \nqualities. A lot of incompetent men are on the top just because they are \nmen... Also if you want to sollicitate as a woman you will always get the \nquestion: will you get pregnant? As a man never... That is pure sexism! How \ncan you then be confident or willing to sollicitate if you already know \nfrom the beginning they don't want you just because you have a womb? So \nyeah quotas are made to prevent this kind of discrimination and are just a \nmethod to help competent women get a job. As long as society and men in \nparticular don't recognize the capabilities of women and as long as women \nstay insecure about what they can (because they have been told like forever \nthat they can't do anything and boys are best) then you will have fewer \nwomen on the top than men... Especially in this fucked up society based on \nmens view. But again: I also hate quotas, it is just a means to get jobs \nfor women because men are still too sexist...\n\nI viewed your videos and I can agree with the academic problems that boys \nhave... But that is again fault of patriarchy. Boys can be violent and \nphysical in their childhood and girls cannot. Then it is no wonder that \ngirls are better in academics where you have to sit still. Also boys love \ncomputergames and so more than girls and girls like reading more.. this is \neven so big of a difference that women brains have a better left hemisphere \n(responsible for reading and writing) than mens brains (3D vision, building \nthings etc). If parents just let their kids play whatever they want and \ngive them toys of the opposite sex (so the lego normally for boys to girls \nand a few books or barbie to boys) than this can be helped and the \ndifference between men and women brains will be less big. So yeah, again \nthe problem is patriarchy and especially the consumerism and commercials \nthat exist nowadays. They are so fucking sexist... Oh boys have to play \nwith that and girls with this.. Bah. You know that because girls play less \nwith lego than boys that this has the disadvantage for them to study \nengineer? Yeah, if all kids played lego they all will have equal \nopportunities to study for engineer. Funny right? That the right kind of \ntoys can help kids with their academic choice. And if you look at the girls \nsection in a toy shop then yeah you see that they are just fucking \nconditioning them to be household mothers.. Fucktards of the capitalistic \ncompanies...\n\nAbout the pirates with swordfights.. That is not a woman centered view, \nthat is a psychological view. It could be the first symptom of a \npsychopath, so maybe that teacher was right to mention it to the parents. \nIt is then just up to those parents to see if their son is really sadistic \n(like killing birds and stuff) or not. \n\nAlso: Educational system in America sucks so hard! I mean come on! Here in \nEurope we laugh at it... We say that your government is deliberately \nletting people to be dumb so that they have more power over you guys. So \nyeah if you have such fucked up educational system, no wonder that boys are \ntreated that way. Like the fact that recess is shorter. That is for both \nboys and girls not a good thing.. Hell, I did not like it to be in a \nclassroom too long.. I would fall asleep because of the lack of fresh air. \nSo nope, not only boys problem, that is a general educational problem... \n\nOMG that is just fucking crazy... \"if boys are in trouble so are we all...\" \nGirls are like centuries in fucking trouble and no one gave a shit until \nlast century.. And if we say we want equal opportunities like men, than you \nhave those sexist little pigs that say we already have them, but we \ndon't... We just don't have equality between men and women. And it is a \nfucking cultural problem. Boys are practically raised up (and internet is \nlike fucking a nightmare in this case) that women have to do household \ncleaning and have to care for the children... They are raised up that a \nmens pleasure during sex is more important. And women have been raised up \nwith the same ideas. Which are so fucking stupid. Thank god that we don't \nlive in the 50ies where women were raised up to marry a rich men and not \nfor love.. Luckily we can finally choose who to love because we also can \nwork and earn money (although it is less than what men earn for the same \nfucking shit). The only men who complain about that are those who don't do \nany effort to look after themselves like women had to do for centuries.. \nMoney is not that important anymore, what is also a good thing for mens \nself-esteem I think, because finally a woman choses you because of your \ncharms or looks and not because of your money. (yeah ok you still have \nthose women who only want money, but hey I don't respect those stupid \ncunts... They just do it because they are stupid)\nI also want to say: I know that there are views of boys that we are raised \nup with that are harming for boys like they have to 'man up' and have a \nsixpack, but I don't know more than those.. I was not really raised up very \nfeminine or in a very stereotypical manner.. I also ignored music videos \nbecause of the unrealistic women in it and I don't like to watch typical \nHollywood movies or like those romantic comedies.. I vomit on romantic \ncomedies.. I mean, my boyfriend is more romantic than I am. And he told me \nthat I am apparantly not like other girls, so yeah it can be that my view \nis a bit distorted because I grew up with a firm though of equality and \njustice for everyone and also with a lot of bad experiences with men. Hell, \nI am also vegetarian, because I don't want animals to die especially for my \nneeds and certainly not in the way it happens nowadays...\n\nAbout your other video: Haha I am also anti marriage just because it is a \nfucking conservative christian thing.. And maybe that is the reason of all \ndisadvantages described there? I mean.. If you and your wive are more \nconservative, off course you will have less sex lol, the girl did not had \nto experience her sexual pleasure because of her stupid religion... So not \nthe fault of girls,  because women who are free in their mind and with \ntheir body have a lot of sex and are more experienced and that is good for \nthe boy. Oh wait yes America.. where the slut-shaming is much bigger than \nhere. HELLO off course there are women who don't want much sex if they are \ncalled a whore everytime they do it <_< Americans are so conservative \nconcerning sex. It disgusts me really... \n\nAbout courts favoring mothers: WHYYYYYYY??????? I mean, it is not because \nyou are a woman that you want the children. In fact, men still earn more \nmoney than women, so it would be logical that men would have to take care \nfor their children.. They have the fucking money for it. Yeah so I am also \nagainst that sexist thing that happens in courts.. But a lot of men just \nleft their family behind and didn't pay, so maybe that is why they went so \nstrict about it? \nWhat can be the case is that men are less careful with children than women, \nbut that can be resolved by giving fathers also paternal leave.. That is \nlike so fucking important for the bonding between kid and father. But I \ndon't think America has that? I don't know... Here in my country we have it \nbut it is like a few weeks, which is totally not enough. A month or so \nwould be great.. It would also relieve the mother who just gave fucking \nbirth and whos body is like fucking tired of keeping that thing in for 9 \nmonths... In that way the father will be more responsible and acknowledge \nwhat a mother has to do for that little human being. So paternal leave for \nall men! (but also check for fraud, because it is not an extra holiday for \nmen, it is to help the wive)\n\nlol man cave.. Ok just to be honest. A house has to be fucking clean. \nEspecially when you have babies or do men want them to choke on something? \nI think it is just normal that men help tidy the house.. I mean, do they \nwant rats and cockroaches in the house? Or accidents because of stuff that \nis sitting in the way? I don't think so... I hope so :s else that is fucked \nup.\n\nok, if you can't afford a kid, don't start one. I don't understand people \nwho get pregnant and want to keep the baby although they don't have any \nmoney. First of all: use anticonceptives both of the people. Secondly: do \nan abortus, it will save you money in the long run. I mean if you are just \nfucking a women for your pleasure and you leave her there with your baby \nthen hell yeah she may sue you and you have to go to prison for being \nIRRESPONSIBLE. Men have to learn to use more anticonceptives like condoms.. \nThen they will be free forever! Also talk to your partner about having \nchildren.. How many you want, when you want them. I mean is it that hard? \nYou just make arrangements and if you hear from the way your wive talks she \nwill not respect your choice then fucking divorce her before it is too \nlate. Or just don't get married.\n\nI don't quite understand the message of the video. Why is opting out \nmarriage by men in alarming rate bad if she says herself that it is a \nrational decision? Then I would conclude that it is not alarming, but \nrather a new step in our society... I think too many people are still \nputting too many emphasis on marriage. Personnally I would not get married, \nmy boyfriend would like it, but it is not like I have to. \n\nSo yeah these were my answers. ",

In our \nsociety, though, it is rather common that when women are in emotional \ndistress, she needs help.\n\nBut when a man is having the same problems, he should just \"man up\", stop \nbeing a sissy, grow a pair - of balls - , stop being immature or stuff like \nthat. There is a clear difference from how \"the norm\" treats both women and \nmen, differences of which did not change with neither in the past, nor in \nthe current set of events.\n\nAnd do not take me wrong, I have never been mocked before by any sexual \ndisfunction, nor do I have any. I was merely giving you examples many other \nmen face.\n\nIn fact, I am still a 23 years old virgin man, waiting for a good partner.\n\nAnd no, you are completely wrong about how the current education system \nworks with boys and girls.

Especially when it comes to CEO positions.\n\nSociety never had so many incentives - unfair and anti-competitive ones as \nwell - to promote a better position in women on the work market as we do \nnow. So, your point that we do not encourage women as much as men is not \nonly false but misleading, even if unintentionally.\n\nAbout my PS : I do not mentioned the vagina as a whole, I know it is not \nadvisable to wash the inside of it, as it is hard to drain out any fluids \nfrom the vaginal cavity.\n\nAlso, there are a myriad of ways to prevent candidiasis, ones of which do \nnot include bath.

            "text": "+halafradrimx First: psychological difficulties are not just problems in \nthe head that can away very easily. It is far from that in fact... And it \nwill not go away with only the woman dealing with it, she needs support \nfrom somebody like her partner (this also goes in the other way...)\n\nSecondly: the fact that you have been mocked is stupid. But it is more the \nfault of patriarchy itself... Men make other men feel uncomfortable and \nwomen make men feel uncomfortable just because there exists an ideal image..\nI don't laugh with the premature ejaculation of my boyfriend (yes he also \nhas that) I understand that it can't be perfect. But when I am really horny \nit is indeed a bummer, but hey then we just use sex toys to relief my horny \nbody so, no biggy.. If you are hanging out with people who laugh with your \nsize or with your premature ejaculation then I think it is best for you to \nfind better people to hang with.. People who are more realistic and \nunderstand that everyone has his or her flows..\n\nThe fact that women give up faster than men is especially caused by the \nfact that girls grow up with constantly hearing that they are not good \nenough, that boys are better, that boys will get more money, that boys dare \nmore things, that boys.... So yeah insecurity is in both boys and girls, \nbut the thing is that (and especially in schools also) boys will get to \nknow their limits, they get pushed (sometimes too far), but girls don't \nknow their limits, nobody is pushing them in the same way as boys.  So yeah \nif you are not learnt how to do effort and if you are learnt that you can't \ndo shit and boys are always there to help you (bleh the thought of this \npatriarchal image makes me shiffer) than it is hard to unlearn those things.\nI mean, when I was 11 I had to sew and knit with the girls while all the \nboys could build little wooden chairs. I said to my teacher that I would \nrather do what the boys did and his reply was that it is now like this in \nthe curriculum and that that activity was for boys only. I was pissed, but \nyeah you also learn in that way that boys can do the fun stuff (for me \nbuilding things was fun) and girls had to do the boring stuff (really \nfucking boring the sewing and knitting and I was so bad in it). So if they \njust eliminate sexism in our culture that would already solve a lot of \nproblems that boys and girls are facing together.\n\nIf you want the girl to do more effort in bed than say it to her, ask it \nfrom her. Or ask what is wrong. Because maybe the fact that she doesn't do \nanything is because she has not learnt it, she is not comfortable, she \ndoesn't want it or sth else... and yeah you have also lazy women :p But \nthan it is more their loss because they will less enjoy sex if they do not \ncooperate.. And maybe you should stop having sex with women who don't do \neffort? I mean, how will they learn it if boys still have sex with them? \nMaybe you should tell your dick that she is not worth it and quite and \nleave.. (and off course say that you are no necrophile, that will make them \nthink I guess... You understand the joke? :p because she is lying dead \nstill... Idk if it is a good joke..)\n\nOh about your ps: The vagina may not be washed!!!! only the labia.. And \ncertainly not with those special soaps. Those soaps are also the reason why \na lot of women get yeast infections... It is loud and clearly stated on \nreliable health sources on the internet that you may not wash the inside of \nthe vagina, but only the labia and only with water, nothing else.. So here \nyou go, another thing learnt!\nI don't think women of third world countries don't have yeast infections.. \nI don't know about any statistics.... Every woman can get yeast infection \nif she is white, black, hispanian, asian or if she is old or young even \ngirls who never had sex can have it because it is just a symptom from the \nbody that tells you your vaginal environment is disturbed...  So you really \ncannot prevent it. Or you cannot have sex, not be stressed, not have your \nperiods, not wear any underwear or pants, not be sick... And I mean those \nthings cannot really be avoided right?",

They do not pose a real threat to women's sex life.\n\nHell, everytime I show a woman my penis I could get laughed or mocked due \nto my size, if I have premature ejaculation, comedy mocks men's sexuality \nall the time and many other fearsome implications which could devastate my \nand other men's self-steem.\n\nMen, just as women, have a lot to fear about sex as well.\n\nAnd what do we do about it? We just fasten our belts, puff our chests and \njust try it anyway, you can't achieve nothing in life if you don't at least \ntry.\n\nWhat I really think it gets in the way of women regarding their sex lives : \nthey are unwilling to even put the slightest effort, giving up and cowering \nat the first problems.\n\nThis behavior isn't limited exclusively to sex life only, but at other \nparts of women's lives as well.\n\nP.S : You can easily avoid genital candidiasis by washing the female \ngenitalia. There are special soaps made for that.\n\nIf women from third world countries can avoid it in much more prone to \ncontagious weather, I am sure you can manage yourself.",

            "text": "+halafradrimx Oh god serieusly? You know women brains and men brains work a \nbit differently? Women are more sensitive skins etc if it comes to sex, but \nthe stress and rumination is like killing their sex drives. Also taking \nanticonceptives like the pill etc is doing that (and that is also a warning \nas a side-effect btw).\nMen can get erections of stupid things like it is no big deal.. (not all of \nmen off course, but a lot of them have awkward boner stories) But for women \nit is a lot tougher to get wet... Most of times a woman is not wet when a \npenis comes in, what is bad. Because that is a good example how you can get \nvaginal yeast infection.. If a woman is not wet enough and you penetrate, \nthan you are signing a contract of: \"next week I will not get sex, because \nmy girl is going to treat the yeast infection I gave to her.\"\nbtw: the fact that men sometimes penetrate way too early can also lead to \ndyspareunia.. And that is a psychophysical condition where a women gets a \nlot of pain in the vagina and can not get wet because of anxiety caused by \ntraumas or other distress... A vagina is in fact a real gentle thing and \nneeds a lot of care. But most men don't know that. Hell.. My boyfriend and \nI we are like more than a year together and now he is saying that he did \nnot know how sensitive and how good care we have to take for it... and that \nis just because I talked to him.. If I did not want sex I explained exactly \nwhy... and he understood... That is also the problem with a lot of women: \nmiscommunication about sex. Because sex is still too taboo for this world \n(what is crazy) and they don't know it themselves because they do not do \nresearch (but yeah on the other hand I think men do less research, porn is \nno research off course, that is silly). And I think the problem is enormous \nin America because their schools are even worse than in Europe... And the \nparents are like more taboo about it. Well I also did not talk about it \nwith my parents, but ever since I was young I had an investigators mind and \nI searched a lot on the Internet and I informed myself with reliable \nsources and stuff.. More people should do that in my opinion.. \n\nHere some things written by men about why women have less libido: \nhttp://www.askmen.com/dating/vanessa_100/129_love_secrets.html\n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/loss-of-libido/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nOh yeah like they say here: women lose interest in sex sometimes when they \ngave birth to a child (also they can get dyspareunia from childbirth), they \nare more likely prone to depression which is correlated to less libido etc.\n\nIn global women have more problems to deal with than men... Like pregnancy \nand periods and so on.. Also self-esteem is still lower in women than in \nmen and that is also a big dealbreaker. Also stress from the kids. There \nare still too few men who  really want to help raising kids and that has to \nchange. Kids are really stressful and if women still are the only ones that \nare really raising those kids then yes women have more stress than men.",

Especially when it \ncomes to erections. It is only a natural part of life. It has nothing to do \nwheter said porn movie is better than your wife or whatnot.\n\nWomen aren't immune to aging either, so why not take pills to improve their \nsex drive and thus their love life?

            "text": "+halafradrimx Yeah off course women should also do effort, but I don't \nthink they would like to do effort if they get nothing of pleasure in \nreturn, get it? If I can come every time I had sex or if I enjoy it very \nmuch then I would do effort, because I would also be aroused and horny to \nhave sex again... But if you get nothing...\n\nAlso: a big part of why women have less sex is just work and children. The \nstress women get of householding etcetera affects the taste of sex. Like \nwhen I am stressed out because of my studies I can't have sex.. The mind \nand vagina are more connected with each other than the mind and penis so to \nspeak.. (well I hear men saying 'my dick brain' and that they have \nsometimes or a lot of times no control over it.. ) with women that is less \nthe case. So maybe just let her relax like with a glass of wine or a \nmassage will do the trick (massages are so great to start sex :) it is \nrelaxing and you are touched everywhere and not just the tits and stuff, \nbecause yeah that sometimes get boring lol)\n\nI am against pills. I don't even understand why men take them. I mean, if \nthey already have a higher libido and want a lot of sex more than women do, \nwhy do they have to take them? It is a fact that because of the porn that \nexists nowadays that a lot of men have erectile dysfunctions when having \nsex with a real women. So in those cases it feminist porn would help men to \nget laid in real life, while the 'men porn' is just sucking out your \ndopamine levels and not giving any reward when seeing a real women. This \ncan lead to porn addiction also... So that is not so good either.\nSooooo: nope not for pills.. Rather a good massage, maybe a relaxing bath \nor a good glass of wine will be better.. Just do something so that the \nwoman is relaxed and happy because I am telling you: stress kills womens \nlibido lolzzzz.. So maybe just looking after the kids more often or do the \ngroceries or cooking would do the trick thaha who knows ^^ Every woman is \nalso differently... But like me, I am stress prone so...",

If men just did more effort in pleasuring women than the \nsex would be plentiful! :) I promise! \nBut yeah a female body is not that easy to give pleasure.. Although the \nclitoris is already a good start.. And also eating that pussy is very nice. \nBut you have to be good in it off course. My boyfriend is a natural. He was \nvirgin, but hell did he do it all good in the first time! And the problem \nwith men in the past and still now is that they have no clue at all mostly \nwhat to do.. And women just fake it because they want it to get over \nwith... So maybe they just fake in beginning of relationship to keep the \nboy interested and then be like: fuck his dick and his inexperience... I \ndon't know, but I do know a lot of women don't get orgasms and I do know I \nalso did not got them for a long time. So long I thought it was my body, my \nfault. But then I met the right person who knew what he did (hey he was \nalso a virgin, what a coincidence!) and bam I could  come 10 times in a \nrow. So yeah many women are like left in the dark and think it is their \nbody's fault, but maybe it is just their partners inexperience or egoism... \nAlso: some women don't get orgasms, but can still enjoy sex if it is good \nat least, also: a lot of women have like vaginal yeast infection and then \nyou are forbidden to have sex. So maybe they don't tell their husbands \nabout it because of shame. But that is not to be ashamed a lot of women \nhave it and it can be of stress, wounds, periods etc etc... Also: women \nhave periods and most of them don't like sex during them which is kind of \nunderstandable.. I can tell you other reasons why they don't want sex and \nthey only use the headache as an excuse (and you are correct about headache \nand sex, research shows that correlation indead, however I did not \nexperience it in real life)\n\nTLDR: if you give the woman her pleasure, you'll have a lot of sex even in \nmarriage. If you suck or are egoistic or sth else, you don't.. \n\nI cannot tell you about a porn movie which many women enjoy watching. First \nof all: then I would set up an enquete on the internet else I cannot have \ndata to do my research on. Secondly, female friendly porn is also not that \ngood to find. Thirdly, there is still a HUGE taboo about sex and porn, and \nstudies about female sexuality showed that although women said they did not \nenjoyed the porno movie they watched as much as men, they did get aroused \nin the same way. That is just the cultural taboo speaking throughout \nenquetes. If you measure the vagina itself, you'll see they enjoy it very \nmuch ;) So yeah then we would have to invite all those women to a sex lab \nand measure it like that.. That would be a lot of work, and also very \nexpensive. Because I am not working yet or not yet getting a phd, I cannot \ndo that research myself. But be free to google it! It exists! ;) ",

Don't forget it's recorded to make you come, it's what people \nwants, it's just following the flow of instincts we all have.\n\nMost of the porn include beautiful girls having sex with good looking boys \nfor the pleasure of boys, but you're saying this is completely outside \nreality.\n\nAre you serious ? Blowjobs, hardcore doggystyle, anal, etc. All of this \nalso happens in real life, the only differences is there's no camera to \nworry about so the positions are less weird and the back and forth is more \nlovely, because there's often more love in real life than on camera tape.\n\nWomen generally like to be taken, they sometimes like to be dominated and \nif not they like to dominate and also sometimes do a rampage on their \npartner, exactly like men.\n\nIt can be sweet or hardcore but at the end it's a mix between everything \nwhich isn't that far from what is represented in the porn industry. There \nare also soft porn made for girls that exactly reflect this sweetness.\n\nThere are more and more women behind the camera and all I see from my \nexperience is that most of the time the scene is almost the same than when \nit's a man that record it.\n\nAlso, in 10 minutes you didn't find any real solution about all this beside \nsaying \"we need more women\", which isn't a concrete solution.\ufeff",

To give the woman on screen \npleasure to the satisfaction of mostly men watching. \n\nSo stop complaining that women get objectified in porn because to me it's \nmore the other way around most times. \n\nI will be checking out your porno \"the good girl\" because I'm curious! \ufeff",

One: They earn it. What ever \ntheir status or goals they evaluate themselves and their ability to do what \nthey have to do and they find the path to accomplish it with their own \nresources and ingenuity. The other: (Erika and the stripper fit this one) \nThey own their position. Good, bad. or ugly. What ever it is they make no \nexcuses, apologize to no one and dive in accepting all of the results that \ngo with it as well as whatever they got into it for.\n\nI'm truly disappointed that you don't think more of me. But this is the \nbottom line. I'm a man, not a woman. It is a personal goal for me as a man \nto experience her affections with her near perfect body and explore nearly \nevery inch of her flesh.

However none, no \nmatter what they are rooted in have their own lives to present as testament \nbecause they do not practice what they preach. Or perhaps the practice of \nwhat they believe does not produce a satisfaction they are enthusiastic \nenough about to share that with others. But form an outside perspective, I \nsee it as they don't even practice it themselves and think they have to \nmake the rest of the human population accept it to be able to live it. \n\nHopefully I can be brief and explain this. I just changed jobs, not because \nmy new employer pointed out to me everything wrong with the job I had when \nwe met. I changed because he presented to me a better offer, in addition he \nshowed me the job and the benefits of working for his company. He was able \nto use himself as a primary example of the rewards for making the decision \nto take the path he was presenting to me. In addition the view of the other \nemployees proved to be just as appealing to finally lead me to make that \ndecision. \n\nI was applauding Erika because she didn't apologize for chosen path or \ntailor her view of what that path is as to make it acceptable and avoid \npeople whom would criticize it. By doing so she makes what she promotes far \nmore attractive than the opposition to her. She offers freedom from fear, \nshame, and judgment etc, etc, and unrestricted fulfillment of sexual \ngratification to those whom desire it.

Mainly because you are the first woman I \nhave heard in my life that did not try to tailor and repackage your message \nto be more palatable for those who don't accept your vision, and made no \napology for your vision as well as the expression of it. You are as much \nentitled to your place under the sun as anyone else and there is no need to \npolish it for the acceptance of those who do not agree. It is what it is, \nand living your life as you so chose does nothing to harm those who chose \nwhat is viewed as a more traditional value. That is as far as this \ndiscussion is concerned. This can't be applied to everything, but I'm not \ntalking about everything, I'm talking about this. \n\nI have heard women be unapologetic for embracing non conventional \nexpression of their sexual prowess in a manner not widely accepted before, \nbut it was always associated with an anti male or anti traditional values \nmessage. A self hatred, a rebellion, something else of that nature, or as I \nsaid before a tailoring and repackaging of their ideology as to get our \nahead of criticism and direct it to be more palatable. Never before have I \nheard anyone simply embrace themselves and accept what their choices bring \nto them and where it takes them. I have to admire you for that. Just as \nevery door of opportunity opens to many new ones it also closes doors of \nopportunity not chosen. That's life. If you're going to pick up a ball and \nrun with it, run for the goal line. If their is no goal line, and in you \ncase their isn't, then set the goal of going where it was previously \nthought a goal was unachievable. I think that's where you are headed. Not \njust in porn, but establishing that women and their natural desires are \njust as relevant in this world as the desires women have been expected to \nmeet. Furthermore I believe that women will learn to love themselves more, \nmen will learn to love women more and all will learn more appreciation and \nunderstanding of women for it. \n\nFor your critics, from those who believe themselves to be sincere, to the \nself righteous, even the born again Christian (my comments are no champaign \nor criticism of Christians) have to come to terms with the facts that if \nthey promoted what they believe is right better instead of campaigning \nagainst you, then they would not feel so compelled to dedicated themselves \nto insult and aggressively attack you. One key element is that you live \nwhat you \"preach,\" and you \"preach\" it in a form of sharing your \nenthusiasm.  Your critics do no even practice the life they \"preach,\" and \npreach only, is the one you should be living. ",

There have always been a variety of \nfemale body types in porn. From the bone skinny and tall, to short and \nvoluptuous. To morbidly obese. Big breasts, small breasts. I've seen porn \nmags from the 60's which don't even REMOTELY reflect the \"all women in \nporn\" message you're painting here.\n\nMen come in two flavors. Freaky, fat, gross guys with large cocks, and \nmuscular with large cocks. \n\nIt's true that a lot of modern main stream porn is written and directed by \nmen. That the vast majority of the producers of porn aren't putting out the \nbest, most innovative content. But it's also true that when it comes to \nbeing IN FRONT of the camera? Women have always made more money than men. \nAny woman can make porn. There is a target audience, already developed, \nalready out there.

A penis needs to be present, but the man to whom it is \nattached had better not be too present, lest he threaten to become the \nfocus and the male viewer be threatened with homo-eroticism.

(That is most peoples problem anyway .) There are \nvirtually no men, none, that meet that standard. The finished porn product \nafter editing give you that impression. The don't tell you they shoot the \nmoney shot then shoot 20 mins of sex or re edit 3 mins into 8 mins for the \nvideo your watching. If a man is able to perform in that manner they don't \ntell you about the drugs he takes to allow him to do so that will result in \nall manner of health issues later in his life. They don't tell you that \nthey use camera angles to give the appearance that his cock is lager that \nit is or knowing they can pair him with a small woman that makes him look \nlarger than life. \n\nThen there is the occasional \"real\" life circumstance but then there is \nalso the occasional girl who really does fit the mold for that \"impossible\" \nbody too. They just convince you that what you are seeing is real, so much \nso that you believe it. It's no more real in porn than the world you live \nin every day. \n\nThe real problem with porn is the viewer. We have gone from believe \nsomewhere at sometime maybe just once in our lives we will stumble across \nthat once in a lifetime porn event that we watched in a movie to setting \nthat fantasy as the standard we are measure our own self worth as well as \nvalue others by. Porn is no more real than the fantasy of the inner city \ndrugs lords that money will make you what you wish to be. In both cases, \neven if you live out your fantasy as reality you are going to hit that wall \nof reality sooner or later only to discover there is nothing more there \nwhen you think you have everything than there was when you know you had \nnothing. \n\nFew men can be porn actors simply because few men can perform on camera. \nMen unlike women gain their self value and confidence by what they can do. \nWomen even from early age are more internalized. Their confidence is rooted \nin how they view themselves. That includes but is not limited to their \nphysical appearance. Women do have issues but those issues are not nearly \nas complicated as relevant to the world of porn as mens are. What limits \nmen is by nature men will always be conscious of 1, their cocks being \nsmaller in comparisons to another mans and 2, not being able to perform as \nwell as  someone else. They have no concern for what the industry wants, \nits where they rank. And for a man the only place that has any value at all \nin being No.1. \n\nI didn't have to write that long dissertation to say that, but I work was \ncancelled today due to freezing weather and I've got a lot of extra time on \nmy hands.
