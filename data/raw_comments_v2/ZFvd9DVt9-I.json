The time for poor \ndesign, bad craftsmanship, and leaky interiors is long gone. I bought a \n1976 MG Midget new, and the ownership experience was quite close to the bad \nparts of this video. Worst car I ever owned. It was constantly in the shop \nand cost me a fortune after the warranty expired. A co-worker of mine \ndesperately wanted a Triumph Spitfire, the Midget sister-car, around 1983. \nThe car was a 1980 model, the last year it was made. I strongly advised her \nto reconsider. She didn't listen to me and bought the Spit. A  few months \nlater she pulled me aside and apologized. She couldn't believe it was such \na piece of junk.\nA lot of people who love the \"classic\" British roadsters have never owned \none. When you do the romance fades quickly. At least the Midget and Spit \nhad roll-up windows.\ufeff",
