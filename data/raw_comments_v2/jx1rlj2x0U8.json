DRZ has more travel with better forks, just \nbecause the Honda forks are inverted doesn't mean they work better or are \nbetter. They don't have the adjustments the Suzuki has. I was going to buy \nthe CRF250l but found such a good deal on the DRZ I had to get it. The \nHonda is shorter that's why it may feel lighter to you. As for power you \ncannot compare a 250 with a 400. The Suzuki has proven it's self for years \nnow and I'm a big Honda fan. Have had CR's & XR's for years along with DR \n350's. New the Honda is much cheaper than the Suzuki. The after market \nparts that everyone buys & puts on the bikes cost the same for both bikes. \nThe MPG on the Honda wins of course with it's smaller motor & fuel \ninjection. But I get about 65 MPG on my Suzuki. So this would be an easy \nchoice if your a beginner than the Honda would be the best bike but if \nyou've been riding for awhile then the Suzuki would still be the winner \nafter 15 years of production.\n If money is not a problem for you look at KTM or Husqvarna for the best \ndual sport bike.\ufeff",
