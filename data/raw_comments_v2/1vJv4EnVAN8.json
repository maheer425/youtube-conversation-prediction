What people don't like is when men see women as \nwalking sex objets, or when women date men because of the money they have \n(these are the most sterotyped). Human attraction is complicated and a lot \nof it goes not only looks, but how they smell and sound, the way they walk, \ntalk. Thats why confident people are percieved as more attracted they have \nthat exra oomph. Everyone would rather date a confident person than someone \nthey have to be saying they love them every 5 minutes. The whole social \nmedia and new technology and time changes the way on what we think is \nattractive or not. \n\n\nAlso of effing course both genders are saying that the oppisite gender \ncares more about looks? Who wants to admit that you are shallow? \n\nAlso I don't give a damn about my spelling or grammar. It's 2 am in the \neffing morning. \ufeff",
