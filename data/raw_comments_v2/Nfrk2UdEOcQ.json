For the last 20 years, my life hasn't \nbeen the same. Truth, truth I am telling you, it is only after someone \nleaves this world that by the size of the hole left inside us we discover \njust how much that person was part of us. If you feel this way know that... \nyou are also such a big part of someone's world.",
