Not because of the big mistake alone. \nThat can sometimes happen. But especially since they immediately started to \nclaim it as real scientific fact like shown in many other claims and \ncomments by those involved. Shame, shame. Real shame.\n\nAnd this now follows many other big embarrassments for US science in recent \nyears like the NASA new life claim that turned out to be fake and based on \ncompletely bogus science. Like the false claims by Fermilab of a Higgs \nBoson signal just months before CERN was about to make the actual discovery \nbased on much larger and more precise data sets (like here with ESA and \nPlanck). Like the recent claim of 1 US and 1 Japanese university of a major \nstem cell breakthrough that turned out be a total fake and actual fraud. I \ndon`t mind big mistakes. Just when things are claimed as facts so easily by \nscientists in this country. It is no wonder that Scientific American \nrecently reported on the fact that many US scientists have been moving to \nEurope in the last 5 years. Where much larger projects and agencies are now \nbeing build in an enormous number of research fields following the success \nof first European cooperation projects like CERN. \n\nThis really makes even more scientists not just from the US but around the \nworld move to Europe where budgets and science projects are growing \ndramatically. Utterly massive projects like the HUMAN BRAIN PROJECT, the \ngiant European XFEL, the giant ESS (European Spallation Source), the EU \nhosted ITER Fusion facility, the worlds largest European Extremely Large \nTelescope, the scaling up of ESA science projects to ever more fields (like \nPLANCK), the CERN expansion including LHC expansion, the giant EU SPARC \nrobotic program, the absolutely incredible ELI laser program to name just a \nvery few. And nothing comparable in these fields is happening in the US \naccept for James Webb, but that is a joint NASA - ESA project that will \neven be launched on a European rocket.
