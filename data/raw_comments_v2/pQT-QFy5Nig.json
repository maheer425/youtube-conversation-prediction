Even though Home actually is \nserious and not funny. Its something my brother hates very much. Dont know \nhow to convince my brother into liking it but its just him. Anyways these \nare my rankings for the songs:\n\nHome: 4th place. I dont know why but it is kinda boring for me. And serious.\n\nYou Cant Win: 3rd or 2nd. Im more of a 2nd place person for this.\n\nSlide Some Oil To Me: 5th. I kinda hate this song a lot. \n\nEase On Down The Road: 1st or 2nd. Its not exactly 1st but I pick 1 1/2.\n\nNo Bad News: 1st. Its so intresting how Mabel King uses her voice. Reminds \nme of Louie Armstrong singing La Vie En Rose!\n\nI have one more song\n\nI forgot the name but it has something to do with motorcyle monkeys or the \ngraffiti munchkins.\n\nAh ha!! Got it! The graffiti munchkins!\n\nThe song they sing is so wonderful and I can never stop singing it but it \ncant beat No Bad News. In my opinion in ranking its 3rd. I dont know why. \nIts not as good as No Bad News or You Cant Win. \n\nOk im off to do a Wizard of Oz!!!",
