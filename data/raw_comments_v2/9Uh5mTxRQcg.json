            "text": "The W+, W- and Z bosons interact with the Higgs field and acquire mass. \nThis means that they are a short range force, unlike electromagnetic field \nwhich is a long range force.\n\nHow does having mass make something a short range force I hear you ask. \nWell, a force is described by quantum field theory as many virtual \n(borrowed energy) bosons being emitted by a particle \"bumping\" into other \nparticles. So two electrons can be thought of as particles emitting many \nvirtual photons. It is the virtual photons pushing against the other \nelectron that means that electrons repel.\nThe more energy that the virtual photon has the less time it can exist for, \nit essentially exists on borrowed time, and the amount of time is inversely \nproportional to the amount of energy that it has. This is why there is a \nstrong repulsion when electrons are close, i.e. the virtual photons with \nmore borrowed energy still exist to push at close range. At greater \ndistances it is only the lower energy photons that can exist for that long \nto push the other electron, so the force is weaker (all of the high energy \nphotons have stopped existing at this range). Because photons do not have a \nrest mass, very very low energy photons can exist at very long distances \naway from the electron generating them and so can exert a force at long \ndistances.\nBecause W bosons already have mass, there is a set maximum time they can \nexist for, therefore they can never act at a great distance. They cannot \nafford it, virtual energy wise.\nDoes this sound really weird? Well it is a bit of a simplification and it \nis also just weird.",
