Five Nights At Freddys is a great game series don't get me wrong, I \nlove the story and find so much intrigue and mystery in it, but is it \nscary? Ha, NO! The same thing can be seen in pretty much all the games. An \nanimatronic jumpscares someone and they go \"Damnit, I was so close. Oh \nwell, better try again\" instead of \"AAAHHHHH!!! God....ughh that gave me a \nf**king heart attack!\". It has a great story behind it, but is not even \nclose to being scary, with the tension always making up for it. Slender was \nconsistently scary, with the free ability to roam giving more fear to \nbuildup, as Slender Man would actively pursue you, the game ambience and \nsound effects contributing to the horror. And your lack of any form of \ndeterrent to him adds to this. I really hope that when the Five Nighrts At \nFreddys movie is out, that is it. There is no fourth game, and the story is \nclosed with theorists such as myself still able to ask questions and come \nup with ideas every now and then. That would be the perfect time for \nSlender to make one hell of a return to the horror gaming genre!\ufeff",

If you watched Mark play it first before you played it you \nmight have seriously ruined it. That first playthrough was the most \nterrifying game ever.

That's what a novelty scare is, Amnesia The Dark Decent... no matter \nhow many times I play it or watch someone play it that game gets me every \ntime. Like Silent Hill 2 they never get old.

Really, I can disagree \nwith NONE of what you have said, and it's not only disappointing to see no \nLEGITIMATE expansion of Slender in sight, but it's almost scary (ironic, \nisn't it?). The horror industry of video games seems to be mainly (though \nnot anywhere near completely) relying on the small-name, Source Engine \nmaterial, and to see a whole genre that was once ruled by Resident Evil and \nDead Island get reduced to such obscurity. Games like The Last Of Us have \nhelped keep horror gaming alive, but for how long? I agree with you; \nSlender could be the Batman of gaming right now, if it tried. The game we \nneed.",
