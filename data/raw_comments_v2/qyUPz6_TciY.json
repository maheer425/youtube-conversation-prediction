It seemed also good to \nme to go and bathe, having heard that the bath had its name (balneum) from \nthe Greek Bahavelov, for that it drives sadness from the mind. And this \nalso I confess unto Thy mercy, Father of the fatherless, that I bathed, and \nwas the same as before I bathed. For the bitterness of sorrow could not \nexude out of my heart. Then I slept, and woke up again, and found my grief \nnot a little softened; and as I was alone in my bed, I remembered those \ntrue verses of Thy Ambrose. For Thou art the \n\n\"Maker of all, the Lord, \nAnd Ruler of the height, \nWho, robing day in light, hast poured \nSoft slumbers o`er the night, \n\n\"That to our limbs the power \nOf toil may be renew`d, \nAnd hearts be rais`d that sink and cower, \nAnd sorrows be subdu`d.\"\"\n\n-Augustine (on grieving the death of his mother)\ufeff",

            "text": "+Mambochief\nMambochief,\n\nYou are correct in the distinction between the meaning of \"cause\" or \n\"allow;\" however, in the middle of a trial they can seem very similar. \n Remember that this is an artistic song not a book on doctrine.  I listened \nto the song 2 more times and then the video they did on the inspiration of \nthe song to make sure I was clear before I wrote anymore.  \n\nDavid, a man after God's heart, wrote many of the Psalms and even he \nstated, \"Why, O LORD, do you stand far off?\"  Was God far off?  No.  And \nyet David in his anguish felt as if God were far off.  And while we know \nthat \"Every good and perfect gift is from above...\" (James 1:17) it can \nfeel often times quite the reverse down here.  I don't read David's words \nand doubt God.  I read them and think, \"Wow, I'm not alone!  David, a man \nafter God's own heart, even felt this way!  \n\nI think the \"test\" of the sincerity of this song is the rest of what he \nsings.... \"yet will I serve thee... still I worship thee... sing a song to \nthe One who is all I need.\"  Obviously this person isn't blaming a \n\"vengeful God who takes.\"  He sings and uses words from Job because that is \nhow he (his mother) felt.  He's saying that whatever happens, he's going to \npraise the name of the Lord.  We are listening to the cry of a woman (the \nsongwriter's mother) who just lost her husband.  She beat on his dead chest \nwith her fists as she was hyperventilating.  We are hearing the words of a \nbroken, anguished woman.  I was angry with my brother for drowning.  Is \nthat biblically accurate?  Of course not!  But it's what I felt for a while!\n\nWhen the preacher comes in the song his message it is not \"a vengeful God \nwho takes,\" but rather he admonishes us to not look upon what is seen and \nsay, \"it is meaningless,\" but to not lose heart and know that every \naffliction has meaning whether it's cancer, slander, or sickness and to \n\"preach these truths to ourselves.\"\n\nSongs, like stories are for many purposes.  Some are for doctrine but \nothers help us understand the human condition.  This song expressed what I \nhave often felt while suffering and frankly, I'm thankful he put into words \nthings what many have gone through and felt.  I can relate.  This helps and \nis cathartic for me.  I pray, Mambochief, that you have grace enough to \nallow others to express what they are feeling, while still serving the King \nof Kings in obedience.",

            "text": "\"Allow\" or \"Cause\" are not semantic trivialities friend...not by a long \nshot. They are the difference between  and victim and perpetrator. When \nPaul was harming the early Church, throwing them into prison and complicit \nin their death as in Stephen, when Jesus met him on the road to Damascus, \nHe didn't say it was the Father that was ruining, slaying and taking from \nthe early church. He approached the perpetrator and ask Saul why are you \npersecuting me? Because Christ who is God identified Himself not with the \nperpetrator and persecutor but with the persecuted. God is not an abusive \nparent or abusive spouse who beats the snot out of his 'loved ones' and \ndemands they respond with the sweetness that becomes them well.\n\nJesus is the LOGOS of God, meaning all the Father wanted to say about \nHimself was exhibited in the son. You look at how Jesus dealt with people \nand that was an exhibition of the Father's heart...when they were hungry he \nfed them, when they were cast out(leper, woman with the issue of blood, \nprostitute with the alabaster jar, the woman caught in adultery, the woman \nat the well, Zaccheus) Jesus showed them acceptance, love and compassion. \nThat was the Father's heart. The demoniac in Gadarenes, he delivered, the \nwoman with the spirit of infirmity he told her you are loosed from your \ninfirmity, that was the Father's heart on display. He is not in the \nbusiness slaying, taking from or ruining His children...What about Jesus' \ndeath you ask me? Jesus' suffering and death was a ransom paid for the \nredemption of humanity. A one time event that took place in a space of less \nthan 24 hours with resurrection 3 days later, never more to die.\n\nWhen the Pharisees attacked Christ's ministry, He said they are of their \nfather the Devil, he never said, the Father is doing this to me. He knew \nwho his enemy was and who is the real abuser of our species. You don't have \nto be sorry about what I've seen or have been through. i just shared that \nto point out point out that bad things happen because we live a fallen \nworld but let us never act as if God is the perpetrator of man's death, \nplunder and ruin. The old saints used to sing what a friend we have in \nJesus, all our sins and griefs to bear...the new saints engage in poetic \nhowever soulish/country song type 'worship' that comes across as a weird \ncross between spiritual masochism and the Stockholm Syndrome.

That's why we are called \"children of God.\"  So we are debating over \nsemantics, particularly over the words \"allow or cause.\"  Without \npersonally knowing the beliefs of these singers, from the lead singer's \ntestimony of how he came to write the song, I believe he as I believe that \nwhatever havoc the enemy wants to do in our lives has to be cleared by our \nheavenly Father - so in essence He's in on it as He allowed it.

If you read Job, you will see that God did not bring him his \nsuffering; it was from Satan, but God permitted it. Why did he permit it? \nBecause he knew what was on the other side! Not only Job, but also his \nfriends, were brought closer to God through Job's suffering. And a wrong \nbelief that they espoused, that only those who were sinners suffered, was \ndispelled. Job became more blessed after his suffering, because he \nsuffered. What God does is to bring great things from our pain, and \nblessings from our loss. \"And we know that in all things God works for the \ngood of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.\" \n(Romans 8:28). He also said, \"In this world you will have trouble, but take \nheart; I have overcome the world.\" And, \"No servant is greater than his \nmaster.\" Jesus suffered terribly while he was here. Should I, then, expect \na trouble free life, if my master suffered?",

If you say yes, you believe God has ordained that circumstance. \n9/10 times that circumstance is not fun because some kind of \"bad thing\" \nhad to happen to \"break us\" to put us in a position where God can use us. \nOnce again, back to Job, who does Job attribute the taking of his children \nto? God. \"the Lord gives, and the Lord takes away.\" not \"the devil takes \naway\". Why? Because God is in control of the entire situation, as we see \nthe Devil cannot even move against God's own without permission. God ruins \nus, so that he may build us back, better and stronger. ",

            "text": "This song is based on Job.  It is a clear picture of the sovereignty of God \neven over Satan.  Yes Satan ravishes Job's life but it is clearly only \nbecause the Lord in His wisdom has allowed it.  Job acknowledges that God \nis ultimately in charge of the whole affair when he says \"the Lord has \ngiven and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord\".  And \nscripture says in all of this Job accused God of no wrong.  Job 13:15 says \n\"though he slay me, I will hope in him\".   Job is trusting in God and the \n\"he\" that slays is this very same God that he is trusting in.  It is a \ntestament to the trust Job places in the God he follows that if God in His \nwisdom sees it is best to slay Job in this life Job's heart will hope in \nhim confident that he will redeem even this slaying for his good.  It is a \ndifficult thing for our fallen finite hearts to understand that a \nsovereign, holy, loving God who is free of sin and never violates His \nholiness does allow for suffering in this broken world.  It is broken \nbecause of our sin and we suffer greatly under the curse, but for the \nChristian, bought by the blood of Christ, EVERYTHING now works for our good \nand God's glory.  There is no dualism at play in the life of the Christian \nbecause even our sin, even our failures, and the evidences of the curse \nthat remain in us are redeemed for our good and His glory.  EVERYTHING! \n This is made so clear throughout scripture.  The prosperity gospel has \nclouded the understanding of many and the same folly that led Job's \n\"counselors\" to give their poor advice has led Christians to miss the \nrichness of knowing that in suffering, disease, loss, failure, falling etc \nthere is the cross... redeeming all of it for our good and the praise of \nGod.  I sin but as a Christian that sin has already been dealt with and \nadequate justice meted out such that even my mistakes and sins are being \nused by God to work good for me and achieve His own glory through it.  Do \nwe then sin that grace might much more abound... no scripture says... and \nyet even in our great sinning grace does abound for the regenerate heart \nthat is truly humbled before the cross.
