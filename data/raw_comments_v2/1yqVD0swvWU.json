            "text": "The problems with The Ring were:\n1. It cannot be used by an elf/wizard -> it would eventually result in the \ncarrier becoming a new Dark Lord\n2. It cannot be cast away, because it has a way of finding it's way back to \nits master. It cannot stay in Rivendell or anywhere else, because Sauron's \narmies will probably eventually find it.\n3. The West wouldn't take it - they don't intervene in the problems of \nMiddle-Earth\n4. It can only be destroyed in Mount Doom. Also, if succeeded, it would \nmean instantaneous defeat of Sauron (Mordor's structures will collapse, and \nSauron lose his mind control over his armies).\n\nSo, they concluded that the best way of doing it would be sending it into \nMordor by a non-immortal being (human/dwarf/hobbit), who wouldn't become a \nthreat if he used the ring. Frodo volunteered, that seemed to be FATE to \nGandalf (especially because he and Bilbo had proven to be very resistant to \nThe Ring, and they are small and unnoticeble, making a hobbit the best one \nto sneak undetectably into Mordor).\n\nI agree that using eagles is too dangerous: 1. There is a chance they \nwouldn't accept (they follow Manwe, who believes in Iluvatar's plans, who \nseems to favour the Fate of Frodo) 2. Sauron would probably expect an \nattack from Eagles, and send the fellbeasts against them\n\nSome other ideas:\n1. Using stone giants - nah, they probably wouldn't even understand what is \nwanted from them\n2. Quickly finding and assembling the Army of the Dead\nI think it's quite possible. \"Even though not needing weapons, the weapons \nof the Enemy could not harm them.\" Send a portion of that army to conquer \nMordor, and the other half to defeat Saruman. Although Sauron would notice \nsuch an army coming, and make for a run. Still, that would open a way for \nFrodo to walk into Mordor freely, having the dead bodyguarding him.\n3. Using the power of Oath to overcome The Ring's sedative powers on its \nwearer\nFeanor and his sons took an Oath so powerful, that they could never stop \nhunting for the Silmarils. If they failed to do so, then \"o the everlasting \nDarkness doom us\". The Oath bound them for centuries, and doomed them all.\n\nWhy not would Gandalf take an Oath like this: \"I swear to allmighty \nIluvatar, that I will use The Ring to destroy Sauron and Saruman; after \ntheir destruction make sure it is destroyed using Frodo; and I shall never \nuse it against an elf/human/dwarf/hobbit/...; otherwise my body will perish \ninstantly, and my spirit ripped out.\"\n\nThere is a strong chance the Oath would be strong enough to overcome The \nRing, since it was given to Iluvatar, the God. And if it didn't, a \ndisciplined mind like Gandalf's would still be strong enough to resist it \nuntil he has defeated both Sauron and Saruman, and then \"become the next \nDark Lord\", as he said. But doing so, his body would perish instantly, just \nlike happened to Sauron when Isildur cut off The Ring; and Frodo or sb that \nis constantly accompanying Gandalf and watching his every move, would pick \nThe Ring up and destroy it.\n\nThe only question is whether Gandalf would make such a self-sacrifice (his \nspirit may remain evil even after The Ring is destroyed).\n\n4. Using Palantirs (Denethor's/Saruman's) to mind control Sauron\nIf even Aragorn could resist to Sauron, then I'm sure that if the three \nelvish ringbearers united their powers, they would make Sauron their \npuppet, just like Saruman became Sauron's puppet. Although Sauron + \nSaruman's mind united would be a greater challenge. Still, they could have \ndone it after Saruman was defeated.\ufeff",
