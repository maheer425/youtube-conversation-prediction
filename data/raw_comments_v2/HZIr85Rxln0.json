The whole room suddenly \nfilled up with sunlight, and since then, I felt more at peace.

Fear and anxieties will \nhinder you from proclaiming Christ to the world.  \n\u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come \nto bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his \nfather, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against \nher mother-in-law. And a person's enemies will be those of his own \nhousehold. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, \nand whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\" \n--Matthew 10:34-37\nChrist calls us to Him and He does everything for His glory.  I was afraid \nat one point of giving up my life.  I mean it was bad.  Addicted to all the \nwrong things, living on my terms, engaging with my family in sexist and \nracist rants (you name it I probably did it outside of illegal drugs.).  I \ndidn't want to loose anything I had, but as I am growing in Christ I find \nmyself separating even from those I love and don't want to lose. The more I \nlearn the more I want to cut the ties completely but I know that it is a \nbelieving Christians job to share the gospel not just meditate in it and \nyou will loose people and things.  It goes to Luke 9:23:\n\"And he said to all, \u201cIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself \nand take up his cross daily and follow me.\"",
