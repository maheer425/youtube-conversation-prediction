P.S. let niet te veel op zogenaamde \nmuggenzifterige landgenoten die zich voor doen als engelstalige experts. Je \nmoet maar denken: zolang je geen aanmerkingen krijgt van authentieke \nengelstaligen is er niets mis mee. Ik kon je in ieder geval goed volgen:) \nM.V.G. de zoon van een voormalig internationaal chauffeur.",
