I Googled you, and praise Google, I \ndiscovered vlogbrothers. You guys completely understand how I think. I \ndon't really have any nerdy friends, so it's nice to have two nerds who I \ncan nerd out whenever I need to, and that's a great thing. Even if you guys \nare behind that camera in your homes or airports or hotels, and I'll \nprobably never get to meet either of you in person, I'm grateful for you \nboth and Nerdfighteria in general for giving me a place where I can show \nthis other side of me my school friends don't really get to see.\ufeff",

IF YOU READ THIS, YOU'LL BASICALLY BE READING MY THOUGHT PROCESS \nOF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN AND HOW I STARTED WATCHING JOHN AND HANK!* I \nhave absolutely no clue how I found the Vlogbrothers channel. it wasn't \nbecause of any of their other stuff, and no one recommended it to me. I \nwasn't even a hardcore watcher until I decided to watch all of the VB's \nvideos from start to end. Ugh, now I'm sitting here trying to remember when \nI started watching these. It was around the making of the TFIOS movie, \nbecause my little sister's friend was in it and I wanted to see if he \nmentioned her at all. She was the young Hazel, and he didn't. Let's \nsee....I read my first John Green book like three years ago, and it was \nTFIOS. I wasn't watching Vlogbrothers then. The movie was announced in \n2013, by which I still wasn't watching. Wait, no. I remember this person \nwalking down the bus aisle with a DFTBA shirt and I knew what it meant. So \nI definitely started watching when I was a sophomore (last year). BUT WHEN? \nI think the first video I watched was sharpie face, where John talks about \ncrazy eyes. Oh my god. I honestly cannot remember, and I don't even know if \nthe aforementioned memories are true! Well, I tried, Nerdfighters. I guess \nmy only estimate is that I found the channel around the time that sharpie \nvideo came out. What a journey this has been, eh?\ufeff",
