Or do you run around naked, \nsniff peoples assholes and shit outdoors? And do you think that if you took \na dump in your neighbors garden and then said to him: Hey man, that\u00b4s \nnatural, Lions do it too!\nSecond when I see those fellows from the hunting associations drunk in a \npub and bragging and arguing over who shoot the biggest and most beautiful \ndeer, then I am sorry, my friend, I cannot share your opinion about hunting \nand hunters. It's not like nature has taken care of itself the last ... \n how old is life as we know it again...? Oh yeah, only about 500 Millions \nyears. And how pathetic is someone who can\u00b4t enjoy the beauty of nature \nwithout killing fish, deers, birds, etc. for fun.\nAnd overpopulation? Now honestly, if you think that deer population, or any \nanimal population is threatening do overpopulate the planet and destroy \nlike all live habitat, if we humans didn\u00b4t kill, torture and eat them, then \nI think it is a bit weird that the global media are not full of headlines \nlike: COW CRISIS IN INDIA \u2192 EAT MORE COWS or DEER CATASTROPHY IN ALASKA, \nTHE HUNTERS OF THE WORLD MUST DO THEIR DUTY ONCE AGAIN. Nature knows how to \ntake care of itself, problem is, this evolutionary accidents homo sapiens \nis convinced that he knows everything better and so he must intervene \neverywhere where he sees fit.\nBut if the cyle of killing for fun,bloodshed, cruelty, torture and death \nsounds good and natural to you, then, my dear fellow, maybe a little more \nskepticism about the things society thinks as normal, good and necessary \nwouldn\u00b4t harm you too much.

But, we are building bridges and such, so that we can make sure that \nthere isn't a major decrease in animal population, that why there are \nplaces where you cannot fish, or hunt at.
