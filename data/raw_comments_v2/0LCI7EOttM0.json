Some \nof the students saw what happened but they kept silent, and no one dared to \ndefend me or stand up for me. I cried in class when the teachers accused me \ntoo. Fake friends wasn't enough, the teachers didn't believe me either. \n\n      I also bullied a guy in my class. His name was Jacky and we all \nbullied him and even a fight occurred between me and him. I was trying to \nfit in, trying to be cool so my friends will accept me. Which not until the \naccusation from my \"friend\" that I learned about TRUST. \n\n     I saw Jacky last year while playing badminton. He was playing with his \nfather and I was ashamed to confront him. Ashamed of what I did, scared \nthat he will notice me. I wish I have the courage to say \"sorry\" to him \nthat day but I just couldn't. I wasn't matured enough. Guess I might not \nget the chance to say \"sorry\" to him anymore.\n\n     I think that was the time where I become super selective about my \nfriends, not wanting to open up. I defend the weak, speak up for the unfair \nand just trying to help these people from everyone else.

You at least have to try to stand \nup.

Long story short I see this little wanna-be \nthug walking into his low-rental ghetto house while I drive by. This \nbrought back flashbacks, so I decided to post an ad on craigslist saying \nthat I was shooting a porno there and that \"EVERYBODY IS WELCOME\" and other \nthings on top of that.
