I must say one thing that LGBT \npeople would not like though, and that is: It is up to YOU to educate us \nstraights.  YOU are in the minority so are pretty much unknown to most \npeople. People always fear the unknown and fear brings aggression and \nviolence. As I told my paraplegic boyfriend years ago, I don't know what it \nfeels like to live in a wheelchair, I don't know what you need or how you \nwant me to act towards you and around you. It's not up to me to learn these \nthings, it's up to you to teach me.\nPanti is doing that in her articulate and powerful but friendly way, and I \ngreatly admire her for doing so.

There are straight \nmen (not gay) who also cross dress, they even have meeting places where \nthey can cross dress together. So, these are two separate things and you \nshouldn't confuse them. For gay men, dressing like a woman is a way \nperforming, its an act, its playful, and not intended to be a sexual \nexpression per se'. Few gay men go out cross dressed to work (unless their \nwork is a club and they are there performing professionally, in which case \nthere are other performers, and they may be gay or straight, its just \ntheater, female impersonation.)Now about nature. It turns out that \nhomosexual pairings happen in just about every animal you can name. Its a \nperfectly normal thing. In fact one study suggests when rats overbreed, the \nnumber of gay rats born increases dramatically, think of it as natures \nbuilt-in population control. Makes sense, doesn't it? Only people have the \nconversation about morality with regards to sex. In fact our religious \nhistory has left us kind of messed up about sex in general and \nhomosexuality in particular. The roots of homophobia spring from our Judaic \nreligious past, when Mose's declared that Gays were an abomination. Of \ncourse he said the same thing about dining on shell fish, so if you've ever \nhad a lobster dinner, congratulations, you've just committed a sin of equal \nweight before God as having same sex relations.The only reason you put \npeople in a colony is because you hate or fear them. Otherwise you let them \nlive and they let you live and you go about your business not worrying \nabout it. That's what Panti was talking about. He just wants to go about \nhis business not thinking about it. Its all he desires. He wants you to \ncompletely ignore him, because his life is his and its none or your or my \nbusiness, just like the thousands of straight people you pass on the street \nevery day. Do you ever wonder what they do with their sex organs? Whether \ntheir sinners or saints? No, its none of your business. Treat Panti that \nway, and everything will work out just fine. By the way its perfectly fine \nto have an opinion. Acting on that opinion is the problem here.Vaya con \nDios.",
