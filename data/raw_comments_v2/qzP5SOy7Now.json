Either be bold enough to make them gay and say it outright, or \nleave it alone.\n\nOn the other hand, I love Bilbo. He's funny, exciting, and just all around \nmore pleasant. And I just love Martin Freeman as an actor in both The \nHobbit and Sherlock, which may cause some bias, but I enjoyed reading The \nHobbit far more than LOTR, so I'm not entirely sure.\n\nPersonally, I think Tolkien spent way too many pages/chapters of talking. \nOr merrymaking. Or describing of scenery. Like it's great he can make a \nworld and describe it as if he's actually been there, but I don't care that \nthe Road winds around a hill, especially if the party is wandering through \nthe forest, avoiding the Road. That said, I think greed is what drove The \nHobbit being made into a trilogy. At most, it was enough for 2 movies with \na total runtime of about 5 hours, but 8 hours from one book is ridiculous.",

I say interpretation because of course a film adaption will alter \ncertain things. Also, any true Tolkien/LOTR film trilogy fan would \nabsolutely love that they're throwing in the additional stuff, especially \nthe conflict with Sauron. That \"stuff\" is like nerd-galore. Don't think of \nit as a method to cash in, but instead as a visual bonus to the great \nmaterial that we've read and enjoyed. After that, hate the plot and CGI all \nyou want, that's a completely different realm of argument. \ufeff",

But \nwhen you do the opposite, as in Harry Potter where you have almost the same \namount of films as the books, everybody suddenly complains about the fact \nthat filmmakers decides to exclude some of the story because of not enough \nrunning film time for these excluded scenes to fill in. Then, if they \nwould've added 2 more films people would think of the production company as \nidiots looking to earn more money but instead it might be because of the \nfact that there were vital parts that needed to be included in the films to \nunderstand.\n\nLegolas did not have a role in the book, but in the film he had, because it \nmade perfect sense that he should've been there! And as of all the rest of \nthe problems people complain about, get over it. It's done. Peter Jackson \ncan do whatever the fuck he wanna do. \n\nSo my conclusion is:\n\nBe frikkin' happy about that there's 3 movies instead of 1 or 2. Goddamnit, \nPeter Jackson is making it possible for us viewers to enter the incredible \nworld of Tolkien for a longer period of time! Stop complaining.\ufeff",

Yeah, that's a really smart move.\n\nLook, I'm a huge LoTR and Hobbit fan myself, and a somewhat rare one in \nthat I actually dig both the moves and the books. They're different and \nboth have their upisdides and downsides. The movies look awesome, but they \nalso do have their weaknesses for sure. +Taylorwest626 did makes valid \npoints about it: the main villain is very bland and unneseccary, and the \nmovies overall have a lot of bloat in them, a part of which is caused by \nthe studio going over the top and wanting to play with the 3D gimmickry.\n\nWhilist I did enjoy the movies in a casual way (that is,I don't take the \nHobbit movies too seriously, I appreciate them for the aesthetic and the \nfew very extremely awesome bits) I can totally understand why a lot of the \nTolkien fanbase doesn't. And I don't go around the internet telling people \nwho don't like them that they're stupid for not sharing my views any more \nthan I go around telling people they're \"stupid\" for not liking the same \nbands that I like.\n\nPeople have varying preferences when it comes to art.
