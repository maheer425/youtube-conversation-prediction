The English \nwere well known to discriminate against the Irish and the Scottish. Hell, \nin America, there were, \"No Irish Need Apply\" signs on stores, meaning that \nthe Irish couldn't work there. The Irish were treated almost as bad as \nblacks. Italians were treated badly too, but I'm getting off-topic. Red \nhair is often associated with being Irish and Scottish, as most of them \nhave it. The word ginger is also a racial slur, so please do not use it. \nUse redhead instead, it's just better. Plus, we are a minority, ANY \nminority can be oppressed. Saying redheads can't be is just proof of \noppression.\ufeff",
