The Camaro is going to get a complete redesign, so if you don't like \nthe current one the next one might suite you better!\n\nI currently have... too many muscle cars BUT I'm looking to sell my daily \ndriver (2008 Mustang GT) for a 2013-14 GT with the 5.0.  Since there are so \nmany Coyotes on the road now mod prices are dropping.  I plan on adding:\n- Full exhaust, long tube ceramic headers, H-pipe, no cats, Borla ATAK \nmuffler.  Setup is about $1,200\n- Boss 302 intake manifold, throttle body, and cool air intake.  Less than \n$1000\n- A 93 octane tune that will (with the previous mods) bring me to about 470 \nhorsepower at the crank. Good tunes are about $400\n- I will either get the 5.0 with the optional 3.73 rear end gear or upgrade \nthe default 3.33 to 3.93 to dramatically help the quarter mile time by \nkeeping you in the best horsepower range on the tachometer. IF I need to \nupgrade the rear end gear it will be about $800\n- Get some 10 inch wide rims (like the GT500) so I can fit very fat, sticky \ntires on the back to help with launch.  I would propably get stock size or \nsmaller on the front so it looks like an old school setup.  Maybe $1500? \nHaven't priced these out that extensively.\nAND BOOM that's less than $30,000 for a daily driver that would smash \nanyone on the quarter mile.",

            "text": "+Jimmy Hostetler Yeah some people have this weird idea that no matter what \nAmerican car you buy it will never be as good as a European car. But \nAmerica has produced some truly brilliant cars in that past couples years: \nGT500, GT, Boss 302 LS, 1LE, Z/28, ZL1, ZO6, ZR1, ST, Ford GT, SRT10 ACR, \nCTS-V, Hellcat. I mean a true gearhead won't be able to deny this. If you \nwant a BMW because that's what you're in to then go ahead, it doesn't \nbother me. But don't act like a BMW in the same price range as a ZL1 or \nGT500 is going to be as good. BMW's are more expensive, they're luxury cars \nso you'll have to pay a lot more to get something that can compete with \nyour relatively cheap sports cars.\n\nI have to agree, I'm pretty sure they got it right with the '14s. I didn't \nlike the '15s at first but after seeing a GT350 first hand, they've really \ngrown on me. I really like the '12 Camaros, especially the ZL1. I just \ndon't like the direction they took them with the current model year. But \nthat should all change when the '16s come out, right? I mean like I said \nI'm pretty much a Ford guy but I enjoy all American cars and really any \nsolid performance car (European or otherwise).

            "text": "+Nickolas Little So true about sending them across the ocean! I know a guy \nthat bought a BMW 335i. It was something like $60,000 with a straight 6 \nturbo that made 300hp.  If you prefer BMW's for looks or status then by all \nmeans, please buy one.  But this guy actually thought his car could \noutperform American cars in a similar price range.  A mutual acquaintance \nof ours purchased a 2012 Camaro ZL1.  The funny thing is that those two \ncars cost about the same price (within $2000 sticker) and the BMW 335i's \nspecs were nearly identical to a 6 cylinder Camaro or Mustang.  The ZL1 on \nthe other hand had about double (580) the horsepower.  When it came to \nperformance he was simply embarrassing himself.\n\nPersonally I would take any comparable 2011-14 Mustang over a 2011-14 \nCamaro, ESPECIALLY the 2013-14 GT500.  That is probably my favorite car of \nall time and sports 80 horsepower over the ZL1 Camaro.  2015 is a different \nstory however... I would take a 2015 Camaro 1LE over a 2015 Mustang GT \nPremium.\n\nBut I meant what I said about pre-2015 Mustangs, I am actually actively \nlooking to purchase a lightly used 2013-14 Mustang GT right now!

            "text": "+Jimmy Hostetler The Mustang is undeniably the best sounding American \nmuscle car out there. The '14 GT500 was voted the second best sounding car \nin the world (behind the 458 I believe). Yeah some trim levels of the \nMustang seems to be autozone stickers (Like a Saleen appearance pack or the \nRoush body kit). The Camaro SS is garbage compared to the GT, the \nZL1/Z28/1LE package is undeniably great. As a Ford guy I have to admit when \nChevy does a good job. And ditto on the Challenger...that thing needs to do \nsome crossfit (I still believe the Hellcat is stunning none the less).\n\nThe GT: You are correct on all you points. If I had the money to buy a 2016 \nGT, I'd use it to buy a 2006 GT. I'm like you, a GT should have two \nimportant things: a fun pedal and a V8. I would have liked a reincarnation \nof the GT40 again but oh well, right? I'm with you about it beating \nFerraris except for their hypercar...I mean that's a tall order to \naccomplish and I'm not sure Ford would be able to do it if they tried....I \nstill think they should at least try lol.\n\nThe RS: nothing can be said about this car. I'm not worried about it. I've \nexperienced an ST first hand and I was blown away with how good it is. The \nRS is just this on steroids so I'm not worried about it (how cool would it \nhave been to have another Cosworth though?).\n\nRaptor: I was disappointed to hear it would have a V6. I mean I get they're \ntrying to push their whole ecoboost thing but there are some cars that \ndon't need it (GT and Raptor). It looks stunning though. \n\nTaurus: Absolutely. There's no way it can compete against the Charger \nHellcat or the SS as it stands right now. The SHO used to strike fear in \nthe hearts of other sedan drivers, now no one even knows it exists. \n\nMy thoughts on it all? Ford is rolling out fantastic cars but seems to be \ninfluenced more and more by Europe. I would like to see them build purely \nAmerican inspired cars (with properly mean V8's) and send them across the \npond to put the pompous Europeans to shame. That's what Shelby did in the \n60's and that should be their goal now.",

And no one can deny the \nCamaro has gotten fat (unless it's sitting next to a Dodge.)  GT350 is nice \ntoo! I don't like the Mustang Shelby GT though. If your honest it seems to \nbe a 5.0 Mustang GT with bolt on parts and a grille that looks like a \npicket fence.  The GT350 is in the same price range and stunning on a whole \ndifferent level.\n\nFord GT:\nHere is the thing though.  It really isn't a Ford GT anymore.  If they \ncalled it the Ford Probe (or anything else really) I would be singing it's \npraises for being a reasonably priced super car.  The problems:\n- Ford GT's have V8's\n- Ford GT's are stick shifts (not paddle shifts REAL STICK SHIFTS like a \nCarol Shelby would have done)\n- The GT should beat every Ferrari (This one will not be a contender for \ntop level exotics like the LaFerrari)\n-And lastly (admittedly this one is kind of opinion) it looks way too \nforeign to be a FORD GT!  It borrowed bits and pieces of design from both \nFerrari and McLauren.  The last one had a much longer time gap and \nmaintained a body shape that looked very true to it's heritage.\nOverall? Good car, not a GT!\n\nFocus RS:\nThis will be glorious! As Top Gear stated, it's the return of the Escort \nCosworth.  AWD with over 300hp is going to put the STi to shame!\n\nRaptor:\n6 cylinder? In a truck? Maybe I am old fashioned but nothing will ever \nSOUND as good as a Ford V8.\n\nFiesta ST:\nAmazing performance car that outruns all of the other hatchbacks in it's \nclass.\n\nTaurus:\nNeeds a RWD V8 to keep up with the Chevy SS.\n\nAll of the other get normal thumbs up, sorry for the wall of text.",

            "text": "+Jimmy Hostetler Yeah I was referring to the 2015 Z/28...I really don't \nwant to think about the next installation of the Camaro. I can honestly say \nthat I think the Camaro has gotten uglier and uglier. I think the first ZL1 \nwas stunning (prettiest hood I've seen in a while) but it seems like they \nkeep dropping heavier objects on it to get that squished look (and \nhalogens? really? If they wanted to save weight they could've gone with \nLEDs). I still think the GT350R will be a solid contender, even for the \n2016 platform. So while the Camaro still might be better around the track, \nFord is supposed to (or its rumored) drop a new GT500 which will continue \nits streak of being the fastest and most powerful (it should be more than \nthe Hellcat). I'll still take a Shelby over a Camaro any day (partly \nbecause I simply think they look better and partly because I'm still a huge \nfan of Mr. Shelby and everything he did). One problem I have with the 2016 \nCamaro is the fact that they're using an already in-use platform. Granted, \nthe CTS-V has got to be one of the best american sports cars on the market \nand its really solid, but it would have been nice to see Chevy build a \nbrand new platform like Ford did. Though that's just my opinion so there's \nthat.\n\nNow the GT....yeah I wasn't too happy at first but I think I know why they \ndid what they did. The 2005 GT was meant to pay homage to the GT40. It was \nsupposed to look like it, drive like it, and simply be a modern \nreincarnation of the GT40. This new GT is supposed to be a whole different \nbeast. Its meant to look ahead and instead of using brute force (like the \n'05 GT) to achieve amazing feats its supposed to use technology. I can't \nsay I'm all that happy about it, but the looks have grown on me (those \nwastegates mmmm....) and I'm hoping it has the performance capabilities to \nback it up. All in all, it's a good time to be a Ford fan: Focus ST, Focus \nRS, Fiesta ST, GT350/R, Ford GT, Raptor.....hopefully another fast \nTaurus....soon....?",

The 2016 Camaro is \nrumored to be based on the CTS-V platform and weigh 400 pounds less. \n Mustang had the strait line advantage due to it reduced weight (and lost \nthat advantage in 2015, both being almost identical 0-60 and quarter mile \ntimes) and now the Camaro may be lighter for the first time since it picked \nproduction back up in 2010!  I can honestly say that for the first time \nsince this start up in 2010, I prefer the Camaro to the Mustang.  I still \nlove both, but the Camaro 1LE package got so gorgeous and those taillights \nremind me of the retro Chevy style.  Then mustang gets heavier and hides it \nall behind the independent rear suspension.  Once again, it's a wonderful \ncar, but Camaro achieved have taken the upper hand FOR NOW.  My biggest \nproblem with Ford is the 2016 GT, the glorious 2003 GT is shaking ti's head \nin shame. But that is a whole different story.",

And later this year Ford will have the upper hand when the GT350 and \nGT350R are released. The new Shelby is putting down around 550hp from a \nnaturally aspirated, flat-plane crank engine. It's also been built for the \ntrack unlike the old GT500. So you can fully expect it to spank any Camaro \non the track.
