I mean no badge on the referee \nand the countless procedural errors I can deal with, but him coming back on \nlike that could never happen. A player taken off the pitch can only return \nif beckoned back by the referee after being checked over by the senior \nassistant referee or 4th official, and only at the next opportunity for a \nsubstitution. Then he took a free kick before the referee whistled for it, \nand touched it again afterwards which is also not allowed. That's now three \nreasons this goal never should have occurred. I mean I can take a lot of \nrules errors but this is terrible. I love K&P but they need to stay out of \nsports.\ufeff",
