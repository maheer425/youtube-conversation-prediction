This video confuses once an again wave functions with actual \nquantum objects. Wave functions are a mathematical tool used to describe \nquantum objects. The squared modulus of wave functions gives us the \nprobability of finding an object in a given state/place/speed \u2014that's the \nCopenhagen interpretation\u2014; but the functions are not the actual objects. \nSo, yes, those functions can overlap and take exotic shapes, meaning that \nan quantum object, f.ex. an electron, can have a certain probability of \nbeing here and also a probability of being there \u2014of passing by one slit or \nthe other\u2014. That's as much as we can know, probabilities; but the actual \nelectron is only at one place at a time!!! We just don't know which one, \nunless we measure it. And we can do that, no problem; no experiment \nmeasures electrons passing by the two slits at the same time.\n\nThe interference pattern in the screen shows up, not because the electron \ninterferes with itself \u2014like the video tries to fool us into believing\u2014, \nbut because each electron can take any of the probable paths. So, after \nthrowing many electrons, each choosing it's own path, their landing spots \nin the screen displays the probability distribution dictated by the \ncharacteristics of the system \u2014slits+electrons\u2014. Just alike the added \nresults of throwing for example three dice a bunch of times will distribute \nthemselves according to the more and less likely combinations. So 10s and \n11s will show up way more often than 3s and 18s. Which value takes set of \ndice before you throw them? None? All? The question doesn't make much \nsense, right?. Before throwing it, the dice just have a probability of \ntaking all values. We still don't know which one it will take; but the dice \nare still very solid and real and not fuzzy or confused. Only we are \nconfused by our silly question... Same goes for electrons and any other \nquantum objects, until we thrown them, until make a measurement, we can \nonly know there probabilities of being here or there, passing by this or \nthat slit. Now, in practical terms, when we calculate stuff, we can only \ncalculate and reach conclusion based on what we know, and we can know just \nprobabilities and only give probabilistic conclusions. So, people often \ntend to confuse those probabilities with the actual objects and come up \nwith preposterous interpretations such as the one in this video.\n\nSo no mystery here. Just the statistical effects showing as consequence of \nthe knowledge limit imposed by the Uncertainty Principle. And, btw, there \nstill will be diffraction after closing one of the slits! But that's \nanother story...\ufeff",

Al final de esa hora, la cuesti\u00f3n es: \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el estado del gato?\n\nEl sentido com\u00fan sugiere que el gato estar\u00e1 vivo o muerto. Pero Schr\u00f6dinger \nse\u00f1al\u00f3 que seg\u00fan la f\u00edsica cu\u00e1ntica justo antes de abrir la caja el gato \nest\u00e1 al mismo tiempo vivo y muerto. Solo al abrir la caja veremos un estado \nbien definido.\n\nHasta el \u00faltimo momento el gato es una especie de probabilidad difusa, \nmedio una cosa, medio la otra. Puede parecer absurdo, pero seg\u00fan la f\u00edsica \ncu\u00e1ntica es as\u00ed. A Schr\u00f6dinger todo esto le pareci\u00f3 tan filos\u00f3ficamente \ninquietante que abandono la teor\u00eda que hab\u00eda ayudado a crear para dedicarse \na la biolog\u00eda.\u00bb\n\nLos \u00e1tomos no son como los \u00absistemas solares\u00bb que se suelen dibujar, en los \nque los electrones dan vueltas alrededor del n\u00facleo; tal y como se explica \nen el v\u00eddeo las propiedades de las part\u00edculas subat\u00f3micas son \nprobabil\u00edsticas: al ser algo bastante contrario a nuestra intuici\u00f3n y \nexperiencia cotidiana no podemos apreciarlo en toda su sutileza \u2013 algo que \ns\u00ed hace este experimento. Para mayor complicaci\u00f3n, el hecho de que esos \nefectos \u2013como puede ser peculiar comportamiento dual a modo de ondas y \npart\u00edculas, o la relaci\u00f3n de indeterminaci\u00f3n de Heisenberg\u2013 sean de una \nmagnitud tan lejana a nuestra \u00abescala humana\u00bb no hace sino complicar las \ncosas.\n\nPero pese a la dificultad de entender el mundo cu\u00e1ntico los seres humanos \nnos las hemos ingeniado para aprovechar sus propiedades y combinar \u00e1tomos y \nmol\u00e9culas en materiales semiconductores, con los que se construyen \nordenadores y dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos que utilizamos a diario. Como bien \ndice el v\u00eddeo, \u00abes un ir\u00f3nico e interesante giro: que lo que se suele decir \nen broma de Internet, \u2018que fue construida para ver v\u00eddeos de gatos\u2019, se \ndeba en parte a un famoso gato del que reneg\u00f3 hasta su creador\u00bb.\ufeff",

The great thing about \nths thought experiment is that we got for the first time quantum mechanics' \nproperties in our macroworld. First of all in order to understand the \nexperiment you need to be familiar with the term 'superposition'.\n\nSuperposition is a state of a particle (or system) that includes all the \npossible 'minor states'. For example, let's say a particle is in \nsuperposition of being at point A and point B. If we observe the system, we \nare going to find the particle at point A or point B. It can't be both. But \nbefore the observation the particle was not only at A, not only at B, not \nboth A and B at the same time, because it's just a particle, and of course \nnot at neither of them, because then it wouldn't exist. We say it's in \nsuperposition of being at A and B, and we can't quite gasp what is like \nbeing in that sate, but a good approach is being at both places the same \ntime. That's why you hear that in every pop-science video.\n\nNow, back to Schrodinger's cat. The original thought experiment wasn't that \nsimple. It included a trap inside the box which was triggered when the \nradioactive isotope stops emitting radiation. This is a quantum phenomenon, \nand obeys to the rules of quantum mechanics. So, at any given time the \nisotope is in superposition of emitting radiation and not to, as a result \nthe trap is in superposition of being triggered and not to, and finally the \ncat is in superposition of being alive and being dead.\n\nThat doesn't mean that every system which we don't know its outcome, exists \nat all possible outcome at the same time before we do the observation. The \nonly reason we say that the cat is both dead and alive is because it all \nstarted from a quantum phenomenon. This 'superposition state' exists only \nin the quantum world and that is what makes the difference between our \nevery-day-world and the microworld (the world of tiny particles)\n\nHope I helped",
