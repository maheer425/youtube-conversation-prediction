I think that the \n90s-2000s movies happened partly as a reaction against the painful \nearnestness of some of the 80s movies, which is why they are so easily \nparodied.  Also there was perhaps a cultural shift, whereby people didn't \nreally feel the social issues covered by the 80s films needed to be trotted \nout again. \n\nSince I was in my teens-early 20s in the latter era, however, those movies \nwin out on pure nostalgia, which is a hard thing to beat, and maybe because \nI was already such an introspective person that the gross-out comedies were \nlike a relief.",
