It wasn't \"just\" in \nthat a Stark didn't (directly or knowingly) kill him, but his humiliating \ndeath was still appropriate considering how he had been casually \nhumiliating tons of people minutes before (Ser Dontos, the performing \ndwarves, Tyrion). It was as if fate was biding its time to kill him, calmly \nkeeping a track of Joffrey's bad karma, but went \"fuck it\" after Joffrey \nwent Maximum Overdouche at the wedding.\ufeff",

Bran (and Rickon) would have \ninherited Winterfell and could have then been married off to the Frey's. \nThis would have made an alliance that would have knocked Tywin Lannister \nout of the game. Arya would have reached her family much sooner and could \nhave been married to Theon Greyjoy, bringing the Ironborn in their side. \nArya is the only women who could have kept the Ironborn in line anyway. \nRenly would have taken King's landing but lost too many men to survive \nagainst the alliance.\n\n The only real flaw here is Sansa would have died at Cercei's hand rather \nthan be freed...\ufeff",

I'm not saying you have to be like Tolkienand \nhave most of the good guys live but sometimes bad people get wits coming to \nthem and that's one of the key things that are missing in this series. Of \ncourse,most people think that bad people when most of the time and most \npeople like their fantasy to be somewhat realistic but honestly there's \nonly so much realism I like in my books. I think that if you have a good \ncharactergood and bad things should happen to that character just as if you \nhave a bad character. Also, The series is highly praised for having its \n\"well rounded characters.\" The way I see it,almost every fantasy author has \none or two stereotypical characters.\nThe drunk king,\nThe girly girl,\nThe tomboy,\nThe overprotective mother,\nThe exiled princess, \nThe evil prints.\nThese are all examples of stereotypes found in a song of ice and fire.",
