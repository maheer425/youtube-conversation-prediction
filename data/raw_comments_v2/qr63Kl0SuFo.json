If the power-lines were DC, you'd need a \npower-station every so many blocks.\nJust prior to getting to it's destination (for example, your house), the AC \nis converted to DC, using a \"Rectifier\" and stepped down to 120 volts (240 \nvolts in Europe), which is what is running through the wires in our walls \nand also what we receive from our sockets, to power our electrical \nappliances.\nThanks!\ufeff",

            "text": "+owen west\n I mentioned in another post that wireless charging for cars right now is \nsimply done by parking over a specialized mat or pad in one's garage and \nthey've achieved efficiencies very close to traditional wired connection \n(just above 90%) and experimental systems using a cable embedding in the \nroad to wireless run electric buses while driving are underway. Yes, the \ncost of the vehicles are higher when compared to traditional gas powered \nones, but that will really only be true until the technology becomes more \ncommon place, plus most governments offer subsidies or tax write-offs on \nhybrid and electric cars to offset some of the difference (the price \ndifference.for hybrids has decreased since their introduction). Plus with \nTesla Motors effectively putting the technology for the electric car into \nthe public domain, within a few years we should be seeing all sorts of new \ntechnology on the market that'll only serve to drive down prices. Besides, \nwith fuel prices being what they are these days, the cost of the \nelectricity needed is likely less than that of gasoline (though I don't \nfeel like searching for figures at the moment). Charging stations already \nexisting in parking lots and parking decks that electric car owners can \nplug their cars into while they're parked (my 'local' mall has two such \nspaces and I live in the middle of nowhere, hence the 'local', so I imagine \nthey are more prevalent in more populous areas). They will only become more \nprevalent as electric cars become more prevalent and while not wireless \nright now, the technology exists and is efficient enough that there's no \nreason to assume we won't be seeing a shift in that direction in the next \ndecade (I mean, hell, it's not even theoretical- wireless charging stations \nare already out there. That's what +Hirsh Kabaria and I were referring to.)\n\nI'm not intentionally trying to attack your every post or anything. I just \nthink this has so many exciting ramifications and the technology exists to \nmake this happen (and it is happening on a small scale). Yes, some of the \nthings I've mentioned aren't all that practical yet, but they easily could \nbe on the market within a decade. The only thing that'll keep that from \nhappening is if this current iteration of the technology doesn't see more \nwidespread adoption, which won't happen if everyone just assumes it's not \npractical and is prohibitively expensive (while shelling out 300-500USD for \na new iphone every two years... sorry, that's another rant all together).",

Yes, you \nwould still have to pay your own electric bill but it takes almost no \nelectricity to maintain the field so you're kinda only paying when you're \nrunning a device and you do that anyway. You could easily power an iphone \nwirelessly, the problem is we suck at storing energy and batteries are not \nonly super inefficient but they are thrown out by the billions each year \njust because they're easier than getting a cord and plugging something in. \nWith manufacturing, shipping, packaging, distribution, etc. along with \ntheir inefficiency 1kw/hr from an iphone battery costs roughly $24. If you \nhad it plugged into the wall 1 kw/hr would cost about $0.19. Sure it'll \ntake awhile (honestly 10-15 yrs before houses start being built with \nmagnetic induction coils in the floors, walls, and ceilings) but once your \nhouse and your office and the coffee place all have them installed (think \nwifi) then it will be like your devices are always plugged directly into \nthe wall.
