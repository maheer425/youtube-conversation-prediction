They both follow a false religion \nand kill each other over it. I do enjoy the Daily Show because it is funny \nand he makes great points using peoples own words against them. you can't \nargue with that.  I do believe the whole Iraq was was wrong and a huge \nmistake voted on by Congress of both parties and asked for by a President \nthat just wanted revenge on Hussein.
