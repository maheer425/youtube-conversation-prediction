I find \nno problem with doing what you want to what you own and this guy has done a \nfantastic job of making his car his own. I was reading the reply's and a \nlot of them say the sound of the motor I have to say the AMC motors sound \njust as good. And with the right build will spin 7000 to nearly 8000 and \nsound so good doing it not to take away from how this sounds. I like the \nsound of this LS as well. So what I was getting to is to all the guys out \nthere building a car do it your way its your car. Don't let somebody talk \nyou into keeping a motor you don't want or buying a motor you don't think \nyou need... It's your car build it to your specifications let the haters \ntake the heel-toe express just get out there and build a car that's all \nthat matters get your car on this show and be proud....       \ufeff",
