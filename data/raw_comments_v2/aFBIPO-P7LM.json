So many inside jokes and stuff only he and I knew \nand shared over 44 years evaporated into thin air without warning. As his \nyounger brother, I am today 44 we were just 2.5 years apart. I I feel what \nJeff said about the Kennedy brother to be true. In many ways I not only am \nprepared to die sooner than later, and I have come to expect it to happen \nin a similar way. It somehow feels \"right\" that I should go out like he \ndid... perhaps similar to the way one soldier might run out into the \nbattlefield prepared to die after watching his best mates fall in front of \nhim. I realize now without him I would have been a completely different \nperson, and that when we were alive all we saw were our differences, we \nseemed like polar opposites, yet now that he's gone i realize there is \nnobody on earth who is anything like me,  that even comes close to sharing \ntraits. Like a mirror image he was the opposite, but no different. Half of \nme went out that day with him for sure and growing older alone has become \nan extremely dark tunnel ahead I no longer look forward to and try \ndesperately not to envision. I planned for many things and was prepared to \nhandle pretty much all the punches life has to offer, but losing my brother \nStew at 44 was beyond imaginable. It just never seemed possible. I had \nnever considered it even as a remote possibility. To think my older big bro \nwas younger than myself today at his oldest defies natural logic. This \ntruly destroyed my family in so many ways, i can only thank god I had spent \n10 month on my brother's couch a few years before he died so we had a \nchance for a few more fights and many more laughs before it was all over. \nRIP big bro.;\ufeff",
