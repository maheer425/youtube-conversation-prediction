It \nmade my stomach hurt and I had a panic attack because I was not prepared! \n(He was my new coworker so I had to hide it) We've been together 7 years \nnow. But the heart sycronized thing? I feel like that's not true for us \nanyway, my heart is always going full speed and my husband's is always slow \nand chill even when we make eye contact. Maybe it's that way for other \npeople though. \ufeff",

            "text": "I never believed in love at first sight... but it actually happend to me. I \nspent some time reading most of the comments and I do agree with both the \nscientist and the spirituals. I know love is a mix of substances in our \nbrain and in our body, and that it can mean a lot of thigs. Acording to \npsichology, true love is \"all of them\" : lust, appreciation, devotion, \nrespect and the list cand go on and on. But if it was only that, it could \neasily be labeled as a simple mix of feelings like friendship. In my \nopinion, love is something more than that, and I don't refer to love \nstrictly in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. A good example of TRUE \nLOVE at first sight, when you know absolutely nothing about the person you \nsee, is when you are born. Your parents love you at first sight, they love \nyou even before your birht, before seeing you for the first time. So do \nyou. \nSo why would the boyfriend-girlfriend love be diffrent? We imagine a more \nor less definite idea of our ideal, of the person we want to be with the \nrest of our lives, so basicly we start to love them even before meeting \nthem. \nI am in a relationship for 2 1/2 years and I can say it was love at first \nsight. We were in a crowd and somehow we both noticed each other, we were \nliteraly staring in each others eyes like retards. The next thing that came \nto my mind was \"He must be the father of my children\". we didn't talk for 3 \nmonths because we didn't know each other but then we met again and that is \nwhen our relationship started. I knew I love him when I saw him and so did \nhe. If that is not love at first sight, I don't know what it is.\ufeff",
