            "text": "Indians invented the place value system, decimal numbers, square roots, \ncube roots, the sine tables, negative numbers and fractions. One must refer \n \"The History of Indian Science and Mathematics\" by Sen and Bhattacharya.\nHere is a stroke of mathematical wonder. A sloka in the Vedas going back \nmany millennia gives the value of PI correct to 32 decimal places:\n\n\u0917\u094b\u092a\u0940\u092d\u093e\u0917\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0927\u0941\u0935\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0936\u094b\u0926\u0927\u093f \u0938\u0902\u0927\u093f\u0917\u0903 |\n\u0916\u0932\u091c\u0940\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0916\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0935 \u0917\u0932\u0939\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0938\u0902\u0927\u0930\u0903 ||\n\ngopeebhaagya maDhuvraathaH shruMgashodhaDhi saMDhigaH\nkhalajeevithakhaathaava galahaalaa rasaMDharaH\n\nga-3, pa-1, bha-4, ya-1, ma-5, Dhu-9, ra-2, tha-6, shru-5, ga-3, sho-5, \ndha-8, Dhi-9, sa-7, Dha-9, ga-3, kha-2, la-3, jee-8, vi-4, tha-6, kha-2, \ntha-6, va-4, ga-3, la-3, ha-8, la-3, ra-2, sa-7, Dha-9, ra-2\n\nWe thus get the value of PI as 3.141 5926 5358 9793 2384 6264 3383 2792.\n\nThe above coding is derived from the following numeric coding of the \nSanskrit alphabets (knows as KaTaPaYadhi code):\n\n\u0915 \u0916 \u0917 \u0918 \u0919 = = 1   2  3  4  5\n\u091a \u091b \u091c \u091d \u091e = = 6  7  8  9  x\n\u091f \u0920 \u0921 \u0922 \u0923 = = 1  2  3  4  5\n\u0924 \u0925 \u0926 \u0927 \u0928 = = 6  7  8  9  x\n\u092a \u092b \u092c \u092d \u092e = = 1  2  3  4  5\n\u092f \u0930 \u0932 \u0935 = = 1  2  3  4\n\u0936 \u0937 \u0938 \u0939 = = 5  6 7 8\n\u0915\u094d\u0937 = = 0\n\nThe x indicates that the corresponding alphabets \u091e and \u0928 have no value and \nare to be ignored in the coding. And, if a combined letter such as kra \n(\u0915\u094d\u0930) or spoo (\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0942) appears, we must consider that consonant carrying the \nvowel as the code and ignore the first consonant. Thus kra (\u0915\u094d\u0930) indicates \n\u0930 = 2. And, spoo (\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0942) indicates \u092a = 1.\n\nThe above sloka has actually 3 meanings\n1. Salutations to Lord Shiva\n2. Salutations to Lord Krishna\n3. The value of PI upto 32 decimals.\n\nOne more sloka gives the infinite series for calculation of the value of PI \ncorrect to any number of digits:\n\n\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a\u0939\u0943\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0938\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0936\u0930\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0937\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0960\u0923\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0943\u0925\u0915\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965\n\nvyAse vaariDhinihathe rUpahtRthevyasasAgarAbhihathe\nthrisharAdhiviShamasMkhyAbhakthM TRNM svM ptRThakkramAth kuryaath\n\nMeaning :\n\nWhen the circumference/perimeter of the circle is given in terms of a \nseries (containing d=diameter) then the diameter term is divided by the odd \nnumbers (like 1, 2, 3...) and alternately added/subtracted from the rest \n(of the summation of series).\n\nThus Circumference = 4d/1 - 4d/3 + 4d/5 \u2013 4d/7 and so on.\n\nAlternately, PI = Circumference / Diameter = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - \n4/11 + 4/13 - 4/15 and so on until infinity!\n\nBut folks, the above series gives a stable value for the first two decimal \nplaces (3.14) only after the 1255th term! For something more efficient and \nfast, you must refer Srinivasa Ramanujan, the genius known as \"The Man Who \nKnew Infinity\".\n\nI love Mathematics. So, please excuse if you find the above to be in excess \n:-) !\ufeff",

Its seriously the biggest reason he \ngets elected, his personal charm, charisma and handsomeness. Folks know \nhe's smart and he's a looker, and that he's clean; they don't really know \nmuch else. There's something to be said about India's traditional respect \nfor intellectuals; it allows people like Tharoor to get elected even if \nthey don't have the actual on-ground connections or grit.  \n\nIts quite incredible how Game of Thrones lines up so well with Indian \npolitics. I have used it multiple times to explain Indian politics to \nWestern friends. Both are about the politics around a historical seat of \npower in an ancient mythical land, about a bunch of feudal dynasties, their \ncourtiers and religious fundamentalists vying for power while a great \nwinter (rise of China) across a giant wall in the North is approaching and \neveryone is ignoring.\n\nAnd yeah, I read every one of Ishaan's articles as well. I'm so relieved to \nhear I'm not the only Shashi fanatic out there. My sister thinks I'm weird \nwhen I wax poetic about Tharoor :D Ofcourse, she also thinks he is ugly so \nI would never trust her opinion hahaha",

I wouldn't want him \nto be anything other than what he is (except maybe External Affairs \nMinister). Honestly, I feel a similar deep sense of connection with the \nman.

At first Indian mathematicians \nused a dot beneath to represent zero but later it was developed into a \ncircle in India itself.\nThe proof that not only zero but the number system was also invented in \nIndia is present in the chathurbhuja temple where it gives the numbers 50 \nand 270 in numbers as we use today. It is accepted as an undisputable proof \nof the first use of zero n number system in the world as we have today.\nAll the nine non zero digits were invented in India before giving a form to \nzero n this was used in India. This passed on to the Arabs n they call it \nthe rakam all hind or the Indian numeral system.\nThus the number system as we have today was developed in India n we also \nhave proof for it in the chathurbhuja temple plate which gives the numbers \nin digits as we use today.\nDo also remember that all ancient Indian Sanskrit books were translated \ninto Arabia n not the other way round.",
