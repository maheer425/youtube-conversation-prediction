You could add anything to 0.24 to your time and that might be \nwhat you would get electronically.\n20m 3.00 is basic for pro's. 2.95 is a average. 2.82 is fast. 2.6-2.7 is \nelite\n40m, get under 5.00 and you have speed. Henry's time was 4.85 while vela \nand toure got under 4.95. Get 4.8 and your doing a 4.4 40 yard dash.\nAlso do electronic timing. If you guys were as quick as you think.
