You being so blind \nand offensive, you fail to see i called you a bright person. The world is \nnot against gays, you not that important. Gay only means you like the same \nsex by choice, KEYWORD. When people say i didn't have a choice being gay, i \nwas born feminine, i think it's a shameful excuse to blanket the choice. \nSomewhere down the line you made a choice the same sex is more appealing ",

You do not like my view \nand opinion on homosexuality, which is ok. To call me ignorant is really a \nfar fetch thing. Understand this young man, i am not going to fully \nunderstand the gay pride thing, simply because i am not gay. Telling \nsomeone to do something and having a opinion is two different things. Maybe \nyou need to continue to grow and learn that every damn thing you hear you \nare not going to like. I took a trip to new dehi, and i seen hate and \npeople telling people what to do with their lives because the color of \ntheir skin. These people that are being treated unfair is called Dalits i \nbelieve. I hate when you gays compare that straight people treating you \nunfair which is not the case. You need to grow some tough skin because \npeople going to say racist shit. And everything is a choice. People fight \ncancer and h.i.v, so if someone believe they are born gay, i find that \nbullshit, thats my OPINION. It does not mean i am a dumbass. I know gay \npeople who turn straight again. ",
