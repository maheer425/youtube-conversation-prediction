The standard for terrestrial planets is to be loaded \nwith CO2 from volcanic outgassing (the amount of atmosphere is based on the \ngeologic capacity to do volcanic activity, thus bigger is better). Venus \nhas the thick atmosphere because of the lack of oceans and Earth would \nprobably be the same way if our oceans boiled away. Currently our oceans \nabsorb CO2 and bind it in rocks, where it must be dragged to a subduction \nzone to be released again. Mars was too small to maintain a magnetosphere \nand the solar wind stripped it's atmosphere down to the point where the air \npressure does not allow liquid water to exist except in the lowest of \nelevations. While Venus simply spins too slow to make a magnetosphere but \nit has so much atmosphere that any losses would have been insignificant. \n\nThe greenhouse science is true, but it isn't necessarily an end of world \nscenario and life goes on, as the world used to be warm enough for hickory \nforests on greenland, palms in Alaska, deciduous forests in Antarctica (and \nthis is only in the several million years before the ice age climate \nstarted, the continent positions weren't all that far from where they are \ntoday).
