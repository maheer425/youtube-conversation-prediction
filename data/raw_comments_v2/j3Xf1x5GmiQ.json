(lol). \n But they Changed the name to \"Mountain Creek\"  and they took out the \nentire Go-Kart area, and the Alpine slide. :(    However, many rides still \nremain, the cliff jump (which scared me the most as a kid, but the alpine \nslide was fine for me, lol go figure!) was still there too.  Just recently \ni heard the changed the name back to action park and went back to a 80s \nretro theme. (When i went it was in the 90s right before it closed, \nlitrally, it must have been the year with no insurance.) \nI heard rumors about people dying and that is why the name changed but i \ndidnt know.   Now Mountain Creek during the winter is a Ski Resort,  I can \nsee many people dying and getting hurt on that side of the mountain. i did \nhave to sign a waiver before they let us on the ski lift. lol\nHey if u guys come to Jersey, let me know i will come up to vernon and we \ncan jump off the cliff. hopefully they put the super fast race car go-karts \nback  too!!\ufeff",
