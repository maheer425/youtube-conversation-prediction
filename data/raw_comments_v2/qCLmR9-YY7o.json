In oogenesis, Meiosis I is \ncompleted on the day of ovulation and produces two daughter cells\u2014a large \none called the secondary oocyte and a much smaller one called the first \npolar body. The polar body ultimately disintegrates. It is merely a means \nof discarding the extra haploid set of chromosomes. The secondary oocyte \nproceeds as far as metaphase II, then stops. If it is not fertilized, it \ndies and never finishes meiosis. If fertilized, it completes meiosis II and \ncasts off a second polar body, which disposes of one chromatid from each \nchromosome. The chromosomes of the large remaining egg then unite with \nthose of the sperm. Therefore, it should have been 2 polar body and 1 egg. \n:P\ufeff",
