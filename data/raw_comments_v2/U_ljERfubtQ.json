You also don't need most of these things in the \nvideo. Mostly blankets, food stamps & gas. ((DON'T TRICK OFF)) To get gas I \nusually have something pawned to get cash or ask around, it doesn't hurt to \nask. I get online every day to fill out applications from my tablet or \nphone, I go to a friend place to shower and that's that. It's not fun or \neasy but for me I'd rather do this than having to put up with my mom, it's \nsad but true. For anyone who is going through the same I wish you the best \nof luck! \ufeff",

What did i accomplish from this? in 10 month i bought my \nfavorite car back then a 2007 infiniti m35 salvage from the auction \n(copart) for 8000$ plus 1500$ to fix it and 8 month later i had 25K in my \nbank account and my favorite car!!!
