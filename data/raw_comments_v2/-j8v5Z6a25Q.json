I don't \nmind if you didn't like Harry Potter, and could probably find things to \nagree with you on if you could give examples of why the book/movie was bad? \nWas it cuz of character development, plot holes, actors/directors, literary \ndevices, sentence structures, etc..... Yeah you have an opinion but not \neveryones opinion's worth the same, especially the perspective of the \nopinion. If its because you don't like the genre like guys who don't like \nchick flicks, then you have no opinion on the mater, not a negative one. \nI'd rather listen to someone who read/watched it and say they didn't like \nit then listen to someone who never read/watched it say why they didn't \nlike. That would be a worthless 1 minute conversation. Comparing smacking \nyour dick with a hammer to watching/reading a story is just a futile \noutfield analogy of not directly confronting the problem before you. ",

I have seen roughly 60 to 90 seconds \nof \"Twilight\" and that's all I needed to know. In fact that was 30 to 60 \nseconds more than I needed to see to know. Then there are just some things \nthat do not interest me from the premise. I have been known to take \nsuggestions and be pleasantly surprised.The book \"Girl\" by Blake Nelson for \ninstance. I was only going to read it enough to say I did, and hopefully \nshut my girlfriend up, but I found that I could not put the book down. I've \nread it several times since then and it's one of my favorites. I found out \nabout \"The Toy Collector\" by James Gunn after doing a Google search about \nRom the Spaceknight and found out that Rom was mentioned in the book. I \nknew nothing about the story when I started reading it and it became my all \ntime favorite book. On the other hand I knew the musical \"Chicago\" was \ngonna suck from the television ads, and I wasn't wrong. Same goes for \n\"Battlefield Earth\", the \"Total Recall\" remake, \"Pink Cadillac\", The 1998 \n\"Godzilla\", Tim Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\", and \"Batman and Robin\". All \nconfirmed to me that they sucked after watching them.",

It still doesn't make sense why a society that uses \nmagic for the most mundane of tasks wouldn't just use magic to move a tree \n(even the beginning of The Sorcerer's Stone shows Hagrid using magic) but \nultimately it's just a small nitpick.",

I'm a huge fan of these guys videos because i think \ntheir funny and original, not necessarily because I agree with all the \npoints they raise.  I don't think i'm unreasonable, I just have a different \nopinion. \n\nSo take the Christmas tree scene.  Even at its grandest its a tiny footnote \non the film, intended to do 3 things, 1) show a significant amount of time \nhas passed,  2) show specifically its Christmas time, and 3) get a little \nmore face time for the supporting facualty/staff (so they have more of a \npresence in the film, and its not just Harry, Ron, and Hermione off on \ntheir own somewhere).  Oh and i suppose as a possible side item, its a nod \nto the fans because this scene happened in the book.  So really 4 points to \ncover.  For what it does, its fairly effective.\n\nThe fact that magic wasn't used in transportation of the tree might be a \nsin. but it would probably be more of a sin if they spent time explaining \nwhy Hagrid was dragging the tree instead of using magic.  That's just poor \ntime budgeting in a movie.  I mean its not like they were saying, \"Hey \nharry, there's this powerful dark wizard after you.  Why? F*ck you thats \nwhy.\" then the art of tree chopping with Hagrid, then roll credits. \n\nSo lets talk substitutes.  The only two teachers in Hogwarts who do really \nchristmassy things are Hagrid and Flitwick, and both are doing christmassy \nthings in the brief seconds of the Christmas montage.  Sure you can show \nSnape or Mcgonagall doing Christmas stuff, but it'll just look weird.",
