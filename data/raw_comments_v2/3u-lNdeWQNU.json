I had to kiss him and I have to admit that that's really \nfrustrating.\nPlus he did not talk very much and he always wanted me to tell him things \nbut after frikin' 3 hours talking, 5 days a week I just can't talk 3 hours \nagain. Just no. He was sweet and really protective and stuff but I replied \nwith telling him exactly what I wrote down here, only in other words.\nToday I found out that his grandpa died but he did not tell me. He died one \nday before my birthday and I was really shocked because I've asked him \nabout his day and what's going on everytime I felt like asking it because \nof his behavior but he didn't tell me. His cousin told me that he was \nreally down and crying and stuff, treating the others in another way as \nusual and being a dick. I feel so sorry now because maybe he acted because \nof that and instead of that I told him what he did wrong. I just don't know \nhow to feel about it. I feel like an asshole even if my friends told me \nthat I'm not and even after his cousin told me I acted way nicer than he at \nthe and.\ufeff",
