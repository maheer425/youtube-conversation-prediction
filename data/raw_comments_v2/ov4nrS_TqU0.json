Did you fucking forget what the police are for? \nThey're there to protect citizens and maintain peace in a civilized \nsociety, and yet this man, not a threat to anyone and being taken in for a \nPETTY crime, maybe a crime worth 40 fucking dollars, is totally worthy of \nbeing killed by the police after voicing that he can't breathe? They \nalready have a bunch of guys pinning him down, why does the officer using \nthe chokehold have to insist to keep using it even when he says to stop, \nwhich is a request that the camera guy can hear and he's not even in his \nface. And yes, that IS a chokehold. It's not a headlock, and a headlock \nwill specifically not obstruct the airway of the person it's being used on. \nYou can clearly see in the video his arm is wrapped around Eric's neck, it \nwas not aimed to be anywhere else. Plus, the guy wraps his other arms \nunderneath the guys armpit. If you do that to a friend, you can see that \nthe hold underneath the arm is used in order to get a better grip and to \nalso make it easier to press the neck tighter. You wanna say it's cause \nhe's fat? What? Fat guys just start running and get out of breathe and then \nfucking die on the streets? Where do you live? The coroner said it was \nbecause of the force used on his throat. Fat guys don't just have some \nmagical rope in their neck that tightens when cops grab them. Plus he said \nhe couldn't breathe. Cops can hold him down while they call people to help \nhim. They send killers to hospitals when they're wounded because they need \nthem to stand trial, they send all kinda of criminals to the hospital \nbecause their job isn't to kill people. It's to detain. There was no reason \nfor his death. Not once did Eric swing at them, just backed away. They \ncould have easily detained him without his untimely death. They didn't even \ntry to help him. No one was in danger. No one. This is an injustice and I'm \nsick of people trying to protect a cop who committed a murder right on \ncamera. Police can be criminals, they can be corrupted.

Sure, you can \nblame his death on his poor health, and that such force on the side of the \npolice would not have killed an average healthy male, but that takes away \naccountability from the officers in question.\n\nThere are several questions that need to be asked concerning these \nofficers. Was the choke hold necessary? And if you don't classify it as a \nchoke hold (like many do) what would be the explanation for the \n\"compression of the neck\" in the coroner's report? \n\n\nWas Eric Garner such a threat that four officers were required to hold him \ndown? \n\n\nWas it necessary for an officer, when the hold was released, to place his \nhands on Garner's head and apply pressure?\n\n\nWhy did they not believe him when he gasped for air, saying he couldn't \nbreath? And yes, you can speak when you're being choked. It's pure \nstupidity (And obviously dangerous) to assume that just because someone can \nspeak, that their breathing isn't impaired enough to cause harm and/or \ndeath. \n\n\nDid Eric Garner's actions support the sudden escalation of force? Garner \nhad a criminal record, and judging from his conversation in the video, one \ncan assume that these cops stopped him on a weekly basis. Was Garner known \nto carry a weapon? Did he have combat training? \n\n\nIn the video, Eric Garner is heard conversing with police, claiming that he \nhasn't done anything wrong, and that there are witnesses that support \nGarner's position. That he is consistently harassed (as he claims) by these \nsame officers on a regular basis, and that he just wants to be left alone. \nWhen officers attempt to arrest him, he tries to pull away, and is almost \nimmediately placed in a choke hold. He is quickly thrown to the ground, \nface down, where additional officers apply their weight and successfully \nhandcuff him. Eric Garner was then rolled onto his side, and stayed in that \nposition while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive. \n\n\nMy opinion is, that while the officer did not commit murder or \nmanslaughter, (and thus, couldn't be indicted), they did in fact use \nexcessive force. It was an unnecessary and rapid escalation that resulted \nin the death of a civilian. It indicates a failure in judgement on part of \nthe officers, as they should be able to correctly identify and follow a \nproper course of action that minimize danger to the officer and the \nsuspect, which they, in my humble opinion, did not do.",

The dude's heart \nrate got too high and he had a heart attack, plain and simple.   He died an \nhour AFTER the altercation at the hospital, not on the street.  Also, there \nwas no fucking \"choke-hold.\"  Garner had no injuries to his neck according \nto the autopsy because the officer wasn't squeezing his neck;  he simply \nput his arms around Garner's neck so he could pull Garner back and make him \nlose balance so he would fall to the ground and could then be subdued.

Loss of \nconfidence can be characterized by,\n\n1)  Obamacare damaged many small businesses in the inner city.  Small \nbusinesses provided 70-80% of jobs for the inner city black community. \n Huge numbers disappeared.\n2)  Poor fiscal management by Democrats running the districts which contain \nmany of the black communities.  Detroit, Philly, St. Louis, Oakland, LA, \nFlint, NJ, ...those cities are mostly broke, ...bond holders are not \nallowing them to keep issuing debt without securing more collateral from \nthe municipalities.  Effectively killing government job expansion using \ndebt instruments which the tax base can never support.\n3)  Obama and Democrats promoted then signing the \"sequestration\" budget \ninto effect, which will last until 2021.  The President and Congress will \nnot be allowed to raise the spending without a super majority vote. \n4)  Obama ignoring the US immigration law then granting special immigration \nstatus without the consent of Congress.  His actions effectively allowed 5 \nmillion to cross our Southern Boarder.  These 5 million competing for min. \nwage jobs created generational economic damage upon the black youth \ncommunity.  Of the 500,000 black youths turning 18 yr each year, their will \nbe no jobs for 10 years because of Obama engaging in Hispanic vote buying \nby ignoring US immigration laws and allowing 5 million to cross our \nboarders.\n\nThis latest mid-term election should be a clear warning of impending \nchanges.  The Democratic Party lost 900 elected members, that's more than \nany previous President in history since the end of WW2.  The Democrats lost \nFed. House, Fed. Senate, State Legislatures, Governors, Mayors, Municipal \ngovernment elections totaling 900 in 6 years of Obama administration.  \n\nThe race card is the last bid of scorched earth policy in a desperate \nattempt to keep the PONZI scam, poor fiscal management, inability to fund \nor sustain pensions and entitlements.  Remember, NY Democratic Legislature \nhad ordered the police to engage in forceful tax collection on tobacco \nstamps.  Garner was murdered for $6 tobacco tax stamp.  Garner was arrest \nnine time for not paying tobacco taxes of $6 or $54 in taxes.  If that is \nnot a sign of desperate fiscal mess, ... a Liberal Progressive Democratic \nGovernment value $6 in taxes from tobacco stamps more than a human life!\ufeff",
