People are running their lives based on subconscious, \npre-programmed impulses that have been placed there subliminally by \nmainstream media, educational (indoctrination) systems, ad infinitum.\n\nWhen humanity finally becomes full conscious (neo-cortex rather than using \nthe R-complex portion of their brains) and snaps out of their hypnotic \ntrance, then they will be able to see the world, and the psychopaths that \nhave been controlling it and humanity, for what it really is.\n\nYes, a global awakening among the asleep masses of people, is inevitable. \nHow long it will take is another question. The real question is... will the \nglobal awakening of humanity be too late?\ufeff",
