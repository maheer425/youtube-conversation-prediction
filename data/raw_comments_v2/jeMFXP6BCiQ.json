So, we use gel now to help secure the \nbraids, so if it comes loose at all, the whole bun is still pretty well \nsecured with the gel.  But I'd like to know how you guys keep the bun close \nto the head. I tried securing down with extra hair pins, and somehow in all \nthe tumbling, she keeps finishing a meet with only 2-3 pins left in her \nhead, and I put in at least 15 to start... what is the best way to put the \npins in so they'll stay? Any ideas to help with that?  Mine is a Level 10, \nso she's twisting and pretty hard on her hair, so things tend to come \nloose. she's also got thick straight hair - so I'm open to advice. Please \nhelp if you can... thanks so much.\ufeff",
