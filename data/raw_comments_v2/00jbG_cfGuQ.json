            "text": "I have seen many comments saying that it is too late to learn. It is NOT \ntoo late to learn cellular respiration. COUNT your carbons. Draw WHERE it \noccurs in the cell and if it requires oxygen or not. Draw it out on the \ntest from top to bottom on a piece of paper 20 times if you have to! I hope \nthis helps even just one person:\n\nRemember that cellular respiration is C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + H2O\n\nGlycolysis:\nI like to think of glucose as 6 carbons- CCCCCC. I don't care about the \nrest of the molecule. Split it into two pyruvate molecules- CCC and CCC. It \ntook 2 ATP to invest into the splitting of glucose and you gain 4 ATP- so \nnet gain of 2 ATP. 2 NADH total made in glycolysis. \n\nIntermediate step:\nEach CCC splits into a CO2 and a Acetyl CoA (CC). Just remember that acetyl \nCoA (CC) has two carbons, which I like to draw right next to it. These two \ncarbons get converted into 2 CO2 each for a total of 4 CO2. If you look at \nthe chemical equation above, you already made your 4 CO2 molecules.This \nmeans you know you need to make two more CO2 molecules somewhere. That is \nwhat will help you remember.\n\nKrebs Cycle AKA the citric acid cycle:\nThe Acetyl CoA (CC) and Acetyl CoA (CC) from the other pyruvate molecule \nget converted. You have 4 carbons here, which means use them to make the \nCO2.\n6 NADH + 2 FADH2 are made here.\n\nElectron transport chain/ oxidative phosphorylation:\n\nTotal amount of NADH = 10 NADH\nTotal amount of FADH2 = 2\n\nEach NADH \"makes\" 3 ATP, each FADH2 \"makes\" 2 ATP. 10 x 3 = 30 and 2 x 2 = \n4, so 34 made from just the oxidation phosphorylation.\n\n(NADH and FADH2 do not make ATP- big no-no on a test. These coenzymes are \noxidized, which means they release electrons, becoming more positive. The \nelectrons are used to set up a proton gradient with protons. Protons are \nH+. H+ will charge through the ATP synthetaste protein, down its gradient \ngenerating ATP.) \n\nIn the entire cellular respiration count, we made a net gain of 2 ATP in \nglycolysis and 2 ATP in the Kreb's Cycle, which means the entire process \nsaw a gain of 38 ATP (however, it did \"cost\" 2 ATP to ship the 2 NADH made \nin the cytosol to the mitochondria, so some people might say 36 ATP). \n\nWhatever you do, do NOT give up! Get 20 sheets of computer paper and draw \nit out in a linear fashion from top to bottom and count the carbons over \nand over again and how much NADH and FADH2 was made and where. I did not \nunderstand cellular respiration the first time or second time I learned it. \nI didn't think that I was smart enough, but don't fall for that. You can do \nit! \ufeff",
