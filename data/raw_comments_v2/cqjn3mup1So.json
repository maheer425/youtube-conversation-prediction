You can use \nitdirectly in a petrol engine with no modifications and if there is a car \ncrash, the hydrogen is likely to float away from the car before it can \nexplode (even if there is a small chance of ignition) due to it being about \none fifteenth of the weight of air. In total, the ratio of the amount of \nenergy from burning the fuel to the amount of energy to make the fuel is \nmuch higher with HHO gas than petrol or diesel, as the only energy required \nfor it is to split the water, whereas with petrol and diesel, there is \nenergy required for extracting the crude oil from the ground, seperating \nthe oil in a fractioning column (requiring huge amounts of heat) and then \npurifying the fuel to reduce the amount of particles that would be \nunburned. Water does not need to be purified, in fact SHOULDN'T be purified \nfor use as a fuel. Thank you for reading, this would get 6/6 on a GCSE QWC \nquestion haha. But take this seriously, please. What people mean by a \"free \nenergy\" source is merely just a much more efficient source than is widely \nused in the world.\ufeff",
