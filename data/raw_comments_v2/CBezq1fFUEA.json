Co-Dominance is like this, \nbut without mixing, for instance, a zebra's white-black striped pattern \nwould be like Co-Dominance, as both alleles are shown, but neither is \ntechnically classified as dominant or recessive.

            "text": "+Roy Andrews\nBecause it is guaranteed to show in men if they have the trait but NOT \nalways show in women. Men have XY. Which means, if they get their X from \ntheir mom (which all men do, because if they got their X from their dad, \nthey'd be a girl), and the maternal is carrying that gene, the men will be \nbald.\n\nHowever, if the women are carrying the gene in their X, that gene is \nrecessive. So if their other X chromosome (since women are XX) has the \ndominant for not bald, then they wont be bald.\n\nWhat's most likely happening is that your maternal line has the \nheterozygous combination of this trait (one X has the trait, the other X \nhas the dominant, not-bald version). However, when the next generation is \nbeing created, these women have the recessive gene hidden in there too, and \nso they pass that gene on to the children. In the boys, there's no X to \ncounter it, so they end up bald. In the girl, the X passed from the dad \nmust have been dominant, canceling out the bald X.\n\nWhile it's unlikely to happen so many times in a row without the mom \npassing a dominant trait to a son, it's at least possible. The idea that a \npiece breaks off the X and attaches to the Y is not only likely impossible, \nbut would also mess A LOT of stuff up.",
