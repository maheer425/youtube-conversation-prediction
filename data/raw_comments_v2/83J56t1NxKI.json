First let it become \ncomfortable with you around the cage by just sitting by it and talking to \nit , then get it to be used to your hand in the cage by just putting your \nhand in and letting it sit there. And eventually move on to feeding it \ntreats from hand and stepping up . They take time and patience. & dont ever \nget mad at it and scream or hit/smack it . Dont let any cat or others \nanimals around it that could hurt your bird either . ",

Make sure you dont stick your finger in til he \ncalms down and it will take it a few days or so for him to get used to you \nand his new home. Hope this helped :)",
