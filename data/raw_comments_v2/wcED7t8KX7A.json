When any drug, recreational or otherwise, is \nconsumed, the associated changes in perception are not a direct result of \nthe consumed chemicals. Instead, (our) brains release a given chemical in \nresponse to the given chemical, (e.g. serotonin, dopamine, etc...) \nTherefore, a mammal's ability to react to a given substance depends on \ntheir brain's ability to produce other chemicals. On a side note: the fact \nthat chocolate is poisonous to dogs has nothing whatsoever to do with the \nbrain, but rather the digestive system. ",
