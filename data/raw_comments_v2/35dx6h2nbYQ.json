If you are sure you could be spotted by scouts, \nI would recommend starting on an academy where u have to pay (it's usually \nnot a lot) and you will get spotted quickly. If you are not very confident \nabout your strenght and agility with the ball, maybe you should start by \ntraining by yourself in the street somewhere where u can practice to master \nthe ball (there are a lot of guides on youtube of exercises to help you \nwith ball control). \nI hope I helped somehow, and it's never too late to start!",
