Which is great! It annoys me having all these \nguys going on a track to drive a street car goin ooooh this cars 0.2 \nseconds quicker on the track and it goes sideways boss. Yea but 99.8% of \nthe people buying them will never see a track so er what's it actually like \nas car to drive on the road. Randy's assestments on track are great because \nit's all about how it feels and the cars actual dynamics no BS based on \nbrand preference etc. Not sure where that rant came from lol\ufeff",
