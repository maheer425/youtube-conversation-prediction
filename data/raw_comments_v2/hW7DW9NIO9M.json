Where m\u2080 is the rest mass of the particle.\nThen came SR and the equation E=mc\u00b2=m\u2080c\u00b2/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) -*(b)*, for a free \nmass particle moving with relativistic speed v (v/c~1). \n\nNext we need the following Taylor series (which in this case is also an \nasymptotic series), 1/\u221a(1\u00b1x\u00b2) = 1\u2213\u00bdx\u00b2+(1\u00b73)/(2\u00b74)x\u2074\u2213..., (|x|<1). \nUsing the minus case, substituting x=v/c, and keeping only the *first two \nterms*, we get from *(b)*: E~m\u2080c\u00b2 + \u00bdm\u2080v\u00b2 -*(c)* (when v/c<<1). \n\nNotice that *(c)* has an extra term compared to *(a)* and when v=0, E=m\u2080c\u00b2. \nThis is the equation that appears in the clip above, and the reason why it \nis \"genius\". Namely, Einstein's theory of Special Relativity predicts an *additional \nenergy* (m\u2080c\u00b2) present even when v=0, and first proven experimentally by \nthe Cockcroft-Walton experiment \nhttp://www.aip.org/history/mod/fission/fission1/02.html",

The earlier (first) drawing shows the spaceship moving \nAWAY from the cat. \n\nReplacing the cat with Winnie the Pooh and raising the voice of the \nnarrator to a higher pitch would not make the video easier to understand, \neven though it might be more entertaining to some.
