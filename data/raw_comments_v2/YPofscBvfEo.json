            "text": "Tattoos may be frowned upon in Korea because of the influences of the \ngangsters and organized criminals(like Yakuza in Japan) with huge tattoos. \nCelebrities with tattoos tend to cover them up depending on what \nprogrammings they are in. Although tattoos are not illegal, there are a lot \nof illegal tattooists around, so you have to be careful. Some public baths \nand fitness centers still reject tattoos, as I've seen news of Maroon5's \nAdam Levine being kicked out of gym because of his tattoos.",
