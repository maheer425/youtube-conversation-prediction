In matter of minutes these computers could \nadvance our understanding of Cosmology by Decades if not Centuries. \n\nOf course Krause wouldn't be out of work. You still need people to \nunderstand the results so they can ask new questions.\n\n This would extend to all fields of Science and Engineering.\n\n We of course would need to make new Observations and build new tools. \n  Again Smart Manufacturing, 3D Printing would speed things up drastically. \nExpensive projects that take decades, could be done in Months and at a \nfraction of the cost.\n\nNo computer is going to spit out the designs for a Warp Drive. If a warp \ndrive is possible it may only take Decades to build not Centuries. \n\nProvided no major Cataclysm happens like a Nuclear War, The next 100 years \ncould see advances that we thought would take thousands of years. Really \njust look at the last 100 years. \n\nThat includes Medical advances so some of us may even be around to Witness \nit. People born today may be the last generation that has to face death. \nHell they may even be first people to colonize the Solar System and Galaxy. \n\nTechnology that Ends World Hunger, Poverty and Momentary systems. 3 of the \nLeading causes of Crime and War.

But this kind recognizes that the \nscience of quantum computers is just regular, ordinary quantum mechanics, \nand that we have no reason to doubt that it's possible in principle.\n2) The people who have a knee jerk reaction against the concept. For \nwhatever reason, they have decided that quantum computers are impossible \nand that something in quantum mechanics must break down to prove that it's \nnot possible.\n\nNeedless to say, (2) is pseudoscientific bullcrap (even though it would be \nvery interesting if quantum mechanics broke down in such a way, we just \ndon't have any evidence that that's true). Position (1) is what Krauss is \ntalking about, and an opinion I share. We must not confuse arguing against \nthe kind of pseudoscience in argument (2) with arguing against the concept \nof quantum computers in general. The *reasons* why you call yourself a \nskeptic are important.\n\nAnd then, there's D-wave's machine, which is not a quantum computer at all, \nand therefore exempt of Krauss's skepticism.

Their product is not a general purpose quantum computer \nlike the one Krauss is describing here. It cannot do the things that \nquantum computers are touted for, like factoring with Shor's algorithm or \nsearches with Grover's algorithm.\n\nWhat it does is a process called \"quantum annealing\". The idea is that you \nencode a hard optimization problem in a certain quantum system in such a \nway that the state of lowest energy gives you the answer. You let the \nsystem evolve, and then it's hoped that quantum mechanical tunneling will \nhelp the system reach its lowest energy state without being trapped in \nlocal minima that represent good, but not optimal, solutions to your \nproblem.\n\nThe idea is sound, and much good science has been done about it. But it has \ncaveats when it comes to implementation. In particular, even though they \nclaimed that their machine already gives results faster than a classical \ncomputer would, they were rather embarrassingly disproved by a relatively \nunoptimized python script.\n\nIt's also difficult to know what exactly is going on and if their data is \nreliable - you can't exactly trust their press releases. All in all, it \nseems reasonable to say that they achieved some pretty remarkable \nexperimental results in regards to implementing quantum systems, but so far \nit has not produced the desired speedups.\n\nIt's an interesting technological avenue and I hope they do something cool \nwith it, but calling it a quantum computer is just not accurate.",

In addition some of D-Waves \nbiggest skeptics have even switched sides and agreed it is after using it. \nI think its pretty likely it is, whether its practical or not though is a \ndifferent question as James pointed out.",
