Especially  whenever he was going in and out of the rooms \nand kept forgetting to duck his head in time. As a result resounding \nsmacking forehead right into door lintel noise was what how we could guess \nwhether the boy was in the vicinity or not. Same thing on the buses until a \nmere reminder of\"duck!\" itself was enough to get him so irritated. Oh well, \nyou know about having to folding and squeezing long limbs to fit little \nspace between seats all too well so I won't even bother to mention. \nHowever, it still was overall wonderful experience that my son can't wait \nto go back.

Also, they may have differing \nmethodologies and sample sizes. But aside from those points, I don't think \nthat these samples should be treated so seriously up to the hundredths \ndigit, so to speak: depending on the sample, it could have well been the \ncase that the average male height in HK was smaller than the average male \nheight in Taiwan by 0.25cm. For instance if you look up different studies \nof Taiwan male height (and HK too) you'll probably figures that are \ncertainly different up to the hundredths digits. \n\nI think that saying the average male height in both HK and Taiwan surpasses \n171cm is a pretty safe statement; however after the units digit, things may \nnot be as reliable. Based on (somewhat old) statistics, average male height \nin Taiwan and HK is probably about the same. (Makes sense as the vast \nmajority of Taiwanese are from Fujian, which is quite \"genetically \nhomogeneous\" to Guangdong and hence HK.)\n\nRegarding your observations, you *might* also have seen an \nuncharacteristically taller set of people in HK and / or an \nuncharacteristically short set of people in Taiwan. (Though I'd rule the \nlatter out given that you live in Taiwan, so it's probably merely the \nformer, which is quite possible due to the fact that your duration of stay \nwas a week.) \n\nOf course it's also perfectly possible that people from HK truly are taller \nthan people from Taiwan. \n\nBut to address your intended point: Hmm, I don't really think 0.25cm would \nbe sufficient to account for such a large perceived height difference. It's \ntoo small.   So it's one of two things: either you observed an \nuncharacteristically tall set people in HK and/or HK people are taller by \nmore than 0.25cm. \n\nSorry for the long write-up. If you ever go to northern China you might be \neven more taken aback. Northern Chinese males are the tallest in China (and \nAsia), at 175+ cm. :-)",

            "text": "+G. EEXHU54\nI agree with you overall but the main reason (I believe) \"short\" people and \n\"tall\" people have various ideas about what is tall is because of how the \nneck is positioned when looking at something. For shorter people they have \nto look up constantly to meet a tall persons eyes whereas a tall person \ndoes the opposite. Unless the height difference is small the angle in which \nyou are looking at a person can emphasize a person's height. Especially to \nyour own.\n\nA good example of this is when you want to take a picture of a tall \nbuilding but can't get far enough away without obstructing the view. You go \ndown to the ground and tilt the camera up to get the entire building but in \ndoing this you also make the building look much taller than if you were \nlooking at it straight on.\ufeff\n\nThough I agree that homogeneity and inhomogeneity both play a role I can \nsafely say that even a little bit of height difference does indeed make a \ndifference. I live in Taiwan right now and the avg. height for a male is \n171.45 cm (5' 7.5\") and the avg. height for a woman is 159.68 cm (5' 2.75\") \nand just this past month I went to Hong Kong for a week and the avg. height \nfor a man is 171.7 cm (5 ft 7 1\u20442 in) and for women is 158.7 cm (5 ft \n2 1\u20442 in). While I was only there for a week and Hong Kongers (sp?) are on \navg. about .35 cm (1/2\") taller than the avg. Taiwanese I could still tell \nthat they were taller and I felt much smaller even though I had not known \nthe statistic at the time (I looked it up later because I couldn't \nunderstand why I felt they were taller when I was there. Thought it might \nhave been because I was in a new country and had never been there before. \nXP).\n\nHope this makes sense and that my spelling was OK. ><",

Remember that it's not \nlinear. I've looked into studies of this trait (height) and other traits in \nthe past and it's not convincing that the standard deviation varies across \ndifferent populations that share similar socioeconomic states; the \npopulation distribution usually falls within a bell curve-like histogram \nwith very few exceptions, when a sufficiently large sample is taken. In \nfact, if anything in more developed countries with similar socioeconomic \nstatuses the standard deviation is smaller due to the relative elimination \nof malnutrition and other factors which would stretch out outliers on the \ntails of the curve; there is more of a \"normalized\" \nnutritional/environmental standard for the population. \n\nI find it a little strange that you think studies on average height in the \nUS would somehow leave out outliers in their data collections; this is \nalmost certainly a false statement. However I understand what you are \ntrying to say: the US indeed has a less homogeneous population due to \nrelatively greater genetic diversity. Due to relative inhomogeneity in the \nUS\u2014as opposed to Korea\u2014different sub-populations will have different height \ndistributions and that's probably where the observation comes from. ",

For shorter people they have to look up constantly to \nmeet a tall persons eyes whereas a tall person does the opposite. Unless \nthe height difference is small the angle in which you are looking at a \nperson can emphasize a person's height. Especially to your own.\nA good example of this is when you want to take a picture of a tall \nbuilding but can get far enough away without obstructing the view.
