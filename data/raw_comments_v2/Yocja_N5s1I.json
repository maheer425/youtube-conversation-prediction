Henry VIII found walking \ndifficult because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the \n\"Vir- gin Queen.\" As a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth exposed \nherself be- fore her troops, they all shouted \"hurrah.\" Then her navy went \nout and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.\nThe greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear. Shakespear \nnever made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He lived in \nWindsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors. In \none of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by \nrelieving himself in a long soliloquy. In another, Lady Macbeth tries to \nconvince Mac- beth to kill the King by attacking his manhood. Romeo and \nJuliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Writing at the same time as \nShakespear was Miquel Cervantes. He wrote \"Donkey Hote\". The next great \nauthor was John Milton. Milton wrote \"Paradise Lost.\" Then his wife dies \nand he wrote \"Paradise Regained.\"\n\nDuring the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great \nnavigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His \nships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later the Pilgrims \ncrossed the Ocean, and the was called the Pilgrim's Progress. When they \nlanded at Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by Indians, who came down the \nhill rolling their was hoops before them. The Indian squabs carried \nporposies on their back. Many of the Indian heroes were killed, along with \ntheir cabooses, which proved very fatal to them. The winter of 1620 was a \nhard one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. \nCaptain John Smith was responsible for all this.\n\nOne of the causes of the Revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks in \ntheir tea. Also, the colonists would send their pacels through the post \nwith- out stamps. During the War, Red Coats and Paul Revere was throwing \nballs over stone walls. The dogs were barking and the peacocks crowing. \nFinally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.\n\nDelegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented Congress. \nThomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the \nDeclaration of Independence. Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his \nclothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm. He invented elec- \ntricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared \"a horse divided against \nitself cannot stand.\" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.\n\nGeorge Washington married Matha Curtis and in due time became the Father of \nOur Country. Them the Constitution of the United States was adopted to \nsecure domestic hostility. Under the Constitution the people enjoyed the \nright to keep bare arms.\nAbraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother died \nin infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own \nhands. When Lincoln was President, he wore only a tall silk hat. He said, \n\"In onion there is strength.\" Abraham Lincoln write the Gettysburg address \nwhile traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an envelope. \nHe also signed the Emasculation Proclamation, and the Fourteenth Amendment \ngave the ex-Negroes citizenship. But the Clue Clux Clan would torcher and \nlynch the ex-Negroes and other innocent victims. On the night of April 14, \n1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the \nactors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was John Wilkes \nBooth, a sup- posedl insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.\nMeanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare \ninvented electricity and also wrote a book called \"Candy\". Gravity was \ninvented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when the \napples are flaling off the trees.\nBach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel. Handel \nwas half German, half Italian and half English. He was very large. Bach \ndied from 1750 to the present. Beethoven wrote music even though he was \ndeaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest \neven when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later \ndied for this.\n\nFrance was in a very serious state. The French Revolution was accomplished \nbefore it happened. The Marseillaise was the theme song of the French \nRevolu- tion, and it catapulted into Napoleon. During the Napoleonic Wars, \nthe crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes. Then the Spanish \ngorrilas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's flanks. Napoleon \nbecame ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained. He \nwanted an heir to inheret his power, but since Josephine was a baroness, \nshe couldn't bear him any children.\n\nThe sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in \nthe East and the sun sets in the West. Queen Victoria was the longest \nqueen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. He reclining years and finally the \nend of her life were exemplatory of a great personality. Her death was the \nfinal event which ended her reign.\nThe nineteenth century was a time of many great inventions and thoughts. \nThe invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up. \nCyrus McCormick invented the McCormick Raper, which did the work of a \nhundred men. Samuel Morse invented a code for telepathy. Louis Pastuer \ndiscovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturailst who wrote the \n\"Organ of the Species\". Madman Curie discovered radium. And Karl Marx \nbecame one of the Marx Brothers.\nThe First World War, cause by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by a surf, \nushered in a new error in the anals of human history.\"  that's it. ever \nsince then, we and history is all fignewtons of Dog's imagination.\n\nhttp://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/fcc/humor/history.html\ufeff",

All accomplishments \nhave been made in the last ten thousand years. So what exactly happened \nthat that put an end to primitivism and kick-started the age of creativity \nand invention? The answer is beer.\n\nBeer happened, and it changed the world forever. It sounds almost too \nbizarre to be true, but many anthropologists and archaeologists now believe \nthat it was a taste for beer, not bread, that started people farming barley \nin around 9000BC.\n\nKnown as the agricultural revolution, it ended hunter-gathering and led to \nthe world's first ever civilisation - Mesopotamia. The drive to grow more \nbarley in order to make more beer, led to a cascade of inventions. The \nplough, the wheel, irrigation, mathematics and even writing, all of these \nworld-changing innovations were dreamed up to help with the production and \ndistribution of beer.\n\nAs Egypt took over from Mesopotamia, in the Land of the Pharaohs beer was \nthe national currency, a dietary staple and even an important medicine. Put \nsimply, without beer, we wouldn't have the pyramids. Even in more recent \ntimes, beer's hidden hand has been behind some of history's most remarkable \nbreakthroughs, from the discovery of germ theory and modern medicine, to \nthe invention of refrigeration, the birth of the factory and the end of \nchild labour. Beer didn't just change the world, it saved it!\ufeff",
