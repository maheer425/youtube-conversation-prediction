However, Yin Yang is a Chinese and \nTaoist philosophy (not religion) based on observations of nature. \n'Everything in nature is whole, a balance of Yin Yang energies.\n\nThe concept of this duality manifested itself into the origins of Chinese \nscience, philosophy, traditional medicine, and martial arts. Later, \nConfucianism and the I Ching Ten Wings gave the concept a greater moral \naspect. The Han Dynasty was very influential in the metamorphosis from the \nold ways to the new. In fact, many compare the age of the Han Dynasty to \nthe Ancient Greek enlightenment.\n\nOn the other hand, before I delve further I would like to present a video \nthat gives a 'basic' idea of Yin Yang.
