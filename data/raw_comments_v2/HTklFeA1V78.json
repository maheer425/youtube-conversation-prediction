To me it really \nsymbolizes the theme of ephemerality that dominates the book, every chapter \nbeing titled \"x days before\", or \"x days after\", this and the candle (and \nobviously the plot) really speak to me about just how fast a person's life \nand circumstance and change, and I get that it being cigarette smoke speaks \nto that as well, while also referencing the theme of self-destruction, the \ncandle just works for me. Also, it makes me think about the soliloquy in \nMacbeth \"She would have died later anyway. That news was bound to come \nsomeday. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. The days creep slowly along \nuntil the end of time. And every day that\u2019s already happened has taken \nfools that much closer to their deaths.
