Falcon, sonic, fox, zss, get faced against one of them on this \nstage and you're not playing a character that can keep up with em, if they \nget a stock lead on you they can just run away the entire rest of the match \nuntil the timer runs out. In smash4 yeah sure they do have to confront you \nonce and awhile to avoid getting automatically kicked for inactivity by the \ngame, but they can easily go in, maybe get a few hits or take a few in the \ntunnel, then go straight back to pure evasion. IN brawl there was no \nauto-kick feature so any unfortunate souls who got up against a fast runner \nand lost a stock, they mght as well just D/c'd, or put their controller \ndown cuz they weren't making a comeback.\n\nWhy nintendo keeps adding this stage back in each new game as opposed to \nsomething like hyrule castle from smash64, or saffron city, I'll never \nknow.\ufeff",
