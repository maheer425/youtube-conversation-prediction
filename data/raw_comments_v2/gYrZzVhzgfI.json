And only a \nthin layer of wax is enough to keep spores from growing in your ear canal. \nEarwax takes months to move out of the ear canal regardless of how much you \nchew. It does move debris out of the canal but so does Q-tips. Build up of \nwax can cause temporary hearing lose and even ear drum perforation, so does \nQ-tips. Cleaning the wax out of ones ears has been done since well before \nthe time of Q-tips, There is a healthy amount of earwax but allowing to \njust go wild is foolhardy at best. P.S. earwax does not stop itching, it \ncauses it as it traps whatever irritant is making your ear itch.\ufeff",
