(plenty of people who own a cat or dog \nwho don't even know what they need)\nSo i can only hope that this video didn't cause too many people to just \nwant to go and get one of these pets without being able to give them proper \ncare/loving/food/space/attention/playmate/time/ect...\n\nOther then that, i enjoyed the video, the smart(er) people who watched \nprobably noticed they gave plenty of information about how to keep those \npets and the difficulties involving them. Nice job!\ufeff",
