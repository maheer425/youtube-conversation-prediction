Danny Boyle is truly one of the most interesting \ndirectors working today, be it in the UK (I'd say he's the best out of \nthere right now) or anywhere else. I feel British cinema before this \nfocused too much on irony, dry humor and Hugh Grant to compete with \nAmerican cinema, be it the best we gave or the worst. Dialogue was very \nmuch emphasized in this visual medium (not that there's anything wrong with \nthat...I understand Britain's rich literary history). Then Boyle came along \nand gave us some of the best direction we would ever see from any film in \nthat decade, taking the cool, visceral thrill of American pop-films (i.e. \nTarantino) and showing that you guys don't need us. With Edgar Wright and \nmany more coming after, Brit cinema has been a force to reckon with ever \nsince.\ufeff",
