These two products perform in completely different \nways.  If you don't know the difference between them, then home built \nrocket motors are probably not for you.  Also note that \"Pyrodex\" is \nanother BP substitute for firearms, but it performs more like a smokeless \nnitrocellulose powder and makes a poor substitute for ejection charges.  \nYou'll do much better to use real 3F or 4F black powder, but if you use \nTriple Seven, be sure to make the end cap as tight as possible for \ncontainment of the charge.
