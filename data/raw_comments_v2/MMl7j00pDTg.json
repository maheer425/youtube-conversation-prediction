No suspects of the pogrom have been convicted. \nAlso hope that someone also makes a film, a documentary, or even new report \nabout thousands of Hindus killed by sikh terrorists in India, especially \npunjab in 1980s. Some villages had no male members left. Indira gandhi took \naction against terrorist leader bhindrawale and was killed for that. Still \ngurdwaras worship bhindrawale as 11th guru. I find that insulting to all \ngurus that sikhs themselves equate a terrorist to a stature of a guru. On \nanother note, equally ironic, how there's no movie, documentary on Hindus \nkilled by Muslims by burning train that started the 2002 riots in which \nhindu and muslims were killed. Though over 500 people have been convicted \nin 2002 riots but no one follows up about Hindu victims of 2002 riots or of \nsikh terrorism of 1980s.\ufeff",
