So often, when time \ntravel is not the focus of the story, it comes off as cheesy and \nunrealistic, but in \"Freedom Maze\", it's made real in the strange \ndisconnect of the initial viewing: the girl, Sophie, at first believes \nherself to be on an adventure like Alice in Wonderland or Narnia, but as \ntime goes on, she forgets both the childish notions of 'the good old days' \nshe wanted to adventure in, and her old life. And as she forgot, so did I- \ntaking a break from reading, I was a little confused as to how we had \nelectricity and could make a meal in 5 minutes.I also understood, for the \nfirst time how deeply de-humanizing slavery was; it wasn't just that you \ncouldn't speak out against an unfair beating or sexual advances because \nyou'd be seen as a liar, you'd also be extremely ungrateful to your 'kind \nbenevolent masters', who would have good reason to cleanse you of your \ningratitude with a whip. \nREAD THIS BOOK.

Anyhow, as i said, if \nyou want to use the form of the text, the word usage, and surreal elements, \npoetry is your thing. Literature was meant to convey ideas through the \nstory, charachters, and their emotions. Wich you best experience if you can \nimmerse yourself in them -> wich you can best do if your attention can be \nfocused on them, not on figuring out what the hack they do, from obscure \ntext.
