The methods used to make them started pretty \nbasic as cloth dipped in plaster and hammered metal. Presidential portraits \nare a historical practice. They speak to our collective memory. They will \nbe done because once somebody has reached that place they will be captured \nin many likenesses as part of history - even the ones you or I did not vote \nfor. The fact that technology, starting with strips of cloth.....cloth in \nitself has a history but that is another post - the fact that we have gone \nfrom cloth dipped into plaster to digital, 3/D imaging is not just \nastounding, it's breathtaking. \n\nWhen I read the shallow political vitriol in the comments I first want to \nget mad but really what I get is sad. It is a sad time when the need to be \nright, the need to call names, to put people down in this country takes \nprecedence over a truly remarkable accomplishment. The ability to make such \na likeness provides so many possibilities for so many applications for so \nmuch good and all people can seem to do is spew disgusting comments, call \npeople names and mock. I prefer to still believe that this is not the \nmajority of who we are in this country. Even though the comments are pretty \nshortsighted, uneducated, ugly and just plain sad.\n\nThis video is astounding and I have a group of bright, engaged, creative \nand fabulous students who I intend to share it with. They will be the \nleaders of the future and I know they will appreciate it for what it really \nis. By the way, right now you can buy your own 3/D printer and make \nwhatever your heart desires right now. They are around $2000 but in a few \nyears they will be as accessible as any other technology is. Then you can \nmake copies of your own likeness and post it along with whatever crap you \ndecide to throw at me after you \"hate\" my post.\ufeff",
