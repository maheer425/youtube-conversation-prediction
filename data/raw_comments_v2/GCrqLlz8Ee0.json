Dry hands \ngreat, but just the tiniest coating of sweat on your body and you will burn \nyour fingers off, or have a heart attack, or die. Do not do that! The human \nbody is not consistent when it comes to electricity, that is why even \nelectric chairs do not work or have varying effects. Same with lightning \nstrikes. Just ask a survivor. Sweat, salt and other contents in your blood, \noils on skin, how pressed the conductor is against skin (do not squeeze!), \netc. all can give you a nasty surprise. Also, I am always hearing this \nconversation about what kills you volts or amps. The answer is P=IE, so \nreal power P (Watts)= volts times amps is the basic answer. With AC \n(alternating current) it is actually a little safer because the power is in \ncomponents of reactive and average power, the problem is that the body is \n\"usually\" and mostly resistive load (the space between our bones are like \ncapacitors so that helps) so the apparent power will lean into average \npower or \"real\" power becoming very unpredictable and dangerous. Also, once \nthere is a path through your body you likely will not be able to let go \nbecause the power supply will be controlling your nerve impulses and in \nturn your muscles.

When I unplugged \nit, one of the power connection prongs were turning black.\n\nI then tried to connect it with reversed polarity, also laying the \"I\" \nportion gently on top of the E portion of the core. A very loud cracking \nsound and the transformer began to vibrate.\n\nhelp plz? I don't want to die, LOL!\ufeff",
