(7-years into production) Their formula is a not \na closely guarded military secret. Take a 3.5+ liter V6 (or larger \ndisplacement) engine, add twin turbochargers, drop in now readily available \n6, 7, or 8 speed dual clutch transmission into an all-wheel drive transfer \ncase, in a relatively HEAVY body/frame with a curb weight of nearly 4000 \nlbs. Done. They CAN'T replicate that? Really? It's a not a million dollar \ncarbon fiber bodied Koenigsegg or a Ferrari with a watered down Formula 1 \nengine that revs to 10,000 rpms under the hood. What's the problem? Nissan \nhas created a supercar for the masses, and the formula is shockingly \nsimple. I can't figure out why their direct competitors are still lagging \nso far behind in their thought process? This car will mop the floor with \nall the other performance cars out there at a price point of 150k or less. \nThat includes the new 2015 Corvette Z06, 2014 Mustang GT500, and 2015 \nCamaro ZL1 which are still using second-tier supercharger \ntechnology, instead of the clearly more powerful and efficient top-tier \nturbocharging technology.
