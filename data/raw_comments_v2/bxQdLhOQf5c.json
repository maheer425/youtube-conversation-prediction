I was doing a little bit of minute research, I found that \nchildren separated from their biological parents and placed for adoption \ndeal with trauma, and the hypothetical adopting parents will most likely \naccept and connect with the child at a slow pace if they are able to \nconnect at all. You argue that everyone, or most people, should adopt but \nshould people who would be ill-equip to help an adopted child through that \nsort of inner struggle (through lack of willingness, ability, \nunderstanding, etc.) really adopt? One possible argument might be that this \nperson, or couple, shouldn't have children at all, but realistically people \nwho want children will procreate or adopt no matter what you argue. \n\n\nOn another related note... On an equal plane, from one fellow human being \nto another, I would appreciate your take on this: I have always thought \nthat if I where to have children I would probably have just one until I met \nthis my partner. She and I are still far from children but I know she will \nwant to have 2-3. My primary reasons for not wanting a large family is \nbecause I am not accustom to it (growing up it was my mother, sister, and \nI) and I don't like the idea of contributing to the human population issue. \nI think If we where to have one biological child and 1-2 adopted children I \nwould view that as ideal and it would be the best way to get her on board \nwith the it. My question: Do you think it would be wrong to have both a \nbiological child and an adopted child because the adopted child may feel \nless loved than their sibling despite any efforts to prevent it? I plan to \nmention the idea to her but I always like to hear multiple opinions, thank \nyou!",

I'm also just saying we should \nnot limit our understanding of polygamy and monogamy to just the biological \nsense.\n\nAnyways, I'm not an expert on the matter, but I can say I prefer living in \nthis way. The world is so much more better for me. If you don't like the \norganized way of living we have now, you can always leave and go to the \nwild and unclothe yourself if you want to. The very fact that you don't \nwalk around public naked is partly because of your social environment, is \nit not? However, after centuries of living in this way, I think our minds \nhave already evolved in a way that makes clothing, shelter, coupling and  \ninteracting the way it is now. Similar to how our feet has become so soft \nbecause of footwear that it has become extremely difficult for us to walk \nbarefoot.\n\nI think I'll prefer monogamy. I feel like if I'll get a partner who wants \npolygamy, I think I'll be suffering in a way worse than \"not following my \ninstincts.\" If I'm not following my instincts now, whatever those insticts \nare, I think I'm perfectly fine with it, because my mind and body is \ntelling me I only want a one on one relationship. I guess that's my \ninstinct? I already like the way I'm living as a human. Plus, in a \nmonogamous life, there is less danger for HIV and when you have children, \nthere is less complexities involved.\n\nIn any case, if you want multiple wives/husbands, there are always people \nout there who want an open relationship so I guess if you want such a \nrelationship, just look for people who agree with you and don't force \npeople to accept your views, or else you'll hurt them. There are also \ncultures out there that accept it. Maybe it's time to move? Plus, if you \nwant another partner, divorce makes that easily possible anyway.

Women won't cheat if they find a better \nprovider, they will just leave their husband. Which means the people they \nare cheating with should have a reduced ability to have children (as he is \nrelying on another man to raise his children) and in a capitalist culture \nthat means they will most likely be less successful and success correlates \nwith intelligence.\nBasically women are more likely to cheat with someone who is more \naggressive and who is less intelligent. \nThis is only if they have children of course.

The \nact of staying monogamus does relate to religion, but is not solely \ndependent on it. The institution of marriage as a concept has been around \nfor a very long time, but the act of staying with one main spouse may have \nstarted beforehand. Biologically, it made sense because we had to take car \nof those who passed down our genetics. As time passed, we tended to stay in \npairs because that was the environment we were raised in (though not \nalways). This isn't to say cheating or poligamy are entirely based on our \nbiology. In fact, religion comes in to some of this. Religions and beliefs \nare by far some of the most intricate social creations mankind has ever \nthought of, and by far the most diverse. Though each individual with \nbeliefs may have variations, many people around the world agree on similar \nconcepts, such as the existence of an afterlife, \"good deeds\" and \"bad \ndeeds\", and an overall power. Undeniably, another concept is the \ninstitution of marriage. And this is where it gets complicated, because \neach religion and belief views it differently, and each individual in each \nreligion or belief have their own agreements and disagreements with what \nthe religion says about marriage. And of course each individual would (or \nwouldn't) raise their child or children and influence the religious views \nthey had later in life. You may be wondering how not raising a child would \ninfluence them, so to boil it down the emotional discharge that the parent \nleaves behind may affect how the child views the other parent or figure \nthat raises them. And with all the complicated factors of divorces, \nseparation, and custody battles in today's society, it's easy to see why \nsome people feel a little better staying married and not getting detailed \nabout the beliefs or completely exclude them. Not to mention, if monogamy \nwere solely based on religion, the marriage wouldn't be successful for \natheists, but studies show that atheists have the lowest divorce rate. This \ncould point to an ancestral influence from previous atheists who saw how \nreligion affected the institution of marriage and decide to stay outside of \nthe church. This disposition toward religions and beliefs could carry on as \nsuccessful. ",

Otherwise you \nwouldn't press the exact opposite without also contributing a reason as to \nwhy it's so \"smart and logical\" (These by the way mean basically the same \nthing)\"\n\nNowhere did I say I expected you to agree with me. I just expected you to \npresent an actual argument instead of just saying:\n\n\"[...]it is no longer that way anymore. It's just not.\"\n\nYeaaaaah, that *seems pretty logical* to me.\n\nAlso, I never said that prenups caused the raise in divorce rates - I just \nsaid that it contributed to them.\n\nAlso, as I said, prenuptial agreements have a negative effect in that they \nenable couples with children to break off much easily, damaging young \nchildren's ideas of family values.\n\nAnd no, I also did not say we have to go back to what was. In fact, I go \nagainst such a thing. If you can't break off a marriage, that's even more \ndamaging for children and people alike - a drunk and aggressive or cheating \nparent is simply not a good partner. (Prime examples of people who can't \nlet go of their ego.) These will convey worse messages to their children \nthan an act of divorce ever would.\n\nInstead we should correct along the way. We managed to get from one extreme \nto the other - from never being able to break off a marriage to it being \ntoo easy. Now we have to find the golden middle, where only those can break \noff their marriage whose marriage wouldn't work no matter how much effort \nthey put into it.\n\nSay, a gay man pushes himself and marries a woman, and he just can't get it \nup after a while, and the pressure put on himself while he's trying to \nchange is making him start to break down. The only real solution is a \ndivorce (and a possible remarry to another man) even if children are \nalready involved.\n\nBut if someone wants to break up with their spouse because, say, the wife \nwants to try it with another man (or a threeway, or some similar kinky \nstuff)\nOr if because a father doesn't spend enough time with his daughter for *some \nreason* and the mother - instead of asking what's wrong - starts yelling at \nhim, they are planning a divorce... well, these are just not good enough \nreasons.\n\nMarried people need to talk about what's wrong, and divorcing needs to be \nharder than putting effort into talking and practicing empathy towards \nsomeone else.\n\nAnd at this point, *not* having a prenuptial agreement helps. Because if \nthis happens, the only way you will get your share of the money is through \ntalking. While talking, you may actually fix a marriage without having to \nbreak up. Or if not, you'll have understood your partner's standpoint \nenough to feel a dull, bittersweet caring for em. Which in turn would make \nyou want not to fuck them up and take their possessions like some vulture \nwaiting for an animal to fall.\n\nOf course this requires a better system enabled by the state - like a \nforced two months couple therapy before you could divorce (or something \nthat took more than 5 minutes to conceive).\n\nSo yeah, prenuptial agreements are a dead end that'll cause more misery \nthan they are worth. My standpoint for the future is a system that \nrejuvenates lost loves.\n\nGo, marriage and actually taking the effort to understand the person you \nonce fallen for!",
