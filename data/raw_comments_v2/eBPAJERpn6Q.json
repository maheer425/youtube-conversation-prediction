Thought \nyou book lovers and authors might appreciate this.\n\nI totally agree about spoilers in the blurbs - WHY? You have one job to do \nin the blurb, entice readers to buy the book and read it, which are not \nnecessarily mutually exclusive but can often be separate issues. Most book \nnerd's excessive to be read piles proves that! Don't tell me about a major \nplot twist or plotting point in the novel, I want to be surprised. One of \nthe great pleasures of reading is coming across a moment of surprise, \ntorment, joy or significance and it utterly flawing you and exciting you to \nfind out how that situation unfolds. \n\nAlso and in a separate and not really related rant - DO NOT tell me that a \nfantasy character is 'the chosen one', 'the only one' to bring freedom, \nsurvival or resolution to a situation. In life there are very, very few \ncircumstances when resolution or progress occurs without collaboration. The \ncult of the individual keeps perpetuating the myth that there are some \ngreat individuals who change the world while the rest of us simply blithely \nallow the world to happen to us. But this is neither realistic or true. All \nthe progress that we make as a society and a world occurs by us standing on \nthe shoulders of giants. \n\nFolks, have a beautiful day!\n\n#books  \ufeff",
