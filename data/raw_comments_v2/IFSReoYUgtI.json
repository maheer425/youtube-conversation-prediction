Driving the STi like a madman \non bumpy backroads, as I frequently do, I'm too busy having fun to notice \nthat the interior is just okay. For the price, the STi is a great \nperformance car. No, it isn't a refined luxury sports sedan from Lexus - \nthank goodness. There are too many comfy, wanna-be sports sedans with soft \nsuspensions and an automatic-only transmission (like the lame Audi S-3 that \nis automatic-only, here in the United States). The STi, the Evo 10 (my \nprevious car), and the Ford Focus ST (my other car) are capable rally cars \nthat are really fun to drive! If you actually like driving fast and aren't \ntrying to impress your neighbors with a sleek, stylish fashion statement - \nbuy an STi. Buy an STi and enjoy driving it before every car turns into \ncomfy cruiser like Audi and BMW have become or, just as awful, before every \ncar turns into a joyless appliance like the Nissan Leaf or Prius.\ufeff",
