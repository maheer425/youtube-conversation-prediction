With Tau, \nlearning and understanding circles would be easier for students being \nintroduced to them. But I think that durning the actual calculations, \nstudents should use it in terms of Pi. I know that if I were taught that \n2Pi = Tau, therefore Tau can nicely segment the circle, it would have made \nit easier to grasp. Thus calculations in terms of Pi would be simpler. But \nMatt made a great point that Pi is used as a unit, and Tau wouldn't be \nsensible since it IS the circle.\n\nIn short, they both have great arguments. But it's more effective to give \nperspective on both terms of thinking regarding circles, yet still using Pi \ncalculations in order to keep it universal. \ufeff",

Using Tau will create fractions and really detracts from the \nunit. I agree with Matt, it makes more sense to use \u03c0 as it allows it to be \na better unit. Encompassing something takes something away. \nPi is everywhere from Hawking's equations to Coulomb's law (where k is \n1/4\u03c0e0). It's for this reason that Steve's notion of it not being a just \none unit is redundant. If we used Tau we'd get 4\u03c4 and 2\u03c4 so it doesn't \nactually \"solve\" anything.\ufeff",
