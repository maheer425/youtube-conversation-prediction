            "text": "Some of those products are actually good to have around. Like the sock \nbuddy is for elderly people and overweight people I would say and I would \nuse that sucker, some of those items like the toilet with arms , like you \nmentioned, would be good for a person that has no arms and to answer you \nquestion of how would they get their pants on in the first place, simple, \nthey would have another device that helps them do that too. There are times \nwhere I would like to have that portable microwave and maybe you could take \nit camping with you. The Ab hancer is just a dumb idea but I bet I could \nuse that thing to grill meat on with Reynolds wrap. The automatic tea pot \npouring helping thing is a good invention too. Some people have tremors and \nshake a lot and need help pouring their drinks. The self making bed is \nprobably for disabled people as well. The self scooping litter box is yet \nanother good idea for 2 reasons, if a robot deals with feces instead of \nyou, you stay germ free and a lot of diseases coming from things in or on \nfeces and the other thing is you don't know how many cats a person owns and \nsome people would have like 5 or 10 cats because they are crazy or trying \nto sell them and that's a lot of crap to handle manually. The Poo trap is \nnot likely to work and it would make the dog walker go through a lot of \nwork keeping the dog calm and just standing there while you remove the bag \nafter the dog uses it so that's a dumb invention and definitely wont help \nlazy people. Why would lazy people own a dog anyways or walk them? Those \nglasses are yet another good invention though to people who would \nappreciate their use. People get a lot of neck strain reading and sitting \nin one place with their neck bent over for a long time and could use a \ndifferent way to be able to read more comfortably. And one more item is \nworth having and that is the toilet paper extender. in some homes bathrooms \naren't even built right and there is no real good close place to install a \ntoilet paper holder. I am sure a lot of people don't want to get off of the \ntoilet while they still have crap smeared all over their butt from just \ntaking a dump and haven't wiped yet, to walk over to a roll of toilet paper \nwith that issue they are dealing with. How many people are going to always \nremember before they have a bathroom emergency, that they need toilet paper \nafterwords? A lot of people  would only be thinking about not crapping in \ntheir pants and embarrassing themselves in front of someone. All those \nother items though are pretty dumb, well except for the electronic \nscissors. Someone that could have an at home sewing job or some job that \nrequired them to use scissors a lot more than an average person, like a \ncoupon collector maybe, would be using those things for hours. If they used \nregular scissors that long they would probably develop arthritis in their \nhands.\ufeff",
