But to me, the most interesting analysis is when you start to \nlook at it on an industry level. \n\nFor instance, the population pyramid of the newspaper industry clearly \nillustrates the problem this industry is in. It's heavy at the top and \nextremely light at the button (the upside down pyramid). And while the top \n(the oldest) remains fairly steady, it's experiencing a polarization effect \nthat creates a bigger and bigger divide between the younger and older \ndemographics. \n\nBut studying your population and how it evolves over time is not just \nrelevant for newspapers. It's relevant for every industry. For instance, if \nyou have a fashion brand targeting teenage girls, it's not really a problem \nif you lose your audience when they get older if you are also continually \ngaining new teenagers. The problem is if the 12-14 year-olds suddenly start \nto think of your brand as 'being too old'. Then you might not be able to \nsee it immediately in terms of sales, but your brand is doomed as your \npopulation matures.\n\nStudying your brand's or industry's population data is often the first \nplace to spot problems (or opportunities).\n\nPopulation pyramids: Powerful predictors of the future - Kim Preshoff\ufeff",
