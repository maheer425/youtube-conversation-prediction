There are many graduates out of work waiting \ntables and high school only graduates making tons of money designing, \ncoding, being entrepreneurs, YouTubing (even with college degrees and not \napplying it) and many more. I'm not against specialized knowledge though; \nyou should always search for knowledge to better yourself and your craft \nbut you don't have to do it through the failed, cookie cutter and out dated \ncurriculum offered at colleges; they are in the business of making money \nand the government is now in the business of enslaving the young with debt: \nThey make about 70 Billion in profit from student loans in a 5yr time \nframe. \ufeff",
