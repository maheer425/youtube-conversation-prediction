Frankfurt, while \ngrowing, has melted with a lot of surrounding, smaller and old villages \nthat now make part of the city itself, in example Bornheim, Nordend, \nEckenheim, Eschersheim or Sachsenhausen (the latter south of the river \nmain).\n\nNot only their architecture is partially very different from the \ninteresting mix in the center (many older and smaller houses), the \npopulation is, too.  I live in an apartment in the Nordend (\"north end\") \ndistrict which has long time ago ceased to be the northern end of the city \n*:D* .  The houses in our street were built in 1900 and survived WWII.  \nSpecially Nordend and Bornheim (at least the northern part of Bornheim) are \nstill home for a special culture and population mixture, with many \nnon-Germans, which makes them a nice place to be (unlike Offenbach, where \nthe same situation is said to be rather problematic).  Offenbach, anyhow, \nif not a part of Frankfurt.\n\nFrankfurt can be a great place to be, and yes, public transportation is a \nmess - but one you can easily get used to.\ufeff",
