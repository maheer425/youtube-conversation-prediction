We made \nsome at home years ago and our first batch was very dry and it kept a long \ntime, but it wasn't the greatest texture for eating. The second batch was \nmore tender (and hence had more water remaining in it) and these ones \ndidn't keep long before moisture caused mold:(\n\nMost of the store bought stuff I have tried (and not very often, just \ncamping or hiking as a kid) was of the tender-er variety. I think the \npackets probably keep moisture from accumulating on the inside of the bag, \nthus extending shelf life.\n\nDamn..now I feel like beef jerky...",
