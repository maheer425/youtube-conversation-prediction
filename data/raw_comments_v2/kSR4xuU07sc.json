This ranges anywhere from distant and \nnon-demonstrative parents or families where the person just never fit in to \nliteral torture. And before anyone starts that story in their head that \nthere is some scale of hard where these people fit in, take a listen to Ash \nBeckham. Nobody's hard is any more or less than anyone else's. Hard is just \nhard.\n\nSo our childhood's where hard. So what? you say. Just get on with it. Move \non with your life. Well, to that I say \"No.\" Why should we? Oh, I don't \nmean digging in to figure out why or blaming this that or the other for the \nway we are now. That has its place, it's time, and it's healing modalities. \nI'm talking about the little wounded kids we still are inside who don't \nneed one more lesson in how to survive. They need to be cuddled and loved \nand hugged up and reminded that they are precious just because they exist. \nJust because we're adult doesn't mean we don't still need good parents and \ngood parenting. That need doesn't go away because we go out into the world \non our own.\n\nThe hard part is that we continue looking for others to provide it to us. \nOur lovers, our friends, our coworkers and even acquaintances. Every \nsituation we get into becomes a means to get some form of love and \nnurturing and bonding and support and enough is never enough. So we wander \nthrough life searching, never finding, moving through one relationship \nafter another and never getting what we need. So let's stop the cycle. \nSince we are adults, we know exactly what we need and how we need it (in \nfact we've related it to all of our lovers in detail so we have it \nmemorized) how about we start providing it to the one person who needs it \nthe most...us. All the energy and effort that we put into everything else \neverywhere else, let's direct a little or a lot our way. Move beyond \nself-care to parenting and see yourself as the precious piece of divinity \nyou are.

            "text": "The pioneers of homosexual activism emerged in Germany in the 1860s.\nMen like Ulrichs, and Kertbeny.\nStrangely enough, though the homosexual was ostentatiously portrayed as \nmorally corrupt, sick,  criminal and borderline insane by the first public \nhomosexuals THEMSELVES,\nit was at the same time energetically and even vehemently argued how unjust \nand sad it was, \nthat this unfortunate, suffering creature should have to suffer even more \nthan he already did, \nand be oppressed by law, \nbeing criminally penalized and not granted the same rights as anybody else.\n\nIndeed, 150 years ago, \nwhen homosexuality first became a fascinating and scandalous topic of \nsocial interest, \na mediatized issue,\nALREADY then, this was the discourse...\n\nIt makes you wonder if much has really changed in a century and a half...\n\nYes, some things did change very significantly:\nauthority has since some decades decriminalized homosexuality, \nand most shrinks no longer contend homosexuals are mentally ill per se.\nBut that's basically it.\n\nIn terms of perception, what people REALLY feel deep down about homosexuals,\nnot all that much has changed at all.\n\nToday the story goes that there's so much \"hate \"and \"homophobia\" around,\nand vocal, mass-mediatized gays keep asserting that these are highly \nalarming, \nstrange, irrational phenomena,\nthat are the very reason they are  'fighting', and that all of society must \nbe\nmobilized against these inhumane forces of darkness.\n\nGays have 'come a long way', but the fight isn't over by a long shot.\nThere is still so much hate to tackle!!\n\nGay activists really have no other message, \nand it seems this incessant and monolithic focus on the oppressive, evil \nforces\nof \"hate\" and \"homophobia\" and \"bigotry\",\nthat quite apparently are not at all abating but rather increasing,\ninvariably seems to yield counter-productive results.\n\nIt seems there is something self-defeating about this 'War on Homophobia',\nsomething that doesn't quite square,\nand that is strangely reminiscent of the 'War on Drugs' or the 'War on \nTerror',\nas if the very purpose and the effect of such \"wars\" was precisely to create\nwhat it claims to combat.\n\n\nThe very discourse of vocal gays today shows that public perception of \nhomosexuality is STILL extremely negative, and one has to wonder:\nwho has created this perception, if not especially the vocal gays \nthemselves, \nthe gays people have seen on their television screens?\n\nCould they at least be partly responsible for all this negativity, this \n'hate'?\n\nIn fact, it is a true headbreaker to try thinking of anything positive gays \nhave\nput out in the public sphere that has ever generated positive associations \nwith \nhomosexuality.\n I have to admit I can't think of anything, except some vapid lines, like\n'Gay is Good', or 'Proud To Be Gay'.\n\nSuch hazy propaganda slogans, lines chanted by parading gays,\nonly tend confirm that actual positive content is indeed  lacking \naltogether, \nor there would be no place for such trite rhetoric.\n\nThe negative content on the other hand is simply overwhelming, and all over \nthe place.\n\nFor one thing, it is simply a fact of life that from the mid-eighties to \nthe mid-nineties, \neverybody has seen the sick gays on their televions screens, \nwalking corpses soon dying of mysterious afflictions...\nEnough to make anyone quite 'phobic'.\n\nPeople have seen many obscene and pornographic gays in organized parades,\nobsessed with c*ck and promiscuous sex,\nand flaunting it all at the public,\nas if obscenity and sexual indugence where amazing acts of empowering \ngayness.\n\nEverybody has seen many effeminate gays, walking with a wish, talking with \na lisp,\nwhose main pupose in life appears to be getting stuffed with c*ck,\nand who don't appear to know much else.\n\nWhat's more, a link between homosexuality and paedophilia has \nsystematically \nbeen introduced into the collective sphere since many decades, \nby many gay activists who condoned this practice,\nand who typically will argue in a suspect fashion for the further lowering \nof the age of consent, \nbringing up such creepy arguments as 'children's right to love'.\n\n\"Founding father\" of modern gaylib Harry Hay for instance is but one of many\n famous gay activists who were in  touch with NAMBLA, \nthe North American Man Boy Love Association. \n\nHay went as far as to publicly support Nambla while parading in a Gay Pride \non the streets,\nthus effectively mediatizing a link between gays and paedophiles.\n Pictures of this are easily found on the internet.\n\nIt is important to elaborate some more on this paedo association\nand link, and before doing so, let me explain why;\n\nI am not a religious bigot trying to discredit gays and vociferating that\nthey are paedophiles.\nI know very well that the 'archetypical' gay man,\nthe  ' gay bottom',\ndreams of REAL MEN, grown, mature virile men NOT of children.\n\nIt is however an unfortunate fact of life that many of the leaders of gay\nactivism appear to have had little qualms about paedophilia,\nor associating with paedophiles, either tacitly or explicitly condoning it  \nor worse,  engaging in it themselves.\n\nIt is crucial to make the distinction between true paedophilia, and\nattraction to underage but sexually mature boys;\nit is generally agreed that the range of paedophile interest extends to\nchildren up to age 13 at the most. They must be prepubescent.\n\nWhile such actual, fullblown paedophilia with sexually unmatured kids\nhas without a doubt been rare among gay activists,\nmany instances can be found of sexual relations with adolescents.\n(Even Harvey Milk for instance, Hirshfeld, but really too many to mention).\n\nThe link between gay activism and fullblown paedophiles however DOES\nexist, through people like Vern Bullough, \npublisher of Paidika and activist for Nambla, and through Alfred Kinsey \nwhose criminal work with paedophiles is\nnot only well-documented today, but openly admitted in his landmark\nbook on Male Sexuality.\n\nNot only were extensive paedophile experiments on toddlers as young\nas 6 months old reported in tables in the pages of Kinsey's work,\nthere are also explicit passages such as the following:\n\n'Better data on preadolescent climax come from the histories of adult males\nwho have had sexual contacts with younger boys and who, with their adult\nbackgrounds, are able to recognize and interpret the boys\u2019 experiences.\nUnfortunately, not all of the subjects with such contacts in their histories\nwere questioned on this point of preadolescent reactions; but 9 of our adult\nmale subjects have observed such orgasm. Some of these adults are\ntechnically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records, which\nhave been put at our disposal; and from them we have secured information\non 317 preadolescents who were either observed in self-masturbation, or\nwho were observed in contacts with other boys or older adults.2\nKinsey, et al, Sexual Behavior of the Human Male, 1948\"\n\nIt is therefore important to realize that if today many people resent\ngays on the basis of the dark spectre of child molestation,\nthey aren't being irrationally 'phobic' and 'hateful':\nthis link simply DOES EXIST, and has been put out by gay activists\nTHEMSELVES.\n\nUntil significant numbers of gays cleanse this Paedophile Smear by\nexposing and rejecting the people who have usurped their positions\nas spokesmen for all gays, they will carry that smear themselves,\nand NOT because of straight bigotry, or some 'irrational phobia'...\ufeff",
