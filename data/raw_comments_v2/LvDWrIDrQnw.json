We have police officers who are friends and hang out with \nconvicted pedophiles, police officers who are not fully educated. i was \ntold this the first encounter i had with the police: We can be real dicks \nif we want to, and take your drivers license away if you don't start \nhelping us, and by helping us they mean rat out all the people i know who \nsmoke weed. I have never been stopped due to high speed i don't even have \none parking ticket under my belt, now i am left in a small town with little \nto no jobs available and no car to get to work because i chose to not rat \nout my friends and i only have a contract until this summer is over its \ngonna get hard to get work in the future but i refuse to have a person in a \nuniform thinking he can control my life, give me the fine and leave me \nalone .... in Norway police officers are not allowed to carry guns, but il \ntell you this... if they cant shot you and kill you or beat you up, just \nbecause they don't like you, they WILL make your life as shitty as they can \nand take away as much as they can until you are left with nothing... To \nhave so much responsibility as a police officer does is a hard task and i \nknow i could not do this myself... its to easy to become a cop... If all \ncops had to wear a personal video camera and the video they captured was \nthe evidence and not just what the police said, we would not have this \nproblem with the \"he said, she said bull****\" and a very important note: \nOfc not all cops/humans are bad... But its obvious that we have no idea who \nthe good guys are and who the bad guys are... we need a new better system \ncus this shit got out of hand years ago... people who had a hard time in \nschool or otherwise had a hard time growing up has a harder time \ncontrolling them self when they are presented with so much potential power \nto control others. i sucks to be exiled and forced to just sit inside and \nrot because someone with power does not like you because of what you do in \nyour own home. although i would love to be as productive as society wants \nme to be im afraid that i wont be able to do so in the future... and its \nnot because i choose to sit inside and not do anything, its because of \ncorrupted police officers who love the feeling of being in control.....",

After all, in many \nareas cops know that if they aren't careful they could very easily get dead \nand so learn to be a thug first and ask questions later (this has some \ndisturbing parallels with the My Lai incident in the Vietnam war). \nRemember, they may have dependents who will be a lot worse off if they get \nkilled in the line of duty and nobody wants to get killed doing their job \nfor a wage that, lets be honest here, is barely worth that kind of risk no \nmatter how much of an idealist one may be. I'm not defending bad police and \nbad policing practices but they can't all be complete 'psychos' and the \nones that are probably have a reason (most likely to do with the extreme \npressure of the job and having to daily see the worst of human nature) \nbut nobody is born 'bad'. One thing I would like to know is what the \nprocedure is in the US when a cop shoots and kills or wounds a civvy. Here \nin the UK the officer in question is disarmed and arrested by their partner \nor another colleague and is suspended pending a full investigation and is \npretty much treated as guilty of murder/assault until cleared of any \nwrongdoing. I've had a few run ins with the law myself here in the UK and \nevery time I've been decently treated with respect but then I've given \nrespect so I earned it even when the cops in question thought I'd beat my \nnow ex wife (which I didn't btw, we argued a lot and she tried to beat me \nand wind me up so I would snap and I wouldn't take the bait. Turns out she \nwas bipolar or something) The only time a cop has ever yelled at me was \nwhen our old neighbour had a breakdown and was wandering the street with a \nshotgun and I, being oblivious to all this thanks to my MP3 player, walked \nout of the driveway and into a stand off between a firearms team and the \nneighbour who ended up shooting himself in the head (he actually survived \nthe attempt to blow his own head off and I got over the shock of being \ncharged by a load of bulky guys with big guns. Kinda funny when I think of \nit) Lastly, you Americans will live in an often violent society with guns \neverywhere but you won't do anything meaningful about it so really, don't \ncomplain too much ok, it makes you look whiny and dumb.\ufeff",
