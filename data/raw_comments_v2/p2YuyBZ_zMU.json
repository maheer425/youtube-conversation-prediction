Just remember hammer stance \noffers protection, you need to know that to combat his issues. However, \nganking is great. Ideally, you want to poke, grab the speed up, then \nproceed to \"To the Skies\" the enemy and knock them towards whoever you're \nganking. His chasing is great, and his versatile kit, 2 CC abilities, and a \nspeed up to get your and your gankee out of the action make him an \nexcellent jungler if played correctly.",
