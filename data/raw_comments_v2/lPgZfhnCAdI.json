I'd \nlove to ask old AL GORE how that Arctic Circle melting is going? Or why is \nit that the Antarctic is colder (average mean temperature and the ice layer \ndeeper and wider then ever)? And I'd like to tell him that those gigantic \nice breaks is a normal \"calving\" of the perimeter because as the ice grows \noutwardly it becomes heavy and cannot hold itself together and so \nbreaking apart [ IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE ]!! Or what happened to all of \nthose glaciers melting into nothingness (glaciers have grown and shrunk \nforever)? Then I'd like to ask him how all of his homes are doing? Are they \nstaying warm in the brutal winters? How about your jet Al baby? Are you \nable to keep it fueled with that evil stuff so you can fly around the \nplanet stealing money? I would then tell him he needs to study the \"Pacific \nDecadel Oscillation\" for a while and learn about the effect on climate it \nhas on the Northern Hemisphere   ;)   Then I would introduce him to Mr. \nJohn Coleman as a rebuttal to all of those \"scientist's\" who claim the \nworld is ending thanks to mankind.

Global warming is a theory... he is \nsimply saying that if one of the key factors is absent maybe they should \nretool it with it in mind.. and btw for those of you who dont know its \nactually called Climate change.. and is a cycle that happens, will happen, \nand HAS BEEN HAPPENING since the inception of Time itself... is Stockman \ncorrect in assuming that he has disproved the theory of global warming? \nno... are you serious?... there was plenty of evidence to suggest that \nCLIMATE CHANGE had been occurring well before Al Gore told us his \nInconvenient Truth. I live in Canada.. most people who havent been here \nknow us for our hockey players being better than yours... our beer being \nbetter than yours.. and lastly our Polar bears walk us to school.. it is \nreasonably chilly most of the year. summer it does get warm not like hot \nbut warm around 35C is usually the average after June (figure that out non \nmetric users hahaha) and i actually feel we are getting colder.. we had a \nrelatively warm period a couple years back but for most of the time i feel \nquite chilly. this is of course M.O.O (My Opinion Only) and since i was a \nlittle feller i liked to argue.. Still do cept' most times i like a solid \nintellectual debate over who's fart was the loudest. tell me your opinions \nand try and add facts (and a hearty Eh to all fellow Canucks wherever ye \nmay be)\ufeff",

I've heard reports that range anywhere \nfrom 3 to 300 feet. I honestly don't know which is accurate but suffice it \nto say, that it really does not matter. Even the best case scenario of 3 \nfeet would still be considered catastrophic. Think about it, there are \ncities around the globe that are highly prone to flooding when hurricanes \nhappen. IE: New Orleans. Other places like Holland, have huge dams to keep \nthe ocean back. Now New Orleans has devices to measure the oceans rise and \nfall to within a quarter of an inch. If they feel that such a small amount \nof change is worthy of measuring, imagine what 3 feet would mean to them.\nApproximately eighty to ninety percent of the worlds population live by the \nworlds oceans I believe. Were the ocean to rise to catastrophic levels, it \nwould not happen in a heart beat but very quickly all the same. As a \nresult, there would be over an extremely short time frame, a mass exodus \ninland into other cities ill equipped to handle the sudden influx. Mass \neconomic turmoil, food, medical, and housing crises would be the immediate \nresult. With more pain to follow.\n\n\n2. Even if the south pole did not exist and we only had to concern \nourselves with the melting of the north pole there would still be world \nwide climatic consequences. How? Were that ice to melt it would affect the \npath of the worlds ocean conveyor. \u201cWhat's that?\u201d you might be asking. Well \nyou've no doubt heard of the jet stream. The ocean conveyor is the oceans \nversion of the jet stream. And it is this conveyor that actually determines \nhow the jet stream behaves. The effects of the ice melting are already \nbeing felt. As one example, look at tornado alley in the United States. \nWith each passing year the size of it is increasing. It's beginning further \nsouth and stretching further north. Wider to the east and west too. Not \nonly that but it's starting earlier in the season and running later too. \nThe number of tornadoes reported has increased as well as there sizes and \nwind speeds and even how many are touching down at the same time.\ufeff",
