And 40% is even the \"worse\" of the two \nsamples, the other had 50%muscle tissue. All that, together with bone(which \nbtw is not unhealthy) results in a nugget that is pretty much 100% chicken, \nexcluding the crust(which is bread). Chemical preservatives are also in \nthere but make up a tiny fraction of the actual nugget.\n\nChicken McNuggets might not be the healthiest food due to the way they are \ncoated in bread and fried in oil, but they are not as bad as people like to \nbelieve. McDonalds actually has pretty decent quality standards, they have \nto as a company of that scale. They use a lot of offal from chicken \nproduction, but that isn't really a bad thing. Many parts of the chicken \naren't popular despite not being unhealthy, so when you mash them into one \nthing and people enjoy it, it's actually a good way of using resources more \nefficiently.",
