I know, \neasiest way is to go to a pet hospice, but lately I met a cat, which is \nwandering around my block. She's extremly friendly, so I'm concerned about \nher safety, so if noone will adopt her, I'm going to bring her to hospice. \nBut what I was going to ask is what can I do for cat to make her removal \nleast stressfull? I know, there's no way to avoid putting a cat into a \ntransporter and simply move it in another place. But are there any ways to \nmake it most easy for an animal? And almost the same thing: when I got the \napartament, is there any way to make it for cat as friendly ass possible \nbefore I bring him or her home? I mean, I watched your movies, so I'm aware \nof things like litterboxes, cat trees, cat shelters. Is there something I \ncan do before I take a cat from a hospice? I thought of bringing a cat some \nsmall toys and leaving them in a hospice with the cat for let's say a day. \nAnd then taking a cat home and spreading toys around the place so cat can \nsmell her or his own scent. I'm not sure if I'm thinking right, or maby is \nthere any better ways (I bet, there are).\nStay awesome,\nKrolewna.\nP.s. I'm so sorry if my english is hard to understand, it's not my \nlanguage, but I'm still learning.\ufeff",
