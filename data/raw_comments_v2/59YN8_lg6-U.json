            "text": "There is a very simple way to describe color to blind people. It is simply \nthe characteristic of light in the same way pitch is the characteristic of \nsound. Just as sound repeats its characteristic in octaves, so too can you \ndescribe the spectrum of color as an octave. It starts at red and rises to \nultra violet where it just about repeats itself in a higher octave of red. \nBlind people can't \"see\" this but there surely can conceptualize it using \nsound as a comparison.\n\nNot coincidentally, there are 7 degrees in an octave (tonic, super tonic, \nmediant, sub mediant, sub dominant, dominant, sub mediant, and leading \ntone) just like there are 7 colors in the spectrum: red orange yellow blue \ngreen indigo violet. The three primary notes of a chord (the 1st, third, \nand fifth degree) also constitute the primary colors of light: red (1st) \nyellow (third) and blue (fifth) which are also the first three prime number \nin mathematics: 1,3,5.\n\nMost non-musicians don't know this but the pitch or frequency of a sound is \nnot just \"how high\" or \"low\" it is; there is a *characteristic* of that \nsound even more primordial than the pitch. The frequency IS the \ncharacteristic.  A \"G\" always sounds like a \"G\" and has a very distinct \ncharacteristic to it regardless of which octave it repeats on. Awareness of \nthis characteristic is what enables \"perfect pitch\" or the ability to hear \nsound and know instantly what pitch it is. It is as simple as seeing Red. \nYou would never confuse Red with Blue.\n\nLastly, blind people DO have the capacity to visually conceptualize using \nthe mind. They can't NOT. Because the pineal gland itself is constructed \nout of rods and cones just like an eye. It is literally the \"third eye\". If \nthey can conceive of space, they are visualizing.\ufeff",

Thanks to \ntechnology, amputees can beat Olympic Sprinting records, and Cochlear \nImplants allow the deaf to hear music. But where the heck are \ncyber-eyeballs for the blind already?\nWe may now have them. A device called the BrainPort is a sixth sense for \nthe blind, translating images from a video camera to electrical impulses \nthat are transmitted via the tongue to the brain of a blind person.\nThe test patient is Roger Behm, a man who lost his sight at the age of \nsixteen when an inherited disease destroyed his retinas and they had to be \nsurgically removed. Now, thanks to the Brainport, he can slip a device over \nhis head and see \u2014 albeit in black and white \u2014 nearly as well as a sighted \nperson, and all through his mouth.\nThe device, which consists of a miniature camera mounted on a pair of \nsunglasses, a tongue sensor and a small control unit, was developed by \nWicab of Middleton. The science behind it is in the brain\u2019s remarkable \nability to reprogram itself to accept and use different sensory signals if \none is removed.\nIt\u2019s incredible technology: Erik Weinhenmayer, another blind man, climbed \nMount Everest a few years ago using the Brainport. As a sighted man, my \nonly regret is the technology can\u2019t be adapted to work on senses the brain \ndoesn\u2019t already have: I\u2019d love to install a sixth sensory module into my \ntongue just the way the blind can install the Brainport.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Erik The problem with metaphors: They easily seem to explain all the \nproperties of things, but in fact they're not true.\n\nFirst: You can order colors in Circles (HSB). Okay you kann do that with an \noctave too, but, in fact, the start and the end of an octave doesn't fit \ntogether, but with colors, you can really do infinite loops and always get \nall the colors and always get the same colors. With tones, you only can \nmake a spiral, in which same tones in different octaves are above each \nother. So in your metaphor, you forget, that there is a peak of the \nreceptors for blue light, with the highest frequency, near by the red \nlight, the lowest frequency, so that we can see violet, which is the \nreason, why we can draw all the colors in a circle.\n\nSecond: If you mix two or three tones together, you get a interval or a \nchord and you would never say, it's a single tone. If you mix two or three \ncolors together, you get a new single color, like a single tone.\n\nThird: You might have heard of the absolute pitch in music. Musicians are \nable to train their ear, that they can imagine, how it is like, to have it. \nFor example do I recognize some notes by their frequency, because I know \nsome pieces, that start with the tone. So if I hear the tone (doesn't work \nevery time), sometimes that reminds me of a piece, that I have played in \nthe past. So you can hardly hear, what tone it really is, but you can \nalways say \"that is blue\" or \"that is red\". It's the absolute pitch of the \neyes. It's like you would immidiately know \"this is c' \" or \"this is a'' \". \nAnd now a question concerning you methaphor: Do you really recognize a \ncharacter of a tone? If I would play an a on the piano and then an e, could \nyou really say \"hey, this a seems cold to me, but this e not\"? And even if \nyou could, most people in the world couldn't, they probably would say, the \ntones have an equal character, they are just higher or lower from each \nother. They could only figure out the RELATION between tones, not the \nABSOLUTE tone. \nTherefore I'm surprised, that you wrote that, because never in my life, I \nwould hear the character of different tones so clearly like the character \nof different colors.\n\nConclusion: Just because they are both waves or vibrations (light isn't a \nvibration, because every vibration needs a medium, that vibrates), you \ncan't compare them. It's like I would lay some meat on my arm and some meat \non my tongue and then compare it. That makes no sense.\n\n(Sorry, if there are mistakes in my text, I'm not used to write long texts \nin English).",

            "text": "Light is like sound. Both are waves, and of each we perceive both their \namplitude (their \"quantity\") and their wavelength (their \"quality\"). \nBrightness corresponds to volume and color corresponds to pitch. You can \nsense the brightness of light even as a blind person, it's what you feel on \nyour skin when you're standing in full sunlight as opposed to shade. That \nis to light what volume is to sound. Now, as you can't explain pitch from \nvolume, you can't explain color from brightness, it is simply that other, \nindependent, second trait of the wave, that second information.\n\nA more subtle aspect that also applies to both, the perception of all these \ntraits of the information-mediating wave (light or sound) is being \nmodulated against the spatial and temporal background. This simply means \nthat, just like when you hear the same sound among/after lower-pitched \nsounds it sounds higher-pitched and vice versa, or among/after quieter \nsounds it sounds louder and vice versa, the same applies to the perception \nof light, seeing people see images among/after brighter images darker and \nvice versa, or among/after prevalently differently colored images in other \ncolors. \n\nAnother funny note for you, seeing people aren't aware of color being a \none-dimensional quality as we all are aware of pitch. They can learn it \nabstractly, but never really internalize that all the different \"colors\" \nthey perceive rest on one line. Even when nature spreads the colors out in \nfront of them in their natural order, it will appear to them as a somewhat \narbitrary array, it's not giving the impression of order one gets hearing a \ntone continuously increasing/decreasing its pitch. That's why they \nintuitively disagree with the pitch-color analogy, even though it's \nperfectly well-grounded both in physics and neurobiology.\nThe reason for this perceptive difference stems from the physiological \nspecifics of these two senses, that is where the analogy ends. \n\nMaybe this makes sense to you? :\\\ufeff",
