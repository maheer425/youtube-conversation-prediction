IF mankind had not been created but the rest of \nnature had. would we see any of the unnatural disruptions to the global \necological footprint on earth?\n\nNo.  We as a society are more than ready to be shocked, get angry and get \nvocal about what we see, and blame others or try and demean the whole \natrocity by 'technicalities' such as verbage or not liking that someone \n'used profanity' for a profane situation.  We are Killing 'the world' vs. \nkilling the living aspects of the world and rebranding it with our \npolluting presence by our stupidity, short sightedness, and indifference.\n\nHumanities goal seems to be to consume, & not replenish - Pollute and not \nclean up after ourselves.\n\nWE are the problem. Not Jim or Jane or the Jones down the street.\n\nWE need to start being honest with ourselves, educate ourselves & our \nchildren about what we are doing, and not be afraid to start trying to be a \npart of the resolution rather than the problem.  \n\nWE need to step up, and stop being 'too good' to pick up our neighbors \ngarbage which they chose to 'forgot' to pick up.\n\nWE need to be more proactive in our recycling attempts as an individual, as \na community, AND as a society.\n\nWE need to consider if there are other ways to avoid that extra packaging \nwhen we are going through fast food lineups - because there is. Bring your \nown darn dishes and insist they use them. If course if you are too cool for \nthat... I am sure the birds will get it...\n\nWE need to THINK about what we toss in our garbage, leave on the \nground, and purchase from our stores.\n\nWE need to understand that if if the packaging of what we consume \nis environmentally distasteful, that it's in our power to pick up the \npackage, find the contact information of that company (its always there) \nand contact them  and take them to task - ask WHY they are selling their \nproduct to us in a way that is distasteful to the environment & creates \nwaste. we have a right to ask them to improve their standards.  the more \npeople that do - the sooner they will hear us.\n\nWE are indeed the problem, and this video simply shows us the small picture \nof humanities short sightedness & the price that nature pays THOUSANDS of \nmiles away from civilization.\n\nThe reality is this! All our finger pointing. All our wasting time about \narguing profanity, and verbage, and blames, mean nothing to the MILLIONS of \nvictims every year who cannot speak to defend themselves.\n\nSomeone has taken the time to show us the errors of our ways - now we \neither continue as we have been  and choose to walk in denial until the day \ncomes that we walk here no more along with ecology that we've murdered OR \nwe start taking on a different attitude and try to make a difference one \nperson at a time.\n\nSo the question is simple. Are you going to continue to be part of the \nproblem, or are you going to work on trying to be part of the solution \nwhich requires your commitment and putting yourself out to make a \ndifference.\ufeff",
