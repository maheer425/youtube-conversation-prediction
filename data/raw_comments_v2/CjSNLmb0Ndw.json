He \ndisagreed with Jor, but he had respect for him. Jor didn't knw if he would \nkill the earthians, he only knew that he wanted to rebuild krypton. Sure it \nwouldn't be a bad idea to ask him for advice, but i doubt the advice would \nhave been \"phantom-zone them without warning or any negotiation\"\n2. It was clearly explained in the movie that this sucked because of \ninterference between two phantom drives. Later Zod's men(and women) \nactivated their own phantom drive to connect with world engine, but at this \npoint phantom drive was clearly inactive, so this wouldn't have worked.\ufeff",
