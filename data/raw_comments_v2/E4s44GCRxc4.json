I \nusually play soccer but I was told that I was quick runner for a soccer \nplayer that I should try out track & field. So, as soon as I could I joined \ntrack & field in my high school Elmont. I wasn't the fastest guy in my \nschool but I was in the top3 fast runners. So after afew practices @my \nschool, we had our first match! 5 diff. high schools where also in the \nrace. There were mad ppl that day, it was pack! I never been in these \nrunning competition so I didn't knew what to expect from these games. There \nwere families & friends supporting the racers.\nI was in a one-piece suit. It was uncomfortable & annoying & tight. There \nwere alot of hot girls, sexy girls & beautiful girls, they were so \nattracting that my eyes just kept staring! Thats when I realized I was \ngrowing a boner!!!!! It wasn't that long when I realized my race was coming \n& I had to get ready to race. I was assigned 6 races that day. These races \ntakes an entire day. Its about 10hrs of competition. Bout 657 dudes were \nracing. So yeah! I ended up telling my coach that I was beginning to feel \nsick. That day I had a boner problem & my races were canceled. I had a \nbulged just staring at the girls around! I became friends with two of them \nbut after that day, I never saw them again! The End. \ufeff",
