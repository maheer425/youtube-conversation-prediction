Those oil \ncompanies only pay about 19% in taxes as it is.  far less then any working \nor small business person AND on average large corporations only pay around \n23% and both of them get tax write offs for the amount of cars and price of \nhomes they buy in their personal life.  So if some one stood up to large \ncorporations and forced them to finally pitch in for a change I'm all for \nthat.  They all live to high on the hog and get asked way to little as it \nis and most have their money in outside banks so they don't have to pay \ntaxes here at all.\n\nOn average the working family pays 47% tax, some states more and the \naverage small business only gets tax cuts on what they buy in bulk and \ntheir personal lives get no break at all. \n\nIf anything you just showed me that what Clinton said was untrue that \nforcing the megarich to pay taxes they where previously allowed breaks on \ndon't do any good, in fact they do better.\n\nAnd don't bring the Bushes up to me man, in no way do they have any right \nto take credit for any thing.
