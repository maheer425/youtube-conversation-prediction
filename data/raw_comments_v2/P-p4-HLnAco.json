            "text": "The Haw Flakes are made from Chinese Hawthorn. The mass-produced candies \ncould have also been made with flavouring, so don't quote me on anything. I \nremember it to be very popular among kids maybe a decade ago. They can \nstill be found now, and I still like them. But it's recognised as more of a \n\"childhood candy\".\n\nI don't think I've eaten those squid chips before. Then again, I don't go \naround testing all the chips we have.\n\nI also have no idea what red melon seeds are.\n\nChicken satay is very popular. If I'm not wrong, lamb satay is also very \npopular, but I prefer chicken as it's usually more tender. You could \nprobably find pork and beef as well, if you find hard enough. But usually \nthey'll avoid selling those two as pork and beef go against the religion of \nMalays and Indians respectively. It's then grilled and served in that epic \nsauce. That sauce is amazing. Usually, satay is also served with pressed \nrice cakes (just google \"satay pressed rice cake\"), cucumber, and onion \npieces on the side.\n\nIt would have probably been hard to find tasty Singaporean food without \nthem coming to Singapore personally, since most of the popularly recognised \n\"Singaporean food\" are rice, noodle, or soup dishes.\n\nPeople who go \"This isn't Singapore food! This is *_* food!\" need to \nrealise that Singapore is formed by immigrants of many different places. \nThere are people from cultures all over the world, especially neighbouring \ncountries. Malaysian food, Indonesian food, Chinese food, etc. Technically, \nyou could consider all Singaporean food to be food of other countries. Grow \nup and stop arguing.\ufeff",
