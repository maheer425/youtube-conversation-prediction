I am \na Chinese and I find the words \"language\" and \"dialect\" differ between \nEnglish and Chinese because *these meanings of words were matched like a \njigsaw by early bi-dialects to form a translation, and they may not be \ntotally accurate.*\n\n*- more below -*\n\nIn Chinese, \"\u8a9e\u8a00\" means spoken language, \"\u8a9e\" means speech or language and \n\"\u8a00\" means words spoken. \"\u8a9e\u6587\" means written language. \"\u82f1\"(ying) is the name \nwe gave Britain. Therefore, \"\u82f1\u8a9e\" and \"\u82f1\u6587\" are not totally equal, meaning \nspoken English and written English.\n\n\"\u5730\u65b9\" means place, \"\u65b9\u8a00\" means dialect in English, or in literal Chinese, can \nbe interpreted as \"spoken language spoken by minorities or smaller places\". \nTherefore, it's not the same system of the westerns as we have an universal \nwritten language and different spoken languages.\ufeff",

For example, \nif group A lived in section 1 of an area of the inhabitable world, their \noriginal language would almost certainly have been different from group L \nwho lived in section 204, thousands of miles away from group A, who may or \nmay not have begun using their own language around the same time.

So having more languages goes against the very purpose of the \nlanguage itself.\n\nAnd it seems to me that, because we are now all connected, we are currently \nin the process of unevolving language back to just having a single one... \nwhich is how it's supposed to be.\n\nJust look at how we communicate here on Google+. All of us are coming from \nwidely different places in the world, and yet, we communicate with each \nother using just one language.\n\nHow lovely is that :)\ufeff",
