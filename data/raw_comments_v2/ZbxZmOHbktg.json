The biochemical structure of \nyour brain has changed, your body does not have hunger cues (does not tell \nyou when you're hungry or not hungry anymore), and so recovering from \nanorexia takes reprogramming both mentally and physically. Also, you can't \nput on weight too quickly, it's dangerous after starving for so long. Her \npath to a healthy weight will take time.

A few months before I turned 12, I was moved \nup North, and I practically pigged out of food since there was so much of \nit in my new home. As a result I got really chubby to the point of having a \nbig pot belly, and kids there (who were going through the \"Thin is Utmost \nBeauty\" trend) would bully me relentlessly for being a fat pig. I then had \nan appendix operation when I was thirteen and I lost a lot of pounds \nbecause of it, seeing as it hurt too much to even breathe let alone eat. At \nfourteen, I gained back some of the weight I lost and have a muffin top \n(nothing too bad, average) and the girls at my school were BONE THIN (or \nattempting to) and it just horrified me. Who would want to be this thin in \nthe first place?? Why starve in order to reach the Photoshopped standards \nin magazines? Then came along age 14, when I was in my last year of middle \nschool. Thin was the new beauty, and compared to the other 14 year olds, I \nlooked overweight by comparison. My Old school offered no help for eating \ndisorders, and wherever I went I became severely self conscious of how I \nlooked, and during the wintyr break I had started cutting back and tried \neating salad, tons of it because I knew that if you ate too little your \nbody just clung onto the fat longer. I admit, I have a chubby baby face, \nand when I hold my head straight and tall, the extra baby fat pushed back \nand made me look like I had a double chin, so I started slouching, keeping \nmy head low and if I had to look up, I'd tilt it like a puppy, that way the \nfat wasn't s noticeably. The problem with this was that my head is \npermanently fixated like this, for when I rightened up my head I felt off \nbalance and dizzy. Now I am at my old school, where everyone is average \nsized or a chunky, and I feel almost completely better, There is always one \nreminder though, of my previous life when there wasn't enough food-my \nwrists are near-bone thin, and I am ashamed of them. Back then, I didn't \nchoose to be skinny, and I was stuck with these wrists that belonged to a \neight year old while having hands that looked ginormous because of it.\ufeff",

See food as FUEL, because that's what it is. The food fuels \nyour body so it's best to eat food that suits your body so that you feel on \ntop. \n\nI eat a lot of garbage, chips, pancakes almost every day with whipped soy \ncream etc. But it's all vegan, so it's much much healthier. Milk from \nanimals is made for the baby to GROW, that's why people gain so much weight \nfrom it. milk is for babies. \n\nYour stomach can tell you when you should stop eating in two ways: either \nit has expanded so much that it knows you have had enough food, OR it has \nbeen filled with enough calories/''nutrition'' so that it tells you it \ndoesn't need any more. you could have a half empty stomach with oils and \nother unhealthy things, or you can have a full stomach with spinach and \nfruit which will make you so happy and energetic.\n\nI'm not saying you should focus on losing weight, I'm saying you should \nfocus on what makes you feel the best physically, mentally and emotionally. \nI realized this is a lot of text so if you're interested you can please \nsend me a message or we can just talk in the comments. good luck and happy \nbirthday :)",
