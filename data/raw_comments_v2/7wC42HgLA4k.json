I already know what the EC is/does.\n\n*Secondly, the office of the President is NOT intended to be directly \nrepresentative of the people.*\n\nThat's funny, because that tends to be the running theme for every \npolitician since Day 1 here.\n\nIf the President isn't elected to represent the people, why the fuck do we \neven bother electing them?\n\n*It is intended to represent the collective mood of the states. Therefore, \nthe the President is and should be elected by the states and not directly \nby the people.*\n\nThis is absolute retarded nonsense. What you're saying is that the National \ngovernments are merely representative of the State governments, and so \nshould be elected by the States.\n\nThat's just government electing government to control government.\n\nIf this is the case, the people's vote *means absolutely NOTHING.*\n\nWe cast our ballots only to freely hand over any political power we have to \nthe State level governments, which in turn control the national \ngovernments, which in turn control the State governments.\n\nThat is the DEFINITION of a patently absurd clusterfuck of a system.\n\nIt negates the power of the people and pretty much defeats the entire \npurpose of having a \"democracy for the people, by the people\" in the first \nplace.\n\nYou're basically saying all that \"you have a voice\" bull shit is nothing \nbut an empty sales pitch to keep the masses duped into being oblivious to \nthe fact that they're getting a big red, white & blue dick shoved up their \nass.\n\n*It is intended to represent the collective mood of the states.*\n\nBut it *DOESN'T DO THAT.*\n\nIf 50.99% of all States vote Republican, then the Republican candidate gets \nelected unanimously, because *ALL* EC votes will be Republican.\n\n49.01% of the country DID NOT WANT THIS. The fucking EC ignores half the \ncountry's voices.\n\nHow the actual fuck is this representing the States as  \"collective?!\" It's \nnot even a majority!\n\nIn some cases, it even overturns them:\n\nIn 2001, Al Gore received 543,895 *more votes* than Bush in the people's \nvote. But since Bush won States with the most Electors, the EC vote \nresulted in him beating Gore 271 - 266.\n\nHalf a million more people wanted a Democratic President than a Republican. \nAnd yet because of this broke ass backwards system we have in place, \npolitical agendas trump the people's wishes. Again.\n\n*Therefore, the the President is and should be elected by the states and \nnot directly by the people.*\n\nThe President is not elected to government to represent State governments. \nThe President is elected to represent the NATION as a whole, and that \nincludes it's citizens.\n\nThe people who have to live average lives in this county know better than \nanyone what it needs.\n\nThe people should be the ONLY ONES who have a say in leadership for this \ncountry.\n\n*The electoral college helps to preserve the federal character of the \nnation by giving each state a voice.*\n\nWhile at the same time silencing the people's voices and diminishing any \nflicker of the common people actually having a say in how their government \ncomports itself.\n\n*The EC ensures that the winning candidate has a broad distribution of \nsupport nationwide rather than having all support concentrated in densely \npopulated coastal urban areas.*\n\nAt the expense of the people's voice, of course.\n\nI fail to see how/why this would even be a problem. If you eliminate the EC \naspect of the process, people will still cast votes the same as they always \nhave, both in metropolitan and rural areas.\n\nThe votes are tallied and a winner declared.\n\nWe no longer live in a time where candidates are limited by distance to \nspread their message. Candidates can campaign from one state and broadcast \ntheir messages nationwide via radio, television, Internet, etc.\n\n*The EC protects and enhances state and regional interests as well as \nminority interests.*\n\nOnce more, it is not the State's interests that should be considered. It is \nthe PEOPLE'S.\n\nPreserving State interest at the expense of the people's interests is \nelevating both political and governmental agendas over the wishes of the \npeople.\n\nPolitical parties' agendas seldom align with the people's wishes.\n\nPolitical parties have purely political aims, and these aims often do not \nagree with what's best for the people.\n\nAs a whole, the nation suffers from granting too much control over \ngovernment by government. Surely you must see this.\n\n(The circus happening in Indiana right now is a PRIME example.)\n\nThe issue of minorities is completely irrelevant in a non-EC system.\n\nThe EC system guarantees that some people's votes carry more weight than \nothers. If anything, this is MORE of a threat to minorities than a non-EC \nsystem.\n\nIn a straight-forward voting system, every citizen has an equal voice.\n\n\"Minorities\" is only a issue if you're going to view the American people as \na bunch of little in-groups, instead of one nation of citizens.\n\nThat's your problem, and the country shouldn't have to suffer because of \nyour near-sightedness.\n\n*Having a broad distribution of support ensures that a candidate is \npolitically moderate.*\n\nIf you truly think political moderates exists, then you know far less about \npolitics than you've lead me to believe.\n\nStop living in this fantasy world where the political system works like \nsome sort of clockwork machine that never strays from what the Founding \nFathers designed it to do.\n\nThat was 300 fucking years ago.\n\nIt's not 1778 anymore. It's fucking 2015, and both the country's territory \nand population is significantly larger than it was when Jefferson and his \ncronies were jotting down the Constitution.",

A \nrace to win the states with the most Electoral votes.\n\nWhat the common people want does not even enter into the equation, thus \nnegating the people's wishes and reducing the decision process to only \npolitical agendas.\n\nAs long as we have a two-party system, there must and always will be a \nmajority and a minority, unless by some sheer chance, the votes are a dead \ntie at 50/50.\n\nThe point is, both systems operate on the two-party setup, so both \ninevitably must have a minority and majority.\n\nIn a system like this, it is *impossible* to please everyone.\n\nThe general election indicates what the majority of Americans want, and \nthat's the end of it.\n\nTo paraphrase Star Trek, \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the \nfew, or the one.\"",

If Austrian economics was a penis, it would be rock-hard and \nready to perform :)\"\n\nHaha, nice one, bud! I meant a mostly silent response. One example is \nCaplan, who criticized the Austrian school years ago, yet he's still \nrebutted. It was definitely a good critique of the School, but why keep \nrebutting him? Why not move to the other, more prominent ones?\n\n\"I disbelieve in gods and such, but if you don't, that's fine.  Since \nhumans learned about staying put in a place and just farming, we have also \nmade up gods in order to compel others to obey.  Ashur was a god that led \narmies to conquer and slaughter for the Assyrian army.  It's easy to back a \nclaim on authority when you just say that you're speaking on behalf of an \ninvisible, undetectable, incomprehensible being.  Many gods have been the \nendorsers of authority, battles, slavery, empires, and death.  Science is a \ndiscipline that has only recently taken a stronghold in human societies. \n It's no-longer enough to just say that an imaginary being told you that \nyou're in charge.\"\n\nI am an atheist so we've definitely got some common ground here, bud! \nAnyway, I agree, nice historical points.\n\n\"If I tell you that I have authority over you, because some people agree \nthat I have authority over you, I'm not really making a strong case, but \nthat is exactly what our government does.  Skepticism prevents cults from \nrising, which would explain why there are still so many cults... True, \ncritical thinking is on the rise, but with still over 90% of people \nbelieving in various religions, you can see why people are also in passive \nacceptance of some group (government) that claims to have authority over \ntheir lives. \"\n\nI believe this where we begin to disagree. All power is, by definition, \nesoteric & hidden. Governments are just a more literal materialization of \npower. Depending on whatever government you select, it manifests that power \nin different ways, in sometimes unusual ways, and in some case employing \nbizarre methods.\n\n\"If 51 people in a crowd of a hundred vote to rape the 49, most would not \nsay that the rape is justified, but in a democracy, when 51% vote to raise \nthe taxes and the welfare checks that incentives broken homes, we call that \nreasonable and just.  Modern logic and reasoning practices debunk the \nvalidity of democracy as a gateway to authority.\"\n\nThat's fine, bud, and I agree. This is the very reason why we do not have a \ndirect democracy. At this point I pose another question, what system do you \npropose that is immune to the Human Condition?\n\n\"Whenever there is centralized authority, a true skeptic will ask why the \npower to decide the rules of life dwell within a few to cast upon an entire \ngeographical area and the people therein.  A true skeptic will ask why a \nhighly diverse world is given one-size-fits-all commandments to people \nwithin arbitrary lines called borders.  A true skeptic wonders why there \nare commandments against victimless acts, and why acts involving victims \nare believed to be handled most intelligently by a court monopoly rather \nthan decentralized courts and law enforcement.\"\n\nNo True Scotsman. Also, if we're referring specifically to the U.S. \nGovernment, we do not have a \"centralized\" power. We have three branches \nthat routinely check each other, and almost always disagree with the other. \nFor example, The Supreme Court has a pretty decent record the regard of \ndefending people (Gitlow, Wade, and Marbury, ect.), not to say it has a \nperfect record though (Crow).\n\n\"I have a lot more to say, but I need to summarize a few points and return \nto this later.  Monopolies have been shown to perform poorly compared to \nopenly competing operations of the same type.  Time has shown us that \nmonopolies are not so great, but the government holds the monopoly on law \nand, thereby, many other things\"\n\nErr, sorry, bud. Gonna have to call false dichotomy on this one. If we're \ntalking about the Federal government, there is some definite truth to this; \nhowever, there are instances in which the Federal government has been \noverruled and the victory went to people instead (Mapp). Alternatively, \nthere are plenty of cases where the states were trying to do something \nabsurd, and was stopped by the very government you decry (Brown).\n\n\"Authority is a fiction like the false religions of the ages.  There is \nsuch thing as dominance by force, yes, but this differs greatly from \nauthority, which is the generally claim of those who wish to dominate by \nforce. \"\n\nI disagree. I believe power dynamics are very real. Even the implicit one \nwe have right here, is still there regardless of whether or not you wish to \nget away from it. Psychological research also suggests that these dynamics \nin power influence our decisions and how we feel about people. Combine this \nwith the concept that some people would rather follow others, rather than \nlead or have supreme autonomy. Is it wrong for them to desire, and \nsubsequently be grant this? I do not believe so.\n\n\"Most government laws reflect to some extent the prominent religious ideals \nof their people.  Most governments incite a sense of worship through \nritual, stratification, ceremony, patriotism, and propaganda.\"\n\nDo you mind providing citations for your initial claim? Also, I agree with \nthe latter, so you don't need to worry about it; however, it needs to be \nsaid that indoctrination is inherent to people, and, I'm sure you'd agree, \nthat  coercion is normal.\n\n\"1. Monopolies perform poorly compared to competition.  Our existing law \nsystems are so corrupt now that revolt is rapidly on the rise. Competition \nwould solve this and much more.\"\n\nHaha, by the very definition of a monopoly your first claim is false. It is \nthe competition that is completely impeded, that is why it is undesirable. \nI believe there is a bit of a dark area, I'd like to illuminate for you. \nThe states ARE the competition to the federal government. This is no \nsecret, and the local courts debate and fight with higher courts all the \ntime (Johnson, Miranda, ect.). Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose.\n\n\"2. Authority claimants don't have evidence that their authority is \nlegitimate.  Random people that are just like anyone else are claiming \nauthority and the power to make region-sweeping laws without proof of their \nclaims\"\n\nWell, no, due to your very own arbitrary standards. The very thing you \ndecry IS authority, whether or not you agree with said authority is besides \nthe point. If, per chance, you ascribe to a definition of authority \ncommonly accepted amongst academics, you'd agree, but that's fine you do \nnot have too.\n\nI'd also like to add to your last sentence, of the quoted excerpt, and say \nthat I concur; however, those laws (in today's more modern age) definitely \ndo not get passed as readily & easily as they once did. A good example \nwould be Monsanto, and PETA's almost ridiculous assertions, which have yet \nto be passed.\n\n\"3.  Governments operate like a church, which is nice for some, perhaps, \nbut not exactly the best for everyone else.

People do. There is not a single \nsociopolitical or economic theory that DOESN'T indoctrinate people, have \nthem invoke faith, or have some level of control. Even if you created one \nout of thin air, just wait a couple generations after you dream it up. This \nis not \"common religious behavior\" this is common human behavior.\n\nMost men and women would deliberately construct an echo chamber of their \nown ideals, and live in them for all their life (which many do do \nwillingly).

Not everyone wants to be a \ndebater or intellectual, and that's okay.\n\n\"4.Democracy cannot be logically upheld as a means to authority.\"\n\nHaha, you said this already, bud.\n\n\"Looking at these points, it is hard for a skeptic to say that governments \nare the result of our modern knowledge rather than a vestigial remnant of \npre-scientific and superstitious times.

            "text": "Your assertion that Austrian theorists give flaccid responses will need \nmore than adjectives typically used for a penis to convince me.  If \nAustrian economics was a penis, it would be rock-hard and ready to perform \n:)\n\n I feel like you're asking me to fit an elephant into a backpack by asking \nme such a massive question that needs such a massive understanding to fit \nin only a comment, but I will do what I can.\n\nI disbelieve in gods and such, but if you don't, that's fine.  Since humans \nlearned about staying put in a place and just farming, we have also made up \ngods in order to compel others to obey.  Ashur was a god that led armies to \nconquer and slaughter for the Assyrian army.  It's easy to back a claim on \nauthority when you just say that you're speaking on behalf of an invisible, \nundetectable, incomprehensible being.  Many gods have been the endorsers of \nauthority, battles, slavery, empires, and death.  Science is a discipline \nthat has only recently taken a stronghold in human societies.  It's \nno-longer enough to just say that an imaginary being told you that you're \nin charge.\n\nBecause more of us are now are in the practice of exacting evidence for \nclaims, I probably won't get away with stealing and blaming it on invisible \ngoblins.  This really disappoints me.  :(  People around the world are more \nand more concerned with validating claims before accepting them.  \n\nIf I tell you that I have authority over you, because some people agree \nthat I have authority over you, I'm not really making a strong case, but \nthat is exactly what our government does.  Skepticism prevents cults from \nrising, which would explain why there are still so many cults.  People are \ngrowing in skepticism, yes, but have a long way to go.  Most of the world \nstill believes in superstitions, religions, and pseudo sciences of every \nkind.  Most people aren't thinking very critically.  True, critical \nthinking is on the rise, but with still over 90% of people believing in \nvarious religions, you can see why people are also in passive acceptance of \nsome group (government) that claims to have authority over their lives. \n\nIf I say that I have moral authority over you, a would probably have some \nreligious title like a priest or bishop, and I would claim to have divine \nright to impose religious ideals onto your life.  If I outlaw masturbation \nand oral sex, I am claiming to have moral authority over your life and \nothers'.  Your autonomy would be trumped by my religious ideals.  \n\nIf 51 people in a crowd of a hundred vote to rape the 49, most would not \nsay that the rape is justified, but in a democracy, when 51% vote to raise \nthe taxes and the welfare checks that incentivizes broken homes, we call \nthat reasonable and just.  Modern logic and reasoning practices debunk the \nvalidity of democracy as a gateway to authority.\n\nWhenever there is centralized authority, a true skeptic will ask why the \npower to decide the rules of life dwell within a few to cast upon an entire \ngeographical area and the people therein.  A true skeptic will ask why a \nhighly diverse world is given one-size-fits-all commandments to people \nwithin arbitrary lines called borders.  A true skeptic wonders why there \nare commandments against victimless acts, and why acts involving victims \nare believed to be handled most intelligently by a court monopoly rather \nthan decentralized courts and law enforcement.\n\nI have a lot more to say, but I need to summarize a few points and return \nto this later.  Monopolies have been shown to perform poorly compared to \nopenly competing operations of the same type.  Time has shown us that \nmonopolies are not so great, but the government holds the monopoly on law \nand, thereby, many other things.  Authority is a fiction like the false \nreligions of the ages.  There is such thing as dominance by force, yes, but \nthis differs greatly from authority, which is the generally claim of those \nwho wish to dominate by force.  Looking back through history, there is not \na period of time when people gave power over their lives to other people, \nwhile that power was not abused.  History repeatedly teaches that by buying \ninto the claim of authority, there will be suffering.  History has shown \nthat governments expire like fruit.  There's no such thing as a sustainable \ngovernment.  To believe that a government will live on forever is a \ndelusional fallacy made many times throughout history.   Most government \nlaws reflect to some extent the prominent religious ideals of their people. \n Most governments incite a sense of worship through ritual, stratification, \nceremony, patriotism, and propaganda.  \n\n1. Monopolies perform poorly compared to competition.  Our existing law \nsystems are so corrupt now that revolt is rapidly on the rise.  Competition \nwould solve this and much more.\n\n2. Authority claimants don't have evidence that their authority is \nlegitimate.  Random people that are just like anyone else are claiming \nauthority and the power to make region-sweeping laws without proof of their \nclaims\n\n3.  Governments operate like a church, which is nice for some, perhaps, but \nnot exactly the best for everyone else.  Just like in a religion, a \ngovernment believes that its ideals should be embraced by everyone in the \nworld, or at least the regions that they can control, and it forms \nelaborate constructs to indoctrinate people through ritualistic cult \nbehaviors and stories, while backing their motives with force, which is a \nvery common religious behavior.\n\n4.Democracy cannot be logically upheld as a means to authority.\n\nLooking at these points, it is hard for a skeptic to say that governments \nare the result of our modern knowledge rather than a vestigial remnant of \npre-scientific and superstitious times.

An observer of our governments can't in honesty report \nthat they are operating intelligently, objectively, morally, wisely, or \neven just in accordance with contemporary knowledge.  I wish some of these \nthings were more obvious than they apparently are.  It's like I'm \ncommitting blasphemy with some people.  It's like I am desecrating holy \ndomain by pointing out the folly of the ancient government structure. \n We're even using the same failed democracy that was used in ancient Rome, \nwith patricians and senators.

Grey \nfalsely states that the number of of electoral votes each state is given is \ndirectly based on its population. In fact, the number of electoral votes \neach state is entitled to is based on its total representation in Congress \nwhich is based on the population of each state. The number of votes for \neach state start at two, not three. Grey deliberately distorted the \npopulation numbers for the large urban areas by stating that only 20% of \nthe US population live in the 100 largest cities. Grey ignored the fact \nthat these large cities also have surrounding suburbs that are part of \ntheir greater metropolitan areas. In fact, about 50% of the US population \nlive one of the 30 largest metropolitan areas. Grey ignored the whole \nconcept of federalism by saying thats states interests are not important \nenough to elect the President. Grey called the residents of Illinois \n'hoosiers' when in fact 'hoosiers' are residents of Indiana. Grey says the \nElectoral College got it 'wrong' simply because it didn't agree with the \npopular vote. One point of the EC is to avoid a nationwide popularity \ncontest. The EC represents the collective mood of the states, not the \npeople directly. Grey says it is possible for one to win the office of the \nPresident with only 22% of the national vote. That scenario is flawed on so \nmany levels. There is no way in hell that a candidate can win a simple \nmajority of voters in 39 politically and culturally diverse states while \nsimultaneously losing every single voter in the 11 largest states. Think \nabout it. Will Wyoming and Vermont ever vote for the same candidate while \nthat same candidate has offended virtually everyone in Texas, Florida, \nCalifornia and New York. Grey falsely claims that popular election of the \nPresident and winner take all are 'rules' of the EC are in the \nConstitution. In fact, popular election of the President is not in the \nConstitution and neither is the winner take all 'rule'. Need I add more?",

Initially ( and to my \nmind, preferably ) the Senate was the house of the states, with each state \nbeing represented by 2 Senators.  The House represents The People ( and \nshould be much, much bigger with a lower Representative-to-Citizen ratio \n).  The States were individual, sovereign entities who allocated a small \nportion of their power to a Federal government. \n\nThe entire concept behind the US is that the Individual, first and \nforemost, is a sovereign entity who allows a portion of their sovereign \nrights to be vested in a State government for the purposes of maintaining a \ngovernment of their choosing ( but always a Democratically elected one ) to \ndo those things that the citizens of the state deem worth doing in \naccordance with the State's charter.  Those States, then allocate an even \nsmaller portion of THEIR sovereign power to be vested in a Federal \ngovernment for very narrow and well defined purposes stated in the \nConstitution: mutual protection, maintaining fair trade between the states \nand dealing with foreign entanglements. \n\nAll power and rights start and are fully vested IN the Citizen first, then \nto the State and finally to the Federal gov't.
