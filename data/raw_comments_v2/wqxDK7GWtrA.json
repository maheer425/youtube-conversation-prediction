It was a \nHUGE hit! She was getting compliments all night about how awesome her hair \nlooked and when people discovered it was me, people kept telling me how \ngreat of a job I did!\nMoreover, her mom works at a high-end salon. She showed a picture of the \nstyle to her boss and her boss put it in their monthly employee newsletter \nabout how popular braids are!\nIt was all thanks to you! Thank you SOOO MUCH for having hairstyles that \nwork even on very thick hair! (It's the ONLY fancy updo she's ever worn \nthat stayed in all day and all night, even with dancing!)\nBtw, your video taught her how to do the zigzag braid. She did it on me for \nthe same wedding and people thought my hair was adorable! ;)\ufeff",
