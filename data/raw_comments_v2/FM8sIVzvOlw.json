In my eyes this video propagates so many stereotypes that it&#39;s painful. The extremely nerdy guys who have absolutely no self awareness. The fact that they &quot;hail&quot; their club. The fact that they have a &quot;club&quot;. The hot girl that easily manipulates the guys. The hot girl is only there to take advantage of these poor pitiable nerdy guys. It&#39;s just rife with offensive characterizations to me.<br /><br />To me this is a very poor representation of our hobby. I understand this is satire, I understand it is not meant to be representative of our hobby but a charicature based upon stereotypes. The problem in my eyes is that most people out there won&#39;t see this as a caricature but more as representative.<br /><br />A few months ago my Mother-In-Law saw an episode of BBT that showed them playing an RPG. She asked me about my games and asked &quot;Is that what your games are like?&quot; (Note my MIL is a <b>wonderful</b> person and very intelligent). Having not seen the episode, I could only tell her probably not. I went looking for the episode and was glad I gave that answer.<br /><br />It&#39;s gotten easier over the years as RPGs become more mainstream. Will Wheaton does an amazing job of promoting our hobby in a light that isn&#39;t disdainful and stereotypical.<br /><br />This seems to feed off and propagate that stereotype. It makes me sad.<br /><br />Am I the only one?",
