I like that she is bursty and got some \ngood engage/ disengage and awesome poke in lane the problem i got with her \nis that she is played so much better in solo lane. The kit is more for \nherself now. I miss the old Spirit Bond because it firstly  fitted karma \nreally well. The connection between her and friend or enemy. Also it was a \nvery unique and extremely underestimated spell. I also miss some sort of \nhealing for allied champions.
