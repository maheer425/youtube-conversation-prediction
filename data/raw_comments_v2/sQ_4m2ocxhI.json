            "text": "This movie is awesome! I recommend everyone to watch it. Its storyline \n(specially its ending) helps understand how USA's actions in *Russia-occupied \nAfghanistan* contributed to USA's victory in the *cold war* against Russia \nbut, as a side effect, also contributed to the rise of the *Taliban*, which \nlater would become the agent of the *9/11 attacks* and the initial reason \nfor the onset of USA's \"war against terrorism\".\n\nUSA's governmental decision to suppress the last part of its foreign policy \nplan for the Afghanistan is a strong indication that USA *put an end to a \nwar but helped the onset of another one*. Chronologically:\n\n*1*) USA beats Russia in Afghanistan. This puts an end to the \"cold war\".\n\n*2*) Satisfied to have won the \"cold war\", USA doesn't help post-russian \noccupation Afghanistan to recover: no schools are built, no hospitals, no \ndemocratic elections are stimulated, neither the development of a laic \nState and laic Constitution. USA just leaves the territory of a very \nweakened Afghanistan that can't deal with the rising Taliban.\n\n*3*) A while after, Taliban becomes a powerful terrorist group and causes \nthe 9/11 attacks.\n\n*4*) As a late reaction, USA declares war on terrorism.\n\n*Charlie Wilson's War* tells the story from the moment Russia occupies \nAfghanistan until *2* (when USA leaves Afghanistan free from Russia but \nalone, trying to recover from war and deal with its internal problems, \nTaliban included). Very worth watching movie!\ufeff",

Imo, if they did this, this would've \nprobably avoided the 9/11 attacks and also promoted the establishment of a \nUS ally in the Greater Middle East. Terrorism spread all over the Greater \nMiddle East because no one cared about none of these countries until it was \ntoo late to do anything about it.\n\nThe problem was blindness: at the time, the US only cared about defeating \nRussia. They didn't see the bigger picture.\n\nI like how in the final part of this movie you can hear the sound of a jet \nairliner (a clear reference to the 9/11 attacks) right after Gus tells \nCharlie Wilson to listen to what he's telling him:\n\n*watch?v=e2cjVhUrmII&t=2m*",

I'm \nnot so sure though .. perhaps Nichols knew he had an average film on his \nhands with an exceptional actor in the middle of it, and this was his \nsomewhat subversive means of acknowledging as much to the viewer. Either \nway, it was his call. Even if they did go off-script it couldn't have been \nentirely improvised, as it required blocking, different camera and boom \nwork, and a response from the other actor. It's testament to Hoffman's \nabilities that such dimensions would even be considered in a lousy movie.\n\nHe's brilliant in that basketball scene (\"Along Came Polly\".) As great as \nhe was in \"The Master\" or deserving of the Oscar for \"Capote,\" I think I \npreferred him in the supporting roles where he'd show up and relegate the \nstar to the role of mere celebrity.",

I do take some \nexception to your writing that I called Mike Nichols a \"narcissistic \nfilmmaker\". (I'd forgotten Nichols directed it!) I referred in the \naggregate to the \"filmmakers' narcissism\", not to the director alone. And \nyou make the very good point that Nichols left the line in the film. So \nmaybe that was his way of finessing a sophomoric script? It would be \ninteresting to know, wouldn't it, whose idea was it for the coda to that \nscene: Hoffman or Nichols. Either one though, I still bet it wasn't in the \nscript.\n     Yes, Boogie Nights was a very good movie, and Hoffman is almost too \npainful to watch. But then as brutal as that scene was, look at him in \nAlong Came Polly. When was that, ten years ago? I still hear him in my \nhead, tossing up bricks and screaming \"Let it Rain!\" and I laugh at loud, \napropos of nothing.  Yeah, you said it: he ALWAYS delivered the goods.",

And while it's not a very good movie, it's interesting to \nnote that the 'narcissistic filmmaker' in question - Mike Nichols - chose \nto leave the line in the film. But Hoffman seemed to do that with all his \nroles, whether the films were deserving or not. Look at the scene in Boogie \nNights (a good film) where he is rebuffed by Mark Wahlberg and sits crying \nin his car. There's that moment just after he's been on camera when you \nkind of sit in awe thinking \"what was that?\"",

(In \nfact the whole movie is a smug, presumptuous, \nself-congratulatory love-letter to itself, rife with intelligence-insulting \n tripwires.) But Hoffman has overcome the filmmakers narcissism \nby indicating the narcissism in his character, which I doubt was in the \nscript.

I can't criticize one single thing about Hoffman's \nperformance there, but if I had edited it, the window smash would've taken \nonly one heavy blow, and Slattery's flinch would have been perfectly in \ntime with the smash, or JUST late, as the shards flew inward. \n\nNow, I realize that glass can be very resilient.  In fact, a few years ago \nwhen I watched as my condo burned to the ground from the street, I saw my \ncousin try to smash the passenger-side window of his car that was in the \ndriveway because, since he left his keys inside the inferno and we barely \nescaped with our lives, he wanted to put it in neutral and get it to safety \nbefore the burning debris destroyed it too - it took him three or four \nHEAVY \"stabs\" with a 20 pound iron bench-press bar he grabbed from the open \ngarage before it finally shattered.\n\nSo yeah...my only criticism is from the people in post, is what I'm \nsaying.  That was the most epic \"Ratta-tat-tat!\" machine gun fire of an \ninsult, and yet we see an additional unsuccessful attempt at the \"epic \ncool\" window smash, which comes off a little more like \"frustration\" than \nit does \"TOTAL FUCKING BADASS.\"  \n\nGranted, his character is OBVIOUSLY frustrated, but...you know what I \nmean.  If a person were to fantasize about telling off THEIR boss, would it \ntake them THREE hits to smash his window?  Or to knock him out cold with an \nuppercut? \n\nOf course not.\n\nJust one. \n\nRIP, Phillip Seymour Hoffman \n\nHollywood is going to suck quite a bit (more) without the talent he used to \nimprove it.  : /\n\n(Edit: THREE hits - I originally said TWO.  Even worse! Heh heh)",
