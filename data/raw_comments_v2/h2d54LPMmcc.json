What I find works best for me is I will take a \nshower and when my hair is damp but not dripping wet I will braid my whole \nhead just as they did and than sleep with it in and in the morning they \nshould all be dry than before taking out the elastics I will flat iron just \nthe bottom parts that are below the hair tie or little elastic band. Than I \nwill take the band off once all the bottom pieces have been straightened \nand than lightly comb through with my fingers. You can use mouse to \nintensify the effect or use a beach spray or just leave it as it is. I live \nin Hawai'i so using product on my hair doesn't hold very well, neither does \nthe style because of the humidity. Best bet here is to just swim in the \nocean and get the natural sea salt waves, I will usually put a good leave \nin conditioner once I get out of the ocean because I don't like the rough \ntexture I do like the waves I get though. Anyone who tries my method (s) \nplease reply to this comment and tell me how it went! \ufeff",
