They \nmay not understand why they have to run around the poles at a Dog Show, but \nthey do it because their Alpha tells them to -- and for the yummy treats, \njust like cats at a show.

            "text": "Cool. But with my experience I'm going to have to disagree. We used to feed \nmy cat on a schedule and she would throw up all the time because she would \neat the food so fast. I think in her head for whatever reason when we would \nfeed her, that was going to be her last meal ever so she had to get it all \ndown as fast as she could. I even tested her and fed her a half hour after \nher scheduled feeding and she ate all of that up too. So we switched to \nfree feeding and she no longer guzzles the food down or vomits because she \neats to fast. She knows the food is always there and so she only eats when \nshe's hungry. Took her to the vet for an unrelated issue and the vet said \nshe was extremely healthy. There are no behavioral problems at all. So i \nreally think it depends on the cat, the environment and the situation. I \ndon't think it's right to tell someone they're worrying if they're free \nfeeding. Instead you should encourage different methods and stick to what \nworks for your baby. \ufeff",

It said to put their food \nspread out on a shallow dish or I just make sure her food is on a single \nlayer (dry food) so she can't take in as much at once. Doing both of those \nmade her stop. The only time it ever happens now is if she sneaks a bunch \nof her sisters food (who is on special diabetic food).\n\nI would recommend the food bowl set up though. Just an idea.
