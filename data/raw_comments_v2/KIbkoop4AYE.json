The US \"borrows\", i.e. sells Treasury Bonds to \nthe investor world, thru a set of Primary Dealer private banks and \nfinancial institutions, *only* because Congress *requires* that Treasury \nprovide those savings account vehicles for the financial sector, as a *tool* \nfor the financial sector to *operate itself*, including managing to keep \nbase interest rates propped up above zero.\n\nThe US govt \"borrows\" because it is Congress policy that the US *must* \n\"borrow\" from banks and other entities like foreign central banks, not \nbecause it functionally needs to \"get\" US dollars from outside institutions \nwhich *do not create a single US dollar*, merely because this is part of \nthe convoluted methods that Congress has chosen to use to balance the \nglobal financial system which the US dominates.\n\nTaxes do not actually fund spending.  Spending functionally occurs when \nTreasury is authorized by instructions from Congress to issue instructions \nto the Fed to add numbers to the back room reserve accounts of banks, which \nare accounts that exist on the Fed's own computers.  Some mathematical \naddition is performed, then some recipient has a larger checking acct \nbalance, with money that sprang into existence OUTSIDE of the govt based on \nthe lawful powers of Treasury officers to do math.\n\nFor taxes, the private sector issues instructions for the Fed to do \nsubtraction of dollars from the private sector.  That subtraction really \ndoes not give the US govt any \"funds\", at least none that it could not \ncreate without tax collection.\n\nOne way to look at it fundamentally, is Treasury \"borrows\" from the Fed by \neach swapping a kind of note, a routine paper swap like Wall St does daily \nand hourly.  Only Congress insists that the Fed is forbidden to swap paper \ndirectly with Treasury, and must use other private banks to do the paper \nswap.  Even tho these private banks can legally borrow from the Fed or do \nan overdraft, Treasury is forbidden by Congress from doing an overdraft on \nits Fed account.\n\nSo it LOOKS LIKE borrowing to fund federal spending, but it isn't that, not \nanymore, not since the Gold Std debt ceiling was abolished by Nixon in 1972 \nand halfway abolished by FDR in 1933.\ufeff",

Many \npoliticians will speak of \"buckling down and keeping a balanced budget by \nnot raising the debt limit.\" They don't understand that by NOT raising the \ndebt limit, the United States will default on its \"debt\" to the Federal \nReserve (the \"debt\" which i speak of is the very money you have in your \nwallet). HOWEVER, by continuously RAISING the debt limit, we are slowly \ncrippling our monetary supply...it will eventually collapse under its own \nweight as we borrow more and more money to try to pay off the previous \nmoney already borrowed. \n\nThe monetary system of the United States has us all by the balls; it was \nnot designed to be a sustainable system. Our entire economy is one big, \nover-inflated balloon which will keep on inflating until it pops. And when \nthat happens, my friend, shit is going to hit the fan...HARD.",

I believe that some regulation is immensely \nbeneficial, especially in regards to the aforementioned monopolization of \nmarkets, which is the literal corruption of any Capitalist economy.\n\nRegardless of these good intentions, the most influential interest groups \nsuch as arms manufacturers, banking, and insurance companies, are able to \ntake advantage of an overly generous system of bailouts and tax breaks.\n\nThe distinction I am forced to make coincides with the definition of \n\"Utopian Capitalism\" and the establishment thereof. \"Utopia,\" as a \npolitical system, is often misconstrued as the 'perfect world,' while, in \nfact, its original meaning was 'the world that cannot exist.' I maintain \nthat this Darwinistic, evolving economy you propose cannot come to fruition \nwithin the confines of human nature. People resist. They are stubborn. The \nsame industrialists who exploit the current system are more likely to \npreserve their own lucrative existence than submit to a fully equalized \nsystem. Such efforts could very well manifest themselves as political \naction and even the implementation of new economic regulation.\n\nThe people most capable of influencing policy are the least likely to \nreform a system in which they benefit from its shortcomings. \n\n==========================\n\nAs a side note, all this business about \"sympathy\" is more tiring than \nconstructive. \n\nI meant it more in regards to utilitarianism than actual economic practice. \n\nSo....really....whatevs.....discussion for another day.",

It puts everyone on the same \nplaying field, unlike socialism, which allows the government to dispense \nbenefits to corporations that others don't get.\n\nUnder Capitalism, we would see a Boom in industry, and the markets. The \nEconomy would improve slowly over time. \n\nWe wouldn't, however, see a domination of big corporations, we would all be \nplaying on the same field. Of Course Corporations will do well. However, \nthey wouldn't get these ridiculous benefits that the government dispenses \nthese days.\n\nSympathy shouldn't be mentioned in a Market. Sympathy to the poor \nspecifically comes from PEOPLE, not a market.\n\nThe Government's job isn't to take care of us, and take money from the \nrich, and give it too the poor.\n\nBy the way, Capitalism is not a Utopian system.
