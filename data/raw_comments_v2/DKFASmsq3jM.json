All you need to do is \nlook at the earth itself, the geographical record does not lie...the grand \ncanyon wasn't built in a day. I won't even bring up the fossil record, you \nprobably think dinosaur bones were put there to test our faith. If you \nthink someone built all this in 7 days, your sense of reality is \nwarped...our creation story isn't even from the bible. Just as the story of \nNoah and the creation of man are not from the bible. They plagiarized or \nborrowed from the Sumerian text, key elements in their history to mold the \nbible into what they thought would be a good foundation to start their \nfairy tale at. And trust me, a lot of what's been handed down is just \nthat...a fairy tale. Open your eyes man...see...enquire, find the big \npicture. Our true history of life on this planet is a far more epic tale \nthen you could imagine.\ufeff",

Of course, not addressing \nanything I said, and sorry to burst your 13 year old mentality childish \nbubble where you think everything is an attack and have to argue and attack \nbecause mommy and daddy didn't give you enough attention as a child, but \nit's actually popular to be aware of things that matter, verifiable \nconspiracies. Have you not heard of the latest UK study on fluoride? seems \nto be working wonders for you. The truth is what is actually incredibly \nentertaining, but unfortunately  fear based mentalities like yours would be \ntoo pussy to watch the film END GAME. \n\nAnd I write as fast as I can think so if you're amazed by the number of \nlines in my comments, that is pretty funny. Now finally, you have crossed \nthe line by suggesting I should be hung, so I'll just let you know what is \n coming for you as you agree that tyrants should be able to put people on \nstakes for mere beliefs, when what I'm talking about has nothing to do with \njust belief. A moron is someone who has access to verifiable facts of a \nplan for a world dictatorship but chooses to attack good people instead \neven though the internet will be completely controlled shortly.
