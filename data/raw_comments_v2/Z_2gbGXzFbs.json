Indeed, for the \ngeneral public, to exclude comets from a list of noteworthy objects of the \nsolar system is confusing, because bright comets are among the most \ninteresting objects to view and because such objects have potential to \ncollide with the earth (and their debris is left behind to give us \nsometimes wonderful displays of meteors as \"shooting stars\").\ufeff",

The problem is that asteroid was coined as a term (meaning \n\"starlike\") to apply to the early minor planets discovered -- which were \nall in the \"asteroid belt\" between Mars and Jupiter.  Those objects are not \nall the same, but the point is that when (much later) many other dynamical \ngroups of minor planets (vs. major planets) were found -- crossing the \norbits of major planets, or being in stable gravitational resonance with \nthis or that major planet -- the need became more urgent to use a more \ngeneric term like \"minor planet\" (vs. \"asteroid\").  The fact that there are \napparently some big differences in physical make-up (not to mention orbital \ndynamics) makes it more problematical to use a term like \"asteroid\" as a \ncatch-all phrase; minor bodies (planets) such as comets and trans-neptunian \nobjects and centaur objects (those that cross the orbits of the outer \nplanets) appear to be generally much more icy than the objects closer to \nthe sun, and thus of lower density. \nNobody really wants to call TNOs like Pluto \"asteroids\"; they are all \nreally minor planets, and are archived and monitored by the Minor Planet \nCenter.  The term \"dwarf planet\" really makes no sense and is unnecessary \nwhen \"major planet\" and \"minor planet\" are entirely adequate to simply \ndescribe bodies of the solar system orbiting the sun that are larger than \nmeteoroids.",
