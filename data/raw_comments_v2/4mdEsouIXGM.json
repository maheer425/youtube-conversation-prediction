Wind could still \nhear the faint barking of her dog in the distance, Wind decided to head \nright and see if Mr. Ug was ok, though very unlikely Wind would see Mr. Ug, \nshe kept heading right past the remaining half of the big rock, pine log, \nand a crumbling beet peel store, to see the crumbling house of Mr. Ug, \nripped in half from the earthquake. Wind could hear the barking of her dog, \nexcept this time... it was louder, and growing louder by the second, wind \nlooked further to her right to see her dog, fully alive and healthy, \nrunning towards her. Wind wondered how this was possible considering the \nother half of Wind's world was out of sight, Wind leashed her dog so that \n(s)he couldn't fall of the edge. Wind eventually came to see that her world \nwas still a loop, just less wide and longer, leaving more room for \nconstruction, wind scavenged the ruins of her home for her belongings and \nbuilt a home to fit the new world's proportions, wind took a lap around the \nworld, and found that Mr. Ug had also built a new house, Wind still had \nhope that he was still alive, so Wind stayed at her house hoping that Mr. \nUg had seen her house and was coming to see if she was still alive, Wind \nstayed at her house. Hours passed. Days passed. Weeks passed. Months \npassed, and Wind was starting to think Mr. Ug had fallen off the edge. Wind \nlooked to her left, and saw what looked like another person walking towards \nher, building a fence, Wind assumed it was Mr. Ug and was overjoyed and \nwalked towards the human-like figure building fence posts. The figure \nlooked at Wind, dropped everything and sprinted towards Wind. The figure \nintroduced itself as Mr. Ug, Wind was so happy that Mr. Ug was alive, and \nshe was able to meet Mr. Ug face to face. Wind started helping Mr. Ug with \nhis fence. The fence was finished soon after that and Wind, Wind's dog that \nwas recently named Dina, and Mr. Ug Lived happily on their M\u00f6bius world for \nmany years as Mr. Ug had come up with a name for the small world.\ufeff",

Wind found another flat \nworld, and really wanted to explore it. So Wind jumped off his splitting \nworld and landed safely on the other one. Wind saw 8 houses each arranged \nin an octagon. Wind thought they were OCD about house positions. There was \n1 empty house that nobody lived in, so Wind decided to live there. Then he \nwondered \"What paths could I take so that I could go to any house from any \nhouse?\" Wind drew a map where dots represented houses and he connected the \ndots so that every dot connected with every other dot. Wind thought the \npattern was very complicated but awesome anyways. He named it \"The 8-house \nconnection map\". Then Wind remembered his dog. \n\nWhat happens next? You can decide!
