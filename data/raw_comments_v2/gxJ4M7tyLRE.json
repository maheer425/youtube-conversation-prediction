This is because the Doppler \neffect dictates that objects are moving away from each other, which is true \nin space, but it's not the main cause of the redshift.

Think about the Doppler shift as \nyou standing by a racetrack and watching a racecar go by at 300 mph.

I suppose the point I was trying to make is that we are \nwithin our \"raisin\" galaxy so the light from our nearby stars is visible. \n Nearby galaxies are visible and get slowly red-shifted due to expansion \nthe further apart they are from us.  There comes a point where we can't see \nlight from very distant galaxies at all.\n\nThe reason we can see some stars with the naked eye is that they are \nreasonably close to us and therefore not red-shifted very much in \ncomparison with light from galaxies a long way from us.  The space between \ngalaxies is vast and there's a lot of expansion going on.  Gravity helps \nhold our galaxy together so we don't see the same kind of expansion within \na galaxy as we see between the galaxies.

Disregarding speed of light and \nassuming an average star density, an infinite universe should look \ninfinitely bright.\n\nI'm pretty confident that the following holds for our universe though:\n\nEarth is part of a larger galaxy. If you'd look outside the window of a \nspaceship at a suitable point far away from any galaxy inside the local \ngroup, you'd possibly see two faint dots in the entire sky and nothing else \n(Milky Way and Andromeda).\n\nIf you'd move far away from the local group into intergalatic space, you'd \nsee nothing at all. Complete and total blackness.\n\nAnd that even holds if you remain in an area of the universe with a high \ndensity in galaxies. Most of the space is located in great voids that are \nparticularly empty.\n\nSo if you move away from our galaxy you usually get into space ever and \never more devoid of stars by orders of magnitude.\n\nHowever, that doesn't really refute your argument. Since if, regardless of \nhow far you go, the density of stars remains constant over sufficiently \nlarge areas of space (we're thinking truly vast areas of space though), it \nshould still be true that the average perceived brightness should even be \ninfinite (if I think correctly here).\n\nThere is, however, also the speed of light taken into account. The farer \nyou look the more you look into the past. Indeed you can see \"light\" from \nall directions in the form of background radiation as talked about in the \nvideo.\n\nSo the distance you can see is in fact limited by the age of the universe \ntimes the speed of light.",

            "text": "+mrafifr p We are surrounded by billions of stars and billions of galaxies, \nbut we only see a couple thousand during the night. Stellar extinction is \nwhen interstellar dust absorbs electromagnetic radiation, and it's probably \nthe biggest reason why we don't see many of the bright stars in our own \ngalaxy. Also, not all stars are created equal: most stars in our galaxy and \nelsewhere are actually red dwarfs which are too dim to see with the naked \neye at any distance. Finally, we don't see the more distant galaxies in the \nuniverse because of redshifting. They might be bright and large, but if a \ngalaxy's light is shifted too far into the infrared spectrum by the \nexpansion of space, we won't be able to see that either with our naked eye.\n\nAs for your second question, I'd recommend watching Henry's video, \"Do we \nexpand along with the Universe?\". The tl;dw is that yes: all space expands \nincluding the space within stars, but gravity pulls the stars back together \nwell before they are torn apart. The space within galaxies also expands, \nbut as before, gravity pulls the stars in a galaxy together more than the \nexpansion of space can pull them apart. (At least for now.)",

Therefore, \nit cannot be seen.\n2) As light travels, it gets redder and redder. Light from distant galaxies \nis too red for human eyes to see.\n\nIf you're curious about why these two facts are the case, then you have a \ndifferent question entirely.
