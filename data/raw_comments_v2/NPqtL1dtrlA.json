They don't fit \nEXID style so I'm happy they left. And btw. Hyeyeon left to study. \nHaeryeong wanted to practice acting... and they have dedicated fans like \nmyself. I don't think they lost in any point. I don't think they regret \nleaving either. So you can't really say \"Hope they learned a lesson not to \ngive up\" when you clearly don't know anything... Please, support EXID on \nEXID videos, because I believe that's where you should do that :) And don't \nanswer impolitely to me, I beg you because I am nice to you.",
