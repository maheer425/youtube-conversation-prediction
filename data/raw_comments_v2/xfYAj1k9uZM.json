Then \ncroc bite  the snake in the middle of his long body and again nothing, no \nblood and snake was alive, why? I often say - the measurement have big \nmistakes, the methods of measurements are very different and not \ncomparable. Recently has  been doscovered, that the bite force of among \nothers lions is very different dependently on situation - so often \nduplicated absurd is that male lions have BS = ~700!! It is why. So if \nsomeone gives a piece of meat on a stick with a measure of force using \nextensometer that lion does not use all his strength - for what when he is \nit does not requires it. Cats optimize energy consumption!  And such \nmeasurement goes then to the people as revealed truth.I am skipping aspects \nof physics and that something else is the effective force (EBF), the entire \njaw and the same force concentrated in cats only 4 centers with near zero \nsurface - the EBF then is much much more effective than That of for whole \njaw as in dogs , hyens etc. - Which have no so long 4 thin, strong teeth. \nBit of PHYSICS - those who write about \"bite strength\" of dogs, Hyenas \nCANNOT BE COMPARED WITH THAT FOR 4 LONG FANGS CATS! WHY? Because the bite \nstrengt BS have to be measured regarding to area!!! It is then called \npreassure (P)!! The equation is very simple : P = BS /area, so smaller area \nmeans bigger preassure, it is whi nails are long and thin as fangs, because \ncan more effectiveli delve into the body !!! So all the comparisona are \nmistaken. Cats have the strongest preassure, if you want call it Efective \nBite Strength!!!\ufeff",
