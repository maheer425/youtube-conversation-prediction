            "text": "+Kathleen Torrez It's a bit of a question of degree. Sometimes plot lines \ncan be quite similar without it being copying or infringement. If the \npremise is that one is based on another, then it would be a violation of \nthe right to derivative works. The derivative works rights I think is a bit \nof an anomaly on the international front - the US may be the only one, or \none of the few that grants such a right. Other countries require a copying \nof the original story. That being said, you can have copyright in \nwell-developed non-generic characters, so using them might be an \ninfringement. \n\nThe two old works you cite are in the public domain (Wizard of Oz and The \nLittle Mermaid), so you can make any story based on them and it won't be \ninfringement. You would also have copyright in your new work, provided it \nis original, but you can't protect the elements that are in the original \nwork. You would only have copyright in the new elements you provide.",

I have heard that some fan vidders have actually successfully \napplied to become yt partners...but that is the exception.\n\nMost of us do this very tedious task of fan vidding for free. We make a fun \nvideo for people to enjoy. The hell we have to go through to do it as well. \nBut as any artist/creator etc will tell you it's worth it for the final \nresult. We have to get the clips, convert them, sit down find the right \nclip, sync it up, test render. Only to have it blocked. Vidding is fun but \nmostly tedious.....\n\nI mean imo it's free advertising for the show/movie/song. I have actually \nseen whole movies posted to this site, but no they are untouched. But a \nless than 5 min video of a show, edited out of order, with the sound taken \naway and a song put on there instead gets taken down!? I mean it's like \ntaking a fan made poster away from a fan holding it up at a movie premier. \nWell, they don't OWN those photos do they. They cut them out of \nmagazines.....\n\nAlso when they block the vid for the song, it's also strange since the song \nIS on youtube! Copyright means that you have a RIGHT to LIMIT the copies of \nsomething. But a YT vid is INFINITE. You can play it as many times as you \nwant. And no music label has ever really taken anything down, so nothing is \nLIMITED. So WHY can't I use the song on my video. It's just disturbing. \nSometimes the fan made video is a better mv for the song imo. I may be \nbiased but I have seen just people comment on fan vids that it's better \nthan the 'official' video. But that is a matter of taste...anyways.\n\nJust some common sense would be nice. Fan vidders should apply for a fan \nvid licence or something. Fan vids are GOOD word of mouth for your \nshow/movie/music. I have got into and BOUGHT many things since I saw it in \na fan video. It's time these companies wake up....I am ok with them taking \nownership of their material. I in NO WAY claim that I own any of these \nshows/music etc that I use. I am ok with them putting ads or blocking them. \nDo what you like you own it sure. BUT it's mean since we are FANS of yours. \nIt's just go onto deviantart and there are thousands of drawings of disney \ncharacters, do they get blocked? THEY drew them but it's BASED on material \nthey don't own. Imo as long as you are not making profit off it and doing \nit for fun you should be ok. We have to tread lightly.....\ufeff",

            "text": "All of my videos use music that is either licensed by the developers of the \ngames I am playing or come from Kevin MacLeod or Machinima Sound.  They are \ncovered by Creative Commons and specifically called out in the description. \n  Yet, YouTube still allows them to be flagged by idiotic robots and/or \nscammers, who say they own the content...  So, it's a flawed system that is \nbeing exploited by users who know how the system works and is denying \npeople who are following the rules from being compensated for their \noriginal content.  \n\nNot that I am making all that much off my crap channel, but it's fun.\ufeff",
