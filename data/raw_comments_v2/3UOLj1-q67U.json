Misuses appear in movies (A \nnotable example is The Living Daylights,[10][11] wherein narcotics were \ndisguised as Red Cross care packages, as a plot device), on television, and \nin computer software and games. Service companies, such as those for car \nrepair or lawn maintenance, tout themselves as service \"doctors\" and \nincorporate medical symbols to promote themselves.\n\nIn 2006, the Canadian Red Cross issued a press release asking video game \nmakers to stop using the red cross in their games; it is an especially \ncommon sight to see first aid kits and other items which restore the player \ncharacter's health marked with a red cross.\"\n\nI had gotten the information from \nhttp://www.microstockgroup.com/general-stock-discussion/red-cross-symbol-copyrighted/ \nif you would like to take a look at the site for yourself.",
