My own Husband KNOWS when I get into \nmega bitch mode or whatever, he'll actually tell me to go smoke. Cause when \nI do then my brain calms down, my attitude and demeanor calm down. Then we \ncan have a rational conversation. The longest I have gone w/out smoking was \n3 year's. It is my sanctuary, stress reliever, and all around life \nsaver...Usually someone else's due to my temper LOL. But seriously I rarely \ndrink any kind of alcohol, and I will forever be a HUGE supporter of weed \nas a recreational, weekend, daily Happy place. WHY would you not want to \nworld and the people in in happier? Like Katt Willams said: Weed just makes \nyou hungry,happy, and sleepy. That's it! So true, and the BEST part of weed \nvs alcohol...Weed WON'T leave you with a headache, nor will it keep you \nfrom getting a decent night's sleep. Alcohol will screw all that up for \nyou.

THEY ARE BUYING ILLEGAL DRUGS FROM A DRUG DEALER! lol it's not \nthe drug itself. This has been refuted and wouldn't make sense. Alcohol has \na similar if not more obvious affect, why would that not be a gateway drug? \nThe answer is simple, it is legal.\n3. Alcohol addicts are NOT always fit to have a job. They are called \naddicts for a reason... because it's usually interfering with their job! \nJob loss, accidents, absence, and loss of production is far more prevalent \nwith the abuse of alcohol. 25% of accidents on jobs are alcohol related. I \ncan't really seem to see the same staggering statistics for marijuana \nconsumption. Alcohol has a much larger cognitive impairment, despite what \nyou seem to think. You cannot function close to properly on alcohol, while \nyou can with marijuana.\n4. correlation does not equal causation. A staggering amount of those with \nschizophrenia also smoke cigarettes. This is because of a tendency for \nthose with the disorder to be predisposed to addiction or enjoying it more. \nIt could be more of an indicator rather than a cause. There is no evidence \nto suggest that marijuana actually causes schizophrenia. It may but I doubt \nit. There is a huge number of people consuming marijuana and no significant \nincrease in schizophrenia. schizophrenia rates are also relatively the same \nthroughout all nations, which wouldn't be the case for non-smoking \ncountries. It's still at only about 1 to .5 percent yet the amount of \npeople smoking marijuana is pretty high. \n5.In conclusion, alcohol is much worse, causes more death, and has a more \nsignificant mental effect.",

(basically, they tried to kill \nanimals using marijuana and were unable to do so) there are 2,200 alchohal \noverdose per year in the united states.\n\ni have plenty of other information from many reputable sources, you dont \nhave to take advice from \"a pot head\" but you can take advice from Dr \nlester grinspoon who is retired associates professor from harvard medical \nschool and currently leading psychiatrists at boston mental health center \nspecializing in marijuana studies as well as schizophrenia, he has videos \non here you can just type his name. there are plenty of others....",

Kind of like if I were \nto say, \"I enjoy a bit of pot. But, *___*(Negative comments). Didn't mean \nto be such a hypocrite with all that bit of pot I have once smoked!\" \nPerhaps rename the video to, \"Alcohol is bad.\" then make a new video \ncalled, \"Why weed is not dangerous.\" and actually cover more facts about \nwhy it's not dangerous besides the whole \"ZERO people have died.\" shit that \nwe have all heard a million times.

Arrest a cancer patient and take the Cannabis he was \ngrowing and using to treat his cancer (and it was working) away. It's time \nto end this corruption. LEGALIZE Cannabis and the sky WON'T fall.

It gets yourself to think and ask what is happening to \nthe world around you. That is why these are illegal even though there is no \ndirect potential dangers. They also do not cause a physical addictions as \nopposed to tobacco, alcohol, nicotine, coke, prescription pills, etc. Also \nthe government / WHO wants to reduce the world population and promote \ncancer because treating it/ not fully curing is a mutli billion dollar \nindustry.
