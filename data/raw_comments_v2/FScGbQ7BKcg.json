But \nif it is like Game of Thrones with a 10+ years since the books came out and \nstill continuing and that you don't know what is happening or who dies, \nthere is no limitations. My youngest sister who is a sophomore is old \nenough to pick up the books to read and I feel like I can't talk about \nanything GoT related for she will hurt me if I spoil something.
