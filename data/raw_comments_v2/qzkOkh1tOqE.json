(like drawing or writing or \neven giving a finger requires multiple muscles working together) the \nmessage still goes down the old ways to non existing arm and the brain \nfeels so called 'ghost pain' for the missing arm when the ways are cut and \neven that you understand that the arm doesnt exist no more. the brain as a \nwhole does not and so it still sends messages to it. most likely the arm \nwould be powered up by multiple batteries that must be loaded time to time.\n\nso ones the arm is ready and functional, it can after that used for means \nof not just civil life, but war as well. since modification is simply done. \nbelt fed gun can be attached to the end instead of a hand. simple command \nof moving fingers will cause it to fire. 'but what about the kick. doesnt \nit cause harm to the arm?' no. kick in weapons can be reduced with out it \neffecting its fire power. and so it turns badly wounded soldier into more \nlethal killing machine. you have literally created a cyborg soldier. (the \nterm means more than just futuristic frankenstein monster. if you have \nhearing device implanted under your skin. that already makes you a cyborg)\n\nafter that different kind of cyborgs can be made, a super soldier with all \nlimbs replaced with over sized robotic limbs supported by armor making him \nbigger than average man and giving more power than average man. this tank \nlike shell will protect him from all kind of damage and not even eye holes \nare weak spots when you supply him with cameras behind bullet resistant \nglass (cameras today can be very small in size and phone cameras are \nperfect example of that even that they dont have endless amount of pixels) \nso only way to blind him would be by throwing mud on its face. that is if \none even can get that close with out being shot or simply crushed or rip to \nshreds. normal weaponry for such soldier is implanted flame thrower on one \nof its arms. a machine gun (that will be now like childs toy to them) and a \nclose combat weapon, possibly over sized army knife that would be like a \nsword to normal men. down sides for them can be obvious, like how are they \nsupposed to live a normal life like that. well if the armor can be opened \nand the driver removed and normal sized arms and legs then implanted. they \ncan continue their every day life pretty normally. it is possible that \nfurther fusions must be made in order to work with camera movement and the \nflame thrower and other things. but the goal is to be able to remove the \nsoldier from the machine with out braking it. so might be that their back \nbone is modified with implants, same as their neck and some directly on the \nhead.and of course he must have harness to hold him. cant have him just \nswinging around in there hold up by his arms and legs that could tear the \nflesh of the implant causing not just horrible pain but bleeding to death.\n\nand suicide shock troopers can also be made. most likely made of prisoners \neither sentenced to death or life time, some pure maniacs and other insane \nscum that prisons hold in them. they can serve their country by being \ntransformed. their limbs are removed through surgery and animal limb like \nimplants are placed on them. after this they have hard time walking on two \nlegs if it is even possible. back bag is been installed on them with \nneedles to their veins (simply through bottom of the bag when its pushed \nagainst their back and than tied to them and locked to place) it contains \ndifferent kind of chemical combinations from powerful adrenaline to \nhallucinogens and other things that mess up your head and turns you into \nraving beast. they are than installed with switch to turn them on and of \n(this is already done with animals like mice and moths and I think even \nwith bigger animals, even with ox) another switch is been placed which \npumps the poisons into their bodies. than last is a bomb that is activated \nwhen they are send to battle. this bomb is connected to their heart rate. \nones their heart stops, either cause by them being shot or dying of the \ndrugs. they will blow up causing them to be even dangerous to be killed. \nthey are indeed released first on fields of war. like in cities or other \nplaces of major conflict. they cant separate enemy from friend ones they \nare in rage so its wise to pull your men back. these things dont have any \npiece of humanity left ones their brain is full of drugs, they are in rage \nand will quite literally rip to pieces everything they encounter. even if \nthey survive the conflict, the poisons are enough to kill them causing them \nto blow up with out harm.\nbut just think about it. that kind of monster who makes inhuman howls \nrunning towards you and your friends on the field. you start shooting at it \nbut it doesnt seem to have any effect. it jumps on your friend and tears \nhis throat open with its mouth before turning its insane gaze on you and \nattacking in rage. you shoot at it causing it to fall dead. but instead of \nlaying there, in mere seconds it will blow up in a big fire ball consuming \nyou and your friends and you die instantly. named these things after what \ninspired them; Arco-flagellant.\n'but isnt it waste of technology to make them' ones the technology is in \nuse there will be no such thing as wasting it since it can be created all \nthe time. only thing it wastes are parts of the robotics. no human lives \nwasted.\n\n\n\nindeed, seen some vids about them in youtube and even that they are still \npretty big, they are also very effective.\n\n\nyeah it could be dangerous for humans to not just live there, but to have \nchildren. it will effect the future generations for them to evolve to this \nlower gravity and so they are never able to come to earth. what we need is \nartificial gravity to solve this kind of problems.",
