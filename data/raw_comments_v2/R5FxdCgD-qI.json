I personally don't \nknow anyone who has had a temple divorce, but from what I was taught, this \ncan happen when the couple aren't compatible for each other anymore. People \ngrow in different ways, so I guess some can grow apart.\n\nI haven't exactly read anything that was specifically about divorce in the \nscriptures, although I'm not the most studious person, but I thought \nadultery was only when a married wife or husband were untrue to their \nspouse while still being married. Sorry, I'm a little unclear to what's \nbeing asked.\n\nWhy it's tolerated? Well, like legal divorce there can be a falling out \nbetween the couple, especially if they both aren't trying to mend their \nbond or are really just incompatible, finding this out latter in life. It \ndoes make a mess of things, but if there were two people who clearly didn't \nwant to be together, I think it would be best to separate them; of course \nonly after years of pondering if this is the best course of action - \nespecially considering how the children are and will be effected. So why \nit's tolerated is because it's the final course of action if all other \nthings fail, proving that the couple really are just incompatible with each \nother.\n\nTaking marriage courses before marriage is (I think, since I'm not married) \nmore of a personal choice and is up to the couple. If they truly want it, \nthen they can; if they don't, then they don't. It's their free agency to \nchoose.\n\nI hope I answered your questions well enough as deep doctrine can be either \nvague or complex from what I'm studying right now. I'm not married so I'm \nnot sure how the whole process of sealing and divorce goes.\n\nUm, and sorry about writing so much - hope this doesn't hurt your eyes with \nthe display's LED lights and all that.

            "text": "Hi! I know this was a month ago that you asked this question, and though I \nmay not be a missionary - I hope that I can answer your question as best as \nI can.\n\nSo just to make sure I got this clear; you're question is about temple \nsealing - of when a man and a woman are sealed together, then there's a \nfallout and then they get divorced. The previous couple are then re-sealed \nto their new spouse, and your asking who the children are actually sealed \nto after all of that has happened, correct?\n\nWell, to tell you the truth, breaking the bond to the person someone is \nsealed to is a very serious matter and is in fact harder to administer than \na legal divorce. The couple must truly ponder whether they want to break \nthis spiritual bond that they have not only with each other, but with their \nchildren. Breaking a temple sealing is the last resort if the couple had \ntried everything they could to make their relationship better and healthier \nas the person they're sealed to is supposed to be their husband or wife for \nall eternity.\n\nIf there really is no other option, then they must write a request to the \nprophet, and he will determine whether to accept the request while fasting \nand praying. Breaking a temple sealing is basically breaking a sacred \ncovenant (well, in my eyes), you're essentially cutting the spiritual link \nof not only someone you vowed to spend eternity with, but you're also \nbreaking this link with you're children.\n\nNow onto the second part of your question. If the the two re-married and \nwere sealed to their new husband or wife, the children that the two had \ntogether wouldn't be sealed to the mother or father (whoever is breaking \nthe seal), essentially this could be equated to \"the breaker of the seal\" \n\"spiritually disowning\" the children they had been previously sealed to. In \nthe next life, the children that were born on earth won't see them as their \nparent, but just someone who they spent time on earth with - the same goes \nfor the parent who broke the seal; as they won't recognize their children \nas being spiritually \"their's\", but just people who they knew.\n\nI hope this answer was informative enough for you. In all honesty, me being \na lds member and 19 years old, people would think I know a lot - but I \ndon't, so please excuse me if my answer was confusing or unclear as this is \nvery deep doctrine.\n\nIf the missionaries you know aren't that well versed in a particular \nsubject, try asking the bishop of the ward they attend or online \nmissionaries on lds,org.\n\nI hope this helped! ^_^",

In a temple divorce, the sealing \nof the children to parents is not broken because their sealing was not the \nsame as the marriage. A good example is when sealings occur by proxy. The \nparents are sealed, then each child is sealed to his/her parent. I suppose \nthe handbook (I assume you mean handbook 2 - which covers local \nadministration mostly) doesn't mention anything because each sealing is \ntechnically separate (marriage vs. children to parents). As a side note, \ncovenant breaking by the parents does not void the sealing of the children. \nTo some extent, you can think of the sealing connection as you would the \nactual relationships in the family. Mom and Dad might not be husband and \nwife anymore, but Billy and Susie are still their children. I hope this \nhelps.",
