            "text": "+Bartek Struszczyk The force of gravity is famously explained by newton to \nbe F = G*((m1)*(m2)/r^2)     - and yes that does look abit wierd without \nsubscript and superscript. Anyways, the famous way to get infinity in a \ndivision is by dividing with 0, meaning r^2 would equal zero meaning r = 0, \nwhich means that infact, you are not traveling towards the black hole, but \nbecause your distance to the black hole is 0, you ARE the black hole. To be \nmore precise, speaking quantum'ly, the minimum aquirable distance is a \nplank length, which means that even being the black hole creates some \nobsenely large number instead of infinity.\n\nI guess the other way would be having m1 or m2 be infinite but then you \nwould get the problems of dividing infinity by a number(say 2) and then you \nhave created yourself half an infinity which is still an infinity and you \nhave both created a paradox and realised why infinity is in a \nmathematicians eye not an answer to any equation but instead a peasant's \nway to always want to give a number as an answer to a calculation rather \nthan just using an expression.\n\nAnd if that wasnt enough, having m1 or m2 be infinte becomes slightly \nworrying since that means either you or the black hole has infinite mass, \nbreaking quite a few laws of nature.\n\nThe last way is having big G, the gravitational constant, be infinte. I \nreally hope I dont have to explain to you why that is stupid.",

On your model with a cloth, and two balls you forgot to make \nearth roll around it. Ever seen the casino game : Roulette? With the little \nball spinning multiple times around the roulette before touching it. \nWell it's the same in space, but as there is (barely) no friction slowing \ndown earth it just spins way longer. With your cloth it might go around one \nor twice but the ball rolling on tge cloyh slows it down. That's why it's \nonly a metaphor, an easy way to represent really hard physics.",
