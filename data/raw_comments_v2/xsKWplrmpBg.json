Microsoft's HoloLens (Witch is literally the same \nthing but a thousand times more polished and you can ACTUALLY play LEGIT \nMinecraft on it RIGHT NOW, unlike the animated one shown in the video. \nMainly since Microsoft owns Minecraft)\nAnyways the HoloLens has been secretly been developed on for about 4 years \nor so, and was recently released back on January 27th, but since its been \nin development for around 4 years, technically it would be first. They \ndon't cover your eyes completely and don't use a Camera to show you a \nprojected viw of your world with holograms, the HoloLens just has two \nlayers of \"plastic\" in front of your eyes that can show 3d holograms.\nYou can use the built in 3D Modeling app to make things and send them to a \n3D Printer,\nYou can have something like a TV sitting on your wall (That isn't actually \nthere, its a hologram) while also having a calendar on your fridge, a \nweather \"Set\" on your table to show the current weather, and a bunch more \nstuff. All at once.\nTwo or more people can see the same thing, such as playing a game together.\nYou can even Skype with a friend (In the \"trailer\" they showed a girl \nSkyping her dad asking how to fix her sink plumbing, and he could show her \nexactly what part of the pipe to use the wrench on. Same was done with a \nMoterbike) and their Face is shown to you on a holographic screen that sits \non your floor/wall (Like a actual screen, aka a Tablet) or can just hover \nwith where you look.\nHonestly its VERY polished, and the demo they showed and let people test \nwas real. Not a fake animation showing what the device \"can do\" like the \none you showed (not hating on them, everyone does it to show what I can do \nwhen its done, but MS isn't done and they showed a ACTUAL view of it.)\ufeff",
