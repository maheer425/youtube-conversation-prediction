You see a view of mom that gives her time to \nothers, and doesn't see the benefit. In the end, when you see her list, she \nonly got two things done, and she didn't get to see her cousin. You would \nthink that the day was a failure.\n\nBut when her son says, \"Thank Thee that you allowed us to get all things \ndone that You needed us to do today,\" the mom realized that the things she \naccomplished in that day were not what she wanted to do on her to-do list, \nbut what God needed her to do for that day. She helped her son win the \nScience Fair, she helped her sister make a decision in life, she helped a \nfriend who was struggling with bad news, and she helped a new family get a \nnourishing meal for the night.\n\nThe speaker's voice summed up the point. When we serve others, we should \nnever feel like we have failed, or that our performance is lacking, because \nwe cannot be aware of all the good that we do on His behalf. And also being \nthankful for what you do have despite missing out on things we really want.\ufeff",

We believe is serving with a willing heart as best as we are able. \nSometimes it is very difficult to serve and we can be encourage to serve \neven when it is difficult, but we also have to be aware of our own limits \nand needs. God wants us to have and feel JOY!\n\nFIRST-we believe in FAMILYS and building strong healthy family \nrelationships. (This include children & cousins & sisters). Helping her \nchildren, lunch with sister, and meeting with cousin were all very \nimportant events that day.\n\nSECOND-A Relief Society President would be hard pressed to ask a single mom \nwith three kids to make dinner for a young married couple who just had a \nbaby with only a couple hours notice. This arrangement in the church is \nmost often done with prior arrangements by those who volunteer. Especially \nwhen the new father was enjoying his meal while the main character in this \nvideo was at home crying and depressed. There are many willing hands in \nthe LDS Church and if someone has prior appointments or obligations we can \neasily find an alternative. (This was not accurately represented in this \nvideo) Same as with the sister who needed a sitter last minute-There are \nmany willing sisters in our community that can help. The church has an \ninspired program called The Visiting Teaching Program, where all sisters in \nthe ward have two other sisters who visit with them regularly. Very often a \nsister in need can call on her visiting teachers first to see if they can \nhelp. AND in an unannounced way they willingly help their sisters. (I wish \na Mormon message was made about this, because it happens all the time and \ntruly reflects LDS sisters serving women on a regular basis)\n\nTHIRD-This women represented the whole idea that \"Women who think they can \ndo everything that is asked of them without consideration of their own \nneeds will end up depressed and resent the whole aspect of service\"....I \ndoubt that President Hinckley would appreciate his quote used to encourage \nwomen to say yes to everything and ignore their own needs.\n\nFOURTH-Yes.....she did good by helping others but with a depleted depressed \nattitude-This does not bring JOY in our lives and we do not preach this \nconcept to our women.     AND if each of the people she helped knew the \npain and sorrow that was the end results, and that she missed a most \nimportant joyful reunion with a cousin, then they probably would not have \nfelt so great themselves.  AND what about the poor cousin who got \nforgotten?  We don't encourage our members to make appointments and then \nnot show up!\n\nIf you want to know more, go to LDS.org and go to the Resources page and \nlook up Relief Society. There will be messages and videos of what the LDS \nchurch teaches it's members.\ufeff",

            "text": "This left me really sad and hoping women in the church don't feel like this \nis what's expected of us-to let ourselves be run ragged and do anything \nanyone asks no matter how last minute, and to feel miserable at the end of \nthe day because everything was taken care of except for our own needs. I \nthink a better end to this video (even though I adore President Hinckley) \nmay have been: \"It is a strength for women to be able to cross their own \nboundaries easily when they are meeting the needs of their children and \nserving others, but it is a great disadvantage when they feel every call \nfor service as an imperative which they are obligated to meet. Remember, a \nboundary has \u201cyes\u201d on one side and \u201cno\u201d on the other. A woman who never \nfeels that she can say \u201cno\u201d is lacking an important element of personal \nidentity and, hence, personal safety.\u201d -Chieko Okazaki\ufeff",

Why can't we just enjoy the peaceful \nmessage that comes from this video? I understand the concerns of others \nthat this might be teaching people to \"give of themselves relentlessly\" but \nI highly doubt that's what people will learn from it. I don't think the \nChurch is saying, \"Hey, this is what women should do,\" as much as they are \nsaying, \"Hey, this seems to be what women already do and we want them to \nknow they're awesome.\" As a college student, constantly running from place \nto place with sometimes what feels like 0 free time, I question if I'm \ndoing what the Savior would have me do and THIS video comforted me \nincredibly.\ufeff",
