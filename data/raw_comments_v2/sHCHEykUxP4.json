I \nrealized at a young age that the number of coincidences happening all \naround us that we simply don't see is staggering.  You wouldn't believe the \nkinds of coincidences that have happened to you.  That the metal in the \nbullet that killed your grandfather was in the fender of the car that hit \nyou and killed your father.  The relationship between things that are not \nyou are almost infinitely coincidental.  This must be happening all the \ntime around us and when we're blessed enough to have any perspective on one \nof those incidences.\n\nI also find the fermi paradox and the anthropic principle to be extensions \nof this curiosity with what we call coincidence.  Yes, we are in a universe \nespecially tuned for our intelligence... because we're here observing that \nuniverse.  If there are or aren't multiverses, there are not humans to \nwonder about the perfection of their universe for them.  It's not \ncoincidence, it's just kind of required for the whole thing to be happening \nanyway.  We think we're the center of creation while disregarding the \ninfinite complexity in something as different as a sun or as similar as \nanimal life.  We disregard that systems of order and magnitude would exist \nin other universes, that we've barely simulated our own much less do we \nhave any claim that other universes wouldn't harbor things so infinitely \ndifferent and more spectacular than the life we know.\n\nI actually think this is the exact same mistake made regarding our \nperception of free will existing and not existing.  It's just a perception \nof time.  Did I make the decision or did everything leading up to this \npoint in time make that decision for me?  Well yes, both.  You are \neverything up to that moment you made the decision, that's the you part.  \nYou is a description of those things that have decided what you will do.  \nWhether the universe is deterministic or not is totally a legitimate \nquestion, but whether we have free will or not seems like a misnomer of \nthat larger problem and not a matter of control or lack of control.\ufeff",
