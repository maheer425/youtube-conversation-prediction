Ok so you misunderstood me on point one, God is almighty and can do \nthings beyond our comprehension, I did mean that he made the world fully \ndeveloped, not a molten ball of rock with baby animals frying on it, and so \nsince the world was created immediately of course radiometric dating would \nsay it is billions of years old, it's not like He \"skipped over\" billions \nand billions of years of creation. He merely made them happen in an \ninstant, same goes for the universe.  But you say they were both created at \nthe same time, and that is true but once again the billions of years to \ncreate a universe will merely quickened and made to happen in an instance \nso that we had heavens to look upon.  Which, brings up an interesting \npoint, how do you explain the origins of the universe? It could not be \neternal, because as we all know the universe is not like God, it does not \nhave infinite energy and therefore that theory goes against the second law \nof thermodynamics. (You may know it as \"Entropy\")  Now if you believe in \n\"the big bang\", I have done research and apparently it is more of a stretch \nfrom a single point in space, well this is basically throwing away the law \nof conservation of energy; energy cannot be destroyed nor created.  Now you \nmight fight back saying God created energy but we know that God's power is \nendless and he can do all things.  If you say that the energy was already \nwithin that single point in space... then that's ridiculous! Where did that \nenergy come from?  Was it there from the beginning? If so then that once \nagain contradicts Entropy.\n\n2.  Lucy is merely multiple bone fragments that were found somewhat near \neach other and then thrown together to create an ape-man.  In all the \npictures, you can tell that the ribs do not line up and the bones are \nextremely fragmented and there are no feet.  Since the amount of bones is \nso extremely limited there is no way to know whether or not this is a \npossible link.  I could not find any proof whatsoever of the fossil types \nyou listed so I\u2019ll have to take your word for it, but still...  One fossil \nrecord each? Do you know how many fossil records we have of the rarest \ncreatures on the planet? A lot more than one.  And the truth is, people \nwant evolution to be right, that is why it is so openly accepted, because \nit destroys morals.  It proves that watching pornography, committing \nadultery, murder and all other sins are merely just primal instincts. \n Another point, why are there laws? Why don\u2019t we not just murder someone we \ndon't like very much? Because we are descendants of God (not all of us as I \nwill explain in the next section) and we know what is right and what is \nwrong.\n\n4.  I am slightly unsure about your view of God.  God gives man the choice \nto accept and love God or ignore him and hate him.  God gives us evidence \nof him everywhere we go.  We have souls, you can\u2019t deny it, you feel love, \ncompassion and even sorrow for other humans; these feeling would not be \npossible if we were mechanical beings as evolution depicts us.  Because if \nwe were we would still be animals, we would not know love, we would merely \n\"mate\" and fight with each other like bears for a mate and we would survive \njust for the sake of doing so.  I don't care how long you say it took to \nmake an ape into a man.  You cannot turn an ape that can\u2019t read or write \ninto a man that can go to the moon and back, but most importantly, \nevolution cannot create a soul.\n\nThis is all I'm going to post for now, since I am busy with school starting \nand all.",

Honestly, I \nwas going to write up a response of my own, but after seeing that, I don't \nthink I really have much to add on the subject. I get that dealing with the \nsame arguments against evolution and for God can get very tedious for a lot \nof atheists (especially for those of us interested in trying to provide a \nclear and accurate picture of evolution and our beliefs - or, more \naccurately, our lack thereof), but it's great to see someone else who isn't \njust immediately and rudely dismissive of Creationist claims.\n\nI think a lot of us have heard many of these arguments so many times that \nwe start to think in-depth explanations have no effect. The important thing \nto remember, of course, is that each and every time we hear these \narguments, they are coming from a different person, so in reality, we could \nbe setting the path for them to critically look at their beliefs each and \nevery time, but still get fed up because we feel as though we're not. This \nis especially true when it comes to people like Joseph Greenburg above, \nwho, as you mentioned, seems to actually be willing to listen to arguments \npresented and attempt to rebut them, which is far better than the rhetoric \nwe seem to get most of the time. \n\nP.S.

            "text": "+Joseph Greenburg I am grateful I am able to have this conversation with \nyou.  It's not very often that I come across people with beliefs analogous \nto yours who are also willing to defend them rationally.  Much of your \ncriticism is indeed valuable.  In trying to maintain brevity, I left out a \nlot of the meaningful explanation of those claims.  However, I'd like to \naddress your defense of biblical creationism for now.  I'll address the \nrebuttal to the evidences of evolution later in this response.\n\nA Note: This is a quite long response.  I apologize in advance.  I just \nwant to seize the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit.\n\n*ADDRESSING CLAIMS DEFENDING BIBLICAL CREATIONISM*:\n\n1. *\"With your point one you say that radiometric dating says the world is \n4.54 billion years old.  However, God is eternal and almighty, could he not \ncreate a mature heaven and earth?\"* - If an omnipotent God did exist(a \nclaim that has not yet been demonstrated), he would, undoubtedly, have the \nability to create the heavens and the earth however he wished them to be. \n I can only assume that, by \"mature\", you mean fully developed.  I could \ncertainly be wrong, and please tell me if I am, but that's the way I \ninterpreted your response.  If that is how you intended the word, then this \nresponse is rather irrelevant.  Modern science(the principles of \nradioactivity, measuring of half lives, etc.) has granted us a reliable way \nof dating fossils(really the rock around fossils); it is called Uranium-235 \ndating.  Through dating the oldest rocks we have, we have determined the \napproximate age of the earth(~4.54 billion years).  We also have a method \nof dating stars that tells us, along with some of the math associated with \nGeneral and Special relativity, we can determine the approximate age of the \nUniverse to be ~13.7 billion years old.  Now, if God did create the \nUniverse, he *could* have formed it mature(with all life, regions, etc.), \nbut that isn't the issue we're dealing with.  We have some good models \nabout how earth came about.  We know it wasn't just \"created mature\", \nbecause it was a very long and tedious process to create a planet capable \nof supporting some life some of the time.  From the science, we know that \nthe \"heavens and the earth\" weren't created mature, so how is it not a \ncontradiction when your Bible claims that it did?\n\n2. *\"With your point three you merely copied the same thing you mentioned \nin your prior point five. There are no records of fossil transitions and \nyou can't prove it.\"* - I agree that the fossil record was used in as \nevidence both contradicting biblical creationism and supporting the Theory \nof Evolution by Means of Natural Selection.  I think that it's amazing we \nhave the fossils that we do possess.  It is incredibly unlikely that any \ngiven organism who dies will become permanently frozen in the fossil \nrecord.  When an organism dies(in a natural way and is not purposefully \npreserved), it lays there, on the ground, rotting for a substantial amount \nof time.  It takes a tremendous amount of time for sediment to be deposited \non top of a dead organism so that the micro-organisms will stop eating it. \n Then, you have to survive millions or even billions of years being crushed \nby the rock above you, without losing your form.  Shortly said, it is \nincredibly unlikely that any given organism will be preserved long enough \nfor us to observe it.  That being said, we have many transitional forms, \neven when it comes to the evolution of modern humans.  I think an \nacceptable point to start off with is *Australopithecus afarensis* this was \na relatively early hominoid species that shared characteristics with both \nprimitive apes and humans today.  The most common fossil of this species is \nknown as \"Lucy\".  I urge you to look up a modern rendition of what Lucy may \nhave looked like.  They did walk in a semi-bipedal way, but they still had \nthe fur that is indicative of many apes you know today.  At this level, \nwe're talking about hominoids(Superfamily Hominoidea).  Next, \nhominines(Family Hominidae) evolved.  Then, hominins(tribe Hominini) \nevolved.  Then, humans(Genus *Homo*) evolved.  I don't feel it's nessesary \nto cite evidence of this evolution, but, if requested, I will.  This \nparagraph is already quite lengthy, and I don't want to make you think I'm \njust using these Biological terms to \"muddy up the waters\".  Now, the first \nmembers of G. *Homo* were nothing like modern humans we see today.  In \nfact, one of the first species to evolve was *Homo habilis*.  If you look \nup a modern rendition of what it looks like, it is basically a a human with \nan ape's face and skin.  From here on, all the members of the genus *homo* \nare referred to as \"humans\".  From *Homo habilis*, we have the following \nprogression of evolution(of which, all of them have at least 1 instance in \nthe fossil record.), not all directly leading to *Homo sapiens*, but \ndisplaying the diversity of the genus *Homo*:\nH. rudolfensis, H. georgicus, H. ergaster, H. erectus, H. cepranensis, H. \nantecessor, H. heidelbergensis, H. rhodesiensis, H. neanderthalensis, H. \nsapiens.  And, with all of that evolution, here we are today.  We can see \nthe changes in various species of the genus *Homo*. over the last 2 million \nor so years that the genus *Homo* has existed.\n\n3. *\"Your point 4 is just a misinterpretation of the Bible.  In Genesis *\n*1:27** the actual verse is \"So God created man in His own image, in the \nimage of God He created him; male and female He created them.\"  That does \nnot say they were made simultaneously, merely that they were both created \nin God's image.  Furthermore, God did not seek out a partner for Adam, He \ncreated one.\"* - For brevity's sake, I'm going to give this one to you, for \nit's not really essential for my argument.  I'm no biblical scholar, nor do \nI claim to be one.  I can leave this one on the table for now.\n\n4. *\"And at last your point five.  God gave man free-choice and man chose \nto do wrong.  God is almighty but nevertheless He gave man the choice to do \nwhatever he wanted.  Saying that we did nothing wrong is ridiculous! \n Everyone has sinned and we must either pay for our sins ourselves, or \naccept Jesus' payment for our sins when He died on the cross.\"* - One of \nthe properties of of the Judao-Christian God is omniscience.  Let's assume, \nfor the sake of argument that God is indeed space-less, time-less, and \ntranscendent, as many people put it.  He exists eternally, external to this \nUniverse.  If we travel back in time to when God created the Universe, by \nhis very own omniscience, will would have known every single thing that \nwould happen in the future.  He knew what choices you were going to make, \nwhat life you were going to live, etc.  Now, let's say he then starts the \nUniverse, and the 13.7 billion years passes, and you are born.  Then, \ntoday, you decide you're going to go out and eat some pizza with your \nfriends at some restaurant.  When the waiter asks you what you want, you \nsay, \"one medium barbecue pizza\".  You have, in that moment, made a \n\"choice\", facilitated by your free will.  Now, when God created the \nUniverse, he knew that you were going to order a barbecue pizza.  If God \nhad known that you would order a barbecue pizza, only then to learn that \nyou actually ordered a vegetable pizza, that would count against God's \nomniscience.  In simple terms, you can *only* do what you were going to do. \n If the future is determined in that way(we know it is determined, because, \nif otherwise, God wouldn't be able to know what kind of pizza you would \norder), you have no agency over which choice you make.  Essentially, God \nknows everything you will ever do, and you cannot do anything but what God \nknew in advance.  This position is known as \"determinism\".  Even without an \nomniscient God, free will seems to be a tricky thing to figure out.  If I \nextend this argument, without free will, why should we be punished for \nsinning?  We couldn't control sinning--it was in our very nature to sin. \n If we had the free will to choose sin or grace, God shouldn't be able to \nknow which choice we are going to make until we make it, thus counting \nagainst omniscience.\n\nPhew.  That was a lot of text.  Congratulations on making it this far.  The \nevolutionary response will be more succinct. \n\n*ADDRESSING CLAIMS REBUTTING THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION BY MEANS OF NATURAL \nSELECTION*:\n\n1. *\"First off your point one and two are simple, saying that things have \nsimilar characteristics does not mean they are related, they merely have \nthe practical anatomy to survive on the planet, you wouldn't say that a dog \nis related to a chair because they both have four legs, they just have four \nlegs because it is required for stability.  The same goes for the anatomy \nof many animals, God wouldn't make the internal anatomy of a dolphin \nentirely different from a whale's just for the sake of them being \ndifferent.\"* - I actually agree with this.  My first 2 points were poorly \nexplained, and I apologize for that.  I will try to make up for that now. \n To reiterate, my first two claims were that modern genetics and physiology \nsupport the Theory of Evolution by Means of Natural Selection.  This was \npoorly worded.  I pretended as if simply being similar meant you were \nrelated.  This is indeed wrong.  However, as I'll show in a second, you can \nuse both modern genetics and physiology to demonstrate the related-ness of \norganisms.  Let's take the first example:\n*Modern Genetics*: Within genetics, each organism has a genome--the \ncollection of all the genetic information possessed by that organism. \n Using the Theory of Evolution by Means of Natural Selection, you can make \nthe prediction that, organisms that are distantly related, evolutionary \nspeaking, will have much more differences between the genomes of both of \nthem, as opposed to having two closely related animals, who will have \nlittle genetic differences.  This prediction is derived from the idea that \norganisms adapt by possessing beneficial mutations that aid them in \nsurviving and/or reproduction.  If we extrapolate this, the more distantly \nrelated you are to an organism, the more mutations that would have happened \nbetween the two of you.  This prediction actually turns out to be true; in \nfact, modern humans and chimpanzees share about 90% of their DNA, where as \nhumans and mice share about 80%.  It's only 10%, but it's actually quite \nsignificant, what with all 3 of these animals being mammals(who have only \nexisted for ~4% of the time earth have existed, which is not a very long \namount of time to evolve tremendous differences).  If God did create all \nanimals spontaneously, why would he make it look like chimpanzees and \nhumans are closely related if they weren't?\n\n2. *\"Your point three is confusing, because when I read this page I \nrealized no evidence whatsoever was presented, I looked up the transitory \nwhale and found nothing, if you want to talk about predictions and \nprophecies then the Bible has you beat before you even begin.  The Bible \nrecords many predictions that could not have been made by pure chance, \nthough many have said the Bible has been edited and these passages have \nbeen added in a later edition of the Bible, countless repeated researches \nhave shown this is wrong.\"* - Just to start off, I'd like some evidence of \nthat last assertion.  It seems quite plausible that there were altercations \nto the bible(not to mention the plausibility that the story was completely \nfabricated), even the New Testament, considering that the earliest accounts \nof Jesus and his disciples date to about 90 C.E. with the John Rylands \nmanuscript(the Oldest known New Testament manuscript).  That's 57 years \nafter Jesus was suspected to have died, and this was the most optimistic \nestimate I could find.  Most historians place it around 150 C.E.  That \nseems like plenty of time for the game of telephone to have its affects. \n Your example of a bible prophecy is interesting.  I've never heard that \nparticular one.  I'll be the first to admit; I'm not educated on this \nexample.  Thus, I don't have the ability to assess it's credibility.  That \nbeing said, is it possible that this could either have been a \nself-fulfilling prophecy or a fraudulent account?  It certainly wouldn't be \nthe first time evidence was inserted into the bible after the fact.  The \nchurch perpetrated the \"evidence of the historicity of Jesus\" that was the \naccount of Josephus, which was ultimately a forgery.  Why couldn't this be \na similar case?\n\n3. *\"Your point number four is a very common mistake that evolutionists \nmake, that is adaptation not evolution.  The same has happened with many \ncreatures, they adapt to their surroundings.  Evolution is the transition \nbetween \"Kinds\" there are too many definitions of the word \"species\" for me \nto use it.  The only way you could convince me of this transition is if you \nshowed me a long line of fossils turning an ape into a human (don't give me \nlinks and don't tell me any of that stuff, I know it isn't proven and it \nnever will be.)  Now point number five is profound and extremely lacking of \nany evidence.  Colin Patterson a senior Paleontologist at the British \nMuseum of Natural History, which houses sixty million specimens (the \nlargest fossil collection in the world) confessed \"If I knew of any \nevolutionary transitions, fossil or living, I would certainly have included \nthem in my book 'Evolution'\".  If that is not enough to convince you I have \nmuch more evidence that shows how wrong you are in believing there are many \nevolutionary transitions in the fossil records.\"* - firstly, even if Colin \nPatterson had said that and meant it(which he didn't; it was a quote mine), \nthat would have no impact on the voracity of Evolution.  Evolution is true \nno matter what people say, because it's truth is determined by the evidence \nthat supports it, not the people who advocate it.  As for the whole \nMicro-Evolution/Macro-Evolution ordeal, it's not even an argument.  The \nprocess of Macro-Evolution is the exact same process that Micro-Evolution \nis--adaptation.  The only difference is the time scales.  Take a look at my \nexample of variation within the genus *Homo*.  Over many periods of \nMicro-Evolution(more erect stance, larger brain capacity, opposable thumbs, \nlanguage \"gene\", etc), you get Macro-Evolution.  Micro-Evolution is the \ntransition between *Homo Habilis* and *Homo Erectus*, and Macro-Evolution \nis the transition between *Homo Habilis* and *Homo Sapien*.  This is just \nsemantics, because they are the same exact process.  If one exists, the \nother exists.  It's as simple as that.",

An interesting question: is it \"typical\" or \n\"extraordinary\" for an irrational number to have this property that it \ncontains every possible finite sequence within its digits?  Yet another \nquestion: if an irrational number has this property in one base (e.g. base \n10) then does it have this property in any other base (e.g. base 2)?  Yet \nyet another question: does this property depend on whether the number is \nalgebraic or transcendental?
