What is insulting is the \nway some men compliment women, which has nothing to do with what I have \nsaid, and they really think it is cool or even romantic. As a woman, I feel \nmyself seen, watched even, as a piece of meat or a painting you stop to \nlook at. Well, not even a painting, because art is suppossed to transmit \nyou something but women are only suppossed to turn men on. That\u00b4s why most \nof your female students are so worried about their apperience, because they \nwant to look good FOR BOYS, which is degrading and disgusting. And that is \nalso the reason why most of the girls my age look similar, everybody tries \nto fit in that image of \"what boys prefer\". I fucking hate that.\nReally good speech by the way, I\u00b4m so happy I found it.\ufeff",

About the only \ninteresting thing she said is don't compliment small girls on how pretty \nthey are.\n\nThe source of these issues is free market (and associated capitalism), and \nindeed even democracy!    In a free democratic world, we're allowed to \npursue our passions, and such passions have created unprecedented growth in \nworld economies, through the free market,capitalistic system.\n\nBut free market works also by inflamming the passions.   That is, the most \nbase desires tend to be the ones most easily for sellers to sell to.   \n Hence, the women's desire for beauty is an easy target to commercialize, \nvia advertising and media saturation for beauty.\n\nAs long as advertising (a critical component of free markets) and desire \nfor beauty exist, the correct free market answer is to saturate the medias \nwith the optimal return point on inflamming this beauty desire--so as to \nsell to base desires.   Free markets does this moreso than other economic \nand political systems.\n\nSo, what's the answer, if we wish to retain the free market system?   \n(Otherwise, we run  into free speech problems).\n\n1. Outlaw photo and video enhancements of women's beauty characteristics.   \nThat is, show people as they are.\n2. Outlaw cosmetic surgery.\n\nI believe it will be difficult to outlaw natural beauty photos (e.g. Sophia \nLorenz I believe never had cosmetic surgery).   But, the amount of \ninflammation of passions for overabundant amount of artifical beauty can be \nsignificantly reduced by the above.\n\nHer solutions are unworkable.   1. Not look at magazines....  How can \nsomeone not do this when one's passions are so inflammed?   2. Not \ncompliment little girls.... Good idea, but I still don't see how a single \nset of parents not complimenting will stop the rest of the village from not \ncomplimenting thus.\n\nOutlawing certain  forms of exacerbting the current problem (photo touchups \nand cosmetic surgery) are better solutions.\n\nTo better understand this, there's an analogous example with men.   \n Pornography 50+ years ago was heavily regulated and frequently outlawed.   \n However, due to free speech and free markets, now pornography is simply \nover-saturated.    This is unhealthy for men (and ensuing women).   It is \nsimplistic to tell men not to look at magazines or videos or to not to \nappreciate women's beauty when teaching them as little boys.   The correct \nanswer is to also strongly regulate pornography as well.\n\nFree speech is great, but excessive inflammation of passions, particularly \nby free market forces, is a serious downside of democracy, free markets, \nand capitalism.\ufeff",

So, Renee, girls who invest less in \ntheir appearance will simply have less men to choose from as mates. Oh, \nand, BTW, women have developed all kinds of ways to maximize their \nappearance, but there's no way for men to make themselves taller, as women \nconsider men who wear elevator shoes as 'cheating' by deception. \ufeff",

I do think and agree \nwith her that there is way to much focus on looking like the models, \nhowever; at the same time we cannot allow obesity to be acceptable. \nAmericans on average, which she is American btw, are way more overweight \nthan anyone in the world. A large shirt in Europe is a medium here in the \nUS. We must take into account eating habits for both genders and say ladies \nand gentlemen this is not right. Secondly, this has to do with genes, some \nhave them and some don't get over it. If you are a Social Darwinist you see \nit as natural selection is taking place and if you are a tree huger you see \nit as something very bad. And lastly, I think the whole rebellion from this \nmovement is sparked by the new pro-feminine movement here in America. Which \nis not bad, but basically anything the far right of the movement sees as \nfeminine they are going the opposite direction. That being said, I'm all \nfor freedom of choice, but I think we all can agree advertising and media \ncan be used in both ways to manipulate how we see each other. We must be \ncareful of how we use that because we can start a whole other problem in \nthe process. At the end of the day, it is who wins the fight and not how we \nfeel. Life is tough, and we all must live with ourselves. The image we \nshould all go for is take care of our bodies, food habits, and standards of \neducation and behavior. Don't use a movement to crutch on like the \nstereotypes of ADD and ADHD kids. They are just as smart if not smarter \nthan \"Regular\" kids. Same goes with this movement, just because they tell \nyou are beautiful does not mean you are realistically. Male or female just \ntake care of yourself and the rest will happen. Indifference is what makes \nus all unique. All it is is a mindset. \ufeff",

It is funny because every single one of the photos i can \nremember of those girls had exactly the pose she showed in the ted talk \nexcept they added the duck lip thing to it.   I appreciate the beauty of a \nwoman and the efforts they put into it but when its all about being seen as \nbeautiful it really does take away from just about everything else a person \nwould desire in a relationship.   what dude wants to date girl that has to \nlook in mirror for 2 hours before going out to dinner or something.   Its \nlike yo lady i am your man and i am cool with you, why are you trying to be \nso hot all the time for everyone else to see?  Life is a balancing act of \nhealth, wealth, and love.    to much of any takes away from being whole as \na person.
