This \nactually conforms with all theories of gravitons we have because they \nshould be very weak. It takes a lot of mass to have a decent strength \ngravity field.\n\nHowever, Einstein came up with the idea of General Relativity. In this \ntheory an object in a gravity well (like Earth's surface) goes through time \nslower relative to an object far away from gravity.\n\n\nThis effect has been measured. Time is running a little bit faster in space \nthan it is on Earth's surface. It is important to note: no local observer \nwill ever sense the effect because for Earth it is a TINY amount and all of \nan object's immediate surroundings will be slowed down just as much anyway \n(so the relative effect over distances needs to be measured). This slow \ndown of an object moving through time causes a speed up of the object \nthrough space. The energy has to be conserved somehow. This is the \nacceleration of gravity you feel. \n\n\nYour body and everything else is made up of little fields (per Quantum \nField Theory). Gravity has the effect of slowing down the bottom of the \nfields a little bit more than the top of the field. This creates a downward \nforce and as an object slows down through time relative to free space it \naccelerates. A very small slow down in time yields a huge speed up because \nC = space/time = 300,000,000 m/s.\n\n\nGravity is\n\n\n1) The warping (curving) of spacetime which causes an acceleration.\n\n\n2) Gravity should be caused by a gaviton and the gravity field it creates \nbut no theory of gravity has been proven.\n\n\n3) Gravity also warps space because v*t = d and c which is a constant has \nthe equation c*t = d so if t warps then so does d. When acceleration \nhappens c may not be a constant for the accelerating observer but the idea \nof space warping with time is still correct.\n\n\nBTW the \"exact\" understanding of anything in the natural world will never \nbe known. Scientists do seem to have some understanding of gravity but it's \nfar from complete.",

Light, gravity, radiation, electromagnetism, etc.  I assume that you \ndo not understand WHY the inverse square law applies to so many areas of \nphysics.  The reason is because things that have a radiating quality to \nthem radiate outward in spherical shapes.  If you measure the 'intensity' \nof a quantity along the surface of that imaginary sphere, you would find \nthat no matter how big that sphere is, the total magnitude is the same.  So \nif you take a square centimeter of a smaller sphere and compare that to a \nsquare cm of a larger sphere, the 'intensity' of that square cm will be \nsmaller on the larger sphere because it's taking up a smaller percentage of \nthe whole, right?  By what factor?  Well, by the same factor that the \nsurface area of that sphere increases.  That makes sense, right?  So what \nis the surface area of a sphere?  4\u03c0r\u00b2.  The term 4\u03c0 is constant, so the \nonly factor that matters is r\u00b2 or the radius squared.  The surface area \nincreases by a factor of the square of the radius, so the 'intensity' of \nthat square cm DECREASES by the same factor.

            "text": "It is a great debate opportunity that this site has created and my utmost \ngratitude is conveyed at first.\nSir Isaac Newton has explained only the physical parameters of the \nphenomenon called Gravity. The phenomenon is explained if only the \nmechanism behind 'how Gravity attracts things' is explained. And the \nscientists of the mediator period have made it more complex to become a \nparadox by their philosophic definitions which could never be proven \npractically or mathematically. I firmly believe Scientists of the 21st \ncentury can solve this paradox unless they really want to conserve it as a \nparadox for the future generations to solve. \n\nStudents of logical thinking should ask the questions; \n1. Why Gravity does only attract things and why it doesn't repel ? \n2. Why Gravity attract only 'atomic mass' and why not 'energy mass' like \nphoton, electrons, solar wind etc? \n\nBefore answering above questions we have to clarify 'what are the three \nfundamental space matter?' Soils, Liquids and gasses must be the sure \nanswer from a student of junior secondary level. But we know that are the \nthree phases of the atomic mass.Then what matter is electron's, light and \nheat etc? Do not they posses a mass? That category of matter has to be \nrecognized as 'Energy Mass'. Solar wind too belongs to that category \nbecause it is made up of weakly charged  energy particles emitted from Sun. \nThen what is the third category of fundamental space matter? It is the \n'Space Medium Matter'. The space is densely filled with this invisible \nstatic matter and it has a density and a pressure.\n\nNow only the mechanism of Gravity can be explained because the different \nbehaviour of energy waves and energy rays could not be distinguished until \na space medium of matter is accepted. Energy rays like light, heat X-ray \netc. dont need a medium to travel because they are line projection of \nenergy particles like photons. But waves such as, natural sounds, \nelectromagnetic FM or AM sounds, TV etc always need a medium to travel.\n\nGravity too is due to a medium wave and how could it born? \nPut a fly in to a calm water and you would observe tiny waves round and \nround. That is how atomic masses produce gravitational wave in the space \nmedium. A single atom can be considered as a rotary engine in which \nelectron clouds are rotating round the nucleus. Any rotary machine in the \nworld makes a vibration and a bigger collection of atomic mass makes a \nstronger vibration to transmit a stronger wave through the medium. That is \nhow the gravitational waves are born but how on earth it can attract \nanother mass?\n\nWhen the wave strike upon any secondary atom in the field, the rotating \nelectron cloud is a bit pushed more closer to the nucleus from the \ndirection at where the wave strikes from. Thence the Coulomb's \nelectromagnetic force at the side of wave strike becomes bigger and the \nresultant force makes the atom move towards the gravity source. Electrons \nand photons are not responded by gravity because they don't have internal \nrotary systems to be affected. \n\nOther most important thing is that, dynamic behaviour of gravitational \nfields has not yet even touched. Only the static gravitation was explained \nin Newtonian Mechanics.But you know Sun is rotating and its gravitational \nfield is not static at all. Therefore the gravity of Sun is deviated due to \nrotation and as a result an orbital motive force is applied upon planets to \norbit in the same direction of Suns rotation.\n\nHowever ultimately the credit of Gravity has to be shared with Coulomb too \nbecause his electromagnetism could explain the mechanism of so mysterious \nmagical force of gravity.  \ufeff",

            "text": "You can think of it in both ways.  In classical mechanics, it is a mutual \nforce between two objects of mass that is proportional to the product of \ntheir masses.  For the vast majority of situations you will probably ever \nencounter in your life, this works just fine.\n\nIn general relativity, gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space \ntime.  Both space itself and time itself are affected by the presence of \nenergy/momentum - including mass.  Not really a 'wrinkle' in space-time, \nbut that's not really important.\n\nIt might help if you understood a little bit about *why* Einstein concluded \nthat gravity could not be a force.\n\nHopefully, you remember a little about Newton's laws of motion.  \nSpecifically, the first law - which states that an object in motion will \nremain in motion unless an unbalanced force acts on it.  The law of \ninertia.  Also, it is important to understand that the physical laws of the \nuniverse are applicable in all inertial reference frames.  An inertial \nreference frame is a frame of reference where this first law applies.  In \nother words, if you are in a frame of reference, and an object undergoing \nno forces moves in a straight line with constant velocity, then you are in \nan inertial reference frame.  The reference frame itself is experiencing no \nforces and no accelerations.\n\nWhen you stand on the surface of the Earth and you hold a ball out with \nyour hand and let go, what happens?  The ball falls to the ground, right?  \nIn Newton's world, this is because a force acted on the ball - namely \nGravity. \n\nHowever, in Einstein's world, the opposite is happening.  Think about being \nin a rocket very far away from all gravitational sources where there are no \nforces acting on you.  Suppose that rocket fired its engines and \naccelerated (in any direction) at a constant 9.8 m/s\u00b2.  What would happen \nto you?  You would be pushed to one side of the rocket, right?  The side of \nthe rocket opposite the direction it was accelerating in.  If you held a \nball out of your hand, and let go - that ball would accelerate toward that \nend of the rocket at 9.8 m/s\u00b2 from your perspective because its not gravity \nthat is accelerating the ball toward the floor, but the rocket which is \naccelerating forward making it APPEAR that it is accelerating to the floor \nfrom your perspective.  Einstein concluded that there was no difference \nbetween standing firmly on the ground within a gravitational field and \nbeing in a rocket in deep space being accelerated at a rate equal to the \ngravitational acceleration at that point in that gravitational field.  \nThere is no experiment that you could perform that could differentiate \nbetween these two frames.  They are identical (locally).  Therefore, \nstanding on the surface of the Earth is actually accelerated motion.  \nConversely, there is no experiment you could perform that could \ndifferentiate between being far away in deep space floating inside a box, \nand being inside that same box while free falling in a gravitational \nfield.  There is no difference.  These two frames are identical.  If you \nfloat a ball inside a box where you, the ball, and the box are all free \nfalling inside a gravitational field, then that ball will perfectly obey \nthe law of inertia.  It will continue in a straight line with a constant \nvelocity - - - which means that free falling in a gravitational field is \ninertial motion - - and THAT means that there are no forces acting on that \nframe of reference.  Therefore, gravity can not be a force.\n\n\nThis can be demonstrated very clearly by astronauts in orbit around the \nEarth.  Notice that when they exert forces on objects, they just float away \nat a constant speed until they hit a wall, or some other object - or force \nacts on them.  These objects are following the law of inertia - which means \nthat the frame of reference they are in is inertial - or not accelerating.  \nAccording to Newton, free fall is accelerated motion caused by the force of \ngravity.  When you really understand the law of inertia, you can clearly \nsee that those astronauts free falling in orbit around the Earth are in an \ninertial reference frame, therefore not accelerating, and if they are not \naccelerating, then there are not forces acting on them.  Not even gravity.\n\n\nThese days, it is very clear that free fall is inertial motion, but in \nEinstein's time, people just didn't go around free falling, so it was \nactually a quite intuitive discovery to realize that free falling in a \ngravitational field is inertial motion and identical to having no forces \nacting on you.",

My way of visualizing it (although not completely \nfleshed out, at all) is that instead of a tennis ball growing in the center \nof the gelatin, the center of the gelatin disappears into itself (into \nnothing), creating a stretch moving toward that center.  This would cause \nthe grid lines to stretch in such a way (being sucked into the center) that \nallows for accurate coordinate measurements of the movement of objects in \nthe grid, (objects staying on a \"straight\" path) but following the \nelliptical curves of orbits as relative to the still perfectly square outer \nedges of the gelatin.  \n\nI think this represents a better, sort of \"low pressure area\" around the \ncenter of gravity rather than a \"high pressure area\" as in the tennis ball \nmodel, which may be arbitrary and could be countered by a formula to \nreverse the positive pressure to negative for calculating orbital behavior, \nbut the low pressure analogy helps to better visualize how things are \n\"sucked\" into a gravitational pull.  To my brain it just seems more logical.\n\nBut what is the grid disappearing into, you ask?  That's where the mystery \nof gravity starts to rear it head, but I like to think of the grid being \nsucked into the center of gravity, and then manifesting itself back into \nthe grid as a small, very dense and compacted \"grid lines \" immediately \nsurrounding the center point.  Different densities of course for different \nmaterials would determine how big the sphere would extend beyond the center \nback into space of the grid.  Imagine the previously regularly spaced grid \nlines turning into tightly packed strata forming a solid sphere, while the \ngrid lines outside the sphere are being pulled into it, and are more \nstretched the closer they are to the sphere.  \n\nPractically, the outside grid becomes sphere strata at the outer surface of \nthe shell (accretion) and the more layers, the higher the gravity, but the \ntheoretical lines of the grid continue to the center, where one could \nimagine they become strata from the inside, at the center of gravity.  In \nthis way we can still visualize the forces, and use these coordinates for \ncalculations.\n\nAnother question is: what is the difference between the outer grid and the \ncompacted strata, besides it's density?  Is it all still \"grid\", or does \nthe nature of the \"grid\" change when it becomes strata?  Does the grid \nitself attract other parts of the grid, but is only noticeable when reaches \nthe event horizon of becoming strata?  Is the gelatin itself \"potential \nmatter\"?\n\nThese last questions might betray my ignorance of the subject...",

A and B.  A is proportional to B.  If B \nincrease by a factor of 'x', then A also increases by a factor of 'x'.  The \nfactor is what you are *multiplying* B by.  If the value for B is 10 and \nincreased by a factor of 7, then B is 7 times what it was before, so 70.  \nIf A is proportional to B, then A is ALSO increased by a factor of 7.\n\nInversely proportional just means that the value DECREASES as the OTHER \nvalue increases, so taking the same two things, A and B, if A is inversely \nproportional to B, and B is increased by a factor of 7, then A is DECREASED \nby the same factor, and you DIVIDE by that factor\n\n\"I also didn't understand what you meant by things radiating out in a \nsphere shape, does that mean that everything radiates in a sphere shape?\"\n\n\"Why is the source of gravity at the center?\"\n\nI didn't say that things radiate outward in a spherical shape.  I said it \nis ok to think about it like that.\n\nThere is a force of gravity between any two particles of mass.  Two specs \nof dust have a gravitational attraction toward one another.  There is a \ngravitational attraction between you and a pencil.  There is a \ngravitational attraction between you and a rock in Australia.  There is a \ngravitational attraction between you and a tree in California.  There is a \ngravitational attraction between you and every spec and particle of mass \nthat make up the Earth.  However, since the Earth is more or less a sphere, \nand the density is relatively uniform (at least from the same distance to \nthe center - meaning the density of the material at 'x' distance to the \ncenter is uniform), then the sum of all those forces net to the center of \nmass of the Earth.  There is nothing particularly interesting or remarkable \nAT the center of the Earth that is causing gravity.  The mass of the entire \nEarth is causing it, and the net force (the sum of all the forces between \nyou and every particle of mass of the Earth) points toward the center.  If \nyou are sitting on ice and you have a friend push you from behind and a \nfriend push you to the left at the same time, you will go kind of \ndiagonally, right?  That's because that diagonal direction is the SUM of \nthe two forces.  The same applies to the Earth, and they figured out a long \ntime ago that rather than actually figure out what all the individual \nforces (there would be billions of them) between some object and every \nparticle of mass of a celestial object, if that celestial object is a \nsphere (and they all are pretty much), then it is a lot easier to skip that \nstep and assume that the net force is toward the center of the celestial \nobject, and rather than consider that celestial object as a collection of a \nbunch of different forces added together, they just consider it as a point \nmass (an infinitely small point in space) that originates at the center of \nmass of a celestial object that contains the entire mass of that celestial \nobject.\n\nNow, we all now that it is not LITERALLY a point mass that originates at \nthe center that contains the entire mass of the celestial object, but it is \nOK to think about it like that because there is no difference.  It might as \nwell be, and it makes all the calculations FAR easier.\n\nThe same thing applies to the notion that you can think of gravity as a \nsphere that radiates outward.  It doesn't literally do that, but \nmathematically it does, and it makes the calculations a lot easier to think \nabout it like that.\n\n\"Why does the increase in radius determine the surface area increase, and \nwhy at that factor.\"\n\nSince it is OK to think about the force of gravity as a sphere radiating \noutward from the center of the Earth, then we can ignore the Earth to \nanswer this question, and only think about the geometry of a sphere.\n\nThe radius of a sphere is the distance between the center of that sphere \nand the surface of that sphere.  Isn't it common sense that if the radius \nincreases, then the surface area increases?  A basketball has a larger \nsurface area than a baseball.  The Earth has a larger surface area than the \nmoon.\n\nWhy at that factor?  Because that's just how the geometry of a sphere \nworks.  I already talked about this.  The equation to determine the surface \narea of a sphere is 4\u03c0r\u00b2.  The 'r' in that equation is the radius of a \nsphere.  Just do the math.  What if r = 1m?\n\n4 * \u03c0 * 1\u00b2\n4 * 3.14 * 1 * 1 = 12.56m\u00b2\n\nWhat if you double 'r' and make it 2m?\n\n4 * 3.14 * 2 * 2 = 50.24m\u00b2 (4 times 12.56)\n\nWhat if you triple 'r' and make it 3m?\n\n4 * 3.14 * 3 * 3 = 113.04m\u00b2 (9 times 12.56)\n\nAs you can see, the surface area of that sphere is increasing in proportion \nto the SQUARE of the radius because the SQUARE of the radius determines the \nsurface area of that sphere.  When the radius is twice as much (2X), the \nsurface area increases by a factor of 4 (which is 2\u00b2).  When the radius is \n3 times as much (3X), then the surface area is increased by a factor of 9 \n(3\u00b2).  If you increased the radius by a factor of 123, then the surface \narea would increase by a factor of 123\u00b2.  This making sense?\n\nHave you ever seen a balloon that had something printed on it, and when you \nblew it up, the picture or words spread out over the balloon, but as it \nspread out as the balloon got bigger, the ink did not appear to be as \ndark?  The reason for this is because you are spreading out that ink over a \nlarger area.  It's the same amount of ink as it was before you began \nblowing up a balloon.  Now, gravity doesn't literally work this way, but \nyou CAN think of it this way to understand this problem.  The amount of \ngravity that is on the outside of that balloon is exactly the same no \nmatter how big the balloon is - - just like the ink in my example.  The \nbigger the balloon gets, the 'lighter' gravity gets just like the lighter \nthe ink gets.\n\nNow, let's just give an arbitrary value to the gravity on that balloon.  \n1,000.  The entire surface of the balloon has a gravitational force of \n1,000 (units aren't important because this is a purely mathematical \nconcept).\n\nNow, when our sphere earlier had a radius of 1 m, the surface area of that \nsphere was 12.56 m\u00b2.  So, the force of gravity over that entire sphere is \n1,000 no matter how big the sphere is remember?  How would that be spread \nover that sphere?\n\nYou'd just DIVIDE the surface area by the 'force'.  So\n\n1,000 / 12.56 = 79.6 units of gravity per meter\u00b2\n\nWhat about the sphere with a radius of 2 m?  Remember, it had a surface \narea of 50.24m\u00b2.\n\nWell, remember, the force of gravity over that whole surface is the same, \nso still 1,000\n\n1,000 / 50.24 = 19.9 units of gravity per meter\u00b2\n\nRadius of 3?\n\n1,000 / 113.04 = 8.85 units of gravity per meter\u00b2\n\nNow, this isn't actually how it works.  I'm just trying to explain why the \nmath works the way it does.\n\nThink of the \"units of gravity per meter\" as the local force due to \ngravity, and that force is inversely proportional to the SQUARE of the \nradius.\n\nWhen the radius was 1, the local gravity was 79.6.\n\nWhen the radius was 2 (2X) the local gravity was 19.9 (79.6/2\u00b2)\n\nWhen the radius was 3 (3X) the local gravity was 8.8 (79.6/3\u00b2).\n\nAll this being said, and I know it is a lot.  You might not be ready.  It's \ncool that you want to know all of this stuff before you are taught in \nschool, but don't get frustrated if you don't understand it.  The fact that \nyou are asking these question at what I assume to be a fairly early age is \ntestament to the fact that you are already ahead of 95% of other people \nyour age.  I'm not a teacher.  So, just because you don't understand me \ndoesn't mean that you can't understand it.  It's quite possible that I am a \npoor teacher!!!!",

If you triple the \ndistance, the force is 1/9 of what it was.  If you quadruple the distance, \nthe force is 1/16 of what it was.  On and on and on.  The force of gravity \nis *inversely* proportional to the square of the distance.  If the distance \nis 5, the proportional factor is 25, and since it is INVERSELY \nproportional, you DIVIDE by 25.  If you make your distance 10 times as far \naway, the force is 1/100 of what it was.\n\nAs for WHY so many things follow the inverse square law, well, gravity, \nluminosity, and other energetic 'things' that follow the inverse square law \ncan be thought about as radiating outward in a sphere-like shape - so think \nabout the surface area of that sphere - which is 4\u03c0r\u00b2.  So as gravity gets \nfarther from the source, it is spreading out over an area of that sphere \nthat is increasing in proportion to the square of the radius of the sphere \n- - ergo, the intensity decreases in proportion to the square of the radius.\n\nIn other words, if you increase the radius of a sphere by 'x', the surface \narea increases by a factor of x\u00b2.  If you assume that the surface area \nrepresents a magnitude of some force which remains constant no matter how \nbig the sphere gets, then at any point locally on that sphere, the \nmagnitude of that force is inversely proportional to the square of the \nradius.  Gravity works the same way.
