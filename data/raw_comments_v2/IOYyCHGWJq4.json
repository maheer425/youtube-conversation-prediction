It can attempt to predict, \nbecause it thinks, but in its reality, the cat is possibly dead and \npossibly alive, so in the mind's realm of existence, it is dead and alive \nat the same time.\n\nSo the observer's mind is not made up until it is able to receive \ninformation that states otherwise. It requires our senses to alter its own \nreality...\n\nSo this dilemma here... you put a cat in a bunker with the explosive \nwhatever... you know it's either dead or alive, to you it's both dead and \nalive until proven otherwise, because neither have been proven not true. If \nwe were 4th Dimensional beings, we would be able to \"see\" the cat in it's \ncurrent state, and we would know, because we could see in the 3 dimensions. \nWe could see what was on the other side of the walls.\n\nSo... the 3D beings that we are, are really just the mind of the 4D beings \nthat we exist with, just as our 2D minds are within our 3D selves.
