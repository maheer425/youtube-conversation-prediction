But my knowledge of the world \nnowadays suggests that what she is campaigning for is Egalitarianism, equal \nsocial and civil rights for men and women. Who could do anything generally \nwithout fear of social or civil unacceptance. Using the term Feminism \nnowadays generally suggests to people that you are campaigning for MORE \nrights for women. (Which would end up with MORE rights for women then men) \nThis is why so many people have so many different reactions. If this was \ncalled \"We should all be Egalitarianism.\" This would be more accepted as \nmany are bought up to see feminism as unacceptable, sexist, extremist and \ngenerally unaccepting to men, similar to a black person joining the KKK.

            "text": "1: More men aren't being sent to jail because women are seen as weaker if \nthat were the case we wouldn't see men instantly arrested for the slight \npossibility of crime. The reason is because feminism demonizes men making \nthem seem like the bad guys running around beating women and r@ping them.\n*Men being arrested instantly has less to do with sexims against men and \nmore to do with racism against minorities*\n\n2: Women do not pay more for cars or repairs they are charged the same. \nThey do pay less for car insurance because more men crash than women per \nyear however this is largely due to the fact that women drive less than men \nand so more men are recorded as crashing. Despite this men do not get to \npay less for health insurance despite women racking up a larger hospital \nbill than men on average.\n*in the recent past there was gender pricing, that was gotten rid of but \nthe areas that allow for haggling, like cars dealership (Ayres did a study \nthat was updated several times with similar results) , leave women paying \nmore than men. Also in repair shops women are more often pressured into \nunnecessary repairs therefore they do pay more in repairs. And there are \nactually more female drivers than men, but men clock more miles behind the \nwheel*\n\n3: Women win law suit cases not because they are seen as more in need but \nbecause the man is seen as less important than the women and therefore he \nis excepted to man it up while the woman enjoys the benefits something \nfeminism actively promotes by making women into victims in need of support.\n\n*Women win lawsuits because men are seen as the provider and women the \nprovided for. In this system men aren't allowed to be weak or needy and \nsince that's not humanly possible to be completely independent those men \nwho fall too short of societal expectations are left to fend for themselves*\n \n\n4: You say men do not deserve a voice in abortion because they themselves \nweren't pregnant yet they are still affected by said pregnancy through \nchild support and reproductive rights. Despite this feminism continues to \nattack men who try to gain a voice spamming the phrase \"no uterus no \nopinion\".\n\n*Am saying that child support if you  aren't rich isn't what many make it \nout to be. The average cost of raising a child from birth to 18 is $245340 \n(and that's basic needs) the average child support payment is $430 over 18 \nyears that's $92880 that's $152460 coming from the mother and since she's \nthe one expected to care for the child and in many cases the father wants \nnothing to do with the child so she doesn't have much of a choice. But \nother cost such as the pregnancy itself isn't factored in which depending \non how well the pregnancy goes and if you have insurance can cost anywhere \nbetween $2000- $250000 (that number of course is the very extreme). Women \ndeserve more of a say in abortion because it's their bodies, and they are \nthe ones who are more affected physically, mentally, emotionally and \nfinancially by a pregancy.*\n\n\n5: You say that women are expected to raise the kids therefore they win the \nkids in custodies but that doesn't change the fact that it is a benefit to \nthem as they are not required to do so but get the benefit of it while the \nman is seen as less able and not a good parent which is another stereotype \nfeminism creates by lowering the value of what it means to be a father as \nthey do not have the same organs as a woman.\n\n*Yes it benefits women in the same way that female murders benefited from \nbelieves that women couldn't commit murder. I'm not saying it's right I'm \nsaying a few advantages brought on by oppression does not mean that the \noppressed have it better. That's like saying that slaves benefited from \nslavery because they had food, clothing and shelter while homeless white \npeople starved. Yes women are stereotyped as caregivers and men are \nstereotyped as incapable but what system encouraged these \nstereotypes.....let me give you it wasn't feminism*\n\n6: Again you only bring in more positive sexism for women as they receive \nthe benefits of being seen as more delecate when it benefits them and just \na able then it benefits them which is another example of how feminism only \nattacks issues to make women stronger while leaving men behind.\n\n*Feminism isn't leaving men behind it try to allow women to catch up*\n\n\n7: No women and feminists are not protesting to be forced into the military \nand be sent to the front lines they are protesting to be allowed to do so \nwhen they want to. So when men are FORCED to go and die on the front lines \nwomen can simply say hey I want to go fight and at any time leave the front \non her on time. The reason there is so opposition to this is because a \nsquad of soldiers is often only as strong as their weakest member and women \naren't able to pass many of the physical requirements to join so they \nlowered the bar allowing women to fight along man is going to increase the \ndeath toll. Yet despite many female soldiers stating that they don't want \nto be encouraged to join these squads feminists are lobbying to have them \nbe provided incentives.\n\n*Today the draft only exist on paper (so I don't know why you are screaming \nabout men being forced to die)  mainly because of the high volume of women \nwho volunteer for service, when drafts were used women weren't allowed to \nserve. And women have been fighting  for years to be allowed to served \nequally across all fields, and when protesting for the rights they don't \nask that test be lighten for their benefit women who want to serve what to \nmeet the same requirements as the men and if  they don't meet the \nrequirement then 'oh well' the problem was (recently changed) that they \nweren't even allowed to try. *\n\n\n8: So your response to men having higher workpalce death is that they are \nstronger and therefore take the physical jobs that would cause such death \ndespite feminism stating that this is not the case.\n\n*Show me where feminist say that men aren't stronger? We acknowledge \nbiologically differences, like men are generally strong and that women can \ngive birth, but we acknowledge that there is very little difference when it \ncomes to overall intelligences and ability to function in ta modern society* \n \n\n9: You say that the reason men have high suicide is because they are told \nnot to express emotion but this is not the case men are often pushed to \nexpress emotion even if they don't want to all the time especially by \nfeminists and women. The top reasons for suicide is due to relationships \nwith others and becaus this is a gendered issue against men this means that \nrelationships between men and women are dramatically set against men.\n\n*15-29 year old men (who've actually had a decrease) are often lead to \nsuicide by emasculating bullying by other man and often after making a \ndramatic change to themselves or experimenting with their sexuality.  The \ndefinition of manly (as defined by men) has become a smaller and smaller \nbox to fit in and those who can't, won't or don't fit in are punished not \nby feminist but by other men. That pair with the more impulsive nature \nleads to suicide. the rates then spike in 40s when financially burdens that \nmen are expected to deal with usually arrive and then again around 65 when \nthere's retirement to think about all stressful times that men aren't \nallowed to express as stressful for fear of not being maly* \n\n\n10: You say that expression is what makes people happy but the overall \nhappiness of women while still higher than men is falling an they are more \nstrongly encouraged to express emotion today than they ever were and this \nis largely considered to be due to the fact that women are now forced to \ntake the roles of men as men are being feminized by feminism.\n\n*Yes they are strongly encouraged to express emotion by feminist and other \nequal rights group but there is still an expectation for them to keep it \nin, thoses that are more expressive and manage to avoid the bullying grow \ninto confident happy adults.*\n\n\n11: No the wage gap is not 10% it is 0% in all fields for it is illegal to \npay one worker more for the same job as it is another worker. The wage gap \ndoes exist against men though in jobs such as modelling or porn, or if you \ninclude working units as opposed to working hours as men do more work in an \nhour then women.\n*Pay in many fields is negotiated, while cashiers at your local grocery \nstore might receive the same pay across the board doctors, lawyers, \nscientists, corporate workers negotiated pay. Also those laws only go into \neffect if the woman knows and can prove that she wasn't being paid fairly a \nfact that many don't find out until way later. Also women are more likely \nto be passed over for raises.*\n\n\n\n12: You do not see a relevance of women spending mens money which is what \nthey are doing as the men earn more money and women spend more money. This \nis largely due to the fact that men are expected to pay for everything \nwhile women aren't even expected to bring a wallet wherever they go. \nFeminists are constantly saying that they want the option to pay but still \nexpect the man to be required.\n\n*Women spend more money because our stuff cost more, on average men out \nspend women on food, entertainment and alcohol but all of that is pretty \nclose (in clothing cost came down to less than one hundred dollars \ndifference) but women pass men and end up spending more when it comes to \npersonal products like soap, face wash, supplements, pain medication, \ntampons yeast infection medication , pads, liners, bras, etc.....*\n\n\n13: You contradict yourself here saying boys are expected to be more \nexpressive despite earlier you saying they aren't. Not only this but the \ndifference isn't due to the rowdiness but due to the way teachers punish \nstudents and teach content. Boys learns better when provided visual cues \nsuch as charts, graphs, structurally content, and hands on learning. \nDespite this teachers prefer to use text books and group interactions that \nbenefit girls. Combine with the fact that social interactions are \nencouraged but physical interactions and individualism is not in school \nhurt boys in believing that the way they want to naturally behave is wrong. \nAlso the education system in female dominated with most teachers and staff \nbeing women.\n\n*Boys are allowed to be more expressive as in energetic and outspoken not \nemotionally, (I didn't contradict I just couldn't think of a different word \nto use at the time). And well i'm not disagreeing that many boys tend to be \nvisual doesn't mean that teachers are favoring girls. Textbooks were used \nlong before girls were even allowed a formal education, you can argue that \nteachers aren't being for creative but I don't see how you're making an \nargument that they are discriminating against boys. Education particularly \nin the younger age  groups was a job that were deemed suitable for women \nand were an area that many didn't get any push back from when trying to \npursue so doesn't surprise me that there are more women. *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------I'll added more later its 2:40am------\n\n14: Well the women score higher on SAT is actually a lie as boys score \nhigher than them because the SAT uses a standardized testing system and is \nfree of teacher bias against boys so despite boys not doing well in a \nfemale dominated education system they show that they are indeed smarter in \nan unbiased test. The 62% + 48% does not equal 100% and the female to male \nratio in colleges is due almost entirely to female only scholarships and \nfamilies forcing the boys to enter the workforce out of high school to \nprovide.The reason women receive less money despite getting more education \nis because they go for majors in things like English and art history or \ncommunication such are not useful majors. The women who do get good majors \noften want social jobs that are easy and don't require alot of hard work \nreducing the pay of the job itself these are teaching jobs, social workers, \nor family doctors, nurses, etc.\n\n\n15: No women are not dissuaded from math and science they are encouraged by \na huge number of female only scholarships in those fields and programs \ndesigned to push women into those fields the problem is they don't like \nmath and science but men do. This is a natural response as men prefer \nabsolute numbers and women social interactions. Despite his women still \nreceive massive benefits and try to invade the last fields that men are the \nmajority.

            "text": "+Cangel Tibon \n1: More men aren't being sent to jail because women are seen as weaker if \nthat were the case we wouldn't see men instantly arrested for the slight \npossibility of crime. The reason is because feminism demonizes men making \nthem seem like the bad guys running around beating women and r@ping them.\n\n\n2: Women do not pay more for cars or repairs they are charged the same. \nThey do pay less for car insurance because more men crash than women per \nyear however this is largely due to the fact that women drive less than men \nand so more men are recorded as crashing. Despite this men do not get to \npay less for health insurance despite women racking up a larger hospital \nbill than men on average.\n\n\n3: Women win law suit cases not because they are seen as more in need but \nbecause the man is seen as less important than the women and therefore he \nis excepted to man it up while the woman enjoys the benefits something \nfeminism actively promotes by making women into victims in need of support.\n\n\n4: You say men do not deserve a voice in abortion because they themselves \nweren't pregnant yet they are still affected by said pregnancy through \nchild support and reproductive rights. Despite this feminism continues to \nattack men who try to gain a voice spamming the phrase \"no uterus no \nopinion\".\n\n\n5: You say that women are expected to raise the kids therefore they win the \nkids in custodies but that doesn't change the fact that it is a benefit to \nthem as they are not required to do so but get the benefit of it while the \nman is seen as less able and not a good parent which is another stereotype \nfeminism creates by lowering the value of what it means to be a father as \nthey do not have the same organs as a woman.\n\n\n6: Again you only bring in more positive sexism for women as they receive \nthe benefits of being seen as more delecate when it benefits them and just \na able then it benefits them which is another example of how feminism only \nattacks issues to make women stronger while leaving men behind.\n\n\n7: No women and feminists are not protesting to be forced into the military \nand be sent to the front lines they are protesting to be allowed to do so \nwhen they want to. So when men are FORCED to go and die on the front lines \nwomen can simply say hey I want to go fight and at any time leave the front \non her on time. The reason there is so opposition to this is because a \nsquad of soldiers is often only as strong as their weakest member and women \naren't able to pass many of the physical requirements to join so they \nlowered the bar allowing women to fight along man is going to increase the \ndeath toll. Yet despite many female soldiers stating that they don't want \nto be encouraged to join these squads feminists are lobbying to have them \nbe provided incentives.\n\n\n8: So your response to men having higher workpalce death is that they are \nstronger and therefore take the physical jobs that would cause such death \ndespite feminism stating that this is not the case.\n\n\n9: You say that the reason men have high suicide is because they are told \nnot to express emotion but this is not the case men are often pushed to \nexpress emotion even if they don't want to all the time especially by \nfeminists and women. The top reasons for suicide is due to relationships \nwith others and becaus this is a gendered issue against men this means that \nrelationships between men and women are drastically set against men.\n\n\n10: You say that expression is what makes people happy but the overall \nhappiness of women while still higher than men is falling an they are more \nstrongly encouraged to express emotion today than they ever were and this \nis largely considered to be due to the fact that women are now forced to \ntake the roles of men as men are being feminized by feminism.\n\n\n11: No the wage gap is not 10% it is 0% in all fields for it is illegal to \npay one worker more for the same job as it is another worker. The wage gap \ndoes exist against men though in jobs such as modelling or porn, or if you \ninclude working units as opposed to working hours as men do more work in an \nhour then women.\n\n\n12: You do not see a relevance of women spending mens money which is what \nthey are doing as the men earn more money and women spend more money. This \nis largely due to the fact that men are expected to pay for everything \nwhile women aren't even expected to bring a wallet wherever they go. \nFeminists are constantly saying that they want the option to pay but still \nexpect the man to be required.\n\n\n13: You contradict yourself here saying boys are expected to be more \nexpressive despite earlier you saying they aren't. Not only this but the \ndifference isn't due to the rowdiness but due to the way teachers punish \nstudents and teach content. Boys learns better when provided visual cues \nsuch as charts, graphs, structurally content, and hands on learning. \nDespite this teachers prefer to use text books and group interactions that \nbenefit girls. Combine with the fact that social interactions are \nencouraged but physical interactions and individualism is not in school \nhurt boys in believing that the way they want to naturally behave is wrong. \nAlso the education system in female dominated with most teachers and staff \nbeing women.\n\n\n14: Well the women score higher on SAT is actually a lie as boys score \nhigher than them because the SAT uses a standardized testing system and is \nfree of teacher bias against boys so despite boys not doing well in a \nfemale dominated education system they show that they are indeed smarter in \nan unbiased test. The 62% + 48% does not equal 100% and the female to male \nratio in colleges is due almost entirely to female only scholarships and \nfamilies forcing the boys to enter the workforce out of high school to \nprovide.The reason women receive less money despite getting more education \nis because they go for majors in things like English and art history or \ncommunication such are not useful majors. The women who do get good majors \noften want social jobs that are easy and don't require alot of hard work \nreducing the pay of the job itself these are teaching jobs, social workers, \nor family doctors, nurses, etc.\n\n\n15: No women are not dissuaded from math and science they are encouraged by \na huge number of female only scholarships in those fields and programs \ndesigned to push women into those fields the problem is they don't like \nmath and science but men do. This is a natural response as men prefer \nabsolute numbers and women social interactions. Despite his women still \nreceive massive benefits and try to invade the last fields that men are the \nmajority. Yet you do not see men receiving scholarships and programs to \nenter female dominated fields.\n\n\n16: No feminism does not seek to change the way men are forced to provide \nin relationships as feminists consistently state that they expect men to \npay for everything but want to reserve to right to pay when they want to. \nAn feminism has only made it harder to approach women to ask on dates or \nmake the first move by claiming that such things are acts of rape or sexual \nharassment.\n\n\n17: No men are not more likely to sexually cheat that is still women the \nmajority reason men cheat is for sex and women because men would pay enough \nattention to them. Women cheat more than men in all relational aspects both \nsex, emotion, finance, etc.\n\n\n18: No feminism has done more against male victims of abuse by attacking \nmen who enter victims of abuse spaces and facilities by saying having men \nin those facilities oppresses female victims. They also attack male \nfacilities saying that it is sexist to have such facilities and constantly \ntry to undermine their experience because it lowers the value of their \nwomen are always victims campaniles.\n\n\n19: No feminism is seeking to increase female finance not make her the \nprimary bread winner they still want men to give their money to the family \nbut for women to keep their money for themselves. This is something many \nfeminists take issue with as it contradicts two of their beliefs as they \nwill be forced to pay for more eventually if they continue to push the \nissue so many feminists ignore this issue and call for men to still pay.\n\n\n20: So your counter for female only gyms existing and males only ones not \nis that there are some gyms that aren't female only by that logic female \ngyms should not exist either but feminists do not attack those gyms like \nthey have gyms that tried to be male only.\n\n\n21: So your counter for men depicted as villains is that they are seen as \nbeing villains and women are not.

            "text": "Noooo were sick and tired of your socialist vacuuming programs that we pay \nfor ! The whole entire welfare class in America are women, and our taxes \nand families are punished while womens failures and irresponsible behavior \nis rewarded. Why should successful responsible family's pay for the single \nmom lifestyle? Why the hell do we have to pay for state housing because of \nwomens poor choices? Why do women scream equality but still want to be \ntreated as children of the state? Where is your liability? Its funny how \nwomen and feminists want so called equality but would rather sit behind a \ndesk and do anything to deflect manual labor and then want to claim the \nsame wages as manual labors who take extream amount of risk. Its also funny \nhow they deflect liabilities and responsibility for thier choices and put \nthem on men. Even child support is always initiated by dead beat women who \nwant money for 18 to 25 years for children from some one else's labor and \ndemand all the benefits of the child but refuse to be responsible for the \nfinancial upbringing of the child in which they demand custody of . Dead \nbeat moms, and dead beat wives want alimony , child support , welfare, and \nfood stamps from everyone one else making ton upon tons of false claims of \nabuse to children or themselves by men , and deploy social demonization \ntactics to gain a targeted groups money which equals labor which equals \nslavery, its what hitler did to jews, mande the fina e thier own demise and \ntyrannical treatment. Feminism is the biggest lie ever told to society, \nthat uses social demonization to steal and extract resources from other \npeople which is disgusting by act and criminal in nature. They sit there \nand claim that men enslave them when it is quite the contrary, most men are \npaying for women with thier taxes and labors , while men never usually ask \nfor hand outs and demand them through selfish entitlements. They claim men \nare the source of violence, when international studies show that women are \n3.2 %more likely to inact violence tward men and children, and are the \ncause of violently learned behavior in children. Women are also more likely \nto provoke violence and combative behaviors. On the job men are 26% more \nlikely to die or suffer debilitating injurys, and permanently induced \nhealth issues by chemical exposure. In the labor field data shows that \nwomen don't want to work these jobs , and if they are classified as a \nworker in these fields tnay are more likely to be in an office or hold a \nclerical position, and not desire to be in the labor field of the industry. \nAdults learn violence from thier child hood , and your average women will \nstrike a child 980 times a year and if the child is a male the number \nincreases to 2800 times a year, but women claim no connection to violence \nin society. A male is 7 times less likely to strike a child than a woman, \nour lash out in harsh vocal attacks tward children. Feminism by all data \nand all thier claims is proven lie, and the data and evidence proves it , \nfeminism is a concocted social indoctrinated fraud , that falsifies \nstatistics and data, using social demonization tactics for the gain of \npolitical power and the transfer of resources from a targeted group to a \nself proclaimed privileged group. Ther is no feminism , only a forever \nexpanding welfare class that is dependent on the extraction of resources \nand labor from a a group of people who they consider to be thier liable \nparents, and like children hold those un seen parents a liable and \nresponsible for thier existence while refusing to exept the demands of \nthose parents and recommendations on how to spend the resources that are \ntaken by force from thier hands in a selfish theft like manner , and when \nthey don't get what they want , they employ the false politically correct \nsocial demonization tactics to criminalize the very people in which they \nsteal from. Feminists are the equivalent of a selfish spoiled rotten child \nwho beats thier old parents until the give them what they want, and they \nwill forever demand more and more from the males they target and the \nfamilies they target to extract labor from and thats slavery and attempting \nsubjugation of free individuals, by the use of a mafia extortion like \npractice, employing government as thier extortion enforcement to take by \nforce from free individuals. \ufeff",

This is for the personal \nchoices they make. They do not strive for higher paying jobs, and they do \nnot work as many hours as men. Also, women are limited physically in \ncomparison to men, as I've stated, and therefore don't compete well in job \nfields that require physical labor. So, if a person, in this case a woman, \ndoesn't perform the same they should not get paid the same.\n\nWomen have more pressure to marry early because it's biologically favorable \nfor the inaccurate reasons you've mentioned. Men don't have this pressure. \nBut let's be clear, this double standard is not a social construct. It is a \nnatural construct.\n\nWith regard to IQ, I kindly suggest you grasp a clear understanding of what \nIQ is and what it tests. A person's IQ has little to do with environmental \nfactors. It's mainly genetic, on order of 70-80% worth. IQ has little to do \nwith acquired knowledge. You cannot learn your way to a higher IQ. Current \ndata still shows men having higher and lower IQ than women. This \ninformation is out there for everyone to verify. Please do the research \nyourself and you'll see.\n\nSurely we could be selective about which truths we teach our children. But \nshouldn't we teach the whole truth? Wouldn't anything less be a great \ndisservice? We could easily teach just the reproductive differences between \nthe sexes, but we'd be turning a blind eye to reality.

            "text": "This won't make everyone question who they are/what they believe. One \ncomponent she doesn't speak on (that many of the feminists I've heard do \nnot speak on) is how a wholly feminist philosophy, should it be adopted by \na community/world, would realistically affect gender. The assumption is, \n\"It will get better.\" and, \"In X years [she said 50/100] things will \nchange.\" But how? She doesn't speak on it, but from what I've heard, \nfeminist deny the pre-gendered nature of sex. There are studies that show \npsychological propensities for behavior from a biologically standpoint (to \nwhich feminists would either deny or state that such occurrences are not \ngendered in nature [or something else]).\n\nUnfortunately, talking as though guys are, by in large, the problem, and \nthat women are the victims fails to promote positive, egalitarian \ndiscussion. The only time she switched her positioning of \"woman\" and \"men\" \nwas at the end when she was \"recruiting\" men to be feminist (an active and \ncreative choice on her part as the audience noticed [granted I might missed \na few...but \"few\" is the key word]). A holistic approach, to which her \npresentation did not completely omit, would have included scenarios where \nwomen derail feminist ideals (to which the argument goes that they are \nslaves of the system denying that a woman can systematically oppose \nfeminist ideals [not all arguments, but the one most prevalent]). I'm not \nconvinced that feminism is the solution to the \"gender problem\" when \nfeminist philosophy does not address real concerns with feminist philosophy \nor when such rhetoric takes shape of saying \"X is always bad. Y is better.\" \nwhen realistically X can be great (non-feminist philosophy is not wrong by \ndefault; to say such a thing does not promote the apparent egalitarianistic \nstance required by feminists to allow a society that chooses to be gendered \nto exist in a mutually, beneficial environment [such a place may not exist \nconsidering feminist ideology]). Regarding my parenthetical text, such \nrhetoric is the target of the layMAN whom dismiss feminist discourse as \n\"guy-bashing/bra-burning\".\n\nNone of my statements are motivated by my stance on whether or not she was \n\"good/bad\" or if I am for or against feminism. I'm persuaded by a holistic \ndiscourse. Hers was thought-provoking presentation to be sure (though that \nreally depends on how aware one is to the role gender plays in her life, a \npoint she states in her presentation). It was a great presentation. I'm \ncurious to know her motivations for her monologue/dialog.\n\nSome take-aways for me:\n1. Notice gender-in-the-world more (not only in my life, but the lives of \nothers. This means I need to talk to more people about this subject.)\n2. Examine how I participate in gender and how I promote/demote it.\n3. Talk about gender. (I never talk about it.)\ufeff",
