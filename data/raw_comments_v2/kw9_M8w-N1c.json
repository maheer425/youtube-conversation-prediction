            "text": "The Book of the Dragonborn\nby Prior Emelene Madrine\nOrder of Talos\nWeynon Priory\nA treatise on the Dragonborn\nYear 360 of the Third Era, Twenty-First of the Reign of His Majesty \nPelagius IV\nMany people have heard the term \"Dragonborn\" - we are of course ruled by \nthe \"Dragonborn Emperors\" - but the true meaning of the term is not \ncommonly understood. For those of us in the Order of Talos, this is a \nsubject near and dear to our hearts, and in this book I will attempt to \nilluminate the history and significance of those known as Dragonborn down \nthrough the ages.\nMost scholars agree that the term was first used in connection with the \nCovenant of Akatosh, when the blessed St. Alessia was given the Amulet of \nKings and the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One were first lit. \n\"Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood \nfrom his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and \nmade a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the \ndragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion, \nand to deny the armies of daedra and undead to their enemies, the \nDaedra-loving Ayleids.\" Those blessed by Akatosh with \"the dragon blood\" \nbecame known more simply as Dragonborn.\nThe connection with the rulers of the Empire was thus there from the \nbeginning - only those of the dragon blood were able to wear the Amulet of \nKings and light the Dragonfires. All the legitimate rulers of the Empire \nhave been Dragonborn - the Emperors and Empresses of the first Cyrodilic \nEmpire founded by Alessia; Reman Cyrodiil and his heirs; and of course \nTiber Septim and his heirs, down to our current Emperor, His Majesty \nPelagius Septim IV.\nBecause of this connection with the Emperors, however, the other \nsignificance of the Dragonborn has been obscured and largely forgotten by \nall but scholars and those of us dedicated to the service of the blessed \nTalos, Who Was Tiber Septim. Very few realize that being Dragonborn is not \na simple matter of heredity - being the blessing of Akatosh Himself, it is \nbeyond our understanding exactly how and why it is bestowed. Those who \nbecome Emperor and light the Dragonfires are surely Dragonborn - the proof \nis in the wearing of the Amulet and the lighting of the Fires. But were \nthey Dragonborn and thus able to do these things - or was the doing the \nsign of the blessing of Akatosh descending upon them? All that we can say \nis that it is both, and neither - a divine mystery.\nThe line of Septims have all been Dragonborn, of course, which is one \nreason the simplistic notion of it being hereditary has become so \ncommonplace. But we know for certain that the early Cyrodilic rulers were \nnot all related. There is also no evidence that Reman Cyrodiil was \ndescended from Alessia, although there are many legends that would make it \nso, most of them dating from the time of Reman and likely attempts to \nlegitimize his rule",

Aka is on the same sub-gradient level as Lorkhan, and \nhas a similar shattering of being (but didn't die). He is the physical \nmanifestation of Anu within the Aurbis, While Anui-El is the Aurbical \nmanifestation of Anu within the Dream. Auri-El was the first of the shards, \nrepresenting the beginning of time. Alduin was the next, representing the \nend of time. Some think that Alkosh represents the continuity of time and \nis responsible to repairing it when it goes to pot, with the assistance of \nthe Jill. Tosh-Raka is the future. Akatosh is the aspect of time that \nrepresents the present.So remember how I I said Auri-El was the first? \nWell.... Akatosh was also the first because the Marukhati Selectives dances \nof a Tower and jacked up the Time gods. Akatosh is a mix of Lorkhan (or \nShor) and Auri-El. The Selectives attempted to remove Auri-El from him. \nThis may or may not have been successful and likely make Akatosh as he is \ntoday, very Padomaic time god. The Selectives sort of retconned the gods \n(because Dawn magic) and poof, we're where we're at today. Dragons are \nlesser time spirits. Smaller pieces of the Aka oversoul. \n\nIf Aka is a bucket of water, it spilled and the time gods are like large \npuddles where most of the water came puddled together. Small drops of water \nscattered around are like the dovah and jill. \n\nIn short, Alduin, Akatosh, Auri-El, Alkosh, and Tosh-Raka (I'm probably \nforgetting one) are all on the \"same level\" as they are of the same \nsub-gradient within the dream. Akatosh was retconned into first, thus \nAlduin is the first of Akatosh. He explains it this way because mortals are \nstupid and probably couldn't truly comprehend exactly how he fits into the \nwhole thing. \n\nAlduin's a pretty special and unique being in the Aurbis.",

Frankly, I'm surprised more villains don't try to just steal all \nthe scrolls and somehow attain ultimate knowledge. If dragons are coming \nback now, surely a person or daedra who can survive seeing the scrolls and \nharness their power is possible. They should work on an antagonist who has \nthe ability to absorb the wisdom contained within each scroll upon reading \nit (similar to dragonborn, I know), which would eventually make him smart \nand powerful enough that no one could win by fighting head on. He/she/it \ncould then raise an empire controlled through the combined accumulated \nwisdom of the scrolls, creating a nearly perfect strategic defense, \nmilitary, manipulation of other provinces' leaders, pretty much total \npolitical rear ending. It would then be up to the hero, born a few decades \nlater, to defeat this empire not by simply attacking it but by finding \nancient magic to take away the power of each scroll the villain has read \nand return it to the scrolls where they are hidden. This would have to be \ndone before the villain finds the final scrolls that his/her/its army is \nseeking across Tamriel, gaining enough power to become a god. Once the \nvillain's mind and power have been weakened to where a direct attack is \neffective, you can have an all out battle of scroll vs scroll mayhem. After \nthat, use your remaining power to just walk through the spaces between \nreality and travel back to before the scrolls were scattered across \nTamriel, sending them all to a new land beyond where mortals will never \nfind them... until the next game. \ufeff",
