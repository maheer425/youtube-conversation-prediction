But the point of the \nvideo is that when you move around the earth you necessarily are moving \naround on a spheroid, not a plane, so as you move, the direction of the \ncenter of the earth changes relative to your first position.

Something that \nintrigued me was the various patterns you could create in one single array \nof points, and how much variation there could be. One thing that confused \nme was how circles are connected to parabolas. I would have never thought \nabout that if it weren't for watching this video. All around now I have \nsomething to think about when it comes to a connection between art and \nmath. Also the systematic creation of these designs and why some patterns \nlook good and some do not, and finally how do we define good vs. bad. I \ndon't know why but this video has sparked a lot of questions.  \ufeff",
