Iv tried spraying him with a squirt bottle which now \nI know not to do, using repellent sprays, playing with him hours straight, \nbut he still messes with things. Iv even tried just ignoring him because he \nlikes the negative attention. He has plenty of toys to play with and a huge \ncat tree and scratching posts. Iv tried putting cat nip on all of it but he \nstill scratches the furniture, climbs the curtains, and attacks my hands \nand feet until they bleed. He won't let me pet him. He just attacks. It \ndoesn't seem like he is angry. He is playing but it's like he never rests \nno matter how tired he is. If anyone has any suggestions I would really \ngreatly appreciate it. At this point I am really desperate. I'm also mad \nbecause my mom won't try and help me. I make suggestions on ways we can try \nto fix things and she won't. She just moved into this new house we are in \nand there are objects all over the counters and tables he is interested in. \nShe doesn't have time or even the space to put these things away, so \nputting double sided tape down probably won't happen because she isn't \nwilling to try. I wanted to try and trim his nails but she ignores that. \nShe wants to get him declawed but I dont. It's wrong and wouldn't help \nanyways. At this point I'm lost on what to do. I have to keep my eye on him \n24/7. If we leave the house he has to stay in my bedroom and I'm worried \nhow that is affecting him.

My \ntortoise back is quite bitchy & standoffish most of the time except those \nbrief moments when she wants me to scratch her face & sit on my paper while \nI'm working. Hehe. I have a theory it has to do with being a tree climber \nvs bush dweller, alley cat or lap cat & how they'd act in the wild. For \nexample, our tortoise back is all different colors of brown and black and \nis a tree climber, so I associate her with being an alley cat, always on \nthe hunt, so she'd rather be out on her own, not being bothered, stand \noffish like a tiger, whereas our white cat would stand out more in the \nwild, be very vulnerable to predators, scared into the bushes, & so she's \nmore of a lap cat who needs love & assurance & to cuddle all the time. I \nwould assess your cats personality to see what type of cat she is & how \nshe'd act in the wild.\nYour cat could be responding to other people differently if she likes their \nsmell, if they've ever given her treats she could be remembering that. She \ncould be associating the sounds they make or the tone in their voice. Do \nyou just start petting or do you let her smell your hand first asking in \ncat language \"are you in the mood for me to touch you?\" You will see her \nmove her head away from you if no or she'll nudge your hand yes if so. You \ngotta ask for permission essentially first! If she's still standoffish you \ncould always win her over with treats or real chicken. Haha!

Now, for your \ncleaning process, just don't let her in while you're washing the bathroom, \nbecause all the chemicals should have gone away after you wash, scrub and \nthen rinse them with water.\n\nAbout your fountain: you must check if the part that she drinks the water \nfrom is wide enough. Cats are more likely to drink out of a \"wide puddle\" \nthan from a \"narrow pool\", got it? That's why she goes to the sink and the \ntub: water puddles!\n-\nAlso, is the fountain made of plastic? If yes, then you should just buy a \nwide and shallow water pot made of stainless steel. Plastic holds dirt and \nbacteria very easily.... And every cat hates to use nasty dirty things \n(dirty litterbox, dirty pots - or dishes, whatever they use to eat or drink \nfrom).\n-\nNote that the plastic pots must be cleaned with sponge, soap and water \nEVERY DAY. And the stainless steel pots must be washed once a week with \nsoap, and everyday only with water, when you change it. Water must be \nchanged daily on both kinds of pots, by the way.\n\nGood luck.",

Such as the fridge. Or the \noven. Or the bathroom, just before you close the door and leave for 8 hours \n(it can happen. You can't be focused on them 100% of the time).\n\nWhat you want to do in the case of truly bad behavior, is have them know \nthat there are bad consequences, in *controlled* circumstances, when you \n*know* they are there, and you're controlling the consequences. You want \nthem to understand that they absolutely *never* want to go in there, for \nany reason. In the case of the (cold) oven or the bathroom, wait for them \nto go in, then close them in and make a huge racket. In the case of the \nfridge, close them in, and wait for them to get truly scared before opening \nthe fridge door again (again, controlled circumstances. This is far better \nthan accidentally closing them in when you don't realize they've darted \nin). Then they will *never* go in there again. Cruel to be kind - if your \ncat is prone to going into dangerous areas, this is far safer than just \n*hoping* that you will always catch them darting or sneaking in, in time to \nsave them.\n\nI do think there's one exception to the squirt-gun/hissing rule. If they \nare coming at your face with their claws out, they need to know, \nabsolutely, that this is not acceptable behavior. It works, too. Hissing at \nthem, I mean. But only if they're attacking you (or a baby or a guest). \nIt's bad if you use it for really minor things, like counter surfing.\ufeff",

If i \nseek a desired result, such as stopping them from entering a room such as \nas the bathroom, I rather just create a deterrent where they see the place \nas uncomfortable or dangerous as they should and give them something else \nthat is healthy and positive such as a well placed cat furniture near the \narea to overlook it. I often use a home made lemon juice mix of spray to \nindicate to my cat where it is not safe to be.\n\nOn another note, i do agree that scratching posts need to be a certain \nwidth, height, and weight for the cat to even bother with it. Otherwise \nyour better off getting one of those horizontally inclined ones cheaply \nthen getting a post that's barely the cats height.

            "text": "+Joana Ferro In addition to what Nienna just said... I noticed that you \nsaid, 'scratching pole.\" Those words call this to mind (picture from google \nimages):\n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJV6aO9NlUbULNM9haTSTTZLwNArrE559pw75jG3gaFJrNRV_z\n\nIf this is what you got... no offense, but no cat is going to actually \nscratch this, unless they (the cats, that is) are really tiny. Perhaps I'm \na little biased against them due to only ever having had male tabbies \n(which grow to be roughly 20 pounds of muscle and, if they so choose, can \nknock over a small child if they butt up against them), but... yeah. My cat \nwould look at something like that and think it's an odd item that's of no \nuse to him whatsoever.\n\nCats basically have three requirements of their scratching posts. They need \ntheir claws to catch against the material in just the right way, that it \nsharpens them. They need to be able to stretch their muscles (one of the \nmain functions of scratching - it's a bit of a workout for them). And, \nperhaps most importantly, they need the post to *not move at all*, no \nmatter *how* hard they pull at it. All it takes is one wobble, and it's \nforever written off as being completely useless, and something to avoid.\n\nThere are two ways to get around this. You can buy them a really good \nscratching post, that has a wide base that they can stand on with their \nback legs and stretch, both vertically and horizontally, and is extremely \nstable, and is tall enough that they can scratch while reaching way up... \nor, if you can't afford that (since the good ones tend to be at least $90), \nthere are the cheap, disposable ones that lay flat on the floor, that they \nstand on with all four legs while scratching with their front legs.\n\nThe material is important too. Clearly, your cat likes the material of the \ncouch. :) You may want to try for something with a similar \"catchiness\" \nquality (the way it catches on their claws). If the material of the couch \nis like that of cheap business carpeting, for example, you may actually get \naway with buying some spare carpeting that's of a similar feel, and nailing \nit to a stabilized board.\n\nWhat Nienna said about not forcing the cat to use the scratching post is \ncorrect. The right word you're looking for is, \"entice,\" not \"force.\" :) \nBuy a little packet of dried catnip and rub it against the scratching \nmaterial. Or take a \"stringy\" toy and play with them for a while, then when \nthey get really excited, draw the string up the post. If she likes the post \nafter touching it, you'll know immediately, and your problems will be \nsolved. Your cat *will* use a scratching post that she *likes*. She will \nnot use a scratching post that she does not like. It's really that simple. \n:)\n\nAnother option: assuming your couch is a futon, try buying a cover that \n*loosely* fits around the mattress, that's a similar material to bedding \nsheets. I've never heard of a cat that scratches bedding sheets. :)",

My house smelled like eucalyptus and lemon (I think is a \nfantastic clean smell) but my cats would avoid the areas that smelled like \nit. \nIt doesnt have to be eucalyptus. Just find some oils or a perfume or \nsomething that your cats will hate, (you can tell when you open the bottle \nin their general area, they will sniff it, and get all squinty eye'd, and \nthen run away) And spray everything you don't want them on, and just \nrespray occasionally.

I couldn't say, sorry. :) I don't do \nChristmas trees, for precisely this reason!\n\nRegarding the couch - she's scratching it because it's her favorite \nmaterial in the house. It's (presumably) sturdy, and she likes the \nmaterial. Scratching comes naturally to cats - they *need* to do it. So if \nyour cat is scratching someplace you don't want, the only real solution is \nto give them better options. Invest in a really good scratching post (a \nsissal one that doesn't wobble and can take their weight), or, if you can't \nafford that, the cheap ones that lie flat on the floor, that they can stand \non and stabilize with their back legs while they scratch with the front \nworks as well.
