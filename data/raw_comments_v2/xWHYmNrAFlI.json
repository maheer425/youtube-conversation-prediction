            "text": "It goes without saying that Psycho is a classic, a ground breaker, and \nsupremely unforgettable and creepy. If a film can impact viewers so deeply \nthat every single time they take a shower they have a brief moment where \nthis film crosses their mind, then that is one masterful film indeed. It's \na classic in every sense of the word, and yes, definitely a masterpiece \n(even if I prefer the first half over the second, I just love Janet Leigh's \nperformance.) With that said, I think that Gus Van Sant's Psycho is overly \nshat upon. Just because a film is a classic, doesn't mean another artist \nisn't allowed to experiment with it. And while yes, it is nearly shot for \nshot, Sant still adds his own personal and unique touches to it, like \nsubliminal imagery, equally beautiful cinematography, and ever so small \ntweaks to key scenes and moments. Especially in this scene, in the 98 \nversion a birdcage is added, and the sounds of flapping birds and squawks \ncan be heard, and the lighting is also a tad different casting disorienting \nheavy shadows. I also like how Sant didn't up the gore or add any cheap \nscares for a modern audience, he simply reworked the material with his \nindividual style and presented it to a modern audience (which he has stated \nwas the main reason he did the film in the first place, to bring the film \nto a younger, modern, audience who wouldn't seek out the original.) I think \nit's highly underrated. But I know I'm in the minority.\ufeff",

Especially \"Mother\" was I think somewhat easily defeated by Caleb \nwho was unarmed while Norman in his \"Mother\" trace had a knife.\n\nI know and that is why I excuse the fake looking fall when Norman slays the \ndetective and the fake looking cuts the victims receive from knife slashes. \nThe final scene could have been done better though. Even Bates Motel Norman \nwho like I said in my last paragraph was to an extent easily defeated by \nCaleb at least attempted to attack/kill him. Norman in this scene didn't \nput up any fight at all and I personally find it disappointing. I like for \nhorror (& action) films to end with a great final fight and/or chase \nsequence.",
