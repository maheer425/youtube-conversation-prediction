My strategy would be have 50 people \nagree to open the \"top\" 50 boxes only and the other 50 open the \"bottom\" 50 \nboxes. Each person has a 50/50 shot of finding their bill since they check \nhalf the boxes. and half of the 100 people's bills are in the \"top\" 50 \nboxes. So if you correctly assign 50 people to the \"top\" boxes where there \nbills lie you win. The chance is low but still there. And if you have 49 or \nless people check the \"top\" or \"bottom\" you automatically lose since 1 or \nmore bills is certain to not be found.

To find out the probability of two people finding their bills, you \nmultiply (1/2)(1/2), which equals 1/4.  To add the probability of a third \nperson finding their bill to those two, you multiply the result from the \nlast equation by 1/2; (1/4)(1/2)=1/8.  That's the same as (1/2)^3.  From \nthere, we can figure out that (1/2)^4=1/16, (1/2)^5=1/32, ect.  So the odds \nof everybody finding their bill is (1/2)^100, which is one in 7.89 times \n10^-31.  So for every 7.89 times 10^31 times that you do this bet, the \npeople hiding the bills will win.  Don't take it.\ufeff",

            "text": "I suppose I had an idea around the same time as Hassan(this is a repost), \nwith a similar logic(we both assume that those outside have a watch. \nFeedback?\n\n If no communication simply means no visual or audible interaction, and the \nnext person is called immediately after the successful person leaves the \nroom(big assumption), then there is an alternate solution, with a 50% \nchance of winning.\nThe 100 people line up to go into the room in order. The 1st person(call \nhim \u201cA\u201d) goes in the room, and checks the bottom 50 boxes(the 1st half), in \na snaking order(let\u2019s assume the boxes are in a 10x10 grid). If he finds \nhis bill(50% chance), then he leaves at an hour mark representing which box \nhe found bill #1, and the minute mark where he found #2, if he found bill \n#2. Ex: Bill #1 found at the 14th box, and bill #2 found at the 45th box, \nso he leaves after 14 hours and 45 minutes. If bill #2 was not found, he \nleaves at 14 hours and 0 minutes. Note: I think he is able to check 50 \nboxes even after his own bill is found because in the video it said that he \nleft the room when he \u201c[showed him that he had succeeded]\u201d.\n\nAssuming that \u201cA\u201d found the bill, the 2nd person(call him \u201cB\u201d) has a 100% \nchance of finding bill #2.\n\n Case 1: Say \u201cB\u201d was called into the room at 14:45, then \u201cB\u201d would check \nall of the 1st half for where bill #3 was, and for continuity\u2019s sake, leave \nat hour 45, and the minute marking where he found bill #3. If bill #3 was \nnot found, then he would leave at 45:00.\n\nCase 2: Say \u201cB\u201d was called into the room at 14:00, then \u201cB\u201d would check the \n2nd half(top 50, starting from box #51) for where bill #2 was, and leave at \nthe corresponding hour marker for that location(let\u2019s say the 13th hour, as \nin the 13th box of the 2nd half), and the corresponding minute marker for \nwhere bill #3 was found. For example, if bill #3 was found at the 29th \nblock, \u201cB\u201d would leave at 13:29 If bill #3 was not found, then \u201cB\u201d would \nleave at 13:00.\n\n\u201cC\u201d, repeats the pattern, and so forth. After each turn, the people in line \nare basically building a coordinate system telling them which bills have \nbeen claimed (the boxes do not move). After 50 people have repeated these \nsteps, people 51-100 can open the remaining 50 unknown boxes to find their \nown bill. \n\nYes, you could claim that they couldn't accurately measure the time, but \nit\u2019d be strange for 100 people not to have a watch/phone. Alternatively, we \ncould switch hours to days and minutes to half hours, if that would make \ncounting easier. \ufeff",
