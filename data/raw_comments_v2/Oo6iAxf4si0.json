I'm not sure if I came to San Fran on the wrong day or \nwhatever it was but I was uneasy about it. Just getting into the city was a \nproblem. Traffic everywhere :( not a lot of parking. But I did find one :) \nI'm use to using a car for everything. LA was spaced out and easy to \nmaneuver around. I felt packed and very congested like a sardine in San \nFran. Just being honest. I'm not knocking San Fran at all, everything isn't \nfor everyone. For those who want to venture and see it I encourage you. \nThen head to LA and have fun :) \ufeff",
