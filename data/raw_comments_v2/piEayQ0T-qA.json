We don't like the Chinese government, because we find it a \nvery different system from what we are used to. We want freedom and our own \nway of living. We dislike the idea of communism and the law systems and the \nban of almost all social platform used worldwide but China. However, we see \nmainland China improving, and we know China is a strong country with great \nstatus and finance and technology and education. BUT SO WHAT? Most Hong \nKong people still has the misconception of how all mainland people are \nstill those idiots without culture after the cultural revolution. *I mean, \nyou can't blame us, when we see many mainland tourists peeing on the \nstreets or in toilet sinks, we cringe when we see mainland tourists forcing \ntheir way into a line.* Maybe it's just a generation problem, but these \ngaps won't exist between different states(?) in China. This make us Hong \nKong people feel like a shame to be called Chinese. As most mainlanders \nwould agree, China doesn't need Hong Kong, so why bother making every part \nof Hong Kong all 'Chinese' (not ethnically if you get what I mean)? Hong \nKong ain't that important and we know that. We are happy if China promise \nto stay with the 'one country two systems'...\ufeff",
