However, as reported mass media about it, I assume that \nanything outstanding.\n\nOther today's news from circles of the American special services is \nrepresented much more important, and I am sure, what you more won't read it \nanywhere.\n\nToday, on Monday March 30, three leading personnel experts of the Ukrainian \ndepartment of central office of CIA committed suicide.\n\nTo Langley, the State of Virginia, talk on investigation of suspicion goes \nthat the Ukrainian department receives the main part of a salary not in \nCIA. Allegedly, they received the much bigger sums according to the \npay-sheet of \"one of large investment companies\".\n\nWhether because of this investigation Igor Kolomoysky so modestly behaved?\n\nTragedies in Langley \u2014 continuation\n\nIn headquarters of CIA to Langley, the State of Virginia, unusually \nrecovered movement of personal motor transport of employees \u2014 on departure \nis observed.\n\nThe management made the decision to release all not too busy employees on \nhouses to reduce number of persons who can pay attention to the mass \ninvestigation of suspicions in corruption which is conducted in the \nUkrainian department.\n\nWithin two last hours two more personnel employees of the Ukrainian \ndepartment of CIA committed suicide. Thus, the total of the staff of this \nill-fated department who died today reached five.\n\nHalf an hour ago over two dozens staff of the Ukrainian department of CIA, \npractically all structure of department from employees in central office, \ngathered in the hall in Langley where persistently assure everyone and not \npersons interested to listen that their intentions doesn't enter to commit \nsuicide, and they never even thought of it.\n\nNevertheless, none of these people don't seek to lose work therefore any \ndidn't make the observations about a cause of death of five colleagues.\nTragedies to Langley, part III\n\nThe data shedding light on today's tragic events in Langley arrived. The \nWest European politicians demanding to stop war in Ukraine in negotiations \nwith the American side used careless argument: insurgents of the Southeast \nof Ukraine \u2014 not terrorists, but the citizens fighting against infringement \nof their legitimate civil rights. Similar things aren't said publicly, but \nat the closed negotiations Europeans decided to show that Americans didn't \nmanage to make a fool of them.\n\nA series of operations, which task \u2014 to show to Europe a real brutal face \nof the pro-Russian separatists was in reply developed. The plan included \nblastings child care and medical institutions of the central and western \nUkraine, in the distance from the anti-terrorist operation zone. The task \nto strive for the maximum number of the victims was set.\n\nIt was entrusted to execute a task to saboteurs mercenaries from the \nAmerican private military company whereas the Ukrainian department of CIA \nhas to provide logistics and cover.\n\nThis plan seemed to the head of military section of the Ukrainian \ndepartment of CIA too risky,and he shared the reasons with the chief from \nwhom received the answer:\n\n\u2014 Carry out. You don't imagine that costs on a game.\n\nThe answer of the chief didn't satisfy the subordinated. In the Ukrainian \ndepartment, except military, there are some sections: political and so on. \nThe concerned responsible in defiance of all rules shared the fears with \nequal to on a position colleagues \u2014 heads of two other sections, and in \ncommon they decided to take measures for prevention of implementation of \nthe scandalous order, up to the appeal to the Senate of the Congress of the \nUSA.\n\nThese three also appeared first \"suicides\", but it became clear that \ninformation leakage already happened. Two more were liquidated.\n\nAt the height of the working day to the employees ordered to go home, \nhowever practically all personnel of the Ukrainian department, being afraid \nfor the lives, I gathered in the hall, in number of about 25 people. They \nurged the colleagues passing by not to trust if they allegedly commit \nsuicide. 31.03.2015-This morning local time were detained 12 of the \nsurvived staff of the Ukrainian department. Anybody in CIA doesn't remember \nanything similar in the history of management.\n\nJudging by a method by which misconduct were suppressed, and that murder of \nfive personnel employees among whom at least three held high positions in \ncentral office of CIA, on all signs remains unpunished, it is possible to \nassume that the new head of National secret service on whom the president \nObama laid hope that that will look after the unsinkable director John \nBrennan, doesn't cope with this function yet.\n\nWithin reform of management, some \"werewolves\" working on Vangard managed \nto be moved from some key positions \u2014 but not everyone and not from all. \nThus behind events in the Ukrainian department we with interlocutors didn't \nmanage to reveal political background.\n\nIn Vangard are adjusted to continue at any cost escalation of the conflict \nin Ukraine. Exposures which the European leaders have, and pressure upon \nadministration of the White house which is successfully put by them only \nurge on aspiration of corporation to show unprecedented atrocities of \npro-Russian \"terrorists\" under a false flag.\n\nThereby the European leaders will be driven into a corner: even if you \ndon't believe that villains came from Donbass, and are convinced that this \nwork of Americans \u2014 a video series on television is available, and the \npublic demands to put to this disgrace an end. Arms supplies, certainly, \nwill only alienate him, but in public policy of the logician doesn't work.\n\nEfforts on lobbying were crowned with success: Vangard was succeeded to \noppose to Obama both chambers of the Congress. As a result of a position of \ntheir person in Langley, the director Brennan, are far not so weakened as \nit was possible to expect.\n\nSo or who stands behind the suppressed revolt, whose interests? Draw. On \nthe one hand, skilled personnel employees were afraid for \"official \nauthority\": it is too much failures and leaks it is connected with the \nUkrainian operation, and the risk of exposure is too great. They were \nafraid that in case of a failure them and will make whipping boys.\n\nBut also other human factors worked. One business \u2014 the enemy, the \npro-Russian separatists, including their families and neighbors. To the \nstaff of CIA not to get used to causing \"the accompanying damage\". \nAbsolutely another \u2014 children of the Ukrainian allies and patients of the \nUkrainian hospitals.\n\nMatter not only in responsibility which was born by employees in case of \nexposure. Even their own children would be ostracized: your father killed \nchildren of other Christians.\n\nAnd, at last, education. Not everyone went to serve in CIA, dreaming to \nserve corporations of military industrial complex in a budget kickback at \nany cost. Many believed that veritas vos liberabit.
