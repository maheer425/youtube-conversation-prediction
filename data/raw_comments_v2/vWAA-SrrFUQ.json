If whales have never been regarded as the owners \nof the title of  \"the biggest living thing\". \u00bfWhy do you try to clarify \nabout the real owner of that \"title\" if this ever has been given to blue \nwhales?. \u00bfWhich is the point of mentioning the title that possess the blue \nwhales of being the biggest ANIMALS on earth in a vindicative video about \nthe real winner of the title of the biggest organism on Earth?.\nPlease remember that when we talk about \"ANIMAL\", we refer to organisms \nbelonging to the animal kingdom (Animalia). Trees (Plantae) and mushrooms \n(Fungi) are not animals!.\n\nVery interesting all of that about honey mushrooms and pando trees, but all \nthis information does not change or clarify anything because, first of all, \nnever has been said that the blue whale is the \"biggest organism\" or \n\"biggest living thing\" on Earth. It has always been said that the blue \nwhale is the biggest ANIMAAAL, no organism, no living thing... ANIMAAAL!. \n\"Organism\" and \"living thing\" are not synonyms of animal.\nSo, blue whales have not lost any title because they never have been \nclassified or crowned as the biggest organism or living thing on Earth.\n\nThis video first takes a known fact about an animal, then twist and play \nwith certain words, shifting the central topic into one of \"living \nthings/organism\" and finally develop an explanation pretending to have \ncleared up a inexistent misunderstanding about blue whales.\nIn this video I see a serious lack in understanding of basic taxonomic \nconcepts. I reiterate: \"Organism\" and \"living thing\" are not synonyms of \n\"animal\".\ufeff",
