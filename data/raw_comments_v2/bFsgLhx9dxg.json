Not every man can be a rich \nlord of the manner, ladies.\n\nIf you put your value in kindness and sincerity - you will be rewarded.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to have a fiance whose relationship was fostered from \na friendship and compassion. Neither of us was really looking, but he \nrealized one day that I was the one he couldn't live without and after \nbeing friends in high-school, time apart, and 2 years after reconnecting( \nwhere I was terrified to let him in close because he wasn't what I thought \nI needed) I finally agreed to go on a date. That was the best risk I ever \ntook, as he has been my most valuable asset. But it was my witt, honesty, \nand sharp mind that won him - not beauty.\n\nSo stop friendzoning men because they're \"boring\" or too nice.

These are \njust examples to sustain my point of views.\n\nAs you can see social power and safety are poor values, but are really \npowerful in our society context, until they last. One day they wake up and \nthey say \"I thought was a different person...\". If these seem too much \ngeneric because some people don't follow these bad values, the last one is \nthe most important.\n\nA lot of women, and also men, have problem to communicate, they are really \nclose when they should embrace the new (unfortunately here if women are \nstrange, the problem are also men). Often people prefer to complete their \nlacks with another person rather than working hard on themselves.\n\nI'm not a misogynistic and pompous individual because I've left women do \nwhat they want. I was really shy and weak until I realized that they asked \nfor either a strong and emphatic presence. Then I started to build the \nstronger version of myself, several results and satisfactions. I'm ready to \nembrace the new and the best...but if you look at previous paragraphs \nsomething is not working \"outside\". Then my remark ;) ...\n\nSo, you undestand that in some way I was shy (...wouldn't be openly \nspeaking about himself with such bravado...), in some way I don't \nparticularly like society (sociophobic?), in some way I built up a \n\"stronghold\" around me (sheltered?), and at the really beginning I pointed \nthe finger only towards outside or following wrong attitude/sacrifice \n(martyr?).\n\nBoth Darcy and Elisabeth are strong people that are different from the \nmass. In fact Elisabeth isn't sure about wedding and men stuff as are \nusually considered.

What about you is attracted / attracting those type of women?

Their dating partners are generally \nnot a result of them finding someone who shares a common interest with whom \nthey've first fostered a friendship with depth. They rely on the internet, \nfriends setting them up, clubs, and hook up apps. The other extreme is that \nthey are always \"attracted\" to the wrong type of person. I.E. The guy who \nis so overly invested in appearance that he doesn't pay attention to \npersonality - hence the \"pretty, crazy bitch\" trope. Women can do the same \nthing. It takes time to cultivate a relationship with more depth, and let's \nbe honest - people are impatient.\n\nAlso not all women act differently than what they say. If you're running \ninto this a lot, it might because they're just not that into you or they're \nrealizing you're not a good fit with them and thus thinking about keeping \ntheir options open for something better. Guys do this too.\n\nYou'd think I was some simpering little 18 year old by the way you reply to \nme, not a full grown woman with a few years of psychology, anthropology, \nand life experience under my belt.\n\nI state you're not a Mr. Darcy because Mr. Darcy wouldn't be openly \nspeaking about himself with such bravado. He seemed more the \"my acts\" \nspeak for me type. Considering that the books are set in the late Regency \nEra, it was considered tremendously rude for a man to speak of himself at \nlength, which is why Elizabeth likely relied upon gossip to learn as much \nabout him.

It's human nature to always want \n\"better\", especially if you're trust has been betrayed in the past.\n\nGranted the whole point of the book was that Elizabeth was too busy paying \nattention to gossip and Darcy was too stuck up his own ass.",

RA plays a darkly handsome, reserved hero who melts his own heart, \nhis lady love's and all his viewers' at the end.  If you love P&P, you'll \nlove this movie too.
