On top of that \nDodos are big and meaty chickens, so there is a possibility of \ncommercializing them - given the fact that we could make it so they lay \nmore than one egg a year.\n\nBut the questions of all questions is: do we really need to clone a Mammoth \nor for that matter anything? Or bring extinct animals back? Because some \nwent extinct for a reason (mammoth), some were just driven to extinction \nbecause of Man (Dodo, Moa, etc...)
