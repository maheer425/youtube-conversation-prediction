Landis observes, \"All \nover the world there are similar findings of world travel, advanced \nastronomy\u2026 ancient man had the advanced knowledge of astronomical \nmovements, including the process of precession \u2026found everywhere,\" Landis \nwrites. For example, Roman sailors used an Antikythera mechanism with \ndozens of gears to track the Sun, Moon and planets.\" The evolutionary \nparadigm of grunting cavemen conflicts with the actual widespread \nhistorical, anthropological, and archaeological evidence of a brilliant and \nsophisticated ancient human civilization. Likewise in Plunket wrote: \"We \nshould also be led to think of the common ancestors of the civilized races \nnot as ignorant barbarians, but rather as men graced with high intellectual \ngifts\u2014men whose teachings have been handed down through all the ages to \nthis present day, and of whose imaginings the Zodiac remains as the most \nancient monument of the work of intelligent man.\" Finally realize that \nhuman IQ has not been increasing but decreasing. A journal paper in Trends \nin Genetics by a Stanford professor of pathology and developmental biology \nDr. Gerald Crabtree titled Our Fragile Intellect, concludes from, \"new \ndevelopments in genetics, anthropology, and neurobiology\" that, \"if an \naverage citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he \nor she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our \ncolleagues and companions...\"",
