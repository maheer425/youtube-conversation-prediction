Perfection cannot be a \nconcept of something without flaws AND it be a concept of something WITH \nflaws. If the concept of perfection could have flaws, then it is no longer \nperfection. For by the very nature of the concept of perfection, it can be \nno more broken down to be anything else BUT perfection. Descartes could \nimagine a concept of perfection, and it follows then at this concept could \nonly come from a Perfect Being. Even an imperfect being could not produce \nthe concept of perfection, without there being a Being of Perfection.\n\nIt has been argued that, one could imagine a strong man, even by being \nweak. The argument is, you can be imperfect but imagine something greater \nthan yourself, without there necessarily being the greater thing in \nexistence. I would disagree, because, in order for you to make a comparison \nlike that, there needs to be another substance (the greater thing) for you \nto call it \"greater\". The word \"greater\" implies that there is something \ngreater in and of itself. Now this principle may not apply in all external \nthings, but in the absolute sense of the word, it must. \n\n Therefore I believe the end part of this video (though i thought \neverything else was awesome) is misleading in my opinion. \ufeff",

Finally, we cannot always trust our senses, that's why we make \nmany, many observations, compile them together, then use statistics to rule \nout the possibility that our observed correlations/predicted outcomes (or \nlack thereof) are not the result of error or random chance.\n\nI've commented on several of these videos in a row now and should point out \nthat several of my friends are political theorists.  For those who don't \nknow, political theorists do normative research on questions of political \nphilosophy.  They largely ignore the behavioral wing of that branch of \nsocial science and ignore the scientific method.  So I've heard all this \nnonsense before.\n\nAlso, why all the focus on Western philosophers?  I haven't seen one video \nyet on Buddhist, Taoist, Confucianist, Hindu, &c. philosophy yet.\ufeff",
