The \nonly time that they didn't was when society was for the most part dependent \non religion, which if you didn't even go to church you could be hanged. \nHomosexuals could vote, get jobs, own land, and much of everything for the \npast years. The only right they don't have in most places is marriage. I \nwould say that rather than getting rights, homosexuals are getting \nunderstanding and tolerance in society.\n\nI know this is off topic of what I am saying, however I entirely hate that \neven our school systems use the terms gay, lesbian, queer, ect. I would \nmuch rather youth to learn the correct terms of which to apply to the \ndifferent types of people.\n\nAnother note, homophobes is not the correct term. Being \"Scared of the \nsame\" is not really descriptive enough, yes it is short and memorable, \nhowever the term homosexualaphobe or something to that effect would be more \nreasonable. However that is my term. Some would argue that \"phobe\" is not \nthe correct post-fix to the term, however we are naturally wired to be \nscared of the unknown and reject it. Homosexuals have different feelings \nand thinking patterns than we have, so we are naturally going to shove them \naway. Of course science and ideology has changed this, but it is just the \nway we work.",
