To my knowledge \npolice protocol (at least around here) is that if you are to use your gun, \nthen you don't fool around. Aim for the chest, and fire until the attacker \ngoes down. \n\nWhy it's so much worse in the US? My guess is that US officers are far more \nlikely to grab their gun in the first place. In Europe it's a last resort. \nIn the US, an officer knows his attacker may well be carrying a gun \nhimself... I'd think that changes your perspective. If your attacker makes \nany gesture that looks like he's grabbing for his waistband, you make \nradical conclusions (especially if you're already beaten up). LEOs in most \ncountries don't have to worry about that all the time. Indeed, it's my \nimpression that in most of the world, the cops get a whole lot more \nrespect, which allows them to do their job, most of the time, with minimal \nviolence.\n\nIf you want that to change, you'll have to change the 2nd amendment for \nstarters. That may also affect the other side I mentioned. In my country, \npeople may dislike cops, but we know we depend on them as well, which also \nbreeds some form of respect.\nBut I don't think that is likely to change.

I like to go for the truth rather than spouting my \nideological  opinions without knowing anything about the specific event.\n2. There is no mainstream \"liberal media\" in America, if you are referring \nonly to widespread public news organizations (possibly MSNBC). Nor is there \nconservative media. Fox \"News\" does not contain enough facts to count as \nnews, in my opinion, and in any case spouts opinions that are too far right \nto be considered mainstream conservative. CNN, ABC, etc. are not liberal. \nThey may seem liberal to America, which is more conservative than the rest \nof the world, but in the grand scheme of things their bias is very slight, \nand not far enough left to be considered a definite liberal bias (although \nMSNBC is trying to do that; we'll say they are a liberal bias for the sake \nof fairness).\n3. \"Obama is a phony... and Sharpton too...\" What does Obama have to do \nwith this shooting? Obama denounced the protesters and told them to take \nlegitimate action instead of rioting. He is, by chain of command, in charge \nof all police officers! (You'll get all states-rightsy but it's true) As \nfar as Sharpton goes, I don't think anyone argues that he is extreme and \nnot always helpful for race relations. True, he provides useful input for \nracial discussions and speaks for a large minority in the White House. But \npersonally I think that his position could be better filled. Either way, \nI'm not sure how either of them \"being phony\" has anything to do with this, \nor even what that means.\n4. Yes, there is a hood mentality. It is good to recognize that. We NEED to \nrecognize that and provide assistance to these people. Impoverished by \ncenturies of slavery and racial oppression, white people have created a \nculture for many, many black people that is uneducated, violent, and in \npoverty. If we do not try to help people, the violence will only continue. \nThey grow up in this culture and are taught this mentality that in many \ncases is a necessity just to survive. It is especially important in \nracially charged areas like Ferguson where black people are subjected to \nracism every day, from everyone - including the police.\n5. No, asshole-ness does not mean you can try to kill someone. But after \nyears of being treated like an inferior, and hearing some asshole be a \nracist maybe it's the last straw for some people to fight back (no, there \nis no conclusive evidence that in either case murder was attempted - except \nby the actual murderers). Some people who grew up in the hood mentality \nculture and have a built-up sense of anger and their own racism. Zimmerman \nis a different case than Wilson. Zimmerman was a citizen, a regular guy. In \nZimmerman's case we have little evidence that suggested Martin actually \nattacked him, and almost none that says he was doing anything with deadly \nforce/intent. Wilson was an officer of the law. He is a professional. He \nshould NOT lose his temper and NOT be an asshole. I wrote extensively on \nthis in a previous post, if you read it. Think objectively. I know it is \nhard working in that dangerous situation and area. But that does not excuse \na killing. There is very little evidence that says Brown was trying to kill \nhim! When he shot Brown, they were out of the car and Brown either had his \nhands up, or was running towards Wilson. Either way, his life was not in \ndanger to the point where he should not have fired to wound. Someone being \nan asshole is not an excuse to actually commit murder when you are the only \none armed and have the option to wound.\n6. Yes, it is dangerous to our judicial system, yes, it is dangerous in the \nghetto, and yes, I don't think Wilson woke up an wanted to be a murderer. \nBut our judicial system should be comprised of well-trained, \nmentally-healthy, not racist individuals. We don't want people to die when \nthey should live. The danger is stressful and I understand that. But it is \nnot enough of an excuse to kill and unarmed man. Wilson not wanting to \ncommit murder when he woke up is not an argument and says nothing other \nthan it was not planned, which nobody things.\n7. If Wilson was being an asshole he was provoking Brown. That's not how a \npolice officer, a professional defender of the law, should behave. He made \na situation worse than it was and created something that escalated to the \npoint where he killed an unarmed man.\n8. \"Brown was an n- word...\" What?? That's just a derogatory term derived \nfrom Spanish for black. It has no definition. One cannot be a nigger or not \na nigger. That's like saying someone is or is not a cunt. Or someone, by a \ntechnical definition, is or is not a bitch. That's not how insults and \nderogatory language works. I suppose if you want to be technical he \nqualifies because he is black. But it's not something he can be just \nbecause he was a criminal. This statement is very racist in itself and with \nyour other comments, it seems that you yourself are fairly racist. That \nputs you at a bias in this argument, which shows why you accept slight \nevidence that goes in your favor, while dismissing almost anything that is \nnot indisputable if it goes against you. Try to look at things objectively \nhere.\n8. No, he did not have that right, even if he was provoked (although again, \nI'll remind you not to see them as equals - Wilson, as a professional, has \na responsibility to try to not be provoked and certainly never to provoke). \nBut the only evidence that says he tried to take his gun is Wilson's word. \nThat is anything but conclusive. Just because you doubt it is a lie does \nnot make it fact, nor does it make it likely. Brown only said that much \nlater.\n9. Again, your opinion of Brown has no meaning because you don't know him. \nYou will cite the robbery video. He was certainly not being terribly \nruthless and just because someone is a bad person does not mean he is a \n\"crazy nut.\"\n10. Stop citing \"forensics\" and provide a link for the blood smear thing. \nThere is nothing that says he charged other than this, which as +Liza \nTanzawa said, might be explained by his body falling forward. If even such \nevidence exists. Freaked out by the gun going off in the car? He SHOT the \ngun in the car at Brown on purpose. Pointed the gun at Wilson? Again, \nWilson is the ONLY one saying this. If Brown had the gun, how did Wilson \nrecover his weapon? Forensics support that theory? Forensics couldn't \nsupport that theory. If you disagree, please provide your sources.\n11. Black racism towards white? Whites created this racism! It's our own \nfault! And it doesn't help when ignorant conservative perpetuate it. Blacks \nalso perpetuate it, but as I said, we need to address it and help them. \nOnly when we lift people out of ghettos and help them become productive \nmembers of a safe society will we bad able to combat racism from both ends.\n\nNow, if you disagree with what I say, please respond to my points directly \nwith facts supported by evidence. I am happy to respond in turn and provide \nmy own evidence for anything you disagree with. But please refrain from \nsimply giving a single paragraph giving the same overview and citing \nevidence you don't provide. Don't just give your opinionated view without \nsupporting facts. Lay out the facts, deal with them objectively, and \nsupport them. I can defend any of my points that you have a problem with.",

            "text": "+Liza Tanzawa +Martin Rodgers There was blood in the car, on his uniform, \nand on the gun. Yes. He also shot him in the car, hitting his arm. Brown \nran away, and put up his hands. The officer then shot him. There are \nseveral important things to consider:\n1. What was the instigation in the first place? Wilson was trying to get \nout of the car, and Brown shoved him back in. Why? What made Brown become \nso violent? Now, to be fair, Wilson has never been charged with anything \nbefore. His record is clean. But his life has been troubled and tragic, and \nhis two police assignments have been in racially charged areas. It would \nseem that a likely answer is that it was a racially-charged comment, or one \nthat could be interpreted as such, in a town that is so racially charged.\n2. You would grab at the gun too, if you were a minority used to racist \nofficers and in the situation. Sure, it was a stupid thing to do (run at \nthe officer getting out of the car), but it must be scary to know that \nthere are people in power and with guns and your experience has shown that \nthey will assault or provoke you for little to no reason.\n3. After being shot and grabbing at the gun, it seems that Brown realized \nhis awful mistakes and that the best option was to trust in the law. If he \nwas going to keep fighting, he wouldn't have ran away. He had \nalready been shot - I'm sure he was not eager to charge the cop who had \njust proven he would shoot. Wilson had just been attacked. In addition to \nhis upset personal life and possible racist views, this could have led him \nto shoot Brown. \n4. One more thing to consider: Brown charging again. If seems very unlikely \nthat he would attack again, but let's consider the possibility. You cite \nforensic evidence of blood saying that he was charging. I saw no evidence \nof that in my research. However, it is possible, and as I said above, if it \ndid happen it was probably provoked. It is very easy to imagine Wilson \nsaying something that would provoke another attack.\n5. Lastly: what if Brown instigated it? What if he said racially charged \ncomments or made a rude gesture towards the cop car? It is very possible, \nas we all know. In that case, Wilson should not have engaged. He is an \nofficer of the law. It is his job to be the bigger man and not react \nviolently. I know it is hard. I know he had his own stress and troubles. \nBut objectively, a police officer should not respond to comments or \ngestures.",
