I \nsang this song through my tears. I know the Savior knew what I was feeling \nand going through. He knows what you're going through too. In our darkest \nmoments, we can cry unto a Savior and He will surround us in His loving \narms and we are never alone. Never forget that you can pray. Prayer keeps \nme going. God hears and answers prayers. He knows you individually and \ncares about what you are going through. He never leaves, He is always \nthere.Seek Him as you search out your heart and as you see what He desires \nof you. He desires that you come unto Him and learn of Him. The Savior \nsaid, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will \ngive you rest.Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and \nlowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is \neasy, and my burden is light.\" He loves YOU! He wants you to be happy. He \ncan show you how. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches \nme of God and brings me closer to Christ. Check out this church, it is \nwonderful! :) I know it is true. I am so happy! I know the Savior lives. \nThis is my testimony, In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. \ufeff",
