I \nforget the BMW 69S...The 1971 the 750 Ducati achieved what wanted a twin \nlover and we know the descendants. Thanks ingeniere Taglioni!. Aside the \n250 et 350, there were the 450 DOHC Honda largely as fast as a 650 Bonnie \nbut with a erratic handling, the reliable T500 Suzuki, excellent base for a \nsport bike, but you're right the CB750 was the death of the British bikes, \nit was the dream of the 1967 500 Grand Prix put on road. The impression was \ncolossal. I had one of the first pre-serie (made for homologation in the \ndifferent countries) with the cranks casted in sand. At least 5 HP more \nthan the serial one with the smooth casts. Extremely reliable, for the \nfirst time I could travel without having 45 pounds of tools and spare \nparts. The rear tire Dunlop K81 didn't last long, and the poor chain was \nshort lived even with high maintenance but compared to the Bonnies and \nCommandos the CB750 was a total dream.",

By \ntricks, I mean, for my 850 Commando, pump the throttle three times, then \nbarely crack it open, push on the kicker until you feel resistance, and \nthen come down on the kicker in a slow, smooth, controlled motion using \nyour body weight, and it will fire right up. Stabbing at the kickstarter \nwill do nothing, nor will kicking with the throttle fully closed. Open the \nthrottle too much, and it will just fart... etc, etc. I own several bikes, \nboth new and old, and by far my favorite - hands down - is my fully \ncaffeinated '74 850 Commando. It's loud, it leaks, it smells, it vibrates, \nthe speedometer needle wags like a dog's tail, the front brake is as \neffective as pressing two pieces of plywood against a rotor, and frankly, \nthose are the reasons I love owning and riding it so much. Oh, and by \ncomparison, I can kick my '69 Tiger 650 through with just leg muscle; the \nCommando requires all 250 lbs of me to get it to turn over. The kicker gear \non the Triumph is much larger than that of the Norton, making starting the \nTriumph a breeze, relatively speaking. Great video; thanks guys -\ufeff",
