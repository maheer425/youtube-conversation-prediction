The reason why they \nare liquid is because they are unsaturated (they have fewer hydrogens) and \nbecause of that the molecules do not fit together that well, which lowers \nthe fat's melting point. Meanwhile animal fats are often solid because they \nare saturated. However, food manufacturers often want to make plant oils \nmore solid. So they need to add hydrogens to the carbons in the double \nbonds. (double bonds break and carbons form new bonds with hydrogens) Now \nthe fat molecule has been partially hydrogenated. Now to the important \npart. Normally all of the double bonds in natural fats are \ncis-configuration. However, during this partial hydrogenation of fats, some \nof the cis- bonds switch to the trans configuration which is unnatural and \ngenrally not that good for you.\n\nI think the reason they only partially hydrogenate the fats is because they \ndo not want to make the fat too solid.\n\nI am not saying everything I said is right. but that is what I have \ngathered from school.

In the USA we also \nget _many times_ the amount of fatty acids we need in our diet. Basically, \noil is never healthy for you \u2014 especially not when you cook with it \u2014 but \nthe amount that is converted into trans fats will be low if you stay far \naway from the smoke point of the oil, and don't cook with it for very long.\ufeff",

It's a very necessary \nnutrient.  You have weak knowledge about nutrition and biology, so you \nprobably should keep it to yourself, lest you reveal your ignorance to \nthose around you.  Here, let's take a look:\n\n\"Just because Inuits. . .\"  LMFAO!  What a completely unsubstantiated \nstatement!  You have, literally, zero evidence to support this except that \nyou'd like it to be the case.  If you don't understand how to think \nscientifically, shut up.\n\n\"Within this culture here in the USA, there is a direct correlation between \na person's cholesterol levels. . . cholesterol in the blood increases with \nfats in diet\"  This is grossly oversimplified.  Diet has a very small \neffect on cholesterol levels.  Of things you can control, exercise is far \nmore effective.  Of course, if you knew anything at all about human biology \n(you don't), you'd know that the biggest factor is genetics.  And you've \nalso failed to point out what kinds of fats.  When most people are \nconsuming mostly bad fats, just saying \"fats in diet (sic)\" is horribly \ninadequate, and if you understood nutrition, you'd know that.\n\nNo, cooking with monounsaturated fats does not create trans fats, at least \nnot when used properly.  You could, I suppose, reuse the fat over and over \nand over for a very long time, and after many, many hours of use, you'd \nhave a small amount of trans fat, but that'd be stupid, just from a \nculinary standpoint, because the oil was denatured and contaminated during \nthe first use and should not have been used again.  So yeah, I suppose if \nyou're a culinary dunce, then you might create some trans fats.  Pfft.\n\nHaha, and your 30x, 10x, \"no culture anywhere on earth where people eat \nonly a healthy amount of fat \u2014 everyone eats too much\" nonsense is total \nfucking crap!  Holy shit, do you get your jollies from making shit up? \n LMAO.  Many Americans don't get enough fat because of the residual from \nthe incredibly outdated \"fat free\" craze.  What's more, many people \nhonestly really need to up their saturated fat intake, because their skin \nand bones are crap.  Of course, since you're incredibly ignorant about \nnutrition, you're probably thinking \"What does saturated fat have to do \nwith skin and bones?\"  And that's just another example of why your thinking \nis incredibly outdated.\n\nAnyway, my point is, get with the new millennium.  Some of what you said \nmay have had support back in the 80s, maybe a bit in the 90s, but that sort \nof thinking has no place anymore in modern nutrition, as science (like, \nexperimentation) has overwhelmingly shown the intuition behind it to be \nhorribly flawed, like the sort of intuition you're using.",

Switching gears to cultural \ncomparisons, the cultures that live the longest all tend (comparatively) \ntowards vegetarianism and low fat diets. Just because Inuits can live well \ninto their 60s while eating seal blubber half the year doesn't mean that \nthey wouldnt live well into their 90s if they cut that shit out.",
