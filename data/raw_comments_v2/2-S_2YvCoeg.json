You are using a \nREFLUX still which is very effective in stripping away the volatiles so the \nspirit without double distilling will be about as good as it gets. We run \nthe SAME reflux head (also on a yacht!) to 98c then back blend 6lts from \n8kg sugar. The best you can get. There are no \"POISONS\" in your spirit \neither heads or tails unless YOU add them. Use of lead solder in making \nstills was another source of real poison but commercially made reflux heads \nproduce nothing but DRINKABLE hooch from start to finish.

            "text": "Hey Castaway- Valid thoughts but here's some other reasons we debated \nbefore gong this route....  In this part of the world (Australia in \nparticular) alcohol is SUPER EXPENSIVE!  1 liter of local Bundy rum was \nsetting us back about $65.00.  For the same amount we were going to \nprovision for 2 months of sailing up the coast we were able to buy the \nstill and enough supplies to last us for a year.  Then there's also the \naspect that it's just a whole lot of fun.  It's a great hobby and we really \nlove experimenting with different techniques, flavors.  We can carry yeast \nand sugar to last us a year, and make our own water with the desal so for \nus it just makes a lot of sense.  Thanks for watching!Cheers,Brian",

Even if your \nthermometer is 5 degrees out you're still fine (I've never seen this). Most \ndigital thermometers are within 0.5\u00b0C. If you're uncertain just boil some \nwater and see if it registered 100\u00b0C at roughly sea level, if not, \ncalibrate. In fact, on a boat is probably one of the best places to distil \nalcohol. The yeast mixture creates alcohol to a maximum of about 20%, then \nthe alcohol kills the yeast, then you distil, easy. If you heat to say 85\u00b0C \nit's not like you're evaporating anything else apart from alcohol in the \nstile. Very safe as long as you dilute it with water. Good work guys!
