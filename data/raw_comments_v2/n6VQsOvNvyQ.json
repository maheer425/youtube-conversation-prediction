I recently completed a two week trip to Thailand, and I mist say, \nit was one of the most culturally enjoyable vacations I've ever had.  I \nwatched your videos before I went on my trip, and they were extremely \nhelpful in planning to see the attractions that I wanted to visit.  I also \nspent three days in the old capital city of Ayutthaya,  While there, my \nfriend and I rented a motor scooter and toured the ruins of many ancient \nBuddhist temples.  As an amateur historian, I was in my glory.  In closing, \nI want to thank you for your helpful traveling tips and suggestions.  \nWithout them, my vacation to Thailand would not have been the resounding \nsuccess that it was.  I definitely plan to return in the near future.     \ufeff",
