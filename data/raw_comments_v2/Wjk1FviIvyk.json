I don't really see \nmyself as a bi before because I'm crushing on guys but every minute of the \nday, she's always on my mind and I get really jelous when she's around her \nguy friends. She's really sweet to me like she always hold my hand and \nkisses me on the cheeks but she's just addressing me as her bestfriend. She \ncalls me bae at text tho, so I can really relate to the bae thing on the \nvid. Haha. I'm really confused if I just misunderstood her sweetness to \naffection. I can't tell her how I feel because I'm afraid that this will \naffect our friendship.I'm really glad that I bumped into this video and I \ncan relate to this and the other commenters. Thanks for reading my long \ncomment, we're graduating college tomorrow and I don't know if I should \ntell her or not. Maybe It'd be better if we'd just stay friends, no? ;) \n(I'm not hating on bis, gays, and lesbians because my sister is a bi and \nI'm totally okay with it)\ufeff",
