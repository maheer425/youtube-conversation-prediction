If you \nare going for full speed on the track then paddles are the only way to go \nbut on the road I like manual more. I like rev-matching, using engine \nbraking to stop and not even touching the brakes, thinking ahead if I have \nto brake, if I have to go down a gear etc. With paddles changing gear \nbecomes easy, simple. It is no longer an occasion. You no longer feel the \njoy of a perfect rev-match or a perfect up shift (which with sporty grabby \nclutches is more difficult than in an ordinary car) because computers nail \nthem every single time after you touch a paddle.

Let's not let \nthe punks who buy the cars to compensate for any insecurities ruin the \ncars, because it's not the manufacturer's fault and not in their control \nwho buys the cars. I'm well travelled and have family in Germany and Italy, \nhaving spent considerable amounts of time in both countries. You don't see \nmany spoiled rich kids in either country driving these cars as commonly as \nit is seen in America. I've been in the US for many years now. To some, the \nones who are quick to judge and criticize, the young man or any many for \nthat matter with a Porsche, Ferrari, Lambo, and the like are seen as rich \nspoiled snobs who are just insecure. Yes there are owners like that but \nthat shouldn't ruin the reputation of the respective makers or the drivers \nwho legitimately drive the cars for the amazing experience they offer and \ncan appreciate them for what they are. As it's said, let's not let a few \nbad apples ruin the whole bunch. In this video Chris is enjoying the car \nthe way it should be. He has acknowledged on multiple occasions the car is \nnot practical for use in say London for example. But at the end of the day \nit's his money, his preference, and ultimately his choice. He and nobody \nelse who makes purchases is not the least bit hurting any one of us. I \nthink we have more important matters in society that are worthy of bitching \nabout.",
