When moist air goes up one side of the mountain, it rises with the \nmountain. This cools the moist air, because higher altitude have colder \nair. This cause the moist air to form clouds. As the air cools more the \ncloud drops its moisture through rain, or snow, as cold air can not hold as \nmuch moisture as warm air. By the the the air reaches the other side of the \nmountain, and begins to warm up, most of it's moisture is depleted, so it \nbecome dry air. This form arid conditions. ",
