Ecologically and energetically it's best to have \na primarily plant-based diet.  Nutritionally diversity is best--even though \nplants have a broader spectrum, herbivores have done the processing that we \ncan't and so many nutrients are more bioavailable in animal products. \n Societies have survived on both extremes (almost all plant or almost all \nanimal).  Ethically many people choose vegetarianism.  Realistically if you \nlive in a rough geography animal products would be local and not shipped in \nvia other natural resource wastage (oil).  In most of the developed world \nmost fruits and veggies are imported, and that economic/cultural niche is a \ndiscussion in itself.  You can be vegetarian and eat the worst junk food, \nso intrinsically vegetarianism does not equal healthy.  Animal hormones \n(depending on the concentration) can easily be bad for humans, but major \ncash crops like grains require MASSIVE resources such as pesticides (bad), \nherbicides (not as bad), sucking up more water and soil nutrients than \nnon-subsidized, socially-preferred crops (many a society has fallen to \nmaize).  Animal waste can be a major pollutant, especially since they are \nusually raised in isolated regions where plants aren't profitable. \n Different medical conditions vary in nutritional content \nconsiderably--most refining and additives come with anything grain based or \ncured, cheap meats, which is the trend in population health right now. \n Meanwhile others benefit from the bioavailability of nutrients in eggs and \nmeat, but can't process high fiber foods (or even high calcium foods) like \nbroccoli.  Okay, I'll stop my thought process there.  Nutrition choices, \neven if you go with what's physically best for you and not based on what \nyour ideals and emotions, are highly individual and somewhat dependent on \ngeography.\ufeff",

Concerning self-reported health, vegetarians differ \nsignificantly from each of the other groups, toward poorer health (p = \n000). Moreover, these subjects report higher levels of impairment from \ndisorders (p = .002). Vegetarians additionally report more chronic diseases \nthan those eating a carnivorous diet less rich in meat (p = .000; Table 2). \nSignificantly more vegetarians suffer from allergies, cancer, and mental \nhealth ailments (anxiety, or depression) than the other dietary habit \ngroups (Table 3). Subjects who eat a carnivorous diet rich in meat more \noften report urinary incontinence (p = .023). No differences between \nindividuals consuming different forms of diet were found regarding their \nvascular risk (p = .150; Table 2).",

A goodly amount of the protein we eat \nshould come from nuts. We as a species should eat a lot less carbohydrates. \nWe should eliminate sugar from our diets completely. Eating honey and fruit \nonly occasionally. Green leafy vegetables, coniferous vegetables and only \nthose root vegetables that can be (but don't have to be) eaten raw should \nbe comsumed. Still unless we're talking cannibalism nothing we eat makes us \nbad. Veganism isn't the moral high ground they just act like it is. \ufeff",

I have a cousin who actually went vegan, although \nshe still eats things that have eggs, and occasionally has a hamburger, and \nstuff like that. She obviously isn't a full-on vegan, but she definitely \ndoes not enjoy having a huge T-bone steak every single day (not that \nI/anyone I know does that). I think that if people were to consider the \nvegan lifestyle, they should be more like that. Which is to say, don't \ntotally banish all meat in every form out of your life. Human beings are \nomnivores, meaning we are made to eat both plants, AND animals. Yes, I \ndon't like watching things get shot, but before technology, and before the \nbetter part of our society, people lived off BOTH meat AND \nvegetables/fruits. I'm definitely not a scientist. I have not gone to \nschool, nor have I studied these things on my own. However, my belief is \nthat people should just live balanced. Obviously people will continue to do \nas they will, just as I will continue to do as I will, but I feel as if \nthings would be a lot easier if we could all just agree that as omnivores, \nneither way is wrong. That being said, I am disgusted at the myriad of \ndrugs that are currently being stuck into the animals that we eat in order \nto make them bigger. In that sense, I feel like eating meat is probably \nmore dangerous than it was a century ago... Lol maybe I should just go live \non a farm XD",
