Her debut song was called Mia which was highly underrated and did \nreally badly when she first debuted because it was considered as one of \nthose \"darker songs\" when people were more into the cutesy and poppy songs \nback in 2008. But I would say a lot of her non-title songs are really good \nin her albums as well. I really enjoyed the entire album of her most recent \nalbum, Modern Times, which I think you should get a chance to listen to. If \nyou're interested in her older albums, these are all the ones I can think \nat the top of my head: Good Day, Growing Up, Modern Times, Spring of a \nTwenty Year Old, and Last Fantasy.  ",
