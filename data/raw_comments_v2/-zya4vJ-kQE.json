It's a few inches into his chest, by normal human standards, but because \nof the tube pushing his ribs a little more open then his original sternum \ndid it looks deeper then it is.\n3. Most likely the edge of the lining of his thoracic cavity. So the thin \nlayer of flesh between the open space in your chest and the muscle, fat, \nand bone around it.\n4. That wire was part of an electromagnet that was holding the shrapnel in \nhis chest in position so it doesn't tear his heart to shreds any more then \nit already did. The reason it's so long is that electromagnets work by \nwrapping wire around a frame in large groups so you can force electrons to \nflow through it. One wire came loose and unraveled inside him which is why \nit had stretched out so much rather then being all wrapped up like it \nshould have been.",
