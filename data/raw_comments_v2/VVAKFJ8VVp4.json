It's \nmore like a mathematical framework.\n\nIn the strictest sense, it's a construct of Riemannian geometry (A \n4-dimensional (3 space + 1 time) manifold). It's something that doesn't \nreally exist, but we can infer what happens to it through the properties of \nparticles that exist in it. In General Relativity spacetime is also called \nthe gravitational field, which co-determines with mass. That's basically \nsaying that if you believe the electromagnetic field is made up of real \nparticles, than so must the gravitational field, and hence spacetime.\n\nHowever in Special Relativity, it's basically defined as pseudo-Reimmanian \ngeometry of Minkowski space, aka Lorentzian geometry.\n\nHowever, I like to think of it like the geometry of physics itself. That's \nnot to say there is no tangible thing that makes up the \"fabric\" (Which is \nonly used to provide some sort of very wrong, but good enough visual aid) \nof spacetime, but we probably will never be able to fully conceptualize it.\n\nHonestly, it's another one of those \"we just don't really know\" deals.",

They're \nactually an *effect* of spacetime. A(n extreme) curvature if you will. Over \ntime small (Stellar) black holes will dissipate through Hawking radiation \n(The quantum tunneling of particles), however, larger black holes, the \nsupermassives actually absorb matter through the remnant of the creation of \nthe universe itself, the cosmic microwave background radiation. But one \nday, in the far future, the CMB will cool to the point where they no longer \ncan gain mass or maintain an equilibrium and will slowly dissipate over the \nmillenia like their smaller cousins.\n\nIt's better to, in this context, pretend spacetime doesn't exist. \nEssentially, spacetime is static and non-moving. If you were to punch a \nhole directly through spacetime itself, to us it would be causally \ndisconnected and never have happened. Beyond imagining it doesn't exist in \nthe first place, any way to \"tear the fabric of spacetime\" is impossible. \nIt just can't happen as far as we know. But there's the sticking point. We \njust dunno.",

            "text": "That does make perfect sense and was my initial take on what went on. I've \nheard in different science debates that space time is infinitely distorted, \nor infinitely curved by a black hole. It seems that since the singularity \nis no longer a point in space that maybe one day we could notice this \neffect on space itself. If space is infinitely curved and time is stopped, \nhow does that not effect the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy would \nseem to still have some domain here and if a black hole is moving through \nspace then wouldn't it be either pulling new space into infinity or would \nit just roll across effecting nothing whatsoever because at the point where \nanything could happen, time stops. I'm obviously highly undereducated on \nthe topic but one would thing something would be left behind. If something \nis not then that tells us more about spacetime itself. Hell I don't know \nlol.
