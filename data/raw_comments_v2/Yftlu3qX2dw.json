            "text": "One of the things we now know is Darwinians were lying to us when they \ninsisted that the genetic matter of apes and humans are 98% identical. \n \nDuring the last 12 years, there has been a steady flow of scientific \ndiscoveries informing us that Chimpanzee and human chromosomes are so \nremarkably different that it is inconceivable for the ape genome to evolve \ninto the human genome.  For example:\n \nIn 2010, Nature published a scientific paper entitled \"Chimpanzee and human \nY chromosomes are remarkably divergent in structure and gene content.\" \n(Nature, by the way, is the most respected peer reviewed scientific journal \nfor evolutionary genetics.)\n \nThe paper was the product of several teams of well-respected geneticists \nall of whom were fervent supporters of \"ape to human evolution.\" \n \nNonetheless, they found that:\n \nThe human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y \nchromosome.  Humans have at least 78 genes and Chimpanzees have only 37.\n \nThe Y chromosomes of Chimpanzees and humans are radically different in the \narrangement of their genes. \n \nBoth of these facts make it impossible for apes to have evolved into humans \nbecause there are no genetic mechanisms that would account for the vast \ndifferences between the ape and human Y chromosomes.\n \n\n \n\"Ape to human evolution\" theory asserts that the Chimpanzee Y chromosome \nevolved into the human Y chromosome  and few changes were necessary. \n \nThat is obviously baloney - there is no way that could have happened.  \n \nThere is no genetic mechanism that could have rearranged the genes in the \nChimpanzee Y chromosome to become the human Y chromosome.\n \nThe two chromosomes are so different it is like comparing the chromosomes \nof humans to those of chickens.\n  \nAPE TO HUMAN EVOLUTION IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE\n \nAPES AND HUMANS CANNOT ADD GENES TO THEIR GENOMES\n \n \nThe same research paper also revealed that the human Y chromosome has at \nleast 35 more genes than the Chimpanzee Y chromosome.  \n\n The human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y \nchromosome.  Humans have 41 more genes.\n \nThis means that in order for the ape Y chromosome to evolve into the human \nY chromosome, apes had to add 41 genes.  In order for apes to add genes, \nthey would have to have a genetic mechanism to generate new genes and \ninsert them into their chromosomes.\n \nBut apes do not have any \"gene generating system.\"\n \nNor do apes have a \"gene insertion system.\"\n \nThis means that \"ape to human evolution\" theory is missing the genetic \nmechanisms necessary for evolution to actually take place.\n \nThis is ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE that proves \"ape to human \nevolution\" is impossible,\ufeff",

Darwinians claim that \"chromosome \nfusion\" of two ape chromosomes into a single chromosome resulted in humans \nhaving only 23 pairs of chromosomes while apes have 24 pairs.  But there is \nnot one example of \"chromosome fusion\" in mammals.  Darwinians claim that 1 \nin 1000 human babies have a \"fused chromosome\" but this is an out and out \nlie.  They are actually referring to Robertsonian Translocations, which are \n\"translocations\" and not fused chromosomes and does not result in a change \nin the chromosome number.  Besides, scientifically derived facts refute \n\"chromosome fusion\" can occur in apes or humans.\ufeff",

Yes, one species has modified or adapted itself \nlike the birds in Darwin's Origin of the Species, however there is no \nevidence, definitive evidence, that one kind transformed into, or evolved, \nor became, whatever word you like to use, kind.  Let's me make it clear. \n For instance, there is NO EVIDENCE, that a cat has evolved into a dog, or \nvice-versa.  There are some great chart that try to predict what the common \nancestors were, but there is no evidence behind these chart, do your \nhomework.  None.  It is completely speculative.  Let's call this \nMacro-Evolution and Micro-Evolution (better titled adaptation). \n Micro-evolution (Adaption) has scientific merit, Macro-evolution is a \ngiant, unsubstantiated leap from Micro-Evolution.  These announcers are \nright, if that is what the teacher said, then the school is ridiculous, \nhowever Creationism should be taught in the school system, especially since \nevolution is a theory, which, I believe the evidence shows, is a \nthree-legged stool.  Creationism is also a theory, with the proof lying in \nthe historic truths penned in our heritage.

For example:\n \nIn 2010, Nature published a scientific paper entitled \"Chimpanzee and human \nY chromosomes are remarkably divergent in structure and gene content.\" \n(Nature, by the way, is the most respected peer reviewed scientific journal \nfor evolutionary genetics.)\n \nThe paper was the product of several teams of well-respected geneticists \nall of whom were fervent supporters of \"ape to human evolution.\" \n \nNonetheless, they found that:\n \nThe human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y \nchromosome.  Humans have at least 78 genes and Chimpanzees have only 37.\n \nThe Y chromosomes of Chimpanzees and humans are radically different in the \narrangement of their genes. \n \nBoth of these facts make it impossible for apes to have evolved into humans \nbecause there are no genetic mechanisms that would account for the vast \ndifferences between the ape and human Y chromosomes.\n \n\n \n\"Ape to human evolution\" theory asserts that the Chimpanzee Y chromosome \nevolved into the human Y chromosome  and few changes were necessary. \n \nThat is obviously baloney - there is no way that could have happened.  \n \nThere is no genetic mechanism that could have rearranged the genes in the \nChimpanzee Y chromosome to become the human Y chromosome.\n \nThe two chromosomes are so different it is like comparing the chromosomes \nof humans to those of chickens.\n  \nAPE TO HUMAN EVOLUTION IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE\n \nAPES AND HUMANS CANNOT ADD GENES TO THEIR GENOMES\n \n \nThe same research paper also revealed that the human Y chromosome has at \nleast 35 more genes than the Chimpanzee Y chromosome.  \n\n The human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y \nchromosome.  Humans have 41 more genes.\n \nThis means that in order for the ape Y chromosome to evolve into the human \nY chromosome, apes had to add 41 genes.  In order for apes to add genes, \nthey would have to have a genetic mechanism to generate new genes and \ninsert them into their chromosomes.\n \nBut apes do not have any \"gene generating system.\"\n \nNor do apes have a \"gene insertion system.\"\n \nThis means that \"ape to human evolution\" theory is missing the genetic \nmechanisms necessary for evolution to actually take place.\n \nThis is ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE that proves \"ape to human \nevolution\" is impossible,\n \n ",

Although bacteria can duplicate \nexisting genes by mistake through \"gene duplication,\" this only occurs in \nsingle sex bacteria and this is not evidence that apes and humans can \ncreate new genes with new functions. \n \nDarwin Buster Four:  Darwinians have no explanation for why humans and apes \nhave a different number of chromosomes.  Darwinians claim that \"chromosome \nfusion\" of two ape chromosomes into a single chromosome resulted in humans \nhaving only 23 pairs of chromosomes while apes have 24 pairs.  But there is \nnot one example of \"chromosome fusion\" in mammals.  Darwinians claim that 1 \nin 1000 human babies have a \"fused chromosome\" but this is an out and out \nlie.  They are actually referring to Robertsonian Translocations, which are \n\"translocations\" and not fused chromosomes and does not result in a change \nin the chromosome number.  Besides, scientifically derived facts refute \n\"chromosome fusion\" can occur in apes or humans. \n\nthe fact is they dont teach you everything in school only what they want \nyou to learn and if something is not true but fits to what they say they \nwill not change it or admit to it ",

A religion, according to dictionary.com, is, \"a set of beliefs \nconcerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when \nconsidered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually \ninvolving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral \ncode governing the conduct of human affairs.\" Evolution is not a set of \nbeliefs, it is empirically verified fact. Empirical verification obviously \ndoes not mean it is 100% true; it can only say it is very, very likely. \nAssuming you are a person who literally interprets the Bible, you believe \nin the Abrahamic God and all of that stuff. It is entirely possible the \nuniverse was created four seconds ago with our memories implanted by \nmalevolent fairies. That is an unfalsifiable claim and does not fall into \nthe range of science. You gave yourself some nuance and said that it was \n\"in a way\" a religion. I believe evolution is true the same way you believe \nthat creationism is true. Belief is a belief as long as it is held by a \nconscious creature. The only thing is, as determined by careful observation \nand experiment, which is falsifiable, that evolution is the true belief. \nYou have proven to me that your are scientifically illiterate when you say \nthat evolution is a theory, by which I mean you tout that fact as if it \nwere something tainting evolution. In science there are such things as \ntheories and laws. The colloquial definition of theory as you use it, as a \nquasi-hypothesis, is not the scientific definition of theory. I invite you \nto go look that up right now. \"Public schools are teaching it as fact when \nit's not which is wrong.\" The theory of evolution is supported by an \nenormous amount of evidence. Any counter-proposal to explain the diversity \nand origins of life and species have absolutely no reliability or \nveritability as determined by the scientific methods which are awfully good \nat creating theories that accurately explain the natural world. Creationism \nisn't false in the sense that nothing can truly be false. Look up Russel's \nTeapot if you want a lesson on that. You have to weigh the idea that a god \ncreated the universe 6000 years ago to look like a universe created \nbillions of years ago is an unfalsifiable statement. It is POSSIBLE, but \neven a percentage chance can not be given to such a possibility other than \nthe fact that is does not fit into the framework of accurate predictive \ntheory and evidence we have to reason with. I think we could come to an \nagreement (if you are indeed not a radical skeptic) that schools should not \nteach the idea that the universe was created last Thursday. That is just \nabsurd, right? It is the same \"amount\" of absurd as the idea that the \nuniverse was created 6,000 years ago. Creationism is NOT a major theory. No \nmatter what percent of Americans or scientists believe in creationism, \nscience does not discriminate. To be a major theory, it would have to be \npeer reviewed and explain our world with the evidence we have to view it \nwith. If you believe, for instance, we should teach Creationism despite all \nevidence to the contrary, than it should stand to reason we should teach \nLast Thursdayism. If you are a logical person, then you should understand \nby now how this sort of logic will regress into absurdity because then we \nwill have to teach kids the INFINITE amount of unfalsifiable theories that \nare possible.

If you read the Bible \nyou will know that God is a loving and merciful God and gives people \nchances. He does this by sending his profits and his preachers to warn the \npeople. By reading the Bible it makes sense that Noe did in fact warn the \npeople, but they laughed at him and disregarded the fact that he was \nbuilding an ark. So how did the flood come upon them unaware? How were they \nunaware that there was gonna be a flood even though they saw the huge ark? \nJesus said in Matthew 24:37 that in the last days it will be like the days \nof Noah. In Matthew 24:39 he says they did not understand until the flood \ncame and took them all away. Why is that? They didn't understand because \nthey did not believe even though they saw the Ark.
