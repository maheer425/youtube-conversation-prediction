Snow White is actually just that boring and bad \nXD Animation and voice acting were of the highest quality of that time, but \nkids don't care about that, because that's behind the scenes stuff. What \nthey see is very little by way of humour, a comparatively dull colour \npalette, a plot with no surprises and extremely undeveloped characters. \nPlus the songs are boring.\n\n\nNext time you do movie day, try some better Disney movies. Lion King is \nalways a good choice. The Jungle Book is wonderful as well. Kids love \nMaleficent from Sleeping Beauty. Lady and the Tramp, A Bug's Life, The \nLittle Mermaid, Aladdin...\n\n\nActually, literally anything Disney except Snow White. You'll see that most \nof the stuff I suggested is animal-heavy as well. I think kids can relate \nto Frozen well because it's an everyone thing, instead of a girl's only \nkind of deal. Disney's animal movies have great characterization, and all \nkids typically love them. The Lion King in particular. It gets very, very \nreal and teaches kids about consequences, responsibility, family and love.\n\n\nAnd guys, stop hating on Frozen, yeesh. It's not the best movie out there, \nit's cliched as hell and I don't really enjoy it much either. But they're \ngrowing up with this like you grew up with the classics. Personal taste and \nexperiences matter. Things that Frozen did beautifully were the \nenvironment, animation, humour and some decent action sequences. Credit \nwhere credit's due.",

Through the whole movie I had no idea where Elsa's power came \nfrom(if they did mention it I didn't hear). From all the movies I've \nwatched the villains are the ones who either creates the problem or the one \ncreates a huge and I mean huge obstacle for the problem to be solved and I \ndidn't see that in frozen. To me the prince is not really interesting. \nWhenever I watch a movie it may seems crazy but I always have mixed feeling \ntowards the villain. I never fully hate them. I hate/love them(except in \nsome few very movies). I just didn't feel anything towards the prince he \nwas just a character that was just there. I really liked that they were \ntrying to show the sister sister love thing but they should have gone with \ntheir first idea at making Elsa the main villain. The prince and the other \nGillian's should have still be there but you know Elsa would have been the \nbig hit. Also I think gif Elsa was the main villain it would have proved \nhow strong their sisterly love is. Anna would have had to go through much \nmore obstacles to save Elsa and her determination would also show her love \nand how strong she is as a person. By then everybody would have hated Elsa. \nEveryone would take every chance they get to kill her and I think they \nwould have even tried to kill Anna. If I'm not wrong I think they were \ntrying to pass the message that girls don't need a man to do something well \nby Anna going against everybody to save her sister this would have showed \nit. Throughout the movie Anna showed a characteristic of innocence and I \nafter all this trauma (Elsa rejecting her,the guys who she thought she love \nturned out to be a bad guy,and he people going against her just to try to \nkill her sister) she would have gone through she would showed a huge \ncharacter development. Of course she would have still been the same old Ana \nwe all know and love but she would have learned a lot through her journey. \nAnd in the end it would be really cool to see the prince be a really \ninteresting villain and we see Elsa, Anna and the guy,the reindeer and \nsnowmen gam up against him. It would show teamwork and friendship. Although \nthere were plot hole in the movie what I really wanted to say was that it \ndoesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Frozen is a really cool movie. It's \nnot an over the sky too amazing beautiful perfect movie but it's great. I \nheard there's gonna be a sequel I hope it tells how Elsa get's her powers. \nIt would be cool to see some legends and real action and I want Elsa to \nfind real love because in frozen it almost seemed lie, sje didn't belive in \nlove and I would like to see her not being so cold towards people. \ufeff",
