            "text": "Again on Great Gatsby, because I had it in English class this past month \nand the question of Gatsby's possible heroism was THE essay question of \nessay questions, and I really like it. So here's me answer: no, he is not. \nNow, it isn't because Gatsby is inherently a bad man or without value; he \njust isn't heroic. In Greek mythos, a hero was favoured by the gods; a hero \nis often seen as someone with more-than-human strengths or virtues or \nabilities. Gatsby is a mortal man, obviously, and so doesn't fit the Greek \nmythos -- but that is an archaic definition, not an end goal. That being \nsaid, he is not more virtuous than the other characters in the book or in \nother books. While many people in my class and outside of it will mention \nGatsby's generosity, claiming the dress that was ripped in a past party and \nreplaced without prompting, I don't see that as so selfless as it is often \nbelieved to be. That is to say that I believe that most of Gatsby's \ngenerosity is selfishly driven -- replace a damaged dress so that you don't \nbecome unlikeable, because if you are, the parties fade away and you have \nnothing to make the girl of your dreams notice you. Gatsby is not stronger \nthan the average, either, be it intellectually or physically. He is a \nnervous and flighty individual -- and while the same could be said for me, \nI am also not a hero. That's okay.\n\nCarlyle's definition of heroism is the one that Gatsby approaches most: a \ncharacter who overcomes fear, acts with sincerity, perceives beyond the \nusual, and acts as an inspiration. While Gatsby is flighty and hesitant, \nand his inability to choose yes or no is highly frustrating, he does \novercome a good amount of fear to see Daisy after those years, despite \ndoing so with hesitation and prodding from Nick. He behaves with occasional \nsincerity, specifically toward Daisy -- but also with, at times, complete \ndishonesty and veiled intentions. Gatsby does not seem to perceive beyond \nthe usual in the sense I would most likely expect; while he sees an \n'enchanted object,' as you put it, he does not see through people or \nintentions, and the inspiration he serves leads people to the breakdown of \nthe American Dream and the ashes in the end. So, overall, is Gatsby a hero? \nNot in my mind, no -- but he is an important character, more like the \ncharacter in a folk tale who serves to teach a moral lesson.\ufeff",

While reading \nthat great novel  at 3 am I felt that I could  in some way relate to every \nsingle character in that book. Like Pudge, I wanted to seek a great \nperhaps, something that could change my life forever. But then you go on to \nsay :The most important part of storytelling is making the audience care. \nIf your characters are not likable, you've lost your story. I do not \nbelieve this is true. If you have ever taken the time to read the latest \nnovels by J.K Rowling, you would realize that the main character is just so \nunlikable and not worth reading an entire book about, but then you come \nback to it. It's  not the character that makes a book special, even though \nthey play important parts, its the plot, the wording and how the book makes \nyou feel. I found it hard to read the first few chapters of the hunger \ngames even though Katniss and her family were described perfectly, in a way \nthat you almost knew them in your real life, but nothing was happening. \nThere were no \" Hopers of high flung hopes, dreamers of long gone dreams\". \nIt's not character that makes a book, it's how they interact with each \nother. No single character can make you want to say \" OH GOD I HATE HIM IM \nNEVER EVER READING THIS AGAIN!\" unless they do something so terrible and \noffensive that not even someone like Hermione Jean Granger could make up \nfor it, but no one character could make you stay for the book, in my \nopinion.\ufeff",
