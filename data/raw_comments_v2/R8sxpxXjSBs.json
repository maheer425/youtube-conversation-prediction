I think Subbable is a great idea and I'm sorry that I can't \ncontribute (I'm too young to have a credit card). \nWhen you first told us about this idea you said that this is voluntary, and \nthat it would be the same Scishow it always was for that who can't pay. \nThis is still true, but it isn't a long leap from releasing videos sooner \nfor Subbable subscribers to making special videos only for Subbable \nsubscribers to making most/all of the videos only for Subbable subscribers.\nYou guys are great and I know you don't want to get to that point, but it's \nhard to notice when it happens slowly. Please be careful as to the \ndifference between Subbable and non-Subbable subscribers.\nLots of love, someone who loves the show but can't pay.\ufeff",
