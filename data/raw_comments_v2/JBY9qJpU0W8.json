            "text": "Another important thing you should have pointed out was that the aliens \nmight have been a symptom of Billy's PTSD. They're plunger shaped. What do \nplungers do? They remove blocked up shit. And Billy has a lot of blocked up \nshit inside him that he needs to remove. That shit inside him is guilt at \nhaving participated in the war and come out successful and alive on the \nother end. It's also his sense of inadequacy; the book always mentions how \nweak he is and at one point he even has to dress up in a toga and \nCinderella shoes ( he's emasculated). He even marries an ''ugly'' wife so \nher Dad will make him more money. On Tralfamadore he can rewrite all that. \nHe's kept in a zoo like how he was kept prisoner by the Germans (you \nusually keep animals in zoos and slaughterhouses [it's ironic that he \nsurvived the Dresden bombing in a slaughterhouse] ) but in the zoo the \naliens think he's a splendid specimen and he gets to mate with a porn star. \nThe Tralfamadorians' philosophy is summed up by the phrase ''so it goes'' \nwhich is repeated every time someone dies in the book. It's a fatalistic \nview of the Universe which removes free will and so removes guilt. If Billy \ncan just convince himself that all the atrocities he has seen are \ninevitable (and that no one really dies but survives in a past that can be \nexperienced all at once when you see in four dimensions like the aliens) \nthen he can cope with the death and destruction and horror of the war, and \nremove any guilt he had. \ufeff",

That's why there are so many mentions of \nbabies and Jesus in the book. In one chapter Billy is asleep in a green \ncoffin-shaped wagon (as if he's dead). He's then woken up by two Germans \nwho are obstetricians but never had a kid themselves. When he's woken from \nhis coffin these baby-deliverers rebuke him like a naughty child for the \nexhaustion of the horses pulling the wagon. And like a baby who has just \nbeen born, he cries for the first time in the war. \ufeff",
