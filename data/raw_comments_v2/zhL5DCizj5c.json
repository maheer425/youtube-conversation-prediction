European \ncountries who broke from Roman Catholicism had a church that didn't \nsurround them with images of saints, miracles and superstition. Instead of \npraying for crops, or good fishing weather or whatever. Protestants we're \non their own and had to think of ways to improve things without help from \nthe patron saint of whatever. To this day protestant European counties are \nseen as having better engineers than catholic counterparts. Who are seen as \nhaving better art.\n\nSecondly and this is much more general as it reaches much further back than \nHenry 8th. Europeans are the children of Aristotle. Question everything, \nquestion your teachers. This way of thinking leads to innovation. Asians \nare the children of Confucius. Respect the old ways, teacher knows best. \nChina's massive technological lead dwindled because of this. \ufeff",
