Did the Lord bless this man or did the boys? I believe the Lord \nheard his pleading and inspired the older boy to be an instrument in \nblessing the man. From whom did the money come? At first glance it would \nseem it came from the boys. The Lord ways are higher than ours, His \nthoughts higher than ours. I do not believe all that we acquire is strictly \nfrom our own actions and abilities. Without the Lord, I am nothing. I love \nthe parable of the talents because the talents, like our abilities, are \ngiven from the Lord. However, it is up to us to increase them with effort, \njudgement and exercise. I see the increase as coming from the Lord as well, \nbut it is conditional upon our efforts. Sometimes the Lord \"taketh away\" as \nwith the man working in the field here. In those times we pray, plead and \ndo all in our power to bring about change. I have been the recipient of \ntender mercies like the one shown here many times. I feel deeply those who \nput the proverbial coins in my shoe were inspired from on high. Many of \nthem did not know of our need or the perfection of their timing in coming \nto our rescue.",
