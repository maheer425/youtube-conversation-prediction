            "text": "That is fascinating!  A great hypothesis about why we evolved \nticklishness... but it does leave something unanswered - why only \nprimates?  Why don't other mammals have this exact same thing?  They have \nvulnerable body parts.  They could benefit from learning to defend \nthemselves.  My guess would be that it boils down to our profoundly social \nnature.  We actually care how a person responds to our actions.  Other \nanimals simply do not.  They survive thanks to strength, speed, natural \narmor, venom, or a host of other methods.  Primates, most especially \nbonobos and humans, lack all of those things.  We survive socially (even \nour wits wouldn't have factored in very much during our early development - \nprior to development of speech, and WAY before actually developing rational \nthought).  Though our society likes to pretend its not true (and they \nsuffer violence, aggression, anxiety, depression, and other things because \nof it), humans need touch.  Infants can die solely from lack of touch, even \nif all of their other survival needs are met.  It's why sex is extremely \npleasurable for bonobos and humans while most other animals get no pleasure \nfrom it.  It's why sex, for humans, is primarily about pleasure and social \nbonding, not reproduction.  Tickling is another way humans are encouraged \nto touch one another, and those who practice it and enjoy it the most get a \nsurvival benefit (learning self defense as children).  Other animals simply \ndon't have the biological need for touch and intense social bonding.  They \nmight have venom or armor plating, but we've got cuddling.  And that's why \nwe're at the top of the food chain.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Brandon Bustos I'm positively surprised how you're actually providing \nfacts and conclusions. Anyways, let's get this show on the road.\n\n1. Yes, while free oxygen was toxic to the primal lifeforms, that doesn't \nmake independent life on Earth impossible.\nLike you mentioned, Earth's atmosphere had no oxygen in the beginning of \nlife. This didn't matter because the first lifeforms were anaerobic. This \nmeans that they didn't require any oxygen. They used photosynthesis, kind \nof like plants. They also lived in the ocean, which provided them relative \nprotection against UV. As we know, photosynthesis generates oxygen. Over \nthe course of millions of years, oxygen started to seriously stack up \nforming a grand atmosphere and became a problem for the obligate anaerobes, \nand so natural selection favored organisms that are resistant to oxygen. \nAnd in time multicellural sea life began to form, then fish and you know \nthe rest of the story.\n\n2. You could use common sense to figure this one out. When you constantly \nchange small details in something, gradually the whole thing will change. \nIf a wolf can evolve to a Great Dane, it can evolve further. It does not \nsimply \"stop\" at some point magically, it keeps going in its slow pace \nwithout stopping. If you accept microevolution, then macroevolution would \nfollow. I don't see how you think that there's some kind of \"borders\" or \n\"points\" of which a creature couldn't evolve any further.\nAbsurd.\n\n3. Natural selection. Certain traits that favor the survival of a group is \nmore likely to reproduce and pass their improved genes. It is an \nagonizingly slow process, but it's basically what evolution is all about. \nIt's like the saying goes, \"In the kingdom of the blind, one eyed man is \nking.\" so if an individual has say, a gland that is sensitive to light or a \nsingle bump in his skin that can be used to crawl around, it gives the \nindividual a great advantage against the ones that lack these qualities. \nHis offspring might have better versions of this odd mutation, which in \nturn would eventually evolve the simple light-sensitive gland into an eye \nand that weird bump in the skin into feet.\n\n4. There is no #4, so I'll just fill this space with god.\nHeh, I love irony.\n\n5. We perceive different species because we have categorized every being \nthat we consider \"different species\" with names. There are plenty of \nsub-species and variants that exist. Some species can even cross-breed, \nlike horses and donkeys. A crossbreed of a horse and a donkey is called a \nmule, which is a sterile animal that can't have children because horse and \ndonkey have been so long separated as species that they can no longer have \nfertile children. Literally every animal that exists has ancestry that \nconnects them to a more primitive animal. Some of them are extinct and some \nof them still thrive. You just refuse to look at the evidence.\n\n6. UGH!! Are you seriously comparing chemical evolution with spontaneous \ngeneration?\nIt has been proven that organic matter can be made from non-organic matter \nwith enough power (such as an electric current of a bolt of lightning). \nThis ORGANIC matter eventually formed into cellular life. You would have to \ntake a course to study this, but you wouldn't do that would you? It would \ncontradict with your pals Jesus and God.\n\n7. Gradual small changes that eventually result in big changes (see: 2 & 3)\n\n8. Some stray nucleotides sometimes get tangled with RNA. Usually this just \nresults in useless \"trash data\" that has no real function. But when \nmutated, this \"trash data\" might result in a change of the code of a being, \npotentially resulting in evolution.",

            "text": "+Mestis Our present atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen (N2), 21% molecular \noxygen (O2), and 1% of other gases, such as carbon dioxide CO2), argon \n(Ar), and water vapor H2O). An atmosphere containing free oxygen would be \nfatal to all origin of life schemes. While oxygen is necessary for life, \nfree oxygen would oxidize and thus destroy all organic molecules required \nfor the origin of life. Thus, in spite of much evidence that the earth has \nalways had a significant quantity of free oxygen in the atmosphere,3 \nevolutionists persist in declaring that there was no oxygen in the earth's \nearly atmosphere. However, this would also be fatal to an evolutionary \norigin of life. If there were no oxygen there would be no protective layer \nof ozone surrounding the earth. Ozone is produced by radiation from the sun \non the oxygen in the atmosphere, converting the diatomic oxygen(O2) we \nbreathe to triatomic oxygen O3), which is ozone. Thus if there were no \noxygen there would be no ozone. The deadly destructive ultraviolet light \nfrom the sun would pour down on the surface of the earth unimpeded, \ndestroying those organic molecules required for life, reducing them to \nsimple gases, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. Thus, \nevolutionists face an irresolvable dilemma: in the presence of oxygen, life \ncould not evolve; without oxygen, thus no ozone, life could not evolve or \nexist.This pretty much means that life its self could not happen.\n2. The second flaw is the problem of extending \u201cmicroevolution\u201d into \n\u201cmacroevolution.\u201d Laboratory studies have shown that organisms are capable \nof adaptation. That is, living things have an ability to shift their \nbiology to better fit their environment. However, those same studies have \ndemonstrated that such changes can only go so far, and those organisms have \nnot fundamentally changed. These small changes are called \u201cmicroevolution.\u201d \nMicroevolution can result in some drastic changes, such as those found in \ndogs. All dogs are the same species, and one can see how much variation \nthere is. But even the most aggressive breeding has never turned a dog into \nsomething else. There is a limit to how large, small, smart, or hairy a dog \ncan become through breeding. Experimentally, there is no reason to suggest \nthat a species can change beyond its own genetic limits and become \nsomething else.\n\nLong-term evolution, though, requires \u201cmacroevolution,\u201d which refers to \nthose large-scale changes. Microevolution turns a wolf into a Chihuahua or \na Great Dane. Macroevolution would turn a fish into a cow or a duck. There \nis a massive difference in scale and effect between microevolution and \nmacroevolution. This flaw in the theory of evolution is that \nexperimentation does not support the ability of many small changes to \ntransform one species into another.\n\n3.The complexity of living systems could never evolve by chance\u2014they had to \nbe designed and created. \nA system that is irreducibly complex is one in which all the components \nwork together and are essential to perform the system\u2019s basic function. (A \nmousetrap is a simple example.) It is not possible to build such a system \ngradually, one component at a time, since it cannot function unless all \ncomponents are present.  Many living systems exhibit such irreducible \ncomplexity (e.g vision, blood clotting, etc.). When you look at a watch, \nyou assume there was a watchmaker. A watch is too complex to \u201chappen\u201d by \nchance. Yet living systems are vastly more complex than a watch. Darwin \nconsidered this fact one of the most serious challenges to his theory of \nevolution.  The magnitude of this challenge has increased exponentially \nsince Darwin\u2019s time as the details of living systems have been uncovered \ndown to and below the level of the cell.  The incredible machinery of life \nexists in networks so complex and interdependent that they could not have \narisen gradually or through random chance \u2013 they simply had to be designed \nand created.\n\n5. There is a total lack of undisputed examples (fossilized or living) of \nthe millions of transitional forms required for evolution to be true. \nIf evolution were true, we should be surrounded by a zoo of transitional \nforms that cannot be categorized as one particular life form. But we don\u2019t \nsee this\u2014there are different kinds of dogs, but all are clearly dogs. The \nfossils show different sizes of horses, but all are clearly horses. None is \non the verge of being some other life form. The fossil record shows complex \nfossilized life suddenly appearing, and there are major gaps between every \nmajor \u201ckind\u201d of life.  Darwin acknowledged that if his theory were true, it \nwould require millions of transitional forms. He believed they would be \nfound in fossil records. They haven\u2019t been.\n\n6 .Evolution is said to have begun by spontaneous generation\u2014a concept \nridiculed by biology. \nWhen I was a sophomore in high school, , my biology class spent the first \nsemester discussing how ignorant people used to believe that garbage gave \nrise to rats, and raw meat produced maggots. This now disproven concept was \ncalled \u201cspontaneous generation.\u201d Louis Pasteur proved that life only comes \nfrom life\u2014this is the law of biogenesis. The next semester we studied \nevolution, where we learned that the first living cell came from a freak \ncombination of nonliving material (where that nonliving material came from \nwe were not told). \u201cChemical Evolution\u201d is just another way of saying \n\u201cspontaneous generation\u201d\u2014life comes from nonlife. Evolution is therefore \nbuilt on a fallacy science long ago proved to be impossible.\ufeff\n\n7.The high information content of DNA could only have come from \nintelligence. \nAccording to information science, information can only be produced by \nintelligence. Highly complex information must originate from a highly \nintelligent source.  DNA is by far the most compact and complex information \nstorage/retrieval system known. A pinhead-sized amount of DNA has a billion \ntimes more information capacity than a 4-gigabit hard drive, can contain \nmultiple copies of all the information necessary to build and maintain \nthings as complex as the human brain and body, and is self-replicating. \n However, the proponents of evolution believe that random chance, not \nintelligence, gave rise to all of the information found in DNA. \n Ironically, evolutionary scientists involved in the Search for \nExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project search the sky with massive \nradio telescopes, hoping to detect even simple patterns in radio signals \nwhich might be a sign of otherworldly intelligence, all the while ignoring \nthe clear evidence of intelligence built into the incredibly complex DNA \npatterns of every living creature right here on Earth. \n\n8.Mutations do not increase information, as required by evolution. \nMutations are thought to drive evolution, but they cannot increase \ninformation.  Mutations can only change DNA by deleting, damaging, \nduplicating, or substituting already existing information.  The vast \nmajority of mutations are harmful or have no apparent effect.  Over 100 \nyears of fruit fly experiments have clearly demonstrated that mutations \nonly result in normal, dead, or grotesquely deformed fruit flies \u2013 they are \nstill fruit flies!  Even mutations which are in some way beneficial (such \nas antibiotic resistance in bacteria or wingless beetles on windy islands) \nresult from the loss of information.  This is the opposite of the vast \nincrease in information required to get from amoeba to man, as proposed in \nthe theory of evolution.\ufeff\n(also we have not seen any change of kind as stated in darwin's theory) \nnote: don't mind my english xD",

Seeing as how humans use laughter and smiling as way of \ncommunicating a joking or nonthreatening attitude, it would seem to support \nthe idea of tickling and its connection to laughter as part of a \nplay-fighting behavior. This seems especially true since you can't trigger \nthe same response on your own, and often times if the recipient is in a bad \nmood they can \"turn off\" the ticklish response and stop laughing.\ufeff",
