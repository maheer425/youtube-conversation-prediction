Not for who they are.\nSPOILERS ALERT\nEven at the end of the movie, when he is getting arrested by the cops, he \ntells the cops that he takes care them, but really he doesn't. He does not \n\"love\" them, and that's obvious since he is making money off of there \nbodies and also not to mention, kills two of his own women(Amber & Blondie) \nwhen he feels betrayed by them. If you love someone, you will not try to \nsell their bodies to anyone. And if you love someone, you will not kill \nthem because they have betrayed/hurt you or were simply just trying to \nleave you. And if someone tries to leave you, its obvious you're doing \nsomething wrong.",

            "text": "+simon6071 ~I~ don't think the movie has an ideological message, in fact I \nsaid the exact opposite, I think it's you who have the ideological motives \nhere and hence why I said what I said.\n\nAnd in the real world there is plenty of female dominated evil which was \nalso part of my point.\n\nThere are three possible reasons why you \"present your prejudice with a \npretentious display of convoluted language\";\n\nA. Didn't even bother to read what I said in its entirety.\n\nB. Did read it but completely failed to grasp my meaning.\n\nC. Did read it, did grasp my full meaning, realised it somehow disagreed \nthe patriarchy, rape culture, etc etc that is the cherished fantasy of \nfeminazism and in the true spirit of that debased ideology you now must \nattempt to obfuscate, distort, and blatantly lie in order to discredit and \nsilence any and all opposition regardless of the facts.\n\nClearly it's C and as such I am not going to try to reason with you and \npick your accusations and fallacious statements apart with mere facts as \nyou cannot reason with feminazi's nor their mangina allies.\n\nI hope and think that anyone capable of critical thinking will understand \nwhat I am saying in my previous reply and its not mitigated one little bit \nby your several attempts to reduce this to a personal battle of insults.\n\nMoreover your personal attacks only lessen any point you ~may~ of had \nbecause the fact you have to attempt to score points against me personally \nonly shows you have no interested in ~making~ a point. \n\nI am not sorry that you find my use of the English language to make my \npoints offensive, I am not sorry that I can articulate my arguments without \nresorting to pathetic attempts at personal insults and attacks.\n\nP.S. one minor thing I have to point out, the \"nazi zombies\" are in fact \nGerman zombies in a trench system over which biplanes and zeppelins are \nfighting. Clearly this is a scene based on world war one campaigns, \n1914-1918 which gave us the Versi treaty which is often held up as a \nprominent cause of the disaffection of the German people which Hitler and \nhis Nazi party exploited in the years running up to the second world war.\n\nJust another indication of a lack of basic understanding evident in your \nreply.",

It's not the \nconcoction of feminists.\nIf dressing sexy is what it takes for girls to get the message across, so \nbe it.\nFemininazism? Those girls were fight Nazi zombies in the movie, weren't \nthey? I love it. Wonder how femininazism and misogyny could come in play in \nthe situation.\nYou think holding the view that there is a problem of male dominated evil \nin this world is a form of extremism?\nThank you for telling me about your extremism.\nIt's only your prejudiced view that Sucker Punch the movie was only meant \nto be for pure entertainment and employment with no food for thought.\nI don't think this movie has anything to do with politics, neither has my \ncomment for this movie. That you somehow think just because a movie has \nhidden ideological message then it would lose its innocence is just \nignorant.\nYou are quite successful in convincing me that you are very talented in \npresenting your prejudice with a pretentious display of convoluting \nlanguage.",

            "text": "+simon6071 Its not \"male dominated evil\" its just plain old evil, men and \nwomen are involved in it in the film as they are in real life.\n\nIts ironic to me that when female characters like those portrayed in Sucker \nPuncher are the \"under dogs\" fighting against presumed \"male dominated \nevil\" that its OK for them to be dressed up as school girls, in hot pants, \nboob tubes, mini skirts, leotards, fishnet tights etc etc and this makes \nthem ~plucky~ and have \"fighting spirit\" but if a similarly attired \ncharacter is portrayed in a film or video game where she happens to be just \na random bystander in the story or anything but the lead heroine that this \nsuddenly transmutes through the power of femininazism into misogyny. \n\nI put it to you that extremism comes in many forms and will alter, twist \nand obscure the truth of anything in order to promote its own debased \nideology and/or denigrate opponents of its debased ideology.\n\nSome, arguable most, further arguably all stories and films are no more \nthan they appear and should be taken at face value as entertainment for us \nand employment for the cast with all due benefit of the doubt. To be left \nalone by all political and ideological commentators who seek to exploit \nthat which is innocent in order to promoted their particular (twisted) \nworld view.",
