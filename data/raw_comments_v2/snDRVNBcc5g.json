Anyways what I am trying to say is that I have seen many groups come \nand go.. some after releasing just one song and others that slowly fade out \nafter about 3 or 4 songs. If a group is promoted and prepared well then \nthey should do alright. I like this group. I like the robots dancing in the \nbackground. when they all dance like that it leaves me with a feeling that \nit looks really cool. Yes the MV was a little fuzzy but the quality of the \nsound still came through and that is what matters. I really like Eddy's \nvoice and I think he rounds the group out nicely. If they keep it up and \nhave good promotions I can see them making it. They could probably make it \nover here because they have Jackie Chan backing them and he is pretty big \nover here. ( I'm also a Jackie chan fan.) I'm not saying I like this group \njust because of him though. At least with this group I look forward to see \nwhat they are going to do next unlike some other groups where i listen to \nthe song and I am just not interested in them. This group at least creates \nsome interest. Sorry for the long post lol \ufeff",
