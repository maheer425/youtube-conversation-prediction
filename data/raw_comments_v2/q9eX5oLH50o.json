After a \nfew days of her not running out to greet my wife when we would get home we \nstarted asking around about her. Someone had broken into her apartment \nHalloween morning and shoved a dish rag down her throat, leaving her to die \non her Kitchen floor.\n\nWhat made this all the more fucked up is I was taking out the trash around \nthe time they think she was murdered. Our can was located 10 feet in front \nof her kitchen window. I didn't hear a thing and I thought the silhouette I \nsaw at her kitchen window was just her watching me--she was a very weird \nwoman with a lot of problems mentally and she often just watched me take \nout the trash. She wouldn't wave or respond if I waved, so I didn't bother \nto say anything to her. \n\nA few weeks after that there was another person murdered across town in \nabout the same fashion, only this time it was a sponge used to choke the \nperson to death and a lot of stuff was stolen. A friend whose brother works \nfor the fire department said that the police didn't think the two events \nwere connected. I guess he was right, because I've not heard about anymore \nmurders involving cleaning supplies. \ufeff",
