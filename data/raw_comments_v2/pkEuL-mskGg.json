Unfortunately I don't know how to \ncode the app myself so need to pay a developer.  Most apps that are free \neither have massive ads all over them which you have to pay to remove, or \nin-app purchases so they can recover the costs of making the app.  Think of \nit as buying me a coffee for all of the time it took to make and film and \nedit the cake video (which is free) and coming up with the idea for the app \nand all the hours of work that went into getting it made.  :D  Having said \nthat I am running a competition to give away 5 freebies to enter simply \nshare the video on fb or g+ or twitter and remember to comment below with a \nlink to where you shared it.  You can enter once for each share.  I will \nrandomly pick the winner next Friday.  Have a great week.\ufeff",
