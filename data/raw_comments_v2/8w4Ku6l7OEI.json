This is possibly because \nof a lack of leadership for the communists, or because there were lots of \nidealogical divisions between them. The Islamic government then prosecuted \nthe Communists too - many people who had been released from jail by the \nfall of the Shah were re-imprisoned by Khomeini.

The whole Sunni-Shia split was originally over \npower, and the twelver Shia sect evolved after the much less radical Zaidi \nand Ismaili sects, and turned the whole split into one of religion, as they \ninvented many customs and practices, including the insulting of the Sahaba \nand Sunni Caliphs.\nAnyways, Shiites (again, I mean twelver when I say this) are power-hungry. \nLook at what they do in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. They talk \nabout the oppression of Shiites constantly and play the victim card, yet \nwhen they're in power they oppress Sunnis (plenty of evidence online of \nbeheadings of innocents, rape, torture, etc.) and justify it in any way \npossible. Iran was Sunni up until 1501 when Ismail 1 came and he forced the \nmajority (like, 95% majority) Sunni population to convert to twelver \nShiism, which took hold only in small areas in Khorasan (all the stans.)\nMost of this video is correct, but to say twelver Shiites stand against \noppression is completely false.
