If you were unarmed, but viewed as a worthy \nopponent to hunt, they would disarm themself and hunt you in unarmed \ncombat. Depending on the weapons you use, they would arm themself more, or \nless, to balance the field into a worthy, but challenging foe. Take the \nXenomorphs for example, they use many weapons against the Aliens, but they \ndo not use all in their arsenal, as it would be deemed as a dishonorable \nact. \n\nTake the Predator in well, Predator. After being defeated in honorable \ncombat, he committed the dishonorable act of using his wrist to activate \nhis bomb. In predator hierarchy, he would be marked as bad blood, and \nkilled, or banished from his clan. \n\nShould they be killed, a Predator's ship will return automatically to the \nhomeworld, taking with it a record of the individual's hunt, recorded \nthrough their Bio-Mask.\n\nThe honorable thing to do in that situation, would be to die honorably. He \ndidn't do that. The predator up to that point, was honorable with his use \nof weapons. Since the human was using his environment to his advantage, \nusing spears and the like, along with setting traps and decoys. He was a \nworthy foe to hunt. Physically, and mentally in the case of him having been \nintelligent enough to counter the use the predators vision, and the ability \nto counter him with traps.\n\nDespite the ferocity and brutality with which Predators hunt and kill their \nprey, they adhere to a strict code of honor that forbids them from killing \nchildren or unarmed adults. They have also been known to spare pregnant \nwomen and those with terminal illnesses, although they will not hesitate to \nkill such targets if directly attacked by them.\ufeff",

Survival was simple \nbut very enjoyable: DM until first blood, the one who died goes to be an \nalien the rest team up to survive as lnog as possible. Any marine who does \nbecomes an alien, and aliens respawn. Usualyl there were a 10 minute limit \nif the marines managed to lvie that lnog they won. Other than that the \nlonger oyu lived the more points you scored.\nThen there were the usual DM and TDM matches.\nThen overrun which was usually played with the two human factions (marines \nand corporates) as a standard VS match with 2 lives usually. (Aslo as a \nhouse rule weapons were limited for knife, pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle) . \nHunt was a predator vs corporates game (most of the time) were a smalll \nnubmer of predators (1 in most cases) were against a larger nubmer of \nhumans. Whoever killed the predator became the new predator.\nThen EVAC was a game where marines had to go from A to B and hold position \nfor a short time while aliens tried to stop them, both teams had limited \nlives.
