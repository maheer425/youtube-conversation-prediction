Jukka S. (BM) believes that school does not provide \nenough challenges for intelligent students: \u201cI think my only concern is \nthat we give lots of support to those pupils who are underachievers, and we \ndon\u2019t give that much to the brightest pupils.  I find it a problem, since I \nthink, for the  future of a whole nation, those pupils who are really the \nstars should be supported, given some more challenges, given some more \ndifficulty in their exercises and so on.  To not just spend  their time \nhere but to make some effort and have the idea to become something, no \nmatter what field you are choosing, you must not only be talented like they \nare, but work hard.  That is needed. \u201c\nPia (EL)  feels that the schools do not motivate very intelligent students \nto work.   She thinks the schools should provide more challenges for the \nacademically talented students.  In fact, she thinks the current school \nsystem in Finland does not provide well for its students.  Mixed-ability \nclassrooms, she feels, are worse than the previous selective system: \u201c I \nthink this school is for nobody.  That is my private opinion. Actually I \nthink so, because when you have all these people at mixed levels in your \nclass, then you have to concentrate on the ones who need the most help, of \ncourse.  Those who are really good, they get lazy. \u201c\nPia believes these students become bored and lazy, and float through school \nwith no study skills.  Jonny (EM) describes how comprehensive education \nplaces the academically gifted at a disadvantage: \u201cWe have lost a great \npossibility when we don\u2019t have the segregated levels of math and natural \nsciences\u2026 That should be once again taken back and started with.  The good \ntalents are now torturing themselves with not very interesting education \nand  teaching in classes that aren\u2019t for their best.\nPia (EL) finds the PISA frenzy about Finland amusing, since she believes \nthe schools have declined in recent years: \u201cI think [the attention] is \nquite funny because school isn\u2019t as good as it used to be \u2026 I used to be \nproud of being a teacher and proud of this school, but I can\u2019t say I \u2019m \nproud any more.\u201d\nAino (BS) states that the evenness and equality of the education system has \na \u201cdark side.\u201d Teaching to the \u201cmiddle student\u201d in a class of heterogeneous \nability bores the gifted students, who commonly do not perform well in \nschool.  Maarit (DMS) finds teaching heterogeneous classrooms very \ndifficult.  She admits that dividing the students into ability levels would \nmake the teaching easier, but worries that it may affect the self-esteem of \nthe weaker worse than a more egalitarian system        Similarly, Terttu \n(FMS) thinks that the class size is a detriment to the students\u2019 learning.  \nEven though Finnish schools have relatively small class sizes, she thinks \nthat a group of twenty is too large, since she does not have time for all \nof the students: \u201cYou don\u2019t have enough time for everyone \u2026 All children \nhave to be in the same class.  That is not so nice.  You have the better \npupils.  I can\u2019t give them as much as I want.  You have to go so slowly in \nthe classroom.\u201d   Curiously, Jukka E. (DL) thinks that the special \neducation students need more support and the education system needs to \nimprove in that area.\nMiikka (FL) describes how he will give extra work to students who want to \nhave more academic challenges, but admits that \u201cthey can get quite good \ngrades, excellent grades, by doing nothing actually, or very little.\u201d  \nMiikka (FL) describes discussion in educational circles about creating \nschools and universities for academically talented students: 3 Everyone has \nthe same chances\u2026One problem is that it can be  too easy for talented \nstudents.  There has been now discussion in Finland if there should be \nschools and universities for talented students\u2026 I think it will happen, but \nI don\u2019t know if it is good, but it will happen, I think so.  I am also \nafraid there will be private schools again in Finland in the future \u2026 \n[There] will be more rich people and more poor people, and then will come \nso [many] problems in comprehensive schools that some day quite  soon \u2026 \nparents will demand that we should have private schools  again, and that is \nquite sad.\n \nLinda (AL), however, feels the love of reading has declined in the younger \ngeneration, as they tend to gravitate more to video games and television.   \nMiikka (FL), also a teacher of mother tongue, also cites a decline in \nreading interest and an increase of video game and computer play.  Saij a \n(BL) agrees. As a teacher of Finnish, she feels that she has difficulty \nmotivating her students to learn: \u201cI think my subject is not the \u2026 easiest \none to teach.   They don\u2019t read so much, newspapers or novels.\u201d  Her \nstudents, especially the boys, do not like their assignments in Finnish \nlanguage.  She also thinks the respect for teachers has declined in this \npast generation.  Miikka (FL) also thinks his students do not respect their \nteachers: \u201cThey don\u2019t respect the teachers.  They respect them very little \n\u2026  I think it has changed a lot in recent years.  In Helsinki, it was \nactually earlier.  When I came here six years ago, I thought this  was \nheaven.   I thought it was incredible, how the children were  like that \nafter Helsinki, but now I think it is the same.\nLinda (AL) notes deficiency in the amount of time available for subjects.  \nWith more time, she would implement more creative activities, such as \nspeech and drama, into her lessons.  Saij a (BL) also thinks that her \nstudents need more arts subjects like drama and art.  She worries that they \nconsider mathematics as the only important subject.  Shefeels countries \nsuch as Sweden, Norway, and England have better arts programs than in \nFinnish schools.  Arts subjects, according to Saij a, help the students get \nto know themselves.  Maarit (DMS), a Finnish-speaker, thinks that schools \nneed to spend more time cultivating social skills.\ufeff",

Young boys(more than girls), and \nespecially pubertal boys, want to excel in something, they want to show \noff. Either being the funny guy, the best footballer, best skater, anything.\nIn doing so, they also shy away from a field which is taken, that is, has \nstrong competition. It's more cost effective to find an opportunity to \nshine other places. Much of this happens unconsciously, and can easily by \nunderstood from a evolutionary point of view. \nThe ones who end up exceling in, say math, are the ones who \"won\" the field \nfrom very early on, and thus have a motivation to keep their top spot.\nNow kids still remain in activities in which they are not the best, maybe \neven the poorest, say, in sports, but there is a big difference, and that \nis that these activities often have a social aspect. Testing in schools \nusually don't have this social aspect when it is competition focused.\n\nMany give up, because they find no gain when they can't be the best. They \ncan even find it humiliating to be mediocre, and with that attitude you \nwill never have any prospects of excelling in school.\n\nMuch of the degrees from I was 15 to 18 years old I had to take up later on.\nI didn't really understand simple math until I was 21.\nI realized then that I wasn't at all dumb in simple math and analytical \nmath(the latter which is what really counts in higher education), as I had \nalways thought.\nI started to find it very interesting as well, and now I'm studying physics \nat the university.\n\nI believe what happens is a, mostly unconscious, evolutionary thing, in \nwhich we step aside when we sense that we can't win. Because one does not \nwant to show oneself as a beta male, in any frame. This is especially the \ncase in pubertal boys.\nIt's a short term risk-reward strategy, which probably had an important \nfunction in archaic humans. But it serves little to no function in modern \nsociety, were schooling is part of a long term strategy.\n\nThus promoting competition in schooling will make this short term \nrisk-reward strategy more relevant and prevalent.\ufeff",

Sure I'm myself a part of it, and you can argue that I'm \nunbelievably lazy and also say the \"Naah, I'll do it later\" but that's a \npart of it, everyone says it (at some point).

If I were to compare the other \"lazier\" \nstudents to me (Oh and as I said I'm also lazy as hell, don't take me wrong \nhere), the difference would be that I actually care (sometimes... o.o) and \nam willing to learn more. It's just not the educational system that can \nblow up, the people are also a part of the reason why it's doing well or \nbad.\n\nI suppose people just aren't that self-imposed anymore (Well I can't really \nknow if we ever were).

It's funny that I don't really remember any of this 'encouraging \nstudents to do what they want'. What I remember is constant pressuring to \nchoose what you want to do when you grow up, constant monitoring of what \nthe students did on recess, not allowed to throw snoballs, not allowed to \nthis and that, not allowed to leave school premises to go to the shop, not \neven in middle school(nobody gave a shit about what they told and went \nanyway). A lot of students smoked tobacco not even hiding it, but doing it \nin plain view while taunting the teachers, respected my ass.\n\nTo top this off, this years PISA-study shows the ranking dropped \ndramatically, no surprise there. Any responsible parent reading this, \nplease don't put your kid into a government indoctrination center where the \nteachers are the biggest bullies, homeschool or unschool them instead.\ufeff",

            "text": "I agree we should adopt the Finland model.\n\nThe resistance comes in the form of those who don't want the US to be \nhomogenous.  They don't want to help the poor, they don't want to help \nother races.  In fact, they either want those people to be kicked out of \nthe country, ignored or just treated as second class citizens.  This is a \nhuge problem in the USA.\n\nThere are also the issues of money and religion.  These are probably even \nbigger obstacles- although they are related to the first problem.  But the \nissue of a heterogeneous society is sort of going away slowly.  I mean, \npeople don't hate as much as they used to.  But the separation because of \nreligion and for financial gain will continue and exists within \negalitarian- minded people.\n\nMoney is the biggest problem.  People love capitalism and look for it to \nsolve all problems.  It is really the american religion, or it is the \nmodern religion- and the US is the leader symbolically and actually in \nterms of dollars and financial leaders on wall street and ceos of the \nlargest companies and the most rich people if not the richest people. \n There are a few people richer than \"Americans\", but there are more rich \npeople in the US than elsewhere overall.  Also, the US was traditionally \nwhere people went to get rich, and probably, even though social mobility \nhas become very poor in the US, people still come here to get really rich, \nand it's easier to succeed because of the rules in place that favor certain \nkinds of business enterprises and the people who have that kind of \nexpertise.\n\nSo it's no surprise that people are at least open to considering a \ncapitalist approach to education.  The average person has probably not \ngiven up on public education, but there has been a sustained push to \ndiscredit public education and the teacher's unions. But the real problem \nis that there is a huge incentive to privatize education, because that \ncould mean huge profits, subsidized by Uncle Sam.  It's not really the \npeople who are leading this- they are being led by those who want to \ndestroy the public contract and those who want to make big bucks off of \nprivatization.  So, other systems, like the Finland system, are unlikely to \nbe adopted until people realize privatization isn't very good for our kids. \n And of course, not everyone even thinks of US children as \"our\" kids. \n They prefer to think of most of American kids as unworthy to be \"American\".\n\nReligion is a big problem mainly because the right wing and the rich have \neffectively worked their messages into the mainstream so that they can use \nreligious leaders to spread their ideology through religion.  They have \nbeen working hard on this since the 60's and have mostly succeeded. Which \nis why poor and middle class consistently vote against their own interests \nin the US, and in favor of policies that help the rich get richer and help \nthe rich to take from the poor.  And it's why people are moving towards \nprivatization in education- and I include charter schools in that equation. \n It's part of the spectrum from public to private.\n\nSo it's going to be difficult for something like the Finland model of \neducation to take hold in the US.  I do have hope for this happening in the \nlong run, however.  In the short run, the only way this could happen is for \nsome kind of movement or inspirational leader or leaders to raise the issue \nand change the minds of the people and the decision makers in the US.  I \ndon't see that happening yet.\ufeff",
