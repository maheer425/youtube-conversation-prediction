I \nremember you were always complaining,like all Pommies at the time,that you \nweren't winning because you,\"didn't have a Factory Bike\". Well,somehow,you \nwere given a Factory Bike for the G.P.'s and did nothing on it.I also \nremember reading your column that year,1997,and you were saying the \nbike,a Factory Suzuki rgv250,was just way too slow compared to the \nother Factory Bikes.Well,at the final round,your team mate couldn't ride,so \na local rider was procured by the team.Barry Sheene suggested a local \nsuperbike rider,Troy Bayliss.This guy had not ridden a racebike for several \nmonths,and had NEVER ridden a 250 GP bike.But without any testing on it, he \nalmost put it on pole,led the race several times,and just missed a podium \nfinish.He ran with top five guys throughout the whole race,leading onto the \nstraight many times,only to be blown past on the straight,but then riding \naround the outside of them of the fast corners,much to the surprise of the \nWorld Championships top four riders'.I remember you crashed in that \nrace,again,while running mid-pack.I remember Troy being interviewed after \nthe race and saying happily,\"It's a great little bike!\" The lesson here is \nnever blame the machinery for your lack of ability.That performance by Troy \nBayliss at Phillip Island would have been very embarrassing for you. \ufeff",

            "text": "Well from some of the videos I've seen, like Twist of the Wrist 2 by Kieth \nCode (you can find the video on youtube) they seem to suggest being on the \ngas (lightly) on corner entry almost before you even start to lean to keep \nthe suspension loaded so you don't have that light sort of floating \nsensation from the suspension.\n\nNow if you watch the onboard cameras from actual racing such as the motogp \nriders showing both acceleration percentage as well as braking percentage \nin little bar graphs you'll find that the racers are hard on the brakes all \nthe way into the corner almost to apex and then release brakes and coast \nfor a very short while and then roll on the gas as they get to or are \npassing through corner apex.\n\nIt would seem to me that the motogp riders know what they're doing, but if \nyou notice, the timing of when they're off both the brake and throttle \n(coasting) seems to correlate with just before apex or so.\n\nLooking at how they actually are going into the corners, hard under \nbraking, they are both sliding the bike into and out of the corners.  \nLooking at the profile the bike traverses through the corner, I think it \nwould not necessarily be a round arc like that of a circle, but more of a \nparabolic or hyperbolic shape like a parabola with the tip or point of the \nparabola corresponding with the apex of the corner.\n\nSimilar to auto racing, they are sliding the rear of the bike into the \ncorner so that they can swing the nose around to point towards the corner \nexit before they apply the gas. ( helping to turn the bike faster than if \nthe tires were not sliding)\n\nIf you think about it, the point at which they're both off the brakes and \nbefore they apply throttle is the point in the corner at which their speed \nis lowest (this could correspond with the tip of the parabola or \nhyperbola).  This would make sense as if the bike were to be slightly \nunstable, having it unstable (or unloaded) at the slowest point in the \ncorner sounds the safest/fastest.\n\nIf you were to slide the bike to point the nose towards the exit, the ideal \ntime would be at this point of lowest speed.  So infact it would appear \nthat as you are on the brakes up until the sharpest point, then at the \nlowest speed and sharpest point of the curve you give it a little more \nbrake than before to allow the rear of the bike to slide the most to \"come \naround\" the tip of the parabola and point the nose towards the exit.\n\nThis would correspond with the ideal timing to release the brakes and be \noff the gas as it would be a momentary excess input of the brakes to get \nthe rear end to come around the most.  During this time you would ideally \nbe off the brakes and gas and as the rear end begins to slow from this \nslide, you would start to roll on the gas.\n\nPerforming this action at this point in time would load the rear of the \nbike, transferring traction to the rear and allowing the rear tire more \ngrip.  Then after the tire has \"hooked up\" or gained traction you begin to \nroll on the gas more as at this point you are both pointed towards the \ncorner exit as well as have regained traction and control via the throttle.\n\nAll of this however depends on the geometry of the corner itself, and what \ncomes after the particular corner.  For instance a very sharp corner with a \nshort straight afterward could see a very exaggerated or \"sharp\" looking \nparabola/hyperbola.\n\nA long sweeper with a long straight afterward would see a much wider or \n\"smoother\" version of this.\n\nAnd there are probably an infinite number of variations in-between.",

            "text": "I'm not an expert but it just comes down to judging the speed of the \ncorner, if you go out to the track try braking later. To begin with work \nout what speed you are comfortable with taking on the corner as you go \naround the track try braking a little later each time.\n\nYou may get to the point where the bike's front wheel locks up, if this is \nhappening you perhaps should do a few more laps and allow the tires to warm \nup, or drop the pressure by a few psi. It does also come down to what tires \nyou are using, if you are using a touring tire you should be mindful that \nit won't gain much extra grip as it isn't designed for grip but more \nlongevity.\n\nYou also need to be mindful how much brake pressure you apply at the \ncurrent lean angle as the front is already loaded with cornering forces, \nbraking too hard may cause you to lose the front.\n\nIt may not only be braking, but getting back on the gas earlier can help \ntoo. Basically get back on the gas as soon as possible when you've reached \na point where you feel it is safe for you to do so, don't overstep your \nconfidence with this by throttling too hard as you may lose your rear. \n\nI haven't really explained it too well, I've got a few videos showing my \nbraking into corners and accelerating out of them. I can however suggest \nwhat everyone suggests and that is watching Twist of the Wrist 2, it makes \nclear the fundamentals on how to ride and what you should and shouldn't do.",
