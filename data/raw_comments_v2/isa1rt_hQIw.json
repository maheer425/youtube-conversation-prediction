Belly dancing \nis appealing, but it's not slutty. My best friend is a belly dancer. She's \nnot a slut. \n\nAlso, prostitutes don't even dance on poles. They walk around smoking and \nshowing off their bodies so they can get paid for sex by a random stranger. \n\nI'm not meaning to argue with you, I'm just trying to get you to see that \npole dancing isn't for slutty things...
