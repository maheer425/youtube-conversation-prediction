It is actually informative.  Ahhh.. TV.  Tirelessly stripping \naway any intellectual value of its content.  **sigh**\n\nI find the omission (by everyone) of the whaling tasks, which take a major \npart of the story, surprising.  It struck me as just as important, and \nrelevant to Ahab's tale.  It seemed to make an argument about the toil of \nman, it's bloody and cruel work, and the joy of exploitation.  But rather \nthan a condemnation of that state, it's a compassionate, albeit sad, \nunderstanding.  His depiction of the crew as being at the mercy of the \nCaptain, as well as the economy of the time - risking their very lives for \na meager living and bathed in gore when successful - shows a measure of \nsympathy. \n\nPerhaps Melville is also depicting a parallel sympathy for the whales, \nembodied by Moby himself.  Moby too is a slave to whaling but represents a \nviolent rebellion against it.  To be fair to Ahab, he also rebels against \nwhaling, foregoing normal whale hunting at the risk of mutiny.  He has \nchosen to live outside of its system to pursue a single maniacal \nobsession.  He has literally been scarred by the violence of the career and \nhas devolved into having the violence of whaling as his sole focus.  The \nloss of his leg has been the biggest event in his life and since it was \nborn from violence, he can only see violence as the retributive solution to \nhis state of life.  Except for Ishmael, whaling is the entirety of life for \nall the characters, all of whom are victims of its violence and \nexploitation.\n\nI might be reading into it a bit more than what is there, or am off in my \ninterpretation, but the whaling does occupy a huge part of the book and \nseems to be an important component of Melville's message.  I was quite \nsurprised by it's voluminous inclusion actually, and pleasantly so.  (For \nthe record I'm a vegan, so no 'You're pro-whaling!?!' baiting.  **grin**)\n\nTo be fair to Thug Notes - you only have 4.5 minutes to cover a \nsymbolically rich story, so some aspects (perhaps more nebulous in their \ninterpretation) need to be omitted. \ufeff",

This would indicate \nknowledge surpassing your own power of observation. It seems more of a \npresupposition\n\n\"I would say that is dishonest\"\n\nWhat I meant was that it is rather dishonest that you would tell Petr Vacek \nthat the transcendental isn't in the realm of proof, but rather, as I \nunderstood it, knowledge about it is purely theoretical. Yet the tradition \nof metaphysical thought you are employing has it's roots in european \nmetaphysical thinking, which itself has it's basis in Christianity, which \nis a tradition based on revelation and inter-subjective, divine proofs. The \nform of thinking you are employing is therefore not something a prior or \nasocial, in the sense that it is represents some sort of universal, default \nhuman mode of thinking. It is historical and socially conditioned and \npassed down. Again, a historical evolution of something is not an argument \nagainst it, but it does show that it is manifestly bogus for you to claim \nthat the knowledge about transcendental, as it has been understood in \nChristian thinking, is purely theoretical or a prior, since it is \nunderlined by host of claimed proofs, experiences, social education and \nculture, which then guides further thinking and assumptions. It is \ntherefore more contingent and posteriori.  \n\nAnd in this sense I claimed that you were being dishonest, since your a \nprior, purely theoretical thinking is ultimately based on a religion, that \nis anything but purely a prior or theoretical. You are denying the \nhistorical contingency and cultivation of your thinking, which questions \nit's a prior status and it's supposed a prior truths. And if you extended \nyour claim about the (dis)connection between proof and the transcendental \nto Christianity, you should deny that the reports and revelations of the \nbible can be used as proof of Christianity.\n\nI would also ask you that if you move your transcendentalist thinking from \nthe realm of proof, then on what can you really base it's ontological \nvalidity on? There are a huge number of competing metaphysical, \ntranscendental traditions of thinking in human history and modern world. \nWhat makes your own ontologically exempt, if not only it's historical basis \nin Christianity?\n\n\n\"For example, Descarte's \"I think therefor I am\" has no basis from \nempirical observation; it can be grasped entirely independent of observable \nexperience and I would consider it a tautology, even though such thought \nstill transcends the thinker in many ways; that's not theoretical.\n\nie. I don't theorize I exist, I exist and as a result I can theorize.\"\n\nI would say there are few problems with this famous claim:\n\n1) \"I\" is taken here for granted, based on experience of the self. But \nwhether it truly is \"I\" that thinks is no clear. The \"I\" might be an after \neffect only, as we have some reason to suspect based on our understanding \nof consciousness and sub-consciousness.\n\n2) Is it really so that \"I think, therefore I am\" is so independent from \nobservable experience? Think about your daily experience. Do you think \"I \nthink, therefore I am\" constantly? I would think not. The majority of our \nday to day experience is, I would claim, really spent in a kind of \nautomatic state, in which we act and even think purely without any \"I\" and \nwithout any constant self-consciousness of the \"I\". Yet in the seriality of \nour thoughts, at some points the idea \"I am\" or \"I think\" emerges only \nbriefly. We the observe this experience in our inner state and take it to \nbe the whole of conscious experience. But we don't go on in our daily lives \nconstantly thinking \"I am now writing on my laptop, I am now walking down \nthe street, I am now thinking of me thinking\" etc. In this sense, the \nquestion rises just how much \"I think, therefore I am\" is an a prior truth \nand condition.\n\n3)While you do make valid points and I would grant that some form of \nnon-theoretical basis is required for thinking, none of this infers a \ntranscendental  God, it doesn't answer how you connect your transcendental \nthought to the concrete world of inter-subjective human thinking and it \ndoesn't answer how you can claim that your transcendental thinking is not \nsubject to proof, since it is ultimately based on tradition of proof.

A socio-historical analysis of the origins \nand functions of certain ways of thinking of course doesn't disprove the \nontological validity of such ways of thinking. But it does advise one to be \ncareful of the seductive logic of such views and and apply comparative \ncriticism to them, questioning the whole of their metaphysical basis. There \nis no reason (concrete societal conditions being excluded) that such a \nprocess of metaphysical rationalization could not have been or still be \ndirected toward any other religious entity in history (Zeus, for an \nexample) with perhaps very much the same results.\n\n\"Because you haven't crossed any boundaries between such fixed \npresuppositions.

The applicability of my relative estimate is only a \nproblem for you, since to you God is real \"pure being\", while to me he is \nnot. The logic of applicability is different for both of us. To me, \nChristian God is \"eternal\" only in the sense that human beings have made \nhim appear so through cunning use of abstracted reasoning. You claim that \nthe finite views of finite beings do not compare to a infinite being, but \nwhat this actually means is uncertain and whether it is true, no-one can \nsay and once again I find it very peculiar that Christians claim that God \nis knowable and unknowable at the same time, so is there really any kind of \nreasonable frame of reference for understanding anything about a said \nbeing, including our limitations in regards to a such a hypothetical being? \nAnd even if such a being existed in reality, I do not believe that either \nof us could come to any definite conclusions about the applicability of our \nfinite views in regards to such a being. I suppose that, supposing God \nexisted, my relative views would have little bearing on the views of \neternal God. But even this is problematic, because the God's \"eternity\" is \nonce again filtered through our finite apparatus of understanding, so we \nreally don't know what it means that our views are incomparable. Likewise \nwe do not know what are the conditions of God's knowledge of good and evil \nand what it means that God's eternal nature somehow gives them greater \nuniversal applicability (we simply suppose it does). You can of course \nretort that God's eternal nature makes his views ontologically \nself-evident, but I would claim that once again the problem lies in the \nfact that even this \"certainty\" is based on the suppositions of finite \nhuman reason. This is a problem for you, since you claim the incapability \nof human reason in understanding God, yet claim that we can, using the said \nreason, deduce his nature as \"pure being\" as a certainty.\n\nAs for the burden of proof, I would claim that since you are making a gross \nmetaphysical claim here, which covers all the levels of ontology, knowledge \nand morality, the burden of proof is really on you.

            "text": "+MRKetter81 \"Your analysis lacks understanding of the theological concept \nof God in the christian eyes... \"\n\nI'm sure I would, since this \"understanding\" is a product of 2000 years of \nsocio-historical furnishing and \"logicalization\" by a group of \"experts\", \nwho took it upon themselves to be the theoretical guardians and definers of \nChristian faith and philosophy (St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas being \nperhaps the most well known, though certainly not the only ones), refining \nit through the ages to respond to any theoretical opposition or challenges. \nIn time, such systems of thought are refined to the point of being logical \nto a no fault. But they are only logical in the sense that internally, as \nsystems of symbols, semantics, concepts and ideas, they are coherent within \ntheir own logic (while no-one actually has any proof that they are true in \nthe real world outside their own theoretical consistency) Thus anyone who \ndoes not recognize this internal logic \"lacks\" understanding.  \n\n\n\"God doesn't \"need\" to be loved, human beings require such a thing. God is \npure \"being\" (lacking in nothing). God created all things of His own free \naccord. God doesn't need to love human beings, human beings rather need to \nlove God; the requisite is on our end.\"\n\nSo if God doesn't need anything (lacking in nothing), why does he do \nanything? Action implies need, a requirement to achieve something to some \nend. This is one of the illogicalities of Christian God (or any \"perfect \nbeing theorized and imagined by human beings). The logic of why such a \nbeing would do anything, other than dwell in it's own perfection, confounds \nme. Obviously such beings need to do something (are in need), since they \ncreate anything in the first place and take interest in the activities of \nfinite creatures by stipulating a set of moral or ritualistic procedures \nand laws.\n\nWhat is \"pure being\" ? And, once again, if this \"pure being\" \"lacks in \nnothing\", then why does it do anything at all? Why does it create \"unpure \nbeing\" which needs something (how can something, that needs nothing, create \nsomething that requires something?)? How exactly is it separate from that \nbeing that is not \"pure\"? But of course, it is just another one of those \nempty abstractions invented by Christian philosophers to give their God an \nair of philosophical grandiosity (it is one of those things, that has been \nmade \"irrefutable\" in regards to itself), while no-one really actually \nknows what this concept means, not even it's inventors. It is really a word \ngame only. \n\n\"Now as to why evil exists,(or rather doesn't, as it is the ontological \nopposite of existence)\"\n\nI really don't understand what this means? How is evil \"the ontological \nopposite of existence\"? What does this even mean? Isn't this oxymoronic, \nsince according to Christina faith, evil (and sin) exist in the world and \nthat there is true evil? How can you then logically claim that it is \"the \nopposite of existence\"? Doesn't this mean that it doesn't exist? And if \nevil and sin do not exist then neither does good? Or any need to surpass \nevil? No sin, no evil, thus no good or redemption either.\n\n\" However attributing every evil act to God on the account you somehow know \nbetter than He is an under-sited proclamation. The book of Job openly \ndisplays the folly of such an error, \n\n\u201cWho is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?\"...\n\n\u201cShall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?\n    He who argues with God, let him answer it.\u201d...\n\n\u201cDress for action like a man;\n    I will question you, and you make it known to me.\nWill you even put me in the wrong?\n    Will you condemn me that you may be in the right?\n\nGod doesn't openly give an answer to Job and neither is that a requirement \non God's part. Job is finite and God doesn't have such limitations when it \ncomes to comprehending things. The Thug gives the same analysis of Paul \nAtreides in the novel Dune- Muad'dib realizes how infinite the universe is \nand how small his comprehension is of it's entirety; even the god-emperor \nin the following novel comes to the same conclusion. Yet another problem \narises when you dictate good and evil to God; on what accord do you make \nmeasurement? If you are in fact atheist good and evil are subjective to a \nsecular consensus and have no real eternal binding clause; your \naccusations, in such a case, are stipulated. \"\n\nAs far as I can see, you are saying that my basis for criticising the idea \nof God is null, because you claim that we he is beyond our comprehension \nand thus all my thinking lacks substance. Now, of course I do not take any \nof this as literally as you probably do. To me, the whole of Christian \nreligion and morality is little more than human morality and concepts made \n\"divine\" in order to legitimate them (and of course, the origins of \nChristianity lie in a culture and peoples who could not understand in any \nother way than metaphysically and in superstitious fashion), which then go \nthrough a historical process of \"rationalization\" theoretical refinement \nand crystallization as to appear \"divine\", \"absolute\", \"timeless\" and \n\"unhuman\". What we are doing here is really little more than a culturally \nconditioned play with words and concepts, but let's play it then.\n\nMy response is conditioned of the claims of Christians I converse with and \nthe internal logic of their claims. We are all of us ultimately dependent \nof inter-subjective communication and so is Christianity in communicating \nit's concepts. The idea of Christian God is that he loves us and wishes us \nonly good. This is supposed to be his \"unconditioned love\". Yet by his \nomniscient actions, he chooses to create a world in which the inevitable \ncourse of events (which he knows) will lead to great multitude of his \nchildren being driven to eternal suffering because they \"choose\" not to \nturn to God (at least this is the typical way it is explained). God's \ngoodness is claimed by the Christians because he offers us a way out of our \nsinful ways, which we have \"chosen\". Yet he himself is fully responsible \nfor the existence of this predicament in the first place, even though he \ncould have created a number of other arrangements of existence, which would \nnot include sin and evil. He could have created the eternal paradise, into \nwhich this world is supposed to be a logical progression towards, in the \nfirst place and bypass any needles detours of existence, which will only \ncause suffering to the beings he claims to love. His act of love is \nself-defeating, because it is conditioned on a release from suffering and \nsin he himself is ultimately responsible for, as the absolute creator of \neverything. If you claim that here are things in existence, for which God \nis not responsible for, you are denying his absoluteness. To make such a \nclaim would mean that God did not create certain things in existence, which \nwould question his status as \"alpha and omega\", the absolute and creator of \neverything.\n\nAlso, it was claimed by Elijah Olson that God gave us free will because he \nwants us to choose him in this life. He wants us to love him on our own \naccord. Now, once again this doesn't really make any sense, because it \npresupposes need for something in a being that is supposed to be perfect. \nYet it acts as a legitimization for many Christians for why God chose to \ncreate things as he did. But there is no reason really for God not creating \nheaven originally as it is and is supposed to be once we (or at least some \nof us) get there. God could have created the perfect, sinless conditions \nfrom the start and conditions where we would exist in perfect harmony with \nhim form the first place, by our very own created natures. There is no \nreason he could not have done this, since, as you claim, he doesn't need \nanything (lack in nothing). The conditions of suffering God created by his \nfirst act of creation (details of which he knew completely from first to \nlast, being omniscient) are thus rendered redundant, since he could have \ncreated a world without said conditions. To claim otherwise would be to \nclaim that God could not have done so, which would deny his omnipotence.\n\nThe idea of free will doesn't really absolve God of any responsibility \neither, because he knew exactly how we would choose to use such a freedom. \nHis omniscience means that he is responsible for our actions, since he \nchose to create a world, which would (as he knew it) lead to such actions.\n\nAnother problem also is that by trying to nullify my arguments by moving \nGod away from the reach of human comprehension (and thus criticism), you \nare nullifying your own standpoint as well. Christians make the claim that \nGod is good, based on the notion that God will is communicable to mere \nmortals. This very claim acts as the basis for the argument that God is not \nevil or at least that he actually represents \"good-in-and-of-itself\" (this \nclaim is essential to the Christian moral worldview). Yet this claim is \nmade wholly from the \"imperfect\" standpoint of human reason and \nunderstanding, which you just claimed is incapable of dictating \"good and \nevil\" to God. Christians often refer to God's \"mysterious ways\" in order to \nexplain away any occasion that he acts in some \"unexpected ways\". Yet they \nhave no problem to claim next that God is good, even though his \n\"incomprehensibility\" has just been established. The logic here is utterly \narbitrary and without any human reference.  If you claim that God is good, \nyou are basing this on the idea that God can be know and thus we can talk \nabout him in intelligible fashion. But as soon as you move him away even \nslightly from the realm of intelligibility and comprehension, any common \nground for making any claims about his goodness of lack of goodness \ndisappears. By claiming that he is beyond the criticism of human \nunderstanding, he also moves  away from the realm of positive affirmation.\n\nThe funny thing also is that although you made the case for Gods \nincomprehensibility in regards to human understanding, you still made a \nnumber of claims regarding his nature (\"pure being\", his relation to \nmortals such as Job etc.). If his nature is supposed to be beyond the \nunderstanding and judgement of finite beings, then how is it that you can \ndeduce anything about him? How can he be beyond and in the realm of our \nfinite understanding at the same time, when ever it suits your needs? The \nstrange, paradoxical and hypocritical thing to me is that Christians (or \nanyone using some \"incomprehensible\" absolute as a basis for anything \nreally) seem to deduce constantly wholly finite mortal things and concepts \nfrom this being, whose \"infinity\" is then claimed, once again, from a \nfinite perspective.\n\nI would also add that God's incomprehensible nature really isn't a problem \nfor me. After all, there is nothing \"incomprehensible\" about him, since to \nme he is just a product of human imagination and abstractions. Any attempt \nto move him away from the realm of human understanding are really nothing \nmore but philosophical tricks and sleights of hand, invented conditionally, \nhistorically and retroactively to theoretically strengthen Christianity as \na though system, legitimization system and worldview in human social \nrelations (just as any human institution becomes self-propagating if \nallowed to prosper). However, it becomes a problem for you, since to you, \nIf I am not mistaken, he is real and everything said here pertains to a \nreal being. Thus your claims of incomprehensibility question your \nunderstanding of him and your ability to make claims about him, not mine.   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n ",

The ship has 30 men and was written when \nthe nation had 30 states, the great white whale maims our hero and he \nlaunches on a quest fueled with rage and fury despite knowing deep inside \nthat he is doomed--as did most of his crew. I mean I could go on and on, it \ngoes much deeper and is almost prescient and has to do with his own \nobservations about New England, the new economic arrangements forming at \nthat time, and his take on our history but quite simply it was a passionate \npicture of American life and the dangers befalling our civilization.",
