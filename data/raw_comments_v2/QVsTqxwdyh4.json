Next you ask if \nshe has read any book, played any video game, or watched nay movie that you \nlike.

Those teenagers from \nback them are now \"wising up\" their children to move slower in their \nrelationships so that todays teenagers are a lot less promiscuous.\n\nBecause of that, women that are over high school age are now paying a lot \nmore attention to what the guy can offer them \"down the road\". If you do \nsome research into it you'll find that people are starting to marry less \noften, marry later in life, and stay single for longer periods of time \nbetween one relationship and another.\n\nI've seen a number of people get into relationships that lasted less than \n10 years simply because they got together too young, or they lasted less \nthan 20 years because now that a few children have been born (I have never \nhad any children or even gotten a woman pregnant at all) the parents lost \ntheir chances to \"do with their life what they wanted to do\" because the \nchildren came along to early.\n\nAnyway, just look through your old yearbooks, or stand at the window of an \nunoccupied classroom at the end of the day to see where she's going, or pay \nattention to whom she hangs around with, or go to some of the events that \nyou know she's going to, etc. etc. etc.\n\nYou don't have to make contact with her just yet if you don't think you \nhave a chance, but keep tabs on her as much as you can (without looking \nlike creepy stalky guy) until you can make an advance towards her that she \nwould be willing to understand is real.
