The first, at least, has merit and I lean toward that point of \nview (maybe my bias is that I am an Asian history guy).\n\nAnyway, I do not find this particular debate (what events or years should \nbe included in any given definition of a given 'war') very useful.  Really \nthose are already artificial definitions that help us to classify sets of \nevents into more understandable packages.  But as artificial constructs, \narguing about them does not make a lot of sense to me.  Good talk though.\n\nPS: Today I learned that I misspell 'artificial'.",

It \nwas seven years in Europe, from 1759-1763. The NINE year war happened in \nAmerica from 1754-1763. There was never a 23 year war except if you are the \nmost radical of historians. (The 23 year war may be talking about the \nAustrian Succession [1740-8]'s continuation.) Either way, many websites \nlist it as seven years. Plus, Europe calls it the Seven Years' War, mainly \nfor the fact that no one cared about the French and Indian War or the Third \nCarnatic War (Indian theater). ",

The purely \"Democratic\" Party dates to Andrew \nJackson and the election of 1828, in which he defined himself as separate \nfrom the \"National Republicans\" under JQA.  Jackson himself drew his \nparty's roots to Thomas Jefferson and 1800 election (as Democratic \nRepublicans, normally shortened to Republicans).  Neither of those dates \nare 1776.  The first true political party (aka the \"First party System\") \nwas the Federalists, opposed by Anti-Federalists, not Democrats.  \n\nAs far as Indian-killing goes, neither party is without blame, nor did it \nstart in 1776 either.  Look at the Pequot War, King Phillip's War, Bacon's \nRebellion, the Paxton Boys Massacre all pre-1776.  Post-1776, you have \nWashington, Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln all responsible for travesties \nagainst Natives.    \n\nAs far as policies go, Democrats were anti-bank--look up Jackson's bank \nwar, removal of deposits, and the end of the Second BUS--because it \nrepresented privilege and government regulation.  Guess that kills your \nargument there.  Lincoln was pro-bank and pro-protective tariff (aka tax).  \n\nIt was Democrats that sanctioned \"State's rights,\" and SOUTHERN Democrats \nwho pushed secession to protect slavery in the 1860s, as compared to the \n1960s where Democrats passed Civil Rights legislation and a Democrat \ndominated Supreme Court ended segregation.  How you can even try to say \nthat the party's are the same now as then is a special kind of stupid.  \n\nRegarding your most recent comment, there have been semi-successful 3rd \nparties in the US, but only short-term.  The Populists had a good run from \n1890 to 1896.  In Oklahoma, almost half of the legislature was Socialist \nParty in the early 1900s.\n\nThus, before you criticize someone for who avoids \"too much reading,\" might \nI suggest you open and book...and your mind...",
