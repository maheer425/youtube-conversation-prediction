Now, knowing this \nputs it into perspective. We are not talking about a sweeping cure like \nsmallpox, polio, malaria, or measles although it is noteworthy that the \ncures for these afflictions were not typically denied to people because \nthey were poor. In this case, since it is not a cure are we are talking \nabout Nexavar as being a product with an inherent distribution prejudice \nmuch like a Mercedes-Benz? That human life is factored into this debate \ndrags this into a personal introspection on what it means to each of us. As \nhuman beings we have the ability to decide morals. What clouds the issue is \nthat corporations, at least in the US, are regarded by the courts AS legal \nhuman beings and are able to make such legally valid decisions for the sake \nof profit. What seems to not be factored into the debate is that such \ndecisions like these when coming out of any actual human being would be \nconsidered sociopathic in nature....and the courts have ways of handling \nsociopaths which hasn't been leveraged so far as I can tell. Corporations \nare allowed to keep making these valid and justifiable yet prejudicial \n'business' decisions because that is really what they are...a \nbusiness...and yet they still claim human being status in courts. I would \nsuggest that if corporations want to claim their rights as a human being \nthey should have the right to also earn it. Is their decision to sell to \nonly rich people 'amoral'? Perhaps it should be dragged through a court and \nhandled appropriately since such a decision can be defined as sociopathic. \nIs it evil? Most conservatives in this country would support Bayer's point \nof view without seeing the hypocrisy of also laying claim to being the \npolitical party that God belongs to. Since one cannot serve God and also \nserve mammon, and since Bayer's decision is clearly for serving mammon, \nperhaps it fails that litmus test and is simply evil. An easier scenario \nwould be to consider whether Bayer's employees could afford this drug? \nClearly the representative making the smug claim here is able to. How \nwonderful for him.   \ufeff",

            "text": "I agree that animals are better for the planet. I don't agree that money \nmakes one group of people better than another. That's a digressive way of \nthinking. Manifest Destiny was a horribly assumptive concept pushed by \nreligion into politics in order to gain sympathizers for rich industry \nowners who were using people as though they were surfs. The idea that the \nrich are \"the preferred people of God\" was a disgusting concept which \nmodernism challanged. Concepts of being in born better than another is \nnarcissism. Not reality. In my experience it is the poor communities who \ncare about the Earth, the animals, OTHER PEOPLE, not the rich. What makes \nyou think, when the rich take over the world they will develop a sudden \ninterest for these things after they've spent generations trying to kill \nthose off who DO care about them? Seriously. This is horseshit. Glad you're \nbuying into it but it's not for me.",
