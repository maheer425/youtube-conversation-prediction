If we continue to grow our \ncomputational systems at this hyperbolic rate, it's very likely a \nsimulation we create will be capable of forming simple life inside of it's \nlogical constructs. If we also create a simulated universe that matches the \nphysics of our own, then there are 2 known universes - if another species \ncreates a simulated universe, we may not know about it, and it may be \nslightly or vastly different. That is to say, this could easily be a nested \nuniverse, and the number of known universes is unlikely to ever be \naccurate. This universe could be simulated for a purpose unknown to us, and \nif so, It's very possible we are anomalies that are not part of that \npurpose in a large way.\n\nThis video seems to question the purpose of Earth and smolder about \nreligion instead of presenting any actual possibilities for the purpose of \nthe universe.

God exists to \"glorify\" God, which is egotistical and \nbeing \"egotistic\"is wrong for humans to do because we are lesser than God. \n Being egotistical is not bad for God because he actually deserves every \nword of praise that could be given to him because of how amazing of a being \nhe is, technically, infinitely?  The only reason we exist is so that we can \nlove God, and yes, it's generous for God to give us the option, but it is \nalso self-serving because God is more \"glorified/bigger/more \npowerful/greater\" when he is loved by other beings, I think.  So, would God \nbe \"better\" for making robots to love him instead of humans?  Robots that \nlove God.  Yes, that would be ideal, but LOVE cannot be manufactured... \n Robots are not capable of love.  Only a being who is able to CHOOSE can \nchoose to love.  Giving someone freedom to love you means giving them the \nfreedom NOT to love you also.  So, I think God made us as souls with free \nwill.  And since I have the freedom to act how I want to (to do good or \nevil, to love or to hate), that means that God probably won't send my \nhammer flying out of my hand every time I try to hit my neighbor with it. \n If God did reliably send my hammer into midair every time I tried to hit \nmy neighbor, then the choice NOT to hit my neighbor but give him a hug \ninstead would be coerced/\"robot-liked\".  Then, the \"glory\" that God would \nget from that good choice to hug my neighbor would be LESSENED.  There can \nbe no love if there is no option to hate.  Also, since God is the highest, \nmost perfect judge, after I have mauled my neighbor to death with my \nhammer, then raped his children, he would be a MORE POWERFUL judge for \nbeing \"ABLE\" to say \"We're cool\", right?  No, he gives this guy a fine. \n And the fine is death.  \"For the wages of sin is death\".  But he \nsacrificially killed himself to pay the fine. I know it sounds really \nweird.  But you have to admit, the alternative that I could \"get away\" with \nmauling my neighbors and that all beauty is meaningless also sounds really \nweird.  Or that we have no soul and therefore are just a series of chain \nreactions, incapable of any choices and thus incapable of actually \"loving\" \nour spouses - that also sounds weird.  So, you can choose between this \nweird, or that weird.  Which has more evidence?",

            "text": "\"1. define macro evolution for me.\"\n\nThat's readily figured out by looking at wikipedia, macroevolution is \nevolution on a scale of separated gene pools.  The main issue that tends to \ncome up in the creation/evolution thing is that Creationists tend to enact \nstrategic elasticity as to how the phrase is defined depending on the \nexamples presented them.\n\n\"2. what was the first eye found in the fossil record?\"\n\nCase in point here, in order for me to meaningfully answer this you'll have \nto provide a solid, concise definition of what specifically will constitute \nan \"eye\" within this debate, is simply photosensitive cells viable as an \n\"eye\", or are you talking about one specific iteration of the concept, a \nspecific organ as differentiated from the other organs in the body?  In \nother words, at which point in the development of those simple \nphotosensitive cells into the modern eye would you be looking for examples \nof?  This is a perfect example of the aforementioned strategic elasticity \nof terms I mentioned, if I answer without you providing an exact point of \nreference from which to form my answer you could simply discount that \nanswer as \"not eye-like enough\" and discount the examples.\n\n\"3. give us the plans for dragonfly metamorphosis to occur.\"\n\nThis again is a vague question, are you asking what specific shifts were \nnecessary for the species of dragonfly to develop from it's precursor \nspecies?  Or rather which traits are used to differentiate a modern day \ndragonfly from the ancestors from which it came?  You ask for \"plans\" but \ndon't offer any framework from which to work in which I can do so in any \nconcise, objective manner...is physical traits what you want?  genetic code \ndistinctions?  It's like me saying \"give me the plans for water to \noccur\"...I could give the environment necessary for water to develop, \nsimply give objective physical qualities of water (it's a wet blue liquid \nconsisting of only two molecules necessary for life as we know it for \nexample), give you just a straight up chemical breakdown (it's two parts \nhydrogen and one part oxygen), give you the standards necessary for water \nto \"metamorph\" into a solid state or a gaseous state and so forth and all \nwould be correct.  The questions you're asking are too vague for anyone to \nbe able to respond to meaningfully...I've seen the approach used before \nfrom Creationists, specifically working questions in such a way as to \nensure any answer that COULD be given, no matter how specific, can be \ndiscounted as \"not specific\" or \"not clear\" enough when it's the original \nquestions themselves that are too vague to give a framework from which to \nform any answer.\n\n\"doesnt the info have to be preloaded?\"\n\nNo...and that's an example of a solid, clear question I can answer \nobjectively...first one thus far on the post.\n\n\"are you excluding simple light receptors because there is no evidence for \nthem in the fossil record?\"\n\nYou know that we HAVE species still around today with such systems, right?  \nWe can look at species still floating around and alive right now and see \nsuch proto-eyes.  And he's excluding them because he's unsure as to what \nspecific \"thing\" it is you're looking for in the answer because you've set \nup a question that can be discounted at any point in the developmental \nprocess due to it's inherent elasticity...give a specific definition of \nwhat it is you define as an \"eye\" as differentiated from those \nphoto-sensitive cells and we can answer more meaningfully, until then \nyou're questions are purposefully vague specifically so they CAN'T be \nanswered meaningfully.",

Sure im excluding those because \nthey don't have the required characteristics of an organism to fossilize, \nbut we don't need the fossils :D, we can make a phylogenetical tree, with \nthe current organisms who seem to be related to those and see if they fit \nclose to the base of the tree, and sure enough they do. In other words we \nhave living representations of their ancesters and we see that the \ncomplexity in their eye is the same to what is needed to fill the gap in \nthe fossil record.\nSure enough there should be millions (i wouldn't say trillions because what \ncounts is generations in a population not individuals) of fossils \nrepresenting every single one of them, but there aren't. Yeah, that's \nbecause the conditions needed for an organism to fossilize are really \nspecific and not every single organism that dies will become a fossil. You \njust need to think about all the things that happen to a dead corpse rain, \nerotion, other animals taking them appart. A skeleton needs to be buried \nunder very specific conditions so that mineralization can occur and then it \nhas to survive possible conditions which might destroy it like high \npressure and temperature.\nFor the last question yes, additive mutations exist, there are simple \nadditive mutations, caused at random, then there are whole segments of \ngenes being copied which then turn into other functional genes, this has \nhappened a lot in pigments, specially in plants, also there are thousands \nof fragments that were placed there by viruses and transposons. So yeah \nthere are many processes by which new DNA and by consequence new genes are \nadded to the whole genome of species. (Stop calling it information, it only \nshows your ignorance and the fact that the only thing you know about DNA is \nthat it encodes genetical information). Anything else? And finally i hope \nyou aren't trolling. :D\n\nPD: i forgot, evolution is a fact which is defined in a specific way \n\"change in the frecuencies of alleles in a population.\" This is observable \nand by definition a fact.  Also be aware that a fact is simply knowledge \nthat is true you will understand that regardless if we can't definitively \nreproduce something to prove it by it's nature it doesn't mean it's not a \nfact, just that we can't conclude that it is. and like i said, evolution by \nit's definition is a fact. what you are thinking of is that the \nevolutionary history isn't a fact. which i might agree that it isn't \naccuarate to call it one. but the evidence suggests strongly that it is, it \nhas made thousands of predictions biogeographical, ecological, anatomical \nand genetical ones.
