So he flew to this blanket that \ncovers his cage and sat there for about 10 minutes. My female Sunkist \ncouldn't find and she started looking all over her cage and calling for \nhim. She flew out but when she couldn't find anything to land on she'd just \ncrash. It made me feel so horrible because I can't control her or him and \nthey're not tame. We spent 2 hours trying to catch them and they're both \nfine but I was wondering why they'd just crash? \ufeff",

So if they \ncant find it they will usually land on the floor.. and if they are not use \nto the room or place they will tend to hit things. This is okay and its \nnormal. just make sure you release them in a smaller room that is some what \nbird safe. and if you just got them, please give them time to get use to \nthe area first. dont let them out nor try to grab them. allow them to get \nuse to you and the place without constantly having to watch out for \ndanger..
