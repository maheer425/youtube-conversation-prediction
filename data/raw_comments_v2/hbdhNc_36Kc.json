I\u2019m sorry, but \nyou have a rather juvenile understanding of automotive engineering, typical \nof a kid who is just starting to get into cars. I used to be like that too: \nI thought the Honda F20C was the best engine ever because it made such high \nhorsepower-per-liter. Then I realized that, despite having much lower HP/L, \nthe LS engines were putting out way higher power-to-weight than the F20C \ndue to the way they are able to pack a very large amount of displacement \ninto a very compact engine. Once you start understanding that, you begin to \nsee how HP/L doesn\u2019t actually mean much and how displacement alone doesn\u2019t \ndetermine the actual physical size of an engine.\n\nThe fact is that the LS7 puts out over 500hp and weighs around 500lbs \nFULLY-DRESSED (including all accessories). THAT\u2019s power-to-weight. It is \nalso literally physically smaller and lighter than even the 3.8L engine in \nthe GT-R. You cannot refute that. It is simply fact. The whole HP/L thing \nhas been widely discredited for quite a long time now (and not just by \nmuscle fanboys). The only thing about an engine that will make a car go \nfaster in the end is power and weight. \n\nYou can deny provable facts all you want, but in the end it just makes you \nlook like an ignorant kid.

Go to Japan and it's \nfull of Japanese cars you haven't even heard of, that are available in \nJapan only, the same way Ford or GM vehicles are available in the US and \nCanada only (with some additional markets like the Middle East and Mexico). \nEurope is only king when it comes to supercars and premium cars like \nMercedes or Audi, not mainstream brands.

Has \nbecome a cheap labour country.

And \nthe US Gov. has decided an imported car is a \"luxury\" so they can luxury \ntax them too. This is done to push foreign cars up market and out of \ncompetition with domestic cars. Who are also protected with lower taxes and \nsuch. But... When the European and Japanese cars are assembled in the US, \nthey are no longer counted as \"imports\", they avoid all those taxes, create \namerican jobs and everyone is happy.
