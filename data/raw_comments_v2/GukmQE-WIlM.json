Mike said at the end, \"Dude, what the fuck is going on?\", which \nsuggests to me that he only came in as James was drowning the bucket and \nthat James just imagined Mike being attacked by the bucket. I don't know; \nI'm just speculating. It's just that after being attacked, Mike seemed \npretty composed, which is not how I think most people would be in that \nsituation. They would still be trying to regain control of their breathing, \nand they would also still be confused. \n\n\n\nHowever, in the Dream Phone episode, I really think that Board James did \nkill his friends.
