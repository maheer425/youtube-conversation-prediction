Hell, even the formation \nof the Soviet Union wasn't Marxist, as a Marxist believes that a nation has \nto evolve through the feudal, then capitalist systems before it can reach a \nfull Utopian, communist, system. Russia never effectively had a capitalist \nsystem, so Lenin, the founder of Communist Russia, went against the \nCommunist Manifesto. \nSo your argument that Marxists distort history is irrelevant, yes maybe \nsome Marxist Historians distort history to get there view across, but EVERY \nhistorian does that. If you have ever studied history properly, then you \nknow historians just argue about everything and you get Marxist, \nanarchists, socialists, capitalists, liberals, fascists and pacifists all \narguing and distorting there point. \nBut, in terms of this video, the Marxists aren't distorting history at all. \nThey simply don't have the same view on history as John Green does. History \nis a seriously complex issue and one that can never be answered in a 'yes', \n'no' fashion. that is what +MrGamerGuy951 was getting at, as Marxists \nemphasize the fact that greedy men want more money, they believe that these \nare the factors that led men to the crusades. Obviously John Green feels \ndifferently, and thats okay; but you can't say that the marxists are wrong, \nbecause we have no idea what people back then where thinking.",
