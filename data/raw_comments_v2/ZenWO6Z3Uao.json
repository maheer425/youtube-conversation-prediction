But just looking at the facts we know, \nArtorias has his left arm broken at some point during his quest into the \nAbyss, so when we fight him in game he is using his right arm to wield his \ngreatsword, and his left no longer works, and the description of the same \nsword in DkS 2 states that every last one of the prominent swordsmen who \ninherited the weapon were left-handed, and when your character equips the \nweapon in his/her left hand, you gain moves used by Artorias, and no other \ncharacter in DkS.

More people than not tend to assume that it was Manus who did it, \nwhich would explain how Sif was able to place a summon sign in his boss \narena.  But even if we were to discount that likelihood, multiple item \ndescriptions related to humanity and dark magic describe them as having \ngreat physical texture and impact, which is why dark sorceries do so much \npoise/stability damage.  And Artorias, being inhuman and thus ignorant to \nthe nature of humanity, wouldn't automatically know not to try to block the \nHumanity Phantoms, or that the sorceries of Manus or the Bloatheads \ndwelling in the Chasm of the Abyss would hit incredibly hard.  All of which \nrenders it immensely more likely that his broken left arm was being used to \nwield his shield rather than his sword.\n\nAs for Sif and Artorias's shared attacks, saying that \"any dog with a sword \ncould spin\" rather fervently ignores the fact that dogs don't naturally \nknow how to use a sword in the first place.  All of Sif's combat prowess \ndisplayed in his boss fight was taught to him directly by Artorias, making \ntheir shared spin move still relevant.  All of which ignores the fact that \nyou are incorrect in claiming that they only share that one move.  They \nalso both swing their swords in wide arcs in the process of leaping a huge \ndistance backward with identical timing to boot, and there are tons of less \ndirect analogues between their strategies (slamming their swords straight \ndown on top of the player either in isolation or at the end of a combo, a \nsudden dash forward combined with a powerful sword strike, jumping long \ndistances away periodically so as to not let the player get too large of a \nwindow to deal damage to them and calmly pacing forward to conserve energy \nin the meantime, and so on).  It would truthfully be hugely more difficult \nto compose a list of the ways their fighting styles differ than it would to \nshow how alike they are.  Which means that Artorias was indeed fighting \nvery much the way he would under normal circumstances, a feat that would be \nunthinkable if he wasn't wielding his sword in the proper hand.",

            "text": "+Esteran Art and LP Solaire calls the sun a \"magnificent father,\" which is \nodd, but not that out of the ordinary at the beginning. He talks about his \nobsession with the sun, and he admits that it sounds a little crazy. The \ngame even goes out of its way to point out that the symbols on Solaire's \nclothing and shield are drawn there himself - it wants the player to know \nthat this is not something common for knights of Astora - it's very \n[i]specifically[/i] an obsession of this one guy. If you talk to Patches \nabout Solaire, Patches pretty much flat out says that Solaire is harmless \nbut crazy. Patches also makes pretty accurate assessments of both Lautrec \nand Petrus, so I think it's pretty fair to say that Solaire comes across \nthat way not just to the player, but to other people. The fact that Solaire \nis in agreement with this tells me that not even he fully understands why \nthe sun is so important to him. That, and there's the way he dies - a \nSunlight Maggot. Solaire essentially dies by \"giving up\" - he's at one his \nlowest points in his journey, both literally and figuratively, and it's \nhere that he sees something producing light similar to the sun. His final \ntransition to complacency is what ultimately drives him hollow. \n\nThis implies to me a couple things:\n\n1. Solaire knows of his lineage and circumstances only subconsciously, and \nit's his soul (actually that of a god) that was incarnated into a human \nbody (Perhaps intentionally on the part of his superiors). He \nsubconsciously sees the sun as a literal father and wants to be like it in \nthe same way the first born might have wanted to be like his father.\n\n2. Solaire's quest really is to be like the sun, not just heed the call of \nthe undead to ring the bells and what not. If he gives up after literally \nbecoming like a lame sun through the Sunlight Maggot, I think it might be \nthat he is being driven to do this by the influence of his soul - which \nmight be seeking redemption. In this sense it reminds me a lot of classical \nheroes who are unaware of their deific roots, like Ram in the \n[i]Ramayan[/i] or Hercules who also happens to be seeking redemption in his \nstory. \n\nSo now there's Gwyn's first-born. We know that no one knows his name, that \npeople still try to worship him (the broken statue of him at the Altar of \nSunlight that still has followers praying near it implies to me that this \nwas an intentional act of censorship by the gods, and not an organic \nprocess of people simply forgetting his name), and that he screwed up \nsomehow in a way that led to a major military defeat in the time following \nGwyn's self-sacrifice. Also that he cared \"only for power.\" We know that he \nleaves his ring on Gwyn's tomb as a \"final farewell,\" perhaps showing some \nkind of regret for ultimately being a disappointment and failing to become \nlike his father\n\nThen there are the minor points. Solare becomes a Warrior of Sunlight, \ncalls the sun a \"magnificent father,\" and has weapons and clothes that \ndon't have any particular power. Now remember that most bosses have weapons \nthat do something pretty special - Quelaag's a Daughter of Chaos and \nobviously can produce her own fire, but still wields a sword that generates \nflames. Nito uses the Gravelord's Sword which also has its own benefits. \nOrnstein's corpse gives Smough lightning powers so we know he has some of \nthat in him, but his spear also shoots lightning. Who's the only boss/god \nthat wields a weapon that overtly exhibits extraordinary powers in his boss \nfight, but does nothing when you get it? That's right, Gwyn. Now to be \nfair, Gwyn's given away all of his power to his children and himself to the \nfire when you fight him, and that might mean that his weapon doesn't have \nfire in it because it's the flame granting that to Gwyn temporarily. Yet, \nit seems like he would have infused lightning into his weapon like every \nother person seems to do with their special powers and equipment long \nbefore giving up his lightning. Note that the first born son used Sunlight \nBlade, which would be applied to a mundane weapon. Anyway, I think that \ngoing out of the way to point out that there is absolutely nothing special \nabout Solaire's equipment could imply that there's more to him than meets \nthe eye. It could, of course, also be interpreted literally - that he's \njust the hardest-working, most dedicated hero.\n\nSo basically, I think Gwyn's first-born son may have become a human after \nhaving his status as a deity forcefully taken from him, and he lost his \nmemory. The result is a human seeking to become \"like the sun\" because he's \nactually living out the redemptive desires of the person he was in his past \nlife.\n\n- He's the only NPC in the game that throws lightning bolts like Gwyn could.\n\n- Even though he was hurling lightning bolts, his talisman is simply a \nnormal one that he drew a sun on. :P \n\n- It's said that the former \"God of War\" still watches over his fellow \nwarriors (sunlight medal description): Solaire repeatedly shows up in your \ngame and can be summoned to fight alongside you for boss battles. \n\n- He seems to know entirely too much about how the distorted flow of time \nworks in Lordran for someone who just became undead and went looking for \nhis \"own sun\". \n\n- In his dialogue, it seems as though he somehow willingly \"chose\" to \nbecome Undead to go to Lordran. Everyone else seems to have been stuck with \nthe ill-fortune of being cursed somehow, but Solaire makes it sound as if \nhe willingly acquired it.\n\nall credit to the users of this thread \nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/608635-dark-souls/65324327",

In the same way I fought him to link the first flame, I \nfought him to put him out of his misery, to let him rest in peace after all \nthat had transpired. When after trading many blows, my Bastard Sword met \nhis neck diagonally and cut clean through his torso, I could have sworn I \nheard him whisper: \"Finally, it's over...\"; I sat for a moment, and admired \nthe first flame. The sparkle of life that fed every living being up until \nnow. So close, yet, so far. So mighty, yet, so fragile. Is this what is \nnecessary for the humans to keep living? When my flame dies out, who will \nbe next, and for how long? This place isn't what one would expect from the \nonce powerful Lord of Sunlight. No. His flame has died out, and mine will \none day, if I am to feed the flame with myself. No. I am not letting this \nhappen. I will make these stray children rise, even if they are to be \nraised in the dark. I stand up, and slowly turn away from the flame... I \nwalk out of the kiln, not knowing what to expect in the way out, but sure \nof what to do no matter what happens...\ufeff",
