Why the balls do you care about \nstupid arbitrary \"grammatical\" rules like splitting infinitives or ending \nsentences with prepositions?  Neither of those has anything to do with \nEnglish, they're prescriptive rules based on the thought that since you \n/can't/ split an infinitive in Latin (because infinitives in Latin are one \nword with a modified suffix), then you /shouldn't/ do it in English - \nprobably because of some nonsense about Latin being a \nbetter/purer/holier/smarter language than English.  Which is ridiculous, \nbecause no language is inherently better than any other.\n\nI feel like you do actually know better, since you just did it in this \nvideo; you just excused it because you \"felt that it was necessary.\"  So \nwhy should you ever avoid it?  The only possible reason would be if it \nsounds better when you don't, and that's the only reason.  If it ever feels \nnecessary, then do it: avoiding it almost always just sounds more awkward.\n\nNative speakers of English cannot speak their language incorrectly because \nthe language belongs to the people using it /as they use it/ in almost \nexactly the same way that books belong to their readers.  You can use the \nwrong vocabulary, you can make small mistakes, and you can certainly use \nthe wrong register (because using informal slang in a formal setting is \nstill wrong), but the fundamental grammar describing how English is spoken \ncannot and should not be prescribed.\n\nSincerely:\nA fan with an English degree\ufeff",

Anyone with a few million can set one up and pretend \nthey're doing something to help someone rather than just paying a friend to \nmismanage a bunch of money.\nIn recent years a lot more talk has happened about a lot of charity groups, \nand how some aren't really non-profits, but for-profit businesses that do \ntheir best to appear as charities.  Even some of what people would think to \nbe as great charities like the Red-Cross have been shown to spend gross \namounts of money in the name of \"getting people to donate.\"  Now I'm not a \nmoney manager, but if you're spending several million to get the same \npeople that donated several million last year to do so again rather than \njust having them keep doing it because they get tax benefits for doing it \nin the first place, I question what the real purpose of that money spent \nis.  There is also Salvation Army who have come under fire for practices \nthey conduct about their employment, specifically about people of different \nsexualities.  It's doubly sad because currently they are the charity that \ngives the absolute most, dollar per dollar, back into actual charities and \nnot into their own pockets.\nAnd while I would like to stop there I do have to bring up about internet \nactivists and the entire problem they pose.  Much like many of these big \n\"donate to feel good\" situations you're getting singular people trying to \nconvince you if you give them money they can solve a major problem in the \nworld.  One of these was the infamous Kony2012 drive, in which \nmisinformation told you nothing about how Kony was off in another region \nnow and not even confirm alive.  Rather he wanted you to buy all sorts of \nthings for him because it would \"help.\"  Not too long ago an \"internet \nactivist\" told everyone she was going to tell everyone why video games were \nevil and such.  Not only did she start out by promising what her findings \nwould be before the study even began, but she fell through on promises of \neven just increasing video quality and people began to point out all her \ngame captures came from various youtuber's videos, not through her \nconducting any research.  Unfortionally she has supporters that are more \ndevout to her than spanish inquisitors, so even if you somehow found out \nshe spent the money on everything but doing any research, they'd still \nfollow her unquestioningly and attack anyone that has even slight doubt in \nher strawman arguments.\n\nI think that's a large enough bloated comment from me...\ufeff",

Everybody on the streets has a sob story to tell but all of these \nsob stories are lies. I remember the first time I saw a begger, or at least \nthe first time I remember noticing one. He was a little boy around my age \nof the time and he knocked on our car window asking for money. He looked so \npathetic with ragged clothes and a limp my heart just went out for him.I \nstarted pleading with my parents to give him money (stupidly in English and \nhe realized we were foreigners so he became mpre insistent) My parents told \nme to look away and they asked me if one should give a poor man fish or \nteach a poor man how to fish. I was confused and they explained to me that \nyou cant just give money to the poor esp in India cause it doesnt really \nhelp anybody.\nWhen I got older they told me more atrocious stories although they still \nshaded me from seeing some of the truly grotesque affects of these stories. \nPeople will do anything for money they told me. My parents told true \nexamples of men who purposely crippled children because they can beg for \nmore money then a noncripple.They told me of a true example for people \nstealing babies and injuring them/killing them because hurt babies make \nmore revenue. I was 13 when I saw a woman carrying a baby. The baby's head \nwas bashed in and it was bleeding. I suppose it was dead. I only got a \nglimpse of the image before my mom pulled me into her. Its been a good \nthree years and I still cant get the image out of my head.\nAnyways the point is that in India there are the truly hopeless and lost \nbut there are also deceitful people who do anything for money. How are you \nsupposed to tell one from the other? You cant. You cant give money to \ncharities either because they dont tell the truth about what they really do \nwith it. India is built on corruption which is really really sad because \nthe culture and Hinduism is really deep and colorful and India could do so \nwell but the people are so bad....I love India, but I only love what India \nwas and I only love what it is in the books.\nOkay Im done for now...expect another rant from me when you post the next \nBTBF video...\ufeff",
