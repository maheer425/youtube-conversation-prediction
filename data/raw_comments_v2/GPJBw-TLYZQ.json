When building \nland for agriculture (making polders (search polder up on Google) \n\"salt-loving\" plants are used to suck up the salt water so cash crops can \nbe used in the area. (the salt loving plants take away the salt water) \nPLEASE make a video about the science behind these types of plants.\n\nHey, readers of this comment!\n\nPLEASE like this comment so they will see :)\ufeff",
