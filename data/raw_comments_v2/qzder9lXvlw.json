The box theme is one of the reasons why I liked them \nsoooo much. I love that you can focus on their awesome choreography in SM \nvideos, which is something that American videos lack. Maybe it's because \nI'm a dancer, but give me some amazing choreo and really cute fashion along \nwith a bomb ass song and I'M SOLD! ",
