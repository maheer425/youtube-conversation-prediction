But the Taiwan scenario \ncan be comparable to if the Confederacy won the American Civil War, and \ntook all of the 48 contiguous states plus Alaska, but the United States \ngovernment still having a hold on Hawaii (Despite Hawaii and Alaska not \nbeing part of the United States during the Civil War). Countries around the \nworld would react to it in different ways. Some would recognize the \nConfederate government and all of the 50 states, and some would recognize \nit as a feeble uprising and back the U.S.' claim over all of the 50 states. \nKeep in mind that alot of countries actually do not recognize the PRC in \nits entirety, and back the claim of the Republic of China's sovereignty \nover all of China. This sounds silly to me, because of a nation has proof \nit can assert independence, and even be part of the U.N.'s Security Council \nand the \"Big Five,\" then it is most certainly a nation. Same goes with the \nConfederacy if that scenario truly happened.",

The KMT may not see eye to eye to \nPRC, still consider themselves Chinese and thus named the government \nRepublic of China. I'll give you that there's a difference in time period \nwith the Confederacy, but the \"cause\" is similar - a region with a \ndifferent ideology tries to leave the union by having a different \ngovernment.\n\nAs for Hong Kong, it relies its economy, defense, essential utilities, etc \nall on mainland China. A couple of separatists rioting and the Western \nmedia exaggerating doesn't represent the majority of the population. Which \nis similar to the far right situation in Texas. Not to mention that the \nriots are the product of a plot by the British and American in an attempt \nto interrupt China's economic growth.",
