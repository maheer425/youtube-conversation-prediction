But the \nvideo doesn't explain (a) what PHYSICAL systems have such possibilities, or \n(b) WHY/HOW those physical systems can exist in such a superposition of \nstates.\n\n(a) is easy to answer: Thomson (along with Davisson) earned a Nobel prize \nin 1937 for developing a physical situation in which electrons were shown \nto possess a range of momenta (transmission through a thin slit in a metal \nfilm).\n\n(b) is harder to answer. How is it possible for those systems to have a \npossibility of two different momenta? I think the answer is: \"it just is \npossible. This is simply a fact we observe about the quantum world.\" Maybe \nthe Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics (with the pilot wave) can \ncontribute something new to this question?\ufeff",

If you want to find exactly where your cartoon character, you have to \nstop the animation/flipping the book, so you don't know where he's going to \nmove next.\n2.
