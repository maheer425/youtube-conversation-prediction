Let's say you're in a box, and you're \ntrying to figure out whether you are a) in orbit around a body; b) in \nfreefall towards a body; c) in freefall in a uniform gravitational field; \nor d) in a region of space with no gravity.\n\nYou can test the first hypothesis by spinning up a ball bearing really \nquickly: if it slowly turns, you can conclude by conservation of angular \nmomentum that you're in orbit. If it doesn't, *b*, *c*, or *d* must be the \ncase.\n\nTo test the second hypothesis, you can measure the tension between the \nfloor and the ceiling: this will tell you if the gravity on the floor is \nstronger than the gravity on the ceiling. If so, then you can conclude \nyou're in freefall towards a body, if not *c* or *d* are correct.\n\nHowever, these last two can't be separated *unless* gravitational and \ninertial mass are different: if they are, then more massive objects will \naccelerate at a different rate to less massive objects, however as near we \ncan tell this is not the case.",
