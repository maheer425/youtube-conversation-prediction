The \nyounger a sand is, the more likely it is to have non-silica grains, and the \nlarger, more angular its particles are. Most old sands are almost \ninevitably comprised of fine well rounded silica grains. However there are \nexceptions, such as the basalt sand beaches of Hawaii. There's little to no \nquartz out there.\ufeff",
