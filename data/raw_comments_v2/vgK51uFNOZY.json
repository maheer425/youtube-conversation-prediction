In my class i even heard a girl whispering to her \nself \"god those fingers are long and skinny\" and i knew she was talking \nabout mine. I hate being skinny sometimes and here are the reasons why:\n1-Sometimes my friend (he's a boy) tells me im skinny and i reply, \" you \nbetter think about that again because im not the only skinny one here MR!!\"\n\n2-When my big sis calls she tells me,\"did you eat already?\" and im \nlike,\"why?\" and she tells me,\"oh just asking\" i hate it when she asks me \nthat (she has her own family btw im an aunt)\n\n3-my uncle calls me \"flaca\"-->english-skinnygirl (i think)\n\n4-I hate being skinny because im afraid that ppl might see how skinny i am \nand thats why i where jackets or sweaters even when its hot outside or \ninside\n\nI sometimes tell my friend(girl) that i wish i could be fat as her :(\nMy dad is the one who gave me all these hideous body parts\n:'(\nSigh i guess ill be like this 4ever\nBtw dont get any ideas about #1 pls\n\ufeff",
