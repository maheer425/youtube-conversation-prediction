Five years after the crash Icelanders voted the same parties \ninto power that got us into this mess. The first thing they did was to \nrepeal a law that would have had the fishing industry pay their fair share \nfor the exclusive fishing rights that the government had previously handed \nto them for free. The last thing these parties did as while in opposition \nwas, by filibustering and other creative time wasting measures, to block \nthe primary passing of a new constitution (constitutional changes need to \nbe passed by parliament twice, with an election taking place in the \nmeantime). This was a constitution drawn up by citizens elected in a \nnational election (for which people holding political office were \nineligible to run), which would have given vastly greater powers to the \ngeneral public and included a clause ensuring that common national \nresources (including the fish in the sea around Iceland) belonged to the \ngeneral public. Now they're busy effectively raising taxes on the poor and \nalleviating tax on the super rich. Congratulations Iceland.\ufeff",
