Oriana syndra \nleblanc and many most played mids are females. As adc, well yes, right now \nnot a lot of females here (only cait really). And supports, janna, lulu, \nnami, morgana to name a few. Then you say LCS players are male. Well you \nknow about a lot of challenger wemen? I don't know any (i bet they're some \nthat i don't know about). So less girls in challenger tier means less girl \nin LCS. It's as simple as that. get more girls to play this game if you \nwant to see more climb up to challenger and then LCS. And about the band \nbeing only male? come on, that's just retarded girl...",
