The proportion \nof ambidexterity would be what makes ambidexterity neither an advantage or \ndisadvantage. Ambidextrous fighters would have the advantage of giving a \nsurprise attack all the time by changing which hand they fight with while \nalso having the disadvantage of being a less skilled fighter because each \narm would be practiced half as often and so be slower to gain skill. That \nproportion of ambidexterity would be an evolutionary stable strategy \nbecause the rarer ambidexterity is, the less prepared people are to \nfighting an ambidextrous person.\ufeff",

Then it goes on to say \nthis:\n\n> Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are \nset by your genes.\n\nI do not understand how they came to this conclusion based on the above \ndata alone because the children being left-handed could have been affected \nnot only by the genes of the parents but also the environment they were \nbrought up in. Think about it, a child with no left-handed parents is only \nexposed to usage of the right hand and in some cases (as the video \nexplains) right-handedness may even have been enforced by the parents. \nAtleast in my Indian culture they it is. I can explain the above data too \nwith my hypothesis as \n\n* The couple with 2 right-handed parents have the least % of left-handed \nchildren (10%).\n\n* The couples with just one left-handed parent come next because of the \ninfluence of the left-handed dad (17%).\n\n* The couple with the other parent being left-handed comes next, logically. \nI would say the reason why this combination of parents (left-handed mom and \nright-handed dad) beats out the previous combination is because in most \ncultures, the mom is the parent that works with the babies more and in turn \nend up influencing the baby more than a left-handed dad would (22%).\n\n* The couple with both the parents being left-handed would obviously be the \nmost open to their children being left-handed and so they come last with \nthe highest % of left-handed children (25%).\n\nChildren in general, are heavily influenced by what they see because that's \nhow they learn things. Owing what I've said above, I don't agree with the \n\"Handedness is determined by the parents' gene\" part of the video but I did \nfind the part about the \"competitive and cooperative pressures on human \nevolution\" very interesting.\ufeff",
