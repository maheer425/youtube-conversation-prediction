It is not \nsurprising people find the abolishment of work frightening, it has been the \ncore staple of every human enterprise throughout our entire evolutionary \nhistory, even going far back before civilization. Nevertheless with \nadvanced enough technology, the notion of 'jobs' simply no longer has much \nmeaning. And yes, this *is* a very good thing. It will be the pavement to \nutopia, should we collectively allow it to happen. The *only* thing that \ncan stop this is people. \n\nFor all those saying they don't like the idea of no more work, as it \nprovides purpose, a creative outlet, etc. Consider that volunteer groups \nwill likely explode in such a scenario, probably in much the same way \nsocial media has; people will be able to do whatever they want to do with \ntheir time, so countless social groups will spring up - if you in fact \ndon't want to just waste away on your couch forever. \n\nIt is actually a bit morbid to see how scary people find the notion of true \nfreedom to be. As if, were someone not to tell them what to do, they \nwouldn't be able to think of anything to do with themselves. If you think \nlike that then it's time to rethink your life.\ufeff",

Arts and sports will never end, why are people \nwatching other people play chess while we know computers are better? \nBecause we more like humans. People will still love art made by people, \njust because we more like the human creative mind than we do the 'creative \nmind' of computers.
