I don't think the correspondants etc at \nFox News realize exactly how intelligent, well-read & well-rounded he is. \n2nd, it seems to me that the main problem here is ignorance. I'm \ngeneralizing here, but the White people I just heard commenting on Fox News \n& some of whose comments I've read below are ignoring the fact that Black \npeople (and other POC) are treated differently based on your false \nperceptions of us. For some reason, it's race-baiting , divisive & wrong \nfor a group of us to take to the streets & shout that we've had enough of \nbeing mistreated. You project the way you (as a people) would, have & do \nact upon u as instead of actually listening to our complaints. Would you \nlike getting off the bus after a long day at work, walking down the street \non your way home, only to realize a police cruiser is slowly following you? \nThen the officers put on their lights & a quick signal, pull over, get out \nand start asking for your name, ID, where you're coing from, where you're \ngoing, what's in your bag, etc.? And I work as a paralegal at a law firm so \nI was dressed in business attire & had my purse, a book, a water bottle etc \nin a shoulder bag. Has it happened to you?

Hurting people generally doesn\u00b4t help \nanyone.\n\nThere seems to be a general consensus on the things I wrote above. (Please \ncorrect me if I\u00b4m wrong.) But there is, what appears to be, a contradiction \nin the custom to consider it offensive if, and only if, it is used by a \nwhite person.\n\nThe questions I want to ask are the following:\n1) Why is this word not considered offensive when it is used by a black \nperson?\n2) Do you consider this distinction based on skin color racist? (For \nexample, maybe you think it is not racist at all, or you think it\u00b4s \ntechnically or by definition racist but not a big deal, or you think it can \nbe offensive. I\u00b4m curious about your opinion on this.)\n\nI want to make clear I am not trying to criticise anyone with these \nquestions. I am not from the United States and I am genuinely interested in \nunderstanding this feature of American culture. I will end by quoting \nwikipedia and I thank you all in advance for helping me to figure this out.\n\nAccording to wikipedia it \"is a noun in the English language. The word \noriginated as a neutral term referring to black people, as a variation of \nthe Spanish/Portuguese noun negro, a descendant of the Latin adjective \nniger (\"color black\"). Often used disparagingly, by the mid 20th century, \nparticularly in the United States, it suggested that its target is \nextremely unsophisticated. Its usage has become unambiguously pejorative, a \ncommon ethnic slur usually directed at black people of Subsaharan African \ndescent.\"\ufeff",

The simple solution is if your tired of being \nsterotyped then STOP doing things to fall into that sterotype!   its the \nsame way as i think women who whine about being opressed they have a lot to \ndo in not degrading their own selfs in the process... moral of the story is \nwe need to stop playing the blame game if we are going to move ahead at all \nas a sociaity. or this will always happen.\ufeff",
