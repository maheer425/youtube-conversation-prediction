The first \nis like a dynamic loop that can retain a very limited amount of data. \nThat's the portion you use to remember a phone number just long enough to \ndial it. It can be transferred to long term storage from there but in most \npeople it isn't. the next level is what you utilize to learn things. It \nworks in bursts to acquire knowledge then requires time to reset before it \ncan acquire more. In babies this storage is only good for a few seconds but \nthe time grows longer as you grow. The next level requires rest time for \nyour brain to assimilate the knowledge, and it becomes a permanent part of \nyou. That requires sleep. All human memory is associative memory, so the \nmore connections you make to what you already know, the more easily you can \nretrieve particular memories. And sleep increases those associations.\nThe brain, mind and personality is a particular hobby of mine so read a \ngreat many articles on it.",
