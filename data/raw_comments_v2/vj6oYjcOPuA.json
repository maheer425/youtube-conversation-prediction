It was just a minute \nafter he had eliminated in the dining room. I have crate trained him from \nday 1. That doesnt work. He pisses and shits in his crate. He cant hold \nhimself. He is irregular with when he goes. It has nothing to do with when \nhe eats or drinks. He eats and drinks on a consistent basis. First thing in \nthe morning, and no later than 4pm. He just goes to the bathroom at \nirregular times, and he WILL piss and shit where he sleeps. He just does it \nthen barks for me to come and clean it up.

I took \nhim in before something bad happens. He's been with me for over two months \nnow and my only problem with him is that he almost always steps on his poop.\n\nNow, I can't take him for a walk outside because I'm afraid people might do \nsomething to him. I've never heard of friends of mine who have dogs or have \nseen people walking their dogs so basically my dog stays in my room and I \nhave built for him an enclosed space near the bathroom. I made it because \nhe bites things even if I had already bought him stuff for his teeth. Also, \nI work from 2-10 PM. When I get home  his space is just a mess with his \npoop all over and on his paws so most days he gets a shower. Though, I've \nmade a routine with him that I feed him on a particular time and I pick up \nhis poop which I kinda figured out when he does it but its just the time \nwhen I'm sleeping or when I'm away that he steps on his poop.\n\nPlease help.\ufeff",

It may be disgusting sounding, but try taking some of \nthe dog's poop in a plastic container to put at an appropriate spot in a \nnew place. When he smells himself it might encourage him to do his business \nbecause that's how dogs think. That first dog we had was such a head case \nwhen it came to going potty.
