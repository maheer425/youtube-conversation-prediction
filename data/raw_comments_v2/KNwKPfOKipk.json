Time isn't a story being written every fraction of a \nsecond... both the past and future are already there.

So \ntime cannot be modified, simply experienced as is.\n\nThis leaves only one solution to the issue of free will: Every possibility \nmust already exist.

In \nquantum mechanics, a binary decision that is unobserved is technically both \noption A and option B at the same time, until you observe it.\n\nWhen talking about the \"branches\" relative to your consciousness, then it's \nyour choices that determine what \"path\" you travel. Say you have 3 \ndifferent shirts in your drawer, red, orange and blue. Until you choose \nwhich one you wear, all 3 are being worn in the 3 possible futures, all at \nthe same time. It's when you open your drawer and choose which one to wear \nthat determines which path /this instance/ of your consciousness chooses.\n\nRelative to basically any observable event in the universe, it's all down \nto probability if no conscious observer is present to observe the event, \nand control the event. In my previous example, you had the choice of which \npath you wanted to take. A photon of light emitted from the sun has two \npossibilities, A. it somehow reaches your eye (the exact process it took to \nreach your eye is not important), or B. it did not reach your eye. Now, \nremove all control you have over the experiment, say your head is clamped \ndown in such a way that you cannot move it /at all/. Your eye's are forced \nto look dead straight, you cannot move them either. So there is no possible \nway you can manipulate the experiment for the outcome to be what you want \nit to be. If we simply ignored every single object in the path of that \nphoton, and treated the experiment as it either reaches your eye or it \ndoesn't, there's an even 50 / 50 chance for that photon to reach your eye. \nYou cannot control it, so you cannot make this photon reach your eye or not \nif you wanted to. It's down to probability as to what the outcome is.\n\nThis is all just my opinion and belief on it, the whole topic of parallel \nuniverses is honestly opinionated for the time being until factual evidence \nis present.

You \ncan only make guesses and assumptions, which is completely different.\n\nYou're saying that finding order in chaos wasn't meant to be, I agree. But \nI'm saying: what if we all just THINK it's chaos, but in reality it was \norder all along? What if it turns out that it's impossible for chaos to \nexist in the first place, because it doesn't make any sense by *nature*? \nBecause of what it *IS*?\n\n+What's His Name Again?\nI'm asking because consciousness is the *missing link*. You cannot find the \ntruth about this issue without accepting it as truth. Leaving it out will \nresult in unanswered questions.\n\nPeople are saying that their theories are already airtight, but I'm \npresenting a factual hole in their theories by asking this question.\n\nIt's an important point, and yet, it always seems like it can be left out \nof scientific issues without any problems. But then you won't be able to \nfind the whole truth.\n\nAnd its existence is clear yet unprovable. Its meaning cannot even be \n*conveyed* to anybody else without room for misinterpretation.
