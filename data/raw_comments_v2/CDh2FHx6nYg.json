All particles just \nhave to be the same magneticaly for the whole object to have the magnetic \nfeild. This can happen my another stong magnetic feild being near. When two \nmagnets interact it all depends on the magnetic poles. These aren't literal \npoles of course, just a manner of speaking. When the \"North\" pole of a \nmagnet comes into contact with a \"South\" pole of another magnet they \nattract. From now on I'll call them N and S. When S meets S they push away \nfrom each other.Same with N and N. The reson for this is because magnetic \nfields would look like loops if we could see them, and these \"loops\" flow \nin one direction only. (N to S) This means that when two ends of a magnet \nmeat that have the same poles their loops are both trying to \"Swim up \nstream\" against each other. This pushed them away. When two oposite ends \nmeet the loops are flowing with each other so they join. This pulls the two \nobjects twords each other. There's some good YouTube videos that explain \nthis better than I.\n\n\nGlue is quite simplistic. All it has to do is bond some molecules and \nthat's it. It's either that or fill in all the nooks and cranies of an \nobject so that it's like your teeth connect to your gums.\n\n\nScissors are interesting when you think about it like that. They actualy \ncreat enough presure on a certain point, or array of points, and the great \namout of pressure forces molecules to seperate from one another. Scissors \ndo not work on the atomic level. If they did who knows what would happen.",
