But quite \nfrankly, that is not not always the case.\"*\n\nWell to be fair, there is no way to guarantee that *any* incentive or \npolicy will be sufficient to make any given person or agency do their job \nbetter. What you're proposing is no more of a guarantor of quality, \nintegrity or safety for consumers or workers, than is each business's \nnatural incentive to remain in the good graces of the public. In fact, what \nyou're proposing just amounts to forcibly substituting the whim & \ndiscretion of politicians, bureaucrats & administrators, for the \nvalue-judgments & free choices of the general public. That's all it is, in \nthe final analysis.\n\n*\"In terms of a health care company, whenever you do your job, which is \nprovide coverage for health costs, you lose money.\"*\n\nFor one thing, that's by no means necessarily the case. The profits of any \ninsurance company are determined just as much by the performance of their \ninvestment portfolios & the sheer volume of policy-holders, as it is by the \nvolume of claims being paid out at any given time.\nBut in any case, on the subject of insurance, I'll just state right off the \nbat that I am NOT a defender of the status quo, so don't misconstrue \nanything I say on the subject to imply that I am. The US healthcare \nindustry is a mess & is in need of serious reform; however, that being \nsaid, (1) I submit that the reason it's become such a mess is because of \nover half a century of ever-increasing political interventionism, and the \ncurrently prevailing policies are just further steps in the wrong \ndirection; and (2) even with as screwed-up as it's become, the US \nhealthcare system is still the envy of the world, regardless of whatever \nthe leftist demagogues & statist propagandists may say.\n\n*\"arguably, socialized countries like South Korea, the UK, France, and the \nScandanavian countries have much better health care than us, and they are \ngenerally government run agencies that are not for profit. \"*\n\nI'm glad you were at least sensible enough to say \"arguably.\" That's a \nqualitative judgment, and one that I think is best measured by considering \nhow many people from those countries travel to US to receive medical care \nwhen what they need is the best possible treatment & time is of the essence.\nHere's my perspective: There is no such thing as \"free healthcare.\" It goes \nback to the TANSTAFL maxim; there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. \n*Someone* has to pay; whenever human labor-intensive services are involved, \nthat implies a *cost.* Even if the policy was effected by enslaving all \ndoctors, nurses et al, that would just mean that the entire burden of the \ncost of the system was being shouldered by the enslaved professionals.\nAll that is implied in the concept of \"socialized healthcare,\" is that one \npart of society should be forcibly held liable for shouldering the burden \nof the healthcare costs of the whole (the costs incurred by the remainder + \ntheir own); and even amongst the portion of the society which foots the \nwhole of the cost, none are considered responsible for their own individual \nexpenses, but all are considered responsible for a part of everyone else's.\nNow, you may be not be inclined to have any regard for things like \nindividual right or responsibility, but you can't just blithely dismiss \naway the fact that when you sever the natural cause-effect relationship \nbetween a person's decisions & behaviors and the burden of their \nconsequences, it's going to create problems. And when we do that as a \nmatter of course, as a general, systematized policy, then we just \ninstitutionalize those problems.\nThe UK, the Scandinavian \"social democracies,\" the Asian \"Peoples' \nRepublic\" welfare states, are all coming to recognize this. \"Reform\" is the \nword of the day in those countries, as the reality is becoming clear that \ntheir profligate welfare state systems were built upon foolish Utopian \nidealism. It's unsustainable & they're all coming around to openly \nrecognizing it. This is not to say that abandoning welfare statism as such \nis being widely & openly spoken of in those places; they haven't come to \nthat yet. It's going to take a bit longer for them to come around to that. \nFor that, many still entertain the notion that the problem isn't one of \nprinciple, but only one of degree. They're maintaining that their schemes \nwere just too ambitious; rather than inherently unsound & foolhardy. But \neven still, they're going to begin moving in the right direction, while \nhere in the US, we just continue on our long, blind march down the wrong \npath, on the same Road to Serfdom that F.A. Hayek tried to warn us about so \nmany decades ago.\n\n*\"He believes scientific biomedical research should be privatized, which to \nme is ludicrous since privatized biomedical research is very much so \ndifferent from independent NIH granted research.\"*\n\nHe believes, as I do, that if the allocation of scarce resources toward a \ngiven purpose is really so socially-beneficial as to be more urgently \nimportant than all the potential alternative applications, then it wouldn't \nrequire the threat of deadly force to accrue the funding & distribute it \ntoward that end.\nWhat you're claiming here, is that politicians & bureaucrats are more \nenlightened than ordinary people, and if they aren't empowered to \nexpropriate funds from others to have them allocated toward the R&D \nprojects that *they* find most important, then society would be deprived of \nthe scientific knowledge necessary to solve our most urgent & pressing \nproblems.\nI just think that's ridiculous.\nFor one thing, it's not a valid argument to point to given knowledge, \ntechniques or available commodities that were funded by government-funded \nresearch, as a means of asserting that coercive intervention was therefore \nthe only way that research & it's benefits could've possibly come about. \nThat just begs the question, that's all. You have no way of knowing or \nproving that the funding wouldn't have also come about by voluntary, \nprivate means in the absence of state intervention, and was simply just \ncrowded out by it. It's not as if private philanthropists & benefactors \ndon't take these things into consideration!\nAnd in any case, even if it were somehow demonstrable that by government \nintervention was the only way a given R&D project could possibly have come \nabout, then all that's saying is that the government removed resources from \nthe voluntary sector where they would've been allocated along lines \nbelieved to best satisfy the most urgent wants & needs of the people in the \nmost value-productive way, and instead allocated them along lines most \nfavored by a relatively few political elite, their cronies & other \ninterested hangers-on.\nDo you believe you have some way of demonstrating why the latter should be \nconsidered inherently any better than the former?\n \n*\"People got cancer or other diseases.  Sure the company may suffer long \nterm profits but the higher ups were already rich by that time, didn't \nmatter.  The answer to that is not less government, in that situation, to \nme its more.\"*\n\nOf course it matters. If people got sick because of the negligence or \nmisrepresentation of the facts by others, then the guilty parties should be \nmade to pay - meaning they should be \"rich\" no longer; they should just be \nmaking their victims rich, if anything.\nTo me the answer is just common law. Not necessarily \"more government,\" as \nit is just the government doing the one thing that they have any legitimate \npurpose for existing to do in the first place.\nIndeed, if the scope & power of government *was* so limited, to just \nprotecting peoples' personal & property rights from force or fraud, then \nthey would be laser-focused on it, & very efficient. As it is, governments \nare so busy meddling in a hundred thousand different directions, doing \nthings they have no legitimate right or authority to be doing at all, that \nthey're spread way to thin for us to be able to expect them to do the few \nthings that we have a genuinely common need & desire for them to do, on any \nkind of consistent, effective basis.\n\nOkay, I'm out of time, so rant ends now. Hope it had some effect. I'll \ncheck back tomorrow afternoon; I know there's definitely a few other things \nI wanted to get to, anyhow. Peace, have a good night.",

But quite frankly, that is not not always the case.\nLook at health care, for instance.  In terms of a health care company, \nwhenever you do your job, which is provide coverage for health costs, you \nlose money.  And thus, years you make more money, you covered less people. \n You could say well then switch to another company, let your dollar decide, \nyet these companies by default, by the very nature of their existence \nsuffer from the same dichotomies and situations. \nAnd arguably, socialized countries like South Korea, the UK, France, and \nthe Scandanavian countries have much better health care than us, and they \nare generally government run agencies that are not for profit.  \nAnd I'll use another example, science, since I am highly familar with the \ntopic.  Ron Paul, to bring this back to him, wanted to heavily cut funding \nto the NIH, which would dramatically reduce independent and privately \nconducted scientific research in both public and private universities \naround the country (incredibly ironic in my opinion).\nHe believes scientific biomedical research should be privatized, which to \nme is ludicrous since privatized biomedical research is very much so \ndifferent from independent NIH granted research.  NIH funded research is \ntypically based on knowing the nature of disease and health, why something \nis the way it is, and looks at all things as possibilities to stop disease \nprogression.  Privatized medical industry is focused more on profit than \nactually understanding disease, and there have been SSSSOOOO many instances \nof companies falsifying reports to get their product out faster, at the \nexpense of public health.  Even once government found out, the damage had \nalready been done.  People got cancer or other diseases.  Sure the company \nmay suffer long term profits but the higher ups were already rich by that \ntime, didn't matter.  The answer to that is not less government, in that \nsituation, to me its more.  \nAlso privatized medical companies often overlook important things like \nvitamins and their role in disease, as they can't make money off it.  There \nis some money to be made off a supplement here and there, but often times \nthe underlying causes of many disease are things that can't be profited \nfrom.  Also larger studies that track epidemiological trends in populations \nwould never be picked up by private research because once again there is no \nmoney to be made.  How could a company possibly profit from telling the \npublic, say eating more red meat leads to higher cancer rates, purely as an \nexample.\nI think saying private agencies have a lot more to lose is sort of a weak \nargument, IMO at least.  Profit isn't always the primary motivator.  Many \nof the worlds greatest thinkers and innovators get jack-shit in terms of \nfinancial rewards, yet do their science or thinking simply because they \nlove it.  And many great innovations are the product of that.  Also profit \ncan get in the way of those doing their jobs correctly, in the case of \nprivate health insurance agencies.",

The only thing that \nreally distinguishes the state from any or all other man-made institutions, \nis that it claims & enforces a compulsory monopoly on violence in society. \nAnd the implications of that enforced monopoly status resonate throughout \nevery branch, bureau, and agency of the state, in everything they do. In \nthe final analysis, the question we have to ask is, who should we expect to \nhave a more powerful incentive to do their level best to ensure standards \nof safety and/or quality are upheld?

When there's an inordinate spike in the numbers of planes \ncrashing, the FAA gets more money. If there's an outbreak of e coli, the \nFDA gets more money. So on & so forth. Worse still, many bureaucratic \nagencies constitute inherently self-sustaining fiefdoms, whose interests \nare served by the perpetuation of whatever societal ill it is they're \nostensibly supposed to be combating. Do you think the army of OT-working \npolice, detectives, judges, administrators & bureaucrats who are employed \nin the \"War on Drugs\" are really in any hurry to *win* that war? Or, say \nyou were to give any career welfare-state social worker a button, and told \nthem they could eliminate poverty in their community by pushing it, do you \nthink that would be an easy decision for them, as it would be for most \nanyone else?\nContrarily though, private accrediting firms & insurance agencies have a \npowerful financial incentive to make sure the firms they associate with \nhave effective safety/quality assurance programs. The inspectors & \nadministrators who work for Underwriters Laboratories or Better Business \nBureau have a completely different behavioral incentive structure than \nthose employed by the state. The question is, which is more conducive to \naccomplishing the shared stated purpose? And I think it answers itself.\nAll we can rightfully, & should realistically, expect from any institution \ncalling itself \"government,\" is the equal protection of the life, liberty & \nproperty of all individuals, & courts of civil & criminal law to resolve \nconflict, settle disputes, & exact just restitution for rights-violations. \nAnd that's about it.\nKeep in mind, government is force. When we consider what is the proper role \nof government in society, what we're really considering is what is the \nappropriate role of violence in society. If your answer is anything more \nthan the equal defense of the rights of all, then what you're really saying \nis that you repudiate rule of law, and instead just wish to have a safer, \nmore convenient means of trafficking in the rights & property of others, \nthan by having to do so at your own personal risk.",

But at the same time, I don't think that big business is \nany better suited to do so.  Our government functions on a system of checks \nand balances, and I think that our economic and social issues need that \nsame sort of regulation.\nI understand your sentiments, that perhaps government is overstepping its \nbounds.  I really do, what with the recent NSA scandal and such things. \n But I honestly, at the same time, really don't think we should ax the \ngovernment in favor of total free market, I think government might need a \nhedgetrimmer but not the ax.\nFree market can be just as corrupt, and has proven to be so on countless \noccassions, and thus there needs to be a counter balance, there needs to be \nan EPA testing water near large factories.  There needs to be an FDA \ntesting foods.

Ron Paul is \none of the very few modern legislators, certainly the only one in recent \nmemory, who understood that dichotomy, and who demonstrated any *real* \nregard for individual liberty and rule of law.\nAlso, yes, of course he recognizes that not only is it unconstitutional for \nthe federal government to presume to commandeer the security & maintenance \nfunctions of private airlines, but also that no agencies have a better \nincentive to see to airline safety & security standards than the individual \nairline firms themselves.\nBut I suppose your one of these True Believers who thinks that the only \nthing compelling commercial airlines to properly maintenance their aircraft \nare government bureaucrats? or that the only reason why the milk you buy \nfrom the store isn't rotten or swimming with deadly bacteria is because of \nFDA codes?\nIf that's really how you think, then you're even more hopelessly deluded \nthan the average member of the cult of statism.

Well, \nConservatives do too, but in different ways.\n\nI read what you said about murders being caused while high. All the while \nignoring the fact that far more murders are caused from the underground \ndrug market.\n\nIf you look at places like San Francisco, who have recently stopped \nenforcing drug laws altogether, murder has actually dropped, significantly. \nBecause police resources have been drastically freed up and people don't \nNEED to kill over drug territories and such.\n\nYou know what else is dangerous and messes with you mental faculties? \nAlcohol. Do you know what happened when Alcohol was banned here in the US? \nCrime, including violent crime increased because it was sent underground. \nAnd we are seeing the exact same thing happen with the war on drugs.\n\nBut most of all. I'm just pissed that people, both Liberal and Conservative \nalike feel this overwhelming need to FORCE people at the barrel of a \nfucking gun to do what they PERSONALLY believe is right to fellate their \nown self-righteous ego and that sort of attitude is sickening.\n\nOh and for the record, I do not agree with drug use or promote it in any \nway, but, I believe that people should be allowed to run their lives the \nway they see fit because that is what freedom is and as far as I'm \nconcerned freedom is the most important thing on the planet.",
