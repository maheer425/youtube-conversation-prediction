The middle class hurts due to high taxation, corporate \nwelfare, and too much regulation.  Cities are ruled by left leaning \npoliticians who favor socialistic policies, look it up son.  Education is \nrun through the federal government so obviously it sucks, another issue is \nthe fact that in the U.S you do not need to pass a standardized test to \nmove on to the next grade, it makes scores look lower, but it allows people \nto choose their own destiny.  High healthcare costs are a result of \npatents, evil lawyers (lack of tort reform), and massive regulation, this \ndrives costs up and forces doctors to run excessive tests.  Happiness?  I \ncannot speak for the masses, but I am unhappy.  I am unhappy because of \nexcessive spending, regulation, and tyranny.  I mostly oppose the federal \ngovernment, state government is fine, state governments can address many of \nthe issues.  They ought to dictate policy on most issues because they are \ncloser to the problem and can more effectively deal with it.\n\nOur military is evil, they have way too much funding, they ought to remove \nforeign military bases and cut funding by 90%.  The world should be left to \nits own devices.  Europe should not be protected, the middle east should be \nallowed to remain in chaos, and the U.S should protect itself and no one \nelse in the world.  \n\nCorporatism is a violation of the free market, this is chrony-capitalism a \nstaple of fascism.  Government allows corporatism to happen, with a removal \nof barriers to entry there will be increased competition and a restoration \nof the free market.  There needs to be a removal of economic interests from \npolitical issues, this is the source of corruption in the U.S.\n\nMy grandfather was head of the forest service from '93-96, my father works \nfor the government himself.  I oust to be a leftist, but after reading \nFrederick von Hayek, Milton Friedman, John Locke, and George Orwell I \nbecame a firm libertarian  I'm a economics major, I apply economics to \nthese issues and this is the basis of my views.  I'm a firm believer in the \nAustrian school of economics, and the Chicago University school of \neconomics.  I formulated my belief system myself with the influence of the \naforementioned figures.  I am extremely disgruntled, I hate the \nRepublicans, I hate the Democrats more.  I am a man without a political \naffiliation, I believe in the free market, liberty, and self reliance.  \n\nTotally agree btw, guns are a tool, people use the tools the wrong way. \n Gun control is a failed policy, look at Chicago, they have absurd gun \ncontrol and a high murder rate.  Gun violence is a product of poverty, \npoverty created by regulation.  The right to bear arms must be respected \nbecause guns are needed to overthrow tyrannical governments.  The first \nstep to a totalitarian regime is to take away firearms.  \n\nI am not satisfied with the current U.S situation, a number of reforms \ncould be made.  It appears I'm never going to make progress, we're both \nfirm in our beliefs.  I will say I would rather be left to fend for myself \nthen be ruled by government.",
