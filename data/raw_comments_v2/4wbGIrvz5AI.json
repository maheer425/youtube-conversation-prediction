            "text": "+Loki Wolfe You'd be pretty surprised to find out that pleasing men is not \nthe main reason why women wear makeup...Many people (because I'm pretty \nsure there are people other than women who wear makeup) wear it as a means \nof expression, or to bring out a feature they like on their face, or even \njust because it's fun (let's face it, makeup is basically a grownup version \nof face painting). It's kind of like clothes: I assume you buy or wear \nclothes you like/think look good on you-That button-up is hot on you, and \nthat suit makes it look like you got your whole life together, and OH YEAH \nthese pants make you feel like you're ready for the zombie apocalypse. Same \nconcept with makeup: some will wear a red-hot lipstick because they think \nthey look hella rad with it, while others will get their eyebrows done \nbecause hey, when your eyebrows are on fleek, you could destroy \ncivilizations if you really wanted to.",

            "text": "+eartianwerewolf I understand your point, but some women (who believe they \n*really* need makeup due to the 'poor' or 'unfair' cards they were dealt, \ngenetically) will pile it on thick trying to get themselves a man, and they \nwill oft continue to do so every time they see them after establishing a \nrelationship with that man to keep up appearances. What is that man going \nto think, years down the road, when he finally sees his [now] lover without \nany paint on her face? People are generally superficial and tend to want \nthe most beautiful person that they are able to get their hands on (no pun \nintended). I'm just saying, for a man who can really see past the physical \n'flaws' of a woman, that should be the type of man that a woman would want \nto spend the rest of her life with- not the man who is just looking for the \nhottest woman he can find, and later become disappointed at how the woman \nactually looks when they are not all dolled up.",
