He is making it seem as if \nwhatever Palin is saying is so obviously dumb but this is not the case. On \nthe Israel and Palestinian issue, she said she's in favor of building more \nsettlement which is the view of a number of conservatives in the US. I'm \nsure you can even find a number of Democrats to agree to that. What about \nthe peace process becoming impossible because of it? Well, they are just \nbeing hypocritical about it, but not dumb. On the economy, it's just pure \nrhetoric. If she wasa in debate setting, she would be put to shame for her \nignorance. But this is an interview and she didn't get a chance to say \nsomething that dumb and got away with it. About Afghanistan, the supposed \ncontradiction is that she advocates more troops so the Afghanis can stand \non their own without the help of troops. Well, she might be saying more \ntroops now for the Afghanis now to defeat the enemy, so the Afghanis can be \nindependent further down the road. My point? If you want to pick on Palin, \nthere are a lot of ignorant things she said out there. But please do not \ntry to find new things to pick on when there isn't, at least not in terms \nof them being so dumb! Let us remain constructive in our criticism!\ufeff",
