For anyone to insist gays need to continue life as second \nclass citizens or to follow whatever ridiculous \"rules\" set up by anyone's \n\"faith\" is no longer just embarrassing, but offensive. Equality is a thorn \nin the side only of those who are truly inferior. Your religion has no \nbearing on the law of the land. If you prefer sitting at the back of the \nbus, go ahead! Who's stopping you? It's time to stop \"ordering around\" \npeople who neither want nor need your input in their own life choices. A \ngay person living a life in misery by either abstaining from any meaningful \nrelationships or forcing themselves into a heterosexual marriage no longer \nneeds to make such a choice. For those who are quite content with their \nnatural homosexual attractions there will be the option to live happily and \ncontently with a same sex spouse. Who am I (or who are you) to judge them? \nThe ultimate sexual perversion is abstinence.\ufeff",

            "text": "You can conceive of gays as a minority that can be organized\nand used to justify modifying the collective, spearheading social\nchange along lines very much exceeding what 99% of gays THEMSELVES \never envisioned.\n\nIt may seem to most straights that the gay priorities they hear so much \nabout, marriage, adoption, equality, combatting hate and whatnot, reflect \nthe urgent wishes and desires of gay men in general.\n\nHowever, when taking a closer look at those gays and lesbians who are most \nenergetic and vocal in their defense of such goals, we find that they are \nusually very young and, to put it mildly,  not well-read at all\u2026\n\nNor do they appear to have much  life-experience, and clearly haven\u2019t even \nknown what the gay scene was once like. They are very reactive and loud, \nkind of like rebellious teenagers.\n\nTheir general mindframe appears to be that it is \u00ab empowering \u00bb or \nsomething, to outshout their adversaries: christians, haters and \nhomophobes, closet gays, patriarchs, heteronormistic authoritarians and \nbasically, men in general.\n\nIs the actual idea young gays have today that being gay is all about \nshrieking at others? It certainly seems so\u2026\n\n \n\nExcept for the actual agents and paid media puppets, the most vocal gays, \nthose who make the most noise,  are usually the younger ones who have \nthought about matters the least.\n\nThey are intellectually undeveloped, and unfortunately, this isn\u2019t merely a \ncase of not reading too much;  the issue in reality isn\u2019t strictly of an \n\u2018intellectual\u2019 nature, we\u2019re dealing with something larger here:\n\nthese vocals gays must strike a lucid observer as also being emotionally \nimmature and undeveloped, but not in the possibly amusing, touching or \ninnocent way of a 4 year old.\n\nRather, it\u2019s as if they haven\u2019t emotionally matured CORRECTLY, and have \nturned into something farcical, not to say tragic.\n\nWatch those gays slur and shriek and whine on social media sites, and then \nthink of your favourite male actor in one your favourite action movies.\n\nWhat qualities does the actor\u2019s character have? He\u2019s probably handsome, \nmasculine, brave, smart, deep, perseverant, adventurous, developed, and \nsoforth. It\u2019s easy to immediately write down a list.\n\nConversely, when looking at the vocal, militant gay, it\u2019s a real \nhead-breaker to even note down ONE apparent quality.\n\nThe list of negative qualites however easily comes pouring out of the \nkeyboard:\n\nthey whine, shriek, slur and insult, are ignorant and bigoted\u2026They\u2019re not \ncurious or adventurous, they\u2019re certainly not funny. They have no depth, \nare often bitter and unhappy. They don\u2019t look masculine, and are rarely \nattractive.\n\nThey are intellectually dishonest, lie easily, have no conception of \nvirtue, have no clue of the system the live in. They blindly trust \nauthority, are politically illiterate\u2026The list goes on and on\u2026\n\n \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s fair to say in a general sense that these people simply seem \npsychologically, psychically UNDER-DEVELOPED.\n\n They have no identifiable higher qualities, that could present an asset to \nthe collective.\n\nThey are basically shrieking gay drones.\n\n \n\nBecause of these shrieking, intellectually and emotionally undeveloped gays \npolluting the social sphere with the worst kind of propaganda piffle, and \nbecause more thoughtful gays prefer to not join the noisy and boring \nchorus, an image of gays has taken shape in society.\n\nThis image was created by the media and is being perpetuated by all the \nmost irrelevant and unfortunate gay entities:\n\nit\u2019s a question of those having the least to offer shrieking the loudest, \nwhile always presuming and suggesting they are defending a larger cause, of \nwhich they are the self-proclaimed voiceboxes.\n\nBasically, they tell society that they are speaking for all males with \nhomosexual desires.\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nIn fact, like the proverbial rats leaving the sinking ship, it is not \nunusual to actually hear  older generations of gay activists tacitly \nconfess in interviews reminiscing about the old days that they\u2019re not too \nhappy with the current developments\u2026\n\nIt now turns out they\u2019re not really for gay assimilation after all. Gay \nassimilation refers to the full blending into mainstream culture, and a \nfull \u2018equalization\u2019 of gays and straights.\n\nYou\u2019ll find VERY few 60 year old gays in general, and actually few elderly \nactivists, who don\u2019t consider things were MUCH, MUCH better 30 or 40 years \nago. \n\nOf course, older generation activists have to be careful about  what they \nsay, especially since they THEMSELVES were the ones instrumental in \nbringing about the modern situation.\n\nOften, they\u2019ll state something general to the effect that gays have come a \nlong way, and that things have changed so much, but when pressed for a more \npersonal view, will admit that they\u2019re not really crazy about the current \nstate of gay culture.\n\nThey obviously don\u2019t want to create a crisis or a situation, so their \ncriticism remains subtle and is never full on. But it\u2019s quite noticeable \nanyway what they\u2019re really thinking.\n\nThey\u2019re clearly thinking: God, how much more fun it was back then!!! You \nguys today have NOTHING left!!!\n\nAs soon as older generation activists talk about gay life in the old days, \nthe 70s or even the 60s or the 50s, their faces instantly light up: it was \nall such fun, so exciting!! \n\nHarry Hay in later life was one of the most vocal older-generation \nactivists overtly criticising and opposing assimilation.\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nSo most gays today don\u2019t know where they came from, where they\u2019re going, or \nwho or what they even are.\n\nConsidering this profound state of ignorance, it was only logical that so \nmany gays would turn into hysterical bigots chanting party-lines.\n\nSurreptiously, stealthily, gayness is being associated with an entire \nideology and set of social priorities that are COMPLETELY convergent with \nauthority\u2019s agendas and the dominant political and cultural paradigm ALL OF \nUS are being versed into.\n\n \n\nYou will find modern  \u2018gay culture\u2019 in the West abhors religious \nfundamentalism and is rabidly positioned against Islam (Dan Savage\u2019s \u00ab Say \nYes to War in Irak \u00bb).\n\nAll vocal gays energetically defend atheism and are completely uncritical \nof science and technology.  This signifies the medical system controls \ntheir health,  darwinism controls their view of life, and experts in \ngeneral are invested with full authority.\n\nPornography is considered an expression of freedom, pedophilia is hardly \nconsidered a problem, consumerism is self-evident and our entire system is \npretty much considered sane.\n\nPoliticians are trusted, conspiracies don\u2019t exist, and law-making is the \nonly way to secure progress.\n\n \n\nIt is undeniable: gay activism and the mediatic and political priorities \nare FULLY IN SYNC.\n\nRealizing this provides us with the answer to gaylib\u2019s success:\nhow naive can gays be, to think politicians are interested in\nsexual preference!\n\nThey are of course interested in USING this issue for furthering\ntheir priorities.\n\nTheir priorities are clear and have been formulated:\na New World Order.\n\n \n\nLike communism, a NWO requires the elimination of organic and historical\ncommunities and tradition, religious sentiment, patriotism, \u2018blood \nand soil\u2019 mentalities, the destruction of social cohesion and sense of \n identity, and the abolishing altogether of any type of absolute reference.\n\nA new order requires the abolition of the old order.\n\nGaylib has been an effective ploy for furthering these goals, in fact \nsignificantly spearheading them in society.\n\nHow convenient that science AND gay activists constantly bash religion! \nThat politicians AND gay activists bash Islam. That the porn industry AND \ngay activists promote sexual consumerism.\n\nThat Big Pharma AND gay activists push poison pills. That jewish media AND \ngays constantly warn us about fascism and the suffering of minorities. This \nlist goes on and on\u2026\n*\n\n \n\nMany gays, especially the more programmed younger generations fail to\nappreciate how their plight FULLY CONVERGES with the goals of corporate, \npolitical and elite controllers; the gays have got it all UPSIDE-DOWN.\n\nThey believe they pressured elites into backing their plight, not realizing \nthat they are in reality being used for someone else\u2019s purposes.\n\nGays today  are positioned in their US-versus-THEM mindframe, figuring that \nas long as \u2018hate\u2019 and \u2018homophobia\u2019 are being attacked, as long as religion \nis being ridiculed and as long  as pro-gay legislation is being passed, \nthings are looking up.\n\nThis is being VERY shortsighted. This oppositionality to \u2018evil others\u2019 is \nin reality ALL THAT GAYS HAVE LEFT. Nothing else remains.\n\n \n\nThe substance of gay life has been replaced by the concepts of a new and\nbizarre \u2018gay\u2019 (ungay?) ideology that is as simplistic, shallow and \nimmature as it is effective in mobilizing unhappy people stripped of \nknowledge, life experience and understanding;\n\nits essence is victimology, and its glorified aim of attaining full legal \nequality in terms of civil rights is defended with a vengeance by many \ngay men, especially the younger ones, for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIdentifying and locating an oppressor, an \u2018evil other\u2019, is the only way of \nshifting responsibility to an outer source for one\u2019s failure to find \npersonal happiness and experience psychological growth.\n\n \n\nThe system has in fact been chain-producing oppression-narratives since \ncenturies, creating US-versus-THEM categories that always impute the source \nof all problems of one social group to the evil of another.\n\nWith Marx, an entire ideological system was edified upon this scape-goating\nmechanism, purporting to provide a fullblown science about the nature of\nsociety and how it evolves through clashes between opposing groups.\n\nMinority struggles and civil rights movements such as black lib and gaylib\nare solidly anchored in Marxist ideology, and it is no secret that\npretty much all the early post WWII activists were communists, setting\nup the civil rights movements.\n\nIn order to sell this oppression-narrative to the \u2018minority group\u2019, it\ndoesn\u2019t suffice to just make the constat that one group oppresses\nanother.\n\nFor the narrative to have a potential for mobilization, it must come with\na goal of change, since otherwise the constat would merely be depressing\nand stripped of constructive implications.\n\n \n\nThus what is required is a PROGRAM, and this program must promise an\nendgoal, if the minority, or the oppressed group is to buy into it.\n\nThis is why the proletariat was promised a \u2018Utopia\u2019, why Martin Luther\nKing spoke of the \u2018Promised Land\u2019, and gaylib promises \u2018Equality\u2019.\n\n \n\nObserve how VAGUE these promises are, how they are never developed into\na fullblown vision of the future state of society;\nwhat is being promised is a CONCEPT, completely stripped of SUBSTANCE.\n\n \n\nThe problem that now rises is that the minority, or those who feel \noppressed, and who may very well have been oppressed IN ACTUALITY,  are so \neager to find a culprit responsible for their suffering, so angry and \ndriven by all sorts of hang ups and pent up emotions, that they are not in \na position to engage in rational thought and analyze their circumstances \nand the situation lucidly.\n\nWhile the state of oppression they are experiencing may indeed be a result \nof\nACTUAL oppression, their eagerness to identify an oppressor will make\nthem settle for ANY culprit the media provides them with.\n\n \n\nAnd so the workers are told the capitalists are responsible for all the ills\nin the world, women are told men are, blacks are told white people are \nresponsible for their suffering, the Western world is told Islam\u2019s\nhighest goal is to do away with Freedom and Democracy, and gays are told \nreligious bigots and pretty much all straight men are responsible for\ntheir misery.\n\n \n\nBut WHAT IF the REAL source of oppression is more diffuse than that?\n\nWhat if pretty much ALL of society\u2019s members, straights and gays alike, \nmales and females, blacks and whites, EVERYBODY is experiencing some form \nof  oppression?\n\n \n\n*\n\nAnd thus it seems the gay dream today is to be \u2018equal\u2019 to straights, and no \nlonger be  \u2018oppressed\u2019\u2026\n\nOne instantly senses that this notion of \u2018equality\u2019 must have a very \nprecise meaning, even though it is seldom explicitated what that would be, \nwhat precisely such equality entails.\n\nWhat does gay life look like when gays are fully equal to straights? What \ndoes this notion of  \u2018equality\u2019 really entail? What virus is lurking in \nthis concept?\n\nIndeed, how could a woman be \u2018equal\u2019 to a man, or a black to a white or a \ngay to a straight? Why would these very nomers, these categories, even \nexist if these people were indeed equal and the same.\n\nWhy even call a woman a woman, and not a man, if a man and a woman are \nequal and the same? Why not simply  call a black man \u2018white\u2019, if he is \nequal and the same to white men?\n\n \n\nThe notion of \u2018equality\u2019 of course refers to EXACT equal treatment of\nall people under the law.\n\nBut if this is REALLY the objective, then the fastest way to get there\nwould be to make no legal provisions at all that specifically target\n\u2018minorities\u2019 or their treatment.\n\nIn real life, does this  \u2018equality\u2019 for women, blacks or gays bring an end \nto oppression?\nWell, only in a very specific situation:\n\nonly if the group one is becoming \u2018equal\u2019 with is NOT oppressed itself.\n\nIs this the case? Are white males in society NOT oppressed?\n\n \n\nWhat if a straight human resource in a production process is really in a \nstate of oppression too?\nWhat if not only the entire Third World has been oppressed and ravaged since\ncenturies, but ALL HUMAN RESOURCES are?\n\nWhat if millions of people are oppressed by psychiatry and hundreds of\nmillions poisoned by the medical system?\n\nWhat if everybody is owned by bankers?\n\nWhat if the ENTIRE SYSTEM is fundamentally oppressive?\n\nWhat if ALL of society\u2019s members are oppressed by a few?\n\nWhat if it is being a bit too simple-minded to simply identify another\ngroup as the source of all ills?\nAnd what if it is in fact the WRONG group that is identified as the \nultimate cause of all problems?\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nThe masses are unaware of how society is being managed like a cattle-farm,\nand what kind of principles are being applied.\n\nWith regards to gay activism, it seems that with each legal victory that is \nsecured, the gay man is stripped of yet another piece of the substance of \nthe gay life he once had,  becoming yet angrier and even more embittered, \nrealizing little that as  society is changing, his very life and identity \nare being changed with it, in ways he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nThis process has spiralled so far out of control, that it is fair to  say \nthat today, any straight guy who seems equipped with a fair dose of \n masculinity and virility, and who posseses a significant amount of traits \nhistorically associated with \u2018real men\u2019, is no longer the subject of a gay \nman\u2019s dreams and fantasies:\nsuch men are now fast becoming \u2018the enemy\u2019.\n\nMaybe it is time to start wondering just what exactly went wrong, if the \ndefining feature of today\u2019s vocal and out gay man is actually his HATRED of \n\u2018real men\u2019, rather than his inherent attraction for such males.\n\nSuch an alarming and bizarre conundrum would imply a tragic, fundamental \nimpossibility at the very heart of modern male/male sexual love under the\ncurrent, promoted paradigm.\n\n \n\nThis scenario isn\u2019t at all as farfetched as it might seem:\nmost homosexuals today are experiencing very significant difficulty finding \nwarmth and love.\n\nAs the gayscene disappears, many homosexual simply don\u2019t have a gay \nlifestyle to engage in anymore, and the nomer \u2018gay\u2019actually starts to feel \ninadequate; indeed, without even a gay lifestyle, what is a gay but a \nhomosexual man?\n\nWithout any kind of gay infrastructure or gay social context,\nthe gay identity is stripped of its substance, and becomes no more\nthan a difference in sexual preference that best remains hidden.\n\nUnder these circumstances, many homosexuals will end up having to settle \nfor quick, discreet, and often guilty encounters with other males in \nparks, parking spaces and highway rest areas, where people have learned \nto cruise from the safety of their cars.\n\nIt is obvious that there is no place for another male in the lives of such \nfast-growing numbers of \u2018closet homosexuals\u2019. \n\n \n\nMaybe you don\u2019t notice it yet in the Marais in Paris, or in Castro district \nin San Francisco, but in any small town or midlle-sized city in the Western \nworld, homosexual men do NOT advertise their sexual preference at all.\n\nWearing sunglasses and sitting in parked cars reading a newspaper or \npretending to be engaged in phone conversations, these guys certainly don\u2019t\nmake boyfriend material.\n\nThey won\u2019t meet a fullblown man, but just his c**k, just like back in\nthe 50s. They won\u2019t marry the guy they meet, won\u2019t live together, and are \nvery likely to never meet again, with the guy they spend 15 minutes with.\n\nThe experience is quick and degrading, leaving an after-taste of vice,\nguilt and loneliness.\nThe homosexual act is fully walled off from the rest of that guy\u2019s life.\n\n \n\nThis is the position countless homosexuals and bi\u2019s are in today, unless \nthey live in big cities and recreational areas with a remaining, significant\ngay infrastructure.\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, gay-themed movies also seem to reflect a fundamental problem \nwith the modern gay model and gay identity.\n\nWatch ANY of the many dozens of vapid gay movies that have been put out\nin the last decade or so, and observe the main characters\u2026\n\nThere is hardly any polarity between them. NOT ONE of those movies\nfeatures the kind of electric dynamic Hollywood could create so well\nbetween famous screen couples.\n\n \n\nIn gay movies, you won\u2019t find a rough guy sticking it to a soft guy,\nbecause that would be \u2018stereotyping\u2019.\n\nIn fact, many lead actors in modern gay-themed movies are actually \nstraight. They are clean, reasonably goodlooking, young, and so is the guy \nthey fall in love with.\n\nAll the time the subtext appears to be: \u2018See? gay men are just like\nanybody else\u2019, while simultaneously the exact contrary is evidenced\nby the very fact that this point is being made with such insistence.\n\nThe lead actors are so similar to one another that sexual chemistry is \nlacking altogether.\n\nThe absence of convincing sexual chemistry in gay movies speaks volumes\nabout the state of gay love in the world;\n\nindeed, if the story lines are this trite and predictable, if the \ncharacters hardly have any depth at all, if there is not a single memorable \nscene between two lead actors in gay roles, then could it be that there is \nsomething fundamentally dysfunctional  altogether about the gay paradigm \npoliticians, the media and Hollywood are trying to sell us?\n\nCould it be that male/male relations are in fact NOT identical and the\nsame and perfectly equal to male/female relations?\n\nIf they can\u2019t even show us a workable, credible and interesting gay \nrelation in a MOVIE, then what does this tell us about its feasibility and \nits prevalence in real life?\n\nWhy would they even make movies exclusively revolving around a gay\nrelation unless a model for it needs to be provided?\n\n *\n\nGays didn\u2019t challenge heterosexual power. \u2018Government\u2019 created a theatrical \nconfrontation between paid, owned gay actors and society at large, changing \nsociety in the process, in a way  that benefits neither straights nor gays, \nbut only those who pull ALL of society\u2019s strings, and who shape culture.\n\nWhat can the scope of gay love be, when society\u2019s gays have been turned \ninto programmed drones?\ufeff",

The real questions are WHAT IS \nMARRIAGE and WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, WHAT ARE IT'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY? \n She failed to address ANY of those (as nearly everyone does)!  Gay \nmarriage is a misnomer.  One must simply assume the fundamental \nREdefinition of the institutions of marriage AND family FIRST.  This is not \nabout personal FEELINGS and EMOTIONS.  And FYI, I don't need your approval \nor a piece of paper to be UNITED to a member of the OPPOSITE sex.  SAME SEX \npersons (who are notoriously promiscuous\u2014and yes the rest of the nation is \ncatching up with them) cannot be united and thus, in principle, cannot ever \nbe united or contribute to natural marriage or generate a family\u2014ever.  It \nis simply impossible!  Who cares if she was speaking from the heart? \n Pedophiles, polygamists (bisexuals?), and the loving folks from PETA can \nmake the same kind of plea!  (Jeffery Dahmer's was not so emotional, but it \nwas completely rational!)  Look, social institutions are NOT created to \naffirm the emotions of individuals, they are there for the benefit of the \nwhole, they should serve to encourage what is natural (biologically \nspeaking), encourage what is only the natural, necessary, and HEALTHY NORMS \n(NOT biological deviancy), and for the protection of the next generation.\n\nWHY are our leaders making such silly emotional appeals and not using \nreason and logic, or even appealing to science (anatomy and biology)?\n\nAlso, Walsh appeals to rights (unalienable?) and what is actually right \n(universal moral absolutes?)\u2014yet she provides no rational basis for \ndiscovering this whatsoever\u2014she simply assumes that what she asserts IS \nwhat is right!  (Clearly, biological function and design is not an accepted \nmeans of assisting in determining such things.)  From where does the idea \nof universal human rights and dignity come?  Who made that rule?  (NOT from \nscience and NOT from evolution theory!) Why do we believe that human life \nis worthy of dignity and respect (not to be confused with human behavior)? \n And if our rights are so important, what about homosexual adoptions?  That \nis a preemptive guarantee that the natural born right of the child to a \nmother and father is intentionally denied (violated\u2014infringed upon), is \nsomething that does NOT comport with the social sciences, while granting a \nspecial right/privilege (something our founders warned us against) to a \ngross minority group to whom nature itself has denied the very capacity for \never generating offspring from within the confines of a monogamous \nrelationship! (The monogamous relationship being something else that is \nbetter for nations, individuals, and families\u2014but largely laughed at by the \ntypical, shortsighted, selfish pleasure seekers).\n\nHer appeal may provoke an emotional reaction\u2014but her argument is not \nconsistent, says nothing about the institution of marriage itself, and \nwithout a point of reference for what is actually morally right and no \ntranscendent source for the rights she invokes as absolute, it is also \nirrational.\n\nFinally, yes, I know some people who are gay\u2014but oddly enough, that hasn't \nchanged my attitude towards their sexual behavior one bit.  I love them, \nI'm not crazy about what they do and I know that certain primarily \nhomosexual acts are inherently dangerous (ie. not good for anybody), while \nI have never, ever met a truly monogamous homosexual\u2014ever.  (In fact, I've \nhad lots of friends who did lots of bad things\u2014cheaters, alcoholics, \nabusers, former drug runners, potheads, etc.  My attitude towards those \nkinds of behaviors never changed either.  And if I met some \nsadomasochists\u2014I don't care if they personally enjoy it, it is still a \nsickness.)  I've even had a homosexual boast to me that, while many of his \nhomosexual friends were promiscuous, he was not.  In fact, he assured me \nthat he could count on just 2 hands the number of sexual partners he had \nhad.  2-hands?  I guess the definition of promiscuous has change in recent \nyears...  I'm sure the definition for 'monogamy' has also changed.  By now, \nI fear it simply means that you aren't doing more than one person at a time.\n\nHeterosexual and homosexuals sexual relations are fundamentally different. \n One has the potential that in principle the other has absolutely no \npotential for and thus they are NOT equal.  One is a comprehensive \nbiological union of two persons, the other requires pretending, \nstimulating, simulating, or violating, but there can never be a \nconsummating in any biological sense.  Men and woman have complimentary \nparts and it is their *potential* for procreation that makes the \ninstitution of marriage important and valuable, and human life possible. \n The other is sterile by definition and a biological deviancy (no matter \nwho engages in such behavior\u2014be they gay or straight).  Whatever they are, \nthey are not equal.  Oh sure, the people involved may *feel* the same, no \none is denying that there are emotions involved or sexual desire, but in \nprinciple, they simply are not the same. \ufeff",

That is, unless one defaults to \nand accepts the fundamental REdefintion of marriage where it is dumbed-down \nand defined as a mere *emotional* pairing of any 2 people (while this \narbitrary limit on \"love\" [according to the \"RE\" definition] is now being \nchallenged as well).\n\n** \u201cIT'S THE SAME THING.\u201d\nOnly as pertains to the fact that there are 'feelings' (*emotions*) \ninvolved.\n\n** \u201cBECAUSE THEY BOTH CELEBRATE THE LOVE THE COUPLE FEELS FOR EACH OTHER\u2026\u201d\nWrong.  Marriage is not merely an emotional institution.  If that were the \ncase, then the government would have no vested interest in regulating or \nlegislating such an institution at all.  *Social* institutions are not \nestablished for the sake of *individuals* and private relationships or \ntheir personal feelings (*emotions*).\n \n** \u201c\u2026AND THEY BOTH CAN AND SOMETIMES DO RESULT IN RAISING CHILDREN\u2026\u201d\nWrong again.  Partners of the same sex can NEVER generate a natural family, \never, under any circumstances.  It is impossible.  While homosexual \nadoptions preemptively guarantee the violation of the child\u2019s natural born \nrights to a mother and father.  (Demonstrating the fundamental difference \nand selfish nature of the average homosexual advocate.)  Our founders \nwarned that granting special rights and privileges to any group of people \nwould inevitably lead to the violation of the rights of others\u2014and in this \ncase, that is the rights of children, who are some of the most innocent and \neasily influenced among us.\n \n** \u201c \u2026IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT\u2026\u201d\nAnd so few environments these days, due to the loss of the Judeo-Christian \nprinciples this country was founded upon, are stable\u2014least of all \nhomosexual couples who are known for high rates of suicide, drug abuse, \nhigher rates of pedophilia (per capita), open relationships, promiscuous \nbehavior, disease, domestic violence, etc.\n \n** \u201c\u2026AND GO ON TO LEAD PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPY LIVES.\u201d\nWhich means we need more homes that represent that kind of environment (and \npolicies/beliefs that make engender such homes), not less.  The social \nsciences have shown that the ideal environment for children is a stable, 2 \nparent, biological household.  The purpose of marriage is to support and \nencourage the ideal, not the exceptions\u2014or those relationships that, by \ndefinition, can never represent the ideal.\n\n** \u201cTHESE ARE FACTS YOU CANNOT IGNORE BY SIMPLY TRYING TO ARGUE THAT THEY \nARE NOT THE SAME.\u201d\nWhat does a stable environment (a good thing) have to do with illicit \nsexual practices that are responsible for so much instability, abuse, \nbrokenness, disease, suffering, and even death?  (Hmmmm, maybe I just \nanswered my own question...)\n\n** \u201cBECAUSE TO DO SO HARKENS BACK TO THE FAILURE OF THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENT \nUSED AGAINST INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE\u2026\u201d\nThat is another absurd claim that I think we\u2019ve already addressed before, \nwhere you claim that things that are fundamentally different are exactly \nthe same.

Let me \nelaborate: It used to be that ANY person in the US could marry ANY other \nperson of their choosing, so long as that person was a member of the \n*OPPOSITE* sex, was of LEGAL age, consented, and was NOT a close relative. \nIt used to be the SAME for EVERYBODY, but now, homosexuals want to claim as \na \"right\" [sic] that which nature has denied them (hence the imposing of a \nfundamental RE-definition of marriage), is something that the vast majority \nhave never sought and have no rational reason to seek, and that the human \nrace simply does not need.

So, *where do these absolutes come from?*  *WHO \nor WHAT is your moral standard?*  (You didn't answer any of the questions I \nasked previously.)\n\nP3: That is only if you assume the evolutionary worldview that you were \nbrought up to believe and indoctrinated with via the public education \nsystem.

Of course, the larger question \nis: What *IS* marriage?  *WHY* does it exist in the first place?  *HOW* \ndoes society benefit from it?  And can same-sex persons form a \ncomprehensive union at all, ever, or contribute to the institutions of \nmarriage and family *naturally*?  (The answer to both of those is a \nresounding 'no', hence the *imposed and fundamental, essentially \nmeaningless, dumbed-down, purely emotional REdefinition of marriage,* which \nmust be assumed at the outset, or your argument holds no water \nwhatsoever.)  (Your comments here failed to address anything I said \npreviously.)\nhttps://answersingenesis.org/is-the-bible-true/how-do-we-know-that-the-bible-is-true/\n\nP4: Actually, God established the institution of marriage in the book of \nGenesis, all the way back at the beginning.  Since then it has only \ndevolved.  (You again failed to address the issues raised or arguments \npresented.)\n\nP5: You think that marriage has evolved?  I would like to hear you make an \nargument for that...  (I think you are just being emotional and asserting \nthat which you could not possibly prove.)  And of course, marriage is not \nso silly that it is merely an emotional agreement between any two people.  \nYou don't actually know what marriage is or why it is important do you?  I \nbet you've never lifted a finger to investigate the matter at all.  What \nare you, just another homosexual individual who demands acceptance, who for \nsome, as of yet to be disclosed reason, believes his emotional partnership \nis equal to heterosexual unions\u2014despite the clear scientific and \nfundamental differences?  What is your argument?  (You can read most of \nmine, clearly explained, in the comments above.)\n\nP6: You haven't explained anything yet.  (And I don't believe you can.  At \nleast, not in a rational or consistent way.)  Which only demonstrates that \nyou are either wrong, or simply not up to the task.  The question is \nsimple: What IS marriage?

Can you tell me WHY marriage should be REdefined and how \nthat benefits society as a whole?",

The fact that men and women hold the potential for \nprocreation as a matter of principle is one of the core reasons that \nmarriage is important.  Homosexual sexual relations are deviant \n(scientifically speaking) and are sterile by definition (which means that \ngay adoptions not only violate the natural born rights of children to a \nmother and father, but it means that homosexuals are claiming as a right \nthat which nature has denied them).

If you actually \ndiscuss the issues, perhaps you could persuade me to see things \ndifferently?  You won\u2019t know unless you try!\n3.) Looking out for the best interest, long term, for society, men, woman, \nand children is caring.

Marriage allows gay people to protect the lives they build \ntogether. It allows them to inherit their partner's share of the estate \nwithout being taxed to death (civil unions don't provide that). They can \nget onto each other's health insurance and file taxes together (which is a \nhuge savings, in many cases). Civil unions don't allow for partners to file \ntaxes together. Marriage allows homosexuals the right to make decisions for \ntheir partner when that person can no longer make decisions for them self, \nbecause of failed health or being injured in an accident. It allows them to \nbe with their partner (in a hospital setting) without being asked to leave \nor having to fight about it with their partner's homophobic family. The \nargument is this...if GAY people are made to pay the same taxes and follow \nthe same laws as everyone else--then they should be given the same rights. \nThe argument that won this debate and will make gay marriage legal in all \n50 states very soon...is that it's unconstitutional to discriminate against \na person based on their gender or sexual orientation. Marriage is not a \nreligious union (unless you make it one) it's a civil union. You don't get \ndivorced in a church, you divorce in court...so the argument that it's for \nreligious reasons or procreation (only) is ridiculous. Neither of those \nsituations are the case in MANY heterosexual marriages. People \nevolve...it's the way of the world. Just like slavery had to go...so did \ndiscriminating against homosexuals. I think it makes the world a much \nbetter place. Celebrating and supporting LOVE is much better than dwelling \non who to hate, discriminate against, or treat badly just because we don't \npersonally agree with them (based on religious beliefs, morals, etc.). Love \nfrees us. It makes us better. I for one, am ready to celebrate the good in \nothers and leave the nastiness behind. Life is too short to be a hateful \nbigot with prehistoric ideas. The main argument here...We have learned too \nmuch to be ignorant any longer. We have evolved. We are different. You will \nprobably say that's not a good thing...I disagree. When we allow others to \nflourish, we flourish with them. Holding people down is wrong. Besides...if \nyou don't agree with gay marriage you always have the right not to be in \none. Right?

Proof \nOdin exists.\nPlease tell me exactly where in the bible they mention the Higgs Boson, \nnon-locality or the Heisenberg uncertainty principle? All predictions made \nby science and then later proven. John Michell's 1783 Paper predicted the \nexistence of black holes and in 1970 the first black hole was discovered.\nHailey\u2019s Comet was first predicted by English astronomer Edmond Halley by \napplying Isaac Newton\u2019s Theories of Planetary motion. He predicted it would \ncome on 25 December 1758, and even pinpointed exactly the time of day and \nlocation in the sky that it would be seen. Unfortunately he died in 1742 so \nhe never learned that he was correct. Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist \nfrom the late nineteenth century, predicted the modern-day periodic table \nnearly perfectly. When he began his research in 1863, scientists only knew \nabout 60 or so elements. We've since discovered more than 40 more. By \norganizing elements' atomic weight and various properties, Mendeleev \nstarted to see patterns. He noted the gaps in the table and predicted \nelements that would likely fill them. The planet Neptune was mathematically \npredicted by studying fluctuations in Uranus\u2019 orbit before it was directly \nobserved. With a prediction by Urbain Le Verrier, telescopic observations \nconfirming the existence of a major planet were made on the night of \nSeptember 23\u201324, 1846.\n\nI could go on for days. The problem is that you are exquisitely ignorant in \nthe process of science or the history. Science is not a \u201cthing\u201d, it is not \na noun. It is a VERB. It is the process of observation and falsifiable \nhypothesis we go through to understand the universe.  \n\n\"Perhaps the older fables were just twisted copies of oral telling's of the \nvery stories of the Hebrew people.\u201d\nPerhaps they are, in the same way that King Arthur or Robin Hood or even \nJesus are loosely based on historical figures or amalgamations of figures.\n*You have to realize that just by admitting that these stories could be \ntwisted copies of oral histories, you are admitting that the bible is \nfalsifiable, and if it is falsifiable then it\u2019s more rational to understand \nthe bible as parable and not the true word of god because the true word of \ngod cannot be falsifiable* ",

The evidence is incompatible and thus not evidence.\nIf the Egyptians can write about the virgin birth of Horus the Sun God and \nthen thousands of years later, christians can write about the virgin birth \nof Jesus the Son *of* God, then something is wrong.\nHow do you rationalize this?\n\nA book cannot be the true word of god if it gets its facts wrong. What it \nshows is that the OT and NT are collections of much older myths, changed by \ntime and retelling. Twisted to fit an agenda and a narrative. Written and \nedited by many fallible humans and translated from dead languages.\nAnd if this book is not the true word of god, then it leaves science to \nanswer the age of the earth, the history of creation and where life came \nfrom... but hey, it already has.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve offered me is not evidence or proof. It is some opinions \nthat've been twisted and shoehorned to fit an agenda. Science doesn\u2019t need \nto do this. Science discovers universal laws and uses them to make \npredictions.

May I point out to those here who are \ndisparaging against Christianity that the VAST majority of Christians \nregard homosexuals as no different from anyone else, and should be loved \nand respected. The bottom line is that all the research over the last 50 \nyears has shown that homosexuality is not simply a lifestyle choice, but \nhomosexuals are born with that propensity which shows up, as does \nheterosexuality, only at puberty.\n\nThis begs the question as to how a God of love can allow millions to be \nborn in HIS image, and has, as their creator, created millions of people \nhomosexual from birth, only to then condemn them for honouring the \nsexuality that he gave them in the first place. Caudle has NEVER managed to \nexplain this.\n\nCaudle always brings up the same 'Biblical' passages claiming how \nhomosexuality is a 'sin' but after months of debate with me, as a \nheterosexual Christian minister, with a pretty good working knowledge of \nbiblical Greek and Hebrew, he has been backed into a corner over and over, \nby those same passages properly read.\n\nThose here with whom this guy has attempted to argue need to be told in no \nuncertain terms that he needs more pity than argument - but also needs to \nbe shown clearly and decisively, in love, that he is being prejudiced in \nthe extreme, and not honouring to the God in whom he professes a faith.\ufeff",

Love bears all things, believes all things, \nhopes all things, endures all things. \n\nWhat you have described that your family does to this brothers son is not \nLove.

You are \ndoing nothing more than what the Pharisee's did by tying up heavy burdens \nthat a person can't carry and neither will you carry them yourself. Jesus \nsaid, focus on your own sin.\n\nI have checked out my Bible. Corinthians is speaking out against Pederasty, \nRomans 1 is a letter about the Romans and their pagan idolatry rituals. \nLeviticus is the exact same thing. Read the verse before 18:22 and after. \nThe verse before is about sacrificing your children to Molek and after is \nabout worshiping beast. Thats why it says if a woman stand before a beast \nto lie down with it. Think of the Golden Calf at mount Sinai. These verses \nare about Idolatry and in the Hebrew text it uses the word To'evah which \nmeans in reference to God \"Holy One\" and in reference to anything but God \nit means idolatry. It specifically says idolatry in all 3 of these verses. \nLeviticus is talking about fertility rituals in idolistic practices.\n\nThe bible does not condemn homosexuals but specific homosexual activities \nconducted thousands of years ago. No different than the bible condemns \ncertain heterosexual activities. You can not use the condemnation of \ncertain heterosexual activities as a ban against heterosexuality nor can \nyou use a ban on certain homosexual activities as a ban on homosexuality.\n\n\nJust because a Pope holds to bad doctrine does not make it true.
