Or were you \ntoo young to get out yet?\nAnyway, I was amazed that something that looked so nice and sporty cost \nonly about $150. Some zit-faced counter kid saw me pause to look at them \nand he said something along the lines of, \"You don't want to buy one of \nthose.\"\nHere's a salesman for them, telling me not to buy one! Now, THAT'S bad! \nI, personally have had the mis-pleasure of working on Chink Shit in my 41 \nyear long career as a mechanic. Some are Honda Industrial GX-series clones. \nLook just like the Hondas but there's a difference.\nWhat some major companies do/did and in Honda's case, they'd sell China \ntheir old stampings, casting molds and dies...after they'd wear out. \nReally! I was a Honda engine distributor for over 15 years. Also an \nauthorized warranty/repair dealership for same. I'm not some idiotic \nYouTube Commando making shit up as  go along as you do, kid.\nYes, you could spend $425 for a Honda GX160 from me or pay $59 for a \nChinky-Dink clone through Harbor Freight (with coupon) Which one's gonna \nlast longer? I have a real GX160 on my wood splitter I bought used in 2000 \nand the fucker keeps going. Of course, I service it being I'm smart and all.\n\nIf these CycleJerks bikes were actually a top quality bike, I'd refer to \nthem as \"Communist China Quality, Slave-Labor Produced Motorcycles\" but \nthey're not.\nSo, they're \"Chink Shit\", you fucking Dink!\n\nYou should have known. \n\nAnybody else up for a severe mocking?",
