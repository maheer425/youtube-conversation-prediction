I understand feeling like u need to be a woman \nif ur behaviors and likes fit a gender that society forces on us. Its the \nonly way they can function. U know how much it sucks being a guy and liking \n\"girly\" things while being STRAIGHT. its hard. We need to rid the idea of \ngender roles. We already are meshing. Women and men are becoming a queer \nunisex nation and once we do. gender reassignment will not ever be an issue \nagain.

Here is \nanother truth: we have all been taught different truths. Here is one more \ntruth: the human mind and the human body is a complicated place, and origin \ntales or gender binary myths are not enough to explain most human \nexperiences. Most of us conform and interpret these truths so that we can \nmerge with the world that we perceive.\n\nThis can be seen in how we represent ourselves as that is how we confirm in \nour heads that we are what we are supposed to be. The mind and the body \ncollaborate to perpetuate these truths. However, some people are born so \ndifferent that they cannot interpret the truth to assimilate and the \nacceptable forms of self-representations contradict who they actually are. \nThere is no room for compromise.\n\n These people threaten the rest of the world because they stand as proof \nthat the truth that we have believed as being carved in stone and absolute \nare actually not what they appear to be. After which we are left with two \noptions: de-construct and re-construct our beliefs, which is harder but \nwill result in less human casualties, or vilify and systematically \nmarginalize the people who do not adhere, which is easy but can result in \nas many casualties as millions. \nYou must be wondering why I can empathize with Karissa. Well, I am a \nTibetan refugee living in NYC. I know a thing or two about what it is like \nto be so different that you cannot even assimilate. This is when \nassimilation comes at the cost of your most truest self. I fall under the \ncategory of illegal immigrants, sweatshop workers, sex workers, trans \npeople etc.. People the world wishes didn't exist. The world would like to \nignore us and they do, but doesn't mean we stop happening. And here is the \nbiggest truth of all: We are as real as you. The less you dismiss us as \naccidents, problem-creators, liars, villains, etc, better the world will \nget for everyone. And....the more you will understand yourself. \nAnd I think, you need to engage in a dialogue with yourself. Ask yourself \nwho you are and what you believe in instead of what you would like to \nbelieve in and what you have been taught to believe. What do you aspire to \nbe and does the person that you aspire to be hurt other people? \n\nIf you are a person who enjoys hurting people then ignore everything that I \nhave said thus far.",

            "text": "An excellent TED-Talk!  The equivalent of Star trek space exploration is \ngoing to be about the body's control through DNA... apparently, our DNA is \nnot our destiny as a biological beings. I'm sure glad to learn that.  The \nmedical community is quickly learning how \"nature\" (our DNA) predisposes \neach of us to certain diseases like breast cancer.  I'm grateful for that, \nbut I am  especially interested in exploring how epigenetics predisposes us \nto certian behavior and attraction which believing in evolution, likely \nenhanced survival of the species.  That will be a bold frontier in \npsychology and evolutionary science. I read elsewhere that a research study \nof close best friends showed a remarkable finding, they shared 1% of the \nidentical DNA, making them like 4th cousins or great grand parents.  Beside \nthis remarkable findings, it became apparent that the shared DNA caused \nthese best friends to be attracted to similar smells.  The remaining 99% of \ntheir DNA however, was very dissimilar, more dissimilar than when compared \nto non-best friend strangers.  Having dissimilar DNA means these best \nfriends will not be equally vulnerable to the same diseases.  So, DNA \nguides us to choose best friends who are likely to be resistant to diseases \nwe are vulnerable to, so they can take care of us when we're sick. Is that \nnot cool?  How much is human attraction programmed in humans through DNA as \nopposed to resulting from learned experiences teaching critical choice of \ncharacter?  Epigenetics may also explain what gives rise to transgender \npeople's gender dysphoria, usually signs of such being evident as earl as \ntoddlers choosing how to play,   That nurture side means our emotional life \nexperience, our environment (starting in the womb, then in life as \npollution, diet, etc), and maybe hormones.  It appear that nurture can \nmodify the expression of DNA (epigenetics) even of DNA structure does not \nchange.  This is an exciting aspect of being human that I am eager for \nscience to explore. The intellectual prowess of scientist Dr. Karissa \nSanbonmatsu is likely an aspect of her own self awareness. Her courage to \nspeak out as a transgender woman in this TED-talk probably reflects the \ncourage needed in the mind of a research scientist who must exercise \nindependent thought, sometimes critical of other scientists who insist that \nthe research community drinks their collegial cool-aid of group thinking, \nstatus quo scientific knowledge.  Perhaps the idea of DNA's programming \ntransitioning through epigenetics was easier for her to believe than for \nnon-transgender scientists stuck in a \"We can't change our DNA\" frame of \nthinking, True, we can't change our DNA structure, but we can change which \nDNA expresses itself, just as a rail switchman can't change the rail yard \ntracks, but can change where a train goes by throwing a switch,    I'm \nimpressed, and want to hear more!\ufeff",

I had, in fact, recently \nbecome convinced that I would never be accepted as my authentic, actual \nself, due in part to an apparent lack of solid scientific evidence that \ntransgenderism is not a choice.

I saw the images from the probe and from that moment, I knew \nthat space was all I ever wanted to do with my life.  I still remember \neverything about that moment.  I was in the Navy, in Miami, and I was on \nwatch.  It was about 9:00 in the evening and I was on an eternal hold \nwaiting for a painfully pointless conference call when the link popped up \nin my facebook feed.\n\nHanging in with the family...  Right now I need to keep my family close in \ncase I need to move back in with them after school.  But I'm about this \nclose to being completely done with them after that.  Seriously, I don't \nneed this from them.\n\nIt's great that the job market is becoming more accepting, but as yet I'm \nnot aware of any specific instances of success in the aerospace industry. \n Boeing apparently has a very good transition program for existing \nemployees.  Nominally, so does Lockheed Martin, but I know at least one \nLockheed employee who was fired soon after her coming out.  Getting in the \ndoor is what concerns me, since in the end, it's all about the impression \nyou leave with a person.  The company can say \"great transgender health \nbenefits\" all day long, but if the hiring manager doesn't like transgender \npeople, it's so easy for them to think of some BS but legitimate sounding \nreason for passing over them, up to and including \"I just didn't think they \nwere the right person for the job.\" That's my fear, anyway.  I went to the \nschool's career fair last year and the reception I got there wasn't \nnegative.  Surprise, confusion, clearly put them off of their cadence.  No \njob, though.  Which is more a function of it being my first semester there \nthan anything else.  The school is really bad about bringing in commercial \nspace companies, though.  This year we had Orbital Sciences.  That's it. \n Boeing showed up, but they weren't hiring for commercial space.  Only aero \nengineering majors and business types.

Your snippity comments and snide remarks and your phony-ass \"i'm \njust trying to question things and understand\" schtick is weak as shit.  \nwhat are you, eleven?

How often has someone you know misconstrued something you said \nor did, unbeknownst to you?  Here is an example of an identity \"crisis\" if \nyou will.  Her internal identity is a female, and I am sure that it always \nhas been.  Her external identity was as a male.  Your (Not Sure's) internal \nidentity, I imagine is male, and your external identity is male.  Your \ninternal and external identities are in harmony with each other, thus you \nhave no identity crisis.  In the case of Carissa and millions of other \nnon-cisgendered people, these two dichotomies are in endless conflict, and \nneed to be unified through surgery.  However the obvious physical \ndifferences are often mocked and denigrated by ignorant, hateful bigots \nlike you.",
