This entire pone is about EVERYONE. \nIt's dissing the society we live in, the society that says that women \nshould be beautiful and thin and sweet and caring, and that men should be \nmuscular and proud and tall. And I have no idea why anyone is taking this \nthe wrong way. The comments that say bull like, \"easy for you to say, \nyou're tall, skinny beautiful, blah blah blah.\" Everyone has insecurities, \nit's not only the people that aren't super skinny, or tall or any of that \ncrap. Even the most gorgeous person has flaws. But if I say that I think \nI'm pretty, words and insults shoot me down. What's wrong with being \nconfident? So everyone is saying believe in yourself, love yourself, but \nthe second I say I'm pretty, I'm called narcissistic, egotistical, ugly. \nAll to bring my confidence down. This poem is beautiful and god dammit stop \nhating, because really, what's the point huh? I've had super low self \nesteem all my life, but now, who gives a shit? \ufeff",

It's sad \nthat they can't be more like me and be perfectly happy on their own without \na need to belong to \"someone\" and look nice \"for someone\". Feminism need to \npoint out more that women don't need men and don't have to look good for \nsome stranger. My advice; just do your own thing and you'll just be so much \nhappier. Life as a single with some good sex here and there is a perfectly \nvalid option that I recommend. No extra strings attached.

It honestly wasn't any better than the way you describe having \na small chest. I felt really dowdy and unattractive because I couldn't wear \nthe types of clothes that were popular with other twelve-year-old girls. \nMoreover, I didn't really know how to dress for my body type because I had \ndeveloped so quickly, so my sense of style was less than flattering, and my \npeers didn't let me forget it. I was once told by a girl that her friend \nwould have liked me better if I knew how to dress myself. That stung. In \nanother instance, I remember meeting another girl my age who was also an \nearly bloomer. The thing was, she was a horrible person with discipline \nproblems, and she would go around harassing and even hitting the rest of \nus. I remember at one point she and I were standing in front of the sinks \nin the washroom, washing our hands, and I noticed how similar our bodies \nlooked, and it was the first time in my life that I /hated/ my body. Not \njust a casual \"Oh, I'm not that pretty, I wish I looked different,\" but a \nfull-out loathing that I had a large chest. Throughout all my teenage years \nI felt that I could be so much more attractive if I had a smaller chest, \nthat I'd be able to wear the clothes that I liked without embarrassing \nmyself. It wasn't until I was an adult that I finally came to terms with \nit, and I certainly don't hate my chest. I've also learned to dress in \nstyles that (I think) look good on me. I still have times when I think \"Oh, \nthat's a really nice top, if only I had smaller breasts so I could wear it \nnicely,\" but it's more of a minor annoyance now, rather than a full-out \nself-esteem shattering feeling.\ufeff",
