You could strike sparks \nanywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing \nwas hilarious, that we were having fun. And that, I think, was the handle. \nThat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of boredom and lolcows. \nNot in any upright or kind sense, we didn't need that. Our lulz would \nsimply prevail.

I watched Fear and Loathing hundreds of \ntimes, Easy Rider, a truck load of movies from that time and about that \ntime (my favorite documentary was The Drug Years on VH1, even recorded it \non tape and watched just the 60's part over and over). I listened to Pink \nFloyd's first album more times than I can count, had a compilation CD my \ndad gave me with all the 60's hits, including San Francisco, and I'd groove \nby myself like an idiot in my room.\nSadly though, when you're that young getting stoned by yourself you're left \nto imagine that it was some kind of druggy fairyland where everything was \npeace, love, free sex and good music, but it was bad. There were riots, \nrace problems, gay and lesbian people were being electrocuted in the brain \nfor their \"sickness\", it wasn't all sunshine  and love. Poverty, political \nproblems, it doesn't seem much different than it is today, especially when \nwe have all these horrible things happen in other countries, and in our \ncountry you hear about shootings happening more and more. I think people \nwho wished to live in the 60's just need to remember that, but at the same \ntime, time is only time. Who says we can't have our little 60's moment now? \nWho says it isn't happening now? Why not make the 2010's OUR sixties? The \nsixties were run by people who let loose and tried to loosen their \nconstraints that their fathers and mothers administered in the 50's, we can \ndo the same thing. The 90's had that same kind of free feeling when grunge \ncame to be, but it wasn't much of an impacting decade as the 60's, so maybe \nwe still have a chance. You never know.\ufeff",

Of course, the blame is both on \nthose who participated in the drug culture and those who fought against it. \nThompson is arguing that the media is paying more attention to a phony drug \nwar rather than the war in Vietnam and American protests against it.  The \ninspiration for Fear and Loathing is the wrongful assassination of a \nMexican-American journalist reporting on protests of the Vietnam War. Drugs \nis the vehicle through which Thompson uses to demonstrate the blindness \nsuffered by the victims of the Leary era. Violence occurs all around \nhim--someone ran over by a car, a woman decapitated, bombs falling on \nVietnam--and yet it always plays in the background.

Proclaiming this as the thesis of the overall \nfilm, I think, is inaccurate on my part. The scene is an elegiac \nreflection, and uncovering the heart of the film requires more \ncontextualization than what's provided in this scene, although the lines \nare beautifully composed. Ultimately, I do view the scene as a critique \nbecause Thompson emphasizes a trust in invincibility as the crux of the \nzeitgeist, and when he utters the final line, \"less than five years \nlater...the high water mark,\" he's draws attention to how little time has \npassed since America has moved on into the 1970's. This undermines his \nprevious emphasis on invincibility and \"winning,\" and moreover, the line \n\"it requires the right kind of eyes\" indicates that the zeitgeist has \nended. My idea of what lies at the heart of the film is contextualized by \nother scenes -- including his commentary on people crippled by the 1960's \nand Timothy Leary. I'm not sure that I would agree with my earlier \nstatement that the films is offering drugs as the reason for our blindness \nto violence, but I would say that violence is relegated to the background \nwith intention. I would simply offer that Thompson feels frustrated with \nthe current state of American society, including Vietnam and its reportage, \nand he mourns the feeling, even if it was ideologically unsound and \ndrug-induced, that we could overcome injustice.

Maybe is just \ninterpretation to fit our personal beliefs but I see the presence of \nThomson as an icon of Heidegger's existentialist and full aware and alive \nbeing.

I don't mean \nyou're wrong, I'm just saying that what you put as main ideas of the movie \nare actually a casual setup that could have been completely different with \nthe symbolic adventure being the same: passion for true life and true \nliving.",
