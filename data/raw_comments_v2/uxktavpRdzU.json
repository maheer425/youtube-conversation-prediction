I can't concentrate \nwell, nothing gets to my head and it frustrates me that no matter how hard \nI try I can't be as productive as I was. I started hearing voices and I \nassume it as another part of me blaming and 'self-bullying' myself and I \nfeel guilty. And all I can do is cry when I hear them and my body will \nstart to react with gastritis and vomiting and painful dizziness. My \nparents sent me to a psychologist and they said it was psychosomatic. I \nhate going to there because I'll have to talk about it and I'll start \nmeeting 'her' again and hear 'her' again. All I do now is lock myself in my \nroom and watch shows, i hate meeting people, i lack emotion and motivation, \nand sessions with my psychologist isn't really going well bcs i can't \nexpress myself. I just wanted to know if I have schizophrenia? I hope not, \ni'd hate that a lot.\ufeff",

I wonder how much he actually made research on actual \ndissociative disorder sufferers. We're not a bunch of liars - also not that \nsmall of a bunch - it's more common than schitzophrenia but not as \nresearched, and definitely not as treated. Elusive it may be, but that's \nthe nature of dissociation - it's mostly an inner issue, even on the DID \nend of the spectrum.

Hearing myself hitting the \ngolf ball before I actually hit it... feeling overwhelming certainty that i \nknew certain events were going to take place before they did, always random \nand unpredictable things like seeing a shooting star, turning on the radio \nand singing the song in my head before, etc.. this is extremely simple to \nexplain and fix) i went from a split at least once a week for several years \nto zero in the past 4, and immediately curtailed the annoying lingering \nsymptoms like constant blinking and speech fragmentation. I can explain why \nsome people are right handed in one identity and left in the other, and why \nsome 40 percent of subjects who develop dissociative identity disorder are \nleft handed... if any one cares to pick my brain. I can't and would never \nclaim these same exercises will cure or even help anyone - I am not a \ndoctor, but it certainly won't hurt someone who is suffering this \nunfortunate disorder to give it a try, i've made sure of that by consulting \nmultiple neurologists and psychiatrists, otherwise i would never post this. \nSometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one - most extremely \nspecific, peculiar disorders are eventually traced to a very simple causal \nmechanism, this particular one simply hasn't been solved. Hope this helps \nat least someone.\ufeff",

Before he even took the trip I started to notice some \nweird things about him, and just a few weeks before he left the country to \ngo visit her he told me a mutual friend of us had called him from his \ngirlfriends phone and taunted him saying he had sex with her before he even \nhad the chance to meet her.\nHe refused to believe that this friend never left the country, even after \nwe showed him evidence supporting the claim. He even created a secondary \ntheory on how it was possible to get to this country from another country, \njust to hide the fact that this friend had visited his girlfriend only to \nmess with him. I managed to talk him into go visit his girlfriend and that \nhe would feel better after seeing her, and that it was only his deep fear \nof loosing her that made his mind play tricks on him (in hindsight this was \nprobably a bad call by me, but I really thought that would help him).\nWhen he was there, I talked to him over the phone, and all seemed well. \nHowever, upon his return to our country I quickly realized that things had \ntaken a turn for the worse. He now told me that the first thing that \nhappened when he arrived in the country, someone had put a rag of \nchloroform in front of his face, subdued him and kept him prisoner. They \nmade him make calls to assure us that everything was alright despite the \nopposite being true. He claimed he only got to see his girlfriend for a few \ndays, despite having stayed in the country for a month. He had however \nconvinced his girlfriend to come visit our country, he even payed for her \nflight. He claimed he managed to escape from captivity because of his \ntraining (he was pretty fit and a great marshal arts expert).\n\nA month later his girlfriend arrived, and all was well. I visited once \nwhile she was here, so did most of his other friends, so as to not disturb \nthem too much while they enjoyed their limited time together while she \nstayed in our country. Upon her departure from the country however, things \nstarted to crumble again. Now he was accusing every friend left and right \n(except me... at first) of having slept with his girlfriend while she was \nin our country. Not only had we done this, but we had also done this while \nhe was unconscious due to them either slipping something in his drink, \nusing chloroform or some other method to subdue him. He claimed that the \ndrugs did not entirely work as intended, and that he was semi-conscious \nduring this, and that was part of our plan because we wanted to taunt him \nwhilst we where doing his girlfriend in front of him. One by one he stopped \nhaving contact with us, I was actually the last one of his friends to have \ncontact with him. \n\nThen several months later I receive a phone from my friend, he tells me \nthat he knows I never did anything to him or his girlfriend, but that he \nnow was afraid of his life because those guys who had kidnapped him had set \noff the charge they had planted in his brain (Mission Impossible style \nbomb), but the bomb had not detonated properly and they were now on their \nway to his cabin to finish the job. He also said not to worry because he \nhad armed himself with a shotgun and loads of shells, and he was now \nsitting on the roof of his cabin. After we hung up, I quickly called his \nsister to tell her about the situation, she told me she already knew about \nit, and that the police force, or rather the \"SWAT\"-like forces were on \ntheir way after she had reported it. I panicked when I heard this, knowing \nhe was expecting someone armed to come for him, and he himself was armed \nand ready to kill whoever showed up to \"kill him\". I called the police, \ntold them the story. Luckily, there was no drama in disarming him, and no \none got hurt. His shotgun did not have all the parts (I think the firing \npin or something was out, I don't know firearms that well so don't quote me \non that) for him to be able to fire, and he had surrendered to the police \npretty quickly.\n\nThis is probably 5 years ago now, and I've never heard from him since. He \nwas my best friend and now he won't have anything to do with any of his \nfriends from before that incident. His sister told me that he still talks \nabout me in a positive way, but he still has a feeling that I had sex with \nhis girlfriend, and he also thinks that about all his male acquaintances, \neven his own father. Last I heard, he lives in the cabin where he got \narrested, only going out in the society when he buys food.\n\nI think that is a case of schizophrenia, but please tell me if I'm wrong, \ncause after all this, I find psychology both fascinating and depressing... \nI still really miss my friend, we had some great times together... \ufeff",
