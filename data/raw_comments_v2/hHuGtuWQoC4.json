But the \nmajor problem is that junglers in general don't gain much gold compared to \nthe laners, and all the items listed above might seem too pricey, therefore \nslowing up her build speed when her early-mid game is her best phase. \nFor a safe build that would be most ideal for ranked would be going \ntank-like after upgrading the warrior enhancement. I go 21/9/0, Flat AP \nglyphs and quints with armor seals and flat AD marks for early game \njungling and higher starting power.\nAP assassin eve was definitely fun in season 3 with her E being magic \ndamage with DFG proc. But now her her standing position is weak due to the \nexistence of much better assassins, going full tank would be most ideal for \nher.\nNot to mention tank eve manages out skirmishes safe even by forcibly \ninitiating the teamfight.",
