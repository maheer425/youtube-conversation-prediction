For example, after the first \niteration, we have an L shape. If you rotate the L so you have something \nlike _I then stick the ends together (with the rotated version on top) \nyou'll get\n_I\nL\nwhich is the \"saucepan\", second iteration. \nNow, this shows that in the (n+1)th iteration, we get a duplicate of the \nnth iteration (but rotated), then the nth iteration. So, if you take the \npattern for the nth iteration and rotate it, you actually get the BACKWARDS \npattern, and you SWITCH all the valleys and peaks. So, if we have PVV, then \nthe rotated pattern will be PPV.\nTo conclude, take the pattern for the nth iteration. Write it backwards and \nswitch the letters. Then add in a V (because to get from the nth to the \n(n+1)th iteration you have to fold it inwards) then write down the pattern \nfor the nth.\nFor example, the 2nd iteration has pattern PVV. Therefore the 3rd iteration \nwill have pattern PPV, then V, then PVV, so we obtain PPVVPVV. For the \nfourth iteration:\nWrite the 3rd backwards: VVPVVPP\nSwitch letters: PPVPPVV\nAdd a V: PPVPPVVV\nConcatenate with the original 3rd: PPVPPVVVPPVVPVV.\n\nRepeat!\n\nSorry the explanation is poor.
