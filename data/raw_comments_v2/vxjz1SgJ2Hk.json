But if one dares to say that men \nhave any problems at all, tons of feminists will immediately call you a \nmisogynist. I agree that women are victims of sexism, but I tend do think \nmen's problems are largely ignored. I would actually really appreciate some \ninput from you.\n\nSide note: My girlfriend is MtF and as a guy in the public eye, she was \ntreated very badly on the internet (mostly on pages where there's many \nwomen and very few men).

This is something that affected so many of your viewers \nin a very real and very difficult-to-deal-wtih way this year, whether they \nwere victims themselves or merely having to come to terms with finding out \nsome of their favourite and most trusted icons are scumbags. Your \nviewership is, on the whole, very young, and they've looked to older \nYouTube content creators to give them an idea of how to react to this \nsituation (and honestly I think as a whole the vlogbrothers' response on \nYouTube itself has been minimal, although I know you made some tumblr \nposts).\nWith more abuse coming to light every few months or even weeks, we need to \nkeep talking about this, and I think it's a shame you haven't publicly done \nso yet. I mean, focusing on the positives here - the community HAS become \nstronger, and people HAVE stood by the victims, and conventions HAVE become \nsafer, including VidCon! Your convention! Talk about that! And I see the \n\"Sam Pepper Exposed\" video in your playlist which, yes, is a great video, \nand talks about some very important topics related to sexual harassment.and \nassault, does focus more on the prank assaults rather than the private \nabuse that went on (and was covered up) for YEARS by many more people than \njust Pepper. Anyway, just my two cents, and I'm not sure how likely it is \nyou'll see this - and maybe it's unrealistic to think you'll be making a \nvideo about this any time soon, as it seems clear that the vlogbrothers and \nmost other \"respected\" channels seem keen to move on from all this \nuncomfortable talk about scandals. But I'm... Not gonna stop asking why \nthere have been so few videos about this on major channels.Anyway. Happy \nnew year!\ufeff",
