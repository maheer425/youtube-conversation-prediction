South of France is known for its Italian \ninfluence in architecture & food. I got a job in a small pizzeria where I \nstarted as a busboy, later becoming a head chef. It was there I met my \neventual lover, Gastone. He was my assistant chef. In a pizza contest, we \nwere voted best chefs in South France and won with our Margherita Pizza. We \nlived a fantastic, exciting lifestyle, full of adventure over the next \nyear; the nightlife was especially fantastic, filled with handsome \nFrenchmen we has come to know very well. Nowhere in the world was there a \nmore free place for homosexuals than the French nightlife; A place where I \nfelt I belonged. Gastone and I were a happy couple. Tragically, things took \na turn for the worst. We lost the pizza contest the next year, but that was \njust the beginning. I came to work early one morning & was greeted by the \nsmell of pizza. Except it wasn't really pizza! It was Gastone in the oven; \nhis mutilated body burnt to a crisp, covered in cheese. It was depressing. \nI had lost a lover & after a short time, I returned to my home in Germany. \nI've since reverted to being straight. To this day, I have a phobia of \npizza & when I smell it, all I can smell is the charred body of Gastone.\nHomosexuality is not welcomed in this world. Everyone should do as I did \nand accept that hard reality. It will only cause you pain if you don't... \njust as it did for me.\ufeff",

Using his Youtube views as a proxy for people's distrust in mainstream \nmedia and as an indicator of people turning to TYT for truth in reporting \nreal news.  Example.. \"We've got over 1 billion views on YT because no \nlonger trust mainstream media to report the truth.  Whereas the truth is \nmore like TYT spams Youtube with thousands of videos, but gets the majority \nof their views from the ones dealing with pop culture or TMZ/National \nEnquirer type stories, many of which contain salacious or misleading \ntitles/thumbnails. \n2. \"George Bush won the disputed 2004 election because his cousin worked \nfor Fox News and called the results first.  All the other news stations \ndidn't want to be late, so therefore, they immediately repeated this \ndeclaration\".  \n3. \"The USA has the lowest corporate tax rate among OECD countries.\"\n4. His self serving and biased account of how he \"quit\" MSNBC, because his \nbosses wanted to silence him.\n5. \"Mainstream media calls everything right down the middle.  GOP says \nthis, Dems say this.\" \n6. Even his signature calling about getting money out of politics is laced \nwith half truths.  Most people, including myself agree that money should \nnot corrupt politics, so I agree with the intent.  But to back his \nposition, he quotes \"facts\" about \"x\" percentage of the time, the candidate \nwith the highest fundraising wins the election.  He says this and all \nimpressionable TYT viewers thinks he's got a point.  But Cenk never raises \nthe well known principle that money doesn't just influence the winner, but \nthat it follows the winner.  Meaning, if a candidate is going to win, even \nby a landslide, a donor will still donate money to that candiate for \npossibly future access.  That doesn't mean the money helps determine the \nwinner.  Sure, the money might still be intended for less than noble \nreasons in the future, but the point is it doesn't determine the winner.  \nThe fact Cenk never points that out, or that TYT vierwers can never figure \nthis out is infuriating, although not unexpected.",
