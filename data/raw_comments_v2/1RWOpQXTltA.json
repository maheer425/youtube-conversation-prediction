I took several pictures and turned that into a Power \nPoint Presentation. I use this presentation to show my students the \ndifference between perception and truth. I take them through the story as \nthe video here does and at the end I ask my students, what character(s) do \nyou think you are? Then, I ask, what character(s) do you think I am? The \nstudents reply by saying that they are the two other prisoners chained to \nthe rocks and that I am the one that was freed and saw all the new stuff. I \ndo this because I teach in an inner city school where the students don't or \nwon't believe my or other teachers when we say that education is important. \nThey feel that they can just get by with a D and it will be OK. Without \ngoing into the many reasons for this, I feel that I am able to connect with \nmy students and they still don't fully believe me. This is a human response \nto all aspects of social life, which is why we still discuss this allegory \ntoday. The intent or point of view needs to be amplified to a degree were \nthe person cannot make comparisons greater than the new information being \nshown. This means that the nascent information must be of greater mental \nvolume, greater affinity with other ideas, or have a higher mental \nresolution than opposing ideas. This is what had occurred with the prisoner \nthat was freed. To be able to transfer information in a believable manner \nthese three criteria must be included. I use Legos to teach scientific \nconcepts. It allow me to deliver a concept easily because there is a high \nmental resolution and a great affinity with other ideas that they already \nhave  or have been shown recently with videos or pictures. \ufeff",
