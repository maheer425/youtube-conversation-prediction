Although he does criticize Christianity \nrelentlessly and deems it \"the curse of humanity\", he nevertheless also \n recognizes it's contributions to culture. Nietzsche simply want so make \nthe value of all former values questionable, because humanity has now \nbecome aware of the fictionality of our previous values. Since we stand at \nthe doorstep of nihilism and our values have been rid of their metaphysical \norigin, we must ask \"what value do these values have\". In this sense, I \nwould say that Nietzsche seeks to question, which might lead to negation of \nsome values. I would advise you to be careful with your \nhegelian/dialectical analysis and interpretation of Nietzsche so as to \navoid the danger of making him something he is not, because you may feel \nsomewhat uncomfortable with his rejection of Christian ideals, and thus \nwish to see him as a philosopher of dialectical synthesis between the \nChristian ideals and the rejection of these ideals, motivated somewhat by \nthe desire to make him \"comfortable\" by obscuring him or projecting into \nhim some modes of thinking that he did not practice. Do not misunderstand \nme. Your strategy is interesting. There may be something there, but \nNietzsche does to some extent accept the fact that saying \"yes\" to things \nrequires saying \"no\" as well and this might entail rejection of \nChristianity as well.

            "text": "+Martin Kr\u00f8yer When it comes to the ubermensch as a dialectical process, \ninstead of as a goal in-and-of-itself, I would state that Nietzsche's \nthinking on the matter is not teleological once again. Again and again in \nNietzsche's writing the idea that humanity is a bridge and not a goal \nin-and-of-itself repeats regularly. The ubermensch is posited as a great \npromise, something still forming and strange, prophetic, a symbol of future \ncreative possibilities. In this matter, I believe, the reach of Nietzsche's \nantiteleologicality cannot be overstated. Since the ubermensch is the \nsolution to the problem of nihilism, here is a quote I believe higlights \nthe dynamic between the two:\n\n\"Nihilism then, is the recognition of the long waste of strength, the\nagony of the 'in vain', insecurity, the lack of any opportunity to\nrecover and regain composure - being ashamed in front of oneself, as\nif one had deceived oneself all too long. - This meaning could have been\nthe 'fulfilment' of some highest ethical canon in all events, the moral\nworld order; or the growth of love and harmony in the intercourse of\nbeings; or the gradual approximation of a state of universal happiness;\nor even the development toward a state of universal annihilation -\nany goal at least constitutes some meaning. What all these notions\nhave in common is that something is to be achieved through the process\n- and now one realizes that becoming aims at nothing and achieves\nnothing.\"\n\n- Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power 12A\n\nAs Nietzsche noted, humankind is an oddity among the animal kingdom in the \nsense that we occasionally need to be reminded of our need for purpose and \ngoal. Everything we do is defined by goal-orientated thinking. However, as \nNietzsche  noted above, the modern nihilism is based on the realization \nthat this way of perception is based on error and fiction and that in \nactuality, the becoming has no goal and achieves nothing. There is only the \nprocess. The scale of ubermensch's greatness is defined by his ability to \naccept this becoming without aim and exist in it as eternally rejoicing \nWill to Power, as part of Will to Power. He does not negate the world or \nturn into self-renunciation or nihilistic metaphysics. This also involves \naccepting the negative sides of existence and the \"underhuman\" in us as \nwell. I some sense, the ubermensch is not really about attaining some \nfuture state of transcended cognition, but rather about coming into terms \nwith our all too human flaws as well, as part of the aimless becoming \nitself (although in this case I would say taht Nietzsche's writing, once \nagain paradoxically, somewhat seems to waver between seeing the ubermensch \nas a new future state of being or as an affirmation of the present \ncondition). In any case, I would agree with you in this sense that the \nubermensch does not necessarily entail the dialectics of \nabsolute/anti-absolute, but is rather a mode of being in a becoming without \nfinal aims and the logic of absolute affirmation/negation (starngely, by \naffirming everything in existence, the ubermensch somewhat transcends the \ntypical logic of absolutes).\n\nI would however admit, that my reading of Hegel himself is non-existent and \nI only have the basic understanding of his philosophy, so it may be that I \ndo not fully grasp the finer nuances of your hegelian reading strategy, but \nI believe I understood you sufficiently.\n\nAs for the question of redeeming Nietzsche, personally I do not consider it \nmy \"duty\" to \"redeem\" Nietzsche, in sense of making him \"moral\" in the \nframework of modern morality and returning him to the fold. I am not \nconcerned with making him compatible with modern (or previous) morality by \nmodifying it according to \"moral\" standards, as if it's only a matter of \n\"correcting\" Nietzsche (of course, to some extent, one must do this if one \nwants to apply said philosophy to modernity. It's just a general principle \nfor guiding action for me). Nietzsche believed what he believed and that is \nwhat it is. I rather believe, that Nietzsche must be confronted with an \nattitude of openness and with some insecurity, instead of with an \npreordained goal of making him \"politically correct\" or with an attitude of \nconfronting him simply in order to vaccinate ones already existing \nbelief-system against him. Nietzsche should perhaps be considered as a \ngreat deconstructivist, a bold explorer and questioner, who opens up new \navenues of knowledge and horizons of questioning, with the goal of shaking \nthe foundations of humanity grown rotten and nihilistic, in order to lay a \nfoundation for new being and living. By these questions he allows us to \nexplore human agency in a new light (for an example, the \nsocial-historic-genealogical evolution of our frameworks of knowledge and \nunderstanding, the dynamics between society and the individual, the impact \nof natural physiology and evolution upon human thinking, the new cultural \nways of self-perception and self-affirmation in the epoch of nihilism etc). \nHe is a teacher of new attitudes, pedagogy of reading and style of being, \nwhile also making contributions on the field of new knowledge of \nself-understanding and insight of human society, morality and culture (his \nwriting is highly diverse in this sense). He wishes to cultivate a stronger \nhumanity, who does not suffer from the epoch of nihilism to a \nself-destructive end. I very much agree with Keith Ansell-Pearson (in an \nexcellent book \"Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker\" which I \nwould recommend to anyone interested in Nietzsche) when he writes about how \nwe should confront Nietzsche as the \"first perfect nihilist\":\n\n \"In coming to terms with his work\nwe find ourselves forced to ask, and Nietzsche encourages us to\nask, questions such as: was he so clever? Was he so wise? Did he\nwrite such brilliant books? Is he a destiny? The aim of\nNietzsche's thinking is not to create a new religion, but a new\nautonomy. What I would like to call 'an ethics of reading' lies\nat the centre of his pedagogy. Whenever we ask the question of\nNietzsche's identity - who is Nietzsche? What does he mean for\nus? - we are also asking after our own identity. It is in this sense\nthat the first perfect nihilist can truly instruct and provoke us.\nThrough an encounter with his philosophy we can come to a\ncomprehension of the signs - of descent and ascent, of sickness\nand health - of our age. In this way is it possible to 'go over'\n(iibergehen) Nietzsche, as we must.\nIn accordance with his deepest thinking, Nietzsche wants his readers to \nreceive him beyond good and evil. This does not mean that we are prohibited \nfrom criticising, or even rejecting,\nhis ideas. It does mean, however, that a reception of his work\nmust transcend the level of a simple 'yes' or 'no'. We must\nengage his work and confront its challenge, which is nothing less\nthan the challenge of thought and a challenge to think.\"",

            "text": "+ikosabre\nAs you noted, at the very end, that Nietzsche wasn't so much into just \nturning everything upside down than surpassing, going beyond, current \nvalues. This is for me a very dialectical reading of Nietzsche, the \nsynthesis of both the christian values and negation of these. I have to \nadmit I haven't read that much of Kaufmans readings of Nietzsche (though I \ndo realize they are 101 on the understanding of his philosophy) so maybe, \nin a very na\u00efve way, the \u00fcbermensch as a dialectical thinker (as you called \nit) could be as this very synthesis, or maybe in Hegels own terms, the \nconcrete followed after a double negation.\n\nNow, just to emphasize the importance of this stance, and maybe you will \nagree with me, that the \u00fcbermensch is not the negation of any absolute or \nany ideal, but that the \u00fcbermensch only reveals himself in a double \nnegation, that is to say, the \u00fcbermensch is an X, defined, not as a goal to \nobtain, but rather as a dialectical process. For if the \u00fcbermensch is to \nlive up to its potential, he must always define himself as this 'je ne sais \nquoi', a perspective towards absolutism and anti-absolutism. This is of \ncourse just quickly written down and this really isn't the media for this \nkind of discussion, but if you can follow through which lines I think.\n\nAnd truly noted, the tension which the \u00fcbermensch carries with him, is very \nheraclitian, if you remember/know his parable on the bow; harmony \nconstituted through chaos and inner turmoil.\n\n(Since Nietzsche saw consciousness as a surface, one might think of Freud \nand the unconscious, the link here is quite visible.)\n\nYou can kindda say that Nietzsche threw in a dynamite together with the \nrest of the established philosophy, closed the door and now it is up to us \nto pick up the pieces.\nAs such, I personally fear for the \u00fcbermensch in the nietzschean term, as \nhistory has already shown us what happens when people try to adopt an \n\u00fcbermensch attitude, but doesn't have the strength to carry it through. \nThis is the reason why I personally try to re-read and redeem Nietzsche, \nbecause he truly got something right, but was misused and misunderstood - \nit is not the (anti)moral framework of Nietzsche which is of primary \nconcern, but those who adopt it.\n\nYou did make some comments on it, but how do you see a redemption of \nNietzsche possible? This is not meant as a rejection of the paradoxical \nnature of the \u00fcbermensch, for humans as such are paradoxical, but rather \nhow do we come to terms with a concept that both rejects the absolute \njudeo-christian ideals but rejoices the animal in us, as the new absolute \n(if you can call it that)? I might have lost a bit of track writing this, \nso excuse my supposedly lack of insight and/or clarity, but in all honesty, \nI am trying to read Nietzsche through Hegel, as you might have noted, which \nis my current project and what I tried to formulate.",

            "text": "+Martin Kr\u00f8yer I would agree with your heraclitian reading. As Nietzsche \nwrote (in Twilight of the Idols, if I remember) attitudes towards life in \ngeneral (whether it is worth living or not, for an example) do not say \nanything about the nature of lite \"itself\" to Nietzsche, but rather of the \nidiosyncrasies and attitudes of the confessor of those attitudes. They \nreveal the inner world of physiological and psychological sensitivity and \ndisposition. Thus, Taking into account the heraclitian, antiteleological \nview of becoming, I believe that the attitudes of \"obedience\" or \n\"rebellion\" are themselves only sort of psychological fictions, which \nactuate and motivate the inner impulses and drives of living beings. In and \nof themselves they have no absolute goal or meaning, but offer the illusion \nof meaning and striving, driven by Will to Power (as Nietzsche noted, what \nare \"motive\" and \"purpose\" other than dribbles on the surface of the sea of \nconsciousness, for consciousness, for Nietzsche, is a surface). I do \nbelieve that the idea of becoming must to some extent surpass a simple \nnotion of absolutes. As Nietzsche noted, an intellectual man uses \nconvictions as only tools to greater overcoming. On the other hand, as one \nexample of his paradoxical nature, Nietzsche did say that his happiness is \n\"yea and nay: a straight line: a goal\".\n\nAs for the ubermensch, I believe that one should best understand Nietzsche, \nas Walter Kaufmann noted, as a \"dialectical thinker\". What he meant was \nthat Nietzsche is not a \"black and white-thinker\". He considers \npropositions and phenomenon from multiple angles and their potential for \nlife and growth. On the other hand, Nietzsche seems to view tyrannical \nimpulses and need for control as, as you noted, signs of secret weakness \n(or at least as they manifest in the slave. The same kind of impulses might \nbe motivated by fully different motives and forms of thinking in a master). \nThe desire for absolutes and strong faith betray an inner uncertainty. On \nthe other hand, I believe that Nietzsche understands that such drives, \nreactionary impulses and ressentiments have played a great part in the \nevolution of the human animal and almost constitute the basis of his \nthinking (for good or bad). Egoism and lust for possession and dominino \nhave been perhaps the most necessary, life-preserving and life-enhancing \ndrives (and often the most hidden drives). In this sense I believe that, \ntragically, Nietzsche notes that the ubermensch or his cultivation may \nrequire such instincts for dominion (we should also remember that \nNietzsche's politics do retain their aristocratic aspects from beginning to \nend. Order of Rank and the pathos of distance, which keep the mob in line, \nare necessary for him, whereas we moderns with out democratic concerns \nmight consider his thought on ressentiment with the aim of creating an \nemancipated, all-inclusive political community and thus interpret that \ngetting rid of ressentiment means the elimination of hierarchies of \ndomination, where as Nietzsche may not think so). Of course, the difference \nis that the ubermensch accepts this tension of existence with glee, rather \nthan seeking to do away with it with some \"moral\" or metaphysical \nredemption of the world. He carries his terrible \"yea\" to every abyss. \n\nI would also add that one possible problem with your idea of the \"noble\" \nside of the ubermensch is that that interpretation may own it's \ninterpretive logic to the very Judeo-Christian moral framework, which \nNietzsche seeks to overcome. Our fears of the ubermensch may thus be the \nresult of the Christian moral training, which predisposes us to view the \nrelativistic consequences of the Death of God. as a great danger. Thus we \nview these consequences as dangers of the ubermensch ideal, even though \nthey may spring from our old modes of thinking about morality. Such \nproblems may in this sense rather be the problems of the old framework and \nnot the new ideal and transvaluation. But once a certain mode of thinking \nis transvalued and overcome, the former problems also disappear or appear \nin a new light. But I admit that this is rather a point on my and may not \nreflect the whole of Nietzsche's attitude. The problem is that you perhaps \ncannot logically presuppose that a problem constituted by the former ways \nof thinking are problems anymore if one considers them from the new \nperspective. This is a problem for us, not Nietzsche himself necessarily. \nThe transvaluation of all values presupposes the (perhaps) momentary \nshelving of those ideals.   But Nietzsche did not seek to abolish all \n\"enjoyable feelings\" nor does his \"immoralism\" simply mean a reversal of \nall previous values ti their opposites. Nietzsche's \"immoralism\", as \nKaufman noted, is rather defined by his criticism of any abslotu and simple \ndichotomy of good and evil.",

If we look at the human attitude towards the living God, we \nmight call it 'obedient', which lies close to nietzschean slave morality \nand the more postmodern attitude towards God as a sort of 'rebellion', \nexclaiming 'God is dead' and master morality. Isn't the true nietzschean \ninsight that we should neither live in 'obedience' or 'rebellion' but in \n'independence'? That the true nietzschean attitude towards life and truth \nis neither that of being and non-being (nihilism) but of becoming?
