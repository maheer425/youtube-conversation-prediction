If \nyou're not willing to invest days or weeks to applying, leveling, \nreapplying, and leveling as many times as is needed for you to be \nsatisfied, then you can always get it repainted.

If you simply wet sand the the chip or scratch to blend \nit with the surrounding paint, then compound and polish, you will get a \nmuch more pleasing result as far as looks are concerned.  I had a deep \nscratch on my hood that wasn't to the metal and simply wet sanded the \nsurrounding paint to the level of the scratch and buffed and polished it \nsmooth.  You can't tell there was ever a scratch there.  If I had filled \nthe scratch with touch up it would have looked worse than just not doing \nanything.",

Your car does have a \nlimited amount of clearcoat and wetsanding does cut into the clearcoat \nmoreso than polish or compoounding the paint. However, because you will be \napplying touch up paint, it will need to be sanded down to match the level \nof paint that is around the troubled spot so it will blend properly.\n\nSo for the most part, yes it will scratch the entire area that you are \nsanding. Just be sure to be gentle with the wetsand and do just enough to \nblend the area. You can fix the wetsand scratches by following up with \napplying compound via machine and then some polish.",
