            "text": "I think this video describes very well a phenomenon that is a big problem \nfor the gun community -- and lots of other communities as well, but I care \nabout this one.\n\nI find the video's terminology (thought germ) mildly annoying because there \nis a perfectly good word for that concept, coined in the 70s by Richard \nDawkins: meme.  Granted that the word \"meme\" has been somewhat twisted on \nthe Internet, but this video would have been a good opportunity to correct \nthat.\n\nAnyway, back to the point: the video contains an image at about 5:12 that \nis a perfect depiction of the conversation between pro and anti-gun \ncommunities, and it demonstrates quite nicely the basis of the sort of \nbashing that moderators on Guns across Google have to work so hard to \nsuppress and the false memes that we also try to discourage. The echo \nchamber effect combined with meme evolution means that, left unchecked, \nconversation within the community tends towards angry exchanges of ideas \nthat often don't have much to do with truth or reality, but which push the \nright buttons to be successful at spreading.\n\nThe effect also makes it basically impossible for pro- and anti-gun \ncommunities, each stewing in its own pot of anger-generating memes, to have \nany kind of useful discussion. That's bad, because we really do need to \nhave that discussion. At present we're having a fair amount of success at \nrolling back gun control in the US because of the 2A and similar clauses in \nmany state constitutions, but if we lose the battle of ideas the law can \nand will eventually be changed. The constitution can be amended.\n\nThe point that I'm circling here is that all of us need to pay attention to \nthe ideas we receive and monitor our own reactions to them. We need good \nmental hygiene, which includes in particular being very skeptical of ideas \nwhich align with our own views but might not actually be true, and it \nincludes being careful to remain open to ideas that are true but don't \nalign with our own views. And we all need to be careful not to conflate our \nbeliefs about the opinions and goals of the other side with their actual \nopinions and goals.\n\nIn the long run, our ability to maintain the right to keep and bear arms \nwill depend entirely on our ability to communicate effectively and \naccurately exactly why we believe the right is important.  Exchanging \nhalf-truths that make us feel good doesn't get us closer to that goal, nor \ndoes demonizing the opposition, particularly in ways that leave us \ncompletely clueless as to their real motives or goals.\n\nFinally, I want to point out that it's the moderation to suppress these \nineffective and bad pro-gun memes (e.g. rants about Hillary, unsupported \nconspiracy theories, even false quotes -- pro and anti -- from famous \nfigures) that generates the most opposition to moderation. The video points \nout that one of the most powerful memes that regularly evolves around \ndivides over an idea is some variant of \"you're with us or you're against \nus\". So when the moderators step in to stop some negative and unproductive \nideas, we get branded as being \"against\", even though it's obviously not \nvery likely that we would be moderators of a pro-gun community if we \nweren't pro gun.\n\nAnyway, I'll stop rambling now. I highly recommend that everyone watch the \nvideo, and think about it. Both in the context of firearms-related debates \nand in broader areas of your life and thinking.\n\nOh, and please start using the word \"meme\" correctly. It refers to a \nself-contained, self-replicating idea, not an image with words on it... \nthough images with words on them are memes, because they are also \nself-contained, self-replicating ideas :-)\ufeff",

The reason, to me, was that it was a \nextremely powerful tool to network the brains of the planet and find \nsolutions to specific problems at a speed never experienced before its \nadvent. I hadn't thought about cat pictures. I hadn't thought that to every \ninvention, as Paul Virilio so brilliantly said, there's an accident. The \ninternet's accident is the propagation of futility, triviality, useless \nfacts and thought germs. As this video states, there's still room for the \nrest and it is also being used wonderfully by some amazing thinkers and \ndoers. Let's build tools that will take advantage of its inherent brain \nnetworking capabilities and concentrate on those tools, improve them, use \nthem, propagate them. It's really our only hope. So far we've failed \nhorribly at solving our global problems even though we have the tool for \nit. LET'S DO IT.\ufeff",
