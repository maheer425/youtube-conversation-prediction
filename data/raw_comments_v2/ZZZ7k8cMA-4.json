Change our pen strokes,...it will change our charactor traits\n\n5. Change our body language,...it will change our charactor traits\n\n6. Change our thought intention,...and it will change our charactor traits\n\n7. Thus it makes sense to become sensitive to our thoughts, so that we can \nattract in our life, eternal respect from all creation\n\n8. If we give forth the invisable Intentions of respect & honor,.......then \nwe will attract visible respect & honor in our life\n\n9. It's the Universal Law of Cause & Effect,....or Sow & Reap,...or The LAw \nof Agreement\n\n10. If we send disrepectcful thought signals (intention)\nas vibrations in the airways,...,...these signals comprise a Legal \nAgreement,...but a Lawfull Agreement is made when we send respectful \nsignals as vibrations into the airways\n\n11. All Legal Agreements are entered into by Asssumption, this includes \nCITIZENSHIP by way of the BIRTH CERTIFICATE APPLICATION BOND\n\n12. If we rebutt the Assumption, by way of Lawful Affidavits recorded in \nthe public record,...then we now have the option to stand as an Individual \nNation, who can create their own money,...which can be used in retail \nstores,...exchangable at the International Currency Exchange Center, \nlocally available in each city\n\n13. Every Bank knows how to take your Legal mortgage promissary Note, \n(called, your own Legal Money) and exchange it for local paper currency\n\n14. Of course the bank didn't fully disclose to you,...that the 20 page \nmortgage is actually a Legal Promissary Note, or in other words,...Legal \nPaper Money,...aurthorized by your signature (sign of Nature) (Sign of \nMother Nature),....thus the 'ol saying,...\"when you see the tree bend, you \nknow the wind is blowing\"\n\n15. Nor did the bank fully disclose, that they converted your personal \nLegal promissary Note for cash, and kept the cash in a escrow account for \nthree years,...and after three years wrote a letter to the IRS asking to \ndeposit (1099-A,...abandonment of funds) the paper money in their own \naccount, as well as cause us to work jobs to pay the BANKS back with \nInterest, for 30 years  \n\n16. Long story short,....when you become a Secured Party Creditor,...you \ncan draw your own paper money,...even with crayon & toilet paper\n\n17. Secured Party Creditor, is just a popular name for the affidavits we \ncan record in the public record, to rebut the assumption of a Legal NANNY \n(Attorney)..., which,... Mother Nature put there to teach us how to be Self \nRegulating in Peacefulness, Safety & Responcibility\n\n18. Legal PRISON PLANET world was created by the Illuminati & Freemenasons, \nto bring us out of the Caveman kill or be killed world-chaos of the jungle\n\n19. There is a third step to Man's evolution,....it was the Mayan \nShift,....which is,....CoCreating our Reality, by way of Lawful Agreement, \notherwise known as the Law of Attraction\n\n20. The Big gun and muscle, was put in place by Mother Nature to force \neveryone to obtain a Birth Certificate Application Bond,.....of which the \nBIRTH CERTIFCATE (TITLE to the BODY) was created\n\n21. There is really only One CORPORATE B.C. BOND,.....but for the sake of \ndistributing earth's recources to the people in a safe orderly \nmethod,.....we gave everyone their own stock share of the B.C. BOND. \nIndividuals can claim his share of that STOCK DIVIDENED, which provides \nrecources (Retail shelf Products) to care for his particular BODY\n\n22. That way everyone can become a Secured Party Creditor at their own \norderly time & pace\n\n23. No one tramples the door down so to speak, like they used to do in the \njungle,......the strong trampled the weak, and the weak got all the worst \nstuff, food, clothes, protection.. ... ...\n\n24. All we have to do is,...learn how to become a Secured Party Creditor\n\n25. To do this we search: Solutions in Commerce\n\n26. Listen to WINSTON SHROUT introduce you to the top equal capstone system \nthat rules the Earth,...called,...Private Maritime Law\n\n27. Then when your ready to move up the Illuminati-FreeMason Pyramid,...you \ncan order DVD Seminars & CD's, which include all the templates, reading \nmaterial,...and recomended subjects & books to view\n\n28. I recomend at least 10 (ten) DVD Seminars & the single DVD called: \nCOMMERCIAL LIEN & the Paul Zaccardi DVD's called:  A4V\n\n29. I listened to them while I worked in the back yard. Over and Over again \nand again\n\n30. This is how I was able to move up the Illuminati - FreeMason Pyramid.\n\n31. I dont use Legal National Paper Money to pay for, taxes, or utilities, \nor Internet, or registrations or fees\n\n32. In fact, i stopped paying anything,...and found the COMMERCIAL LIEN to \nbe the Hammer that drives the Nail in with one Blow. I had to see my Lien \nStand and Hold !, before I was ready to pay private money (my own crayon & \ntoiletpaper)\n\n33. No Attourney can collect from a Secured Party Creditor, and I put it to \nthe Ultimate Test, by actual experience in the Field,...and yes I caught \nTrenchFoot making my stand, but that was my own attraction (each man to his \nown)\n\n34. But,...keep in mind,... the Attorneys still sent court papers and \njudgements against us (test of Mother Nature),....but I stood my ground \npeacfully, no cussing, no bad mouthing,. They wont collect,....they can \nonly give the appearance of collection,....but they wont touch you,....it's \nall a test of fear to see if we will give in to the BILL assumption of \nman,....and or,........abandon the property\n\n35. Therfore Mother Nature promoted me. Now that I fully tested with real \nexperience,.......the power of the COMMERCIAL LIEN, against 12 \nBANKS,...STATE TAX,...IRS,...UTILITIES, CITY CONDEMNORS, and COUNTY \nPROPERTY TAX......\n\n36. I finally felt my oats from standing my ground,...wrote my first crayon \n& toiletpaper money (atually I just used my bank checks, and endorced the \nback as beneficiary) and sent the dishonor to the IRS - CID (criminal \nInvestigation Division),....the CID is your closest friendly link to the \nBig Gun,....or INTERNATIONAL MILITARY, that's on your side when you rebut \nthe Legal Assumption,....and become a Lawful Secured Party Creditor\n\n37. Is your TRUST in MAN (Legal Assumption - cerebellum- animal lower \nbrain) or is your TRUST in Yourself (God) (cerebrum, or upperbrain, or Most \nHigh Brain,.......or Holy of Holies, where the Ark of the Covenant is)\n\n37. I'll keep ya up to date, on my private money situation\n\n38. He who enters the Dark cave that he fears the Most,........will find \nthe greatest TREASURY to pay for all life's NesseCity\ufeff",
