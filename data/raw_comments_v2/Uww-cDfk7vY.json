And drove MANY animals to extinction..all due to our ability to \ncreate, we've created things to make human lives easier which is great! I'm \namazed by the human mind it's basically a whole new universe in there). But \nI mean, are we worth it? We think our creativity is worth it because we are \nhuman, but in the environmental/natural world/earth's perspective, I \nhonestly DONT KNOW if we are worth it or not. Perhaps it's not a real \nquestion, we are here because we are, science, chance, luck. Maybe we are \ngoing to destroy earth completely eventually, and then finally, human race \nwill go extinct too. Then earth will finally become a dead planet, or when \nthe sun explodes the earth will be burned into ashes and particles. And \nthat's it. Of course we will want to live as along as possible and should \nall try to destroy less and create more, but if we don't, we will just need \nto suffer the consequences of that. \ufeff",

And if we all were to drop dead, all at once, in the \nmiddle of what we're doing, with all of our factories and cars running, \nthat would create WAY more problems than it would solve. We have made a \nhuge ton of mistakes, of course. Not all of them can be fixed or reversed, \nbut some of them can, and only we can fix them. We can't bring species back \nfrom total extinction, no. We can, however, save some of the species that \nwe've driven to near extinction. We can replant some of the forests we've \ncut down and build upwards instead of out to minimize the sprawl of our \nimpact and restore the habitats that otherwise would have been destroyed. \nAnd not everyone is ignorant; there are some brilliant, wonderful, \nhardworking, dedicated people out there who are working to fix our \nproblems. Please, if you listen to nothing else that I'm saying, please \nread the book called \"Hope For The Animals And Their World: How Endangered \nSpecies Are Being Rescued From the Brink\" by Jane Goodall. This was the \nbook that brought about my slightly more optimistic paradigm (before, I \nbelieved that humans should go extinct, too) and made it so I decided that \nthe one thing I accomplish before I die is going to be to save a species \nfrom extinction. I will be working in captive breeding programs after I \ngraduate from college, and I will be working with other people who care \ndeeply about the Earth and want to fix it. Because there ARE people like \nthat. The problem is NOT that people won't care. They just aren't educated \nenough to care. They're taught that humans have the right to live on Earth \nas the dominant species either because they think that we've earned it \nsomehow or that the privilege is bestowed by a God. But there IS HOPE. And \nI really hope, for your sake and the sake of the Earth, that you can learn \nto see it. Because maybe if you can, then other people who feel the same \nway can. And if they can, then maybe there's hope for us all. ",

Why do we think humans are more worth than other forms of life? If you \nwere caught in a burning building and had to choose between saving a human \nyou hate or a pet you love, you will always choose the human, right?\n\nThis probably is just a by-product of evolution. We want to reserve our \ngenes, because hey, making babies is the ultimate meaning of everything, \nright? Well, saving someone who looks like you also saves your genes, as \nyou have more genetic information in common with a human than a dog, for \nexample.\n\nSo could we deduce that feeling this way about human life is just a stone \nage idea of species-oriented racism? Or species-ism... :D This is backed up \nby the thought that we, as humans feel more empathy and connect better with \npeople who look like us and also might discriminate against others, who are \ndifferent. (e.g. racism)\n\nIs this really a logical way to think or is this just based on some \nevolutionary advantages you get for humanoid-favoritism? \n\n2.If someone thinks that our intelligence makes us \"special\" then what \nabout a small thought experiment? Imagine a creature that is as far away \nfrom us intellectually as worms are, but in the other direction. An alien \nrace that has mastered space travel and is superior to us in every way. \n\nWould it be okay for this alien race to treat you as they wish and take \nadvantage of you? Of course not! So why is it ok for us to do so to others?\nIt's our viewpoint that makes our perception skewed, we wouldn't use the \ncriterion of intelligence to determine importance if we weren't the most \nintelligent race we knew.\n\nJust think about how you measure your own \"worth\" (I'm just using this word \nfor the sake of the argument, not because I think a persons worth can be \nmeasured in this way..) You would obviously put more value on the \ncharacteristics that make you special. If you're athletic, you're more \nlikely to value athleticism, or if you're smart, you will value yourself \nbased on that.\n\nIt isn't like our achievements don't matter, it's just that we would find a \nway to think the best about ourselves no matter what.\ufeff",
