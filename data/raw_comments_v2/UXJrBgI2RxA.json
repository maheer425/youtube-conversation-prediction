The video \nshows a quad dominant squat which because of parallel toe position excludes \nthe majority of the posterior chain.\n\nI guarantee anyone trying this squat feels it on the front of the legs and \nlittle to none on their hamstrings, inner thighs or Glutes. \n\nNow try the squat with a shoulder width stance and feet turned out roughly \n30 degrees and sit down into your heels keeping lower back straight and \nknees following in the path as the toes. When at the bottom drive your hips \nup by pushing into your heels and now see where you feel it!\n\nThis engages hip drive which in turn calls upon the posterior chain to lift \nyou up and because your thighs are opened slightly the thigh muscles are \nrecruited as part of the posterior chain.\n\nIn closing I appreciate this is a beginners demonstration but I believe \ncalling out discrepancies such as I have more relevant because it's a \nbeginners video. \n\nIf flexibility is an issue then that should addressed before attempting a \nsquat of any nature. If you simply want to target the quads for some \nbizarre reason the use a leg extension machine and leave squats out.\n\ufeff",
