My guess would be because they're both European, and its \nbecome a trend in the automotive world to favor Japanese and European \nmanufacturers over American (I use to be guilty of it too, until I stopped \nbasing facts on others opinions. Obviously I still believe the rest of the \nworld is ahead of the U.S. but only marginally) so when a Corvette, Camaro, \nor Mustang can compete with cars twice their price people don't hesitate to \nmention how they suffer in interior quality even though thats to be \nexpected with something that cost a fraction of what it can outperform. \nThat doesn't matter though because its American and for some reason its not \nok to recognize because supposed \"build quality\" isn't the same even though \nmy experiences have taught me that a 6L V8 that revs to 6K RPM, will run \nmuch longer than a 4L V8 or B6 (boxer), that revs to 9K RPM before it runs \ninto any mechanical issues. I guess my definition of \"build quality\" is \nsomething that'll last longer than its competition. Build technology is a \nwhole different story but even U.S. manufacturers are just as competent of \ngoing toe to toe with the best of them. So my point is, why is it ok for a \nBMW to cost less and be outperformed by its competition while also lacking \ninterior quality, but its not ok for a Corvette to cost less than a Porsche \n996/7/1 911 Carrera when it outperforms it and has slightly less interior \nquality yet better mechanical quality (or at least reliability)??? People \nhave just joined the band wagon all over the planet rather than taking \nthings for what they are, and like I said, I use to be guilty of it too \nuntil I asked myself why I thought that way and I couldn't justify it.\ufeff",

My guess would be because they're both European, and its become a \ntrend in the automotive world to favor Japanese and European manufacturers \nover American (I use to be guilty of it too, until I stopped basing facts \non others opinions. Obviously I still believe the rest of the world is \nahead of the U.S. but only marginally) so when a Corvette, Camaro, or \nMustang can compete with cars twice their price people don't hesitate to \nmention how they suffer in interior quality even though thats to be \nexpected with something that cost a fraction of what it can outperform. \nThat doesn't matter though because its American and for some reason its not \nok to recognize because supposed \"build quality\" isn't the same even though \nmy experiences have taught me that a 6L V8 that revs to 6K RPM, will run \nmuch longer than a 4L V8 or B6 (boxer), that revs to 9K RPM before it runs \ninto any mechanical issues. I guess my definition of \"build quality\" is \nsomething that'll last longer than its competition. Build technology is a \nwhole different story but even U.S. manufacturers are just as competent of \ngoing toe to toe with the best of them. So my point is, why is it ok for a \nBMW to cost less and be outperformed by its competition while also lacking \ninterior quality, but its not ok for a Corvette to cost less than a Porsche \n996/7/1 911 Carrera when it outperforms it and has slightly less interior \nquality yet better mechanical quality (or at least reliability)???

SL  is a weekend car for me but the longer I \ndrive the M6, the longer I have to think about pulling the SL out of my \ngarage. I  enjoy both cars but if i was to pick one to drive..It would be \nmy BMW M6 Grand Coupe. I track my cars routinely at Mosport our local \nracetrack near toronto. M6 hands downs runs better times than my SL. With a \nV12 and a high speed track I expected the SL to easily be faster. Its not. \nI personally hate the looks of the new SL. I would never buy it.",

And BMW's have been Mercedes Rivals for as long as I can \nremember! I think I need to re-check the planetary alignment here/ Let's \nnot forget one thing here, the Cl has a BACK SEAT something you can't get \nin an SL, that puts the SL in a different category, PERIOD. If you are \nlooking for a roomy, sporty 2 DOOR with a BACKSEAT that only leaves you an \nE63 or C63 (too small) from MERCEDES or an M6 from BMW. They made a 2 DOOR \nS class for a REASON, some people are looking for a 2 DOOR with a BACK SEAT \nand for those who prefer BMW or MERCEDES, they will gravitate toward the \nM6. It's either SOMETHING or NOTHING which is probably why there is a new \nE63 Coupe to fill that void. Put 2 and 2 together, it's not that hard (no \npun intended). A 2 door 2 seater coupe is not interchangeable with a full \nsize 4 door sedan solely because of prestige. What you're basically saying \nis \"I wanted to buy a CL, but there was no CL available (remember, backseat \nneeded), so I went to a BMW dealer to look at the M6, and BMW told me that \nthey don't make a competing car for the CL and that I should go look at an \nAston Martin or an Bentley GT\". I'm sorry but I think I must live in a \ndifferent reality than everyone else here. But I believe that BMW will \ncertainly take my money if I like the M6 when I couldn't get a CL even if \nit supposedly wasn't meant to be its competition (as I probably would have \nnever looked at the M6 until the CL disappeared).",
