You can trade very easily with Bloodthirster, \nsince you have a lot of damage and (since you have a lot of damage) you get \na high amount of life back.\nMy second item is Infinity Edge. It increases your damage by a huge amount. \nSince your Q scales pretty well with Damage you can crit 1100 after 20 mins \n(if you win your lane and have both items.).\nMy third item depends on how well i do in the game. I often buy Last \nWhisper, beacuse you deal a lot of damage, but if i loose i buy Phantom \nDancer, since you can run away more easily if you have more movement speed.\nMy fourth item is Last Whisper or Phantom Dancer, which of course depends \non what item i bought as the third one.\nAnd my fifth item is GA or Mercurial Scimitar, because you need to survive \nin teamfights.\nYou can replace Phantom Dancer or the defensive item with trinity force, if \nyou feel like you are winning and there is no chance you die in the \nteamfights.\nBut I recommend to always build the defensivve item.\nAnd of course I buy Berserker's Greaves (sometimes with Furor, sometimes \nwith Homeguards, which depends if we are loosing or winning the game).\nSometimes I buy them before Bloodthirster, if I cant afford Bloodthirster, \nor if I feel like I need the Movement Speed.\nSometimes I buy them after the Bloodthirster, if I have the chance to \nfinish Bloodthirster early, or if i dont feel like I need the Movement \nSpeed.\nAlso I would buy Dorans Blade at level 1. And at the first back, I try to \nget Vampiric Scepter and Boots of Speed (the normal brown boots).\nYou dont need that much Attack Speed on Draven since Draven is all about \ndoing tons of damage with his Q.\n\nWell the build is not that different, but it has a different order, which - \nI think - is better.

It'll make you deal tons of \ndamage. Build the Bloodthirster to survive in teamfights. Don't get \nsomething like Frozen Mallet, because it doesn't give you as much damage. \n1. Berserker's Greaves (Furor or Homeguard)\n2. Infinity Edge (Core Item - Makes Draven's Q deal devastating damage)\n3. Phantom Dancer (Core Item - Works well with infinity edge)\n4. The Bloodthirster (Lifesteal and survivability)\n\nYour fifth item is an offensive item, but depends on the situation.\n-If the enemy is stacking Armour, then go for Last Whisper.\n-If there's an enemy stacking Health, then go for Blade of the Ruined King\n-If you really need Frozen Mallet's slow or you're snowballing, then buy \nTrinity Force. It gives you attack damage, attack speed, critical strike, \nSheen proc and Phage speed boost.\n\nYour sixth item is defensive, also depends.\n-If the enemy has too much stuns or disables, go for Mercurial Scimitar or \nBanshee's Veil.\n-If your getting nuked by the enemy's APC, go for Maw of Malmortius\n-If the enemy ADC is killing you, then build a Randuin's Omen\n-If nothing else and you're doing all right, then go for Guardian's Angel.",
