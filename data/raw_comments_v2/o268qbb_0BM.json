You \nmay make humanities earthly life easier with science, if you use it for \ngood. But if people want to find out, why you are on earth, \"who is the \nmain character of the universe\", people need to believe. Such questions \nalso aren't good for jokes. Trying to find it out with science is just \ndissipation of ressources, which could be used to help poor people.\ufeff",

WITHOUT SPEED it's not \nlik anything can happen, without time nothing can exist, OR Can but is \nirrelevant, who cares if the universe can exist without time, frozen like a \npicture.. none of these thoughts would ave much logic, it would all be \nfrozen and it just so happens we keep on moving.. Vsauce said something \nabout \"photons\" and other things that if YOU were them you wouldn't realise \nyou exist.. even though you'd be like as fast as light or something.. but \nwe are human, not sure about dreams/imagination.. but you need Time to \nexist, speed is very important and without speed.. so many things are \nunable to happen, if not all.. although Einstein says 2 things are always \nconnected.. and well you can have infinite time but without the possibility \nfor something to happen.. it might be irrelevant, however WITHOUT having \nTIMe even if you have the possibility to DO something you technically CAN't \nbecause without TIME nothing can happen, so in a way you don't have that \npossibility then.. you may have a million dollars but without time u can't \nuse them or if nothing that costs money exists it's not like you can use \nthem to buy anything, although you can use them in the toilet or whatever.. \nWill Smith in a recent was about to have a se*ual intercoarse or something \nwith a woman on a bed of money or whatever xD.. and well, Speed accounts \nfor most occasions of possibilities or at least valueable/relevant ones, a \nturtle travelling from point A - 1000 KM to point B.. u can measure how \nmuch time it would take minimum.. for it to travel and know that u'd have \nat least 3 days free of care, if it was a dangerous turtle.. not to care \nabout it reaching point B, in resident evil zombies were slow and they \ndodged them.. the woman was telling the girl.. don't worry, they're slow.. \nand The Matrix shows so many things about speed.. as Einstein said the \nfaster you move the slower time goes for you, who cares if someone goes to \ngym 24/7 if he can't ever reach me xD.. or even if he does what if I dodge \nhis hits when I run 24/7 ;p.. Einstein is motivational to run 24/7, it is \nlike.. if you aren't busy u shold be running 24/7 so that u don't age, just \nlike gravity is somewhat infinite.. and space, etc. // 11;28;47",
