I'd say a stock CTS-V, \nespecially a V wagon, is an excellent example of a sleeper. This one in the \nvideo may be too loud to be a sleeper, but a stock one fits the definition. \n Example: At a gas station recently I had my CTS-V wagon (with 730 HP) at \none pump, and a guy with a bright red Charger SRT8 was at the next one \nover. People were flocking to his car and admiring the engine etc.\n\nMeanwhile nobody was even looking at my car. Not even a glance. And it \nwould have completely destroyed that Charger in a race. THAT is what I call \na sleeper. Nobody knows what it is, or expects the beatdown that is coming.\n\nThere are better examples of sleepers, like monster miatas or any \nLS-swapped anything, but as stock cars go the CTS-V is one of the sleepiest.",

COLD air is \npreferred because it is more dense, thus the air-fuel mixture is more dense \nand contains more power (increased O2 + increased hydrocarbons) put cubic \nunit. Hot air, on the other hand, is less dense due to expansion, thanks to \nthe excitability of air molecules when heated (think hot-air balloon). This \nis why engines have more horsepower in cold weather (e.g. winter) than in \nhot weather (e.g. Arizona 110 degree summer). ",

Just springs and check valves \nto redirect the trans fluid to get to the next gear.\nBut...that viscous fluid is heavy. The centrifugal forces of the torque \nconverter spinning that fluid in order to create the pressure required to \nopen/close the check valves are in effect which creates parasitic drag \nrequiring MORE horsepower to carry that weight. It also creates heat. A \nknown proven power killer. That 'ease of use' comes with a penalty\nStick shifts require a release of the clutch, a physical gear change from \none gear, past neutral, into the next gear, followed by the clutch being \nre-engaged.\nAn auto has no interruption of the power being put to the wheels, as is so \nwith a stick.\nEven 'No-lift' power shifting can't get around that fact.\nThat being said, the parasitic drag of a stick shift is a fraction of the \nautomatic.\nTherefore, MORE power is available to the wheels. Especially apparent when \ncomparing identical vehicles, save for the difference in transmissions.\nApples to apples, y'kow?\nNow, IF that is understood, the 'driving experience', & the end use of one \nover the other is a personal choice. What do YOU want?\nJump in with your triple grande 1/2 fat vanilla latte in one hand, Ipod/pad \nin the other, drop it into drive, an crank up the Montavani, & numbly \ncommute while being ensconced & totally devoid of any input from the \nvehicle while it does it's thing, AUTOMATICALLY? Yawwwwwwwn!\nOr...would you rather be PART of the driving experience? To have actual \nphysical input into the how the vehicle reacts & behaves as according to \nYOU?\nBesides, a driver with a stick shift is not necessarily a better driver, \nbut more aware. Especially apparent when negotiating hills, corners, & \nstop-n-go traffic. Driving a stick requires that the operator makes CHOICES \nas dictated by the physical surroundings. Driving with an auto in the same \nsituation? Mash it & go! (Be careful though. Don't wanna spill that $5.00 \nlatte!) There is NO time to be sucking back a cuppa, or diddling on a \npersonal communication device.\nI'll even go as far as saying that new drivers should be required to drive \nfor the first 2 years behind the wheel of a stick. (As did I.) I'll \ngarauntee that at the end of that time, they WILL be a better driver than \nsomeone whom has driven an auto, exclusively!\nI'm not saying one is better than the other. They both have their place in \nthe automotive world. I AM saying that daily automatic drivers tend to be \nprone to being distracted, & lazy in their driving habits. (There's 'good' \ndriving habits, & 'bad' driving habits.)\nBut...whatdya want to be? Just another droid cruising along mindlessly \noblivious?\nOr a 'driver'? Someone actually aware of the vehicle, how it's performing \naccording to their own input & the surroundings they are in?\nWithout a phone in one hand, and coffee stains down the front of the Armani \nsilk shirt! (So that's what a tie is for!)\nHey, you might even get to work with a smile on your face! How could the \nrest of the day go bad after a morning commute behind a stick?\nI'd pick a stick over an auto anyday! Even with their inherent shortcomings!\n I like that positive control. Doesn't matter if it's a clapped out '50's \nChevy pick-up with an inline six & a 3-on-the-tree, a '60's Muscle car \nwith the clutch pressure requirements equal to a semi's, or a CTS-V with \nthe not so common stick.\nReal 'DRIVER'S' drive sticks!",

Isn't the point of the manual that you can be in \nany gear you want as fast as you want? You understand that I can go from \n6th to 3rd in one motion, right?\n\nAnd what does 150 MPH have to do with anything? The manual has a better \npower to weight ratio at ALL SPEEDS, not just 150 MPH and above. Why is \nthis even an argument?\n\nAnd yes, autos are for lazy people who want the car to do their shifting \nfor them. That is specifically what autos are designed to do. It's the \nreason you get an auto, because you don't like shifting, because you're \neither lazy or terrible. Also just FYI, the GT-R's transmission is a dual \nclutch paddle shifted manual, not an automatic. There is a difference, \nthough I wouldn't expect you to understand it.

Do you really expect to see as many fast M6 times \nas autos when far less M6 Vs actually exist?\n\nYour point is flawed. At this date and time, there are more autos than \nmanuals. Nothing you've said precludes M6 Vs from being as fast or faster \nthan autos, and the fact that there are MORE autos does not automatically \nmean they are faster by definition. That's like saying McDonald's has \nbetter food than Emeril's steak house... because there are MORE of them.\n\nAnd I'm still waiting for you to disprove everything I told you about how \nmanual Vs are actually faster. As in, it's a FACT that they're faster. ",
