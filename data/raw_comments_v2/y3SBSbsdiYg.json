In about 40 seconds he has to explain why photons duplicate. \nWhat you said makes a lot of sense, but it will most likely cause a \"tl, \ndr\" as you said (and it did). I hope you don't mind, but I've tried to sum \nup what you said:\n\n-Time direction is reversible: If an electric field (a photon hitting an \nelectron of an atom) can cause the atom to absorb a photon, it can also \ncause it to *emit* one. This is called \"stimulated emission\" (la*SE*r). The \nemitted photon is identical to the incoming one.\n\n-This can only happen in very specific circumstances (polarizations (spins) \nof the incoming light, relative phase and wavelength, angular momentum \nconservation, etc. Some of these are quite complicated). \nOnly very specific photons get absorbed, so only very specific photons get \n\"stimulatedly emitted\".\n\n-To make a laser work, there must be more excited atoms than atoms in their \nground states, so that stimulated emission becomes more likely than \nabsorption or spontaneous emission. This means that the gain medium (the \nmedium where this happens) must be driven long and hard enough by light of \nthe correct wavelength so that it will actually lase.\nThen you let out some of the photons from the chamber and voil\u00e0, a laser.\n\nPlease correct me it got something wrong.",

            "text": "+Videblu \"You write this on a lot of his videos.\"\n\nYes, because a lot of his videos are wrong. If you've seen my other posts, \nchances are you've seen my explanations also. This makes the flippant \napproach you just chose more than a little bit puzzling. \n\nAs far as the subject of this video, I need only say that the entropic \nargument given in it is completely false. If it were true, any old \nflashlight would also be a laser since all photons in the same state would \nbe entropically preferred.\n\nHowever, that is very obviously not what happens, so the very simplistic \n\"there are more states like this\" entropy argument cannot be the answer. As \nsuch, you must discuss the phenomenon of stimulated emission -- that's what \nthe SE in laSEr stands for. \n\nStimulated emission is a process whereby an electron in an excited state, \nwhen hit by a photon, decays to a lower state while emitting an identical \nphoton. The fact that the emitted photon is *identical* is the secret \nsauce: lasing cannot occur without this. Watching this video you might \nimagine that photons are emitted with all kinds of quantum numbers but that \nit's just *more likely* that the emitted photon has the same quantum \nnumbers as the original because photons are bosons and there are more \nmultiparticle boson states with all particles in the same state than \notherwise. However, what is predicted by quantum theory is that (given \ncertain approximations) incident photon get exactly duplicated with very \nhigh probability. \n\nThis is a complicated dynamical fact that requires quantizing not only the \natomic system, but the electromagnetic field, too. Now it turns out that \nthe electromagnetic field is not often discussed in elementary courses in \nquantum mechanics, because photons are very complicated objects. In \nparticular, they're always relativistic so you can't do \"nonrelativistic\" \nquantum mechanics with them. So no wavefunctions or Schr\u00f6dinger equations \nor anything like that. \n\nI don't know of a simple way to explain this. Certainly the fact that \nphotons *can* be in the same state is important: for fermions you can only \nhave zero or one particles in the same state, so an \"electron laser\" \n(please do not confuse with a free electron laser) would be impossible. But \nit's not the whole story. You need an interaction that takes a state with \none photon into a state with two identical photons. That is, the \n\"duplication\" is not a property of photons alone, as minutephysics \nsuggested, but a property of the interaction. \n\nOne piece of the puzzle may be understood quite easily. The laws of physics \n(well, most of them) are invariant under time reversal. If you replace t by \n-t in a valid equation and complex conjugate, you also get a valid \nequation. This means that if an electric field can cause an atomic \ntransition that corresponds to *absorption* of a photon, then the *same* \nelectric field can cause the transition in the opposite direction, \naccompanied by photon emission.\n\nThe piece that I can't elementarily explain is that these transitions only \nhappen in very specific circumstances, which include specific polarizations \n(spins) of the incident light, as well as relative phase and wavelength. \nThe net result is that, because only very specific photons get absorbed, \nonly very specific photons get \"stimulatedly emitted\", which must be carbon \ncopies of the original photon. Some of the \"selection rules\" that forbid or \nallow transitions have to do with rotational invariance -- photons have \nangular momenta, and interactions have to conserve total angular momentum. \nOthers have to do with more complicated facts about representations of \noperators and symmetry groups in quantum mechanics. Others are a result of \nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation when applied to the atomic system (not the photon, \nfor which it's always inapplicable).\n\nThen you must ensure that there is a population inversion, that is, that \nthere are more atoms in their excited states than in their ground states so \nthat stimulated emission becomes more likely than mere absorption. This \nmeans that the gain medium has been driven long and hard enough by light of \nthe correct wavelength so that it will actually lase. What you want is for \nstimulated emission to happen often enough when compared to spontaneous \nemission (which gives random, incoherent light). Now you let out some of \nthe photons from the chamber and voil\u00e0, coherent, polarized light.\n\nAnywho, to tl;dr: the property that photons get duplicated is *not* a \nproperty of photons alone. It's a property of the interaction between \nphotons and atomic systems. It's a *dynamical* fact, whereas the \nexplanation given by minutephysics was merely kinematical/statistical. ",

            "text": "+Jordan Shank I thought you might have since the correlation was so high, \nbut I didn't wanna risk it. Glad we're on the same page :)\n\nAs far as your second question... I honestly don't know. I've grappled with \nthe issue of \"pop science\" for a long time and I don't think I formed an \nopinion one way or the other. I guess in the name of honesty I should \nacknowledge the influence that good science communicators had on me and in \nmy decision to pursue a scientific career. So I guess I can't complain \nabout it too much. But I think that at least we should expect science \ncommunicators to maintain reasonably high standards in how they present \ntheir stuff.\n\nOne example I think is nice and you might've heard of was when Sixty \nSymbols did some videos about summing up the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .... On \nthe one hand, their approach wasn't rigorous and many viewers correctly \ncalled them out on it. On the other, their calculation was formally \nidentical to the rigorous calculation, with some key conceptual steps \nomitted. Despite the shortcomings, the video and the discussions it \ngenerated were quite informative, regardless of educational level, and \nultimately I believe it was an example of science (or math) communication \ndone right. \n\nI guess if I had to give an answer it'd have to be something like \"lying a \nlittle is okay, but not too much\", which is exactly as vague as my opinion \non the subject.\n\n\"Side note: From my own education, he's usually not wrong in most of his \nvideos. This video seems to be an outlier than an accurate trend in Henry's \nscientific accuracy\"\n\nYeah, I got to admit, my opinion of him is soured a little bit by some very \nwrong videos I've seen (notably the one on the Higgs boson). It's quite \npossible that most of his videos are right and I just tend to remember the \nbad apples.",

This video seems to be an outlier than an accurate \ntrend in Henry's scientific accuracy.) But that raises a question I've seen \nother people approach in this video and others: namely, is it possible for \nhis more... interesting ideas to be wrong in principle but right in \npractice?\n\nHenry's videos may be factually incorrect, but they do expose a broad \naudience to interesting scientific phenomena. So, is it better that people \nwatch these videos even if they're wrong? Or would it be better if people \ndidn't watch these at all? I do think the former is preferable, since \nintrigued viewers might go on to learn more about the subject on their own, \nbut that's just an opinion. I am curious to read your own, if you care to \nshare.\n\nI've been meaning to start my own physics channel, too, but I haven't found \nthe time to write a script or set up a film area.

            "text": "+Jordan Shank\"By your logic, teachers shouldn't use this analogy because \nit's factually incorrect. \"\n\nThat's not my logic at all. That's your supposition of what my logic is.\n\nThe explanation given by the teacher is the low energy (Newtonian) \napproximation to the full relativistic dynamics. It is the leading term in \nan asymptotic expansion in v/c. It's clearly appropriate to the problem at \nhand. Further, it's *more* appropriate than the full relativistic \nexpression since any and all corrections that are of higher order in v/c \nget entirely swamped by experimental error and are unobservable, even in \nprinciple. Strictly speaking they can't be said to be there at all. So the \nNewtonian approximation is entirely justified, rigorous, and accurate.\n\nIn contrast, I know of a certain physics youtuber who dislikes Newtonian \napproximations... watch?v=IM630Z8lho8\n\nD'oh!\n\nThe problem with the exposition in this video is not that it's \n\"simplified\", or even \"outdated\". It's *fictional*. It was never true, it \nnever even resembled anything that could be construed as an explanation for \na laser. You can easily see that this simple entropic argument cannot work \nby noting that if it were true you'd see lasing merely by placing on mirror \nin front of the other. This obviously doesn't happen. You *need* to \nunderstand stimulated emission and gain media. You *need* to understand \npopulation inversion. Population inversion is quite interesting by itself, \nsince it leads to the subject of negative temperatures which are surprising \nand fascinating. \n\nA competent physics youtuber attempting to explain these concepts would \nhave to find creative ways to make them accessible. Veritasium is typically \nvery good at this. Minutephysics, on the other hand, tends to just make up \nwhatever fictional explanation would sound sexy, even if it has only a \npassing resemblance to reality.\n\n\"You could even try making a video about it.\"\n\nI've been meaning to try to start a physics channel, but honestly I don't \nthink I have the competence or charisma to make videos that the average \nperson would find interesting.

            "text": "+gogerychwyrndrobwll There's a common analogy teachers use when teaching \nbasic arithmetic. Imagine a man walking forward on a train that's also \nmoving forward. What is the man's speed relative to the ground? According \nto the teacher, it's the man's speed on the train plus the train's speed on \nthe ground. But that's false. Relativity tells us his speed is actually a \nlittle slower than that.\n\nBy your logic, teachers shouldn't use this analogy because it's factually \nincorrect. Their students would go into the world with the wrong idea about \nhow the world works. It wouldn't matter that the students' understanding \nand the reality is off by mere trillionths of a m/s: wrong is wrong, period.\n\nMaybe you're actually right. This video isn't accurate, and it's off from \nthe reality by a lot more than the train situation is from reality. But \nunlike basic arithmetic, which has many possible analogies that a teacher \ncould use, the physics of lasers is awfully complicated. This video shows \nwhat very well may be the simplest analogy possible that gets the basic \nidea of lasers across. It might be technically wrong, but a basic idea is \nbetter than no idea at all, right?\n\nIf you can think of a more accurate but equally simple analogy, I would \nhonestly love to know it.
