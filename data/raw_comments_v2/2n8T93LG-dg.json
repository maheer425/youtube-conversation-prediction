Another boat trip is from the European side to the Asian \nside, where you will find tons of fish restaurants(calamari and fried \noysters are amazing here) and I believe there is an ancient castle atop the \nhill. Another point of interest is Uskudare which has so many shops and a \nvery cheap restaurant called Borsa Restaurant which serves local dishes \ncheap. Let's see, what else. Oh yes. At night, go to Bebek and eat a baked \npotato with all the fixins that can be imagined under the sun, that is \nquite the tasty treat and the view! People like Taksim but I found it a bit \nboring since it's a bit too modern for my liking, I believe that the old \ncity situated around the Bosphorus is probably enough to satisfy one's need \nfor culture.\n\nWhat really shines is Istanbul after dark, as you walk along the Bosphorus, \nits a sea of light and activity, it's incredible.
