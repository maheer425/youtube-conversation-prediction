So the Liquid Terminator trying to kill him so that the \nhumans can't use time travel.\nAnd as for Marty & his parents, Sarah Connor is actually their first \ndaughter, Sarah is Marty's sister, they had to give away her to an \norphanage where she got adopted & raised by different parents. At some \npoint in the 80s Marty & Doc become friends , Doc managed to build first \ntime travel technology, only it's a car. During this time the Liquid \nTerminator is sent to kill John Conor while he's still a baby, but \naccidentally discover Doc Brown, and changes it's objective to Terminate \nDoc Brown, which succeeds causing Marty to go back to 50s, but Doc only \nfaked his death to send him to the past & being a genius Doc managed to \nbuild first weapons strong enough & destroyed the Liquid terminator . Upon \narrival he interrupts his parents first meeting & also meets another \nTerminator (Schwarzenegger) which explains him that SkyNet sent another \nLiquid Terminator to kill Doc Brown since the Delorian is in the hands of \nMarty which means humanity still has a technology for time travel. And the \nthree of them Marty, Doc & Schwarzenegger Terminator manages to terminate \nLiquid Terminator (with the cost of Schwarzenegger Terminator), unite \nMarty's parents & sent Marty back in time, only finding out that Doc is \nAlive. \n\nMarty currently is one of the Leaders of the Humanity, He didn't told John \nConnor that he is his uncle, as for Doc he along Marty survived the \njudgement day but got captured by SkyNet, and was forced to build time \ntravel technology, top prevent it, Doc instead tricked SkyNet & build \ntechnology that can send only live tissues. He died from old age in Skynet \nbefore revealing more.\ufeff",
