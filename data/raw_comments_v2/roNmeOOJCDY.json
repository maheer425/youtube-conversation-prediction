            "text": "+Jack Xhemali I would like to start about by saying that I\u2019m also enjoying \nthis civilized discussion and thank you for your continued dignity and \nrefraining from insult and vulgar language. But to the point (this comment \nmay also be long oops it seems i\u2019ve written a book). The war was massively \nunpopular in the north, for most of the war because it often looked like \nthe south would win. The New York Draft riots attest to such feelings. \nConnecticut was also anti war early on. Also to be noted is the ordeal that \nCongressmen Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio was put through for calling \npresident lincoln on the war aims. Also again, the ruling you speak of goes \nagainst the founding principles cited by lincoln him self and the \ndeclaration of independence. As you said, governments tend not to recognize \npeople who are trying to shake them off. There is a difference however \nbetween properly elected state officials voting to leave the compact that \nthey entered of their own consent, and rebels who are trying to overthrow \nthe elected officials. The civil war was not a case of people trying to \noverthrow legitimate government.\n I will liken it to a marriage (which is also referred to as a union \ncoincidentally). The bride and the groom both legally enter into the \ncontract to be wed to each other, and in the process give up certain rights \nthey both posses. They subject them selves to the whim and will of each \nother and vow not to involve them selves with other people in the same way. \nThey both enter into the agreement of their own consent and can leave by \ntheir own consent if they deem it necessary. If either party chooses, they \ncan leave the union and resume the rights that they forfeited. When they \nsign the contract and become legally bound, they do not forfeit their \ncompetency or right to leave. As I stated, at least two of the states put \nthat into their conditions for signing the constitution. I\u2019m not sure I \nfully understand your analogy about the UN enough to properly respond to it.\nAs you said, the emancipation proclamation was a military measure that \nlincoln used to keep foreign powers from helping the south.  However I take \nissue with your charge that the civil war was specifically about slavery \nfor this reason: at any point during the war, the south could\u2019ve saved \nslavery by returning to the Union. There were many slave states in the \nUnion. Delaware did not ratify the 13th amendment until 1901, 40 years \nafter the war.\nA confederate general (John B. Gordon) made an logy about slavery\u2019s \ninvolvement in the war (he also said that 80% of his men were not slave \nholders or involved in slavery). On slavery he said \"It was the great \npolitical factor around which the passions of the sections had long been \ngathered--the tallest pine in the political forest around whose top the \nfiercest lightnings were to blaze and whose trunk was destined to be \nshivered in the earthquake shocks of war. But slavery was far from being \nthe sole cause of the prolonged conflict. Neither its destruction on the \none hand, nor its defence on the other, was the energizing force that held \nthe contending armies to four years of bloody work. I apprehend that if all \nliving Union soldiers were summoned to the witness-stand, every one of them \nwould testify that it was the preservation of the American Union and not \nthe destruction of Southern slavery that induced him to volunteer at the \ncall of his country. As for the South, it is enough to say that perhaps \neighty per cent. of her armies were neither slave-holders, nor had the \nremotest interest in the institution.\u201d\nAnother person to add to the list of people who said the war was not about \nslavery is the Vermont abolitionist Lysander Spooner who had previously \nadvocated for slave uprisings like john brown. But after the war he wrote a \nseries of essays in defense of the south (Lysander spooner: No treason). He \nsaid \"On the part of the North, the war was carried on, not to liberate \nslaves, but by a government that had always perverted and violated the \nConstitution, to keep the slaves in bondage; and was still willing to do \nso, if the slaveholders could be thereby induced to stay in the Union. The \nprinciple, on which the war was waged by the North, was simply this: That \nmen may rightfully be compelled to submit to, and support, a government \nthat they do not want; and that resistance, on their part, makes them \ntraitors and criminals\u2026 No principle, that is possible to be named, can be \nmore self-evidently false than this; or more self-evidently fatal to all \npolitical freedom. Yet it triumphed in the field, and is now assumed to be \nestablished. If it really be established, the number of slaves, instead of \nhaving been diminished by the war, has been greatly increased; for a man, \nthus subjected to a government that he does not want, is a slave. And there \nis no difference, in principle --- but only in degree --- between political \nand chattel slavery. The former, no less than the latter, denies a man's \nownership of himself and the products of his labor; and [*iv] asserts that \nother men may own him, and dispose of him and his property, for their uses, \nand at their pleasure.\u201d (no treason no.1). At any rate that most of what I \nhave to say on that. Sorry again for the long comment! I am thoroughly \nenjoying this exchange of ideas!",

Anyways back to the point, I wouldn't say it was \nLincoln's friends, it was actually the Democratic party, which was at the \ntime ripped almost in half between the two sides (they had two candidates \nand that in addition to the liberty bell party would have had enough \nelectoral votes to beat Lincoln ironically), that wanted peace between the \ntwo sides and during Lincoln's reelection the Democratic party was running \nunder the policy of ending the Civil War. The Republicans were mostly fully \nentrenched in the war and they didn't want to pull a John Quincy Adams by \nswitching sides at the last minute and losing it all. Also the main reason \nwe went to war was because of slavery. It was decided by an act of Andrew \nJackson (the Supreme Court disagreed with him but that wasn't an issue for \nduring the Civil War) that the U.S. government can invade disobedient \nstates to stop rebellions. I don't remember the exact wording but this is \nclose enough and I'm sure you've read about this act (or you watched the \ncrash course). Think about this like the U.S. or some other big and \npowerful country but lets go with the U.S. because staying on topic is cool \nand say the U.S. wanted to leave the United Nations (Mind you this isn't \neven close but its enough to act as a metaphor so go along with it), if the \nU.S. left all the sanctions, military actions and decisions would all be \ndone without the world's most powerful country and the U.S. gets free reign \nto sanction whoever they wanted since they don't have to worry about \nupsetting the U.N. all that much. They can act out on their own and this is \nhow the North viewed the South (more like Republicans viewing the South but \nthey controlled pretty much every government place so close enough). This \nmetaphor may have actually made my argument more confusing but I'll try to \nend it a bit faster since this is turning out to be WAY too long. Britain \ndidn't formally recognize the U.S. until after we had won just as during \nthe Civil War the Union didn't recognize the succession of the South. This \nis why the South needed more big battles to be won. They needed a Saratoga \nto get support but when Lincoln issued the Proclamation (which didn't \nactually do anything for the slaves but it sounded like it did so everyone \nbought it) it forced Britain out of potentially helping. History is \ndefinitely written by the victors and literally when you look at the Union \ngenerals I'm surprised the North won to be honest. Also both sides thought \nthe war would be quick and like the Mexican War. Neither side was expecting \na long drawn out war and once it started there was already too much \ninvested in the war to draw out. Sorry for the long comment.",

            "text": "+Jack Xhemali Well, firstly it seems that a fair bit of Lincoln's \nconstituents wanted to let the south go peacefully as many newspaper \neditorials would attest. Secondly, nullification seems to be a perfectly \nlegal thing. Not only was the idea introduced by a US president \n(Jefferson), but it was used by states north and south and has been \nsuccessfully used as recently as 2010 (utah nullified federal gun laws \naround that time). Even before south Carolina nullification, the principal \nwas well founded and recognized. Also it's quite odd that lincoln didn't \nrecognize the secession of the confederate states. In 1848, he said \"Any \npeople anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to \nrise up and shake off the existing government and form a new one that suits \nthem better. \u2026\" Aside from his own precedent of being pro secession, \nthere's the fact that the union lincoln fought to preserve was originally \ncreated by secession from Britian. Added to that, both Virginia and New \nYork's ratifications of the constitution included writs of secession (New \nYork's wording was slightly more blunt than Virginia's). Now it is true \nthat the union may have fallen apart, as the south payed 2/3rds of the \nfederal budget in taxes at the time the war broke out. In the worst case \nthe north would have had to convert to a free trade zone to compete with \nthe south economically. So in that sense it is true that there is no way \nLincoln could want to let the south go peacefully. but in no way was he \nright in trying to stop them. As in (specifically in the case of virginia) \nHe literally broke written binding agreements that were law.  ",

Each has a distinct \nbasis for the claim, with Georgia being the first to receive a charter to \nfunction as public university, North Carolina being the first to open to \nthe public, and William & Mary having the oldest founding date of any \ncurrently public university .Located in Athens, Georgia, the University of \nGeorgia received its charter from the state in 1785, making the University \nof Georgia the first state-chartered public university in the United \nStates. As a result of this distinction UGA brands itself as the \n\"birthplace of the American system of higher education.\" A site was \nselected for the university, and it began admitting students, in 1801.[1]\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill[edit]\nThe state of North Carolina chartered the University of North Carolina in \n1789, and construction on the campus began in 1793. The university was the \nfirst public university in the country to admit students when it opened in \n1795. Graduating its first class in 1798, UNC was the only public \ninstitution to confer degrees in the 18th century.[2]\n\nThe College of William & Mary[edit]\nNow a public university, The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, \nVirginia was founded by royal charter in 1693, making it the second oldest \ncollege or university in the United States, after Harvard University. The \ncollege severed formal ties with Britain after the colonies declared \nindependence, but remained private until financial troubles forced its \nclosure after the Civil War. It re-opened in 1888, but continued financial \ntroubles forced it to accept funding from the Commonwealth of Virginia \nbeginning in 1906. It has been public ever since.[3]",

Below \nis an excerpt from \"A People's History of the United States\" by Howard \nZinn. \n\n\"In his 1858 campaign in Illinois for the Senate against Stephen Douglas, \nLincoln spoke \ndifferently depending on the views of his listeners (and also perhaps \ndepending on how close it was to the election). Speaking in northern \nIllinois in July (in Chicago), he said: \n \nLet us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man, this \nrace and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they \nmust be placed in an inferior position. Let us discard all these things, \nand unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more \nstand up declaring that all men are created equal. \n \nTwo months later in Charleston, in southern Illinois, Lincoln told his \naudience: \n \nI will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing \nabout in any way the social and political equality of the white and black \nraces (applause); that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making \nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to \nintermarry with white people.. . . \n \nAnd inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there \nmust be the \nposition of superior and inferior, and J as much as any other man am in \nfavor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.\"\ufeff",

            "text": "To be honest I don't know if I know enough to comment very intelligently on \nWirtz. I'll the few thoughts I can though :).\n\nAlthough I might criticize Wirtz, we should begin by examining whether or \nnot the atrocious conditions of Andersonville were in fact, as Wirtz \nclaimed, unavoidable. This may provide us with the answer as to whether or \nnot the Confederate government bore responsibility.\n\nI can say that the primary excuse used by Wirtz and Confederate Apologists \nfor the condition of the camps was that the Rebel guards suffered just as \ngreatly as the Union prisoners. This is nonsense. Confederate fatalities at \nAndersonville were a fraction of the number suffered by Union veterans. So \nlet's dismiss that excuse.  \n\nThe acquisition of food of course was a problem throughout the Confederacy. \nThis was due to many different problems. Inefficiency in the Confederate \ngovernment, failure of individual states to work cooperatively with the \ngovernment, the poor rail-road infrastructure of the South and the efficacy \nof Sherman's \"Hard War\" policy. Thus, perhaps we can find an excuse for the \nConfederates.\n\nHowever, it must be considered that the Confederates had a duty to exchange \ntheir prisoners as fast as possible because they were unable to maintain \nthem humanely. Why then, did the Rebels fail to exchange their prisoners? \nThe immediate answer to this question is that the Federal Armies under \nUlysses S. Grant had cancelled the prisoner exchange cartel. It would \nappear then, on the face of the issue, that it was the Union's fault. The \nUnion would not exchange troops, forcing the South to care for more \nprisoners then it could. \n\nI think that this is an incomplete conclusion however, because we need to \nexamine why General Grant made the decision to end exchanges. \n\nAlthough the ending of exchanges was beneficial to the Union (it was easier \nfor the Union to replace soldiers then for the Confederacy), this was not \nthe reason Grant made this decision. Grant's decision was based on two \nfactors; Confederates failing to observe their paroles, and Confederate \ntreatment of Black soldiers and their white officers. \n\nThe exchange/parole system (in which captured soldiers were allowed to \nreturn home until properly exchanged), was the humane system of capture \nused by the armies in the war for most of the conflict. It was not always \nfollowed, but was generally observed. At both Vicksburg and Appomattox, \nGrant paroled the 30 000 man armies captured in both respective \nengagements. \n\nThe problem with this arrangement is that it relied on an honour system \nwhich the Rebels did not always abide by. Often, the South would take \nparoled soldiers back into the ranks, or even force them back into the \nranks, without any exchange having taken place. This egregious breach in \nthe agreement made Grant's suspension of exchange highly justifiable. \n\nMore problematic however, was the treatment of the USCT. Ulysses S Grant \nwas one of the great champions of the USCT. He fought to have them placed \nin his armies and was careful with their lives. In fact, the reason \nFerarro's USCT division did not lead the attack on Petersburg on July 30, \n1864 was because Grant feared that leading the attack with black troops \nwould give the appearance back home that the men were being used to shield \nwhite troops. Grant cared for the black men of his army and after the war \npushed aggressively for their civil rights. \n\nIt is not hard to imagine then Grant's outrage at the horrific treatment of \nblack soldiers by the Confederates. Confederate policy after 1863 was to \nkill all USCT in uniform outright (this was exemplified at Fort Wagner, \nOlustee, Fort Pillow, and The Crater). Any that were captured could be, and \noften were, sold as slaves. The officers of these men were often treated \npoorly, given little food and little shelter. Grant demanded that black \ntroops and their white officers be treated as soldiers and given treatment \nexpected by humane captors. The Confederates refused. Grant threatened to \nend the prisoner exchange system if the Rebels did not comply. The Rebels \ndid not comply. It was, therefore, the choice of the Rebels to end prisoner \nexchange. Their unwillingness to treat black soldiers humanely was the \ncause of the end of prisoner exchange. Their inability to care for captured \nUnion soldiers should have forced them to acquiesce and end the \nmistreatment of black soldiers so that they could release Union prisoners \nin return for Confederate ones. Instead, the Rebels insisted on keeping \nUnion captives they could not care for in order to murder black Union \nsoldiers. \n\nI therefore submit that if the Rebels were overburdened with Union captives \n(which they were) it was their own fault. Grant did what he had to do to \nprotect his most vulnerable (and bravest) troops. The Rebels could have \ndone the right thing. Instead they chose to starve captured Union troops to \ndo the wrong thing. \n\nSo in the end, I blame the Confederate government. They failed to recognize \ntheir poor infrastructure made it a moral duty to resume and uphold the \nprisoner exchange program. Instead they cheated the system and failed to \nmeet the Union's reasonable demands. \n\nA point on Wirtz though. Many of the men in his concentration camp died \nbecause they had no shelter. Not more then 100 yards beyond the gates of \nthe camp there was a forest providing the wood that would have saved the \nlives of many prisoners. Wirtz never let them cut down the trees, make \nshelters, and collect fire wood. I think this is worth consideration. ",

            "text": "+Ginger Davis I just realized I forgot to answer this lovely what if \nquestion!\n\nI'm recovering from some minor surgery and a bit lurgey so I hope my answer \nmakes sense. lol\n\nLike all counter-factual questions, I can only offer speculation and \nsupposition. It is however a great deal of fun to indulge in what ifs, so \nI'll try to provide an answer. \n\nBecause of my aforementioned post surgical lurginess I might keep this \nbrief lol. Sorry about that :P. \n\nI think we can begin by examining a portion of your question which is, in \nmy opinion, extremely important. That is, that the combination of Taney and \nBreckrenidge would have been a dream come true for the partisans of the \nSouth. This, I believe, is completely correct. Such a team would have \nensured the success of not only the LeCompton Constitution in Kansas but \nalso would have advocated for a protection clause in the Constitution for \nslavery to be vouchsafed under the 5th amendment in all territories. This \nState's Rights Principle was the must egregious aspect of Taney's decision \nand was the goal of the South. Such a decision would have ensured that all \nfuture territories would form into slave states. \n\nFurtherstill, as McPherson argues (in either Battle Cry of Freedom or his \nessay on the Slave Power Conspiracy in \"This Mighty Scourge\" I can't \nremember which right now lol) Taney would likely have used the Lemon case \n(a case concerning the sojourn of slaves into free states) to justify a \nprotection clause protecting slavery in the Free States. This would have \nrevoked not only the Personal Liberty Laws of the North but also the \nFreedom Principles and Abolition itself. Essentially it would only allow \nindividual states to abolish the domestic slave trade within the state, and \nnot slavery. It is without doubt that Breckenridge would have done his \nutmost to see this finding solidified by the executive (likely by the same \nPosse Comitatus used by both Pierce and Breckeridge to enforce the Fugitive \nSlave Act). \n\nTherefore we have, what seems, a real Southern victory. Here though, my \nfriend, is where things become truly slippery. Elizabeth Varon points out \nin \"Disunion: The Coming of the Civil War\" that these victories for the \nSouth were necessarily phyrric ones. The Gag Rule, Annexation of Texas, \nAnnexation of Texas as a single slave state, The Mexican War, overturning \nof the Wilmot Proviso, The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildalgo, the revocation of \nthe Missouri Compromise, the revocation of the Northwest Ordinance, Popular \nSovereignty, Dredd Scott, et cetera were all Southern victories for the \nextension of Slavery that outraged the North. It was these events that \nsplit the Whig Party into the Liberty, Free Soil, Americans and ultimately \nunited them into the Republicans. Furthermore, these outrages and their \ndeference to slave power isolated and marginalized much of the otherwise \npro-slavery Democrats (such as Stephen Douglas and David Wilmot) and caused \nthe great Democratic Schism that ensured the election of Lincoln. Therefore \nSouthern victories galvanized the North and led to Southern political \ndefeat in the Political Revolution of 1860. I therefore submit that such \nfurther outrages would have hastened and deepened the Democratic Spit and \ndriven more men to the Republicans. The South would face greater and \nangrier opposition.\n\nThere is another facet to this. Do you recall how I argued earlier that the \nSouth attempted to use Jefferson Davis to appear benign in order to win \nover the powerful border slave states? These border slave states, as I \nexplained earlier, felt that bellicose Southern partisanship for slavery's \nexpansion was as much to blame for Disunion as were the \"Black \nRepublicans.\" How would, these states feel if the Disunion was proceeded by \neven greater hostility by the Southern Slave Power. How many more \nVirginians would have, like President Zachary Taylor, converted from \nsympathy to the South as the aggrieved party to seeing them as the \naggressor? Consider how aggressive a Breckrenridge-Taney team might have \nbeen. With those two controlling the judiciary and executive, could any \nmoderate conditional Unionist (such as the Virginia Secession Convention) \nignore the potent role of Southern Fire eaters in secession? Is it not \npossible that, seeing their erring sisters as so aggressive in the body of \nPresident Breckrenidge, Virginia may not have chosen to secede? \n\nWhat happens in this case? First, Virginia was, bar none, the single most \npowerful state to join the Confederacy. It provided the best ironworks the \nConfederacy controlled and was one of its most reliable sources of troops. \nImagine how crippled the Confederacy would be without it. The state that \noffered the most soldiers to the South (but also had the highest desertion \nrate) was North Carolina. However, North Carolina seceded with great \nanxiety. ot only would its anxiety be increased likely beyond critical mass \nif the Slave Power appeared more bellicose, but it almost certainly would \nnot have seceded without Virginia. Virginia's secession made North \nCarolina's secession a fait accompli, as it was effectively surrounded by \nConfederate States. Furthermore, if Virginia remained loyal, North Carolina \nwould have been a frontline state. This is not an enticing propostion for a \nsection already tepid about secession.\n\nThus the Confederacy loses two necessary states. Now, what of Maryland and \nKentucky? Though neither officially seceded, they each contributed greatly \nto the Confederacy. Could they have done so without the geographical \nconnection provided to the Confederacy via Virginia? \n\nI believe that without the symbolic secession of Old Virginia (the \nunofficial leader of the Old South) Arkansas and Tennessee would also \nlikely have failed to join, making assistance from Missouri also unlikely, \nthough this is purely supposition on my part. Interestingly,one of the \nRebel national anthems \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" pays homage to this influence \nof Virginia in its third stanza. \n\nWithout Virginia, there is one other important factor lost to the South. \nThat is the officers that Virginia provided. Most conspicuously Thomas \nJohnathan \"Stonewall\" Jackson, Joseph E Johnston, and Robert E. Lee. \nWhether or not Lee would have succeeded in the war as the Northern Army of \nVirginia's commander is another debate entirely (it should be noted that \nMcDowell failed because his plan of attack was to complex for his green \ntroops. This was the same operational mistake made by Lee in Cheat Mountain \nand the Seven Days Battles). Either way, he was absolutely vital to the \nSouth and without him to serve as both a military leader and unifying \ncharacter, the South would have collapsed sooner. \n\nWhat we have therefore, is a substantially weaker South. Lacking the troops \nof North Carolina and Virginia, the railroads of Tennessee, its greatest \ncommanders, et cetera. I propose that the South would therefore have, like \nin all other such political contests before the war, found defeat in \nvictory. The South would have isolated its friends and emboldened its \nenemies. This may very well have resulted in a quick Union victory, as the \nSeven original states of the Confederacy lacked the power necessary to \nachieve military victory over an even stronger North.\n\nWe face one more problem here. If the war was ended rapidly, say in 1862, \nthen it could never have become the \"conflict so fundemental and \nastounding\" as Lincoln spoke of it in the Second Inaugural. In that \naddress, Lincoln states that no one (or at least very few) believed that \nthe fundamental problem of the war (slavery) should be solved by the war. \nMerely the extension of slavery would be the question answered. Were the \nwar a short conflict, then he likely would have been right. The war would \nbe over to soon for the issue of emancipation to become generally palatable \nor militarily necessary, and the representation of slavery in the Northern \ncoalition would have made emancipation untenable. Here therefore, the South \nmay have had victory in defeat. Their Confederacy would die so soon that \nslavery would survive.\n\nThat was fun :p.  ",

            "text": "Excellent question. I'll try to answer it if I can. \n\nFirst, its important to understand that there are two Democratic Parties in \n1860, the Northern Democrats and the Southern Democrats. The Southern \nDemocrats broke from the Northern Democrats after the disastrous Charleston \nDemocratic Convention over the establishment of a slavery protection clause \nconcerning the territories to be drafted into the United States \nConstitution. Therefore, there were in fact two Democratic Nominees, \nStephen Douglas of the Northern Democrats (who advocated Popular \nSovereignty in the territories) and John C. Breckenridge (who advocated for \ncomplete protection of slavery in all territories or secession). \n\nJefferson Davis, though a Southern Democrat, was initially less willing to \nuse Secession as a threat. He actually attempted at first to reunify the \nDemocrats. These actions made him unfit for the Southern Democratic ticket. \nWhat the Southern Democrats wanted in 1860 was a fire eater. Absolute \nacceptance of slavery throughout the Federal Territories (and therefore new \nstates) or Disunion. Jefferson Davis did not meet this standard.\n\nDavis did, however, advocate that the Federal Government was compelled to \nprotect states' rights and property in the territories and therefore all \nterritories had to be open to slavery and  form into slave states. This was \nunacceptable to the Northern Democrats, who wished to potentially open the \nnew territories to slavery during their formation into states, but only if \nthe state population approved of such an act via referendum. \n\nBoth of these views were, of course, contrary to the Constitution, which \nclearly states under Article I (Section 8 I believe) that the Federal \ngovernment will organize the formation of states and have jurisdiction over \nthe territories. But, I digress.\n\nObviously, Davis's views made him a bit to moderate for the Southern \nDemocrats, and to extreme for the Northern Democrats. Thus, nomination of \nhim, though considered by the Southern wing, was abandoned. However, when \nthe first seven seceded states convened in Montgomery Alabama (the first \ncapital of the Confederacy) in 1861, the delegates acted in the interest of \nattracting the 8 slave border states to the Confederate cause, whose \nparticipation was vital to success. Many conditional Unionists in Virginia, \nthough they subscribed to the principles of slavery's extension, believed \nthat firebrands like Breckenridge were as much to blame as the \"Black \nRepublican\" agitators (Anti-Slavery) for secession. As such, it would have \nappeared abhorrent to these Conditional Unionists to elect Breckenridge to \nthe office of the President of the Confederacy.\n\nIt is at this point that Davis rapidly becomes the darling candidate. His \nloyalty to the South and Slavery never wavered, and he accepted Disunion \nwith reluctance. His ascendancy to the Confederacy would give to the \nconditional Unionists of the Upper South the view that the Confederacy was \nattempting to be moderate, and being guided by reason rather then the \nimpassioned and ill-conceived voices of violent sectional radicalism. This, \nas we know, was successful. It should also be noted that Jefferson Davis \nwas a decorated and soldier and since the Confederacy expected war, they \nwanted a war president. \n\nI hope my answer helps a little :). ",
