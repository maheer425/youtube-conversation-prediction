Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n\nMultiplication and division share a precedence in the order of operations. \n When you're faced with an equation that presents both multiplication and \ndivision operators you must solve them from left to right.  Also, a \ndivision sign is implicitly bounded by any operators on either side of the \nnumerator or denominator.  You can make it explicit, like the video \nsuggests, by adding parenthesis.\n\nThat's all just convention though, followed by most people as far as I can \ntell.  You can certainly use a different order of operations if you want, \nbut your answers won't line up with the rest of humanity.  Like the video \nsays, you should try to make your intent more clear by using parens \nliberally.\n\nLast, 4a is not the same as writing 4*a.  When a constant is used as a \ncoefficient, the constant and the variable become a single term.  There's \nnot an implied operator like there would be in 4(a) So, for example:\n(I'll add parens and implied operators to make it clear what's going on)\n\n4a/2a = (4a)/(2a) = 2a\n4a/2*a = ((4a)/(2))*(a) = 2a^2\n4a/2(a) = ((4a)/(2))*(a) = 2a^2",

The video was so popular it made $2000 \nin 4 days.
