When a real G in the crowd is eyes on you the stage is the only place \nyou can thump your chest and attempt to tear the club up.  sic.  (the stage \nis no longer a neutral hollowed ground)  So if you cant grab the mic and \nonly have eyes and words for the ladies and let the G's know your giving \nrespect by not getting all these soldiers riled up and wanna act a fool in \na sardine can.  If you and your team can't bring a piece offering for all \nthe dead homies, young one's who lost there role models to murder or the \ncrack.  In the city you performing in,  then dont even go there.  If you \ncunt send your boys to hook up with the shot callers and donate some \nscholarship money to the gifted athlete, bookworm. (thats what cred is \nabout homie) then point that gat at 40 dolla hat and pull the trigger.   \nStupid motherfuckers  declining murder rates and alliances got the pigs \nwondering,  so when 1 marine took out like 8 cops the grand dragon was like \nmy death squads are no match for a person trained by the worlds best \nkilling instructors.  Bangers were taught how to control channel there \nanger and realized boom boom soul brother from another mother taint my \nenemy,  its those towel headed sand n******.    wow I wonder where that \nwords root of organ originated from.   So they changed the fucken game,  \nnow no person with a criminal record can join the military.  Real talk and \nyall with your little chains and shit.  But I'm an dickhole I dont live in \na black civil war battle zone,  where the land grabs and shystie \nmotherfuckers almost started the race war with there destruction of the us \nbanking system economy destabilizing and after the fuckers had the bag and \nwere walking out the door,  there homies on the hill said hold on you didnt \nget all of it,  End the bc war or the kkkops and military are going to do \nit for you,  that's why there brainwashing the country with all these \nmurders the cops are doing.  For you in the zones it aint no thing been \ngoing on for years,  not because you joined a gang and wrecked shop,  naw \nthey told you to.  and all yall  murdering thugs wonder why those of us not \nliving anywhere near a zone are like \"Oh well thats how they are\"  B.S. the \nman like to start wars,  its kill or be killed for some and die two years \nafter retirement for others. i.e. taxes yo. and get arrested for mass fruad \npyramid shit on your 98 th birthday for the rest.  word is born.\ufeff",
