Often, infrastructure, capital and technical knowledge are less \nthan ideal and the types of industries which the underdeveloped areas can \ncreate may not always be easy to maintain. \n(3)   National defense \u2013 National Security depends upon many factors, \nincluding a community of economically healthy nations devoted to living in \nharmony and tied together by mutually beneficial trade. Thus, this realm \ndoesn't always justify tariff protection.\n(4)  Retaliation and bargaining \u2013 We see that Putin and Russia has been \nbrought down by the economic sanctions apart from tariffs....

It just so happens \nthat outsourcing is an extremely cost effective business model. It would be \nincredibly difficult to decrease the expense of manufacturing in America \nbecause the cost of living is much higher than in other countries, so \nwhatever way you slice it to live in America most people need to be payed a \nlot more than they might in other countries. Some ways the negatives of \nglobalization could potentially be counteracted lies within the countries \nwe're outsourcing to. If they had more strict regulations to ensure decent \nworking conditions, outsourcing might be more expensive, though even if it \nisn't, improving the conditions of the working class is definitely a \npositive thing. Another alternative would be for America to impose \nregulations restricting how much a company can outsource, this of course \nwould seem very \"Big Government\" and most Americans wouldn't like that. \nWhat I can see happening is it fixing itself organically. As more and more \nAmericans become aware of outsourcing, local businesses and products made \nin the U.S. become more appealing and become a selling point. If enough \npeople start choosing to buy the American made stuff over the outsourced \nstuff, thanks to capitalism it will encourage businesses to make things in \nAmerica. Due to capitalism, businesses go wherever the profits are, if \nthere is a cultural shift resulting in more profits coming out of locally \nproduced goods, that's where they'll go.",
