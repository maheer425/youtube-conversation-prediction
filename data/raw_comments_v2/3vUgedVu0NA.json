Also, by switching to hybrid crops, we all lose \nbiodiversity as breed after breed becomes lost to us in favor of the hybrid \nseeds. Also, hybrid seeds only work once. After the crop is harvested, the \nseeds cannot be saved and used again; instead the farmer has to buy more \nseeds, meaning that the farmer must get enough western money to buy the \nseeds again, though he/she might prefer to trade their goods or use local \ncurrencies. This sounds amazing in theory, but in practice all it does is \nforce farmers to be dependent on western businesses, which is not a \nsustainable practice nor will it allow development of an agricultural \nsystem in the country. \ufeff",
