But it would make too much noise if we opened the door that \nwent to the toilet, so we went out a little tiny door behind us so I could \ngo pee in the bushes. My mom went with me and for the first time ever I \npeed standing up, in front of the bushes. Then on the parking lot between a \nprimary school and the church this car turned on and the flashlight were \npointed at me and my mom. It was embarrassing. So embarrassing I almost \nnever pee in the bushes again. Heck, I rarely pee while standing up! What \nis wrong with me?!\n\nThe second one was while I was a few years older. It was summer holiday, \nand I went to Luxembourg. On the drive back home I said halfway the ride \n(Belgium) that I needed to pee. My mom didn't want to stop and go to a \nrestaurant so she made me pee, again, in some bushes. Right behind the \nbushes was another road, and behind THAT was a busy centre. So I took my \npants down (my zipper was stuck) and peed. But I did a whoopsie and it went \nall over my underpants. So my mom lifted me up into the air, pulled my \npants off of my legs, followed by my underpants, and then put my pants \nback. I had a feeling people could see me. For the whole ride back to my \ncountry I had no underpants.\ufeff",

So, a \nlittle more than a week ago, April 19th, I fell down the stairs- on my way \nto the ladies room at church- just before the service. Went to the ER, with \nwhat looked like a broken leg. So I'm there in a bed in ER, sobbing from \npain, and I had to pee. *Still* had to, because that was what I'd been on \nmy way to do when I fell! Well, they wouldn't let me out of the bed because \nwe were still waiting for the guy from xray. And the need just got worse, \nuntil I finally had to say something to the nurse. So she got a bedpan for \nme. Well, I'd never used one before. And I was still dressed. Imagine this- \na nurse and my roommate, pulling the Sunday clothes- which included nylons \nand f*cking *SPANX*- off of this sobbing middle-aged lady, while in a \nhospital bed. And not touching the leg.\n\n*Then* there was the little problem of trying to pee- it's been almost 50 \nyears since I learned that pee goes in the potty and no where else. So I \nhad the pan, and I had to go, but I couldn't go! The nurse had to turn on \nthe tap to remind my body what to do...\n\nOh- and while everyone said 'Damn, that's a broken leg!', when the films \ncame back they were all amazed. Not broken. But I do have a serious \nperiosteal hematoma, and I'll be off my feet for 6-8 weeks while that \nheals. Leg looks and hurts like hell, and after a week, I'm bored out of my \nskull.\ufeff",

By then I was VERY desperate to go to \nthe toilet that I asked again and she replied with \"We've only got 4 \nminutes left!\" I said I was very desperate and she said \"Well you're just \ngoing to have to wet yourself!\" Infront of everyone and they all laught at \nme. About 30 seconds before the bell went my bladder decided that I \ncouldn't hold it any longer. I'm just glad I was wearing trousers because \nif I was wearing a skirt that would have been contraversial and I would of \nhad to just pee like a dog. I just stood there, letting my trousers get \nsoaked with pee. There were little drips of pee on the floor. LUCKILY the \nonly person who noticed it was the person next to me, but he didn't tell \nanyone. As the bell went I rushed into the bathroom in my pee soaked \ntrousers, locked the door and took of my trousers, not knowing what to do. \nI had a lift off my dad who I couldn't tell, so I had to do the best a \ncould to get rid of the pee. I rung out my trousers into the toilet but \nthat still didn't really work, so I tried again. I was left with very damn \nwith pee black trousers to put on. I rushed to my dad's car and as soon as \nI got home I changed.\n\n\nWorst day everrrrr \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude12\ufeff",

I knew I couldn't, \nbut i thought it'd be nice of me to lie and tell her I could. Literally \nseconds after I told her I could hold it, I peed my pants. A torrent of pee \nthat could only be compared to Niagara Falls started pouring through the \nholes of the cart. Every eye in the store was on me in horror as my \ndripping pee filled the otherwise silent room with the sound of my dignity \ncrashing to the floor. As if that weren't bad enough, I had to wear my \nyounger brother's spare diaper the whole ride home because I had no extra \nclothes with.\n\n2: I want to say this was several years ago because it was so embarrassing, \nbut it was actually last week. This guy and I were having a great night \ntogether and decided it would be a good idea to \"finish\" the night off with \na \"little\" vodka. We both ended up getting EXTREMELY drunk. Now before I go \nany further, I think it's necessary to let you all know that I really like \nthis guy and we'd confessed our feelings shortly prior to what's about to \nhappen. I was puking more than I thought was possible, him standing right \nnext to me and comforting me, when I was overcome with the urge to pee. \nWithout even thinking, I casually pull my pants down and begin to pee on \nthe ground, all while making eye contact with him. He asks \"are you \npeeing?\" And I was just like \"mhmmm\", as if it were no big deal. And only \nminutes later, i kissed him (terribly) :O. He turned out to be a really \nsweet guy though and we always joke about it now, but in the midst of my \nmonumental hangover the next morningI was ready to die of humiliation. \ufeff",
