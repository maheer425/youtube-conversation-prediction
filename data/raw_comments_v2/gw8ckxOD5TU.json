This Bunghole puts on his facade of a pathetic little \nworm, remorseful of his \"one stupid mistake.\" The judge saw through him and \ngave him the maximum sentence, and rightly so. What is most telling to me \nis that he only put on the act when it was his turn to speak. Most of the \ntime, he said nothing and his expression was all but blank. Once the \nsentence was announced, and he couldn't avoid that maximum sentence, he \ndidn't even bother trying to fake his remorse. I know a sociopath when I \nsee one, and even if he WASN'T one of them, considering the evil he is \nguilty of, he still needs to be put away.
