            "text": "Hi again +Henrik Simonsen. \nBefore learning how to carve on skis you'd want to have a mastered a strong \ndynamic parallel turn. \n\nMake sure you have a good strong skiing stance. Feet hip width apart, \nstanding centred with your hands in front.  If your stance is too narrow \nyou'll easily tip over and loose balance. If it is too wide then it'll be \ndifficult to roll both edges on together.    Have a look at the 7 Sins film \nand see if there is anything familiar: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n19QmFC2qVc&list=PLA893DD2FE6198306&index=11\n\nTo start out with get up a bit of speed on a gentle slope where you have \nspace, feel comfortable and are in control. Try rolling the edges over \ngradually, nothing is rushed.  Try small bits at a time and build it up, \nrolling the edges over a little more each time.  \n\nYou'll need enough speed to allow this to happen but not too much that you \nfeel out of control.  Ski within you limits and as we always say get the \nbasics right first and it will make the rest of your progression flow much \neasier. \n\nHopefully these pointers help you learn how to carve on skis.\nCheers",

The skier/instructor shows little to no upper body coordination \n(in this and other videos) and basically leans uphill to establish any edge \nangles. The concept of leaning uphill while square to the skis and leading \nwith the outside arm and inside ski (versus counter acting and counter \nbalancing with an actively tipping, lightened, and pulled back inside foot) \nwill only lead to terminal skills that will fail in more advanced skiing. \nThis is the way the PSIA tried to make us teach about 20 years ago. There \nare much better models out there. Check out Harald Harb videos or even \nWorld Cup videos of Marcel Hirscher or Anna Fenninger for comparison and \ndecide for yourself. This whole series is unfortunately flawed.\ufeff",

A skier's boot setup must be accurate \nfor him or her to be able to get on edge and carve as efficiently as Darren \nis doing in this video.  By setup I am mostly referring to the cuff \nadjustment and sole cant (if required) to achieve a 0.5-1.5 degree inside \nbiase from a flat on the snow ski.  A large number of skiers at all levels \nare unaware of their own setup.  If your boots are biased to ride the ski \non the outside edge (or way too much on inside) - and LOTS of folks suffer \nfrom one of these hindrances, you will plateau on your learnings and find \nit very difficult to achieve a carving edge.  Mainly because the outside \nski in a turn will require too far a distance for the ankle and knee to \ntravel to the inside to be efficiently and easily put up on edge.  Darren's \nsubtle moves to carve can only be achieved thru a proper cant setup.  So, \nif you're stuck in skidding and can't seem to get to this carving place, \nhave your setup checked by a qualified bootfitter.  And again, Thanks \nDarren for this series...I hope my teaching is as clear to my students as \nyours is to me.\n((\n ))\n((\n ))\ufeff",

Because the ski has \nsidecut, makes it bend when put on edge and the ski will follow a curved \npath in the snow. By doing so, your turns become more round, you can take \nturns at higher speeds (no slowing down by skidding), they require less \neffort. You'll ski more efficiently.I don't know all the technical stuff \nand the forces which apply, I only know how to do it and how to teach it :) \nAnd: when becoming more advanced and you feel that first rebound at the end \nof a turn, it's heaven :) Very addictive. And yes, you can switch faster \nbetween edges, therefore being very useful in short turns. The forces which \nare created by your movements and the ski make the transitions fast and \nefficient.

I \nprogressively increase the pressure throughout the turns with a high-low \nmovement and weight balance. Towards the end of my turn, in the steering \nphase, pressure on my ski's is approx. 80-20. In the transitions phase, \npressure is gradually and progressively shifted towards my future outside \nski. by the time my ski's are pointed downhill, it's 50/50. Of course this \nis dependent on the type op turn. When I do long carved turns, I almost put \n100% of my weight on the outside ski, otherwise, centripetal force will \nthrow my body out of the turn :) For years I skied on 1 ski all the time, \nputting all my weight on the outside ski. The inside ski was basically \nhanging there. The day my instructor and examinator started doing routines \non skiing on both ski's, a whole new world opened up :) Transitions happen \nmuch faster, because your losing less time on shifting weight, the inside \nski also gripped, balance improved, stance improved, no more lifting the \ninside ski to start the next turn, etc. Style improved too :) So basically, \nin my experience, the slower I go, there's less shifting of weight. The \nfaster I go, it's necessary to put a lot of weight on the outside ski, to \nresist centripetal force. I'm now the lowest level ski instructor.

Diagnosing and correcting issues is impossible with that sort of \ninstruction. The best way to teach is to model a few turns, and then have \nyour students ski down one at a time such that you may critique and advise, \nbut this rarely happens. Currently, I am struggling to get my inside ski \ncarving as deeply as my outside ski,  because I am an old \"A-Frame\" racer \nfrom the 70's. The best tips I'm working with are: Bow-legged inside leg \nand transfer all weight to the inside ski about half way through the turn. \nWhat do you have for me?",

There is no need to droll on.
