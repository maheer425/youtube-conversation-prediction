            "text": " \nProtons are not being recognized for what they actually are; Anti-matter. \nThey were made by adding energy to Positrons, in the past, when they were \ninside of a Quasar. Everybody agrees that Positrons are Anti-matter. \nTherefore if Protons were made from Positrons, then they are Anti-matter \nalso. So then almost all of the universe around us is Anti-matter (because \nthe Proton is so much bigger than the Electron). The Electron is Matter. \nElectron/Positron pairs were created from energy inside of a Quasar. Then \nenergy was added to the Positron to convert it into a Proton. Then these \ntwo were expelled from the Quasar. These became Hydrogen, then Stars, then \neverything else. As evidence that what I am saying is true, let me explain \nthe cause of  another mysterious happening. Large Stars explode in a \nSuper-Nova when the centers of these Stars become sufficiently hot to \nconvert Electrons into Anti-Protons. These Anti-Protons annihilate with \nProtons making it hotter and therefore converting more Electrons into \nAnti-Protons in a chain reaction which causes the Star to explode. Nothing \nbut a Matter/Anti-Matter reaction is powerful enough to cause a Super-Nova \nStar explosion. But the whole Star is made of Matter. So then where is the \nAnti-Matter coming from? It is being made from the Electrons. Electrons are \nbeing converted into Anti-Protons. This is the only way to have a \nMatter/Anti-Matter reaction occur inside of a Star. So if Electrons can be \nconverted into Anti-Protons, then Positrons can be converted into Protons. \nSo then Protons are actually Anti-Matter, even though by definition they \nare considered to be Matter, because by definition, the \"stuff\" around us \nis Matter. But this definition needs to be changed, because both Electrons \nand Protons can't both be Matter. (That would be like saying that both \nElectrons and Positrons are both Matter.) So then one or the other needs to \nbe redefined as Anti-Matter. With things defined the way they are now, you \ncome across the unanswerable question, \"Where's the Anti-Matter?\" You can't \ncreate Matter without also creating Anti-Matter at the same time. And the \nwhole Universe is made of Matter, so then where's the Anti-Matter? The \nProton is the Anti-Matter. It was made from a Positron, which is \nAnti-Matter. No more mystery. The Anti-Matter is the Proton.\ufeff",

And more important, what if we have \nalready observed matter/antimatter annihilations on a cosmic scale?\n\nGamma-ray bursts. Flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic \nexplosions. All of them were observed in distant galaxies, meaning that \nthey happened a long time in the past. Most of them (the long bursts) are \nconsistent with the model of a supernova or hypernova that collapses to \nform a neutron star, quark star, or black hole.\nAnd then, there are the short bursts. Well, what if the short bursts are \ncaused by matter/antimatter annihilations? So, we would not see any \nmatter/antimatter annihilation in our galaxy because it has already \nhappened, billions of years ago, leaving only the residual matter to be \nseen. Other galaxies might have had an excess of antimatter instead of \nmatter, so, when the annihilation took place, they only left the residual \nantimatter!

The only \nway to get a meaningful answer is renormalization. This is a complicated \nprocess (that doesn't always work) where the infinites are removed by \npinning your solution to an energy scale, for instance. This can (but \ndoesn't have to) involve things like infrared cutoffs (meaning removal of \nvery low frequency solutions) high energy cutoffs, renormalization of the \ncoupling constants etc.\n\nGR gives you a straight answer (though not an obvious one). For black \nholes, where one would like to use the Schwarzschild metric you notice that \nthere is a mathematical singularity at the event horizon. So you have to \nuse more complicated Kuskal coordinates (for instant). But then you can \ncalculate what happens if a photon flies into it, tries to escape it, how \ncharged and/or rotating black holes behave, what happens int black hole \ncollisions.\n\nIf you simply use GR and a covariant formulation of Maxwell's equations \n(for instant) you can calculate just fine everything that happens in and \naround black holes. The singularity in the center is still a problem, but \nwhere are not talking about that one.\n\nBut if you want to use quantum field theory to predict the quantum effects \nat the horizon you run into the problem of renormalization again. This time \ngravity is causing it. The simplest way around it would be if someone could \ntell you a theory of quantum gravity, where you could find out how to \nrenormalize your theory. But nobody knows such a theory. So you end up with \nthat you don't know how to properly extract a solution from your equations.\n\nAll this has nothing to do with equations or math breaking down. I'm not \nsure how familiar you are with math and physics but you find equations \n\"breaking down\" is some assumption that went into constructing the equation \nis no longer fullfilled and the equations simply does not work anymore. For \ninstance when you want to solve a singularity with GR. Or when you want to \ncalculate electromagnetic waves in Newtonian mechanics.\nMath doesn't break down. I'm not aware of a single example of \"math \nbreaking down\". A particular approach for a problem might not work, but \nthat doesn't mean some other approach won't solve the problem.\n\nI'm not sure you made a smart choice changing your opinion against the ones \nof the experts in the field. This also has nothing to do with semantics. \nWhat scientific evidence did you consider that was so strong that you \nchanged your mind? Or did you just go on a hunch?",

            "text": "+Richard Garnache\nHm, I'm not sure a lot of people would agree with you.\n\nYou can easily plug a non-flat metric into the standard model lagrangian. I \nknow a few people that do exactly that and it works fine. If you don't \nbelieve me, then read the chapters on it in Weinberg's books ;) (or any \nother books that cover general relativity and quantum field theory in \nnon-flat metrics). One example for this is the determination of the mass of \nprotons from QFT simulations for instance.\n\nWhat does not work yet is bringing gravity into the shape of a quantum \ntheory. And this is where new theories come into play. Generally gravity is \nso extremely weak that the interactions between particles and a \ngravitational field can simply be approximated by interactions with the \nmetric. The only known exceptions are black holes and the extremely early \nuniverse (where the gravitational force probably has the same order of \nmagnitude in strength as some of the other forces).\n\nAnd no: \"quantum tunneling\" does not require any new theories what so ever. \nMost of it can even be explained very well even using Schr\u00f6dinger's \nequation. Gravity also has nothing to do with that ;) You can find out how \nto do it by reading up on it in the scientific literature.\n\nBlack hole evaporation again has been calculated just fine without any \nquantum theory of gravity. You can check up on that in the current \nliterature. But it is hard to predict what happens on a quantum scale (for \ninstance: how much information escapes?).\n\nAnd then there is the thing with faster than light. In \"classical\" quantum \nmechanics faster than light is indeed possible, just like it is in \nclassical Newtonian mechanics. In quantum field theory is it not, however. \nYou can easily check it by calculating the propagator of a particle out of \nits own light-cone. You find that if the particle has an antiparticle (as \nall discovered particles do) then the propagator is always 0 (if it does \nnot have any anti-particle, the propagator would fall off exponentially). \nYou can find the precise calculations in the aforementioned lectures by \nTong or any introductory scientific textbook on quantum field theory.\n\nAs far as I can tell, we simply cannot form an accurate quantum mechanical \npicture of an event horizon as of now. That does not mean that our quantum \nfield theory breaks down or that general relativity breaks down. It only \nmeans we cannot do it yet. The singularity of a black hole is a different \nstory though. There you simply cannot apply GR, since GR does not work with \ngeometries that cannot be approximated by an almost flat metric on a tiny \nscale. We suspect that with a quantum theory of general relativity these \ntypes of problems could become managable.\nBut that does not change the fact that we already can describe black holes \nvery well ... just not on the microscopic scale.\n\nI would like you to pick one of the standard textbooks on general \nrelativity that also covers black holes (most of them do) and read up on \nwhat we know about them and why whe know all that ;)",

In general relativity, the curving of the \nmetric of spacetime is caused by the energy momentum tensor. The energy \nmomentum tensor does, of course, look different for different \nfields/particles, but if you simply wish to concentrate them, the \ndifferences between the energy-momentum tensors of different particles \nvanish at some point as you concentrate them more and you get a black hole.\n\nYes, if you were to create enough Higgs bosons and concentrate them quickly \nenough (before they decay into other particles, like photons) you could \ncreate a black hole from Higgs bosons.\n\nDon't worry about it.

            "text": "+betadryl\nYou're welcome :)\n\nHawking radiation does not \"rip space appart\". It's actually as subtle as \nthe heat radiation coming from an object slightly above room temperature in \nyour room. It is also extremely low energetic. The perceived temperature of \nthe radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole (the \nmore massive it is, the \"colder\" the radiation). So the large black holes \nthat are typically around in our galaxy actually absorb more radiation from \nthe cosmological background than they emit from Hawking radiation. This \nmeans: even when these black holes do not absorb anything, they would grow \nextremely slowly. Hawking radiation generally only becomes important when \neither the black hole is very small (then it would emit really hot \nradiation) or when the universe becomes extremely old (so that the cosmic \nbackground is so extremely cold that even the largest black holes start to \nevaporate).\n\nBut other than this really tiny effect: large black holes are very stable.\n\nWell yes, antimatter could be created in the black hole, but it wouldn't \nmatter since you basicly notice only the gravity of the black hole as an \noutside observer (or, you would also notice if it was rotating or if it was \ncharged, but let us keep it simple for now). The antimatter could also not \nescape the event horizon ...\nSo it literally does not matter what is inside of the event horizon.\n\nWell, that's a good question. Generally the escaped particle will simply \nhave positive energy while the other one has some negative energy. After \nfalling though the event horizon of the black hole the particle with \nnegative energy is forced towards the singularity in the center. On it's \nway there it will probably interact with some other particles (for instance \nphotons) and pick up a lot of energy. The energy it picked up from the \nblack hole is then basicly \"paying\" for the \"energy debt\" of the particle. \nIf it hasn't interacted in the way to the singularity, it'll definately \ninteract there and the same thing will happen.\n\nIf you would like are more detailed explanation, there is basicly no way \naround doing some math ...",

            "text": "It's slightly more complicated than that.\n\nFor once: you'd have to explain how they got all that antimatter. Black \nholes basicly form due to gravitational collapses of \"ordinary\" matter. So \nyou'll always start out with a black hole made up of matter.\nTo have them change to antimatter, you'd have to have a process that \npreferably feeds them antimatter. There is no known process for that since \nthe universe is mainly made up of matter and you would have to specially \nproduce antimatter to feed it. And then it would also not simply explode, \nbut grow instead. The mass of an object is not only given by the mass of \ntheir constituents, but also ther energy. So if you dumped a chunk of \nmatter into an antimatter black hole (or a chunk of antimatter into a \nmatter black hole), they might anihilate with something inside the \nblackhole and produce a huge amount of energy. But since that energy cannot \nescape the black hole, it would simply get more massive ...\n\nIn reality they can \"shrink\" due to Hawking radiation. That is: \nfluctuations near the even horizon of the black hole create pairs of \nparticles. And these particles have some energy. Where did that energy come \nfrom? It's \"borrowed\" from the vacuum. And sometimes one of the particles \nflies off from the balck hole while the other falls into it. Since the \nenergy has to be conserved, and there is some positive energy far away from \nthe black hole produced (the escaped particle) and the black hole has \nswallowed some negative energy and \"shrunken\". It's a lot more complicated \nthan that in reality, but that's the main point about it.\n\nI hope that helped a little ;)",

Adding to that, when the \nalleged Big Bang occurred, there was a phase where the amount of anti \nmatter and matter was equal and the four basic forces (gravity, \nelectromagnetic force, strong nuclear forces and weak nuclear forces) were \nunited as a single 'superforce' for a period of 0 to 10^-43 seconds. This \nperiod is referred to as Planck era. In this period, 'supersymmetry' \nexisted. After that the symmetry broke, Gravity was the first force to \nseparate from the superforce and the number of matter particles outweighed \nthe number of antimatter particles and since matter and antimatter \nannihilate each other, matter:antimatter ratio kept on increasing.
