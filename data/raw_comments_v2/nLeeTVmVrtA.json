I wish your grandfather could see \nwhat he did for South Korea and know that he helped make it the great \ncountry it is today.\n\n+Peter Bloom You are sad. (But I bet you already knew that.) What is the \npoint/purpose of arguing with someone about their family history? Are you \ntrying to point out that South Korea did bad things? Yes, there were some \nterrible things that happened while the South was stabilizing. However, \nthey acknowledge and are deeply sorry for those things. The North on the \nother hand, has done so much worse for such a long time, and yet, they deny \nthey are doing anything wrong. The North Korean government lies more than \nyou start things in the YouTube comment section.\n\nIf you have actual evidence for your claim about the US's relationship with \nKorean freedom fighters, I would love for you to share it. Otherwise, your \nstory sounds like a shit piece of work from North Korean sympathizers.",

What gives you the idea that I \nscripted my family's history, and what would my incentive be to lie to a \nbunch of strangers on the Internet? I've noticed that all over the video \ncomments, you've been leaving accusations that these North Korean refugees \nare all scripting their testimonies.\n\nNow I've heard rumors that some so-called refugees were not actually North \nKorean defectors, but in fact part Chinese, or whatever. Perhaps their \nmotivations to lie were to gain public sympathy, or \"donations.\" People \nlike that are scammers, I do not deny that. But the few do not constitute \nthe whole, the whole being the many North Korean defectors who have gone \nthrough hell and back, with nothing but bravery and desperation to be free \nhuman beings. Some, like Joseph, were motivated to pursue higher education \ndespite their difficulties, including language skills.\n\nAre their testimonies scripted? Perhaps, in the sense that their original \nwords probably are not 100% grammatically correct, and were thus edited. \nBut to accuse all of them of having fabricated everything is just \ninsensitive, and it spits upon those who have suffered far more than we, or \nmany others, probably have.\n\nNow, to answer your question, I do know who the freedom fighters allied \nwith: the Chinese. Of course it makes perfect sense why the US would \ndislike their alliance since America was itching to contain communism. I \ndon't necessarily understand why you would ask me this and how it somehow \nproves that my great grandfather's story is fake. All you're doing is \nhurling trivia at me, hoping that I'll make a mistake that might prove your \npoint, but it doesn't.\n\nAnyway, I don't wish to lead a pointless debate into a pointless fight on \nthe Internet. I can't force you to believe me, so believe what you will. \nI'll just assume that you had a good reason to question me and the other \ndefectors since you don't sound like an idiot.

What do you gain from this exactly?\n\nJapan annexed Korea and, yes, they imposed their will upon Korea and thus \ninstalled their government there. Just because Japan controlled the Korean \npeninsula for some time doesn't make my great grandfather's efforts any \nless true or valid. The Japanese were kicked out, civil war erupted, \nAmerica tugged on the southern end of the peninsula to contain communism. \nThe South Korean government tried to establish a stronger political \nfooting. My great grandfather was not a fan of the Japanese invaders, but \nhe was also not a fan of Northern Communists trying to impose their will on \nthe South. He believed in democracy, which was probably why he supported \nthe Americans helping out the South (or creating the South as a proxy state \nto contain communism, whichever explanation floats your boat).",

It is primarily governed by it's military , and it's jehadist \nagenda.\nAs for China , I admire it's hard-working spirit and resolve , which \neenabled it to adopt one-child policy in such a huge country ; but I \ndespise it for it's bulliness. \n\n4. China is considered as a bully , not India. China , not India has a \nproblem will all it's neighbours in SE Asia.

China is more \nthan 3 times the size of India. Wonder why it needs any more land, and it's \nnot that they are oil-fields where the disputes are.\n\n5. India was a great ancient nation . But it isn't now. Somewhere in the \nmid-ages , India lost it's way in caste and creed business. But , India has \nfought against these , and these social dogma's are fast fast disappearing. \nIt's not caste and creed , but dirty Indian politics that try to use them , \nthat are the shackes of India's growth and prosperity.\n\n6. India is not a feudal country . When the Constitution of India was being \nformed ,during the days of it's Independence , all types of feudalism was \nabolished.
