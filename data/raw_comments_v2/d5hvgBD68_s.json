For example, cheeseburgers are \nevil from a cow's perspective, and bread is evil to wheat. And the soul is \na human construct to allow us to set aside our fear of death by giving our \nminds a separate identity from our physical form. These people \"gave\" their \nminds to \"evil\" usually through excess and selfishness and suffered the \nultimate consequence. Practising \"evil\" is a downward spiral, especially \nfor people with strong emotions. You do more to cope with the guilt from \nthat which you have done before until your coping mechanism loses \neffectiveness and one way or another you kill yourself. This process \nhappens quickly when assisted by the access provided by money, fame and the \nadmiration of others. So, metaphorically, the first statement is true. No \nmyth.\ufeff",
