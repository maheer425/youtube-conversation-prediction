After the Big Bang when protons \nand electrons came together from quarks, they formed hydrogen atoms. \nHydrogen atoms prevailed in the cosmos for a long time, until clouds of \nhydrogen gas began to attract and come together. These clouds eventually \nbecame so massive that, in their center, hydrogen atoms were slammed into \neach other, fused together by the immense pressure, into a helium atom. And \nthis releases a ton of energy, hence why stars  are so bright. Even larger \nstars managed to fuse together elements as large as iron. Elements above \niron came about through supernovae. A supernova occurs when a large star \ncollapses under its own weight, forcing a massive amount of matter into a \ntiny little space. Smashing these atoms together creates an immense nuclear \nfusion reaction, fusing elements higher than iron.\nThat's pretty much what he means.\nAll life is composed of atoms that originated from a star. \nWe invent things, play video games, build cities, run governments. \"These \nare some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years \nof cosmic evolution\" (Carl Sagan, *Cosmos*, Chapter XIII).",
