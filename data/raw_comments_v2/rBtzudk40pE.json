Theoden relinquishes his \nstubbornness and acknowledges the better man. Faramir makes the choice that \nhis brother never could.\nSmeagol starts to sow seeds of doubt between Frodo and Sam.\n\nThe battle scenes in the TT carried a lot of weight even though the RoTK \nhad bigger and more expansive fights. I liked the novelty of the unbeatable \nGhost army, but that, coupled with the Eagles, was too much of a deus ex \nmachina. It still didn't bother me too much in terms of enjoyment. It was \nmore comical than anything to me, but I still liked it.\n\nThe movies never really explain the Eagles that well. They were meant as a \nliteral deus ex machina in the books with some explanation. It didn't \nreally mesh well in the Hobbit movies.",
