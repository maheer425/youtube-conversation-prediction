            "text": "He *almost* has it. At 1:18 he starts talking about the \"new inside ski\" \n(the lower leg the end of a turn.  Yes, you may want to soften it a bit. \nYou need to release the old turn. But instead of thinking about *leading* \neverything with your body moving thru that \"window\", try *leading from your \nfeet* rolling over with the focus on the new inside ski. Your body should \nbe synchronized with the rolling of the feet. Sure, your body can lead but \nwhat happens at the foot level will be delayed. I also believe that leading \nwith the body creates excess body movement and imprecision, particularly at \nthe top of the turn which should be shaped as well as the rest of the turn.\n\nI know it's advanced stuff, but if you can think back about 30 years ago a \ncouple racer fellas by the name of Phil and Steve Maher sort of fell into a \nmove known as \"The Whitepass Turn\".  They showed that the inside ski had \nbeen greatly ignored by the skiing community. Today, we teach with a *very* \nactive (and continuous) inside ski. Mr. Turner eventually gets to the point \nof what to do with the inside ski, but does emphasize its importance quite \nenough.\ufeff",
