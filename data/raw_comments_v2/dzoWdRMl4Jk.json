My History \nProf, a Greek Orthodox Libertarian, suggested him to me when I was asking \nabout how a Christian could possibly be Libertarian. Thanks for the \nreminder.\n\nI did not mean to distort what you wrote. It just seems to me that Jesus \nteaching has massive economic financial implications, at least on an \nindividual and personal level, if not on a governmental level. I am greatly \ngrieved by Protestant churches evangelizing under the guise of missionary \naid, putting so-called \"biblical\" belief over real life humans in actual \npoverty and suffering. I see the Catholic Church as the single candle in \nthe world that freely loves these people; not threatening them with Hell if \nthey do not 'know' Jesus, thereby coercing them into the Church, like I've \nseen in so many protestant missions.\n\nI'd question that economics is a purely earthly matter, as the book of \nrevelation seems to paint economics in very spiritual, and even worshipful, \nterms. Of course, this is my Mennonite background's interpretation of \nrevelation, and not necessarily a Catholic one. Far be it from me to \npresume as to what scripture means.\n\nThanks much.",

When \nVulture Capitalists can literally extort and hold hostage the entire nation \nof Argentina, we can be well assured that this form of unfettered \nCapitalism has gone too far, and become a beast straight out of revelation. \nIt seems to me, that the Pope is just doing what Popes do: pointing out \ngrievances and atrocities against humanity and human dignity wherever it \nexists; in other words, \"Poping\"",

            "text": "+Tanaka Adria The difference is the Church has always been about love, not \ncondemnation. Here's what the Church has to say about homosexuality and I \ncompletely agree:\n\n<< 2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who \nexperience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of \nthe same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries \nand in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely \nunexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual \nacts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \n\"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\"142 They are contrary to the \nnatural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not \nproceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no \ncircumstances can they be approved.\n\n\n2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies \nis not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, \nconstitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, \ncompassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their \nregard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in \ntheir lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the \nLord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n\n2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of \nself-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of \ndisinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and \nshould gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection. >>\n\nUnlike what the liberal media would have people believe, The Church teaches \nthat a person is not a just label of thoughts, inclinations or choices, but \nan adoptive son or daughter of God; a human is a body, a mind and an \nimortal soul and has the free will to choose between good and lack thereof.\n\nThe media completely ignores this teaching and claims the Church hates \npeople instead of the sinful acts. These forementioned teachings prove that \nthe Church does not hate people who are afflicted by homosexual thoughts \nand inclinations.\n\nI once heard on the radio that there was a gay couple who adopted a child, \nlater became Catholic and chose to live the rest of their lives in \nchastity, helping their community. They finally invited Jesus into their \nlives who helped them carry their cross, they are now chaste and in \ncommunion with the Church. At the end of his testimony he said:\n\"I lost a lot of friends who also have a homosexual inclination when I \nchose to become Catholic and live my life in chastity with my former \npartner. The radical homosexuals do not speak for most people witht their \ninclination, I always knew those acts weren't right but did them anyway \nthinking that it will compensate for the pain I endured in my past. When I \nfound the Church teaching about homosexuality, I knew we couldn't live like \nthat anymore, I approached my partner about the courage and RCIA program, \nhe protested at first but the more we prayed the rosary, and talked about \nGod, the more Mary brought us closer to her son and the more chastity made \nsense so after a while we took the next step and became devout chaste \nCatholics, going to confession and communion regularly. That was 20 years \nago, I've never regretted it and I am happier than ever.\"\n\nCatholics cannot force God on people, we sew seeds of hope, the Holy Spirit \ndoes the rest.\n\nThe program he took with his friend is called courage, here's the website \nif you want to hear more testimonies:\n\nhttp://couragerc.net/",
