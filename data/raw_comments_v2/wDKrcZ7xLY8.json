Notice how Randy starts talking about \nhis  disappointment with the AMG understeer and Jonny quickly interupts \nwith, \"But let's talk about the fantastic engine.\"\n\nAfter 15 minutes of exhaustive video comparisons, he still doesn't want to \ngive the BMW its props, as he says:\n\"I GUESS I'd pick the BMW, but it just doesn't feel right.\" before he \nquickly pivots to the Subaru...an entirely different class of vehicle, with \nnothing premium about it.\nNote that Randy clearly says it's the better driver's car and his favorite \nBMW in 10 years. BOOM!\n\n-For all those talking about snow and AWD?  It's available in the BMW now.\n-Looks. Virtually every comparison agrees the BMW looks better.\n-Transmissions? The BMW is a much better A/T than the DCT in the MB, which \nhas molasses-slow shifts\n-Motor, brakes, handling?  Grab some of the $14k you'll save on the BMW in \nthis comparison, and drop in the BMW M Performance Brakes, suspension and a \nminor tune and this will clearly kill the MB on a track.\n-Car & Driver 10 best: M235i, CLA nowhere near the list\n-Edmunds rates the M235i an \"A\", the CLA a \"B\"\n-Motor Trend, AutoGuide, Drag Times all give the nod to the M235i\n-Consumer Reports rates the M235i the #2 car of 2014, under the Tesla Model \nS. It scores above the Porsche 911 and new Corvette. Highest rated BMW ever \nby them.\n-Drive both of these cars around town for 20 minutes and see how many teeth \nyou have left after getting out of the MB. Very jarring ride.\n\nI'm not saying the MB sucks or doesn't have some advantages. 4 doors, \ninterior bling, etc. I'm just saying that the M235i is the best BMW in \nyears and virtually every direct comparison between these 2 cars shows the \nM235i winning.\ufeff",
