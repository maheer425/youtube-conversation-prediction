My bad?\n\nI'm a (rather unabashed) smoker. I swear, I must have born to be one, \nbecause since I was a little girl, I remember thinking that cigarettes \nsmelled great. I quit for two years before resuming the habit. During that \ntime period, my nose became far more sensitive, and the smell of cigarette \nsmoke was truly foul. Having been on both sides now (twice), my opinion on \nthis has always remained the same: It's private property, so let the \nbusiness owners decide. Then I can decide whether or not I frequent them.\n\nThat said, having been a smoker, even when I quit for two years, I'd still \nlet people smoke in my car, my home etc. I never wanted to be that person \nthat criticized or passed judgment, because the stigma around smoking is \nexhausting, misguidedly encouraged and hypocritical as hell.\n\nI've been told off for smoking by fat people, by alcoholics, by people who \nhave bad hygiene, etc. From a smoker's perspective, there's an underlying \nirony that non-smokers typically cannot see: If you're overweight, why are \nyou lecturing me on health issues? If you're an alcoholic, should you \nreally be one to criticize \"poisoning\" myself and/or those surrounding me? \nIf you have bad hygiene, can you really complain about how I smell? The \n\"overweight and lecturing\" one particularly bothers me, mostly due to its \nsaturation and apparent separation from the issue of smoking. If you tell \nme I smell bad, I'm going to tell you that you look bad and assume that we \nwere both pointing out the obvious. Maybe next time they'll think before \nthey speak to a stranger.\n\nBesides, if it's two in the morning and I'm at IHOP, I'm assuming that \neveryone there (including staff) is a.) unconcerned about their \nhealth/diet, b.) drunk, and c.) likely smells pretty poorly.

And I'm talking about EVERY MORNING!!!\n\nAnd yes you're very right Martina when those ignorant Korean men just blow \nthere 2nd hand right into people's faces!!! GAD so f***ing rude and ugh. \nAnd I'm sure you noticed something beside smoking which is kinda like a \nside effect? that is SPITTING!!!!! Please talk about the issue of SPITTING \nin Seoul. My goodness, there was so much disgusting spits on the floor, on \nthe road, even sometimes inside the campus buildings... cloudy spits, \ntranslucent spits... GROSS!!! And I have to keep my eyes on the ground most \nof the time when I walk around Edae to avoid those ghastly spits. (Not only \nEdae all around Seoul) Imagine spits on the soles of your fav shoes and you \nwalk them into your dorm. EEEEWWWWW~ \n\nDo make a TL;DR on this issue too. Would like to know what you two felt \nabout it, or maybe it's not such of a bother. \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ufeff",

Outside, whether it's outside of a \nschool or a restaurant, why the hell would anyone decide that people who \nsmoke, can't stand outside of those places to smoke. It's the most \nridiculous thing. Can't walk anywhere to smoke, without having to feel \nguilty. It really has to feel like you're being a criminal, it seems. \nRespect each other, that's a good guideline\n\nYou do know what air pollution is right? And what about that car gas. All \nthis is much more harmful than cigarettes. Everyone needs to calm the fuck \ndown about smokers.\ufeff",
