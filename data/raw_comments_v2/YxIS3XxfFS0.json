Being human is the one thing that keeps us \nhuman. We have so many obstacles that keep us from every knowing more than \nwe know now. Such as pain, love, and wanting to learn. If you spent less \ntime trying to learn something and just did it then you could actually do \nit. But being human we will always be wondering how we do the things we do. \nSo if you have a Rubix cube and you want to solve it without learning and \njust did it, first you would have to get rid of the fact that you want to \nknow how to do it. We as humans use diffrent measurements to learn but they \ndon't exist. Say 1+1=2 but really it will never equal 2 because the only \nreal measurement that exist is TIME. Time is the only reason we are here. \nBefore you say \"No, G-d is the one who created everything and TIME\". It \ntook him time to make the earth and the heavens. Hopefully this made you \nunderstand even though we won't really understand it. Feel free to \nsubscribe to my channel(which is not related to this comment what so ever) \nbut you do not have to.

These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh. \nActs 20:28 tells us, \u201cBe shepherds of the church of God, which he bought \nwith his own blood.\u201d Who bought the church with His own blood? Jesus \nChrist. And this same verse declares that God purchased His church with His \nown blood. Therefore, Jesus is God!\n\nThomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, \u201cMy Lord and my God\u201d (John \n20:28). Jesus does not correct him. Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for \nthe coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1). In \nHebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, \u201cBut about the Son he says, \n\u2018Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be \nthe scepter of your kingdom.\u2019\u201d The Father refers to Jesus as \u201cO God,\u201d \nindicating that Jesus is indeed God.\n\nIn Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God \n(Revelation 19:10). Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship \n(Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38). He never rebukes \npeople for worshiping Him. If Jesus were not God, He would have told people \nto not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did. There are many \nother passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus\u2019 deity.\n\nThe most important reason that Jesus has to be God is that, if He is not \nGod, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the \nsins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being, which Jesus would be if He \nwere not God, could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against \nan infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God \ncould take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be \nresurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.",

(Be Sensible) If I asked you to dip your bare hand in boiling \nwater for 10 seconds, I know for fact no normal human being could resist \nthe pain. We cant control that part of our brain. There are many other \nexamples, like the part of our brain that keeps our heart pumping, the \nhippocampus which store our memory. The part of your brain that controls \nreflexes, the part of the brain that interprets soundwaves from your ear \nand many more. I leave you with a question. We may use 10% of our brain, \nbut do we control it?\ufeff",
