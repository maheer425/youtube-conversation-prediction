            "text": "+James Moore You do not want the lens to be smooth and like you said, the \nbug spray will cause the clear coat to bubble if you didnt get all of it \noff. You want to have scratches and follow the 400-600-2000 exactly like in \nthis video. The 600 grit puts deep enough scratches into the surface of the \nlens while the 2000 light sand, cuts any surface roughness off. This allows \nfor the clear coat to adhere properly so it wont peel in a year. If you \nmake it smooth, the clear coat wont grab onto anything and it will peel. \nYou can also have a problem with the paint running.  ",
