Calling yourself a football fan, while you \nswitch between teams that happen to be at the top of the league they are \nin, then differentiating further because you cant decide which footballer \nyou have the hots for, that is what is irritating. Yeah, sure there are \nlots of good looking footballers, but to only like football because of that \nis plain stupid.\n \nAs Sally mentioned, she got into BVB through Erik Durm, a player I happen \nto like. However I have stuck with supporting Man United because I SUPPORT \nthem, I don't blabber on about random stuff like their family members or \npartners, I support the team and the players. But going through a series of \nplayers I have liked doesn't change that. I might find interest in some but \nthat doesn't make me support their team. The fact that sally said it was in \nthe family,(supporting Bayern), makes it even worse.\n\nIf she really supported Bayern, she wouldnt have gone for BVB straight away.\nMoral of this comment: She is a glory hunter.\n\n\nSorry for the long comment",

What you claim, is the same type \nof stuff guys say about us, like: 'I bet you only watch for the hot \nplayers. Do you even know what offside means? Can you even name the entire \nXIs and benches of the 1998 France final?' You need to examine your \ninternalized misogyny.\n\nAlso, who cares if some of us like hot players?
