Some will produce it and \nthus look like normal cells to the immune system, and so go undetected. \nThis can be changed if the immune system is hyped up by another infection \nand then goes into overdrive, in which case it can sometimes see through \nthe trick and kill the cells anyway. Cancer cells also have many ways to \ndefend themselves or make themselves immune to signals from NKs and other \ncells telling them to commit suicide (ie: undergo apoptosis).\nWith regard to the DNA in each cancer cell being different, this also isn't \nnecessarily true, but what is more important is the proteins it produces \nand how it can avoid being killed or committing suicide. The ways in which \nit does these is the basis on which it is treated and these are DNA \ndependent (and thus for the most part protein dependent). Look up \"6 \nhallmarks of cancer\" for a better overview. But the simplest way to put is \nthat the DNA changes aren't the main issue its what happens due to these. \n(and individual small changes in DNA won't make a huge difference overall \nin cells (as some cells in your body also have small individual mutations \n(small mistakes which they get from being replicated over and over) without \ngoing rogue or being seen as \"other\" cells).",

For instance, if the original is,like you said, atgcg then \nthe matching strand changes to for instance tagag then it is a mutation but \nit doesn't have to change the function of the strand. To change the \nfunction of the strand scientists have group every three letters and give \nthem names. Search DNA codes to now what I am going to explain next.(don't \nconfuse it with RNA.). Lets say the DNA sequence is : GATAATCGCTGA. First \nwe divide them into groups of three. GAT AAT CGC TGA. Then we translate \nthem using the DNA codes: asp-asn-arg-stop. the matching strand is: \nGATAATTAATGA. Again we divide them: GAT AAT TAA TGA\ntranslation: asp-asn-stop-stop. Since only the first stop applies the \nsecond one is useless so the matching strand is missing information and \nthis is a type of mutation",

            "text": "+monkeyshatemath +Alex Adelman +Lionel Martinez Well,, what i meant to ask \nabout the gene thing was say you have a gene. it's code is atgcg, it's \nmatching strand has the correct sequence, tacgc. But this obviously varies. \nOn person might have atcgc, with  a matching strand that is correct. So how \ndo you know, by looking at the sequences, if that gene has a mutation in \nit? Well, what if the gene simply functions differently? It is suupposed to \nproduce this much protien, but it produces a little more, resulting in a \nstronger body part or something. Or maybe the opposite, it is supposed to \nsupply this ammount of protien, but it supplies a little less, thus \nsomething being weaker. Would you call that a mutation, or simply just a \ndifference between person to person? Like, is there a standard for exactly \nhow each gene should perform, and if something doesn't match, it's wrong?",

Delicious, \namazing symbiosis. And because they exist, and we like them, we do not wish \nto destroy them so long as they remain confined to the digestive system. \nThey also help prevent infections by harmful pathogens simply be being \nthere, taking up all the available space and nutrients.\n\nIf we killed all the bacteria of the world, which is currently an \nimpossible feat for our species, even massive amounts of nuking wouldn't \nsystematically destroy all of them, we would be utterly screwed not because \nwe would suddenly lack a layer of protection against other pathogens (They \nwould be all gone at that point) or because we would lack some digestive \nfunctions (We can live without their help, admittedly with some difficulty) \nbut because without bacteria, the entire food chain goes bonkers and \neventually, everything that is called life dies by starvation. Even plants \nwould eventually run out of soil minerals to absorb in their immediate \nvicinity and because the multitude of organisms required to renew those \nsoil minerals would be gone, the plants would wither and die. Sun and water \nis not enough, even for those.\n\nHowever, I would like to point that we ARE the rulers of this world. And \nlike all rulers, we depend on the existence of subjects to exist. We are \nthe apex of the pyramid of life and bacteria are the base. A base can \nsurvive without the Apex, but the reverse is impossible, unless we somehow \npermanently defeat gravity. If humans were able to remove their obligation \nto constantly seek sustenance in the form of water, air, heat and food, \nthen maybe we could exist for all eternity, but that would likely require \n\"Ascending to a higher state of existence that transcends the laws of the \nmaterial\" or something, which is quite a ways off.\n\nStill, we totally own the place, for now. But like any ruler, we can't just \nfuck with the people and hope to keep our heads. Are we are currently doing \n A LOT of that. We have the means and perhaps some of us have the \nwillingness to care for our planet, but sadly we are a ruling class of over \n7 billions different opinions, and we cannot find a way to all agree on \ndoing the right thing and thus, we are likely to herald our own horrible \ndestruction.",
