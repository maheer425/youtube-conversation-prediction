Trust me when I say he's a huge \ntalker, he's always yelling and is very loud, he's very talkative and easy \nto start a conversation with, though whenever I talk to him, he doesn't \nmake eye contact, he always kinda looks away. His voice gets much more \nsofter, and a little quieter than usual, like he's being gentle. Also my \nfriends have spotted it as well. He apparently does start to blush, but I \ndon't see it. My best friend in class has told me that when he talks to \nanyone else or even herself, he's completely normal. Though when one time \nwe both had to ask him something about a group project, my friend asked if \nhe had finished it, he talked completely normal. Though when I asked him \nand told him about something to add and when he would be finished, she \napparently heard him become more quiet and not even look in my direction. \nEveryone says he's just shy or nervous, but I don't believe it because he's \na really confident guy. It comes off as if he's rejecting me, which hurts. \nBecause he'll give short answers or even dismissive ones, as if he just \nwants the conversation to end or not even start one. \n\nIs he nervous and or shy, or is he actually rejecting me?\ufeff",
