You will never know Kolkata; if you \ndon't know Rabindranath Tagore, Vivekananda, Satyajit Ray, Kaji Najrul \nIslam, Netaji Subhash Bose, Khudiram or Binoy Badal Dinesh. it is the \ncultural and intellectual capital of India.

            "text": "sir you've just missed just one thing and that is a big thing, though to \nexperience this you must visit kolkata on particular dates (not fixed on \ncalender). Durga Puja in kolkata, during those 4 days it is so colorful and \nlively that people compares it with Rio de jenerio's carnival, though it is \nmainly Bengali Hindu people's festival but everyone despite of their \nreligion and where they are from or geographically located takes part in \nthis beautiful festival and big part of this festival is amazing foods be \nit traditional (only made in homes during puja) or foods at the resturants \nor food stalls... btw really nice video hope you had a good experience with \ncity of joy :)\ufeff",

Also for city rides try not to use public \nbuses much rather use uber or ola , the rates are very cheap compared to \nUS.Also as another comment said you should visit part street , its a pretty \ngood place. Hope you'll have a great time in the city of joy. cheers.\nps: Try to stay in a standard hotel in south kolkata and dont consult with \nany brokers. You can always find good hotels online for as low as $15-20 a \nnight.",
