They \nare perpetually crashing into each other and are held up by: electrostatic \nforces (planets/moons), the pressure of nuclear fusion (for a normal star), \nelectron degeneracy pressure (white dwarf), or neutron degeneracy pressure \n(neutron star). None of these effects tend to make an object into a disc.\n\nA solar system's planets, comets, and other objects are not held up by any \nof the effects above. They are kept from collapsing into the central mass \nby angular momentum (like a space craft is when it orbits the Earth). \nAngular moment does tend to shape an object like a disc like the video said.\n\nIn fact stars, planets, and other large spinning objects are actually \nsomething in between a disc and a sphere. The effect of angular momentum \nholding up the stuff on Earth is very small compared to the electrostatic \nforces because the Earth for its mass and radius isn't spinning fast \nenough. The Earth and the Sun are \"oblate spheroids.\"\n\nYou can really say that most stuff in space tends to form into a disk, a \nsphere, or something in the middle an oblate spheroid. In fact no perfect \nsphere or disk will ever exist so almost everything is an \"oblate spheroid\" \nand tends to go to that shape overtime. How spherical or disk like depends \non the mass, radius, and angular momentum of the system. \n\n\"Conversely, why do neutron stars and black holes eject energy \nperpendicular to their plane of axis.\"\n\nWell an object falling into a blackhole accelerates like nothing else. \nObjects close to the event horizon are going close to the speed of light \nbut just a little further out they are moving substantially slower. The \nmatter that doesn't fall directly into the hole orbits it very fast \n(because it has angular momentum) and it gets torn apart by all the \nfriction caused by running into other very fast things or things moving at \ndifferent speeds. This creates a plasma and a whole bunch of charged \nparticles flying around in a circle close to the speed of light (atoms \ncontain charged particles but the collisions tear atoms apart). The \ninteraction creates a magnetic field with the north and south poles of the \nfield roughly in the same place as the north and south poles of the \nrotating blackhole (because the rotating charges create the field). Some of \nthese super high speed particles follow the field lines in two jets \ncreating huge amounts of gamma/x-ray/particle radiation. The charges \nspiraling around magnetic field lines is a property of the magnetic field \n(explained using relativity). The charges would also want to spin around in \nthe magnetic field in opposite directions (also a property of magnetism). \nThis same effect explains why Auroras happen at the magnetic poles. In the \nAurora's case the charged particles from the Sun follow the field lines \nback to the poles. In a blackhole they'd get swept up into the magnetic \nfield then explosively jet out. Solar flares also spiral charged plasma \naround field lines then eject it into space.\n\nBlackholes because they are so small compared to their mass should spin \nvery fast (like an ice skater bringing her arms in to spin faster) creating \na very large magnetic field when charged particles are spinning in the \naccretion disk. The poles will build up energy and snap like a solar flares \ncreating huge jets at the poles.",
