            "text": "Health a high-dimensional matter. Unfortunately, dimensionality reduction \nalmost always leads to a loss of some of that high-dimensional structure. \nProblematic oversimplifications or generalizations may be the result.\n\nCaring more for your body will have more or less impact depending on what \nyour current state of health and 'base level' lifestyle is. If you already \nhave a healthy lifestyle (with regard to how you treat your body), other \nfactors may be more relevant if you want to make improvements. \nUnfortunately almost nobody has a healthy lifestyle, maybe one person out \nof 1000 or less. I had to learn this the hard way, and I very strongly \nbelieve that caring for your body is one of the mandatory prerequisites for \na happy, healthy and successful life.\n\nThe state of your body DOES shape your life. I have experienced dramatic \nchanges in just a few hours by very simple interventios. And yes, as Lissa \nRankin says, it is also a mirror. Your mind ALSO shapes your life. Again, \nwe must avoid oversimplifying things. The connection between body/mind/soul \nis a complex omnidirectional graph. Everything can have an influence of \neverything else.\n\nNow there are two strategies to improve this complex system:\n1. Investing much time and effort into finding out what is going on in a \nparticular person and developing specialized strategies that aim at \nparticular issues, assuming that the system needs to be repaired or \ncontrolled from outside.\n2. Unspecific improvements in as many parts of the system as possible, \nassuming that it has in inherent tendency to self-optimization and will \nself-optimize under suitable conditions.\n\nAlthough interventions targeting isolated symptoms may be helpful to a \ncertain degree, I believe that it usually most primising to make use of the \nself-optimizing capabilities of that system which have been developed and \nperfected over millions of years. They can be expected to be by far \nsuperior to the tests and tools and methods that are available to us.\n\nI see where she is coming from and what she is saying definitely makes \nsense, especially in her case. But it is just a part of a larger puzzle. An \nimportant one but not the only one.\n\nMy own experience is that stragegy #2 (unspecific improvements) can be very \neasy to implement and extremely effective.\n\nThe model she presents here may be very useful for all patiens who can be \ndescribed well by the model. For others a more general model may be \nrequired. As I said, I do not see a directional structure here but rather a \ngraph. Imagine those stones floating around, connected by rubber bands. \nEvery stone can now influence every other stone in a nonlinear way. You can \nnow look at the positions and motions of the stones and the properties of \nthe connections or at the properties of the system in general.\n\nIn case of her raw vegan exercising patient she is likely to be right \nassuming that the relation between body and environment is not a limiting \nfactor in her case. However, in case of the 99.9+% of the 'normal' \npopulation, it almost always is.\ufeff",

I've seen people who do \neverything healthy fall apart one day because their body gives out. It's \nclear that the more mentally sound you are the healthier you'll be.\n\nThat being said I do not see someone onstage who is what she preaches. She \ndidn't seem relaxed at all and her explanations seemed superficial. I think \nthere are clear mind body connections that we cannot even hope to \nunderstand with our current model of physics. I'm sure if we had a truly \ndeep understanding of how the universe works we could fully understand the \nbody and life in general.\n\nThat being said I hate how so many of these holistic healers are acting \nlike they have all the answers. I've learned a lot personally by stepping \nout of proven science and observing the fringe of what we know. It does not \nmean that I accept any of it as fact, nor do I try to push my ideas on \nothers. I consider our knowledge to be fledgling at best and we are far \nfrom understanding it all. People like this too me are no better than the \ndoctors she criticisms. Prove that there is a mechanism at play and we can \nname it. Until then it is speculation that COULD be truthful, but just as \neasily could not be.\n\nIt really comes down to a gray area that most people can't seem to tread \non. Take a look around YouTube and everyone talks in absolutes and \"full \ntruth\". The rest of the world is the same as this little virtual one. \nPeople can't deal with not having an answer. That's why religions are the \nway the are and people come up with the craziest explanations for things. \nThe lack of knowing is the true enemy. We need to realize that we are all \nfools trying to make sense of a incredibly complex universe and we need to \ntake it one step at a time.\n\nRegardless there is still an important message here, so even if the \nmessenger is crazy, it shouldn't dilute the message.\ufeff",
