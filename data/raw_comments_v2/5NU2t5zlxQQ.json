He \nis missing the analogy of the ''observable universe' While we can see a \nvast amount of space going back 13.8 billion years - the Universe will \nalways continue to ''go on'' if we wait to see new additions to it. \nConsidering the universe is Constantly expanding. This doesn't mean that \nthere is more being created - just that there is more separation between \nobjects - such as galaxies. We know these things by measuring the energy in \nthe Universe and seeing it's expansion. You could roll everything up back \ninto a ball from a central point and this is something that we can see. \nEverything is expanding from a central location, which means at one point \nin time the universe was much smaller while still retaining the same amount \nof mass and energy. Thus we must ask the question because the Law of \nthermodynamics and entropy do not lie, what caused the Universe's creation? \nWas it 'nothingness'? Of course not, it had to be something that was not \nrestricted to time, space, matter, or energy ( i.e. God). Thus something \nSupernatural had to create the natural, something beyond our Universe had \nto create the Universe. The best, and in my opinion only, explanation for \nthis is God. The Universe is not INFINITE, because it is not ETERNAL. If \nthe Universe is not Eternal, it can not be infinite, and since the Universe \nis only so old - then it can only be so big by the rate of it's expansion. \nSome people here need to read some books besides watching a single Youtube \nvideo and believing they know it all.

It \nwouldn't matter at all if there is an object farther off who's life hasn't \nreached us! If there was a star who's light didn't reach us it would mean \nthe universe hasn't been around long enough to reach us. Thus, because the \nfarthest things we see are 13.8 billion light years away the universe must \nbe 13.8 billion years old. If the universe was say, more than 13.8 billion \nyears old, we would see objects that are farther than 13.8 light years \naway. *But we don't*, so the universe cannot be older than 13.8 billion \nyears old. The fact that there are stars that we can't see is PROOF that \nthe universe has a finite age but old age. Until you provide verifiable \nevidence that directly contradicts this line of evidence, it is pointless \nto ask 'what if'. The reason I call you a moron is because I keep \nexplaining this to you and you still don't seem to understand. You don't \neven need me to explain it to you, as you could always just do some \nresearch on the web on your own.

There is no \nedge, so it is in a sense \"infinite.\" I don't know what you mean by not \nbeing able to calculate something because we can't see the light. As I said \nbefore, the fact that we can't see all the light PROVES that the universe \nmust be 13.8 billion years. If it was any older, that light would have \ntravelled to us by now and we'd be able to see it, but we don't. Its not \nunquantifiable.

I'm sure you don't believe in magicians being capable to \nsummon a rabbit from a hat. As you said what we know comes from the \ninteraction between our minds and reality. So I think it's quite extreme to \nsay that we must believe what we can see/hear/feel because your mind could \njust as well be lying to you. Well do you know about subliminal messages? \nThey do work. You do not feel that you got the message, your mind doesn't \nfind it necessary to make you notice it, but it does affect you. A higher \nforce of nature could just as well be doing the same thing.\n ",

Everything we know is how our minds interpret signals coming from, say, \neyes or noses, thus we must believe what we can see/hear/feel.

I'm not saying what I wrote is completely correct, theory is almost \nalways quite far from reality, but, as i said before, we have to make \nsomething out of what our tiny human minds can get a grasp on.",

            "text": "+WhiteNavayo I see what you're trying to do.\nThe first one is only true in the case of the universe being infinite. The \nsecond one is a geometric sequence and the answer is absolutely not zero \nit's 1. Or you can see it as the limit to be one. It's actually easy to \nsee.If you have One square of 1cm and you divide it continuously following \nthat series you will see that it works. It has already been proven. A quick \nlittle search on the net will prove you that. The third is true but \nconsider also this. You can match every single number from a \"bigger\" \ninfinite series to another number from a \"smaller\". Thus making those two \nseries equall. So they are different AND equall at the same time. Another \nparadox? You said it it's in theory. Theory can be very different from \nreality. And you also said 'in our minds'. Doesn't mean it is true in \nreality.",
