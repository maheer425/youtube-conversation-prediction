This guys \nexplanation has many flaws and a good argument can be made here. It is in \nfact true that childbirth is worse (I'm not saying this because I'm \nphysically female. I'm saying this because I study a lot about childbirth \nand how the reproductive organs work, first of all, your vagina stretches \nto fit the baby through, so technically its not a quarter sized hole, but \nthe fact is your fucking hole is stretching to a point that you might as \nwell think its ripping in half, also another point I'd like to make is that \nnot all women's hips are small and we don't all have the same body types, \nbut it doesn't mean shit because it still hurts like a bitch, your fucking \nhips are moving apart so your baby can get through! That is known as \ncontractions, contractions are known to be very VERY painful, as I said \nbefore, your fucking body is pushing itself to its limits! Just to push out \na baby! What's worse is that babies come in different sizes and can get \nstuck! That's worse. But it doesn't stop there. Oh no. You experience a \npressure unlike any you have ever faced! Many have explained it as a \nfeeling of someone stepping on their vagina! Fucking ow! And remember the \nfact that it is rare for guys to die by being kicked in the testicals, but \nin child birth you can actually die or go into a coma! Women are designed \nto handle more pain than men, our periods hurt like a bitch, our backs hurt \nwhen you have big boobs, I don't understand when people say stupid things \nlike this man! He is not a professional, it is easy to tell. He obviously \ndidn't look into detail and is very ignorant of the human body. Now I'm not \nsaying women are better or blah blah men are weak, dumb things like that. \nI'm just stating facts, men can go through very bad pains as well, if you \nlook into the many dangers of their genitalia you can see that they too are \nprone to experience pain, all I am saying is, yea, women do have more pain. \nThat doesn't make us better, it just means that we can handle it better. \nMen are not designed to experience these pains. Our pain is to simply make \nus more gutsy and strong mentally and a bit of physically depending on the \nwoman. You cannot always believe what you read/watch online for people are \nnot always educated and are most likely liars.
