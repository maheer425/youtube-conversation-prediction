            "text": "+Larry Jarrins My point is that if you think they are real you have not \nhandled a gun. Guns are heavy, a glock feels very heavy in the hand, a \ncarbine weighs around 14Lb, and a full machine gun (like he has a MODEL of \non the wall) weighs in the 20s. If you have ever handled a gun you would \nrealize no gun owner would hang their guns one some crappy metal rack \nbecause they are very heavy. \n\nBut anyways to your next claim: No, the Desert Eagle is over sized and has \nway to much recoil to be useful, it may have stopping power but you aren't \ngoing to get many rounds down range. If I want stoping power I will get a \n1911 which is cheaper, easier to find ammo for, more reliable, and more \nuniversal. The Glock is good but I fell SIG makes better, that is my \nopinion. ",
