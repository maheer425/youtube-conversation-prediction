Butter had been the most wonderful cat while she \nwas staying at ours at first she was a little shy and didnt know our place \nthat well but thats normal she had been with us for just 2 weeks but the \nmoment she even heard her owner voice she didnt even see them or smell them \n(at least I think, they were in the hallway a couple of meters away from \nthe bedroom she was resting in) she freaked out and hid under the bed and \nwas basically in every sense a wallflower cat, we then learned he was a \nmother and had been forced to live with her 1 and a half year old son and \nshe had escaped home the owners gave her too us not long after that because \nshe chose to live with us and they understood.\nBut now its been almost 2 years since that and every now and then if she \ngets a little to exited or if I get a little to exited around her or \nsometimes just randomly she flees and hides under the bed and if anyone \nstand around the bed for too long she will attack your feet, it doesnt \nusually last longer than 10 minutes. I dont really know what to do, I dont \nplay with her when she is doing that because that makes her act like that \nfor a longer time (we have another play area and thats not it) and I wont \ngive her treats under the bed cause i dont want to promote her behaviour \nbut I would really like to know what to do since i dont think this is \nhealthy behaviour.\ufeff",

She is in my \nplace since saturday and I knew she was a fraidy cat. At first she was \nhiding under a blanket being just a kitty bump, but she came out from time \nto time and now on the third day, I can play with her and even pet her a \nlittle. My problem is that her flea treatment is due in three days and I'm \nreally afraid she is going to scratch me or run away and all the progress \nwe made will be gone. Do you have any tips on how to make the anti-flea \nspot-on treatment easier for a newly arrived fraidy cat? btw. I haven't \nfound her jackpot-treat yet. All the treats I presented her were just \nignored :(\ufeff",

I decided to keep both of them. Now, the female is extremely \naffectionate (borderline needy), though still shy and hesitant around \nstrangers (I don't consider this a problem). The male, on the other hand, \nwon't let me make physical contact. If I try, he hisses and runs away. And \nI'm not talking attempts to grab him. This is just simple gentle petting. \nThe most contact I ever get is that I can occasionally hold out my hand to \nhim and he will cautiously sniff it. (Then he quickly backs away.) He does \nwalk openly around my apartment, and will even often sleep on the couch \nabout 1 1/2 feet from me (the end closest to the door, of course - it's \nwhere he is as I type this). Play therapy doesn't seem to work, or the \nprogress is WAY too slow. Bribing with treats/food hasn't helped. I tried \nputting him on meds, but they were just too expensive and too difficult to \nadminister, for a variety of reasons.

We already had a senior cat (Cotton_) at home \n(who's 17 now, and with the power of arithmetic, was 15 years old then).She \nhad been living as the solo cat in the house when one of my daughters \ngraduated from school in 2005 and took her cat with her. Yes, nine years of \nbeing a solo cat. \n\nAt first, new fur baby (Blair) stayed with son, upstair, and we gradually \nintroduced her to the rest of the house. She would run away at the \nslightest noise, hated being picked up  or held and was deathly afraid of \nCotton, who even if Cotton turned in her direction, Blair would scatter.\n\nWe suspected perhaps, besides a new environment, she had had some trauma or \nmistreatment. Maybe not.\n\nBlair would let me stroke her, but only at arms length, with access to a \nquick get away. If anyone crossed her path, she'd run in the opposite \ndirection.\n\nI took things at her speed. She didn't share the food and water bowl with \nCotton, but rather, they took (and continue to take) turns. She graduated \nto jumping up on the arm my easy chair to get stroked, She had plenty of \nclimbing room. The two cats settled into different areas. For example, \nBlair would sit and relax on the sofa and Cotton would sit on my chair.\n\nCotton would sleep at my side on my bed and Blair would be at the foot of \nthe bed,\n\nNow, Blair will gingerly place a paw on my lap as she descends from the arm \nof the chair, till she slowly stands, then sits, then finally lays her \nlittle head down, completely relaxed. I'm gently stroking her the entire \ntime and she becomes a purr baby. Still. someone walking by can spook her \nand she's gone.\n\nShe loves chasing balled up paper and balls (but not noisy ones). She runs \naway from feathers on a stick.\n\nAs long as I approach her slowly and offer my hand, she'll hang out and \nplay, She even will follow me from time to time. \ufeff",

I have \ndone the play thing, a challenge because the other cats jump in. I do the \nslow blink. She no longer runs when I come near her. But if I go to touch \nher, she is gone. If I have cheese, she is my best friend, again its on her \nterms. Some times I will look down and she will be close by. Recently after \ncoming home from major surgery, I awoke in my recliner and saw her watching \nme from the arm of the recliner. Once I fully opened my eyes she left. I \nthink she was making sure I was ok.\n\nThe other week she found herself trapped under a recliner. After hearing \nher growl, I tracked down where it was coming from and slowly opened the \nchair. She bolted down stairs. She was done there a long time, and I became \nconcerned and went to check her. Found her hiding. But she did not run when \nI knelt down near her. She allowed me to pet her and eventually pick her \nup. All the time talking softly to her. She didn't want to be held any \nlonger than a couple of minutes, and I let her go as I did not want to \nspook her.  As I was not able to fully check her legs, I found her a short \nwhile later and she was not able to leave the bathroom where she was (I \nshut the door). She jumped to the counter and while she was nervous she let \nme check her out fully. But she did not try to get away, or growl.\n\nShe hasn't let me pet her since, she is back to her old self. I guess my \nration of being able to pet and pick her up is every 2.5 years.  I wish I \nknew how to get her to let me pet her and show her how much I love her. But \nI know it has to be on her terms. Has anyone else had a cat like my \nTinkerbell? I am sure I am not the only one.\ufeff",

He spent 3 weeks hiding under a gap \nin the basement floor and leaving behind messes with worms in them before I \ndecided to trap him to get veterinary care. After that, I used my giant \nhusky crate to make him a safe space. It took months for him to get to the \npoint where he would come to the door of his hidey hole for a bit of soft \nfood or chopped up chicken. Once he was healthy enough to get fixed, we \nfinally turned a corner.\n\nAfter months of infinitesimal steps, Macavity started to come out for food \nwhen the door was open, and then would eat while I sat right beside him. \nFinally he let me give a pet or two while scarfing the food. Two months \nafter turning the corner, he is a full member of the house, loves being \npetted and sleeps at my feet every night. I had been nearly ready to give \nup, wondering if I was doing the right thing, and it is amazing to see the \nchange. I had hoped for handleable, and I got a cuddle cat.\n\nNature works on its own time. It's easy to be impatient and want to push \ntoo far, too fast.
