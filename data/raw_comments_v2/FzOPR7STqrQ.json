Once you break traction maintaining the slide \nwithout losing control or snapping back requires controlling throttle input \nalong with counter-steering the over-steer (keep the front wheels pointing \nin the direction you want the car to go). You need to modulate your inputs \nboth on the pedal and the steering. Best bet is to book some skid pan time \nat your local track and get some practice in.",

You just fall in love with them and can fight for \nthem.\nThis E28, it looks so beautiful! I love its sharp edges and its front. I \nlove the headlights and the tail lights. I love the way it looks even \nthough its not a car from my generation. I can in a way understand what \nkind of love Chris Harris is trying to explain here. It is deep and divine.\ufeff",
