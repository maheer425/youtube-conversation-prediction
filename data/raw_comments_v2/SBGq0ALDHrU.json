In this \none, every other one of those women felt remorseful about cheating, or at \nleast recognized that it was wrong, but not her. No, she didn't see \nanything wrong with it at all, because it wasn't \"an affair\". But when she \ntalks about being cheated on, she makes it out like she was greatly wronged.\n\nAnd in other videos, pretty much anyone who isn't like her (female, \nempowered, not heterosexual, anything but hardcore liberal) is inferior to \nher.\n\nI really want to see her fall on hard times, and not a single person help \nher because of how self-centered she is.\ufeff",

They simply will end the \nrelationship when they are unhappy instead of looking for fulfillment \noutside of the relationship. When a relationship ends, they take time to \ngrieve and develope a sense of peace within themselves before they start \ndating again. People who cheat tend to be insecure, selfish, narcisstic, \nunhappy and have a low self worth. Since they have a low opinion of \nthemselves, they project this on to other people and often feel no remorse \nor regret for hurting other people. Therefore, people who have a history of \ncheating, deception and a total lack of concern for the feelings of other \npeople, should never be considered potential marriage partners, \nrelationship material or someone to be in an exclusive relationship with. \nHowever, they can make great sex playmates, friends with benefits or people \nto have an open relationship with\" ~ Coach Corey Wayne.\ufeff",
