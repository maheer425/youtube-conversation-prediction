Then I tried remembering the actual noises and \nwas able to 'rote' repeat the sounds, much as one might a short foreign \nlanguage sentence. I was then able to make connections with the actual \nmeaning of the words. It seems we have the ability to remember the sounds \nin one area of the brain and the interpretation of the sounds in an other \narea.

Mathematically if this is true the brain would have the capability \nto explores its max storage potential with experiences created with other \nexperiences. Now the other question that arises is what if the brains size \nand it's potential to store experiences and creativity is suited to our \npotential life expectancy, which is also finite as our brains capacity.This \nkinda shit makes me stay up at night because realizing filling your mind \nwith nonsense may potentially be hindering your goals because if creativity \nis borrowed from other experiences then enriching ourselves with positive \nexperiences is essential for discovery. On a side-note if our brain is \ncapable of deleting experiences or firing orders at a mature age as \nchildren are capable of \nthis task at an earlier age, then we may able to recycle a certain number \nof firing orders, but the ultimate questions is, is anyone capable of \nexploring the max firing orders of their brain and able to retain it?\ufeff",
