What he did more than anything was to retard the science we have \ntoday, and nobody in the science world has dared to do anything that would \nupset any of his \"laws\" until quantum mechanics came along.  His greatest \nknown \"law\" E=MC2 was really not his, and really not new but ancient - I \nmean it was just a slight variation of Newton, wich he actually on other \nmajor points disagreed with, and most of his other relativity was the \nbrainchilds of other thinkers, published long before him, but whithout his \ncelebrity status. It doesn't take much of a brain to read other peoples \npatents and theories, then publish them as your own. I don't deny he was a \ngood mathematician that really understood a lot of physics, and not at all \nstupid, only what he did was kind of silly, excluding parts of science from \nour textbooks, and the inventive mind he has been credited for, is \nabsolutely hyped up. In many ways he was as arrogant and ruthless as Edison \nor Marconi taking without a blink the profit, fame and glory from other \npeople, right out stealing their inventions, patents and original \ndiscoveries, wich Edison proved very well it doesn't take half a brain, and \nno education at all to do with great success.

Or even if you were wrong in many of \"your\" celebrated ideas \nthey find ways to get around that too. Real smithsonian heroes...\nEinstein had more than one run in with Tesla, and it should take more than \n100 years of Einsteinian rule to realize or even try understand some of the \nconcepts Tesla pioneered, and discover experimentally who was really right \nof the two. I talk about for starters the over all present zero-point \nfield, with all it's implications, that Tesla called the medium or gaseous \nether, that Einstein has (maybe purpously) denied scientists to explore - \nwhen he said it didn't exist.\nHit me now Einsteins, if you think your smart because the teacher give you \ngood grades for memorizing equations, and you believe in a perpetuated lie, \nyou'll never get the half of what the universe has to offer.

That could also be a possibility \nconsidering he constantly read, processed through mathematics, rode his \nbicycle, and to my recent discovery played the violin. In a very blunt way \nof putting it, reading probably allowed him to take in information more \nthoroughly, doing complex math would have stimulated his processing \nabilities, riding his bicycle would have put his body in a health state \nallowing his vascular system to be healthy allowing required chemicals to \nflow, and the violin might have exerted the expression and connection of \nboth the left and right side of his brain.\n\nNow I wonder, how does this apply to you? What do you do that might apply \nin these four groups, information, processing, physical health, and \nexpression. For example, currently I'm expressing my opinion after taking \nin certain types of information then processing it through relation to his \nactivities and goals to understand what might have made Einstein a \"more \nadvanced\" human.
