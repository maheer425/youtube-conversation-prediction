The economies \ngrow rapidly on paper in percentage terms because they are so small that \nany investment or development, no matter how slight, is a lot for them. A \nsingle new mine or road built in a place like Sierra Leone is a massive \ngain to them, when it would be at most a footnote to a country like the US.\ufeff",

            "text": "Actually, The current theory goes: when you built a road in a country with \njust 2 roads (or open ruotes to other countries and previously isolated \nregions) you will enhance that economy much more than when a country that \nhas 20924332 built another one.. This is because the country with 233232 \nroads has a lot of road to commerce while the country that didn't have one \n(or has 2-3), now with one more the economy will expand greatly because \nyes, now there's another road for trucks to go and for a country with few \nroads.. that's a massive improvement.\n\nI do get that this progress could be fragile.. But everything is fragile at \nthat stage, normally countries gain more stability if the process continues \nwithout pausing and it's costant and that's the aim of the people helping.\n\nAlso, that argument is not really a real argument, you can't just say ohh \nall that they are doing is extracting resources, that implies that they \ndon't have cities where there's commerce, that they are not building roads \nto connect the cities and that everyone live in tiny little villages where \nit is difficult to use the export money. Those 3 are truth (arguably not \nthe second) up to a extent, cities in Africa are growing way faster than in \nother continents and while this growth is a fragile one it is still growth. \nAnd corruption takes a lot of the money from those revenues and while \nthat's true, there's also a lot more pressure from NGO and goverments to \nstop that, I mean,we can just pressure the guys an take some legal action \nand that's it because the alternative is not doing any business with them.. \nAnd that would make their situation far worse.\n\nTo conclude, while a big fragile, progress is progress and for nations with \nlittle over 60-70 years on average, starting from rock bottom, they have a \nlot of road to covert.. The good thing is that normally when the proccess \nbegins (in a stable way).. It is hard to stop.",

And i \ndoub NGOs are going to stop development projects all of a sudden. So no \nit's not \"very very fragile\". if the African nation in question has a \nstable government, then the extraction of resources comes back in the form \nof export revenue, which can then be used to develop the country in other \nareas. China can afford to be more generous because a) it has massive \nforeign reserves and b) it has to compete with other nations for these \nresources so ithas to present a better deal than what western counterparts \nhave to offer.
