I agree about the \nwhat (YouTube becoming mainstream might be problematic) but I disagree \nabout the why (which boils down to basically \"because it will no longer be \nfor an intellectual elite group of people\").  Honestly, a part of me wants \nmore people to watch YouTube because that means more people will be more \neducated, exposed to more alternative perspectives, curious and thoughtful. \n Personally, what worries me about the mainstream-ization of YouTube is \nthat it will become more COMMERCIALIZED (as in: mainstream-style television \nprograms created by mainstream television stations like BBC, ABC, CTV, and \n- oh horror of horrors (:P) - Fox - will air on YouTube), and that 1) \npeople will gravitate towards those instead of the smaller, more \nindependent, and yet more raw and honest content creators and 2) they will \nfind a way to make us pay to watch YouTube.
