We are supposed to \"run out\" of coal in a few hundred years. Just \nover a hundred years ago, we didn't even have electricity. So by time we \nare supposed to run out of fossil fuels, we won't need them. We will have \nmuch more solar, wind, and natural renewable energy. Fossil fuels will \nbecome a convenience. I also think there must be some sort of population \ncontrol with humans...There will probably be a plague that kills millions \nof people as we approach 10 billion people on the planet. There is nothing \nwe can't survive. Mother nature can't be killed by humans. Think about it. \nThere have been nuclear explosions, huge fires, and lots of destruction. \nYet over time the earth fixes itself. Nothing humans do will speed up the \nprocess of cleaning Chernobyl, but the earth does it on its own. We aren't \ndestroying earth.
