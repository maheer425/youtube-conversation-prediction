A puzzle is something to logic your \nway through, but once the strategy is known, solving a cube (or any other \nshape for that matter) is trivially easy. It strikes me as a complicated \nTic-Tac-Toe; it's got its use teaching game theory and AI, but why-oh-why \nare you guys drawn to such a pastime?",
