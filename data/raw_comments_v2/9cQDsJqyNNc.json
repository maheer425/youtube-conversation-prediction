You have designated spots for all of the trainees and \nJungigo and Nochang had their parts in the beginning and end. I have to say \nthat with 0 Young, it was completely taken over by the idols and then I.M. \nand Jooheon, cause the rappers. The beat was ok, but Vasco was amazing and \npulled everyone's talents together here. This song is a lot more catchy and \ninteresting, because it's showing the talents, not slipping them in every \nso often. And this is coming from someone who deeply enjoys both songs.\nCan't we leave the fact that No.mercy/Monsta X happened/is happening and \njust look at the pure talent we see in this video from the trainees?\ufeff",
