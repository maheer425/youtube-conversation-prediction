But as time went on, I had my fair share of shoe \npolishing, ironing and MARCHING UP AND DOWN THE SQUARE!!!, and eventually, \nI just kind of came to think, \"What the fuck am I doing with my life?\". I \nmean, I completely appreciate the need for an army, air force etc. and I \nhave full praise for those who enlist. But honestly, why does there need to \nbe so much bullshit in the armed forces? Why do we need to waste shit-loads \nof hours marching pointlessly up and down a square and ironing our uniform \nto be perfect by made up standards? Disciplining, they might argue. But \nsurely there has to be better, less fricking futile ways to discipline \nenlistees? And I don't think there's any justification for rules like \nhaving to take your beret off indoors and when you eat, or for getting a \nbollocking just for having a stain on your shirt or a button undone. \nThey're just rules for the sake of rules. As far as I'm aware, in order to \nhave an effective military force, you just need fit, disciplined and \nreliable people who know what they're doing. The extra added narcissism, \ndehumanization and life-wasting drill is just beyond me.\ufeff",
