I've given a lot of thought to where sentience came \nfrom, and I still don't have an answer. But to your point about intent, I \nsee no reason why anything we see now needed intention to be created. I \nthink people see creation in nature not because it was created, but because \nwe create to replicate nature and therefore, nature looks created. Much \nlike some people, typically in reference to television or related, say that \nX is a shameless ripoff of Y, when Y was created so as to be like X. They \nwere exposed more to Y first, so they think X was meant to be like Y, even \nthough X came first and y was inspired by X. If this makes any sense. So \nI'm not sure of any other beings, physical or otherwise, capable of intent \nor longing or anything else you listed, but I see no solid reason \npersonally as to why they must. Perhaps we simply haven't found them yet, \nor everything is sentient and we don't recognize it because it's so \ndifferent from our own sentience.
