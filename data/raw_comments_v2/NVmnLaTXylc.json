On two occasions I had a spider (assumably the \nsame species, I didn't care to examine closely) rope down directly above me \nfrom the ceiling. One might faintly imagine Lemming spiders.\n\nOn the first occasion, I spotted the spider in the corner of the room, no \nfarther than 2 metres in a direct line away. Since spiders are not really \nappealing to me, I decided to *take care of it in a minute*, and continued \nworking. Though in a minute, the spider had made its way across the ceiling \nand did *rope* down to in front, and a little up of my face.\n\nIt's not funny if you have arachnophobia. While being more grossed out than \nbeing frightened, I guess.\n\nSo the thought of swallowing spiders in your sleep, at least some species, \ndoesn't seem too far fetched. Unfortunately.\ufeff",

They \ndoctors got worried when they got all the pictures, because there was a \nstrange animal in my stomach I didn't know about. After I saw the pictures, \nit look roughly like the spider and two other creatures that I have no clue \nwere. They were worried again and gave me some ipecac and we found that \nthere was a spider in my stomach. So, in conclusion, I have no doubt that \nspiders love warm, moist places and that a human may swallow on or two or \nmany a year, but I truly have no clue if a human swallows 8+ spiders a \nyear, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's true.\ufeff",
