A few weeks later his went to jail, I was hoping he was \njust tripping from meth.  I never messed with it, but read you can go in \nand out of these effects.  Seen him recently and he is still the exact same \nif not worse.  He is saying stuff like his Dad is telling him this and that \nor his dad is in the car waiting on him.

I had a real outer-body experience \na few days ago and it changed my perspective on what truly this astral \nplane is. There is being lucid in a dream, and there is being awake on the \nastral plane and I realized there is a way bigger different then I \norignally thought. My OBE was short, but intense and I had way more \ncontroll than any control I ever demonstrated lucidly in a dream. I look \nforward to my next one, and I will practice OBE technique every day until \nmy next venture now. To everyone else, it appears we are not crazy, because \nthey believe the same things even if they don't have an illness. You \nprobably know what I mean when I say in my endless uncontrollable thoughts \nin my episodes I came up with thousands of possibilities and ideas that \nwould PROBABLY translate into abilities in the state of an OBE. I hope to \ntake advantage of my spiritual capabilities in my next OBE. I love being an \nagnostic and  having this endearing perspective on this very material world.",
