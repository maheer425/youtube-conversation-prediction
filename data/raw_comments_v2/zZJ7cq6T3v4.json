Is \nit so Robert Zemeckis could have a funny scene?\n\n0:17 Biff is clearly walking slighly more to the right than he was in the \nprevious shot.\n\nPause exactly at 0:20 as he lands. That face \ud83d\ude2e\n\n0:31 That is not Michael J. Fox. He has grown several inches and has more \nhair. Possibly Eric Stoltz.\n\n0:43 The backwards hat kid is trying to get Marty off the scooter and then \nis calmly watching him in the next shot. \n\n1:02 Look at the back of the board and keep it in mind for later. \n\nThe car changes from a 1946 to a 1948 Ford throughout the scene.\n\n1:27 Shouldn't there be future ramifications for destroying that hedge? The \nmoney it costs to repair it, and somebody in a car having to wait 10 \nseconds for the hedge guy person to cross the road?\n\n1:54 That Yellow car came from nowhere.\n\n1:55 And now it is gone.\n\n2:03 \"I'm gonna ram him.\" Geez. I knew Biff was a bully, but not a \nhomicidal one.\n\n2:07 Obviously not Michael J. Fox.\n\n2:09 The spark emitter on the back of the board is gone all of a sudden.\n\n2:10\"SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!\" That is Billy Zane's only line in the film. WHY, \nBOB GALE?!?!?!?!??!\n\n2:12 Use the radio antennae as a reference point. The car has slightly \nmoved backwards from when it hits the truck, to the manure dumping on the \ngang.\n\n2:28 The striped shirt kid teleports between cuts.\n\nApparently Marty's purple shirt changes color throughout the scene, but I \njaven't noticed.\n\nHow were the police not involved with this incident? Lorraine can track and \nfollow Marty back to Doc's place but not the authorities?\n\nOh, and see if you can spot Thomas F. Wilson's stunt driver throughout the \nscene.\ufeff",
