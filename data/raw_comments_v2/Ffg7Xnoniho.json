The only different thing \nbetween NK and China is NK is family run old school kingdom, but China \n(Mianland, Taiwan, republic of China have) has never had father-son running \nthe country since 20th centry.  North korea rulers Kim family worry open \nthe country can make them away from the throne. China has not incentive to \ngrab territery for NK as 1stly this will give US and Western world a good \nexceuse to boycotte their trade and hurt economy 2ndly give US a good \nexcuse to put in more millitary musle in South Korea, 3rdly how to maintain \nthe stable situation in North korea is questionable. Both China and South \nKorea just want to keep as its current situation. Especially South Korea \nwhich has much better ties with China than ever before.",
