            "text": "Laura, Lovely Vegetable Lo Mein recipe. May I suggest as an alternate prep, \nyou try the following; Stir fry the veggies as usual first. Remove from \npan. Briefly saute the fresh minced ginger adding a minced fresh clove of \ngarlic. Incorporate the veggies and noodles. Add additionally to your sauce \nmixture, half a teaspoon of Asian Sesame oil,and 1-2 teaspoons of Dry \nSherry(very close to Chinese Shao Xing wine and what many Chinese \nrestaurants use) along with the Oyster sauce and sugar. Watching so many of \nyour superb Youtube cooking videos,I know your family doesnt add garlic to \nmany sauces and dishes. Our family loves garlic,but of course,it's personal \npreference. Minced garlic,ginger,a splash of sherry/wine, is traditional in \nmany regional Chinese noodle stirfrys. Give it a try.\nThank you for being so generous with your family's recipes and all your \nvideos. All the best to you and your family. Congratulations on your new \nshow. Buon Appetito!\nP.S. My Sicilian Nonna and Mom used to make \"Babaluci\", snails in a tomato \nsauce, Fra Diavolo style, in Brooklyn many years ago. Cannot seem to find \nthose snails anymore. Batter dipped,golden fried zucchini flowers were also \na special treat. Family food memories seem to resonate the strongest.\ufeff",
