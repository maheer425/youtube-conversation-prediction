If you are average, 20 hours isn't enough to acquire a new \nskill.\n\nDon't belive me? Go ahead. Try learning something new. Don't cheat. Time \nyour practice and review after 20 hours whether you feel you have learned \nthat particular skill. \n\nI've played guitar for 100s of hours just like he says. Not even close to \nthe level he is. And I've tried doing exactly the way he says it. My brain \nis just not musical i.e. no natural musical talent. But I'm really good at \nmath. Never tried hard but still it came easy to me. Started playing chess \nand just went on winning and getting good at it only after putting a little \neffort in to it. Why? Genetics. Both my father and brother are good at \nmath. Chess is very much a math based thinking game. I can think logically, \nvisualise tactical combinations and so on. It's all genetics, baby!\n\nMore often than not, you're born to succeed or not. You might put it alot \nof effort and be good at something that you have no talent for, but you'll \nnever ever be at the level of someone putting the same amount of time as \nyou, but they had natural born talent at that particular thing.

I would say if you follow his \nfirst 3 steps of rapid skill acquisition, if you continued to apply this in \nthe same way to 100, 1000 or 10,000 hours, then you will be much better off \nthan someone who 'practices' with the TV on, or even worse, 'practices' \nsomething expecting to get better at something they believe to be related. \nFor example, I see lots of people wanting to improve their kicking height \nfor Martial Arts by spending hours trying to achieve the splits... whereas \nwith a little research, they could, easily in 20 hours be kicking at head \nheight without a single attempt at doing the splits at all! \n\nSo overall, I think the message is a good one, figure out what you need to \ndo to get good at your skill, self correct instead of doing the same wrong \nthing over and over, focus and do it for at least 20 hours.\n\nA nice side effect, is that you will get in the habit of focused practice, \nso you might choose to get better at that skill. Imagine focusing on \nsomething for an hour a day for a year... I'm sure you would get good at \nit!\ufeff",

Research and ask questions, look on forums or anything you need to find \nwhat works best for other people and how other people do it.\n3. Do it at least once physically to memorize it \n4. Write down everything on paper or on documents, keep lists so you can \nlook at it all the time and remember what you want.\n5. Try simplify it yourself, by taking a complicated explanation and \nsimplifying it yourself it helps you remember easier.\n6. Practice and keep studying, you must keep doing the practice and \nresearch only when you feel like it. Don't make it a priority, try to \nrelate that skill to something you like for example if you love \narchitecture & want to love geometry or math try find how you can apply it \nto your hobby to make it more interesting.(doesn't work for everything)\ufeff",

You \nimprove at something for every minut you spend on it and you will keep \ndoing that for the rest of your life. There is no \"end goal\" there is only \nfun and improvement. \n\nIf I choose to learn guitar and spend 20 hours on it and I didnt learn it \nin that time, do I then give up? fuark no, I keep playing because I enjoy \nit.

            "text": "TED Talks are no longer offering as much validated information by experts \nand they\u2019re instead moving into \u201cguru\u201d territory.\nThis is the typical Motivational Speech, which promises to give listeners \n(consumers) anything they want just by wishing for it. No effort, no hard \nwork, just the reward.\nAnd people buy those ideas, those products, thinking \u201cI can do it because I \nwant it!\u201d.  When that doesn\u2019t happen (because it never does) and the \noriginal euphoria wears off, the person thinks he/she must be lacking \nmotivation, determination or a skill, not to pursue the activity they \nwanted in the first place, but because they couldn\u2019t follow the \u201cguru\u2019s\u201d \nadvice.\nThen, instead of focusing on their goal, they move on to the next person \nthat looks like a winner and who tells them they can get anything they \nwant, by using HIS own personal method.\nKnow what you want, work to get there, don\u2019t give up.\nIt may sound simple, but it won\u2019t be easy, it\u2019s up to you to decide if it\u2019s \nworth it.\ufeff",
