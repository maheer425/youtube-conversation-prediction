If you think of a system (say, a rock) as being a collection of \nparticles, then on a microscopic level, there might be a number of \ndifferent ways those particles could be arranged. Unfortunately, even if \nyou disregard quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle, it isn't \nfeasible to figure out the positions and momenta of all the individual \nparticles\u2014 and why would you want to, anyway?\nHowever, on a macroscopic level, you can measure the system's temperature, \nvolume, pressure, amount of substance, etc., which constrains the number of \nmicrostates. For instance, if you know that the system is at 285 K, you can \neliminate all the states that give you temperatures less than or greater \nthan 285 K. At thermodynamic equilibrium, these properties are extremely \nclose to special averages over the system's microstates, and they're what \nyou're interested in anyway.\nThe entropy is a function of the probability distribution of microstates. \nSpecifically,\nS = -k_B*(p_1*ln(p_1) + p_2*ln(p_2) + ...)\nwhere S is entropy, k_B the Boltzmann constant, and p_j the probability of \nthe jth microstate AFTER you account for the known temperature, pressure, \netc. Note that the more microstates there are and the lower their \nprobabilities, the higher the entropy will be.

Although I must \nadd a caveat: while string theorists are great at selling their stuff, they \ndon't actually know enough about it to be of much use. In particular, \nnobody knows how to work out brane collision in such a model :)\n\nNevertheless, there is another cyclic cosmology that does kind of what you \nwant: it's called the Baum--Frampton model. In this, expansion becomes so \nviolent towards the end of the universe that a single tiny region that will \nbecome the next universe survives with zero entropy density. So the \nuniverse can then begin anew. It's cute and all, but I have a little \nreluctance to accepting the Big Rip hypothesis unless some actual data pins \nthe behavior of dark energy more precisely. As far as we know right now, it \ncould go either way: the universe could be ripped apart, or it could just \nfizzle out and suffer a heat death.\n\n\"One question though. Would it be possible, sometime in the future with the \nproper technology, to counter the deterioration of data compression? In \nphysical systems that is.\"\n\nNo. The technology itself, whatever it is, must be itself bound by the \nsecond law, so while you might decrease the entropy locally on a physical \nsystem, when you consider the system *plus* your apparatus you'll find the \nentropy will have increased. This is actually a famous problem, known as \nMaxwell's demon. The idea is: you have a box with a gas and a partition in \nthe middle. The partition has a little door, controlled by a demon which \ncan magically measure positions and velocities of the gas' particles. The \ndemon can then open the partition only for fast molecules moving from left \nto right, or for slow molecules moving from right to left. As time goes on, \neven though the demon exerted no work, you would see the temperature rise \nto the right of the partition. You can now hook up a heat engine to your \nsystem and extract useful work, making a perpetual motion machine of the \nsecond kind. Entropy has decreased. Or has it?\n\nWhat Rolf Landauer discovered was that the entropy did not in fact decrease \nas long as you consider the Demon as part of your physical system. Then it \nbecomes clear that any entropy loss is compensated by entropy gain on the \ndemon's brain. Specifically, as long as you assume the demon has finite \nstorage capacity, eventually he'll need to erase some information. The \nprocess of erasure is irreversible (in the thermodynamic sense) and so you \ndon't get to extract thermal energy for free.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon",

Its value is:\n\nk = 1.3806488 \u00d7 10-23 m\u00b2 kg/ (s\u00b2 K)\n\nThe value isn't really important. It doesn't tell you anything about \nentropy or the universe; all it is is a unit conversion factor that depends \non how big meters, kilograms, seconds and kelvin are. You could just as \nwell choose units such that the numerical value of k would be exactly one, \nand indeed, particle physicists do this all the time. Then the formula for \nthe entropy of a physical system at equilibrium (with some technical \nassumptions) will coincide with the formula for information entropy derived \nby Shannon. Except that Shannon's formula uses base-2 logarithms, not \nnatural logarithms. No problem: just redefine your units again such that k \n= 1 / log 2, and then by the change of base formula now the logarithm is \nbase 2, and the entropy will be given in bits. So measuring entropy in bits \nis no harder than measuring entropy in joules/kelvin: all it takes is a \nunit conversion, like changing between feet and meters.\n\nOf course measuring entropy is not that easy in the first place since it \nrequires that you know at least what the internal degrees of freedom *are*. \nYou need to know how much you don't know. Not only is such a calculation \nincredibly cumbersome in practice, it's also hampered by the fact that we \ndon't have access to the ultimate theory of physics so we can never be sure \nthere's not a whole lot of other information hidden away, say, scribbled on \nthe internal degrees of freedom of an electron if they exist. So even \nthough you *can* write down a formula that relates the thermodynamic \nentropy to measurable things like the temperature or the pressure, that \nwon't be the \"real\" entropy but merely a lower bound.

Say a gas. The true physical state of the \ngas is specified by the positions and velocities of every single molecule. \nWe call this the microstate. However, this microstate is not experimentally \naccessible so we must characterize it by other aggregate variables such as \nthe pressure, the temperature and the volume. This set of variables is \ncalled a macrostate. What this means is that we're performing some very \nlossy compression techniques on the state's information -- it's like a \nvery, very bad jpeg of the gas. \n\nIn other words, there will be very many microstates that correspond to a \nsingle macrostate, much like there are many different files that give the \nsame CRC32 checksum. Let's say that W microstates correspond to a single \nmacrostate. Then the entropy associated with the macrostate is given by the \nequation on Boltzmann's gravestone.\n\nS = k log W\n\nSo the entropy of a macrostate is proportional to the logarithm of the \nnumber of microstates that correspond to that macrostate. It's a measure of \nhow bad your information compression is. What the second law of \nthermodynamics states is that your compression can only get worse with time.\n\nWhile people commonly say that entropy is disorder, that really is \nmisleading since there are examples of highly ordered high entropy states. \nA black hole is one example: nothing in this universe can have a higher \nentropy per unit volume (indeed, the entropy of a black hole is \nproportional to its surface area which is surprising but a subject for \nanother time), but it's just a featureless black sphere that can be \ncompletely characterized by three numbers: its mass, its electric charge, \nand its angular momentum.",

Your \nbody is increasing in entropy, and if the entropy (i.e. disorder) gets too \nhigh, you'll die. But the chemical energy in food is \"low entropy\", and \nwhen you eat it, you *use* its increasing entropy to decrease your entropy, \nas long as the TOTAL entropy increases. Actually, that's basically how ALL \nmachines work. When they burn furl or use electricity, they force its \nentropy to increase, and \"use\" that increase to decrease their own entropy, \nso that the total entropy still increases. \n\nAs for the Earth, the Earth is not isolated. The sun is a giant nuclear \nfusion reaction, increasing in entropy by HUGE amounts every second, and \nit's sending huge amounts of \"low entropy\" light to Earth. This is how \nliving things are able to grow, and even evolve, because the sun gives us \nall this \"low entropy\" energy. If there was no sun, then the Earth *would* \njust increase in entropy... plants would not get energy and they would die, \nthen animals could not eat plants and they would die, then other animnals \ncould not eat those animals and they would die, and eventually all sources \nof food and energy would run out, and everyone and everything would die, as \nthe entropy just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
