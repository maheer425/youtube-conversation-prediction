A lot of \nthe mathematics in science seem to be measurements i.e. seconds or meters \nor kilograms. But were all these measurements not manmade constructs? We \ncompare all lengths to a meter or kilometer, but where did they come from? \nThey could be just a random interval someone decided upon. Kilograms and \nother mass measurements are the same. Time might be different, since it \nseems to be based around how long it takes for the earth to orbit the sun, \nbut there is no reason why a second couldn't be twice as long and there \nwere only 30 in a minute. A lot of the measurements we use for mathematics \nare baseless and were standardised for convenience. Its a bit of leap to \napply the same logic to numbers in general, but we created these \nmeasurements as tools for understanding the universe. Could numbers be \nconsidered similarly? Are science and fictionalism even mutually exclusive?\ufeff",

I once thought \nthat tautologies were the stuff of logic, that which defines the universe. \nI guess I just liked tautologies. But tautologies are different in language \nthan in math. For example, if someone reads this and thinks \"what I'm \nreading here is obvious\" then I am writing a tautology. I think that \nnumbering things is a good way of keeping them apart, and counting them is \na good way of confusing them so numbers are not useless after all. But \ntautologies are only parts of theories, and are usually taught in school in \norder to increase knowledge (interestingly, teaching is not the tautologies \nthat you are teaching).Simplicity and complexity are at the two ends of the \nspectrum. In the insanity which is chaos theory, there is the logic which \nis number theory.",

Numbers are good \nfor keeping track of things and are very useful in music and engineering. I \nhave heard that the largest number of things that the mind can number by \nitself is about 7. I have heard of idiots savants that have seen larger \nnumbers. I used to try to group windows into pieces in order to learn more \nabout numbers. 2 dimensional spaces of numbers is the same as a \nmultiplication, for example. 4x3 windows could be 4 rows of 3 windows. \nThat's how numbers are percieved when viewed in nature. And the number 127 \nfor example, is 100 + 20 + 7. Very smart people can view it as other \nthings, depending on their gifts or, more usually, history.Mathematics is a \nperception, a language and a tool. It is a bit like an art, because there's \nvirtuoses that can handle it well. A painting of something is not the thing \nitself. Hence why PC-Gamers usually are peaceful due to their aggressions \nbeing handled by an alternate universe, which in itself can be soothing. Of \ncourse, one of the worst cases scenario of people being stuck \"in the box\" \nis that guy with the \"natural selection\" t-shirt who went on a school \nshooting. He was convinced that life was a video game, and had aggressions \ntowards people. So I would say that PC-Games are like math, people feared \nit in the beginning because it changed their perceptions.There was banning \nreading books in the fear that they would spread unhealthy thoughts. There \nwas the banning of coffee in Sweden during the 1800's and the confiscation \nof items that could be used for drinking coffee because coffee was thought \nto incite people to plan doing criminal things.I just try to relate to the \nfact that I thought that numbers were a real thing, and that there was an \nequation of the universe.",

            "text": "Hey Numberphile, I really enjoyed this video for many reasons. Firstly, I \nlove how you delve into a topic that nobody ever really thinks about. I \nknow in my math class, Honors Pre Calc, we try to understand where our \nformulas come from and understand what they mean and how they help us solve \nproblems. This has led to a few of my classmates to ask, \"Why is this \nimportant?\" or \"What's the point of this?\" with a legitimate want for a \nresponse. My teacher usually provides them with solid answers along the \nlines of \"This is a thinking class as well as a math class.\" Secondly, I \nlike how the information was presented in an objective manner while also \nbeing incredibly entertaining. Lastly, I liked how at the end of the video, \nI was able to pick a stance (I'm a Platonist) and feel empowered by it. \n\nWhenever I've thought about math in the past, I never really questioned the \nexistence of numbers. After watching this video it occurred to me that this \nthought is incredibly polarizing, so much so that it has created 3 \nsubdivisions of opinions. I am slightly confused on the opinion of the \nnominalist outside of whole numbers. It just seems odd to define difficult \nequations and complex numbers in the real world, but I still respect their \nopinion. The way that you described Platonism seems like the strongest of \nthe three sides. Getting back to the purpose of this video, I was inspired \nby you guys taking on the task of making a video about a concept nobody \nreally seems to talk about. This video should definitely be shown to any \nstudent or mathematician who is having an \"existential\" crisis about why \nthey are doing math. \n\nYou guys did a great job being objective in the way you presented the \ninformation. Being a nominalist yourself, it must have been challenging to \nderive a way to elaborate on the other two philosophies without poking \nholes in their arguments. This was really an awesome video that transcends \na lot of boundaries in our world. Anybody can do math, and anybody can have \ntheir own opinion on the concepts of math.\n\nFinally, this video gave me something I didn't have before I watched it, an \neducated opinion on the topic. I can honestly say I had no leaning when it \ncame to whether or not numbers actually existed before this video, but \nafter it, I can say with confidence, that I am a Platonist. So this is a \nbig thank you, Numberphile, you guys did an outstanding job with this \nvideo. You've empowered me, the viewer, to see numbers in a completely \ndifferent way. \ufeff",

And by that I mean a piece of information that \nequals both zero and one at the same time (not that I consider time to even \nexist at this point, I just used it for lack of a better word). So \nultimately this means that all combinations of the two must exist making \nall of reality just a product of infinity.\n\nFirst thing people ask me when I try to explain this is usually \"How do you \nget from numbers to physical things?\" and I tell them to look at a 3D game. \nYou can see that you are playing within a world of seemingly solid objects \nbut at the end of the day you could take the machine code, convert it to \ndecimal and what your left with is a number. A number that contains all the \ninformation needed to create a 3D world. If you think of just enormous \ninfinity actually is would it be any surprise that somewhere in there is \nthe code for Earth and the rest of the universe?",
