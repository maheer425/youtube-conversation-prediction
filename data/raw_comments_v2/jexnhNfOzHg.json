I decribed it \nas a very lite almost washed out blue and brownish colour.\n\nI now find myself wondering why my brain is not interpreting this like a \nnormal person (form either party) and does this effect how I see other \nthings (I assume it does). I am not colour blind and have perfect vision so \nwhy is my brain doing this differentially than anyone else?\ufeff",
