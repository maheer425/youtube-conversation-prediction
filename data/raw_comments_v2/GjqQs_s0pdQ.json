Would a white person get offended if they were called \nnigger? or black person, honkey?\n\nOk hold on, reverse, WTF does LGBTQIA stand for!? seriously, LOL, WTF, ROFL \nall make sense because they're expressions used regularly. But this is the \nfirst time l have encountered an acronym with a Q in it.\n\nThe Q. isn't who stopped them, its why they were stopped? lts not logical \nto expend all your 'assets' when men go to fight they then come home to \nheal their bruises, makes more sense then everyone leaving for the place to \nbe taken easy. Yeah your feminist, you fight for equality, but you try to \nbetter yourself then the man but that just can't be, physically, \nemotionally, educationally, mentally and any other allys.\n\nNo! Correction, men are only raped by other men, if a woman rapes a man its \nonly through the use of drugs and a tool, which gives the woman no pleasure \nso there is no point. You really try to be on one side but the way l'm \nreading what your writing, it seems you're on the other. So now your saying \nrape is caused by what a woman wears? Previously you said something \nnegative about muslim state apparel, but from that last comment it would \nseem you're praising it.\n\nl think clothes are good, they can compliment the wearer, but naked we come \nand naked we go.\n\nSo l guess the wars, the females voted in to head of state, female \nmonarchs, Macbeth and that saying 'behind every strong man is a strong \nwoman', etc is all made up? How l personally know that the beats aren't \ntrue! l was beaten as youngster (l really was bad, but we'll leave that) \nbut l always beaten my mum, never by dad. My dad was too strong, in fact \nlook it up on youtube/google, l'm sure mainly sons get beaten by their mum. \nWell of course l take sides, what do you think l sat down in the library or \ndidn't give up my seat on the tube?\n\nAlthough its slightly wasted here, people treat people like people, not \nlike genders, l think l'll save it for the usa, l would have a ball, :-D.\n\nYou see gender and race are siblings, you can't be from the side that feels \noppression give it back but then say your not an oppressor. To truly be \nequal you can't even pick a side, like child, they don't give a fuck what \nyou are, all they want is food and shelter. ",

Men. And, as for that last \npart, again, that is so 50+ years ago and, still, you had the segregation \nof classes. The poor (id est, those who worked on the ship) died. This is a \nman's world, unfortunately and that is the exact issue that women, that \nfeminists, that egalitarians are all trying to change. \n\n\nYes and men are also normally raped by other men. The point of the matter \nis, women are often told, 'don't dress like that' instead of 'embrace \nyourself for who you are and wear what makes you feel good about yourself' \nand then, if they are raped, it's said to be their own fault. Women \nshouldn't be taught to cover up, men should be taught not to rape.\n\n\nWomen. Were. Not. Waited. On. At least, not most of them. Seriously, have \nyou ever even read a history textbook? Women were no more than accessories \nto men. And yes, sons were beaten too; but nearly as much as the women of \nthe family and not nearly as severely. In some countries, men can still \nlegally beat their wives. Hell, Sharia's Law, in some countries, allows a \nman to legally murder his wife. Clearly, you do take sides as you have been \nvery sexist this entire time. The term 'feminazi' is a sexist term whether \nyou choose to admit it or not.\n\n\nIt was said about women as well, actually. Look it up if you don't believe \nme. And I'm not sexist. How the Hell did you get that? This whole time, \nI've been talking about equality. Can you read? It doesn't seem like it.

There is a very large spectrum and many inbetweens. \n\n\nThere are people who are neither racist nor sexist. To anyone. At all. \n\n\nAgain, feminazi is a derogatory term and is very offensive. Using that term \nonce again proves how sexist you are. Women don't, as you say, 'have the \nworld' and, as I have said already, don't always want more. And you know \nwhat? Men have asked for more as well.\n\n\nUm, many guys, actually. Ever heard of the whole, \"she was asking for it\" \ncoming from rapists, talking about their victims' clothing? And I am \nwell-aware of the fact that there are impoverished countries but no matter \nthe state of other countries, no one deserves to be ridiculed (id est, \nbullied) for any reason.\n\n\nSexism was very prominent back then. Men could beat their wives and \ndaughters and not a damn thing was done about it. And hell no, women were \nnot waited on. Back then, like now, most of the population were not \nwealthy. Also, women were considered possessions and not actual human \nbeings. They didn't have the same rights, they weren't allowed to vote or \nvoice their political opinions, they weren't allowed the same jobs as men, \nand they were beaten on top of all that. Women were expected to wait on \nmen. You've undoubtedly heard of, \"women should be seen and not heard,\" \nwhich is proof of how little men thought of women.",

By using that term alone, one could identify you as sexist.\n\nI don't care for fighting unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\n\nMen have their own freewill and, not that all men do, but those who, as you \nsay, 'give up' certain things for women are probably only doing that \nbecause, a) it's something that they probably shouldn't be doing and their \nrelationship is on the line, which women give up certain things for as \nwell, or b) they're only doing things like holding the door open (which, by \nthe way, I do for everyone, regardless of gender) or helping with something \nheavy because they believe the woman incapable, which is usually a false \nassumption. Don't even get me started on how much women do for men, though \nI must also make the point here that these things can also be done for the \nwomen themselves, such as wearing make up or shaving. \n\n\nAgain, this is the twenty-first century. Wives and mothers do work. There \nare a whole hell of a lot more working women and mothers than there are \nstay-at-home moms. Not only that, but women are in the military too and \nthey do fight in wars. The only reason they didn't initially is because \nthey weren't allowed. They have been for awhile now. Your entire point here \nis ridiculous and inaccurate.\n\n\nNone of those things are feminine and the fact that you think so brands you \neven further as a sexist. \n\n\nHating women (misogyny) and being sexist are completely different things. \n\n\nI'll tell you something right now; I used to be in Air Cadets and the \nmajority of our seventy-person squadron were male. Out of everyone, I, a \nfemale, received top marksman. So don't try to tell me that men have a \nbetter aim (no pun intended.)\n\n\nThey don't advertise it because then, /obviously/ they aren't going to get \na lot of applicants. The fact is, though, the difference in pay is there.\n\n\nI didn't say anything about morals. It is against the rules to ask about a \nwoman's family and it is, to which degree I do not know, unlawful. It is \nagainst the law to fire a woman for being pregnant. She CAN be fired whilst \non maternity leave, but not for BEING on maternity leave. Women get paid \nless while on maternity leave.\n\n\nNo, women do NOT still want more. Women, the majority of the time, just \nwant to be treated as equal.",
