Oxford dictionary added the meaning to gay as \"homosexual.\" \nFor those who know how to read dictionaries properly as well will also \nstate that when someone is called gay, it is meaning of homosexual and \nnothing to do with happiness 'nor coloring, considering that people who are \nreading know how to read in context of whatever is being stated... For some \nreason I feel like know one can read in context anymore... But saying, \n\"this person is gay\" is a tad misleading if there is no actual other words \nto help out, good thing the comments stating someone is gay has context! I \nwanted to reply to Cookiesandcream, but I just wanted to through this rant \nout because no one on the internet gives two shits of what I say! =)\ufeff",
