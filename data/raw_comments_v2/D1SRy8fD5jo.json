It's just common, just like being gay also is. \nGay people didn't magically just appear on earth like they were from Mars. \nGay people have always been on earth just as long as straight people have \nbeen on earth. So stop saying penises were made for vaginas and the other \nway around. Cause it's not like your opinion is going to make them straight.\nEven though you're not going to support them doesn't mean you have to throw \nyour negativity towards them.
