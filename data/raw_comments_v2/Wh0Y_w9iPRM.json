To \nsay it 'is just gross' turns people off trying something new, and is kind \nof insulting to the people who do like it.\n\nSo what if it isn't for you? Yes, it's your opinion but stating it like \nthat as if you know better, as if you're teaching people what to pick/what \nnot to pick because you *clearly* know what's 'good' is not very nice or \nrespectful.\n\nIt's like saying 'earl grey tea is gross'. Or 'black coffee is gross, don't \never order black coffee. Coffee should always be super milky and sweet' - \njust because you don't prefer something a certain way.\n\nI have friends who have really odd bubble tea preferences (200% sugar, \nhonestly), and others who have similarly odd coffee orders, but that's \ntheir preference, and I would never advise someone else 'oh don't get what \nshe's having - it's disgusting', 'cause just that's kinda rude, immature \nand insensitive. :/",
