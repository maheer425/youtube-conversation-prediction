            "text": "Please write me back. \n(if you believe in string theory please don't write me back)\nI have a theory of gravity, and it takes into affect the expansion and \nacceleration of expansion.\nMy theory in a nutshell is not that the shale alone is expanding, but the \nnut and it's germ, and its DNA, and the tiny Adams of its DNA, and down to \nthe smallest electrons and quarks contained with in the nut are all moving \naway from the center of a Big Bang at a speed sufficient to cause \"it's \nmass to expand\". And I postulate that gravity is a function of everything \nbeing pushed out from its tiniest form of mass. That is why all matter \npossesses gravity, and for this to happen the expansion of the tiniest \nparticle has to be accelerating. \nIf you have read this far, clear your mind and let me take you further.\nThe old surface of a balloon with galaxies painted on it is so close yet so \nfar from the truth.!\nImagine with me, not a Single balloon, but 1 million balloons, all \ninflating at the same time at the center of a room each balloon pushing \nagainst the balloon next to it, as they all inflate at the exact same rate. \n(really, take a few seconds and visualize the singularity of first \nuninflated balloons expanding out filling the room.)\nNow add a second cluster, perhaps 100 or 1000 uninflated balloons a few \nfeet away from the 1 million uninflated balloon. Run the thought experiment \nagain, having all balloons expand at the same rate and see how the large \ncluster overtakes the small cluster, and if this does not describe \ngravities Force to you, I will take you further. (this theory came to me 30 \nyears ago, I've had a little time to mole it over\u2026 stick with me, I will \neven tell you how to arrive anywhere in the universe instantaneously, or \nmaybe even a few seconds before you left). You have to let go of physics as \nyou know it to make the leap to what I'm about to tell you, and even if \nyou're a string theorist you may see a tiny contrail collapsing out of \nsight behind every particle in the universe.\nWhether the vacuum of space is pulling and accelerating us, or an ancient \nbig bang is propelling us, imagine every particle of the universe is moving \nand accelerating at a speed sufficient to cause it's mass to expand (why \nwould its mass expand?: \"E equals MC squared\"). \nI could be wrong here, but if the earth is spinning in space, why do I not \nflight off? Maybe I do, but as the particles of my body expand like the \ncluster of balloons, and the earth's particles expand like the larger \ncluster of balloons, then as I fly off, the gap between earth and myself is \nimmediately overcome by expansion. (wouldn't physics be easier if we did \naway with gravity, and only had to calculate the acceleration of expansion \nbetween two objects.) \nBetween getting tired of writing here and the worry that no one will take \nme serious I am not going to explain how this affects quantum physics, \nblack holes, and space travel unless I get a response.\nBut, briefly:, \na black hole is where expansion has stopped. Things are not being sucked in \nas you believe but rather we are expanding pass the non-expanding space.\nI like to use what I called the \"helicopter effect\" to explain quantum \nbehavior. It has to do with the rate of speed forward and the rotational \nspeed of the blade. If an electron is spinning about Is nucleus while \nmoving near the speed of light it is like the blade of a helicopter, if the \nhelicopter moves forward faster than the blades One side will stop, or even \nmove relatively backwards. You can figure it out yourself I'm sure!\nAnd instantaneous space travel, forget wormholes and curved space. Forget \nthe sheet of paper folded to make the points meet. I wish I had more \npatience to explain in greater detail, but imagine the universe is \nexpanding so rapidly that a second ago the entire universe was smaller than \nyour hand, and in a second from now you will expand to a size larger than \nthe current size of the universe. Now imagine you need to be at some other \npoint in the universe in the next few seconds because you don't have time \nfor Cryogenix, don't ask me how but you merely have to go backwards in time \na few seconds, shift your position 1 inch to the left, or maybe 2 inches to \nthe right, believe me this will have to be more precise then could ever be \nachieved but now you snap back from your brief time travel to present time \nand \"presto\" you are on some distant part of the universe far from where \nyou begin.\n\"dang, I can't believe I wrote this much!\"\n\nP.S.: this video had it so close and yet they did not let the cat and its \nowner expand with the space or they would have nailed it!!!\ufeff",

The Hubble Parameter is now measured at about 70 \nkilometers per second per Megaparsec. So that means that the expansion of \nthe universe causes galaxies to recede at a velocity which increases by 70 \nkm/sec for each Megaparsec of distance from the earth. (A Megaparsec is \n3.26 Million Light Years.) This sounds like a lot of speed, but it's \nactually fairly slow compared with the speed of stars and planets in their \norbits. So this speed is negligible at distances of stars and planets, and \nis easily compensated for by the force of gravity. But at a big distance \nbetween galaxies like 100 Megaparsecs, the recession speed due to the \nexpansion of the universe is  7,000 km/sec.\n\nThe scale of the universe when light is emitted from a galaxy is indicated \nby the redshift of the light observed. Redshift is a dimensionless number \nusually designated by the letter \"Z.\"  It's easily derived that Z is \nrelated to the scale of the universe \"a\" by:\n\n1 + Z = a(now) / a(then) .\n\nSo for a redshift  Z = 5,    a(then) = 1/6 of the scale of the universe \nnow.

It's so small at the scale of planets, stars, \nand the diameter of galaxies, that these things are never observed to \nchange in scale. But at the VAST distances BETWEEN galaxies, the \nexpansion rate becomes enormous, relative to an observer on earth. At a \ndistance of about 14 billion light years, galaxies are receding from earth \nat the speed of light. Beyond that, they recede even faster.

            "text": "Einstein's General Theory of Relativity IS the modern theory of gravity. In \nthat theory, gravity is defined as the bending of four dimensional \nspacetime by massive objects. Other massive objects and radiation moving \nthrough space follow the contours of warped spacetime in their motion as if \ndeflected by a force.This IS gravity, according to Einstein and the Theory \nof General Relativity. It sounds weird, but it works a lot better than \nIsaac Newton's theory of gravity. (You can think of the bowling ball and \nrubber sheet analogy here, but it's just an analogy to try to illustrate \nit. It isn't real.)  \n\nGravity exists at significant levels only within a fairly small region of \nspace around a massive body.\n\nThe same four dimensional spacetime also describes the expansion of the \nuniverse. In modern cosmology, the four dimensional spacetime of General \nRelativity expands according to a theoretical expansion model. It carries \neverything in space with it. The farther objects are from each other, the \nfaster they move in expanding space relative to each other, because there's \nmore space between them to do the expanding.\n\nThings beyond a certain distance actually recede from each other faster \nthan light. That's OK. No laws are broken. Space can expand as fast as it \nwants to.\n\nThe universe began when space was very dense and very hot. It was also so \nmuch smaller that everything we can see in the sky today was less than the \nsize of an atom. It has expanded to the size it is today over the last \n13.798 Billion Years. I'm not making this up.....and once again, no laws \nwere broken. Space can pretty much do whatever it wants to.\n\nSpacetime gravity predominates at fairly small distances within a local \ngravitationally bound group.......from the sun and planets....out to the \nstars of the Milky Way.......out to Andromeda and the local group of \ngalaxies. At these distances, the effect of the expanding universe is \nnegligible, and the force of gravity rules.\n\nMuch farther out into the universe....like beyond 100 million light years \nor so......gravity is negligible and the effect of the universal expansion \nof spacetime rules.\n\nIt's all pretty cool when you think about it.
